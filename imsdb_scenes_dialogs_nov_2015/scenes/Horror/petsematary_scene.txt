"PET SEMATARY" by Stephen King

FADE IN ON

that most persistent summer SOUND: crickets in high grass--

ree-ree-ree-ree... This in dark which slowly

EXT.  A GRAVE MARKER  SUMMER DAY

It's a plywood cross leaning aslant. Written on the crossarm in

black paint which has faded: SMUCKY  HE WAS OBEDIENT. The letters

are faded. They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a

child.

MAIN TITLES BEGIN.

EXT.  ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER

A child's printing again, this time on a chunk of warped crating:

BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER

1971-1974.

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE

EXT.  TWO MARKERS

I think all these shots are LAP DISSOLVES. All is silence but for

the crickets and the wind stirring the grass. Around the markers

themselves, the grass has been clipped short, and by some markers

there are flowers in cheap vases. Crisco cans, Skippy peanut

butter jars, etc.

These two markers: IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1,

1965 (on a wide flat board) and GEN PATTON (OUR! GOOD! DOG!) APRIL

1958 (another board).

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE

EXT.  FIVE OR SIX MARKERS

We can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the

"gravestones" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that

this woodland clearing's a rather eerie -- and well-populated --

animal graveyard.

We can see: POLYNESIA, 1953 and HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER

LIVED. HANNAH'S tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood,

painstakingly hammered flat.

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE.

EXT.  ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY

From here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by

forest pines. We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are

arranged in rough concentric circles. On the far side of this

clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard

clearing. The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which

hold up a crude arch. We can see no writing on this side -- the

words on the arch face those arriving along the path.

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE

EXT.  THE ARCH, FROM THE PATH SIDE, CU

MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE. Written on the arch in faded black paint is

the work of some long-gone child: PET SEMATARY.

THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN PANS SLOWLY

DOWN to look through the arch. From this angle we are looking

across to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead

branches at the back of the graveyard. It's maybe twenty-five feet

from side to side and about nine feet high. At either end are

thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible.

AS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE, THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the

deadfall. And as it does, we realize that there is a horrible

snarling face in those branches. Is this an accident? Coincidence?

Our imagination? Perhaps the audience will wonder. THE CAMERA

HOLDS ON IT and then we

BLACK. And a white title card: MOVING DAY.

EXT.  A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY  EVENING

SOUND of crickets: ree-ree-ree-ree...

To the left of this house: a big empty field. Behind it: the

woods. Before it: a wide two-lane road.

The house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a

shed/garage attached. In front of it is a sign which reads QUINN

REALTORS 292 HAMMOND STREET, BANGOR. A big SOLD strip, like a

bumper sticker, has been plastered across it diagonally.

GROWING SOUND: the rumble of a truck. A big, big truck. It belts

between the CAMERA and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver

body and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters. Its

short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke. Behind it

comes a Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the

driveway of the house we've been looking at.

EXT.  REAR OF THE WAGON

As LOUIS CREED brings it to a stop we get a good look at the

license plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker (HAVE YOU HUGGED

YOUR M.D. TODAY?)

The ENGINE SOUND stops. For a moment or two we hear only the ree-

ree-ree-ree of crickets. Then:

EXT.  THE WAGON, A NEW ANGLE

The two front doors and one back door open. LOUIS CREED, about 32,

gets out from the driver's side. RACHEL CREED, his wife, gets out

from the passenger side. From the rear door comes ELLIE CREED, a

girl of 6. They are staring, fascinated, at the house.

They come together, the three of them, by the front of the wagon,

still staring at the house. LOUIS is clearly nervous.

RACHEL begins to smile. She turns to LOUIS and hugs him.

She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging

down from the bough of a tree.

She goes running toward it. RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile.

They kiss--gently at first, then more passionately. As he draws

her more tightly against him, a baby--GAGE--begins to cry from the

car. LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch.

This SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat.

They walk to the car, RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors,

LOUIS to the rear of the wagon.

INT.  THE FRONT SEAT, WITH RAHEL AND GAGE

GAGE is sitting in his car seat, not exactly crying but certainly

yelling to be let out. The seat, dash, and floorboards are

littered with roadmaps, soda cans, Big Mac boxes, and similar

crud. These folks have driven all the way from Chicago to Maine in

this station wagon, and the wagon looks it.

She begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses. GAGE is just

wearing a t-shirt and a diaper. He's fifteen months old.

EXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS

He opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier. We see a big

tomcat inside--mostly what we're aware of are shining green eyes.

LOUIS, cat carrier still in hand, turns toward:

EXT.  ELLIE IN THE TIRE SWING

She's got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs.

EXT.  THE VIEW UP TOWARD THE WOODS, ELLIE'S POV

We see the field, and a clearly marked and mown path leading up

its flank and into the dark woods.

THE CAMERA DIPS AND PENDULUMS as ELLIE swings.

EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE (FRONT OF THE CAR)

She puts GAGE down. He totters a bit on his little legs and then

stands there, looking at his sister.

EXT.  THE ROPE AND THE BRANCH, CU

The bark has rubbed off the branch--it looks like a bone peeping

through decayed flesh. The rope is old, discolored. And it is

fraying away as we look at it. Soon ELLIE, like Humpty Dumpty, is

going to have a great fall.

EXT.  LOUIS (REAR OF THE CAR)

He's set the cat-carrier down and is straightening up.

His eyes widen.

EXT.  ELLIE

SOUND: A heavy twang! as the rope breaks. The tire swing--with

ELLIE still inside it--goes crashing to the grass. ELLIE screams

and begins to cry--a little hurt and a lot surprised.

LOUIS and RACHEL run to her.

EXT.  ELLIE, RACHEL, LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT

ELLIE'S parents reach the tangle of tire, rope, and six-year-old

girl.

Nevertheless, he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from

the tire. RACHEL helps.

EXT.  GAGE

He's standing in the driveway by the front of the car, utterly

forgotten in the heat of the moment. His diaper is sagging quite a

bit; the boy needs a change.

He stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit, then loses

interest. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks down the side of the station

wagon, little bare feet slapping on the asphalt. He stops for a

moment at the back, looking at the cat-carrier, which LOUIS never

got around to opening. CHURCH is staring hopefully out through the

mesh.

GAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door. No soap.

Either he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the

strength. Anyway, he stops trying after a moment.

SOUND: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one.

EXT.  THE ROAD (GAGE'S POV)

A big tanker truck--silver body, ORINCO written on the side in

blue letters--blasts by.

EXT.  GAGE, BY THE CAT CARRIER

The windlash if the passing truck blows GAGE'S hair back from his

forehead. We should be scared here--not by the truck, but by

GAGE'S lack of fear. He's smiling, happy.

He starts down the driveway toward the road.

EXT.  LOUIS, RACHEL, ELLIE (AT THE SWING)

ELLIE has been disentangled from the swing. She's sitting by the

wreckage at the end of the driveway, weeping hysterically (as much

from tiredness as from pain, I think) as LOUIS and RACHEL examine

her scraped knee. The wound doesn't look too serious.

RACHEL suddenly looks around toward:

EXT.  THE FRONT OF THE WAGON (RACHEL'S POV)

No one there.

EXT.  RACHEL, ELLIE, LOUIS, BY THE SWING

They get up together.

EXT.  GAGE, AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD

A truck is coming. A great big one.

EXT.  ANGLE ON THE TRUCK, CU

The grille looks like a tombstone that's learned how to snarl.

EXT.  GAGE

He takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab

him.

GAGE looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is

used to being picked up and treated humanely. To GAGE strangers

are as interesting as...well, as interesting as Orinco trucks.

EXT.  GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL

The fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old

blue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. Over this he wears

a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. His face is deeply

wrinkled and kindly.

But he softens this with a grin. GAGE grins back at him.

JUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's

joined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE

brings up the rear. She's still sniffling.

He sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easy--no

crushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as

if he might have arthritis.

He leans over toward ELLIE.

They all laugh--even GAGE.

As RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away:

She goes belting off.

SOUND: A truck engine, gearing down.

EXT.  A MOVING VAN

It blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE

GAGE has been changed, and RACHEL is following him as he explores

the nearest edges of the new homestead. They are fairly close to

the wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path

ELLIE has already glimpsed.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

They cross to the van. The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just

climbing out of the van.

EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH

She's holding GAGE on her hip now, and both of them are looking at

that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the

deepening twilight. LOUIS and JUD join them.

JUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that

he is serious.

He smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of

understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference

between the CREEDS and JUD.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT

SOUND: Crickets. Ree--ree--ree-ree...

There's one light upstairs, one downstairs. Perhaps we see the

path, glimmering away into the field? Either by virtue of it being

mown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick? Maybe.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

There's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in

here. The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. It's

going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers'

cartons stacked all over the place.

LOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned

tired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first

night in the new place will understand.

He finishes the last of the Pepsi and surveys the living room. He

sits on one of the bigger boxes, takes cigarettes from his pocket,

and lights one. He drops the spent match in the empty can, and

taps into the can during the scene.

SOUND: Feet coming down the stairs. The door on the far side of

the room opens and RACHEL comes in, wearing a nightgown.

He hugs her. She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just

two good people in all the big darkness of their new house.

She laughs.

EXT.  THE PATH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT

Pervasive SOUND of the crickets as LOUIS comes rather hesitantly

up the crazy-paved path from the road's edge.

EXT.  THE SCREENED-IN PORCH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE

We hear the SQUEAK of a rocker; we see the dim red fitful glow of

JUD'S Pall Mall. We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman

earphones.

EXT.  LOUIS

INT.  THE PORCH, WITH JUD

The Walkman is in his lap. He switches it off and puts the

headphones casually around his neck, like a kid.

INT.  THE PORCH, A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT

LOUIS comes on up. JUD has got a pail of ice beside his chair with

some cans of beer in it. He opens one and hands it to LOUIS.

LOUIS drinks half the can at a draught.

He passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the

Walkman's PLAY button.

SOUND: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats.

LOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head.

He turns it down.

LOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments.

It's the instrumental break. Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot

Fenders. LOUIS takes the earphones off.

He drinks again--they both do. There's a moment of companionable

silence here, broken by the SOUND of a big truck. They look

toward:

EXT/INT.  THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN)

One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are

little amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too--

sweeps by in a blast of air.

INT.  THE PORCH, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

Here JUD raises his glass in a toast.

LOUIS clinks his glass against JUD'S.

They drink.

EXT.  ROUTE 9  NIGHT

LOUIS crosses from the CRANDALL side to his own, and the CAMERA

FOLLOWS as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon. He

pauses for a moment, looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new

house. Then something--the CRY of an OWL, perhaps--draws his

attention the other way...toward the path.

He walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in

a wide cut swath that's a bit ghostly in the dark.

A SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and LOUIS

recoils with a startled, muffled cry.

EXT.  CHURCH

The cat, sure; who--or what--else? We see his big green eyes in

the dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow!

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH

LOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND

comes again and he looks toward:

EXT.  THE ROAD, LOUIS'S POV

Another Orinco tanker drones by, fast.

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH

He starts toward the house.

BLACK. And in that blackness, we see a second title card: THE DEAD

SPEAK.

INT.  A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD, CU  DAY

Written on it is: MONDAY 1.) CHURCH SPAYED 10 A.M. QUENTIN

JOLANDER, D.V.M. And below, in even bigger letters: 2.) ELLIE'S

FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!

THE CAMERA PANS LEFT, showing us the kitchen. There are still a

few cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape.

We look out the window and see the CREEDS, led by JUD CRANDALL,

climbing the path toward the woods. LOUIS has got GAGE in a

Gerrypak.

EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH CREEDS AND JUD

They are also at the edge of the woods. JUD stops and lets them

catch up.

They turn around, and their faces express their wonder.

EXT.  THE VIEW

It is indeed beautiful. The CREED house is in the f.g., Route 9

just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning

along), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river

valley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue.

EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH JUD AND THE CREEDS

They go into the woods, still following the path.

EXT.  FOREST  DAY

These are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight

shafting through them. It looks as though man has never made his

mark here.

THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them, on the path. Here it is

carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked.

JUD stops. LOUIS looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there

are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps

are.

He starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ELLIE scampers after him.

LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back. Then

they press on.

EXT.  THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY

EXT.  JUD AND THE CREEDS, ON THE PATH

ELLIE is of course second. Se tries to read the words on the arch

but can't. She whips around to look at her mother.

A strange expression has come over RACHEL'S face--she doesn't like

this. Not a bit.

She runs for the arch. RACHEL starts; looks more uneasy than ever.

EXT.  ELLIE

She's almost under the arch. She looks back, questioning.

EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD

EXT.  ELLIE

She goes racing into the Pet Sematary.

EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD

JUD lights a cigarette with a wooden match, using his thumbnail.

EXT.  ELLIE, AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY

She surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight, then runs

toward the center, pausing to investigate some of the markers as

she goes. We clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings.

EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD

They are walking slowly toward that rude archway. LOUIS is

extremely interested in all this, but it's becoming clearer and

clearer that RACHEL is troubled. They stop and look in.

She's growing more and more upset. JUD looks at her curiously.

EXT.  ELLIE, ON THE DEADFALL

She has begun to climb it, and this looks like an extremely

dangerous proposition. ELLIE, however, is having the time of her

life. A branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches

nimbly to the next one up.

EXT.  THE GROWNUPS, AT THE ARCH

He hurries in.

EXT.  ELIIE, ON THE DEADFALL

She looks back at JUD.

EXT.  ELLIE'S FOOT, CU

The branch she's on breaks with a dry CRRRACK. Her foot drops down

suddenly.

EXT.  ELLIE AND JUD

She totters backward, pinwheeling her arms, and JUD catches her as

she falls. Not much of a catch because she wasn't too far up.

LOUIS joins JUD and ELLIE. GAGE jounces along on his back.

EXT.  RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH

Her discomfort makes one thing very clear--she doesn't want to

come in.

EXT.  LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE

EXT.  RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH

EXT.  LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE--BY THE DEADFALL

JUD looks toward:

EXT.  RACHEL AT THE ARCH (ELLEN IN F.G.)

RACHEL has retreated a bit. She sits on the pine needle carpet of

the path, opens her purse, and draws out cigarettes.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

JUD looks at LOUIS as if to say "What's all this about?" LOUIS

looks away.

EXT.  ELLIE

She runs from one tombstone to the next, cheerful as maybe only a

kid could be in such a place. She looks at BIFFER'S tombstone; at

SMUCKY'S.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

They are walking slowly toward her. LOUIS is looking at the

tombstones.

EXT.  ELLEN

She runs amid the tombstones--they have worked their way near to

the center and there are quite a few of them--and joins the

adults.

He points again, and Ellen goes over for a look-see.

EXT.  ELLEN, AT THE GRAVE MARKER

It is a small slate marker slanted to one side. ELLEN reads the

words laboriously, tracing them with her finger.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS

LOUIS looks at him sharply as ELLIE rejoins them.

ELLIE looks awed. LOUIS looks a little awed, too.

JUD sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is

still looking at ELLEN.

He sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs. He ruffles her

hair reassuringly.

They start to walk slowly back toward the arch.

EXT.  RACHEL, OUTSIDE THE ARCH

It's clear she's impatient and out-of-sorts with the whole thing.

EXT.  LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD

EXT.  RACHEL AND ELLIE

But RACHEL is not amused. She doesn't like any of this.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

LOUIS looks at him, startled, then decides this is a joke. He

laughs. JUD smiles, a trifle thinly.

EXT.  THE ARCH, A NEW ANGLE

The men rejoin RACHEL and ELLIE.

They move away.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL, FROM THE ARCH

The face we saw at the beginning of the movie wasn't there when

the visitors were there...but it's sure there now, leering at us.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TRASH CAN  NIGHT

There are two greasy boxes poking out with NAPOLI PIZZA stamped on

them. Guess dinner was burned.

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we se LOUIS sitting at the kitchen

table. The table is covered with newspapers. On it, LOUIS is

putting together a complicated model boat, using glue and

tweezers. He's wearing glasses.

ELLIE comes in, wearing a nightgown. She watches him for awhile.

LOUIS looks around at her, surprised.

INT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR

RACHEL is coming along with some dirty dishes. She hears voices

and stops, listening, her face troubled and afraid.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

Ellis has started to cry.

Poor kid's bawling her eyes out now. LOUIS folds her into his arms

and she hugs him tightly, wanting his comfort.

She breaks down completely, sobbing, and LOUIS rocks her back and

forth.

INT.  THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL

She is crying silently.

INT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

She is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness. An oblong shaft of

light falls on her, illuminating her more clearly. She's asleep

with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her

mouth.

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH RACHEL

RACHEL looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly

closes the door.

INT.  LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

LOUIS is in his pajamas, propped up on pillows on his side of the

bed. There a number of medical books scattered around him and he's

making notes from one as RACHEL comes in.

It should be clear to us by now that, despite her words, RACHEL is

much more upset than ELLIE was. LOUIS slowly puts his notebook

aside and caps his pen.

She stalks to the bathroom, which adjoins. LOUIS follows. She goes

in and slams the door. He goes for the knob.

SOUND: CLICK OF THE LOCK.

LOUIS stares at the door, bewildered and upset.

EXT.  ROUTE 9  NIGHT

Here comes a big Orinco truck, droning along, headlights glaring.

INT.  LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM

The headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see LOUIS

and RACHEL asleep, each as far over to his/her own side as he/she

can get, with a big empty space in the middle.

Lights and TRUCK SOUNDS slowly fade.

INT.  GAGE  MORNING

Cheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way

across the tray of his high-chair--it looks a little like a map of

the Pacific islands done by a guy who only had a yellow crayon.

Now he scoops up a handful and throws them.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE

Splat! Eggs on the serving plate of toast.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, A WIDER SHOT

RACHEL is at the sink, doing dishes (we see the blackboard with

its message near her).

LOUIS comes in, wearing a sport-coat and slacks, ready for his

first day on the job...and ELLIE is in a pretty first day of

school dress.

INT.  BY THE KITCHEN DOOR

Here is the cat-carrier with CHURCH inside it. He waows unhappily.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE AND GAGE

ELLIE gets down and goes across to the cat-carrier.

INT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK

LOUIS looks shocked and amused by ELLIE'S colorful choice of

words.

INT.  ELLIE

INT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK

LOUIS tries to kiss RACHEL'S mouth. She turns her head slightly so

he gets her cheek instead. She's still mad. LOUIS'S amusement

dies.

INT.  ELLIE, BY THE CAT CARRIER

INT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL, BY THE SINK

She gives him a look as if to say: "There! Now do you understand

what you did?"

At this RACHEL tightens up still more in that funny way--she's

actually angered by LOUIS'S reference to catburgers--but under the

anger we sense she is deeply shocked, as a prudish woman might be

shocked by a dirty joke. For RACHEL, that's just what death is.

ELLIE goes slowly back to the table.

ELLIE bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, A NEW ANGLE (FEATURES LOUIS AND RACHEL)

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they go to the table to comfort ELLIE.

She runs off, cheered up. And RACHEL is cheered up, too.

He gets up and leaves the table. She looks after him, stunned and

a little frightened.

INT.  GAGE

He picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and

throws it in the direction of the cat-carrier.

INT.  THE CAT-CARRIER

CHURCH is close to the mesh, looking out. Scrambled eggs hit the

mesh, driving him back, surprised.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING

The school bus pulls up, red lights flashing. ELLIE runs toward it

across the lawn, with her lunch-box.

EXT.  LOUIS, RACHEL, AND GAGE, IN THE FRONT DOORWAY

LOUIS grabs GAGE'S hand and makes him wave it.

EXT.  THE BUS

ELLIE climbs aboard. The red flashers go out and the bus pulls

away.

EXT.  THE CREED DRIVEWAY  MORNING

The station wagon is parked there. LOUIS comes out with a heavy

briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other. He opens

the wagon's doorgate.

A small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS.

A rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the

front of her car. Her color is bad. This is MISSY DANDRIDGE. She

looks at the cat-carrier.

She opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat

pile of folded sheets. She reaches for them, then winces and

presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an

attack of indigestion.

She starts toward the house with the sheets.

EXT.  THE SIDE YARD  MORNING

RACHEL hurries past MISSY, who turns to look and then goes on into

the house. LOUIS has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the

wagon and closed the doorgate as RACHEL reaches him.

LOUIS appears to consider this seriously for a moment...and then

he smiles and hugs her. They kiss.

EXT.  VICTOR PASCOW AND FRIENDS  MORNING

PASCOW is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one

girl. They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him, not to

drop him. A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the

bearers.

PASCOW'S head is upside down to the CAMERA, which retreats ahead

of the advancing students. Fixed eyes stare. Half of his head has

been shattered inward. Before the catastrophe he was a husky male

of about twenty. He's dressed in a U of M muscle shirt and red

jogging shorts.

THE CAMERA PULLS JERKILY TO ONE SIDE, allowing the bearers to

mount the steps of a brick building. The infirmary. The lookers-on

break to either side. The infirmary doors open.

EXT.. NURSE CHARLTON, AT THE DOORS

She's the head nurse, a tough old babe of about fifty.

The bearers sweep past her and inside, leaving a red smear of

blood across the midriff of MARCY CHARLTON'S uniform.

INT.  THE INFIRMARY RECEPTION AREA

THE CAMERA will show us all we need to see, but its movements will

seem almost random; this is like being in the hotel kitchen after

Sirhan shot Bobby.

As the students bring in PASCOW, LOUIS comes running, followed by

STEVE MASTERTON, his P.A. Standing to one side are two student

nurses in candystriper uniforms. They're boggled and horrified.

LOUIS kneels. THE CAMERA RUSHES FORWARD, shoving between

onlookers. LOUIS looks at the wound. There's shattered bone and

pulsing brain tissue beneath.

There's a scream; the girl who was carrying one corner of the

blanket is having hysterics.

CHARLTON puts her arms around the girl.

THE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from

STEVE and shines it in PASCOW'S bulging, fixed eyes.

CHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out

the door.

PASCOW makes a weird gargling noise. Blood suddenly spurts out of

his mouth. He begins to seizure.

One of the candystripers shrieks. THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the

student nurses. One turns and throws up on the wall.

CHARLTON rushes over.

As they start away, one helping the other down the hall, and as

CHARLTON starts over to where PASCOW lies dying on his blanket,

THE CAMERA DROPS TO LOUIS AND STEVE.

They hold PASCOW'S spasming body.

PASCOW begins to quiet.

She leaves. LOUIS is alone with PASCOW. CHARLTON has drawn the

drapes, so the doctor and the dying man have complete if temporary

privacy.

INT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW, A CLOSER SHOT

PASCOW'S fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand bear-traps

LOUIS'S right wrist. The dying man pulls him slowly but

relentlessly down, until their faces are only inches apart.

LOUIS recoils, breaking the grip of the hand...but he cannot quite

snap the grip of those bright dying eyes. Blood leaks from

PASCOW'S mouth.

PASCOW struggles hard to speak again. At first he can only gurgle.

LOUIS leans forward again, terrified, yet needing to know.

LOUIS grabs PASCOW'S bloody shoulder.

INT.  HALLWAY ENTRANCE TO RECEPTION, WITH STEVE

INT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW

PASCOW begins to spasm again.

PASCOW spews more blood as STEVE kneels beside LOUIS.

INT.  THE MAIN INFIRMARY HALLWAY

CHARLTON is pushing along your basic MEDCU goodie-cart, covered

with emergency life-saving gear.

INT.  LOUIS, STEVE, PASCOW

PASCOW'S spasms are weakening.

PASCOW'S hand comes up and paws at LOUIS'S shirt, leaving a bloody

handprint. Then it falls limply back. PASCOW is dead.

STEVE leaves the frame and LOUIS stares fixedly down at the body

of VICTOR PASCOW. He closes the eyes.

EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, LATE AFTERNOON

It's the leading edge of Maine fall, sunny and wonderful. Here

comes LOUIS'S station wagon. As it reaches THE CAMERA, it swivels

to TRACK.

INT.  THE CAR, WITH LOUIS

He still looks shocked by the tragedy. The dying man's bloody

handprint is partly visible on LOUIS'S shirt in spite of his

sport-coat.

LOUIS abruptly turns off the radio and swerves over to the side of

the road.

EXT.  THE STATION WAGON

IT comes to a slueing, shuddering stop, almost going in the ditch.

INT.  LOUIS, BEHIND THE WHEEL

He stares blankly through the windshield.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT

All lights are off. It's late.

INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM  NIGHT

LOUIS and RACHEL are asleep, each on his/her own side of the big

double. THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON LOUIS.

SOUND: Loud, hollow BANG. It's very loud--loud enough to wake the

dead.

LOUIS sits up. Beside him, RACHEL sleeps on. LOUIS'S eyes widen in

terror as he stares at:

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH PASCOW

He's exquisitely dead. Now pallid as well as smashed up.

INT.  LOUIS

He is in terror...but he is also in a state of near-trance.

INT.  PASCOW

INT.  LOUIS

He glances at RACHEL. Although PASCOW has spoken in a fairly loud

voice--and the opening door was like a bomb--she's still fast

asleep. LOUIS looks back toward PASCOW...and then gets out of bed.

He's naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms.

INT.  PASCOW

He turns and leaves the doorway.

INT.  LOUIS

He reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at:

INT.  THE BED, LOUIS'S POV

RACHEL is sleeping as before, and LOUIS himself is also in bed

asleep, although his rest is uneasy...as if he's having a bad

dream.

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH LOUIS

INT.  THE KITCHEN

LOUIS enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the

shed/garage. This door stands open. LOUIS pauses by it.

LOUIS goes into:

INT.  THE SHED/GARAGE

The station wagon is a dark hulk. LOUIS crosses to it and stands,

perplexed.

PASCOW looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him. LOUIS

turns... and suddenly his face is less than an inch from PASCOW'S

mutilated face.

He begins to move toward the garage door. After a moment LOUIS

follows him.

EXT.  THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE, LONG  NIGHT

We can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods--PASCOW

and, behind him, LOUIS.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY ARCH

CAMERA HOLDS, THEN PANS DOWN as LOUIS passes under the arch.

EXT.  LOUIS, CLOSE

He looks around, obviously afraid.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV

We can see why. By starlight this is one scary place.

EXT.  LOUIS

He suddenly sees something else, and now his fear is close to

terror.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL, LOUIS'S POV

The face is back in the tumbled branches. It yawns and snarls.

EXT.  LOUIS

He walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized. PASCOW'S hand falls

on his shoulder. LOUIS turns, terrified.

EXT.  PASCOW, CLOSE

He really is a dreadful mangled mess.

EXT.  LOUIS

He closes his eyes.

EXT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW

He points at:

EXT.  THE DEADFALL

That grinning face--and perhaps now there are other effects as

well, subtle but there? Dim red light? A misty smoke drifting

through the tumbled dead branches? The director will know.

After a moment there is a HUGE GRUNTING ROAR from the woods behind

the deadfall--it sounds like no animal we've ever heard before.

There is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree

like a toothpick.

EXT.  PASCOW AND LOUIS

LOUIS has crumbled to PASCOW'S feet. His eyes are squeezed tightly

shut.

CAMERA BEGINS MOVING SLOWLY IN ON LOUIS.

CAMERA IS TIGHT ON LOUIS.

As the Ramones start blasting "Sheena Is A Punk Rocker":

INT.  LOUIS, IN BED

His eyes snap open. He's in his own bedroom. As he sits up THE

CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS OUT so we can see that he's in bed alone; the

covers on RACHEL'S side are thrown back.

After the initial confusion and fear, LOUIS looks deeply relieved;

he looks the way I suppose we all look upon waking up and

realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all.

He throws the covers back and freezes.

INT.  LOUIS'S FEET, LOUIS'S POV

They are covered with mud and pine needles. The sheets are greased

with woods-muck.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

Utter terror.

INT.  THE LAUNDRY CHUTE, CU

LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and dump a bundle of sheets into the

chute.

INT.  LOUIS, IN THE UPSTAIRS HALL

He's naked but for a towel around his waist. He's obviously fresh

from the shower.

He starts down to the bedroom to dress.

BLACK. And on it a third title card: CHURCH.

Over this the SOUND of a RINGING TELEPHONE.

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM  AFTERNOON

There's a bowling match on TV. LOUIS, dressed in his Saturday

afternoon grubs (jeans and a Maine sweatshirt), has the phone to

his ear.

INT.  THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD

He's on the phone, looking out his window.

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

INT.  THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

EXT.  THE CRANDALL HOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG

We're looking across from the CREED lawn. LOUIS waits for one of

those trucks to go blasting by and then crosses. It's cold and

windy. Downed autumn leaves fly.

LOUIS and JUD stand over a small furry body like mourners.

EXT.  THE CAT'S BODY

It's lying on its belly and doesn't look much damaged. Hands--

LOUIS'S--come into the frame. He puts one hand under the cat's

head and lifts it so the open eyes, now a dull green, stare into

THE CAMERA. There's some blood on its ruff. That's all.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, ON THE EDGE OF THE CRANDALL LAWN

From his jacket pocket he takes a green plastic garbage bag and

hands it to JUD. JUD holds the bag's mouth open on the ground

while LOUIS kind of shoves the body in. During this:

LOUIS twists the bag shut and puts one of those plastic ties on

it. Then he holds it up.

During all of this JUD has grown peculiarly intense.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN  MORNING

GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE, in her first-day-of-school

dress, is in her place. LOUIS is sitting at his own place staring,

hypnotized, at the middle of the table, where there is a large

serving dish. On the dish is scrambled eggs, strips of bacon, and

CHURCH'S corpse--staring eyes, bloody ruff and all.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL LAWN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS

EXT.  THE START OF THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LONG  EVENING

LOUIS and JUD cross the road from the CRANDALL side. LOUIS is

carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the

other. JUD has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of

his own in the other.

Evening shadows have grown long. It's maybe an hour until dark.

JUD and LOUIS stop near the replaced tire-swing.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

JUD has a Walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones

slung around his neck.

He puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further

argument, and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman. We can hear

Marshall Crenshaw singing "Crystal Girl." JUD starts away. After a

moment, LOUIS follows.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY AND THE BACK OF THE ARCH  LATE EVENING

The SOUND of crickets...ree-ree-ree...

The SOUND of footfalls.

Faintly, the SOUND of Huey Lewis and the News, singing "Working

For A Living."

It's now almost twilight.

JUD and LOUIS enter the Pet Sematary. LOUIS is looking around

curiously.

JUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck

again.

He walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall. LOUIS follows.

He points at the deadfall.

He holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as

he says. After a moment he says:

JUD starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its

snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of

stairs. After a few second, LOUIS follows.

EXT.  THEIR FEET

First JUD'S pass THE CAMERA, then LOUIS'S, partly obscured by the

swinging cat-bag. Their feet unerringly find the right branches

and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's grinning, exhilarated.

EXT.  JUD

There are beads of sweat on the old man's face. He looks both

stern and a little scared.

EXT.  LOUIS

He looks down.

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

A dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot

plunges down maybe six inches.

EXT.  LOUIS

He lurches to the edge of balance, then regains it.

He continues.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL, REVERSE  TWILIGHT

JUD reaches the top and starts down the far side. LOUIS reaches

the top.

EXT.  LOUIS

EXT.  BIG GOD WOODS, LOUIS'S POV

In the dying glow of twilight, this should be a mystic, awe-

inspiring shot. There's no more scrub underbrush and junk pines

and juniper-bracken here; ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias.

The sunset light shafts among them. This is a real forest... an

old forest. And winding upward among the trees along that needle-

carpeted floor, clearly marked by large white stones, the path

goes on.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's stopped on top of the deadfall, still surveying all this with

frank amazement.

EXT.  JUD

EXT.  LOUIS, ATOP THE DEADFALL

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

One of the branches snaps. LOUIS'S foot plunges. His cuff rips.

EXT.  LOUIS, JUD'S POV

We're looking up at a fairly steep angle as LOUIS staggers off-

balance. He steps with his other foot, misses, and goes flying.

EXT.  LOUIS, CLOSER

He does a half-somersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his

back, the green garbage bag flying out of his hand. His flashlight

also goes. Branches crack. White dust puffs out from under him.

EXT.  JUD, AT THE BASE OF THE DEADFALL

LOUIS thumps to the ground nearby. JUD kneels beside him.

LOUIS sits up groggily. His pants are torn. His sweatshirt is

torn. His ankle is bleeding.

LOUIS gets slowly up and retrieves the bag, which is rather

shredded now--and we can see catfur through some of the rents.

He whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the

light comes on. Satisfied, he shuts it off.

He starts off up the path. After a moment LOUIS follows, carrying

the bag.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, FROM THE DEADFALL

Again, there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go

tolling up the path into the twilight, dwarfed by those ancient

firs.

SOUND OF CRICKETS, LOW at first, then UP TO LOUD: Ree-ree-ree...

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP  TWILIGHT

Lots of undergrowth here, and creeping ground-mist, too. The SOUND

OF CRICKETS is now only a part of the soundtrack: BUZZ OF CICADAS,

THUMP OF FROGS. Swamp-sounds.

LOUIS looks frankly doubtful.

EXT.  LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S AND JUD'S POV  DEEP TWILIGHT

Mysterious...awesome...scary. Dead trees poke out of the murk like

twisted hands. There's scummy water standing around tussocks

covered with long grass, most of it dead. There's a lot of choking

underbrush.

All of this fades away into a grim, obscuring fog.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

JUD looks at him expressionlessly.

JUD starts off, stepping to the first tussock. After a moment,

LOUIS follows.

EXT.  JUD, CU

His face is set, strange.

EXT.  LOUIS, BEHIND JUD

EXT.  JUD

EXT.  LOUIS

HE looks up and his eyes widen as he sees:

EXT.  ANGLE ON LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV

A faintly glowing, ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of

the dead trees. It looks a bit like a corpse. In fact, I think it

looks quite a bit like PASCOW'S corpse.

As we watch it fades...fades...is gone.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being

scared. Now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the

surface of the standing water toward him...and then just fades

into the thick mist.

EXT.  JUD

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, LONG ANGLE  NIGHT

We see them moving through the mist like wraiths, JUD with his

digging tools, LOUIS with his light and his Hefty-Bag coffin. The

whole swamp is glowing dimly.

EXT.  THE FAR SIDE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP  NIGHT

In the extreme f.g. we can see firm ground sloping up. Ahead is a

thick white mist. And here comes JUD and LOUIS slogging through it

and out of it. Both of them are wet from the knees down. They head

into the woods on the far side.

EXT.  A LOW, STONY BLUFF OR STEEP HILL

In the book this is described as being almost a cliff, but a rocky

hill rising out of the woods would serve just as well. We can see

steps cut into the side, and two figures--LOUIS and JUD--toiling

up them.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT

JUD'S panting and out of breath; LOUIS is, if anything, in worse

shape.

He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars,

the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments

later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS AND JUD'S POV

The top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a

number of rocky piles. But for every pile of rocks we can see,

there are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst

apart. There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the

Pet Sematary: concentric circles.

SOUND: The wind, blowing ceaselessly.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND

He hands him the pick and shovel.

JUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand

and the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out

into the burying ground.

EXT.  LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE  NIGHT

SOUND: The wind. It blows ceaselessly up here.

The hole's about two and a half feet deep. Stubby rocks protrude

from the sides. The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom,

and flashes fire.

EXT.  LOUIS

He drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits. Beside

him we see a low pile of rocks and earth.

He joins LOUIS. He's got a lot of rocks in his arms.

He notices the rocks.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS'S POV

Those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, BY CHURCH'S GRAVE

He walks off again.

LOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE GARBAGE BAG

He opens it and looks in at CHURCH'S stiffening corpse.

He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then

begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade.

EXT.  THE CAIRN, CU  NIGHT

LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and add a final two or three

stones.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE CAIRN

He looks at it for a moment and stands up. JUD is right there.

LOUIS looks at him.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT

There's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all. There's silence

at first, and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING.

EXT.  LOUIS'S FIELD  NIGHT

LOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their

lights. They are both clearly fagged out.

SOUND, FAINT: The telephone.

He drops the tools and sprints.

EXT.  THE CREED'S SIDE YARD, BY THE TIRE SWING

LOUIS runs into the side yard. SOUND of the phone is louder.

EXT.  THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS

He runs to the door and inside.

EXT.  THE END OF THE PATH, WITH JUD

He stands there, eyes inscrutable.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE

It stops. A beat later LOUIS enters the room. He picks it up,

although he already knows it's too late. He listens to the SOUND

of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle,

disgusted.

He starts to dial a number from memory.

INT.  THE KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH JUD

INT.  LOUIS, BY THE PHONE

After a moment he lowers it into the cradle.

INT.  JUD

During this, he's come across the room to LOUIS and dropped his

hand on LOUIS'S shoulder.

EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH JUD

SOUNDS: Boops and beeps of a touch-tone telephone. Ringing. Then:

During this, another SOUND has been growing: an approaching truck.

As JUD gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear

on his face--no matter what he said to LOUIS, he's sorry for

tonight's piece of work.

A moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between THE CAMERA

and JUD.

INT.  LOUIS, IN THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

He's on the phone, smiling and happy.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE

She's dressed for bed, in fuzzy pink pajamas. Her Chatty Cathy is

crooked in one arm. In her lap is a Garfield transistor radio.

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

The smile fades off his face. It's replaced with a look of

combined guilt and unhappiness. He's looking at his hands, which

are still dark with the dirt from CHURCH'S grave.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE

RACHEL, holding GAGE, sits on the arm of ELLIE'S chair.

Before he can answer, she puts the phone in GAGE'S hand. ELLIE and

RACHEL watch, amused, as GAGE gobbles into it. Perhaps RACHEL

encourages him to say a few words.

INT.  THE CREED LVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

From the telephone comes the sound of GAGE talking and chortling.

LOUIS is not listening. His eyes--and his mind--are far away.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING

LOUIS is raking leaves on the side lawn, near the tree with the

tire swing. After a moment or two of this he props the rake

against the tree and starts toward the garage. He goes in.

EXT.  THE GARAGE, WITH LOUIS

It's dim in here. LOUIS is crossing to the door which communicates

to the kitchen. As he passes the station wagon, he hears a cat

HISS. He turns.

INT.  CHURCH, ECU

He's on top of the car, but at this point we probably don't

notice; THE CAMERA is so close that CHURCH looks like he's coming

right down our throats. He's hissing angrily.

INT.  LOUIS

He recoils and stumbles backward with a cry. He hits a tool-rack

on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a LOUD JANGLING

NOISE.

INT.  ON TOP OF THE STATION WAGON, WITH CHURCH

He jumps down, frightened by the noise, and the CAMERA TRACKS as

he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight.

INT.  LOUIS

He gets slowly to his feet again. He's getting over his fright but

we can see he's totally freaked out by what gave him that fright.

He goes to the garage door and looks out.

EXT.  THE SIDE YARD, LOUIS'S POV

Grass and fallen leaves. No sign of CHURCH.

EXT.  LOUIS'S STUNNED FACE, CU

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

He's spooning cat-food into a dish. He goes to the door--there

should be a total of three doors in the kitchen: one to the living

room, one to the shed/garage, and one which leads directly

outside. LOUIS uses this latter door now.

EXT.  THE KITCHEN STOOP, WITH LOUIS

He puts the dish of food down and sits beside it.

SOUND: Miaow.

EXT.  THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, LOUIS'S POV

CHURCH comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward

THE CAMERA. He stops, looking mistrustful.

EXT.  LOUIS

EXT.  CHURCH

He crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food.

He picks CHURCH up. CHURCH miaows again--he wants the food.

CHURCH is looking at the food, trying to get out of LOUIS'S arms.

He tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at CHURCH'S

neck.

EXT.  CHURCH'S NECK, CU (LOUIS'S POV)

There's some sort of mark here--a clear remnant	of the crash. A

line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all

grows.

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, ON THE STOOP

LOUIS sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go. He tweezes

something out of CHURCH'S whiskers.

EXT.  LOUIS'S HAND, ECU

It's a shred of green plastic.

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH

CHURCH suddenly claws at his face.

He claps his hand to his face. CHURCH leaps for the food. LOUIS

slowly takes his hand away. There are claw marks on his cheek,

welling blood. He looks at the cat.

EXT.  JUD CRANDALL'S GARDEN, WITH JUD

The garden is a plot of about half an acre. JUD comes trundling

slowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow. There are several

pumpkins in it. JUD is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a

Ramones sweatshirt. He's wearing his headphones and we can hear

the Romantics doing "What I Like About You." JUD is singing along

and bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow, if you

can dig it.

He sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it.

He takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine. He gets

the pumpkin in his arms and stands up. He turns...and LOUIS is

right there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking

totally stunned.

JUD, startled, drops the pumpkin. LOUIS reaches out and slides the

phones off JUD'S ears.

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN

LOUIS is sitting at the kitchen table. JUD is at the fridge. JUD

comes back with a couple of long-necked bottles of beer and opens

them.

LOUIS drinks about half the beer.

LOUIS drains his beer.

He gets up and goes to the fridge.

INT.  JUD, AT THE FRIDGE

He returns to the table with the beer.

JUD pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts.

JUD shrugs, and drinks.

EXT.  JUD AS A BOY, CU/SEPIA TONE  DAY

The time here is about 1910. JUD is wearing short pants. He's

crying, not in any big-deal histrionic way, but as if he means to

keep doing it for a long time. I mean he looks really sad.

JUD is sitting on the front stoop. It's the same house JUD lives

in now, but the porch hasn't been added yet, and the road is dirt

rather than tar.

Along this road comes a horse-drawn wagon--STANNY B.'S wagon. The

wagon's full of junk, rags, bottles...stuff to sell and swap.

Strung across the top are bells, and we can hear their CHIMING

SOUND...but faint, like bells heard in a dream.

STANNY B. is old and drunk. Dust spumes up behind the wagon as he

draws up to the CRANDALL house and stops. He gets down, almost

falls, takes a bottle out of his back pocket, drinks, and

approaches JUD. We can see him speaking.

INT.  JUD'S KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS

EXT.  THE CRANDALL BACK YARD/SEPIA TONE  DAY

JUD'S MOTHER is back to THE CAMERA, hanging sheets on the line.

The sheets billow. And suddenly, pushing out from behind them,

quite near her, is a small mongrel dog. SPOT. He's covered with

graveyard dirt. His eyes are red and rolling. He splashes the

sheets with the muck of his passage.

She sees who it is--what it is--and backs away, screaming,

horrified.

EXT.  SPOT, CLOSER/SEPIA

And so we can, around his neck and along the side of his head.

These marks are the counterpart of the marks we've already seen on

CHURCH.

SOUND of JUD'S MOM SCREAMING. Like the bells, these are screams

heard in a dream.

EXT.  THE BACK STOOP OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE/SEPIA

The BOY JUD comes running out, dressed in a night-shirt.

EXT.  JUD'S MOM/SEPIA (JUD'S POV)

She's cringing against the fence at the rear of the yard. SPOT

stands in front of her, swaying from side to side, as if doped.

She is in utter terror.

EXT.  THE BOY JUD/SEPIA

Horrified...ashamed.

EXT.  JUD'S MOM/SEPIA

INT.  JUD AND LOUIS, IN JUD'S KITCHEN

JUD'S face is a complication. He's lying to LOUIS, certainly--but

is he also lying to himself? Yes, I think so.

EXT.  THE ROAD BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

We see them crossing.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, ON THE CREED FRONT LAWN

But LOUIS'S reaction tells him he's not wrong--in fact, JUD has

hit the nail right on the head.

INT.  BATHTUB FIXTURES, CU

LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and turn the spigots.

INT.  THE BATHROOM, WITH LOUIS

He starts to undress, still looking troubled. We should notice

that the door behind him is firmly shut. The bathroom has no

windows.

INT.  THE BATHTUB SPIGOTS

The hot water is steaming. LOUIS'S hands enter the frame and turn

off the faucets. SOUND of LOUIS climbing in.

INT.  LOUIS IN THE TUB

A big sigh and an expression of exquisite pleasure. He relaxes in

the hot water. After a few moments he puts a wet washcloth over

his face.

INT.  BY THE KITCHEN SINK, WITH RACHEL

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE

GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE is at her place, crying. In

RACHEL'S place sits VICTOR PASCOW, bloody and wrecked. LOUIS sits

in his place. On the platter of bacon and scrambled eggs is

CHURCH'S mangled body.

INT.  THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS

The washrag is slipping, but it still covers his face.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE

In attendance: PASCOW, LOUIS, ELLIE, GAGE in his high chair. Lying

in the middle of the table, clotted with dirt and blood, eyes

staring, neck a gory mess of infected wounds, is SPOT. He's also

dotted with clots of scrambled egg and bits of bacon.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN SINK

INT.  THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS

The washcloth has slipped enough so we can see his eyes are

closed--he's dozing.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE

To LOUIS, ELLIE, PASCOW, GAGE, and the corpse of SPOT enters JUD,

his eyes shocked and staring.

INT.  LOUIS, IN THE BATHTUB, CU

The washrag has worked its way down to his mouth by now. His doze

is deepening; he's started to snore a little.

SOUND: A splash. Something has been dropped into the bath.

LOUIS opens his eyes. Looks puzzled. Looks down. Eyes widen in

shock.

INT.  THE BATHWATER, LOUIS'S POV

A very large and very mangled dead rat floats in the bath,

actually brushing against LOUIS'S chest. Blood has begun to stain

the water.

INT.  LOUIS

Turns his head, preparatory to leaping out.

INT.  THE TOILET LID, WITH CHURCH

Its mouth yawns open. It hisses, showing bloodstained teeth.

INT.  THE BATHROOM

LOUIS leaps from the tub. Grabs a towel and begins to rub himself

frantically. He's grossed out. The cat tries to arch against him

and he hits it. CHURCH falls to the floor, hissing.

LOUIS looks at the closed door.

He may not know that, but he knows how it's going to get out. He

opens the door to the upstairs hall. If CHURCH doesn't go at once,

LOUIS helps it with his foot.

Then he looks down at:

INT.  THE BATHTUB WITH BRER RAT, LOUIS'S POV

INT.  LOUIS

Staring at the rat. Over this: THE SOUND OF JET ENGINES.

EXT.  A DELTA 727

Its landing gear unfolds preparatory to touching down at Bangor

International Airport.

INT.  A DEPLANING AREA  DAY

Lots of people making their way up the jetway.

INT.  LOUIS, OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT

He's looking anxiously for his people. In one hand he's got half a

dozen roses. His face lights up.

INT.  THE DEPLANING AREA, LOUIS'S POV

Here comes LOUIS'S family. ELLIE is a little ahead. RACHEL is

pushing GAGE in his stroller. ELLIE sees LOUIS and lights up.

She runs for him.

INT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT

ELLIE comes belting up to LOUIS, weaving among the deplanees like

a slalom skier. She leaps into his arms. LOUIS swings her

cheerfully.

She smacks him noisily. He smacks her back just as noisily.

LOUIS'S face changes. All at once he's watchful.

RACHEL reaches them. She's pretty tired. Hair hanging in her face,

good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit

stale.

LOUIS does. GAGE is ecstatic.

LOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, NIGHT

CHURCH at the door, waiting to be let out. ELLIE does the honors.

CHURCH oils out into the shed/garage. ELLIE closes the door. She

looks distressed. She crosses the kitchen again.

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

RACHEL, in a flannel nightgown, is watching TV. LOUIS is reading a

medical tome and making notes. GAGE, zipped into a warm blanket

suit, is sacking on the couch.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

He looks both grim and sad--a man discovering that what you pay

for you own, and what you own always comes home to you.

BLACK. And on it, a fourth title card: MISSY DANDRIDGE.

SOUND: A pen scratching over paper.

INT.  A STUDY DESK, CU

A single sheet of lined paper is spotlighted by the glow of the

desk-lamp. On it, MISSY'S right hand is just finishing: "Dr. says

Intestinal Cancer. Cannot face this Pain. Sorry."

The hand puts the pen down. It tears the paper in two, leaving

just the half with the message.

INT.  THE DANDRIDGE CELLAR, NIGHT

A light comes on and we see a hangman's noose strung over a beam.

It dangles above a kitchen table which has been relegated to

cellar duty.

SOUND: Descending footsteps.

INT.  THE NOOSE, CU

SOUND of MISSY climbing onto the table.

Her face enters the frame. She looks very sick. She puts her head

into the noose and rakes it tight at the hyoid bone.

EXT.  THE DANDRIDGE HOUSE, NIGHT

One light on...a cellar light.

SOUND: Ree-ree-ree...then...

SOUND: Kick! THUMP!

SOUND: Ree-ree-ree...

INT.  THE CELLAR, WITH MISSY DANDRIDGE

She hangs limply, hands dangling at her sides, above the table,

which now lies upon its side. We can see the note clearly. She

pinned it to the bodice of her housedress.

SOUND: Car engines starting up.

EXT.  IN FRONT OF THE GRACE METHODIST CHURCH  DAY

People are coming out and getting into their cars and turning on

the headlights, even though it is only mid-morning.

In the immediate f.g. is a hearse. Four pallbearers are loading a

coffin into it.

EXT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE, ON THE CHURCH STEPS

JUD, dressed in a rusty old black suit and a black tie, comes out

and stands with them. He looks haggard and old.

EXT.  THE CHURCH PARKING AREA

More cars start up; more lights come on; the back doors of the

hearse swing closed.

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETARY  DAY

[NOTE: In the book LOUIS finds it difficult to enter at night

because of a high iron fence. Here we should see there's no such

problem; there's only a low stone wall between the graveyard and

the public road.]

The mourners are of course gathered around the grave of MISSY

DANDRIDGE. The coffin rests above it on runners.

EXT.  LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD

As the mourners begin to break up, these three start back toward

LOUIS'S car.

They've reached the CREED station wagon.

He opens the front passenger door.

She does, and LOUIS closes the door.

JUD opens one of the back doors as LOUIS goes around to the

driver's side.

INT.  THE BACK SEAT OF THE WAGON

JUD has tilted over in one corner and is snoring. His Walkman

'phones are on and we can hear the tinny sounds of Billy Idol. A

little old man's drool trickles down from one corner of his mouth.

SOUND: ELLENINT.  THE FRONT OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE

Tears are spilling freely down ELLIE'S face.

She cries harder. LOUIS reaches out and strokes her hair.

EXT.  THE STATION WAGON, DAY

Moving up the country road toward home through blazing fall

foliage.

INT.  TV SCREEN, CU  NIGHT

On it is a scene from "Night of the Living Dead."

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

There's a VCR on top of the TV; LOUIS has been watching "Night."

Now he quickly uses the remote control to shut down the TV.

She's dressed for bed, and comes toward him slowly.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL

She's putting away the last of the supper things. She hears this

and moves toward the living room door to listen. She doesn't look

at all well. Her eyes are red from crying and her face is haggard.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE

She's gotten up into his lap.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE DOOR

She smiles a little at this.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE, IN THE LIVING ROOM

LOUIS looks toward:

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM SOFA, WITH CHURCH, LOUIS'S POV

CHURCH is sleeping.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN DOOR

Listening intently.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

ELLIE'S giggling.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE DOOR

She's smiling, too...but tears are running down her cheeks.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

He gets her off his lap.

She heads toward the stairs.

INT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM

LOUIS is in bed, reading. RACHEL, wearing a robe over her

nightgown, comes in.

LOUIS puts his book down and looks at her thoughtfully.

RACHEL sits down on the end of the bed. She's clasping her hands

nervously together.

LOUIS sits up and scoots down the bed to her. He tries to put an

arm around her. She rejects it--but gently.

He makes a place for her beside him and hugs her. They lie

silently together for awhile, taking comfort from each other.

BLACK. And on it, a fifth title card: GAGE.

SOUND: An idling truck motor.

EXT.  THE GRILLE OF A TRUCK  DAY

It looks monstrous...as high as a mountain.

EXT.  THE TRUCK, A NEW ANGLE

It's an Orinco tanker. The driver, a young man in khaki fatigues

and a baseball cap, climbs up into the cab. He slams the door and

jams the truck into gear.

EXT.  THE ORINCO SHIPPING YARD  DAY

The truck comes rolling slowly toward the main gate...stops so the

driver can look both ways...and then pulls slowly out onto ROUTE

9.

INT.  A FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN GOLDMAN AND LOUIS  DAY

There are others here, but they are in the b.g., and concentrating

on the scene the old man is making. He's RACHEL'S dad. LOUIS is

sitting in the aisle seat of a pew-like bench. He looks terribly

shattered--they both do, actually. He's staring at the old man as

if he cannot in the least comprehend what he's saying.

He gestures toward:

INT.  THE FRONT OF THE FUNERAL CHAPEL  DAY

Here, half-buried in floral tributes, is a child-sized coffin.

GAGE'S.

INT.  IRWIN AND LOUIS  DAY

EXT.  ROUTE 9, W/TRUCK  DAY

Getting up to speed.

EXT.  A KITE, CU

There's a hand holding it--LOUIS'S. The kite begins to move and

THE CAMERA TRACKS IT. It flaps and flutters.

EXT.  THE FIELD BESIDE THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS

He runs with the kite beneath a gorgeous fall sky in which fat

clouds move like airy ocean liners.

EXT.  A PICNIC TABLE  DAY

The remains of a picnic lunch are spread here. Looks like everyone

ate well. In attendance: RACHEL, ELLIE, GAGE, and JUD CRANDALL.

They all laugh--JUD ruffles the kid's hair.

EXT.  LOUIS, RUNNING WITH THE KITE

He's paying out string--and the kite is going up.

INT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN

IRWIN looks toward:

INT.  THE BACK OF THE CHAPEL, WITH RACHEL AND DORY GOLDMAN

They are by the sign-in book. Both are dressed in black. Both look

haggard. But RACHEL looks more than haggard; she looks damned near

insane with grief and horror.

INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN

We should; by now he's screaming his head off.

INT.  THE CAB OF THE ORINCO TRUCK  DAY

The driver is whistling. A transistor radio hangs from the rear-

view mirror on a strap. He turns it on. The Ramones. "Sheena."

Hey-ho, let's go.

EXT.  ROUTE 9, TRUCKER'S POV

Unrolling before us at a good clip--too good, maybe.

INT.  THE TUCKER'S FOOT

Stamping the pedal closer to the metal.

EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK

Belting toward THE CAMERA. SOUND of the GROWLING ENGINE.

EXT.  THE SKY, WITH THE KITE

LOUIS has clearly gotten it up okay.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN THE FIELD

He's holding the string, looking up at the sky. Now he looks back

at the picnic table.

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

GAGE gets down and runs toward his father.

EXT.  ROUTE 9 WITH THE ORINCO TANKER

Belting along fast. SOUND of the Ramones.

EXT.  THE FIELD, WITH LOUIS AND GAGE

GAGE runs to his dad, chubby legs working. He reaches him, and

LOUIS transfers thee ball of string to GAGE'S hands.

LOUIS puts his hands over GAGE'S hands and pulls them down.

EXT.  THE KITE

It dips in the sky.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE

He kisses his son. They look up at:

EXT.  THE KITE

Dipping and drifting in that gorgeous fall sky.

INT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN

But there is no way he can express his outrage with mere words. As

LOUIS sits staring numbly up at him, IRWIN punches him in the

nose. LOUIS sprawls backward, falling out of the pew onto the

floor.

INT.  THE REAR OF THE CHAPEL, FEATURING RACHEL AND DORY

RACHEL screams and starts forward. DORY pulls her back.

INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN

LOUIS is getting up groggily. Hs nose is pouring blood.

IRWIN punches him in the stomach. LOUIS "oofs" and doubles over.

INT.  ANGLE ON THE OTHER MOURNERS

Among them we see STEVE MASTERTON and MARCY CHARLTON.

INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN

LOUIS is slowly straightening up. IRWIN is in a sour frenzy of

glee.

LOUIS pushes the old man with both hands.

INT.  IRWIN GOLDMAN

He goes stumbling and flailing backwards...strikes the coffin...

knocks it off its bier. A SCREAM goes up from the mourners.

INT.  RACHEL AND DORY

RACHEL screams. Her mother struggles to hold her but RACHEL easily

breaks free and goes running down the aisle.

INT.  ANGLE ON MOURNERS, WITH MARCY AND STEVE

STEVE gets up and goes toward:

INT.  THE FRONT OF THE CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN

He's picking himself out of a tangled mess of coffin and

overturned floral tributes. His suit is wet from spilled water.

He's weeping.

LOUIS has just reached him, and that stunned look is gone. I think

he intends to do the Cool Jerk all over IRWIN GOLDMAN'S puny

little body. IRWIN strikes a Gentleman Jim Corbett pugilistic

pose.

As LOUIS wades in, STEVE MASTERTON gets between them...at the last

possible moment.

LOUIS swings. STEVE manages to block the punch with his body.

That gets to LOUIS. He drops his fists. That stunned expression

creeps over his face again--that look that says he doesn't have

the slightest clue as to what's going on or how it could possibly

have happened.

INT.  LOUIS

LOUIS turns toward:

INT.  THE FRONT PEW, WITH PASCOW AND CHURCH

PASCOW, bloody and ruined in his jogging shorts and muscle shirt,

has the pew to himself...except for CHURCH, who is sitting on his

lap and PURRING.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

A sense of horrible awareness comes into his face...and then he

covers it with his hands and begins to SOB.

SOUND, COMING UP: A TRUCK MOTOR.

INT.  THE CAB OF THE TANKER

The trucker is singing along with the radio.

INT.  THE GAS PEDAL

It's closer to the floorboards than ever.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE WITH THE KITE, IN THE FIELD

We are at some distance--far enough to see that the two of them

have moved quite close to the road.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE, A NEW ANGLE (KITE'S POV)

We can see their faces upturned to us--we can hear the AMPLIFIED

RATTLING SOUND of the kite itself.

THE CAMERA PANS TO THE LEFT--to the road. And we can see the

truck, fairly close by now, and coming closer.

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE, WITH RACHEL, ELLIE, AND JUD

JUD'S lighting a cigarette. His Walkman 'phones are around his

neck.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE

This is the last moment of happiness in this man's life--so let's

make it very happy. As he and GAGE stare up at the kite:

INT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL

The fight has gone out of IRWIN and STEVE has backed away--but

cautiously. He's ready to jump back in if one or the other goes

mad again. But IRWIN is shuffling toward LOUIS, hands out--

everyone else has gathered in a knot near the front of the chapel.

Among them is RACHEL and her mother, weeping in each others' arms.

LOUIS brushes by him with no acknowledgement that IRWIN even

exists. He kneels down slowly by the coffin and puts his head

against it.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE, IN THE FIELD

There's a strong gust of wind. The ball of string falls out of

GAGE'S hand.

EXT.  THE KITE, BLOWING AWAY

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

EXT.  THE BALL OF KITE TWINE

It is bouncing and unraveling. More importantly, it is being

carried directly toward the highway.

EXT.  GAGE

He takes off after the ball of twine.

SOUND: The oncoming truck.

EXT.  THE TRUCK

Slamming toward us--a brutal leviathan on eighteen wheels.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's looking--looking toward his people at the picnic table.

TRUCK SOUND CONTINUES.

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

TRUCK SOUND LOUDER.

Alarm hits JUD'S face. He rises.

RACHEL looks; registers terrible alarm.

EXT.  GAGE

He's still scampering after the bouncing ball of kite-twine, which

has now almost reached the road.

TRUCK SOUND LOUDER.

EXT.  LOUIS

The SOUND is loud enough so he's having trouble hearing.

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

JUD is running toward the road, although he'll never get to GAGE

in time; only LOUIS has a chance.

EXT.  LOUIS

Horrible understanding dawns on his face. He whips around and

sees:

EXT.  GAGE, LOUIS'S POV

The kid's almost in the road; the ball of twine is in it.

RISING DRONE OF THE TRUCK.

EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK

EXT.  GAGE, RUNNING INTO THE ROAD

EXT.  EVERYONE, KITE'S POV

GAGE reaches the middle of the road as the truck comes around the

corner. LOUIS is running across the field, getting close to the

side of the road. RACHEL is clutching ELLIE by the picnic table.

JUD is helplessly trying to wave the truck down as it passes him.

EXT.  GAGE, IN THE ROAD

As he reaches the broken white line he grabs the ball of string.

SOUND OF THE ONCOMING TRUCK.

GAGE turns his head.

EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK AND THE DRIVER, GAGE'S POV

Suddenly THE DRIVER'S face turns into a Halloween mask of horror.

He BLASTS THE AIR-HORN.

EXT.  LOUIS, ON THE VERGE OF THE ROAD

EXT.  GAGE

BLARE OF THE AIR-HORN. A shadow falls over his face. There is an

audible CLICK! and we FREEZE FRAME. What we have now is a tremen-

dously winning photograph of a little boy, not quite two, with a

ball of string in his hand...and a shadow lying across his face.

EXT.  PHOTO MONTAGE

a.) LOUIS is pushing RACHEL out of a hospital door. RACHEL is in a

wheelchair and looks radiantly happy (so, for that matter, does

LOUIS). I think we may safely assume that the small blanketed

bundle in RACHEL'S arms is GAGE.

b.) LOUIS, bare to the waist, is tubbing a two-month-old GAGE in a

baby-tub. He's laughing. The infant looks confused but calm.

c.) The whole family by the Christmas tree, following an orgy of

present-opening. ELLIE, about five, has a doll in each hand. LOUIS

and RACHEL are in pajamas. GAGE, about five months, is lying in a

drift of wrapping paper. He looks confused but calm.

d.) A child's sneaker lying in the road. It's splashed with blood.

e.) GAGE--he's about nine months old in this snap--is propped up

in the angle of a sofa. There's a big white rabbit in his lap.

GAGE looks c. but c.

f.) ELLIE and GAGE, bundled up against the Chicago winter. ELLIE

is pulling a child's chair-sled. GAGE is propped up in the chair.

He's about eleven months old in this snap. He's laughing.

g.) The Orinco tanker, overturned on the far side of Route 9.

h.) This one was taken at Gage's first birthday party. He's

wearing a party-hat and looking at a birthday cake with a single

candle on it while LOUIS kisses one cheek and RACHEL kisses the

other.

i.) LOUIS, in the road. He's holding GAGE'S jumper, which is torn,

blood-soaked, and inside out. LOUIS is looking up toward the sky

and screaming.

j.) Here is a full-face studio portrait of GAGE. He is smiling at

us, heartbreakingly lovely. CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS while:

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH LOUIS

He's holding the studio portrait in his hands and looking at it

fixedly. The other photos (the good ones, that is; not the

screamers--those, we may assume, exist only in LOUIS'S tortured

memory) are scattered on the table. We only saw a few; there are

actually hundreds.

LOUIS puts the photo down as JUD comes in and crosses to the

fridge. LOUIS'S nose is badly swelled. He also has a black eye.

JUD gets a couple of beers and comes back toward the table.

The swing door opens. They look toward:

INT.  ELLIE

She looks dazed and shocked. There are brown circles under her

eyes, but otherwise her complexion is much too white. She's

wearing fuzzy pj's. She's carrying the picture of her pulling GAGE

on the sled.

INT.  JUD AND LOUIS, AT THE TABLE

At first she doesn't want to show him, but JUD is very kind.

ELLIE nods. She is starting to cry. JUD is also leaking at the

eyes.

LOUIS, looking down at his hands, nods.

JUD reacts violently. And LOUIS looks up, dully curious...but

hasn't the thought already passed through LOUIS'S mind? Yes--I

think it has.

She bursts into tears.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

His face is stricken.

INT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

LOUIS comes in with ELLIE in his arms. He puts her gently into her

bed and pulls the covers up. She's already mostly asleep.

He starts for the door.

INT.  ELLIE, CU

INT.  LOUIS, AT THE DOOR

He stands looking at her for a long time, apparently thinking

about this quite deeply.

He steps out, closing the door.

INT.  ELLIE, IN BED

In some sense comforted--it may be a poison comfort but she surely

doesn't know this--she turns over on her side to go to sleep. We

can see the picture of GAGE under her arm.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH LOUIS

The light here is fairly dim. LOUIS goes down and opens another

door. He pokes his head in.

INT.  THE MASTER BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

He reacts first with surprise, then a species of horrified

disgust.

INT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BED, LOUIS'S POV

CHURCH is crouched on RACHEL'S sleeping form.

INT.  THE BED, A NEW ANGLE

LOUIS comes in and swats the cat a damned good one.

INT.  CHURCH, CU

It hisses at him through a mouthful of fangs, its eyes big green

balls...and then it flees. CAMERA FOLLOWS IT out the door.

INT.  LOUIS, BY THE BED

RACHEL stirs and mutters thickly, then lies still again...she's

doped to the gills. LOUIS bends over and kisses her gently.

He leaves the room and closes the door behind him.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH LOUIS

He tries the door a couple of times to make sure it's firmly on

the latch (his face wears an expression of "How'd he get in there

in the first place?"). Then he walks down the hall to the stairs.

INT.  ON THE STAIRS, CU

The cat is on one of the risers. LOUIS trips over it.

EXT.  ON THE STAIRS WITH LOUIS, WIDER

For a moment he's pinwheeling madly for balance, on the verge of

falling. He regains his balance as the cat goes shooting across

the dining room toward the kitchen.

LOUIS regains his equilibrium after a bit and continues on down.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS AND CHURCH

As LOUIS enters through the swing door from the dining room, JUD

is just letting CHURCH out the back door. As JUD closes the door:

He indicates the table, where there is indeed a fresh beer.

But he begins pouring the beer into a glass.

LOUIS'S hand jerks. Beer goes foaming across the kitchen table.

As LOUIS goes to get a cloth to wipe up the mess:

LOUIS stops sopping and looks at him.

INT.  JUD, CU

EXT.  A COUNTRY RAILROAD STATION/SEPIA  DAY

The time is the late summer of 1944, although I don't believe we

need to know that specifically. The sign on the station reads

LUDLOW. There are a few 40s cars parked near the station--they

have gas-ration coupons on the windshields. And a hearse.

A train is coming.

EXT.  THE HEARSE, WITH UNDERTAKER AND BILL BATERMAN/SEPIA

We can see the UNDERTAKER is trying to talk to BILL BATERMAN, a

man in his forties who periodically wipes his brow with a bandana.

BILL walks away. He doesn't want to talk; he doesn't want comfort.

He's a grief-stricken, bitter man.

EXT.  THE TRAIN, IN FRONT OF THE DEPOT/SEPIA

The door of the mail-car is open. The UNDERTAKER and three

trainmen are unloading TIMMY BATERMAN'S coffin, which is draped in

a 48-star flag. BILL BATERMAN stands by, watching balefully as

they carry his son's final apartment to the back of the hearse and

load it in.

EXT.  THE REAR OF THE HEARSE/SEPIA

The doors close. The hearse pulls away. THE CAMERA PANS TO BILL

BATERMAN, who stands staring balefully after it and mopping his

brow.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD  NIGHT

LOUIS is now sitting down, drinking a beer, staring at JUD.

EXT.  THE LUDLOW CEMETARY/SEPIA  DUSK

We're featuring a fresh grave...that of TIMMY BATERMAN. A truck,

showing only parking lights, turns into the graveyard and drives

slowly up to it. It stops, and BILL BATERMAN gets out. HE looks at

the grave and then goes to the back of his truck.

EXT.  BILL BATERMAN AT THE BACK OF HIS TRUCK/SEPIA  DUSK

He reaches in...and brings out a pick and shovel.

EXT.  MARGIE WASHBURN, ON HER PORCH/SEPIA  DAY

She's a middle-aged woman dressed in mid-forties style. She's got

a rug-beater in one hand; the other is up to her eyes to shade the

sun. She's staring at something, horrified.

EXT.  A COUNTRY DIRT ROAD, WITH TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA  DAY

A young man dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt is shambling up the

road. His eyes are vacant. His shirt is half untucked. His hair is

sticking up in a wild crow's-nest thatch. There is an ugly mess of

healed scars on his neck and one side of his face. I think one of

his ears may be gone--torn off in the accident.

EXT.  MARGIE/SEPIA

She's screaming--we hear her faintly.

EXT.  TIMMY/SEPIA

He turns toward her and we see a green light like the St. Elmo's

fire in the Little God Swamp glow dimly deep in his eyes. He grins

at MARGIE.

EXT.  IN FRONT OF THE LUDLOW TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA

She hesitates for a moment or two and then walks up toward the

door.

INT.  THE TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA

She's in a hallway in front of a door with LUDLOW SELECTMEN

printed on the frosted glass. After a moment she opens it and goes

in.

INT.  THE SELECTMEN'S OFFICE/SEPIA

MARGIE and four men are grouped around a desk. She's talking;

they're listening. THE CAMERA LAZILY PANS the four men--one, of

course, is JUD as a YOUNG MAN.

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE/SEPIA  SUNSET

It's a ramshackle old farm which looks remarkably like the estate

of that gentleman farmer Jordy Verrill.

An old Ford pulls into the driveway, and the four men get out.

SOUND BLEEDS IN: Most of all the SOUND OF THE CRICKETS.

They go to the door, and JUD is wordlessly elected as the prime

honcho. He knocks. No answer. Again. No answer.

SOUND: Crazy laughter.

The four men look at each other.

They start around to the back.

EXT.  THE BACK YARD, WITH BILL AND TIMMY/SEPIA

TIMMY BATERMAN is staring directly into the setting sun, his eyes

glowing with green fire. He's laughing like Goofy gone insane.

BILL, scared, is trying to make him stop, to turn away from the

sun.

EXT.  THE BACK YARD, A NEW ANGLE/SEPIA

The four men come around the side of the house. They freeze when

they see BILL and TIMMY.

BILL whirls around and sees them.

Now TIMMY turns around and comes shambling forward.

EXT.  TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA

Abruptly he reaches up with both hands and scratches down his

cheeks, goring deep grooves in his flesh. Blood flows sluggishly

out. Very weird blood.

EXT.  THE ENTIRE GROUP/SEPIA

BILL grabs TIMMY, who's still laughing wildly, and gets him turned

around. TIMMY shambles back to where he was originally standing.

BILL goes with him like a man who has charge over a trained

baboon. A stupid trained baboon.

EXT.  THE FOUR MEN/SEPIA

EXT.  BILL AND TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA

EXT.  TIMMY BATERMAN, CU/SEPIA

Staring directly into the setting sun and laughing wildly,

mindlessly.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE--MONTAGE  NIGHT

a.) A car pulls up with its lights off and stops.

b.) We see legs as people get out of the car, and hands holding

tin cans of gasoline.

c.) Hands splash gasoline from the cans along the sides of the

house.

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PORCH  NIGHT

JUD (as a young man) rings the bell--an old-fashioned twist type.

He walks away. BILL BATERMAN, wearing a strappy tee-shirt, looks

out the window.

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE--MONTAGE  NIGHT

a.) A match is struck...and applied to wet boards. Whoosh!

b.) The other side of the house: The same.

c.) In the back yard, JUD lights a torch and heaves it through the

kitchen windows. Ka-PLOOM!

d.) The men draw away toward the front, their faces grim and

judgmental.

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE  NIGHT

Burning. Going up fast.

EXT.  THE MEN

EXT.  THE FRONT DOOR

It bursts open. We see two men struggling at the forefront of an

inferno--correction, one man and an undead monster. TIMMY is

giggling and screaming, trying to pull his father back into the

flames.

He sinks his teeth into his father's arm. BILL screams.

A beam falls on TIMMY, lighting him afire. BILL breaks free and

runs down the porch steps.

INT.  THE FRONT HALL, WITH TIMMY

He's burning and laughing.

And into the fire he goes, still shrieking and laughing.

EXT.  THE FRONT YARD  NIGHT

BILL BATERMAN is collapsed on the lawn as sparks drift down around

him, his face hidden against his thighs, weeping.

CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the four men, who are grouped at the end

of the driveway by the road and staring with awe at:

EXT.  THE BLAZING FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

BLACK. And on it, a sixth title card: THE DEAD WALK.

SOUND BLEEDS IN: JET ENGINES.

EXT.  BANGOR INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL  DAY

A jet plane rises into the sky from behind the building.

INT.  A BOARDING GATE, WITH LOUIS AND RACHEL

In the b.g. we can see IRWIN and DORY GOLDMAN waiting by the

jetway with ELLIE as the last few passengers board. RACHEL looks

confused and grief-stricken. She also looks punchy, doped up. I

imagine she's floating on a sea of Valium, and that makes her

easier to deal with. LOUIS'S battle-scars are fading a little.

The GATE AGENT is standing by the jetway with a mike in one hand

and a bunch of boarding passes in the other.

INT.  THE GOLDMANS, WITH ELLIE

DORY and IRWIN exchange a knowing, sad glance over the child's

head.

INT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS

LOUIS guides her to the jetway.

He kisses DORY. IRWIN hugs him.

LOUIS kisses RACHEL. Then he kneels and hugs ELLIE.

INT.  ELLIE, CU

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

The Voice of Authority has spoken. We can tell by ELLIE'S face

that while things are still not all right, they are a little

better. She joins her mother.

The four of them--RACHEL, ELLIE, and THE GOLDMANS--start down the

jetway. ELLIE looks back once, as if begging him to come...and

then they're gone.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

LOUIS'S face changes. Now it is a stony and contemplative face.

Not, when you get right down to it, a very nice face.

He turns and strides away.

INT.  THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT, WITH LOUIS

The family station wagon is in the f.g. We hear the SOUND OF JET

ENGINES, and as LOUIS reaches the wagon he turns and watches:

EXT.  THE TERMINAL,, LOUIS'S POV

From behind it a United Airlines jet lifts into view and banks

away.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN THE PARKING LOT

Face set, he gets into the wagon and drives away.

EXT.  ROUTE 15 IN BREWER

The CREEDmobile pulls up across from the Brewer Tru-Value Hardware

and LOUIS crosses to it.

INT.  THE HARDWARE STORE COUNTER, CU

On it: A six-cell flashlight, Duracell D-batteries, a pick, a

shovel, and a nylon drop-sheet in cellophane packaging. Now the

CLERK'S hands come into the frame and drop a pair of heavy work-

gloves into the pile.

INT.  LOUIS AND CLERK (SMALL PUN, HEE-HEE)

The CLERK starts to ring things up.

The quality of LOUIS'S reply is somehow unnatural. The CLERK looks

at him, momentarily unsure and uncertain. Then he starts ringing

things up again.

INT.  A UNITED JETLINER, WITH ELLIE AND RACHEL

ELLIE is in the window-seat, asleep. RACHEL is holding a paperback

but not reading it. Her eyes are red. She's looking into space.

CAMERA DRIFTS TO ELLIE. Her sleep is not easy. Her head turns from

side to side, as if in negation. She becomes steadily more upset.

She's starting to mutter. Suddenly her eyes flare open and she

screams.

INT.  JETLINER, SLIGHTLY WIDER

We can see the GOLDMANS in the seats behind the CREEDS. They are

startled. So are other passengers. A stewardess comes running.

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETARY  DAY

The CREED wagon turns in and drives up one of the lanes. It stops

and LOUIS gets out.

EXT.  LOUIS

He walks to a fresh grave on which the first flowers are already

starting to wilt. He sits down and takes a flower. He plucks it,

looking at the grave steadily. He says nothing for a long time.

EXT.  GAGE, IN THE FIELD

He runs toward THE CAMERA, happy and laughing, in SLOW MOTION.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

LOUIS is now weeping, but he seems calm just the same.

LOUIS looks at:

EXT.  A TOMB, LOUIS'S POV

PASCOW, bloody and mutilated, is standing by it.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

He is not put out of countenance in the slightest by PASCOW'S

appearance; he probably knows PASCOW is just a figment of his

conscience or imagination, and so do we.

EXT.  PASCOW

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

EXT.  PASCOW, BY THE TOMB

He stands mute, just looking.

EXT.  LOUIS

EXT.  THE TOMB, SANS PASCOW

VIC has put on his boogie shoes.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

He's crying harder. Abruptly he reaches out at the floral tributes

and knocks a bunch of them over.

EXT.  THE GOLDMAN HOUSE IN LAKE FOREST, ILLINOIS  NIGHT

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL  NIGHT

THE CAMERA MOVES LEISURELY along this hallway, which is lined with

pictures of RACHEL, ELLIE...and GAGE (there may even be a couple

in which LOUIS is featured, but damned few). Near the end of the

hall a door is open and light spills out.

THE CAMERA GOES THROUGH THE DOOR and into the room where ELLIE is

staying. She's in bed, still badly upset. RACHEL is sitting on the

bed beside her. There's a single lamp on the bedside table.

RACHEL turns off the bed-lamp.

She kisses ELLIE.

RACHEL gets up and leaves the room.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

PASCOW is here, halfway down the hall to the stairs, bloody as

ever. RACHEL doesn't see him. She looks perplexed, a woman trying

to think of something. She stops very near him.

RACHEL suddenly straightens. She looks startled and afraid.

She suddenly heads for the stairs, fast.

EXT.  THE CREED HOME IN LUDLOW  NIGHT

SOUND: A car starting up.

The station wagon backs out and heads down the driveway. As it

passes THE CAMERA, we see LOUIS driving. The wagon turns onto

Route 9 and heads off.

CAMERA HOLDS ON THE HOUSE. A beat of silence. Then: the telephone

starts ringing.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

IRWIN and DORY are watching RACHEL with some anxiety. RACHEL is

holding the phone to her ear. We can hear the FILTERED SOUND of

one ring after another. She hangs up.

Good old IRWIN'S face says that maybe LOUIS went out for a couple

of grams of coke and a whore in Nazi SS boots.

RACHEL is dialing another number.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT

SOUND: Phone starts to ring.

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

He shuffles to the telephone. His Walkman 'phones are around his

neck. He's got a bottle of beer in one hand.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

His face says this is very serious.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL

She hangs up.

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

The buzz of an open line. Connection broken. JUD slowly replaces

the receiver. The man looks very grim.

INT.  THE FRONT HALL OF THE GOLDMAN HOUSE

RACHEL comes down the stairs, dressed for travelling. She's

carrying a suitcase in one hand. Her parents meet her at the foot

of the stairs.

They all turn to:

INT.  ELLIE, ON THE STAIRS

INT.  RACHEL AND THE GOLDMANS

ELLIE races into her arms.

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETERY  NIGHT

SOUND Of a car engine, THROBBING AND LOW. It cuts off.

CAMERA MOVES IN on the low stone wall between the cemetery and the

road. Beyond it we can see the roof of the CREED station wagon.

LOUIS appears, dressed in dark clothes. He looks both ways, then

tosses a big duffle bag over the wall. Stuff clanks inside.

LOUIS climbs over the wall, grabs his bag, and checks out the

scene.

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETERY, LOUIS'S POV

A quiet city of the dead. Spooky. SOUND of crickets: Ree-ree-

ree...

EXT.  LOUIS

He heads for GAGE'S grave.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN CAR, WITH RACHEL AND IRWIN

EXT.  O'HARE UNITED AIRLINES TERMINAL, WITH IRWIN'S CAR

IRWIN'S car heads for it.

EXT.  THE GRAVE OF GAGE CREED

LOUIS approaches it slowly and sets down his bag of grave-robbing

equipment. He sets aside the remaining floral tributes and then

opens the bag and takes out the spade. He looks down at the grave

for a long second.

He starts to shovel.

EXT.  THE SHOVEL, CU

Digging...throwing...digging again. Already the shape of the

excavation is beginning to show. The work is easy; this earth is

new and fresh.

EXT.  JETLINER, IN A LINE-UP OF JETLINERS

INT.  JETLINER, WITH RACHEL

Everyone looks impatient, but RACHEL looks half crazy.

SOUND: Bing!

There's a general groan. CAMERA MOVES IN ON RACHEL, who has closed

her eyes. I think she's praying.

EXT.  GAGE'S GRAVE  NIGHT

Now it's pretty deep. Four feet, maybe. LOUIS is standing in it.

We see his feet as the shovel goes up and down, up and down.

EXT.  LOUIS  NIGHT

He's sweating and dirt-streaked. He's tossing dirt on a big pile.

Suddenly, as he takes another shovelful, we hear a SCRAPING SOUND.

He tosses the shovel aside and squats.

EXT.  IN THE GRAVE, WITH LOUIS

There's a white streak on the bottom of the grave--the top of

GAGE'S coffin. LOUIS swipes his hand through the loose dirt,

uncovering more, and then he begins to sweep off the top of the

coffin with his hands.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL PORCH

JUD comes out. He's wearing a light jacket. His Walkman 'phones

are around his neck. He's got a six-pack. He looks at:

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE, JUD'S POV

It's dark.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL PORCH, WITH JUD

He sits down.

He puts his earphones on. Cracks a beer. Lights a cigarette.

Pushes the PLAY button on the deck. Faint SOUNDS of The Clash

buzz-sawing "Rock The Casbah."

JUD begins to watch.

EXT.  LOUIS

He climbs out of the grave and opens his duffle bag. He starts to

pull out the pick.

SOUND of an approaching car.

LOUIS freezes.

EXT.  THE ROAD OUTSIDE OF THE CEMETERY

A police car comes cruising slowly along. The spotlight on the

driver's side comes on and runs along the graveyard's stone wall.

EXT.  LOUIS

Watching. Waiting. Hardly breathing.

EXT.  THE POLICE CAR

It reaches the end of the wall. Everything looks jake. The

spotlight goes out and the police car speeds up.

EXT.  LOUIS

He relaxes perceptibly. He gets the pick and drops back into the

grave.

EXT.  THE TOP OF THE COFFIN, CU

LOUIS inserts the tip of the pick in the flange of the coffin and

levers it. CRACKING SOUND. Again. More CRACKING. Again. And the

lock breaks. The coffin lid comes up a little, dirt gritting in

the hinges.

EXT.  LOUIS, CU

Here's a man on the thinnest edge between sanity and madness.

EXT.  JETLINER LIFTING OFF FROM O'HARE

INT.  RACHEL AND HER SEATMATE

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

He's lying on his stomach, reaching in. We hear the SOUND of dirt

grating in hinges again.

EXT.  LOUIS, CU

We're looking up into his face. If GAGE had a POV, this would be

it. LOUIS'S face fills with a terrible grief.

EXT.  JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH

His chin slips to his chest, even though we hear Creedence on his

'phones and to him the sound must be at blastoff levels. There's a

long round ash on his cigarette in the tray. A couple of empty

beer cans on the table beside him.

A truck blasts by, startling him out of his doze. He jerks his

head up suddenly...and slaps himself. He's okay...for now.

EXT.  THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS

He is sitting on the edge of the grave, holding his dead son in

his arms, rocking him. GAGE is back to us. We see only a small

limp figure in a dark suit. Hair flops limply.

The canvas tarp has been spread open to the right. LOUIS begins to

lay his son down on it.

EXT.  THE GROUND BESIDE THE TARP, CU

It's littered with flower petals. One limp hand appears among

them.

EXT.  LOUIS

He closes the tarp over GAGE, making a roll. He then produces rope

from the duffle bag. He cuts the rope and begins to tie one piece

around one end of the canvas roll containing the corpse of his

son.

EXT.  JETLINER IN THE NIGHT SKY

INT.  THE JETLINER, WITH RACHEL

Her seatmate is knitting something. Across the aisle sits VICTOR

PASCOW, bloody but serene, hands clasped in his lap, looking

straight ahead. RACHEL looks around tensely.

PASCOW clenches his fist in a "That's one for our side!" gesture.

Her SEATMATE looks at her a bit strangely.

EXT.  THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS

He's got the bundle containing his son and the duffle-bag with the

tools. He runs bent over. He reaches the wall and there's the

SOUND of another motor. He crouches at the base of the wall.

EXT.  THE ROAD

Here comes that same police car. The spotlight runs along the

wall.

EXT.  LOUIS

Crouching against his side of the wall and sweating.

EXT.  THE POLICE CAR

It stops. The COP gets out. He walks slowly toward the wall.

EXT.  LOUIS

Crouched. Now we see the COP looking over the top. If he looks

down...but he doesn't. Instead he turns around so we see his back.

LOUIS looks up, miserably scared, pouring sweat.

Silence. Then: SOUND of the cop taking a whiz.

EXT.  THE COP

Ah! Relief. SOUND of his fly being zipped. He looks back at the

cemetery for a moment.

He walks back to his cruiser, gets in, and hauls ass.

EXT.  LOUIS, BEHIND THE WALL

He collapses with relief. Then he gets up and looks cautiously

over the wall. Nothing there but his car, parked a little way down

on the other side of the road.

He tosses the duffle bag over the top of the wall. He puts the

canvas roll containing GAGE on top of the wall. Then he vaults

over.

EXT.  THE STREET SIDE OF THE WALL, WITH LOUIS

He takes the roll, gets the duffle bag hooked over his shoulder by

the string, and runs across the road like a soldier crossing enemy

territory. He goes to the rear of the wagon.

EXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS

He puts the body down. He feels in his pocket for his keys. No

keys. Mild consternation. He looks around, feeling exposed. The

other pocket. Still no keys. More consternation. He begins to hunt

feverishly through his pockets. Maybe in his jacket? Nope.

SOUND: An approaching car.

EXT.  PASSING CAR

A civilian--not the ubiquitous cop.

EXT.  LOUIS

He turns his pockets out, spilling change everywhere. Nothing.

Suddenly a little light goes on in his eyes. He goes to the

driver's side of the car and looks in at:

INT.  IGNITION, LOUIS'S POV

The keys are in the switch.

EXT.  LOUIS

He snatches the keys and returns to the back of the wagon. He uses

the key to open the doorgate. He puts GAGE'S body in gently, then

the duffle bag. He closes the doorgate and returns to the front of

the car. He opens the driver's door and freezes.

LOUIS returns to the rear, gets his keys from the doorgate, comes

back to the front, gets in, and drives away.

INT.  A JETWAY AT LOGAN INTERNATIONAL

People are debarking into the gate area. Through them comes

RACHEL, running fast, pushing some people, excusing herself

incoherently. PASCOW is walking near her.

Without looking at PASCOW, RACHEL takes off her shoes and runs.

INT.  THE CONCOURSE, WITH RACHEL

She's sprinting down the concourse--look out, Joanie Benoit!

INT.  GATE 27, WITH FEMALE GATE AGENT AND PASCOW

The FEMALE GATE AGENT is starting to close the jetway door.

The GATE AGENT looks puzzled, as if she just had a thought (or

maybe a gas pain). She stops closing the door. RACHEL runs into

the area. She sees:

INT./EXT.  THE JET PLANE, THROUGH THE GATE WINDOWS

It is just starting to swing ponderously away from the jetway.

INT.  RACHEL AND FEMALE GATE AGENT (PASCOW IS GONE)

RACHEL bolts down the jetway. The GATE AGENT stares after her, and

then runs for her stand, where we can see FLIGHT 61 and BANGOR on

the slide-cards. She picks up her mike.

EXT.  THE JETWAY  NIGHT

RACHEL stands all alone at the end of it.

AMPLIFIED SOUNDS OF JET ENGINES.

EXT.  THE JET, RACHEL'S POV

It starts to swing back to pick her up.

EXT.  RACHEL

PASCOW appears behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder.

EXT.  JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH

He's fast asleep with the tinny sound of Graham Parker coming out

of his Walkman 'phones.

SOUND: An approaching car.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE

The station wagon turns in and parks. LOUIS gets out. He opens the

back, removes the body in the tarp and the duffle bag filled with

tools. He manages to get everything together and walks to the edge

of the path. He looks at:

EXT.  THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV

Off it goes, glimmering in the dark.

EXT.  LOUIS

He holds the corpse of his little boy to him.

He sets off.

EXT.  JUD, ON HIS PORCH

Zonked out. He missed the whole thing. Nice going, Jud.

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE ARCH TO THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS

Louis passes under like a ghost.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS

LOUIS is crying. He crosses to the deadfall.

He begins to mount the deadfall.

EXT.  LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE

He reaches the top. And woven into the deadfall, behind him,

facing the Pet Sematary, is that snarling face.

LOUIS descends the other side.

EXT.  THE FOOT OF THE DEDFALL, WOODS SIDE

LOUIS reaches the bottom and looks at:

EXT.  THE WOODS, LOUIS'S POV

The path winds onward through those gigantic trees--it glows

slightly.

EXT.  LOUIS, MOVING UP THE PATH

EXT.  LOUIS, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP

That phosphorescent glow is a lot more pronounced. SOUNDS of

CRICKETS and FROGS. The water is mucky and still. Hummocks stick

up like knobs on the back of a creature best not seen. Fog drifts

through the dead trees. LOUIS doesn't want to go in there. Smart

man. I wouldn't either.

But he does.

INT.  THE HERTZ DESK, AT BIA WITH RACHEL AND CLERK--AND PASCOW

PASCOW is lounging back against the rack of folders--and getting

some of them bloody.

The CLERK starts looking through her papers.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP

He comes walking toward THE CAMERA with GAGE in his arms and the

duffle bag over his shoulder. Mist swirls around him. The

landscape is weird, surreal. CRICKET SOUNDS, AMPLIFIED. In fact

there are a lot of swampy, marshy SOUNDS--too many. It sounds

almost prehistoric.

SOUND: HARSH, SCREAMING LAUGHTER

LOUIS stops. He looks slowly around at:

EXT.  MIST-FACE, LOUIS'S POV

A demonic face takes shape in the mist and FLOATS SLOWLY TOWARD

THE CAMERA. It runs out a tongue that's about nine feet long.

Its eyes blow out. Blood and thick, gooey stuff runs from the

sockets.

EXT.  LOUIS

He closes his eyes. After a moment he opens them.

EXT.  LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV

Nothing there.

EXT.  LOUIS

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

We can barely see them because they are thick in mist, but he is

standing on a couple of low, marshy tussocks. Suddenly a thick

tentacle slimes its way out of the standing water and slithers

around his ankle.

EXT.  LOUIS, LOOKING DOWN

He turns around and begins to walk again.

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

The tentacle falls away.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP

MYRIAD SOUNDS, none of them pleasant--laughter, gobbling howls,

screams. Sounds like the swamp has been invaded by a pack of

escaped lunatics. LOUIS continues on regardless.

EXT.  WOODS

LOUIS comes into the frame. He's obviously tiring now, but he

keeps moving along.

SOUND: Approaching footsteps. Big ones. Thudding ones. Something

is coming which sounds approximately the size of a Tyrannosaurus

Rex. And it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder. LOUIS

looks plenty scared.

SOUND: A falling tree.

EXT.  WOODS, LOUIS'S POV

Those SOUNDS keep getting closer and closer. Another tree falls--

we see this one. And now we see a SHAPE--just a SHAPE.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's scared almost to death. His face turns up...up...up.

EXT.  THE WOODS--AND THE SHAPE, LOUIS'S POV

It is vaguely manlike: perhaps sixty feet tall, perhaps eighty. We

don't see it very well, nor do we have to--I'm not even sure it's

flesh and blood. But there is a clear suggestion of a head. Now it

turns and looks down...looks at LOUIS CREED. We see great yellow

eyes the size of lighthouse lamps.

It makes a huge GRUNTING SOUND...and then walks on.

EXT.  LOUIS

The SOUND OF FOOTFALLS is slowly diminishing.

Slowly he begins to walk again.

EXT.  LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE

In the extreme f.g. is a tree which has just fallen--it is no

small tree, either, but a great big old fir.

LOUIS approaches it. Stops. Looks at the tree. Looks down at:

EXT.  THE FOREST FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV

Here is a gigantic animal track--if it was full of water, LOUIS

could swim in it. It looks like no animal track we've ever seen

before. Three big claws at the end of it.

EXT.  LOUIS

Looks up again. His face is set and hard.

He starts to walk again.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND

SOUND: The wind, lonesome and keening.

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY toward the slope, dreaming its way over

those rocky cairns...most of them burst apart.

SOUND: Tortured breathing. Panting.

LOUIS toils his way into view, carrying his bundle. He reaches the

top. He makes his way slowly into the burying ground. He stumbles

over a rock. Falls down. Slowly gathers his things together and

gets up again. He goes a little further and then stops and looks

at:

EXT.  A BROKEN CAIRN AND THE GRAVE BENEATH, LOUIS'S POV

We can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag.

EXT.  LOUIS

He slowly kneels down. He puts the canvas tarp to one side and

slowly takes the pick and shovel from the duffle bag. By now he is

clearly a man approaching total exhaustion.

EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH AN ARIES K

It tracks past THE CAMERA.

INT.  THE ARIES K WITH RACHEL AND PASCOW

Both of them look tense. RACHEL is bolt upright behind the wheel.

Suddenly, BANG! as one of the tires blow.

EXT.  THE ARIES K

It goes skidding and slueing across the road, the rear tire half

off the rim. IT climbs the curb and hits a tree.

INT.  RACHEL

She lurches forward, but she's wearing her seat-belt--good girl!

She unbuckles it and gets out.

EXT.  RACHEL

She looks at the car, which now has quite a bit more wrong with it

than just a scratch up the side.

RACHEL slumps, near tears. LOUIS isn't the only one who's been

through a lot tonight.

PASCOW comes from around the tree as RACHEL walks to the road,

looking for cars, or something. He looks urgent and upset.

RACHEL looks around uncertainly...a little afraid. As she scans

the scene she looks at--and through--PASCOW.

After a moment of silence she turns back to the road. Lights

appear and brighten as a car approaches. RACHEL steps to the

shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb, surely for

the first time in her life.

The car sweeps by her without slowing.

EXT.  GAGE'S CAIRN, CU

LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it. THE

CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see him surveying his work. Beside him is

the canvas tarp, now open and empty.

Absently, LOUIS stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag (where his

tools have also been replaced) and stands up with a wince. One

hand goes to his lower back. He looks down at the cairn.

He turns away toward the stairs.

EXT.  RACHEL, ON ROUTE 9

She's walking down the shoulder with her high heels in one hand.

Lights. An approaching car. She turns, thumb out. The car blasts

by.

She starts walking again.

EXT.  THE FIELD BESIDE LOUIS'S HOUSE

LOUIS is moving down the path. As he passes the tire swing he

pushes it, setting it in motion.

INT.  THE GARAGE

LOUIS slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the

kitchen. CHURCH is under the table but LOUIS Doesn't see him.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL

SOUND of LOUIS slowly plodding up the stairs. He comes into view,

dirty and exhausted, his hair hanging in his face. He walks down

the hall toward the master bedroom.

INT.  THE BEDROOM

The clock on the bedtable reads 2:17 A.M. LOUIS falls face-first

on the immaculate bedspread and lies still.

In this shot we should note the closet door is standing open.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, FEATURING GAGE'S CAIRN

THE CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY. Holds. Nothing for a beat. Then:

A small white hand slams up through the rocks, hopefully scaring

the living shit out of us.

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER as the hand begins to feel around. It takes

one of the rocks and pushes it aside. Another. Another. Another.

The SOUNDS are not encouraging. It is GRUNTING and GROWLING. There

is nothing human here.

Rocks begin to tumble as GAGE starts to come out of his grave.

INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

Fast asleep on the coverlet in his dirty jeans and black sweater.

EXT.  RACHEL

My babe is still takin' a hike. But here comes another vehicle.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL IN THE PET SEMATARY

THE CAMERA MOVES IN on that snarling face.

SOUNDS: GAGE coming. Dead dry breath. Low snarling noises.

Now we see small feet in dirty black shoes walking down the

deadfall.

EXT.  RACHEL

Suddenly, as the lights appear, she does a Claudette Colbert,

pulling her skirt up and exhibiting a very lovely leg.

Lights--it's an Orinco truck, naturally--spotlight her. The truck

stops.

EXT.  RACHEL AND THE TRUCK

The driver leans over and opens the door.

She does.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH CHURCH

He's under the kitchen table, green eyes gleaming. I think he

loves dead, hates living.

SOUND: The doorlatch. CHURCH MIAOWS.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, A NEW (LOW) ANGLE

GAGE'S shoes grit slowly across the linoleum, leaving dirty

tracks. CHURCH turns to watch GAGE'S passage, and then follows.

INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

CAMERA HOLDS ON LOUIS as those gritting footsteps approach. Then

we pan to the closet. On the floor is LOUIS'S little black bag. We

hold on this as the footfalls near. A small white hand enters the

frame and pulls the doctor-bag out of the closet. Now another hand

enters the frame and opens the bag. The hands search around inside

and bring out a scalpel.

They hold it up. The GAGE-THING makes a contented SOUND.

EXT.  THE ORINCO TRUCK, ON ROUTE 9  NIGHT

It sweeps past THE CAMERA

INT.  THE CAB, WITH RACHEL AND DRIVER

She looks at him, pleading. The TRUCKER speeds up.

EXT.  JUD, ON HIS PORCH

More deeply asleep than ever. Suddenly, from inside, comes the

sound of Quiet Riot singing/screaming "Bang Your Head." It's the

stereo, and boy, is it cranked.

JUD straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair. His

hands go first to his earphones--his first thought on waking is

that it's coming from there--and then he hurries inside.

CAMERA PANS DOWN to small muddy tracks on the porch floor.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD

He hurries in, turns on the light, and rushes across to his stereo

system, which is state-of-the-art digital--it looks like a flying

saucer among the more traditional furnishings of the room. He

shuts it off and looks around, frowning.

SOUND: Todd Rundgren, singing "Bang on the Drum All Day" at the

top of his voice.

JUD'S head snaps toward the SOUND.

INT.  A SONY RADIO, CU

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as JUD hurries across the kitchen to the

counter, where the radio is. He turns it off, looking around, more

bewildered than ever.

He walks toward the door which gives on the hall.

INT.  THE HALL, WITH JUD

It's dimly lit by light-spill from the living room and kitchen.

SOUND: Molly Hatchet, "Flirtin' with Disaster," being played top

end, from upstairs.

JUD hurries up. Let me suggest that there is a certain psychology

at work here--for the moment he's more concerned about waking the

neighborhood with all this high-decible rock and roll than with

the prowler...and he would certainly know who--or what--that

prowler was, if he had time to think.

INT.  JUD'S BEDROOM

He enters and turns on the light. We see a portable phonograph

with the record, turning. JUD rushes over and turns it off.

He looks around, and we see by his face that he knows.

He goes to the window and looks out at:

INT./EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE, WITH THE STATION WAGON, JUD'S POV

INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH JUD

He turns slowly and walks toward the bed.

He reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocket-knife. He unfolds

the blade.

SOUND: Miaow!

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH CHURCH, JUD'S POV

INT.  JUD, BY THE BED

INT.  JUD'S FEET

A small hand holding a scalpel shoots out from beneath the skirt

of the coverlet and slashes JUD'S calf,

INT.  JUD

He screams with pain and staggers backward.

INT.  JUD'S FEET

The other hand shoots out. GAGE grabs one of JUD'S ankles and

pulls.

INT.  JUD

With a startled yell, he falls.

INT.  JUD AND GAGE

This one's gotta be pretty rough. George will know what to do. We

finally see GAGE, but it should be clear to us that it's not

really GAGE at all. Some daemonic presence is riding inside the

mouldering, disfigured shell of GAGE.

There is a struggle. JUD is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel.

Perhaps he gets GAGE a time or two with the pocketknife.

GAGE screams and gibbers--nothing intelligible here; only sounds.

JUD expires.

GAGE sits on top of him...and then bites into his throat.

EXT.  ROUTE 9, BETWEEN THE CRANDALL AND CREED HOUSES

Headlights. RACHEL'S truck has arrived. It pulls up.

RACHEL opens the passenger door, which is on JUD'S side.

EXT.  ANGLE ON THE CAB

We can see PASCOW sitting in the passenger seat where RACHEL just

was.

She closes the door and steps down.

The truck starts off with a HISS OF RELEASED AIRBRAKES. As it

pulls past her, RACHEL starts across the road, when:

She stops, startled. Her face wears a "did I hear that?"

expression. She looks back toward JUD'S house.

RACHEL walks halfway up JUD'S paved walk and looks at:

EXT.  JUD'S HOUSE, RACHEL'S POV

The one place in the whole world we do not want RACHEL to go.

EXT.  RACHEL

She goes. Up the steps to the porch. All through this she's been

travelling with two bags: her handbag and a light tote with her

initials on it. Now she sets the tote down on the top step and

opens the porch door.

She looks very uncertain. This is the wee hours of the morning,

and someone else's house. But...that voice...

RACHEL looks stunned--rocked. She steps onto the porch.

The door to the house swings open. After a moment CHURCH comes

into the doorway and sits down.

She crosses to the open door.

No answer. RACHEL steps in.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING

INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

He's restless, having a very bad dream, from the look. He rolls

back and forth. Closer and closer to the edge. Finally, with a

wild yell, he goes over onto the floor.

INT.  LOUIS, ON THE FLOOR

He comes awake. Sits up. Ouch! He's aches from top to bottom and

side to side...but his back is worst. His hands go to it.

He starts to get up very slowly, and this his eyes fix on:

INT.  GAGE'S TRACKS ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV

They enter the house, go to the closet, then leave again.

INT.  LOUIS

He scrambles for the closet, his aches and pains forgotten. He

stares in wildly.

INT.  THE DOCTOR-BAG

It's open.

INT.  LOUIS

He pulls the doctor-bag out. His original hope is now tempered

with the first signs of fear. He begins to go through the doctor-

bag. Suddenly he brings out a case and opens it. The case is

empty, but the indented shape is clear. There was a scalpel in

this case...but not anymore.

INT.  THE HALL, WITH LOUIS

LOUIS stands there, tensely listening, for a moment or two, but

there's only silence. He rushes down the hallway and opens the

door to GAGE'S room.

INT.  GAGE'S ROOM, LOUIS'S POV

Empty.

INT.  LOUIS, ON THE STAIRS

He goes downstairs, yelling GAGE'S name.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

Nothing. The phone RINGS. LOUIS almost jumps out of his skin

reaching for it.

As IRWIN says this, LOUIS'S eyes fix upon something.

INT.  THE FLOOR, WITH TWO SETS OF GAGE-TRACKS, LOUIS'S POV

One set comes in from the shed-garage and heads for the parlor and

upstairs. The other comes out of the parlor and crosses to the

kitchen door giving directly on the outside.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

In his eyes we suddenly see that he understands everything...or

almost everything.

But LOUIS, whose last few responses have been almost trancelike,

hangs up. He looks at the tracks, then goes into the parlor.

INT.  THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE

Tiny bloody hands lift it off the cradle. A tiny bloody finger

dials.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN

The phone starts to ring. After two or three ringy-dingys, LOUIS,

looking extremely upset, comes out of the parlor and picks it up.

LOUIS is dumbfounded...slack-mouthed with terror.

GAGE begins to giggle...a really awful sound.

CLICK! The GAGE-THING hangs up, still giggling.

INT.  THE CREED BED, CU

He puts the doctor-bag down on the bed and roots through it. He

comes up with three syringes, still wrapped in paper, and puts

them aside. Then he roots around some more and comes up with

several ampoules. He holds one up for inspection and we can read

the word MORPHINE on it very clearly.

INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

He carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the

window. His hair has gone partially white.

He fills all three syringes with morphine (using two ampoules for

each syringe--i.e., enough to kill a polar bear) and puts them in

the left breast pocket of his shirt. He puts the spare ampoules in

the right breast pocket of his shirt.

LOUIS is slowly going insane. What remains of his rationality is

like a rapidly fraying rope.

He leaves the room.

EXT.  THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE

LOUIS comes out the door. In one hand he's got a raw pork chop. In

the other he is carrying a pair of Playtex rubber gloves. He walks

to the soft shoulder and waits for an Orinco truck to pass. Then

he crosses.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL WALK, WITH LOUIS

He walks most of the way to the house, then stops.

EXT.  CHURCH, LOUIS"S POV

He gets up, humping his back warily.

EXT.  LOUIS

He tosses the pork chop onto the grass.

EXT.  CHURCH

He hurries down the steps, goes to the chop, sniffs it, and starts

to chow up. He looks up at:

EXT.  LOUIS

He is pulling on the rubber gloves.

EXT.  CHURCH

He starts worrying the chop again. Smack-smack-smack.

EXT.  ANGLE ON LOUIS AND CHURCH

He finishes with the gloves, gets one of the loaded syringes out

of his breast pocket, holds it up, squirts a drop out of the tip,

then moves toward CHURCH.

CHURCH looks up. LOUIS stops moving. CHURCH starts eating again,

and LOUIS starts moving again as soon as he does. All the time he

talks to the cat in that soothing voice. He bends down...and grabs

him.

CHURCH begins to squall and fight. LOUIS holds onto him. He tries

to get the syringe into the cat and CHURCH almost gets away.

EXT.  CHURCH, CU

The syringe plunges into his haunch.

EXT.  CHURCH AND LOUIS

The needle is still dangling out of CHURCH'S haunch. The cat looks

dazed. It tries to walk and falls over on its side. It tries to

get up...and then falls over again.

He walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag.

EXT.  THE TOTE-BAG, LOUIS'S POV

Any doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is

erased by the initials--R.C., same as the cola.

EXT.  LOUIS

Twang! One of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted.

He looks back at:

INT.  CHURCH, ON THE PATH, LOUIS'S POV

Dead.

EXT.  LOUIS

He climbs the steps and goes onto the porch.

EXT. LOUIS, ON THE PORCH

He strips off the rubber gloves. He tosses them onto the table

beside JUD'S beer-cans as he goes inside.

INT.  THE FOYER OF THE CRANDALL HOME, WITH LOUIS

It's dark in here, and spooky.

No answer. He looks down and sees:

INT.  A SHOE, LOUIS'S POV

One of RACHEL'S shoes. It lies by the foot of the stairs.

INT.  LOUIS

He goes over and picks up the shoe. It's a three-quarter heel, and

it's pretty badly scuffed. RACHEL, after all, did some pretty hard

travelling to get here.

There's a spot of blood on it.

SOUND: A low giggle.

LOUIS looks up:

INT.  THE STAIRS, LOUIS'S POV

Mighty dark. Mighty shadowy.

SOUND: Another giggle.

INT.  LOUIS, AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS

INT.  THE STAIRS

INT.  LOUIS

He takes one of the loaded syringes from his pocket.

He begins to climb the stairs.

INT.  UPSTAIRS, WITH LOUIS

LOUIS arrives on the landing. We begin the nerve-wracking business

of checking rooms. First, the bathroom...and the shower curtain is

of course pulled. LOUIS yanks it back. Nothing.

He checks the linen closet. Nothing. Goes back to the hall. Looks

down it. He walks slowly along it. He checks one room. It's a

guest room. Shadowy and empty.

Down the hall. A closet door. A bag falls off the top shelf, and a

bunch of ceramics inside it SHATTER LOUDLY. LOUIS flinches back.

Down the hall. Now he's at JUD'S room. He goes in.

INT.  JUD'S ROOM, WITH LOUIS

He checks the closet. No go. He steps around the bed and sees:

INT.  THE FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV

A bloodstain.

INT.  LOUIS

He gets down on his hands and knees and examines the bloodstain.

He sees the skirt on the bedspread. He lifts it. He is nose to

nose with JUD, who is dead with his eyes open, an expression of

incredible horror on his face.

The DOOR SLAMS.

LOUIS bolts to his feet as GIGGLES fade down the hall.

Slowly, he kneels down and speaks to the skirt of the spread,

which has mercifully fallen back into place.

There's a SQUEAKING, SQUEALING SOUND.

LOUIS turns around. He gets up again. He starts for the door. Then

he turns back and speaks to JUD again.

He goes out.

INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH LOUIS

He takes one of the two remaining loaded syringes from his breast

pocket.

Another SQUEAKING SOUND. And another GIGGLE.

LOUIS starts slowly forward. He gets about halfway down the hall--

and our nerves are tuned to the breaking point--when there is a

SQUEALING CREAK and a GRATING THUMP from overhead.

INT.  CEILING TRAPDOOR

This happens fast. The trap--which presumably gives on the attic

with a set of folding stairs--rises, and RACHEL'S body plunges

down through and then hangs, swinging: she has been bound around

the armpits and as become a grotesque parody of MISSY DANDRIDGE.

Half her face is gone. Eaten.

INT.  LOUIS

He SCREAMS and backs against the wall. Twang! The last silver

thread parts.

INT.  THE TRAPDOOR, WITH GAGE

He leaps down, crashes on the floor, and then picks himself up. He

is waving the scalpel.

INT.  LOUIS AND GAGE

I won't choreograph all the moves, but GAGE slashes his stunned

father up pretty badly with the scalpel. He's screeching the whole

time. LOUIS finally begins to react. He grapples with the little

critter, and tries to get the syringe into him. No good. It's

batted out of his hand just before he can do it. It breaks.

LOUIS and GAGE fall to the floor. LOUIS gets the other syringe out

of his pocket, but it's also knocked out of his hand. Only

consolation is this one isn't broken. It rolls off along the

floor. LOUIS finally manages to get it again as the struggle goes

on, and plunges it into GAGE'S neck.

He gets to his feet, clawing for the needle lolling out of his

neck. He's lost all interest in his father. He goes staggering

away. He's slowing down. He goes to his knees...and falls on his

face.

LOUIS watches this... and then his vacant, half-catatonic gaze

goes to:

INT.  RACHEL, LOUIS'S POV

She swings slowly back and forth.

EXT.  THE BACK YARD OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE

Time has passed. It's late afternoon. LOUIS comes out with a

sheet-wrapped form in his arms. RACHEL, of course.

He sets the body down and goes back inside.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

He's splashing around a can of coal-oil. When he's got the room

wetted down to his satisfaction, he goes to the door, lights a

match, and tosses it.

Flame runs across the floor. The fire is slow at first, but then

it begins to gain rapidly.

LOUIS goes out.

EXT.  THE BACK LAWN, WITH LOUIS

He picks up the sheet-wrapped form of his wife and walks around

the side of the house as flames shoot through the kitchen windows.

EXT.  THE FRONT OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE, FROM ACROSS THE ROAD

LOUIS appears with his shrouded burden and approaches the road.

EXT.  THE SMOULDERING RUINS OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS FOR A MOMENT, then rises and looks toward the CREED

house. There's one light on--in the kitchen.

TOLLING CONTINUES: Three...four...five...

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH LOUIS

LOUIS is filthy, covered with dried blood. He is playing at

Patience. He holds a handful of cards.

TOLLING CONTINUES: Six...seven...

SOUND: The back door opens.

SOUND: Crickets from outside. Ree-ree-ree...

SOUND: Gritting footsteps.

LOUIS looks up. He doesn't look behind, at what's coming. He looks

straight ahead.

He flips up one card.

TOLLING CONTINUES: Eight...

INT.  THE CARD

It's the Bitch, the Queen of Spades, she who supposedly poisoned

the laddies in the Tower.

LOUIS'S hand falls upon it.

TOLLING CONTINUES: Nine...ten...

INT.  LOUIS, CU

A hand clotted with grave-dirt falls on his shoulder. A woman's

hand.

TOLLING CONCLUDES: Eleven...twelve...

FADE OUT ON THE SOUND OF CRICKETS.
