FADE IN:

FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the

people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the

policemen directing traffic.

PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS

waiting at street corner for light to change.

CLOSE SHOT - MAN

at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the

sky.

TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM

as she follows his gaze upward.

LONG SHOT - THE SKY

with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.

MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER

as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd

walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling

gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:

MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS

in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.

She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed,

exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick

sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride,

a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the

front door of a pet shop and enters.

INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT

Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back

toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.

MacGRUDER, comes toward her.

MED. SHOT

Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is

BARKING, o.s.

They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird

department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor

of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie

and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There

is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls

are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so

that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained

birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic

birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages,

larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets

in the bigger cages. As they walk:

As Melanie starts writing:

She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie

finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the

counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.

Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter,

she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips

with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding

her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the

bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins

BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.

MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER

as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the

steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about

twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt

hat.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of

strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.

The birds are startled into scarlet flight.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little

nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes

her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and

then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of

the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to

inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But

then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea

comes to her.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.

The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries

out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter

where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily,

and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary

cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.

One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and

into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.

FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT

as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and

Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter,

finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all

day.

She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up

to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches

them suspiciously.

He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers

the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

the canary in his hand.

FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT

as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the

door.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

startled.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her

bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:

The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

seething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

going down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She

looks through the glass.

LONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

getting into his car at the curb.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

looking after the car at the curb.

CLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She

begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V.

as she comes up to the counter.

As Melanie begins writing:

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE.

FADE IN:

FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR

pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She

glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around

to the other side, and opens the door.

CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

in a cage as Melanie reaches for them.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

turning from the car and going into the building. She pauses

in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons.

CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND

running down the list of names slowly. It stops.

INSERT - THE CARD

her finger beside it.

BRENNER, M. 3B

CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she

runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then

does the same for the next column.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby,

grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door.

REVERSE SHOT - MELANIE

coming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly

toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing,

waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with

answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the

elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The

elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows

her to enter first. She does so with a small nod.  The

elevator doors close.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR

The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and

Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander

down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him.  Self-

consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds.

The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The

doors begin to open.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

stepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is

right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The

man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in

front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn

the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment

just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key.

He looks at Melanie.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

smiling at him feebly.

FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm

of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie

watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down

before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND

reaching into the purse for a white envelope.

INSERT - THE FACE OF THE ENVELOPE

written there in Melanie's handwriting: MR. MITCHELL BRENNER.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

as she props the envelope against the cage, and then hurriedly

goes down the hallway, intent on retreat.

FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

the man at the one end, key in his hand; Melanie at the other

end, near the elevator.

She presses button for the elevator.

The elevator doors open.

He puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes

inside. The door closes. Melanie is alone in the hallway.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

exasperated. She looks at the open elevator. She turns to

look at the birds.

LONG SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

in their cage outside the apartment door, CHATTERING.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

surrendering with a gesture of resignation. She walks down

the hall, picks up envelope and puts it in her purse, picks

up the bird cage, carries it back to the elevator. The birds

are COOING and CHIRPING madly.

And she steps into the elevator.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE)

on the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day,

with a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow

should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the

ocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged

birds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL

SHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

She turns wheel forcefully.

CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

in the cage as the car rounds the bend. They lean to one

side as the car turns, come up straight again as the car

rounds the curve.

docks, continuing Melanie's slow observation of the place.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - (PROCESS)

studying the town. The car turns into road by gas station.

FULL SHOT - THE TOWN

through the windshield. The car turns right. There is life

in the town now, fishermen crossing the road, women with

their hair in curlers, old ladies carrying shopping bags.

This is Saturday morning, and the town -- such as it is --

is alive with its inhabitants. We see them from Melanie's

P.O.V. AS SHE SCANS THE PLACE FOR ITS POST OFFICE. (THIS TO

BE TAKEN ON BACK LOT.)

FULL SHOT - THE CAR

pulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the

door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling

suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks

quickly toward the front door.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

enters post office.

CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK

behind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out

a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not

look up as she approaches.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

through the bars of the cage.

CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK

He is still busy with his form, still does not look up.

It seems as if the Clerk will not answer her. Suddenly, he

leaves the window.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

through the bars, exasperated.

REVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE

as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's

vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the

Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches

him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if

he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock

still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then

that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither

speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at

her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends

his arm and points.

FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE)

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK

He nods briefly and goes inside. Melanie looks across the

bay.

FULL SHOT - THE BAY - MELANIE'S P.O.V. - (MATTE)

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

smiling. She gets a new idea. She reaches into her purse for

the envelope. She looks at the envelope, then tears it up

and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag. She turns

back toward the post office.

INT. THE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT

as Melanie approaches the Clerk's window. He is still busy,

still does not look up.

The Clerk nods.

passing the school and pulling up outside the teacher's house.

CLOSE SHOT - THE RED MAIL BOX

with the name "Hayworth" on it. PULL BACK to reveal:

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door.

The house is a two-story frame with steps leading to the

front door. There are white curtains in every window of the

house, and a sign in the window to the left of the doorway

advises, ROOM TO LET. Melanie rings the doorbell.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

waiting. She RINGS the bell again:

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

walking along the porch of the house. The walk in front of

the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared-for

flowers. ANNIE HAYWORTH comes round from the back of the

house as Melanie reaches the corner. She is a woman of thirty-

two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face.  Her

hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the

garden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth-

stained gloves. But there is something about her, a feeling

of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness.

CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

She is puzzled by Melanie who, exquisitely dressed and

groomed, seems singularly out of place in Bodega Bay. She

studies her openly.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

taking cigarette, hesitating.

CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

studying her, thinking she understands.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

There is an awkwardness here. Annie wants to know more. She

puffs on the cigarette, smiles, tries a friendly approach.

There is a pause. Melanie, by her silence, affirms that it

is none of Annie's business.

They begin walking toward the car.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

as she gets in behind the wheel. Annie's remark is not lost

on her, and a quick look of sudden understanding crosses her

face.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

as Annie leans over the seat.

Taking this as a further indication of Melanie's relationship

with Mitch:

She nods pleasantly, starts the car, pulls away.

CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

watching the car, a look of sad resignation on her face.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

coming out of Brinkmeyer's General Store, carrying a small

paper bag, walking toward her car out front. The CAMERA

in for the paper bag.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S CAR

crossing the highway down into the parking area behind the

Tides, close to the docks.

HIGH SHOT

She gets out of the car and walks onto one of the docks, the

bird cage in her hand. Melanie approaches a waiting fisherman.

She asks for her boat. The fisherman nods. He leads her to

the dock and the waiting boat.  She gets into the outboard

motorboat, the fisherman helping her. He hands down the

lovebirds in their cage.

FULL SHOT - THE BOAT

pulling away from the dock, heading across the bay.

VERY LONG SHOT (MATTE) - THE BOAT

and the wide expanse of the bay, as it heads on a direct

course for the house on the other side.

VERY LONG SHOT (MATTE)

Another spectacular SHOT of the small boat.

FULL SHOT - THE BOAT

coming head-on toward CAMERA, Melanie at the tiller. She

cuts the motor. The motor drifts to a stop. The bay is silent

except for the cry of the gulls.

LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

There is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a

little closer. As Melanie watches, the front door opens and

a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the

engine. A little girl comes out of the house, goes to the

truck, gets in. The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch

Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this

distance -- and he comes over to the truck.

The truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and

heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust

behind it. The farm is still again. Mitch stands looking

after the truck for a moment, and then begins walking up

toward the barn in the distance.

CLOSE SHOT

watching, biting her lip.

LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

Mitch reaching the barn and entering. Silence.

cage. She climbs onto the dock and approaches the CAMERA

until she is in WAIST SHOT. The CAMERA STARTS to RECEDE in

front of her as she walks forward.

THE CAMERA MOVING TOWARD THE HOUSE AND BARN

The barn door closed, still no sign of Mitch.

WAIST SHOT - MELANIE

Coming off the dock and onto the lawn, the CAMERA still

He is smiling with amused recognition; he lowers the

binoculars and dashes OUT OF FRAME.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE (PROCESS)

The CAMERA IS MOVING WITH her as she looks toward Mitch.

weakly.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

MITCH

as he tries door of next office. It, too, is locked.

They walk quickly up the slope to the Tides, establishing

gas station across the road, the collection of stores

opposite, the cars pulling in and out. Mitch opens the door

for her, and they ENTER.

INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

This is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of

a local hangout. There are fishermen lounging at the bar,

and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two

ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are

sitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall

of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the

bay and the parking area below. A television set over the

bar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western

movie should be HEARD muted throughout following.  DEKE

CARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates

his attention between serving his customers and watching the

Western. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER.

MED. SHOT - THE BAR

Mitch and Melanie coming over to it.

Melanie climbs onto the stool.

He is rummaging around in the kit.

He pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the

cut. They are silent for several seconds. Then:

As he swabs cut.

He takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:

He presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a

mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at

it. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says:

She lowers her head.

They turn toward the door.

MED. SHOT - LYDIA BRENNER

closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. She is a

woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse,

cardigan sweater, low heels. There is nothing agrarian-looking

about her. She speaks with the quick tempo of the city

dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

Her eyebrows raising ever so slightly, not in displeasure,

but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the

introduction.

BACK TO SCENE

Lydia thinks she understands. This is one of Mitch's San

Francisco chippies.

Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her

hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still

in the window. The door suddenly opens.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

There is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at

Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant.

Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then

smiles.

There is a moment where both women look at each other...

When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she

is again telling Annie to mind her own business.

There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's

attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly.

She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both

hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward.

LONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS

flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky.

TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously

serious expression.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

reaching up for the rear view mirror, tilting it to examine

her lipstick, touching the edge of her mouth with one hand.

She gets out of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING her to the house.

She climbs the porch steps, KNOCKS on the door. There is no

answer. Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard. In

the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from

behind the chicken sheds. She raises her arm in greeting.

FULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA

in the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms.

CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year-

old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt

and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates

for just a moment.

And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking

her off her feet, hugging her fiercely.

The meal is over. The lovebirds in their hanging cage have

been covered for the night. In the b.g. Mitch and Lydia are

playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from

the ashtray now and again to take a puff.

He GOES INTO kitchen.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY

Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her

cigarette.

MED. SHOT - THE CAR

as it pulls away. Mitch yanks his hands back from the door.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

as he watches the car leave.

LONG SHOT - THE ROAD

The car turns the bend and disappears. Empty road. Only the

long line of telephone poles and wires and... something

strange on the wires.

CLOSE SHOT MITCH

His attention caught by the poles and wires.

CLOSE SHOT - THE WIRES

Hundreds of birds sitting on them.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

standing and watching. A wind blows off the water. He shivers

suddenly, turns up his collar, and heads for the house.

INT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT - ANNIE

HAYWORTH

In an easy chair, reading. She is wearing a robe and smoking,

absorbed in her book. She turns when she hears the front

DOOR OPENING.

Annie rises to greet her. As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT:

As Annie gets the brandy:

MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her.

She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact,

by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her

the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.

Melanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause.

Melanie shrugs.

Melanie nods.

There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.

Melanie nods.

There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE

shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer

it.

CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

at the phone.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie

hesitating.

Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie

to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her

throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie

talks to Mitch in the background.

Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a

wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally

and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.

She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.

She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.

Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent

for a moment, pensive. Then:

The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.

Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door,

startling them both.

Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks

the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.

There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.

CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL

CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

who stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up.

And then, slowly:

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

as Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and

consternation:

FADE IN

HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with

balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn.

The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are

clustered around a long folding table upon which are

sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either

helping the children to more or telling them they are having

too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and

LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party,

are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and

away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin

bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the

entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background.

The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more,

the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the

CAMERA out to the left.

CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES

Melanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and

stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one

of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one

of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.

They drink.

She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really

considered before what she does with her time, and now that

she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and

unimportant.

She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out

LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into

Melanie's face.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

serious, introspective.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where

the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch

stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse

of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children

are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold

from Michele to Cathy.

CAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH

The CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We

see Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by

way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they

reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of

the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS

OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the

children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from

Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back.  During

this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes

of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is

watching Mitch and Melanie.

MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.

MED. SHOT - ANNIE

CAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this

moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday

cake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also

catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat

as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple.

During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy

off.

She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She

turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on

her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as

though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees.

Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:

Annie swings round and the CAMERA RUSHES INTO her face as

she looks up.

LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S P.O.V.

A gull is swooping down.

CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

as she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously

reaches out in front of her at the air. The gull suddenly

swoops at her, hitting her shoulder. She whirls.

She almost falls.

FULL SHOT - THE GULL

returns.

to the front of it.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

about to swing with the broom again, but the birds are no

longer there. A puzzled look crosses his face. He turns to

Melanie.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

FULL SHOT - THE LAWN

as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the

cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck

very close by without having injured anyone. All that

adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.

And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her,

and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before.

TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent

meaningful glance.

BACK TO SCENE

They all turn toward the table.

CLOSE SHOT - THE TABLE AND THE REST OF THE FOOD ON THE TABLE,

She nods, and then looks up at the sky. Suddenly she shudders.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HANDS - DINING ROOM INT. IN BACKGROUND

He is slicing the leftover roast beef.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

putting the meat onto plate, turning over his shoulder to

call into living room. The lovebirds in their cage are making

a terrible racket.

Lydia turns from a side table, where she is cutting some

French bread.

She covers the cage. Under the cover, the birds are still

tweeting madly. Lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment,

and then signs heavily.

As she moves into the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

a sharp look at her daughter.

MED. SHOT - CATHY

pouring coffee into the cups set on coffee table.

They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet

something in the fireplace.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

swinging the fireplace broom.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

rushing to the fireplace. He is almost knocked over by birds

coming out of the opening. He stuffs paper under the logs

already in place there.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

She lets out a horrified scream. There are birds fluttering

in her hair, caught there.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

swinging the broom, covered with birds.

MED. SHOT - A PICTURE ON THE WALL

(an enlargement of a photograph of Cathy, smiling.) As a

bird flutters against it.

MED. SHOT - CATHY

running into the room, covering her face with bent arm,

rushing to Mitch with the box of matches.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

taking the matches. He lights one. A bird hits his arm. He

drops the match. He lights another one.

CLOSE SHOT - THE MATCH

falling onto the paper in the fireplace. It flickers for a

moment, then catches. Birds are still pouring out, past the

paper beginning to catch.

CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER WINDOW PANE

as a bird crashes through it.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

rushing to Lydia, swinging the cloth at her head. She is

hysterics now, BABBLING. The SHRIEK of the birds is a wild

cacophony.

CLOSE SHOT - THE FIRE

blazing.

MED. SHOT - A BIRD

swooping out of the fireplace, its wings aflame.

FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

less birds in the air now, the single flaming bird flying

toward the drapes.

birds bursting through the panes, leaving.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

as she beats away another bird.

CLOSE SHOT - ONE OF THE BROKEN WINDOWS

the birds leaving en masse now.

FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

A shambles. Windows broken, furniture knocked over, pictures

askew, the floor covered with birds and broken glass. In a

corner of the room, Lydia crouches with her hands covering

her face, sobbing. The burnt curtain is still smoldering.

Mitch is covered with soot. Melanie puts down the broom

wearily. The attack is over.

INT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND

reaching down to pick up a dead bird.

MED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY

a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out

speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the

palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while.

No answer.

He exits.

FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

It is silent. Mitch looks across at Lydia who sits as still

as a stone in her chair. The door closes gently on a note of

utter helplessness.

FADE IN

INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather

unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store.  Her

hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a

lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is

busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS

VOICES.

Melanie finished brushing her teeth. She goes to the window

and looks out. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of the pickup truck

starting.

FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck

and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the

road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

turning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA

FOLLOWING. She opens the door.

There is no answer.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

coming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops

at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on

her face.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS

She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds

TWEET at her.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is

an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall.

She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then

peers out of the side window.

LONG SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin

column of smoke is climbing the sky.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

carrying the cup of coffee. She sets it down for a moment to

put on her fur coat, which is hanging on the hall stand. She

picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and EXITS.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the

cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee

and then breathes deeply of the air.

CLOSE SHOT - HER FACE

fresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have

not seen before. She looks off toward the shore.

LONG SHOT - MITCH

on the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke

is climbing the sky.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the

end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off

the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the

sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs

as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky

for a moment.

SLOW PAN

as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in

sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in

its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin

column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and

raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts

the rake down and begins walking toward the house.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

There is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch

coming toward her, her eyes glowing.

FULL SHOT - MITCH

closer to the house now.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

waiting, anticipating.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

as first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR

CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the

garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS

again. She turns.

Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing

a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

Melanie is uncomprehending.

Mitch grins.

They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then

laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly

still.

She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time.

Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror

story, they are becoming a little frightened.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

her face dead serious.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

His voice trails. His face becomes serious, too. Again, the

garden is silent.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

her face set and grim, her eyes serious, her words coming

slowly and with the chill of horror on them.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

He takes her in his arms suddenly, to comfort her. She goes

to him longingly.

She looks up at him suddenly.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

They kiss suddenly and fiercely. On their kiss,

EXT. FAWCETT FARM - FULL SHOT - THE RED PICKUP TRUCK

Lydia at the wheel, pulling into the Fawcett farm, the name

of the farm clearly visible on a painted arch over the gate.

Lydia gets out of the truck and walks to the front door. She

knocks. There is no answer.

MED. SHOT - LYDIA

She comes down off the steps, the CAMERA FOLLOWING, back a

little away from the house.

There is no answer. She shades her eyes and looks out over

the fields.

scurrying about. She walks closer to them, sees an open bag

of feed lying against the fence.

MED. SHOT - LYDIA

reaching into the bag of feed. She scatters some on the

ground.

CLOSE SHOT - A CHICKEN

He struts up to the scattered grain.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

watching him.

CLOSE SHOT - THE CHICKEN

He seems to be examining the feed. Then he turns away from

it and struts off.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

a small knowledgeable nod of her head. The chicken's reaction

strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett.  She turns.

FULL SHOT - LYDIA

approaching the front door again. She knocks. No answer.

She backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent.

In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor.

No answer.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

a little annoyed. She glances at the ground floor window

closest to the door.

CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDOW

A small pane of glass is broken.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

puzzled.

FULL SHOT - LYDIA

going to the front door, trying the knob.

MED. SHOT - LYDIA

The door opening ahead of her as she pokes her head into the

house.

The house is still and silent.

INT. THE ENTRY HALL - FULL SHOT

as Lydia comes in. We can see the living room off to the

right, but it looks normal and untouched. Lydia turns to her

left and looks down a long corridor.

FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

a door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial

light into the corridor.

No answer.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

a little troubled. She seems deciding whether or not she

should leave. A determined look comes over her face.

FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

as she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the

opposite end. Outside the door, she pauses.

No answer. Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing

the door open.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

coming into the room. Her eyes begin to take in the room.

SLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and

continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A

standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still

burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass

shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane

of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its

top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped

out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near

decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser,

all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS,

and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass,

continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its

PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single

bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas,

one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately

CLOSE SHOT - DAN FAWCETT

His face. Covered with blood, the eyes missing from their

empty staring sockets.  Immediately

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

a terrified scream erupting from her mouth.

FULL SHOT - LYDIA

turning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in

an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she

is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips

her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still

screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she

backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway,

CAMERA FOLLOWING.  CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

at the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide.

FULL SHOT - THE TRUCK

at breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the

highway. It almost hits a small car coming from the opposite

direction, swerves, screeches around the curve.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

behind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight.

FULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV

through the windshield, blurring past. She turns the bend

leading to the house. For an instant, through the windshield,

there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in

the garden. Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and

barrels into the front yard.

FULL SHOT - MITCH

alarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck

just as it jerks to a stop.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

through the truck as he pulls open the door opposite Lydia.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

slumped on the wheel of the car, her head on her arms,

sobbing. On her sobs...

INT. BRENNER KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner.

She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set

with sugar and creamer. She looks up as Mitch comes into the

kitchen.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses

her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to

him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.

She walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss -- a long,

full kiss.

FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN

as Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and

then picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his

car starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen,

through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on

the other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.

FULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM

This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a

life no longer valid.  There are photographs of her dead

husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of

Mitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct

femininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing

the tray.

TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

There is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed,

arranges the pillows behind Lydia.

She sips at the tea. There is a long awkward pause. Melanie

walks to the window and looks out over the bay.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

at the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression

clearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all

right. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting

smile on her face, and her voice is soothing.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND LYDIA

There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in

this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her

husband's death, is discussing it with another person.

Curiously, the person is Melanie.

She picks up the tray and starts for the door.

At the door, Melanie turns.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

her face soft.

EXT. BODEGA BAY - DAY - LONG SHOT

Melanie's car turns and goes up School Road.

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY - MED. SHOT

Inside the school, we HEAR the children SINGING.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

smiling as she gets out of the car and heads for the school.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie into the school and down the

corridor. The children's VOICES are LOUDER now.

Melanie is at the door to Annie's room now. She opens the

door and looks in.

FULL SHOT - ANNIE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

leading the children in song. She catches sight of Melanie

at the door. Melanie wiggles her fingers. Annie points to

her wristwatch indicating that she'll be finished in a few

minutes and motions for her to wait in the play-yard outside.

Melanie turns and starts down the corridor again.

EXT. SCHOOL - MED. PANNING SHOT

Melanie emerges and strolls up street toward Annie's house.

Inside the children are still singing.

Again five more crows arrive.

CLOSE UP - MELANIE

head and shoulders of Melanie as she sits smoking. There is

no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing

inside the schoolhouse. Melanie is puffing away at her

cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the

school. We hold on this shot of Melanie for a very long time

so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going

on behind her with the crows. After a wait of about what

seems to be a half a minute or more, Melanie's attention is

drawn to something above her.

MED. SHOT - SKY

A crows is coming down.

CLOSE UP - MELANIE

as her eyes follow the flight of the crow.

MED. SHOT - SKY

Crow moving down and LEFT to RIGHT, the sky and Annie's roof

CLOSE UP - MELANIE

Her head has twisted around to follow the flight of the crow.

She is almost looking into the play yard.

MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

A crow slowly descends to the play yard and as the CAMERA

FOLLOWS it down, we see for the first time that the number

of crows has increased to an alarming number - almost 200 or

even perhaps 250. This last crow settles down with the others.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE The CAMERA WHIPS UP as she leaps to her

feet in alarm. Her body has turned, but we are now facing

the opposite side of the school yard.

CLOSER SHOT - PLAY YARD

The play yard is full of crows.

Big head of horrified Melanie.

MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

A closer view of the menacing birds.

FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

Annie is lining the children up near the door leading to the

play yard.

The children mutter for a moment, and then are still.

She begins opening the play yard door. Suddenly, the door

from the corridor bursts open, and Melanie rushes wildly

INTO the room. She goes directly to Annie, shoves her out of

the way, and SLAMS shut the play yard door.

Annie gives a quick nod, understanding immediately.

FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

Through the windows, we can see the waiting crows. One moves

restlessly into flight, then settles on the equipment again.

The children modulate into silence.

The children again fall silent.

The children walk two-by-two to the corridor door. John opens

it, and they begin filing out. Melanie turns to look at the

play yard.

INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as

DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his

wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A

DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of

booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in

his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and

efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another

table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing

and clowning around throughout following at a table in the

rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the

counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens.

Over her head, the television set is blasting with its

perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.

The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing

walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking

woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through

foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what

Melanie is saying.

As Deke opens cash register...

Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.

Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to

Melanie.

She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.

As Melanie looks it up...

LAUGHTER from salesman at table.

Her background conversation continues through following:

CLOSE SHOT - THE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN

waiting for their lunch, listening to the conversation;

becoming very nervous.

eating.

BACK TO SCENE

CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN

as Helen brings food. She is beginning to get really

frightened.

BACK TO SCENE

There is a long silence.

Another silence.

A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.

CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN

getting more and more anxious.

The door opens. Mitch and Al Malone come in.

At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily.

The Tides is silent for a moment.

Sholes turns to him.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

his face very serious.

Pause. They are silent.

There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly:

They turn toward the window.

TIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT

Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or

four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of

the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the

window and out to the left.

TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT

The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the

attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is

seen disappearing into the men's room.

INT. TIDES

A quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the

Tides Restaurant.

TIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT

A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man

on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and

then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out

and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep

by.  The gas begins to flow away.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

inside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie

after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see

people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas

station. At the door, Mitch turns.

Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch.

They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at

the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the

window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to

rescue the attacked gas station attendant.

Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter

away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in

the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks

down.

TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT

on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is

flowing to the right into the car park.

CLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE

flowing down to the car park.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

through the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station.

MED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS

along the flowing gas back to the station.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

She turns back to the car park.

FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked

below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up,

has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of

lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the

happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn

attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the

man.

FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

The man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As

he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and

he drops it.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

Her horror-stricken face.

FULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA

Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's

car, and the one next to it go up in flames.

CLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE

TURNING TO SEE

FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION

The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars,

following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump,

which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured

attendant.

EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT

A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the

town rushing around the car park and the streets across the

highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see

automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil

smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the

parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and

have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the

foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill

with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes

obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop

down on the town.

EXT. TIDES TOWN

A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone

booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing

out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin

to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the

restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch:

We see her look up to the sky.

LONG SHOT - THE SKY

The sky is full of seagulls.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

Looking about her frantically. She turns her face up again

to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in

the phone booth.

CLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE

slams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all

around her.

EXT. TIDES TOWN

From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people

who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with

clouds of birds coming on them.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her

eyes for Mitch.

MED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

in the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the

direction of the car park.

EXT. TIDES CAR PARK

Some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water

from the bay. They are turning the stream onto the burning

cars. At this time, the birds are filling the area around

them. They suddenly turn the hose up into the birds.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

Her eyes turn up quickly.

LONG SHOT - FROM HER VIEWPOINT

We see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds.

Melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car.

EXT. TIDES TOWN - FROM HER VIEWPOINT

We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner

coming toward her in the phone booth.  We can see birds flying

in and out of the windows of the car.  We can see the arm

and hand of the driver trying to beat them away. In the

background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive.

CLOSEUP - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE

as the car comes toward her in the booth.

EXT. TIDES TOWN

At the last minute, the car swerves away from the booth.

CLOSER SHOT

A side view of the car after practically scraping the side

of the booth. We see that it's full of birds attacking the

driver. As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently

give us a view of its interior.

FLASH CLOSEUP - MELANIE

watching the car.

EXT. TIDES CAR PARK

The car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars. It

explodes.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

Suddenly she hears the firing of a gun. She turns.

TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT

She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no

avail. One or two descend upon him. He throws the gun down

and rushes back into the Tides Office. Melanie, with a slight

turn, now sees:

THE TIDES TOWN

The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop

their hose.

CLOSER SHOT

shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the

water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows

of the phone booth.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

recoils from this water attack. Through the streaming window

she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the

left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its

palomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and

leaping and kicking its van to pieces.

At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of

a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows.

His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are

covered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight.

Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides

Town. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter,

the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and

waving the birds away from them with flailing arms.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of

recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls

crash around the booth causing her to go back.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE IN PROFILE

looking out again toward Mitch.

EXT. TIDES TOWN

Through window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction

while Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning

building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station.

Mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the

smoking building.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

looking across in horror.

LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING

For a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly

Mitch appears with the small child at the window. He calls

down. One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office,

another from the Tides Restaurant. They both wait below the

window as Mitch drops the child.

FLASH - MELANIE

watching this breathlessly.

CLOSER SHOT

The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up.

He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the

windows. They disappear into the building.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

holding her breath.

LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING

No sign of Mitch.

CLOSEUP - MELANIE

getting more desperate.

CLOSEUP - BUILDING

No sign of Mitch. Suddenly a chair flies through the window

and Mitch climbs OUT and drops to the ground.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

opening the door of the booth, yells out to him.

LONG SHOT - MITCH

sees her and starts running toward the booth.

HIGH SHOT - MITCH

beating his way through the birds. He reaches the booth.

LOW SHOT

close to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag

Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the

CAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.

INT. THE TIDES

There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the

windows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The

CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very

hurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside.

There is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can

hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a

woman's voice SCREAMS out:

Some of the heads of the group turn.

CLOSE SHOT

It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs.

Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and

helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some

words.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

looking across at this slight scene. They turn back and over

their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity.

Melanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud

CRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly.

MED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

And past the heads of the other people who have also turned,

we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has

gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who

are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the

window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the

street.

They open the door and make their way out into the street,

running and looking about them desperately.

EXT. BODIGA STREET

There are one or two gulls flying around. Others are perched

on roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the

sidewalk.

EXT. BODIGA STREET

There are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as

they move along past the last street and come into the more

countrified part of the town.

LONG SHOT - THE SCHOOL YARD

We see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which

we see in the distance. There are some birds perched on the

school roof.

SIDE-ON DOLLY SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

going up the school road. He stops for a moment and looks

up, Melanie following his look.

SKY SHOT - FULL

of wheeling gulls.

SIDE-ON CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

They move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the

school. Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt.

LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE - FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT

There are a few blackbirds on it.

CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

Mitch starts off. Melanie restrains him.

CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

They advance cautiously. When they are level with the play

yard, we see what they see.

MED. SHOT

THE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of

crows.

CLOSE SHOT

They walk stealthily past.

CLOSE SHOT

CAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows.

CLOSE SHOT

Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they

approach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over

her shoulder toward the crows.

EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE

Melanie and Mitch arrive. They come to a sudden stop.

LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE

A woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the

door.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

He reaches the body. He rolls it over.

QUICK CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

dead.

QUICK CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

The shock registering on his face.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

realizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment

what Mitch's reaction will be.

MED. SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

He kneels silently by the body. Gently, he touches Annie's

face, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket

and covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to

keep her warm. He turns away then.

MED. SHOT - THE WINDOW

with its ROOM TO LET sign. Cathy is standing near the sign,

with her eyes peering at something outside.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

turning to follow Cathy's gaze.

CLOSE SHOT - MIXED BIRDS

Malevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers.

FULL SHOT - THE ROAD

As in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at

the birds. Melanie dashes forward.

She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he

maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are

now hovering flight.

Her words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the

house and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a

state of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds

Cathy to her.

CLOSER THREE SHOT

as Melanie looks anxiously toward the house.

He GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder

is the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and

then a door is CLOSED.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

We see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer

in the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA.

MED. SHOT

He joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the

three of them as they silently make their way past the crows

once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out

cautiously to the right.

MED. SHOT

CAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again.

BACK TO THE DOLLY SHOT OF THE THREE

They move forward stealthily, CAMERA AHEAD of them.

MED. SHOT

Another DOLLY SHOT past the crows.

CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE

The CAMERA is now behind them. They move away from us and go

toward the waiting car.

MED. SHOT

They arrive at the car.

She goes round the far side and gets into the car. Mitch

slips in behind the driver's seat. The car turns into the

CAMERA and goes down the school road.

FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

Mitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the CAMERA, tensely. Melanie

looks over her shoulder.

Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes

wide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then

suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as

the CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.

TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her.

CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA

TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings

to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues

low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting

there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd,

not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the

Brenner house in the distance.

FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed

across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two

attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.

LONG SHOT - THE BAY

covered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is

still smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where

the ladder leans against the side of the house.

FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE

as Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner,

carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She

is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is

not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her

hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked

with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there

is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she

stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.

Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.

They are both silent.

Mitch nods. Silence.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT

Lydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a

footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the

room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from

the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

listening.

Music begins to play.  The music is sweet, with violins and

long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the

tension being played in front of it.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

the strain showing on his face. He nods briefly.

FULL SHOT - HOUSE

as Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood.

There is a NOISE in the sky. Startled, glancing upward, they

begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly

scan the sky.

FULL SHOT - ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS

flying in tight formation.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face.

It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa

Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well.

Melanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and

her eyes remain on the sky.

FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we

can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the

sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch.

There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights,

kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace

putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room

and dumps another load.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

studying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

her hand trembling as she pours the coffee.

FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

as they all sit and accept their coffee. The room is silent

except for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more

wood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still

are CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in

the house.

The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the

lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall

silent.

CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

turning to look toward the other room, her face going white,

her eyes widening.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

waiting.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

waiting.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

waiting.

FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

dead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of

their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of

splintering glass.

Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING,

the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence.  More panes

of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards

and the outside of the house begins building, almost like

muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm.

Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration,

is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section

entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the

roof.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She

squeezes her eyes shut.

TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

as the child cuddles up into her arms. Over the other sounds,

there comes a NEW SOUND, the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat

of a woodpecker. It stops. It begins again. Rat-tat-tat tattat-

tat. Tat-

Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.

They leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR

Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling

of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of

birds striking the house.

FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the

birds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his

watch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back

door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the

dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.

CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

watching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?

He cannot tell.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a

NEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing

sound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

coming into the entry hall.

CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR

The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside

assail the door.

FULL SHOT - MITCH

turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining

room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it

toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and

piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again,

CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags

it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table

when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with

alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is

and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of

desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The

CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din

now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.

She shakes her head. They both move into the dining room,

the CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their

cage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready

to carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the

chair, goes to the cage.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

looking at the birds, wondering.

CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS

looking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their

expressions. Malice or benevolence?

MED. SHOT - MITCH

He raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage.

CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS

watching, unmoving.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER

as he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.

One of them tweets.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door,

takes out a small box of bird feed.

CLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE

as his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.

His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the

small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.

Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.

The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the

small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it

in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then,

tweeting, they begin to eat.

FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

as Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped

against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.

Wearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling,

pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.

She shakes her head.

There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like

a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close,

Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand

in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of

night sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.

The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the

blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the

SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes

on.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as

he directs the beam upwards.

In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is

almost black in the room except for the strange effect of

the flashlight as he holds it behind her.

FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the

fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep

on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs.

Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly

and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer

the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another

SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a

steady dribbling, difficult to place.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

listening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

as she turns toward him.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

asleep.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming

from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep,

picks up a very long flashlight.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the

entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled

against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into

the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam

on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor

outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters,

goes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's

all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second

bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first

door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light

on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor,

goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to

the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back

toward the door when she stops.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

looking.

CLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR

a pile of chipped and broken plaster.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling.

CLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING

A huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face,

and suddenly, her eyes open wide.

CLOSE SHOT - AN OWL

sitting in the darkness, staring at her.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

reacting.

QUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL

wings spread in the beam of light.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE

backing to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering

back, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the

FULL SHOT - THE CEILING

a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward

her.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds

attack her.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face.

MED. SHOT - MELANIE

swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.

FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS

grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is

a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering

wings.

He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie

struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed

by the birds.

She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the

spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering

of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault

on the door by Mitch outside.

MED. SHOT - THE ROOM

Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in

view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see

on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.

The door begins to open.

FULL SHOT - MITCH

as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room.  He

begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for

Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins

dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been

shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.

We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch

pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut

behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at

the few birds that have escaped into the corridor.

She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds.

There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He

will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his

hand, knocking the club from it.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his

hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob.

Another bird flutters into the corridor.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his

hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and

is immediately attacked by the other bird.

TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a

heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily

to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and

compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the

doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to

the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to

Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia

following. As they go downstairs:

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.

FULL SHOT - MITCH

as he carries her into the living room, but her down on the

couch.

Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket.

By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over

Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands

are trembling, and he drops it.

She picks up the bandage.

He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.

But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the

cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.

Pause.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to

hear.

FULL SHOT - MITCH

as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the

table and chair. He opens the door a crack.

FULL SHOT - THE YARD

through the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no

birds visible.

FULL SHOT - THE DOOR

from outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred

and splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds

spill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is

directly behind him.

FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE

a shambles, all the windows broken.

TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

He holds out his hand to her.

FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD

It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before

dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following

until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is

deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's

convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house

together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the

back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background

is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia

comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking

down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the

house.

CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just

outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

looking back at her.

FULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA

Across the expanse of the desolated yard.

He does not answer. She continues looking at him.

He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car.

The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front

seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops,

and looks toward the trees.

MED. SHOT - THE TREES

covered with waiting birds.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

getting into car.

Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch

does the same with his door.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND

turning the key. The motor springs to life.

FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR

anticipation on all the faces.

FULL SHOT - THE CAR

from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is

still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it

passes the gate and starts down the road.

MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small

fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact.

The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the

road.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW

She gasps quickly.

MED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE

standing, waiting silently.

FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

as the tension begins to starts.

MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

as they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with

waiting seagulls.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

seeing them. Her lip begins to tremble.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

turning toward the side of the road ahead.

FULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V.

covered with waiting birds.

MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE

as the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front

porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his

hands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded

window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap.

CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

reacting.

FULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V.

as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding

road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still-

standing wires, watching, waiting.

FULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as

the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of

birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every

pole, on every fence.

MED. SHOT - MITCH

as he stops the car and looks ahead.

FULL SHOT - THE CAR

in the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

frightened, try not to reveal her fear.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR

There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest

reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing,

who makes the decision.

FULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR

as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow

rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

as she turns to look out the window on her side.

CLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS

as the car moves past them slowly.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

closing her eyes.

FULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE

through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with

birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all

over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the

open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the

gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken

windows.

TWO SHOT - CATHY, MITCH

The tension on their faces,

MED. SHOT - THE STORES OPPOSITE THE TIDES

as the car approaches them. The windows are all broken, and

merchandise is lying on the sidewalk. Birds are everywhere,

waiting.

CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD MAN

lying on the sidewalk, clutching a television set in his

arms.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

strained, looking at the road ahead.

LONG SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD

a clear sky, a bird-free stretch,

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

FULL SHOT - THE CAR - EXTERIOR

as Mitch rams the accelerator to the floor and it zooms ahead

in a burst of speed.

FULL SHOT - THOUSANDS OF BIRDS

taking wing.

MED. SHOT - MORE BIRDS

taking wing.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

screaming.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

wrenching at the wheel as the car turns a bend.

FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD

through the windshield, as a flock of birds take wing

immediately ahead.

CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDSHIELD

from the inside, as birds flutter against it.

CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF OF THE CAR

from the inside, as a beak slashes it, letting in a thin

line of light.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

wrenching at the wheel again, another bend.

HELICOPTER SHOT - THE CAR

navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it

in straight lines.

TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over

their heads, letting in more light.

CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF

More slashes, more light in scattered beams.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the

memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the

owl.

CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF

more slashes, building, the beak thrusts combining with the

incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

MED. SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all the passengers, as the roof

suddenly rips back.

FULL SHOT - BIRDS

from inside the car, hovering over it the moment the roof

tears back.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

This is too much for her. She screams at sight of the birds,

and then turns her face into Lydia's shoulder.

TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

as Lydia recognizes Melanie's need. She puts her arm around

Melanie's shoulder and gently, soothingly, holds her close.

FULL SHOT - THE CAR

racing along as the birds hover over it.

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

his face screwed in anguish, tears rolling down his cheeks

as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal.

FULL SHOT - THE OPEN CAR

streaming canvas ribbons behind it. It turns another bend in

the road.

FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - (THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD)

It is arrow-straight, no curves.

FULL SHOT - THE CAR

in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway. It begins

to outdistance the birds. The gap widens. A flock of birds

attacks it from the side of the road, but it speeds into

them and through them. The gap grows wider and wider. They

are well ahead of the birds now.

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

only a nod, his face streaming tears.

LONG SHOT - THE CAR (BIRDS' P.O.V.)

as they fall way behind now, the car moving swiftly into the

distance.

TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

on the back seat. Melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release

of tension. Lydia, in compassion, and tenderly, cradles

Melanie's head on her shoulder. Melanie, her eyes glistening,

looks ahead through the windshield.

FULL SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR

all their faces visible.

There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the

wind. Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension.

They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint

their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches

up to turn down the sun visor.

FULL SHOT - THE CAR

moving AWAY FROM THE CAMERA FAST into magnificent sunrise

over the crest of the hills. Further and further into the

distance it goes.
