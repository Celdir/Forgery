That spun things a bit. Speck pauses.

Speck's so thrown now he can't answer.

O'Ryan silences him... by holding up a piece of paper. On it

is a DRAWING. The image faces away from us. But Speck can see

it in rich detail. And his eyes go wide.

We catch GLIMPSES: The color of flesh. A body-part. Looks like

a rendering of a young, naked WOMAN.

And, just like that, Speck finds himself STARING. Glued.

O'Ryan lowers it and slides a SECOND DRAWING over... Speck is

speechless, transfixed. Can't look away.

O'Ryan slides over DRAWING #3. Again, we don't get to see it.

And we still haven't seen all of O'Ryan's face.

But we can see Speck, and his reaction. Utter horror. In fact

he recoils so violently that his coffee spills.

He rises, leaving the drawings behind. We STAY WITH HIM as he

crosses the diner - deeply unsettled. He reaches the Manager,

(MEL, balding, 50, in no mood) at the register.

He turns, to point out O'Ryan.

...but the booth, suddenly, is empty. The guy has simply

disappeared, taking those drawings with him.

Speck tightens. Mel eyes him, annoyed.

Charlton eyes him. It's irritating being corrected by a guy

you outrank, especially when he's right.

That was a jab, but we don't know it yet. Charlton puts on his

gloves. Mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that Minox,

looking over the rest of this car, as:

Granger's by the trunk. Before Mackelway can comment, Jumbo

has tossed a CROWBAR down from the top of the embankment: a

ten-pound hunk of iron, flying right at us.

Everybody ducks... as it CLANGS on the roof of the Buick.

Jumbo shrugs.

Mackelway shakes his head. "Shitkicker." Granger grabs the

crowbar. He's just about to open the trunk as:

Granger pauses. Mackelway crosses to the trunk, and snaps off

a few shots with the Minox.

Something catches his eye, along the line of the TRUNK. He

kneels closer... An odd RESIDUE, crusty and hard, has formed a

thin line on top of the paint in a single post.

He takes out a VIAL, and scrapes some of the residue into it.

Then he sniffs it. Pauses...

He looks to Granger: now you can open the trunk.

She slides that FOURTH DRAWING to Charlton - giving us our

first look at it.

INSERT - THE DRAWING:

...a STEAMER-TRUNK, lined with plastic. Inside it are large

ZIPLOC BAGS. Inside the bags are BODY PARTS.

It's realized so accurately that it looks more like a

photograph. No wonder it horrified Speck so deeply.

THE BOOTH - RESUMING

Charlton eyes it without reaction.

Plausible enough, until:

Without embellishing any further, he slides over the

PHOTOGRAPHS that he took this morning with the Minox: tire-

tracks, foot-prints. She eyes them.

Then she eyes Mackelway. Charlton notes the tension.

There is plenty going unsaid here between Mackelway and Fran.

Charlton has no time for it.

He tosses a 9-by-12 ENVELOPE at Mackelway, who opens it. Six

sheets of paper slide out.

First one we see is the TOP SHEET of a FAX: same hand-written

inscription as the last one: "Attention, Agent Thomas

Mackelway, FBI Resident Agency, Wichita Falls."

Okay. This is twice now. He knows what will be under this top

sheet without even looking. But here's Page One:

A photo of a middle-aged African-American WOMAN. Across the

top of the photo, in hand-writing: "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?"

And typed on the bottom: "Tanya Green. Age 42. Ht. 5'9", Wt.

165, Eyes Blk, Hair Blk. Last Seen: Ames, Iowa. Date of

Disappearance: 3-22-97."

The following four sheets bring four more faces: men, women,

young, old. Four more HAVE YOU SEEN ME's.

But before he can think it through, he hears:

They turn. That came from the NIGHT MANAGER: a humorless guy

named LES. He's looking at the front door, through which Dolly

has just entered. Pink cowboy boots tonight.

The Manager now throws a glance at the three feds in the

booth. Dolly stops short, taken aback.

Dyson half-chuckles; he always liked the guy... He throws open

the locker. Inside, nothing. Mackelway indicates the next

locker. Dyson works the combination.

Locker #2 is opened - also empty. Only one locker left.

Mackelway shrugs: "Sorry, it has to be opened." Dyson sighs,

then works the combination. Mackelway waits.

Locker #3 is opened. Inside, nothing incriminating: a sweater,

some old junk, two trophies. Dyson eyes him: "See?" Mackelway

nods. Dyson shuts the locker.

Mackelway looks to that wall: 1,000 copies of the circle-with-

a-slash-through-it. No idea what they signify...

Dyson heads for the stairs. They're wooden slats with more

basement-junk stored below: old sporting equipment, an old

vaccuum cleaner, broken chairs, rusted patio furniture.

Mackelway follows. They climb...

They stop. Something just caught Mackelway's eye, visible

beneath these stairs: a BOX, with a bucket of PAINT sticking

out of it...

Mackelway passes, eyeing those newly-faxed pages: five more

HAVE YOU SEEN ME'S... He reaches the door.

Mackelway stops, turns.

Great. Mackelway reaches for the front door again. Then he

halts. Maybe this guy can be helpful. Mackelway turns:

Piper nods.

Mackelway eyes him, then approaches, holding up a copy of that

image: the circle-with-slash-through-it.

Composite Artist keeps trying, but his attempt doesn't look

anything like the face of O'Ryan.

Charlton, meanwhile, stands over the body, mind racing.

A Missouri Highway Patrol car pulls up. Mackelway steps out of

it. We follow him as he takes in the scene.

A FLASHBULB illuminates Starkey's CHEST; is got a zero-with-

a-slash-through-it. But Mackelway hasn't seen the guy's face

yet.

Mackelway pales.

We stay on him for a moment as it registers. The man he

caught, and then lost, has killed again. No. God, no.

Mackelway pauses, thinks he must've heard wrong. But he turns

toward the face, as ANOTHER FLASHBULB illuminates it, searing

the image into the darkness. Starkey. Dead. His eyelids ripped

away.

Mackelway stares, stunned. Can't fucking believe it.

Mackelway continues, as:

Mackelway turns. In comes Fran.

Mackelway nods. Then they both turn... Charlton enters the

room.

Charlton approaches the map: 1,242 cities, circled in red.

Mackelway continues with the yellow pins: one for every HAVE

YOU SEEN ME? (45 of them so far.)

Charlton eyes the stack. 45 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's... Then the

map: 1,242 cities. Each with a DATE beside it.

(Mackelway has put a yellow pin beside a dozen cities... but

tiny Greenville, Texas has a BLUE PIN beside it.)

He pulls out a fax from the stack: a Korean boy named "Steven

Kim. Age 16. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date of Disappearance:

8-7-98."

The DATE on O'Ryan's map reads "10-26" beside Greenville, Tx.

So Greenville gets the only blue pin on this map.

Charlton notes today's date: October 17...

55   INT. FBI OFFICE - "O'RYAN ROOM" - NIGHT                          55

(Some of the HAVE YOU SEEN ME's have arrived via U.S. MAIL. We

see a stack of ENVELOPES in a box, each sealed in PLASTIC,

each stamped and addressed to Mackelway.)

Mackelway eyes the map, puzzling. Fran's right beside him.

Assorted papers and leads fill this room, including photos he

took himself with that Minox.

Mackelway's been asking himself that same question lately.

PHONE RINGS. She grabs it.

She hears the answer, then covers the phone.

She hands him the phone...

There's a COLLECTION here in a glass case: ANCIENT WEAPONS -

crude knives, swords, blow-darts. Mackelway notes them.

Mackelway looks over Daitz' bookshelf: volume after volume

about evil, the devil, the minds of sociopaths, the history of

serial-killers, ritual killers, tribal rites...

Mackelway pauses, considering that.

Mackelway is silent: Something's off here. But he can't say

for sure just yet what it is...

That wasn't just the echo of a question he's heard before; it

was a red flag. A big one. Mackelway tightens.

Mackelway eyes those books on evil, then those ancient

weapons... Casually, almost imperceptibly, he reaches for his

sidearm, as O'Ryan continues:

The more he talks, the closer Mackelway comes to extracting

that gun...

Then, disturbing the silence, a KNOCK at the door.

O'Ryan rises, goes to the door... as Mackelway unholsters his

gun. O'Ryan opens the door. Standing here is a COED, with a

backpack. She looks confused.

Mackelway nods.

The truth? Charlton has him pegged. But:

Hold it. That was a major exaggeration, if not an outright

lie. Mackelway eyes her, thrown. She's poker-faced.

Charlton, however, seems unmoved...

Mackelway eyes her: "Thanks for trying." She nods.

coffee table.

She smiles tightly: "I have to go now" and heads for the

kitchen. Once she's there, Mackelway turns to the BACK DOOR

and UNLOCKS IT, eyeing that storm-cellar outside...

She leaves the cup in the sink. He enters the kitchen.

She half-smiles. He turns to the door. Turns back.

He shrugs, dismissing it:

Jan pauses for a moment, as if recovering a faint memory...

Then she shakes it off. He lets it go.

Trooper notes the shape of that large, sheathed KNIFE - the

one O'Ryan butchered Starkey with - visible beneath O'Ryan's

shirt.

O'Ryan takes the knife off his hip. The size of it gets some

attention from the Trooper.

No reply. O'Ryan drops the menacing knife to the ground and

kicks it toward the Trooper.

Trooper, slowly, kneels down to get it - never taking his eyes

off O'Ryan.

Then we hear a BEEP. Call-Waiting. Great.

That irritated her. Mackelway clicks over.

Mackelway's eyes go wide.

CLICK. O'Ryan's just hung up.

He stares at the phone, then clicks over again, re-connecting

to Fran.

BEEP. Call-Waiting again.

Mackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye.

Sounds like O'Ryan just laughed... Then, another curve:

That was unsettling. Very. Mackelway looks around feeling

violated, feeling "watched." He draws the blinds. Double bolts

the front door. Runs his hand under the window frame for any

kind of wire tapping.

But Mackelway won't allow himself to over-react. Not now, with

O'Ryan on the phone.

O'Ryan laughs. He liked that.

How the hell did he know that? It's unsettling.

Charlton's at a loss... until Mackelway gestures to the table,

where he has laid out O'Ryan's entire FBI File. Every memo,

citation, letter, i.d. picture. 150 pages.

Charlton eyes it, calmly. He's not going to let his jaw drop,

not with Mackelway watching. So he just nods.

A beat. Mackelway lets the silence hover.

Charlton heads for the door.

Charlton stops. Turns.

Mackelway tosses over a few pages from O'Ryan's file.

Charlton eyes the pages without comment.

Mackelway's referring to that DRAWING: a steamer-trunk, filled

with ghastly Ziploc bags:

Charlton studies him, a long beat, measuring him... Then:

(Neither city is represented with black pins on that map.)

She slides over a packet of PHOTOS: two FEMALE VICTIMS,

photographed in separate morgues - face up, face down, waist

and above, waist and below, etc.

Mackelway eyes them, then leaves the room. We STAY WITH

FRAN... taking in that O'Ryan FBI file. It troubles her.

Mackelway returns, carrying the 9-by-12 envelope that Katie

gave to him.

She breathes out an ironic laugh. He hands over the envelope,

opens it. Inside: that photo of Karen Sumpter. Mackelway

didn't pay much attention to it before.

Fran eyes the photo, then the vitals.

Fran doesn't look up from the photo.

She half-smiles: "You mean the one you've been fucking?" He

shrugs, confirming nothing - wishing Fran weren't quite so

smart. She puts the photo back into the envelope.

That confused her.

That confused him.

She hands him the material on Karen Sumpter.

He grabs the material, looks at it for the first time:

"Karen Sumpter, Age 25. Ht. 5'6", Wt. 110. Eyes Blu, Hair

Blnd. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date of Disappearance: 10-26-

00."

Mackelway looks to the Conference Table - that huge stack of

faxes, all those helpless faces.

The one on top is the one that came in last night: Lloyd

Simms, Age 9. Ht. 4'10", Wt. 67 lbs. Last Seen: Greenville,

Texas. Date of Disappearance: 10-26-99.

At last, a pattern. A break.

Mackelway grabs the Simms fax, hurries out of the room.

Nearest Agent is Grieves. Mackelway hands him the fax.

Grieves has done this on fifty different faxes now; it never

yields their suspect, but:

Mackelway leans back in to the O'Ryan Room.

That's the million-dollar question, and it hangs there.

Mackelway's about to answer... when he stops himself. Just

noticing something. That MORGUE PHOTO from Logan, Utah:

There's a BURN MARK on the lower left calf of the victim.

We've seen such a mark before, on another autopsy photo.

He doesn't answer, just hurries to a thick BOX OF OTHER

AUTOPSY FILES AND PHOTOS. Starts rifling through them...

...until he finds the one we've seen before. The body from

Trenton. He extracts it. Eyes it. A confirmation...

He lays the two PHOTOS side by side. Looks to Fran.

Fran eyes the photos. No doubt about it - they both have the

same burn mark on the lower left calf: a symmetrical, almost

horizontal stripe across the flesh.

Mackelway pulls the car over, under an I-30 overpass... and

out comes his gun, pointed right at O'Ryan's forehead.

O'Ryan can't help it. He's pleased.

Silence... Then that CEL-PHONE rings. Must be Fran.

Mackelway eyes him: are you kidding? It rings again.

Ring #3. Mackelway grabs the phone.

179   INT. TRUCK-STOP - DINER - GREENVILLE - SAME (DAY)                 179

180   INT. A THIRD UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                      180

A few feet away, O'Ryan sits in a chair, calmly peeling the

skin off of an apple with that huge HUNTING KNIFE of his. A

CANDLE flickers on the floor by his feet.

There was a delight to that question - we can see it on

O'Ryan's face. Mackelway, of course, can't reply due to the

gag. But the answer's obvious.

All Mackelway can see is his own reflection - the fear in his

eyes - bouncing off a mirror that's only inches away.

Slowly, he lowers the knife into the flame of that candle on

the floor. It GLOWS. Good God...

Mackelway tries to speak. It's impossible.

O'Ryan pulls the GAG from his mouth, just long enough for

Mackelway to say:

O'Ryan jams the gag back into his mouth, angrily.

Mackelway absorbs that - watches himself absorb it - then

looks to that bed. Can't quite see what's under it...

O'Ryan eyes the flames as they dance over the blade.

With that, he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame. It is

RED-HOT. Even looking at it is painful.

But Mackelway can't look at anything else.

Just like that, that red-hot knife is an inch from Mackelway's

face. The heat alone makes his head jerk back. Wisps of smoke

rise from its edge.

And Mackelway is forced to watch his own reaction to it.

He struggles against these ropes, to no use. A guttural sound

comes out of him.

O'Ryan's hand lashes out a bit, leaving the sizzling knife

just under Mackelway's chin. The anticipation of pain is

unbearable. And Mackelway is reading it in his own eyes...

Two things hit at once: 1) This monster is about to torture me

to death. 2) Please, God, don't let me give him the

satisfaction of seeing me cry...

O'Ryan moves the blade again, this time an eighth of an inch

above Mackelway's right arm. The heat from it is so incendiary

that Mackelway's shirt begins to smoke.

Mackelway's shirt is officially on fire now. The pain is

awful. He stares at his own reflection.

...as tears begin to flow from his eyes. He can't stop them.

That bounces off the walls. Mackelway shuts his eyes tight -

can't watch this anymore.

Mackelway opens his eyes, forced to watch himself break. Deep

sobs shudder through him, as...

O'Ryan digs that red-hot blade into Mackelway's arm:

Mackelway sees the answer in his own reflection: Yes, I am

terrified. He SHRIEKS, the sound muffled by that gag.

With his body able to do no more than spasm, he jerks his head

forward, smashing it into that mirror. THE MIRROR SHATTERS,

obliterating the image.

...and everything goes black.

182   INT. THAT UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT                   182

I'm in the same motel room. I'm on a bed. I'm alive. There's

O'Ryan. Everything hurts. No, it's just my right arm. But it

is searing.

The check-list continues: my mouth is sore, but that GAG has

been removed.

And MY ARMS ARE UNBOUND. Legs too. Maybe I am dead.

Mackelway tries to move his hand. It takes some effort.

Everything's foggy. But he puts it before his face. Turns it.

Flexes it. Squeezes it. His hand... He stares at it.

Then he notices his SHOULDER. A fat BANDAGE has been wrapped

around it - covering up the source of that searing pain. Looks

as though a nurse had tended to it.

But this sure as hell isn't a hospital...

Then, O'Ryan turns, facing us. Mackelway recoils without

meaning to.

But O'Ryan's demeanor has changed. That look of possessed

malevolence - it's gone now. We can't imagine why.

Mackelway pauses, rewinding that one.

Mackelway is still bracing for torture, or at least combat. So

he's a step behind.

O'Ryan rises, crossing toward us. Even unbound, Mackelway is

expecting another onslaught... But all O'Ryan does is drop a

piece of paper onto Mackelway's lap.

It's another DRAWING: of a RANCH-HOUSE, with a windmill in the

background. Crude, but just specific enough. Mackelway's still

too unwound to speak...

Mackelway's starting to understand now. This was an act. An

initiation. That stuns him...

Mackelway eyes him - utter disbelief.

O'Ryan smiles warmly - like a Drill Sergeant at the end of

Basic: Sorry I was so hard on you but it had to be done... Can

we shake on it?

Instead, Mackelway simply EXPLODES:

It is a blur, faster than a blur, but Mackelway rises with an

animal roar, knocking O'Ryan flat on his back.

Then Mackelway is upon him.

All the helplessness, all the horror, the images of watching

himself in that mirror, the sounds of his own uncontrollable

sobbing... they ERUPT now into violence.

It is an overwhelming force. O'Ryan can't begin to fight it

off. Mackelway has one hand on O'Ryan's throat. The other hand

comes down like a sledgehammer.

One blow. Then another. The sounds coming out of Mackelway are

savage, barely human. He's out of control.

O'Ryan's eyes roll back. Mackelway now puts both hands around

this fucker's throat. He's going to kill him - right here.

He's going to squeeze the life from him.

This is a Mackelway we've never met before. His eyes are wild,

hateful - even as the last gasps of breath rasp their way out

of O'Ryan's throat.

Then Mackelway is distracted, for just a second. No. Less than

a second... by a glimpse of that SHATTERED MIRROR - his own

twisted image.

He looks away from it, refusing to be distracted, determined

to kill this guy.

...then those eyes drift back to the mirror again.

...and he sees his reflection: a hardened, crazed stranger. An

animal.

His hands, without warning, release their grip.

That was said flatly, matter-of-factly. It's chilling.

He pauses.

Oh. Mackelway doesn't reply...

Mackelway lets that sink in, as he stares at passing head-

lights. Then:

Zero freezes. Mackelway too. They turn to find:

O'Ryan... who stands here, Mackelway's gun in hand.

Mackelway's relief is total. He pushes Zero away, rising. Zero

pulls himself off the ground, chagrinned.

O'Ryan, without ceremony, puts a bullet through Zero's left

palm. That got Mackelway's attention.

Zero howls with pain, his palm gushing. The TIRE-IRON falls to

the ground. Mackelway approaches O'Ryan.

He extends his good hand to O'Ryan: "The gun." O'Ryan pauses.

Then...

O'Ryan wheels around, aiming the gun right at Zero's face.

That shuts the guy up in a hurry.

From that service road now, we hear a line of SIRENS,

approaching from a distance. Unit after unit.

O'Ryan turns, studies him.

...and hands him the gun. Just like that.

Mackelway eyes it. O'Ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses

back to Zero, and grabs that TIRE-IRON off the ground.

O'Ryan's now standing right behind Zero, as:

WHAP! O'Ryan just swung that tire-iron into Zero's rib cage.

We hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs. He

drops to his knees, gasping.

THUMP! Another violent swing of that tire-iron, busting up the

other side of Zero's torso. Now both sides of his rib-cage

have shattered. Breathing is almost impossible.

Mackelway tightens. His head just began to throb...

Another swing of that tire-iron, across the back of Zero's

neck. He crumbles, face down.

Fuck it. Mackelway crosses to O'Ryan and puts that gun right

up against the back of O'Ryan's head.

Then, an odd thing... O'Ryan simply smiles.

Something about having that gun pointed right at him - it's a

relief.

That's something Mackelway doesn't want to consider.

He turns. They are face to face. Nothing but that gun between

them.

That threw Mackelway badly. O'Ryan seizes the moment -

wheeling around...

He takes one last swing at Zero, like a lumberjack. The tire-

iron impacts Zero's skull with a dull THUD, cracking it. He is

dead.

Mackelway's eyes go wide. Whole thing has been a blur.

O'Ryan releases the tire-iron... and drops to his knees like a

man awaiting execution, his back to Mackelway.

Mackelway is silent. Stunned. The blood from Zero's caved-in

skull finds its way to O'Ryan's knees.

But O'Ryan remains peaceful. Calm. Ready.

He puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun. Then he

pretends to pull the trigger. Mackelway gets the idea.

Mackelway doesn't know what to do. Then, making matters worse:

She's about a hundred yards away... but she'll be here soon

enough. That puts some heat under O'Ryan:

She's 90 yards out now...

Mackelway's frozen. O'Ryan knows it.

O'Ryan rises now, facing Mackelway.

He shoves Mackelway in the chest.

She's 70 yards out now...

50 yards out now. Maybe close enough to hear O'Ryan's voice...

Mackelway's not budging. O'Ryan can see that.

O'Ryan picks up that tire-iron. Mackelway sees what's coming.

O'Ryan swings the tire-iron as Mackelway backs out of its

range.

O'Ryan keeps pursuing. Another swing. Mackelway keeps backing

up. The swing misses.

O'Ryan isn't letting up. And Mackelway can't quite fire.

O'Ryan takes one more swing, as:

Silence. Mackelway turns. So does O'Ryan.

There's Fran, emerging from the tall wheat, gun trained right

on O'Ryan. His shock is total.

O'Ryan doesn't move at first. Then, slowly, an ironic smile

snakes its way across his lips.

Mackelway doesn't answer. He can't. O'Ryan eyes him.
