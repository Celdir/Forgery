TITLE SEQUENCE

As the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:

EXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY

A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,

surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."  Like modern demons.

Grotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of

their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,

broken glass teeth.

EXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY

Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized

flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series

of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of

sand and heat.

END CREDITS.

EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY

A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just

make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William

Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI.

The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON

SCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"

EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY

We're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning

against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about

sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,

almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,

the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a

scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield

narrows his eyes.

BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.

The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the

house.

He turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's

whittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY

The house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has

become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic

cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse

a little of what life here is like.

The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with

scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from

some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING

helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and

oppressive.

The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his

way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the

floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY

A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of

their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his

shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice

seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence.

All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -

wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL.

They watch Nix in adoration.

As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to

hand with casual ease...

NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,

together you will cleanse the world.

Butterfield enters.

Nix looks up.

Nix rises, smiling.

As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

A place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling

is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a

large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and

knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,

creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a

perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft

SOBBING.

Nix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and

presently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a

fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her

mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.

From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON.

Nix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.

The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring

its teeth as it screeches.

He unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,

trailing its chain.

Nix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon

starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS

catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.

Nix watches her terror dispassionately.

Butterfield exits.  Nix advances on the Girl.

EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY

The two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.

From the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old

with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not

conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking.

From the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,

studious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,

skinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a

steely gaze.

On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces

of METALWORK.  We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as

he slips them into his pocket.

Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.

Swann starts towards the House.  Jennifer is the first to

follow, with the other two on her heels.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Butterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.

Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.

Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself.  Swann follows

him.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAY

Quaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS

(three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is

breast-feeding a baby.

She smiles a crazy smile.  Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE

appears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils.

And now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the

Cultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns

away.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,

winding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and

drives his heel down on its head.

The Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door.

Snake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above

his head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.

INT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   "BEDROOM"   -  DAY

Jennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where

a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.

The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth

pressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,

of course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.

She pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into

her FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer

retreats to the door, and exits back out into --

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Pimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He

is ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from

his white-knuckled fingers.

Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY

Swann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to

his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side.

He turns the door handle.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

Swann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The

folds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a

muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room.

On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.

Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As

he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!

He reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half

dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann.

Swann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

On Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the

passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

PAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he

struggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the

ground beside her.

Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings

round.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque

altarpiece.

The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her

face.  Swann turns.

He reaches down to Swann.

Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying

gravity.

He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back

against the wall.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps

from the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's

hand.  BLOOD SPURTS.

She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

Nix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his

fingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a

psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.

Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold.

And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin

of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.

Swann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Quaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the

Sanctum door.  Jennifer is at Quaid's side.

Butterfield shakes his head.  Quaid FIRES.  The bullet.

strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head.  He retreats,

growling like a rabid animal.  Quaid kicks the Sanctum door

open, and enters.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his

eyes blood-red.

On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and

Jennifer.

of Quaid and Jennifer.  To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to

be MORPHING.  Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is

like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  PRIMEVAL MUCK.

Quaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his

head violently.

Swann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.

SWANN'S P.O.V.

of Nix, his arms outstretched in welcome.  His face has an

aura of pulsing light.

ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom.  The trigger is

pulled.

The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.

ON SWANN, staring at Nix.

SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies.

Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses

something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features.  A NIGHTMARE

FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its

forehead.

Swann covers his eyes.

Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his

knees, clutching the WOUND.  As he falls, he reveals the

ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.

Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind-

control.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAY

Pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

On Nix, doing just that:  rising up.  Right hand clamped to

his bloody chest, left hand reaching for Swann.

Quaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder.  And again.

Strikes his leg.  Nix collapses to the ground,

They have come prepared for this.  Swann now takes from his

jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK.  There are

SCREWS in then all.

He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an

eyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his

hands on the side of the mask, and  LIKE MAGIC -- his touch

makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into

Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs

from the screw-holes.

Now the second piece, over his MOUTH.

He's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like

the first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over

the nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into

place.

Swann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as

it continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as

each man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die?

And now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes

diminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the

ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

The Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix

had upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat,

their confidence and courage gone.

Pimm steps into the Sanctum.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

The five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's

body.  Swann has his arm around the Girl.

EXT. NIX'S .HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - DUSK

The wind has died away.  It's eerily calm.  Butterfield

dashes towards camera, then halts.

HE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE

into the back of Murray Pimm's bus.

ON Butterfield.  He watches, with a feral look on his face.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY

The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and

gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking

some fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and

congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.

ON SCREEN, the words:  "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"

EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DAY

The facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs

a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but

it has a certain charm.

INT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

A large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a

host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby.

At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands

HARRY D'AMOUR.  He is having difficulty getting the pretty

but vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his

name.

ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.

Harry turns.  He's wearing a washed-out Grateful Dead t-

shirt, an Italian cut linen suit, and glasses.  He's

handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.

Harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten-dollar

bills.

INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

On the suit-case, which is now on the bed.  Harry flings it

open.  Inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection

of items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet.  A GUN.  A

CRUCIFIX.  A STATUE of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of creation and

destruction.

ON HARRY, as he heads into the bathroom.  Turns on the

shower.  Starts to undress.

EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DUSK

Harry, his hair still wet from his shower, steps out into the

sun.  Squints.  Puts on sunglasses.

EXT. MELROSE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a

classy restaurant.  It's RAINING.

ON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty

WOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window.

Tapert makes a joke (unheard).  The woman laughs.

ON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape

recorder.

On Tapert, as he rises from the table.

Tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street. Harry

tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car.

EXT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

Harry pulls the parking ticket off the windshield, screws it

up and gets in.

INT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

He turns the key in the ignition.

EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - SILVERLAKE - NIGHT

In neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window.  It

reads:  TAROT CARD AND CRYSTAL READINGS - $15 SPECIAL

ON TAPERT, as he hurries across the street, and through the

door beside the store window.

WE PAN OFF the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far

side of the street.

Harry gets out of the car.  Stares at the sign in the window,

puzzled.

He starts across the street.  Suddenly:

Tapert emerges, his face white with terror.  He stumbles to

his car, and he's away.  Harry freezes, caught between the

need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the

latter, and steps inside.

INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

An illuminated ARROW points up the stairs.  Harry ascends,

past faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.

At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry

halts, and takes out his GUN.

There's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the

corner.  Harry chances a look.  There's a short length of

passageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a

CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is

the source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it

falls down the stairs.

Dead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open

door.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.  The fake antique

FURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.

INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

There are two offices.  In the front, a Waiting Room, into

which Harry now steps.  Beyond it, through a door that stands

narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room.

From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.

Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for

his gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the

shadows.

His name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth

sharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle

of his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and

goes for his throat.

Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST

and SMASHES it on Miller's skull.

Miller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the

Fortune Telling Room.

INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT

A mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a

table.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been

tortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude

from his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the

table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.

Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.

Harry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the

door.

Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it.

As he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A

FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his

late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long

hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -

one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield.

His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.

Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs

in pain.

Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the

other side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock

out.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.

As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the

door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other

side.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being

pitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of

defense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the

table.  Behind it a WINDOW.

Suddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller

CHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him

against the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down

around Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in.

Butterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the

scalpel from his hands.

Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the

folds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's

belly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,

which SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT.

Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already

making his escape.  Harry starts after him.

He turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry

goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the

stairs.

Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand.

Quaid stares at Harry's HAND.  Fascinated, he momentarily

forgets his pain.  He traces the lines with bloody fingers.

Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip.  Quaid winces in

pain.

Quaid shudders, and dies.

He looks away, down at the CARDS.  All have been turned over

but ONE.  He turns it.  The card is the Ten of Swords which

pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by

all ten swords.  An image of death and desolation.

EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - ALLEY BEHIND BUILDING - NIGHT

The flashing LIGHTS of two patrol cars illuminate the scene.

DETECTIVE EDDISON, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut

blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry.  He's midway

through taking Harry's statement. There are already two

OFFICERS examining the drapes.  We can't yet see the body.

OFFICER #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. Broken

GLASS drops from the folds, but that's all. Miller has gone.

WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, as he stares down at the drape.

INT. BUTTERFIELD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The rooms are spartan.  Nothing on the walls.  Nothing on the

floors.  Very little furniture.

Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his

long hair.  There is something feminine about him now:  his

voice a whisper, his stare distracted.  If we didn't guess it

already, we're in the presence of a madman.

Miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of GLASS

out of his torso.  It hurts, but he's enjoying himself.

He stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass,

sighing with pleasure.

A long beat of silence.  Butterfield combs.  Miller digs for

glass.

Another silence.

EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET - MORNING

On screen:  Philadelphia

A suburban street.  Early morning light.

INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - PHILADELPHIA - MORNING

CLOSE-UP of a PHOTOGRAPH of the Cultist with the Painted

Face, from the opening scene, standing outside Nix's house in

Nevada.  His name is Norman Sanders.

ON NORMAN, thirteen years older, looking down at the

photograph.  He lays it down, beside a letter, on which two

words are written: "Homecoming Time."

Norman smiles to himself.  Goes to the wardrobe.  Gets out a

small suitcase.  His WIFE'S BODY is slumped in the wardrobe,

glassy-eyed.

CLOSE UP of letter -

INT. KITCHEN IN MIAMI HOUSE - DAY

- and DRAW OUT from the letter to a different interior, a

different domestic circumstance.

On the screen:  Miami.

BARBARA - the blonde girl who carved the cult's sigil into

her chest - is washing her hands.  She casually dries them,

and picks up the letter, walking past her HUSBAND and SON,

both DEAD at the breakfast table, BLOOD spreading around

their heads.  When she gets to the door she steps over the

body of her DAUGHTER, who has also been shot trying to escape

her mother's murder spree.

ON THE RADIO, George Harrison sings "My Sweet Lord."

EXT. SAN ANTONIO 200 - REPTILE HOUSE - DAY

On screen:  San Antonio.

A ZOO-KEEPER wanders into the darkened interior of the

Reptile House.

INT. REPTILE HOUSE - DAY

The Zoo-keeper's benign expression changes at the sight of

the chaos inside.  The glass cases have been SMASHED. Another

KEEPER lies on the ground, his face pulped.  A few SNAKES

slither around his body, but most of them have gone.

EXT. SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST'S CAR - DAY

The Snake-Handler Cultist drives at speed.

INT. SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST'S CAR - DAY

PAN UP from another letter'- with the same message - on the

dashboard, to the crazed face of the Snake-Handler. PAN TO

the back of the car.  IT SEETHES WITH HUNDREDS OF SNAKES.

EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - DAY

It's early morning in Bel-Air.  The sun shines down on a

millionaire's paradise:  a huge house surrounded by a jungle

of trees and blossoms.

EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - DAY

The blue water glitters in the noon-day sun.  And a WOMAN --

her body perfectly proportioned -- glides under the surface,

emerging at the shallow end, where the housekeeper CLEMENZIA

is setting a tray on a table.

Mrs. Swann's name is DOROTHEA.  She is a beautiful and

sensual woman.

She dries off.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - DAY

Venetian blinds shut out most of the sunlight, but a lamp

burns on the desk (huge), showing us the furniture (leather),

the books (innumerable), and the figure of SWANN, sitting

behind the desk smoking a CIGAR.  He's lost some hair and

some colour over the years, but he still has the same

hypnotic eyes.

He studies the L.A. TIMES in front of him.

ON THE OPEN PAGE

"Fortune Teller Brutally Murdered," the headline announces.

Underneath, a PHOTOGRAPH of Quaid's wrecked room.  WE CLOSE

IN on the photograph, and catch a glimpse of Harry, standing

looking at the chaos.  CAMERA. MOVES DOWN to the text

beneath, and on to the name "Harry D'Amour."

ON SWANN, pensive as he studies the paper.

He looks up, startled.

DOROTHEA The sun's shining out there. Dorothea is dressed in

a white robe now.  She literally brings light into this

gloomy room.  On the shelves behind Swann are a number of art

brut figurines, vaguely recalling the idols outside Nix's

"temple."

A difficult silence.  Then Swann crosses to the door.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - DAY

VALENTIN is overseeing the hanging of a new piece in Swann's

collection:  a huge, framed POSTER from a late nineteenth

century magic spectacular.  Valentin is fifty or so, his gray

hair combed back close to his scalp. Immaculately dressed in

a distinctively European fashion.  Precise.  Cautious.

Elegant.

He orders the TWO PICTURE-HANGERS in a clipped fashion.

Dorothea descends the stairs, dressed for the day.

Valentin nods.  They walk back through the house together,

while the picture-hanging goes on behind them.

She passes the newspaper to Valentin.  He looks down at it.

ON NEWSPAPER.

C.U. of Harry's blurred PICTURE.

INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Harry is sprawled on the bed, in his under shorts.  A shaft of

sun darts between the drapes, missing his face by inches.

Somebody is knocking on the door, hard.

He rolls over.  The sun strikes his eyes.  He winces.

Harry gets up and stumbles to the door.  He opens it a

little.  The face of VALENTIN is visible through the crack.

A beat.  Then Harry takes the chain off the door.

EXT. SANTA MONICA BLVD. - DAY

A white SEDAN glides along the boulevard.  At the wheel,

Valentin.  Beside him, Harry.

INT. SEDAN - DAY

Harry is eating a burrito and sipping coffee.

He pulls open the ashtray. Pulls out a cigar-butt.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - GATES - DAY

The sedan turns into a driveway.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

The sun beats down on a pristine panorama of palms and white

marble tombs.  Harry and Valentin walk towards a large

mausoleum.

Valentin gives him an inquisitive look.

Harry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman

in white standing in its cool shadows:  Dorothea Swann.  She

wears a wide-brimmed hat.

VALENTIN sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book.  He

glances up.

Harry and Dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in

conversation.

Harry makes an approving MURMUR.

Dorothea stops talking.  Takes off her sunglasses.  Her gaze

is troubled, but direct.  There is an attraction between the

two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.

Harry, frowns.

Dorothea stares at him.

Dorothea LAUGHS lightly.

The question catches Dorothea off guard.

Dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.  Harry watches

her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her

departing figure.

INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

Harry's talking on the phone while he dresses for the

theatre.

INT. LOOMIS' OFFICE - MEW YORK - NIGHT

LOOMIS, a slob of a man, is in his office, eating pizza.

INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

Harry can't help but smile to himself.

Click.  Harry puts down the phone.  Glances at himself in the

mirror.  Raises a rueful eyebrow.

EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - NIGHT

CRANE DOWN from a looming STANDEE of Swann, perched above the

theatre marquee.  SPOTLIGHTS rake the skies. The sidewalk

below is jammed with AUDIENCE MEMBERS, STAR-SPOTTERS and

PHOTOGRAPHERS.  This is a flashy, prestigious event.  LIMOS

are disgorging scantily- dressed STARLETS and smiling MONEY

MEN; a NEWS TEAM is interviewing audience members as they

file in.

The atmosphere is noisy and excited.  Amid the throng, Harry.

He makes his way inside.

INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a

conventional stage show.  Security people with walkie-

talkies roam the aisles; the audience buzzes with barely

controlled hysteria.

Harry heads down the aisle, eyes on the stage.  A star-lit

CURTAIN covers it.  Six rows from the stage is Dorothea,

already in her seat.  She smiles lavishly, happy to see him.

Harry takes a seat beside her.

INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

Center-stage, behind the closed curtains, Swann is ready for

the opening of the show.  TECHNICIANS buzz around him like

flies.

Valentin emerges from the wings, patting the PANTHER that is

waiting there.

Valentin nods.

ON SWANN, his expression unreadable.

MUSIC strikes up.  A dramatic, Wagnerian chord. Valentin

hurries away.  Swann's expression becomes very focused.

Swann rises up into the flies.

INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

The LIGHTS are DIMMING.  Harry glances across at Dorothea,

whose gaze is intent.

The LIGHTS go OUT.  The MUSIC SWELLS, and the CURTAINS fly

apart.  A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to

blast our senses!  Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride

into mystery.

A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the

stage.

The vortex BLAZES --

And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor

of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor

toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE.

Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR

miraculously appears in his grasp.  He descends on the

dragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the

Devil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon.

The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.  Then the head cracks

open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily

dressed DANCERS, male and female.  Swann throws down the

spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears.

A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience.  Swann's plain white

tunic falls away from him as he descends.  By the time his

feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO.

The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a

crescendo.  The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance.  In the

sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.

A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt.

The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly.

ON HARRY and Dorothea.

INT. WILTERN THEATRE - LOBBY - NIGHT

The doors SQUEAK as a gust of WIND blows through them.

Butterfield stands in the lobby, listening to the muted

SOUNDS of MUSIC and APPLAUSE.  Then he offers his ticket to

the TICKET-COLLECTOR and steps inside.

INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

A new musical motif hangs in the air:  MUSIC announcing

danger.

The AUDIENCE watches intently, nervously.

ON HARRY and DOROTHEA.

ON STAGE, Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL, while the

DANCERS, dressed like Boschian DEMONS, cavort around him,

somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME.

It's a scene from Daniels Inferno.  Above him. a dozen

glittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending.  He

struggles to free himself.  The MUSIC gets more exciting as

the wheel spins faster and faster.

Suddenly, a sword DROPS.  It falls between Swann's

outstretched legs, skewering the wheel.  Then ANOTHER, close

to his head.

ON HARRY.  He's tense.  Excited.

BACK TO STAGE.  Swann is free I  He throws off the last

shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the

wheel.  There's a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS.

The wheel slows.  He starts to step off it, as another of the

the swords DROPS.

The AUDIENCE GASPS.  Swann smiles, and TRIPS.

As he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back,

carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning

him there.  Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort.  Some

stop.

More GASPS from the audience.

ON HARRY, having a --

FLASHBACK:  Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card.

The scene on the stage is that image coming to life.

ON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a

third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth,

until TEN SWORDS have entered his body.

ON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not.

The MUSIC has stopped.  In the silence, somebody GIGGLES

nervously.  A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it

dies away in a matter of moments.

ON DOROTHEA AND HARRY

ON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his

wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death.  He

reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead.

There are GASPS now from the audience.  Murmurs of disgust;

sobs of horror.

The curtains start to close.

ON Dorothea, tears of shock filling her eyes.

The AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've

seen sinks in.  There is panic.  A few people have fainted.

One or two are even praying.

Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea

against the flood of the exiting crowd.

He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so

she can duck beneath it.

INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

Chaos.  PEOPLE running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing

watching.  Valentin is already at the body, with the STAGE

MANAGER at his side.

He starts to physically push the crowd back.  Harry grabs his

arm.

Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE

MANAGER out of Dorothea's way.  She goes to Swann's body,

which has been removed from the wheel.

INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The audience is clearing now.  But Butterfield is coming

towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he

enraged?  Or puzzled?  Or both?

Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage.

Butterfield enters.

INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

Dorothea kneels at Swann's side.  A few yards from her, Harry

examines the mechanism of the wheel.

A DOCTOR appears.

The Doctor checks Swann's body.

Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device.

He's suspicious.  He slips round to the back of the

mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the

cable as he goes.

WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT

It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are

used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the

beginning.  From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted

and echoing.

The cable ends in bare wires.  Whatever was here has been

taken.

A NOISE, behind Harry.  He swings round.  Sees a shadowy

FIGURE ducking away.

He gives chase.  Loses the man in the shadows.  Stops and

listens for movement.

Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of

wood and smashes it into Harry's face!

Harry reels back.  Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his

nose.  Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.

Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  And now, out of

the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield.

Harry is barely holding on to consciousness.

Butterfield is a foot from Harry now.

Butterfield hits him.

Butterfield hits him again.

Butterfield comes a little closer.

Butterfield leans in.  And Harry grabs him by the balls --

literally -- rising as he does so.

Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground

in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from

Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun.

He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches.  Harry catches hold

of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who

TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  The GUN GOES

OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW

MECHANISM.

Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the

dragon's steel teeth.  He has Harry in his sights.

-- something CREAKS.  He looks up.  The dragon's jaw is

closing, FAST.  He starts to scramble to his feet.  Too late!

The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body.  Sudden death.

Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the

shadows.  Then he's gone.  Harry looks down at Miller's

BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet.

INT. POLICE STATION - EDDISON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised.

Eddison has just finished taking his statement.

Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea

being taken into another office.

INT. POLICE STATION - OTHER OFFICE - NIGHT

Dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall.  Harry enters.

The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean L.A., it

means near -Dorothea.  And by the tiny smile on her face,

it's also plain she knows it.

EXT. MAGIC SHOP - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY

Noon.  Bright sun.  Busy street.  Harry, now wearing a

bandage on his cut face, enters.

INT. MAGIC SHOP - DAY

A wonderland for illusionists.  Books, props, masks, tricks,

etc.  Two or three CUSTOMERS browse.  Harry glances at them

all, then targets a MAN in late middle age, who is browsing

through books, one-handed.  His other hand constantly

manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen

ways.  He doesn't even look at his hand.  His name is WALTER

WILDER.

Harry stands beside him.  Scans the shelf.

Walter beams.

He hands Harry a card.

Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the

rest of this conversation.

Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to

manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.

EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK

The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm.

Harry and Walter wander towards the front door.  Harry is

knotting a newly-bought tie.

INT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

The interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with

illusionists' posters.

Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms

where illusionists are performing close-up magic for

audiences of well-heeled patrons.  Walter nods and waves to

half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the

stairs and towards the bar.

Wilder points to a locked door.

INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT

Later.  A drunken VINOVICH is holding court.  He's in his

40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and

fake) middle-European accent.  At the table - besides Harry

and Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend

LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and

two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown,

overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin,

waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the AMAZING QUENTIN.

In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry

repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.

Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether

he's being sarcastic or not.

The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies.  Furtive glances are

exchanged around the table.  Only Billy Who makes a tiny

smile.

Vinovich begins to look suspicious.

Vinovich rises.

Harry rises.  Looks straight at Vinovich, unintimidated.

She rises.

He stalks away.  Harry calls after him, across a now-

silenced bar.

EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Harry heads to the car.

Harry turns.  Billy approaches, glancing behind him to see

that he's not being watched.

Billy hurries away.

INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Harry lies on his bed, dozing.  The CAMERA CREEPS IN on him.

Harry frowns in his semi-doze.

FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

The image darkens, and fades up a beat later on Quaid.

INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Harry is still asleep.

FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

A long silence.

SUDDENLY, a telephone RINGS.

INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

HARRY sits up, shocked awake.

He picks up the receiver.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

She sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing

else, drinking a SCOTCH, talking on the phone. The primary

source of illumination is the massive T.V. set in the wall

opposite the bed.

INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange.

Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by

the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and

touch them.

As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title

page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Valentin, on the kitchen PHONE, is listening in.

INTERCUTTING: HARRY - DOROTHEA - VALENTIN

DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM

She's a little uncomfortable now.

She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch.

She's shaking.  She gets up.  Paces the room. Then she picks

up the phone again.

INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by

Harry's doodles.  The phone RINGS.

CUT WIDE:  The room is empty.

EXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry

heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of

Quaid's Waiting Room.

It has been locked and taped by the police.  Harry has come

prepared.  He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the

locks.

INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT

Harry enters, FLASHLIGHT on.  He crosses the Waiting Room and

enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died.  On the

TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS,

Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the

blood-spattered table:

Harry is spooked.  He starts to search the room, opening

cabinets and drawers.  Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac

are stashed everywhere.  Boxes of crystals, religious

statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.

He pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged

in a niche at the base of the drawer.  He pulls the drawer

out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it.

Using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart.  It has a

false bottom.

In the secret compartment, some papers and an address book.

He flicks to "D."

There it is.  Jennifer Desiderio, and an address.  He pockets

the book.  Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out

his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing --

-- Valentin!

Harry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin.

He glances back at Valentin.

EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM, PASADENA - DAY

ON THE ADDRESS BOOK, in Harry's hands.

Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a

building, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".

INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY

The place is bland and functional throughout, the walls

decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings.

Nothing disturbing.  Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER -

black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse.

INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY

Toffler excorts Harry through -the place.  There are

distressing scenes on every side.  Nothing melodramatic no

screaming, no fits.  Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair.

Blank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms.

They've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting

outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us.

Jennifer turns.  She looks terrible.

EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY

Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the

Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout

the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which

steadily gets louder as they walk.

A WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.

Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,

laying pipes.  The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but

we're aware of it.

She stops.  Looks ahead of her.  Her face is suddenly ashen

and clammy.  Harry follows her gaze to:

The hole.  Somebody is in it, digging.  Earth emerges in

shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.

She backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her.

She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.  The Nurse is flung

back.

She races down towards the street.  Harry goes after her.

He catches up with her.

The Nurse appears behind Harry.

Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip.

The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away

instantly, racing towards the street.

She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the

top.  There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of

metalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the

Nurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down.

HARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET

Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the

wheels of a car.  The DRIVER is out, and yelling

incoherently.

He slips back down the wall, and leans against it.

He looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging.

His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his

head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from

a grave.  Harry closes his eyes.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - DUSK

The sun is setting, the city giving way to night.

INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

Harry's on the phone.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

Valentin on the phone in the study.

Valentin puts the phone down.

Valentin shakes his head.

Dorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion.  She turns

and leaves the room.

INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

ON BILLY WHO'S CARD, in Harry's hand.

INT. MAGIC CASTLE - SKYLIGHT ROOM - NIGHT

THE PLACE IS EERIE BY NIGHT:  ALL MASKS AND SHADOWS.

PAN UP TO THE SKYLIGHT.  HARRY IS CUTTING AWAY A PANE OF

GLASS.  BILLY'S BEHIND HIM.  THE PANE STARTS TO FALL. WITH

LIGHTNING REFLEXES, BILLY REACHES THROUGH AND CATCHES IT.

INT. MAGIC CASTLE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE REPOSITORY - NIGHT

Harry's manipulating the lock.

CLICK! The door opens.

INT. MAGIC CASTLE - REPOSITORY - NIGHT

Undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and

posters in every direction.

On the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS.  In glass cases, the tools

of the great magicians:  KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an

IRON MAIDEN.  Billy is in awe.  He wanders around wide-eyed

while Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they

investigate.

Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves.

Harry presses it.  The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING.

Inside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS.

Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And --

two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm!

Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from

skewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his

sinews straining.

Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he

steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a

CLANG!

He slams the files down.  He's trembling.

Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.

Reluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded

PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil

painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun.

There are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY

-- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for

that) - is NIX.

He stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different

colours.

ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence.

ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.

Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows

a horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH

of another man's HEAD.

Billy is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching

down and starts to go through others in the series.  We

glimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a

serpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at

his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone

beneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see

a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating

DARKNESS.

Harry studies the etchings.

Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the

book-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his

lips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away.

Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion.

Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A

figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.

Harry takes out his gun.

Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry

goes after the apparition.

The TRACK is completely silent.

Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up,

its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile.

It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who

backs away.

Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the

shelves.

Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.

The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made

of smoke.

Harry waves his hands through it.  It's completely ethereal.

But it's still terrorizing Billy.

Harry glances around.  Sees a LIGHT flickering between some

books.  FIRES at it.  The light goes out.  The "Psycho"

vanishes.  Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.

Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.

Billy is already out of the room.  For a moment. Harry pauses

to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked

gates.

As he does so --

-- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the

"Psycho" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.

He FIRES at the projector a second time.

On the GUN SHOT --

EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT

Billy and Harry are parting.

They shake, and part.

EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Harry waits on the doorstep.  Valentin opens the door.

Harry pushes him aside.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

Harry starts to go through the house, opening doors.

He sees candle-light through a partially open door. Starts

towards it.

He pushes open the door.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT

The room is a museum of Swarm's career.  Posters, and

memorabilia everywhere.  And in the middle of the room,

Swann's sealed CASKET, surrounded by flowers and candles.

Dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed.

Harry approaches, slowly.

Dorothea looks up at him.

Dorothea can't disguise her distress.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

Dorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the

PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT

Valentin is listening at the door.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

Dorothea is pouring herself another drink.  The glass slips

from her hand.  It SHATTERS.  Harry goes to help her.  They

stoop together, very close.  The sexual attraction is almost

palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.

They are very close to each other.

He kisses her.  She kisses him back, hard.

They kiss again, passionately.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

Valentin breaks into the shadows, as Harry and Dorothea cross

the darkened lobby and head upstairs.  Then Valentin crosses

to the phone and dials.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A room of illusions.  Walls lined with mirrors, and warm,

flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and

Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor.

It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling.

INT./EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

Valentin opens the front door.  There's a wind blowing. The

palms churn against the night sky...

INTERCUT

Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies

of Harry and Dorothea.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Harry cradles Dorothea in post-coital languor.

ON HARRY. He's startled, to say the least.

There's a NOISE downstairs.

Harry slips out of bed.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STAIRS - LOBBY - NIGHT

Harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which

is all he wears).  He has his gun.

Dorothea appears behind him.

Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now.  Across the hall, in

a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE.  We can make out no detail

of clothing or face.

Suddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry.  A BLAST of

ENERGY bursts against Harry's face.  As it breaks against his

skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's

skull.

Harry FIRES at the figure.  The shadows fold up around the

Stranger like an origami puzzle.  He's gone.

Harry goes out into the passageway.

As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE

erupts behind Harry.  He swings round to see the Stranger

"unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and

physiology to do so.  The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent

writhing on the ground.  It comes at Harry.  Harry FIRES at

it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's

leg.  He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a

door, and flings it open.  He's in --

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT

The FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand.

Harry drops the GUN.  Looks up to see the Stranger in the

doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on.  But then,

he hesitates.  Harry glances round, and sees that the

Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at

the CASKET.

Dorothea appears behind the Stranger.  Sees Harry, burned and

sweating, cornered against the casket.

The Stranger looks round.  Harry snatches up the GUN,

supporting his burned hand with -his good hand.  Levels the

gun at the Stranger.  The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.

The Stranger draws a deep breath.  The Fire-Serpent withers

and dies.

She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone

into darkness.  The WIND blows through the house, masking his

exit.

Dorothea disappears.  Harry takes one of the candle-holders

and jams it under the casket lid.  Wood splinters.  He starts

to force off the lid.

Valentin and Dorothea enter.

He starts towards Harry.  Dorothea goes after him and catches

hold of his arm.  Her expression is a mingling of fascination

and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and

pulls.

Inside, Swann's corpse.

Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger

into the corpse's mouth.

He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of

his lower jaw.  It cracks --

-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.

He tosses the jaw to Valentin.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea

binds Harry's hand.

ON HARRY.  He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe

Nix's resurrection is plausible.

A beat.

A BELL starts to TOLL-

The TOLLING carries over into

EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by

MOURNERS.  The graveside service has just ended, and the

Mourners are beginning to disperse.  Dorothea is there

amongst them, of course.  So are several faces we recognize:

Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his

Dancers, his Technicians.  There are also several members of

the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom,

to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists.

Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)

from the doorway of a mausoleum.  His eyes are on Dorothea as

she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of

condolesence.

EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

The standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They

are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces.

INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium

in darkness.  Swann's equipment - including the partially

dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage.

Valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann

"died."  He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage.

EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

THE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee

down into the street.

On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet.

We don't see who.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

Harry catches sight of somebody close to the gates of the

cemetery.  Dark glasses, a beard, an anonymous black suit.

Harry smiles slightly, and slips off between the mausoleums.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - PARKING LOT - DAY

The BLACK-COATED MOURNER gets into his car.

On Harry, as he gets into his.

INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

Valentin hears something in the auditorium.  Looks up.

He reaches into his jacket to draw a GUN. There's a NOISE.

He swings round.  Too late.

Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat.  He kicks Valentin

to the ground.

On Valentin, staring up in terror.

Valentin's P.O.V.- of Butterfield, upside down, above him,

the scalpel glittering.

On Valentin again, as Butterfield's blade touches his cheek,

just beneath his eye.

Butterfield pushes the blade into Valentin's skin.

CUT WIDE, as Valentin thrashes, his face obscured by

Butterfield's body.

On Valentin again.  There is a small cut beneath his eye, but

that's all.

EXT. L.A. STREET - SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY

A bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets.

Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with

barbed wire.  He peers through the bars.

Harry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing

into the building.  He glances back towards the street.  We

get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat.

Harry slides out of sight.  Waits until the Stranger has gone

inside.  Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed

wire.

INT. -SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY

It's been a hospital.  Now the echoing corridors and wards

are deserted, littered with reminders of old suffering.

Rotting mattresses; spilled boxes of surgical supplies.

Harry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of

the Stranger.

He enters a shadowy room.  Birds fly UP into his face!

As he retreats, another SOUND, a little distance from him.

GUN in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into

INT. SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - OPERATING THEATRE - DAY

Narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window

fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded

equipment.  Eerie.  Disturbing.

Harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room.

Silence.  Harry notices the beard and glasses on the

operating table.

Silence.

Harry looks up.

Svanrt is hovering in the air above him.  The veins in his

temples bulge and throb.  This trick requires a lot of

concentration.

Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.

Swann stops, inches from the ground.

Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now

they're face to face.  Eye to eye.  Swann, for all his

posturing, is afraid.

On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.

ON Swann.  This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.

EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles

are already gathered.  The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out.

SNAKES seethe out of the open car door.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON

We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of

several CULTISTS as we go.  They all have looks of barely

suppressed ecstasy on their faces.

We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker.

A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life.  We

see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix,

floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction.

Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath,

Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  Norman

grins.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

A small, garishly-lit liquor store.  Harry's car pulls into

the lot.  Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into

the store.  Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him.

INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap

brandy.

Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air.

Swann starts to COUGH.  A QUARTER falls from his mouth.

Swann coughs again.  Puts his hand to his mouth.  A DELUGE of

QUARTERS runs between his fingers.

The Cashier gapes.

EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - GROUNDS - DUSK

The house could not look more reassuringly calm.  A SWAN

struts beside the pool.  A long, HUSHED MOMENT...

DOROTHEA'S DREAM

A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame.

CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum,

crazed.

Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a

shadowy figure.  Is it Nix?  We can't quite see.  Black BLOOD

runs from the figure and splashes on the ground.

NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the

falling gouts of dark fluid --

-- she struggles, SOBBING --

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

She tosses around on the bed

DOROTHEA'S DREAM

-- Dorothea has a GUN in her hand.  The Cultists shake it

from her grip, and pull her directly under the BLOOD -- as it

SPLASHES on her upturned face --

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A SOUND. Dorothea wakes, distressed by the dream.  She gets

up and goes out onto --

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LANDING - DUSK

Looks down the stairs.

Silence.  Then, Valentin speaks behind her.  She jumps.

BLOOD runs from his cut face.

She turns.  He's on her in a heartbeat, pressing her back

against the wail.

INT. HARRY'S CAR - DUSK

Harry drives.  Swann takes a throatful of brandy.  Then he

stares at Harry.

Silence for a moment.

Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann.

Harry drinks.

EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - NIGHT

PAN DOWN from the palms to Harry's car, outside the front

door.

INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

Harry puts his head in the study, the library, the bedroom.

Now he's on the landing.  Swann's below.

Harry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of

stars.

INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT

Valentin drives.  Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back.

Dorothea is handcuffed.

He has a bag open at his feet.  One by one he takes out a

series of extraordinary instruments.  Dorothea looks on,

confounded.

ON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes.

EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house.

Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES.

There is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house.

It has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity.

We DRIFT towards the front door.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room.

Inside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle.  They are all

CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that

blazes in the centre of the circle.  They hack

indiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their

eyes wild.  BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked

ears and scalps.

And still the CHANT BUILDS, and BUILDS...

EXT. DESERT - NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

Wide.  A few rocks, and emptiness.

The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness,

illuminating the dig.  Valentin is in the grave, digging.

ON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole,

watching the work.  Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.

Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly

reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close.

On Dorothea, who uses Butterfield's distraction to take a few

steps back towards the open car door.

Dorothea's P.O.V. of Butterfield, back to her, interrogating

Valentin.

A SOUND behind him.  Butterfield wheels round.  On the ground

beside the open car door, the instruments.

He goes to pick them up.  Dorothea steps from behind the

door, with the sharpest in her hand.  She slashes at him.

Opens a WOUND across his arm.

He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her

hand, and slamming her against the car.  He hits her.  Once.

Twice.  Then --

Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the

flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin.

The beam goes to the corner of the grave.

A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls.

Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand.

The TRACK is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath.

He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers...

Closer...

Closer...

He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a

ROAR!

He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the

mask rolls into view.

On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.

INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

The car is static; the engine still running.

EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

Harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave.

HARRY'S MOVING P.O.V. OF THE GRAVE

Harry reaches the grave's-edge.  It's totally dark.  He peers

in.  On his heel, as the ground CRUMBLES beneath his weight.

Harry slides into the grave.

He's in darkness now.  He gets to his feet, and starts to try

and scramble out.

Silence.

Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder!  Harry swings

round.  It's Valentin.  He has been badly cut up.

He collapses into Harry's arms.

INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

Indecision is written all over Swann's face:  to help or not

to help?

He decides.  Gets out.

EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - MIGHT

Swann goes to the graveside, terrified.

Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and

lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.

Valentin dies.

He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body.  It rolls back into

Nix's grave.

ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann

getting into the car.  The doors SLAM.  The CAR LIGHTS

retreat.  The grave is left to DARKNESS.

EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is silent now.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

We TRACK through the house.  The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of

them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum.

ON THE SANCTUM DOOR.  Butterfield emerges.  He is wearing

WHITE now.

Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands.

With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the

bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up

MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor

sharp pieces of GLASS.

ON Butterfield, smiling.  He steps back into the Sanctum.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the

BODY of Nix.  It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL.

Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  Beside its

head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out.

ON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as

she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed

into Nix's face.  He works with surgical precision.

A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  A subtle

POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely.

We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on

occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these

signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.

He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

The bottle-breaking has ceased.  The Cultists stand,

breathless with anticipation.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

On Nix's emaciated mouth.  The lips TWITCH.

On Dorothea.  The DUST moves around her.

And Nix DRAWS BREATH.

On Butterfield, TEARS in his eyes.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

The whisper runs through the congregation:

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

ON Dorothea, eyes wide.

ON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils.

His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to

THROB.

Butterfield is watching the process in amazement. Nix's HANDS

move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is

still screwed over his eyes.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

Unnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea

gets to her feet and creeps away to the door. Very quiet

TRACK.

Suddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes

coiled around his face and fingers!

Butterfield looks up.

On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face.  It

comes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND.  At last, we see

his eyes.

NIX'S P.O.V.

The candle-lights blaze, BLINDING his sensitive eyes.

He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over

all the lights but two.  Then he strikes Butterfield to the

ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking

him unconscious.  It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal

display of instant physical superiority.  Throughout, he

literally ROARS in rage.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

The Cultists SCREAM in sympathy, letting out years of

repressed frustration.  Many of them are dancing on the

shards of glass now, crazed.

EXT. DESERT NEAR NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house. He is

getting out.  Swann stays put.

The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind.

Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out

of the car and follows.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

On Butterfield, as Nix removes his foot.  Butterfield is out

for the count.

On Nix, as he stops screaming.  His face is grotesquely

disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted.

The SCREAMING of the Cultists is dying away.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction.

One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees.  We never see

flesh pierced by broken glass.  But we HEAR IT, and see the

agony on the Cultist's faces.  They start to sob.

Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.

He steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of

adoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea.

He reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea

keeps her self-possession; but only just.

Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.

Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation

Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the

wounds he's receiving.

The Cultists follow.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

Nix strides into the middle of the room.

The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

Harry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows.

He is frozen by the memory of what happened here.

ON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that

terrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of

the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh.

Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked

grip.  He crosses to the door.

Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and

catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground.

He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at

Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

He stamps on the ground.  CRACKS spread from his foot in all

directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of

power.

With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath

Nix and Dorothea.  Nix HOVERS over it.  It's utterly dark;

perhaps bottomless.

Dorothea SCREAMS!

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

Hearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the

passageway.  Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the

ground and stabs at Harry a second time.  But Swann catches

hold of his arm.

And Harry's up and away --

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

-- he dashes over the glass --

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

On Nix, Dorothea clasped close to him.  He REVOLVES as he

floats over the chasm below then.

On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their

eyes.

A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the

bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in

the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS.  As Nix

REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the

Cultists.

At first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this

is some kind of bizarre blessing.

Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.

They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground.

They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry

for them.  They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK.

Harry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has

his back to Harry.

Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground

is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have

disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up

out of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it

despite its horror.  SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid

ground.  TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix

and Dorothea, GUN levelled.  So far, he has avoided Nix's

gaze.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle.

They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was

resurrected.  It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann

is stunned.  Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments

and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of

time.

The BLADE catches him in the arm, however.

Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a

wall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across

the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!

He falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to

watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD

running from his wound.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses

the still-sticky ground.  He's a yard from the edge of the

pit now.

Nix swings round.

Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of

Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN

goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door

leading to the passageway.

Nix reaches down to torment Harry.  But before he can make

contact

Nix looks up.

Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He

steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone

suddenly conversational.

With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the

chasm.

ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door.  Harry glances

back into the room.

He lays his hands on Swann.  Draws him into an embrace.

ON HARRY and Dorothea.

A NOISE. He turns, and suddenly --

Butterfield is there!  His face is horribly burned, but he's

still very much alive.

He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the

BROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the

Passageway.

Nix has Swann in a bear-hug.

A beat.  Then Swann nods.

Nix lets him go.

Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.

Swann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns.

Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall,

pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.

With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in

Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,

they have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs.

They CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs,

one to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards

Dorothea.

He moves towards Dorothea.  Swann falls to the ground,

broken.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.

Harry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and

running off into the darkness.

Butterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time

for this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,

and Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see

the impact.  HEARING it's enough.

Harry looks down at the body.  Then --

Harry turns.

Nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's

body as he comes at Harry!

Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the

fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He

struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.

Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's

temples.  As before, there's no blood.

His fingers slide all the way in!

Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes

are BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him.

Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.

HARRY'S P.O.V.

The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face

SCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms!

ON HARRY, verging on insanity.

HARRY'S P.O.V.

Harry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of

some glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY.  We can't see her

face.  Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her

devourer.

ON HARRY

as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted.

Reaching out for the image.

HARRY'S P.O.V.

The Woman reaches for Harry.

ON HARRY

as he touches the wall.

He starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is

painted.

HARRY'S P.O.V.

Darkness swallows the image of the woman.  She is still

screaming when she disappears.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

ON SWANN, dragging his broken body to the door.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

ON HARRY

literally beating his head against the wall!

Harry stops.  Dare he believe this is truly her voice?

Harry turns around.  Dorothea is there.

HARRY'S P.O.V.

For a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.

ON HARRY, relief flooding his face.  Then --

HARRY'S P.O.V.

-- the image MORPHS.  Dorothea's beauty is replaced by

primeval muck.

ON HARRY, appalled.  Dorothea grabs hold of him.

Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT.  He's

fighting the delirium.  Or doing his best.

Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.

Harry starts to look round.

Harry turns and looks at Nix.

HARRY'S P.O.V.

Nix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle

of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.

ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room

and now slips inside.

ON HARRY, staring up at Nix.

ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her

hand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her.

ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea.

ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES.

The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees,

BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE

used to be.

ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the

wall, shaking.

Harry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her.

HARRY'S P.O.V.

The last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she

actually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they

embrace.

Suddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him --

-- it isn't over.

One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he

kneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS

up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his

forehead --

-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of

the bullet wound.

Harry and Dorothea start to get up...

Nix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS,

stripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible

element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an

utterly inhuman SHRIEK!

Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room.

Swann is on the threshold.

Nix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk

somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form.

He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into

the Meditation Room.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is

backed towards it by Nix.

When Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is

DEMONIACAL.

Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.

Harry crouches beside Swann.

ON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now.

Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs.

Nix topples.

ON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground.  Closes his eyes.

A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's

broken fingers --

-- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like

corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces

resurfacing --

Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over

the edge of the pit.

The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging

around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit.  So's

Harry, of course.

Nix tries to get up, but he's too late.  The corpses weigh

him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper

hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.

He's at the edge of the pit.

Harry looks round.  Dorothea's behind him, risking the

flowing ground to offer him a hand.

Nix starts to fall into the pit.  At the last minute, he

reaches for Harry, as --

-- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea.

Together they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies.

They look back to see

NIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING.

At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head.  He's dead. She

closes his eyes.

INT. THE PIT

What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his-

death by any villain in the history of cinema...

Nix is falling through rock.  Still SCREAMING.  He CRASHES

against a layer of stone, which his body smashes to

smithereens.  And as he falls --

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

No it's not.  Nix keeps falling, breaking through another

layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the

earth.

And now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below.  He's

approaching MAGMA.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

She puts her arms around him.  Kisses him, sobbing with

relief.

INT. THE PIT

Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, SCREAMING, he

disappears.  A BURST of dark, roiling ENERGY erupts from the

spot where he sank, and starts up the pit --

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

The room TREMBLES.  There's a ROAR in the earth.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

They race for the front door --

INT. THE PIT

-- the wave of ENERGY, like a howling, dark WIND, ascends at

a breath-taking rate

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Harry and Dorothea race for the open air, as

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

The ENERGY ERUPTS from the pit.

EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Harry and Dorothea stumble out, into the night --

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

The ENERGY howls from room to room, ERODING the images off

the walls, BLOWING out the doors, DESTROYING all the

resurrection equipment in the Sanctum --

EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN

Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car.  They look back at the

house, as the cacophony of destruction dies down.

ON THE RIM OF THE SUN, as it peeps over the desert horizon.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - DAWN

The SUNLIGHT creeps through the rooms as the DUST settles.

INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAWN

The hole in the floor CLOSES UP, and is SEALED... SILENCE

reigns.

EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN

Harry and Dorothea get into the car.  Harry glances back at

the house.  Nothing.

EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - IDOLS - DAWN

ON THE IDOLS and the FRONT DOOR, virtually destroyed by tine.

WE DRIFT THROUGH THEM, INTERCUTTING WITH:

EXT. HARRY'S CAR - DESERT ROAD - DAWN

Harry's car speeds away, leaving a plume of dust as

THE CREDITS ROLL
