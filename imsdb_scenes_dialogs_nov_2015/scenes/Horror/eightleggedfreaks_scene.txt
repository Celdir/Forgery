FADE IN:

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

A rabbit hops across rough terrain.

EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

Three trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of

toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP

454.

INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT

A sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck.

EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

The rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first

truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crosses

the highway in front of the third.

INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT

The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights.

Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the

bunny.

EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

The truck slews crazily.    Missing the bunny by a whisker.

INT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHT

Pig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain

control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the

rig together.

EXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT

The rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic

waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the

water below.

EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT

A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips

beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a

gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon

ink.

EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY

The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of

INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly

net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized

horsefly.

JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger

is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with

people.

MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look.     Puberty hit hard

and fast for this bright, little nerd.

CONTINUED:

As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a

familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly-

colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.

EXT. ROAD - JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of

nowhere.

INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and

homegrown scientist. Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch.

Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen

aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates a

specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.

Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.

CONTINUED:

Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search

for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged

den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the

cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.

Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting

spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless

insects.

Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing

crickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered

with a towel.

Joshua unveils the    tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow

entrances. Joshua     pours in the bugs. A large, male

tarantula comes out    of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,

then wraps its prey    in webbing, turning the insect into a

mummy-like bundle.

CONTINUED:

CHARLIE SQUAWKS.

Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of

subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas

scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.

Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps

out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red

tarantula.

Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified

bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.

Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass.     Mike recoils.

Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated.

TARANTULA POV - MIKE

The multi-eyed spider's PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms

large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.

BACK TO MIKE

Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela.

CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily.    The sound of a CAR HORN.

Mike heads for the door.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

The entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside.

A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on the

door reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY,

PROSPERITY, NV.

INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Rotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a

string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of

the tunnel.

CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered

clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles.

Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes

contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to

scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.

Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.

Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away

a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections

of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile

fades...

CONTINUED:

Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A

large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's

sack lunch.

Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The

rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes

rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.

A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices

a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a

stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away

with lunch.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

A police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the

trunk.

INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Mike can't turn on the gizmo.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

The ROAR of two off-road MOTORCYCLES tearing up the

desert.

BRET HALE (18) leads the way. A Kid Rock-punk with good

looks and FU attitude. Seated behind him is ASHLEY

PALMER (16). This milk-fed desert honey is a wannabe

Britney Spears. LARRY (17) is the wiseacre on the other

bike.

CONTINUED:

They GUN their BIKES onto the highway. Slalom the yellow

lines. Wheelie for days. Ashley peeks over Bret's

shoulder at a police car coming at them in the opposite

lane.

INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Sheriff Sam watches intently as the bikes wheelie past.

EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY

The police car does an impressive bootlegger 180. Lights

The motorcycles stop with the cop car behind.        Sam's

voice barks over the PA.

Sam exits the car and approaches.       The bikers dismount.

Sam begins to write up the ticket.

Sam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance.

INT. SAM'S COP CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Sam STARTS the CAR and drives toward town.

CONTINUED:

Sam reaches over and opens the glove box. She pulls out

a stun gun. Mike passes it through the bars to Ashley.

Mike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam's response.

They drive on in painful silence.     Mike turns ON the

RADIO.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Chris drives into town with the RADIO ON.

EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Chris's pickup approaches... The entire town is not much

bigger than a few football fields. The kind of place

where everybody has known each other since childhood.

Some buildings date back to the 1880's gold rush.

At one end is the Prosperity Mall. A huge windowless

rectangle in the sand. Permanent signs tout the many

outlet stores inside: Victoria's Secret, Home and Garden

Supplies, Sport Chalet, etc. Hand-painted signs reveal:

"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE. EVERYTHING MUST GO. FINAL

CLOSE OUT." On the roof of the mall is a very tall radio

antenna.

EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

An airstream at the far end of town. Signs identify it

as: "FREEDOM RADIO." A brand new humvee is parked out

front.

INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Walls decorated with clippings about aliens, monsters,

and conspiracies. Two men sit at a home built

transmitter.

HARLAN GRIFFITH (40s) wears an "Aliens Go Home!" T-

shirt. He eats from a box of Frosted Flakes and drinks

Jolt cola.

WADE HALE (40s) is the mayor of Prosperity. A slick-

haired dandy who looks more like a Vegas lounge singer

than a Mayor.

INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Sam and her kids listen to the radio.

INT. DINER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

An attractive waitress on roller-skates. A harried CHEF.

front of Harlan's trailer. He leaps out of his pickup.

INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Chris yanks the door open in time to hear...

Wade stands up to protest. But it's too late. Chris

punches him in the nose. The mayor tumbles back.

Chris drags Wade to his feet, shoving him against the

wall.

CONTINUED:

Chris draws back his fist for another shot.       Sam runs in

and grabs him from behind.

She manhandles Chris toward the door.

EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Practically the entire town has gathered outside. Sam

drags Chris through the door. Wade and Harlan are close

behind.

Wade tries to take advantage of the assembled audience.

CONTINUED:

Wade retreats toward his shiny new Hummer.

Chris tries to go after Wade.       Sam holds him back.

Chris stares at her.

Wade drives off in his humvee.       The crowd begins to

disperse.

Chris heads off to his truck. Sam watches him go. Her

eyes drifting down his body. Ashley steps up beside her

mom.

CONTINUED:

Sam watches Chris get into his truck. He gives her one

last look before pulling out. Sam smiles with her

daughter.

INT. MINING MUSEUM (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

Vintage mining gear. Walls covered with sepia-tone

photos chronicling the history of the McCormick mines.

GLADYS LAUDERBACK (50s) sits at a desk. She blows smoke

from her Kool into the breeze of an air conditioner.

Ignoring the signs behind her head: "NO SMOKING!",

"DANGER GAS!"

As Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a

drawer.

Chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that

honeycomb beneath the town. Many of them are marked

"explored." Many aren't. Chris checks another tunnel

off the list. He sniffs the air and glares at Gladys.

Smoke rises out of her desk drawer. Gladys yanks it open

and puts out the flame.

CONTINUED:

She raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches.

Chris exits through a door at the back of the museum.

INT. MUSEUM - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Chris enters the family living quarters. The furniture

was new in 1947. He continues to the adjacent kitchen.

INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

Chris takes a beer out of the fridge. Then he notices an

odd CLICKING. He tracks the sound to a stove burner

permanently on "light."

Chris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway. He

removes the fuse for the stove. The SPARKING STOPS.

Chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer.

Gladys enters with a stack of bills.

CONTINUED:

Chris takes umbrage...

A tense beat.

Gladys steels her fear, patting Chris on the hand.

EXT. TOWN - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAWN

The sun rises.     The town slowly comes to life.

Locals prepare their stores for business.

INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY

Joshua turns the radio down. He holds a tape measure to

a glass spider tank, recording the size of an unseen

arac.

Joshua doesn't look back at the parrot sitting on its

perch.

Charlie looks over at the tarantula tank. Watching

curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly. As if one

of the spiders is escaping. Charlie flies over to

investigate. He lands on the counter and peers around

the back of the tank.

Something yanks the parrot O.S.

Joshua looks back in search of the parrot. He notices

several feathers floating down to the floor. He heads

over to investigate. Joshua pulls the blanket clear to

reveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside. No

sign of any tarantulas. Joshua checks the back side of

the tank.

She's nowhere to be seen. Joshua spots      something

sticking out from under the table. Two      parrot feet.

Joshua pulls Charlie out from under the     table. It's a

horrible sight. The bird is wrapped in      spider webbing.

His body desiccated.

CONTINUED:

Joshua sees Charlie is attached to a web. He tugs on the

webline. Something tugs back. Joshua leans down to look

under the table. His eyes go wide at what he sees. Then

a shadow looms over his head. Joshua looks up and...

EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY

SCREAMS and the sounds of BREAKING GLASS come from

within.

EXT. PALMER HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY

Ranch style.    Cop car in front.     Chris's pickup cruises

by.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - OUTSIDE PALMER HOUSE - DAY

Chris drives past.    He catches sight of a figure in a

window.

INT. PALMER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Sam is brushing her teeth at the window as Chris drives

by. They make eye contact. Chris moves on. Sam looks

at herself in the mirror. Bathrobe. No makeup. Messy

hair. Mouth full of toothpaste.

INT. PALMER HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Sam comes out of the bathroom dressed in her uniform.

Ashley and Mike exit their rooms. Mike is dressed for

the day. Ashley in a robe. They race for the bathroom.

Mike is first. Then Ashley hip-checks him out of the

way, slamming the door in his face.

CONTINUED:

Sam sticks her head out of a room at the end of the hall.

Mike heads down the hallway and out of the house.

INT. PALMER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Ashley turns on the shower, drops her robe, and climbs

in.

INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

Ashley is surrounded by steam. She sings an edgy gangsta

rap tune by NWA. Tres' bizarre, non? Shampoo lather

cascades down her face. Her eyes close. She is

oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of

her. The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the

soap.

Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather

builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed once

more. The spider returns across its web right in front

of her eyes.

The water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead

blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels no

water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reaching

with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has

landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, the

spider scurries onto its opposite side.

Ashley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the

washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it can

strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth.

The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the

beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on

the cloth. Crushing the spider without ever knowing it

was there.

CONTINUED:

Ashley turns her attention to the showerhead. She cranks

the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again.

The handles suddenly pop off. Dozens of tiny spiders

pour from the holes onto the floor. Ashley shrieks in

horror.

Sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower

door. She drags Ashley out and looks at all the little

spiders.

Ashley just screams.

INT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - DAY

The SCREAM of a SAWZALL. A house in the midst of

remodeling. Sections of wall are exposed. Sheets cover

furniture. HANK (30s) is the Bob Villa-poseur.

A cat sits near an open section of wall. Watching

something intently. The cat charges into the wall after

unseen prey.

EMMA (30s) comes downstairs wearing her bathrobe. She

clutches her ears in pain, screaming for Hank to stop.

He can't hear. She grabs his shoulder and he STOPS

CUTTING.

Hanks RESTARTS the SAW as Emma staggers into the kitchen.

INT. REMODELED HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Emma makes herself a hangover helper. Egg, tabasco,

lemon juice, and a shot of vodka. All of it goes into

the BLENDER. She FIRES it UP. Competing with the noise

of Hank's SAW. Then Emma notices a bowl of uneaten cat

food.

INT. REMODELED HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Emma comes back in and UNPLUGS the noisy SAW.

They hear FAINT MEOWING. Hank traces the source.       It's

coming from behind a partially-dismantled wall.

Emma heads back into the kitchen. Hank listens at the

wall. After a beat he hears the CAT RUSTLING around

inside.

Emma re-enters with a can of tuna.       She hears ZEKE HISS.

Hank shakes his head. The CAT noises become more

aggressive. The panicked couple tries to follow the

cat's progress. They tracks the sounds of BATTLE along

the wall. The noises become FRANTIC. SCRABBLING CLAWS.

HOWLS of KITTY pain.

CONTINUED:

They follow the cat's frenzied movement up the wall,

across the ceiling, and down the other wall. Hank

hurries over. He can feel his cat thrashing maniacally

on the other side. A FELINE SCREAM. And then deafening

silence.

Hank tears open the drywall, reaching for his cat.

He withdraws all that remains of the Zeker... a bloody

tail.

EXT. MALL - DAY

Mike hops off his bike before it stops moving. Letting

it crash in the dirt. He enters the mall through glass

doors.

INT. MALL (PROSPERITY) - DAY

Mike passes NORMAN (18), a janitor polishing the floors.

Norman listens to LOUD DEATH ROCK TUNES on a Sony

WALKMAN.

Mike comes over to this goatee'd rascal.

CONTINUED:

Mike walks away, deeper into the mall. A dozen stores

line the hallway: Victoria's Secret, Electronic

Boutique, Sport Chalet. Most of the stores are closed

for good. A large atrium features a fountain and jungle

gym. Skylights cover the ceiling. Mike enters the Home

and Garden store.

INT. HOME AND GARDEN STORE - DAY

Mike goes up to the counter.          The CLERK snaps at him.

Mike grabs some batteries and lays them on the counter.

An OLD LADY walks past.

The Clerk grabs the PA's microphone.

CONTINUED:

He returns his attention to Mike.

Mike pays the man.

The annoyed Clerk points. Mike heads over. He sees the

aisle is crowded with locals squabbling over the few

remaining cans of Raid, Black Flag and Off.

EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY

Beverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. She sprays her

vegetable garden with water. After a beat, a solid

object is coughed up through the hose.

Beverly continues watering. Two more unidentified

objects are spewed from the hose. She reacts by cranking

the spigot on full. The water sprays harder. Then

inexplicably stops.

Beverly checks the spigot. She looks into the opening of

the hose. Puts it to her ear and listens. Sniffs. Now

she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks

deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage.

Beverly removes the hose. A FAINT RUMBLING sound. She

puts it back in her mouth and sucks. A solid object

comes through the hose and into her mouth. Then another.

And another. A dozen things pump through the hose and

into her mouth.

Beverly yanks it out. Water spews from her mouth and out

of the hose. Apparently the blockage has cleared.

Beverly falls to her knees. Hunching forward. She

vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small

spiders. Mouth agape. Eyes wide in horror. She watches

them scurry into the garden. Beverly tries to scream...

but can only retch.

EXT. STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Mike Palmer rides his bike through a puddle of water. He

sees Beverly throwing up in her vegetable garden. Mike

it thoroughly grossed out.

EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY

Mike rides his bike into Joshua's front yard.    He

dismounts before the BIKE stops. It CRASHES.     Mike heads

inside.

INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

Mike stops short in the doorway. An off-hook TELEPHONE

BEEPS incessantly. WIND MOANS through shattered windows.

Furniture is tipped over. Mike moves through the chaos.

The spider tanks are shattered. No trace of their

occupants. Mike pulls out his Cassiopeia PDA and starts

recording.

Stops recording, PLAYS it BACK, listens to HIS VOICE.

Mike moves toward the back door of the cabin.    It swings

open and shut in the WIND.

EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - BACK YARD - DAY

Mike comes out and notices hundreds of coin-sized

footprints. He follows these tracks to a cluster of

wooden barricades labeled: "McCORMICK AND SONS MINING

COMPANY." Mike peers toward a vertical mine shaft behind

the barriers.

CONTINUED:

Mike slips past the barricades. Following the tracks to

the edge of the abyss. He can't see anything. It's too

dark.

Mike turns away and returns to the yard.    Never

realizing...

Several feet down the shaft. Hidden under a rock... the

shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft. It hangs

from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing.

Grisly.

Suddenly the corpse is tugged loose and dragged deeper

into the shaft by some unseen creature.

EXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Chris's pickup is parked outside another mine shaft.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAY

Chris works with   his pick-axe. He pauses, listening to a

DISTURBING NOISE   somewhere down the tunnel. A growl? A

roar? Chris isn'   t so sure. And then a new sound... a

SCREECHING. The    noise grows LOUDER. Something's coming.

Chris shines his light into the darkness. Trying to see

what's causing the unsettling crescendo...

Suddenly dozens of RATS burst from the darkness.

EXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Chris runs out the mouth of the tunnel. The rat stampede

is on his tail. He leaps into the back of his pickup.

The manic rodents continue off into the desert.

Chris looks back toward the gaping mouth of the tunnel.

Mike rides his bike. Floyd the barber stands out front

chatting with an elderly couple. They hold a dog's leash

post. Mike glances over. It's a sign for a missing dog.

Mike arrives at the local police station. Several cars

are parked out front. The door is ajar. Locals are

crowded inside. Mike lets his bike crash as he enters.

Sam is behind her desk.   The place is swarming with

locals.

The mob is not listening.

Deputy Pete whistles at top volume.   Everybody shuts up.

CONTINUED:

avoids the crush and manages to stay inside.

The PHONE RINGS.     Sam answers it.

OFF Mike's look.

EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - DAY

Prosperity is clearly visible just a mile away. The

police car drives down a long road lined with fences.

EXT. WADE'S RANCH - RANCH HOUSE - DAY

Wade's new Hummer is in the driveway. A CATTLE DOG BARKS

as Wade leads Sam and Mike around the side of the house.

The trio steps to the fence.    Only three mangy ostriches

are there to greet them.

Sam gestures toward the BARKING DOG.

Mike notices some ostrich feathers on the ground.     He

heads over for a closer look.

The DOG watches his progress.    BARKING excitedly.

Sam talks to Wade.

CONTINUED:

Mike looks back to see his mom confronting Wade.

Mike scrutinizes what appear to be more of those tracks

that he found at Joshua's. But this time they are

larger:

Mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance.

This one is plugged with concrete. The tracks don't go

there. They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of

ground. Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby.

Mike takes a closer    look. Something doesn't seem right.

An odd demarcation    in the soil. His fingers trace the

edge of a thin film    of material. It is a lid of sorts.

A sheath of sticky    webbing coated with dirt. Mike is

able to lift it.

Mike peers into a deep dark burrow three feet wide.

INT. UNDERGROUND BURROW - DAY

Twenty feet down the shaft.     A shape moves.

The kid is FRAMED IN the burrow opening just a few feet

EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - DAY

Mike and Sam are in the cop car.     Wade is at Sam's

Sam drives down the driveway. Wade takes off his hat and

wipes his brow. He watches Clyde run parallel to the

accelerating police car.

INT. POLICE CAR (DIRT DRIVEWAY) - DAY

Sam eyes the road ahead.     Mike is lost in thought.

Mike glances out the window at the dog running nearby.

Sam looks at him like he's out of his mind.

CONTINUED:

She checks him for a fever.

EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - FENCE LINE - DAY

CLYDE runs   next to the car. Suddenly he disappears

underground   with a YELP. Only still frame on a DVD

player will   capture the trapdoor spider's lunge from a

camouflaged   den. The dog's empty collar rolls to a stop

in a cloud   of dust.

INT. POLICE CAR (DIRT DRIVEWAY) - DAY

Mike turns from his mother and looks out the window.        He

is confused when he doesn't see any sign of the dog.

He checks himself for a fever.

INT. ABANDONED TRUCK STOP (DESERT) - DAY

A dingy collection of buildings surrounded by dunes and

rock. The structures have boarded windows. Graffiti on

the walls. Teenagers hang out. Off-road motorcycles

parked nearby.

Bret Hale's monster truck does donuts in the parking lot.

Ashley hangs out the passenger window shrieking with

glee.

INT. BRET'S TRUCK (TRUCK STOP) - DAY

Bret smokes a Phillies Blunt as he donuts his TRUCK.

Ashley laughs hysterically. Bret steers them around to

the back of the truck stop. He SKIDS to a stop.

Bret offers his stogie.    Ashley refuses.     Bret puffs

away.

CONTINUED:

He coughs and they both laugh.

Ashley is silent.

They kiss. Things head toward a serious        level of "get

down." Bret slides his hand up Ashley's        shirt. Ashley

gets into it. But then Bret slides his        hand toward the

buttons of her 501s. Ashley removes his        hand.

Bret persists.       Ashley climbs off of him.

CONTINUED:

Bret goes after her once more.      Ashley's not into it.

But Bret won't listen. Ashley isn't strong enough to

fight him. She reaches into her purse and pulls out her

stun gun. She rams it up in Bret's crotch and pulls the

trigger.

Bret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper. He

spasmodically jerks off of Ashley and tumbles out the

driver's side door.

EXT. BEHIND TRUCK STOP - DAY

Bret twitches on the ground.

CONTINUED:

Ashley watches from the truck.

Ashley closes the door of the truck and rolls up the

windows.

Bret is dazed as he gets to his feet. Then his eyes

rack-focus to a nearby dune. A Rottweiler-sized jumping

spider stands atop it. Two large eyes surrounded by six

smaller orbs. Orange and black designs on its abdomen.

Wiry hair. Dagger-sized fangs. Bret can't quite believe

what he sees.

Ashley STARTS the TRUCK.      This snaps Bret back to

reality.

Bret sees the spider leisurely coming down off the dune.

He runs over to the door of the pickup and tries to open

it.

Ashley starts to pull away.         Bret keeps banging on the

glass.

Ashley flips him the bird and BURNS RUBBER. As the truck

moves out of the way, Bret finds himself staring at

several more jumping spiders that are methodically

approaching. Bret sprints around to the other side of

the truck stop.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - PARKING LOT - DAY

Bret runs from behind the building.    Larry Witzer and a

bunch of other kids see him coming.

All the kids start laughing and pointing at Bret.      None

of them see the approaching jumping spiders.

Larry and Randy high-five. A jumping spider lands on

Randy's back, piercing him with its fangs, throwing him

to the ground. Randy screams. The kids have a front-row

seat as the spider's pincers mash their buddy into an

edible pulp.

Bret leaps onto his MOTORCYCLE and FIRES it UP. Several

more jumping spiders bound across the parking lot.

The kids scramble, leaping onto their bikes. One rider

is picked off by a spider. The others kick up rooster

tails as they accelerate away. The spiders chase them

into the dunes.

EXT. SAND DUNES - DAY

A wasteland on the outskirts of town. The sandy waves

are "surfed" by the noisy MOTORCYCLES. The jumping

spiders keep after them, leaping a dozen feet in a single

bound.

A biker is ripped off a motorcycle.     The BIKE CRASHES.

Larry ends up with a jumper on his bike. Another biker

tries to kick it off, managing to knock the critter into

the motorcycle's spokes. The spider gets munched. But

then the courageous biker crashes and is set upon by a

hungry jumper.

Larry continues riding. But a spider lands on his back

and sinks fangs into his spine. Larry yells bloody

murder.

CONTINUED:

Bret sees Larry go down in a cloud of gore and sand.

Bret is the only human left. A jumper comes after him in

mid-air. Bret does an X-Games style rocket air, kicking

backward with booted legs. He knocks the spider away and

keeps on riding.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Three familiar trucks cruise down the highway.     This time

they are devoid of any toxic waste cargo.

INT. THIRD TRUCK - HIGHWAY - DAY

Pig Pen stares fixedly at the endless road ahead of him.

Suddenly Bret Hale wheelies across the road. A jumping

spider explodes against the windshield. Spider guts

splatter everywhere. Pig Pen screams as he JAMS on the

BRAKES.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The TRUCK jack-knifes into a line of telephone poles.

Knocking them over and rolling multiple times before

EXPLODING. Several jumping spiders are caught in the

blast. Bret Hale rides on with several more jumpers

behind.

INT. PALMER HOUSE - MIKE'S ROOM - DAY

The black and white classic: Tarantula, plays over an

old TV and VCR. Mike is at his computer, downloading a

spider encyclopedia into his PDA. A message flashes

across the screen: CONNECTION LOST. Mike picks up the

telephone.

The line is dead.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Bret rides into a dead-end canyon with the spiders very

close behind. Bret steers for the mouth of a hillside

mine shaft.

INT HORIZONTAL MINE SHAFT - DAY

Bret speeds inside. He looks over his shoulder to check

for his pursuers, they're gone. Bret looks relieved. He

faces forward as... whack! A support beam knocks him

from his bike. The bike continues on into the tunnel

alone. From the sound of things it travels pretty far

before crashing.

Bret lies on the ground as dust settles onto his face.

He looks up at a support beam which begins to crack.

Bret moves clear just as the ceiling caves in, sealing

him in the mine.

EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Several locals put up more signs for missing pets.

INT. DINER/EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

two. The attractive WAITRESS on roller-skates give him a

fresh beer.

Wade reacts glumly to the word "ostrich."

INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

Gladys smokes as she puts together the fixings for a

large meal. She has a cookbook out. Pots and pans.

Chris enters. Gladys quickly drops her cigarette in the

disposal.

CONTINUED:

Chris goes through a nearby door to the basement.

INT. MUSEUM - BASEMENT - DAY

Chris comes downstairs. He rummages through some junk.

comes up with several rat traps. He turns around to

discover an odd hole in the wall. He ventures over for a

look.

Chris leans into the hole, his jacket restricts his

entry.

Chris pulls out of the hole, standing to reveal a large

male tarantula on his back. Chris is oblivious as he

takes off his jacket. The coat lands in a heap atop the

spider.

Chris gets back down and places one of the rat traps in

the hole. He doesn't notice the jacket moving behind

him.

Chris backs out of the hole. He picks up his jacket.

The spider is gone. He grabs his traps and heads

upstairs.

INT. MUSEUM - DAY

Chris passes through the kitchen.    He eyes Gladys warily.

Smoke pours out of her nostrils.

Chris starts out.

Chris hesitates.

CONTINUED:

Chris mulls this over.   Testing his own feelings. He

opens his mouth to ask another question. And then heads

out.

Gladys doesn't notice the basement DOOR CREAK open

slightly.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Sam is on the phone at her desk.

Chris enters.

Sam freezes for a second.     Chris laughs.

CONTINUED:

Sam thinks this over.

Sam smiles slightly.

INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

The basement door is wide open. Gladys mixes food in a

bowl. A cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip.

A male tarantula moves across the ceiling. The creature

is the size of a pit bull. Two quivering palps flank

dart-sized fangs. Multiple eyes the size of quarters.

Hair all over.

CONTINUED:

Gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her. As

she works, the spider shadows her. Every time the spider

is about to strike, she goes another direction to get

spices, utensils, a pan.

Gladys places her bowl on the stove. Suddenly the

tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her.

Gladys shrieks. The tarantula lashes out at her. Gladys

grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she

stumbles backward. The spider reels, striking the burner

knobs, turning on the gas.

Gladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks

back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As she

goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her.

Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the

webline prevents her from slotting it home.

Gladys strains with all    her might, finally slots the

fuse. She turns toward     the kitchen just in time to see

the broken burner spark    to life. The gas ignites. The

tarantula is engulfed in    flame.

Gladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her

back when a second male tarantula nails her with a

webline. Gladys screams as she's dragged across the

floor toward the basement door.

The fire grows more intense, spreading quickly.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Deputy Pete throws open the door.

CONTINUED:

OFF Chris's look.

EXT. BURNING MUSEUM - DAY

The museum burns. The volunteer fire department attacks

the conflagration. All the locals are there to help.

Sam's COP CAR SKIDS to a stop. Chris leaps out. Stares

at the fire for a beat. And then he charges toward the

inferno. Sam tackles him from behind. Pinning him to

the ground.

The museum collapses.     Chris watches it burn to the

ground.

EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)

The fire is out. The once-proud building is now a

smoldering pile of rubble. Locals stand in small groups.

Chris wanders through the ruins as    firemen mop up. He

picks something out of the char.     The map of the mines.

Almost completely burned. Soaked     with water. He stares

at it for a heavy beat. All that     remains of his legacy.

Sam steps up.

Sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.

Chris hesitates for a moment. And then he lets the map

fall. He walks out of the ruins with Sam.

CONTINUED:

Mike stands off to the side. He spots something near the

edge of the ruins. He goes over to pick it up. It's a

piece of arachnid exoskeleton. A spider's leg. Big.

Very big. Travis the fire chief warns him away.

Mike hurries clear with his prize. He puts it on the

ground, sketches the outline of a spider to fit the scale

of the leg.

Mike looks around for his mom.         He sees her driving off

in the cop car with Chris.

EXT. PALMER HOUSE - DUSK

The sun hangs low in the sky.         Sam's cop car parks beside

Bret's monster truck.

INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

Ashley watches TV. A doctor resuscitates a dying patient

with CPR. The doctor counts as he pumps the man's chest.

Ashley watches intently.       The patient is revived.

Ashley hears KEYS in the front DOOR. She quickly

switches channels to MTV. Sam enters with Chris.

CONTINUED:

Ashley starts crying. Sam goes to comfort her daughter.

Chris stands by in shock. Watching, Upset.

Ashley runs off to her room.       Sam follows.

Chris stands alone for a beat. He walks to the kitchen

and pulls a bottle of Vodka from the freezer. He puts

the cold bottle against his head and neck. Trying to

cool off.

Mike bursts into the house carrying his piece of

exoskeleton. He sees Chris opening the bottle of vodka.

Chris looks at Mike for a moment.

Chris drinks vodka straight from the bottle.

That got Chris's attention.

CONTINUED:

Chris has another gulp of vodka as Mike holds up his

Cassiopeia full of spider data. He shows Chris a video

of a male tarantula mummifying its food. Chris watches

in amazement.

Sam enters the room in time to overhear this.

Chris looks up at Sam.

Mike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton.

Sam flinches, dropping the object to the floor.

Mike does an odd flicking motion.       Kind of like a dog

scratching a flea.

CONTINUED:

The group looks to the window, the sun hangs low in the

sky.

EXT. TOWN - DUSK

Prosperity is bathed in sunset. The mine shaft entrances

are clearly visible. Like black holes of malevolent

promise.

INT. PALMER HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

The garage is cluttered. Old station wagon. Bikes.

Skis. Sam leads Chris to a bag full of her ex-husband's

clothes.

Chris shifts awkwardly.     In shock.   Sad.   Sam holds up a

flannel shirt.

Sam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of. He takes it

and proceeds to take off his old soot-stained shirt.

Sam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis. He's buttoning

up the new shirt. Chris takes the pants. He doesn't

register Sam ogling his exposed chest.

CONTINUED:

Chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants.

Sam glimpses Chris through car windows. The poor guy's

struggling to pull on some 501s. Sam turns away, but

catches sight of him in a propped-up glass door.

She turns, only to see him in a mirror. He steps out

from behind the car. Sam stares at him.

INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - SUNSET

A melancholy N'SYNC ballad plays over a BOOM BOX. Ashley

sits on her bed with her back to the open window. The

sun setting in the distance. She rips up the photographs

of Bret.

CONTINUED:

Ashley doesn't notice the Great Dane-sized spitting

spider crawling in through her window. It is striped

like a jungle predator.

It comes all the way into the room and then lingers among

Ashley's stuffed animal collection.

INT. MIKE'S ROOM - DUSK

Mike checks the phone. Still dead. He types at his

computer, entering the specification of the piece of

exoskeleton. A digital representation of a spider grows

on his monitor screen. Showing Mike exactly how big the

spider would be after shedding this skin. Mike is

distracted by the LOUD MUSIC coming from Ashley's room.

INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - DUSK

Ashley stops ripping. She goes to the pile of animals,

oblivious to the spider. The beast doesn't move. Ashley

grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly. She

returns to bed and cuts the bear's heart out with

scissors.

The spitting spider sneaks up behind Ashley. As it

moves, so does Ashley. She scoops up the torn photos and

mutilated bear, dumping them in the trash. She turns

around to find the giant spider on her bed. She freezes

momentarily.

Ashley sees her stun gun is on   the dresser. She lunges

for it. She's almost got it.     The spider squirts two

lines of gummy web at Ashley.    The glop hits her int he

chest, carries her backward.    Glues her to the wall.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Chris finishes   dressing. He faces Sam. There is an odd

moment as they   find themselves standing close. If the

circumstances   were different they'd probably end up

kissing. And    then they hear ASHLEY'S bloodcurdling

SCREAM.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Mike pops out of his door. Sam and Chris run down the

hallway. Sam yanks open the door to Ashley's room.

INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sam, Chris and Mike stand in the doorway staring at a

giant spider menacing Ashley. The spitter fires another

webby blast, sticking the girl's legs to the wall.

Chris pushes past Sam and Mike. He grabs a chair and

shoves it at the spitter like a lion tamer. The spider

backs off. Sam takes off running down the hallway.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sam runs up to find a gun case. She tries to get a

shotgun, but finds it locked. She doesn't have the key.

Sam grabs objects in the room and smashes the gun rack to

pieces.

INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Chris has the chair in one hand to fend off the spider.

With the other hand he tries to get Ashley out of the

webbing. Mike stands nearby reading from his Cassiopeia.

The spider hits Chris's chair with a blast of webbing.

The chair is blown from his hand, and stuck to the wall.

Chris stands weaponless before the spider.

Ashley is nailed in the face with another blast of goo.

Mouth sealed shut. Chris reaches under the bed and

pushes it over on to the spitter. The spider leaps clear

onto the wall.

CONTINUED:

Chris grabs the spitter from behind and drags it off the

wall. The spider turns to fight. Chris wrestles it to

the ground. He sees the fangs begin to move from side to

side and rolls clear of a point-blank web shot.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sam takes a purposeful step back and launches a spinning

roundhouse kick that snaps the shotgun out of its

binding. She grabs the bang stick and runs from the

room.

INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Chris puts himself between Ashley and the spider. He

looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but the

spitter nails him with a blast of glue. Chris is flung

across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of

his shirt. He shrugs out of it and makes another grab

for his scissors. He gets them.

The spider leaps at Chris... and EXPLODES in midair.

Bits of gore shower Chris. He stands to see Sam in the

door with her shotgun. Chris is covered in spider guts.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sam finishes loading new shells into her shotgun and then

pops a fresh clip into her 9mm. Chris comes out of the

garage wearing clean clothes. Sam chucks him the pistol.

CONTINUED:

Chris tries to put the gun in his pocket. And then his

waistband. But these damn pants are too tight.

Ashley uses scissors to cut web out of her hair.

Ashley is about to hyperventilate.

Sam ka-chacks a fresh round into her shotgun.

Sam checks the phone.     It's dead.

CONTINUED:

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - PALMER HOUSE- NIGHT

Chris and Sam open the front door of the house.          Sam

looks one way. Chris the other.

No giant spiders lurking about. Chris and Sam continue

onto the lawn. Mike and Ashley watch from the safety of

the doorway. They listen to the comforting SOUNDS OF a

SUMMER NIGHT.

Mike and Ashley move out of the doorway.          Joining the

adults. They move toward the cop car.

The cop car cruises. The occupants peer out the windows.

Everything appears normal. Although no people are

visible.

Harlan is broadcasting.

Harlan is startled as Sam and the others enter with guns.

CONTINUED:

Harlan's jaw drops.    Sam takes the microphone.

EXT. STREET (TOWN) - NIGHT

Wolf spiders crawl across rooftops. Spitters scale

buildings Tarantulas lurk in the shadows. Jumpers

scuttle out of the mineshafts. Trapdoors prepare their

burrows.

INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

This funky old couple relaxes in their LaZee-Boys.

The forelegs of a tarantula reach over the top of the

man's recliner, yanking him clean out. The woman is

oblivious as her husband is dragged away across the

floor.

EXT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - NIGHT

Emma bursts out of the front door, screaming

hysterically. Hank is behind her with the SawzAll. A

wolf spider crawls after them from inside the house.

loses power. Drops the saw and runs for his life.

INT. BARBERSHOP - NIGHT

Floyd and Leroy use brooms to fend off several wolf

spiders.

INT. DINER - NIGHT

A spider eats the chef. The waitress roller-skates away

from an arachnid. She jumps through the window into the

Harlan has donned a vintage football helmet and pads.

Sam sees the microphone is keyed.

Harlan notices long spider legs passing the window.

EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Sam and the    others spill out of the trailer. They head

for the cop    car. As they get closer, a wolf spider

climbs onto    the car's roof and gnaws on the light bar.

Sam raises    her gun to blast it.

Sam leads the others toward town.

EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Chris and Sam hang onto the panicked kids. Harlan brings

up the rear. The place is chaos. People are chased by

spiders. Dragged by spiders. Killed by spiders. Eaten

by spiders.

The group flees a trio of goo-firing spitters.    Suddenly

a familiar mini-van races past.

Harlan tries to flag down the speeding ride but sees...

The van's occupants are locked in combat with a jumper.

The beast is inside their vehicle and tearing them to

pieces. The van crashes.

EXT. POWER LINES (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - NIGHT

A group of orb weavers scurry across power lines. They

hit a transformer, shorting it out. The entire town is

suddenly plunged into darkness. Headlights. GUNFIRE.

Moonlight. Spotty illumination for the arachnids'

feeding frenzy.

EXT. ALLEY (TOWN) - NIGHT

A dumpster. The lid rises slightly. Wade Hale peers out

from within. He lifts the lid higher, oblivious to the

wolf spider on top of it. The spider reaches down at

him.

The spider is suddenly BLOWN AWAY by Sam and Chris.      Wade

climbs out of the dumpster.

Chris and Sam move on with the kids. Wade runs after

them. Mike looks at garbage-covered Wade.

Chris gives Sam a funny look.       Maybe Gladys was right...

EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Sam leads her group down toward the mall. Other groups

of survivors do likewise. As they get closer to the mall

the groups coalesce into one large pack. We recognize

Deputy Pete. Fireman Travis. The roller-skating

waitress. Floyd. Leroy. Hank. Emma. And many other

locals.

EXT. DESERT (NEAR MALL) - NIGHT

Sam and Chris are at the front of the mob with their

kids.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly a trapdoor spider pops out of the ground. It

grabs Travis the fire chief, and pulls him under, quickly

replacing the roof of its den. TRAVIS SCREAMS

underground.

Mike consults his Cassiopeia.

The group wheels at the MUFFLED SOUNDS. They see

nothing. They hear another MUFFLED SCREAM, and the top

of the spider's den pops up. Travis drags himself out of

it.

He is dragged back underground.

The group continues toward the mall entrance. Suddenly a

gun-toting hunter is grabbed by a trapdoor. He goes

cyclic, madly FIRING his GUN into the air as he's dragged

under.

More beasts rise out of their dens.       Reaching for the

humans.

Chris and the others flee toward the mall.          Some of them

SHOOT at the spiders as they run.

Leroy is grabbed by a trapdoor. Floyd tries to help but

the spider plunges its fangs into poor Leroy, dragging

him under.

The group clears the trapdoor minefield. But some of the

spiders have vacated their dens and are coming after

them.

EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Chris and Sam and the kids lead just fifteen other

survivors to the glass doors. The doors are locked.

Wade pulls out a ring of fifty keys and fumbles with them

desperately.

The group sees Norman the dope dealer janitor approaching

out of the gloom. He's staring at them all curiously.

Sam points her gun at him.   Norman raise his hands in

shock.

Norman unlocks the door and lets the group in.

INT. MALL - NIGHT

The survivors hustle inside. They lock the glass doors

behind them. The spiders are still coming.

The spiders begin smashing through the glass doors.

Chris and Sam SHOOT to keep them back. People flee into

the mall.

CONTINUED:

Wade and Norman proceed to lower the slotted steel

security gates. Only problem is: Sam and Chris are on

the other side.

Sam and Chris see the gate coming down. They run for it

and slide underneath just as the gate comes down. A

massive trapdoor slams up against the metal. But the

metal holds.

Norman and Chris run toward the opposite end of the mall.

INT. MALL - SOUTH ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Chris and Norman arrive. Spiders are SMASHING through

the GLASS. Chris and Norman bring the gate down. They

back away as more spiders slam against the steel.

Chris and Norman head back to join the others.   They

find...

INT. HOME AND GARDEN STORE (MALL) - NIGHT

The survivors gather makeshift weapons. Floyd take a

chainsaw off the wall. Norman practices swinging a heavy

sledgehammer, accidentally toppling a stack of paint

cans. Hank stands before a display of circular buzz

saws.

Chris goes to where Sam doles out the few firearms.

Sam hands Chris a shotgun.    He tries to get the feel of

it.

CONTINUED:

Chris tries it out, pumping the slide. A shell flies out

the slide of the weapon and hits Wade in the head.

Sam shakes her head and takes the gun back.       She pulls a

machete off the wall and hands it to Chris.

INT. MALL - NIGHT

The place has the feeling of a fortress under a siege.

Separate groups of townspeople are stationed at the

entrances to watch the spiders' every move.

CONTINUED:

The group looks up. The moon-cast shadow of the antenna

is visible on the skylights that run the length of the

mall.

INT. MALL - NIGHT

Wade leads Chris and Harlan toward an access door. Sam

stands with her kids. Watching. Chris looks over his

shoulder for one last look. Sam runs up to him, gives

him the shotgun.

lips.

Wade holds open the nearby access door.

Chris and Harlan head out. Sam watches them disappear

through the door and then returns to the survivors.

INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT

door at the top is identified as "Roof Access." Wade

reaches the door. The others bunch up behind him.

Wade slowly opens the roof door.

EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris and Harlan step onto the roof with their gear.       No

sign of any spiders.

CONTINUED:

Wade closes the door behind them and locks it.       Chris and

Harlan aren't happy to hear that LOCK TURN.

They sneak across the roof toward the base of the

antenna.

Harlan starts climbing. Chris stands guard at the

bottom. Neither of them sees the horde of spiders

climbing up the side of the building toward the roof.

INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - MALL - NIGHT

Mike collects perfume. Packing it into his pockets like

grenades. Ashley is nearby, checking out the lingerie.

Sam steps in through the door.

The kids run out to join their mom.       After they go...

The grill of an air vent is pushed open. A huge spitting

spider pushes its way through. Dropping to the floor.

Another spider follows.

EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is high up on the antenna. He has a cell phone in

hand. It still indicates: "NO SERVICE." He keeps

climbing.

EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris sees spiders flood onto the roof.

CONTINUED:

He tries to COCK the SHOTGUN.        Ejecting a shell out the

side.

Chris gets it figured out just in time to BLAST an

attacking spider. He fades back toward the antenna.

SHOOTING.

EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan checks the phone.

He dials 911.

EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris is surrounded by spiders.        He starts climbing up

the antenna.

EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is on the phone.       He hears...

Chris yells up to him.

CLICK. The LINE GOES DEAD. Chris climbs up beside him.

He FIRES several BLASTS at the approaching spiders.

The spiders are closing in as Harlan re-dials.

CLICK.

Chris FIRES the SHOTGUN.       The spiders are closing in.

INT. MALL - NIGHT

Sam gazes up at the skylight. She can see the silhouette

of Chris and Harlan climbing the antenna. Pursued by

spiders.

Ashley screams in horror nearby.

CONTINUED:

Sam whirls to see Ashley pointing at several spiders

coming out of Victoria's Secret. Sam runs over to fight

them.

He faces off against more spiders coming through the Home

and Garden store.

EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is at the top. Chris is a bit lower. The spiders

are still coming. Chris SHOOTS at them. His GUN RUNS

DRY. He flips it around and butt-strokes an approaching

arac.

A spider fires a web at Harlan.       Nails the poor guy.   And

drags him off the antenna.

Harlan falls off the antenna, back toward the spiders.

Chris reaches out and grabs him. Holding Harlan's hand.

Harlan makes eye-contact with Chris.       They're both about

to be killed unless...

Harlan jerks away from Chris's hand. He cannonballs down

into the horde of spiders. Splattering several of the

beasts along with himself.

Chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac

and climbs even higher. He pulls out his machete and

begins hacking at the guide-wires that hold the antenna

upright.

The spiders close in. Chris slices one wire. The

antenna quivers. Chris slices another wire. The antenna

shakes.

INT. MALL - NIGHT

Deputy Pete is standing with Sam and the kids when he's

jerked off his feet and hauled into the maw of an

arachnid.

CONTINUED:

She sees Mike and Ashley avoid an arac by taking refuge

inside the tunnels of the jungle gym.

Sam FIRES the GUNS like Annie Oakley, putting spiders

down left and right, trying to reach her kids.

Floyd the barber confronts a spider with his chain-saw.

The spider charges.     Floyd slices its legs off.

He slices another arac.

EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Chris dodges a spider's webline.       Several more come at

him.

Chris cuts the last wire and hikes out over the skylight.

The antenna keels over. Chris hangs tight as he drops

toward the glass.

INT. MALL - NIGHT

Sam looks up to   see Chris come crashing down through the

skylight on the   antenna. The antenna tilts in at a sixty

degree angle.    Chris hangs off the end. Orb weavers ride

their weblines   down to the floor of the mall.

Mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym. He sees a

hundred spiders coming in on webs. Flooding out of the

stores. The devil-spawned monsters are everywhere!

Chris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web. He slides

down it like a pole, squashing the orb weaver at the

bottom. Sam runs to his side.

CONTINUED:

Sam tosses him a gun and they head toward the jungle gym.

The waitress roller-skates away from the spiders. She

slaloms clear of several spitters. But gets tackled by a

jumper.

INT. MALL - JUNGLE GYM

Ashley and Mike are hiding.

Ashley starts to move out   of the tube. She discovers the

end has been covered with   web. She pushes it. Something

on the other side pushes   back. Ashley scrambles back.

Mike is already moving.    The kids flee through the tubes

to get away.

They see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a

spider coming through it. Mike tosses one of his perfume

grenades at the spider, covering their retreat.

Another spider comes after them through one of the tubes.

Mike chucks another perfume bottle. The spider cowers.

Ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide.

She starts down with Mike close behind. A large spider

looms at the end. Ashley tries to arrest her slide. But

it's no use. At the last second Sam's boot kicks the

arachnid clear.

INT. MALL - NIGHT

Ashley and Mike pour out of the slide. Chris and Sam

finish off the spider and then run with the kids.

Emma runs parallel to them across the playground's

sandbox. Only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider.

Hank sees this and goes after the spiders with all his

tools. Getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand.

Floyd is still going crazy, slicing spiders with his

chain-saw, he lets out a victorious yell until a hungry

spider descends on him from above and knocks him to the

floor.

Chris passes a clothing store displaying Levi 501s.    He

stops for a moment to look at the jeans.

Chris continues on.

All of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and

prepare for Custer's last stand. Spiders charge from all

directions.

Mike throws his perfume grenades. Sam and Chris SHOOT.

Others use their make-shift weapons.

Norman pulls out a joint and sparks it.    Mike sees this

and gets an idea.

Norman takes a hit on his reefer.

Norman sees the army of spiders closing in.

CONTINUED:

Norman opens    an access door. Sam and the other survivors

run over and    crowd through it. Norman shuts the door

behind them.     The groups of pursuing spiders collide and

begin ripping    each other to pieces in a feeding frenzy.

INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT

Norman leads the survivors down the tight hallway.

INT. MALL - BASEMENT POT ROOM - NIGHT

Norman leads the survivors into a basement room full of

pot paraphernalia. Hookahs. Weed growing in hydroponic

units under battery powered lights. Psychedelic posters.

The group can hear SPIDERS BASHING at the upstairs door.

Chris moves to the bottom of the stairs.

Suddenly a loud BANGING ERUPTS on the wall behind them.

The group tightens up. Back to back. Ready for the end.

Suddenly a human hand punches through the wall.

CONTINUED:

Bret Hale rips through the drywall. Filthy but alive.

Standing in a horizontal mine shaft. He sees Sam's gun

pointed right at him.

Sam looks at Ashley.

Wade embraces his son.

Chris steps to the opening for a closer look at the mine.

The BANGING on the upper door gets more INTENSE.

Norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered

grow lights from his weed farm. He passes them out to

the group.

Chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the

mine shaft. Bret is shocked as the others follow him.

The group uses the grow lights, and flashlights.

Bret is alone in the room as the upper DOOR IMPLODES and

spiders flood downstairs. Bret dives through the

opening.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Bret runs past Sam and Chris. Sam FIRES her SHOTGUN at

the first spider that enters the tunnel. Her GUN CLICKS

DRY. She un-holsters her PISTOLS and FIRES.

Chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel's upper

support beam. More spiders come into the tunnel. Sam

FIRES desperately. Chris keeps on hacking.

Sam's GUNS CLICK DRY. Spiders charge. Chris swings the

machete hard. The ROOF COLLAPSES onto the attacking

spiders.

Chris and Sam leap back. Landing in a heap. Clouds of

dust swirl around them. They are tangled up for an

awkward beat. Their faces just inches from each other...

They manage to disengage and move on.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris and Sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few

remaining survivors.

Chris takes point with the others following nervously.

INT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHT

A boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD

SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file

into a slightly more open area with two branching

tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with

barrels of toxic waste.

Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the

barrel in the drainage ditch.

Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel.

Chris and the others look at Wade.

CONTINUED:

Sam punches him.     Knocking Wade to the ground.

Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others

follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after

them.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across

bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs

runs along the roof into both tunnels.

They continue down the tunnel.     Entering...

INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

A large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground.

Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches.

The others are reacting strongly.

CONTINUED:

Norman swallows his glowing joint.

Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.

Bret looks around nervously.

The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a

horrifying sight. Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh

balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull.

He's completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid

drained away.

Mike hides his eyes.     Ashley comforts him.

Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete.       The

web comes away to reveal a human hand.

Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help.

They finally reveal Gladys.

The woman's body begins to spasm.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly Ashley pushes her way forward.

Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV.

Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air.

Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris.

From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo.

Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the

cavern. The group turns their lights on it. The

reflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross the

cavern walls.

Chris checks it out.

Chris helps Gladys to her feet.         They share an emotional

look of recognition.

CONTINUED:

Wade chips away at the gold.

Bret looks at Ashley.

Ashley acknowledges him. Bret chips gold with Wade.           Sam

puts her hand on Ashley's shoulder.

Ashley smiles.

Gladys leans over to Norman.

The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas

scuttling out of the shadows.

Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his

boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can.

Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the

squashed bodies.

Chris and Sam look over.

CONTINUED:

Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the

dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL.

Chris reacts to the noise.    He can guess what's coming...

The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela

has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far

the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair.

Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes.

Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.

The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is

something weird there. A lot of weird things. In

fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby

tarantulas.

As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized

quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain

spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.

Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him

tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper,

chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.

The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern.        A

male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam

BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away

bits of gold.

Wade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a

nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms

behind him.

CONTINUED:

Bret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for

him. Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's

chest and he's hauled backward. The tarantula flings

Wade into the cave.

Bret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing

more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bret

leaps into harm's way. He's turned into a pin cushion.

Ashley goes to his side.

Bret dies.     Sam drags Ashley away from him.

INT. MINES - NIGHT

The survivors flee along the tunnel. Chris jumps up to

rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling.

Chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand.

Chris looks at Gladys.

CONTINUED:

Sam and Chris share a brief beat. And then Chris pulls

down the lights, dragging them back toward the

tarantula's den.

INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

Chris comes through with his light bulb fuse. Consuela

and her babies are feasting on the bodies of Bret and

Wade Hale.

Chris finds a vent in the ground.       He sprinkles dust over

it to identify a faint draft.

He positions the shattered light bulb beside this gas

jet.

INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

Mike helps Gladys up the tunnel. Sam and Ashley are

behind. Suddenly a male tarantula steps out of the

shadows, separating the groups.

CONTINUED:

Sam and Ashley flee down another tunnel.

INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

Chris finishes preparing the booby trap. He gets up to

leave. Only to find Consuela coming toward him.

Chris runs out of the cavern.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris bails out of the cavern and starts running.

INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

Sam and Ashley flee the male tarantula. Sam stumbles

over something on the ground. It's Bret Hale's lost

motorcycle. Ashley looks back and sees the tarantula

coming after them.

Sam lifts the MOTORCYCLE upright and climbs on. She

STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE. Ashley leaps aboard. Sam

accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. The

bike's headlight illuminates their path.

The male tarantula scurries after the bike.

Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. Ashley hangs

on tight. They've put some distance between themselves

and the male tarantula. A dead-end looms before them.

Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180.

Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward

the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's

shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite

direction.

CONTINUED:

Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears.

With perfect timing, she brings the front wheel down hard

onto the tarantula's back. Crunch! The spider is

roadkill. Sam steers them down another tunnel.

EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN

Mike and Gladys gather at a generator just shy of the

tunnel exit. Mike tries to start the generator. It

won't catch.

Gladys heads over toward Wade's ranch.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris runs along the tunnel. Consuela charges after him,

Chris reaches up, smashing more light bulbs as he runs.

EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN

Mike is at the generator as Sam and Ashley ride up on the

motorcycle.

Sam tips over the motorcycle, trying to get gas out of

the tank. It's clear this is not going to work.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris runs.     Smashing light bulbs.   Consuela close

behind.

EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN

Sam has dumped some fuel into the generator.   She tries

to start it. It won't turn over.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris ducks as Consuela fires quills at him.   He keeps

going.

INT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - DAWN

Sam sees Chris at the bottom of the tunnel. She tries to

start the generator again but it refuses to cooperate.

Sam turns as Ashley throws her the STUN GUN. Sam catches

it and brings it down to the light bulb cable... ZAPPING

it.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

As Chris runs, the light bulbs illuminate sequentially,

traveling past him into the cavern.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

A broken light bulb sparks. The filament ignites the

gas-filled tunnel. A ball of flame spreads throughout

the mines.

INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - DAWN

A huge column of flame blasts into the chamber. All the

gold is illuminated. Consuela's babies are burned like

popcorn.

EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

Sam looks back to see Chris running toward her. Consuela

is on his heels. The glow of a fireball is right behind

them.

Chris looks over his shoulder at Consuela and the flames.

Chris makes it to Sam just ahead of the conflagration.

EXT. DESERT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

Sam and Chris dive out of the mine opening. A pillar of

flame shoots out behind them.   Ashley and Mike are

nearby. The town is visible just a mile away.

EXT. TOWN - DAY

The spiders retreat from daylight. Scuttling back into

the buildings. Heading down into the mine shafts.

INT. VARIOUS MINE TUNNELS - DAY

The chain reaction spreads through the mines.      Jets of

flame blast up tunnels.

Torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home.

Rupturing the very earth around them.

EXT. DESERT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

The EARTH BEGINS TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY.

Gladys drives up in     Wade's humvee.   Cigar in mouth.

CONTINUED:

The survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to

BLOW UP in the distance.

Chris is just about to climb aboard when... A webline

shoots out of the nearby mine shaft. Consuela lives!

The spider is charred and bloody. But she's primed for

revenge.

Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her.            He

fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline.

Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on

Consuela's fangs.

Consuela knocks away Chris's machete and lunges down at

him. Chris kicks her belly with both his feet. Consuela

begins to shudder. Jagged cracks appear in her charred

carapace. Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor.

He thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually

helping it!

Mike and the others watch from the humvee.

Consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the

damaged skin away from her body. Chris is amazed to see

the spider has grown a full size larger and become

totally rejuvenated!

Consuela comes after Chris.        He defends himself with the

machete.

Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs.

Once again Consuela punts away the machete. She prepares

the death blow. It looks like curtains for Chris.

The massive spider stops in shock.            Chris looks back to

see Mike has returned.

TARANTULA POV

The familiar multi-perspective spider vision.            The

tarantula seems to recognize Mike.

BACK TO MIKE

He throws his Cassiopeia PDA at the spider's face...

Chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete

and drive it deep into the spider's unprotected

abdomen...

The tarantula screams.

Chris leaps up and runs, scooping up Mike.   They dive

into the back of the humvee.

Consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded. She

collapses in the dust. The TOWN EXPLODES in the b.g.

The earth itself begins to collapse.

INT. HUMVEE - DRIVING ACROSS DESERT - DAY

Gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance.

BUILDINGS EXPLODE. Jets of flame burst upward. The mall

is sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth. The

humvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling

desert.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The humvee reaches open road. The survivors watch out

the back as Prosperity disappears into a massive

sinkhole.

EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY

The group sits in a long beat of abject shock. And then

Chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally

ripped.

The group smiles.    Happy to be alive.

Everyone looks to the road ahead. A familiar bunny

rabbit hops across the highway. Gladys HONKS and swerves

to avoid it.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward

safety.

CONTINUED:

The rabbit continues its trek for a moment, and then is

grabbed by a large trap-door spider.
