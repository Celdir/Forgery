INT. LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY

The hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is

speaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is

a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,

FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and

TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser

pointing device.  We see her from a considerable

distance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and

assured.

During the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera

has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the

balcony railing.

CLOSEUP: HELEN

Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in

the balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.

HELEN'S POV:

Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED

MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed

arms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.

HELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:

Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly

alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of

exposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the

wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to

attention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...

Their POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer

there.

HELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:

Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself

that the smiling man is not there...

Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They are

carefully casing the crowd.

LATER:

The crowd is breaking up.  FIRST COP walks HELEN to the

ladies' room.  People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes

as well as she can with her fear.  THEY LEAVE THE STAGE

THROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO

DRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...

INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY

THE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks

around.  Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS.  He

hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.

Before the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to

stand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the

high heels to a stall several doors down.

CLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:

And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the

ankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear from

view as

HELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper

around the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise

makes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is

just able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES

DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.

Like a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently

yanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door.

CORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears

the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He

reacts...

INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED

The RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a

hook inside his own stall.  KNOCKING (o.s.)

The MAN lets slip a little slack.

HELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,

get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little

scream.

CORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous

sounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for

a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now

there is more SOUND from inside...

INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

COP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S shoulder

we see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at

her throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the

toilet seat.

COP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back we

see a broom closet door opening.

HELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a

second, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he falls,

his gun still in his hand.

RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at

HELEN.

COP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractions

in his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,

the sound reverberating against the tile walls.

STAGE AREA

The audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.

HELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.

INT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

As HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try

desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck.  She is now

pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her

eyes.  This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.

She races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT

FEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a

hall.  She looks in, gasping for breathing...

INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

The room is neat -- nobody there.  (We will later see that it

is used on and off by her computer, Andy.)

HELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone.  SHE TALKS TO

HERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,

where she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)

The sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm

herself with the sound of her own voice...

CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  Two pills are shaken out into a palm,

others scattering from the nervous haste...

CLOSE: HELEN  Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she

tosses down the pills, gulps water.  She regards her haggard

reflection with a certain detachment...

She barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will

herself from near-hysteria to relative calm...

HALL  As she exits the bathroom.  And moves into her OFFICE.

She pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.

Of the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank.  The

other shows a chess setup.  Flashing on the bottom of the

screen comes a command.

She studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a

move.  She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other

computer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.

HELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.

She pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window

curtains open.  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN!  We see that the

T-shirt HELEN wears says "Shrinks 'R' Us."  She crosses to

the window with her glass of cognac, looks out.

VIEW:

A sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County.  The

morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.

HELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to

the

air, the freedom.  Feeling quite restored from the dream

horror of the night...

O.S., THE PHONE RINGS.  HELEN.  A FRISSON.

CLOSE: PHONE  Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the

handset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.

Stiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone.

On the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his

move: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice:

OVER CREDITS:

HOME MOVIE of a young woman dressed in a seat suit.  It is

morning, and she is jogging on a park path.  Her hair is in

a long braid.  She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly

near the end of a satisfactory run.

THE FILM REVERSES, THE FILM STARTS UP AGAIN IN EXTREMELY

SLOW MOTION.  WE ARE NOW AWARE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW

AT WORK HERE.

NOW THE FRAME FREEZES AT A POINT WHERE IT MAKES THE JOGGER'S

OPEN-MOUTHED DEEP BREATHING LOOK LIKE

A SCREAM!

END TITLE AND CREDITS:

INT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY

MUZZLE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL BLASTS NINE SHOTS ALMOST

DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA.  A BEAT OF SILENCE...

THE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso;

centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the

shoulder, is a small red circle.  Still SMOKING, THE HOLES

FROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none

in the circle.

THE SHOOTER, RUBEN GOETZ, AND PARTNER M.J.

We now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J.

HALLORAN.  M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking

young woman.  She is neat, buttoned down, crisp.  M.J.

appears to be about twenty-five.  She is, in fact,

thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of

sergeant.  She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose

sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear

even smaller and younger than she is.

RUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior

in authority to M.J.  RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored

and laid back.  He has a cellular phone attached to his

belt.

M.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM,

AND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.

safer with

The target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back

to shooting position.

RUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the

circle.  M.J. looks at him in surprise.

M.J. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.

SOUND: A CELLULAR PHONE (ON RUBENS' BELT).  M.J. holds her

fire.

She's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he

answers, she raises her gun and aims...

He hits the "end" button...

SHE FIRES!  The shots make a perfect heart around the circle,

inside his looser pattern.  ONE FINAL SHOT STRIKES EXACTLY

IN THE MIDDLE!

He slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be.

She is unloading her weapon...

She is unloading and cleaning up.  Ruben doing the same...

Ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which

he has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks

one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...

They're on the move; as they go away from us...

EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

They pull up in front of an apartment building in the

Pacific Heights section.  Patrol cars flank the street, the

thick yellow ticker tape "POLICE CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS"

is already up.  M.J. double parks beside a blue-and-white.

A couple of cars from the media are already there.  SUSAN

SCHIFFER a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay

M.J. and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk...

She is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak

of a life of orthodontics and dreams of TV anchorship.

QUINN, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide

stands at the top of the steps leading to the front door.

As they climb up toward him...

M.J. and Ruben enter...

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - HALL - DAY

Four uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises;

at the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman

chain-smoking (the Landlady).

Mike answers her question by answering to Ruben!

She glances at him, at the SLIGHTLY OLD INFLECTION ON THE "I

DIDN'T."  But moves on, as Ruben goes to the Landlady...

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

The same YOUNG WOMAN we saw jogging, is now dead.  Hair

still in a long braid.  She wears only a blouse, open and

pushed back.  She is on her back in the bathtub, with one

leg dangling over the side of the tub.  The effect is

slightly posed, but casual, relaxed.

Bending over her is DOC, the Coroner, WITHDRAWING A HUGE

MEAT THERMOMETER FROM HER SIDE.

M.J. APPEARS IN THE BACK OF THE SHOT taking in the scene.

Foreground, Doc reads the thermometer.  The photographer is

finishing up his shots.  The room is crowded.  Two Coroner's

men wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between

them; M.J. has to pass between them to come down to the

body.  THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON M.J.'S FACE; HER REACTION TO

THE SCENE, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON THE SCENE ITSELF.

ON M.J.:

THE TELEPHONE RINGS.

Nobody laughs...

She picks up the phone after the second ring, holding

it in tissue someone hands her...

M.J. gently hangs up the phone.  She has been looking at the

Dead Woman... They pick up where they left off.

No answer as the Coroner's men crowd in beside M.J. to begin

lifting the body out of the tub.  M.J. takes one last look

into the dead woman's eyes...

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Ruben still talking to the Landlady and taking notes.  M.J.

approaches Mike... takes him aside...

Mike is acutely uncomfortable.

She seems relieved.  Brightly:

EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

In the door, M.J. appears, looking out thoughtfully over the

scene; Ruben appears behind her.  The photographer is coming

out...

But M.J. is already on to other things.

INT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY

CLOSE ON A FOLDED NEWSPAPER THAT LIES ON THE FLOOR FIVE OR

FIX FEET FROM THE DOOR TO HELEN'S APARTMENT.  HOLD DOOR IN

B.G.

The door opens and Helen looks out, wasted from cognac and

Xanax.  She looks for the newspaper and sees it with a look

of despair.

HELEN'S POV

The newspaper lies there, out of reach.

HELEN

As she stretches out her foot toward the paper, can't reach

it.

POV.  As she moves out into the hall her agoraphobia

manifests itself: DISTORTED VISION THAT MAKES THE HALL

STRETCH AND THE WALLS TAKE ON EXAGGERATED PERSPECTIVE;

SICKENING -- VERTIGO!  The newspaper seems further away.

HELEN  She drops to her knees and tries to lean out further

into the hall...

POV.  The floor seems to melt and roll in waves toward her.

The newspaper melts like a Dali watch.

HELEN sweats.  She lies flat on her stomach and crawls toward

the newspaper... and with a supreme effort grabs it and

squirms back inside.

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

As she slams the door shut on the hall, and sits gasping for

breath.  After a moment she can bring herself to look at the

newspaper... INSERT:

POLICE BAFFLED IN DEATHS OF THE WOMEN

INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - DAY

QUINN is watching a portable TV screen with profound distrust.

Onscreen is SUSAN SCHIFFER.

There is a knock, but before QUINN can respond, M.J. enters.

He and M.J. both listen to SUSAN.

M.J. TURNS OFF THE TV, FACES QUINN...

A long moment of looking at each other.  Then...

And she starts to go...

INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

This large room is very busy, many officers at work.  Known

sexual offenders have been rounded up.  False confessors add

to the crowd.  Detectives who are not dealing with these

people are making and taking calls.  At this desk, a tall

intense looking Detective, NICCOLETTI, interrogates a false

confessor, a man who looks like a businessman...

He has stood as M.J. passes coming from Quinn's office.  He

falls into stride with her through the crowded scene... He

is sweaty and sniffs his armpits as a matter of general

hygiene checkup...

It has the flavor of a spoiled intimacy, an unfinished

argument... He pantomimes she got him with a poison dart.

Ruben joins them; Nikko stifles and turns away...

They are approaching PACHULSKI'S desk.  PACHULSKI is on

phone.  Pachulski is looking at M.J., grinning...

He hits the speaker phone...

people?

M.J. signals for GIGI to trace the call.  Takes the phone,

switches off the speaker...

INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

HELEN on phone

Pachulski is delighted at the joke he's played on M.J., M.J.

not so much... Gigi signals they're getting it.

Gigi hands her a slip of paper... M.J. reads it... glares

at Pachulski who is still laughing.  M.J. knows the name on

the slip of paper...

As she turns back to the phone...

INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

HELEN, now wearing slippers and shorts with the same T-shirts

she slept in, is standing behind the living room curtains

looking down at the street.  She hears a code knock, then a

key turns in the lock.  She moves to greet ANDY her

assistant and friend.  ANDY is laden down with groceries and

mail.  HELEN immediately reaches a hand up to touch his

face...

He withdraws a popsicle from the bag, offers it to her.

When she rejects it, he takes it for himself.

They're in the kitchen area; Andy unpacking stuff...

expensive goodies...

it.

Andy now stops to address this seriously...

Her fear is so palpable, she is so nakedly vulnerable it

breaks his heart.  He puts his arms around her.

your

He pats her thighs... she walks to the window as he talks...

HELEN AT WINDOW

Andy has heard this tone before:  panic attack alert.

ANGLE AT WINDOW TO INCLUDE THEIR POV OF STREET

In a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his

face.  Behind him is parked a slightly beat up red Saab.

ANDY leaves the apartment.

EXT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S BUILDING - DAY

The heavy old industrial door is pushed slightly open, ANDY

peers out, sees:

ANDY crosses behind the car and then sneaks back, coming

up to Driver's side window, surprising the Driver.

THE NEWSPAPER DROPS:  IT'S RUBEN.

Usurping RUBEN'S aggressive attitude, ANDY leans his face

close to RUBEN'S window.

RUBEN grabs ANDY by the collar and yanks his head inside the

car.  With the other hand he pulls his gun and pushes it up

ANDY'S nose.

RUBEN pushes the 'up' button on the window, capturing ANDY'S

head in a deadlock.  Then he opens the door, gets out, slams

door, forcing the squawking ANDY into a helpless frisk

position.  We HEAR HELEN scream, (O.S.).  Ignoring this,

RUBEN begins to frisk ANDY.

M.J. APPROACHING IN HER OWN CAR, SEES THE ACTION, BRAKES

FAST AND GETS OUT.

HELEN at window, shouting.

INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Andy enters, followed by Ruben and M.J., who holds up her

badge to Helen.

Uncomfortable silence for a beat as they try to take in

what's happening, who's who and what's what.  Helen is

confused, fighting back fear...

The two women measure each other, Helen struggling to

control herself.  A beat.

called

M.J. regards her for a moment...

She dumps files of photos, etc., out on Helen's cocktail

table.

She pushes the pictures off onto the floor, tries to get up

to leave the room.  M.J. and Ruben are both appalled at the

force of what is happening: an all-out panic attack...

Andy races t o the kitchen; Ruben tries to help but Helen

fights him off viciously, gasping for air... Andy races

back in with a PLASTIC BAG HE PULLS OVER HELEN'S HEAD AND

FACE...  She hyperventilates into the bag...

THE PLASTIC BAG BALLOONS OUT AND BACK IN HELEN'S FACE until

she faints.  Andy deals with it like an everyday event,

treating her very gently...

He's making her comfortable.

M.J. starts to gather up the pictures and files.  She is

angry and disgusted.

M.J. takes in the scene; the now soundly sleeping Helen;

Andy sitting over her protectively, the files and photos

strewn around.  Makes a decision...

She's handing Andy her card...

EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

M.J. AND RUBEN come out in the street...  CAMERA IN A HIGH

ANGLE LOOKING DOWN ON THEM...

She jumps in her car, still steaming, leaving Ruben to move

to his car.  AS HE MOVES CAMERA FOLLOWS, BECOMING A WIDER

ANGLE TO INCLUDE FACADE OF HELEN'S APARTMENT.

We can SEE ANDY, SITTING WHERE WE LEFT HIM, HOLDING HELEN IN

HIS ARMS.  SHE SLEEPS PEACEFULLY.  DISTANTLY WE HEAR THE

PHONE RING.  ANDY SHOWS IMPATIENCE, THEN CAREFULLY

DISENGAGES FROM HELEN SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HER SLEEP.

HE MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM UNTIL HE IS OUT OF FRAME.  THE SHOT

HOLDS ON HELEN FOR A BEAT.  PHONE RINGS.

THEN THE CAMERA PANS LEFT (OUR FIRST CLUE THIS IS ANOTHER

POINT OF VIEW) ACROSS TO A SECOND WINDOW WHERE IT CATCHES

ANDY MOVING UNTIL WE AGAIN DISAPPEARS BEHIND THE BUILDING

WALL AND THE CAMERA PANS SMOOTHLY TO THE THIRD WINDOW, WHERE

ANDY ENTERS.  WE SEE HIM PICK UP THE PHONE AND SPEAK INTO

IT.  HE SEEMS IMPATIENT.

THEN CAMERA PANS DOWN TO A CELLULAR PHONE, F.G. AND FOCUS

RACKS TO E.C.U. AS A FINGER PUSHES THE "END" BUTTON.

CLOSE: ANDY

Putting down the phone.  Irritated...

INT. POLICE LIBRARY - DAY

CLOSE: AN ATTORNEY IN COURT

SHOW M.J. and Ruben watching videotapes, and eating Chinese

takeout.  HELEN is being interrogated by the ATTORNEY for

Daryll Lee Cullum.  Helen sure of herself to the point of

arrogance, which is her undoing...

Murmur of subdued laughter in court.

She catches herself.  The D.A. has leapt to his feet, but now

tries to sit down as though nothing was happening, but

Helen, the Attorney and the D.A. all are clearly disturbed

by the line this questioning is taking.

The D.A. is rushing to the bench to argue with the Judge.

FREEZE FRAMES.

NOW WE SEE M.J. AND RUBEN LOOKING AT HELEN on the TV screen,

THINKING...

THE DOOR OPENS AND QUINN ENTERS.

M.J. leaves a cautiously silent RUBEN.  Once the door shuts,

he turns tape back to 'play.'

EXT. OUTSIDE DOOR TO LIBRARY - DAY

I tell you

QUINN snorts, starts on his way, then turns back.

QUINN is somehow cheered by this little exchange.

He stomps off.

INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

HELEN on couch, ANDY is massaging her neck.

HELEN grins, and ANDY starts to tickle her, she laughs.

HELEN now laughing a little too hard.  Suddenly the laughter

changes to tears.

She clings desperately to him.  He rocks her as he would a

small child.

ANDY PRODUCES THE FILE M.J. LEFT WITH HIM.  Helen looks at

it.  Andy watches her...

He exits.  After a moment fighting her fears, Helen reaches

for the file.  She opens it and looks at the first picture.

THE PHONE RINGS.  She freezes... Panic hangs in the air...

Andy answers the phone in the kitchen...

Hangs up.  After a moment Helen bends to her work...

INT. POLICE LIBRARY - NIGHT

M.J. scanning microfilm newspaper & magazine clips.

M.J. hears NIKKO entering, looks up, gives him a half-smile,

returns her attention to the microfilm.

"ANOTHER ATTACK!"

"HUDSON VICTIM OF BLOODY ATTACK.  BODYGUARD SLAIN!"

M.J. turns off the microfilm.  The last headline is retained

on screen:

"ESCAPE KILLER CLAIMS NEW VICTIM"

M.J. looks at him at last with wry amusement: he's jealous

of Ruben?

used you.  I worked my way

The door opens and RUBEN enters, instantly takes in the

scene:  M.J. sitting in front of a stalled machine, NIKKO,

looming over her.  After an awkward beat, NIKKO heads for

the door.  Ignoring RUBEN, he barks at M.J.

RUBEN regards M.J., who busies herself examining the other

tapes.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENTIAL AREA - LATE DAY

IN THE UNMISTAKABLE STYLE OF THE CAMERA EYE WE HAVE SEEN

SHOOTING HELEN'S PLACE, IN THE PARK, ETC.:  A YOUNG

RED-HEADED WOMAN, wearing shorts and an open-necked shirt,

kneels on the grass, weeding a lush flowerbed.  The CAMERA

SWISHHPANS TO the back door of the house as a man comes out

balancing a tray with drinks.  The woman gives the man a

dazzling smile, removes her gardening glove and takes a

glass.  Her husband bends down, gives her a little kiss.

She beams.  FREEZE FRAME.

INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY

CLOSE UP:  early crime scene photos.

WE SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FIRST TWO MURDER VICTIMS, SO

WE SEE THE PATTERN HELEN DESCRIBES AND ANALYZES.

WE ARE NOW SEEING THE ROOM:  M.J. AND RUBEN, HELEN AT A TABLE

IN HER OFFICE LAYING OUT THE PICTURES.  Helen picks out one

picture from the rest...

M.J. nods, pleased with HELEN>

INSERT: THE PICTURE.  The victim's body is covered with

bruises.  But, unlike the others, her face has been covered.

BACK TO SCENE...

HELEN arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards.

She gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to

pictures of deSalvo's victims:  they are identical...

They are startled by his appearance!  A little unsettling.

Andy helps M.J. and Ruben scoop up the files...

As they leave, Andy is still at the door...

INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

HELEN sits at side-by-side computers.  The chess game is

again in progress.

HELEN makes a move.  Pleased with herself, she smiles,

types, "I'm creaming you."

Suddenly over HELEN'S shoulder, the other screen becomes

active, we see 'Message for Helen Hudson.'

Engrossed in her own chess game, she does not notice the

screen until, tense from sitting too long, with waiting for

CHESSMASTER'S move, HELEN begins to stretch her neck and

toll her head.  Now, out of the corner of her eye, she sees

the other screen.  Quickly, she clicks on this, and the

screen prints out 'A GAME FOR DR. HUDSON PLEASE RUN THIS

"TOMORROW.AVI" FILE ON YOUR PLAYER.'

HELEN TYPES 'WIN' AND WINDOWS SCREEN COMES UP.  WITH THE

MOUSE SHE CLICKS ON THE AVI PLAYER ICON, TYPES IN

"TOMORROW.AVI" AND HITS ENTER.

A PICTURE APPEARS: IT IS THE FACE OF THE WOMAN IN THE

BATHTUB.  IT CHANGES AFTER A TENTH OF A SECOND MORPHING

THROUGH A COLLAGE OF IMAGES OF TWO WOMEN.  A hand emerges

from a breast of the other.  Two heads.  One, properly on

its own neck, the other emerging from between two legs.

Hands, feet, breasts, hair of two bodies mixed mischievously

into one FINAL IMAGE OF A SECOND WOMAN ALIVE AND SMILING

ECSTATICALLY AT THE CAMERA.  Both women wear their hair in

long braids.

INTERCUT WITH HELEN: APPALLED.

ANDY LIES WITH TV ON, NAKED, GIVING HIMSELF A PEDICURE.  HE

HAS EARPHONES TO MUFFLE THE TV SOUND.  From the dark spaces

of the loft there

ECHOES A SCREAM OF SHEER TERROR FROM HELEN!  After a beat from he

realizes, tears off the earphones and bolts into the

darkness...

EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

POLICE CARS DRAW UP IN FRONT, DOUBLE PARKING.  M.J. and Ruben

jump out and walk, fast, toward the building... (Shot from

same high angle -- the secret watcher's POV -- from which we

saw M.J. and Ruben leave after their first visit.)

INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY

AS HER DOOR IS OPENED, by Andy.  Ruben and M.J. enter...

INT. HELEN'S OFFICE

The computer glow, the unfinished chess game still up, and

the RED-HEADED WOMAN'S joyful face on the other.  HELEN SITS

IN A CHAIR WITH HER BACK TO THE SCREEN, ROCKING BACK AND

FORTH, suppressing her fear by sheer will.  M.J. and Ruben

enter with Andy...  they look at the face on the computer

screen... (this is the only light in the room).

She hasn't looked at them or the computer... SHE ROCKS...

RUBEN (FROM A MISSPENT YOUTH IN VIDEO ARCADES) expertly

maneuvers the mouse and clicks on the icon as instructed.

NOW THE ANIMATED COLLAGE PLAYS BACKWARD!  IN TENTH OF A

SECOND STEPS WE SEE THE IMAGE OF THE RED-HEADED WOMAN MERGE

BACKWARD THROUGH THE DISTORTED IMAGES AND BECOME

THE DEAD WOMAN IN THE BATHTUB.

M.J. AND RUBEN REACTING, LIGHTED BY THE GLOW FROM THE SCREEN.

M.J. nods to him to get along... He calls on his cellular

phone while simultaneously working the computer...

THE COMPUTER SCREEN HAS A LEGEND ON IT:

NOW YOU SEE ME...

As they watch, it is replaced by:

NOW YOU DON'T...

AND THEN IT FADES TO BLACK...  Helen goes to the machine and

maneuvers with mouse and keyboard.

INT. POLICE HQ CORRIDOR - DAY

M.J., RUBEN, QUINN, MAYBE OTHERS OF HIS STAFF STRIDE

PURPOSEFULLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR, CAMERA MOVING WITH THEM...

For a moment we won't know who Quinn is talking about...

They pass through a door into a ROOM where the homicide team

sit waiting... M.J. goes right into a briefing...

EXT. MARINA HOUSE - LATE DAY

As she is speaking, her description becomes V.O. as we SEE

police cars and an ambulance drawn up IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

SHE IS DESCRIBING...

SUSAN SCHIFFER and her crew arrive, leaping out of their van

with their equipment, a makeup woman ADJUSTING SUSAN'S

MAKEUP AND HAIR RIGHT THERE IN THE STREET...

INT. MARINA HOUSE - DAY

M.J. and Ruben, Quinn, etc., trying to calm and/or question

the HUSBAND, who is in shock.  He is the man we saw bringing

drinks.

The husband's voice follows QUINN and others as another COP

leads them toward the back of house.

DOOR TO BEDROOM.  QUINN AND RUBEN have stopped just inside

door.  M.J. forced to peer around them.

M.J.'S POV: On the bed, the RED-HEADED WOMAN'S body is

propped up against the headboard, her knees up, her head

fallen onto a shoulder: her pajama top has been ripped open

and pushed up.  Knotted around her neck is a pink scarf tied

in a huge bow under her chin.  On her feet, secured between

her toes, is a commercial flyer advertising the Festival of

Love.  It is brightly printed with red hearts.  It has been

hand-lettered:

HELL IN THE FESTIVAL OF LOVE

CAMCORDER capturing the audience of a ROCK CONCERT in full

blast, in GOLDEN GATE PARK.  The audience, mostly young,

some in 70's costume, sit and loll around on blankets.  Most

seem to have some variety of refreshment... liquid or rolled.

The CAMERA records the unsteady progress of a lovely YOUNG

GIRL, weaving her way through the blankets and the bodies.

She suddenly becomes aware of the camera being aimed at her.

She stops, strikes a comically seductive pose and gives a

big, gorgeous smile.  FREEZE FRAME.

ANDY answers the door.  M.J. and Ruben...

HELEN APPEARS IN WHATEVER SHE SLEEPS IN.

Andy, who has ducked out, now reappears, dressed for a date.

He goes...

M.J. stands.  She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's

story.  There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice...

Three voices chime self-conscious 'Good-nights.'

EXT. HELEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

THE SILENT WATCHER'S POV through the eye of the

CAMCORDER, we catch M.J. exit HELEN'S building.  She stops

momentarily on the sidewalk to look up at Helen's window...

The drapes swing open.  RUBEN CAN BE SEEN DOING SOMETHING AT

THE WINDOWS... The Camcorder zooms to a close-up of M.J.

She gets into her car and speeds off.

INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ruben is checking the windows...

At the phrase 'motivated man', HELEN looks at him boldly in the

eye.

HELEN laughs.  So does RUBEN.  Her boldness, her

attracts him.  His honesty attracts HELEN.  He feels the

heat.

His grin says he'd select her anytime...

They smile ruefully at one another, and without further

conversation, leave the bedroom.

INT. HELEN'S FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

RUBEN is outside the door.  HELEN just inside.

She smiles, and RUBEN turns, walks away.  She stays in the

doorway watching his retreat.  About ten feet away, he

suddenly stops.

He turns around, she is still in the doorway.  He reaches

for his wallet, withdraws a card, holds it up to her.

He hods card out to her.  HELEN, holding onto the door

frame, doesn't move.  RUBEN continues to extend his hand

with the card in it.  It is a charged moment.  She is frozen

in the doorway; RUBEN refuses to make a move towards her.

HELEN summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame,

determined not to have any further mortification this night,

she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him.

Then a second step and a third.

Her hand touches the card, takes it.

She turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat.

What she sees is that the door's Sureclose device has

quietly and efficiently closed.  The door is locked.

Frantic, she turns back toward RUBEN.

HER POV:

RUBEN, now seems a vast distance away from her.  He is just

turning down the stairs and is gone... The hallway first

narrows, squeezing her in, then expands.  She is lost in the

miles and miles of space between the two walls.

RUBEN reappears, races toward her...

She starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but RUBEN

catches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like

a suspect.  He puts one hand on the back of her neck,

spreads her legs, gets her in frisk position.  Somehow, this

is comforting to her, but she is still in full-blown

panic...

He pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring

her against the feeling of free-fall.

He still has a hand on the back of her neck.  Suddenly, the

proximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck.  She

begins to hyperventilate.

RUBEN takes out his gun...

RUBEN shoots off the lock.  Then he picks HELEN up and

carries her back into her apartment.

INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

RUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw

up over her.  He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it

to her.  She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer

water, then watches her take the pills.  After which he

takes the bottle and pockets it.

RUBEN pulls a big chair up beside the sofa.  As her eyes

close, RUBEN comforts her.  TV features the antics of a

nervous little prairie dog family.  He looks back at HELEN.

CLOSE UP HELEN:

We hear a faint but impatient voice call:

INT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT

Dim light.  The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not

comfortably.  A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.

She is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks

older.  A chronic invalid.  By her side is a NASTY LITTLE

DOG, with ribbon bows in its fur.  Near the bed is a TV and

video, on which a movie's final credits are running.

THE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON

PETER enters.  Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.

Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near

his hairline.  AN OLD SCAR.  He goes straight to TV and puts

the tape on 'eject.'

He inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.'  Then he

approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a

lock of hair back from the forehead.

She ignores him, staring at the screen.  The NASTY LITTLE

DOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.

He leaves.  As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking

to her dog over the TV soundtrack.

HER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a

small, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen,

then through a door leading to the basement.  He locks the

basement door behind him.

THE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets

and computers.  As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a

small TV/video set attached to a wall.  On its screen,

freeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an

outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.

PETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over

something to turn the video back on.

The CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across.  It is

the YOUNG GIRL from the concert.  She is strapped onto a

table, her mouth taped shut.  A plastic bag covers her head,

but not tightly.  She is semiconscious.  She is being

asphyxiated by slow degrees.

PETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to

repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made

toward his wife.  He whispers:

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN

ALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of

glorious misty green hills, hand in hand.  The Camera moves

down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom

of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway.  A

few festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new

CRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a

number of unmarked cars.

RUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.

As he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH

THE SCENE TO FIND M.J.  M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S

stubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns

away.  Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.

NIKKO'S face is tight with anger.

He moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE

WOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE.  The plastic bag is

now tied tight around her neck.  She has been posed beneath

a sign that says "NO DUMPING".  The usual technicians,

photographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.

here?

M.J. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels

beside her... to Ruben...

He inspects the dead girl's fingernails.

Nikko appears, looming over her...

They ignore him.  M.J. stands...

Ruben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes

Ruben.  Everybody stops in astonishment.  M.J. steps between

them.  Ready to get physical herself; they settle...

Down below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival-

of-Lovers.

Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut.  M.J. gestures for

RUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow

her back to the cars.  As they move more slowly down the

hillside to their cars...

But she seems unhappy... to techs standing by:

Nikko is talking to Susan Schiff...

all we need...

She strides toward them...

M.J. looks at Nikko.  He should know better.  She's also

thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at

this point -- or not?

She's got Susan outside the tape...

She is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other

side.  Susan races for her silver Audi...

From outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm

clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.

M.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES.  SUSAN has a faster

car, but M.J. is a better driver.  Stomach dropping hills,

trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the

familiar San Francisco chase scenes.

the case!

M.J. takes another two-wheel corner.  In the rear view

mirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she

tries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.

Having lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.

RUBEN'S eye-brows lift.  She peels into the HQ parking lot

and jumps out.

RUBEN gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side...

RUBEN look after her, a smile of delight on his face.

INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

A ROOM IN THE BASEMENT OF THE POLICE HQ IS BEING SET UP TO

HOUSE A NEW TASK FORCE, WITH CATERER'S TABLE FOR TEMP

DESKS.  Bulletin boards with notices and pictures; telephone

techs are still installing phones, cops are learning

unfamiliar computer menus, etc.  M.J. IS EXAMINING HUGE

BLOWUPS OF ONLOOKERS AT CRIME SCENES PINNED UP ON A WALL,

WITH A MAGNIFYING LENS.

She walks away BECKONS, BECKONS, COME ON, WALK AFTER ME!  He

walks out of a door and they stand on the steps...

EXT. STEPS POLICE HQ - DAY

A couple of Cops, maybe male and female, are smoking there.

Quinn gives them a look that sends them scuttling inside,

flipping their butts into the shrubbery.  Quinn sighs and

digs out a cigarette.  The looks between them tell the story

of his trying to give it up and not being able to, etc.

She starts to go...

INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  SHAKING HANDS DUMP OUT PILLS.  FOUR.

SIX.  TWO, PUT BACK.  ONE MORE, PUT BACK.

HELEN: RAVAGED.  WATCHING HERSELF IN MIRROR AS SHE GULPS THE

REMAINING PILLS.

DOOR BELL RINGS O.S.

We HEAR muffled voices -- ANDY and M.J.  HELEN, as she

realizes Andy is letting M.J. in, goes to the bathroom door

and tries to slam and lock it: Andy beats her to it,

blocking with his foot in the door.

M.J. appears.  Taking in Helen's condition -- due to a wild

night with Ruben?  Helen moves from the bathroom down the

hall to her office, as...

dumped outdoors in an empty lot.

They've turned into the office.  Something is wrong...

HELEN has to laugh.  The laugh turns to a hacking cough.

Andy leaves.  Helen sits, and with the care of someone

handling a rattlesnake, turns the computer on.  Meanwhile...

THE PHONE RINGS.

HELEN hangs the phone to M.J.  The air is a little more

charged... Helen goes back to the computer.

M.J. delivers the message straight-faced.

INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is empty, the messy unmade bed has covers thrown

back.  Nasty Little Dog is sprawled asleep on it.  The TV is

on: SUSAN SCHIFFER'S broadcast... Over SUSAN'S shoulder, big

and bold, the legend:

'KOPYCAT KILLER?'

O.S.  A TOILET FLUSHES, and Peter's WIFE emerges wearing a

nightgown.  She shuffles back to the bed, and as she sits

picks up the remote...

She zaps the remote and a program hyping the Summer of Love

comes on...

INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

We see on HIS computer screen a picture of HELEN scanned

from some newspaper or magazine.  PETER is building a morph:

beside Helen on screen is another image -- of the RED-HEADED

woman.  He is placing marks on one picture, on the exact

corner of Helen's left eyes.  As he does so, a red dot

appears near the corner of the left eye of the Red-headed

woman.  Both pictures are dappled with similar dots.  It

looks very odd, as though someone had stuck Post-its all

over the images.  Around him, as he works are other pictures:

ASPHYXIATED GIRL taken while she was strapped to the table.

Of the sign "NO DUMPING."  M.J. leaving Helen's!  HE ALSO HAS

A TINY TV ON, AND TURNS TO SEE AS:

INT. DEATH ROW CELL - NIGHT

DARYLL LEE lies smoking and watching a tiny TV of his own.

INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

M.J. striding, tight-lipped through the room to her

workstation where she takes the phone from Ruben...

INTERCUT:

RUBEN HAS BEEN GIVEN NEWS: BIG PROBLEMS.  MEN AND WOMEN ARE

GETTING UP, PUTTING ON HOLSTERS, ETC., MOVING OUT...

INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

HELEN, her police scanner sounding distant tinny cries in

the night:  Helen holding the phone, digesting that...

EXT. HELEN'S STREET - NIGHT

A MAN parks a car.  He gets out.  He is dressed entirely in

black.  Glancing around to be sure he is not observed, the

MAN moves to cars, banging them hard with his hand until he

SETS OFF A CAR ALARM.  He trots silently to HELEN'S side of

the street and merges into the dark side of her building.

THE ALARM GOES INFURIATINGLY ON.  A light comes on in an

upstairs window...

INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

BURT, the cop on guard, marginally irritated by the car

alarm, looks up briefly, then returns to his magazine.

EXT. RICHMOND DISTRICT - NIGHT

CAR WHERE A WOMAN HAS BEEN SHOT DEAD.  KLIEG LIGHTS PAINT

HER FEATURES A BLEAK WHITE ON BLACK.  M.J. and RUBEN work

the scene along with the CRIME TECH CREW.

One of the TECH GUYS holds up a bullet.

CLOSE: M.J. is crawling along the floor, looking at

everything she can find -- gum wrappers, hobby pins, loose

change, etc.  She lifts her head and finds the car radio and

tape player right in her face.

M.J. has rubber gloves on.  She switches on ignition and the

tape player starts:  ABBA.  A phone rings...

ON RUBEN standing beside the car; he answers his phone...

M.J. still pissed at the earlier phone call, turns away,

dismissively...

Dread clouds HELEN'S face.  She is calling up databases,

screens scrolling across her computer monitor.

RUBEN look around, sees a gas station across the street and

further down the block...

RUBEN hands the phone over to M.J.

ON HELEN'S SCREEN IS THE FACE OF BERKOWITZ... SHE CALLS UP

ADDITIONAL FRAMES SHOWING SCENES OF HIS CRIMES.

M.J. reacts:  the scene of what Helen is saying hits her

hard.  This is repeating the pattern of yet another

killer...

The techie who pulled the bullet out of the door turns...

He pulls a baggie out his pocket and hands it to her...

RUBEN RUNNING across to the gas station.  He's alone now,

the blazing lights of the crime scene recede.

EXT. HELEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

A small annoyed crowd has gathered around the are whose

alarm is still shrieking.

INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

BURT finally gets up, goes to window, sees situation,

decides to go and fix it.

EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

M.J. still on phone to HELEN.  She's just got the bullet out

of the baggie; Tony stands watching.

EXT. SHELL STATION - NIGHT

Closed.  RUBEN at the phone booth.

A note lies on the shelf, handwritten in felt-tip pen.  He

puts on a rubber glove, picks note up by one corner.

CRIME SCENE:

RUBEN has taken phone back from M.J.  He is reading the note

to HELEN.  M.J., agitated, stands by.

M.J. notices that there is writing on the other side of the

note.  She forces RUBEN'S gloved hand to turn note over.

By this time M.J. has seen that this part is addressed to

sound casual.

She hangs up, RUBEN is already on his way.  M.J. calls a

number...

EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The beeper on Burt's belt is beeping, but his head is under

the hood of the car where the car alarm is blaring.  He

can't hear the beeper...

BACK TO CRIME SCENE:

M.J. ends the call, yells to another Detective.

SHE TURNS AND SEES:

BEHIND YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE THE NIGHT IS FULL OF THRILL

SEEKERS AND CURIOUS.  WHICH OF THEM MIGHT BE THE KILLER?

THE GUY IN THE BACK OF THE CROWD WHO FOR NO APPARENT REASON

SUDDENLY BEGINS TO RACE ALONG BEHIND THE ONLOOKERS?  THE MEN

WHO DUCKS TO TIE HIS SHOE WHEN A PHOTOGRAPHER SHOOTS A

INT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The horn blares across the street, (O.S.).  No one notices

the MAN at HELEN'S door, swiftly fiddling the lock with a

ring full of burglars' keys and picks.

INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

HELEN is putting on makeup (Ruben is coming).  A small but

alarming noise at the front of the loft.  She listens

carefully, and moves to the door looking down the hall

toward the front door.  It is OPEN"  Burt is not there!

She hesitates a moment, then turns off the lights and

sprints for the front door, to escape.

THE MAN IS PULLING A BALACLAVA UP OVER HIS FACE.  AS HE HEARS

HER HE STEPS TO THE...

HELEN RUNS DOWN THE HALL AND REACHES THE FRONT DOOR.  SHE

RUNS RIGHT OUT INTO THE HALL A FEW STEPS BEFORE RECOILING:

HER POV.  THE WALLS AND FLOOR WEAVING AND CONTRACTING...

AGORAPHOBIA HAS HIT.

HELEN FALLS.  SHE SCRAMBLES IN TERROR BACK TO THE "SAFETY"

OF HER WALL, NOW A CAVE OF DARKNESS.

SHE FALLS ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL, GASPING FOR BREATH.

LIVING ROOM.  THE MAN MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM TOWARD THE

HALL.

RUBEN:  taking the hills fast.

THE MAN: STEPS OUT INTO THE HALL.

HELEN:  SHE HAS RUN BACK THE LENGTH OF THE HALL TO HER

OFFICE.  SHE IS JUST VANISHING AS THE MAN STEPS TO WHERE HE

CAN SEE HER.

THE MAN STARTS TO FOLLOW, NOT FAST, BUT WITH TERRIFYING

SURENESS...

THE POLICE SCANNER SUDDENLY COMES UP LOUD.  HE HESITATES.

HELEN:  HER REMOTE CONTROLS IN HAND SWITCHES ON TV SETS,

LAMPS, ETC.

THE MAN:  HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN, TOWARD WHERE HE BELIEVES

SHE IS.  HE IS PASSING A WINDOW, WHEN THE CURTAINS SUDDENLY

DRAW, RIGHT BESIDE HIM.  HE PAUSES AGAIN, LOOKS DOWN AND WE

AND HE/WE SEE THE STREET SCENE: BURT AND NEIGHBORS TRYING TO

SILENCE THE CAR ALARM.  THEN HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN.

THE CURTAINS CLOSE.

HIGH ANGLE OVER THE MAZE OF THE APARTMENT WALLS.  WE CAN SEE

THE MAN MOVING ALONG THE HALLWAY AGAIN -- TOWARD ANDY'S DEN,

AND DIRECTLY TOWARD WHERE WE LAST SAW HELEN.

SUDDENLY, FOREGROUND, HELEN'S HEAD POPS UP, HUGE!  SHE IS

WRESTLING HERSELF UP OVER THE WALL TOWARD CAMERA, INTO

ANOTHER ROOM OUT OF HIS PATH.  WE PAN WITH HER AS SHE WIGGLES

HERSELF OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND UNTIL SHE FALLS INTO

FURNITURE, MAKING A HUGE NOISE.

MAN STOPS, TRYING TO LOCATE DIRECTION.  HE DECIDES.  LEAPS

WITH CATLIKE GRACE ONTO A PIECE OF FURNITURE AND FROM THERE

ONTO THE TOP OF THE WALL!

NOW HE STANDS ON THE PARTITION, LOOKING AROUND AT THE

GROUNDPLAN (AS IT WERE) OF THIS APARTMENT MAZE FROM A HIGH

ANGLE POV.

HELEN:  SHE CROUCHES IN HIDING.  IN DEEP FOCUS, BEYOND HER,

AND HIGH ABOVE HER, WE SEE THE MAN SILHOUETTED AS HE BEGINS

TO WALK ALONG LIKE A CAT ON A GARDEN WALL, ABLE TO SEE ON

BOTH SIDES INTO WHATEVER ROOMS HE IS PASSING.

HE DROPS OFF THE WALL FOR A MOMENT INTO HER BEDROOM.

INTERCUT MAN AND HELEN.  HE LOOKS FOR HER, PRODS THE BED

COVERS.

THEN LEAPS BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE WALL.

SHE TAKES A VASE AND THROWS IT OVER THE WALL INTO THE

ADJACENT ROOM.  THE MAN'S FIGURE DOESN'T EVEN SLOW, HE'S

ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT:  HE LEAPS CLEAR ACROSS AN OPENING

ONTO THE WALL THAT LEADS DIRECTLY TO HER.

SHE HITS THE REMOTE:  THE CURTAINS SWEEP OPEN, AND MORE LIGHT

COMES IN NOW FROM THE STREET.

CLOSE, THE MAN: HIS FACE TURNS TO THE LIGHT: FROM THIS HIGH

ANGLE WE AND WE SEE DOWN INTO THE STREET, WHERE

RUBEN'S CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP.  RUBEN charges into the

building.

BURT, COMING AWAKE, FOLLOWS RUBEN up the stairs three at a

time.

HALLWAY AND APARTMENT DOOR:  THE MAN COMES RACING OUT AND

TURNS TOWARD THE STAIRS, JUST AS RUBEN REACHES HELEN'S

FLOOR.  THE MAN TRIES TO DO A 180, BUT RUBEN THROWS A BODY

BLOCK AND THE MAN FALLS BACK INSIDE THE APARTMENT.

LIGHT FROM HALL GIVES US OUR FIRST LOOK AS RUBEN TEARS THE

BALACLAVA OFF HIS FACE.  He is a middle-aged Afro-Asian with

a knife-scarred face.

Then he sees her.  In shock, she stares down at the MAN.

She shakes her head, turns and runs out of the room, as

RUBEN catches sight of BURT.

BURT rushes to okay.  RUBEN FRISKS THE MAN.

The improbability of this name makes RUBEN deliver an angry

kick to the man's side.

Ruben shoves Conrad into Backup Cop's hands.

INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ruben comes running in, sees a parcel lying on pillow...

scoops it up, and rips it open.  It's a book.  He returns

to Conrad, who is now surrounded by police.  Ruben holds the

book up like a question.

INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

HELEN is sitting on the floor, her knees pulled up to her

chest.

She sits there, says nothing.

She starts to laugh.  The sound is awful.  After a moment,

she gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door.  RUBEN takes

her to the sink, sort of sits her down on it.  Wets a

washcloth, goes to sponge off her face.  She is trembling.

Without warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak-out,

she breaks away from him, ricochets through bedroom, down

the hallway, RUBEN follows, tries to put his arms around

her.

He pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight

around her, holding her still.  He smoothes her hair, rubs

her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.

She breaks free and whacks him across his nose.

There is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that

RUBEN kisses her.  She goes limp, kisses him back, then

she's suddenly sobbing.  His nose is bleeding, but she's

smiling.  Something between them has finally connected.

Been agreed upon.

He digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it.

He goes.

A SONG BEGINS, PRELAPPING THE FOLLOWING SCENES:  "MURDER BY

NUMBERS" BY THE POLICE...

HELEN OPENS THE WEAPON, SEEMINGLY COMPETENT ENOUGH TO HANDLE

IT WELL, AND EMPTIES OUT THE BULLETS.  SHE LOCKS IT UP AND

HEAVES A SIGH OF RELIEF.

THE SONG CONTINUES...

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

THE FBI ARRIVES.  High angle, looking down: three identical

cars draw in front, park with military precision: all four

doors on the all three cars open at the same time and

identically dressed men, in suits, get out, slam the doors

in sync., and march toward the front steps to HQ, ignoring a

couple of bemused cops smoking on the sidewalk...

INT. POLICE HQ - CONTINUOUS

As the parade of FBI, led by their Commander SAKS, walk down

the corridor from the front door, toward CAMERA, performing

a smart right angle turn, and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW)

continue away from CAMERA down another corridor.  Through

the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who

pretend they aren't looking at them: no eye contact between

cops and FBI.  The cops are at ease; bellies slop over

belts; neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts; sweat

stains; shirtsleeves.  The marching men wouldn't sweat.

QUINN emerges from his office and sees them arriving.  He

gets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door, signals

a few top officers to follow.  He looks resigned...

INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)

M.J., RUBEN, NIKKO, and a number of other officers are being

addressed by SAKS, an FBI agent.  At the back are three more

FBI AGENTS, suited and tied.  QUINN stands off to one side.

THE SONG IS JUST ENDING, ON A CD PLAYER IN THE ROOM.  A

projector beams up a copy of the note RUBEN found in the

phone booth.

SAKS speaks...

SAKS approaches M.J., guides her away from the others.

TWO SHOT:  Saks is unctuous and insincere, self-confident.

QUINN joins them, SAKS gives him a nod.

M.J.'S look makes SAKS smile.  QUINN is called to the phone.

So much for any trusting relationship, right?  QUINN has

arrived, addresses SAKS.

He turns to M.J.  Diplomatically, SAKS moves away.

She turns and leaves, brushing past Saks as she goes... Gigi

meets her...

It takes a moment to remember what it was...

If there was any residual doubt about what's happening, it's

gone now.  She starts after Quinn, sees he is in spirited

dialogue with SAKS and decides to wait.

INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

HELEN and M.J.  Helen unfolds a xerox copy of the note, that

M.J. has just given her.

FLASHBACK: PETER'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

An incremental flash of a SMALL BOY standing by his bed

which he has wet.  His pajamas are soaked.  His powerful

MOTHER grabs him by the hair and drags him with her.

The SMALL BOY is flung into an under-stairs closet where

firewood and stacked papers are kept.  The door is slammed

hard.  He gropes around in the darkness, finds a big box of

matches, lights one.  Then, angrily, he sets fire to a pile

of newspapers.  They start to burn.  We see, but do not,

hear, his screams for help.

INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

She picks out the lines... "then you must try a twosome or a

threesome."

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

PETER in his car.  Ahead, he see TWO GIRLS at a bus stop.

We see PETER take a long bladed-knife and carefully conceal

it under his right thigh.  The TWO GIRLS are wearing

backpacks.  'FESTIVAL OF LOVE' stickers decorate the bags.

PETER pulls his nondescript sedan up to them and says

something.  They giggle, shake their heads.  He laughs,

holds up his hands to level of his shoulders in a '

M.J. doesn't look at the Rivkind list, just crosses his name

off the killer list and picks up the phone, dials, waits.

His eyebrows arch, but his smile stays in place.

He gets up and walks toward the door.

ONE EYE ONLY UNTIL THE EYE, THE IRIS AND FINALLY THE PUPIL

FILL THE SCREEN:  IN THEM IS REFLECTED THOSE NAMES POURING

PAST IN THEIR THOUSANDS, UNTIL WE HEAR A GASP.  A KEYSTROKE

OFFSTAGE, AND THE NAMES STOP: ANOTHER KEYSTROKE AND ONE NAME

AMONG THEM ALL SUDDENLY FREEZES IN HER PUPIL:

M.J. is turning into the Office; she carries a portfolio of

lists of her own.

INT. SAN QUENTIN WARDENS' OFFICE

INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

HELEN, M.J.  They are waiting, Helen tense, smoking,

atmosphere charged...

Like she really wished they might, so she could have one.

Helen looks at her cigarette as though she'd never seen one

before... grinds it out...

And unconsciously lights another during following...

PHONE RINGS.  M.J. PICKS IT UP, LISTENS, HANDS IT TO HELEN...

Gestures encouragement; fist in victory gesture...

INT.  PENITENTIARY INTERVIEW ROOM

DARYLL LEE CULLUM is on the phone, a Warden is attendance,

but not on the phone line.  On this rare contact with the

outside world HE IS MANIC...

She turns on speakerphone.

Helen looks at M.J., who indicates 'tell you later.'

bein' joined and he's gonna

At this mention of Conrad, M.J. leaps to another phone...

Helen hangs up.  M.J. has already left...

INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

Pandemonium: the Chinatown raid has been carried off and

NIKKO AND RUBEN and a dozen other cops are booking a group

of Chinese gangsters of all ages, and a group of frightened

and confused Chinese illegal aliens.  TOTAL UPROAR.

THROUGH IT, WE MOVE WITH M.J.  SHE PASSES RUBEN WHO IS

GRABBING A CHINESE KID STRUNG OUT ON SOMETHING, OUT OF A

LINE OF SUSPECTS... HE ASIDES:

He manhandles the KID INTO DOCILITY WHILE...

SHE MOVES ON TO FIND NIKKO

NIKKO sites at his desk, processing the papers for the sullen

YOUNG THUG who is handcuffed to a chain next to NIKKO'S

desk.  Nikko  unholsters his gun... he shoves it into his

desk drawer...

QUINN, walking past the ILLEGALS, speaks to GIGI.

M.J. STANDS OVER NIKKO

HARROWING SCREAM!!!  ILLEGAL WOMAN IS SCREAMING --

PANDEMONIUM AMONG THE DETAINEES.  COPS RUSH TO CONTROL THE

PROBLEM.

Just at that moment the kid Ruben was booking goes totally

bananas; M.J. goes to his assistance, wrestling this wild

kid.

NIKKO starts from his chair, looking for the key to the

drawer, but is isn't there... he goes to help Ruben get the

kid under control.  Quinn steps in...

THEY MOVE BACK TO NIKKO'S DESK.

go.

NIKKO has stood and moved the handcuffed THUG toward the

door to jail cells.  M.J. checks her time, (WALL CLOCKS HELP

US HERE:  8:47)

M.J. goes... RUBEN can't find a desk to work at, and

commandeers Nikko's.  He slams the KID into NIKKO'S chair

and cuffs him.  KID starts to rattle his chairs, spew

Chinese epithets, then bends over the desk and, with his

teeth picks up some paper, tries to shake it to shreds.

RUBEN yanks the papers out of the KID'S mouth, pulls the

KID'S chair from the side to the front of the desk, shoves

the KID into place facing away from the desk, so that he

can't do any more damage.  Then RUBEN can't figure out where

he can work.  At the next desk, where he has been working,

MAC rises.

He moves off, the KID'S eyes move calculatingly around the

room.  He twists against the cuffs, trying anything to get

free, and discovers he can pull out the desk drawer.

CLOSE UP:  The KID'S FREE HAND rifling through the drawer

behind his back, finding the gun.  PULL BACK to show the

KID.  He is as Ruben positioned him, his back pressed

against the desk.

INT. CITY JAIL CELL - DAY

CONRAD is brought in by a Guard.  Lightly shacked.  M.J.

stands.  Conrad sits.

She slaps him hard!  He is shocked.

She's walking to the door... Conrad holds out just one more

beat to see if she's bluffing... her hand is on the door

knob...

M.J. starts to open the door...

M.J. is already on her way...

EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

DESERTED.  A LONG SHADOW OF A MAN STRETCHES OUT ACROSS THE

DOCK.  IT IS PETER, WALKING LEISURELY FROM THE WATERFRONT

DRIVE TOWARD THE HUGE WATERHOUSE AT THE END OF THE DOCK.  HE

STEPS INTO THE DEEP SHADOWS AND SEEMS TO VANISH.

CLOSE:  PETER.  HE CHECKS HIS WATCH AND TURNS TO WATCH THE

DOCK AND THE SHORE.  HE CAN SEE AND NOT BE SEEN.  HE IS

ENTIRELY ALONE NOW.

INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

RUBEN takes coffee and doughnuts out of a box, then leans

over the KID who seems to have calmed down.  He uncuffs him

from the chair.

He pushes the coffee toward the Kid, who WHIPS NIKKO'S GUN

OUT FROM UNDER THE DESK, where it was hidden, and lays it up

under Ruben's ear.  KID moves behind RUBEN and puts a skinny

arm around RUBEN'S neck, pulling him upright.  RUBEN still

clutching the doughnut box.  It takes a moment for the

others to SEE.  Then the room is absolutely motionless.

A CHINESE DETECTIVE REPEATS THE SAME IDEA IN CHINESE...

Behind the KID, as he backs through the door, across the

corridor we LOOK STRAIGHT DOWN A CORRIDOR TO WHERE M.J. IS

COMING ALMOST AT A RUN -- SHE SEES what is happening.

The KID doesn't see her, yet, as he is backing away from the

others... M.J. DRAWS HER GUN AND STANDS IN FIRING POSITION.

IF SHE FIRES FROM HERE RUBEN IS DIRECTLY BEHIND THE KID, AND

OTHER OFFICERS, IN THE LINE THE BULLET WOULD TAKE ARE STILL

SCRAMBLING OUT OF HER LINE... SHE CAN'T FIRE.

The KID turns, sees her, exposing his shoulder to her... SHE

FIRES AND HITS THE KID.

HE IS THROWN TO THE FLOOR AND TWISTED AROUND BY THE IMPACT,

LANDING BEHIND RUBEN SO SHE CAN'T MAKE A SECOND SHOT.

RUBEN GOES FOR HIS OWN GUN, BUT THE KID'S GUN THAT FELL FROM

HIS HAND IS RIGHT BY HIM STILL.  THE KID GRABS IT AND FIRES

BEFORE RUBEN HAS HIS GUN ALL THE WAY OUT OF HIS HOLSTER.  THE

KID SHOOTS RUBEN IN THE THROAT AT AN ANGLE THAT TAKES THE

BULLET STRAIGHT INTO HIS BRAIN.

THEN THE KID THROWS THE GUN AWAY, AND STANDS, HIS HANDS UP

IN SURRENDER, A GRIN ON HIS FACE.  THIS ENTIRE ACTION HAS

TAKEN ABOUT SIX SECONDS.  THE KID GOES DOWN, FLATTENED BY

BODIES OF THE COPS WHO HAVE RUSHED HIM.

M.J. RUSHES TO RUBEN.

EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

PETER, STANDING AS BEFORE.  CHECKS HIS WATCH, LIGHTS A

CIGARETTE.

INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

The KID has been taken away.  PARAMEDICS are removing

RUBEN'S body.  M.J. stands frozen as RUBEN'S stretcher is

carried out of the room.  Her hand holds the doughnut box.

Finally, M.J. blinks, her head turns as if she can't imagine

what to do, where to go.  Then, suddenly conscious of the

doughnut box, she clutches it tight against her chest.

CLOSE:  M.J.

She abruptly remembers: the rendezvous with Peter Kurten!

EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

WIDE FULL SHOT:  DEEP SHADOWS AND HIGHLIGHTS.  IN THE BLACK

CAVERN OF THE DOCK, FOOTSTEPS BEGIN TO ECHO, THEN OUT OF

SHADOW INTO LIGHT COMES

PETER.  HE WALKS AWAY INTO THE NIGHT.  FAR FAR AWAY SIRENS

BEGIN TO SOUND -- THEY'LL BE TOO LATE.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT

NIKKO sits, numb.  If possible, NIKKO is more devastated than

M.J.  She speaks to NIKKO, but does not look at him.

M.J. looks away.

QUINN enters to find his two senior officers in tears.  Pays

no attention to Conrad.

Nikko stands, and he and Quinn exit.  M.J. SITS STARING INTO

HER MISERY.

INT. GAY NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Very crowded with a generally young clientele.  Big dance

scene.  A number of men wear 70's costume... an occasional

bit of drag.

ANDY and HAL dancing... ANDY with great abandon.  HAL seems

to need a break.  He leads a good-naturedly protesting ANDY

back to their table.  They find a stranger sitting there.

IT IS PETER.

INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

M.J. ENTERS AND CROSSES TO HIS DESK.

On his desk lie a badge and a gun -- Nikko's.  M.J. is

looking at them as

M.J. pulls her badge out and puts it down in front of Quinn.

INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Helen is lying wide awake.  THE PHONE RINGS.  HER ANSWERING

MACHINE -- SHE CAN HEAR IT CLEARLY IN THIS LOFT APARTMENT...

"THE POLICE" SINGING "YMCA" IS HEARD!

INT. NIGHTCLUB PAYPHONE NEAR THE  MEN'S ROOM

PETER IS THERE ON A PAYPHONE:  HE NOW HOLDS UP A WALKMAN

TAPE RECORDER TO THE MOUTHPIECE... PRESSES A BUTTON...

INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM

HELEN'S OWN VOICE IS HEARD.  ECHOING THROUGH THE LOFT SPACE

FROM THE OFFICE.  "YMCA" HEARD IN B.G.  Helen leaps out of

bed and runs down the hall, as:

Dahmer killed his first victim

She has reached the machine: she picks up the phone...

INT. CLUB PAYPHONE - NIGHT

PETER HANGS UP THE PHONE, SLIPS THE TAPE RECORDER IN HIS

POCKET AND TAKES A FEW STEPS TO THE MAIN FLOOR OF THE

NIGHTCLUB.  OVER HIS SHOULDER WE CAN SEE: ANDY AND HAL

DANCING.  Andy is wearing a bright and distinctive jacket.

INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A new guard, FRED, is letting M.J. in.  FOR THE FIRST TIME,

HELEN IS GLAD TO SEE HER.  As M.J. walks down toward her...

She is too full of her own shock to wonder why M.J. is here

at this hour and to notice the state M.J. is in... she has

turned back to the answering machine and hits the play

button, M.J. standing beside her... She also has the text of

the lecture on her computer screen:

AND THE MUSIC FROM THE NIGHTCLUB BLARING IN THE B.G.

Helen has turned and now sees M.J.'s condition.  SHE STOPS

THE TAPE...

Tears start again, just running down, no sobs, but she can't

will them away.  She brushes at them angrily...

Helen has stepped to her brandy decanter; M.J., too dejected

to move, sits, staring now at the only thing to stare at: the

computer screen.

Helen returns with the brandy.  M.J. holds it, doesn't drink,

just stares at the computer screen, emotionally dead...

With an effort of will M.J. moves to the phone, putting the

brandy down.

EXT. BAYSIDE RESTAURANT - BELVEDERE OR SAUSALITO - DAY

A BRIGHT LOVELY DAY, PEOPLE DINING AND DRINKING IN THE SUN,

on a deck that faces the Bay and San Francisco's towers

beyond.  Young people, drinks in hand, dressed to go to a

summer wedding, mingle and laugh and chatter.  A young woman

stands leaning back against the wooden rail, her back to the

Baby.  A young man faces her, talking, laughing.  HE LEANS

CLOSE TO WHISPER IN HER EAR AND SHE LEANS BACK, DRAWING HIM

CLOSER TO HER -- SEXY!  AS HE WHISPERS HE CAN SEE OVER HER

SHOULDER INTO THE WATER BELOW.

REVERSE, CLOSE: YOUNG MAN -- His face registering horror at

what he sees: he stops speaking, and the GIRL turns to look

down to see what is it he's looking at, and begins to

SCREAM...

THEIR POV.

Below, floating in the water is ANDY, wearing his bright

jacket, except it's not all of Andy.  HIS HEAD IS MISSING.

REVERSE: (TIME HAS PASSED).  FROM WHAT WOULD BE ANDY'S POV

-- FACES LOOKING DOWN.  M.J., QUINN, SAKS AND CORONER'S

MEN...

THEIR POV.  NOW RUBBER BOATS HAVE BEEN TIED IN A RING

AROUND THE BODY.  DOC IS DOING HIS WORK, PREPARATORY TO

LIFTING THE BODY OUT OF THE WATER...

HE PULLS A WALLET OUT OF THE POCKET AND HOLDS IT UP TO THE

PEOPLE ABOVE.

M.J. TAKES IT.  BEGINS TO LOOK THROUGH IT.  SHE IS NUMB WITH

EXHAUSTION AND SORROW.

INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Her teeth chattering, HELEN tries to talk.

M.J. hands HELEN her bottle of Xanax.

Offers the Xanax again.  Helen looks at the bottle...

M.J. starts for the door... Helen has turned to her

computer and types... meanwhile we are HEARING.

And we SEE Helen's message on the computer screen...

PETER KURTEN, PLEASE CONTACT INTERNET HUDSONHEL@UNIVOLD.COM.

INT. TASK FORCE - DAY

M.J. IS MOVING FROM DESK TO DESK... ISSUING INSTRUCTIONS, in

continuous segue from above...

To the next...

Next station.  QUINN has appeared and is listening.

SAKS has appeared and stands by Quinn: they both stare at

her and she becomes more and more self conscious and aware

of how impossible this is...

M.J. is mildly surprised at help from this source.

QUINN AND SAKS TURN TO EACH OTHER: TURF WAR.

FERTILITY CLINIC - DAY

NITROGEN FOG swirls as a Stainless steel tubule is lifted

out its bath of liquid nitrogen, with a long pair of tongs.

CAMERA FOLLOWS TO REVEAL PETER FOLEY, in white lab coat.

Through a glass partition, he SEES two unmistakable FBI men

enter and begin talking to the receptionist in an outside

office.  HE CONTINUES ABOUT HIS WORK.  CAMERA STAYS ON THE

FBI MEN AND RECEPTIONIST.  CUT BACK TO WHERE PETER WAS

WORKING.  THERE IS ONLY A PAIR OF RUBBER GLOVES AND LAB COAT

LYING ON THE WORK SPACE.  A BACK DOOR IS CLOSING...

INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM

HELEN'S BED IS EMPTY, COVERS THROWN BACK.  A GLORIOUS

moving toward her, but quietly, cautiously.  As the

footsteps turn into the hall.  She stands, reaching for

anything to defend herself with: a paperknife.  She moves to

turns into the office, and she launches herself, only

stopping the stab of the knife at the last split second...

TO CONCEAL THE OPERATION.  QUINN in command over a SWAT

COMMANDER -- JENSEN.  There are ambulances, a fire truck,

search lights.  SWAT TEAM, AND FBI all wear bulky flack

jackets, with yellow ID stencilled on the back.  Quinn sees

M.J., huddled in her old oversize jacket, gestures M.J.

should have a flack jacket like theirs.  She taps her chest,

BROUGHT UP INTO A WIDER VIEW IT HAS A LONG BARREL WHICH

SUDDENLY SHOOTS FLAME: A PROPANE BARBECUE LIGHTER...

EXT. HOUSE

THEY ARE ALMOST READY FOR THE FIRST MOVE; THREE SWAT MEN BY

THE DOOR.  ANOTHER TWO PREPARING TO MOVE FORWARD AND

ANNOUNCE THEMSELVES.

INSIDE A SMOKE ALARM BEGINS TO GO.  LIGHT FLICKERS IN CELLAR

WINDOWS.

SWAT MEN AT THE DOOR: THEY SMASH THE LOCK AND CHARGE IN.  M.J.

AND OTHER DETECTIVES WITH THEM.

INT. HOUSE

A dozen men pour into the house from front and back,

converging in the dimly lit living room.  SMOKE OBSCURES

EVERYTHING.  The dining room and kitchen are empty.  M.J.

FOLLOWS CONTINGENT THAT RACES UPSTAIRS.  OTHERS FAN OUT

THROUGH THE WHOLE STRUCTURE.  FIREMEN COME BEHIND LOOKING

FOR THE FIRE.

INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

SMOKE IS THINNER HERE.  The room lighted only by the

glowing TV screen.  The WIFE still in bed, shot through the

head.  Others crowd in, kicking in closet and bathroom

doors.  M.J. IS BY THE  BED JUST TURNING TO START ABACK

DOWNSTAIRS LOOKING FOR PETER.

SWAT MAN emerges from the bathroom with the body of NASTY

LITTLE DOG, holding it by the tail:

AS THEY CHARGE THROUGH DOWNSTAIRS...

M.J. CAN SEE TWO FIREMEN AT THE BASEMENT DOOR.  SMOKE BILLOWS

FROM UNDER IT.  BEHIND IT WE HEAR SCREAMING.  THE FIREMEN

SMASH THE DOOR, DROPPING TO THE FLOOR AS THEY DO...

M.J'S POV: BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS OUT ACROSS THE CEILING

THEN EXPLODES INTO WHITE HOT FLAME.  SHE HAS STEPPED FORWARD

SO SHE CAN SEE OVER THE FIREMEN DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT: IN

THE SUDDEN FLARE SHE SEES A MAN, WITH TIN-RIMMED GLASSES AND

BLACK LEATHER CLOTHING ENTIRELY ENGULFED IN FLAME RUNNING UP

THE BASEMENT STAIRS; BEHIND HIM THE BASEMENT IS BURNING.

AND THE FIREMEN'S APPALLED FACES.  THE SCREAMING DIES OFF...

FLAME NOW ENGULFING THE BASEMENT AND GROUND FLOOR: FIREMEN

AND M.J. RACING OUT COUGHING AND CHOKING.

THEN: A HUGE HOT FLOOM OF AN EXPLOSION: FLAMES THREATEN TO

CONSUME THE ENTIRE HOUSE.  FIREMEN SWARM BACK TO KNOCK DOWN

FLAME FROM OUTSIDE.

M.J., QUINN, ETC., WATCHING THE EVIDENCE GO UP IN SMOKE.

THEIR FACES LIGHTED BY THE FLAME.

INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

She has now changed into a pair of sweat pants and a

T-shirt.  SUSAN SCHIFFER IS ON TV: WITH SHOTS OF THE FIRE

BEING SNUFFED OUT.

During the following we move to PETER'S HOUSE where Quinn

and Saks are being interviewed.

END OF HELEN STARING STONILY AT THE SCREEN:  SHE DOESN'T

BELIEVE IT FOR A MOMENT.

INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

M.J., wearily enters.  Others quietly entering, slipping out

coats, talking and drinking at some distance.  M.J. takes

off her shoulder holster and gun and puts them down on her

workspace.  NIKKO is at little distance cleaning out his

desk.  He comes down to her as she sits...

He is standing behind her and leans over to almost touch her

hair with his lips...

He goes.  M.J. twists in misery and fury... Her phone is

ringing on another line; she punches it...

INT. M.J'S CAR - NIGHT

M.J. is now almost dead with fatigue.  She barely misses

hitting another car.  She drives on until she is forced to

stop at a traffic light.  All during this:

M.J. switches stations, channel surfing... bits of music,

Rush Limbaugh, back to Ron droning on.

M.J. turns off the radio... when light turns green,

instead of moving ahead, she just sits for a moment.  Then,

furious with HELEN, with

the car into a tight illegal u-turn.

EXT. NIGHT BERKELEY CAMPUS - NIGHT

It is extra time, which means party time or those who've

finished and solitary and group study time for the rest.

And there are celebrants of the Festival of Love, who were

being born about the time of the original event.  TRACKING

SHOT TO ESTABLISH THIS SCENE, MOVING, SEARCHING ALONG THE

AVENUES, PASSING KNOTS OF STUDENTS AND PARTY-GOES... WE

HAVE SEEN A PEACEFUL CAMPUS, QUIETLY CELEBRATING.  AND WE

HAVE DRAWN UP BEFORE CHI OMEGA.  THERE IS NO PLACE TO PARK.

M.J., WHOSE POV THIS HAS BEEN LOOKS AT HER WATCH.

DECIDES: FUCK IT, THIS IS CRAZY AND IS ABOUT TO DRIVE AWAY,

SHIFTING INTO GEAR WHEN SHE SPOTS:

POV.  A GOLD COLORED VW BUG

It is parked under a tree some distance across a parking lot

jammed with student cars.  It is partly in shadow, so she

could easily have missed it.  She jumps out of the car and

moves fast up the steps through students, drinking, kissing,

studying, arguing...

INT. CHI OMEGA - NIGHT

MAIN MEETING ROOM.  Full of people milling about.  Music is

playing.  SEES THE BACK OF A TALL MAN ON CRUTCHES TALKING TO

A COED.  HE HAS A LOAD OF BOOKS SHE TAKES FROM HIM; SHE IS

LAUGHING.  M.J. moving fast toward them, she runs into a

girl, spilling the girls' drink on her blouse...

As M.J. continues to move the Girl grabs her...

M.J. holds up the badge...

She jerks away, almost knocking the Girl down.  The Girl is

yelling, beginning to attract attention.  As M.J. turns back

to SEE.

PETER AND THE COED are just moving off, the Coed holding his

books, he hobbling on the crutches.  M.J. runs through the

crowd toward him, and those who notice are pissed... she is

getting close when, just as he and the coed would pass from

sight behind a wall, PETER looks around, straight at M.J..

IT ISN'T PETER AT ALL.

M.J. LOOKING AROUND, MOVES TO STAIRS TO SECOND FLOOR...

M.J. EMERGING FROM STAIRS INTO THE CORRIDOR -- SHE RUNS DOWN

THIS CORRIDOR OF ROOMS, PUSHING OPEN ANY THAT ARE SHUT.

A SCARED COUPLE MAKING LOVE CONFRONT HER GUN.  SHE

REHOLSTERS IT AND RACES DOWN THE HALLWAY...

OVER THE PARTY NOISE AND MUSIC WE HEAR A SCREAM.  M.J. RACES

DOWN CORRIDORS, TRYING TO FIND THE SOURCE.  ANOTHER SCREAM.

IT SEEMS TO COME FROM BEHIND A CLOSED DOOR.  M.J. KICKS IT

OPEN, BURSTING IN:

INT. ROOM

A BUNCH OF STONED STUDENTS PASSING A JOINT: ON A TV PLAYER

IS THE IMAGE OF JAMIE LEE CURTIS IN AN EARLY SHOCKER: THEY

ARE PLAYING AT WHO CAN OUT-SCREAM JAMIE LEE CURTIS.

WHEN JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAMS --

THEY ALL SCREAM BACK!  AND BURST INTO HOWLS OF LAUGHTER.  THE

SIGHT OF M.J. WITH HER GUN OUT ONLY MAKES THEM HOWL LOUDER.

THEN ALTOGETHER THEY SCREAM AT HER!  AND HOWL WITH LAUGHTER.

THE HALL.

M.J. walks out of the room and down the corridor.

EXT. CHI OMEGA FRONT STEPS

SHE LOOKS OUT ACROSS THE PARKING LOT: THE GOLD VW BUG IS

GONE.

SHE WALKS TO HER CAR, RELIEVED.  THE WHOLE THING SEEMS LIKE

A NIGHTMARE FROM WHICH SHE HAS NOW AWAKENED.

INT. M.J'S CAR

AS SHE OPENS THE DOOR, REACHES IN AND GRABS HER PHONE.  SHE

ACTIVATES PHONE, WHEN SHE IS BLINDSIDED BY PETER WHO SLAMS

HER INTO THE CAR, FACE DOWN ACROSS THE FRONT SEAT.  HE

DISARMS HER, TWISTS HER INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT...

THERE ARE STUDENTS AT SOME DISTANCE, BUT SHE CAN'T MAKE

HERSELF BE HEARD.  SHE IS GROGGY FROM THE BLOW SHE'S TAKEN.

HE HANDCUFFS HER TO THE CAR, FIND HER KEYS, AND BEGINS TO

DRIVE AWAY... PETER'S HAIR IS NOW BRIGHT RED -- LIKE DARYLL

LEE CULLUM'S.

INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Helen lies wide awake in the dark.  PHONE RINGS.

INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

INSERT: TAPE RECORDER ATTACHED TO PHONE.  IT STARTS TO TURN.

AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM AN FBI DETECTIVE IS POURING HIMSELF

SOME COFFEE.  HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WE HEAR:

HELEN ON PHONE

thought I was going to do Ted

Helen gasps with the implications of that...

Peter rips duct tape off M.J.'s mouth...

Peter punches M.J. who is handculled in her car; they are

parked in front of the Lecture Hall.

He hangs up.

INSERT: TAPE MONITOR.  WE HEAR HELEN HANGING UP.  A SMALL

COMPUTER CHIP VOICE IS HEARD.  THE FBI MAN IS MEASURING

SUGAR INTO HIS COFFEE AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM.  HE CAN'T

HEAR:

BATHROOM DRAWER

It is pulled open: metallic sounds of  bullets rolling on the

wooden drawer: her hand bats away the usual bathroom drawer

garbage and pull Ruben's gun out; HER TREMBLING FINGERS

RELOAD IT.

EXT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALL - NIGHT

Helen wearing loose coat, jeans and sneakers opens the door.

FRED snaps out of a sound sleep.

FRED GOES.  HELEN STEPS RESOLUTELY INTO THE HALL, FOR

REASSURANCE BRACES HERSELF WITH A HAND ON THE WALL.

THE HALLWAY (HER POV).  IT SEEMS MILES LONG.  SOUND: HER

FRONT DOOR CLICKING SHUT -- THE SAME ESSENTIAL EVENT AS SO

LONG AGO WHEN RUBEN HAD TO SHOOT OFF THE DOOR LOCK...

HELEN LOOKS BACK AT THE DOOR.  BRIDGES BURNED.  TURNS BACK.

HER HAND ON WALL: AS SHE MOVES A TENTATIVE STEP HER HAND

PRESSES HEAVILY, SLIDING ALONG THE WALL.  THEN HER HAND

MOVES A LITTLE FASTER, AND FASTER.

HER POV.  THE HALL SEEMS MORE NORMAL.  MOVING SHOT PICKS UP

SPEED...

HER HAND NOW BRUSHES THE WALL WITH ONLY FINGERTIPS.

HELEN MOVES WITH MORE AND MORE CONFIDENCE: HER AGORAPHOBIA

IS GONE... HER HAND DROPS TO HER SIDE...

EXT. HER BUILDING - NIGHT

The door opens and Helen appears in it.  She confronts the

street and the night... One more threshold to cross...

STREET: HER OLD SAAB IS PARKED.  THE ANTENNA IS GONE, AND

IT'S COVERED WITH CITY GRIME.  The night seems to roar; the

lights blur and flare.  A truck comes past too fast,

stirring up dust and buffeting her with wind.

HELEN steeling herself and running the few steps to her car.

INT. CAR as she slides into the driver's seat, slamming the

door and locking it.  She drives off into the night.

EXT. MULUSKEY AUDITORIUM -  NIGHT

A broad view through shadowy trees shows it's lighted

facade.  Parked in front of is M.J.'s car.  SUDDENLY FROM

BEHIND THE TREES, SAKS STEPS OUT IN FRONT, BLOCKING THE WAY!

REVERSE:  HELEN'S CAR IS COMING UP THE STREET TOWARDS US.

SAKS (AND NOW WE SEE OTHER SWAT TYPES IN THE SHADOWS, HIDDEN

FROM THE VIEW OF THE AUDITORIUM) STANDS IN THE STREET

FLAGGING HER DOWN --

SHE STOPS, PUTTING DOWN WINDOW.  SAKS RESTS HIS HAND ON THE

DOOR... He shoves no sign of recognizing her...

SAKS HAS THE DOOR OPEN AND IS REACHING TO PULL HER FROM THE

DRIVER'S SEAT... HELEN SUCKS IN HER BREATH AND JAMS ON THE

GAS.  SAKS IS ALMOST DRAGGED AWAY WITH HER, SPUN AROUND AND

FALLING ON THE PAVEMENT.  SHE SLAMS THE DOOR AS SHE SPEEDS

TOWARD THE AUDITORIUM...

SAKS, CURSING, LEAPS TO HIS FEET; A SWAT TYPE AIMS HIS GUN

AFTER HELEN, BUT SAKS PUTS HIS HAND ON THE WEAPON STOPPING

HIM FROM SHOOTING.

NEW ANGLE: Helen's Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed

street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and

brakes behind M.J.'s car.

CLOSE: HELEN.  Sudden silence when she kills the car engine.

She gets out of the car.  As she walks even her sneakers

make an echo from the silent stone facade... She walks up

the wide stairs...

INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The huge doors creak open and Helen enters.  She stands,

listening: light streams in from the exterior through tall

windows, otherwise it's all back shadows, weird enough

without the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily

returns...

Helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her.

She stands listening: we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a

building cooling in the night air.  Or is the movement of

Peter somewhere in the room?

She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the

auditorium...

CLOSE: HELEN staring, trying to SEE.  NOTHING.

THEN:

PETER IS STARING BACK.  HIS FACE BECOMES DARYLL LEE.  THE

VISION SNAPS.

HELEN: SHE TURNS AND WALKS PAST THE ROSTRUM OF THE STAGE TO

A DOOR UPSTAGE LEFT... OPENING INTO A LONG AND DARK

CORRIDOR.  SHE GROPES FOR LIGHT SWITCHES, CAN'T FIND OUT ANY.

THE CORRIDOR LEADS TO THE LADIES' ROOM ON THE RIGHT.  AS SHE

WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, IT BEGINS TO RESEMBLE TO HER THE

SAME WALK SHE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING: AND SUDDENLY AT THE

DOOR TO THE LADIES' ROOM SHE SEEMS TO SEE THE FAT COP.  SHE

SHAKES HER HEAD AND THE VISION IS GONE.

REPLACED BY INT. LADIES' ROOM.  THE COP IS NOW HELD FROM

BEHIND BY DARYLL LEE - SMILING AT HELEN.  IN REVERSE, WE SEE

FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HELEN HAS THE ROPE WELL AWAY FROM

HER NECK.  WE REALIZE SHE HAS AMPLE TIME TO WARN THE COP,

BUT SHE IS PARALYZED, FASCINATED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN

TERRIBLE

INTERCUTS BETWEEN DARYLL LEE GRINNING

AT HER, HELEN'S HELPLESS HORROR, THE COP'S APPEALING LOOK TO

HER AND BACK TO DARYLL LEE AS (BELOW THE FRAME) HE SLITS THE

COP'S THROAT AND LETS HIM FALL TO THE FLOOR.

HELEN (FLASHBACK) AT LAST BEGINS TO SCREAM!

CLOSE: HELEN (PRESENT) RECOVERING.  (SHE HASN'T SCREAMED AT

ALL.)  SHE PULLS RUBEN'S GUN FROM HER POCKET AND SHOVES OPEN

THE DOOR INTO THE LADIES' ROOM.

AS THE DOOR OPENS.  THE LIGHTS ARE ON: IT IS BRILLIANT,

BLINDING IN HERE.  SHE STEPS IN.  THERE IS A SOUND THAT

DRAWS HER ROUND, HER GUN COMING UP: BACK OF THE DOOR IS THE

BROOM CLOSET... SHE FIRES TWO ROUNDS INTO THE CLOSET DOOR.

IT SPRINGS OPEN AND MOPS AND PAILS FALL THUNDEROUSLY OUT

ONTO THE TILE FLOOR.

SHE WHIRLS TO COVER HER BACK; FACES THE STALLS.

EXT. SAKS' ROADBLOCK - NIGHT

THEY REACT TO ECHOES OF THE GUNFIRE.

Men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows

toward the Auditorium...

INT. LADIES' ROOM

HELEN MOVES ALONG THE STALLS PUSHING DOORS OPEN.  UNTIL SHE

SHOVES ONE OPEN AND SEES:

M.J. IS HANGING BY A NOOSE, DANGLING THE SAME WAY HELEN DID

IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE.  SHE IS ALIVE, HOLDING THE NOOSE

FROM HER NECK BY ONE HAND...

HELEN STARTS TO RUSH TO HER ASSISTANCE, WHEN THE LIGHTS GO

OUT.  PETER TAKES HER FROM BEHIND, SWIFTLY DISARMING HER,

REGARDING THE GUN WITH AMAZEMENT.

WITHOUT PAUSE HE PUMPS TWO BULLETS INTO M.J. WHERE SHE

HANGS.  HER BODY JUMPS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE BULLETS, HER

HEAD FLIES BACK AND SHE SLUMPS, THE NOOSE TIGHTENS; THE DOOR

OF THE STALL SWINGS SLOWLY SHUT, AS PETER TURNS ON HELEN,

WHERE SHE LIES ON THE FLOOR, HORROR-STRUCK.

EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

WITH EFFICIENCY AND CAUTION FBI SWAT TYPES MOVE TOWARD THE

AUDITORIUM.  A GRAPPLING HOOK IS THROWN HIGH OVER THE ROOF;

THEY PREPARE FOR AN ASSAULT.  A HELICOPTER SWOOPS IN, BATHING

THE SCENE IN ITS BRILLIANT LIGHT...

INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT

PETER HAS HELEN ON THE STAGE WHERE CHAIRS ARE RANDOMLY

SCATTERED AND PUSHED HER TO A SEAT FACING HIM, ALMOST KNEE

TO KNEE... HELEN WILL USE HER PSYCHOLOGICAL WILES TO TRY TO

TAKE AWAY PETER'S CONTROL OF THE SITUATION... PETER LOOKS UP

AT THE SOUND... HE IS PROUD AND THRILLED.

about

Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a

pill into his mouth and swallows...

it was like for a man to die.

THERE IS NOISE OUTSIDE... LIKE SOMEONE BREAKING IN.

HE GRABS HER, AND SHE MOVES WITH HIM, WITHOUT RESISTANCE, AS

HE TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS INSIDE.

FLOODLIGHTS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATE THE FACADE OUTSIDE,

INCREASING THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIGHT STREAMING IN AND

DARKENING THE SHADOWS FURTHER.  GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM.

He leads her back to the stage... he pushes her into a chair

facing him... He looks into her face and smiles...

BEHIND HIM A SHADOWY FIGURE DARTS FROM HIDING SPOT TO A

VANTAGE POINT: WE CAN'T MAKE OUT THE FIGURE... HELEN SEES

BUT PETER DOES NOT.

He leans toward her with the knife.  This might be the

moment.  His gun lies on the floor beside him.

HER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM; HE SEES IT

AND STOOPS TO PICK UP THE GUN AND FIRES INTO THE SHADOWS,

TWO OR THREE QUICK ROUNDS.  HE TURNS BACK TO HELEN, DROPPING

THE GUN TO REACH FOR THE KNIFE.

HELEN HEAD BUTTS HIM WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH, KNOCKING HIM

BACKWARD.  SHE STANDS... HE COMES UP WITH GUN... AND AIMS AT

HER...

BEHIND HIM M.J. STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS HAVING NOW A CLEAN

SHOT.

HELEN DOESN'T GIVE A CLUE, JUST LOOKS INTO PETER'S EYES AS

M.J. AND PETER IN SLOW MOTION DETAILS AS SHE LINES UP HER

SHOT: SHE COULD KILL HIM OR GO FOR THE EXPOSED SHOULDER.

M.J. FIRES.

PETER IS SPUN AWAY FROM HELEN BY THE IMPACT, STANDS THERE,

SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK OF THE HIT... HE STARES AT HER.

M.J. HOLDS HER GUN ON HIM, READY TO SHOOT AGAIN, BUT HE JUST

GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE, HIS BODY VIOLENTLY SHUDDERING... AS:

THERE IS A HUGE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND THEN AN ENORMOUS

EXPLOSION THAT THROWS THEM TO THE GROUND.

THE BIG FRONT DOORS ARE BLASTED OPEN, AND THE FLAK VESTED

SWAT TEAM SWARMS THROUGH... SMOKE FROM THE CONCUSSION

GRENADE SWIRLS IN THE CHIAROSCURO OF FLOODLIGHTS AND

SHADOWS.

OUT OF THE SMOKE COME SKI-MASKED SWAT MEN...

PETER TURNS TO THE SWAT TEAM, OFFERING HIMSELF, AS THE WOMEN

SCREAM TO THE SWAT MEN'S WOUNDED AND HARMLESS...

A PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT

TEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETER'S HEAD AND TORSO.

SWAT TEAM

LIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES.

PETER'S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND

SLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP.

INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

M.J. SITS AS PARAMEDIC GENTLY PULL OFF HER SHIRT AND THE

BULLET PROOF VEST THAT SAVED HER LIFE.

The medic turns to his medicine bag.  Cops swarm around

them.  Helen sits down next to M.J.  M.J. begins to put on

her shirt, wincing at the movement.  Helen helps her.

SAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND

LIGHT AND SHADOW.  When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun

and hands it to him.  It is what he expects, but she

misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her

resignation from the cops.  He takes it only as a part of

officer related shooting routine.  SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE

AS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE, KNOWS SHE FIRES IT, APPROVED.

He nods to Helen...

B.G. the cops have pulled PETER'S BODY BY THE FEET, LETTING

HIM BUMPITY BUMPITY BUMPITY DOWN THE STEPS from the stage

and lifted him onto a gurney.  The body is wheeled past

them, as...

Of no importance to him, he turns away...

INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

In the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big

exterior doors (now the worse for wear from the concussion

grenades).  Outside, through the glass we SEE a media circus

under the BRIGHT LIGHTS put up for the assault.  M.J. and

HELEN SQUINT AGAINST THE LIGHT, AND TURN...

THE AUDITORIUM (POV).

The cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a

small door -- easy escape.  They run toward it...

EXT. MCCLUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

It is dark where they step out into the night.  Around the

corner of the building we see the light from the MEDIA

CIRCUS.  THEN HELEN STEPS OFF DOWN INTO THE DARK CAMPUS.

M.J. LOOKS AT HER: REALIZING: HELEN IS NO LONGER AFRAID.

SHE CATCHES UP TO HER.  HOLD ON THEIR BACKS AS THEY WALK

AWAY...

need a ride

The two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside

the circle of media.  CAMERA RISES AND RISES TO A HIGH FULL

SHOT.

THE MOUTH AND THE HAIRCUT spot them and race toward them.

On the two women getting in the car...

HIGH FULLSHOT OF THE CAMPUS AS THEY DRIVE AWAY INTO THE

NIGHT.
