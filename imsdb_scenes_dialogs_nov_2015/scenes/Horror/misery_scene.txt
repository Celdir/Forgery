FADE IN ON:

A SINGLE CIGARETTE. A MATCH. A HOTEL ICE BUCKET that holds a

bottle of champagne. The cigarette is unlit. The match is of

the kitchen variety. The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon.

There is only one sound at first: a strong WIND--

--now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of TYPING as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PAUL SHELDON typing at a table in his hotel suite. It's really

a cabin that's part of a lodge. Not an ornate place. Western

themed.

He is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous

mountains. It's afternoon. The sky is grey. Snow is scattered

along the ground. We're out west somewhere. The WIND grows

stronger--there could be a storm.

PAUL pays no attention to what's going on outside as he

continues to type.

He's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good

face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other

words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen

years and for half that time, the most recent half, a

remarkably successful one.

He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a

hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another

burst of TYPING. He studies what he's written, then--

THE PAPER, as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the

table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words:

A PILE OF MANUSCRIPT at the rear of the table. He puts this

last page on, gets it straight and in order, hoists it up,

folds it to his chest, the entire manuscript--hundreds of

pages.

PAUL, as he holds his book to him. He is, just for a brief

moment, moved.

A SUITCASE across the room. PAUL goes to it, opens it and

pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather

briefcase. Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the

briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it,

and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a

child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself

a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match--

there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales

deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles.

HOLD BRIEFLY, then--

LODGE - DAY

PAUL--exiting his cabin. He stops, makes a snowball, throws

it, hitting a sign.

He throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65 MUSTANG and,

holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives

away.

A SIGN that reads "Silver Creek Lodge." Behind the sign is

the hotel itself--old, desolate. Now the '65 Mustang comes

out of the garage, guns ahead toward the sign. As "Shotgun"

by Jr. Walker and the Allstars starts, he heads off into the

mountains.

THE SKY. Gun-metal grey. The clouds seem pregnant with snow.

PAUL, driving the Mustang, the battered briefcase on the

seat beside him.

THE ROAD AHEAD. Little dainty flakes of snow are suddenly

visible.

THE CAR, going into a curve and

PAUL, driving, and as he comes out of the curve, a stunned

look hits his face as we

THE ROAD AHEAD--and here it comes--a mountain storm; it's as

if the top has been pulled off the sky and with no warning

whatsoever, we're into a blizzard and

THE MUSTANG, slowing, driving deeper into the mountains.

PAUL, squinting ahead, windshield wipers on now.

THE MUSTANG, rounding another curve, losing traction--

PAUL, a skilled driver, bringing the car easily under control.

THE ROAD

Snow is piling up.

PAUL driving confidently, carefully. Now he reaches out,

ejects the tape, expertly turns it over, pushes it in and,

as the MUSIC continues, he hums along with it.

THE SKY. Only you can't see it.

There's nothing to see  but the unending snow, nothing to

hear but the wind which keeps getting wilder.

THE ROAD. Inches of snow on the ground now. This is desolate

and dangerous.

PAUL, driving.

THE SNOW. Worse.

THE ROAD, curving sharply, drop ping. A sign reads: "Curved

Road, Next 13 Miles."

THE MUSTANG, coming into view, hitting the curve--no problem--

no problem at all--and then suddenly, there is a very serious

problem and as the car skids out of control--

PAUL, doing his best, fighting the conditions and just as it

looks like he's got things going his way--

THE ROAD, swerving down and

THE MUSTANG, all traction gone and

PAUL, helpless and

THE MUSTANG, skidding, skidding and

THE ROAD as it drops more steeply away and the wind whips

the snow across and

THE MUSTANG starting to spin and

THE MOUNTAINSIDE as the car skids off the road, careens down,

slams into a tree, bounces off, flips, lands upside down,

skids, stops finally, dead.

HOLD ON THE CAR A MOMENT

There is still the sound of the WIND, and there is still the

music coming from the tape, perhaps the only part of the car

left undamaged. Nothing moves inside. There is only the WIND

and the TAPE. The wind gets louder.

THE WRECK looked at from a distance. The MUSIC sounds are

only faintly heard.

THE AREA WHERE THE WRECK IS--AS SEEN FROM THE ROAD. The car

is barely visible as the snow begins to cover it.

THE WRECK from outside, and we're close to it now, with the

snow coming down ever harder--already bits of the car are

covered in white.

CAMERA MOVES IN TO

PAUL. He's inside and doing his best to fight is, but his

consciousness is going. He tries to keep his eyes open but

they're slits.

Slowly, he manages to reach out with his left arm for his

briefcase--

--and he clutches it to his battered body. The MUSIC continues

on.

But PAUL is far from listening. His eyes flutter, flutter

again. Now they're starting to close.

The man is dying.

Motionless, he still clutches the battered briefcase.

HOLD ON THE CASE. Then--

The BRIEFCASE in Paul's hands as he sits at a desk.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

We are in New York City in the office of Paul's literary

agent, MARCIA SINDELL. The walls of the large room are

absolutely crammed with book and movie posters, in English

and all other kinds of other languages, all of them featuring

the character of MISERY CHASTAIN, a perfectly beautiful woman.

Misery's Challenge, Misery's Triumph--eight of them. All

written by Paul Sheldon.

PAUL, lifting up the battered briefcase--maybe when new it

cost two bucks, but he treats it like gold.

THE TWO OF THEM

On the word "tombstone"

PAUL'S TOMBSTONE--the upside down car with the blizzard coming

gale-force and his motionless body trapped inside the car.

The WIND screams. PAUL'S EYES flutter, then close.

Hold

Keep holding as--

Suddenly there's a new sound as a crowbar SCRATCHES at the

door--

-- nd now the door is ripped open as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A BUNDLED-UP FIGURE gently beginning to pull PAUL and the

case from the car. For a moment, it's hard to tell if it's a

man or woman--

--not to let the cat out of the bag or anything, but it is,

very much, a woman. Her name is ANNIE WILKES and she is close

to Paul's age. She is in many ways a remarkable creature.

Strong, self-sufficient, passionate in her likes and dislikes,

loves and hates.

PAUL AND ANNIE as she cradles him in her arms. Once he's

clear of the car, she lays him carefully in the snow

PAUL AND ANNIE: CLOSE UP. She slowly brings her mouth down

close to his. Then their lips touch as she forces air inside

him.

PAUL, as he starts to breathe--

--in a moment his eyes suddenly open wide, but he's in shock,

the eyes see nothing--

ANNIE--the moment she sees him come to life, she goes into

action, lifting PAUL in a fireman's carry, starting the

difficult climb back up the steep hill.

As she moves away, she and Paul are obliterated by the white

falling snow.

THE WHITE OF WHAT SEEMS LIKE A HOSPITAL. Everything is bled

of color. It's all vague--

--we are looking at this from Paul's blurred vision.

And throughout this next sequence, there are these SOUNDS,

words really, but they make no sense.

"...no... worry...

...be... fine...

...good care... you...

...I'm your number one fan..."

The first thing we see during this is something all white.

It takes a moment before we realize it's a ceiling.

Now, a white wall.

An I.V. bottle is next, the medicine dripping down a tube

into PAUL'S LEFT ARM. The other arm is bandaged and in a

sling.

ANNIE is standing beside the bed. She wears off-white and

seems very much like a nurse. A good nurse. She has pills in

her hands.

PAUL. Motionless, dead pale. He has a little beard now. Eyes

barely open, he's shaking with fever.

ANNIE is quickly by his side.

And now the gibberish words make sense.

She helps him to swallow, as Paul's eyes close.

AN EXTERIOR OF THE PLACE. It's a farmhouse--we 're in a

desolate area with mountains in the background.

THE HOUSE is set on a knoll so that Paul's room, although on

the first floor, is ten feet off the ground.

PAUL, in the room. He's not on the I.V. anymore. His fever

has broken. Annie enters, pills in her hand.

ANNIE applies a cool rag to his forehead.

PAUL tries to test his left arm.

ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Sometimes her face shows the most remarkable

compassion. It does now.

HOLD ON IT briefly.

CLOSE UP ON PILLS IN ANNIE'S HAND

PAUL'S ROOM

He lies in bed. His fever is gone, but he's terribly weak.

ANNIE. As she lays the pills on PAUL'S TONGUE, she gives him

a glass of water from the nearby bed table.

PAUL, swallowing eagerly.

ANNIE, watching him, sympathetically.

And now suddenly she flicks off the blankets, uncovering his

body.

PAUL, staring, stunned at the bottom half of his body as we

PAUL'S LEGS. From the knees down he resembles an Egyptian

mummy--she's splinted them with slim steel rods that look

like the hacksawed remains of aluminum crutches and there's

taping circling around.

From the kness up they're all swollen and throbbing and

horribly bruised and discolored.

PAUL, lying back, stunned with disbelief.

ANNIE: CLOSE UP

HOLD on her ecstatic face.

Then--

MISERY'S PERFECT FACE. We're back in SINDELL's office in New

York. The office looks just the same, posters and manuscripts

all over. But she doesn't.

She holds the phone and she is fidgety, insecure.

SMALL OFFICE IN SILVER CREEK

...with a view of the mountains.

A MARVELOUS LOOKING MAN sits at a desk, by himself, holding

the phone. In his sixties, he's still as bright, fast and

sassy as he was half-a-lifetime ago. Never mind what his

name is, everyone calls him BUSTER.

SINDELL in her office. She pushes the speakerphone, gets up,

paces; she's very hesitant when she speaks about Paul. Almost

embarrassed--

BUSTER'S OFFICE

He rolls a penny across the back of one hand--he's very good

at it, doesn't even look while he does it.

SINDELL, really embarrassed now.

BUSTER. He nods as a WOMAN enters, carrying lunch. It's his

wife, VIRGINIA. She begins putting the food down on a table

for the both of them.

SINDELL. She smiles, a genuine sense of relief.

BUSTER

As he hangs up--

BUSTER. The penny flies across the back of his hand. He

doesn't look at it, stares instead out the window at the

mountains.

HOLD ON BUSTER for a moment.

PAUL'S ROOM

ANNIE's soft, sweet laughter is heard. She stands over him,

finishing shaving him with a very sharp straight razor. She

wears what we will come to know as her regular costume--plain

wool skirts, grey cardigan sweaters.

ANNIE concentrates on shaving him with great care; she has

wonderful, strong hands.

ANNIE: CLOSE UP

PAUL, looking at her. There's something terribly touching

about her now.

ANNIE starts cleaning up.

PAUL. His eyes close briefly, he grimaces.

ANNIE, watching him, concerned. She glances at her watch.

She turns and goes out of the room.

PAUL, watching her.

THE MANAGER'S OFFICE AT THE SILVER CREEK LODGE

Small, neat, one window--outside, snow covers all.

BUSTER AND LIBBY, THE MANAGER, are going over books and

records. Libby is an old guy, walks with a cane.

But you can tell he's not sure at all as we

A SPOON FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH BEEF BARLEY SOUP

PAUL'S ROOM.

He lies in bed. Sun comes in the lone window. ANNIE sits on

the bed, a large bowl of soup in her hands, feeding him.

She stops, fills the spoon up again.

ANNIE. She holds the soup bowl in one hand, the muddy-colored

beef barley soup close to spilling.

PAUL is amused by this.

THE SOUP, almost spilling as she gets more agitated.

PAUL, almost laughing as some soup hits the coverlet.

PAUL--his smile disappears.

ANNIE, and she is just totally embarrassed.

She hands him his pills and starts to clean the soup off the

coverlet. Then she makes the sweetest smile.

Flustered, she turns away as we--

A ROAD IN THE MOUNTAINS. Piles of snow all around but it's

been ploughed enough so it's driveable.

A CAR coming into view. Up ahead is the sign we've already

seen: "Curved Road, Next 13 Miles."

INSIDE THE CAR

BUSTER AND HIS WIFE VIRGINIA: Virginia is driving while Buster

intently studies the terrain. He reaches for a large thermos,

pours some coffee, offers it to her. She shakes her head. He

begins to sip it.

She puts her hand on his leg.

THE CAR. Suddenly, it goes into a little icy spin--she fights

it back under control.

INSIDE THE CAR

THE CAR, skidding, slowing, stopping. BOTH OF THEM get out,

go to the edge of the road. Mountains of snow. Nothing much

else visible. Then Buster points.

VIRGINIA, seeing it, unconvinced.

He steps off the road, starts down.

VIRGINIA, watching him, worried--it's very slippery.

BUSTER, graceful, in great shape, navigating down easily.

THE TREE that the car ran into. BUSTER reaches it, studies

it.

VIRGINIA, staring out after him--she can't see him because

the drop is both too steep and covered with trees and mounds

of snow.

BUSTER. He's moved away from the tree now, going toward where

the Mustang is buried.

THE MOUND OF SNOW with the Mustang inside.

BUSTER, making his way closer to it, closer, staring around.

THE AREA. Nothing to be seen--everything is covered with

mountains of snow. You could have a house down there and not

be able to see it. Just glaring white.

BUSTER, angry, frustrated, turning around and around and

BUSTER from another angle, from behind the mound with the

Mustang inside--and out of his sight, glistening in the sun,

a bit of the door protrudes. But, of course, Buster can't

see it.

HOLD ON BUSTER, in a sour mood, staring around as the edge

of the door continues to glisten.

CUT TO:

VIRGINIA, on the road as Buster makes his way back up, still

ticked.

As they get in the car--

ANOTHER CAR DRIVING BY--it's Annie in her Jeep--neither she

nor Buster notice each other.

PAUL'S ROOM

The door opens and ANNIE enters.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Paul's eyes fluttering awake to see the hardback copy of his

novel, Misery's Child, in Annie's hands. She's never been

more excited--

She starts to leave, stops at the door.

As she leaves--

PAUL, watching as she enters, moves to him, carrying a tray.

He starts, with effort, to eat.

PAUL'S ROOM. MID-AFTERNOON

ANNIE is clearing Paul's tray. She hands him his Novril; he

quickly swallows them.

As PAUL signs the book:

He finishes the autograph, hands the book back to her.

THE WINDOW - LATE - AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT

THE DOOR. IT opens and guess what--a sow lumbers in.

PAUL, kind of stunned as this female pig skitters its way

around the room, excited, confused, slipping and sliding.

ANNIE, all smiles and happiness, laughing in the doorway.

THE PIG, snorting around the room.

PAUL AND ANNIE, watching it.

PAUL watches as the pig skitters out of the room with ANNIE

in pursuit, happily imitating the pig.

PAUL staring after them--what the hell was that?

THE WINDOW. DUSK.

ANNIE'S VOICE is heard softly.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

ANNIE, standing at the window, her back to the room.

In bed, PAUL is dealing with a bedpan, peeing.

There is a peeing sound.

He is embarrassed.

As she takes the bedpan...

PAUL, attempting to smile. There is not much he can say to

this.

With that, she exits.

THE WINDOW. MOONLIGHT.

PAUL. He's been dozing but now his eyes flutter awake as we

THE DOOR. It opens and ANNIE enters, comes to his bedside.

PAUL. Hard to see. He squints up as we

ANNIE. CLOSE UP: her face is ashen pale.

And now she has lifted a chair--it's heavy but she's very

strong--and she raises it and turns on Paul, and it's high

above her head, and PAUL realizes that this might be it, she

might shatter him with it, crunch his skull--and that's just

what she seems she's about to do--and then she swings it,

not against him but against the wall, and it shatters and

she's panting from the effort as she turns on him again, her

voice surprisingly soft.

PAUL, watching as she closes the door behind her. Then there

is a RATTLE OF A KEY and the sound of the door to his room

LOCKING.

ANNIE, getting in her Cherokee and gunning away.

THE ROOM

PAUL lies still. He looks around the room and listens for

sounds. All he hears are the SOUNDS OF A WINTER NIGHT in the

mountains. After a few beats, he takes a deep breath and

then begins his greatest effort of all: to force his body

out of bed, to make it move.

He's still weak from what he's endured, but that's not the

main thing: it's the pain. Any attempt at movement and his

legs scream. He sags back, lies there still a moment. Slowly

he tries to maneuver his body off the bed. He rolls over

onto his stomach, then tries to lower himself onto the floor

by moving down head first. His good arm hits the floor, and

he is able to hold himself up but, realizing there is no way

to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain, he girds

himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to

the floor.

The pain is excruciating. After he regains his composure, he

slowly crawls toward the door.

He reaches up and tries the handle. It is, in fact, locked.

He awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is

much too painful and to no avail. He crawls back over to the

bed, realizes there's no way to climb back in, then grabs

the blanket from the bed, wraps it around himself, and closes

his eyes.

BUSTER'S OFFICE. DAY.

He sits alone at his desk on the telephone, staring at the

Rocky Mountain Gazette spread in front of him.

THE NEWSPAPER'S FRONT PAGE

In a prominent spot on the top is what is most likely a book-

jacket photo of Paul. Above the picture is the following:

"HAVE YOU SEEN PAUL SHELDON?"

BUSTER is on the phone with Marcia Sindell.

VIRGINIA enters, carrying some files.

BUSTER. His eyes flick up to her. An almost imperceptible

shake of the head.

HOLD FOR A MOMENT, then--

FACES. They are distorted, and they come into view but

briefly, then change into the next distorted face. All kinds--

there is no order to them

--young, Oriental, female, male, pretty, sad, black, not so

pretty, happy, white, old--what we HEAR is this:

"...You've changed my life..."

"...I'm your number one fan..."

"...I'm a really big fan of yours..."

"...I'm your biggest fan..."

"...Don't ever stop writing those Misery books..."

"...I've read all your books, but the Misery's... well..."

"...I'm your number one fan..."

"...You've given me such pleasure..."

"...I feel like you're writing just for me..."

And now, it gets kicked up in speed and all goes faster,

many times overlapping.

"...I love you... I'm your number one fan... I'm your biggest

fan... We love you... number one... love you... biggest...

love you... number one... number one... you poor dear

thing..."

This last was said by Annie, out of focus, and for a moment,

she stays that way--

THE ROOM, AS IT SNAPS BACK INTO FOCUS--ANNIE is standing by

the bed. It is dusk.

She wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers.

Her eyes are bright and vivacious--the fact is, this is the

prettiest ANNIE WILKES has ever looked.

Now she turns, goes to the doorway, keeping on talking. She

is never out of sight.

She exits and re-enters wheeling something toward his bed.

It's a charcoal barbecue, the kind you use in summer for

cooking hamburgers. She holds several items in her arms: a

box of Diamond Blue Tip wooden matches, a can of lighter

fluid. And most noticeably, Paul's manuscript.

ANNIE AND PAUL. He watches, mute, as she takes off the grill,

puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the

charcoal goes, spritzes it with lighter fluid. The grill is

close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match.

ANNIE, looking at him.

She hands him the box of kitchen matches.

ANNIE, watching him.

THE MATCHES. PAUL'S HANDS are starting to tremble now. He

can't do it.

There is a long silence. PAUL doesn't move.

She's holding the can of lighter fluid in her hand as she

speaks and absentmindedly flicks a few drops of the fluid on

the bed.

PAUL watches as the fluid continues to drop on the bed.

PAUL. His hands shaking. Almost robot-like, he strikes one.

It flames.

THE BARBECUE, as Paul's hand appears, drops the match on the

fluid-soaked manuscript. For a moment--nothing--

--and then, KABOOM, the goddamn thing practically explodes

and

PAUL, staring, dazed, and as the flames leap higher,

ANNIE, suddenly scared and startled at the heat and the size

of the flames and the full baking heat and

THE BARBECUE. The sound is LOUDER as the flames leap up and

now charred bits of paper begin floating upward and

ANNIE, watching, as more bits of paper rise.

And she starts trying to catch them.

A PIECE OF BURNING PAPER in midair, floating against the

gauzy curtain, and for a moment it looks like the curtain

will catch fire and

ANNIE, panicked, racing out of the room, going "Goodness,

heavens to Betsy"--

THE BARBECUE, and what's left of the book.

PAUL, and he cannot take his eyes off the disaster.

ANNIE, hurrying back in, carrying a big bucket, slopping

water as she lifts the bucket.

THE LAST of the manuscript as the bucket of water is tossed

onto it--there's hissing and steam and as the steam clears

it all looks now like a log in a brackish pond.

As she starts to wheel the barbecue out, suddenly there is a

new and different sound as we

PAUL, head turning toward the window.

ANNIE taking  a step toward the window, stopping for a moment.

The sound we're hearing is a motor. A HELICOPTER MOTOR. And

it's getting louder. Annie goes to the window now, looks

toward the sky as we

A HELICOPTER flying along.

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

BUSTER and a PILOT are in the machine. Buster has a pair of

binoculars looped around his neck, a map rumpled in his lap.

Another nod. The PILOT points down. BUSTER stares through

the binoculars.

WHAT HE SEES: ANNIE'S JEEP parked in front of her house.

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

As the pilot starts to change direction

ANNIE at the window, watching, as the helicopter turns, starts

off.

PAUL, listening as the MOTOR sound recedes.

ANNIE, staring out the window.

She exits. PAUL takes the two Novril, stares at them, then

deliberately tucks them under his mattress.

PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

As PAUL is finishing the last of his tuna casserole. There

are two Novrils on his tray. We hear strains of TV GAME SHOW

THEME MUSIC. These sounds are not surprising. Paul has heard

them before.

ANNIE'S ROOM. NIGHT.

It is much smaller than Paul's and filled with religious

bric-a-brac, pictures of Paul Sheldon, and a TV on a portable

stand. Annie lies in bed, with an open bag of Cheetos resting

on her stomach and a big quart-sized plastic bottle of Coke

on the nightstand. As she munches away, she is heavily

engrossed in her favorite TV show, "The Love Connection." As

Chuck Woolery extracts the embarrassing details of a couple's

romantic interlude, we

Paul faintly hearing the sounds of the TV. He has now finished

eating. He takes the two Novril from under the mattress. He

then undoes the sheet, takes his fork and delicately pokes a

hole in the mattress, then stuffs all four pills back into

the hole.

FARMHOUSE

Coming up to dawn.

PAUL'S DOOR slowly opening.

PAUL, staring at  the door.

WHEELS, seen from underneath the bed, being rolled around

the foot of the bed. We realize PAUL is in a wheelchair with

ANNIE pushing him.

ANNIE exits.

PAUL, quickly shoving the Novril into the mattress.

PAUL. Stunned.

ANNIE: CLOSE UP. In an almost religious fervor.

PAUL

She rolls him over to a table she has set up by the window.

THE WINDOW, as the wheelchair approaches it.

The sky is innocent of clouds. There's a green forest climbing

the flank of the nearest mountain. A plot of open ground

between the house and the mountain. A neat red barn where

the livestock stay. A Jeep Cherokee, maybe five years old. A

Fisher plow. And no neighbors in sight. This is a desolate

place.

PAUL, staring out the window.

ANNIE in the doorway, carrying reams of typing paper, pencils,

pens and sharpener.

PAUL, watching her--it's all kind of amazing. She hands him

a box of typing paper.

PAUL, looking at the paper. It's Corrasable Bond. An idea

hits him; he masks it as best he can.

As she approaches, he rubs his thumb over the pencil mark.

With that, she throws the ream of paper in PAUL'S LAP, causing

considerable pain.

THE DOOR as she slams it shut, locks it, stomps off and

THE WINDOW. Annie, in a parka, can be seen storming out in

the direction where her Cherokee was parked. She gets in and

drives off.

PAUL. He heaves a sigh, reaches out toward his tortured knees,

then drops his head. He sees something.

BOBBY PIN on the floor.

PAUL, as he moves toward the bobby pin. Or tries to. It's

brutally hard for him. The chair moves half a foot. Stops.

Paul strains again. Another half foot. Another.

The BOBBY PIN. The wheelchair is beside it now. PAUL reaches

down for it. Can't make it. Tries again. Can't. He takes a

deep breath, forces himself to bend, ignoring the pain. The

bobby pin is in his hands.

PAUL, inserting the bobby pin into the keyhole, beginning to

jimmy the lock.

THE LOCK--it makes a SOUND--something has caught.

PAUL, excited, trying to force the bobby pin and he's doing

great--until it slips from his hands, falls to the floor

again.

THE BOBBY PIN. Paul reaches for it. The pain has him. He

reaches again, involuntarily cries out. But he grabs it,

clutches it tight.

THE KEYHOLE. Paul is trying to jimmy the lock a second time.

No luck.

PAUL. In wild frustration.

THE KEYHOLE. There is a loud CLICKING sound.

THE DOOR as Paul turns the knob. The door opens a crack.

PAUL, trying to get out of the room--but it's a bitch because

in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up

to the door and in order to get out, he's got to maneuver it

out of the way of the door and every turn of the chair's

wheels is an effort for him. He works at it and works at it,

but his energy is failing him. He's pale, perspiring. Finally

he succeeds, barely forces his way into the hall.

PAUL, in the hallway outside. He looks around for a phone.

Doesn't see one. He wheels himself over to the front door,

tries it. It's locked from the outside.

He looks off into the living room, and...

THE TELEPHONE

PAUL, wheeling into the living room. Dark red predominates.

It's a musty room. Over the mantel, a photograph of a six-

year-old ANNIE, with her mother and father in front of the

family car--a new 1952 Buick. These were happier times.

The windows have bars on them.

As PAUL begins to wheel as fast as he can toward the phone--

THE PHONE as PAUL at last grabs for it, gets it, punches the

"operator" button--

He shakes the phone. It's terribly light. He picks it up,

turns it over--it's hollow, just a shell of a telephone. He

stares at it for a long moment, shaking his head, the

disappointment plain.

He puts the phone back on the table.

THE GENERAL STORE. DAY.

Annie exits the store, carrying new paper, hops into her

Cherokee and drives off.

THE STUDY, as PAUL enters. He looks around.

It's stuffed with heavy, graceless furniture as well as lots

of coffee tables covered with knickknacks. As he, with effort,

wheels across it--

A shelf of BOOKS. PAUL SHELDON books. EVERY Paul Sheldon

book.

PAUL, pausing, looking at her collection. The only book on

the shelf that isn't his is a large scrapbook. The title on

the back reads "My Life."

He glances back at the shelf as he forces his wheelchair

across the study, and we

A SMALL TABLE with little ceramic doodads on top. The

wheelchair his it, one of the doodads topples--it's a penguin,

fragile looking, and as it's about to fall to the floor and

shatter--

PAUL, grabbing for it, catching it, putting it back where it

was. He continues his slow way across the room and

THE HALLWAY.

Out in the hallway, on his way toward the kitchen, PAUL

notices a door to his right. He wheels over and surprisingly

it opens. However, this is not a door to the outside of the

house, only a storage pantry. He looks around--nothing but

canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic Coke

containers, etc. Just as he is about to close the door, he

notices an open cardboard box. He opens the flap and sees

all kinds of prescription drugs. Among them are a couple of

strips of Novril encapsulated in blisters. He grabs them and

stuffs them into his sweatpants. Now he closes the pantry

door and heads to the kitchen.

THE KITCHEN

As PAUL approaches it. He starts to wheel his way in, but he

has trouble.

He backs up slightly, wheels forward again--

--but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through.

He pounds his fists on the chair arm, staring as we

THE BACK DOOR. It's at the far end of the kitchen leading to

the outside. It seems somehow less formidable than the front

door did. The windows around the kitchen are barred.

PAUL, staring at the kitchen door--

--then without warning, he makes his move, starting to lower

himself out of the chair

gently to the floor--

--only it doesn't work that way. It's too awkward, he doesn't

have the strength to maneuver properly--

--and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair, slams hard

against the hard floor.

PAUL, crying out in pain as he lands. He lies there for a

moment. Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now. He

is hurting.

He closes his eyes, gathering strength--

--and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his

body across the floor toward the kitchen door.

THE KITCHEN DOOR. It's still a long way away.

PAUL, ignoring his pain, his awkwardness, making his body

move.

THE KITCHEN DOOR. Closer now.

PAUL, growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is

just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and

up and grabs the doorknob--

THE KITCHEN DOOR. Locked solid.

PAUL: CLOSE UP. The disappointment and anger is plain on his

face. His arm drops. He lies still for a moment, panting

from his effort. Then--

PAUL, and his eyes are wide for a moment. You can feel his

wild excitement, as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Sitting on the counter: A SET OF CARVING KNIVES sticking out

of a slotted wooden block.

They seem to be out of reach, but that doesn't stop him. He

starts to crawl over to the counter.

THE ROAD

ANNIE is driving along in her Cherokee. She is heading home.

THE KITCHEN

Now at the counter, PAUL tries to pull himself up with his

one good arm, but even though he is able to chin himself up

to the top of the counter, he is still unable to reach the

knives. He makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing

to the floor.

As he starts to force his way up again--from outside there

comes a sound--the motor of a car.

OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

ANNIE, driving up to the house.

THE KITCHEN

PAUL, throwing himself back to the floor, starting a wild

crawl back across the kitchen toward the wheelchair and

OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

ANNIE, getting out of her Jeep and

KITCHEN

PAUL, crawling, crawling and

OUTSIDE ANNIE'S

ANNIE, walking around to the back of the Jeep and

KITCHEN

PAUL, scrambling wildly up into his wheelchair, starting to

get it turned and

ANNIE'S

ANNIE, opening the back of the Jeep and lifting out several

rectangular boxes of paper and

PAUL, straightened out now, forcing the wheelchair to move,

and now we're into a race, a crazed life-and-death race and

the cuts go fast--

--and ANNIE closes the door of the car--

--and PAUL is suddenly stuck, there's no traction on the rug--

-- ow ANNIE, purchases in hand, starts away from the car for

the house--

--and now PAUL is finally moving toward the bedroom.

--and ANNIE is moving swiftly toward the front door.

-- he drops one of the packages of paper.

PAUL, still biting down, churning his arms with all the

strength he has left. PAUL'S ARMS, aching, start to turn to

rubber.

ANNIE'S FEET, walking quickly across the snow-covered area

in front of the house and

THE BEDROOM DOOR as Paul gets through it, shuts it, and

attacks the bedroom lock with the bobby pin and

ANNIE, unlocking the front door of the house and

THE BEDROOM DOOR, as it locks and

THE FRONT DOOR, unlocking and

ANNIE balancing the bundles under her chin as she jiggles

the key out of the front door lock and

PAUL, soaked.

PAUL. He wheels to exactly where he was when she left him.

He at last allows himself a sigh of relief.

THE DOOR as the sound of a lock CLICKING is heard.

And as the door opens--

PAUL--looking down. Paul's waistband--a half a dozen strips

of Novril ominously stick out.

As the door swings open, he quickly covers the Novril with

this hands.

ANNIE, in the doorway, a strange look on her face.

ANNIE. She stares a moment more, then turns, starts for the

door.

CUT TO:

PAUL watching, and the instant she is out the door in the

hallway, he stuffs the Novril into his pants.

ANNIE, entering the room, the Novril in her hand. She is

genuinely contrite.

She hands him the pills. And rolls him over to the bed.

PAUL putting the pills in his mouth, as she picks him up

from the chair and puts him gently down in bed.

She hands him a pad and pencil.

THE DOORWAY, as ANNIE starts to it.

On that she turns--for the first time, a coquettish look

comes to her face.

PAUL, summoning up all his courage, as he mimes catching it

and forces a smile on. She waves, closes the door.

HOLD ON PAUL. The smile dies. He reaches in and pulls the

two Novril capsules out of his mouth. Now--

THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

BUSTER AND PILOT flying along. Buster is all bundled up as

he stares out, using the binoculars...

SOMETHING SHINY reflecting the sun.

HOLD AS IT ALMOST BLINDS US--we're looking at the part of

Paul's Mustang that was revealed by the snow when Buster

almost found the car.

CRASH SITE

Paul's car being hoisted by chains from the ground and, as

it starts to rise up into the afternoon air...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

THE AREA BY THE CAR--BUSTER is there and a bunch of STATE

POLICEMEN and various MEDIA PEOPLE are there--Buster stands

with the STATE POLICE CHIEF watching as the car is hoisted

via derrick; the sound of the powerful MOTOR lifting the car

is enormous and as the car keeps rising higher and higher

and PEOPLE take pictures and stare and

THE STATE POLICE CHIEF is addressing maybe a dozen REPORTERS.

It's very cold. BUSTER stands slightly away from the group.

After the first sentence, a very cold and very unhappy BUSTER

leaves the gathering.

PAUL'S CAR as Buster studies it, especially the area by the

driver's side where there are still dents visible from Annie's

crowbar.

VIRGINIA moves to him now. They exchange a glance, start

walking together toward their car.

THE CHIEF, surrounded--people are asking questions, raising

hands for attention, and as he answers them--

BUSTER AND VIRGINIA, close together, walking toward their

car.

As they drive off...

PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

PAUL lies in bed listening to the strains of "The Love

Connection," coming from upstairs. As Chuck Woolery drones

on, Paul is intently involved in folding a piece of paper

from his pad. He is making a container of some sort. He

finishes, then reaches down and grabs the Novril capsules

that he has been stashing in the mattress.

Carefully, he opens one and pours it into the palm of his

hand. First he smells it--no odor--then he takes a tiny bit

on a finger and tastes it--no taste. Then, he takes his paper

container and empties the contents of all the pills into it,

then places it under the mattress.

Now, what to do with the empty capsules. He thinks for a

second, then--what the hell--he swallows them. He then places

the packet back in the mattress.

THE TYPEWRITER. DAY.

The window is visible behind it. From this angle, it almost

seems to be staring at PAUL, broken "n" and all. PAUL tests

his wounded arm. He's able to raise it a few inches, but

that's it.

OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

ANNIE is visible heading for the barn, followed by MISERY,

the pig. For a moment, she stops, turns to look back.

Now, as she turns again, moves quickly away--

THE TYPEWRITER

PAUL. He rolls in a piece of paper, types briefly.

WHAT HE'S WRITTEN, AND IT'S THIS:

PAUL, studying the paper. He takes it out, starts to roll in

a new sheet.

THE MACHINE as the new sheet is rolled in.

PAUL, staring at the blank page. He takes a deep breath,

glances outside, then back to the paper.

THE BLANK PAGE

PAUL, and now there's a brief light behind his eyes and

suddenly he types a burst, stares at what he's written.

THE PAPER and these words: "fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck."

PAUL. He closes his eyes briefly, mutters something, kind of

nods, opens his eyes, grabs for another piece of paper, rolls

it in and starts mechanically to type.

A NEW PIECE OF PAPER with the words "Chapter Two" and a half

paragraph of writing as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PAUL WORKING in his room. ANNIE  enters, the first pages of

manuscript in her hands. It's dusk.

ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Still in her childhood reverie. Shouting:

As she goes--

PAUL slumps, staring barefully at the typewriter.

OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NEXT MORNING.

PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.

PAUL is at the table. He takes the Novril off his breakfast

tray, wheels over to the bed, and stuffs them into the

mattress. He hears FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall. He smoothly

wheels back to the table. A pause.

ANNIE enters to remove the tray.

PAUL: CLOSE UP. Blinking.

THE KEYBOARD as the piece of paper slides in and the keys

start to move. Annie stands there for a moment, then quietly

backs out of the room.

THE WINDOW. It's late afternoon.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PAUL in the wheelchair watching as ANNIE finishes reading.

ANNIE, in a fervor.

PAUL, watching her. It's as if he had nothing to do with

anything she's read as she goes on.

THE TWO OF THEM; she touches the pages as if they were gold,

rubbing gently with the tips of her fingers.

Paul shakes his head.

ANNIE, spinning around the room like a happy child.

And with that, she starts to leave.

She stops at the door.

She can't speak.

ANNIE dashes excitedly out of the room. PAUL wheels over to

the bed, pulls the packet of Novril powder out from the

mattress and stuffs it in his pants. The sound of Liberace

playing "Tammy" with orchestra and chorus booms in from beyond

the door.

BUSTER'S OFFICE. DUSK.

VIRGINIA is on the phone.

BUSTER enters carrying a bagful of books.

BUSTER. He puts the bag down, shoots Virginia a look and

grabs the phone. VIRGINIA looks in the bag.

STUDY. NIGHT.

PAUL is sitting at a table that Annie has set up with her

best china and silverware. It is as romantic as Annie Wilkes

gets. ANNIE enters, carrying a basket of rolls. She sits and

serves Paul.

They eat in awkward silence. Finally:

After another pause:

Paul pours more of the Gallo wine, then raises his glass.

She exits into the kitchen. PAUL quickly pulls the packet

filled with Novril powder from his pants. He empties it into

her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his

pants, talking the whole time:

ANNIE re-enters with a candle.

She places the candle on the table. With a slight tremor in

her hand, she lights the candle. PAUL raises his glass.

ANNIE raises her glass.

They clink glasses.

And with that, her emotions having gotten the best of her,

she knocks over the candle. In trying to right the situation,

she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the

candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine.

So they drink their wine.

OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. DAY.

The snow, although still present, has melted somewhat. And

starting now and continuing throughout is this: the sound of

typing.

PAUL'S ROOM

PAUL, working at his typewriter.

THE MANUSCRIPT. Growing.

ANNIE'S BEDROOM. DUSK.

ANNIE, in her room. Reading and loving it.

BUSTER'S DEN. NIGHT.

BUSTER sitting in his den reading a Misery novel by the fire.

VIRGINIA brings him a cup of tea.

PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.

PAUL, the sling off, moving his injured arm. It's more mobile

than before. Testing his strength, he uses his arm to remove

the page and place it on the pile. He puts in another page

and continues to type.

ANNIE, entering Paul's room, carrying a chapter. Handing him

a cup of tea.

THE PILE OF PAPER. Bigger.

OUTSIDE THE BARN

ANNIE, out by the barn. She stares in at the house. Framed

in the window is PAUL, working. She smiles, enters the barn.

PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

He stretches but only briefly, then back to his typing.

THE KITCHEN

ANNIE, cooking happily away, reading a chapter.

PAUL'S ROOM

PAUL, arm out of the sling. He manages to lift the typewriter

once, sets it back down, puts the sling back on.

PAUL'S ROOM. LATER.

ANNIE, bringing a tray of food.

Paul hands her some new pages. As she exits,

BUSTER'S OFFICE

BUSTER, in his office reading. He is alone.

ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

Annie is reading by the fire. Her pig Misery sits beside

her, staring at the pages.

PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.

His fingers just fly, faster than he's ever typed and

PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

Paul, staring and

THE PILE, growing, growing and

PAUL'S FINGERS

PAUL'S ROOM

PAUL, ripping open a new ream of paper...

PAUL'S ROOM. DUSK.

His lips move silently. He's not even aware of it as he nods

and...

THE PAPER IN THE TYPEWRITER, line after line being written.

Paul's face at DAY, NIGHT, and DUSK in rapid succession,

ending with

ANNIE'S FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

Lightning! Giant deep rolls of THUNDER as RAIN begins...

TYPEWRITER being lifted out of frame, then back in, then out

again.

PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

The pile of manuscript has doubled. Maybe two hundred pages.

PAUL, with some effort, is pumping the typewriter up and

down. Finally, he places it back down and puts his arm back

in the sling.

PAUL, looking outside breifly.

THE RAIN. Worse. The SOUND hit s the roof of the house, hits

the window.

ANNIE, lumbering in--she's never looked like this: She's

wearing her slippers and her pink quilted housecoat. Her

eyes are without life. Her hair, loose and straggly, hangs

around her face. Slowly, like a  robot, she goes to PAUL,

who looks silently up at her.

She drops them on the table.

PAUL, as the pills hit his chest and bounce into his lap.

ANNIE

ANNIE: CLOSE UP. And suddenly it's as if she's been turned

off, gone lifeless.

PAUL, staring at her. No sound but the rain.

ANNIE, seen straight on. No light in her eyes.

She slowly reaches into the pocket of her bathrobe and pulls

out a .38 Special.

She is absentmindedly clicking the empty gun.

Robot-like, she crosses to the door and leaves. As she closes

and locks the door--

PAUL, stunned, listening, waiting--

--here is the sound of the front door closing--

--then footsteps on the outside walk--

--the sound of a car door opening and slamming shut.

Now comes the GUNNING of the motor.

THE WINDOW as ANNIE drives by, hunched over the wheel. The

MOTOR sound grows fainter, faint...

BUSTER AND VIRGINIA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

BUSTER AND VIRGINIA are lying in bed. Buster is reading yet

another Misery novel, Misery's Trial. Virginia is also

reading.

ANNIE'S KITCHEN.

The kitchen KNIVES on the counter.

PAUL, now using both arms, forcing his body up toward them.

This isn't easy, it was a bitch the first time he tried it,

but nothing's going to stop him now. He's leaning against

the cupboard, using it for balance--

--his balance starts to go but he won't let it as we

THE KNIVES, AS HIS HAND grabs the largest one, a fat-handled

sharp beauty and

PAUL, and you can sense the relief as he begins to lower

himself to the floor.

THE STUDY

PAUL, back in his wheelchair, knife in his lap, carefully

opening drawers of little tables, looking inside. He closes

them, moves on, unmindful of the rain. Now--

THE SHELF OF PAUL SHELDON BOOKS. As before--

--except the "My Life" scrapbook is gone.

PAUL, glancing around--

--and there it is, on a coffee table in the living room.

Also on the table are a roll of Scotch tape, a pair of

scissors, and a copy of Newsweek. Paul wheels toward the

table and the book, which is as big as a folio Shakespeare

play and as thick as a family Bible.

THE LIVING ROOM

PAUL, opening the book.

THE FIRST PAGE OF THE BOOK, as Paul opens it. It's a newspaper

clipping as is almost all of what follows. A small article:

simply a birth announcement for Anne Marie Wilkes.

PAUL turns the page. This headline reads: "Investment Banker

Carl Wilkes Dies in Freak Fall."

"USC Nursing Student Dies in Freak Fall." That's the headline

on the next page.

Now: "Miss Wilkes is Nursing School Honors Graduate."

Paul turns the page.

Manchester, New Hampshire, Union Leader: "Ernest Gonyar, 79,

Dies After Long Illness."

Now that phrase seems to be what catches our eye--"after

long illness" is from the next article. "Long illness" from

the one after that. Then, on the next page, a variation:

"Short Illness."

Now we're in Pennsylvania: "New Hospital Staff Announced."

And here come those phrases again on page after page--"After

Long Illness." "After Long Illness."

"After Long Illness."

PAUL, transfixed; he keeps on turning the pages--the states

keep changing, moving west. Pennsylvania to Minnesota,

Minnesota to North Dakota. And always the clippings reporting

deaths and deaths and--

--and now we're in Colorado. "NEW HEAD MATERNITY NURSE NAMED."

And now the dead are young and helpless; babies. More and

more of them.

Then a headline which reads:

"HEAD MATERNITY NURSE QUESTIONED ON INFANT DEATHS"

Next page: "MISS WILKES RELEASED."

Next page: "THREE MORE INFANTS DIE."

Next page, at last: "DRAGON LADY ARRESTED."

Then a photo: the front page of the Rocky Mountain Gazette.

Annie on the courthouse steps. "DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE,"

under which there is a statement by Annie Wilkes.

Paul turns quickly to the next page and a very large headline:

"DRAGON LADY FOUND NOT GUILTY"

PAUL just sits there, shaking his head in bewilderment.

THE BOOK, as Paul turns the LAST page.

PAUL, stunned and now we find out why, as we

THE PAGE IN THE BOOK. It's an article from Newsweek magazine,

a picture of Paul's car being hauled up out of the snow.

Above it this caption: "Presumed Dead--Paul Sheldon."

PAUL. Slamming the book shut, putting it back on the coffee

table, then quickly turning his wheelchair as we

PAUL, steering his wheelchair toward the front door. He tries

to position himself for a surprise attack of ANNIE, but he

can't find a way to get close enough. The wheelchair is too

cumbersome. He looks around and decides to head back to his

room. He is faced with the same problem there--so he struggles

into bed and, lying on his back, he rests the knife on his

chest and stares up at the ceiling.

PAUL'S WINDOW, hours later. The rain has stopped.

PAUL--trying to stay awake. After a few beats, he hears

something. It's the sound of a CAR PULLING UP.

HEADLIGHTS can be seen flashing through the window. PAUL

grips the knife and hides it under the covers. The sound of

a CAR DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING, then FOOTSTEPS.

As the FRONT DOOR OPENS, PAUL girds himself for attack. THE

FRONT DOOR CLOSES, then a couple of FOOTSTEPS. Then silence.

Then the FOOTSTEPS continue down the hall and up the stairs.

After a beat, we hear the TELEVISION. Someone is explaining

how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate

with no money down.

PAUL, allowing himself to relax, slips the knife under the

mattress. As the TV DRONES ON, Paul lies staring up at the

ceiling.

OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.

We hear a clap of THUNDER and once again the rain pours down.

CLOSE UP: PAUL--eyes closed. There is another loud THUNDERCLAP

which causes Paul to stir and open his eyes.

He turns his head and another CLAP OF THUNDER is heard,

LIGHTNING flashes and reveals ANNIE standing over his bed.

Before he can react, she jabs a needle into his arm, pulls

it out and starts out of the room.

PAUL tries to raise himself, but the power of the drug causes

him to collapse, unconscious.

THE ROOM. EARLY MORNING.

It's stopped raining, PAUL lies asleep. Now, surprisingly,

we hear a VOICE we've never heard in the movie before--loud--

for an instant we don't recognize the voice, then we do:

It's LIBERACE talking to his audience on a record going,

"Thank you, thank you, what a wonderful thing it is for me

to be back with you in Paris..." PAUL stirs and awakens to

discover that he is strapped to his bed. He can move his

arms, but that's it.

ANNIE, standing in the room, and she looks very together;

her eyes are bright. Too bright. Way too bright.

She comes to the foot of his bed.

PAUL, groggy from being drugged, tries to clear the cobwebs.

PAUL looks up at her--he is totally honest and sincere. As

he talks, his hand surreptitiously begins moving toward the

mattress edge.

ANNIE, as she brings the fat-hand led knife out of her skirt

pocket.

ANNIE, as she walks slowly back to the foot of the bed.

And now a THUMP comes from the foot of the bed. Something is

out of sight.

PAUL, staring at her; waiting.

And with that, she reaches down out of sight and comes up

holding a 16-inch piece of 4 x 4 wood.

ANNIE. She wedges the 4 x 4 firmly between his legs, just

above the ankles, secures it and adjusts his feet.

ANNIE picks up a sledgehammer.

ANNIE, positioning herself to the side of his right ankle.

She takes the sledgehammer back.

As ANNIE swings, the sledgehammer makes contact with the

ankle. It breaks with a sharp CRACK.

PAUL: CLOSE UP, shrieking.

ANNIE, moving to the other side of the bed.

And as she breaks the other ankle, PAUL shrieks even louder.

ANNIE: CLOSE UP.

PAUL'S FACE. He is beyond agony.

For a long moment, nothing.

Then... a FAINT SOUND. After a moment, it begins to become

more intrusive and we can tell what it is: a car horn HONKING.

FADE IN ON:

SILVER CREEK and ANNIE in her Cherokee, HONKING for another

car to get a move on.

A HAND AND A COIN MOVING ACROSS IT, from finger to finger.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

BUSTER, sitting by the front window of his office, reading

The Rocky Mountain Gazette.

He watches idly as ANNIE yells out the window to the car in

front of her. THE DRIVER of the car yells back. Annie yells

louder. The Driver guns off, and Annie pulls into the parking

space next to the General Store.

ANNIE, getting out, shaking a fist at the other car, calling

out, "You poop!" She enters the store.

BUSTER, staring straight ahead. Something is gnawing at him.

VIRGINIA, in his office, tidying the desk. BUSTER enters,

looks angry.

As BUSTER leaves, VIRGINIA goes back to tidying the desk.

A LARGE LIBRARY as Buster leaves his car, hurries inside and

LIBRARY STACKS

BUSTER, wearing bifocals, sits poring over bound volumes of

The Rocky Mountain Gazette.

BUSTER, frustrated, puts one set of volumes down, picks up

another, starts through it, as we

THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN GAZETTE, as the pages turn.

--only now they stop moving.

BUSTER, tense, adjusting his bifocals.

A SERIES OF HEADLINES pertaining to Annie Wilkes' murder

trial.

A HEADLINE which reads, "DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE."

Under a PICTURE OF ANNIE on the courthouse steps, we see a

CAPTION: "Wilkes told reporters on the courthouse steps,

'There is a higher justice than that of man; I will be judged

by Him.'"

BUSTER. He takes the 3 x 5 card out of his pocket.

The CARD--on it is printed the exact quote we just saw in

the paper.

BUSTER, sitting there, staring at the quote.

HOLD ON HIS FACE, then--

ANNIE, carrying a bag of feed, followed by MISERY, the sow,

comes into view. She slows, smiles, waves--

PAUL, staring out at her.

As she exits our view--

PAUL, lifting the typewriter and repeatedly raising it over

his head, this time without any difficulty.

THE GENERAL STORE IN SILVER CREEK. EARLY AFTERNOON.

BUSTER enters. The place is empty. It's one of those wonderful

spots that stocks pretty much everything in what seems like

complete disarray. Buster goes to the coffee urn behind the

counter, helps himself. He speaks to the guy who sits behind

the counter nearby; these two have known each other forever.

BUSTER opens the cash register, drops his coffee money inside,

closes the register.

BUSTER: CLOSE UP

He cannot hide his excitement now as we--

ANNIE, entering Paul's room. He lies back in the wheelchair,

eyes closed. Liberace music playing in the background. From

the start, PAUL'S TONE is different--strong, he's in control.

As she exits.

A ROAD. Empty. Hold for a moment--now a car appears around a

curve.

THE CAR. BUSTER is driving fast.

PAUL in his room. He sits as before, by the window. He doesn't

move. Now he closes his eyes, stretches, sighs as we

THE KITCHEN

ANNIE, busily making cocoa.

BUSTER IN HIS CAR. He stops at a mailbox. The name on the

box is WILKES. Buster turns his car slowly into the driveway

by the mailbox.

PAUL. He yawns, opens his eyes briefly. Closes them. In the

distance now, growing more and more visible is Buster's car--

--and now PAUL'S EYES go open wide, and he's staring out the

window at the car as it keeps on coming, closer, closer and

BUSTER, looking around. He's driving very slowly, carefully.

PAUL. Fixating on the window and now it's all going to be

all right, everything's going to be all right--

--and then ANNIE is on him, hypodermic needle in hand, jabbing

it into his arm. He desperately tries to fight her off, but

the drug starts to take hold. He tries to grab her by the

neck, but she fights him off as she wheels him out of the

room, down the hall and towards the cellar door.

ANNIE opens the cellar door. PAUL is all but limp by now. As

she picks him up and starts to carry him down the steps--

BUSTER pulling up in front of the house. As he gets out of

his car--

ANNIE placing Paul on the cellar floor and heading up the

stairs. PAUL is out.

BUSTER heading up the steps to the front door.

ANNIE stashing the wheelchair in the hall closet. She crosses

to the front door, opens it, revealing BUSTER.

ANNIE. The words pour out--

BUSTER, watching her, surprised.

ANNIE lets BUSTER in, closes the door. They linger in front

of Paul's door. Buster idly checks out the hallway.

BUSTER nods and wanders into the living room. ANNIE follows.

He crosses into the study and checks out a bookcase that

contains the complete works of Paul Sheldon. One shelf below

contains Annie's infamous scrapbook.

CUT TO:

ANNIE. She's so moved. Buster wanders into the kitchen.

BUSTER, watching her. This isn't at all what he expected.

PAUL, trying to fight the drug; just his eyes flutter.

ANNIE and BUSTER heading back down the hallway toward Paul's

room.

BUSTER enters Paul's room. ANNIE follows.

BUSTER takes a look in the bathroom. ANNIE waits for him.

BUSTER. He just stands there, watches her.

As she exits into the kitchen.

BUSTER lingers in Paul's room for a beat, then goes into the

hallway.

As Buster moves up the stairs--

PAUL, still fighting the drug. His arm twitches almost

involuntarily, grazing the barbecue.

BUSTER opening the door to Annie's room. He looks around and

just as he is about to turn to leave--

ANNIE, standing right in front of him.

BUSTER heads down the stairs, ANNIE follows.

They cross to the front door.

BUSTER opens the door.

PAUL stirring.

BUSTER and ANNIE at the door.

With that, she closes the door. We stay with BUSTER. He stands

on the front porch for a beat, thinking, then starts heading

down the porch steps. Just as he reaches about halfway down,

we HEAR A LOUD CRASH coming from inside the house.

PAUL--he has managed to partially fight his way through the

drug, and in waking has accidentally knocked over the

barbecue. He fights to clear the cobwebs.

There is no answer. He quietly moves into the house.

Again, no answer.

PAUL, still fighting to gain complete consciousness.

BUSTER. Hearing Paul's muffled call for help, he tracks the

sound to the cellar door. As PAUL continues to call out,

Buster looks around, sees no one, and opens the cellar door.

The shaft of light from the open door pours down on Paul,

who is still lying on the floor.

But before Paul can answer, there's the sound of a LOUD

EXPLOSION. Seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through

Buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing Annie,

smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar

steps.

ANNIE walks toward BUSTER'S BODY and very casually takes his

gun out of its holster.

With that, ANNIE turns and exits the cellar.

Paul's mind races desperately. He looks at the barbecue again.

Next to it is a messy table with a dozen jars and cans on

it.

THE TABLE. One of the cans is LIGHTER FLUID.

PAUL. He stares at it for a moment. An idea hits him--

--now, PAUL struggles and crawls over to the table. He grabs

the lighter fluid in his hands, jams it into the rear of his

pants and scrambles back to where ANNIE left him.

ANNIE returning with her .38 Special and a hypodermic needle.

She stops at the top of the stairs.

She starts toward him.

ANNIE stares at Paul. She could go either way on this. Then,

without a word, she turns and goes back up the stairs.

She exits. PAUL hesitates for a moment, then realizes he has

no choice. He starts dragging himself over BUSTER and up the

stairs.

PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT.

PAUL working. Typing like a madman, totally concentrated on

the white paper. His lips move but he's not even aware of

it.

ANNIE enters quietly, holding a few pages.

She looks at him now, enthralled.

He taunts her with it.

She takes the pages and goes.

PAUL'S ROOM. LATER.

PAUL types a moment then rips out the page and starts over.

ANNIE, putting the coffee down for him, putting the pages

back on the main pile.

He hands her a few more pages, she starts reading as she

exits.

PAUL'S ROOM. MUCH LATER.

PAUL rubs his eyes. For a moment, he sags, but he fights it.

He puts a clean page into the typewriter.

ANNIE bursts in.

AS ANNIE exits.

THE WINDOW

The first light of morning is starting to break through.

PAUL, stretching. He makes sure everything is set.

With that, she enters.

She exits; PAUL adjusts the manuscript on the table and then

types the last line.

ANNIE IN THE KITCHEN. She takes the bottle of Dom Perignon

out of the icebox, places it on a tray with two glasses--

opens a drawer--takes out the gun--places it in her pocket--

then takes out the hypodermic needle and places it on the

tray.

PAUL'S ROOM

ANNIE enters with the tray. She sets it down on the table.

He takes the last page out of the typewriter.

As soon as she exits, PAUL drops the manuscript to the floor,

pulls the lighter fluid from his pants, and starts dousing

the manuscript with lighter fluid. He grabs the last chapter

and twists the last few pages together torch style. He douses

it with the fluid and holds the match out of sight.

He smiles as we

ANNIE entering with the second glass...

THE MATCH, as he strikes it and

ANNIE screaming--

And as her hands fly out beseechingly--

THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE--it falls to the floor, explodes like a

torpedo, shards of glass all over, curds of foam everywhere--

And on that--

THE LAST CHAPTER as Paul brings the match close to it and it

bursts into flame. And Paul, holding it like the torch it

is. Annie starts moving forward now.

He drops the last chapter into the soaked manuscript and

THE MANUSCRIPT, as KABOOM!, it bursts into flame and--

ANNIE, transfixed by the sight for a moment,

--and then she charges.

THE FIRE as ANNIE rushes to the book, stoops down, grabs it

with both hands, brings the burning mass up to her body,

both arms across it, trying to smother the flames--

PAUL, grabbing the typewriter, raising it high above his

head, then throwing it down on her with all his power and

THE TYPEWRITER, crashing into the back of her head.

ANNIE, screaming, driven to the floor by the blow, the book

beneath her, and the flames fly up, her sweater is starting

to burn and she's covered with shards of glass from the

shattered bottle of champagne and some of the manuscript is

hissing from the liquid, but she is able to struggle to her

knees--

As she struggles to her feet, she pulls out the gun and shoots

at Paul, hitting him in the shoulder. Just as she's about to

shoot again, Paul quickly wheels the chair up to her, throws

himself out of the chair, and tackles her. The gun flies out

of her hand and lands in the hallway, going off as it lands.

They wrestle on the floor.

Flames still around them, PAUL gets on top of her, grabs

some burning pages, stuffs them into her mouth, shouting --

And as he forces more paper into her mouth--

ANNIE, and she's hideous--blistered, her hands claw at her

throat. She makes horrible sounds, spitting the charred chunks

of manuscript out of her mouth. Shards of glass are in her

hair. Now a shriek and a tremendous jerk of her body and

PAUL, falling away --

ANNIE, still making the sounds as she gets to her feet, and

PAUL, trying to crawl away after her.

ANNIE--heading for the door, she takes a step away from Paul,

then another, then

PAUL, suddenly kicking out with his shattered leg, screaming

in pain as it crashes into her ankle and

ANNIE, trying to keep her balance, not doing well, her arms

windmilling as she fights for balance one last moment, fights

and loses, and now, as she topples over--

THE TYPEWRITER as she falls and her head slams into it,

collides with the sharp metal and a great wound opens in her

head. There is one final cry. Blood pours. It's over. All

over. We are looking at a dead body.

PAUL, exhausted, panting, lying there, trying to gather his

energy. He starts to crawl for the door. Just as he reaches

the doorjamb, an arm grabs his leg, and

PAUL, shrieking, and

ANNIE, pulling herself up his body and

PAUL, trying to buck her off, but he can't and

ANNIE, the stronger, relentless, moving up on him, and

PAUL, his grip broken as he turns and

ANNIE, all-powerful, looming over him and

PAUL, hitting up at her and

ANNIE, swelling, and the blood pours down and if she feels

his blows she doesn't show it and

PAUL, whatever energy he has left he uses now, trying to

twist and strike and as his body moves--

METAL BASED FLOOR LAMP and

PAUL, grabbing the thing, suddenly bringing it across his

body, clobbering Annie in the face and

ANNIE, startled by the power of the blow and for a moment

she is stopped and

PAUL, as with everything he has left, he crunches her forehead

with the sharp heavy metal base, just creams her as the air

is forced out of her--

ANNIE. Her eyes roll up into her head. For a moment all we

see are the whites--

--then she collapses on PAUL, a motionless mountain of slack

flesh.

PAUL, scrambling free, pushing her off him, crawling for the

door--

--outside the door, as PAUL crawls into view, makes it to

the corridor, reaches back, closes the door, locks it.

Safe, he collapses, exhausted against the wall opposite the

door.

PAUL. HOURS LATER. It is dawn. He is awakened by a loud

smashing at the front door. After a couple of heart-stopping

pounds,

THE FRONT DOOR smashes open, revealing two cops with guns

drawn.

THE POLICEMEN, hurrying to PAUL. The YOUNGER COP kneels beside

Paul.

The OLDER COP, taking the key to the room, unlocks the door,

throws it open, and as he steps inside--

INSIDE THE BEDROOM

The OLDER COP has his gun ready to fire, but even with it

tight in his hand, he's edgy as hell.

He looks around--

--glass and bloodstains on the floor. The charred remains of

a manuscript.

He kneels quickly, glances under the bed--nothing.

He looks at the window--wide open.

PAUL and the YOUNGER COP. Pause. The OLDER COP is in the

doorway now.

PAUL: CLOSE UP. In shock.

PALM COURT, PLAZA HOTEL

This legend appears: ONE YEAR LATER

MARCIA SINDELL is seated at a table. PAUL enters, walking

briskly, and he's never looked this good before. He's gained

his weight back, his color is normal again. He appears to

be, for the first time in the movie, a jaunty, happy figure.

And she hands him a wrapped package. PAUL sits, begins

unwrapping it. It's a book. A new one by Paul Sheldon. The

Higher Education of J. Phillip Stone. Paul turns it over

gently in his hands.

SINDELL

PAUL: CLOSE UP. There is a genuine sense of peace about him.

He has been through the fire and survived.

As Paul glances around...

PAUL, looking past MARCIA.

DESSERT TROLLEY, some distance away, being pushed by a

waitress. It is ANNIE.

PAUL AND SINDELL

He glances toward the trolley.

THE DESSERT TROLLEY, moving inexorably closer to PAUL. ANNIE

reaches down and pulls out a very sharp knife.

PAUL AND SINDELL

ANNIE, with the knife raised.

PAUL, staring up at ANNIE.

PAUL AND ANNIE--only it isn't Annie, just a WAITRESS. She

stands by the trolley, the knife in her hand, ready to slice

whatever anyone wants.

PAUL. The smile holds. In the background now, soft music:

someone might be playing "Liberace."

HOLD ON PAUL
