A MAN'S HAND

unwinds a short length of green string. We're extremely

close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first

moments after a dream -- just fragments.

Scissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left

wrist. A loop. A bracelet.

We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the

knot tight.

His fingers pull against the string.   Solid.   It won't break

easily.

PITCH BLACK

There's no music. No sound at all, really, except for some

distant birds CHIRPING.

Then a SQUEAK.   A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage.

A GARAGE DOOR LIFTS,

revealing GARY BANKS in silhouette. He's 30, effortlessly

fit, with movie-star good looks. (Although for now, he's

merely a TV star.)

Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a

car. Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of

bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam

snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running.

Gary spots what he was looking for.

EXT. BACK PATIO / LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR (DAWN)

Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is

broken, SCRAPING against the deck.

WIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the

city. He couldn't fucking care less.

He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it

down the canyon.

He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's

clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in

their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping

it down with a flip-flopped foot.

He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins

drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container

is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really

empty.

Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying.   And

spraying.

We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of

Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making

her unrecognizable.

Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream,

soaking into the wooden deck.

Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He

takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his

pocket.

EXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES, erupting in flames.

On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet.

MUSIC STARTS: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us

through these MAIN TITLES.

In EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails

through the air, tumbling end-over-end.

Just as it's about to reach its target, we...

A DIGITAL METER

shoots to 100 miles per gallon.   It's the display of Gary's

Prius. We are...

INT. THE PRIUS - DAY

Gary's at the wheel, driving, as he finishes a fifth of

bourbon. JUMP CUTS take us out of Hollywood, heading

downtown. Our TRAVELLING MUSIC is serving us well.

Gary stops at a light. He looks left and sees himself on the

side of a bus. It's an ad for CRIME LAB ("This fall, Mondays

are killer.") Gary watches himself drive away.

low wall. He calls out to them:

The boys look wary.

QUICK CUTS:

Money changes hands.

Gary holds a small ziplock bag -- and has no idea what to do

with its lumpy beige contents.

HOLLYWOOD.

Gary pulls up to a curb. He's now on Sunset Blvd. A

matronly black streetwalker (OCTAVIA, 35) approaches the

passenger window.

Gary holds up the little bag.

She takes a closer look.

INT. SHITTY MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Gary and Octavia jump up and down on the bed, each trying to

bounce higher than the other, LAUGHING all the while.

Gary bounces so high that he THUNKS his head against the

ceiling. He crumples, falling off the bed. But he's still

laughing.

LATER, Octavia is sleeping.

INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

Gary takes a shower with his jeans on.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Toweling off, Gary looks at his body in the mirror. He

notices something odd. He tries to wake Octavia up, but

she's down for the count.

Looking around, he finds his cell phone. Dials 911. Pacing,

he tries to sober up while it rings. The far side answers.

He sits down on the edge of the bed.

A beat.

A beat.

He hangs up.

Noticing something to her right...

She hangs up, wrapping the earpiece around her phone.   We

reveal

GARY

being escorted through glass doors by a polo-shirted PAROLE

OFFICER. Margaret moves to intercept them, offering a hand.

INT. BACK HALLWAY - DAY

Margaret leads the way.      She's been here before.

A phone RINGS.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

A designer kitchen in Hancock Park -- spacious and kosher-

ready. The phone on the counter is RINGING.

Gary picks it up.

He looks to Margaret while the other end of the call talks at

length. Then, very deliberately...

He says this like a sleeper agent repeating his trigger

phrase.

The Parole Officer takes the phone from him, punching in a

series of numbers and jotting notes on his work sheet.

Catching the officer's concerned look...

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Margaret pulls open curtains, flooding the room with light.

Gary wanders, checking it all out.

Noticing two crates...

He lies back on it, feeling it out.

She massages his besocked feet.

Gary looks over his toes at Margaret. From this angle, she

looks a bit like Kathy Bates from Misery.

A long beat.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Margaret boxes up the alcohol while Gary bounces a lime on

the island.

Margaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone.

He hands over his cell phone.   She drops it in the contraband

box.

She picks up the liquor box, ready to go.

As she leaves, Margaret notices a long butane lighter by the

stove. She adds it to the box, just to be sure.

INT. HOUSE / VARIOUS - DAY

Gary paces around his new home, trying to get a feel for it.

He plays a few NOTES on the piano.

He looks up at the painting over the staircase:    a cliff near

the ocean.

He opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet, wondering

if there's anything hidden in one of the 46 slots. There

isn't.

He takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the

dining room, which show the same thing in three different

ways.

EXT. BACKYARD - SUMMER NIGHT

Gary swims laps, trying to exhaust himself.

He stands in the shallow end, listening to the quiet.

INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT

Wearing a fluffy white robe, he looks through the delivery

menus.

INT. FOYER / FRONT DOOR - SUMMER NIGHT

He takes a bag of food from a college-age DELIVERY GUY, who

seems to recognize him. Gary pays him, shuts the door.

As he's walking to the kitchen with the food, Gary looks back

and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk.

The guy is a little embarrassed, but Gary is pretty used to

being stared at.

INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT

Gary unwraps the Thai food.   Makes himself a plate.

He watches CRIME LAB on the plasma screen while eating

dinner.

INT. LIBRARY / TV ROOM - NIGHT

Gary scans the shelves, looking for something to read. There

are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his

lifetime.

He settles on a paperback of Voltaire's Candide.

He lies back on the couch, reading it.

He flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more

interesting. A beat.

GARY JACKING OFF

to soft-core pay-per-view. We're CLOSE ON Gary's straining

face, but we can hear the pleasured MOANS of the actresses as

they go down on each other.

Nearing climax, he looks for something to come on.     He can't

find anything.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

His left hand cupped to hold the semen, he pads barefoot from

the TV room to the downstairs bathroom. We hear WATER

RUNNING as he washes his hands. Then it shuts off.

We hear a THUNK.   Something hard was dropped on the wood

floor.

Gary hears it too.

He steps out of the bathroom, looks around. He takes a few

silent paces back in our direction, stopping just before he

reaches the two-story section of the foyer.

That's when he hears it: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the

wooden floor. A JINGLE of metal.

We follow Gary's eyes up to the second-floor walkway.   We can

hear the little FOOTSTEPS, toe nails CLICKING. Faint

PANTING. But there's no dog.

BACK ON Gary, increasingly unsettled. He's directly below

the walkway, and can't see up into it.

He CLAPS his hands twice.   Listens.

Nothing.

He's about to venture a step forward when suddenly

THE PHONE RINGS.

He nearly jumps out of his skin. It RINGS two more times

before he ducks into the TV room to answer it.

He turns his back to the foyer, listening to the instructions

on the phone.

His identity evidently confirmed, he hangs up.   He looks back

into the foyer.

EXT. UPSTAIRS DECK - DAY

Margaret's brought coffee and pastries from Susina.

He's obviously not convinced.

He nods.   He gets it.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Gary is lying in the sun, eyes shut.   Suddenly, a golf ball

hits him on the head.

He sits up, perplexed. For a long moment, he has no idea

where the ball came from, until he hears a voice from beyond

the wall that separates the properties.

(A practiced ear notices a Canadian accent.)

He follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner

of the yard, finding SARAH GLEASON. Late 30's, fresh-

scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really

is.

Indeed, she's holding a putter.

She picks up the baby monitor, heading back into her house.

Suddenly, she realizes...

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Gary brushes his teeth and tongue.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Gary neatens up, tossing out newspapers and delivery boxes.

He plumps pillows.

He looks up at the clock:      2:30.

He sits, trying to read Candide again.     He fidgets.

He looks at the clock again:     2:49.

EXT. BACK PATIO - DAY

Under the pretense of sweeping up leaves, he peers over the

wall, looking directly into Sarah's kitchen. But there's no

one in there.

OMIT

INT. UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - DAY

Gary carefully sets rat traps, staggering them every few

feet.

He pokes one with a pencil.   The metal arm SNAPS back,

breaking the pencil in two.

INT. FOYER - DAY

Gary notices that the piano has an electronic device attached

to it. He turns it on.

He opens the piano bench, finding computer disks. A red disk

is labelled "Knowing." He puts it in. Hits play.

The piano begins playing by itself, a sensuous but melancholy

CLASSICAL PIECE.

Gary lies on the floor, listening to it.   He stares up at the

elaborate chandelier.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

Gary is sitting on a bench by the front walk, trying to read

more of his book. He looks over to see Sarah coming up the

steps, carrying the baby monitor and a bottle of chardonnay.

She stops beside him.

He gets up.

She hands him the wine.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Sarah tops off Gary's wine glass. They're both on the couch.

The baby monitor is sitting on the table behind them.

A long beat while she decides whether she wants to tell him

the story.

INT.   SARAH'S BATHROOM - DAY [MONOLOGUE]

Sarah leans up to the mirror, trying to get her contacts in.

It's not going well. Her eyes are tearing up.

INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY

Sarah and Gary start to dance.

INT. ANTIQUE HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Deep in the bowels of the store, Sarah is surrounded by

vintage lighting fixtures. She's (futilely) trying to match

a specific light switch plate.

TO CAMERA:

INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY

Sarah and Gary become more intimately acquainted on the

couch. They still haven't kissed, but hands are running up

and down over clothing. Sarah isn't singing anymore, though

her voice continues.

Just as they're about to kiss,

A BABY HOWLS.

It's the monitor, HISSING and POPPING as Jaden wakes up from

her nap, cranky and hungry. Sarah pushes back. Gary tries

to close the gap, but she's already standing up.

As she reaches for one, she knocks over a wine glass.

Carrying both her shoes, she's across the room and out the

front door before he can say anything more.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Gary washes the wine glasses, being sure to wash off any

trace of lipstick. He dries them and puts them back in the

cabinet.

Faced with the remainder of the wine, he considers dumping it

down the sink. Instead, he chugs it from the bottle.

He wraps the empty bottle in newspaper and tucks it in the

recycling.

OMIT

INT. OFFICE / GYM - SUMMER NIGHT

Gary works out hard on the elliptical trainer.    He has his

iPod cranked with a POUNDING TUNE.

He does abs on a stability ball.   He's spent.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Gary enters from the driveway door, gulping from a water

bottle. He starts to look through the delivery menus when he

notices an orange Post-It note by the telephone. It reads:

He picks it up, looks at the back.   Nothing.    Sticks it back

down on the counter.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Gary sits on the couch with his water bottle, listening to

the baby monitor: Sarah is singing a LULLABY. He takes off

his shoes and socks. When she's finished...

For a long beat, it's quiet.   Then we hear RUSTLING.

A crib toy plays a short MELODY.   Then a slightly-digital

voice speaks:

Gary smiles to himself.

Evidently, Jaden loves the cow.

The parole officer smiles.

The parole officer hits a test button on the anklet, which

lets out a PIERCING ALARM.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

Margaret walks heel-to-toe, counting her steps.

With a piece of chalk, she draws a line on the concrete.    She

looks back to Gary, who's waiting by the front door.

She starts doing the running man over the line.   Even Gary's

dark mood is broken.

OMIT

EXT. BACK PATIO - NIGHT

Margaret and Gary roast marshmallows over the propane grill

to make s'mores. They're giggling.

Margaret is confused.

Margaret laughs so hard she coughs.

INT. UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - NIGHT

Ready for bed, Margaret leans out the guest bedroom door.

Gary looks out his door.

Both doors shut.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Establishing.

EXT. BACK PATIO - DAY

Margaret and Gary sip their morning beverages, looking at

something spectacular in the yard.

We REVERSE to see the object of their awe: a giant

inflatable jump-o-rama in the shape of a castle.

INT. THE CASTLE - DAY

VARIOUS SHOTS: Gary and Margaret jump with all their might,

bouncing off the walls, SCREAMING all the time.

When both finally collapse, it becomes strangely tranquil.

They're safe inside an inflatable paradise.

Gary scoots over beside Margaret.     She puts her head on his

arms. It's nice.

Prelap:   A doorbell RINGS.

INT.   FOYER - DAY

Gary opens the door to find Sarah.

She walks past him, into the house.

INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY [CONTINUOUS]

Sarah crosses to the couch, picking up the baby monitor.

There's an edge to her voice.

She's headed back for the door.

With that, she's gone.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Gary is trying to load dishes into the dishwasher, but has a

hard time getting one bowl to fit.

He looks over.    Margaret holds up the orange sticky note by

the phone.

She puts it back down.    But she doesn't believe him.

EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

At the far edge of the property, Margaret and Gary play

backgammon. Their mood is significantly more subdued.

Margaret answers her RINGING cell phone.

He nods.   Margaret starts walking back to the house.

Left alone, Gary rolls the dice idly. He gets a 4 and a 5.

Rolls again. 4,5. 3,6. 4,5. 3,6. 3,6. 3,6. 4,5.

He keeps rolling, the wheels in his head starting to turn.

EXT.   FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

Sarah is looking in through the living room windows, trying

to spot Gary. Giving up, she turns back to the main steps,

only to find...

MARGARET,

who doesn't look pleased.

Margaret lets that go unanswered.   There's obviously

something big we're not privy to.

She's forgotten Margaret's name -- if she ever knew it.

MARGARET

enters, carrying her tea. She sees Gary by himself, leaning

near the bars of the trellis.

WIDER,

we see that Sarah is flush back against the wall, out of

Margaret's line of sight.

She turns and heads back into the house.    Once she's out of

earshot...

INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY [A FEW MINUTES LATER]

CLOSE ON a white plastic device mounted in the corner of the

room, about ten feet up. It might be a smoke detector.

Gary stares up at it, intently.    He steps forward.

A little red light flicks on inside the unit. After a few

seconds it turns off. It's some sort of motion detector.

Gary tests it again, trying to move his arm slowly enough

that the light never engages.

She sits forward in her chair.    By instinct, he sits back.

NEW ANGLE (TIME JUMP)

Gary gets up, headed for the front door.

But he's already outside.

EXT.   FRONT WALKWAY - DAY

He's walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line, headed

for Sarah's house.

Leaves fall lazily from the trees, counter-point to the

tension.

Margaret calls out from the arched windows.

She's almost at tears.   He stops at the edge of the chalk

line.

The tear in her eye falls.

He very deliberately steps over the line. We hear a thin

BEEPING from the house-arrest anklet. He shoots her a look

to say, is that all there is?

But the BEEPING grows louder, deeper. It starts to come from

all sides, booming, a nuclear-meltdown/self-destruct-sequence-

activated DRONE.

Gary suddenly realizes something very, very terrible is about

to happen.

Melissa giggles.

INT.    TESTING SERVICE THEATRE - DAY

A MODERATOR explains how it all works to the RECRUITED AUDIENCE.

The test begins.

ANGLE ON a monitor.         We see a scene of Melissa (as "Mary") on

a forest road.

INT.    TESTING SERVICE / FOCUS GROUP ROOM - DAY

Through a one-way mirror, Gavin and Susan watch as the

Moderator asks a group of twelve MALE VIEWERS about the pilot

they just watched.

Their comments are mostly positive. Gavin and Susan share relieved looks. She has a

notepad, as always.

One AGITATED MAN keeps staring at the mirror, right at Gavin.

(We recognize him as the Parole Officer from Part One.)

As a test, Gavin waves his arm. The Agitated Man's

expression changes slightly, but it's not clear whether it's

in reaction or not.

The Moderator directs her next question to the Agitated Man.

He stands up, pushing past the other people to come right up

to the one-way glass. He stares directly at Gavin, even

though he shouldn't be able to see him.

He SHOUTS:

Gavin backs away from the glass, freaked out.

EXT. STREET - [LATER THAT] DAY

Impromptu INTERVIEW with Gavin, standing beside his Prius.

He's clearly still shaken by the experience.

Gavin sounds like he's trying to convince himself.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Gavin hosts a game night: good friends and lots of

cocktails. The guests include Melissa and Susan, along with

SAM, TOM, BRUCE, DANA, JON, KEVIN, JEFF, DAN, and CARL. (We

don't show anyone's names.)

They're playing Celebrity. We go several rounds, keeping the best of what's said.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Between rounds of Celebrity, party-goers mingle. Gavin is

making a new batch of cocktails -- he obviously has a knack

for it.

Susan pours herself another glass of chardonnay.

Melissa reaches in, grabbing the vodka.

She makes a quick Cape Cod.            From the other room, Sam YELLS:

She gives him a quick peck, then dashes off with Sam's drink.

He SHAKES the mixer.

Gavin pours.

Melissa YELLS from the living room:

Making his way back to the living room, he stops by the

phone. Pulls out an orange Post-It and makes a note.

As he leaves, we go in CLOSE to read it:

INT. CONFERENCE HALLWAY - DAY

Susan is on her cell phone. A cocktail party is in full

swing nearby. We can hear the DIN and MUSIC, and see the

occasional GUEST looking for the restrooms.

In the background, we see Gavin approaching. Susan spots him

and seizes up a bit. She holds up a one-sec finger to him as

she continues her conversation.

She hangs up. They look each other in the eye, daring each

other to go first.

He suddenly punches her, one hit to the face.   She drops

hard.

Gavin takes a step back.

Tasting blood, Susan gets to her knees.   A wry smile.

In the background, we see partygoers responding to the blow.

Susan gets to her feet. She approaches Gavin, hands open.

She's not going to hit him.

She leans in very close to his ear.   There's a strange

intimacy between them.

She walks away.   CLOSE ON Gavin.

EXT. MANHATTAN SIDEWALK - DAY

We move with Gavin as he walks. He's trying to get away from

the camera, but it keeps following him.

He reaches a crosswalk. He has to wait for the light.

Finally, he looks INTO CAMERA:

TITLE OVER BLACK:

FADE IN:

EXT. MEADOW - DAY

In a WIDE SHOT, we see a vast field, bordered by green

mountains. Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees, while

insects CLICK and WHIRR.

In the distance, we spot swatches of bright colors moving our

way. It's a family: father GABRIEL (34), wife MARY (33) and

daughter NOELLE (8). They're returning from a short day

hike. Mary carries a small videocamera.

Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path...

Noelle turns around. Instead of speaking, she moves her

hands in sign language. (She's mute, not deaf.)

Noelle begs to differ.   More signing.

EXT. SMALL GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

The family walks up to their car, a blue Toyota Prius.

Gabriel sheds his daypack, trying to open the hatchback.    It

won't lift.

Mary goes to open the passenger door.      Locked.

A beat.

Half a beat, while each waits for the other to think of a

better plan. Neither does.

Gabriel leans down next to Noelle's window.

Noelle nods.

Gabriel gives Mary a quick peck and starts running down the

road.

We MOVE IN on Noelle, who smiles a little.

EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

Gravel CRUNCHES under Gabriel's shoes as he runs.    He keeps

an easy pace.

In VARIOUS SHOTS, we get a sense of the distance he's

travelling. He passes gulches, meadows and boulder fields.

He finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a

larger...

EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY [CONTINUOUS]

Pulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal.

By his reaction, it's still iffy.

He dials, but the call drops.    Tries again.   Just the same.

He looks left.   Looks right.    Looks back down the dirt road.

He decides to head off to the right, downhill.

EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY

We catch up to Gabriel as he's walking in the middle of the

road, still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal.

In the distance, he spots a patch of moving color: a female

hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her:

She stops, turns.

Gabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we

reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's "made a fresh

start" 12 times. In this incarnation, she's a wilderness-

loving, Bush-hating, wildly-overeducated clerk at Trader

Joe's in Venice.

She points in the opposite direction -- back the way he came.

Sierra backs away.

Once she feels she's reached a good distance, she turns and

keeps walking.

She doesn't turn back, heading down the road.

Mary is sitting in the back seat of the Prius with Noelle,

who's getting tired of her coloring book.

Noelle signs something to Mary, who considers the request.

Noelle nods. Mary hands her the small video camera. Noelle

has some trouble folding out the little screen, but

eventually gets it open without any help from her mom.

Noelle nods.

Mary takes the camera back for a second, flipping it to

playback mode and rewinding. The blocky video footage zips

past.

Noelle does. On the tiny screen, we see Noelle and her

father eating lunch by a waterfall. (Mary is filming.)

Noelle smiles.   Signs something.

EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY

Gabriel continues walking, headed back in the direction he

came. From behind him...

He turns, finding her a ways back.   She approaches.

She smiles.

They shake.

She points off the road, through the forest.

She does. They cross off the pavement, descending into a

dark forest.

EXT.   FOREST - DAY

Gabriel walks with Sierra. The trees here are taller,

creating a cathedral-like ceiling above them.

EXT. ROAD NEAR PRIUS - DAY

Mary is pacing -- but trying not to look like she's pacing.

She holds the other cell phone (Gabriel's), which she turns

on and off, hoping that somehow she'll get a signal.

Each time she turns it on, we hear the CHIMES.

IN THE PRIUS

Noelle is still playing with the video camera, watching

footage of the hike. She decides to wind back further.

CLOSE ON the blocky pixels rushing past.

Noelle hits "play."   For now, we just hear the audio.

We reveal the screen. We're watching the argument between

Gavin and Melissa from Part 2.

Confused, Noelle looks out at her mother, Mary, who is still

pacing with the cell phone.

Noelle REWINDS further.    Blocky pixels RUSH PAST as we...

EXT.   FOREST - DAY

Sierra continues to lead the way. She seems confident where

she's headed, even though there's no real path.

During the conversation, we notice a small tattoo on her

right shoulder blade: IX.

He's surprised.    He could have sworn her name was Sarah.

She smiles, keeps walking.

EXT. ROAD / INT. PRIUS - DAY

Mary sits down in the front passenger seat of the car.

Noelle is still in back, watching footage on the video

camera.

Noelle doesn't look up.

Without looking up...

Mary is stunned. For her part, Noelle seems to have no idea

she just spoke her first words.

We hear three evenly-spaced BEEPS.    After the third one, Mary

says:

Mary flinches.    It's like someone walked over her grave.

Noelle hands her the camera. The footage is cued to earlier

in Part 2, where Gavin is having Melissa loop in a wild line:

Mary backs out of the car, as if trying to get away from the

video camera. But she's still holding it.

She hits STOP.   Tries to collect herself.

Noelle gets out of the car, but doesn't approach.      She signs,

"Mommy?"

Mary backs away.

EXT.   FOREST VALE - DAY

Gabriel and Sierra stop for a moment, so he can pull off his

outer shirt. For the first time, we see that Gabriel has a

large tattoo on his back which looks like this:

He's sweating a lot.

She hands him back the water bottle.   He gladly drinks.

When she takes the bottle back, she steps forward. The

motion leaves them face-to-face. She pauses for a moment,

just long enough for him to turn away.

He doesn't.

She kisses him. He doesn't really kiss back -- but he

doesn't fight it, either.

She puts a hand on his thigh, sliding up the inside.     Only

when she reaches his crotch does he pull back.

Gabriel turns, trying to get his bearing.      The trees BLUR.

He nearly falls over.

He manages to steady himself.

Wobbling, Gabriel sits down on a stump.   Sierra kneels down

in front of him.

She holds up the water bottle.

QUICK FLASHBACKS FROM PARTS ONE AND TWO

EXT.   FOREST - DAY

Gabriel experienced the flashbacks.   He felt time move.

FLASHBACK SEQUENCE.

Images to accompany previous dialogue...

EXT.   FOREST - DAY

Gabriel dry-heaves.   Sierra rubs his shoulders.

She's genuinely empathetic -- she doesn't enjoy his

suffering.

She comes around to face him. And now we see they're not

alone. Two other familiar faces approach:

THE PAROLE OFFICER/AGITATED MAN, and

OCTAVIA.

EXT.   FOREST ROAD - DAY

The Prius drives down the gravel road. Mary tries to keep

her eyes on the scenery, but they keep drifting over to

Gabriel, trying to read what he's thinking.

EXT.   CROSSROADS - DAY

The Prius turns on to the paved road.   Headlights switch on.

EXT.   HOUSE - NIGHT

The metal gate at the top of the driveway swings open,

SQUEALING on its rusty hinges.

EXT.   DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Gabriel lifts the sleeping Noelle out of the car. Carries

her into the house. Mary shuts the door behind them.

INT.   NOELLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Taking off her shoes, Gabriel tucks Noelle into bed.   Turns

on a nightlight for her.

INT.   MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Gabriel brushes his teeth with an electric toothbrush while

Mary reads a magazine on the toilet.

INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gabriel switches off the light. He spoons Mary, who kisses

his hand. On both Mary and Gabriel's faces, we see anxiety.

Things left unsaid.

INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT [LATER]

Gabriel lies awake, staring at the ceiling.

INT.   STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Gabriel's bare feet walk down the carpeted stairs.

INT.   DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Gabriel stares at the three paintings on the wall.

INT.   KITCHEN / EXT.   BACK YARD - DAWN

Gabriel stands in the doorway, looking out at the inky-blue

sky. His eyes are red, tired. He hasn't slept at all.

It's very quiet, except for the occasional precocious BIRD

CALL.

Mary enters from the living room, still in her pajamas.   He

knows she's there. Neither wants to speak.

He smiles, a little.

Both smile.

EXT.   LOS ANGELES - DAY

As the light flies out over Hancock Park, the mansions and

skyscrapers seem unreal, like models.

Reaching Santa Monica, we pass over the ferris wheel at the

end of the pier.

We dive into the blue ocean beneath us, which becomes only a

swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness.

We see three lights in the distance.    We join them, moving

with them.

Further ahead, more lights, circling. It's a loose spiral

made of stars, resembling nothing so much as the number 9.

As we get closer and closer, we...

A PALE EYE,

opening.    We are...

INT.     KITCHEN - MORNING

Hands reach up, expecting to find glasses, but there are

none.

As we PULL OUT, we reveal it's not Mary, Melissa or Margaret,

but a fourth person -- just slightly different from any of

them. We'll call her M.

She looks first to the spot where Gabriel was standing.

Empty.

M looks over at husband Ben, who is busy making pancakes,

reading from a recipe.

Coming around from behind Ben, Noelle checks through the

spice drawer. M watches her with cautious fascination.
