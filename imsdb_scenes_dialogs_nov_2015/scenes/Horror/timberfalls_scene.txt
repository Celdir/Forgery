Sheryl turns, as she does... Mike pinches her behind, she

playfully SHRIEKS, hustles away from him, but he pursues her,

as they both CRACK UP, they spill off the trail...

OFF THE PATH... Mike and Sheryl continue their horseplay,

when... SHERYL LOOKS DOWN, SCREAMS!

A BLOODY, MUTILATED FOX LAYS INSIDE A RUSTED BEAR TRAP. The

Steel jaws of the trap have sliced the body in two. The kill

looks fresh.

Mike and Sheryl head back to the path.

ANGLE ON - The MUTILATED, BLOODY FOX.

Mike and Sheryl hike over a small wooden bridge.

Mike and Sheryl reach a small clearing. There are a number of

signs pointing toward different trails. (Donner Trail, Willow

Creek Bridge, Timber Falls, etc.)

Sheryl grabs the map and some water. Mike swigs some water,

munches on trail mix, takes a peek in the guidebook.

Birds CHIRP overhead.     Sunlight streaks through the clouds.

ANGLE ON - A FINE CLOTH rubs delicately, but firmly one of

the fetus jars (Timothy).

Ida finishes, steps off the small stool.     The jars sparkle

and shine brightly.

She gazes at the fetus jars with love, affection. The pain

of lives unfulfilled weighing heavy on her strong shoulders.

The trap door opens, Clyde comes down the steps.

Ida turns to Clyde.     A beat...

The morning fog engulfs the mountains.

SAM, the Ranger that greeted Mike and Sheryl, enters sipping

a cup of coffee. EVELYN, 20s, a perky and adorable Ranger,

works at the desk.

Evelyn begins walking off.

Evelyn ignores Lonnie, moves on her way.

Brody watches her go.      As she disappears, he grabs his gun.

Clyde comes up to Ida. She stands over a bar-b-q pit, just

your run-of-the-ordinary backyard variety ones.

ANGLE ON - A GLASS JUG OF MOONSHINE

Ida flips open a silver lighter, SPARKS up a flame. She

touches the flame to a piece of kindling, drops it into the

bar-b-q.

A FIRE ROARS TO LIFE.

Ida lifts THREE IRON BRANDS from a long leather bag.   She

places the heads of the brands into the bar-b-q.

Sheryl sits alone, tied, gagged and confined to a chair on

the far end of the room.

CLOSE ON - Behind Sheryl's back. Her bloody hands, sans one

finger, tremble softly. Her remaining digits start to LOOSEN

her restraints.

Mike hangs, once again. Clyde stands before him, Ida enters.

She wheels the bar-b-q in the room.

IN THE PIT - It's filled with hot, smoking coals. Also,

THREE IRON BRANDS rest buried in the coals. All glow a FIERY

ORANGE.

But unlike previous moments, Mike is not begging or pleading.

He holds a calm demeanor.

Sheryl continues working the ropes, as... THE DOOR CREAKS

OPEN. Sheryl freezes, stops working the ropes.

Deacon enters, sickle in hand. He's calm and determined.      He

stares at Sheryl. Sinister thoughts in mind.

QUICK CUTS DEACON'S POV: Sheryl's mouth/ chest/ legs.

Deacon approaches Sheryl, kneels down in front of her. He

LAYS THE SICKLE ON THE FLOOR. Sheryl eyes the weapon.

Deacon takes something from his pocket, lifts his arms up

towards Sheryl's head.

She winces, expecting the worst.

Deacon slides Sheryl's locket around her neck.     The chain

repaired. Deacon beams with pride.

Deacon shifts her skirt exposing more skin and places his

hands on Sheryl's bare thighs. She twitches instinctively

causing Deacon to squeeze her thighs TIGHTER.

Sheryl winces in pain, stops her struggle. Locks EYES with

Deacon. Suddenly, an aura of CALM falls over her.

BEHIND SHERYL'S BACK... She resumes untying the knots.

Deacon savors every moment of Sheryl. Her smell, form. He

glides his hands up her body, past her stomach and onto her

breasts. He GROPES them, in his own heaven.

CLOSE ON - The knot loosens... almost there.

Ida ROTATES the brands in the bar-b-q, doing her best subtle

intimidation.

Ida grabs a brand, JABS IT ONTO MIKE'S CHEST.

MIKE SCREAMS. THE BRAND BURNS INTO HIS FLESH.     HIS EYES

BULGE. HE VOMITS.

Deacon TEARS open Sheryl's blouse, exposing her bra and more

cleavage. He slides his hands over her breasts... he's in

heaven. Sheryl doesn't resist because...

CLOSE ON - The knot's undone.   Her hands are free.

Deacon looks into Sheryl's eyes.    He senses something

different. Does he know?

Deacon pulls himself closer to Sheryl. Their faces only

inches apart. He PULLS her gag out of her mouth, lets it

dangle around her neck. Sheryl swallows nervously. Resists

the urge to scream. She's frozen. Then... Deacon leans

in... KISSES SHERYL.

Knowing it's now or never, Sheryl KNEES DEACON IN THE BALLS.

He falls over in agony.

Deacon looks up at her, when... SMACK! She KICKS him right

in the face. Sheryl springs from the chair, grabs the

sickle, turns and...

CRACK! Deacon, already back on his feet, PUNCHES Sheryl hard

across the jaw. She hits the wall, then falls to the floor,

drops the sickle.

ANGLE ON - A SMALL POCKET KNIFE falls off a shelf in the room

onto the floor.

Deacon grabs the sickle, then lifts her up BY HER HAIR and

drags her across the room.

He throws her face/stomach down on the table top, flips her

dress up onto her back. He slides the sickle between her ass

and underwear and... CUTS HER PANTIES OFF IN ONE QUICK

MOTION, SPREADS HER LEGS APART.

Sheryl, still stunned from the punch, only now starts to

realize what is happening to her.

She tries to wiggle off table or close her legs, but Deacon's

too strong. He grabs the back of her head, SLAMS it against

the table, pinning it in place. With the other hand, HE

SLIDES OFF HIS PANTS.

Mike, his chest scarred, bloody, from the fresh wound,

dangles helplessly. Vomit splashed down his body.

Clyde and Ida look to one another...

Deacon slaps his left hand over her mouth, climbs on top of

Sheryl using his weight to keep her in place. Deacon

positions himself for penetration, when...

Sheryl SCREAMS, but Deacon's hand muffles the cries.

With every ounce of strength left inside her, SHERYL BITES

DOWN ON DEACON'S HAND. He SCREAMS, falling off of her.

CLOSE ON DEACON'S HAND - blood oozes, a large piece looks

ripped out.

Sheryl SPITS the small chunk of his hand out of her mouth.

Deacon grabs the SICKLE/AXE, starts towards Sheryl...

At the top of her lungs, SHERYL LETS LOOSE A BLOOD CURDLING

SCREAM! And...

Ida bursts in the room...

Deacon turns to Ida, stops his attack on Sheryl.

Deacon slinks away. Sheryl curls up in a ball, emotions

consume her. She breaks down.

The Sun sinks on the horizon...

Sheryl's tied, once again, to the table. Mike tied to a

chair, which is dragged into the room by Clyde.

Sheryl sees Mike's burned chest.

Ida SLAPS Mike.

Ida digs her hand into Mike's bear trap wound, squeezes.    But

Mike doesn't scream or squirm. He endures the pain.

In that look, Ida knows Sheryl's telling the truth.

TEARS fill both their eyes.

Clyde grabs hold of Ida, tries to calm her down.        When...

OFF SCREEN: A GLASS BREAKS.    It came from upstairs.

IDA AND CLYDE SPRING INTO ACTION.     They exit the room, BOLT

THE DOOR LOCKED.

MIKE'S POV - THE POCKET KNIFE still on the floor.

Brody and Lonnie stand on the porch.      Brody holds a shotgun,

Lonnie a rifle.

Brody reaches inside the broken window, unlocks it.

Brody slides open the window.

Brody climbs inside.     Lonnie heads around the back.

Mike ROCKS his chair back and forth, building momentum...

Finally, the CHAIR tips over.

He uses his feet to push himself along.      Heading for THE

POCKETKNIFE.

Brody moves through cabin, shotgun ready.      All's calm, quiet.

Lonnie walks in the back yard...    Nothing here, except.

ON THE GROUND - Lonnie steps on patch of ground that's

different than the rest.

Lonnie peers curiously at the ground.     What's he found?

Brody enters... the Trap Door in the floor is open.      He

peers inside, then proceeds down.

Lonnie bends down, finds a handle. Lifts, REVEAL, A HIDDEN

TRAP DOOR ENTRANCE. Lonnie peers inside...

LONNIE'S POV - A dark staircase leads down.    At the bottom, a

wooden door, which is closed.

Mike hears this...

Lonnie takes a step down, when...

CLYDE APPEARS, BURIES AN AX INTO LONNIE'S HEAD.      LONNIE FALLS

INTO THE HOLE AND DOWN THE STAIRS!

His body crashes through the closed wooden door, into the

hallway.

MIKE'S POV - UNDER THE GAP BETWEEN THE FLOOR AND DOOR,

Lonnie's body lands. Eyes stare at Mike.

Brody stares at the FETUS JARS, "WHAT THE FUCK?"

THE IRON DOOR SWINGS OPEN... IDA, SHOTGUN IN HAND, BLASTS

BRODY IN THE CHEST. BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE WALLS.

The MOON hides behind some dark clouds.

A giant pile of dirt. The dead body of Brody sits inside the

makeshift grave. Ida pushes Lonnie's carcass in next.

Clyde watches Ida, concern in his eyes.

Ida and Clyde.   A sadness covers their faces, especially Ida.

Clyde nods.   They hug.

A CRACKLE OF LIGHTNING followed by a ROLL OF THUNDER.

Clyde hands her the shovel.      Ida nods, tosses a pile of dirt

into the grave.

Clyde walks down the hall, loads Ida's shotgun with a couple

fresh shells.

He unlocks, then pushes open the door to Torture Room #1.

Mike sits in the chair, exactly where he and Ida left him.

Mike's head sags, he appears to be sleeping.

Sheryl lies on the table, out cold.

Clyde levels the shotgun to Mike's head.     But something odd

catches Clyde's attention...

ON THE FLOOR - Behind Mike's chair, some rope shavings,

pieces.

Mike SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABS CLYDE PULLS HIM IN.

As Clyde falls into Mike's body.     The SHOTGUN FIRES

HARMLESSLY INTO THE GROUND.

Mike swings his hand around, PLUNGES the pocket knife into

Clyde's neck!

Clyde SCREAMS. The knife embedded in his neck.         He throws

his hands to it, stumbles backwards and falls.

Clyde tries to speak, but it comes out GURGLING and BLOODY.

Mike turns away.   Guilt etched on his face.

Sheryl concedes.   She goes to the ladder, stops... turns.

Mike looks at her.   They stare at one another.

Sheryl turns, ascends the ladder.

Sheryl exits the sewing room, enters...

Sheryl searches the bedroom for the walkie-talkie.

A FLASH OF LIGHTNING, illuminates... In the window, Deacon

appears.

Sheryl doesn't see Deacon.       She FINDS the walkie-talkie...

RAIN beats against the windows, pounds the roof. Evelyn,

with poncho, stands outside, just locking the door, when...

SHERYL... Lowers the walkie, waits for an answer.

EVELYN... stops. She heard something, but not sure exactly

what. She re-enters, heads over to the CB. Just as she

picks up the CB Mic...

DEACON, dripping wet, appears in doorway, lunges for Sheryl.

Sheryl screams, drops walk-talkie, as Deacon tackles her onto

the bed. The WALKIE-TALKIE BREAKS into pieces.

EVELYN... Pushes the "talk button" on the CB...

SHERYL AND DEACON... The headboard SLAMS against the wall,

causing a Crucifix to dislodge off a nail and fall onto the

pillow by Sheryl's head.

Mike hears Sheryl scream, realizes it must be Deacon.      He

lifts himself up using the wall as balance.

Deacon strangles Sheryl with one hand.

Sheryl's eyes BULGE out of her head, her face BEET RED.

Deacon raises the sickle/axe into the air with the other.

Sheryl's hand finds the Crucifix and JABS IT INTO DEACON'S

JAW. Deacon grabs for the cross, lets go of Sheryl rolls off

her, the bed and collapses to the floor.

Sheryl coughs, struggles for some air.      She climbs off the

bed, runs out of the room.

Mike enters, scours for a weapon.     Finds a MACHETE.

Deacon YANKS the Crucifix from his jaw.      BLOOD SQUIRTS, POURS

from the wound.

Sheryl runs in, screams down the trap door hole...

Mike exits room, passes Ida's lifeless body.     Trudges down

the hall. Each step painful.

Deacon enters. One hand covers his wound, the other holds

the sickle/axe.

Sheryl grabs a candlestick, uses it to defend herself.

Deacon swipes at her, but misses.

Sheryl cracks him across jaw with candlestick... he falls,

but GRABS ONTO SHERYL...

THEY BOTH FALL UNCONTROLLABLY DOWN THE TRAP DOOR STEPS,

into...

Sheryl and Deacon TUMBLE, CRASH into shelf wall with the

fetus jars. They wobble, shake, then...

THE ENTIRE SHELF WALL CRASHES ON TOP OF SHERYL AND DEACON.

The FETUS JARS BREAK, SPILL OUT EVERYWHERE.

The shelf wall BLOCKS the Iron Door from opening.

Mike looks up, hears the commotion.      It only quickens his

pace.

A path of blood left in Mike's wake.

Sheryl shakes the cobwebs free, opens her eyes, moves her

head slightly, just as...

SLAM. THE SICKLE BLADE SLAMS INTO THE WOODEN FLOOR AN INCH

AWAY FROM SHERYL'S HEAD.

Sheryl scrambles to her feet, when...

SQUISH. HER FOOT STEPS DOWN ON TOP OF THE SMALLEST FETUS.

PUSS AND MUCUS OOZE OUT.

Deacon tries to push the shelf off him.   It's heavy.   It

moves a little.

Sheryl limps up the trap door steps.

Mike pushes up against the Iron Door, but it doesn't move.

The shelf wall blocks it.

Sheryl races from the cabin.   RAIN POURING DOWN ON HER.     She

spies...

ANGLE ON - Moonshine jar, a lighter.    The ones Ida used

earlier.

Deacon pushes the shelves again, this time success.     He gets

to his feet, grabs his weapon.

Mike, with every ounce of strength left, PUSHES at the iron

door. It budges, just a little. He PUSHES again and,

finally, THE DOOR OPENS! Mike scrambles into the Chapel.

Deacon exits the cabin, steps off the porch. He peers into

the rain and the darkness of the woods surrounding the cabin.

No Sheryl anywhere.

Deacon turns, looks up...

ON THE PORCH ROOF...

Sheryl, a fresh tear in her dress, holds the SILVER LIGHTER

in one hand, the moonshine jar in the other. The Moonshine

jar has a torn length of her dress sticking out, a homemade

Molotov Cocktail. She glares down at Deacon, lights the

cocktail...

She drops it...

THE COCKTAIL HITS. THE FLAMES CONSUME DEACON, SPREAD QUICKLY

OVER HIS ENTIRE BODY.

Deacon flails wildly, trying to put out the flames, stumbles

forward, runs off towards the forest. He trips and falls

just as he enters.

SHERYL... the rain pouring down, stares at...

ANGLE ON - DEACON'S BURNING CORPSE lays in the thick brush.

Sheryl enters... Mike limps to her. He drops the machete,

collapses in her arms. They hug tightly.

ANGLE ON - A BLOODY HAND grabs a POKER from the fireplace.

Mike looks, across the room...

IN THE MIRROR'S REFLECTION - IDA, THE BLOODY MESS THAT SHE

IS, STEPS FROM THE SHADOWS, AN IRON FIRE POKER in her hands.

Mike pushes Sheryl to the couch, safely away just as...   IDA

STABS MIKE IN THE STOMACH WITH THE POKER.

SHERYL SCREAMS. SHE RUNS TOWARDS IDA, SICKLE/AXE IN TOW...

SHE SWINGS THE BLADE... IT SLICES THROUGH THE AIR, AND...

Sheryl's eyes meet Evelyn's. She nods about to continue on,

until she notices Evelyn's demeanor.

She turns, looks around, but spies nothing...

Sheryl turns to the woods, holds her look.     As if she

knows...

In the distance... past the trees, deep into the woods.

COME TO A REST OVER THE SHOULDER OF DEACON. Very much alive.

He stares at the cabin for a beat, then CROSSES out of frame.
