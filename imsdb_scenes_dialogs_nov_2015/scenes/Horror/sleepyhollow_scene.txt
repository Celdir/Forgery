EXT.  GNARLED FOREST -- NIGHT

An UGLY MAN charges through on a horse, holding a lantern

forward on a long pole. He looks back, terrified.

INSERT TITLE:

THUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind.

The ugly man glances back again.  His lantern swings wild...

SHATTERS against a tree.  The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly

man off his horse...

He hits the ground.  He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.

DEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a

HUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone.

The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.  Jagged branches

slit his hands and cheeks.

He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.  He

lifts his bloodied face.  He runs.

IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip

underbrush.  HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the

snorting steed's already bleeding flank.

The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.

ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.  The shrill WHISTLE of a

SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past.

The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an

impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless

body hits the dirt.

EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

Empty cobblestone streets.  Crooked buildings.  A RAPIDLY

CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar.

INSERT TITLE:

TWO CONSTABLES clamor round a corner, lanterns held high,

listening.  They rush into an alleyway.

ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson River.  The BELL is

LOUDER. The two constables arrive, searching.  No one around.

Constable One hefts his pistol, scared.

They hurry to the river's edge.  Down a hill, the MAN,

another constable, stands with his back to us.  He's waist

deep in water, tossing away his ALARM BELL.

Constable Two crosses on the peir above.  Constable One moves

forward, wary.  The MAN grunts, lifting something.

The MAN turns.  Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing.

He drags a bloated MALE CORPSE up from the murky water.

EXT.  WATCHHOUSE/JAIL -- NIGHT

The elderly HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse on

a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two.  A snobby MAGISTRATE

looks, disgusted.  Constable One and Ichabod wait.

Constable Two wheels the corpse inside.  Ichabod's dismayed.

Ichabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in.

INT.  WATCHHOUSE, NIGHT WATCH QUARTERS -- NIGHT

Constable Two wheels the body ahead past many "booking"

tables.  A JAILER moves to unlock a massive door.

The door is opened.  The corpse again leads the way.

INT.  WATCHHOUSE, JAIL -- NIGHT

A two-tiered prison, alive with MOANS of AGONY and CRIES of

INSANITY.  Cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron

gags.  Many are against the bars, watching.

The High Constable reaches a desk, taking a seat.  Guards

wait to process beaten, bloody prisoners.

The Magistrate WHISPERS in the High Constable's ear.  Ichabod

notices with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the

corpse onwards into another room.

The Magistrate finishes.  The High Constable smiles faintly.

Ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken.

The High Constable smiles a sardonic smile.

INT.  WATCHHOUSE, INCINERATION ROOM -- NIGHT

The corpse burns in a raging furnace.  Flesh sizzles.

Constable One pumps bellows which fan the flames.  Ichabod

steps from darkness nearby.  He watches with bitter regret as

the corpse is consumed.

EXT.  CITY -- DAY

Market town streets bustle.  Filthy.  Pigs roam free.

INT.  ICHABOD'S HOME, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

Decorated in Early-American Mad Scientist: books, papers and

jars of chemicals.  Charts of anatomy above a small bed.

At the window, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL

inside.  He opens the cage.  The bird flies free.

Ichabod watches it go, then looks down.  A COACH halts in the

street below.  The forlorn DRIVER looks up.

INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- DAY

In motion.  Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the

strange SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of

tissue.  Many scars.

Ichabod lifts a LEATHER SATCHEL, checking its contents.

EXT.  UPSTATE FORESTS -- DAY

TWO FAMILIES of MIGRANT WORKERS travel a path, leading over-

burdened horses.  Ichabod's coach approaches from the other

direction.  Ichabod looks out, unnerved.

One GAUNT MAN watches Ichabod pass.  There is a dead, worried

look in the man's eyes.  Others stare at Ichabod.

EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY

Ichabod faces two massive, vine-covered PILLARS, unsure.  He

turns to watch the driver lead the coach away.

Ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road.

He does not notice, above: THREE DEAD RAVENS hang from a tree

limb, twine wrapped round their necks.

EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE -- DAY

Ichabod walks on with baggage.  The square is empty, a CHURCH

and GRAVEYARD at one end.  The road ahead is bordered by

businesses and homes.

CONVERSATION DRIFTS from a tavern.  A criminal sits in

stocks.  A quiet CRYING is HEARD.  Ichabod hears...

He looks for its source.  It's from a window above, LOUDER.

SOUNDS like the SOBBING of an OLD WOMAN.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- DAY

with a crow's nest basket atop.  There's a man in the basket

and a huge BELL.

Ichabod ponders this as he continues.  Ahead on a hill: the

grand Van Tassel Manor House.

INT.  VAN TASSEL MANOR HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- DAY

MANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN

spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN

BRUNT.  A few YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch.  Brom releases the

woman.  Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands.

The woman moves to Brom's voice.  He backs away, flanked by

peers GLENN and THEODORE.  Children laugh.

Ichabod enters, clearing his throat.  No one notices.  The

blindfolded woman keeps grasping.  One LITTLE GIRL sees

Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips.

She tugs him.  Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in

the blindfolded woman's grip.

The woman touches Ichabod's face.  He is uncomfortable,

affected by this caress.  Brom watches jealously.

She takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty:

KATRINA VAN TASSEL.  Ichabod tries to compose himself.

Brom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed.  Ichabod's baffled.

Brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod.

BALTUS VAN TASSEL, 45, has entered, a working-class

aristocrat.  LADY VAN TASSEL, 40, stands behind, a mix of

home-spun wife and well-kept lady.

Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point.  Children

gather around Katrina and hide behind her.

Ichabod hands over papers.  Baltus reads, furrows his brow.

Baltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod.  The others huddle to

gossip, except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to

watch Ichabod and Baltus walk down the hall.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY

DOCTOR LANCASTER, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by

the fire, joining Baltus and three other elders.  A pretty

servant, SARAH, brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel

sets down food.  Ichabod is standing.

PHILIPSE is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in

mouth.  CLERGYMAN STEENWYCK is formidably built, wearing a

constant look of disapproval.

HARDENBROOK is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind.

Philipse shoots a look to Baltus.  Angst amongst the elders.

Withered Hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged.

Baltus gestures for Ichabod to sit.  Baltus lights his pipe.

The HESSIAN HORSEMAN rides his black steed into a gory,

close-quarters clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged

weapons.  He cuts down Americans left and right.

He dismounts, hoisting a battle axe.  With sword and axe, he

annihilates.  Blood gushes.  Bones crack.

The Horseman lets out a war cry.  Jagged teeth.  Grotesque.

FOREST BATTLEFIELD -- DAY

Winter.  CANNONS can be HEARD BOOMING from afar.  Daredevil

lies dead in red snow.  FOLLOW FOOTPRINTS away...

The Horseman flees, cloak flowing, chased by FIVE rag-tag

REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS.  Ahead, a steep, rocky area prevents

escape.  Soldier one aims a rifle and FIRES...

Blood explodes from the Horseman's arm as he runs.  His sword

falls from his now functionless hand.

Soldier Two grabs the sword.

At the rocks, the Horseman faces the men.  Another Rifleman

raises his rifle.  The Horseman reaches over his shoulder to

grasp a sheathed knife, THROWS --

THOCK!  The Rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.

The Horseman readies an axe.  The Revolutionaries move in

with swords.  They battle, STEEL AGAINST STEEL.  The Horseman

fends off blows from all sides.

Soldier Three lunges, stabs his blade deep into the

Horseman's side.  The Horseman roars, brings his axe DOWN...

BREAKS the sword at the hilt...

An UPWARDS stroke sends Soldier Three head over heels in a

fountain of blood.

The Horseman staggers, howling, trying to pull the blade from

his ribs.  The remaining soldiers close in.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

Pipe smoke wafts from Philipse's mouth.

Hardenbrook BANGS his cane on a table.  Baltus puts a calming

hand on senile Hardenbrook's shoulder.

A long wait.  No reply from the elders.  Ichabod rises.

EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- EARLY EVENING

The Belltower is covered in defensive spikes.  A man climbs

down a rope ladder.  Below, many ARMED MEN gather.  Everyone

grim.  Philipse moves to the center, on horseback.

A box is handed up.  Ichabod and Baltus arrive on foot at the

back of the mob.  Ichabod looks...

At a nearby forest, men light TORCH POSTS in a line bordering

the forest edge for at least a half mile.

Philipse draws a folded paper from the box, holds it up.

The crowd parts as JONATHAN MASBATH, a dirt-poor farmer with

a bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward.  His son, YOUNG

MASBATH, 14, grips his arm.

Brom steps up, nodding.  Jonathan kisses his son's cheek,

then heads to the rope ladder.  Men pat him on the back.

Young Masbath watches his father go.  Brom coaxes him away.

At the back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks

to Young Masbath as he and Brom pass.

Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Ichabod makes notations in a LEDGER BOOK.

Katrina strolls in, sits on the bed.  Ichabod is nervous.

Ichabod offers his chair, backing away.  Seeing it is the

only one, he remains standing.  Katrina sits.

Katrina looks down, discards this with a smile.

EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT

The torches burn bright.  ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonathan

Masbath loads a rifle.  THUNDER BOOMS.

Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon.

A HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING.  Below, the horse tied at the

base of the tower is spooked.

A COMMOTION is HEARD, ground rumbling.  Jonathan grips a

rifle, cocks it and moves to look...

At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out.  They

sprint past the tower and across the field.

Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter.  He crosses back

to peer at the forest.  Bad news...

A thick FOG creeps from the woods.

As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of

mist snakes up to the flame, killing it.  All along the

forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one...

Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees.

INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Ichabod leans on a dresser.  Katrina's still seated.

Ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that.  The DISTANT

TOLL of a BELL is HEARD.  Katrina looks fearful.

She goes to open a window.  The BELL TOLLS...

EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT

... TOLLS mournfully over farms and forests...

EXT.  FARM -- NIGHT

... TOLLS as a MAN comes from his barn, listening, then

sprinting towards his home.

EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

... TOLLS across the deserted square.  Windows go dark.

Shutters are slammed shut.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

... TOLLS.  Ichabod bounds out to the lawn, halting to

listen.  Katrina and Baltus come out on the porch.

... TOLLS... TOLLS... then, SILENCE.  Ichabod chases away.

Baltus ushers Katrina back in.  The door slams.

EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT

Ichabod charges across the rocky field.  He slows, awed...

The Belltower is down, its mast is splintered.  The horse is

gone.  Ichabod moves to where the crow's nest lies smashed.

No sign of Jonathan.

EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST -- NIGHT

Jonathan runs past, gripping his bow.  It's QUIET... till

HOOFBEATS are HEARD in pursuit.

Trees are silhouetted against the sky.  As HOOFBEATS get

LOUDER, branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to

touch.  As HOOFBEATS ROAR PAST, the trees relax.

FURTHER ON, Jonathan runs.  WIND begins to BLOW.

BEHIND, in motion, WE SEE Daredevil's snorting visage; eyes

lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow.

The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden WAR HAMMER from a saddle

mount.  (No clear view of the Horseman.)

Jonathan is overtaken.  The Horseman swings the hammer WHOOMP

-- sends Jonathan sprawling.

HOOFBEATS FADE.  Jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoots

through him.  He crawls to retrieve his bow.

Against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver

and readies it.  Waiting.  A metal TAPPING is HEARD O.S.

CLINK... CLINK... CLINK.  A HORSE SNORTS.

Jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody.

Elsewhere, Daredevil approaches slow.  The Horseman taps his

sword on his spur, CLINK... CLINK... CLINK...

Foliage moves as the Horseman's form pushes through.

Jonathan releases -- the arrow WHISTLES...

THWACK! -- imbeds in the Horseman's chest.

CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... continues -- Jonathan readies a

second arrow.  Pulls and releases -- O.S. THWACK!

CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan cries out, crawling away

desperately.  Crawling through underbrush, over roots and

rocks.  CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan gives up, spent,

face to the dirt.  He closes his eyes.

CLINKING STOPS.  Daredevil halts astride Jonathan; two legs

on each side of Jonathan's body.

EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND -- MORNING

Baltus and a large, DULLARDLY MAN ride.  Behind, Ichabod

rides with Magistrate Philipse.

Ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag, Gunpowder.

Philipse drinks from a whiskey flask, sees Ichabod watching

and offers some.  Ichabod declines.

Ahead, the dullard, VAN RIPPER, sloppily spits tobacco.

Philipse fingers an IRON KEY talisman he wears on a cord.

EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS, FURTHER ON -- MORNING

Brom and Baltus stand at a HORSE'S CORPSE amongst jagged

boulders.  The flesh has been stripped, guts exposed.

Philipse and Ichabod arrive and dismount.

Brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty.

Brom rides.  Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his

satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one

HORSESHOE.  A WHISTLE is HEARD O.S.

Everyone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden.  The

doctor and others are there.  Van Ripper waves.

INT. FOREST, MASBATH MURDER SITE -- MORNING

Doctor Lancaster stands with SEVERAL ARMED MEN.  A coffin on

a cart is covered by a blanket. Ichabod is crouched nearby.

Ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed.  He puts the horseshoe into a

hoofprint in the dirt.  It fits.

Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves.

Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch.

Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint.  Huge.  He compares the

horseshoe.  The hoofprint is much larger.

Ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl,

bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water

and powder with a fork to make plaster.

The others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering.  Brom

comes up to stand over Ichabod, irritated.

Ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster.

Van Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool.  Ichabod rises to

follow with his satchel.

Van Ripper points.  Ichabod takes a BOTTLE of WHITE POWDER

from his pocket.

He uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on

the dirt there, then waiting.

A chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit.

Ichabod stands, puzzled.  He walks to the coffin cart,

rolling up his sleeves.  Others come to watch, but keep

distance.  Ichabod removes the blanket...

Reveals Jonathan's headless corpse.

Philipse can't look.  Ichabod takes strange spectacles from

his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses.  MAGNIFICATION

SPECTACLES.  He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it.

He pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord.

Ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles.

EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAY

A coffin in a grave.  Headstone reads "MASBATH, 1799."  A

CROWD gathered.  Young Masbath broods.  Clergyman Steenwyck

steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt.

Men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard.

Steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words.

In the crowd people whisper.  They steal glances at Ichabod,

who stands with the Van Tassels.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING/VARIOUS ROOMS -- DAY

Dining room.  Sarah and two other servants collect plates.  A

few people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty WIFE

and two kids.  Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something

his also-drunk wife says.

IN the HALL and FOYER, funeral goers socialize quietly.

FURTHER ON, in the SITTING ROOM, men smoke.  Young Masbath

is confronting Ichabod, who is leaving...

Young Masbath exits.  Ichabod remains impassive.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY

Ichabod comes out.  KILLIAN, a dashingly rustic man, carries

his son, THOMAS, 5, and chats with Baltus.  Doctor Lancaster

peers off at something through a SPYGLASS.

ICHABOD'S POINT OF VIEW -- THROUGH SPYGLASS

Searching a line of trees and foliage far away...

There he is -- the LENAPE.  A towering savage with misshapen

features covered in tumors.  He ducks away.

BACK TO SCENE ON PORCH

Ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed.

Ichabod and Killian nod as Baltus and Lancaster head in.

Ichabod ponders, folding the spyglass.

Ichabod nods.  He turns to look THROUGH THE WINDOW.  In the

DINING ROOM, Van Ripper rises, ill.  His wife questions his

health, but he holds her off and vomits.

Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL ORCHARD -- EARLY EVENING

Ocher dusk.  Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the

ground, miserable.  Young Masbath does not look up.

Ichabod rides.  Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows.

EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAWN

Steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at Ichabod, furious.

Steenwyck looks to men with shovels.  Killian's there.

Philipse, hung-over, stands beside Young Masbath.

Philipse just looks up with a helpless expression.

Ichabod motions.  Killian leads the men to the graveyard.

Steenwyck watches, enraged.  He kicks his horse and rides.

Philipse looks worried.

EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- LATER MORNING (TIME CUT)

A PSALM is HEARD READ by STEENWYCK O.S. while a coffin is

exhumed.  Ichabod guides the lifting.  The coffin is put near

the headstone "WINDSOR."  Ichabod looks...

At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now

take up the PRAYER.

Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are

pried open.  "VAN GARRETT, 1799."  Killian leads the effort

with Young Masbath's aid...

The lids come off, revealing the HEADLESS BODIES of a MAN and

a little BOY.  Young Masbath backs away.

At the "WINDSOR" coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens the

lid.  WE DO NOT SEE inside, but when Ichabod does, he is

aghast.  He looks to the men, angry.

No answer.  Killian arrives, nods solemnly.

Ichabod kneels, studying.  Now, WE SEE: the belly of the

headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was

very far along in a pregnancy.

Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.  He

reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach.

He straightens, greatly troubled.

INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING

Scissors cut open the widow's blouse.  There's an inch-long

WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.

Ichabod examines the corpse on a table.  Lancaster watches,

anxiously mopping his face.  Young Masbath's in a corner.

Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes.

Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.

Ichabod picks up an iron knife.  He looks to Young Masbath.

EXT.  CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING

Ichabod and others restore graves.  Ichabod looks to the

church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door.

Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Ichabod sleeps, dreaming...

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FARMLAND -- DAY

A young BOY, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us.

A FEMALE VOICE is HEARD FAINTLY, getting LOUDER.

The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling.  He runs.  We FOLLOW

to a clearing behind a frontier home.  MOTHER waits.  Lovely

woman.  She kisses him.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Dark.  Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open.  Across the

room, Mother has her back to him.  She's WHISPERING something

to no one.  She turns...

Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep.

A DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING.  Mother exits.  Ichabod gets up,

curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing.

It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern

with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.  Young Ichabod

replaces it, closes the drawer.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY

A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.  Young

Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man.  Father stops

to examine tools.  Young Ichabod stays by him, but something

captures his attention...

Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a

FREAKISH-LOOKING WOMAN.  They shout.  People stop to watch.

Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT

LIGHTNING flashes over tree tops.  THUNDER BOOMS.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Ichabod jerks awake in his bed.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger.  He sits,

studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight.

She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter.

Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with

another on her lap and covers them.

Ichabod sits, looking through his ledger.

She takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm.  She

touches the many evenly spaced scars.

Their eyes meet.  Ichabod gets back to the ledger.  Katrina

seems to relish the effect she has.  Ichabod finds a paper

disk on string, illustrated thusly:

Ichabod gives it.  She spins it, smiling.

Ichabod watches it spin.  He shakes his head, unimpressed.

She hands him a book.  "ROMEO AND JULIET."  Ichabod stands,

offering it back, but she will not take it.

Ichabod stops at the door, looks back.  He exits.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

A light glows in Ichabod's window.  LOOKING IN: Ichabod's in

bed, fully dressed.  He sits up.  Pause.  He crosses to pick

up "Romeo and Juliet."  He begins to read.

EXT.  PHILIPSE'S FARM -- DUSK

Ichabod walks with Philipse.  Young Masbath follows with the

horses.  CICADAS CHATTER from a vast corn field.

The CICADAS SUDDENLY go SILENT.  Young Masbath notices.

Young Masbath looks to a fenced grazing area, worried.  The

sheep there are agitated, all running one direction away.

The horses go crazy, braying and rearing.  The reins yank

Young Masbath off his feet as the horses flee.

Ichabod and Philipse look to Masbath.  A SOUND is HEARD,

distant: THUNDERING HOOFBEATS.  Wind kicks up.  HOOFBEATS

seem to come FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

Philipse looks to the corn field.  A flock of birds alights;

a great sheet of black against the sky.

Philipse runs towards his house, past Masbath.  HOOFBEATS are

LOUDER, CLOSER.  Ichabod faces the corn field.

The field explodes open, stalks bending to make way as the

Headless Horseman gallops into view atop Daredevil.

Young Masbath runs, following Philipse.

Ichabod's stunned.  He looks down to draw his flintlock

pistol, but the Horseman blows by before he can raise it.  A

blast of air knocks Ichabod off his feet.

The Horseman chases Masbath and Philipse.

Ichabod follows.

The Horseman draws his sword.

Young Masbath falls in the grass...

Daredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him.

Daredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge.

Philipse has a long way to go before home.  He looks over his

shoulder.  No way he'll make it.

Ichabod, running, watches Philipse slow.

Philipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning.  The

Horseman is closing, sword held high.

Philipse raises his talisman.

Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless.  The

Horseman swings -- WE HEAR the CLANK of sword on talisman...

Philipse's severed head spins.  His body falls and folds.

Ichabod runs past Young Masbath.

The Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front

of dead Philipse, aiming his pistol.  Daredevil lets out a

SCREECHY CRY.  The Horseman rides toward Ichabod.

Ichabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol.  The

Horseman closes.  Ichabod sweats bullets.  FIRES...

The slug SLAMS the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and

rends his uniform without slowing him.

The Horseman is almost on Ichabod.  Ichabod cringes, arms

up... as the Horseman passes.

The Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword.

With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away.

Ichabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest.

Ichabod looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not

support him, falls, trembling.  THUNDER BELLOWS.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

Lady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks.  Sarah stands behind

with a tray of food.  Young Masbath is seated near.

Young Masbath shakes his head.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod sleeps restlessly.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

THUNDER BOOMS.  WIND and POUNDING RAIN blast open a window.

Mother comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young

Ichabod in bed.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

A keyhole.  Young Ichabod's eye peers in...

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- P.O.V. THROUGH KEYHOLE

Mother is kneeled before flour on the floor.  She draws

patterns in it, whispering.  She blows the flour away.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

The Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the

home, supported by a SAD MAN.  She weeps, carrying something

in a blanket.

Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared.

The Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls.  The blanket

opens... the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt.  The

Freakish Woman's WAILING GROWS LOUDER.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FRONT OF YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT

TWO MEN in black drag Mother to a coach.  She looks back,

fearful, pulled along.  A THIRD MAN in black follows.

Young Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him.

The Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish

man with a villainous face.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY

Many people in the gallery.  The Third Man stands in front of

the tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box.

Mother sits in shackles.

Those in attendance cry out at this.  Ichabod is seated

beside Father, eyes filled with tears.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

As before, a STORM RAGES.  Ichabod is in Mother's arms.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- DAY

KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod gasps awake.

Ichabod looks at his hands balled into fists.  He opens them

-- has ONE HALF of PHILIPSE'S TALISMAN in each palm.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Katrina holds a tray of food.  The DOOR is HEARD UNLOCKING.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Katrina enters.  Ichabod sits at his work table.

Ichabod shakes his head, won't look up.  Katrina crosses.

She begins picking up pieces of the PLASTER HOOFPRINT CAST

which lies shattered on the floor.

Ichabod stews, head in his hands.  Someone is HEARD

RUNNING... Young Masbath enters, frightened.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

The Lenape Indian hangs dead in a tree, lynched.  TOWNSFOLK

are gathered.  Ichabod makes his way through, followed by

Young Masbath, looking up.

Brom strides towards Ichabod from a group of men spreading a

sheet under the tree.  Van Ripper's there.

Brom points to where TWO FILTHY MEN in chains sit in a

horse-drawn cart.  An armed man guards them.

The armed man shoves the filthy man to shut him up.

Van Ripper cuts the noose rope at the trunk.  The Lenape

corpse free falls, landing hard.

The Lenape lies in a heap on the sheet.  Van Ripper and

others come to lift the sheet with the Lenape in the middle.

Ichabod watches, noticing...

The Lenape wears a WOVEN PIECE of REED GRASS a cord on his

loin cloth, twisted in a pattern.

Ichabod kneels.  He removes the woven piece, looking across

the diseased Lenape's body.  Something else...

The Lenape's mouth is agape; teeth rotting.  Ichabod looks

around, finds a twig.  He uses it to pull the Lenape's mouth

open... gets close to peer inside the Lenape's mouth.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

A DRAWING of the Lenape's WOVEN PIECE in Ichabod's ledger.

The piece lies near.

Ichabod sits staring at it, trance-like.  Masbath waits.

Long silence.

Ichabod rises, deciding.  He picks up his satchel and exits.

Young Masbath is surprised.  He follows.

EXT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

A massive, wooden WINDMILL, raised off the ground on a 7'

center post.  Ichabod and Masbath walk to it.

INT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

Ichabod and Young Masbath enter via a ladder from the

underbelly.  Gears and counter wheels turn millstones.  A few

men work in the grain powder filled air.

Ichabod leads the way to a staircase, up twists and turns.

EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- DAY

Ichabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof.  The

rotors spin nearby.  Ichabod searches the countryside.

Below, MANY MEN are ride up the long straight road.

Ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to

Masbath, then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl.

A plume of smoke rises from woods, far.

Ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point

of a sewing needle against a small BLACK ROCK.

Ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle.  Young Masbath is

amazed, reaching for it.  Ichabod watches him play with it.

Ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of

the straw.  Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it.

Young Masbath lifts the bowl.  Ichabod drops in the

needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like.

Ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle

points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch.

Katrina's on horseback below, unhappy.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL GREAT LAWN -- DAY

Ichabod and Katrina lead their horses.  A heated argument.

Ichabod struggles for a reply.

Katrina storms away.  Ichabod's already regretting.

EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- DAY

Ichabod and Young Masbath ride to the Western Woods, horses

loaded for expedition.  At the Belltower remnants, Ichabod

slows, looking to the wreckage.

At forest's edge, Young Masbath waits.

Ichabod circles the tower.  With a sigh, he rides to join

Young Masbath. They head into the woods.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

Dark, dense and creepy.  Ichabod and Young Masbath move

through.  Young Masbath halts his horse and looks around.

Stark quiet.  Ichabod notes this unhappily.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- LATER DAY

Ichabod's hand drops the needle/straw in the water bowl.  The

needle spins.  The bowl is turned to match notches.

Ichabod points the way to Young Masbath.

ELSEWHERE, SOMEONE WATCHES:  A MOVING P.O.V. WATCHES them as

they ride, FOLLOWS.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- LATER DAY

Ichabod and Masbath reach a hill crest.  They stop, uneasy.

Below: a CAVE with a rock archway.  An ill-fitting door

covers the mouth.  The chimney spews smoke.

EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

The horses are tied to a tree.  Ichabod walks to the cave

door.  Unsure, he hesitantly knocks.

INT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

Ichabod and Young Masbath step in.

Walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed

grass in patterns.  An OLD CRONE sits facing away.

The old Crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey

features, sits disinterested.  Ichabod edges closer.

Ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and

acorns.  Knifes, scissors, yellow bones.  He takes the

Lenape's piece of reed grass from his pocket.

The old Crone places something on a table beside her -- a

dead cardinal, bright red.

Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the

woven piece and steps to the Crone.

Young Masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal.  He

walks to join Ichabod in leaving.

The Old Crone reaches to pick up the weaving.  She stands,

faces them.  Tall.  Ichabod nods.

The Old Crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave.

INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

The Old Crone comes through a passage in the wet walls.

Ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.

Ichabod sits on crooked stool.  The old Crone kneels with her

back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.

She gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile.

She takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from

one.  She shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and

upends it.  A baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed.

The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its

head.  She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES,

guttural.  Using a wick, she lights the straw.

She grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these

onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.

Ichabod would like to leave now.

EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

Young Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up.  Through the

trees, black clouds billow and block the sun.

INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

The old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod.  She

does not move.  Wind howls through a hole/window.  Rain.

Candles blow out.  Ichabod stands, worried.

She remains motionless.  The STORM outside intensifies.

WE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in

the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding.

Some thing Ichabod cannot see.  He inches closer.

The Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human,

half-demon CREATURE.  Its black clawed hands reaching.

Ichabod recoils, crying out.

Chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back.

Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones.  The

creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod.  It SCREECHES.

The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood

red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged.

Ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature

claws the rock floor, yearning.

The creature pulls, testing the chains.  Behind, the BOLT

holding the chains to the wall slips.  The wall cracks.

Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast.  He glances to the exit.

The chain bolt gives more... coming loose...

Ichabod bolts for the door.  The creature HOWLS, leaping...

The chain bolt breaks...

Ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor...

It is the Old Crone who landed on him.  She has returned to

human form, semi-conscious.  Ichabod shoves her off.

EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

Ichabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath.

Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the

woods, glancing back.  Young Masbath follows.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- EARLY EVENING

No rain.  Dark.  A lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as

Ichabod and Young Masbath ride.

A BIRD CRIES OUT.  Ichabod's startled, looking up.  The BIRD

is HEARD ALIGHTING.  Leaves float downwards.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS (TIME CUT) -- NIGHT

Horses are tied.  Ichabod is seated against a tree.  A

campfire burns.  Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross

his chest, staring to treetops.

Leaves and branches shift in the wind.  Bats fly wildly.

A SNAPPING BRANCH.  Ichabod raises his pistol.

Ichabod rises.  He creeps forward, pistol and lantern

forward.  Foliage is thick.  CRUNCHING LEAVES are HEARD.

Ichabod crouches, puts down the lantern and picks up a

branch.  He tosses the branch to the foliage...

SOME ANIMAL darts away, a running blur.

Ichabod rises, following with his pistol.

ANOTHER ANGLE,

moving swiftly at Ichabod...

Ichabod spins, blindsided.

Young Masbath fires his rifle -- CRACK!!

The ANIMAL is KNOCKED DOWN mid-leap, yelping...

The beast lands, a mass of grey fur.

Ichabod comes to stare down.  Young Masbath arrives.  They

both look to the beast, horrified.

The creature lies helplessly spastic; a TWO-HEADED WOLF, with

one head blown open to brain and gore.  Its living head

lifts, MEWING sadly, eyes pleading.

Ichabod step up with pistol.  FIRES.  MEWING STOPS.

Ichabod swallows back sickness, looking away.  Something

catches his eye.

Through the forest: the SKY'S LIT UP.  Distant fire.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, CAVE HOME -- EARLY EVENING

Ichabod and Masbath ride up, confronted by the Crone's cave

vomiting flame out all orifices.

Ichabod approaches.  Embers swirl everywhere.  The Old

Crone's body lies amongst bloodied leaves.  Headless.

EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

Much commotion.  A MOB in front of the home marked

"LANCASTER, PHYSICIAN."  Steenwyck addresses the rabble.

Baltus, Lady Van Tassel and Katrina watch at safe distance.

Killian, on horseback beside his wife, BETH, and son, Thomas,

rides to one side of the shouting crowd.

INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

Ichabod examines the Crone's neck wound with magnification

spectacles.  Young Masbath is seated, ledger in his lap.

Ichabod lifts her dead hand to show bruises and cuts.

INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

Doctor Lancaster wrings his hands.  His WIFE rocks nervously

in a rocking chair.  The CROWD outside ROARS as a bonfire

lights up the curtained windows.

The front door is POUNDED open.  ANGRY MEN enter.  Lancaster

stands, lips quivering.  He points insistently to a door.

INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

Angry men break in.  Ichabod looks up.

Ichabod is shoved aside, spectacles knocked off.

The group grasps the Crone.  Masbath stands on his chair,

clutching the ledger.  Ichabod grabs one man.

The man slams Ichabod back.

Magnification spectacles are crushed under foot.

EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

Angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire.  The mob

makes way.  Steenwyck cheers them.

Ichabod comes out, followed by Young Masbath.  The Crone's

corpse is thrown in the fire.  Cheers all around.

At Ichabod's side, a man tries to grab the ledger Young

Masbath holds.  Young Masbath cries out, hanging on to the

book.  Ichabod joins the struggle.

Katrina watches, emotions conflicting.

Other men grab Ichabod.  One punches Ichabod in the face.

Katrina rides forward as Baltus calls for her to stop.

Katrina leaps down, into the crowd, pulls men off Ichabod.

A SHOT RINGS OUT.  Chaos halts.  Everyone turns, quieting.

The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones.

Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn.

Masbath is released, along with the ledger.  Steenwyck moves

forward, pushing people aside.

He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle.  Brom hefts

the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket.

Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows.  It WHISTLES.

Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed.

Brom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road.  FIRES.

PLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES.  Smoke wafts.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY

Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful.  We are

back in the court where Mother stands trial.

The evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN.

As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father,

who sits with hands clenched, emotionless.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT

In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table.

Father stares into his food.

Father doesn't even look up.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT

Empty church.  Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews.  A

soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle.

The soldier exits through a white door.  Young Ichabod waits,

looking up at the vast church.  The white door opens and the

Third Man steps out.

The Third Man leaves through the white door.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

Young Ichabod buttons his shirt.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S YARD -- MORNING

Young Ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not

understanding.  Father loads a wagon full of belongings.

Realization comes to Young Ichabod.  He runs, away across the

lawn as Father calls after him.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST TRAIL -- MORNING

Young Ichabod runs, weeping.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- MORNING

Empty.  Doors are thrown open and Young Ichabod enters.  He

goes down the aisle, towards the white door.

ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH, BEYOND WHITE DOOR -- MORNING

Young Ichabod enters, halting.  The room contains TORTURE

DEVICES: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles.

He walks, numb, eyes locked forward...

In the corner is a SPIKED CHAIR, adorned with sharp iron

spikes.  Hundreds of spikes.  It is fitted with straps for

holding down the "accused."

Tears stream down Young Ichabod's face.  He kneels, hands on

the spikes of the chair, pressing hard.

As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

In bed, Ichabod opens tear filled eyes.  He sits up, bringing

his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks.  His hands trail

blood. He looks to them...

The old scars are bleeding.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

Katrina comes to the door.  Ichabod is seated by the fire,

eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth.

Katrina comes beside Ichabod's chair.

She moves in front.  Ichabod gets up and crosses to sit

facing away.  Katrina takes the chair he deserted.

Ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed.

Katrina walks to him.  She touches his back.

She kneels, smiles a little for him.  She reaches to touch

his face, holds his head in her hands.  Leans to kiss him.

He rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms

around her.  They kiss passionately.

EXT.  THE HOLLOW -- EARLY MORNING

Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- MORNING

Ichabod exits his room, satchel in hand.  He looks down the

hall, then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase.

AROUND A CORNER, Ichabod comes to the last door.  He bends,

slipping the white rose under the crack of the door.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

Rain.  Ichabod comes out.  Across the lawn, Young Masbath is

bringing the horses.

Ichabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing.

Baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand.

Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be.

Lady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet.

Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath.  Baltus watches from the

porch, disgruntled.  He goes in.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

Heavy rain.  Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side.

A SOUND is HEARD.  Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath.

Ichabod rides faster.  Young Masbath keeps up.

FURTHER ON, they charge over a hill.  Ichabod halts Gunpowder

and climbs clumsily off.

Young Masbath obeys.  Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades

into forest growth, backtracking.

INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low.  A

HORSE is HEARD SNORTING.  He pushes through branches...

Moving behind a FIGURE IN A GREY CLOAK on horseback.

The figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood.  Katrina.

Ichabod softens, but doesn't want to.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY

Raining still.  Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a

clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of...

A monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's

center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and

gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture.

Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and

weeds will not grow.  Young Masbath and Katrina dismount.

Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches.

He circles the incredibly wide trunk.

There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had

a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and

disgustingly scarred.  Ichabod approaches.

He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap

begins to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it.

Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the

horses, digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe.

At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against

the suture.  It sounds hollow.  Ichabod begins to chop.

He pulls away loose bark.  The tree drips more blood and a

clear goo.  Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the

festering suture.

Ignoring, Young Masbath moves closer.  Ichabod keeps

chopping, then grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to

bend it.  It's not easy.  Ichabod struggles.

Katrina follows Masbath's slow advance.

Ichabod's pulling... the flap suddenly gives, revealing a

blood-soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.

Ichabod recoils.  Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream,

taking Young Masbath in her arms to keep him from looking.

It is Philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by

roots grown around and into the flesh.

Ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth.

FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots

within the dewy innards.

He looks to the branches towering above.

Ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree.

He gets to his knees, pushing mud away.

Uncovering a flush HEADSTONE carved with "666."

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- LATER DAY

Rain.  Young Masbath's crouched, muddy, rifle across his

knees.  He's watching the tree.

Behind him, Katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a

pile of mud.  Ichabod hands up the shovel.

Young Masbath goes to the grave.  Ichabod pulls at thick

burlap cloth, straining as it comes away.

Ichabod looks down, disbelieving.

WE SEE: roots have gripped the Horseman's bones and tattered

uniform.  The skeleton is all there -- except the skull.

Ichabod climbs out, weary in body and spirit.  LIGHTNING.

THUNDER.  He stares at the bones.

Ichabod turns, looking to the bordering forest.

Ichabod turns, looks...

Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because the ROOTS in the

grave are ALIVE, further entwining around remains.

Ichabod spins to the twisted tree...

The vertical SUTURE SEETHES, pulling inwards... sucking

Philipse's head back in and closing, bubbling.

Ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and

Young Masbath along as he flees.

At the tree, the suture swells.

Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking

horses are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover.

A RUMBLING is HEARD from the twisted tree, which suddenly

BURSTS wide, spitting smoldering cinders.

At the tree line, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath cower,

looking back.

From the tree wound, a glow brightens, till the Headless

Horseman and Daredevil EXPLODE into existence...

They hit the ground running.

Ichabod watches the Horseman ride away with bolts of

LIGHTNING STRIKING the GROUND BEHIND.

The Horseman disappears in the forest.

Ichabod runs towards the horses.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

The Horseman rips past on Daredevil.

EXT.  BEHIND IN WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

Small home.  Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper.

Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife.

Thomas gets down from his chair.  He goes to the fireplace to

light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a

lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with

silhouettes of lions and monsters.

Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the

creatures, shadows are thrown.  He roars for them, imagining

them real and having a grand time.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

Beth comes for more dishes.

Killian pulls her to him, playful.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him.

In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in

the wall.  Then, another spider skitters out.  More follow.

EXT.  FORESTS -- DAY

A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.  THUNDER is

HEARD.  The horse slows and stops... it is Brom's horse, with

Brom aboard.  Brom looks skyward.

The storm harshens, roaring through the trees.  Distant

HOOFBEATS can be HEARD.  POUNDING.

Brom takes his rifle off his shoulder.  The HOOFBEATS grow

LOUDER and PASS, far away.  Brom turns in the saddle and

WHISTLES.  He kicks his horse and rides.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

Thomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else.

He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all

directions. Thomas is amused.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

Behind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost

imperceptibly.  Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform

again, shifting.  WIND HOWLS.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

Beth enters, looking at Thomas.

The magic lantern stops spinning.  Shadow creatures freeze.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

The ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS.  Killian looks up.  CREAKING STOPS.

The HOWLING WIND is LOUD.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

Beth comes to Thomas' side as he points.

Beth bends to see the swarming spiders.  She looks up,

noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

Killian stands, looking up.  The HOUSE CREAKS again, then

suddenly the WIND CEASES.  Silence.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

Beth picks up Thomas.  The magic lantern creatures begin

spinning anew, all around.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

With a ROAR, the fire flares.  Killian looks.

WHHOOOSH the fire shoots up the fireplace.  Gone.

Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARDS.  The Horseman

steps in, a battle axe in each hand.  WIND BLASTS...

The DOOR to the other room SLAMS.

Killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the Horseman.

The Horseman swings, smashing it aside.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

Beth hugs Thomas to her as she backs away.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

Killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to

fend off a blow from the Horseman.

The Horseman swings the other axe.  Killian ducks.  The axe

cracks fireplace stone, throwing sparks.

Killian lunges, jamming the skewer into the Horseman.

The skewer comes through the Horseman's back.  The Horseman

swipes with the flat of one axe -- pounding Killian aside.

Killian hits the wall, bashing his head.  Hits the floor.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

Beth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

The Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it.  He

goes to lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back

the axe in the other...

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

At the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to the

cellar.  Thomas is crying.

Beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet.

The room's door flies open and the Horseman strides in,

carrying Killian's severed head.  Beth shrieks.

The Horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

Beth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF.  Her BODY is HEARD

HITTING the floor above.  Thomas crosses the cellar,

stumbles.  He scurries into the shelter of a wheelbarrow

propped against the wall.  FOOTSTEPS are HEARD.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a

sack, cinching the sack shut.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle

axe he left.  He stands.  Pause.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

Thomas' trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer.  QUIET.

He tries to control his sobbing.

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

The Horseman turns, falls to his knees.  He starts to chop at

the floor with both axes.  CHOPping,  CHOPping,  CHOPping...

making quick work of it...

INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

A hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls.

Thomas looks up, terrified.  He gets up to run away...

The Horseman's arm shoves through above, grasping Thomas and

yanking him up.

EXT.  KILLIAN'S FARM -- DAY

Brom rides from the forest, charging across Killian's field.

At Killian's house, Daredevil rides up as the Headless

Horseman walks out with his sack of heads.  The Horseman ties

the sack to the saddle and leaps up.

Brom puts his reins in his mouth, raising his rifle.

The Horseman heads away, past the barn, as Brom gains.

Brom aims... FIRES!

BOOM -- the slug EXPLODES, blowing the Horseman off

Daredevil.  Daredevil keeps going.  The Horseman's smoldering

body is left "face down."

Brom halts his horse.  He climbs down, pleased.

The Horseman moves.

Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing.

The Horseman gets on his knees.

Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading.  He fills the gun

from his powder horn.

The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns.  The

blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder,

exposing rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.

Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel.

The Horseman charges.

Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod.  The Horseman is on him.

Brom swings the rifle, blocking.  Sparks fly.

The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword

with the gun -- CLANK -- CLANK -- CLANK.

ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open.

UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing.  Brom

goes down, his rifle sent flying.

Brom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes.

Brom flees.  The Horseman pulls and throws a knife...

THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.

The Horseman runs towards Brom.

Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle.

Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife.

The Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down.

He plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about

to skewer...

Ichabod arrives full gallop, SMASHES the lantern into the

Horseman -- knocking the Horseman off Brom.

AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST, Theodore and Glen arrive on

horseback.  They hold a moment, watching.

Brom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm

implements propped there.  Brom grabs SCYTHES with long

curved blades, one in per hand.

The Horseman rises.

Ichabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom.

The Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his

free hand.  Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious.

FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to

reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing.

At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees.

Brom steps up, scythes ready.  He and the Horseman go at it.

Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows.

At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away.

Ichabod grabs a long handled SICKLE.

Brom swings the scythes.  The Horseman avoids.

Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening.  He swings

the sickle. The Horseman blocks.

The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows...

countering every strike, METAL RINGING.

Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it

off.  Catches the axe handle in the other scythe.

The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.

Ichabod swings the sickle blade...

Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt.

The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking...

The sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away.

Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow.

He looks up.  The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to

pull the blade from his body.

Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet.

They head towards the forest.

Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it.  He

strides after them, picks up his axe on the way.

EXT.  RIVERBANK -- DAY

Ichabod and Brom stumble down a hillside.  Brom points.

They run to a DOCK at the edge of a wide, rapid river.  They

jump into a FLAT BOAT barge.

Ichabod goes.  Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes.

Ichabod picks up a GUIDE POLE.  The barge lurches, set free.

Ichabod struggles to push the boat out.  it moves swiftly,

caught in rain swollen current.

Brom looks back.  No Horseman.  He leaves the scythe and

moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide.

Ichabod looks to the shore.  Horror.

LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES -- ahead, the Horseman stands on the

bank with Axe and sword.  Daredevil near.

Ichabod and Brom push with the poles, trying for speed.

At the bank, the Horseman walks directly to the water...

Just as he takes a step onto the water, the rain churned

surface TRANSFORMS -- instantly BECOMING a SHEET of ICE...

SPREADING and supporting the Horseman as he advances.

ICE SHOOTS OUT ahead of him, towards a point in the river

where it will intercept the barge.

The Horseman's ICE BRIDGE engulfs the barge, HALTING IT.

Ichabod and Brom are thrown.  The barge is trapped.

The Horseman nears.

Brom runs to the rear to retrieve his scythe.  Ichabod holds

up the only weapon he has, his guide pole.

The Horseman steps on board.  Ichabod swings.  The Horseman's

axe cracks the pole in half...

The Horseman thrusts with sword -- into Ichabod's chest --

clean through.  It SIZZLES as Ichabod screams.

The Horseman lifts Ichabod up, flips him, pulling the sword

out as Ichabod goes...

SMASHING through the ice and under.

UNDERWATER: water carries Ichabod, slams him against ice

above. He's pulled down by undertow.

ABOVE WATER, beyond the edge of the ice bridge: Ichabod comes

up, gasping, choking on rain.

He treads water, looking to the barge.

Aboard the barge, the Horseman cuts Brom down... stands over

him, chopping with sword.  Our VIEW grows BLURRY, and...

FADES OUT/IN

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Candlelight.  Ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes.

The wound at the top of his chest is raw.  Katrina inserts a

needle in the skin around it.

Ichabod tries to sit.  Pain stops him.  Lady Van Tassel helps

bleed the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a

SUCTION JAR of blood.

Doctor Lancaster comes to the bed.

Ichabod gives up, closes his eyes.  Katrina, needle in one

hand, brings her other hand to hold Ichabod's.

Blood drips into the suction jar.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

Ichabod is soundly asleep.  Across the room, Katrina is at

his work table.  Ichabod stirs.  Katrina looks to him.

Once she is satisfied he will not wake, she returns to what

she was doing, turning a page.  She is reading his ledger.

EXT.  SERVANT'S QUARTER'S, MASBATH'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Young Masbath lies awake.  A glint of light crosses the

window.  Masbath looks to it, gets up, peers out.

THROUGH THE WINDOW, he can see the Van Tassel Manor House in

the distance.  Lantern LIGHT crosses the lawn.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE, ORCHARD -- NIGHT

The lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the

house.  We cannot make out the person.

Elsewhere, Young Masbath runs in pursuit.  He hides against

one tree, leans to look...

The light enters forest.  Young Masbath follows.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- MORNING

Ichabod's hurting.  Masbath helps with a shirt.

Ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel.

Ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder.

It bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed.

Ichabod kneels, pained.  A trail of the blood-detecting

powder has spilled.  The bottle is out of reach.

Young Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod

stops him, peering under.

Far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling.

Ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain.

Young Masbath helps. They drag the bed to one side.

Under the bed: a Satanic PENTAGRAM has been DRAWN IN BLOOD.

Ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication.  Masbath is

about to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips.

Ichabod moves to lock the door.

Ichabod does not answer.  He picks up a wash basin and dumps

the water to wash the Pentagram away.

EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- DAY

WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm.  A CROWD loots the

town's general store.  Provisions are passed along man to man

and loaded on wheelbarrows.

All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up

windows with lumber.

Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces.

They stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door

of the "NOTARY."  Ichabod looks off...

DOWN THE ROAD, at the far end, people head to the church.

Much activity there as well.

Families put up tents all around the church within the

bordering wrought-iron fence.  Supplies abound.

People work to build and erect massive wooden crosses.

INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

Tidy room.  Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of

paper to the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook.

Hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye.

Hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning.  Ichabod

stands waiting.  Hardenbrook is still nodding.

Hardenbrook heads across the room.  Ichabod offers the list.

Hardenbrook takes it and exits.  Young Masbath sits.

Ichabod waits.  After a moment, he looks uncertain.  He

crosses to the half-open door...

INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM -- DAY

Ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees.

Hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray.  Tables, shelves,

and baskets of unevenly piled documents.

Hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table,

lifting papers, mumbling.

Hardenbrook turns, a bit startled.

INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM (TIME CUT) -- DAY

Hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open.

Ichabod and Young Masbath face official-looking documents,

with Ichabod focused on one will in hand.

Ichabod turns the will in his hand to Masbath.

Young Masbath takes it, boggled.  Ichabod grabs another.

Ichabod sits back.

Ichabod stares off.

Ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.

A LOUD NOISE is HEARD from the other room.  Ichabod looks.

INT.  HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

Ichabod bursts in.  No one there.  A chair has been knocked

over and the front door is ajar.  Ichabod moves...

EXT.  NOTARY -- DAY

Ichabod exits.  All around is the commotion in the square as

before.  No telling who it was who just fled.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

Young Masbath is seated, bored.  Ichabod writes in his

ledger.  A KNOCK on the door.  They both look up.

The knob is tried and found locked.  Pause.  At the bottom of

the door, a red rose is passed under.

This saddens Ichabod.

EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

Quiet night.  The church is a sight, with a yard resembling

an empty squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses.

Boarded over windows leak shafts of light.

MOVING PAST THE WINDOWS: many eyes peer out from the slats.

UP IN THE BELFRY, TWO RIFLEMEN are on watch.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Ichabod and Masbath are in darkness, still waiting.  Ichabod

takes the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock.  Midnight,

straight up.  Ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Ichabod and Young Masbath look out, cautious.  They move to

the nearest door.

Ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the

door and door frame.  He's making a low, wax seal.  If the

door opens, the seal will break.

They move to a second door, quietly.  Ichabod makes another

low wax mark.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall.  Ichabod

continues his wax marking at each door.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT

Ichabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door.  Ichabod

walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound

DOCUMENTS and hands some to Masbath.

Young Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these "LOAN

AGREEMENT" parchments.  Ichabod brings another pile.

Young Masbath has the M's.  "MARYIE," "MEGAPOLENISIS," AND

"MELYN..." Not finding what he wants.

A FLOORBOARD CREAKS.  Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern.

He and Young Masbath stand frozen.

Across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then

continues.  A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING.  Ichabod

crosses to follow, pointing back.

EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

Lantern light moves, far ahead.  Ichabod follows.

EXT.  FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT

Ichabod stops, hidden.  He can see the light ahead, but it is

no longer in motion.  He advances.

EXT.  FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT

A lantern sits on a rock.  On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and

semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.

Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.

The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top.  His grunts

and gasps are particularly desperate.  He's all over the

woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel.

Ichabod swallows, inches closer.

Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh.

She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.

Ichabod's eyes widen.

Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing

deep in her palm.  Blood flows.  She rubs her cut hand over

her partner's arching back, smearing blood.

Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face...

trailing blood.  The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks

the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck.

Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Young Masbath unlocks the door.  Ichabod enters.

This troubles Ichabod.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Ichabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner.  Going to the

LAST DOOR, Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing...

The wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER AND HALL -- NIGHT

Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax

marks.  Young Masbath finds one broken.

Ichabod comes over, pushes the door...

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

They enter.  The kitchen is empty.  Ichabod crosses to

another door, crouches.  Another broken wax mark.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

They enter... the room with the elaborate loom.  Ichabod

moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table.

He touches the top of a candle.  His finger comes away with a

bit of still wet wax.

Ichabod stops, looking around.  No books anywhere.

Ichabod ponders this without saying anything.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

SEARCH MONTAGE:

- Drawers are opened and searched, quietly.

- Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace.

- Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets.

- Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of

sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward.

Inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware.

Ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards.

Young Masbath crawls, doing the same.  He climbs under the

loom, tapping on the floor.  TAP... TAP... TAP...

He crawls further under the loom.  TAP... TAP... PLONK.  A

hollow sound.  He taps again... PLONK... PLONK.

Ichabod comes over as Young Masbath lifts a loose board.

Under the floor, there are piles of books.  Masbath brings

them up, handing them to Ichabod, who studies the spines.

Young Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder.  He comes up

with "LOAN AGREEMENTS."

Ichabod takes them.  Names are near the top: "Masbath," "Van

Garret," "Philipse," and "Killian."

Ichabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

Lady Van Tassel prepares food with two servants at the open

fireplace/oven.  Ichabod enters, rushed.

Lady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut.

Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.

Lady Van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the wrist, tight.

Lady Van Tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low.

Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter.  The FRONT

DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING.  Ichabod is panicky.

Ichabod pulls away just as Baltus enters.  Lady Van Tassel

goes back to work as if nothing happened.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

Baltus leads Ichabod to the porch.

Ichabod looks to barn, sees Masbath bringing the horses.  The

CHURCH BELL is HEARD TOLLING far away.

Ichabod studies Baltus, then offers his hand.  They shake.

Ichabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated.  He runs.

Masbath runs to him.  Ichabod takes Gunpowder and climbs up.

They ride, fast.

EXT.  FOREST -- DAY

A conjuring pile of straw burns.  Gloved hands unfold a paper

filled with clippings of human hair.  The hair is sprinkled

on the fire.

A cloaked FIGURE is kneeled at the pile.  The figure turns to

remove A human SKULL from a cloth bag.

The skull is placed at center in the flames.  It's teeth are

sharp, cut to points.  The HORSEMAN'S SKULL.

EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

In the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire.

People inhabit the tents.

INT.  CHURCH, STEENWYCK'S QUARTERS -- MORNING

IN THE CHURCH: it's crowded with families.  Pews filled with

bedding and belongings.  Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE

DOORS of his quarters, turning, angry.

Ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain.

Ichabod walks.  Steenwyck is humiliated.

INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

Pews are packed.  Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar.

EVERYONE QUIETS.  Steenwyck has composed himself, barely.

He sees Ichabod near the back.  THUNDER is HEARD OUTSIDE.

The GATHERERS MURMUR shock.  Ichabod walks out.

EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY

Raining hard.  Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride.

Lady Van Tassel trails.  WOOD is HEARD SPLINTERING...

Just off the road, a tree falls...

The trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank.

The horse falls.  Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt.

Baltus looks back, halting.

Lady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns.

Behind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on

Daredevil, stops.  Calm.  He takes his axe in hand.

EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

Storming.  The meeting is letting out.  Near the churchyard

gate, Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse

cart.  Ichabod walks up as Katrina dismounts.

Ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others.

She touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan

agreements there.

Katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.

He stares at her.  Katrina stares back, in a small way

defeated.  She looks for an out, but there is none.

Many people are starting to notice the confrontation.

Emotions tear at him.  Rain seems to pound down harder.

A TORTURED CRY is HEARD O.S.

Baltus comes charging through the square on his horse.

He's barely hanging on.  He stops, practically falling off,

running towards Katrina and Ichabod.

Baltus grasps Katrina, fearful.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD.

Far behind, the Horseman rides to follow, axe held up.

Instant mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming.

Baltus runs headlong to the church.

Katrina runs after Baltus.  Ichabod backs away, watching the

Horseman come, then heads to the church with Masbath.

Baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining

the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church.

The Horseman rides behind, closing the gap.  Men, women and

children run for cover all along the square.

Amidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back...

The Horseman reaches the open gate and Daredevil suddenly

rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter.

The Horseman grabs Daredevil's reins, tries to move forward

again.  Same result.  Daredevil freaks out.

INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

Baltus makes his way in, shoving.  People are still clamoring

in through the doors.

Men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at

boarded windows.  Women herd children into a cellar.

Baltus searches for a hiding place.  He looks across the

church to see Steenwyck closing the doors of his living

quarters.  Baltus moves...

At the front doors, Katrina squeezes in with Ichabod and

Young Masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed.

It's madness.  People outside begin pounding.

Katrina searches.

Ichabod goes to a window, looking out between boards.

EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

Across the yard, the Horseman gives his axe an underhand toss

to the ground inside the gate.

The AXE instantly BEGINS TO DEGRADE TO DUST in the rain.

The Horseman rides, keeping outside the fence.

INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked

citizens.  He sees Katrina moving up the aisle...

She's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to

Steenwyck's room.

RIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin firing.

EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

The Horseman circles, under fire.

Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church.

Men fire down from the belfry.

Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the

rain as slugs hit without effect.

AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH, the Horseman comes around,

heading to the town square.

INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

Rifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows

to follow the Horseman.

Young Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade.

Baltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a HUGE FARMER

grips Baltus angrily and throws him...

Baltus falls, knocking over pews.  Katrina's nearby.

The huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving

Katrina aside as she approaches.

Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them.

EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- DAY

The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil

of ROPE off a hitching post.

INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

The huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again.

Others join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the

church, shouting.  Ichabod struggles to push them off.

Ichabod gets to Baltus' side, trying to protect.

At the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN turns, crying out.

More panic.  The huge farmer moves towards Baltus.

Baltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing.

EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon.

He halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one

POST which is pointed on top, like an arrow head.

INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

Baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol.

CRASH, the harpoon-like post SPEARS through a window,

trailing rope tied to it...

CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind, the bloodied point

bursting out his breast bone.

Baltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with

both hands.  Blood streams out his mouth.  Katrina screams.

The rope yanks Baltus back.  He SLAMS into the WINDOW...

EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

Baltus CRASHES out, hits the ground, dragged...

Outside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around

his saddle pommel.  The Horseman strides forward, sword out.

Baltus SLAMS the fence and the rope snaps.  He is held there

awkwardly, gurgling blood.

The Horseman reaches Baltus... chops off his head.

INT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS -- DAY

The storm has passed.  Empty forest.  Long, peaceful pause,

till Ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground.

Ichabod comes to look down a small hill.  The corpse of Lady

Van Tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress.

Ichabod walks to the body.  Lady Van Tassel's arm is twisted

behind.  The sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL -- EARLY EVENING

Doctor Lancaster comes out from where Katrina is asleep.  He

closes the door, wipes his sweaty face.  Ichabod waits.

Doctor Lancaster nods.  Ichabod walks.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING

It's getting dark.  Ichabod comes out and crosses the porch.

A few of the Hollow's residents are here.  Young Masbath gets

up and follows Ichabod onto the lawn.

Ichabod walks without waiting.

Ichabod keeps walking.  Young Masbath stops, wounded.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

Ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up.  The whole area

is bright from the light off a giant fire.

There are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized,

twisted tree.  The tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk,

and through every branch to lick the sky.

EXT.  FOREST -- DAY

Dawn.  Ichabod is seated overlooking the Hudson.  He stares

at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes.

Gunpowder is tied to a tree.  BIRDS SING.

The ledger is open in Ichabod's lap.  He thumbs pages

absently, just keeps staring off.

EXT.  FOREST -- DAY (TIME CUT)

A fire burns in a circle of rocks.  Ichabod's ledger is

thrown in.  The pages catch quickly.

Ichabod watches, then walks away.  He's about to climb onto

Gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and

digs out a BOOK.  He walks back to the fire, throws it on...

"Romeo and Juliet."  Flames devour it.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY

The clearing is silent.  The twisted tree still stands,

smoldering, impressive as ever, or perhaps even more so with

the alien appearance its blackened skin now affords it.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Ichabod packs up baggage.  Young Masbath is miserable.

Ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

A coach, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the

orchard.  Van Ripper comes to meet Ichabod and Masbath.

Ichabod hands Van Ripper money.  Van Ripper takes the

baggage.  Ichabod looks to the Manor House.  Only one light

shines, in a second floor window.

Katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains.

Ichabod turns to Young Masbath, who is beginning to cry.

Young Masbath hugs.  Ichabod hugs back, swallowing.

Ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery

unbearable.  He climbs in the coach.

INSIDE THE COACH, Ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes

his eyes.  He pounds twice on the coach wall.

OUTSIDE, Van Ripper whips the reins.  The coach starts.

Young Masbath follows.  The coach picks up speed on the long

straight road.

Young Masbath stops, wiping tears.

EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- NIGHT

Ichabod's coach moves through the town square.  A few people

in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

The door is pushed open.  Young Masbath enters, looks around

the empty room.  He goes to sit in a chair at the work table,

crossing his arms and resting his head.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

A plate of food sits untouched.  Katrina is slumped down in a

chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace.

Behind her, a shadow moves across the room.

EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking

the entrance of Sleepy Hollow.

INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT

Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.  The window

between him and the driver slides open.

Ichabod takes it.  It is the bird/cage spinning toy.  He

studies it.  What melancholy.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

Katrina sits with her eyes closed.  A BOARD is HEARD

CREAKING.  She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind

her as she turns.  WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling.  Young

Masbath takes notice.  He moves to the door...

INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT

Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it.

The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird

appears to be inside the cage.

Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window.

A tear rolls down his cheek.

The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops.

Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans

forward to the window at front.

OUTSIDE THE COACH

Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER -- NIGHT

Young	Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly.

Masbath starts down a hall.  He does not see, in another

room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor.

EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

The coach comes to Lancaster's.  Ichabod climbs out before it

even stops fully, satchel in hand.  He hurries...

INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his

door.  Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern.

INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

Ichabod enters.  There are two coffins on the floor.

Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin.  Lancaster is about

to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted.

Lancaster reluctantly remains.  Ichabod stares at the dead

Lady Van Tassel.  The neck wound is covered by a stained

brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps.

Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the

magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck.

Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand

with the stitched gash on its palm.

Lancaster holds the lens so that Ichabod can study the cut

through it.  Ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his

satchel, lifts the hand and cuts stitches.

THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless.

INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Young Masbath enters.  The door swings shut.

Behind him, the door SLAMS open -- Lady Van Tassel reaches to

grab Young Masbath by the throat.

EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

Ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding.

The door opens and Huge Farmer points a rifle at Ichabod.

Frightened people peer out from behind.

Ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs...

At the DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, Van Ripper is still on the coach.

Ichabod sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol.

Van Ripper hold up a rifle.  Ichabod holds out his hand.

Van Ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over.  Ichabod

immediately points his pistol at Van Ripper.

Van Ripper climbs off.  Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses.

Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up.

EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious.  Gloved hands

reach to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS.

A conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's

heart with an iron nail through it.  Katrina's hair is added

and the pile is lit to burn.

Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands

tied behind his back.

Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied

nearby.  She looks to Katrina, who stirs.

Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over

her shoulder, places the skull in the flames.  THUNDER is

HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

The wind tosses leaves in swirls.  The twisted tree opens

wide, with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out.

EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead.

EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

Katrina sits up, groggy.  Lady Van Tassel looks down at her.

Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.

THUNDER again.  Wind starts to pick up.

Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself

with, feels a rock and clutches it.

She picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT

The Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering

flesh, heading towards a chasm with no bridge.

They reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side.

EXT.  LONG STRAIGHT ROAD/VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

Ichabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard.

EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

Lady Van Tassel admires the skull.

Lady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face.

Seeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina,

Masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

Ichabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch.

EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

ICHABOD is HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished.

Katrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the

head, a glancing blow that knocks her down.  Katrina runs.

Katrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up...

But, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws

her back to the ground.

Lady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her

forehead, bleeding, pissed.

Young Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams

into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards.

Katrina runs and pulls Masbath up.  They flee.

Lady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned.

EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

Ichabod comes out the open front doors... hearing...

Ichabod climbs back on the coach, taking off.

EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

Katrina and Young Masbath run out from a line of trees.

BEHIND IN THE FOREST, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse,

in no hurry.  Wind kicks hard.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD.

ON THE LAWN, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath.

Behind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the

Horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair.

At mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath.

With Katrina and Masbath on board, Ichabod turns the coach.

Katrina unties Masbath's hands.  HOOFBEATS GET LOUDER.

Ichabod looks back towards Lady Van Tassel.

At the treeline, the Horseman breaks into the open, hell on

horseback.  Full speed ahead.

EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

The coach hits the long straight road, away from the house.

Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently.

Behind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road.

Closing fast.  Breakneck pace.

Masbath takes a lantern, crawls back to the roof.

He ignores, reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the

lantern at the Horseman.  It smashes on the trail.

Young Masbath slides back.  Katrina helps him.

Young Masbath takes them.  Ichabod slings Van Ripper's rifle

over his shoulder and starts back.  Katrina grips him.

She releases.  Ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear,

struggling to open a storage box.

Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer.

Ichabod opens the box, hefting out a long, jagged SAW.

Ichabod looks.  The Horseman rides up, swinging...

Ichabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed by sword.

The Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the

other side of the trail... coming along side.

Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath.

Masbath guides the horses over.  The Horseman must fall

behind to avoid the wheels.

The coach hits a large, fallen tree trunk.

Ichabod bounces, falling...

He hangs off the side of the coach.

Katrina climbs to offer her hand.  Ichabod offers the saw.

Katrina takes the saw.  Now with both hands, Ichabod tries

for better purchase.  He grips the coach door.  It opens...

Ichabod clings to the open door as branches slam him.

He's reaching to the coach threshold, reaching...

Ichabod pulls himself inside.

BOOM -- the door hits a tree trunk, bashed to pieces.

Ichabod looks out from the coach, dazed.  He climbs.

Katrina looks back as Young Masbath guides the coach to block

the Horseman again.

The Horseman sheaths his sword, riding... reaching to grip

the back corner of the coach.

The Horseman dismounts, clinging, climbing...

Ichabod takes the rifle off his shoulder, aiming...

BANG! -- splattering the Horseman's hand point blank.  The

Horseman hangs on with his other hand.

The Horseman re-grips with the blasted hand, amazing since

it's now all mush and bone.

Ichabod throws the rifle on his way to the driver's perch,

taking the saw from Katrina.

Katrina looks to the horses, then at Ichabod.

Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath.

Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits.  The

Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword.

Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the

coach to the bridles, puts out his hand.  Katrina takes it.

Behind, the Horseman swings.  Ichabod blocks with the saw.

Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse.

Bareback.  Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her.

The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from

Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back...

Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear

life.  His feet drag on the trail.

Above, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough

to kill Katrina.  He raises his sword...

Katrina screams, ducking, helpless...

Below, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod.

He shoves off with his feet.

The Horseman swings.... missing.

The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along.

The coach careens out of control.

It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off,

throwing the Horseman.

The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES.

FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop.  Young Masbath

and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting,

clutching his previously wounded shoulder.

Ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail.  The trail

behind is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD.

They start moving.  Ichabod looks around.  He sees...

Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be

seen against the sky.  Katrina and Young Masbath run.

EXT. WINDMILL FIELD -- NIGHT

Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area,

heading to the windmill.  Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes.

Ichabod looks over his shoulder.

Heavy, low hanging BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge

creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel.

The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake.

The Horseman readies a battle axe.

Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the

ladder and in.  Katrina next.

The Horseman is almost there.

Ichabod follows Katrina.  He gets in, feet dangling.  The

Horseman dismounts...

INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door...

slams it.  He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits.

The door buckles.

Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.  He

struggles to roll it.

Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.  It falls

on top with a thud.  The Horseman's sword jabs up through the

grindstone's center hole.

The sword withdraws.  A POUNDING begins.

EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

The Horseman chops at the door with his axe.

INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

POUNDING CONTINUES.  The grindstone shifts.  Katrina and

Young Masbath back away.  Ichabod holds his lantern up,

desperate for ideas, searching.

Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is

ground and bagged.  To the left is the crooked staircase.

Ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming.  He gives

his lantern to Katrina and points.

Katrina and Young Masbath obey.  Ichabod crosses and climbs

the ladder to the milling platform.  He grasps a wooden

lever, pulling it.  Gears above begin to turn.

EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

The windmill's rotors CREAK to life, spinning.

UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping.  His axe

exposes grindstone, throwing sparks.

INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

Katrina looks down from the stairs.

The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door.

Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of

the milling platform.

ABOVE, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the

door to the roof.

BELOW, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled

grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust.

He grabs one open bag and dumps it.  More grain dust.

EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

Masbath and Katrina come out.  Rotors spin behind them.

INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

Ichabod sees below... the Horseman sticks a hand through,

trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing.  The

RACKING axe continues.  Won't be long.

Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with

effort, throws...

The bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door...

EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

The grindstone falls through, SLAMMING the Horseman down...

INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system.

More and more dust rises.

Below, the Horseman enters.  Katrina shouts from above.

The Horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder,

but Ichabod grabs it, pulling it up...

The Horseman just misses the final rung.

Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off.

Ichabod looks to the staircase.  No way to climb down from

the milling platform and get there.

The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain...

The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging...

Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps...

Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely.

The rail creaks, about to break.  Behind, the Horseman lands

on the milling platform.

Ichabod is losing grip.  Young Masbath races down the stairs,

grabs his hand.  He pulls Ichabod up.

Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls.

Ichabod and Young Masbath look...

The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the

milling platform and leaps...

Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and

Masbath.  Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it...

The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below.

Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs.

EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

Katrina helps them onto the roof.

INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

The Horseman runs, agile, up stairs.

EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where

the rotors spin close.

Ichabod moves back to the trap door.

Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the

long distance between them and the ground.

Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs.

INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

The Horseman continues up.  The lantern falls past.

EXT.  WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT

Young Masbath jumps.  Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps...

They hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth.  The

rotor begins its downwards swing.

INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

The lantern hits the ground and shatters.  FLAMES EXPLODE!

Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR

upwards, filling the windmill...

Engulfing the Horseman.

EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

The rotor is halfway to its lowest point.  Masbath, Katrina

and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles.

BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams,

lighting up the night.

On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame

with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina.

Masbath drops.  Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops.

They hit the ground.  Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his

shoulder.  They all look at each other in disbelief a moment.

Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing.

Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill.  Running.

Lightning flashes across the sky.  THUNDER RUMBLES.

A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES...

SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING.  The rotors bust apart.  Splinters of

burning wood spin all directions.

ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep

running.  There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead.

IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off

burning debris.  His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.

ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices

something horrible...

In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free.

Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady

Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank...

SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down.

Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her.

Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only

to find it empty.  He moves forward.

She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck.

Katrina ceases struggling.

Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance.  Lady

Van Tassel shoots a glance...

Par off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage.

Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving

against it.

The cart rolls downhill.  Ichabod moves forward.

Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and

missing.  Ichabod backs off.

DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman.

The Horseman starts running to meet it.

UPHILL, Lady Van Tassel grins.

Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing.  Ichabod avoids, puts all

his fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face.

Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open,

sending the Horseman's skull rolling out...

The skull rolls... rolls... landing far away.

DOWNHILL, Katrina leaps out from the cart...

She lands hard...

The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move.

UPHILL, Ichabod sees the skull.  He runs towards it.

Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle.  He falls.

DOWNHILL, Katrina runs back.  The Horseman is catching up.

UPHILL, Ichabod tries to pull f ree from Lady Van Tassel.

Young Masbath comes behind her - BAM - hits her in the head

with the wooden plank.  She's out.

Ichabod scrambles to his feet.

DOWNHILL, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the

hair as she falls to her knees and screams.

UPHILL, Ichabod runs... grasps the Horseman's skull.

He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina.

DOWNHILL, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready

by her hair... raises his sword...

UPHILL, Ichabod throws the skull...

The skull spins through the air...

The Horseman drops Katrina, reaches up...

Catches the skull.

Katrina runs.

Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls, exhausted.

Together, they back away from the Horseman.

The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his

shoulders, to its rightful place.  THUNDER POUNDS.

TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the

Horseman's throat and grip the skull.

Young Masbath drops the plank, watching in awe.

The Horseman's reformation continues.  Muscle forms.  Liquids

become solids.  He is made whole once more, the same evil,

human face we saw in Baltus' stories.

He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.

Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING.  The Horseman replaces his

sward and climbs into the saddle.

He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by.

They are so exhausted they fall down.

Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the

Horseman does not want him either.

The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious

form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back.

He rides away with her.

Ichabod and Katrina watch him go.  They look at each other,

then kiss gratefully.

Ichabod looks to Young Masbath.

Ichabod smiles and holds out his arm.  Masbath comes over.

Group hug.  Lightning brightens the farmland around them.

EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, BURIAL GROUND -- NIGHT

HOOFBEATS.  The Horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand

on Lady Van Tassel.  Ahead, the twisted tree awaits.

Lady Van Tassel is awakening, face bloody.  She turns her

head and looks forward.  She screams.

The twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing.

Daredevil picks up speed...

Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,

striking the Horseman.

For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS

OF LIGHT, entering the tree.

Silence and smoke.  At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand

sticks out from the tight-shut suture.

The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood.

EXT.  NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

A bright, busy day in New York.  A coach pulls up to

Ichabod's home.  Ichabod is the driver.  He gets off, goes

and opens the coach door.  He helps Katrina down.  Next,

Young Masbath sticks his head out.

Ichabod goes about unloading bags.  Katrina holds Young

Masbath's hand, and they look down the street in wonder.

THE END
