"BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA"

by

Mike Judge and Joe Stillman

and running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from

what seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building

debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines

coming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much

like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the

footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more

intense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS

SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan

up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-

shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a

huge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt-

Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and

buildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh."

He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head

swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and

stomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head

reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a

lot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in

his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman

screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few

lame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh

huh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head,

"Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames.

We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice

giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank

around. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT

BEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more

destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire).

Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head

puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling

the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.

Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking

him.

INT.  B&B'S HOME - DAY

Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch. Beavis shakes him.

Butt-Head comes around.

Beavis is making STRANGE NOISES, in a state of shock.

Butt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the TV

was.

Out the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&B's TV into their

van.

Still on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We

see a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open.

Butt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN

DOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this

a couple of times - piecing it all together.

Beavis is still in shock. They both stare at the empty space where

the TV was for a beat, not quite sure what to do.

Beavis is SHAKING AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES. He presses buttons on

the remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

Bad neighborhood. 70's music blares.

A fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in

fear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms,

chain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes

off his glasses.

FREEZE ON BEAVIS

FRAME UNFREEZES. Beavis whips out a huge gun.

An attacker comes from one side. Beavis uses Judo. Another tosses

a knife. Beavis ducks, then shoots with two hands, police style.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Swinger's pad. Totally 70's. A group of bikini'd girls on a

waterbed. Butt-Head approaches them. He wears a leisure suit,

collar way open. He plops down in the bed.

FREEZE ON BUTT-HEAD

FRAME UNFREEZES. The girls wrap their arms around him.

MAIN TITLE - FULL FRAME

EXT.  CITY STREETS - DAY/NIGHT

ACTION MONTAGE BEGINS. Styled like a 70's cop show opening.

OPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits

would.

Beavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun.

Butt-Head slaps a pimp.

Beavis drives, chasing a car.

Butt-Head is slapped by a girl.

Beavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out.

A black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&B.

B&B dive for cover just before a building explodes.

In CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot.

Butt-Head does the same.

Beavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge.

A beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head.

FINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into

bed. Suddenly...

INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY/DOOR TO A.V. ROOM - DAY

From inside, SOUND of equipment crashing.

B&B come out wheeling a TV on one of those carts. There are cables

attached to it still leading back into the A.V. room. As they push

the cart we hear more equipment falling.

They give it one big push and it finally breaks free. We see that

the cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which

all come crashing to the ground.

INT.  SCHOOL/ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY

MR. VAN DRIESSEN stops B&B.

Van Driessen leaves. B&B continue to wheel the cart home.

EXT.  SCHOOL/STAIRWAY - DAY

B&B arrive with the cart at the top of a stairway. They lamely

attempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy

and goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.

B&B stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage.

PRINCIPAL McVICKER shows up by the TV.

B&B walk off laughing.

EXT.  THE ANDERSON'S DRIVEWAY - DUSK

B&B walk up. There's a camper in the driveway.

B&B walk up to the camper and start to open the door just as MARCY

ANDERSON opens it. (As usual, she doesn't recognize them.)

B&B walk into the camper. Marcy stays outside.

EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - SAME TIME

Tom is adjusting the trailer-hitch. Marcy watches.

Through the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of B&B

AIR/MOUTH-GUITARING "IRON MAN."

INT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK

B&B watch a "Cops"-type show. Beavis gets up, goes to the

refrigerator and grabs a soda. The refrigerator is under the

counter on which the TV is sitting.

Beavis takes a sip and then does a SPIT TAKE, SPRAYING SODA ALL

OVER THE TOP OF THE TV.

ANGLE ON TV: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the inside of the

TV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX. The TV

goes dead.

EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK

B&B come out. Tom notices them.

Tom adjusts his glasses as he looks at B&B.

TOM'S BLURRY P.O.V.: We see B&B out of focus.

ANGLE ON BEAVIS: looking particularly guilty, eyes shifting back

and forth.

B&B walk off, leaving Tom wondering.

EXT.  STREET IN A SEEDY PART OF TOWN - JUST BEFORE DAWN

B&B are having TV withdrawal. Butt-Head is bug-eyed. Beavis has

the shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight

Cowboy."

Butt-Head stops short. He looks up. His face is bathed in a

golden, throbbing light.

BUTT-HEAD'S P.O.V.: We see a flashing neon sign that says, "TV".

Pull back to show B&B are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge,

featuring "Color TV" and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap

Rates."

B&B stare up, as if at a god.

EXT.  MOTEL COURT - CONTINUOUS

Butt-Head tries the first door. It's locked. He tries the second

door. It's locked. He tries the third door. It opens.

B&B's eyes bulge. Inside, PRINCIPAL McVICKER is lying across the

legs of an obvious prostitute, his pants pulled down. She SPANKS

him.

B&B LAUGH. McVicker hears and looks up.

Butt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards

the next door. The muffled sound of a SPANK can be heard followed

by McVicker asking for another.

INT.  MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The only light in the room is a flickering TV. Sitting on the bed,

talking on the phone is MUDDY. He's a tough, mean looking red-neck

- a Jack Ruby type.

On the nightstand next to him is a three-quarter drunk bottle of

bourbon and a manila envelope. On his lap is a big gun.

We hear a knock on the door and muffled B&B laughs.

B&B walk in. Muddy turns on the light.

MUDDY'S P.O.V.: B&B are a drunken blur.

Butt-Head stares in shock.

Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis and pulls him aside.

ANGLE ON THE BED. Muddy slaps down a picture of DALLAS, his wife.

Leather clad, biker, beautiful.

Muddy plunks down PLANE TICKETS.

Muddy picks up the gun and SHOOTS the TV.

EXT.  CITY STREETS - MORNING

Muddy driving his loud four-by-four like a maniac, drunk with

bloodshot eyes. B&B are in the back seat. He eyes them through the

rearview. Meanwhile, a cat bounces off the windshield with a

SHRIEK.

Muddy swigs the last swallow from his bottle of bourbon.

EXT.  AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

In an overhead view, the four-by-four screeches up to the gate,

fishtails to a stop, throwing B&B onto the sidewalk, and peels

away.

INT.  AIRPLANE - DAY

B&B enter the plane. They sit down in the first two seats on the

right - in First Class. A flight attendant, DOLORIS approaches

them.

Doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the

aisle.

ANGLE DOWN AISLE in coach. Doloris stops by a row where an elderly

woman, MARTHA, sits by the window. Next to her: Two empty seats.

She gestures to the seats and leaves. Beavis climbs in the middle,

Butt-Head in the aisle - still watching Doloris.

Martha, her senses a bit dimmed from age, turns to B&B.

B&B see Doloris, stepping nearby to demonstrate the seat belt.

Doloris demonstrates. B&B are dumbfounded. It's too complicated.

They struggle to make their seat belts fit, getting each other's

parts.

Butt-Head looks up.

From his P.O.V. we see a beautiful woman, TAMMY, smiling, her

hands reaching down. FALLING IN LOVE/HARP MUSIC STING plays.

CLOSE on Butt-Head's lap as two female hands reach down and pull

one strap from between Butt-Head's legs.

Butt-Head looks down at his lap as Tammy leans over him. A loud

CLICKING can be heard. Butt-Head stares blankly.

Suddenly Martha buckles Beavis' belt. Tammy goes.

The engines start to hum. The plane is rolling.

Butt-Head struggles to get his seat belt off. He does everything

but pull the handle. Beavis goes white with fear.

The plane starts to shake. The engines rumble. Beavis starts to

freak.

Butt-Head bangs away at his seat belt. Beavis looks out the window

and realizes they're in the air.

ANGLE ON COUPLE IN FRONT OF B&B:

ANGLE ON CABIN, people start screaming. The plane quakes, lifting

up.

ON BUTT-HEAD, furiously pulling:

The plane arcs upward. Butt-Head finally gets the belt off as the

plane is in full thrust. He rises and goes tumbling backward down

the aisle.

ON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic.

In free fall:

Butt-Head grabs the door to the hangable luggage. It all comes

tearing out.

Butt-Head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which

open and spill their contents.

Butt-Head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and

coffee to pour freely.

ON THE CABIN as the plane starts to level out. People stop their

screaming.

ON BUTT-HEAD, underneath the rubble, poking his head out. He's

directly across from the flight attendant station where Tammy is

strapped in.

INT.  PLANE - LATER

All's in order. Flight attendants roll the beverage cart up the

aisle. People read, relaxed.

ON BEAVIS AND MARTHA. Martha is showing pictures of her

grandchildren. Beavis is showing the picture of Dallas that Muddy

gave him.

She hands him a box of NoDrowz.

He pours the contents into his hand and chews them like candy.

Then his eyes open wide.

Beavis starts wolfing them down.

INT.  PLANE - A BIT LATER

Tammy passes out meals from a rolling cart. She works with

Doloris. Butt-head stands behind Tammy, attempting to hit on her.

Tammy ignores him and moves on, leaving Butt-Head there.

ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, looking down at something.

PAN DOWN to reveal he's looking at a BEER on a fat guy's tray. The

guy's asleep.

Butt-head picks up the beer.

ANGLE ON BEAVIS, nearby. The NoDrowz is starting to take effect.

Beavis starts shaking, babbling, staring cross-eyed at his fist,

etc. (pre-Cornholio stuff)

Tammy reaches her next passenger.

Tammy moves forward, leaving Butt-Head standing there. In the

background, we see Beavis starting to quake, on the verge of

Cornholio mode.

ANGLE ON BEAVIS: Turned, facing the cabin, T-shirt pulled over his

head in full Cornholio mode.

Beavis starts to wander down the aisle.

ANGLE ON CURTAIN TO FIRST CLASS CABIN. Beavis enters. From the

other side, SOUND of screams. We hear several CALL BUTTONS being

pressed.

ON BUTT-HEAD. He approaches Tammy from behind. She ignores him.

ANGLE INSIDE THE COCKPIT.

The PILOTS are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit

slams open. Beavis is in the doorway SCREAMING.

The pilots SCREAM. The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee

to spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap. The captain

then jumps up, hitting the controls and SENDING THE PLANE INTO A

NOSE-DIVE.

ON BUTT-HEAD

In the back of the plane standing next to Tammy. He starts to take

a sip of beer. The nose-dive of the plane causes Butt-Head to go

FLYING TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE PLANE.

Butt-Head bounces all overthe plane and then gets tangled up in

the curtain that separates first class and coach. It tears off,

and he continues to fly forward.

COCKPIT

The captain is desperately trying to regain control of the plane.

Butt-Head slams into the cockpit, landing on the control panel

facing the captain.

The captain throws Butt-Head back behind him and pulls the plane

out of the dive.

EXT.  LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - EARLY EVENING

The plane lands.

INT.  COCKPIT DOOR - EARLY EVENING

The flight attendants, shaken, smile at a line of people

deplaning. The people are white with fear, some covered with

flecks of spilled food and other matter.

They grow silent and still as B&B pass by. Beavis takes the T-

shirt off his head, coming down from Cornholio.

INT.  TERMINAL/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY

Arriving passengers are greeted. A family is reunited. Two

businessmen walk up to limo drivers holding cards with their

names. A reunited couple hugs.

B&B look around in confusion.

People greet and walk away. The place starts to clear out.

One limo driver is left standing. He wears sunglasses and holds a

sign that reads: Beavis and Butt-Head.

B&B look around. Except for the driver, they're alone.

B&B go up to him. Butt-Head turns around, drops his pants and

hangs a "B.A." at the guy.

He indicates the sign. Butt-Head turns around and pulls up his

pants. They look and try to read:

The limo driver rolls his eyes and walks away.

B&B follow the driver away. Beavis looks around.

EXT.  MUDDY'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

HARLAN and ROSS, the two dumb-looking rough-necks that stole B&B's

TV are standing outside Muddy's motel room. Harlan knocks on the

door.

Harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered TV. No

one's there.

Muddy's four-by-four SQUEALS into the lot and skids to a stop next

to Harlan and Ross' van. Muddy gets out, looking really drunk now.

Muddy grabs Ross by the collar.

Muddy tosses Ross to the sidewalk and starts back to they four-by-

four.

Muddy gets in the four-by-four and starts it.

Harlan and Ross seem momentarily confused.

Muddy revs the engine, peels out backwards HITTING THE FRONT OF

THE VAN. This causes B&B's TV and some other loot to spill out the

back onto the sidewalk.

Ross starts to pick it up.

EXT.  LAS VEGAS - DAY

MONTAGE SONG BEGINS.

The car passes by major hotels and tourist sights, finally pulling

up to a big luxurious hotel and casino.

INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DAY

Establishing shots. Excitement. Gambling tables going on forever.

ON THE LOUNGE BAND playing the song we've been hearing. They

should vaguely resemble the actual band doing the song.

PAN DOWN rows of slot machines.

PAN ACROSS DEALERS handling cards and chips.

DOLLY RIGHT UP TO B&B, staring in utter awe.

REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS: They're staring at a huge Roman statue of a

bare-chested woman.

Their faces are blank. They're seeing God. Finally:

EXT.  VEGAS - DUSK

Lights are popping on.

Billboards and signs are lighting up.

The whole strip is coming alive. Pure excitement.

INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DUSK

ON B&B, still staring at the statue.

A security guard comes and drags B&B away.

ON THE LOUNGE BAND, continuing the song we've been hearing.

INT.  B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The door is opened by a bellboy.

Beavis rushes in and grabs the remote which is attached to the

night table. He tries to pull it up and can't.

They both struggle to pull it up. Finally, they fall over

backwards.

Annoyed, the bellboy leaves.

INT.  ELEVATOR BANK/9TH FLOOR - NIGHT

The elevator arrives. B&B get on. There's several sophisticated

people. From inside, a computerized FEMALE ELEVATOR VOICE:

The sophisticated people look repulsed. The doors close.

INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT

MUSIC DIPS DOWN FOR DIALOGUE. B&B step off the elevator and walk

among the gambling tables.

Beavis pulls one of the playing chips out of his pocket and bites

into it.

Beavis tosses the chip on a roulette table.

ANGLE ON THE WHEEL. The ball lands on 13.

At the table, the DEALER...

The wheel stops.

People oooh and aaah. More gather to watch.

Through the gathering throng comes CHERYL, a hooker.

B&B freeze, shocked.

B&B don't move. The dealer rolls again.

Cheryl puts her hands on their thighs.

B&B's eyes open wide.

The wheel stops.

She leaves. People scatter. B&B are left alone. Staring.

WIDE SHOT. B&B just stand, laughing.

MUSIC FADES BACK UP...

INT.  HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON THE BAND, continuing the song.

Tourists watch from tables - decidedly not rocking out.

B&B dance alone near the stage, doing the "butt-knocker."

INT.  HOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT

A WOMAN ATTENDANT answers the phone.

From the phone...

The woman's disturbed.

INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT

B&B try to climb up and grab the gigantic boobs of the statue.

Butt-Head falls, knocks Beavis off and they both hit the floor

hard.

INT.  B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Beavis is on the phone in the main room. Butt-Head sits on the

toilet and speaks from the phone in the bathroom.

INT.  HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT

B&B keep dancing as the famous BAND plays the MONTAGE SONG which

ENDS.

EXT.  VEGAS - DAWN

Sunrise.

The song rings out.

INT.  B&B'S ROOM - MORNING

BEavis is picking up the night table by the remote attached to it

and moving the whole thing.

Butt-Head approaches a door next to the bed.

Beavis comes over to check it out. Butt-Head opens the door. It's

one of those double doors to the next room.

Butt-Head tries to open the second door, jiggling it.

Suddenly, the door opens. Someone reaches out and pulls B&B

inside. It's DALLAS, the girl Muddy sent them after.

INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

She has them pinned against the wall. DALLAS is hot, clad in tight

leather, tattooed, pierced, sexy.

Dallas grabs Butt-Head by the shirt.

Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis, bringing him to his senses.

From outside, SOUND of a police siren. Dallas goes to the window.

The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars.

Dallas goes into the next room and closes the door.

B&B look at each other. They start to take their pants off.

INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY

Dallas gets binoculars from her bag and scouts outside.

Her P.O.V. REVEALS dozens of police and A.T.F. cars. The hotel's

surrounded.

As Dallas looks around, she spots a tour bus across the street. On

the side: "Dream America Tours." Dallas quickly dials the phone.

Dallas dials again, crossing to the door to peek out at B&B - both

standing in their underwear, waiting. Beavis picks his nose.

Dallas closes the door again.

INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY

B&B are in their underwear. Butt-Head sits at the edge of the bed.

Beavis tries to pull the remote off the table.

Dallas enters, sees this sight, and shuts off the TV. She looms

over Butt-Head.

B&B start to wrestle. Dallas sees Beavis' pants.

Butt-Head grabs Beavis' neck.

She picks up the pants, getting an idea.

She takes the pants into the next room. B&B keep wrestling.

INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY

TIGHT ON her black satchel. From it she lifts a delicate

electronic device, the X-5 unit, about the size of a credit card.

An LED light blinks.

Using her switchbalde, she cuts a hole in the back seam of Beavis'

pants, creating a natural pocket. She carefully slides the unit

in.

INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY

B&B's fight escalates. Butt-Head picks up a LAMP and throws it at

Beavis. It hits the wall and SHATTERS. Beavis charges Butt-Head.

INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY

Dallas is licking a piece of thread. She quickly and expertly

threads a needle and then starts to sew the electronic device into

the inside back of Beavis' pants. She suddenly wrinkles her nose

as if she has smelled something.

She holds the pants up to the light. Inside, the shadow of the

unit.

INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY

B&B fight wildly. Dallas enters and clears her throat. B&B freeze.

FULL ON DALLAS, posed sexily, seductive.

Dallas clears her throat to get their attention. And again.

Silence.

Silence. They're in shock.

She looks back to the window, now all business.

INT.  HOTEL LOBBY/FRONT DOOR - DAY

A.T.F. agents enter and spread out. We see several agents go up

the stairs.

INT.  DALLAS' ROOM/DOORWAY - DAY

She kisses them both seductively.

She shuts the door, leaving B&B outside. Nearby, a maid with her

cart passes by.

B&B stare, frozen for a beat, then go running for the elevator.

ANGLE AROUND THE CORNER, out of B&B's view. Just as the elevator

doors shut, dozens of federal agents with guns rush in and kick

open Dallas' door.

EXT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DAY

More Feds and police enter.

ANGLE ON B&B, walking past, oblivious to all else. As he walks

away, Beavis rubs his butt.

They walk to the tour bus across the street.

INT.  TOUR BUS - DAY

B&B walk down the aisle, Beavis rubbing his butt. Most seats are

taken by senior citizens.

Up ahead, two vacant seats. B&B fight to get in first.

They turn. It's Martha, the woman from the plane, sitting across

the aisle.

JIM, an old guy, wakes up and looks over.

All the seniors turn around to meet them.

EXT.  TOUR BUS - DAY

It takes off.

We PAN back to the hotel as Muddy arrives in a cab.

INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE DALLAS' ROOM - DAY

DRAMATIC REVEAL of AGENT RYAN FLEMMING entering the hallway. He's

an A.T.F. honcho, powerful, hard-ass. Looks like an Oliver North-

type. Sounds something like Fred Thompson. He walks with his

assistant, AGENT BORK and another agent.

They find Dallas' room and enter.

INT.  DALLAS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Dallas sits calmly, confident, as agents tear apart the room.

ANGLE ON AGENT HURLEY, a tough, stocky woman.

talk and approach the HOOVER GUIDE, speaking nearby.

They follow the tour into the next room.

INT.  HOOVER DAM/OBSERVATION ROOM - DUSK

A glass wall separates this from the master control room. There,

two technicians are on watch. Banks of monitors show the water and

pipes from various angles.

B&B are the last in. Beavis rubs his aching butt. The guide is

already speaking.

The tour moves on.

They walk back from where they came.

Through the glass wall, we see the two control room technicians

heading out.

INT.  HOOVER DAM/HALL OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM DOOR - DUSK

SOUND of air compression as this secure door opens. The two

technicians walk out.

causing the lights to blink on and off.

Butt-Head looks at the bank of monitors - all showing water.

Butt-Head starts randomly hitting controls everywhere while Beavis

rubs his butt against a computer keypad.

drives down a different road.

EXT.  ROAD - DUSK

The bus heads off into the desert.

DISSOLVE TO:

Disaster.

Several A.T.F. cars pull up. Flemming and several of his agents

get out and head immediately for the dam.

INT.  HOOVER DAM/CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

TIGHT ON A TV MONITOR. It shows B&B at the Hoover Dam controls the

looking particularly stupid.

REVEAL Flemming's there with his agents. Flemming leans forward.

ON MONITOR. The device that was put in back of Beavis' pants.

ON THE MONITOR. Army recruits coughing up black gunk, rolling

The geyser erupts. The seniors watch in sheer awe.

INT.  VISITOR CENTER/MEN'S BATHROOM - DAY

frame, look lost. They're parched, weak.

ANGLE FROM OVERHEAD. Lost, alone, B&B wobble like they haven't

long to live. Overhead, vultures circle.

ANGLE ON B&B, exhausted, spent. Staring ahead, Butt-Head suddenly

sees something.

Beavis clears his eyes and sees it too.

Excited, saved, they rush weakly forward.

B&B'S P.O.V. REVEALS they rush to: A GIANT BIG SCREEN TV.

As they get closer it disappears - just a mirage.

ANGLE ON SUN, brightening. The FRAME WHITES OUT.

EXT.  ROADBLOCK - DAY

EXT.  B&B'S TOWN/STREETS - DAY

away. Flemming turns menacingly to McVicker.

Bork rushes up to Flemming with a paper.

TIGHT ON PHOTO. It's the DUMB GUY and DUMBER GUY from the desert.

Flemming takes the paper and marches off. Others follow.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  DESERT - NIGHT

B&B and the Dumn abd Dumber Guys are sitting around a campfire.

The Dumb Guy looks like an older, more stupid, version of Butt-

Head. The Dumber Guy is a couple of evolutionary scales down from

Beavis. Their relationship is an exaggerated version of B&B's.

Butt-Head is staring at the Dumb Guy in admiration. Beavis, like

the Dumber Guy, appears to be just staring at the fire,

hypnotized. Dumb Guy is eating spaghetti out of a can.

Dumb Guy punches Dumber Guy in the head with a closed fist.

Dumb Guy gets up, turns his butt towards the fire and starts to

drop his pants.

EXT.  DESERT/LONG SHOT - CONTINUOUS

The campfire is in the distance, middle of nowhere. A flatulant

sound is heard. Suddenly, a big beautiful purple and orange

fireball erupts, lighting up the sky.

EXT.  DESERT - MORNING

B&B wake up. The Dumb Guy and Dumber Guy are gone. The sun is

scorching.

B&B inch forward - spent, dehydrated, near death.

ANGLE ON GROUND as B&B collapse into frame. Butt-Head looks up at

the sun, squinting.

A vulture picks at Beavis' shirt. Beavis SMACKS the vulture.

The vulture moves revealing a PEYOTE CACTUS. Beavis looks at it.

Beavis takes a bite of the cactus, chews and then coughs.

IN FRONT OF B&B: Two vultures start humping.

EXT.  ROADBLOCK - DAY

START ON SUN - over B&B?

REVEAL it's over Muddy who looks at a picture of B&B held by an

A.T.F. agent.

Muddy takes off with a smile and turns off onto a side road.

EXT.  DESERT - LATER

B&B barely crawling forward. Butt-Head stops, then Beavis. They're

barely able to talk.

BUTT-HEAD'S VISION. Through time-lapse dissolves we see him

sitting on his couch with Beavis, laughing like an idiot in the

exact same positions at age 2, 5, 7, 10, 13.

TIGHT ON BEAVIS:

BEAVIS' VISION: Beavis as a sperm cell swimming through a uterus.

It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it.

Beavis/Sperm swims over to the egg.

With its own tail the Beavis/Sperm starts picking its nose.

Several other sperm charge in, knocking Beavis into the egg. His

conception looks like a dumb accident.

BACK ON BEAVIS:

Animated bubbles appear around Beavis' head.

BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors

start shifting.

Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder.

THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It

could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the

lower left hand corner.

I would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of

something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This

is the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you...

fire!"

The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but

I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White

Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.)

BEAVIS' P.O.V.:

We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire.

The ball of fire develops a face and speaks.

THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball

of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini.

At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in

bikinis and various images of B&B's TV in all its glory.

As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass

of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&B head-banging, weird

stuff from my high school notebooks, etc.

At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform.

As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the

surreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as

maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the

movie.)

Then, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&B's near-dead

bodies.

The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&B. REVEAL they were not

far from the side of a road all along.

B&B snap out of it. They rise and find Muddy hovering over them

with a shotgun.

Muddy aims his shotgun at B&B.

B&B think.

Muddy lowers the gun a bit.

Muddy pops it open. B&B climb in. Muddy closes the trunk on them

and walks to the front of the car. HOLD ON THE TRUNK.

Muddy peels out.

EXT.  MUDDY'S CAR DRIVING ON HIGHWAY - DAY

ANGLE OUTSIDE MUDDY'S TRUNK. From within we hear:

Pumping up the jack, they cause the lid of the trunk to start to

bend.

Suddenly, it pops open. B&B are a sweaty mess. They gasp.

They look out. The road behind them races past at 80 mph. Beavis

stares dumbly.

Butt-Head shoves Beavis out of the car.

Beavis tries to run, but hits the road and flips over and over -

and smashes his butt.

His body stops in the middle of the road. A huge truck, about to

hit him, swerves and jackknifes over the side.

Behind the truck, several cars screech to a halt, one smashing

into the other.

ANGLE ON MUDDY'S TRUNK

Butt-Head looks at the road.

ANGLE ON MUDDY'S TIRE. It hits a pothole.

ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, shooting out of the trunk, he grabs onto the

lid. He bounces against the road again and again.

Finally, he loses his grip as the lid to the trunk closes.

ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, rolling along the highway.

A car, about to hit Butt-Head, screeches to a halt. Other cars

behind it smash and pile up.

ANGLE ON ROAD SOME WAYS BACK. On Tom and Marcy in their car.

The car ahead of Tom crashes into the car ahead of that. Tom

crashes into it. And the car behind crashes into Tom.

OVERHEAD ANGLE shows cars and trucks behind, crashing, piling up.

A massive pile-up.

INT.  MUDDY'S CAR - DAY

Muddy doesn't notice the mess behind him. He drives on.

them, a TV is on with the reporter continuing. Behind the

reporter, B&B poke their heads into frame at 45 degree angles,

looking like deer in the headlights.

Bork notices B&B on TV and taps Flemming on the shoulder. Flemming

looks.

Flemming looks at the big map which traces sightings of B&B across

America.

He looks again at the TV. On the news, a story about...

Flemming looks back at the map, and then back at the TV.

The President hands them citations.

B&B leave the office, muttering.

EXT.  AIRPORT NEAR B&B'S HOMETOWN - DAY

A plane lands.

INT.  PLANE/DOOR - DAY

As before, the flight crew stares in horror and silence as B&B

deplane.

EXT.  ELITE MOTEL LODGE BAR - DAY

Walking home, B&B pass the motel. They notice the sign for big

screen TV. They stop and look at it.

ON BEAVIS, seeing something, amazed, ecstatic.

Heavenly MUSIC. B&B stare at the wonder before them.

ANGLE ON THEIR TV, mangled, partly-crushed junk.

B&B run up to the set like it was their lost and found dog.

EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

B&B walk off into the distance with the TV.

B&B head off into the sunset, trading lame insults as we FADE OUT.
