SEQ. 75 - PROLOGUE

A cave painting of the Dreamworks logo. Push past the

moon to the sun. Bright. Beautiful. The sun DISSOLVES

Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to

know them as The Croods.

The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for

food. Scared. Fast.

The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They

escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.

The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They

escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.

Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL.

A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his

family home.

2.

They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock

door closed.

SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this

time the light casts an ominous tone.

RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND.

HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY.

SHOTS OF CATACLYSM. CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL...

CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall. They PUSH. A

BLINDING LIGHT FLOODS the screen.

SEQ. 100 - MEET THE CROODS

A HUGE CAVEMAN, GRUG, RUSHES forward, screaming,

growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT

DISPLAY. He BLINKS in the bright morning light. He

LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder.

As suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits

for the echoes of his outburst to fade.

Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a

signal, but before any sound escapes his lips--

A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.

3.

Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on

Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on

an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN.

A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next. Her display is

more terrier-like.

A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next. She is mostly

focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to

her display.

We HEAR the voice of Grug's nine-year-old son from inside

the cave. THUNK is eager to please his dad and emulates

his every move.

4.

Beat.

Grug sighs.

Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug. Thunk

picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the

cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over

by the boulder.

Grug sits up and smiles.

Grug's face drops.

The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the

lead.

5.

COMPRESSED TIME - The Croods RUN out of Crood canyon,

across the wide expanses of desert.

SEQ. 150 - SMASH & GRAB

EXT. MOUTH OF CROOD CANYON - MORNING

Grug and the Croods come to a stop at the HUNTING

GROUNDS. They are spent from a fifteen-mile run.

We see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg. The Croods

take shelter behind a rock. Grug PEERS over the top.

Eep's hand SHOOTS up. Thunk is less than enthusiastic.

Grug LIFTS Gran on his hand, and FLIPS her up in the air.

Gran FACE-PLANTS, her head buried in the sand. Only her

tail is showing.

6.

The family fades back and splits up. They get into

fighting/running position.

Thunk BREAKS COVER. He dashes into the open, SNATCHES

the egg.

Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon.

A Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back.

Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird. Sandy NIPS at its

heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head. She PULLS the

egg from its beak.

Down range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE. They STRETCH their

shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting

cable on a carrier.

Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP

their tail around the Ramu like a bola. The Ramu GOES

DOWN hard. Ugga and the egg ROLL forward. The Trip

Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it.

Gran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail

and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder.

DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey

player. LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos. They SWARM

in behind her.

The Liyotes TRIP Gran. They steal the egg, and HIT THE

GAS. They are INCREDIBLY FAST.

7.

Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on

the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. Eep

LAUNCHES.

Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off

in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg

into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.

A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She

loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug.

Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small

cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips

over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the

ground and fumbling the egg once again.

Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down

on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks.

The family members meet up as they begin their long run

back to the cave.

An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head

back to their cave.

The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the

chase.

Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each

family member onto the Girelephant's back.

Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a

launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant.

Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe.

The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon.

8.

Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes

over the other. Together they dig their heels into the

ground, slowing down the Girelephant.

The Bearowl continues the chase. The Croods maneuver the

Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl.

The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the

crash. The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the

canyon, sending the Croods flying in. They all tumble.

Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds

tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up

the egg.

Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it

cracks open.

The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each

Crood gets a taste. Thunk is the last Crood to get a

mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty.

A SHADOW TOUCHES Grug's feet. He looks up - the sun is

setting behind the canyon wall. He HOLDS UP his hand to

gauge how much daylight is left.

9.

SEQ. 200 - WELCOME TO CROOD CAVE

INT. CROOD CAVE - EVENING

The Croods RUN INSIDE THE CAVE. Ugga picks up a heavy

stick off the floor.

Ugga pulls Gran back.

Whack! Like she's cleaning a rug, Ugga SMACKS Sandy hard

with the stick. Dust and bugs fly off of her.

Ugga CLAPS her hands together and Sandy knows to let go.

She hits the floor and SCAMPERS away.

Grug enters and looks around the cave.

ON EEP clinging to the side of the sheer rock face above

Crood cave. She RAISES HER HAND to `catch' a few more

moments of sun.

10.

ON GRUG getting his `bath.'

Grug is finished with his bath.

Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears

a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb

even higher. Grug leaves the cave, searching for her.

ON GRUG exiting the cave... Grug sees that Eep is at the

very top.

Eep continues to climb.

Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It

SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug

sees the BearOwl in full attack mode.

Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature,

allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave. Grug

barely gets the cave closed in time.

11.

SEQ. 210 - BEDTIME STORY

The Bear Owl PUSHES his paw through the narrow opening,

and FEELS around for the Croods. The Croods are like

mice in this world.

Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where

a tiny spot of light seeps in.

12.

No answer. Grug CLIMBS up. Ugga PULLS Grug back down.

Grug climbs back up.

A pebble hits Grug in the head. It came from Eep's

ledge.

13.

Grug brightens.

The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the

ground. Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from

the bone-crib.

Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays

put.

As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall

of the cave.

Ugga covers Sandy's ears.

14.

Grug SWATS the painting.

Grug holds out Krispy Bear. The family is terrified.

Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with

stories all seemingly with the same ending.

All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into

one big heap, warm and comfy. Grug casts a glance to

Eep's ledge. She doesn't budge.

SEQ. 500 - FOLLOW THE LIGHT

15.

INT. CROOD CAVE - NIGHT

The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile. Except Eep,

who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE. Outside, we hear the

ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting.

But then, SILENCE.

And then cutting through the primordial night is a

MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps

around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the

"door" to peer outside, when suddenly--

WHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around

the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW.

She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to

catch it in her hands.

Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to

get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more

than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the

disappearing light.

Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the

cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she

shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes

all of her strength, but she manages to move it just

enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.

EXT. CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUS

Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever. Her

heart races. The hot night wind blows against her face

and through her hair. The forbidden sensation is

exhilarating.

The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it

will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her

hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels

herself.

Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING

through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to

side. As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon,

we...

EXT. CANYON

The light ahead is growing brighter. Eep is closing on

it. In her excitement, she missteps and SNAPS a stick

underfoot.

16.

It was barely audible. Eep instinctively FREEZES.

A huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall

above her. Eep throws a rock at the shadow.

She POWERS STRAIGHT UP the stone wall with unexpected

speed.

The Creature RUNS. Eep tops the wall and...

SEQ. 550 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS

EXT. ROCK ARCH - NIGHT

Eep steps into a small clearing. Stuck in the ground, is

a TORCH. As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was

following. Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches.

REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on

the palms of her hands and her face. TENSE. EXCITING.

But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her,

something MOVES. A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and

creeps up behind her.

Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away

from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at

her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her. On her

face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs

the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.

It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. Eep jumps

back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash

the Creature's brains in.

The Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front

of its face.

Hands? Eep GASPS, shocked to see HUMAN HANDS attached to

this monstrosity.

The Creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his

grotesque head, and RAISES its mask. It's a boy... he's

BEAUTIFUL! This is GUY.

17.

Eep LEAPS BACK a few paces, DROPPING the rock on Guy's

foot.

Eep moves swiftly to silence him. She POUNCES on him and

TWISTS his head sideways. Guy is SUFFOCATING. He feels

around for a stick and BASHES Eep in the side of the

head.

Eep TOSSES the boulder aside and LIFTS Guy with one hand.

Eep OPENS Guy's mouth and pokes around inside. She

SNIFFS at him. Turns him upside-down.

Eep looks closely at BELT, a sloth wrapped around Guy's

waist. Belt's eyes OPEN.

Eep DROPS Guy on his head.

Eep jams her foot over Guy's mouth.

18.

Guy BITES her foot.

She KICKS Guy in the stomach. He ROLLS sideways. Guy is

getting the worst of this encounter. Eep kicks Guy off-

frame. We HEAR the fight continuing.

INT. CROOD CAVE

Grug is awakened by wind coming from the cave opening.

He pushes the "sleep pile" off of him. Checks Eep's

ledge... but she is gone.

Grug stands outside the entrance to the cave. Peering

into utter darkness. He steels himself... and then

releases his hand from the "door."

SEQ. 560 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (PART II)

EXT. ROCK ARCH

Guy is still on his knees.

The flame DWINDLES. Guy MOVES toward it. Eep BLOCKS

him.

19.

No way Guy is getting past her.

Eep doesn't want to.

Eep sees a kindred spirit. She gets out of his way. Guy

PICKS UP the torch and BLOWS. Eep scoots closer to Guy,

staying in the circle of light around him. As Guy brings

the fire back to life, the relief on his face is familiar

to Eep. This boy seems to have power over light itself.

Eep is smitten.

Eep BALLS her fist, GRABBING Guy tightly by the hair.

20.

Eep SQUEEZES Guy like a tube of toothpaste.

Something CRACKS. Eep DROPS Guy - he's broken.

Belt RUBS two flat rocks together and places them on

Guy's chest like defibrillator paddles. Guy BOLTS

upright.

Belt AND Guy use shells to LISTEN to the ground.

He tries to pull her by the arm. She stays put like an

anchor.

21.

Guy and Belt both do gestures to accompany the Da da

daaaa. It seems very important to them.

Again with the gestures. It's a little weird to Eep.

He points into the distance.

22.

Guy and Belt reach out their hands to Eep.

Guy hands the shell to Eep. And Eep is mesmerized. Guy

pulls his hog-mask back down.

Eep test-blows the shell. It makes a sound, she giggles.

When she looks up to thank Guy, he is GONE.

Eep BUMPS directly into Grug.

A low GROWL interrupts them.

ON THE BEAR OWL Sniffing around. It passes over a log.

CRANE DOWN to reveal Grug hanging under the log by one

hand, Eep dangling in the other.

23.

SEQ. 610 - EARTHQUAKE

EXT. CANYON - OUTSIDE THE KEYHOLE - MORNING

Grug and Eep move up the canyon. Eep furiously kicks a

rock, it nearly hits Grug.

Things are tense between the two. At the KEYHOLE, they

are met by the rest of the Croods.

The Croods all SNATCH up stones. They form a defensive

circle.

Eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation.

She SQUEEZES out.

24.

Grug RAISES an eyebrow.

Eep ELBOWS Thunk in the back of his head.

Eep pulls out the SHELL. She BLOWS into the shell - the

sound ALARMS the Croods.

They SMACK the shell from Eep's hand and SMASH it with

their rocks.

Eep is incredulous. The dust clears - the panting Croods

are satisfied the object is gone.

She pelts Thunk with a rock.

25.

Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion. She SLAMS a

rock on the ground. It SHATTERS to dust.

CREAK! A strange GROAN is heard from under the ground.

Then a small amount of sand falls from up above. A crack

starts to splinter under their feet.

Then BOOM! The ground starts to SHAKE!

The Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS, fighting

their way through falling boulders and shifting ground,

heading towards the safety of their cave.

The Croods see the cave entrance. The canyon walls above

their home start to crack. Grug sees that the falling

rock will crush the cave.

Grug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from

the mass of rocks crashing down.

The top of the canyon collapses and the Crood's cave is

destroyed. Everything is engulfed by dust. The earth

settles.

SEQ. 710 - CROSSING OVER

The dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball,

covered by Grug. Grug stands, all Croods were sheltered

and safe under his mighty arms.

26.

Grug looks back to Crood cave. It is gone.

Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might

still be there. He finds one handprint, split in two.

He carefully fits them back together. Emotional, he

lowers his head.

As Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through

the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face--

As the dust descends, Eep sees A NEW WORLD beyond.

The dumbfounded Croods stare in awe at the beautiful

world.

The Croods look out at the new world.

Grug pulls Eep back from the precipice.

WHOOSH! Suddenly, bursting from the New World is a giant

flying creature - a TURTLE DOVE.

The Croods reel back as it sails overhead. They turn to

watch the Turtle Dove as it flies away.

They hear a familiar menacing growl. It's the BEAR OWL!

It roars and charges toward the Croods.

Grug instinctively GRABS a giant boulder and rolls it in

front of his family.

The Bear Owl runs and swats the massive boulder away like

a ball of yarn.

But the Croods are not behind it. They are running

towards the New World.

27.

The Croods run towards the precipice with the Bear Owl

closing in.

They reach the edge. The Bear Owl dives.

The Croods LEAP. They hang for a moment and begin

tumbling down a steep jungle hill.

SEQ. 776 - NEW WORLD

EXT. NEW WORLD. DAY

The Croods tumble through a twisty mess of giant roots

and strange plants and land in a heap. They all lie on

their backs, disoriented, but momentarily calm.

Grug sits up first. He turns to the high, high, cliff

above them -- to the top, where they have lived all their

lives up to this moment. A few loose pebbles continue to

tumble down. There is no sign of the BEAR OWL.

The others stand up, and they take in this new place.

Grug takes a deep breath and then quickly counts:

BEAT. Grug smiles.

Gran lands in a heap behind him.

28.

The Croods SIT UP. They are disoriented.

Sandy LUNGES at something almost disappearing into a

bush.

Grug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back

like a dog on a leash.

Sandy has a MOUSEPHANT in her mouth. Grug knocks it from

Sandy's mouth. A gaggle of mousephants run out from the

bush and scurry away.

They start moving.

PULL BACK - a huge colorful predator, THE MACAWNIVORE

senses something. He SITS UP and STALKS OFF.

ON THE CROODS moving fitfully through the strange forest.

The Croods cautiously move in fits and stops through the

middle of this thick, pre-historic rainforest.

29.

As they trek, strange creatures (BEAR PEARS, PUNCH

MONKEYS) watch these foreigners.

In the front of the line, Grug is freaked out. But in

the back Eep is taking in the wonders. They pass through

a curtain of hefty hanging pears. After they pass the

"pears" all turn to watch the Croods.

A leaf FLUTTERS down.

Eep and Grug LOOK UP.

WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY PUNCH

MONKEYS.

Grug launches into his Threat Display -

He flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the

nearest Punch Monkey. No reaction from the Punch Monkey.

Grug stops, confused... The Punch Monkey now breaks into a

BROAD GRIN... Then hauls off and - THUD - Punches Grug in

the face! Grug reels back, surprised - turns... Right into

another Punch Monkey. It winds up and - THUD! - it hits

Grug - Grug reels back - into another Monkey - THUD! -

Gran joins in and punches Grug in the nose.

30.

Wide shot: Grug is being bounced back and forth like a

pinball from one punch Monkey to the next. The Punch

Monkeys are whooping and hollering - this is great fun!

The Punch Monkeys let go of Grug and begin running away

for no apparent reason.

Grug staggers backwards into the family.

A colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a

MACAWNIVORE! The Croods react, terrified

Grug throws a rock at it. The Macawnivore catches the

rock and SPRINGS! -

Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as

it steps away-- it is actually a giant animal.

GRUG'S POV: A cave!

The Croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to

the cave.

The Croods all RUN LIKE CRAZY in the direction Grug

pointed. They step inside the "cave." SLAM! The front

of the cave comes down. The Croods have jumped inside

the MOUTH of a LAND WHALE!

31.

SEQ. 1250 - GUY TO THE RESCUE

The Land Whale stands up and then SPITS the Croods out

through its blow hole. The Croods land in a heap.

The Macawnivore appears from behind some nearby grass.

It looks at the Croods with delight. Suddenly, the

shadow of the setting sky passes over the Macawnivore.

It freaks out and retreats into the forest.

And for good reason, because as the SHADOW from the

setting sun falls across the Croods.

Suddenly, thousands of PIRANHA OWLS BURST from the

grasses around the Croods and form a huge undulating

cloud above them. It's a beautiful sight.

The cloud of Piranha Owls then SETTLE on a massive LAND

WHALE.

Moments later, they fly back into the air - the whale is

SKELETONIZED. It CRUMPLES to the ground.

The Croods form their defensive circle, brandishing

rocks.

Eep spies a SKULL lying in the sand. She SPRINTS for it.

32.

Eep breaks a horn from the skull and BLOWS on it loud and

long.

ON GUY hearing the horn. He is happy to hear the sound,

knowing it's Eep calling him.

Then as Guy begins walking towards the sound, Guy notices

the circling birds in the sky. Alarmed, he DASHES off.

Guy appears at the treeline. He spots Eep standing alone

in the clearing. He sees the birds heading towards her.

He runs and leaps off a ROCK OUTCROPPING jumping right

over the CROODS who are huddled near the ROCK.

Guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out

of Eep's hand to stop the noise then STRIKES a spark with

two STONES. The birds close in, blotting out the

remaining light. All goes BLACK.

Then, a tiny leaf of flame FLUTTERS to life before Guy.

He THROWS two more handfuls of grass on it, and it FLARES

UP! The light SPLITS the onrushing red tide of birds

like a knife. For a few moments the Croods are inside a

TORNADO of the tiny monsters. The mass PASSES.

Grug SLAPS at one last smoldering bird FLUTTERING past.

Grug TURNS to see Guy, HOLDING his daughter. Grug's

expression DARKENS. He SNARLS.

Grug pushes Eep aside and shows Guy his threat display.

SEQ. 1275 - FIRE GOOD, FIRE BAD

Suddenly, Guy and Eep are circled by the Croods. They

are in defensive ape-like positions. Each doing their

threat display.

33.

Guy stands in front of Eep defensively.

Guy PULLS his knife.

Eep nods toward Thunk.

34.

The Croods keep circling.

Grug grabs him and squeezes him tight.

POP! Guy's ribs are cracked for the second time.

Guy falls in a heap.

Grug turns to see Ugga, Thunk, Gran and Sandy are now

sitting very close around the fire, transfixed.

As Grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting

Croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he

talks to them like a kindergarten teacher:

35.

Grug looks around to see that Eep is kneeling beside Guy.

Suddenly, behind Grug, Sandy ATTACKS the torch. She

shakes it with her teeth, EMBERS FLY EVERYWHERE.

Grug reaches down and scoops up Sandy. (NOTE: From this

point, Grug will hold onto Sandy, no matter how much she

struggles, kicks and bites.)

The Croods snatch at the embers as they dance in the air

around them.

One of the embers has caught onto Thunk's tunic.

Thunk takes off running like a maniac.

The flame explodes into embers, which starts more fires

in the grass around him. Grug looks at the growing fires

with utter confusion.

36.

Thunk sprints through the grass, arms flailing, as a ring

of fire blazes up.

Gran cackles at her grandson's misfortune, but then she

realizes her WALKING STICK IS ON FIRE.

Angrily, Gran starts to slam the burning end of the stick

on the ground, trying to put it out.

But she only ends up making more small fires.

While Gran tries desperately to save her cane, Ugga

starts throwing sticks on the small fires, which begin to

grow in size.

EEP AND GUY.

Eep and Guy witness the FIERY MAYHEM:

SERIES OF SHOTS:

flaming butt.

37.

backwards, is now holding onto a burning stick and

lighting everything she passes on fire.

batting it into every tree and bush she can hit.

it onto the small fire.

WHOOSH! Ugga ignites a massive bonfire.

The Croods appear like a bunch of violent, lunatic

pyromaniacs.

CLOSE ON GRAN

Gran is pounding her walking stick on the ground.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL - she is standing on the edge of a

giant corn field that is slowly catching on fire.

POOF! The fire on her cane has finally gone out.

She smiles. And then WA-POP!

The giant ear of corn explodes blasting Gran off frame

who slams into Thunk. The speeding ear picks up Ugga,

Grug.

ON EEP AND GUY

Eep and Guy are HIT by the speeding corn.

38.

The speeding ear CRASHES into a lone tree, sending Guy

and the Croods sprawling across the tundra. The flying

ears ROCKET SKYWARD and BURST like colorful fireworks.

Popcorn kernels RAIN DOWN upon the Croods. They are

BURIED.

SEQ. 1425 - THE GOAL IS SET

The Croods burst out of a mountain of popcorn.

ON THE BASE OF THE POPCORN PILE

Guy BURROWS out the side of the popcorn pile like a

prisoner escaping Alcatraz.

39.

Guy RUNS for the mountain. Eep POUNCES on Guy like a

tiger.

Eep SETS him down. Guy BOLTS but discovers Eep hasn't

let go of his hand. Guy is YANKED backwards like he's

been tied to a piling.

BEAT.

WHOOSH! Grug grabs Guy and throws him in a log.

Grug hoists Guy in the log onto his shoulder.

40.

Grug moves out, AWAY from the mountain. The family falls

in behind Grug. Thunk is carrying a huge piece of

popcorn that he's snacking on.

ON THE TALL MOUNTAIN way in the distance.

On cue, a RUMBLE. This gets Grug's attention. Grug

STOPS. The Croods wait to see what's going to happen

next. A Mammoth FALLS out of sight, SWALLOWED by the

ground.

41.

Sandy tries to attack Belt.

Belt antagonizes Sandy by sticking his tongue out at her.

Sandy goes at Belt again.

Eep RAISES one eyebrow.

SEQ. 1460 - FAMILY ROAD TRIP

EXT. BURNT OUT SHRUBS

The Croods have not traveled far. The camera starts

tight in on Thunk and Sandy. Sandy is harassing Thunk.

42.

We follow Sandy as she moves past Gran.

Sandy moves past Ugga, Eep and Guy who is still stuck in

the log and being carried by Grug.

Thunk accidentally bumps into Eep.

The camera slowly pulls out from the family in chaos as

they walk across the burned out landscape.

The Croods are traveling across the dry land. The camera

has pulled out from the family as they travel. Family

chaos continues.

43.

Thunk starts to HOP WITH HIS KNEES GLUED TO EACH OTHER.

A Liyote turns to watch the Croods as they travel.

44.

Oh yeah, more traveling. Now we are in the Turkeyfish

hunting grounds. The camera is so far away the Croods

are only a speck in the frame.

SMASH CUT TO:

Grug, exhausted, in the foreground with family chaos over

his shoulder.

Gran jumps up and tries to grab Belt. Belt pulls a bone

knife and defends himself.

45.

SEQ. 1075 - FOOD FIXES EVERYTHING

A WHOOPING sound comes from the grasses ahead. A giant

TURKEY FISH raises its toothy head.

Grug grabs Thunk.

Eep shows her hunting face.

Leaning against a rock next to Gran, Sandy, Eep and Ugga.

Guy notices Eep is agitated. She STARES in the direction

the men went.

46.

Thunk CRASHES THROUGH the bushes, PURSUED by the Turkey

Fish. Grug is being DRUG behind.

The Turkeyfish squashes Grug into the ground. Then

continues chasing Thunk.

Thunk FLIES INTO FRAME and SPLATS against the rock. The

Turkey Fish climbs to the top of a nearby rock and dives

off.

ON A GIANT BRONTO SCORPION

SLAPPED on a rock in front of the Croods.

The Bronto Scorpion suddenly STRUGGLES.

The Croods PULL at the legs. They TWIST and SNAP OFF

like lobster legs.

47.

The dismembered legs continue to STRUGGLE. Guy looks

ill.

Gran looks hungrily at Guy.

Sandy gets up from the table.

Guy looks on, horrified.

Belt gives Guy a "let's get out of here" look. Belt rolls

Guy away from the family.

Guy LEAVES. Eep chases him and pins him down.

48.

EXT. GRASSLANDS - AFTERNOON

Guy lays a snare in the low grass. He WALKS to the base

of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes.

He TIES the rope around the base of the tree. Then he

hands the loose end to Eep. Belt stretches his arms

WIDE. Guy STOPS jumping and points up to the top of the

tree.

Eep takes the cue. She LEAPS up and grabs the leaning

top of the tree. Her weight gently BENDS the tree top

down to the ground.

Guy carefully SETS the trigger.

Guy makes sound effects to get his point across as he

describes the trap.

49.

Belt opens his arms wide showing Guy has been alone a

long, long time.

Guy pulls out a weird miniature TURKEY FISH PUPPET.

ON THE TURKEY FISH getting ready to eat the TRIP-GERBILS.

The Turkey LIFTS the creature to his mouth to DEVOUR it,

but he's INTERRUPTED by a WHISTLING sound. He TURNS to

see the silly little puppet dancing about. The Turkey

Fish DROPS his meal and cautiously APPROACHES the puppet.

ON GUY AND EEP working the puppet. Eep is having the

time of her life.

They are so into what they are doing, they accidentally

get TANGLED UP.

In their struggle to UNTANGLE themselves, Eep and Guy

inadvertently insult the Turkey Fish. It CHARGES. Eep

and Guy don't notice.

The Turkey Fish MISSES the snare, LEAPS the rock and

SNATCHES the fake bird off of Guy's head, THRASHING it.

50.

Eep BOLDLY STANDS in front of the bird. The Turkey Fish

grabs Guy and tosses him high across the open field. He

goes flying through the air, screaming.

ON GRUG - hearing the commotion. Guy lands back in the

log.

Eep is in full parkour as she runs from the Turkeyfish.

Grug STEPS FORWARD. He's going to SPRING the trap.

She LEAPS the snare, PUSHING Grug DOWN.

The Turkey Fish HITS the trigger. The snare TRIPS. The

bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short. The

Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air. He FLIES a

couple hundred feet up...

... and CRASHES down in a cloud of feathers.

SEQ. 900 - BBQ/CAPTIVATING CAPTIVE

EXT. BARBECUE

ON THE TURKEY ROASTING over an open fire. It looks golden

and juicy. Grug is agitated. The Croods are devouring

the Turkey Fish.

THE CROODS are eating like wild animals. They

practically MAUL each other for scraps. HOWLS and

SNARLING fill the night air. Guy is amazed and shocked

at how the Croods are wolfing it down.

51.

Guy sits to the side, his ankle roped to a heavy rock.

Guy and Belt share a concerned LOOK as they politely eat

their meal. Eep comes over and sits next to Guy.

Grug is struck by Eep's words. Ugga sees Grug is hurt.

Guy and Belt are struck by this as well.

Croods gather around Grug.

52.

The Croods LEAVE Grug and GATHER around Guy. Guy is

uncharacteristically dumbstruck.

A BEAT -

Thinking the story is over, the Croods begin to get up.

As Guy begins talking again they settle back down.

53.

Grug studies Guy. Is he crazy? Eep though is entranced.

Eep and Guy lock eyes. There is something growing between

them. Grug and Belt see it too. Grug is not thrilled.

Grug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log. Grug CURLS

UP by the fire with the LOG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM far away

from Eep.

ON GRUG'S FACE.

54.

Morning light kisses Grug's cheeks. He's sound asleep.

PULL OUT to reveal that Guy's log is now teetering over a

cliff edge - there was another subduction during the

night, and half of the Croods' sleeping platform has sunk

two hundred feet. Grug is still grasping Guy's log,

which now hangs over the fresh abyss, and the still-

asleep Guy is now SLIPPING out of one end. In the nick

of time, Grug SHIFTS position, inadvertently TURNS the

log, and Guy starts slipping out the OTHER end. Guy

WAKES UP, looking down.

SEQ. 1600 - CROODS GET SHOES

EXT. CORAL FIELDS - MORNING

The Croods trudge behind Grug as he cautiously makes his

way to the mountain. Grug SNIFFS, and TESTS the ground -

he moves like a man in a mine field. Meaning SLOWLY.

Eep walks alongside Guy, who is still being carried by

Grug in the log.

55.

Eep FALLS BACK behind Thunk, getting him between she and

her dad.

Eep SMASHES Thunk in the face, KNOCKING him into Grug,

sending Guy and the log FLYING. Grug shoots Eep an

annoyed look.

Grug sees Guy has ROLLED away.

Grug goes to retrieve Guy, and STEPS on something sharp.

Thunk steps on the coral - it CRUNCHES under his feet.

Gran steps out, and then SCREAMS.

Guy stands on the coral without flinching.

Grug must make the choice to go after Guy.

56.

Grug cringes and bellows with every step. Guy still

locked inside the log, hops away as fast as he can. Grug

leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as Guy

jumps to a coral patch below.

Guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell. He

looks back at the Croods as they try in vain to cross the

field and feels pity for Eep.

Guy looks back at the stranded Croods. Then he looks

again to the tall mountain. Belt sees that Guy is having

a hard time leaving the Croods. He needs to make a

choice. Belt makes it for him.

Belt walks Guy back to the Croods

GUY STANDS AT THE EDGE OF THE CORAL, ONLY A FEW FEET FROM

GRUG AND THE CROODS. GUY'S ARMS ARE FILLED WITH

SUPPLIES.

Grug grudgingly DROPS the log.

Grug BARELY NUDGES it.

Grug KICKS it a quarter-mile.

SEQ. 1710 - GOING GUY'S WAY

59.

The Croods run, slowly at first, then faster. And

faster. The shoes make the difference.

ON THE CROODS

Grug encounters a bunch of Punch Monkeys again. He

readies himself for a fight.

Guy hands out bananas.

Grug throws his banana to the ground only to slip on it.

ON THE CROODS

Grug sees the Macawnivore down below in the crevasse

waiting for his Croods dinner.

Grug sees Guy making something out of sticks.

Traveling by stilts over a crevasse.

The family hobbles across a canyon on their stilts. Guy

helps Eep from falling.

The family moves across, Grug is the last to follow.

Grug spies Chunky the Death Cat below him. Grug WHACKS

Chunky in the face with a stilt.

Chunky ponders the strange sticks Grug is perched on,

then WHACKS a chunk out of them. Grug DROPS down by a

yard or so. Panicking, Grug RACES across the chasm,

losing stilt height with every SWIPE of Chunky's paw.

Grug doesn't make it across - SNARLING and BITING sounds

emanate from the canyon.

The Croods stand at the top of a cliff.

60.

Grug tries to maneuver his way down the cliff by clinging

to the side.

Guy and the other Croods sit on a giant leaves, sledding

down the side of the canyon past Grug.

They pass Grug up as he continues to make his way down by

tiptoeing. Grug stumbles and falls down the slope.

BOOM! A FLASH POPS against the Croods. SWING THE CAMERA

AROUND to reveal A HUGE STORM hanging like a purple

curtain before them. The Croods stop dead.

The rain line BEARS DOWN on them.

Grug tries to PUNCH the drops.

ON EEP AND GUY

Guy opens an Umbrella to cover himself from the rain.

Belt pulls Eep under the umbrella to be close to Guy.

Belt makes an Origami boat. He and Sandy sail across the

rain puddles.

grabs the umbrella away from Guy. Grug gets hit by

lightning.

The rest of the Croods open their umbrellas to take cover

as they enjoy the RAIN.

Eep is pointing at her own reflection.

61.

Eep goes to jump in the water. Guy STOPS her.

Guy CANNONBALLS. Then SURFACES.

Eep tentatively HOPS in. Guy STEADIES her. Then shows

her how to move her arms in a swimming motion.

Guy SUPPORTS Eep by holding one hand under her tummy.

She begins to SWIM.

Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is

building.

The Croods ALL JUMP at once.

Grug is left alone. Belt uses Grug's arm as a diving

platform. Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized

swimming. Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE - Eep is on

Guy's shoulders! This is too much for Grug!

Grug DIVES IN to put a stop to any potential shenanigans.

Grug's huge tidal wave SWAMPS Guy and Eep. Grug SINKS to

the bottom.

ON GRUG laying on the bottom. His family SWIMS above him

on the tails of Fishcats, confident and free and buoyant.

A lone bubble escapes Grug's nose, like oil oozing from a

sunken wreck. He's feeling mighty extraneous.

Grug sees the Macawnivore swimming towards him. Grug

swims for his life. Ends in a big splash.

SEQ. 1725 - MAZE

PAN UP TO THE ENTRANCES TO THE MAZE

62.

EXT. TUFA MAZE - AFTERNOON

The Croods stand motionless before an open plain, deeply

sculpted with meandering grooves which form a massive

MAZE.

Guy is handing out SHELLS to the Croods.

Grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells.

63.

Grug SITS down like a silverback gorilla.

Just then, A HUGE RUMBLE. The EARTH STARTS TO SHAKE

VIOLENTLY. The Croods and Guy are KNOCKED DOWN into the

Maze each `falling' into a separate entrance.

They disappear into the rift like a penny dropped down a

drain.

As Grug and Guy slide passed each other. Frustrated Grug,

tries to punch Guy.

INSIDE THE MAZE

The SHAKING COMES TO A STOP. Everyone (now separated)

gathers themselves.

ON GRUG-- finding himself alone.

64.

Looking very frightened.

Thunk PICKS UP his shell, and tentatively makes his way,

alone, into his branch of the maze.

ON EEP (OR GUY?)-- in another part of the maze. She puts

her hand on the giant wall to her LEFT.

of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto

Eep's path.

Eep.

They share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again.

Grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze. He

grumbles and enters a different tunnel.

ON THE MAZE EXIT -

Guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the

setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain. Guy is

amazed that he and Eep are both doing the same thing. He

is smitten. Guy goes over to Eep.

Guy takes her hand.

Eep and Guy turn to each other, just as Thunk emerges and

tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch.

A shell note signals Ugga, Gran and Sandy's arrival.

There is an obvious change in the ladies.

Ugga removes her hat to reveal her new look.

66.

A loud shell blast interrupts. It is followed by two

others.

ON GRUG still stuck in the maze. He holds his head in

defeat, and TOSSES the shell down.

Thunk, Sandy Belt and Gran are sitting around a torch,

listening to one of Gran's stories.

68.

Ugga arrives and sits next to Guy. She takes in the

scene.

A RUMBLE distracts Guy. He looks to the horizon. FIRES

and SMOKE on the horizon mark the leading edge of the

collapse. Eep comes to his side.

Guy LIGHTS A TORCH and leads the Croods up, up, to the

forest canopy.

Guy BLOWS OUT his torch. The night sky is revealed in

all its glory. The Croods are amazed.

Music POUNDS as the spectacle SWEEPS around the Croods.

Perched on the canopy of the forest the Croods seem to

sit at the very brink of the universe.

ON GRUG ARRIVING at the tree top. When he sees the stars

he DUCKS back down, terrified.

He overhears the rest of the conversation.

Eep with tears in her eyes.

EXT. TREE - SUNRISE

The whole family is searching for Grug. He has

disappeared.

from knotted grass. The sight SHOCKS Ugga.

ON GRUG with the family standing around him.

Guy comes to a sudden stop - he's stepped in a small

puddle of TAR.

Grug wipes his eyes clean of fruit.

76.

Guy and Grug do a slow-motion PLUNGE over a tar-fall. As

they descend Grug SWINGS at Guy, coating himself with

tar. Grug's arms are held like glue. His punches stop

well short of Guy's face. Guy and Grug arrive in a wide

pool of tar. They SINK slowly.

The tone of Guy's voice SINKS IN. Grug CEASES his

attack.

Grug looks to Guy.

Grug gets it.

Grug looks at Guy again - he needs more than that. Guy

takes a deep breath - this is going to be hard.

77.

This resonates with Grug.

A thread of light trickles through the storm, falling

just near enough to Guy he can gather it in his palm.

Grug ponders this. A CHANGE comes over Grug. He focuses

on Guy. This hits Grug hard.

Guy considers Grug.

sees him not as a boy but a man. Someone good enough for

his little girl.

mode.

SEQ. 2925 - TO TOMORROW

EXT. EDGE OF THE WORLD - EARLY EVENING.

ON THE CROODS

RUSHING up the gun-sight into the bright rays of the sun.

When the Croods rush toward "Tomorrow," it is a golden,

ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun,

clouds, and mountain. From the Croods POV it looks as if

they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a

waiting sun.

Even Grug is taken with the sight - it's there after all.

The Croods stare at the open meadow across from them.

Tremors violently SHAKE the ground.

When the rift OPENS in front of them, the hot gasses and

blasts of hot ash BURST the clouds from beneath. The

debris shades the sun, revealing a very Earthly landscape

beyond.

From the Croods perspective, Tomorrow vanished before

their eyes.

81.

A SHOCKWAVE knocks a large chunk of rock off the edge the

Croods are standing on blowing them backwards.

KABOOM! A gargantuan jet of ash STABS at the sky. Ugga

PULLS the Croods away from the ledge. She herds them

back toward the gunsight.

But Grug doesn't join them. Instead, Grug takes a step

TOWARD the precipice, peering into the curtain of ash as

if trying to burn a hole straight through it.

Grug spies a wispy shaft of light STRUGGLING through the

ash cloud. He HOLDS UP his hand to feel it. A beam of

light settles on his palm. Grug is ENLIGHTENED.

Grug looks back at his family - huddled, terrified. The

picture of what he would have wanted in the beginning.

The sight bothers him.

82.

A smile breaks across Eep's face - her dad has answered

the question.

Belt wipes a tear off his face.

The Croods wait an eternity. Then - a HORN SOUNDS.

Grug HURLS Thunk.

83.

Grug wipes a tear from Ugga's eye. Then lifts her above

his head. He HURLS her across.

Gran is next in line.

Grug LIFTS her above his head.

Grug SMILES and throws her next.

Another TREMBLER. MORE cliff FALLS away. Now the

distance is even greater.

Eep is next in line.

Grug embraces Eep.

84.

A BEAT.

Eep takes in the full effect of her dad's words.

The ground begins to shake and break apart around them.

The gap grows wider. Grug lifts Eep and makes the

greatest throw of his life.

The tumult parts briefly. Grug can see his entire family

safe on the other side. He waves a last goodbye. To his

surprise, a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open

hand.

The family waves to Grug to let him know they are okay.

SEQ. 2750 - FAMILY PORTRAIT

EXT. CLIFFSIDE

Grug is startled by another earthquake. The ground is

ripping itself apart as meteors begin to fall around him.

Grug dodges falling debris and lighting and manages to

crawl into a nearby cave-- a familiar place for him.

85.

INT. CAVE

Grug grabs two pieces of flint and starts clicking them

together, just as Guy did earlier. They ignite. Grug

has created his very first fire.

Another earthquake shakes the cavern. Grug moves over to

a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of

his family. He paints each member individually and then

looks longingly at the family he will never see again.

The torch begins to go out. Grug blows on it and is

startled by the massive Macawnivore beast, growling at

him.

The Macawnivore blows out the torch. Another meteor hits

the cave with a loud boom! The Macawnivore stops growling

and starts blowing on the torch along with Grug. It is

just as frightened as Grug. Grug reaches out and pets

the now gentle carnivorous beast.

INT. CAVE

Grug and the Macawnivore huddle together in a prehistoric

armistice. When suddenly, Grug hears the dim tone of

Eep's "shell signal." He rushes to the entrance to the

cave. He surveys the raging CATACLYSM outside the cave

as the world is being torn asunder.

He hears the SHELL ALARM blow TWO MORE TIMES. His family

is in trouble.

The scale of his problem sinks in.

Something occurs to Grug.

86.

He absent-mindedly hands the torch to the Macawnivore.

Grug CLOSES HIS EYES, and CONCENTRATES.

The ember of a thought FLICKERS TO LIFE in Grug's brain.

SEQ. 2975 - GRUG CROSSES THE DIVIDE

EXT. FIELD

Grug uses a log to wipe tar all over a giant rib cage.

Grug runs out of the cave and into a nearby field and

startles a pack of nesting PIRANHA OWLS. He turns back

to the Macawnivore.

The meat-eating birds begin to chase Grug.

Grug leaps onto the Macawnivore's back as the birds move

in closer. The ground begins to break up violently as

lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways.

The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug

has coated with tar. The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage

and stick to it. As they fight to free themselves, the

rib cage lifts off the ground. Grug takes a giant tree

branch, ignites it, and uses it as a rudder, scaring the

Piranha Owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent

direction.

As the cage flies, above the fiery landscape, Grug sees

Douglas, sitting forlornly with the shell still in his

mouth.

87.

Grug doesn't even debate it, he runs back for the little

monstrosity.

Grug JUMPS out of the cage and rushes over to grab the

gerbils. Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding

under a nearby rock. He GRABS the Liyote. Grug sees the

TRIP-GERBILS stranded as well. Grug TWIRLS the Trip-

Gerbils around his neck like a scarf.

A ROAR BUILDS behind Grug - the pyroclastic flow is

SPEEDING closer.

Grug CATCHES UP to the lumbering blimp-cage. He PUSHES

it to go faster.

The pyroclastic cloud BLASTS up the narrow passage.

Finally, with Grug's strength, the cage CLEARS the edge

of the cliff.

The CLOUD HITS them all, SWALLOWING the Cage like a

speck.

comforting arm around her grandchildren, even she has a

tear in her eye.

The ground begins to shake softly.

88.

Gran walks up to Eep. Eep continues to blow her shell

horn. Eep and Gran share a moment. Eep breaks into tears.

Gran looks at her shell horn and BLOWS it loudly. Eep is

happily surprised.

The whole family, even Guy, steps up next to Eep and

begins BLOWING their shell horns.

It's clear from Eep's expression she has no intention of

budging.

Ugga appeals to Eep.

Ugga looks up. Guy LOOKS UP. Everyone looks up!

Grug CRASHES near the family. They run to meet him.

89.

But all Grug sees is his astonished family staring back

at him.

Eep RUNS to him, HUGS him ferociously, nearly knocking

him down.

The rest of the Croods begin running to Grug. Grug hugs

each of them like never before.

Grug puts his arm around Guy.

Belt wants to be acknowledged as well.

All the animals join in hugging Grug.

Douglas runs up and licks Thunk.

Suddenly the group rises up as the Macawnivore stands

near them.

Grug notices a TAIL sticking out of Chunky's mouth.

90.

Chunky SPITS OUT the TRIP-GERBILS. He GRINS sheepishly.

The TRIP-GERBILS run to Gran knocking her over in their

excitement.

The whole family takes this amazing view in then looks to

Grug for his decision.

SEQ. 3500 - EPILOGUE

RUSHING TOWARD A SHORELINE covered in dense palms, gentle

waves lapping at the sand.

On Eep, fixing her hair. We PULL OUT to see the whole

family preparing for a family photo.
