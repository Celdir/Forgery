HEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE MYSTERIOUS SEWING ROOM - NIGHT,

A HAUNTING LULLABY plays against a black, star-pricked

sky when something appears in the distance. A BUTTON-EYED

DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a

small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING

HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES.

The doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old-

fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids -

is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is

opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS

go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button-

eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is

removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside

out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK.

Sawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial

features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a

fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a

button drawer.

The transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its

new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and

BACK INTO THE NIGHT.

LAST HEAD CREDIT APPEARS, THEN FADES.

EXT PINK PALACE, ASHLAND OREGON - DAY

WIDE ANGLE on a rambling old Queen Anne-style house with

tacked-on outside stairs. It's late winter, the sky a

damp, grey sponge. A SIGN in the foreground reads "Pink

Palace, Apartment for Rent".

MR. BOBINSKY - a seven-foot-tall blue-skinned man -

performs calisthenics on the rooftop, counting in

Russian.

A BEEPING SOUND begins and he pauses. A tired MOVING VAN

backs into frame and up the muddy driveway. A VW BEETLE -

suitcases roped to its top - recklessly passes the truck

and disappears around the side of the house. Bobinsky

shakes his fist angrily after the car and shouts:

He marches away indignantly. One of the MOVERS, unseen in

the truck, speaks to his companion.

ANGLE ON moving truck's REAR DOORS as they're wrenched

open by two men - MOVER 1, tall and bear-shaped, and

MOVER 2, built like a brick top - to reveal a lot of

BOXES and BEAT-UP FURNITURE.

They haul out the LOADING RAMP towards CAMERA.

NEW ANGLE, EXTERIOR STAIRS to BASEMENT FLAT. APRIL SPINK,

a rotund little old English lady with bad legs, surveys

the MOVERS as they pass by her chair-lift with boxes and

furniture. The old gal can't wait to tell her flat mate

below about the young, strapping men.

ANGLE ON FRONT PORCH. The job finished, Mover 2 heads

down the front steps while Mover 1 waits for a signature

from the unseen-but-for-his-hands new tenant. Papers

signed, a tip of a single, grubby dollar bill is placed

in the outstretched hand of the disappointed mover, and

the door is shut.

EXT HOUSE, REAR VIEW - SAME

ANGLE from BACK YARD. Hiding behind shrubs, WE SHARE the

POV of a MYSTERIOUS SPY. With a CLICK, a close-up lens is

rotated into place to better see the movers quietly pack

into the truck and drive away. A MANGY BLACK CAT walks

right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern.

OFF-SCREEN, a door bangs open. WE FOLLOW the cat as it

races up a tree and out a branch towards the BACK PORCH

to investigate.

CORALINE JONES, 11, steps onto the porch in a YELLOW

RAINCOAT with a shoulder bag. WE - SPY'S POV - CLICK to a

CLOSE-UP to find this new tenant has BLUE HAIR and a

skeptical face.

NEW ANGLE, non-spy reverse, on Coraline as she glances

furtively over her shoulder, then hops down the steps and

moves diagonally away from the house.

NEW Angle, SPY POV. We watch Coraline head towards the

WOODY SHRUB we've hidden ourselves in. We DUCK DOWN.

ANGLE on Coraline, non-spy, shrub by garden gate. She

reaches into the shrub and breaks off a FORKED BRANCH.

She removes the stick's red leaves, aims it like a

DOWSING ROD and heads into the garden.

CAM PUSH IN to shrub as the SPY RISES UP, wearing a three-

eyed SKELETON MASK on his head and SKELETON GLOVES on his

hands. The black cat hops into frame, glances at the spy

and follows the girl.

MONTAGE VARIOUS EXT - SAME

AFISH POND IN GARDEN - SAME

Coraline explores the drained, crumbling pond. She finds

an old TURTLE SHELL in the muck and holds it up. After

rapping on it to make sure it's empty, she puts the shell

into her shoulder bag.

ANGLE ON CAROLINE, SPY POV. WE PUSH ASIDE dead vines from

the railing of the GARDEN BRIDGE for a better look.

Coraline aims her forked stick once more then follows it

up from the pond and out the BACK GATE. A gust of WIND

blows DEAD LEAVES into a swirling eddy WE TRACK high up

into the air.

ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - LITTLE LATER

SPY POV on sky, now dark with GATHERING STORM. Hidden

behind a NATURAL WALL OF STONES, WE TILT DOWN to view

Coraline crossing frame on a STEEP HILLSIDE path. She

steps on an old RAILROAD TIE, and her foot SINKS into the

rotted wood, stopping her.

WE LEAN OUT for a better view, and DISLODGE some stones

that roll down past her. WE DUCK as she jerks her head

our way.

NEW ANGLE, non-spy. Unnerved, Coraline calls out.

She throws a rock over the wall of stones, HITS THE

UNSEEN SPY, causing a CRY OF PAIN. ANIMAL? HUMAN? Freaked

out, she GASPS, runs up the trail.

NEW ANGLE, SPY POV. We rise up to watch and the black cat

hops onto the stone wall.

EXT. OVERGROWN ORCHARD - CONT.

Coraline races down past an OLD TRACTOR and into an

ORCHARD. WIND begins to blow.

NEW ANGLE as we move beside Coraline through the old

apple trees, where she nearly trips on the tongue of a

harvest cart.

DOWN ANGLE ON on Coraline as she BACKS INTO a circle of

TOADSTOOLS in front of a STUMP. BREATHING HARD, she looks

out for her pursuer.

NEW ANGLE. The black cat shoots past Coraline in the tall

grass. She can't see him but she knows something is

there. Already behind her now, the cat LEAPS onto the

stump with a loud, warning MEROWWW!

STARTLED, Coraline YELLS and whips around. She's both

angry and relieved when she sees it's just some cat.

Cat GLARES at her with BLUE OPAL EYES, makes a low growl

as she stands. She exhales.

Cat BLINKS EYES slowly.

The wind picks up. She grasps the forks of her stick,

closes her eyes, and, tracing a figure eight above her,

SAYS:

ANGLE ON CORALINE FROM HIGH BLUFF. The SPY moves into

frame, astride some kind of MOTOR-BIKE. He presses a

button on the handlebars and BLASTS a loud AIR HORN.

STARTLED, Coraline SPINS around.

UP ANGLE ON SPY. As LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER ROLLS,

Coraline sees him for the first time. With his turret-

lensed SKULL MASK and SKELETON GLOVES and black FIREMAN'S

COAT flapping in the wind, he looks like a PSYCHO KILLER!

He REVS his motor, pops a wheelie, then SWOOPS DOWN the

bluff towards her. She HOLLERS IN FEAR, then tries to

WHACK HIM with her forked stick.

He SNATCHES it from her as he passes, KNOCKING HER to the

ground. He SIDE-SKIDS his bike, hops off and JUMPS UP

onto the stump. Looking TEN FEET TALL from the ground,

THUNDER AND LIGHTNING at a peak, the Spy turns his THREE-

EYED TURRET LENS and studies her like a predatory alien.

And then, the thunder and lightning just FADE OUT and

this psycho-killer, three-eyed spy pulls off his mask and

Coraline GASPS -- he's just a short kid in a costume.

Shoulders hunched, neck bent, the Spy - real name WYBIE

LOVAT - aged 12 - examines Coraline's forked stick, aims

it around.

Coraline, SNATCHES it from his GLOVED HANDS.

Coraline smacks Wybie.

He crouches, nervous, to scratch the cat behind his ears.

The cat PURRS like a diesel.

Coraline reacts, hops out of the springy circle. The boy

scrapes at the ground, revealing a CIRCULAR COVERING

made of WOODEN PLANKS. He wedges a fallen branch under

one side, and, using a rock for the fulcrum, pries up the

covering.

Her frown RELAXES and the black cat tilts his head,

noticing her change in tone. He steps off the branch, and

the well cover thumps in place.

Jerks his head toward the pink house in distance.

Changing the subject, he lifts a gloved hand to shake.

Her face goes as DARK as the rain clouds above.

A distant dinner bell clangs.

He holds up his hands in surrender, nodding with eyes

closed, forcing some laughs.

He picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his

gloved hands.

He points to her dowsing rod, nods.

Coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her

hands on her clothes.

The cat merows at her, shaking his head with a pitying

look, then trots away after Wybie. She STICKS OUT HER

TONGUE at him.

She looks down at the COVERING to the well. Coraline

finds a PEBBLE and drops it through A SMALL KNOT-HOLE.

Ear at the knot-hole, she counts until there's a watery

"plop" far below. FAT RAINDROPS start to fall around her.

INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

It's POURING out. Coraline looks out a window at the DEAD-

LOOKING GARDEN, and places PACKETS OF SEEDS - pumpkins,

squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts - on the sill.

She's developed a REDDISH RASH - poison oak - on one

hand.

The main floor kitchen, like most   things in the Pink

Palace, is barely maintained, and   looks worn and faded.

Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40,   bangs away at her

laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES   stacked nearby. She's

plain-looking and tired and wears   a NECK-BRACE.

Coraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject.

Coraline turns to her.

Mel stops typing, loses her patience.

Mel remembers something.

Coraline walks over and is handed a NEWSPAPER-WRAPPED

PACKAGE. Attached note reads:

She rips open the package and finds the BUTTON-EYED, BLUE-

HAIRED, YELLOW RAINCOAT-WEARING DOLL from the head

credits - it's a litte Coraline!

She crumples the note, both annoyed and charmed.

But Coraline takes it with her and leaves the room.

INT. STUDY - SAME

CHARLIE Jones, 40, goose-necked and gangly with thinning

dark hair, HUNT-AND-PECKS at his ancient computer,

surrounded by boxes of GARDENING MAGAZINES and empty

coffee cups. Coraline, with doll, opens the SQUEAKY DOOR.

He doesn't turn.

He ignores her reflection in his computer screen as he

types away, green letters on black. She CLEARS HER

THROAT.

He hears rain outside.

Coraline GROANS, stamps her feet. Charlie just taps

harder on the keys. Pouting, she makes the door squeak,

opening and shutting it till he can't take any more. He

spins around.

He grabs a pen and pad, holds it out.

She rolls her eyes, takes paper and pen and leaves.

MONTAGE, VARIOUS - SAME

HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

Coraline, with doll, jumps on BUMP in carpet that moves

with each jump.

LAUNDRY ROOM/WINTER GARDEN

She wipes off the misted glass so she and the doll can

see out, then writes in her pad: 7 leaky windows. A drop

of water lands on the pad, smearing the ink. She adds

really between 7 and leaky windows.

HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

Coraline thumps the carpet bump again and pounds up the

stairs.

PARENT'S ROOM/BATHROOM

A FRAMED PHOTO sits in the foreground on a beside table.

It shows a younger, happier Coraline with her parents by

the BEAR FOUNTAIN at the Detroit Zoo. RACK FOCUS to

bedroom door as it swings into the room, with Coraline

hanging on it. She drops to the ground and, doll and pad

in hand, decides to check out the bathroom.

When she pulls aside the mildewed shower curtain she

finds a hundred skittering SILVERFISH BUGS.

Disgusted, she jumps into the tub and smashes as many as

she can.

She turns on the faucet to wash her hands, only to get

soaked with rusty water from the shower head.

She shakes out her hair.

HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

Coraline pounds down the stairs, spots the carpet bump

again in the hallway and jumps on it. A closet door

opens, a light on inside, and she goes to investigate.

WATER HEATER CLOSET

ANGLE OVER water heater on Coraline. She jots down one

rusty water heater in her pad. As she leaves, she flicks

off the light switch, not noticing a note taped beside it

that says: Do not turn off!

INT. STUDY - SAME

Lights flicker and then Charlie's computer dies. He

hollers.

INT. HALLWAY - SAME

Coraline reacts with guilty alarm, runs back to the

closet and --

INT. CLOSET - SAME

-- spots the Do not turn off note. She flips the light

switch back on and gets out of there.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

The room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out

on rain and gray. The floor is strewn with moving boxes,

a few pieces of furniture, Charlie's old Nordic Track. A

few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard

mattress box leans against a corner wall.

Coraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in

her pad. She sets the doll on a low table beside an open

moving box and smiles.

The box is filled with her mom's collection of

SNOWGLOBES. She takes out her favorite - the BEAR

FOUNTAIN AT THE DETROIT ZOO - and shakes it. She studies

the globe and sighs with homesickness. She sets it

carefully on the FIREPLACE MANTEL, then unwraps the rest

of the snowglobes and places them beside it.

Over the mantel hangs a PAINTING of a CRYING BOY IN BLUE -

a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand

holding an EMPTY CONE. Coraline takes up pad and pen and

adds to her list, muttering aloud.

She turns to grab the doll off the table by the snow

globe box. It's gone.

Scanning the room, she spots the doll LOOKING OUT FROM

BEHIND THE MATTRESS BOX leaned against the corner wall.

Perplexed, she walks over and kneels down to grab the

doll when she notices SOMETHING ON THE WALL behind the

box.

She shoves the box aside, and discovers the outline of a

SMALL DOOR that's been wallpapered over.

Intensely curious, she calls to the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Mom, typing away, ignores her.

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Coraline tries to open it but there's no handle.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Mel gets up, really annoyed. Big sigh.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

She walks over to Coraline, looks at the outline of the

door in the ratty old wallpaper.

Coraline nods her head quickly, PANTING like a dog.

She heads back to the kitchen.

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Mel pulls open a drawer, pushes a bunch of loose brass

and nickel keys aside to find a small, sharp black key.

Holds it up.

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mel cuts the wallpaper around the door and sticks the key

in the lock. Coraline looks on, giddy with anticipation,

the doll at her side. Mel turns the key, unlocks the

door, and pulls it open to reveal ... an UNBROKEN BRICK

WALL. Coraline is totally disappointed.

Coraline scratches her wrist rash with annoyance.

Mel gets up to leave.

Mel leaving room, turns back, and loses it.

She exits. Coraline makes annoyed sound.

Coraline pushes the little door shut, her head lowered.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

WIDE ANGLE ON HOUSE. Pouring rain. We hear Charlie

singing a song about Coraline, badly.

INT. KITCHEN - SAME

CHARLIE, using OVEN MITT to protect his hand, takes a

BURNED-UP CASSEROLE DISH from the oven while mom closes

up her LAPTOP. Coraline sits at the table with her doll.

CHARLIE sets the dish on the table.

Coraline pushes it away, disgusted.

Coraline HUFFS.

Coraline looks to her doll, cradles its head.

She makes the doll's head nod "yes." Coraline rolls her

eyes, looks up to the heavens and --

INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - SAME

-- falls back, washed and dressed for bed, on her pillow.

Still raining out. Coraline puts the doll on the chair

beside her, then scratches at her wrist. ORIGAMI

DRAGONFLIES are strung between the tall, thin bed posts;

the TURTLE SHELL she found in the garden sits up on a

box, her NIGHT LAMP that projects stars and moons is

warming up on the bedside table. Despite her efforts at

decorating, Coraline's new bedroom feels small and cold,

cracked and faded.

Coraline reaches for a framed PHOTO that rests on a toy

PRAYING MANTIS by her night lamp.

It's her TWO BEST FRIENDS from home, posing in the snow

by her old school's marquee, its letters rearranged to

spell "CORALINE, GOOD BYE!" She touches her friends'

faces with her fingertips.

She puts back the photo, hits the light switch over her

bed and, looking over at the doll, sighs.

Her breathing slows and, with the doll WATCHING HER, she

starts to fall asleep.

INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - DREAMTIME

--SURREAL MIST SWIRLS out her window. MOONS AND STARS

SLOWLY MOVE across the walls.

SOMETHING in the room goes t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up,

awake. SOMETHING CHITTERS under her bed. She leans over

her bedside, head first, peering underneath when a ghost-

pale KANGAROO MOUSE JUMPS OUT and bounds out the door.

INT. HALL - SAME

She gives chase, down the upper hall, down the stairs,

snaps on the lower hall light, sees it hop into the

living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Coraline enters. The mouse edges out from beneath the

sofa, then hops frantically toward the SMALL DOOR behind

the wallpaper! Coraline runs and dives, but the door is

open a crack, and the mouse escapes.

Coraline grabs the door's edge and pulls it open. Instead

of a brick wall, there is a DARK, EXPANDING TUNNEL, with

the hopping mouse heading towards a bluish light at the

far end.

She catches her breath, pulls the door wider and CRAWLS

THROUGH.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Coraline MOVES FORWARD, towards the light ahead.

INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM  CONTINUOUS

Coraline steps out through the same little door, into

what looks like the EXACT SAME LIVING ROOM she just left,

only something is different -- it feels deeper, more

dimensional.

She looks around, notices the painting over the

fireplace: the crying blue boy is now SMILING, his shirt

clean and his ice cream back on his cone.

From across the hall, warm light comes from the kitchen

and the smell of delicious food wafts towards her nose.

INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT

Coraline enters to see her mother cooking at the stove,

wearing an apron and ROOSTER-HEAD OVEN MITTS. The light

and colors are much warmer and the details more perfect

in this kitchen. Other Mother is facing away from

Coraline as she works.

Her mother turns from the stove to greet her and Coraline

is DUMBSTRUCK: she's got BUTTONS FOR EYES! She beams with

happiness at Coraline's arrival.

Coraline points to her own eye.

She taps one with her nail.

She opens the oven door and the intoxicating perfume of

great cooking fills the air. Coraline breathes it in,

suddenly VERY HUNGRY.

INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME

Coraline goes down the hall and opens the study door.

INT. OTHER STUDY - CONTINUOUS

She sees the back of a man like her father, only with

more hair. Instead of tapping away at his computer,

though, he's picking notes on a BABY GRAND PIANO.

He turns around. He, too, has SHINY BUTTON EYES. He seems

happier and a little more handsome than real Dad, and

wears an IRIDESCENT ROBE over POLKA DOT PAJAMAS, with

ORANGE MONKEY SLIPPERS on his feet. He smiles broadly.

DR. SEUSS GLOVES  connected with rods and pulleys  POP

OUT of the piano's front and ONTO HIS HANDS. His hands

RAISE UP  then DROP DOWN to play pounding STRIDE PIANO

as Other Father SINGS out.

Coraline is amazed as his hands fly.

Anxious, she taps his shoulder to stop him.

He sticks his hand up, still in a glove, and his other

gloved hand slaps his face. She LAUGHS, then covers her

mouth.

INT. OTHER DINING ROOM - SAME

Other Mother sets down a HUGE, ROASTED CHICKEN near

Coraline on a table spread with CANDLES, fine CHINA and

SILVER and a PINEAPPLE CENTERPIECE. FIGURE EIGHT MODEL

TRAIN TRACKS circle twin LAZY SUSANS covered in dishes of

POTATOES, SWEET PEAS, ROLLS, and CORN. The Other Father

seals this Norman Rockwell moment by making PRAYER HANDS

and a solemn face.

He laughs with glee then a STARTING BELL rings and it's

time to eat. Other Father really digs in while Coraline

tries some chicken.

Other Mother GIGGLES as a MODEL TRAIN circles round the

track, pulling a GRAVY BOAT CAR and blowing its whistle.

The train goes in one side of the centerpiece and comes

out the other, slowing till the gravy boat lines up with

Coraline's plate, where it POURS GRAVY on her potatoes.

Other Mother looks on approvingly, not touching any food

herself.

A beautiful CHANDELIER DRINK DISPENSER descends.

The dispenser SPINS, stops and fills her glass while

Other Mother presents dessert: a cake with candles that

POP UP and LIGHT THEMSELVES while the words "WELCOME

HOME!" write themselves in icing. Coraline is taken

aback.

Her Other Parents squeeze each other's hands warmly.

Coraline remains a little unsure.

She smiles at Coraline, her button eyes gleaming.

She taps her fingers a little too excitedly on the table.

THUNDER, LIGHTNING, then RAIN appears outside the window.

Other Mother rises, walks towards Coraline.

The takes Coraline's rashy hand, but Coraline pulls it

away.

Coraline adjusts her tone.

Other Father steps in beside her.

They lead her from the table towards the stairs to her

bedroom.

INT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - SAME

In this world, Coraline's bedroom is a dream come true:

it is filled with rich color and light; there's a fire in

the fireplace, a sheer, lacy canopy over her now

beautiful bed. And her favorite toys are alive!

Her ORIGAMI DRAGONFLIES FLUTTER towards her.

Her BLUE SQUID greets her with a WAVE of its tentacle.

The TURTLE SHELL she'd found CIRCLES HER FEET on clothes

pin legs, making PANTING SOUNDS. She laughs, then hears

two voices from beside her bed.

She jumps onto the bed, grabs the photo of her best

friends from home, now ALIVE IN THE PHOTO.

Coraline grins hugely, then, exhausted, she yawns,

stretching out her arms.

The Other Mother, in the bedside chair, takes her hand

and applies some SOOTHING BLACK MUD to Coraline's poison

oak rash.

The Other Mother gently tucks her in then she and the

Other Father smile at Coraline as she drifts off to

sleep.

See you soon ...              See you soon ...

INT. CORALINE'S REAL BEDROOM - MORNING

Coraline awakens. She looks around expecting bright

colors, a magic dragonfly. But it's just her NORMAL ROOM:

moving boxes; cracks in the ceiling -- nothing's changed.

She notices the BUTTON-EYED DOLL on the chair where she

left it, where the Other Mother was sitting. She picks it

up, absentmindedly goes to scratch her wrist. She stops,

noticing that the rash on her wrist IS GONE.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Coraline goes to the little door, still ajar. She peeks

behind and finds the WALL OF SOLID BRICKS. Yes, it was

only a dream.

She shakes her head and pushes the door shut. The kettle

blows from the kitchen.

KITCHEN - DAY, GROUND FOG OUT WINDOWS

Breakfast. Mel and Charlie finish their "Go Lean

Breakfast Twigs" and mugs of instant coffee. Preoccupied

with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts

her dream, her breakfast untouched. FOG lies outside the

windows.

He stands, put his dishes in the sink. Whispers over his

SHOULDER:

She points to her rash-free wrists. He nods.

Mel CLEARS HER THROAT, interrupting.

He crisply salutes her, turns on his heel, and marches

out the door. Mel gets up to clear the table with

Coraline.

Coraline sighs, gets up to go.

EXT. HOUSE, FRONT PORCH - MORNING

It's drizzling and a WHITE FOG has lowered over the house

and grounds. Coraline  yellow rain poncho, garden SHEARS

in hand  opens the front door. Stepping out onto the

porch, she TRIPS on a big bundle of mail. Annoyed, she

picks it up, starts leafing through the envelopes.

Smells something bad, sniffs the envelopes.

She goes down the front steps and finds a sign that reads

"Bobinsky there" with an arrow that points up long,

winding outside stairs. With an "oh well" shrug, she goes

up.

EXT. HOUSE, BOBINSKY'S - CONTINUOUS

At the top, she knocks on the door, a little anxious.

She knocks again.

The door swings open. Curious, Coraline peeks inside:

it's dark and cramped with something boiling on the stove

and a caged chicken.

Suddenly a HUGE BLUE MAN swings down behind her and

SCOLDS:

She whips around to find MR. Bobinsky - upside down,

reaching right at her face! She ducks and he reaches past

her to his actual target - his door knob - and pulls it

shut.

The Russian giant, dressed in a sleeveless T-shirt and

shorts, pulls a RAW BEET from his pants. He's not happy.

She holds out his mail. Bobinsky takes it, smelling the

stinky envelopes deeply. Nods approvingly.

He swings down like a spider monkey and stands beside her

on the balcony. Coraline backs away.

He smells his mail again, makes pleased sound, then seems

to fall off the side of the third story porch! Coraline

rushes over, looks down. He cartwheels in from the porch

railing behind her.

He opens his door, crouches low and turns. He hands her a

beet.

He scuttles inside and slams the door shut. Coraline

mutters.

Looking at the beet, she makes a disgusted sound and

tosses it away, then heads down the stairs.

EXT HOUSE, SOUTH SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS

When she gets to the bottom, she starts towards the back,

gardening shears out.

She looks up.

Bobinsky LEAPS all the way to the ground, landing beside

her, out of breath.

Mr. B nods gravely. He leans down, so close his moustache

touches her ear, and whispers, his voice DEAD-SERIOUS.

Coraline is startled.

The old man shrugs, straightens.

He points to his head and rotates his finger.

He starts back up the stairs.

Coraline stares after him.

EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

SHEARS IN HAND, Coraline approaches the family VW, where

one PINK SUITCASE remains tied to the roof. She snips it

free and takes out her special HAT, a black Japanese

schoolboy's cap.

EXT. HOUSE, STAIRWELL DOWNSTAIRS FLAT  SAME

Coraline climbs down the steps to the basement flat. At

the door, she tries the comedy/tragedy door knocker and

waits. Nothing. She glances down at the doormat - it

reads "No whistling in the house."

She peers through the door glass. A YAPPING DOG suddenly

LEAPS UP inside, startling her, and a moment after, MISS

SPINK  wearing some sort of house robe  opens the door

and three SCOTTIE DOGS  HAMISH, JOCK, AND ANGUS  shoot

out and surround Coraline. Spink tries to quiet them

down.

INT. MISSES SPINK & FORCIBLE'S FLAT - SAME

Miss Spink leads Coraline into the living area, as MISS

FORCIBLE, taller and sporting a platinum wig and a very

large bosom, prepares tea in the kitchen to the side. The

dogs race ahead and jump onto the sofa. Coraline scans

the walls to see framed POSTERS from the "Shakespeare"

the ladies used to perform like King Leer and Julius

Seize Her. Miss Forcible peers out her, half-blind

without her glasses.

Forcible grabs a handful of tea, puts it in the pot and

pours boiling water in.

The dogs leap off the sofa and, as Coraline takes their

place, she looks to the side and sees a towering bookcase

filled with STUFFED SCOTTY DOGS IN KNITTED SWEATERS WITH

ANGEL WINGS.

Miss Forcible arrives with a tea tray and urges Coraline

to take a candy as Spink goes on and on.

Coraline reaches for a pink and green one. But the taffy

is so old and sticky, her fingers get stuck. Then her

other hand gets stuck, trying to get the first hand out.

Coraline, using her feet, finally un-sticks the candy

bowl which FLIES UP and sticks to the ceiling.

She turns to Coraline, about to sip her tea. Spink

indicates cup.

Coraline gulps down the bitter brew.

Coraline passes her the cup. Spink puts a saucer on top

and swirls it three times, removes the saucer and peers

in at the abstract leaf pattern. She purses her lips.

Miss Forcible snorts.

Spink passes the cup to Forcible, who adjusts thick

glasses and peers closely into it.

Spink forcibly rotates the cup.

Coraline wants more information.

The ladies, heads side by side, gaze into the cup. We see

a SPIKY CLAW formed from the leaves.

Forcible rotates the cup back again. Upside down, the

claw hand looks like a GIRAFFE.

The stuck candy dish suddenly CRASHES to the floor.

Coraline asks in a practical voice:

Coraline thinks it over, then shakes her head.

She gets up and leaves, the dogs immediately return to

their sofa.

The ladies resume their card game with Miss Spink turning

to the dogs.

EXT. HOUSE, TOP OF BASEMENT FLAT STAIRS - SAME

Coraline climbs the stairs up to ground level, intrigued

by her fortune.

Behind her, a PERISCOPE RISES from the WAIST-DEEP FOG.

Coraline just catches it in her peripheral view.

She frowns but doesn't let on she's aware of it. She

walks ahead nonchalantly, the periscope following her,

then suddenly turns and GRABS it, PULLING UP WYBIE, then

PUNCHES him in the arm.

Wybie takes some SALAD TONGS from a tool belt, snaps

them.

There's a soft meowing from under his coat. He opens it

up and the BLACK CAT EMERGES and climbs onto his

shoulders.

Cat glares at her angrily.

Tired of her company, the cat jumps off Wybie, onto a

tree and up onto the roof of the house. Coraline softens.

Wybie, scanning under the ground fog for slugs, sticks

his head up for a moment.

Coraline is highly skeptical. Wybie returns to his hunt.

Wybie stands excitedly and presents a HUGE YELLOW-GREEN

SLUG to Coraline.

She's not impressed.

He looks from the slug to himself.

Wybie nods, not listening again, takes his camera --

-- hands it to her. She acts put-out, but frames a shot.

He signals he's ready and she fires off one auto-flash

shot after another as he strikes silly poses making SOUND

EFFECTS: horrified of the slug one moment; ready to eat

it the next; pretending it's something from his nose in

another. She can't help but GIGGLE.

Finished, Wybie tosses the slug back into the fog, and

takes the camera back. He lowers his head, thoughtful,

then glances up past Coraline at the house. He SIGHS and

speaks in a SAD TONE.

ANGLE from roof, over CAT'S SHOULDER as dialog continues.

Cat senses something and turns -- it's Coraline's DOLL AT

THE WINDOW, looking like it's spying on things.

BACK TO KIDS. Wybie, astride his electric bike now,

WHISTLES and the black cat jumps down from the roof, onto

his shoulders.

We hear Wybie's agitated grandmother call out.

Wybie turns away: he's said too much.

He starts to pull away.

And he's gone. PUSH IN on her pensive face.

INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CU ON DOLL FACE, back in   the chair by the bed. Coraline

takes some yellow cheese   from her pocket and puts it by

the door: mice bait. She   lies down and her breathing

slows, the doll watching   her with a nearly IMPERCEPTIBLE

SMILE on its face.

INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM - LATER

Coraline sleeping, lighting suggests another dream. SOME

THINGS go t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up, looks to her

door, and spots a COUPLE OF KANGAROO MICE stealing the

last bit of cheese.

INT. UPPER HALL - SAME

She gives chase after the mice, hopping down the stairs

with the cheese.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Coraline follows the kangaroo mice directly to the little

door, opened a crack, where they disappear.

She pulls it open. Bricks are gone; tunnel revealed. She

doesn't hesitate this time to crawl through the door.

INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT

Coraline enters Other Kitchen to find Other Mother

preparing a delicious breakfast. She looks PRETTIER

tonight; her black hair shining, lips REDDER. She stops

HUMMING A LULLABY to greet Coraline.

She is grating YELLOW CHEESE into scrambled eggs.

Beams at Coraline.

Other Mother SHUSHES her and pops a strawberry in her

mouth.

Coraline shrugs okay, starts for the door.

EXT STUDY DOOR TO BACK PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Looking out, she sees the broken-down garden from the

real world, still grey and lifeless in the dim light.

EXT. OTHER GARDEN - SAME

Coraline opens the gate to the garden. A large CRESCENT

MOON RISES, and THINGS START TO GROW.

Two dead shrubs start to RISE, then BLOSSOM, then the

blossoms themselves are LIT UP by some GOLD AND AMBER

HUMMINGBIRDS.

The hummingbirds circle around Coraline, light her

DRAGONFLY BARRETTE, then continue on, LIGHTING UP PITCHER

PLANTS that have grown up in a nearby flower bed. A

beautiful FROG POKES OUT of one blossom.

The birds lead Coraline up steps past a stone wall where

BLEEDING HEART GROW, AND GLOW, AND BEAT.

She spots the Other Father, riding a PRAYING MANTIS

TRACTOR on the hillside, planting SEEDS that instantly

grow into FLOWERING PLANTS.

He waves back, calling:

A gang of SNAP DRAGONS goes at her, TICKLING Coraline

till she falls down. Her squeals of delight grow into

HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.

The Other Father hears this and looks over.

He guns the tractor full-speed over a little bridge,

grabbing a GOURD TRUMPET from a vine and blowing it.

JACK-O-LANTERNS surface in the pond below and spout

STREAMS OF WATER.

Arriving beside Coraline, he waggles his finger at the

naughty snapdragons.

Then he deftly cuts a bouquet of them and presents it to

Coraline. She nods thanks.

She does. The Other Father grabs the GEARSHIFT KNOB,

pulls it, and the mechanical mantis SPROUTS WINGS. They

RISE in the air. Looking down, she sees that the garden

is a PORTRAIT OF CORALINE.

He pulls a lever and they ZOOM out of frame.

INT. OTHER KITCHEN - SAME

Coraline doesn't hold back this time. She stacks sausages

on eggs on top of waffles, rolls it up and stuffs it in

her mouth. The Other Mother FEEDS BITS OF SAUSAGE to the

HUNGRY SNAPDRAGONS bouquet now in a vase.

Coraline hurries to shovel in the rest of her meal, while

her Other Parents smile at one another.

There's a KNOCK at the door. Other Mother opens it to

reveal the OTHER WYBIE. He's cleaner, with better

posture, and cute button eyes.

The boy nods, button eyes shining.

He just makes a shy smile, doesn't answer. She's

confused.

She looks Other Wybie over appreciatively.

Coraline heads out the door with the mute boy.

EXT. OTHER ESTATE HOUSE - SAME

The Other House  lit by amber spotlights looks MAGICAL

with ornate GINGERBREAD TRIM; glowing TOPIARY in the

yard. The kids come out the front door.

Other Wybie nods in agreement. Coraline and he start up

the stairs to Bobinsky's.

She points to her mouth. There's an awkward moment and

then he points past her, excitedly: a SMALL BLIMP is

flying towards Bobinsky's door.

They run up the stairs and watch it slip through an

opening above his door. Coraline knocks and the door

suddenly SPINS, THROWING THEM INSIDE.

INT. OTHER MR. BOBINSKY'S FLAT - SAME

They somersault to a stop and sit up. Down two rows of

SMALL CANNONS that face each, an amazing MINIATURE CIRCUS

has been set up, with a FERRIS WHEEL beside it.

Coraline goes right to the Ferris wheel where a

MECHANICAL CHICKEN eats dried corn on the cob, fires up

its belly, then POOPS OUT POPCORN into paper bags.

Other Wybie stomps a firing button and COTTON CANDY

shoots out of a cannon. He catches the cone, then starts

firing off all the cannons. Coraline looks back to find

him covered in the cotton candy.

Spotlights come on in the big top, the entrance opens,

and a big voice is heard over loudspeakers.

They race to the entrance, stoop down to crawl inside.

INT. MINIATURE BIG TOP - SAME

They sit between miniature grandstands and watch as the

little BLIMP, bathed in spotlights, enters through a

flap. It circles around, rising to the top of the tent,

then NOSE-DIVES towards the ground! It CRASHES in the

center of the circus ring, and OPENS LIKE A FLOWER from

which 50 JUMPING MICE spring up like Chinese acrobats to

spell out C O R A L I N E.

The jumping mice leap to the ground in formation,

BRANDISH TINY INSTRUMENTS, and DRUMMERS START POUNDING.

The DRUM MAJOR MOUSE parachutes down and whips out a

BATON. On his signal, the group launch into a WILD

RUSSIAN CIRCUS MARCH.

Coraline, grinning, turns to the Other Wybie.

The boy smiles and nods to the beat of the bass drums as

the hopping band marches in and out of ever changing

formations - PINWHEELS, X's, CIRCLES WITHIN CIRCLES.

They hoppers begin to SPIRAL to the center of the circus

ring when the floor RISES UP from its center to form a

six-foot Tower of Babel, the mice HOPPING TO THE TOP. The

DRUM MAJOR balances on the tippy-top on a COLORFUL CIRCUS

BALL.

He RUNS the ball DOWN AND AROUND the spiral as the MICE

HOP OFF, and when he hits the ground, the TOWER DROPS

AWAY to reveal the OTHER MISTER BOBINSKY! He CRACKS A

WHIP.

Coraline and Other Wybie STAND and CLAP. Other Bobinsky

in a RINGMASTER'S OUTFIT with a full length cape  bows

graciously, doffing his tall black hat. His moustache is

waxed, his eyes black buttons.

On cue, the entire jumping mice band DISAPPEARS INTO

OTHER MR. B'S SLEEVES while the drum major SWINGS UP from

the man's moustache and onto his head, where he's quickly

hidden by the tall black hat.

She happily turns to Other Wybie, beaming with joy.

Bobinsky takes her hand to kiss it.

INT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - SAME

Other Mother kisses SLEEPING CORALINE'S forehead, sits

back in the bedside chair. Other Father, close by, pulls

a cotton candy cone off Other Wybie and munches it.

Coraline's Other Parents smile warmly, knowing something

secret that makes them glad.

INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - DAY

EARLY MORNING. Coraline once again wakes in own bed in

the real world, the little doll  left on the chair  now

clutched against her chest.

Her gaze moves from the doll to where she left the cheese

by the door. It's GONE. This is much too confusing.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Coraline tries the small door in the corner wall. It's

locked. What the heck?

EXT. SMALL OFFICE BUILDING IN TOWN - DAY

--SQUEALING brakes, as the Jones' JEEP pulls up in front

of "Northwest Garden" headquarters. TOWNSFOLK in

SHAKESPEAREAN COSTUMES stand about, advertising a local

festival. Coraline is sharing her latest dream:

ON FAMILY: Coraline continues from back seat as her

father and mother review their work pages.

Her parents, preoccupied, ignore her.

Gives her an "aren't you funny" look, opens door. Mel

looks back at Coraline.

She makes the hand-thumb bottle sign. Charlie leans in to

Coraline, pinches her nose.

Coraline cuts him off, embarrassed.

Dad sighs, heads up the steps to his appointment as Mel

and Coraline drive off.

INT. UNIFORMS DEPARTMENT STORE - SAME

PRESIDENT'S DAY SALE. Mel piles gray blouses, a navy

skirt, white socks onto the arms of a CLERK.

Sitting alone on some stairs, Coraline sees a pair of

fancy GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES.

As she tries them on, a YOUNG RASCAL in costume with

sword BOUNCES PAST her down the stairs on a WHEELED STEP

STOOL - his FATHER in pursuit.

There's an off screen crash, then the step stool rolls

back to Coraline. She gets an idea.

Mel is checking out school blouses, when Coraline rolls

past, first one direction, then the other, modeling the

colorful gloves. Without looking up, her mom tells her:

Coraline mutters:

Coraline scowls and stomps away to return the gloves.

INT. CAR - SAME

Coraline and Mel are driving home, shopping bags in back.

They pull into their DRIVEWAY.

INT. KITCHEN - SAME

Mel pulls out salsa, mustard, catsup, stale tortillas

from the fridge.

Coraline, carrying in the bags from outside, makes a

face.

Coraline squinches up her nose.

Coraline plops down in a chair.

Mel reaches out and musses Coraline's hair. The girl

pulls away.

Mom rolls her eyes, shaking her head, and opens the door

to leave.

Shuts the door.

She leaves.

INT. KITCHEN - SAME

Coraline pulls open the key drawer, looking for the small

black key. Not there. She looks around, then spots it

hanging on a hook above a door. She stands on a chair and

snags it.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Coraline stoops in front of the small door and pushes the

key into the keyhole and unlocks the door.

She listens for her mother's car. Nothing. Grasping the

key between thumb and forefinger, she closes her eyes,

she pulls the door open.

ANGLE ON CORALINE: A SOFT BREEZE MOVES her hair. She

knows before her eyes open that the BRICKS ARE GONE.

She opens her eyes, smiles, and CRAWLS FORWARD.

ANGLE ON CORALINE THROUGH WINDOW. CAMERA PULLS BACK and

we FIND the BLACK CAT, perched on the wet window sill,

OBSERVING Coraline as she disappears into the tunnel.

With a look of concern, he exits frame.

INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT

Lunch is ready and waiting for her: foot-long hotdogs

with relish; grilled cheese sandwiches with gherkins;

curly-fries; piles of coleslaw and potato salad; five

flavors of soda-pop. There's a NOTE attached to a GIFT-

WRAPPED BOX:

Coraline tears open the box and finds a pair of beautiful

BLUE BOOTS, BLACK CORDUROY TROUSERS, and a METALLIC GREY

SWEATER WITH TWINKLING STARS.

She holds up the sweater to her body, smiles, then puts

down the clothes and digs into lunch.

EXT. OTHER HOUSE - SAME

Coraline, dressed in her FANCY NEW CLOTHES, steps onto

the FRONT PORCH and BURPS. It's always nighttime in this

world.

A CAT MEEEROWS. Coraline looks up to see a BLACK CAT on

the porch roof above her.

Coraline raises her brows, studies the animal a moment.

The cat LEAPS down and lands on the railing by the

basement stairs. He shakes his head and SPEAKS!

He tips his head to one side, opal blue eyes glinting.

Coraline is surprised.

The cat shrugs from the tip of his tail to his whiskers.

He leaps smoothly from the railing and onto a large,

FALLEN TREE.

Climbs up the tree's upended roots, head held high and

proud.

Coraline forces herself to be polite.

He DISAPPEARS behind one a thick root that sticks up,

then REAPPEARS from a large knot hole beside Coraline,

startling her.

He pokes his HEAD DOWN into the knot hole, then POPS IT

UP out of ANOTHER KNOT-HOLE, ten feet away.

Cat climbs the tree's branches onto the roof.

The cat looks at her, pitying her lack of intelligence.

Suddenly, the cat drops into a crouch and freezes,

sensing something.

He SCRAMBLES across the roof and disappears around the

corner.

Coraline shrugs, skeptical, and heads down to Spink and

Forcible's, their door now circled with CHASER LIGHTS.

INT. MISS SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S OTHER APARTMENT - SAME

She pushes past elegant VELVET CURTAINS to discover an

enormous, darkened THEATER with dim rows of seats and a

high WOODEN STAGE.

A FLASHLIGHT comes towards her, carried by a black

SCOTTIE DOG with button eyes. He looks up at her, sniffs,

then leads her down the aisle past rows and rows of

BUTTON-EYED SCOTTIES, to a front seat by the Other Wybie.

She squeezes his arm hello, he looks back warmly.

Light flash, the audience quiets, then the curtains open

on a SEASIDE SETTING with ROTATING WAVES. OTHER MISS

SPINK rises up on stage left, in a MERMAID SUIT, large

WIG, BUTTON EYES, and UKULELE.

And Miss Spink sings.

A flat cut-out ship manned by cut-out men rows in behind

her.

She bows her head and the audience of dogs THUMP their

tails.

Spink is LOWERED through the stage floor, the SCENERY

CHANGES, and on the right, a huge SCALLOP SHELL RISES up

with the OTHER MISS FORCIBLE, clad in the bare minimum -

her homage to Botticelli's BIRTH OF VENUS. She's facing

the wrong way.

A dog HOWLS, alerting the near-blind lady, who turns to

the audience and begins the next verse.

The dogs thump and woof, Wybie and Coraline clap.

Spink, furious at the greater reaction, gets back in the

competition. Rising up, she makes it clear just who she's

dissing.

But Forcible is up to the challenge - the scenery starts

to change faster and faster as the ladies rise up and

down, competing.

The set rigging can't take it anymore -- ropes snap,

sandbags swing, scenery starts to fall.

With a crash, the old ladies TUMBLE DOWN IN A PILE.

Coraline winces. The audience HOWLS with laughter as the

curtains close on the disaster.

DRUM ROLL. A SCOTTIE DOG pushes a large BUCKET OF WATER,

labeled "POOL", onto center stage. Spotlights tilt up to

the top of very tall diving platforms WHERE THE OLD

LADIES NOW STAND. Coraline can't stand it.

They begin to bounce on the diving boards. As they bounce

up, the two troupers unzip FAT SUIT DISGUISES from which

emerge their YOUNGER BEAUTIFUL SELVES which LEAP to catch

matching TRAPEZE BARS that swing into place.

Coraline LAUGHS with relief and amazement, Other Wybie

pleased. Dogs WOOF, MUSIC BEGINS and the TWO BEAUTIES

eyes BRIGHT BUTTONS, SEXY BATHING SUITS striped pink and

green  SWING OUT over the stage.

They FLY past each other on their trapezes, double up,

catch one another hand to ankle. We notice a LARGE PEARL

RING on Forcible's finger.

In a SUDDEN change of direction, they SWING OUT over the

audience, trapeze bar LOWERING and PULL CORALINE INTO THE

AIR! She HOLLERS, terrified.

They expertly TOSS HER one to the other, FLIPPING AND

SPINNING, as they continue their lines. Her SCREAMS

become CRIES OF EXHILARATION.

Coraline swings face-to-face to the dogs in the royal box

seats where one licks her.

The acrobats TOSS CORALINE UP into the air and JACK-KNIFE

DIVE into the large bucket below. They rise up, unhurt,

just in time to catch Coraline. The THREE BOW to

THUNDEROUS THUMPING APPLAUSE and, as the camera pulls

back on the scene, Other Wybie throws her a rose!

EXT. OTHER ESTATE HOUSE - NIGHT

Other Wybie escorts Coraline up the stone stairs from

Spink and Forcible's apartment. The Other Mother and

Other Father, a huge, full moon rising behind them, wait

at the top of the stairs.

Other Mother's hair looks absolutely beautiful and Other

Father dapper. Coraline shakes with excitement as they

walk toward the front porch. Other Wybie holds back,

loses his smile.

They walk up the front steps.

Other Father takes Coraline inside. Wybie, at the bottom

of the steps, looks GUILTY AND SAD. Other Mother glares

at him, makes a huge, false smile then points to him. He

just lowers his head.

INT. OTHER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Other Mother rests her hand on Coraline's shoulder.

INT. OTHER DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Coraline is seated in her place. The Other Mother places

a SMALL BOX with a bow in front of her, and takes her

seat along with Other Father. Coraline excitedly removes

the lid.

The "surprise" is a spool of BLACK THREAD, a SILVER

NEEDLE, and a pair of SHINY BLACK BUTTONS -- FOR

CORALINE'S EYES.

Coraline GASPS. She looks up at her Other Parents, hoping

it's a bad joke.

Coraline sees their button eyes changing colors, growing

ever more panicked.

She bats the box away, and her hands FLY to her face,

COVER her eyes.

Other Father tests the needle on his finger.

Other Mother KICKS him under the table. Embarrassed, he

puts the needle back in the box.

She walks over and puts her hand, now ICY COLD, on

Coraline's shoulder. Coraline PUSHES it away and STANDS

UP.

Coraline fights to control her quaking voice.

Other Mother stands, masking disappointment.

Coraline backs away, urging them to stay where they are.

She turns to leave and finds the Other Mother BLOCKING

THE DOORWAY. Other Father joins her.

She lets go. She and the Other Father herd Coraline

across the hallway to the stairs.

INT. OTHER HALLWAY, STAIRS, UPPER HALL - CONTINUOUS

Coraline carefully climbs the stairs, the Other Parents

watching. When they can no longer see her, she RACES up

the last steps and DASHES to her Other Bedroom.

INT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - TWILIGHT

Coraline shuts the door and is quickly surrounded by

fluttering DRAGONFLIES.

She jumps up and CATCHES the paper creatures, opens the

TOY CHEST and tosses them in.

The PLUSH BLUE SQUID greets her from the shelf, followed

by the TOY TANK GIRAFFE.

She GRABS them both and drops them in the toy chest.

Her PHOTO FRIENDS - NOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS FOR EYES -

call out from the photo by her bed.

Coraline grabs them as well, drops them in the chest, and

SHUTS the lid. She barricades the door with a DRESSER and

CHAIRS and then the TOY CHEST.

She sits on the bed, pulls off the blue boots then CLIMBS

UNDER THE COVERS, pulling them over her head and holding

tight. She HUGS herself to stop shaking, knowing she must

fall asleep in this bed to wake up in her real bed at

home. She closes her eyes and tells herself:

She tosses one way, then another. WE HEAR her voice

CONTINUE:

There are strange, backwards sounds, then the eerie

voices of Other Mother and Other Father.

Coraline fidgets and turns and turns again but sleep

finally wraps her and takes her to oblivion.

INT. OTHER BEDROOM - LATER

We see Coraline's room, BRIGHTLY LIT LIKE MORNING IN THE

REAL WORLD.

ANGLE ON Coraline's face beneath the covers, as she's

WOKEN by the light. With a hopeful look, she calls out,

pulls back the covers:

Her smile turns to shock -- there's a BRIGHT, FULL MOON

in her window and it's STILL NIGHTTIME IN THE OTHER

WORLD.

INT. OTHER STAIRS, LOWER HALLWAY - SAME

Coraline races downstairs to the Other Living Room where

the little door home must be! But the living room is

LOCKED TIGHT. She pulls at the handles, plants a foot and

tries with all her might! It's no use. She stops,

panting, then hears a piano note being hit over and over.

INT. OTHER FATHER'S STUDY - SAME

Coraline opens the door and finds the Other Father

sitting at the piano, his back to her, hitting the note.

She speaks in her bravest voice.

The Other Father turns around. He looks ill; his hair

messed and his glasses askew. He speaks, his voice slowed-

down.

The WHITE-GLOVED HANDS POP OUT from the piano. One COVERS

HIS MOUTH, the other WAGS A FINGER in his face.

She turns to go.

He PULLS DOWN the corners of his mouth impossibly far.

The PIANO HANDS pop out again, aggressively SHUT HIS

MOUTH and SPIN HIM away from Coraline. Frightened, she

runs to the door that leads outside, and pulls it open.

EXT. OTHER HOUSE - NIGHT, FULL MOON

She runs out the back porch, towards the Other Garden.

OTHER STEEP HILLSIDE TRAIL

She crosses the trail, the Other House in the distance.

ENTRANCE TO OTHER ORCHARD

She runs down the path.

OTHER ORCHARD

Coraline runs past trees that are LUSH WITH GREEN LEAVES

AND RIPE RED FRUIT.

She's panting hard, and has to slow to a fast walk. The

further she goes, the LESS TREE-LIKE the fruit trees

become.

She hears the CAT MEROWWW. Surprised, she looks down.

The cat trots along by her feet. She blinks.

The sky starts to BRIGHTEN and the apple trees become

WIRE-THIN SHAPES OF TREES.

The remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give

way to a PALE, EMPTY NOTHINGNESS. No ground or shadows.

They walk over the horizon.

OTHER HOUSE REAPPEARS

A SHAPE RISES in front of them in the whiteness and

becomes the beautiful OTHER HOUSE. Coraline and the cat

slow, then the front yard and topiary, the sky, hills,

white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them FILL

IN.

The cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its

head to one side.

Coraline shivers. The cat suddenly TENSES, focuses on a

shrub.

He bounds towards the shrub and chases out a CUTE

KANGAROO MOUSE in uniform with a TINY TRUMPET. Before

Coraline can blink, he's PINNED IT DOWN.

With a SWIFT BLOW of its paw, the cat KNOCKS the mouse

into the air, and catches it in his mouth. He gives a

QUICK, KILLING BITE - CORALINE GASPS - and the mouse

TRANSFORMS into a BIG DEAD RAT. Coraline is stunned. He

drops the rat on the ground.

The cat picks the rat up and heads off. Slack-jawed,

Coraline speaks with admiration.

Coraline looks to the house with a determined look.

On the porch, she takes out a HEAVY CANE from the

UMBRELLA STAND and hits it into her hand.

INT. HOUSE,   OTHER HALLWAY - SAME

Coraline, standing in front of the living room doors,

TESTS the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for

danger. It's dead quiet -- no piano, no sounds of

anything.

She JAMS the cane through the doors' handles, and PULLS

with all her might. One HANDLE AND LOCK BREAK and the

door swings open into the pitch black living room. The

hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other

Little Door on the far wall, cracked open. She steps into

the room.

INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A huge ARMOIRE BUG suddenly crab-steps in her path,

blocking the little door, and all around her things start

to glow. The room has been TRANSFORMED into an amazing

BUG MUSEUM, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens

in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. The

radiators are now big caterpillars, the Nordic Track a

serving bug.

The Other Mother speaks out, startling Coraline.

The sofa, now a LARGE BUG, turns in place to reveal her

sitting on it.

She's all smiles, button eyes shining, one hand held out

in a behold my handiwork gesture.

A BUG CHAIR scoops up Coraline and brings her to the

Other Mother.

The Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug.

She extends a CANDY DISH filled LIVING CHOCOLATE BEETLES.

Coraline is disgusted. The Other Mother takes back the

dish and BITES OFF THE HEAD OF ONE. It's the first thing

she's eaten in the film.

The Other Mother FROWNS, swallows. She speaks with a

FRIGHTENING STEELINESS in her voice.

Coraline is mad, and feeling mad makes her brave.

The Other Mother STRAIGHTENS. Her button eyes, now DEAD,

stare into Coraline's.

Coraline stares right back, not blinking.

Then she stands up, GROWING TALLER.

She grows TALLER STILL and SCARIER like a super model on

steroids.

This TALL OTHER MOTHER GRABS Coraline by her NOSE and

DRAGS her to the hallway.

INT. OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

She PULLS Coraline down the hallway to the mirror at the

end. Coraline flails at the Tall Other Mother with her

fists.

Tall Other Mother SHOVES Coraline RIGHT THROUGH THE

MIRROR as if it was water!

INT. CLOSET-PRISON BEHIND THE MIRROR - CONTINUOUS

Coraline HITS the ground hard. The Tall Other Mother,

head thrust through the mirror, stares down at her

angrily.

She PULLS HER HEAD OUT and leaves Coraline in DARKNESS.

Coraline pounds on the mirror-door, kicks it with her

blue boots. A SOB wells up in her throat.

And then we hear a SOFT GHOSTLY MOAN.

She turns. She can just make out a sagging iron bed. When

the voice speaks, there is a faint glow from beneath its

stained cover.

Coraline steps towards the bed, the faint glow from under

the covers in sync with the words she hears.

She gently pulls back the sheets.

The DIMLY GLOWING GHOSTS of THREE CHILDREN, BUTTON EYES,

SIT UP: a SWEET GIRL GHOST, Coraline's size; a TALL GIRL

GHOST, emotional; a young BOY GHOST, very sad.

The boy, dressed like Huck Finn, CONJURES up ghost

flowers.

The strange-looking flowers wither and fade. He's so sad

that Coraline takes his cold hand and squeezes it.

The ghosts move about in a dance macabre, like ghostly

fish in water.

The ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down.

Coraline is stunned. She thinks a little and then speaks,

trying to steady her voice.

A beat. Then the Sweet Girl asks in her sing-song way:

The ghosts PULSE with hope. Coraline sits down against

the mirror door, bounces her head against it. She's not

hopeless.

Suddenly, HANDS REACH THROUGH THE MIRROR and PULL HER

OUT!

INT. OTHER HALLWAY - NIGHT

C.U. of Coraline's FACE, eyes wild, as she TEARS at the

hands that hold her. She GRABS one and, FLIPS her MASKED

ATTACKER onto the ground. She pulls off his mask: it's

the OTHER WYBIE, his mouth stitched into a PAINFUL, EAR

TO EAR SMILE.

Coraline sits him up.

She unstitches his painfully-huge grin.

He stops her with a finger to her lips, and points to the

Other Living Room, its door UNLOCKED AND OPEN. He grabs

her hand and PULLS her there.

INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM  CONTINUOUS

It's dark, the bug furniture asleep. They run to the big

armoire bug that guards the little door and SHOVE IT out

of the way. It CRASHES to the floor. And from upstairs, a

voice calls out.

She opens the little door. A COLD WIND blows from the

dark passageway, now filled with SPIDER WEBS and the

SHOES, COATS, AND HATS of other kids who tried to escape.

The tunnel MOVES at the sound of her voice. Coraline

takes Other Wybie's arm.

He shakes his head no, then pulls off his glove to reveal

a HAND MADE OF SAWDUST. He blows his fingers away.

HIGH HEELS CLICK from the stairs; she's ALMOST THERE!

Other Wybie shoves Coraline into the tunnel and shuts the

door.

INT. PASSAGEWAY  CONTINUOUS

Hunched down, she moves as quickly as she can, tearing

through the sticky cobwebs.

Strands of web brush her face, stick to her hair; she

closes her eyes, hands out until she finally gets to the

little door at the other end. She DIVES, TUCKS, --

INT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS TIME, BUT DAY HERE

-- AND ROLLS OUT onto the REAL LIVING ROOM FLOOR.

Coraline SLAMS the door shut and turns the sharp little

key  still in the keyhole  to LOCK IT.

She stands, covered in dust and cobwebs, and calls out

with joy and relief.

INT. HALLWAY, STAIRWAY, DAD'S STUDY - SAME

She goes quickly through the apartment, happily calling:

INT. KITCHEN - SAME

There are bags of groceries on the table, as if her

mother had just gotten in. She pulls open a bag to peek

and FRUIT FLIES shoot out. The food is spoiled.

Door bell rings.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

She runs excitedly to the door and flings it open.

INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS, RAIN

But it's just Wybie, the real boy.

He's waves, face down, awkward.

Coraline tenses, sharp breath.

She reads him like a book.

Wybie answers quickly, guilty as heck.

Coraline, rushing the words, tells him the truth.

Her voice trails off. Coraline studies Wybie, then, snaps

her fingers.

He nods, one brow raising up.

She pulls him inside and--

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

--drags him down the hall.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Coraline WALKS HIM to the LITTLE DOOR in the corner wall

and points. Wybie looks around anxiously, fearful and

curious to be in his grandmother's old house.

Reluctantly, he bends down and reaches for the key in the

lock.

She grabs his hand, stops him.

Wybie stares at her, nodding his head as if he

understands her crazy story. He changes the subject, gets

back to his mission.

Coraline snaps at him.

She exhales in a huff. Grabs his sleeve, leads him from

room.

INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The doll's not on the bed, not on the chairs or moving

boxes.

Wybie nervously watches Coraline pull out her dresser

drawers, yank cushions off the window seat.

Wybie, trapped like a deer-in-the-headlights, tries to

make sense of her remarks.

Holds her hands up.

Wybie, eager to escape, cups hand to ear by the window.

Coraline sees right through him.

He moves around her towards the door, turns to leave.

A blue boot - thrown by Coraline - HITS his arm. He turns

back as she takes off the second one.

He FLEES as the second boot flies past. Coraline GROWLS,

and gives chase.

INT UPPER STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS

She grabs her boots from the floor, and CHASES him down

the stairs in her socks.

EXT. FRONT DOOR/DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS, RAINING

Door flies open and Wybie RUNS down the front steps to

his electric bike. Coraline RACES down after him.

He RUNS his bike towards the FALLEN TREE, HOPS ON and

PEDALS LIKE MAD. As Coraline hurls a boot at him, he GUNS

the motor and escapes down a side path past the driveway.

Out of breath, she turns away and notices her PARENTS'

CAR parked to the side.

Excited, she hops over the fallen tree and runs to the

car.

INT. JONES' CAR - SAME

Coraline, standing in the rain, excitedly looks through

the car's window. But the car is EMPTY. She spots her

mom's PHONE, then opens the door to grabs it and speed

dial a number.

She dejectedly looks at the phone, then snaps it shut.

INT. SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Miss Spink is knitting a SWEATER WITH WINGS for a worried-

looking ANGUS, one of the Scotties, who sits on her lap.

Coraline sips tea, anxious, the other two DOGS beside

her.

ANGLE ON Miss Forcible, tightening her elaborate corset

behind a screen, using pulleys and hooks.

One of the corset hooks FLIES UP and pulls off her wig.

She ignores it and comes over to address Spink.

Coraline CLEARS HER THROAT, frustrated.

Miss Forcible grabs another dish of old stuck-together

candy and puts it in front of Coraline.

Miss Spink suddenly RAISES her KNITTING NEEDLES as if to

STAB CORALINE. Coraline yelps, hands up in defense. But

it's CANDIES she attacks, sending sticky chips flying,

making loud grunts as she stabs.

She pulls a LARGE, THREE-SIDED CANDY WITH A HOLE IT from

the rubble and passes it to Coraline.

Coraline studies the odd candy.

She holds it up, looks through its hole at the ladies.

They don't look any different.

Coraline can't take anymore. She gets up, takes the odd

piece of candy and leaves.

INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Coraline, dressed for bed with her blanket over her

shoulder, walks into her parent's room, the PHOTO of her

and her parents at the Bear Fountain in the foreground.

She pulls down the bed covers and builds COPIES of her

parents out of pillows. She fits an extra neck brace on

one pillow head and some reading glasses on the other.

Then Coraline lies down and pulls up the covers, very

sad.

She kisses them both and BEGINS TO CRY. CAM PUSHES IN.

INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER

Coraline, asleep. SOMETHING blurs past camera. One paw

and then two paws bat her nose. She opens her eyes to

find OPAL BLUE EYES staring at her. It's the BLACK CAT,

purring loudly.

The cat yawns, his eyes flash.

The cat blinks. Then he heads out the door.

INT. LOWER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

She follows him, wrapped in her blanket, to the MIRROR at

the end of the hallway. The mirror starts to GLOW and

then an IMAGE FORMS within the glass. It's HER PARENTS!

They cling together, blue with cold, as snow falls.

They look up and, with a desperate look, Mel BREATHES on

the inside mirror-glass to fog it. She writes H E L P U

S.  her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a SMALL,

SAD BIRD. Frost RISES UP, hiding the letters and then her

parents. The image fades.

Coraline STRIKES AT THE MIRROR as hard as she can. GLASS

SHATTERS and she drops to the ground, shaking. The cat

nuzzles her..

INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - SAME

From under the bed, the cat drags out the BUTTON-EYED

DOLL, REMADE into HER MOTHER on one side, and HER FATHER

on the other!

Coraline, enraged, THROWS the doll. FIRE LIGHT comes up

on her face as the background DISSOLVES TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM, FRONT OF FIREPLACE - SAME

CLOSE ON DOLL: BURNING in the FIREPLACE.

Coraline and cat watch until the fire burns out. She

takes a breath and looks up at the mantel.

ANGLE ON snowglobe, the one of the FOUNTAIN BEARS from

the Detroit Zoo. Coraline cradles it, remembering.

The cat blinks. She looks over at the locked little door

in the corner wall.

INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM   - CONTINUOUS

Series of quick shots of Coraline getting ready to go.

Pulls her collecting bag from the closet, her puffy vest,

her boots; grabs a candle and garden shears, puts them in

the bag. She stands to go, taking her cap off the chair.

The ODD PIECE OF CANDY, the triangle green one with the

hole, drops to the floor. She hesitates a moment, then

sticks it in her bag.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

We hear the click of the door being unlocked. It opens to

reveal the cat, and - holding a lit candle - Coraline.

She leaves the key in the lock, like always, takes a

breath and crawls forward.

The candle casts huge, flickering shadows along the wall.

The cat, his voice returned, SPEAKS to her.

With great feeling, she explains:

Coraline thinks about it, remembering.

The door at the end of the tunnel clicks open, the candle

BLOWS OUT and the cat VANISHES IN THE DARK. Coraline

tenses when a voice calls out.

There, framed in the open door, back-lit in blue,

Coraline's REAL MOTHER, with neck brace and dressed in

her shopping clothes, calls.

She runs forward eagerly and--

INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

--out the Other Little Door, throwing her arms out to hug

her real Mom.

Coraline sees her mother's hand GROW as it wraps around

her. Alarmed, she PUSHES AWAY and sees the DECOY MOM grow

into the TALL OTHER MOTHER.

The room LIGHTS UP with the glowing bug furniture and a

fireplace fire.

Coraline tries her best to be brave.

The Tall Other Mother's button eyes GLITTER.

Her teeth gleam.

Other Father, a FOOT SHORTER than before, his sagging

face a pale PUMPKIN color, his hair VINES, comes up

behind Coraline.

Other Father, GURGLING happily, herds Coraline onto the

walking bug chair.

The Tall Other Mother, standing by the little door, turns

to it and CLAPS her hands.

A moment later, a HUGE RAT skitters out of the tunnel -

FILLED AGAIN with spider webs and children's things -

carrying the KEY from the real world door.

The Tall Other Mother takes the key, locks the door, and -

while the armoire bug assumes guard position - she

SWALLOWS THE KEY.

The Other Mother PULLS A VINE growing from his ear,

SHUTTING HIS MOUTH.

She turns him around, her hands under his arms and drags

him out.

After a beat, Coraline hears the very faint SOUND OF A

FINGER ON GLASS, just like when her mother wrote HELP on

the mirror. Coraline jumps to her feet, looking around

the room for a sign of her real parents.

A muffled screen door slams O.S. and the Tall Other

Mother calls to her from the kitchen.

Coraline leaves frame.

INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT

Coraline pauses in the doorway.

She sits at the kitchen table in her regular place, her

back to the sink.

Tall Other Mother, humming happily, prepares a mushroom

omelet and bacon. Fragrant cinnamon buns bake in the

oven.

At the table's center, Coraline sees the box with her

BUTTON EYES with needle and thread. A bead of sweat rolls

down her forehead. As casually as she can, she asks:

The Tall Other Mother's button eyes FLASH.

Bacon sizzles and spits on the stove.

Other Mother tries to act disinterested, but her fingers

drum with excitement.

Coraline hesitates.

She folds the omelet over in the pan.

Tall Other Mother smiles: now it's getting interesting.

The meal ready, she turns from the stove and takes the

food to Coraline.

The Tall Other Mother smiles a malicious not in a million

years smile.

She holds out her hand. Coraline doesn't reach.

Tall Other Mother snorts, her smile sours. She slowly

circles Coraline, and speaks as if talking to a very

stupid child.

Tall Other Mother - standing behind her in front of the

sink - smiles wickedly and just starts TAPPING HER BUTTON

EYE with her finger nail. Coraline turns away from her.

Extending her hand, Coraline starts to turn back.

But the Tall Other Mother HAS DISAPPEARED and the tapping

now is the FAUCET DRIPPING in the sink.

Coraline EXHALES, walks to the sink, stares at the

dripping faucet.

Out the kitchen window, the FANTASTIC GARDEN LIGHTS UP,

answering her question. She FURROWS HER BROWS, thinks

this was too easy.

EXT. OTHER GARDEN - SAME

Coraline walks through the gates. The bright magic of the

garden is DARKER NOW, with areas of black against areas

of glowing flowers.

She passes the PITCHER PLANTS, and the one with the frog

suddenly SWALLOWS the animal.

She goes up the steps past the BLEEDING HEARTS, which now

LEAK STICKY RED JUICE that runs down the wall.

At the top, a few SNAPDRAGONS, feeble now, SNAP at her.

She KICKS them down. Behind her, a brick tree ring OPENS

like a monster's MOUTH and five HUGE, PALE SNAPDRAGONS

sneak towards her. They ATTACK, knock her to the ground,

spilling her bag.

They GRAB CORALINE at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and

shoulder, and start to ROLL HER UP TOWARDS THE STONE

MOUTH.

Coraline is just able to GRAB her GARDEN SHEARS. She CUTS

OFF one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she

is free. The HEADLESS STEMS retreat into the rock mouth.

Coraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when

a trio of HUMMINGBIRDS/WASP HYBRIDS SWOOP IN. They don't

attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the

TRIANGLE CANDY WITH THE HOLE and LIFT OFF.

Coraline chases them, but they're getting away. As she

crosses the little bridge, she takes off her cap and

FLINGS IT LIKE A FRISBEE at them. SCORE! They fall to the

ground, near the eyebrow shrubs, sawdust spilling out.

She picks up the triangle candy.

With a look of what does she have to lose, she holds it

up to her eye and GASPS.

EVERYTHING IS BLURRY GREY like a pencil drawing, all

color gone. She scans the garden, turning slowly. As she

turns back to where she started, she sees something,

right in front of her: a BURNING RED EMBER -- A GHOST'S

EYE!

She lowers the stone from her eye, to see that the

ghost's eye is the FADED STICK SHIFT KNOB from the

preying mantis tractor, which STANDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF

HER with the Other Father, a SQUAT PUMPKIN MAN, at its

controls, his own hands IMPRISONED IN THE MECHANICAL

PIANO HANDS.

HEADLIGHTS GLARE and the tractor ROARS TO LIFE. The

mechanical hands FORCE Other Father to SHIFT GEARS, and

the tractor LURCHES at Coraline, its arms SLASHING. She

yells, backs away. Other Father calls in a garbled voice:

Coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the

fountains as the tractor moves in.

The Other Father tries to steer the tractor away, but the

mechanical hands are stronger. It moves onto the bridge -

STUPIDLY SMASHING THROUGH THE PLANKS in front of it.

Halfway over, it lurches, then STARTS TO FALL THROUGH THE

HOLE IT HAS CREATED. The tractor hangs precariously for a

moment.

Other Father KICKS away one mechanical hand, and with ONE

HAND FREE, manages to PULL OFF THE SHIFT KNOB.

Coraline DIVES FORWARD and just GETS THE KNOB before the

tractor and Other Father fall away and SINK UNDER THE

WATER.

Rippling out from Coraline like a gray wave, the entire

GARDEN BECOMES ASHEN AND DEAD.

Coraline CATCHES HER BREATH, shaken. The ghost eye/gear

knob GLOWS RED, no magic candy necessary.

Coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other

House. A LUNAR ECLIPSE has begun, the full moon a pale

acid green.

Coraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she

heads towards the house. A haunting version of Spink and

Forcible's show song starts to play...

EXT. OTHER HOUSE, STAIRWAY TO SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S - SAME

CORALINE'S POV DOWN STAIRWAY: chaser lights circle the

door at half-speed. Haunting show song continues.

REVERSE ON Coraline. She carefully descends towards CAM.

INT DOWNSTAIRS THEATRE - SAME

WE SEE her flickering shadow and then Coraline appears

behind the entry curtains. She steps close, pulls the

curtain open. Song stops.

POV ON THEATER, quiet and dark save for light coming

through entry curtains. She spots usher's FLASHLIGHT on

the ground.

ON CORALINE - she picks it up, clicks it on, and STEPS

FORWARD. She sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive,

then HEARS SOMETHING overhead. She aims flashlight up and

startles a NEST OF BAT-DOGS - half Scotties/half bats.

One bares his teeth and GROWLS. She clicks off the light

and shivers.

On stage, one spotlight and footlights FADE UP on a huge,

wrapped SALTWATER TAFFY. It hangs from ropes and

sandbags.

She cautiously climbs up onto the stage. A HUMAN-SIZED

TAFFY THING - striped pale pink and green - can just be

seen through the wrapper. She holds her TRIANGLE CANDY-

WITH-HOLE to her eye. There is a BLUE-WHITE GLOW coming

from inside the wrapper.

Coraline PUNCHES A HOLE through the paper, steels

herself, then reaches inside. She touches something

sticky and cold and inhuman. Clenching her teeth, she

grabs hold and pulls out two clasped-together COLD, TAFFY

HANDS - Young Spink and Forcible's.

Her heart thumps. She PRIES the TAFFY HANDS open like

scallop shells until a large PEARL-on-a-ring is revealed.

The hands suddenly GRAB HER! She SCREAMS. Young Spink and

Forcible, twisted together into one taffy monster, THRUST

THEIR HEADS FROM THE BAG!

Coraline PULLS AWAY, STRETCHING the candy arm out across

the stage! The taffy monster THRUSTS OUT another paired

arm, and starts DRAGGING ITSELF TOWARDS CORALINE, ropes

swaying on pulleys.

Coraline, desperate, gets an idea. She clicks on her

flashlight and aims it at the BAT-DOGS. They GROWL with

annoyance, OPEN their wings.

The taffy monster is GETTING CLOSER! Coraline hurls the

flashlight at the bat-dogs and HITS THEM. Angered, they

TAKE WING TO ATTACK HER - just like she planned!

Bat-dogs are closing on the left, the taffy monster on

the right! She waits to the very last second, and then

DIVES OUT OF THE WAY!

BAT-DOGS AND TAFFY MONSTER COLLIDE! Coraline's hand is

released by the taffy hands, leaving her the PEARL. The

bat-dogs and taffy monster - stuck together and still-as-

stone - turn to dead, grey ash, as does the stage and

theater.

The PEARL in Coraline's hand PULSES BLUE.

Coraline nods, sticks the pearl in her bag, and looks up

towards the ceiling and beyond.

EXT. OTHER HOUSE/OTHER BOBINSKY'S BALCONY - SAME

CORALINE'S MOVING POV, on lower ext stairs to UP ANGLE ON

BALCONY. We hear haunting circus music in the air.

Other Mr. B's Russian flag, TORN in places, waves in the

air. The pale green moon is nearly HALF-ECLIPSED now with

what is clearly the SHADOW OF A HUGE, DARK, BUTTON.

ANGLE ON CORALINE as she climbs the last flight of stairs

to Bobinsky's. She stops with a SHUDDER at the top. The

flag has been replaced with the EMPTY COAT OF OTHER WYBIE-

gloves, pants and sneakers pinned on - hanging like old

laundry.

She takes a breath, leans out over the railing and

shouts.

The door behind her CREAKS open. Coraline shivers - she

is definitely scared.

INT. OTHER MR. B'S ATTIC FLAT - CONTINUOUS

Coraline steps into the apartment and carefully shuts the

door. The cannons and Ferris wheel are dark and quiet;

the circus tent glows dimly. Pale green moonlight shines

in patches through holes in the roof. The corners and

edges of the room are very dark.

OTHER BOBINSKY suddenly CRAWLS by the door behind her.

Coraline whips around, on guard. He LOOMS UP past the

cannons on her right, leaning towards her.

There are too many joints in his arms and legs.

His tall, crooked hat is pulled so low, and his collar so

high, that his face is completely hidden.

He throws out his arm towards her and the CIRCUS BALL

from the mouse circus rolls from his sleeve to his hand.

She looks through the hole of the triangle candy and sees

an AMBER GLOW  the THIRD GHOST'S EYE!

She grabs for it, but he's too quick. He back-bends to

all fours and SCUTTLES around her towards the back

shadows.

Coraline holds up the triangle candy, scans the room for

him. His voice sounds distorted now.

WE SEE him twine up a post behind Coraline, crawl out on

a beam...

He SWINGS UPSIDE-DOWN from his ankles, his head stopping

right by Coraline's. She whips around, alarmed.

He DROPS to the floor on his head, then SLITHERS into the

circus tent. Coraline does not want to follow him. But

she does.

INT. CIRCUS TENT - CONTINUOUS

The Other Mr. B is perched on a pile of MOLDY CHEESES in

the center of the ring. He moves like all his bones are

broken.

Coraline raises the triangle candy to her eye, sees the

AMBER GLOW coming from inside his hat.

She moves closer.

Small forms MOVE under the back of his coat.

Coraline pulls off his hat. Instead of his head, a HUGE

PALE RAT SITS THERE - holding the circus ball. It barks

at her then DIVES DOWN the coat collar.

RATS leap from COAT SLEEVES and PANT LEGS, Coraline pulls

back, HORRIFIED, as the clothes collapse, scanning around

for the circus ball.

There's a rat bark behind her and she turns. The HUGE RAT

- balanced on a wheel of cheese, circus ball in paws -

TAUNTS HER, then RUNS THE CHEESE OUT THE DOOR! She GIVES

CHASE.

INT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS

The OTHER RATS RACE behind the twin rows of cannons - the

cheese wheel rat rolls through them, heading towards the

door!

Coraline CHARGES. The cannons, manned by rats, FIRE

COTTON CANDY at her. She's HIT in the side, her leg, her

ribs; she weaves and STUMBLES, the shots landing like

punches.

A PET DOOR - perfectly shaped for the rat on the wheel -

appears in the front door as the rat approaches.

Coraline looks up to see the PET DOOR OPEN and the CHEESE-

WHEEL RAT HEADING THROUGH IT TO THE OUTSIDE.

Coraline takes her triangle candy stone and THROWS IT as

hard as she can AT THE RAT.

The whistling candy FLIES through the pet door towards

the RAT, just outside.

EXT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS

The RAT DUCKS, the CANDY MISSES, and the cheese-wheel rat

ESCAPES down the stairs with the ball.

INT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS

Coraline, lurching forward, HOLLERS.

Two waiting rats - tail tips tied - pull tails tight, and

TRIP her. She CRASHES THROUGH THE DOOR AND--.

EXT. OTHER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

--OUT onto the balcony which TEARS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE

with ATTACHED STAIRWAY.

The whole rig, with Coraline on top, ROTATES as it

collapses, THROWING CORALINE toward the front of the

house when it HITS THE GROUND. She BLACKS OUT a moment.

WHEEZING for breath, Coraline pushes up on hands and

knees and SCANS past the topiaries and poplars and white

gravel driveway, looking for the cheese-wheel rat and

circus ball. No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost

eye.

Coraline, lit by a NARROWING BAND of pale green light,

turns to look at the moon. It's nearly covered now by the

DARK BUTTON SHADOW.

Her HAND stings from a scrape. BLOOD trickles from her

knee. She feels nothing but COLD LOSS.

She sobs, hugs knees and face to chest. The band of light

that illuminates her is narrowing to near-gone.

In the foreground, the HEAD of the cheese-wheel rat -

CIRCUS BALL IN ITS TEETH - DROPS ON THE GROUND. Sawdust

leaks from its neck. Band of light STOPS NARROWING, the

eclipse paused.

There's a familiar MEROWWW and Coraline looks up.

Across from her on the front yard, sits the BLACK CAT,

licking his paws, rat's head and circus ball at his feet.

Coraline smiles, walks towards him.

He bats the circus ball and it rolls to Coraline.

She picks it up , sticks it in her bag. Around her, the

YARD, HOUSE, TREES, SHRUBS AND DRIVEWAY TURN ASHEN GRAY.

Looks towards house.

ANGLE ON MOON. The stalled eclipse STARTS AGAIN, and in

one beat, the last sliver of green moon is FULLY BLACKED

OUT. The EDGES of the button shadow start to FLAKE AWAY.

ON CORALINE WITH CAT. A strange insect thrumming has

begun. What appear to be grey paint chips or bits of

paper are falling. Confused, she looks up to see:.

The huge button shadow is EATEN TO NOTHING and then the

SKY around it IS EATEN AS WELL, revealing dirty white

light. The destruction TRAVELS from sky to the distant

hills, the sound of a million, invisible locusts growing

louder.

UP ANGLE ON CAT AND CORALINE. The cat hisses. Deeply

alarmed, they look from one direction to another.

POV out front yard. The destruction TRAVELS up the

driveway, PULLS APART the poplars, and then UNRAVELS the

topiary elephant and bird.

DOWN ANGLE ON Coraline and cat, his TAIL TWITCHING. WE

PULL BACK to find they are at the center of a RAPIDLY

SHRINKING ISLAND!

NEW ANGLE on Coraline and cat as ground beneath their

feet STARTS CRACKING, white light coming through. Cat

makes a fearful sound, afraid for the first time in the

movie!

Coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal, her

guardian angel.

The cat LEAPS and she catches him, then CARRIES HIM up

the DISINTEGRATING porch steps to the front door. She

gets through just in time, and SLAMS it shut!

INT. OTHER HOUSE HALLWAY - SAME

It's dark and stable in here, with just some creaks and

intermittent vibrations. A poisonous green light spills

from the other living room.

Coraline goes there, carrying the cat over her shoulder,

past wallpaper that PEELS UP as she passes, to the room

where she last heard the sound of her mother's finger on

glass.

INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - SAME

A poisonous GREEN FIRE - LIKE SLEEPY SEA SNAKES - BURNS

in the fireplace. The bug furniture looks grey now, their

lights flickering as if short-circuited; legs and wings

twitching uncontrollably.

Coraline scans the walls, the ceiling, looking for a sign

of her parents.

ANGLE ON CORALINE in foreground. She senses the Other

Mother behind her, a creature who is no sort of Mother at

all but a witch, a Beldam. She turns.

The Beldam is hunched on the sofa - her face hidden.

Her voice sounds dry and tired. She turns her face

towards Coraline. It is a WHITE DEATH MASK, cracked and

peeling - her true face.

Coraline shudders and steps back. The cat makes a fearful

sound and digs his claws into her shoulder.

The Beldam rises up 12 FEET TALL. She is WITHERED to the

bone; with plate-like shoulders and hips; her bustle now

an arachnid's tail section. Her true form.

She reaches her long, sharp FINGERS MADE OF NEEDLES to

Coraline's face.

Coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is.

The Beldam smiles, turns away, then back, her hand

outstretched.

Coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and

starts to hand them over. But she catches herself.

And pulls back.

The Beldam looks daggers, then smiles sweetly.

She produces the TRIANGLE CANDY that Coraline lost and

FLINGS it into the green fire. The Beldam laughs while

the MAGIC BURNS out of the candy with sparks and pops.

ON CORALINE. The third ghost eye PULSES WITH AMBER LIGHT

in her hand. Coraline turns away, so the witch won't see.

Coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the

armoire bug and understands: she's got to get the Beldam

to unlock it! She furrows her brow as an idea comes to

her then nods.

She turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she

can muster, says:

The Beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and

sceptical.

Coraline points to the little door.

The Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and

speaks very quietly.

A smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS

TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way,

as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the

armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline.

Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on

wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming

from?!

The cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES

SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline --

-- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE -

OPAQUE WITH FROST.

C.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass

is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see

the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED

PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back

from them.

ON BELDAM, by little door. Oblivious to Coraline's

discovery, she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand. She turns

to Coraline, expectantly.

The Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns

it, leaves the key in place.

She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song

voice.

She opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider-

web tunnel.

ON CORALINE, who glances from the open door to the cat -

obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam. She's

thinking very hard.

She opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's BLACK

BUTTON EYES, the other a THREADED NEEDLE. Triumphant, the

Beldam softly gloats:

Coraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the

fury she can.

She GRABS THE CAT off the mantel and RAISES HIM OVER HER

HEAD.

And she HURLS THE CAT at the Beldam. The YOWLING ANIMAL -

face shocked with surprise - SAILS through the air and

lands RIGHT ON THE ASTONISHED WITCH'S HEAD.

FREAKED-OUT, the cat DIGS in his CLAWS AND BITES the

shrieking Beldam, who STAGGERS to one side of the little

door.

Coraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside,

stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door

from the other side.

The Beldam FLAILS WILDLY at the cat. The cat HOWLS LIKE A

BANSHEE, RAISES HIS CLAWS, and - quick as you can - TWO

SHINY BLACK BUTTONS HIT THE FLOOR - THE BELDAM'S EYES!

ANGLE ON CAT as he's thrown on armoire bug.

ON BELDAM, hands covering her face.

Her hands pull away to show EMPTY, FLAT SOCKETS and TORN

THREAD!

She furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral

of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center.

A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR!

The web trap STRETCHES DOWN into a FIFTY FOOT DEEP PIT.

There is nothing beyond but PALE NOTHINGNESS.

The cat scrambles along the tops of falling furniture

straight to the little door and disappears into the

tunnel.

Coraline falls the very bottom of the web.

Fifty feet above, the Beldam LAUGHS MANIACALLY and LEAPS

DOWN like a huge, flying spider!

Coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the

trap JUST AS THE BELDAM LANDS.

The witch - furious her prey has escaped - spins around,

grasping blindly.

Coraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the LITTLE

DOOR, still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room.

She goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag GETS

CAUGHT on a barb. She pulls and pulls until it breaks

free, sending a STRONG VIBRATION DOWN THE SPIRALING WEB

TO THE VERY SENSITIVE HAND OF THE BELDAM.

The Beldam smiles - she knows where her prey is now!

Coraline makes it to the little door, but the BELDAM IS

COMING UP BEHIND HER VERY FAST!

INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Coraline SCRAMBLES through the door, KEY IN HAND, and

grabs the door's handle. Before she can shut it, the

BELDAM'S HEAD THRUSTS INSIDE.

Coraline KICKS HER IN THE FACE, knocking her back. The

cat takes off down the tunnel.

Coraline nearly shuts the door, when NEEDLE FINGERS GRAB

HOLD THROUGH THE CRACK. The door STARTS TO PULL OPEN!

The ghost children's FLUTTERY, DISMEMBERED HANDS FLY OUT

FROM HER BAG and GRAB HOLD OF CORALINE'S HANDS that grip

the door's handle. And her STRENGTH IS QUADRUPLED.

The door STARTS TO SHUT. The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY

at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one

thin claw. There's a final moment of resistance - the

Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then

SNAP! The DOOR SHUTS, and the Beldam's hand drops to the

ground!

She SCREECHES like a metal rake on pavement!

Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when

it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming

through cracks! She takes off down the tunnel, stooped

down, as fast as she can.

The pounding grows more insistent, green light flashing.

And then the tunnel behind coraline STARTS TO GROW

SHORTER, like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far

door with the blind, one-handed Beldam on the other side

STARTS TO CATCH UP TO HER!

Ahead, DAYLIGHT APPEARS, and then the LITTLE DOOR TO THE

REAL WORLD!

INT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Coraline FLINGS HERSELF through the doorway, SHUTS AND

LOCKS THE DOOR and BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT. A split-

second later, the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A

CRASH! Coraline is THROWN BACK. But the real-world door

and lock, hold. It's over...

Coraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's

ever been, GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows

a little. The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first

since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue

with white clouds.

She smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the

ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside.

She opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes

and garden shears. But the snow globe is GONE!

She gets on all fours, starts searching the floor. Her

hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace, with tiny

bits of BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, then another. She

looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE.

She stands up and finds that it's BROKEN OPEN, and

neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside.

As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe,

Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does

this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY

REAL MOTHER calls to her.

Her TRUE PARENTS enter the room from the hallway, a

dusting of snow on their shoulders and hair.

Coraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around

them.

C.U. ON CORALINE. Huh?

Mel notices the broken snow globe.

Mom spots her bloody knee.

Charlie crouches low, clutching his briefcase.

Mel tells her.

Coraline, confused, takes a stab.

Her parents turn to leave the room.

But the snow melts without a trace.

Her parents walk off. Coraline shrugs her shoulders and

looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel. She

cocks her head, deeply puzzled, then leaves the room.

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT, SKY CLEAR

The VW is parked out front, its interior light fading as

light in Coraline's bedroom window switches on. We HEAR

Charlie make a strangled sound.

INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT FULL MOON RISING

Coraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and PATCHED,

wounds-dressed, hair shining. The KEY hangs from a string

around her neck. A gibbous moon shines in the clear night

sky.

Charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like it's

an alien face-hugger then, FEIGNING DEATH, falls on the

bed. Coraline LAUGHS.

He opens one eye, pretends he's never heard about this.

He sits up and kids her, tickling her face with the

squid.

She turns to Mom, arranging things on a shelf.

Her mother nods, points up.

Charlie LAUGHS. He bends down to kiss her.

As he steps away, Mel slips a slim box under the covers

next to her daughter. She gives Coraline a "told you so"

look, and she and Charlie leave the room.

Coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box - it's the

GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES she'd wanted! She pulls one on to

admire when the BLACK CAT appears outside her window

She walks over to the window, opens it.

His expression says yes, he's still mad.

The cat's angry expression softens. He rests his head on

her hand, licking her fingers and purrs.

Coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and

carries him over to her bed.

She grabs her collecting bag and takes out the large

PEARL, the CIRCUS BALL, and the GREY STICKSHIFT KNOB. She

holds them out to the cat.

The cat nods. She puts the ghost eyes under her pillow

and gently lays down, the cat lying beside her. The two

of them close their eyes, and in no time at all, they

doze off to sleep. WE SLOWLY TILT UP.

EXT. DREAMSCAPE - MAGIC TIME

A MAGIC ART SKY animates subtly.

CAM TILT DOWN ON Coraline, studying sky, her back to us.

From behind CAM, CHIMES sound and GOLD LIGHT begins to

shine on her. She turns toward us, shielding her eyes.

Coraline's eyes adjust to the brightness to see the THREE

GHOST CHILDREN, now transformed into GOLDEN ANGELS; EYES

RESTORED, small fluttering WINGS ON THEIR BACKS.

A SHADOW crosses the faces of the three children. They

gather around Coraline and bow their heads.

Silent beat.

The tall girl ghost shifts uncomfortably, then BLURTS

OUT:

Coraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation.

The KEY ON THE STRING around Coraline's neck floats out

in front of Coraline. She grabs it.

The three ghost children all embrace Coraline tenderly.

They begin to swirl around her, spinning faster and

faster. Coraline starts to turn and then she --

INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- ROLLS HERSELF AWAKE IN HER OWN BED. FAST PULL BACK

above her to find covers thrown off and the CAT awake by

her side.

Coraline lifts up her pillow and GASPS - the GHOST EYES

ARE IN PIECES like hatched bird eggs. She takes out the

key on its string and explains to the cat, her voice

PANICKED:

The cat doesn't like the sound of this. Coraline grabs

her blanket and heads to her door. But the cat leaps down

and blocks her way.

She sidesteps the cat and leaves her room. The cat glares

after her

INT. HOUSE STAIRWAY, LOWER HALL, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Coraline trots down the stairs and purposefully heads

down the hall. She passes the LIVING ROOM and exits

frame. CAMERA stays on living room, where, on the LITTLE

DOOR in the corner wall, SHADOWS and LIGHT start to MOVE.

WE ROCKET IN AND--

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The baseboard is PUSHED ASIDE. Through the narrow gap at

the door's bottom, the DISMEMBERED HAND OF THE BELDAM

CRAWLS OUT. It scrambles out of frame in the direction of

Coraline!

EXT ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - SAME

Coraline moves briskly, the house below, GRIPPING THE KEY

that's tied round her neck. DARK, ROPEY CLOUDS reach like

fingers across the gibbous moon. Coraline sings her

father's nonsense song, her voice hardly trembling.

EXT. ORCHARD - SAME

She moves down past the old fruit trees, now covered with

BRIGHT SPRING BLOSSOMS that fall gently like snow.

LOW ANGLE ON Coraline, moving away. The BELDAM'S HAND

drops into frame and CREEP-CRAWLS after her.

EXT. WELL - SAME

Coraline jams the SAME DEAD BRANCH Wybie used under the

well's cover, lining it up over the SAME FULCRUM ROCK.

Circling around behind the BIG STUMP, the HAND SCAMPERS

behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer.

Coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one

side, leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN. Huffing and sweating,

she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's

around her neck.

The hand, SEEING what is about to happen, RACES TOWARDS

HER!

Coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head.

The hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the

air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND!

Coraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM, her fingers caught

between the key string and her neck!

The HAND wants to DRAG HER BACK TO THE HOUSE and the

LITTLE LOCKED DOOR THAT IS BREATHING WITH ANTICIPATION!

A BLINDING HEADLIGHT hits HAND and CORALINE; an AIR HORN

SOUNDS; and WYBIE LOVAT - hollering a BATTLE CRY all his

own - comes SPEEDING DOWN THE BLUFF on his whining

electric bike!

Wybie GUNS the throttle, and, leaning out, GRABS the

confused HAND with his slug tongs!

He CIRCLES AROUND and HEADS TOWARDS THE WELL, readying to

throw the hand in. But the HAND GETS FREE, and GRABS his

handlebars.

OUT OF CONTROL, Wybie's bike HITS A ROCK, and WYBIE AND

HAND ARE THROWN RIGHT DOWN THE WELL. HOLLERING, he just

manages to hang on with one hand! The Beldam's hand,

caught on Wybie's coattail, SCRAMBLES UP his body and

face and onto the well's edge where it STABS AT HIS

FINGERS to make him fall!

Coraline, choking, rises to her feet. She grabs her

BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the

crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND.

It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it.

The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF. It

crouches to attack her!

And then WYBIE IS BACK, pumped with adrenaline, a BIG

ROCK raised over his head! He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE

LEAPING HAND! And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES.

Wybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing

hard - removes the key and string from around her sore

neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the

needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together

with the string. The key is left attached.

The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and

DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam,

they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in

the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover

in place.

Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his

injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw. He

looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little

with moonlight.

Coraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath,

stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the

first time.

He walks over, and takes out an old B&W photo from his

jacket.

He hands it to her.

ANGLE ON PHOTO: two light-skinned black girls - dressed

in old-fashioned clothing - stand in front of the Pink

Palace, before it was divided into apartments. One looks

just like the sweet ghost girl, and holds the DOLL WITH

BUTTON EYES, which looks just like her.

ANGLE ON WYBIE AND CORALINE. Behind them, blossoms fall

like snow in the orchard.

Wybie's grandmother, loud and worried, calls from the

distance.

She looks up from the photo and smiles.

She gives Wybie a playful punch on the arm and LAUGHS.

The BLACK CAT jumps up on the TREE STUMP and MEROWWS.

Coraline smiles.

We TILT UP to the sky and see the last ropey clouds -

like two clawed hands - clear away from the bright

gibbous moon.

EXT HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY

One WHITE BALLOON floats against a blue sky with puffy,

white clouds. WE TILT DOWN past more balloons to a TABLE

OF REFRESHMENTS, set up by the front gates.

Coraline picks up a TRAY OF DRINKS and heads out to her

hard-working GUESTS, all wearing garden gloves and

showing signs of having helped plant about TWO HUNDRED

RED TULIPS.

SPINK AND FORCIBLE, along with their DOGS, are set up at

a table below the steps. Empty plant cartons are stacked

nearby along with some garden tools and empty bags of

peat moss.

Coraline hands them the beverages, then nods towards the

GREY DOG digging in the flowers.

Miss Spink sighs.

Coraline heads up the steps to find her PARENTS dumping a

heavy bag of PEAT MOSS around the dead-looking tree in

the stone circle.

Charlie BURPS.

Mel SIGHS.

Charlie nods, grabs them for Mel and Wybie.

Coraline, delighted, moves on.

Coraline comes upon Bobinsky in the bottom of the drained

fish pond. He's stealthily PULLING just-planted tulips

from the dirt there, and putting BEETS in their place.

Coraline CLEARS HER THROAT to get his attention.

Surprised and looking very guilty, he tries to cover up

his activities. She smiles and hands him a drink.

He drains his glass of lemonade. A familiar voice is

heard approaching. Coraline turns and smiles.

ANGLE ON Wybie and his GRANDMOTHER as they walk through

the garden gates

Coraline sees them and waves.

The old lady looks up and smiles.

CAMERA PULLS UP from the GARDEN, FLIES OVER THE HOUSE and

BOOMS DOWN to the PINK PALACE APARTMENTS SIGN out front.

On top of the sign sits the black cat, who looks right

into camera, blinks, then walks behind the thin post that

holds the sign and DISAPPEARS.
