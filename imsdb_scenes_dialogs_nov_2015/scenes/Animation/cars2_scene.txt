A sleek British sports car talks directly to us in a

pixilated, garbled video. He's OUT OF BREATH. Crates are

visible behind him. We're in the shadowy bowels of a steel

room.

SUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK: WALT DISNEY PICTURES PRESENTS

SUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM

He angles our camera view, reveals a PORTHOLE through which

we can see flames rising in the distance.

ANGRY VOICES O.S. Time for Turbo to go.

Coordinates appear: 40 6.80' N - 172 23.84' W

TITLE CARD: CARS 2

EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTH PACIFIC - NIGHT

A TINY CRAB BOAT (CRABBY) crests over massive swells.

A metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the

shadows. Cagey, smooth, he'd turn heads driving through any

intersection in the world. Meet FINN MCMISSILE.

Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise

ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight.

A laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes.

ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone.

FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine.

We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the

darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps

a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn,

the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK.

THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS

toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force

--- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. He STICKS to the

derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP...

From this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear.

EXT. PLATFORM - OIL DERRICK - MOMENTS LATER

Finn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. He watches

as GREMLINS, PACERS and assorted other cars scurry about.

No response.

AN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing

German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP.

Zundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE.

A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed

carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.

Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES ---

--- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick ---

--- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder.

Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels

another cross-wire for support.

Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures.

Zundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and

ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it.

Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies

himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland.

The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo.

Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick

flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the

Professor. He looks up.

Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He

BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just

came from - BLOWTORCHES ready.

Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS,

having just found his escape.

THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables,

swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE

--- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT

where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck!

Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners.

A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control ---

--- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig!

The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity...

He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces.

ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has

nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He

spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts

through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp,

PAST FINN ---

--- PAST the pursuing CARS ---

--- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back

UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!

ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No

more road. Nowhere else to go.

The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him,

fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce.

Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means

he's got something cooking.

Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge

of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars.

Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly

cutting into the water.

He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.

THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea

and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make

up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they

do so.

The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water.

It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and

EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the

night clouds.

UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS.

We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now

CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four

DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.

ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far

away.

EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY

TOW MATER, a rusty tow truck, putters into view.

He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He

drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first

time.

Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.

Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN.

It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen."

Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.

Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.

Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.

EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY

Lightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends.

They all turn around, see Mater speeding into town, with Otis

swerving behind him.

Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion,

slingshots Otis forward ---

--- right through Ramone's front door ---

INT. RAMONE'S - CONTINUOUS

--- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. Ramone

lifts him up, routine.

EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - CONTINUOUS

Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump

style).

Everyone watches as the tire bump continues.

INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY

CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned

with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston

Cup."

McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public.

McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three

Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.

McQueen takes this in.

EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER

McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum.

EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY

Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires

off. They're on their rims.

As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL ---

From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN. The two friends

emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill,

with no tires.

Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized

horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.

EXT. FIELD - OUTSIDE RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER

An ENORMOUS EARTH MOVER sleeps. McQueen and Mater sneak up.

They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping

style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth

mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them.

The exhaust pipe BELCHES. McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out

of view.

INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DUSK

The sun sets. McQueen and Mater roll into town. McQueen looks

exhausted. Mater is still full of energy.

Mater proudly shows off a dent.

McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.

McQueen drives off. Mater watches him go.

EXT. THE WHEEL WELL - NIGHT

It's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant, with

cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside.

MCQUEEN AND SALLY have a prime table with a view of Radiator

Springs and the starry night sky.

Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter.

McQueen and Sally exchange a look.

Mater blinks.

INSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes

drinks, ala "Cocktail." Mater arrives.

ON THE BAR TV - "THE MEL DORADO SHOW," a cable talk show,

begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD, a sleek SUV.

We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.

Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting

converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.

Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all

combining to form the Allinol logo.

SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk.

Across the screen: LIVE FROM ROME, ITALY. We meet Formula

race car FRANCESCO BERNOULLI.

Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued.

Mater doesn't like this.

Dial tone.

Fillmore and Sarge look around. Mater is visible in the back

of the bar on an office phone.

Audible RXNS from the bar. A crowd has been forming ever

since Mater started talking.

MCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside.

THE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that

they're watching Francesco on the television.

When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if

Italian were her mother's tongue.

On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to ---

--- Mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.

ON MCQUEEN. He doesn't like this at all.

Suddenly, Mater is YANKED from the booth and replaced by

McQueen.

Francesco goes ballistic in Italian. They cut his mic.

A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi

flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. Ramone backs

away, having spray painted "TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN" on it.

Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.

McQueen turns back to the phone.

The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS.

MOMENTS LATER - General excitement as McQueen exits the phone

booth where Sally waits. Off her look:

McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their

drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.

Mater arrives.

- McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone.

Mater, now sporting a "Team McQueen" emblem, seems psyched as

well.

- An airport DEPARTURES SIGN advertises the next flight:

Tokyo, Japan.

- Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen, Guido,

Luigi, Fillmore and Sarge as ---

--- the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane.

Red bawls.

- IN THE JET, LATER. McQueen and Mater are the only ones

awake, watch an insane Japanese game show.

- JAPAN AT NIGHT. A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour,

scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech

skyscrapers.

- INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and

McQueen enter. A tourist sees McQueen and faints.

- A KABUKI THEATER. Team McQueen watches a methodical dance.

Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives. He looks insane.

- A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a

parking space. Mater, now in his element, cheers.

The MONTAGE ENDS on this high note as we CUT TO ---

EXT. MUSEUM - TOKYO - NIGHT

---- TEAM MCQUEEN, as they roll up the red carpet. Press is

held at bay behind ropes. WORLD GRAND PRIX and ALLINOL logos

are strategically placed for maximum press exposure. RACERS

are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes.

INT. TOKYO MUSEUM - NIGHT

Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which

overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As

they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed.

He sees something, peels away.

It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen

now has no choice but to let Mater go.

MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a

pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with

his hook.

People turn at the noise he's making.

MCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS.

He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.

FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.

On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.

As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:

McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.

Mater ZIPS OFF.

McQueen starts to leave.

Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.

Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"

He rolls off.

INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER

Lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed.

MILES AXLEROD drives through an infinity fountain, appears.

ON FINN MCMISSILE. He appears from the shadows, keeps a

careful distance from the stage. He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON ---

--- THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll, catching

Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity.

Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the

photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT

A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL

SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.

He moves her onto an elevator. The doors close on them.

IN THE ELEVATOR, GOING UP.

The doors OPEN and they exit onto the Mezzanine.

Finn suddenly STOPS COLD.

Professor Zundapp is visible below them. He talks with a few

Pacers and Gremlins. Finn quickly retreats into the shadows.

Holley follows suit.

MATER as he grabs a drink, keeps moving.

He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large

assortment of drinks balanced.

He approaches a sushi bar.

He refers to wasabi, of course.

The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater.

The chef gives in. Scoops a baseball-sized ball out.

MILES AXLEROD - He's now nearly done with his intros.

MCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights.

As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain.

Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage,

making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.

He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat.

Miles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it.

Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic.

TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater.

McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles

Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.

Mater drives off.

ON MATER - MOMENTS LATER

He drives through the party, frantic.

Someone points Mater down a hallway. He whips around the

--- and STOPS. Finds himself in front of TWO BATHROOM DOORS,

neither of which clearly indicate MALE or FEMALE.

Mater chooses one, drives inside. A SHRIEK is heard and Mater

zips out.

He heads into the other door ---

INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Mater rolls in, still `holding it in' like a kid.

He sees someone leaving a stall. He heads in.

IN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up.

The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights.

High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as

if he's going to get an oil change.

A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR,

followed by images of waterfalls and rivers.

The caricature starts talking in Japanese. Suddenly WATER

FIRES UP underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him. He

freaks out.

OUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a

GREMLIN enter, furtive. Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame

BREAKS APART like an egg, revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR

underneath. The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him,

clearly his disguise. This is ROD REDLINE - American Agent.

INT. PARTY - SAME

HOLLEY, rolls along by herself. Nervous. DING! Her rearview

monitor springs to life.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME

Rod Redline, waiting at a sink, feels a presence behind him.

GREM and ACER have entered, hesitate briefly when they see

Rod Redline.

Rod Redline, careful, slides a gun out of his tire. He is

suddenly CHARGED by the AMCs --- Rod SPINS AROUND and gets a

shot off but is SLAMMED HEAD FIRST. A TIGHT, CLOSE-QUARTERS

FIGHT begins ---

IN THE STALL - Mater, still TRAPPED, is now being SCRUBBED as

if in a car wash. He is helpless.

OUTSIDE THE STALL - Rod is being pulverized. Just when he

scrambles away from one car, the other one takes over.

IN THE STALL - Mater is mercifully released, but when he

backs out ---

--- Rod Redline is THROWN INTO MATER'S STALL DOOR, crunching

it and sending Mater ---

--- BACK INTO THE CLUTCHES of the insane toilet.

INT. PARTY - SAME

Holley isolates the tracking beacon's location in the party.

INT. BATHROOM - OUTSIDE THE STALL

Rod Redline is in bad shape. He backs away, betrays a look of

concern. He's in trouble here.

ACER burns rubber, ready to finish him off. Just as he shifts

into DRIVE ---

--- MATER'S STALL DOOR KICKS OPEN, knocking ACER out. Mater

jumps out, face-to-face GREM.

The door SWINGS shut, revealing the pulverized Acer.

Rod Redline, now behind Mater and sensing an opportunity

here, quickly produces A SMALL DEVICE.

Rod Redline, surreptitiously attaches the device to Mater's

undercarriage.

He spins around, sees Rod Redline for the first time.

Mater turns back to Grem and Acer.

Mater exits, leaving Rod Redline to a now even angrier Grem

and Acer.

EXT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Holley arrives at the door. She takes a breath, is about to

enter when Mater EXITS.

He passes her, expelling some exhaust in the process.

Holley's rearview tracking confirms that the device is on

him.

It's settled. Holley takes one more nervous breath, quickly

closes the distance between her and Mater, cuts him off. He

is forced to STOP.

INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER

Mater returns to his team, lost in thought.

Guido makes a crack in Italian.

Mater points out Holley, who's within earshot.

Holley, caught in plain view, DRIVES OFF.

Guido makes another crack in Italian.

EXT. SHIPYARD - THE DOCKS - TOKYO NIGHT

An industrial dock, outside of the city proper.

INT. SHIPYARD - NIGHT

Rod Redline dangles from a car magnet. He's been beaten up,

clings to consciousness.

Grem, Acer, and a bunch of nasty looking troublemakers look

up at Rod amidst crates and shipping containers.

Rod Redline laughs to himself.

This doesn't help him. They DROP HIM onto a TREADMILL, lock

him down. A container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied

with Allinol brand gasoline.

The Professor emerges from the darkness, behind Rod.

Zundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod's wheels

spinning at a high rate of speed.

Grem pushes a World Grand Prix CAMERA - the same one that

was in the box back at the oil derrick. He points it at Rod

Redline.

Acer pushes a TV MONITOR toward Rod. On it, surveillance

footage from the party. Clearly, they were watching and

recording him there.

Rod Redline's engine starts to CRACK and BREAK.

The monitor reveals MATER, rolling out of the bathroom and

down the hall.

Rod Redline, seeing this, does the world's most subtle double

take. We caught it, but there's no way anyone else in the

room could have ---

As Grem turns up the machine even MORE, the Professor makes a

call.

The Professor hangs up, turns to the room.

Zundapp kicks the camera's power into the RED.

On the MONITOR - With Mater's frozen image on the screen we

see Rod EXPLODE in the reflection.

EXT. JAPAN - DAY

Over television pre-roll of Japan:

ON OUR ANNOUNCERS as they introduce themselves:

SHOTS OF THE PITS as the racers fuel up.

OUTLINES OF THREE RACE COURSES are shown. They're labeled

Japan, Italy and England, and are different in shape and

size.

SHOTS OF THE RACERS as they weave up the track, practicing.

SHOTS OF Francesco, featured in an inset.

MORE SHOTS of the course, now highlighting the tech turns.

GRAPHICS OF THE COURSES now isolate a stretch after the first

couple turns, label it "DIRT SECTIONS."

BACK IN THE STUDIO

EXT. STARTING LINE - DAY

Engines rev as everyone gets ready to go. Everyone's bright

eyed and alert except for McQueen who we find in the back of

the grid. He CLOSES his eyes.

A LAUGH O.S. McQueen opens his eyes. Francesco is next to him

on the grid.

The starting lights click down from RED to YELLOW to GREEN.

The race begins. Francesco quickly grabs the lead. He's

pulling away within seconds.

ON PIT ROW - We TRACK PAST as the various Crew Chiefs on

their crash carts bark orders to their racers. We end on Team

McQueen. No Crew Chief, just a solid looking team.

The same view of Mater but now THROUGH A TELESCOPIC DISPLAY.

Reveal Finn and Holley watching from high above in a downtown

office building, behind reflective glass.

ON THE TRACK - VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RACE through Tokyo as

Francesco extends his lead and McQueen attempts to make up

ground.

IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - Mater watches the monitors, sees them

approaching the dirt section.

ON THE TRACK - Francesco hits the dirt section and loses all

control. He SLAMS to a halt, his tires getting no traction.

MCQUEEN skids into view, turning right to go left, passing

Francesco, followed by other cars ---

McQueen now leads the pack, zooming out of the dirt now

starting to relax.

ON PAVED ROAD AGAIN - MOMENTS LATER

The field of cars thunders into a tunnel.

Francesco crests the hill, in last place. He bites down,

determined, then CHASES.

VARIOUS SHOTS OF TOKYO as the racers move through the Rainbow

Bridge. Bit by bit, Francesco ekes his way toward the front,

toward Lightning McQueen as we CUT TO ---

--- A ROOFTOP, and a VIEW THROUGH THE WGP CAMERA LENS. Grem

and Acer are manning this one. They focus it on the racers as

they approach.

ON THE TRACK - A racer (Miguel Camino) suddenly PLUMES WITH

SMOKE and skids out.

Camino quickly pits, passing McQueen's pit where Mater is

visible.

ON GREM AND ACER, watching from above.

Acer exits, with purpose.

ON FINN AND HOLLEY, still in their office hideaway. Holley's

onboard computer flashes an ALERT.

She's spotted Acer, moving swiftly forward.

The computer finds more and more bad guy Pacers and Gremlins

are in the crowd.

We PAN OVER to see it's MATER.

She turns. He's GONE, leaving only an open window.

IN MCQUEEN'S PIT. A car WHIPS BY O.S.

Mater realizes this girl has somehow broken into his radio.

ON THE TRACK - McQueen boxes out Francesco, holds his slim

lead, but barely.

BOOM! A racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke,

skids out of control.

ON GREM - laughing. That was clearly his handiwork.

IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - SAME

ON HOLLEY - Watching from the downtown building.

We CUT BACK TO ---

--- MATER. He gives in, exits the pit.

He moves toward the back PIT DOOR, is about to open it.

OUTSIDE THE PITS - ACER and another Pacer approach McQueen's

pit door on the other side. Ready to pounce. The doors OPEN,

--- Finn, holding a fire extinguisher.

He empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past. They

try and follow, but have been blinded. One of them crashes

right into a COP.

ON FINN - Already on the move, along a side street.

ON HOLLEY - Tracking everything on a grid map. Mater looks

like Pac Man, weaving through the streets as bad guys close

in all around him.

ON MATER - He turns a corner, sees a flower shop.

ON THE TRACK - McQueen, hearing this, is taken aback.

ON MATER - Slowing at the flower shop.

ON THE TRACK

McQueen drifts outside allowing Francesco to slip past!

IN THE BACK ALLEYS - As Mater moves on he's followed by

Pacers and Gremlins. Suddenly ---

--- CABLES whip in front of them, pulling over flower vending

machines and sending the shop's owners into a frenzy. They

direct their attention to the AMCs, who try and explain.

ON FINN, admiring his handiwork as he appears. Just as he

turns to leave he's BROADSIDED and pushed INTO A DARK ALLEY.

IN THE ALLEY - Finn finds himself boxed by two Pacers and

pushed toward ---

--- ACER, who now holds a FLAME THROWER.

He hits the flame. WHOOOSSSH!!

ON ANOTHER STREET - Mater clicks along, still looking for

Holley. Just as he passes the alley entrance where Finn

stares down death:

Mater turns INTO the alley.

IN THE ALLEY - Finn, now nearly pushed completely into the

flame thrower, leaps into the air. He FIGHTS BACK, using his

wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were

human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies.

Mater witnesses the whole thing.

ON THE TRACK - McQueen, now playing catch-up again, scowls.

IN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a

bullet into a gas main line, causing an EXPLOSION that tosses

Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP'S SIGN.

ON THE TRACK - The end of the race is nigh ---

The Formula car gets there first.

IN THE ALLEY - Finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage.

Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door,

momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have

past, Finn has disappeared.

EXT. PRESS STAGE - LATER

Post race press conference. Francesco is center stage.

McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly

notices something O.S.

McQueen's P.O.V. - It's MATER, appearing from a side street,

moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference.

As McQueen SNEAKS AWAY ---

IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE - Mater looks around for everyone as

McQueen approaches.

Mater.

Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the

race over? You won, right?

Mater, why were you yelling things

at me while I was racing?

Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's

funny right there. Nah, see that's

`cause I seen these two fellers

doing some sort of karate street

performance. It was nutso. One of

them even had a flamethrower ---

A flamethrower? What are you

talking about? I don't understand.

Where were you?

Going to meet my date.

Your date?

She started talking to me as a

voice in my head, telling me where

to go ---

What?

Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you

up, did I?

I lost the race because of you!

Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---

An imaginary girlfriend,

flamethrowers. This is exactly why

I don't bring you along to these

things.

The press finds McQueen, swarms him. Mater is pushed

backwards as the questions fly again.

On Mater. He takes this badly.

OVER FOOTAGE OF FRANCESCO and various other highlights:

FOOTAGE OF MILES AXLEROD, speaking to an aggressive press. He

must SHOUT over the press.

IN THE TV STUDIO - Darrell, Brent and David talk to camera.

Off a FROZEN IMAGE of McQueen crossing the finish line, a

look of severe consternation across his face ---

--- MATCH CUT TO ---

INT. AIRPORT - JAPAN - DAY

--- McQueen's SMILING FACE, on a Team McQueen poster.

REVERSE to reveal Mater looking at it, sadly. He drives on,

passing (but not noticing) ---

--- GREM and ACER.

AT THE SECURITY CHECK - MOMENTS LATER. Cars take off their

tires, move through the metal detector. Mater waits in line.

A SECURITY CAR approaches Mater.

IN THE ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER. The Security Car

leads Mater inside.

As they move past us the Security Car covertly drops a BALL

BEARING which rolls into a corner. The ball bearing then

sprouts MECHANICAL LEGS, tripods itself and IRISES out,

revealing itself to be a tiny CAMERA.

IN THE MAIN ROOM - ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

Mater follows the Security Car in, nervous.

ZWAPPPPPP!! The Security Car suddenly DECLOAKS himself,

reveals himself to be Finn McMissile!

BEEP! Finn's rearview alarms. His camera has picked up Grem

and Acer. They've just entered the lounge, are right around

the corner.

Finn quickly turns, fires a tiny GLASS CUTTING BEETLE at the

window. As Mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a

round hole.

Mater does his best (worst) karate moves as Acer and Grem

turn the corner.

The glass drops away, leaving a car-sized hole.

Finn HOOKS Mater from behind. He YANKS HIM forward ---

--- and LEAPS OUT THE WINDOW!

EXT. TARMAC - AIRPORT - JAPAN

Finn pulls Mater down HARD onto the tarmac, towing him away

from the terminal.

ACER and GREM appear, chasing them. Mater, who is facing

backward as he is being pulled along, faces them. They're

about a hundred yards back.

Finn SKIDS around, whipping Mater in a 180 so that Mater is

now towing Finn.

Grem produces a ROCKET, lines up Finn as his target.

Finn, without hesitation, fires a MINI ROLLING-JACK. The jack

DRIVES ITSELF toward Grem, anchors itself under his frame and

flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket

THE ROCKET - it flies toward Mater and Finn.

FINN aims and launches a MISSILE back.

THE ROCKET AND MISSILE COLLIDE IN MID-AIR, EXPLODE.

A GULFSTREAM JET wings into view overhead. This is SIDDELEY.

Mater looks up: ACER screeches into view up ahead, dragging a

long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to

create an accident.

Just as it looks dire --- RATATATATATATAT!!! SIDDELEY

descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts

sky-high. Mater and Finn burst through them, luggage now

raining down from above.

Siddeley LANDS HARD on the tarmac ahead of them. No time to

stop, he DROPS his back open, revealing HOLLEY.

Mater SPEEDS UP toward Siddeley's ramp, Holley.

Just as Mater's wheels touch the ramp, BULLETS PING around

him in a spray. Siddeley is HIT, a tire BLOWN. He yells in

pain.

Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass.

A gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S

TIRE, blowing it and throwing him off-course.

Acer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET ---

--- OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker.

ON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac,

where the grass and runway meet WATER. He HITS THE GAS, his

only hope.

Finn BRAKES, 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets

air.

Mater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes

from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds. As he's

PULLED in through the back hatch:

INT. LOBBY - HOTEL - TOKYO - DAY

CLOSE ON a handwritten (er, tire-written?) NOTE in childish

scrawl. We don't see all of it, only a bit. Mater's voice

O.S. begins the note with the first sentence, but we DISSOLVE

into McQueen's voice.

McQueen takes this in.

EXT. SKY - DAY

SIDDELEY breaks through some cloud cover, flies with purpose.

INT. JET - DAY

A well-appointed spy jet. Various computers line the walls.

With a ROBOTIC ARM, Holley grabs the THE DEVICE that Rod

Redline hid under Mater. She yanks it out with a GOOSE.

Holley drops the device into a mainframe computer. It starts

"ANALYZING."

DING! The computer is done analyzing. The cabin lights dim.

AN IMAGE is blasted between the three of them. It's of a

photograph, a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck

together.

Holley has these stats in seconds. Kid's play.

Mater MOVES HIS SEAT FORWARD, through one part of the

hologram so he's face-to-face with Holley.

She moves the engine photo so it's now blocking Mater again.

Holley drops her screen down.

EXT. JET - MOVING

Siddeley HITS THE JUICE, they kick forward like a mule as we

CUT TO ---

A MONTAGE OF PARIS: Mater attempts to merge into roundabout

traffic; mimes annoy tourists at the Eiffel Tower; a painter

works his magic on an unattractive couple; a couple kisses on

the most romantic spot in the world; we might even catch

GASTOW'S RESTAURANT.

The charming, low-key introduction ends with a SWEEPING VISTA

of Paris's center from far away as we CRANE DOWN INTO ---

EXT. STREET - DAY

--- a dirty street in the 1st Arrondissement. Finn and Holley

drive along together as Mater, playing "spy," darts back and

forth behind them from doorway to dumpster, "hiding out."

He's having a ball.

As Finn and Holley and Mater turn the corner...

Mater turns the corner and enters a massive Les Halles-

inspired Parisian market filled with car parts. A tow truck's

dream.

IN THE MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

Mater rolls along, impressed by the goods for sale.

Mater continues on though, heeding Finn's advice.

INT. ENCLOSED MARKETPLACE - DAY

Mater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened

stall. He STOPS, peers in. There's someone in there.

It suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing... EYES!! In

French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater

FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED.

AROUND THE CORNER - FINN AND HOLLEY

A few car lengths ahead of Mater. They roll along, looking

for... Aha! Finn and Holley recede into the shadows.

In FINN'S SIDE MIRROR: TOMBER, a three-wheeled parts dealer,

argues with a French customer.

Mater suddenly turns the corner, sees Finn and Holley.

Too late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in

a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase.

Tomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in Finn's way. Holley

quickly pivots RIGHT and disappears. Where did she go?

Finn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground

--- Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to

grill with HOLLEY. He whips to the left but TURNS OVER,

rolling sideways and CRASHING to a stop.

Holley ZAPS him with ELECTROSHOCKERS. Finn suddenly arrives,

stops her.

MOMENTS LATER - Mater tows Tomber, following Finn and Holley.

INT. A SMALL GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Finn throws open a door. Cars scatter like cockroaches.

Mater unhooks an angry Tomber who spits in French. Finn pulls

the door down. As it LATCHES TIGHT ---

Holley FUMES with anger.

Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of

Tomber.

Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.

Suddenly, Tomber narrows his gaze.

Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL

PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.

Holley refers to the ENGINE PHOTO, which now rises forward as

the prominent picture, perhaps the only one in view.

EXT. FRENCH ALPS - NIGHT

STEPHENSON, a THREE-CAR LUXURY BULLET TRAIN speeds along a

snow-covered mountain in the dead of night, its halogen

headlight cutting through the darkness. It DIPS into a

INT. SPY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Mater, Finn and Holley scroll through surveillance-style

photos of TRAFFIC on an Italian street. They're in the front

train car, which doubles as a luxury seating area and

intelligence command center.

Mater refers to a photo of VICTOR HUGO, the HUGO Lemonhead,

being towed by an EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK.

Holley SNAPS Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him.

Holley turns back to her monitor. Mater's face appears on

screen. She quickly GRAFTS it over the Hugo's tow truck's.

Holley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or

how pleased it makes her.

EXT. SMALL TOWN - ITALY - OUTSIDE PORTO CORSA - DAY

A quaint Italian piazza. A pristine MASERATI FOUNTAIN,

complete with ancient trident, looms in our view.

Luigi and Guido roll into view.

Sarge, Fillmore and McQueen exit a WGP transport truck.

UNCLE TOPOLINO, a distinguished 1937 Fiat Topolino, rolls

forward. He greets them warmly with affectionate Italian

salutations as word of Guido and Luigi's arrival spreads. The

square FILLS with family and friends.

EXT. PIAZZA - DUSK

A festive homecoming party. Lights strung across the square.

Music and dancing. Fillmore and Sarge are at a dining table.

LIGHTNING MCQUEEN rolls along the periphery of the square,

seems lost in thought.

Uncle Topolino beckons McQueen over.

MAMA TOPOLINO, a hefty Italian grandmother pipes up, a mile a

minute then drives off, now a car on a mission.

Too late. She's disappeared inside her kitchen.

McQueen takes this in, impressed.

They amble forward, Uncle Topolino setting the pace.

McQueen considers this - a realization.

IN THE SQUARE - Guido dances with a girl. Luigi suddenly CUTS

IN. They begin to ARGUE.

Guido now LIFTS Luigi, cuts BACK in.

McQueen takes this in. Seems to take some small comfort.

McQueen's comfort quickly evaporates.

Guido and Luigi now dance together with the girl and her

friend who has just arrived. All having a great time. They

dance past us, crossing in front of MCQUEEN AND UNCLE

TOPOLINO. We STAY WITH them.

Mama Topolino drops a tray of food in front of McQueen.

ON MCQUEEN, distant, taking all of this in, lost in thought

as, in the background, Uncle Topolino and Mama Topolino talk,

then argue, then make up (all in Italian) all while we stay

on McQueen's pensive face ---

INT. TRAIN TUNNEL - LATER

Stephenson glides along, all business.

INT. TRAIN - MOVING - LATER

Finn watches as HOLLEY attaches a new EMERGENCY LIGHT on

Mater's roof. It looks exactly like his old one.

ZWWWWAT! A HOLOGRAPHIC disguise suddenly umbrellas out,

emitted from Mater's roof. It drops a clean cloaking image of

the EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK over Mater.

ZWATTTT! Mater suddenly wears lederhosen and a German hat.

He's transformed into Dracula, complete with fangs.

Finn suddenly pushes a button, stops the madness.

Mater, chastened, moves on.

Holley turns back to her work. The disguise's cloaking is

larger than Mater. As a result, Holley must dial it back to

fit his body. As she carefully calibrates the hologram:

Holley STOPS. The 3D disguise is now flush with his frame,

but dents SHOW THROUGH.

She deploys A BONDO SPRAYER on a robotic arm, moves it toward

one of Mater's DENTS. Mater pulls away.

Finn hits a button. The walls transform into a MASSIVE

WEAPONS CACHE.

Off Mater's RXN ---

EXT. ALPS - DAWN

--- STEPHENSON EMERGES LOUDLY from a tunnel. He powers

forward, starts his descent into Italy ---

EXT. PORTO CORSA, ITALY - DAY

Over sweeping helicopter BEAUTY SHOTS:

A local fishing boat chugs through an idyllic waterway,

beneath bridges that connect hillside villas.

A long line of RICH-LOOKING YACHTS in the harbor.

Rich SPORTS CARS drive past pricey shops.

THE POPEMOBILE, visible in a crowd, drives through town.

HELICOPTER SHOT of the Casino.

MUSTANGBURGER, HOBBSCAP and CARTRIP in the control booth.

FOOTAGE OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE - Miles Axlerod, at a podium,

addresses the press throng. He looks a bit exasperated.

RACE GRAPHICS show Francesco with 10 points at the top of the

race standings.

ON THE TRACK - As the racers begin to get into position on

the grid.

The crowd is cheering already, knows who this is.

The Italian crowd roars and chants for their hometown hero.

McQueen missed this comment. He approaches his grid position,

lost in thought.

Cheers (not so thunderous, obviously) from the crowd. McQueen

doesn't seem to notice.

IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - His team exchanges looks, worried.

BACK ON THE STARTING GRID

Francesco parks next to him, grinning.

Francesco refers to his MAMA who sits in a special box in the

crowd, cheering him on, blowing him kisses.

THE LIGHTS - CLICK FROM RED TO GREEN ---

THE RACERS TAKE OFF!

EXT. PORTO CORSA - DAY

SHOTS of the racers making the first few turns through the

city streets. We PAN to the CASINO DI PORTO CORSA. The Beaux

Arts-style architecture towers atop a hill, overlooks the

course.

EXT. THE CASINO - MOMENTS LATER

A group of thuggish HUGOS - ugly Eastern European cars - wait

impatiently at the front. A LIMOUSINE-STYLE car carrier rolls

up to the roundabout.

An esteemed, elderly GREMLIN rolls past with a group of

GREMLIN THUGS who usher him into the casino.

The THUGS all SNICKER.

Holley arrives, sporting a decent Italian accent.

IVAN, AN EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK (the one Holley and Finn

prepped Mater to impersonate), drives forward.

Holley directs her interest toward Ivan.

MATER - He watches this from a safe hiding spot around a

corner.

FINN, at an outdoor cafe on the casino grounds.

MATER, now looking a bit nervous. He backs out of sight.

While Finn talks, Mater takes this in. He catches his own

reflection in a nearby window. Seems to be seeing himself

with new eyes.

ZZZZATTT! Mater jumps at the sound, turns in time to see Ivan

SHOCKED UNCONSCIOUS by Holley's ZAPPERS.

EXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER - CONTINUOUS

Mater, now disguised as Ivan the Tow Truck, approaches the

Hugos. Another LIMO CAR CARRIER arrives.

The carrier parks and the back opens. VICTOR HUGO waits.

Mater realizes Victor is talking to him. He hops to it.

Mater, now with Victor hooked, tows him in the front doors of

the casino.

ON FINN - now joined in the cafe by Holley who monitors

everything and SEES EVERYTHING MATER SEES on her display.

EXT. RACE COURSE - PORTO CORSA - DAY

McQueen and Francesco battle for first place ---

INT. CASINO - DAY

Cars play craps with FUZZY DICE; slot machines with odometers

for jackpot numbers; cigarette girls sell car items.

ON MATER - He tows VICTOR. They are flanked on all four

corners by Hugo thugs, ala a presidential motorcade. The

largess of the interior design seems to finally snap Mater

out of his funk.

The Hugos on either side of Mater exchange a look.

MATER'S P.O.V. - A digital readout isolates the Hugo and

starts to scroll reams of information alongside.

IN A WIDER SHOT we realize this display is invisible to all

but Mater. Some of Alex's other alias' include "Alexander Hu-

Don't Go" and "Alexander the Not-So Great."

Alexander Hugo, unaware of Holley's interruption, whispers to

Mater as they turn a corner.

EXT. CASINO - DAY

Holley, hearing this, can't believe it.

INT. CASINO - DAY

Mater tows Victor inside a private room, where inside are the

WORLD'S WORST CARS including VLADMIR TRUNKOV, TUBBS PACER and

J. CURBY GREMLIN.

WHAM! A DOOR is thrown open O.S. Everyone turns, now silent.

ON THE DOOR - It sits open. No one enters.

The room of Lemons watch, nervous.

ON MATER - Nervously watching too.

EXT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS

A car finally appears. It's Zundapp.

Everyone looks disappointed.

MONITORS descend from the ceiling. On them, an image of AN

ENGINE - the same bloody engine from the photo. But this is a

LIVE image. The car is being worked on.

The VOICE is garbled, scrambled. No way to determine who.

The Lemons all nod in understanding.

EXT. CASINO

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS

On VICTOR HUGO.

On TUBBS PACER.

On J. CURBY GREMLIN:

On ZUNDAPP.

And finally back on the monitor. The ENGINE.

The monitors switch to LIVE RACE FOOTAGE.

On the VIDEO SCREENS - CARLA VELOSO'S ENGINE BLOWS ---

EXT. RACE COURSE - CONTINUOUS

Veloso swerves, attempts to mitigate a crash ---

She skids into a wall, hard.

EXT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS

The lemons are CHEERING. Mater is freaked out.

BOOM! Another racer blows an engine. Mater JUMPS again.

EXT. RACE COURSE - SAME

As the racer smashes into the railing ---

EXT. CASINO

Holley replays that last crash. The OUTLINE OF THE BEAM is

seen hitting the racer. Holley TRACES THIS to its source ---

--- a WGP CAMERA, which Grem and Acer have pointed at the

racers from a tower position.

Finn TAKES OFF, speeding toward Grem and Acer ---

EXT. GRANDSTANDS - RACE COURSE - CONTINUOUS

Angry fans knock over cans of Allinol. One drives over an

Allinol sign. They're fed up with it.

We RACK FOCUS to reveal another fan as he RIPS an Allinol

banner down angrily.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS

The video screens are now filled with ONE IMAGE - of the OIL

PLATFORMS in the Pacific from the beginning of the movie.

EXT. STREETS OF PORTO CORSA - CONTINUOUS

Finn ducks, weaves, speeds, and pushes his way through

He speeds furiously through town.

EXT. RACE COURSE - PORTO CORSA - CONTINUOUS

McQueen and Francesco FLY PAST US.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO

ON FINN - He SPEEDS up a road, Grem and Acer visible ahead of

him. He LEAPS over the crevasse toward the AMC cousins ---

Suddenly, FINN FREEZES. He's immobilized in mid-air!

He looks up. A CHOPPER with a LARGE MAGNET hovers over him.

Grem and Acer turn back to the camera. They line up Shu

Todoroki, who's a bit further along now.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS

EXT. RACE COURSE

Grem ZAPS THE RACER.

Flames burst from Todoroki. He loses control.

Shu takes down three more cars with him and others follow

suit. It's a nightmare pileup.

EXT. CASINO - SAME

Holley sees Finn being flown away by the chopper.

EXT. FINISH LINE - PORTO CORSA - CONTINUOUS

McQueen NOSES out Francesco for a win, both oblivious to

what's just happened.

They see the pile-up from an overhead monitor. Sirens blare

as a MEDIC CHOPPER flies to the scene of the pile-up.

MILES AXLEROD - LATER. He's near the casino. He's completely

surrounded, 360 degrees, by press. He's drowned out by a

blizzard of questions.

PULL BACK to reveal we are watching this on monitors in the

PRIVATE CASINO ROOM with the Lemonheads, Zundapp and Mater.

On Miles Axlerod: He's devastated.

WILD WHOOPING CHEERS fill the room. Lemonade corks are

popped.

EXT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

Holley is already on the run. Speeding away.

She turns a corner and STOPS.

Her escape is now blocked by the same HUGO THUGS she tricked

before. Another vehicle appears BEHIND HER, LOOMS.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS

The Lemonheads celebrate, chant "Long live lemons!" Mater,

scared, turns to leave. He's stopped by ALEXANDER HUGO.

He turns, sees that McQueen is being interviewed on the

monitors.

The excitement suddenly DRAINS from the room.

On Mater. He takes this in.

Zundapp is already on the phone with their Big Boss who,

based on his angry O.S. voice, sounds ticked off.

Zundapp hangs up, turns to the room.

Mater's eyes open wide.

Mater backs up, KNOCKING his emergency light against one of

the monitors. ZZZZZAT! His holographic disguise flickers away

then quickly SCROLLS THROUGH all of his previous disguises,

finally revealing rusty old Mater.

The thugs DRAW TERRIFYING WEAPONS.

WHIRRRRR! GUNS roll out of Mater on each side.

Mater SPRAYS BULLETS into the crowd.

The Lemons and Lemonheads hit the deck and RETURN FIRE ---

Mater is THROWN BACKWARD by the force of the guns, back

through some double doors and onto a BALCONY.

WHOOM! A PARACHUTE BURSTS out of the back of Mater, he

catches air and is YANKED INTO THE SKY!

The Lemonheads watch him float away, amazed.

ON MATER, out of the frying pan but still toasty. He looks

around, notices:

LIGHTNING MCQUEEN, far away, leaving the press podium.

Mater looks down at the harbor, over which he flies. He spots

a MOTORBOAT. Mater WHIPS his hook down, steals a ride behind

the boat TOWARD MCQUEEN.

The motorboat isn't happy about this, tries to shake him.

Mater is THROWN INTO A "HOTEL" sign, then SMASHES down

through a Francesco souvenir stand. As he CRASHES onto the

ground hard, we SMASH CUT TO ---

EXT. SECURITY CHECKPOINT - WINNERS CIRCLE

--- a barricade. Separating the press from the public,

ITALIAN SECURITY TRUCKS stand guard.

MATER barrels around a corner. He's now covered in Francesco

memorabilia and palm leaves. The word `HOT' now dangles off

him like the world's biggest bling. He looks INSANE.

Security eyes one another. This is serious.

Mater spots McQueen far off in the distance.

JUST OFF THE PRESS STAGE - McQueen is led toward the exit.

McQueen looks up but can only see A SEA OF VEHICLES,

flashbulbs, cameras, TV trucks with those tall satellite

antennae things that spindle toward the sky...

BACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater, like a nimble running

back, dances around to avoid capture by security.

Mater head fakes them and pushes through, into the crowd ---

IN THE CROWD - Mater shoves his way through. He's still far

in the back.

ON MATER, getting CLOSER...

ON MCQUEEN - Okay, he's positive that was his friend, but

where is he?

McQueen spots a TOW HOOK, moving through the crowd toward

him, "Jaws"-like.

McQueen disappears into the press crowd.

McQueen pushes through the press.

McQueen tracks the tow hook, gets closer. He pushes through

the last few vehicles ---

It's NOT MATER. It's IVAN, the Hugo Thug's tow truck.

Now the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen

back in the other direction ---

As he's pulled away, press and onlookers start to come

between him and Ivan, who hasn't moved.

Ivan is now obscured again.

The ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm.

McQueen is pulled back ---

EXT. STREET - PORTO CORSA - MOMENTS LATER

--- just as Mater, now BOUND and with HIS MOUTH TAPED, is

pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle.

He lands hard on his side, spits out his TAPE.

As the doors close on Mater --- PHHHHHSSSSSSTTTTTTT! A

thick, noxious gas starts to fill the truck.

On MATER as the knockout gas works its magic. HIS EYES CLOSE.

BLACK SCREEN.

FADE IN on Mater, back at the Casino, eyeing his reflection

in the glass window. It's the same moment from before except

now we are watching it from a DETACHED, FLOATING PERSPECTIVE.

- IN THE KABUKI THEATER IN JAPAN - Again, from before. Mater

makes a spectacle of himself, WHOOPING AND HOLLERING in the

stands with the face paint on.

McQueen, Fillmore, Guido, Luigi, Sarge and patrons eye Mater,

embarrassed and angry.

- IN THE JAPANESE MUSEUM - The moment of Mater banging on the

Zen rock garden's glass. Except that now we see all sorts of

disappointed and eyebrow raising reactions.

We now REVEAL that this FLOATING, THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE is

MATER. He's INSIDE his past, watching it from others' points

of view. He doesn't like what he sees.

- ON MATER, now at the sushi bar.

Mater swallows the wasabi with one big bite. He SCREAMS! The

sushi bar patrons blanch with revulsion at his wail.

- ON THE FOUNTAIN, as Mater peels into full view of everyone

else at the party. As Mater laps up water from a fountain:

ALL THE RACERS, with FRANCESCO front and center, guffaw at

Mater.

- On MCQUEEN, now scolding Mater moments later.

- IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE, after the Japanese race.

- Now BACK AT THE PARTY, a moment we didn't see before but

which presumably happened. Mater is BANGING a ceremonial

GONG, to the horror of Japanese guests.

GONNNNNNG!!! ---

On the PARTYGOERS, RACE CARS, PARTY STAFF - they're all

laughing at Mater as McQueen's final words blend in, making a

Off the GONG at the party ---

INT. BIG BENTLEY - DAY

--- to the GONG of a CLOCK.

CLOSE ON MATER as he OPENS HIS EYES.

All around him, all he sees are GIANT PIECES OF MECHANIZED

CLOCKWORK.

HOLLEY and FINN are here too, strapped bumper to bumper in

the divots of large clock movements.

EXT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS

The BIG HAND finishes ADVANCING one minute. It's 3 PM.

INT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS

Suddenly Mater DROPS QUICKLY down toward ---

--- whirring, scary machinery.

WHAP! The chain yanks to a STOP.

Mater, instead of being 30 feet from death, is now 20.

Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed

themselves. The clock ticks to 3:01.

This echoes throughout the clock.

Finn and Holley take this in.

GREM and ACER arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk.

Acer whips a sheet away, revealing the WGP CAMERA, turns it

toward the clock face.

He pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it

toward the course. Mater DROPS down again ---

FINN and HOLLEY CLICK FORWARD.

EXT. LONDON - DAY

Big Bentley's big hand CLICKS ahead another minute. But we're

a bit farther away from it than before.

INT. MCQUEEN'S PIT - LONDON

Sally, flanked by Red, Flo and Ramone, are in front of ----

--- McQueen and the rest of the team.

A HORN O.S. Someone's entering the pit. Everyone parts,

revealing MILES AXLEROD.

McQueen takes this in. He looks at Sally.

EXT. THE STARTING GRID - MOMENTS LATER

TIRES SQUEAL ---

MCQUEEN, FRANCESCO and the other racers PEEL OUT ---

We PAN UP to reveal the LEMONHEADS watching from a VIP box.

EXT. RACE COURSE - LONDON - DAY

McQueen leads Francesco as they approach Big Bentley...

INT. BIG BENTLEY - LONDON - CONTINUOUS

Grem turns up the juice to the HIGHEST, DEATH-INDUCING LEVEL.

Holley and Finn watch, helpless. Mater closes his eyes.

Grem ZAPS MCQUEEN.

EXT. RACE COURSE - LONDON

McQueen SPEEDS PAST Big Bentley, unharmed. Oblivious to what

was supposed to have just happened.

INT. BIG BENTLEY - LONDON

Zundapp suddenly SQUAWKS over the radio.

They're all talking at once and for a moment we cannot

understand what is being said.

Grem hangs up.

They LAUGH. Mater shudders, upset.

Grem and Acer laugh. As they board the elevator:

Suddenly, Mater's GATLING GUNS rotate out again - a surprise

to Mater. But they SPIN IN PLACE, empty.

Grem and Acer just laugh more.

Mater NOTICES SOMETHING.

CLOSE ON WHAT MATER SEES: A small piece of his ropes have

been shaved away by the Gatling.

He carefully rotates his guns BACK IN, pretending like he's

seen nothing.

They're GONE.

The guns ROTATE OUT AGAIN, SPIN. Mater watches as the

spinning barrels SLICE INTO the ropes, do some damage.

The COMPUTER responds with each "dadgum." The barrels

continue to SPIN, CUTTING THROUGH the ropes.

PING! The ropes BREAK AWAY and Mater FALLS --- right toward

the whirring machinery!

Mater QUICKLY WHIPS his tow cable around, hooks a pipe and

tosses himself to the ramp with a heavy THUD. He doesn't

Mater SPEEDS out the front door, a bat out of hell ---

INT. BIG BENTLEY - LONDON - SAME

On Finn and Holley, now closer to death.

At this mention Holley seems to perk up, gets an idea.

She spies a GEARBOX below them, at least 20 feet down. Holley

FIRES HER ELECTROSHOCKERS ---

--- but they miss their target. She recoils them back.

She FIRES them again. Direct hit!

Holley JUICES the gearbox with HIGH VOLTAGE. The CLOCK STOPS.

It reverses itself.

Finn and Holley's wheel now rotates AWAY from danger.

EXT. LONDON - CONTINUOUS

BIG BENTLEY, visible from street level, now moves BACKWARDS.

Fast. CRANE DOWN TO ---

--- Mater, speeding toward the track, unaware.

INT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS

Finn and Holley are now moving in the opposite direction,

toward ANOTHER GEAR! And it's going MUCH FASTER. They're

seconds from a crushing death...

They both DRIVE, fast as they can with FULL FORCE ---

They drive HARDER, separating bumpers with just enough room

for the descending gear to SNAP THEIR ROPES!

Their tires spinning, they both LAUNCH off in opposite

directions, LAND HARD on opposing platforms. As Finn squeals

around to Holley's side of the clock:

Holley pops WINGS out of her side.

They turn to leave when they STOP, see SOMETHING. It's an AIR

FILTER on the ground.

EXT. BIG BENTLEY - LONDON

Finn BURSTS out the front doors of Big Bentley, speeds off as

HOLLEY SMASHES through the clock face, careens into view

flying over the traffic ---

INT. PIT ROW - TRACK SIDE - DAY

Mater bursts through the security gate with aplomb, tears

through the pits and stops at MCQUEEN'S.

The ENTIRE RADIATOR SPRINGS GANG is here.

EXT. LONDON STREETS - CONTINUOUS

ON HIS REARVIEW DISPLAY: We can see that a BOMB has been

detected, anchored to Mater's air filter.

INT. MCQUEEN'S PIT - CONTINUOUS

Mater SNORTS, blowing his air filter cover off. Cross-eyed,

Mater sees the explosive device attached to him. He looks up:

An ALLINOL CONTAINER hangs ominously over his head.

Mater turns. McQueen enters Pit Row, 100 yards away and

closing in FAST.

The view of this scene through the window of a luxury box.

Reveal Zundapp in the window's reflection. He's watching from

inside. He's poised to push a DETONATOR BUTTON.

As Zundapp's front tire approaches the detonator ---

INT. MCQUEEN'S PIT - CONTINUOUS

Mater PEELS OUT BACKWARDS, out onto the track.

PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP - He hesitates, can't believe it.

TV FOOTAGE OF MCQUEEN CHASING MATER

IN MCQUEEN'S PIT

He breezes right through his pit, goes after Mater.

EXT. TRACK - DAY

Mater drives up the track. McQueen gains, fast. Because

Mater's going backwards, they're face-to-face (but still with

some distance between them).

TV FOOTAGE OF MCQUEEN CHASING MATER

REVEAL ZUNDAPP is watching this footage from his luxury box.

The closer McQueen gets to Mater the farther his tire ROLLS

onto the detonator. But he holds back ever so slightly so as

not to jump the gun.

ON THE TRACK - McQueen gains on Mater.

ON ZUNDAPP. He watches as McQueen SPEEDS UP.

ON MCQUEEN. He's had enough screwing around. Here he comes.

He's going to catch him now.

McQueen JUMPS FORWARD, in an attempt to grab Mater's HOOK ---

McQueen hooks Mater with his bumper JUST AS ---

TURBINE ROCKETS slide out of Mater.

BAWHOOOOOOM!!!!! Mater JOLTS forward with a rocket blast and

disappears, taking McQueen with him.

ON ZUNDAPP. He now freely PUSHES the detonator, but it says

"OUT OF RANGE."

Zundapp can't believe it. He FLIPS OUT.

FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Francesco speeds along. ZHWAAAAAP!!!

Mater and McQueen ZING PAST HIM with a RED BLUR.

NOW EVEN FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Mater takes a turn, SMASHES

THROUGH A FENCE and skids around a corner out of sight. A

white, smoky JET TRAIL is all that remains.

IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - All of Radiator Springs watches the

television monitors, dumbfounded.

EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - DAY

Overhead P.O.V.: Mater and McQueen swerve through the

streets.

INT. LUXURY BOX - CONTINUOUS

Zundapp is still furiously hitting the button as Holley drops

into view just beyond the glass.

Freaked, Zundapp does a 180 and SMASHES out a plate glass

window, lands on a ridiculously large balloon tethered to the

ground, and speeds off ---

INT. ADJACENT LUXURY BOX - CONTINUOUS

The LEMONHEADS watch, baffled, as Zundapp drives away.

Grem and Acer are already out the door ---

EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME

Finn speeds into view, in time to see Zundapp turn a corner

out of sight.

EXT. TRACK - SAME

Holley, still in the air, turns ---

FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Holley THUNDERS past Francesco and out

of sight.

EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - SAME

Finn screams around a corner, sees ---

--- Professor Zundapp, speeding toward docks along the Thames

where a COMBAT SHIP waits.

ON ZUNDAPP - With Finn gaining fast, he accelerates. Suddenly

--- WHAP!

He's been TETHERED by Finn with tensile cables now attached

to his rear end. Zundapp SCREAMS like a little girl.

Finn reels him in. Zundapp spins his wheels, caught.

Suddenly Zundapp miraculously, inconceivably, GAINS TRACTION!

Now it's FINN'S WHEELS that are spinning.

ON THE COMBAT SHIP - the ELECTROMAGNET has been turned

outward and switched on. He's PULLING ZUNDAPP AND FINN IN

with the magnetic force. He pulls out a laser, TARGETS it at

Finn's windshield.

EXT. LONDON STREETS - SAME

Mater, still towing McQueen, rockets around a corner, zips

down another street ---

They pass a Gremlin with a headset.

ON GREM AND ACER - Down another side street. They get this

message, take off in the opposite direction.

EXT. DOCKS NEAR THE THAMES - CONTINUOUS

FINN, tires squealing, loses more and more ground to the

boat. Zundapp, the "rope" in this tug-of-war, buckles under

the tension.

Finn releases a mess of bullets, grenades, and other weaponry

into the air ---

THE MAGNET SUCKS it in quickly like a black hole ---

THUNK! It all sticks to the magnet, right next to Finn's

bullets. They're BOMBS, GRENADES, ROCKETS and one little

detonator with a flashing, beeping light.

Off the boat's RXN ---

ANOTHER PART OF LONDON, AT STREET LEVEL

KA-BOOOOOOM! A distant explosion (miles away) festoons into

the air, visible over the rooftops. Holley suddenly WINGS

into view. She sees ---

Mater and McQueen, speeding up the street.

Then she looks over, catches a glimpse of GREM AND ACER,

bearing down on them from a side street. They're going to

broadside Mater and McQueen.

ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - They're not aware of the impending

impact.

Holley DROPS FROM THE SKY, hits the pavement, SKIDS into the

path of the AMCs and DEFLECTS THEM. They FLIP OVER Holley,

Finn and McQueen and sail ---

--- INTO A PUB ---

--- where they skid across the room and SLAM into the bar,

knocking a ROW OF BEER MUGS to the ground.

IN THE PUB - MOMENTS LATER

Grem and Acer are pulverized by the bar patrons.

EXT. LONDON STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Holley, McQueen and Mater are now stopped.

She's already SCANNING the bomb, working away.

Professor Zundapp suddenly ROLLS to a stop next to (a now

totally freaked) McQueen, entangled in grappling hooks care

--- Finn, who has him leashed.

The BOMB suddenly TRANSFORMS into a TIME BOMB, now complete

with a countdown mechanism from 4:59... 4:58... Mater GASPS.

Holley immediately shoves a GUN in Zundapp's grill.

THE BOMB'S TIMER: It loses a full minute! Goes from 4:48 to

3:48 to 3:47... Mater GASPS.

ZZZZZZATTT! Holley shocks him unconscious.

VICTOR HUGO blocks the entrance to a side street. He's

surrounded by Hugo relatives.

The four streets surrounding them are now blocked by each of

the Lemonheads and their families.

McQueen turns to Mater - he wasn't expecting that.

The Lemons all eye each other, considering Mater's words.

WHOOM!!! He's BROADSIDED by a blast of water from O.S.

It's Red! He's sitting outside an underground entrance,

followed by Sally and the rest of the Radiator Springs gang.

ALL OUT WAR ensues between the LEMONS, RADIATOR SPRINGS along

with FINN and HOLLEY.

FINN attaches his four-way cable hooks to the thugs and

springs high in the air, crushing the four of them together.

HOLLEY SPROUTS her wings, and knocks out two cars on her

side.

VARIOUS SHOTS OF RADIATOR SPRINGS KICKING BUTT:

Guido pulls some LEMON tires off with his air gun. In seconds

he has a stack of lugnuts next to him.

The two Pacers' tires all FALL OFF.

Flo hits VLADIMIR TRUNKOV with her high-beams, BLINDING HIM.

Sheriff BOOTS him.

Guido pushes away his tireless thug, YELLING AT HIM IN

ITALIAN.

Mater KARATE CHOPS lemons, three and four at a time.

Ramone SPRAY PAINTS a lemon's windshield.

A few Lemons turn back the way they came. BLOCKING THEIR PATH

are a line of BRITISH MILITARY VEHICLES clad in digital camo,

led by SARGE.

And in the middle of all of this craziness we CUT TO ---

--- MATER. WRENCH BITS are strewn all around him as Guido

tries wrench after wrench to take the bolts off. No dice.

Guido gestures wildly, spits Italian a mile a minute.

This is a light bulb moment for Mater. He eyes the bolts.

Mater looks at McQueen. It is?

Mater HOOKS McQueen and they're off.

They SHOOT PAST FINN, who's in the middle of battling lemons.

ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - Flying down a side street.

The ROCKET THRUSTERS kick in. They head right for a WALL.

Mater's chute POPS OPEN, catching air and sending Mater and

McQueen SAILING INTO THE AIR.

Mater starts to steer them the direction he wants. He and

McQueen are FLYING OVER LONDON.

EXT. BALCONY - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

The QUEEN, her attendants, assorted dignitaries are here.

Mater and McQueen drop from the sky. They land and skid to a

halt just before the Queen's guards who DRAW THEIR WEAPONS.

Mater BOWS to the Queen. In doing so, the TICKING TIME BOMB

angles into view. The clock's at T-minus 1:53.

Finn dives onto the platform and rolls between the Queen and

Mater.

He turns to Miles Axlerod.

Everyone exchanges confused looks, including Finn and Holley.

Holley projects the much discussed PHOTO OF THE ENGINE.

Mater moves toward Miles Axlerod to pop his hood.

Miles Axlerod BACKS UP to the edge of the stage.

The QUEEN'S GUARDS have had ENOUGH. As has the PRINCE.

Mater sticks his ticking bomb-nose into Miles Axlerod's

grill.

And the QUEEN'S GUARDS spirit the Queen and Prince Wheeliam

out of there FAST ---

Now it's just Miles Axlerod, Mater, McQueen, Finn and Holley.

Miles Axlerod's back tires slip on the edge of the podium as

he is cornered by Mater.

00:00:08...

00:03...00:02...

Everyone FLINCHES, DUCKS or DIVES FOR COVER except McQueen,

Mater and Axlerod ---

The bomb FREEZES at 00:01.

General shock all around. Miles Axlerod realizes what he's

done, looks terrified. Police surround him.

Mater FLINGS Miles Axlerod's hood open with his hook,

revealing AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, oil dripping from

all sides. It MATCHES the photo.

Tire bump.

EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

A massive crowd packs the adjacent streets and parks.

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

Mater does the requisite "silly faces" in an attempt to break

the composure of a Buckingham Palace Guard. It isn't working.

McQueen approaches.

INT. QUEEN'S CHAMBER - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

The Queen sits in attention at the front of the Main

Ballroom. As Mater and McQueen approach:

McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls

forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day.

Applause from all around.

He continues introducing everyone as we CUT TO ---

EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY

The town sign now reads "WELCOME TO RADIATOR SPRINGS - HOME

OF LIGHTNING MCQUEEN AND SIR TOW MATER."

EXT. FLO'S - DAY

Cars surround Mater and McQueen. The rest of the Radiator

Springs gang is here too, watches. VAN and MINNY are front

and center.

The crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is

right below her, driving up the street.

Everyone is shocked. Including Mater. Guido's jaw drops.

Indeed, Holley still wears the dent from when she saved Mater

from Grem and Acer.

Mater takes this in.

McQueen turns to Fillmore. Everyone does.

EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER

A banner says "Radiator Springs Grand Prix."

SHERIFF rolls up the street.

MCQUEEN heads up Main Street, other racers following.

McQueen SEES Sally. He and Francesco approach her.

Francesco turns to leave. As he's moving away:

Francesco STOPS.

McQueen has a new bumper sticker: "Ka-ciao, Francesco."

Francesco leaves. We stay with McQueen and Sally.

He drives off. Flo approaches Sally.

EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER

The racers at the starting grid. ON THE TRAFFIC LIGHT in the

center of town. It goes from RED to GREEN!

The RACERS SPEED OFF, tearing up main street and out of town,

blazing past tourists ---

EXT. WILLY'S BUTTE - DAY

As the racers, led by McQueen and Francesco, take the wide,

sweeping turn around Willy's Butte we CRANE UP to see MATER,

FINN, HOLLEY, and the Radiator Springs gang watching.

Everyone CHEERS.

Holley gets an alert.

Finn starts to back up.

They both eye Mater, expectantly.

Mater looks over at Holley. He looks touched.

He looks over to his friends who watch the race, CHEER

MCQUEEN ON.

EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - MOMENTS LATER

MATER, blazing forward fast.

He ROCKETS FORWARD, through the whole town. In doing so he

GRABS A BROKEN DOWN OTIS, hooking him ---

--- and TOSSING him right into Ramone's.

ON THE "RACE TRACK" - Mater flies past ALL the racers,

including Francesco ---

--- until he approaches MCQUEEN.

McQueen and Mater peel away from the rest of the racers, lead

them off the road and into the dirt for another lap. The two

friends are side by side when we FADE OUT.
