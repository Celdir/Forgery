INT. BLACK SCREEN

FADE IN:

INT. RECORDING STUDIO (LAST SESSION) - LA DEC 1970 - NIGHT

A dark silence hovers along the deserted, bunker-like studio.

MIKE stands and booms shadow a grand piano...

The ENGINEER waits in the booth, lit, alert man, bored,

fiddling...

Camera moving tentatively along the shadows, discovering the

sidelight on a Navy surplus pea jacket thrown on a chair;

moving to a candle's orange flutter on pages written with

verse... a hand breaking the seal of the bottle of Irish

Bushmill's whiskey.

They might drop a bit more... Camera crawling past the FINGERS

weaving a new cigarette out of the Marlboro pack. An ashtray

full of butts... and an asthmatic horrid cough, filled with

phlegm... crawling up the slight paunch in the bright jersey

with #66 on it... stitched on the sleeve is the team mascot --

an American Indian in full headdress.

Camera revealing JAMES DOUGLAS MORRISON, -- 27, poet, buried

in the shadows, curls of cigarette smoke about his haunted

sensuous eyes, meditative lips scragged with beard and long

greasy hair, not a pretty sight, yet a man full and bold and

struggling for survival through his words... beneath the

Bushmill moon, he takes the tambourine and shakes it violently

in our face

He shakes a TAMBOURINE at the mike and one of his sudden

giant Indian YELLS rock through the studio.

Music riffs from "American Prayer". AUDIENCE SOUNDS ghostly

on the track. The ENGINEER reeling backwards from the sudden

shift in sound, cursing silent.

The GRIN on Jim's face magnesium flares out to:

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY (1940'S)

The blinding YELLOWNESS of the desert, so barren, so hot it

stings to look at. An OLD CHEVROLET winds through the yellow-

orange landscape beneath a brooding blue SKY crackling with

ELECTRICITY -- the storm coming in in the distance as the

MUSIC writhes out at us like a reptile from under a rock --

the beat of RIDERS ON THE STORM.

DOORS SONG

Riders on the storm (2)

Into this house we're born

Into this world we're thrown

Like a dog without a bone

An actor out on loan

Riders on the storm

CREDITS ROLL, OVER THIS DREAMSCAPE

INT. CAR - DAY

MOM, DAD, the youngest BABY in the front seat -- pointing at

the storm.

GRANDMA & GRANDAD in the back with JIM, about 4 and his

SISTER, 3 asleep.

Mom's a beauty and Dad's an austere handsome military man in

civilian clothes, mouthing words -- look, wake them up, a

desert storm... but we barely hear

A LIGHTNING BOLT shreds the blue sky with a thunderous sound,

frightening dawn of creation...

Grandma nudging Jim awake. His eyes open --

Just as the car turns the bend -- revealing

An overturned TRUCK lying in the road -- dead and wounded

INDIANS everywhere... A cop car, ambulance. A terrible

accident...

The first thing Jim sees...

An old INDIAN FACE staring at him...

The car pulling alongside, Dad rolling his window down...

asking if he can help (SOUNDLESS) A line of wailing INDIAN

WOMEN, CHILDREN

Mom's scared face...

Grandma trying to hide Jim's face but he looks back...

THE COP WAVING THEM THROUGH

The kid looking back through the rear window, terrified --

his first view of death. The bodies, the sense of doom

overlaying the land -- a child's worst nightmare.

SONG

(continues)

There's a killer on the road

His brain is squirming like a toad

Take a long holiday

Let your children play

If you give this man a ride

Sweet family will die

There's a killer on the road

The boy's eyes going back to the Indian MAN looking at him...

then to the dying opened body bleeding out its guts on the

asphalt... the dying man's face, twisted, moaning, amazing

eyes at the point of death -- they settle on Jim

A strange SOUND occurs -- the rattle of an ancient gourd,

"shi-chi-chi, shi-chi-chi". Something flying through the

air. A bull-roarer, a whirling leather thong, announcing the

appearance of a shaman.

INTO JIM -- his eyes staring out the back His receding point

of view -- the Indians, the overturned truck...

SONG

Girl you gotta love your man (2)

Take him by the hand

Make him understand

The car pulling away across the giant 1940's landscape

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY (1963)

SUBTITLE READS: ARIZONA DESERT, 1963. CREDITS CONTINUE TO

ROLL.

Panning up the black chino pants to JIM MORRISON, now 20,

steel seaman's suitcase in hand, thumbing a ride, the road

sign behind him saying "Los angeles 370 miles"

SONG

The world on you depends

Our life will never end

Girl you gotta love your man

A LARGE LIZARD in the dust cocks its head, blinks, as the

boots walk by to the car pulling over.

INT. CAR

JIM in the backseat packed with HUSBAND, WIFE, CHILDREN,

DOG, MOTHER-IN-LAW. Between boy and man, eyes ancient and

new. He wears his favorite color: black -- torn black chinos,

paint-spotted black t-shirt, a slouch his favorite pose but

the eyes and smile can be warm and shy like a little boy,

gentle surface, storm in the brain.

The HUSBAND, now looking at Jim a little nervously, pushes

up the Perry Como on the radio... as it cuts to a sudden

news flash:

SLOW MOTION: The Husband's face distorting, saying something

on the track like: "What! God NO!" but it's subdued, low.

Trying other stations.

Jim turns to look out his window, as if he already knew.

The WIFE'S and HUSBAND'S VOICES seem lost in the background.

On Jim -- staring out the window. "Who's next!"

SONG

Riders on the storm (4)

On the DESERT.

EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - LOS ANGELES - DAY (1965)

SUBTITLE READS: VENICE, CALIFORNIA 1965

CREDITS continue to their conclusion as we segue into the

BLUENESS of VENICE, CALIFORNIA, 1965 -- the dawn of a new

age. All was possible.

Individual SHOTS of the BOARDWALK throbbing with a feast of

HIPPIES, head shops, ARTISTS drawing psychedelic murals, POT

SMOKERS, MUSCLE BUILDERS, tambourines accompanying the

transister radios on the Beach Boys and "I Got You Babe",

dogs chasing frisbees, BIKINI BODIES on the beach, LSD sold

over the counter... set to the upbeat chords of HELLO I LOVE

YOU

DOORS SONG

Hello I love you

Won't you tell me your name?

Hello I love you

Let me jump in your game

She's walking down the street

Blind to every eye she meets

Do you think you'll be the guy

To make the queen of the angels sigh?

JIM, in torn black chinos, no shirt, walking real slow past

it all, carrying a notebook of his own and a paperback of

Baudelaire, his eyes settling on...

A YOUNG BEAUTY and her yellow labrador -- a fashionable thin,

long, red-haired "20th century fox" in jeans moving through

the crowd...

He thinks about it -- a fraction of eternity -- and he's

off... after her.

EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

She moves along its banks, as if the universe moved to her

rhythm, turning once to look back. Jim caught in her eyes.

They're alone. Now he's the one seized by doubt. He slows,

pretends to take another interest.

DOORS SONG

She holds her head so high

Like a statue in the sky

Her arms are wicked

And her legs are long

When she moves

My brain screams out this song

EXT. VENICE CANAL - ANOTHER CANAL - DAY

As she turns into another street, he resumes following her.

She gets to a house, goes in. There's a group of people

partying. He stops, watches.

DOORS SONG

Sidewalk crouches at her feet

Like a dog that begs for something sweet

Do you hope to make her see you, fool?

Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

EXT. PAMELA'S HOUSE - VENICE CANAL - THAT EVENING

The two story house has a quaint run-down charm. Friends

have dropped by, people smoking joints, beers.

She's on the upstairs balcony -- talking with a YOUNG MAN

(professor type) in his 30's, who passes her a joint.

JIM lurks in the shadows of the trees; he's been standing

outside watching... The MUSIC shifts to the quieter LOVE

STREET.

DOORS SONG

She lives on Love Street

Lingers long on Love Street

She has a house and garden

I would like to see what happens

The YOUNG MAN gestures, and goes back inside the house. She's

alone now on the balcony, sitting on a kitchen table...

It's now or never. Jim scales the tree alongside the house

with the agility of a gymnast.

DOORS SONG

She has robes and she has monkeys

Lazy diamond studded flunkies

She has wisdom and knows what to do

She has me and she has you

The girl's grinding up pot in an old shoebox with a spoon

and kitchen strainer. She looks up and sees his crotch three

feet from her face, balanced there effortlessly on the railing

like a highwire act, opens her mouth in surprise.

Jim drops softly to the balcony, a smile of disarming

gentleness.

His head cocked slightly onto his left shoulder, he drawls,

southern gentleman, polite, slow, thoughtful as if he had

all the time in the world, as if the guy would never come

back.

He moves. Kisses her swiftly, softly, right on the lips.

He looks into her face. Classic American face, freckles, big

round eyes soft as rain, long sunset red hair. She feels his

intense, starving eyes. He kisses her a second time.

The YOUNG MAN coming back with the rolling paper -- sees

him.

As he hops back on the railing -- swings out into the tree --

looks back once.

A moment. She must decide. The YOUNG MAN within earshot.

The ice broken in that instant. Jim smiles.

He vanishes. The Man abreast of Pamela, as if he's seen a

vision.

INT. UCLA SCREENING ROOM - DAY (1965)

On the screen a 16mm black and white student film of a

stunning BLOND in black bra, panties, garters dancing in

black heels on top of a TV set. panning down to images of

goose-stepping Nazis and a Nuremberg rally on the set. Sounds

of lovemaking and an Indian peyote ceremony from the track,

an Indian holy man incanting... Jim's VOICE comes on the

track as well.

STUDENTS in the audience groan at the pretention of it. Moving

to JIM's eyes hidden in his parka hood, peeking through at

the screen.

A CLOSEUP now of JIM on screen looking straight into the

lens as he takes a hit on a hash pipe, and winks.

RAY MANZAREK, a tall student with powerful voice and manner,

thick glasses, long hair sweeping down over his eyes, leans

over to Jim.

The lights coming on as the last absurdist images flicker

off. Hissing and a big Bronx cheer summarize the feelings of

the 100 odd STUDENTS crammed into a bunker-like theater.

A youngish INSTRUCTOR stirs to the front row from a row of

upset FACULTY. Hands shooting up to criticize.

TRICK, BONES and JACK, three friends sitting next to Jim,

shoot their hands up.

A cacophony of voices, critics, emotions blend out over Jim's

quiet eyes.

EXT. TURKEY JOINT WEST - NIGHT

JIM, BONES, TRICK, JACK approaching the bar. MUSIC of "GLORIA"

blasting from the door, CHICKS popping in and out, definitely

college crowd circa '65.

He slows, a dramatic young lion pose, surveying the girls.

The cronies wait, anticipating something inescapably evil to

escape his lips.

INT. TURKEY JOINT WEST - NIGHT

Tall bespectacled RAY MANZAREK is banging out GLORIA on the

piano in bad Jerry Lee Lewis style.

Camera moving to reveal JOHN DENSMORE wiry, solid on the

drums... moving on to ROBBIE KRIEGER, wispy, ethereal looking,

the youngest, flamenco-type moves on his early electric

guitar. Also a HARMONICA PLAYER and a BASE. They all seem

slightly embarrassed by either the cheap sound system feedback

or Ray's warbling, but the crowd couldn't care less -- a

German beerhall, they want noise and sex.

JIM and his GANG, beers in hand, mouth back the words, beers

everywhere shoved to the smokey ceiling, everyone on their

feet, nuts with spring fever. Jim eyeing the GIRL next to

him.

The FOOTBALL TEAM TYPES edge over nearby, one of them picking

out Jim with a glare.

She looks puzzled by the suggestion.

He evades the football man's grasp, elusive physicality. He

hops over tables, heading for the stage. Other KIDS are up

on the stage dancing, but Jim goes right up alongside RAY,

shaking his hips like Elvis. Ray giving him the mike. Improv

time.

They love it. The place going wild. The girl with the football

player wanting him.

INT. RAY'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT

JIM is insane on beers in the back seat, reaching over the

wheel to try to drive the car for RAY who is flailing at

him. Jim pulling Ray's hair...

Jammed into the sedan are TRICK, BONES, ROBBIE, JOHN...

As he winds down the window and starts crawling out of the

car. Heavy traffic. Ray weaving to avoid another vehicle.

Honking horn.

His waist is out the window, John and all grabbing for his

heels.

EXT. SPEEDING CAR - NIGHT

SPECIAL EFFECT: JIM's head six inches from pavement moving

at 60 mph through heavy traffic. Screaming, laughing like a

maniac. Beeping horns all over the place.

In the car, madness, raging chaos, the four boys pulling him

in.

EXT./INT. PAMELA'S HOUSE - VENICE CANAL - THAT NIGHT

Night. Shadows. A tree. A figure moving.

JIM

(SONG)

Awake!

Shake dreams from your hair, my pretty child my sweet one

Choose the day and choose the sign of your day

The day's divinity the first thing you see

Jim slides her upstairs' door open, crawls in next to her

bed. She's asleep with her boyfriend. He touches her toe.

She awakes, startled.

EXT. VENICE CANALS - NIGHT

JIM and PAMELA moving along the byways. A clear starry

California night.

JIM

(SONG)

A vast radiant beach

And a cool jewelled moon

Couples naked, race down by its quiet side

And we laugh like soft mad children

There's a crash. They turn bristling.

A COYOTE lurks under the sickly light of a streetlamp, pulling

its head from an overstuffed garbage can, looking back at

them.

EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - NIGHT

Fires on the boardwalk. Hippies, Bums, Older People. JIM and

PAM move through talking, skipping, touching like children.

JIM

(SONG)

...smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy

The music and voices are all around us

Choose, they croon, the ancient ones

The time has come again

EXT. VENICE BEACH - NIGHT

The two of them race down by its side, slowing to a walk.

His [...] loved orphan voice.

She breaks into sobs, seeking his arms. He hugs her.

JIM

(SONG)

Choose now, they croon

Beneath the moon

Beside an ancient lake

Enter again the sweet forest

Enter the hot dream

Come with us

Everything is broken up and dances

EXT. VENICE BUILDING - NIGHT

Their silhouettes mount the fire escape of a jagged old

structure overlooking the boardwalk.

EXT. VENICE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

PAM glancing through Jim's notebooks as they sit on his

sleeping bag with a lantern and bunsen burner, overlooking

moon, ocean, scudding clouds and a vast forest of television

antennas. Fires burn from the beach.

In the notebooks, at intervals during the conversation, we

see powerful sketches colored in visionary hallucinogenic

William Blake mode with writing between. Books are everywhere --

panning Kerouac, Ginsberg, Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Mailer, Artaud,

mythological works, shamanistic books, a library of stolen

ideas.

Pam shivers, a strange thought.

He runs his fingers thru her hair, kissing her gently.

The panties coming off. Rousseau dangling from the Venice

moon. He moves a little over excited, nervous, more awkward

than we might expect.

DOORS SONG

Well the clock says it's time to close now

I guess I'd better go now...

As we depart the rooftop.

Your fingers weak with minarets

Speaking secret alphabets

I light another cigarette

Learn to forget, learn to forget, learn to forget

Possibly we hear the soft backbeat of MOONLIGHT DRIVE without

lyrics.

RAY MANZAREK is meditating in yoga posture, longer hair as

well, in his post-graduate phase, sandals, colorful hippie

shirt. But the meditation is not going well. He's shaking

his head at himself, frowning.

Jim has approached closer, amused, looking down.

Ray opening his eyes -- his POV -- Jim, slouched, jacket

over his shoulder, sun behind him.

Jim has crouched, digging his hand in the sand. As the grains

spill out of his fist he has his eyes closed.

Ray pantomimes chords in the keyboard sand. All of a sudden

we're in RAY'S POV -- a mystical moment. Jim singing, no

sound, then pure song, unadulterated by atmosphere.

Jim stops, shrugs. Ray looks at him a long beat. Intense

eyes, the manner of a man who knows what he wants and cannot

be stopped.

Jim laughs, loves Ray's ardor as they move along the ocean

side.

As they walk off, the two of them along the edge of the

Pacific. A dog jumping for a frisbee. The music of MOONLIGHT

DRIVE now riffs over the real song now.

DOORS SONG

Let's swim to the moon

Let's climb thru the tide

Penetrate the evening

That the city sleeps to hide...

INT. RAY'S HOUSE - VENICE BEACH - DAY

The first heavy strains of BREAK ON THROUGH driving over the

DISSOLVE. It sounds bad technically, but it's hot. Random

raw screams and shouting. PAM is crosslegged on the floor,

clapping to the music, number one fan.

JIM straining to make it work, jumping around violent, still

not in control. Yet searching. JOHN cutting out.

They're drained, tired, in a large rehersal/living room 30

feet high, fronted by large glass windows looking out at the

beach at Marina. The room is filled with golden, gorgeous

setting sunlight.

PAMELA goes to the kitchen with DOROTHY, Ray's Japanese

fiancee.

Robbie's voice is tinny but something immediate's in the

air, all the radar out.

John drumming it, different, more Latin.

The three excluded Doors head out to the beach like obedient

schoolboys while Ray fools with his organ.

EXT. VENICE BEACH - DAY

As they go out, JIM hugging ROBBIE's head to his shoulder as

they feel the excitement of a new song.

As they head back.

INT. RAY'S HOUSE - DAY

TIGHT on RAY like a schoolmaster cueing them.

It goes. The famous organ intro to LIGHT MY FIRE blends over

the room like magic, carrying JIM, ROBBIE, JOHN, DOROTHY,

PAMELA along over:

EXT. SUNSET STRIP (TRAVELLING) - NIGHT (1966)

A row of NIGHTCLUBS glisten off the hoods of passing traffic.

Marquees announce: THE BYRDS, RED ROOSTER, LOVE, THE HERD,

TURTLES, CAPTAIN BEEFHEART. The CLUBS are PANDORA'S BOX, THE

TRIP, CIRO'S, BIDO LITO'S, GAZZARRI'S, THE EXPERIENCE... .

Headlights and neon intercut with:

DOCUMENTARY TYPE SHOTS of TEENAGERS, HIPPIES, LONGHAIRS,

running summer rampant, banging tambourines. COPS busting

kids against cars on the street as PARENTS go by rolling up

their windows. The action was on the street. LIGHT MY FIRE

carries over the montage.

DOORS SONG

You know that it would be untrue etc.

EXT. LONDON FOG - NIGHT

"THE DOORS -- BAND FROM VENICE" on the marquee... moving

down to a motley crew of TEENAGE GIRLS, underage, trying to

get past the BOUNCER. The sounds of BREAK ON THROUGH carry

past when the doors open and close admitting a SAILOR.

INT. LONDON FOG - NIGHT

BREAK ON THROUGH blasting out at us from a sleazehole --

half full -- BIKERS, SAILORS, HOOKERS, a baseball game on

the TV. A dance floor the size of a bed, the DOORS on a tiny

platform above the bar, London newspapers on the wall.

Some groupies have formed a small fan club at the base of

the stage, muscling past PAM, but most people ignore them,

drinking, arguing, dancing to their own fuckbeats. Possibly

this has something to do with the fact that JIM sings with

his back to all of them.

JOHN looking over furious at RAY who mutters under the music.

Jim jumps around violently to the front, getting the attention

of all. Rubbing his leather pants against the mike stand,

leaning against it, not yet comfortable with the extrovert

side of himself, eyes closed, but starting to enjoy it. He

sings to Pam.

INT. BACKSTAGE - THE FOG - THAT NIGHT

JERRY, the ex-vice cop manager who runs the joint, can't

understand the appeal, talking to JIM and ROBBIE who are

packing and hauling their equipment out. DOROTHY is there.

Camera gliding across the small crowded smokey room to RAY

and JOHN in conversation with a slick Beverly Hills MANAGER

type.

He gives Ray a card, leaving, crossing to Jim and PAM talking.

Pam on payphone calling her friends to come.

The MANAGER on his way out leaning into Jim's face, slyly.

INT. LONDON FOG - NIGHT

MONTAGE EFFECT -- Jim sings "A Little Game" on the Fog stage.

Super over WHISKEY sign.

EXT. SUNSET STRIP -- THAT NIGHT

CU moving down -- the "LOVE" is on the marquee at the famous

WHISKY A GO GO as we move down to see JIM, PAM, and the DOORS.

Jim jumps through the TEEMING TRAFFIC (horns, anger) right

in front of a COP CAR, crossing to a long line of teenage

FANS dying to get into the club.

The GIRLS looking at each other like who is this jerk.

Laughter from the GIRLS.

Meanwhile DENSMORE is hitting up on GIRL 2.

Robbie is doing his imitation of a shrimp for ANOTHER GIRL

who's laughing.

A look between Jim and Caprice. Pamela pulling Jim away,

gives the girl a look.

The crowd giggles. Jim climbs a pole, yells.

On the crowd. A few raise their hands, smile.

We IRIS in on the Doors suddenly -- a strange sound -- REVERSE

IRIS on Jim -- feeling it now. The peyote.

JIM's POV -- Pam irising out. This strange sound in his ears --

a rattle of an Indian gourd, similar to what we heard in the

car in Arizona when Jim was a boy. Now a distant Indian drum

beating. The beginning strains of THE END dribble in.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

A dented RED CHEVROLET fishtails on a dry mudflat, whipping

up dustdevils.

They're all LAUGHING (strange noise) -- in a circle somewhere

on the edge of a precipice in deep arroyos and magnificent

rocks and cacti...

A football huddle of faces - RAY, JOHN, ROBBIE, JIM -- the

four DOORS... laughing with the first mad impulse of the

peyote.

PAM is vomiting her brains out as DOROTHY tries to comfort

her on the edge of a cliff... Jim panthers up the dune.

They hug. She throws up again.

Jim holds his head. Feels the ride.

JUMP CUTS: Jim and Pam are touching each other. Face. Shadows.

Sand falls from Pam's hand. Jim turns to hawk at a bird.

"Hawk! Hawk!" Then Pam is dancing alone on the dune.

Abruptly Jim is back in the circle with the Doors in a sense

torn between them and Pam. EXTREME CLOSEUPS of their faces,

their eyes, the tensions of the trip tearing apart their

teeth as they go from the laughing to the dangerous part.

John shutters -- as does Robbie and Ray. Jim seems possessed.

Pause. He has instilled a flux of fear in the group.

Jim looking at her, smiles.

Ray has his head buried in his hands.

He takes Ray and Robbie's hands, his voice calming them,

reform the circle. John hesitant. Not all will enter the

gates at evening.

Pulling John into the circle, bonding, their four heads sunk

to the desert floor, Jim making wild Indian sounds, deep-

throated "shoooh... shoooh"... now humming a song from the

desert.

The OTHERS join in his chant, the four rising and falling

like a collective breath.

Suddenly Jim breaks and rises out of the circle. Ray, Robbie,

John, all looking at him. The same need. Pamela, the

desperation of her eyes.

He goes, his boots in the sand.

Pamela calling from another dune, far away.

His POV -- of her, receding. She screams for him. He's in

pain. Cannot help her.

A BIRD of prey in the sky.

Jim moving across a lunar landscape. SPECIAL EFFECT: The sun

is black like night or else white in a black sky. Voices in

the distance. "Jim, where are you going?" A mother's voice,

a father's voice.

DOORS SONG

Can you picture what will be

So limitless and free

Desperately in need of some stranger's hand in a desperate

land

Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain and all the children are

insane: waiting for the summer rain

FLASHBACKS

INT. CAR - MOVING - DESERT

JIM, 4, in the back of a car in the desert -- looking back...

At the overturned truck, the bodies in the road... at the

older Indian looking at him... finally at the dying Indian...

his eyes.

INT. MORRISON HOME - DAY

Somewhere. The child alone. On the living room floor. Drawing

his sketches in a book. MOM's feet moving past -- then DAD'S

feet. We may sense a subtle shift in mood when the parents

come in -- from the boy's eyes which never leave the sketch

he is drawing.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

An OLD WOMAN is beckoning to him from an opening in the face

of the mountain... then she's gone.

JIM bounds towards the crevice.

INT. ROCK PALACE - DAY

He is in an isolated cathedral of rocks. The CRONE, muttering,

leaving through another crevice. Suddenly a MOUNTAIN LION is

visible, stretched hugely across a rock. It growls

ferociously, upset, and suddenly shoots out the back of the

cave. Silence.

Jim, thunderstruck, gaping. A gallery of ancient INDIAN

PETROGLYPHS surround him on all sides. Curious, oblong

figures, buffalo, sacred deer and bear, creatures of the

hunt; hunters and their weapons, rain clouds, masked deities

proclaiming the answers to the Mysteries, the story of

Creation.

Camera weaving up to see one of the faces of the deities --

staring at him from the wall -- an eagle's face...

DOORS SONG

There's danger on the edge of town

Ride the King's highway

Weird scenes inside the gold mine

Ride the King's highway west, baby

The sound of a rattle -- "shichishichi" -- he realizes he's

being watched. By what? He whips his eyes everywhere. A large

LIZARD perches on a boulder assesses him calmly, tatters of

a former skin clinging to its throat, spits a forked tongue

and drills its black pearly eyes into his skull... Now the

sound of the Bull-Roarer, whipping the air, announcing the

appearance of the shaman.

Jim's struck with an overwhelming sense of... awe... ancient

mysteries. He turns. The lizard is looking at him.

The GHOST of the DEAD INDIAN is also looking at him. We are

looking at JIM from its point of view -- a blur of light,

some headdress, a sense of skins... music drops back, no

lyrics... the voice is old, familiar, possible Spanish descent

dialect or huararchi.

The voice, the pretense, -- the glow too quickly fades --

leaving Jim so alone, not sure what he has heard, yet he

knows he has heard, and he knows he has seen -- and once you

have seen, it will never be the same again. His eyes.

EXT. CAVE - DAY

JIM exits the cave.

INT. WHISKY A GO GO - NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSE on JIM'S EYES as he continues with THE END.

DOORS SONG

Ride the snake

Ride the snake, to the lake

The ancient lake

The snake is long, seven miles

Ride the snake

He's old, and his skin is cold

Camera pulling out from his eyes. There's something different

tonight. Something in the air. His eyes are open, he's facing

outward, gripping the mike for his life, hair falling in his

face, dripping sweat, we sense all his soul concentrated in

what he has to say.

Cliques of GROUPIES have staked claims at the foot of the

stage, eyes fucking him as he writhes, spreading his legs.

Every twitch, every moment he sucks out the tension on the

musical interludes generates a whip of a reaction in his

audience.

Nobody is moving in the club. The DANCERS are still, the GO

GO GIRLS in their white plastic boots and dresses hang

motionless in their gilded cages. Even the WAITRESSES have

stopped, frozen with their trays, denying something is going

to happen.

PAMELA, DOROTHY... JERRY from the Fog, also the manager of

this place, watches from the balcony, shaking his head,

doesn't understand. Panning to two RECORD TYPES with him --

JAC HOLZMAN, distinguished six footer, suit, and PAUL

ROTHCHILD, funky, pigtailed, ex-con, early 30s.

The band has come together fully now. ROBBIE'S fingers sliding

across the trembling strings, staring at the ceiling,

wandering around the darkened portions of stage left, he

feels Jim -- echoes him back with his flamenco-blues guitar.

JOHN on drums, reading Jim's moods, throws in the spontaneous

and violent riffs that keep it savage. He literally tortures

Jim's ears with his drums.

And RAY, concentrated with his nodding head like a big

flamingo over his keyboard, mixing it up, throwing curves,

yet also -- and more delicately -- torturing Jim with the

messianic organ sounds that shriek in his ears. There is

something of Merlin in Ray -- the alchemist knowing how to

play Jim.

And JIM -- "that sneaky silent lithe flowing flexing animal" --

ready at last to share both his body and his soul with the

world, to live out the words of the Indian prophet... to

lead.

Ray looks over up from his board, catches Robby with a 'what's

this?' look... They go with it, improvising...

Jim clutching the mike tighter, seeking solace in its arms;

it all hangs in the air as if he doesn't have any idea what

he's going to say next.

Pamela sensing something is coming... the AUDIENCE... Jerry...

the go-go dancers...

FLASH -- A FATHER'S FACE, any face, older, any man...

FLASH -- A MOTHER'S FACE, any face, older, a woman

The SCREAMS primal, pure Jim -- Indian savagery ripped from

the depths of his soul, of his pain -- bouncing off the

walls...

As the AUDIENCE gasps, shocked, stunned...

As the guitar hits a high, horrid reverb, JIM in slightly

SLOW MOTION suddenly tightens his backbone as if electrocuted

and shoots violently backwards, hitting the floor like a

puppet cut from his string -- we sense Jim himself has crossed

a barrier now, gone into yet another stage of his performance,

a stage from which he can never return. Like the gunfighter

who has killed his first man.

RAY sees it instantly where it's going, hits the organ! Robbie

and John follow. the instruments EXPLODE all at once trying

to bury Jim in his primal unmistakeable scream.

The CLUB in shock. Tribal taboo broken in one instant. Jerry

exploding off the balcony toward the stage...

Pamela, extremely moved and impressed, and Dorothy... the go-

go girls, as jaded as they come, are stunned tension... the

groupies love it.

Jim has jumped up now, dancing an Indian war dance around

the mike.

INT. BACKSTAGE WHISKY HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT

JIM is being muscled out the door by JERRY, livid.

Jerry pinning Jim to the wall,

Lost in the melee, RAY and JOHN springing Jim back from likely

death

Pushing, shoving, scrambling. Past a long-haired JOURNALIST

yelling into a payphone.

As they rumble by him, all yelling at once. Into the street.

EXT. ALLEY & STAIRCASE OUTSIDE WHISKY - THAT NIGHT

The DOORS go sailing out, followed by one of their drums,

JOHN and ROBBIE restraining Jim from going back in.

Wanting to come after Jim but restrained now by the RECORD

MOGULS, HOLZMAN and ROTHCHILD.

JAC HOLZMAN pushing past to Ray. Pamela separating Jim

visually from Jerry.

Holzman pauses, a dramatic presence, six foot two, impeccably

dressed, he knows the weight of his words.

It hangs there. Impossible words.

John and Robbie sharing looks.

Strains of LIGHT MY FIRE cross the cut.

INT. SUNSET SOUND RECORDING STUDIO - DAY (1966)

Four-track TAPE SYSTEM is rolling.

DOORS SONG

You know that it would be untrue

You know that I would be a liar

If I was to say to you

Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Camera moving fast thru the control room, past the ENGINEER

(BRUCE BOTNICK), taciturn, 20's, the PRODUCER (PAUL ROTHCHILD)

in pig heaven, and the owner JAC HOLZMAN in his blue suit

watching.

Camera moving fast past a smiling PAM watching, out to the

DOORS on the floor, jamming... on to JIM in the vocal booth,

headphone to his ears.

The song, now fully -- orchestrated, rolling on over the

following MONTAGE:

EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - SAN FRANCISCO (DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE) -

DAY (1967)

LIGHT MY FIRE continues.

DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE of the "Human Be-In", the "Summer of

Love" -- swarming FLOWER CHILDREN, WAR PROTESTORS.

A staged 16mm. grainy shot of JIM and PAMELA, RAY and DOROTHY,

JOHN, ROBBIE and their TWO NEW GIRLFRIENDS wandering thru

the CROWD sharing the spirit. Pam and Jim fool around --

laughing -- tickling each other for the home movie camera

shot by Ray... Pam is goofy, makes funny faces, teases him

running a flower under his nose, thru his hair, then trips

him. He chases her across the lawn.

INT. FILLMORE WEST STAGE - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT (1967)

The CROWD is "beautiful" -- candles, incense sticks, flowers,

vibes of peace and love. The instrumental of "Light My Fire"

is playing, but only three DOORS are on stage till Jim comes

swinging across on a rope like tarzan all the way across the

stage -- then drops down, rebounds lithely and hits the mike.

JIM swandives into the stoned crowd with the mike at the

instrumental section, a colored spotlight flecking him, GIRLS

kiss him. The guys want to be him, the girls want him -- and

he knows it, teasing and tantalizing them...

BODYGUARDS running in to pull him out as he's tossed, like a

limp god, over the heads of the crowd, rolling like a buoy

on a rocking sea, from hand to hand, Dionysus, devoured limb

from limb by the "little girls".

PAMELA watching from the side curtain.

ALABAMA SONG (WHISKY BAR) now kicks in with its comic,

Brechtian strain as we:

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - DAY

Screaming FANS chase the DOORS to a commercial airplane,

scribbling autographs. One of the GIRLS smacking JIM on the

lips as he laughs, her cameras clicking. PAMELA shooting a

home movie of it, pushed aside by the crowd, rescued by ROBBIE

and the new young manager, BILL SIDDONS...

DOORS SONG

Oh show me the way to the next whisky bar

Oh don't ask why

Oh don't ask why

EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE (SEEN FROM PLANE) - DAY

The City as seen by:

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

JIM'S face pressed to the window, PAMELA next to him hugging

each other.

DOORS SONG

For if we don't find the next whisky bar

I tell you we must die

I tell you

I tell you

I tell you we must die

EXT. CBS - NEW YORK - NIGHT (SUMMER, 1967)

A LIMOUSINE pulling up in front of the Ed Sullivan Marquee.

The sidewalk is mobbed with FANS, mostly YOUNG GIRLS.

DOORS SONG

Oh moon of Alabama

We now must say goodbye

We've lost our good ol mama

We must have whiskey oh you know why

INT. LIMO - NIGHT

JIM looking out at the MOB with the other DOORS and PAMELA.

The look on his face is ironic.

His POV -- the YOUNG GIRLS' FACES, arms grasping at the

windows like tentacles of a poisonous hydra, their faces

deformed by SILENT SCREAMS (we hear faint strangled shrieks

below the song)... POLICE and SECURITY pressing them back,

linking arms to clear a path for the Doors.

DOORS SONG

Show me the way to the next little girl

Oh don't ask why

Oh don't ask why

The GIRLS crying hysterically as Jim lazily, leopardly, moves

across the CROWD, almost like Oswald waiting for the Ruby

bullet but with that sweet, pleasant smile on his face, dark

glasses concealing...

Their voices distorting. A GIRLCHILD squeezing thru the cordon

with the fatal bullet. In slightly SLOW MOTION, Jim seeing

her come... as she glues herself hip to hip, lip to lip with

Jim, her hands clawing at his leather pants. It takes TWO

COPS to peel her off. Pamela furious. Jim is gracious with

everyone, signs patiently, talks, kisses, shakes hands with

the boys, lets them touch his hair, his body, poses for a

picture, seems to like it.

DOORS SONG

For if we don't find the next little girl

I tell you we must die

I tell you

I tell you

I tell you we must die

INT. CBS BACKSTAGE - THAT EVENING

The nervous PRODUCER, HERB, leading "MR. SULLIVAN" thru the

corridor to the Doors' DRESSING ROOM past several "ACTS"

getting ready to go on... animals, tumblers, a soprano

wailing...

INT. DOORS DRESSING ROOM - EVENING

Bedlam. MAKE-UP ARTISTS pancaking the faces of the DOORS --

the nightmare coming true. RAY in a white suit with too many

pinstripes. ROBBIE a spearmint turtleneck, beads, long

sideburns, JOHN in red velveteen head to foot with a tie-dye

splotch on the front of it. Their hair's being violated enough

by a nervous gay black HAIR DESIGNER to make them totally

self-conscious and nervous about their first live TV

appearance -- all except JIM who remains in his signature

black leather with the silver navajo belt and shiny spangles --

watching a portable TV... A GIRL leaving his side, crossing

Pamela. Eye contact between them speaks of Pamela's jealousy.

TELEVISION INSERT -- images of DETROIT burning, summer of

67.

On JIM, as they pancake him, reflective.

Commotion from the doorway as the PRODUCER leads the lock-

jawed MR. SULLIVAN in with everyone bowing and scraping to

the Pope.

Mr. Sullivan waves from the doorway.

A look from the guys. Jim sullen. Tension in the air. Mr.

Sullivan waiting.

Pause. The producer puzzled a beat. It doesn't go down.

Sullivan exiting, waving at no one in particular like Nixon

would.

SIDDONS reassuring the Producer.

Pause.

Ray's seething tension. Younger brother starting to get out

of hand.

INT. STUDIO STAGE - THAT NIGHT

SULLIVAN stiffly introducing them.

The lights come up on the DOORS in their ultimate nightmare --

each Door appearing consecutively in a lightspot as Jim sings

the ubiquitous "Light My Fire", trapped in this Elvis Presley --

Vegas act, he looks like he couldn't care less. DOORS hang

suspended everywhere on the set -- their name spelled out in

big block standup letters.

Jim has a hard-on in his pants, barely concealed by his tight

leathers.

Jim misses his marks deliberately, the camera having a hard

time following him.

INT. CONTROL BOOTH (SIMULTANEOUS) - THAT NIGHT

The PRODUCERS freaking out.

Jim on the monitors, singing through to his freedom, falls

on the floor flat, the camera missing him completely.

INT. HOTEL BEDROOM -- NEW YORK - NIGHT

OVERHEAD ANGLE -- JIM lies there in a sweat. PAMELA pulls

off him, naked, frustrated, trying to rouse him.

Jim, quietly pissed, reaches for the whiskey bottle at the

side of the bed.

She tries to take the bottle away. He resists. They struggle.

It becomes a fight.

He grabs her. They lurch, smashing the lamp. WILD CHILD song

kicking in.

Camera running at them from the end of the room. JIM laughs

manically as they roll off the bed into a wall. Kicking,

hitting hard.

DOORS SONG

Wild Child full of grace

Savior of the human race

Your cool face

Natural child, terrible child

Not your mother or your father's child

Your own child, screaming wild

A VOICE across the wall joining in, banging.

More nagging. By this time the fight has expired of its own

volition.

They giggle, start to laugh. Then they cuddle on the floor,

in the corner, in this semi-lit New York hotel room.

He's hard now. She's guiding him inside her.

INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - HOTEL SUITE NEW YORK - DAY

Camera moving in past the buffet, champagne, flowers in the

hotel suite overlooking CENTRAL PARK... to the DOORS in

armchairs surrounded by an informal group of a DOZEN

JOURNALISTS and PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS... JIM behind dark shades

drinking long Hawaiian fruit punches, decked out in snakeskin.

TIME DISSOLVES over the questions and answers. A vaguely

dreamy quality.

Gentle laughter. The JOURNALISTS don't get it... panning

their looks. The backbeat of CRYSTAL SHIP, dreamy hazy, Warhol-

like interview floating over the room like a giant mushroom

cloud.

On Jim -- a beat. A sickly smile spreads.

Holding up a copy of "The Lords and New Creatures".

Jim motions him over, whispers something at SIDDONS who goes

to fetch a pair of scissors.

SIDDONS comes back in, hands Jim a pair of scissors.

DOUBLE IMAGES on the DISSOLVES.

He cuts his hair with the scissors. A commotion.

They're amazed. The point is made however -- visibly. The

anger in his action is so extreme yet so contained -- the

cynosure of all eyes as always. Eyes shooting back at

JOURNALIST 3... JOURNALIST 4 cuts in from the back of the

room altering the mood.

Laughter. JOURNALIST 4 with dark hair and demeanor, gypsy-

like jewelry on her arm and avant garde clothing, large

glasses, is probably a rock magazine writer but seems to

like Jim and his work.

Flashbulbs hitting his face at that moment.

Jim puts the scissors down, going to a low mysterious voice.

He puts the room in a hush. He has mesmerized them and they're

not sure whether to believe it or not.

Jim rises, staggers slightly as he makes his way to the bar

on the way out of the room, smiles right at her, ignoring

everybody else in the room.

He goes. The room in silence, embarrassed, nervous titters

looking at Journalist 4 who flushes deeply as we cut to:

INT. PATRICIA'S SOHO LOFT - THAT DAY (RAIN)

Rain, rain, rain... pelting the large windows as we glide to

JIM fucking JOURNALIST 4 (PATRICIA KENNEALY) madly in the

twisted sheets...

He gives up, exhausted. The SONG CRYSTAL SHIP backbeats the

scene...

He wanders around her place. Her place is crammed with books

and intellectualabilia, skulls, candles, globes of the world,

plants. She puts her glasses back on.

As she goes to a bowl of cocaine, laid alongside a bottle of

champagne and a basketful of items all catered by Jim. He's

at her bookcase, thumbing through an ancient manuscript.

INSERT -- the DRAWINGS in the book pertain to Witchcraft.

Ironic of course when you look at her long dark locks and

demeanor. She looks back at him, challenging.

JIM reappraising her. Her eye contact is very direct.

Jim waits. Something in the feeling of the room has shifted.

The sound of her razor chopping coke. He snorts -- the first

time.

Jim is down on his knees crawling around her. She is crawling

back.

Patricia laughs.

PATRICIA drawing blood from her arm -- wipes it on his mouth.

Some of it spills out, tamping the white powder with red

stains. Jim watching enthralled, coked out. She hands him

the jewelled Moroccan dagger.

He extends his arm. The look between them. He closes his

eyes like a little boy. She makes the cut.

DOORS SONG

Before you slip into unconsciousness

I'd like to have another kiss

Another flashing chance at bliss

Another kiss, another kiss

Candles, incense burn. As Jim and Patricia dance in the loft

naked to music, drinking champagne.

JUMP CUT: He is chasing her with one of her goat horns between

his legs. They wrestle, yell, lusty bacchanale.

They're fucking madly on the wooden floor of the loft, bathed

in blood and white powder all over the place, rain pelting

the windows, thunder, Orff's "Carmina Burana" cutting in

over the Doors' song.

In slightly ape-like SLOW MOTION, he's wildly thrusting at

her like a stallion, then reaches down, yanks out her

diaphragm -- holds it to her eyes briefly and throws it across

the room into the fireplace.

Incants him to climax with CELTIC WORDS.

Jim is wild, reaching for the Moroccan dagger, holding it to

her face as he continues to pump.

DOORS SONG

The crystal ship is being filled

A thousand girls, a thousand thrills

A million ways to spend your time

When we get back I'll drop a line

The camera shooting up to the ceiling in a tilting dutch

angle as the world comes unglued. Jim yelling with release.

INT. PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO - NEW YORK - ANOTHER DAY

GLORIA STAVERS, beautiful 30ish ex-Vogue model shooting Jim

for her layout. It's not going well. He's resisting, the

attitude negative to be photographed, compounded by the acid

it seems he's on.

JUMP CUTS -- photos going off... JIM starting to pout

narcistically, Jagger-like, for camera -- a bare-chested

pose, long lion's mane of hair streaming down to his

shoulders. She's shooting rapidly talking him thru the trip.

Her sentences falling on separate cuts of Jim. As we hear

the backbeat of PEOPLE ARE STRANGE.

He resists, he goes with it, push pull, prowling her loft on

the acid, a bottle of cognac in one hand -- changing from

shot to shot like a chameleon, free, wild, vicious, obscene.

A weird dance ensuing between them -- teasing, enticing. He

runs away, writhes along her wall, being photographed inch

by moving inch. He crawls to her. She gets down with him on

the floor, straddling him, photographing. Then he straddles

her as she shoots him from her back. They kiss, flirting. He

growls like an animal... dives into her closet... tearing

open the doors, flinging away hanging clothes, he finds her

white fur coat and puts it on... JUMP CUT -- him as he moves

to her full-length MIRROR, contorting himself. She slides up

behind him.

A pause. She wants him. No longer so cool.

Our camera dwells on Jim in the mirror, closer, closer --

the image and the reality, which is which anymore -- where

does it end?

The Great Jim Morrison, The Shaman, then Pamela, Patricia,

Gloria, a series of women who face after face fill the ancient

gallery, interchangeable masks as PEOPLE ARE STRANGE climaxes

and JIM's face SPINS OUT OPTICALLY TO:

DOORS SONG

People are strange when you're a stranger

Faces look ugly when you're alone

Women seem wicked when you're unwanted

Streets are uneven when you're down

LIMBO - MAGAZINE COVERS

JIM'S FACE on a series of MAGAZINES twirling -- "SIXTEEN",

"GLAMOUR", ROCK MAGAZINES, etc. flowering out into:

INT. DOWNTOWN LOFT - NEW YORK - NIGHT (WINTER)

Style vampires drink and grope and drug and dance under the

staccato blips of strobe lights. Artists and intellectuals,

groupies and debutantes, everyone on display, as contrived

and replicated as one of the Warhol prints of Elvis or Marilyn

and Mao on the walls...

FISHEYE POVS -- hearkening back to the acid trip -- as JIM

wanders through the dream, drinking, smoking, swallowing

pills. PEOPLE look at him, talk to him (AD LIBS) but drugs

distort everything and their voices are foreign, incoherent

and they disappear. "PEOPLE ARE STRANGE" continuing:

DOORS SONG

When you're strange

Faces come out of the rain

When you're strange

No one remembers your name

When you're strange

When you're strange

When you're strange

INT. ROOM - LIMBO

Jim peering into a room somewhere -- one of Warhol's FILMS

is playing on a wall -- a man sleeping, eating...

A GLIMPSE OF VIETNAM WAR FOOTAGE on a TV monitor -- B-52s

dropping bombs.

A fat little PR MAN grabbing Jim's arm, leaning in, distorted.

PAMELA is suddenly there, laughing, nuttily introducing a

handsome strapping TOM BAKER, a charismatic actor, and a

COUNT, suave, urbane, on heroin. Her voice lost in the jabber --

their names sound as if they're in a bottom of a tank. PAMELA

seems so impressed with the high life of New York.

PR guy stays there, introduces himself to the count.

Tom is obviously a major druggie. A popper -- joint trade-

off going off.

RAY's face leaning in distorted.

JOHN DENSMORE appearing with a wasted looking ROBBIE who is

giggling, high, and with a NEW GIRLFRIEND in tow.

The PR MAN is still next to Jim, jumping up and down excitedly

waving across the room at nothing in particular. As the

PHOTOGRAPHERS try to get Jim and the Doors in a photo

opportunity.

A wasted, emaciated Edie Sedgewick type floats into Jim's

fractured POV -- introducing a MAN with a crew cut and silk

suit.

Tom Baker brings a tall, incredible looking BLONDE in black

leather towards him.

They stare at each other like two cats. Eye level stares

that go on and on. She finally hisses in a German accent.

A voice to kill, looks to undress, fully as tall as Jim.

As she floats away.

Lynne is there, pretty, nods to Jim.

Jim's eyes briefly on -- Pamela giggling with the French

Count, putting her hand on his arm as she laughs. Innocent,

nothing meant but a moment...

A moment, strange. Slightly SLOW MOTION. Ray tapping Jim's

shoulder goodbye... Robbie and John's faces passing on. As

if they're parting -- in a symbolic way. Jim blinking in the

same SLOW MOTION, looking. Nico is gone -- but Tom is there,

across the room, waving.

The INDIAN SHAMAN looks like he's standing there in a corner.

Jim, ripped, heads for him, but the PR WOMAN cuts him off.

Jim forgets he saw the Indian.

Past more faces. The Music has subtly shifted to STRANGE

DAYS somewhere along the way.

DOORS SONG

Strange days have found us

Strange days have tracked us down

They're going to destroy

Our casual joys

We shall go on playing or find a new town

Past a cache of QUEENS in white leather ogling Jim, one of

them coming over boldly, chatting him up (AD LIB dimly heard),

them grabbing his crotch and kissing him. Jim rearing back,

laughing but wary. Past the RICH LADIES dripping with jewels

and faces peeled from Brazilian sleep tanks and Swiss knives.

Past a YOUNG MAN dressed in Jim Morrison leather pants with

his hair and eye make-up, a warped image of Jim, smiling

back at him.

INT. BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT

A quieter room, drugged out, the PR GUY cheerily leading

JIM, stepping over SLEEPING BODIES, over fur coats strewn

across the floor... to a MAN with white hair like a circus

clown, his back to us, talking with some black-tied EUROPEAN

ARISTOCRATS looking so cool.

ANDY turning at the interruption. He looks like a chic voodoo

doll. Holding an incongruous gold telephone in his arms like

a teddy bear.

Slightly SLOW MO as Warhol's black empty eyes confront Jim --

a pit of nothingness in them, amnesia, death. In Jim's SLOW

MOTION reaction we read what he sees. Andy going on with his

story, to the group that includes TOM BAKER.

Andy is looking at Jim. Jim at Andy.

They laugh. Andy's eyes hidden, face as white as styrofoam.

Andy shows his eyes, gives Jim the gold telephone he's

carrying.

Vanishes, waving to somebody else. Jim holding the phone.

DOORS SONG

Strange days have found us

And through their strange hours

We linger alone

Nico reappears waving at him to come quickly.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT (WINTER)

SNOW on the streets... a group of DRUGGIES staggering in the

snowbanks, throwing snowballs, stupid giggling, wheezing

puffs of cold air...

Jim throws the golden telephone into the trash and pees on

it.

IRIS SHOTS continue -- PAMELA laughing battily with TOM BAKER

who's putting the make on her... The COUNT is on heroin.

JIM passing a vodka bottle back and forth with NICO hitting

a stash of ups. They fall in the snow, mad Russian winter.

DOORS SONG

Bodies confused

Memories misused

As we run from the day

To a strange night of stone

(SONG REPEATS OVER)

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR (REGENCY) - THAT NIGHT

BLACK & WHITE IRIS SHOTS continue -- imagistic,

disassociative.

A LONG CORRIDOR -- COUPLE staggering down the red carpets,

champagne bottles in hand. The COUNT gets lost.

PAM laughing -- suddenly alone, notices, goes looking for

Jim... floating down this endless corridor with white doors

and red carpet.

INT. ELEVATOR

NICO stripping... a superb body... riding the floors...

Jim taking an amyl nitrate with her... laughing... Nico with

that crazed German laugh... PAMELA pushing the elevator

buttons wildly...

The elevator opening on her. From Pamela's POV -- Nico down

on her knees, her blonde head buried in Jim's leather pants...

Jim pinned against the back wall, smiling dopically, eyes

barely registering Pam... who screams loud and long, hiding

his eyes... not wanting to know... The images faster and

more fragmented: Pam beating at Jim wildly. He's laughing.

Nico's laughing. The Aristocrats in the hallway are laughing.

The world is laughing with its madness.

DOORS SONG

Strange days have found us

Strange days have tracked us down

INT. NEW HAVEN CONCERT HALL - NIGHT (1967)

An eager rowdy CROWD chants DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! to a

stage without the Doors. TECHIES are moving amplifiers,

running sound checks, stalling time, the MANAGER SIDDONS

gauging the crowd, nervous. RICH GIRLS and LOCAL HONCHOS

have backstage passes. COPS crawling over the stage, the

PROMOTER of the concert trying to get the crowds attention.

INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT

The SOUNDS of the CROWD pound thru the hallway. CAMERA

following JIM reading a magazine article, accompanied by

PATRICIA KENNEALY -- past the TECHIES, turning to look --

they go into empty SHOWER ROOM.

INT. SHOWER ROOM - SAME NIGHT

The Crowd NOISE still carries, echoing. JIM leads PATRICIA

to a quiet, isolated stall where they can be alone. Tapping

the magazine, sincerely moved by what he reads.

Jim -- a look, struck.

Fingering his pants, her hand slips inside. Teasing,

dominating him. Her dark side radiant.

Jim describes a small space between thumb and forefinger.

Jim makes a little larger space.

His look is right at her. Silence. Patricia knows he won't

talk. Through the pause we hear the crowd chanting, bigger

and bigger -- "MORRISON MORRISON MORRISON!" She's excited,

wanting to make love here, now. He's cooled out, however.

Jim shakes his head, weary. Suddenly he's scared inside.

Jim's ironic eyes, to the ceiling. Laden with a power to

which he has married himself yet brave, resisting as she

pulls his zipper down and goes to her knees in front of him.

Shaking his head.

A beefy COP stands there looking at them,

THE COP has no patience, grabs JIM by the arm and pulls. JIM

shoves him off. THE COP pushes back. A shoving match.

The cop whips out a black can from his belt, sprays Jim.

Patricia screaming at the COP grabs JIM, propelling him

violently out the stall of the bathroom.

INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT

SIDDONS and RAY running up with ROADIES and OTHERS.

COP 2 comes up.

JIM guided back into the shower stall by his entourage, eyes

blind as Oedipus, starts to laugh. A black Irish laugh.

Ray looking on PATRICIA in the hallway. A beat, senses what

happened.

A precise military Drum Beat hits as we launch into "The

Unknown Soldier".

DOORS SONG

...Hup two -- three -- four...

COMPANY HALT!

INT. NEW HAVEN STAGE - THAT NIGHT

THE DOORS on stage, JIM - eyes masked, facing death at a

mock execution, in full black leather armor.

DOORS SONG

Present arms!...

The famous drum roll, tension building. Sudden sound of

guitar. Jim crumples to the ground. Blood shooting from his

mouth.

The audience is enrapt. Jim suddenly jumps up, looses the

blood curdling scream of an aroused demon and the band bangs

into Willie Dixon's BACK DOOR MAN.

The FANS go wild, to the farthest reaches of the arena, as

he grabs his crotch and shakes it at them. INSTAMATICS

flashing rapidly as the KIDS press forward at Jim fondling

the mike stand, sliding up and down its smooth shaft.

Joints sail onto the stage at his feet, ready to be smoked.

A TEENAGE BOY & GIRL make a break thru the cordon of COPS at

the front of the stage, heading for Jim. The Cops chase them

down mid-stage, and wrestle them back to the edge -- throwing

them back into the audience.

Danger fills the air, electric. Jim strutting, Indian like,

up to one of the Cops, whipping off his hat and flipping it

to the Crowd, which roars with approval. A couple Cops looking

at Jim, sensing they're being challenged but not sure how.

They shuffle and look offstage for direction. Their apparent

impotence brings redoubled jeering from the Kids.

RAY, next to his stick of incense on the organ, shares a

look with JOHN as they head into the instrumental break in

the song. There's something different about Jim -- more

demonic, more driven -- a spirit has taken him over.

RAY'S POV -- JIM catching his look, but no recognition in

those eyes. They're dark pools, like Warhol's eyes. He turns

away, taking the mike and off the cuff rapping

improvisationally with the backbeat, keeping poetic meter.

The CROWD yells in acknowledgement, one stoned TEENAGER naked

from the waist up and ripped on beer, yelling out.

Jim ignores it, sits on the stage, lights a cigarette. Long

pause, tension building. Their catcalls for "Light My Fire"

die out as Jim faces them down. They wait... not knowing

what happens next.

The AUDIENCE laughing, the band continuing to play, John

adding emphasis to Jim's words with various shots and rolls.

Camera moving over the crowd picking out the KIDS, sensing

the anarchy dormant in their faces.

More COPS turning to face Jim from front stage, getting the

point now. RAY sees it coming...

The AUDIENCE has now grown deadly silent. Nearly every cop

is facing JIM as he uses his dumb Southerner voice. RAY's

eyes warning JIM.

The LIGHTS coming on suddenly, the AUDIENCE seething. Shouts

of "Fuck em! Right on!"

CROWD roars. A POLICE LIEUTENANT in his 50's, grey hair,

beefy, marches out onto the stage, standing next to Jim,

arms akimbo. A SECOND COP joins him.

Ray rolling the music out into a silence as Jim sticks the

mike in the officer's face, defiantly.

More cops come out, snatch the microphone, as Jim flashes

the audience a "touchy aren't they?" shrug.

TWO more COPS moving on Jim, pinning both his arms and

dragging him off stage.

RAY moving to intercede with SIDDONS and ROADIES.

Ray and Siddons are pushed aside by other cops. The crowd is

going nuts. Chairs are thrown. Kids rushing onto the stage

where the Cops beat them back.

ANNE is writing it all down on her notepad. A certain

satisfaction and joy at the unfolding of this event.

INT. BACKSTAGE STAIRCASE - SAME NIGHT

JIM is dragged roughly down a flight of stairs.

EXT. ARENA PARKING LOT - SAME NIGHT

JIM is wrestled across the lot, pinned to the car and

handcuffed, punched and thrown into the car, yelling.

Journalists try to intercede, one is also arrested.

INT. HOLDING ROOM - POLICE STATION - THAT NIGHT

JIM is spreadeagled against the wall, a dignified, defiant

look on his face.

As Jim defiantly does so, Cop 2 looses a big cloud of roach

powder into his long hair.

All during this, snickering laughter from the onlooking half-

dozen POLICE OFFICERS gathered to watch. Jim waits, then

with great claim, in a quiet voice:

As he's smacked by COP 2, sending him sprawling into the

wall...

EXT. POLICE STATION - THAT NIGHT

A SNOWBALL smashes against the glass. COPS coming out with

sticks.

A RIOT brewing. A HUNDRED TEENAGERS sallying back and forth

on the sidewalk, taunting the cops. A dozen of them have

already been arrested.

COPS chase the KIDS with sticks. But just as it looks like

it's going to get out of hand, JIM appears at the doors of

the station, stepping out between RAY and the DOORS and

SIDDONS. He signals his freedom, arms in the air.

Jim waves, does a small pained victory jig in front of the

thwarted Gestapo, ribcage and spleen hurting.

Robbie's look tells us he thinks Ray is as much caught up in

his dreams as Jim.

FLASHBULBS hits us full frame as:

INT. MUG SHOT - LIMBO

A reminder of the reality as the thud of a clanking gate

shuts. MORRISON's profile, disheveled hair -- he glares

angrily.

FLASH!

FRONTAL SHOT, slated Police Dept -- New Haven Conn -- 23750 --

12-10-67. A sullen handsome portrait.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - (LAST SESSION) - LOS ANGELES NIGHT

(1970)

JIM drinks... an ugly cough. Silence. In this puffy wrack

and ruin there is still the ironic tones and sweet delight

of the boy amazed and amused by it all. We hear the ghostly

CROWD still cheering.

The ENGINEER looking at him puzzled. Has Jim lost it? MIKE,

his friend, is there in the Engineer's booth, with the Door's

SECRETARY, Leticia, and an elegant MYSTERY WOMAN. They're

smoking dope, partying.

The violent backbeat of THE WASP now picking up.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAWN (1968)

JIM walks the dawn streets. Classic image -- jeans, boots,

jacket, the sun starting to rise on the smog and translucent

pink light along Santa Monica Boulevard outside the cheap

Alta Cienega Motel where he lives... PEACE FROG shoots us

through.

DOORS SONG

Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven

Blood stains the roofs and palm trees of Venice

Blood in my love in the terrible summer

The bloody red sun of phantastic L.A.

Over the SONG, a MONTAGE of the 60's passing to its darker

DOORS SONG

Blood is the rose of mysterious union!

There's blood in the streets & it's up to my knees

She came

Blood in the streets of Chicago

She came

Blood on the rise and it's following me

Just about the break of day (etc)

The river runs red down the legs of the city

She came

The women are crying red rivers of weeping

The MONTAGE collides into an ECU on JIM -- drinking as if to

silence the images, the sounds we hear and see on his face.

Spirits crying for release. In alcoholic solace. He passes

out, head hitting the bar.

Jim's English friend, MIKE, walks in, throwing a harsh shaft

of LA morning light across the dark bar and JIM's face, bleary

eyed, passed out on the counter. He has a drinking paunch.

With him are TOM BAKER, "TOM", the actor from the Warhol

scene in New York and a huge biker type drinker named DOG,

one of Jim's roadmen, a beard fanning his chest, tattoos

everywhere. In the front of these three monoliths are about

twenty beer bottles, numerous Jack Daniels bottles emptied

and a lesbian BARTENDRESS pouring up a breakfast shot of

bloody Marys... Mike hands Dog a breakfast in a brown paper

bag.

Delores pouring the bloody mary. As Mike scoffs at Jim passed

out.

DOG reaching in, dragging Jim's face up by the hair. Sticks

Mike's greasy eggs and bacon in front of Jim.

Jim is suddenly alert -- an instant and surprising

transformation, without hangover, eager eyed.

As he pisses on the floor next to the bar stool.

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - SAME MORNING

JIM, loose, wanders right into the traffic, waving to anybody,

trying to hitch a ride. DOG and the OTHERS going after him.

Jim seen slipping a tablet from his pocket into his mouth.

TOM catching up to him.

Moving through traffic. Horns honking, incessant insanity.

EXT. PACIFIC PALISADES - SAME MORNING

RAY and DOROTHY take their vows in front of a HIPPIE PRIEST.

ROBBIE and JOHN and their WIVES-TO-BE, and OTHERS from the

BAND look on.

PAMELA is all decked out in her best, wedding clothes, red

satins from Morocco, five-inch clog heels, flowers in her

hair. Looking around pissed as:

JIM slinks up through the trees, alone, quiet, changing faces

to face them as SUMMER'S ALMOST GONE plays sinuously.

DOORS SONG

Summer's almost gone

Where will we be

When the summer's gone?

He smiles innocently. Ray, a beat, turns away. Pam coming

over, squeezes his hand, sweetly, no fights today, she's his

lady.

INT. COUNTRY STORE - LAUREL CANYON - THAT DAY

JIM, in dark glasses, strongly feeling the effects of the

acid, stares at a box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes, unable to

relate.

Down the aisle PAMELA, in her wedding clothes, is pushing a

shopping cart, filled with the feast she's preparing. The

Store is a haven for HIPPIES from Laurel Canyon, barefoot

RUNAWAYS, BIKERS...

Jim looking, zombie-like for the food. PEOPLE of course stare

at him, knowing who he is.

At the CHECK-OUT COUNTER, the food being tallied up, JIM

spots his face plastered on the cover of something like the

"L.A. FREE PRESS" -- "ROCK'S BAD BOYS GO SOFT -- WHAT'S

HAPPENED TO THE REVOLUTION?"

Seeking in his pocket -- nothing but a credit card and a

rumpled old dollar bill... The faces of the Hippies looking

at him. With one of the magic markers on the counter, he

draws in his beard on his cover shot.

DOORS SONG

Morning found us clearly unaware

Noon burned gold into our hair

At night we swam the laughing sea

When summer's gone where will we be

EXT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - DAY

PAM and JIM and the labrador SAGE trudge up a hill carrying

the groceries to their modest little house tucked into a

hill of dangling eucaplyptus trees. We sense a community of

artists, hippies, Volkswagens.

Putting down the bags at their porch, pausing. He moves to

her, kisses her, conciliatory and gentle.

She's cracking up now. As he takes the acid out, holds it in

front of her like a sacrament.

As she takes the tablet on her tongue, swallows.

Strains of YOU'RE LOST, LITTLE GIRL drift in, setting a more

ominous tone.

INT. JIM AND PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - THAT DAY

The FOOD is laid out, the DUCK cooking... but no one is there

as we move across this tastefully decorated house to PAMELA

in the living room, rattled, obsessively going through Jim's

papers. PEOPLE are knocking at the door. Guests looking

through the windows, tapping. A giant poster of Marilyn Monroe

frames Pamela.

Jim is somewhere else -- pulling out the DUCK which is totally

charred black. He laughs.

RAY and DOROTHY walking in. ROBBIE and JOHN general commotion.

Dorothy immediately seeing the duck, runs to it...

DOORS SONG

You're lost little girl

You're lost little girl

You're lost, tell me

Who are you?

PEOPLE are introducing themselves, coming in from all over,

like in a shoebox. Hippies. Doors people... now TOM BAKER

with MIKE and DOG... Now an aggressive Chuck Berry type BLACK

SINGER with John's GIRLFRIEND. Then a TIMOTHY LEARY look-

alike appears. CHATTER blending everywhere as we build to a

vast confusion at Jim and Pam's party.

As she takes the tablet on her tongue, swallows.

The FRENCH COUNT coming in now, from the Warhol party in New

York. They're looking at her, embarrassing as everyone

overhears.

Only in life would ANNE O'RIORDAN walk in at this precise

moment, a smile on her face. Ray's eyes roll.

Anne uncomfortable, Jim getting pissed.

John's GIRLFRIEND is trying to introduce the BLACK SINGER to

Jim.

CHUCK VINCENT is suddenly there in Jim's face, bulging

eyeballs.

The charred TURKEY is being carved up. A moment of peace,

then: Pamela walks up to Jim with a bowl of sweet potatoes

in her arms, an announcement.

As she throws the sweet potatoes right at him, spraying

everybody. Jim laughing nuttily, the Count wiping the potatoes

off. Pam rushing now for the turkey to throw, Jim chasing

her.

Throwing the turkey at Jim, smearing everything, everybody.

She doesn't want the Count's solace, throws him off.

PATRICIA leaving now, covered with turkey sauce.

HUNGARIAN GYPSY FOLK MUSIC playing madly from the tape deck.

John fiddling with it, nervously.

They struggle, she goes for the carving knife, Dorothy and

Ray trying to restrain her. OTHER GUESTS keep talking as if

things are quite normal. Pam breaks through Dorothy -- coming

after Jim

He grabs her wrist just in time, equally insane now -- a

comic glow in his face. Jekyll and Hyde.

A ball of people wrestling across the kitchen floor, upsetting

the table and the remainder of the dishes, a carving knife

at stake in the air... Jim finally wrestling the knife away

and holding it over Pam.

She explodes inward, a bloodcurdling SHRIEK. The knife

clattering from her hand.

Jim laughing insanely. Jumping up and down on the duck. RAY

grabbing him, angry.

A silence. Robbie... John... their women... they start

exiting.

Ray about to lose his temper with Tom, checks it.

Exiting with the other Doors... Dog picking the duck up from

the floor.

Pamela is sobbing, in a quiet bewildered voice, repeating to

herself.

On Jim... saddened.

DOORS SONG

You're lost little girl (2)

You're lost, tell me

Who are you?

INT. TUNNEL - OUTDOOR THEATRE - NIGHT

The backbeat of NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH as a DOCUMENTARY FILM

CREW, moves past us directed by MIKE and DOG and TOM shoot

past us, sun guns, nagras ("Rolling! Speed!") then...

A mad rush of HANDS and SCREAMS as SHAPES whip by under

swinging light-bulbs -- big BLACK BODYGUARDS, six or seven

of them, bulling their way thru the grasping faces, as

MORRISON appears... camera swinging wildly with him to reveal:

EXT. ARENA - (ANY CITY) - NIGHT

THOUSANDS OF FANS roaring "DOORS! DOORS! DOORS!"

Madness. COPS lining the edge of the stage, looking worried.

As Jim throws his leather jacket into the cheering crowd and

does the ghost dance around the microphone, Indian style,

one foot, resurrecting the dead, the power of the circle.

The stage is bottom lit, Dantean in look. The Doors casting

giant shadows of heroic proportions. DEA AGENTS in suits and

short hair take photos from the front of the stage, clipboards

in hand. Blocked by a row of cops, it is impossible for Jim

to communicate with his audience.

SIDDONS yelling at MIKE, the roadie.

Jim ignoring all this, one hand cupped to his ear listening

for the sound of the earth, gone into a shaman-like state,

weird spiralling chords carrying over the following MONTAGE

of hallucinatory insanity.

EXT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

A POV up at the house -- into which JIM enters. The lights

are on. Sage at the door sniffing.

INT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

JIM'S POV entering the bedroom -- PAMELA naked in bed with

the COUNT, is snorting heroin. Shadows of the trees and leaves

blowing against the walls. Their voices, dim, distant.

She sits up on the bed, wobbly. The COUNT, more sophisticated

in these things, lights a cigarette from the bedside table,

revealing heroin paraphernalia.

EXT. ARENA - CONCERT

Jim's struggling to break through the barrier of cops.

INT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The COUNT is gone. JIM, icy cold, grabs PAM by the wrist.

He is on her, throws her from the bed. She runs and hides in

the closet, slamming the door behind her.

As he picks up a can of lighter fluid and douses the closet

door and the floor.

We INTERCUT with PAM inside the closet yelling for mercy

inside.

He puts a candle to the drenched door/floor.

Inside, PAM feels the first flames licking up, smoke wafting

in.

JIM leaves the house.

Pam kicking wildly at the doors, trying to smash her way out

as the FIRE crescendoes. She finally shatters the frail

molding and bursts out.

EXT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

PAM runs out into Laurel Canyon like a terrified doe running

from a forest fire. SONG beat NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH

continues.

EXT. STREET - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

Jim and Mike driving drunk, fucking TWO BLACK CHICKS. Mike

in the back seat. Jim drives the car up onto the grass of a

Police Station and plows right into it.

EXT. BOULEVARD - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

Knowing who's inside, sufficient be it to see the blue Shelby

Mustang plow into a telephone pole on Santa Monica Blvd.

INT. ANNE'S SOHO LOFT - NEW YORK - NIGHT

A HIGH PRIESTESS, assisted by a HIGH PRIEST, conducts a Wicca

wedding amidst a setting of candles, mixing a few drops of

JIM and ANNE's blood into a consecrated cup of wine, from

which they drink. They all wear long black robes, the only

light from the candles, standing inside a circle in front of

a table with altar, incense, chalice.

INT. LIMO - DAY

MOTORCYCLE ESCORTS COPS zoom past the limo windows on the LA

STREETS.

INT. ANNE'S SOHO LOFT - NEW YORK - RESUME NIGHT

The PRIESTESS presses the two cut wrists together, binding

them with a red cord.

Jim faints.

EXT. DOORS OUTDOOR CONCERT - NIGHT

JIM, mind totally gone into his trance, spreading his arms

like wings, hopping from one foot to the other like a shaman

around his microphone, whirling, yelling out great rewards

for the tribe. Plentiful antelope, healthy corn.

The kids are going wild -- writhing like maenads in his

intoxicating embrace. Embers from an enormous BONFIRE drift

past the stadium lights into the night. But the KIDS,

increasingly frustrated by a barrage of COPS, cannot see

their leader and now push against the cops with the very

result the authorities seek to repress.

RAY, gone into his own trance, happening to look up from his

keyboard. His eyes widen.

His POV -- an INDIAN SHAMAN hovers over the microphone.

Cloaked in hides, his face obscured by a horned headdress

with colored tails and feathers streaming down his shoulders,

rattles in each fist, the BONFIRE glowing...

The COPS can't hold. TEENAGE SHOCK TROOPS hitting the stage,

clambering up. The stage becoming a riot. Cops wading in

with sticks. ROADIES and BODYGUARDS yanking the MUSICIANS

from their places...

As DOG hauls the shaman king off in a bearhug, smiling stoned,

immaculate.

INT. ALTA CIENEGA MOTEL - DAY

Start slow CLOSE UP on JIM, he's crying, his head on a pillow,

silent, haunted... pull out to see the room, no explanations.

A TV GAME SHOW is on, JUDY, 17, and her FRIEND, 16, watching

naked, skinny..., piles of murder magazines and books,

clothes, and personal items trashed around the thread bare

room he calls home. She looks over at him.

Jim continues to cry.

He's so concerned, so solicitous that both girls crack up

laughing.

A knock at the door.

EXT. ALTA CIENEGA MOTEL ROOM - SAME DAY

PAM's mascara is running from her eyes, begging to get in.

The BLACK MAID cleaning the adjacent room overheard,

unsurprised.

Pamela listening at the door. She's on the second story of a

cheap motel overlooking a boring parking lot on the edge of

La Cienega.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

PEOPLE in the parking lot looking up. A silence is her only

response. She waits, turns away from the closed door as TOUCH

ME BABE cuts in:

DOORS SONG

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon c'mon now

Touch me babe

Can't you see that I am not afraid

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - THAT NIGHT

In the VOCAL BOOTH, JIM is chugging on a brown paper bag

with whiskey in it, crooning with heart but the voice is

warped, weak.

VARIOUS PEOPLE are hanging around the studio listening -- a

couple of HIPPIE CHICKS, A BURN VICTIM w/ bandages, a CHARLES

MANSON TYPE, a Siberian HUSKY, the TIM LEARY type. Paper

bags, burgers, bottles, California rose, apple juice, hard-

boiled eggs.

In the ENGINEERING BOOTH. ROTHCHILD, the producer, is

displeased.

On the floor, the DOORS are depressed. DENSMORE looking at

MORRISON, aimlessly, nervously. KRIEGER looking tired and

beaten, takes a discreet hit on a joint. Ray scans an art

book, patient.

As he stalks out of the booth. Raging, near-incomprehensible.

A small portable TV set is playing the "Dean Martin Show"

low on one end of the recording console. Around the room the

detritus of the time -- Mailer's "Armies of the Night", The

Stone's "Beggar's Banquet", Janis' "Cheap Thrills", Traffic,

The Band.

Pause. Jim's face darkening. Something he sees on the

television. He stops, frozen, sickly. Several BIMBETTES are

dancing around a shiny new automobile as strains of LIGHT MY

FIRE pop out.

Ray, Siddons, Robbie, John, shuffling for a moment.

PAMELA, looking drawn and pathetic finds this moment to walk

into the studio.

Pause. Turning to Ray.

A small smile flickers Jim's face as he picks up the small

TV and like a quarterback, hurls it, spinning end over end

from his corner of the Control Room towards Ray and Rothchild

and the Doors. They dive for the floor as it smashes to bits

into the wall behind the tape machines.

He seems pleased to distract his anger into her. She doesn't

seem to notice anything unusual going on. The Doors silent,

feeling Jim's rage.

The others all look away embarrassed. This is certainly a

moment the ordinary partner might turn away from Pamela, her

tears running, but her pathacy, her inability to deal with

pain is precisely what moves Jim the most -- a side of himself

in her -- an ultimate weakness she has, he shares. As he

goes to her, puts his arms gently around her.

Rothchild looking to Botnick and to Ray. But the real look,

the unforgiving one, is from Jim to Ray who feels it.

Rothchild douses the lights in the studio.

Overdubb of DOORS SONG SOFT PARADE - Jim's VOICE booming

thru the studio.

ROTHCHILD looking from his booth across at Jim. His POV --

only JIM is visible.

In the control booth RAY and ROBBIE share a look. The lights

have been dimmed in Jim's booth, and he's weaving back and

forth a bottle of Ripple in his hand as they kick in with

the music. Camera closing now on Jim in the tender section,

on the money.

In the darkened booth, PAM is on her knees his pants worked

down around his ankles, caressing him, sucking him off.

The DOORS sense it. ROTHCHILD knows it, hushed. Magic's

suddenly in the air once more as we jump stanzas to:

But Jim's voice has now gone off key, floating carefree,

drifting -- drifting away.

ROTHCHILD chuckles, philosophically.

The Doors in control booth start leaving. Robbie goes back

out to get his personal items.

But the OVERDUB still plays over the booth as Jim doesn't

realize. We take liberties cutting around on the song.

The Doors and ROTHCHILD all exiting, leaving BOTNICK the

engineer to clean up some technical things... and of course

the two occupants of the darkened booth.

The music stops. Silence.

Inside the booth, two shadows breathe deep, huddled on the

floor in each other's arms. A whisper out of the dark.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - LAST SESSION (1970) - NIGHT

JIM his head cocked, lost in the memory.

Pause. He coughs horribly, the phlegm sucking out his chest

with a horrid, asthmatic sound which he douses with another

cigarette and another shot of whiskey. The Bushmills now two

thirds empty. He looks over at the MYSTERY WOMAN now beside

him at the microphone. MIKE and the SECRETARY watch.

The bored ENGINEER across the darkened midnight room yawns.

INT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (1969)

Crammed into every available space of an old SEAPLANE HANGAR

with no seats -- standing room only -- a MASS of KIDS swelter

in the heat, grumbling, fanning themselves with programs as

a warm-up BAND plays.

In the wings of the stage, a RADIO DJ/CRITIC is recording on

tape. It's the same kid we saw long ago at the Whiskey

backstage, pronouncing the arrival of the Doors on the scene.

Now he's got a beard, glasses, a more cynical face.

DENSMORE looks on from the stage wings, withdraws -- to RAY

nearby.

INT. NEW ORLEANS AIRPORT BAR - SAME NIGHT

SIDDONS, the manager tugs on MORRISON who's getting soused

with DOG, TOM, MIKE, and ROTHCHILD the producer. The P.A.

SYSTEM announcing the departure of the Miami flight!

Jim slams has shot glass on the bar. He's got a beard for

the first time, looking like a tribal elder.

As the WAITRESS takes the order

INT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - THAT NIGHT

The warm-up BAND is applauded and booed. The CROWD resembles

a pit of snakes, wriggling on top of each other. Impatient

CATCALLS.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Robbie strums his guitar, breaks the tension in the room. A

lick of "Five to One".

OMIT

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. AIRPLANE - THAT NIGHT

The STEWARDESS, uptight, tries a smile at JIM, TOM, MIKE all

belted in one row.

A BABY, with her MOTHER, stares at Jim fascinated. He lifts

his dark glasses, winks back at her.

The STEWARDESS slips the oxygen mask over her face.

Other PASSENGERS looking over.

In flight. Dog squeezes from the lavatory and drops a small

bar of soap in Jim's drink. They laugh, push, yell. Jim is

smoking a cigar.

Tom spews the contents of his mouth all over Jim in response.

Jim throws his sandwich back at Tom... then another drink

goes...

A full fledged food fight in progress. Dog, Tom, Jim, Mike

pushing and shoving. A drink spills over an innocent

PASSENGER.

The STEWARDESS coming up with the CAPTAIN.

EXT. MIAMI AIRPORT - SAME NIGHT

PLANE taxiing up. TWO POLICE CARS, red lights revolving, are

waiting.

INT. PLANE - SAME NIGHT

PILOT escorting FOUR FBI AGENTS aboard.

JIM stunned in his drunkenness. SIDDONS and ROTHCHILD

protesting AD LIBS.

INT. MIAMI AUDITORIUM - THAT NIGHT

The CROWD is heckling a long-haired HIPPIE in a leather hat

who cradles a live, snow-white LAMB telling him to "GET OFF",

screaming AD LIB for the "DOORS, DOORS, DOORS!! JIM JIM JIM!!"

CATCALLS. Angry fists pound the edge of the proscenium. Bodies

push and pack against each other. If Hieronymus Bosch had

painted a rock concert, this would be it.

INT. BACKSTAGE - THAT NIGHT

Excitement. EVERYBODY moving fast...

...as JIM, dark sunglasses and beard, surrounded by TWO FBI

AGENTS and his BODYGUARDS move toward the stage, two hours

late. SIDDONS with him arguing AD LIB with RAY and the

PROMOTER, a southern sleazeball with long muttonchops and

velvet shirt and beads. A mess -- the CROWD chanting DOORS!

DOORS! DOORS! DOORS!

Meanwhile, JOHN arguing with RAY and JIM who sways, drunk.

The FBI agents get lost in the background.

Jim laughing, throws his arm around ROBBIE for support, ROBBIE

patient with him. John yelling as they approach the curtains

and the lights and the first monster realization of the

THOUSAND MOUTHS waiting in the pit of hell.

As JIM brings up a tiny vial with a lubricating head on it,

holds it to Robbie's lips playfully. They're in the shadows.

Something so sincere in Jim's eyes. Robbie takes the fatal

lick. Jim smiles manically as the NUREMBERG SOUNDS of the

CROWD drown them out.

INT. STAGE - SAME NIGHT

The DOORS come out finally. The noise is overwhelming. Acid,

light, noise. Wagnerian Gods, Hitler...

JIM spreading his arms like Icarus set to fly. The ROARS

redouble, their FEET stomping out:

Joints are thrown by the dozen on the stage at Jim's feet.

He is a god now as he bends regally, picks one up.

COPS everywhere looking as...

He lights it. The CROWD going nuts as the DOORS go into the

ominous introductory strains of FIVE TO ONE trying to get

the onus off Jim and the show on the road. The Audience knows

the song, go into a primal FOOT STOMP with it. Bras are thrown

on stage. Kids writhe madly in the primal Doors dance.

People with SPARKLERS running through the hangar. CAMERA

FLASHBULBS popping throughout the show... get Jim on film

while you can.

Jim, drunk, high, smoking the jay, won't go into the lyrics

right off, forcing the Doors to circle the beat again. He

jerks his hand back from the mike as if it were a hot wire.

The Crowd explodes once more. As a COP heads upstage to get

Jim for the joint -- he cooly flicks it back into the crowd,

avoiding disaster. Perfect timing as the Cop looks around,

suddenly distracted by:

The Crowd yelling something. An INSANE TEENAGER stands on

the railing of a balcony above the auditorium, poised to

swan dive some 18 feet into the crowd. Which he now does,

arms held out like wings.

The Crowd yells, parting to allow his bulk to smack the floor.

Pause. Cops rushing to the spot. The KID suddenly stands up,

unhurt, with a stoned out look on his face.

Then splits at a full run thru the crowd chased by the

perplexed Cops. Everybody surging back towards the stage as

JIM looses one of his primal SCREAMS.

He slobbers, drunk, slouches, stumbles, regains his balance.

The Crowd loves it, but Ray senses something wrong. Robbie

starts to feel the effects of the acid Jim gave him -- his

eyes registering fear.

During the instrumental break, Jim picks up one of the roses

from the floor, pokes it at John on the drums, who whacks it

to death on his skins. Jim starts to whirl the mike cord

like a slingshot or bolo, in an ever-widening arc...

...it flies off and smashes into the head of the PROMOTER at

the edge of the stage arguing with SIDDONS. The man is

staggered, weaving, Siddons helping him to a FIRST AID TEAM.

The crazy VEGETERIAN HIPPIE runs out on stage to give Jim

the white lamb to make this political point. Jim holds the

lamb in his arms. It's purring, gentle. DOG chases the HIPPIE

off as he gives the microphone back to Jim and takes the

lamb from him... he staggers over to ROBBIE and goes down to

his knees, pretending to give him head on his frantic stoned

guitar solo.

PHOTOGRAPHERS flashing cameras. BAKER urging him on from the

wings as he passes out. A GIRL runs onto the stage, dumps a

bottle of champagne on Jim's head. Jim takes his shirt off,

soaking wet. The CROWD is also stripping in the heat, shirts,

blouses, screaming so much now they are obviously way past

listening to any song. It has become a view of the future --

the NAKED GIRL and BOY dancing stark naked drugged out in

the middle of it all, the FAT GIRL prowling naked on the

edge of the stage before she's arrested, the FIGHTS in the

Crowd, fists, blood, a black man chased and beaten, the sense

of Altamont here, the hippie flower trip gone to shit --

it's all come down here tonight, the end of an era.

He stops singing suddenly, squinting out into the madness.

The arena echoes with the uncomprehending chant of the Mob...

SPECIAL EFFECT -- the INDIAN GHOST is leaving Jim's body --

spectrally moving off him, hovering there in the air, its

eyes -- the face of a dying Indian on an Arizona highway --

then gone. A moment, only three, four beats. An optical

illusion? Maybe. Or is it saying, 'now you are just a white

man'... maybe not. As it drifts off in a cloud, into the

vast audience's EYEBALL.

The instruments continue to vamp but there's a hush to the

CROWD.

He waits. INTERCUTS of the FACES in the crowd.

The Crowd BOOS back at him, surging suddenly with hatred for

Jim. Intercut the Crowd -- feel this hatred.

The Band has petered out by this point but out of nowhere,

ROBBIE, zonked on his version of LSD, starts up with "TOUCH

ME BABE."

Jim pulling his shirt off -- barechested -- waving it like a

toreador in front of his leather crotch.

The audience seems to be paying no attention to what he is

doing or saying, which drives him to deeper rage.

He saunters to the edge of the stage. Hisses at them. He

clasps his crotch, leering at a cute LITTLE GIRL in the front

row, shaking it at her. Her BOYFRIEND, pissed at Jim, runs

for the stage. Jim unzips his leathers.

Chaos, confusion now erupt in the crowd! The BOYFRIEND is

running at JIM as the BODYGUARDS throw him back into the

crowd. Jim flicking his shirt over his crotch, back and forth

like a drunken matador. The Doors look at each other, don't

know what's going to happen.

The crowd roars its approval. Confusion reigns. Drunken

CATCALLS. Things, bras, cans thrown at the stage.

He feigns opening his belt and exposing himself, flipping

his shirt back and forth over the crotch in a mock striptease.

A flock of TEENAGE GIRLS are sure they've seen it, hysterical.

He looks like he's really gonna tear it all off now. A flash

of boxer shorts. RAY moving. SIDDONS moving. DOG getting to

him first, wrapping him in a bearhug from behind, lifting

him holding his pants up.

The place is in PANDEMONIUM now. GIRLS jumping on stage and

dancing with Jim still in Vince the Roadie's bearhug. Another

RIOT... COPS fighting the TEENAGERS off the stage, now

wobbling under the weight.

RAY starts playing BREAK ON THROUGH trying to keep things

normal.

JIM now out there in the arena in a CONGA LINE, doing his

rain dance, hands on hips, the TEENAGERS forming a long snake

behind him.

The huge speaker columns teeter and fall. A corner of the

STAGE now COLLAPSES from the weight, PEOPLE spilling on the

floor, screams. The power console tips over next to DENSMORE.

He bails. Manzarek and Krieger follow.

The PROMOTER is yelling at SIDDONS about his insurance

contract as the COPS and FBI AGENTS close in, looking for

Jim.

Who is out there leading his naked drunken FLOCK, hundreds

of them in a phallic Pied Piper dance thru the darkened

seaplane hanger. From BREAK ON THROUGH PART TWO:

Ray watching from the corner of the stage, littered with

bras, bottles, shirts, shoes, socks, panties, hats, broken

equipment, debris -- the end of the dream. The Doors as a

live band are dead.

INT. MIAMI COURTROOM - DAY (1970)

The "Charges" are being read by the JUDGE, distant, not of

this world. The court is lit in southern gothic daylight,

ghostly chiaroscuro, all colors bled. Camera moving along

the sweaty white faces of the six older JURORS, all of them

straight "silent majority"... past the PROSECUTOR, his shadow

cutting the jury box... onto JIM bearded, smoking 2 packs a

day, a deep racking cough, sitting with his elder ATTORNEY...

RAY, ROBBIE, JOHN, PAMELA, OTHERS in support are there in

background. The trial is going down like a morphine dream,

Jim featured in diopter close-up.

A blues riff goes by -- brief, ghostly from RUNNING BLUE.

JIM SONG

Poor Otis dead and gone

Left me here to sing his song

Pretty little girl with the red dress on

Poor Otis dead and gone

The PRESS SECTION is full as Jim's older LAWYER argues in

front of the JURY, a distant voice.

The backbeat of WHEN THE MUSIC'S OVER starts, into its

spiralling descent.

The PRESS is bored, their numbers reduced. The spectators

have changed from kids to OLDER PEOPLE intent on preserving

their way of life. A TAPE is playing of Jim's devil voice at

the concert, cursing: "Come on up here. No limits! No laws",

etc... (screams, obscenity)

JIM & DOORS

(SONG)

When the music's over (3)

Turn out the lights (3)

For the music is your special friend

Dance on fire as it intends

Music is your only friend

Until the end (2)

The PRESS section is now down to about THREE bored FACES,

one of them PATRICIA KENNEALY who looks pregnant.

JIM smiles at her.

JIM & DOORS

Cancel my subscription to the Resurrection

Send my credentials to the house of detention

I got some friends inside

EXT. ORANGE BOWL - MIAMI - DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE (DAY)

ANITA BRYANT & JACKIE GLEASON at the NATIONAL DECENCY RALLY.

A large CROWD in the vicinity of 100,000. NIXON addressing

them.

JIM & DOORS SONG

(OVER)

The face in the mirror won't stop

The girl in the window won't stop

A feast of friends alive she cried

Waiting for me

Outside!

JIM & DOORS SONG

(OVER)

Before I sink into the big sleep

I want to hear

The scream of the butterfly

Come back baby

Back into my arms

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MIAMI BEACH - DAY

The MUSIC continuing into a long backbeat without lyrics --

emphasizing the downward spiralling theme...

Pause. PATRICIA -- four and a half months pregnant, stares.

A glary window onto a balcony overlooking the sea with Florida

palms and a strip of beach. A room in a highrise hotel. Jim's

mess is everywhere.

A look. She's stunned, ugly wrath gathering. He tries to

soothe her.

She pulls a dagger with a skull's head on it, goes for him.

She suddenly grasps him, clutching, hunger, lust.

JIM & DOORS

...the scream of the butterfly

Come back baby

Back into my arms

On Jim's face.

EXT. MIAMI COURTROOM - DAY

TWO HUNDRED PERSONS are gathered on the lawn outside, banners

decrying the Doors. A MIDDLE AGED SPEAKER, clean cut, squarely

dressed, expresses his outrage.

JIM & DOORS

(OVER)

We're getting tired of hanging around

Waiting around with our heads to the ground

I hear the gentle sound

Very near yet very far

Very soft, yeah, very clear

Come today, come today

As he goes into the courtroom, a dolled up REPORTER 1, the

local anchor-lady turns to her camera.

INT. COURTROOM - THAT DAY

The judge passing sentence, distant, hazy under song. Darkened

shadows across the floor, silhouettes... the world bleak and

white...

All the voices merging into one:

Jim, during this, picking up the TV remote, flicking on the

images. The VOICES blending with TV VOICES as he swithes the

channels. The camera moving in on Jim, the VOICES fading.

All we see is Jim. All we hear and see is the TV:

The SONG climaxes into an inner scream of madness.

JIM & DOORS

(CONCLUDE)

For the music is your special friend

Dance on fire as it intends

Music is your only friend

Until the end (3)

(SCREAM!)

Silence on Jim.

The sound of wind, the backbeat of LA WOMAN flooding in.

EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT HOTEL - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

JIM dangles out on the narrow ledge that circumscribes the

20th floor rooftop -- wind blowing thru his wild hair, the

card zooming by like racer lights on Sunset below. The song

LA WOMAN continues born from this renewed feeling of danger.

JIM & DOORS

Well I just got into town 'bout an hour ago

Took a look around, see which way the wind blow

Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows

PAM screaming for him to come back from the edge as TOM BAKER

and MIKE and DOG and a CAMERAMAN film in 16mm.

JIM yelling back, as he drinks from a pint of whiskey,

enjoying himself enormously.

He feigns a fall.

RAY and SIDDONS arrive, terrified, looking for him.

Jim cracking up with laughter. BAKER, drunk and the FILM

CREW love it, swishpanning with a cheap sungun.

Pam is sufficiently cracked on her own set of drugs to start

climbing out onto the ledge, skirts blowing in the wind.

Jim moving further along the ledge.

JIM & DOORS

(OVER)

LA Woman (X2)

LA Woman Sunday afternoon (X3)

Drive thru your suburbs

Into your blues (X2)

Into your blue-blue

Blues

Into your blues

Siddons and Ray terrified. Is this the night it's finally

going to end in a suicide plunge? Ray trying to stop Pam,

too late.

Pam's moving shakily along the ledge, cracked on downers.

Jim watching her come, amazed at her risk.

He watches, does nothing.

Reaches his hand out. She is closer. But shaky.

Ray goes after Tom Baker and the Film Crew. A scuffle.

Yelling, shouting, but down below in the intimacy of the

ledge, blowing out on the edge, the wind and the world and

death. Two crazy children linked on this gothic balcony of

the Chateau reach their hands out for each other.

She has never been so concentrated, inching closer to him.

Her heels overhanging oblivion.

JIM & DOORS

Never saw a woman

So alone (X2)

So alone -- lone lone

Ray, Tom, Siddons, Mike, Dog, they all watch in horror,

sensing it will happen. They have even stopped filming.

Inches... inches.

He dodges her touch, confused... to the last possible second.

Then SHE'S THERE -- in his arms. Her arms latch around him

and she hugs him with all her wiry soul.

The two lovers huddled together on the ledge. He slips his

head down on her lap, looking up into her eyes with the

strangest tears in his eyes.

On her face -- moved. Pause. LA WOMAN floods in on his smile,

an upbeat surge.

Upstairs, the ONLOOKERS relax. HOTEL MANAGEMENT and COPS are

now rushing up in background.

JIM & DOORS

Mr. Mojo Rising

Mr. Mojo Risin' (X2)

EXT. DOORS OFFICE - SANTA MONICA BL. - L.A. - DAY (1970)

There's music rocking from the inside. Cables and baffles

run from the second story down to the rehearsal room on the

first.

JIM & DOORS

Keep on risin'

Got to keep on risin'

Risin' Risin' (X8)

INT. DOORS OFFICE - DAY

The SECRETARIES and STAFF dance to the SOUND rocking thru

the floor.

JIM & DOORS

Well I just got into town about an hour ago

Took a look around, see which way the wind blow

Camera moving thru the offices, past the OFFICE BOY, past

SIDDONS, past the PUBLICIST, etc -- a farewell to the band.

INT. BASEMENT - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

We see RAY, ROBBIE, JOHN, BOTNICK, a BASS and 2nd RHYTHM

GUITARIST, WIVES, GIRLFRIENDS but no Jim. They're really

driving, the music soars. PAMELA'S hair shaking as she swings

to the beat.

INT. TOILET - RECORDING STUDIO - SAME DAY

Wires run into a tiny toilet revealing JIM with headphones

to his ears barking into a dangling mike, one leg propped on

a toilet seat, in a groove. A new, strange, unparalleled

beauty in his voice, hoarser but wiser, haunted by experience

yet joyful as youth, Jim is ironically, at his best.

EXT. LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY

MONTAGE: Moving, moving, moving -- all the POVS from fast-

moving CARS travelling with the pace of L.A. Song of freedom,

of escape -- the STRIP, the cars, the freeway, the

BILLBOARDS... farewell L.A.

INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Camera creeping towards ANNE O'RIORDAN as she waits, alone

on a white table for the doctor to arrive. Jim never showed

up after all. But on we go.

JIM & DOORS

I see your hair is burning

Hills are filled with fire

If they say I never lov'd you

You know they are a liar (etc)

Never saw a woman

So alone (X2)

So alone lone lone

So alone

EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - VENICE - DAY

JIM drives up in his beaten GTO MUSTANG, top down, bags all

over the place, hops out. Carrying his bulk with grace, knocks

and rings. RIDERS ON THE STORM starting to play over.

INT. RAY'S HOUSE - DAY

DOROTHY opens the door. Jim a stack of presents under his

arm.

EXT. RAY YARD - DAY

He spots them, crossing to the YARD where a CHILDREN'S

BIRTHDAY is in progress -- TWO DOZEN KIDS, a CLOWN acting

out for them. A few parents and friends -- ROBBIE and LYNNE,

their kid, JOHN and his RECENT LADY, their kid...

When the KIDS spot JIM they light up.

They stick a ludicrous printed birthday hat on his head. A

bearded Santa Claus now engulfed with kids, though puffy,

body gone, a literal physical wreck, yet a gentle pathos

about him and still a charisma that the children react to

without thinking. He gives out the presents all over.

As RAY and ROBBIE and JOHN and the others circle him.

As ROBIN, the cutest of them all, a bow in her hair, takes

the package, opens it.

Jim cocks his head, listening to it playing from an inner

room, his eyes on ROBIN opening the gift -- a beautiful,

ANTIQUE DOLL of an 19th century poet -- rock star, stuffed,

velour jacket, white fluffy lace collar, it could be Byron

or it could be Jim Morrison -- in fact the hair is perfectly

weaved to resemble Jim in his young lion phase -- an ironic

gift, meant from the heart. It stops everybody -- they all

look. A haunted quality to the doll.

She kisses him.

INT. RAY'S WORK SPACE - DAY

Off the patio windows of the birthday party, sounds and

sunshine pouring in. The Clown running around, laughter. The

music plays -- BRUCE at the mixing board.

JIM & DOORS

Riders on the Storm (x2)

Into this house we're born

Into this world we're thrown

Like a dog without a bone

An actor out on loan

Riders on the storm

Where we and Jim came in, I guess. Jim drinks from a cognac

bottle straight, foot tapping, enjoying it, knows it's good --

but other things are calling. This is history.

Slapping shoulders, shaking hands.

The kids running up to grab JIM, pulls him back to the party.

EXT. GARDEN - LATER DAY

JIM, a bearded Santa Claus with the birthday hat on his head,

surrounded by the GIRLS and BOYS and DOROTHY shooting a home

movie. They're eating birthday cake but UNCLE JIM is drinking

straight from the cognac bottle -- a strange sight.

He laughs, looks at Dorothy who's shooting him with the Super

8.

His eyes on a LITTLE BOY who's walking into the party, sitting

down with the others, ignored, isolated, a birthday cap on

his head. Clothes belong to the 1940's and the face seems

familiar. Jim is not sure, woozy from the cognac. As he fades.

We saw the Boy many years ago in the backseat of the car in

the Arizona desert.

Jim's head falling gently into his folded arms on the table,

the cognac bottle at his elbow, merlin hat on, beard, the

kids laughing, pulling his ears and nose -- he doesn't wake

up.

As Ray comes over now, rouses him gently.

Jim coming awake in that instant alert way of his, but

obviously hung over.

Puzzling remark, He gets up, shaky, exits, kids tearing at

him. Goodbyes.

EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - VENICE - TWILIGHT

The beach is behind them, the last of the frisbee players

and dogs, the skaters go by, as we continue to hear RIDERS

from within.

Jim, not the sentimental type, climbs in his car, amused.

Ignites engine. Ray leans in, lightening up.

As he departs, waving.

His point of view -- Jim receding into the sun in his mustang --

making a shakey, screeching curve at the bend of the beach.

And he's gone. An ominous ROAR of an AIRPLANE above RAY. --

flying away.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - TWILIGHT

The PLANE flies off into the setting ball of red sun.

INT. RECORDING SESSION (LAST SESSION) - L.A. - DEC.

The bearded POET hunches in his chair, exhausted, clutching

the paper, finished. Pause. He downs a final shot, grunts to

the Indian Ghostman sitting there on a stool watching him in

the corner of the studio. The Ghostman laughs (but nothing

comes out of his mouth). His wrinkled eyes are happy,

feathered ponytail, he nods... pleased.

The ENGINEER, exhausted, doesn't feel anything funny.

The poets face brightens. A small but ever-so-sweet smile of

triumph hikes up the corners of his mouth.

He stands, sways, than moves out of view. The empty bottle

of whiskey, its sands run out, is left behind.

As we FADE OUT, a hardy, mischievous Morrison laugh and a

ripple of sensuous MUSIC carry us into the lilting, lamenting

strains of AN AMERICAN PRAYER -- THE END without lyrics for

now as we cut to:

INT. PARIS BEDROOM - NEAR DAWN (NIGHT) (1971)

PAMELA is agitated in her sleep -- waking as she feels him

watching. Is that him? At the door? A SHADOW -- leaves.

Footsteps moving down the narrow Parisian corridor with the

creaky floor.

Looks at the time. Somewhere near dawn. The sounds of a bath

being drawn. Nightmare or sleep? She tries to fade back to

sleep but the MUSIC and the WHISPERING prod her, pull her

awake...

DISSOLVE: SAME FACE -- AN HOUR LATER.

Putting her robe on, the slippers, the light... moving. She

is much more ravaged looking than before.

INT. BATHROOM - DAWN

She finds him now... His face floating upwards, angelic eyes,

the beard is now gone, a little smile on his face. He must

be playing another joke. Although she really knows as she

says the words:

His face. At peace, as she sobs, the MUSIC cresting to Jim's

lyrics.

EXT. PERE LACHAISE CEMETERY - PARIS - DAY

His face etching into a perfect Alexandrine bust of physical

beauty. The camera moving to reveal, a wintry day, leaves

blowing, the wild cats everywhere in the empty cemetery, the

crumbling tombs, the flowers fresh and dead around Jim's

tomb, the graffiti, wine bottles, Wilde, Bizet, Piaf, Chopin,

Morrison...

The MUSIC rolling up on:

INT. CORRIDOR & STAGE - LIMBO

Smoke. Some lights. The distant cheers of a CROWD. In slightly

SLOW MOTION, a FIGURE moves down a corridor into a blinding

light of stage and smoke. THREE OTHER SHADOWS are there

waiting -- as the GHOST moves to the microphone in altered

motion.

The AUDIENCE is out there somewhere in the dark -- we sense

they too have become ghosts, as all of us will one day. The

MUSIC continuing up to roll from AMERICAN PRAYER -- THE END --

snatches we annotate.

Camera closing past the DOORS to JIM alone, circling the

mike with his dance -- the INDIAN GHOSTMAN jigging, shaman-

like, off to the side -- now levitating above the stage, all

crazy, gawky dancing.

Ending with a solitary sing-song croak.

THE SUBTITLE READS "JIM IS SAID TO HAVE DIED OF 'HEART

FAILURE'. PAMELA JOINED HIM THREE YEARS LATER"... HER ASHES

WERE BURIED NEXT TO HIM."

BLACK SCREEN WITH CREDITS

...Let's lighten it up with some good old rock and roll. As

we hear Jim and the Doors running loose on ROADHOUSE BLUES"
