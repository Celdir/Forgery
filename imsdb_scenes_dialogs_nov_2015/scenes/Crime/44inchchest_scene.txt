But COLIN is sobbing... quietly sobbing... sobbing his heart

out... ARCHIE looks in the rear view mirror at MAL... Who in

turn looks to MEREDITH who calmly smokes raising an eyebrow...

Now the van swings into a cul-de-sac, headlights illuminating

a row of tatty garages and picking out OLD MAN PEANUT who

stands there stony-faced... MAL opens the rear door... OLD MAN

PEANUT clambers in... ARCHIE throws the van into reverse and

takes off again....

The van double-parked engine running ... COLIN still slumped

in his seat staring teary-eyed at the dash-board... MEREDITH

and OLD MAN PEANUT in the back focused on the exterior of an

Italian restaurant...

Busy, bustling atmosphere... Customers becoming aware of a

co mm o ti on at t h e ba c k of th e r es t au ra n t... N o w th e ir

consternation grows as MAL who has got hold of one of the

waiters (we cannot see his face as his red shirt has ridden

up over his head in the struggle) is violently, relentlessly,

frog-marching him at great pace towards the door... We are

with ARCHIE overseeing the 'operation'... Staff terrified...

Customers alarmed... ARCHIE wheels round wielding an outsize

pepper grinder like a club... Crash/zoom in on him...

He too backs out of the door...

MEREDITH and OLD MAN PEANUT watching as MAL, THE WAITER and

ARCHIE spill onto the street... ARCHIE discarding the giant

pepper grinder as he goes... THE HAPLESS WAITER is bundled

into the back of the van... ARCHIE gets in... It drives

off...

ARCHIE, holding a carrier bag of shopping, is in conversation

with another man, BIGGY WALPOLE, aged 58, wears tweed sports

jacket, cavalry twills, brown suede brogues, handlebar moust-

ache, Daily Mail under his arm, his dog ROSEMARY, a wire-

haired terrier, by his side...

We are on ROSEMARY'S expectant face looking up at ARCHIE ...

Over this we hear...

We are on ROSEMARY...

ARCHIE smiles. Looks back to BIGGY...

ARCHIE is walking away... BIGGY and ROSEMARY in the other

direction... Suddenly BIGGY stop's... turns... stares darkly

at the departing figure of ARCHIE who ambles off unaware...

BIGGY is staring with such hatred... we move in on his

face... His hating face... we are close up... he stares just

off camera... seems he is growling... low... primal growls...

and now his hand, claw-like, comes into frame... he is

reaching towards us... threatening-ly ... and slowly his

hating eyes follow... and he is staring right at us...

The room is as described in the prologue albeit with gable

wall intact... MAL stands by the crumbling mantelpiece his

back to the room... Touches the back of his head as if

something has brushed against him... Over this we hear...

MAL glances over his shoulder... ARCHIE is crouching over and

sorting through a card-board box containing various bottles

of spirits...

MAL is handed a bottle of Bells whiskey - he slumps in one of

the armchairs... Opens the bottle...

Back view of a rain-coated man slowly walking the bleak

ancient streets.... We follow him... Over this we hear...

The man turns a corner and we see his face... Sad, sorry, lost,

self -pit yin g, b een thr oug h th e m ill. .. This is COL IN

DIAMOND...

ARCHIE and MAL as before...

The lonely figure of COLIN walks...

COLIN walks under an old iron bridge...

COLIN stops... Lost in thought... Staring down at/into

puddles...

Big C/U on COLIN'S little boy lost face...

ARCHIE and MAL as before...

Immediately the door opens and COLIN enters... Atmosphere. He

take s of f h is M ac. .. A nd sits in one of the ba tter ed

armchairs...

ARCHIE and MAL look at each other...

COLIN grunts... ARCHIE resumes sorting through the cardboard

box... MAL lights up... smokes...

The three men smile ... MAL and ARCHIE look at COLIN...

Silence...

ARCHIE tosses him a bottle.

COLIN opens it and drinks...         ARCHIE and MAL watch him

intently...

ARCHIE and MAL look at each other... knowingly...

Suddenly the doo r flies open an d there stands O LD MAN

PEANUT...

OLD MAN PEANUT sits... ARCHIE takes him the bottle of vodka

and a plastic cup... stands over him...

ARCHIE shrugs...

...OLD MAN PEANUT gets up ... goes over to him... stares him

in the eyes...

Suddenly the wardrobe wobbles... Creaks... They all turn to

look at it... Faint sounds of struggle from within... It

stops... Is still... Silence eventually...

Sounds o f traffi c... LIZ is try ing to s cramble up the

embankment ... Trying... Failing ... She is cold, wet, muddy,

bloody ... No shoes ... Her white dress torn and blood-soaked

... She tries to climb ... In vain ... Slips in the mud ...

No strength ... Cries in frustration... Falls on her back...

Lies there...still ... Curls up... Above her the traffic

zooms by.

Now t he do or o pe ns. .. M ER EDI TH s ta nds f ra me d b y th e

doorway... Immaculately dressed... A wry smile... He raises

his arm in a Romanesque salute...

He sits... Looks around the room.

MEREDITH smiles...

Suddenly ... From his armchair...

Now the men all look to COLIN ... pause...

COLIN is opening the back doors of a grey mercedes... Merrily           *

takes out a massive bouquet... a big box of chocolates ...              *

Laden and happy he awkwardly approaches his front door ...

Enters...

A Poodle greets him enthusiastically.

He enters the kitchen...his wife LIZ, is standing in a white

dress at the far end ... Looking away ... Gazing out of the

window...

She does not react ... He places things on the table.

He goes to the fridge...

He takes out a pint carton of full fat milk

He knocks back the full pint in one ... LIZ glances at him

... He reaches into the fridge again and takes out a can of

coke...

He begins glugging the coke ... Finishes it...

LIZ is silent...

He o pens a cupb oar d. T ake s ou t a pac ket of cho cola te

biscuits. Unwraps one..., eats it...

LIZ looks at him ... Looks away ... Stares out of the window

... Worried... Puts her hand to her forehead ... She is

biting her lower lip...

She look s a t hi m . .. T ear s in he r ey es. .. E ven tual ly

struggling...

Words fail her.   She sighs heavily

Eventually...

She can't look at him. Stares at the floor ... Eventually ...

A LONG PAUSE...

She can't look at what she's done to him ... She gazes out         *

of the window ... Far, far away ...                                *

Slowly ... Slowly ... We move in on COLIN ... He begins to

blink ... Is swallowing ... His chin wobbling ... Can't

speak... Uncomprehending little eyes... His gullet begins to

spasm ... He swoons ... Stumbles back ... His knees go ... He

grips the toaster for support ... Looking at her as she

stares out of the window ... Looking ... Looking ... His

desperate eyes pleading ...                                        *

The men are watching him...                                           *

The seething PEANUT paces the room...

MEREDITH, alone, strolls along the lamplit street ... Over

this we hear...

MEREDITH walking ... Suddenly, from out of nowhere a metallic

blue Rolls Royce Corniche thunders and screeches up beside

him almo st m oun ting the pa veme nt . ..

Simu ltan eous ly t he curb side back doo r fli es o pen and

crashes/smashes into a lamp-post shattering its window and

buckling... MEREDITH turns at the sound of the impact... And

is immediately greeted by a figure emerging from the back

seat ... The man is larger than life ... 60-ish... He wears a

full length white mink coat over a tuxedo ... His coiffured

hair sports a pink rinse ... He is over-excitedly pleased to

se e h i s f r i e n d , M E R E D I T H . . . T e r r i f y i n g l y s o . . .

Psychopa thically happy h e stand s in the middle of the

pavement like a frenzied polar bear...

TIPPI GORDON bellows insanely at MEREDITH...

The men listen to MEREDITH'S story...

TITANIC C/U ON TIPPI'S maniacally ecstatic face...

MEREDITH and TIPPI in the back of the Roller as it travels

through London ... TIPPI chopping out huge lines of cocaine

on a walnut veneer tabletop...

To the UNIFORMED CHAUFFEUR, indicating the coke

The Rolls Royce has stopped at a red light ...THE CHAUFFEUR

casually gets out of the front and climbs into the back ...

The lights change to green ... Cars behind get impatient ...

Start tooting...more and more horns sound ... Blaring out...

We move through the elegant casino ... Over this we hear...

We now come across MEREDITH and TIPPI laughing, engaged in

conversation...

MEREDITH turns from TIPPI and speaks directly to us into

camera...

TIPPI heads for the nearest roulette table...

We can see TIPPI intently staring down at the wheel almost

crowding THE CRO UPIER wh o smile s polite ly at hi s high

spirits...

We can see TIPPI intently staring down at the wheel ...

hungry ... childish....excited...

We see TIPPI staring intently down at the wheel... almost

wetting himself with anticipation.. until...

We are on TIPPI staring intently down at the wheel...

C/U on the roulette wheel-the ball spinning and hurtling

round ... we watch as it comes to rest...

Massive C/U on TIPPI'S thrilled by losing face...

MEREDITH turns slowly to stare at him...

MEREDITH laughs...

LIZ at the window ... COLIN at the table...

Pause... he fights his tears... struggles to get it together

... breathes ... breathes hard ... sucking in air ... trying

to gather strength ... from somewhere... calms a bit ...

stares hard at her ... eventually- .

There is a pause as LIZ decides how to play this...

LIZ makes towards the door.     But COLIN beats her to it ...

slams it shut...

LIZ, frightened, has stepped back.

We are C/U on COLIN'S hand by his side... it begins to

tighten ... begins to ball itself into a fist...

COLIN standing ... the men listening...

...OLD MAN PEANUT goes to him... puts his arm around him...

comforts him... ARCHIE, seeing this, goes over the wardrobe

... addresses it...

MAL joins him... addresses the wardrobe...

Blackness ... tiny light leaking in from cracks/joints in

wood ... a shape ... breathing

Pause ... breathing in the blackness...

COLIN is staring at the wardrobe but suddenly he rises and

heads for the door...

The men thwarted, sit in silence ... MAL looks at PEANUT ...

PEANUT looks at ARCHIE ... MEREDITH looks at MAL ... PEANUT

looks at MEREDITH ... ARCHIE looks at MAL ... MEREDITH looks

at ARCHIE...

Running until... Eventually... Having run himself into the

ground... He collapses against a brick wall in shadow...

Holds onto it ... Buries his head into it... Pitifully...

Like Judah Ben Hur when first seeing his mother and sister

emerge from the leper colony...

LIZ lying still in scrub at the foot of the embankment- her

eyes slowly open ... her POV....the cloudy night sky.

MEREDITH, ARCHIE, MAL & OLD MAN PEANUT chatting...

They all laugh ... The door opens ... COLIN comes in ...

speaking...

He begins to tug at this collar...

COLIN does.   Pop-eyed.

COLIN, calming, stares at MEREDITH...

COLIN is staring at him. transfixed. like a snake in front of

a charmer.

Indicates the wardrobe. COLIN looks at it. darkens ...

MEREDITH calms him

COLIN dumbly nods

Slowly MEREDITH turns to look at the wardrobe ... COLIN Does

likewise ... looks back to MEREDITH...

MEREDITH stares hard at COLIN ...

COLIN shrinks back with the realisation of what is being

implied... Scared...

COLIN dumbfounded can only stand and watch as...

ARCHIE begins to fish in his pocket...

COLIN finds himself holding the coin... He swallows ...

Closes his eyes as if in prayer ... Opens them ... Is about

to toss the coin...

COLIN, gulping, looks at each of them in turn ... Looks at

the coin ... Swallows again-tosses it ... The coin spins

upwards- into the air ... Humungous C/U of the coin spinning

... Music begins, CHILLS & FEVER by TOM JONES...

Music continues. Huge C/U... S/M... The coin spinning...

The men watch the coin land on HEADS!

The music continues...

THE MUSIC CONTINUES...

We fade in on ... MAL in motion ... Pacing like a lion ...            *

Serious faced hard eyed ... Intent ... Focused on something

just off camera ... Studying it...

We see MEREDITH seated ... smokes ... Super sexy-slowly...            *

Focused on something just off camera ... Studying it...

PEANUT standing... Staring... super- slow... Caught mid-              *

expression... Mid horrible expression... Vicious denture

manoeuvres... Old man horrendousness ... Focused on something

just off camera ... Studying it...

And ARCHIE... dear old ARCHIE... Swigging from a bottle...            *

And focused on something just off camera... Studying it...

... And COLIN... Poor COLIN... Seated... Staring down... Down

at the floor... The floorboards ... The music fades ...

Disappears... silence ... More silence...

And now we see the room...

The men as described and the object of their focus... Seated

on a small, wooden kitchen chair is a figure with a scruffy           *

old Tesco carrier bag over it's head... The wardrobe is

open... The figure is cowed. Broken. Beaten.

Scared ... The men are relaxed-all the time in the world ...

Eventually...

He draws relaxedly on his cigarette...

He moves towards the seated figure...

OLD MAN PEANUT joins MAL by the figure...

They are joined by ARCHIE...

He indicates COLIN who remains seated.

They watch as the figure twitches, winces, evades imagined

blows ... Eventually

The men look at COLIN...

ARCHIE and MEREDITH look at each other...

The men begin to leave ... OLD MAN PEANUT approaches COLIN...

OLD MAN PEANUT leaves the room ... the door is closed ...

long pause ... eventually ...

He glances at the wardrobe                                         *

The door opens and ARCHIE pops his heap in...                      *

ARCHIE goes, closing the door...

Bare floorboards. Bare walls. Dim lighting. The colours grey,

brown, ochre, dirty cream, black,- Sombre... At the far end

is a dilapidated front door... To the right of rotting stairs

with broken, wooden banisters... MEREDITH sits smoking on top

of a knack ered upr ight pia no . .. O LD M AN P EANU T si ts

grouchily on the keys... MAL, partly hidden, sits smoking on

the stairs ... ARCHIE is gently closing the door to the main

room ... walking up the corridor towards the men/us...

COLIN and LOVERBOY as before...

THE FIGURE, slowly nods

Slowly COLIN goes towards the figure... Stands in front of

it... Stares at i t...

Suddenly his hands grab at the black plastic- he roughly

tears it open eventually revealing the bloody vest and pant-

ed body ... Now he slowly lifts the crumpled Tesco bag from

the head and we see the bowed, beaten face of LOVERBOY, early

30's ... Eventually...

COLIN slowly returns to his seat ... Uncaps the brandy ...

Pours some into the cap and drinks it...

LOVERBOY gradually, painfully, lifts his bowed head ...

Slowly, very slowly, he turns ... And looks at COLIN ...

They look at each other...

His face is blank. Heartless. Matter of fact. Grizzled.

Cold. His eyes dull. Black. Stony ... He is thick set... Bear-

like... He wears a scruffy tweed coat ... A flat working man's

cap a thick, battered gypsy belt-and he is busy bundling a

live cockerel into the Hessian sack before him ... In with

the snake ... In with the dog ... In with the man - the

beaten, terrified, whimpering man in the sack...the four

creatures in there together ... Pandemonium in the sack as he

ties it off ... Brutishly dragging the hellish parcel to the

edge of the pier-and lazily booting it into the dark sea

below .. . He tur ns now . .. His task com pleted . .. And

couldn't give a monkeys as he looks with zero compassion down

the barrel of the camera at us... He walks off, disappearing

into the foggy night ... This was BRIGHTON BILLY...

In the gloomy dirty, silent water the tethered sack descends

... Hellish movement inside...

The men as before ... Eventually...

Silence- eventually...

C/U on a bejewelled, golden goblet of red wine on a marble

surface... Now a many braceleted beautiful arm and heavily

ringed hand of a woman comes into view... Powder is gently

poured into the goblet...

We are C/U on the back of a head of extremely long hair,-the

same ringed hands wielding scissors, frenziedly hack and chop

in a flurry of hair barbarism!

We see SAMSON... 6'5"... Hunky, handsome, beefcake... His

hair cut superman-style ... Going beserk! ... Smashing the

roo m up .. . Wa il ing .. . Sc rea mi ng .. . H ow li ng ... W it h

displeasure at his new style...

SAMSON, chained up, sporting a pudding basin cut ... His bare

back being lashed by TWO BURLY, UNIFORMED SOLDIERS ... Crack!

Crack! Crack!.. Over this we hear...

C/U on SAMSON'S agonised face as he's being whipped, his hair

something of a `bob'... Over this we hear...

C/U on SAMSON'S agonised face as he's being whipped, his hair

somewhat 'pageboy'... Over this we hear...

SAMSON. Long haired, chained up alone in the, dungeon ...

Presently the sound of the heavy door being unbolted ...

Slowly it eases open ... And there stands DELILAH, tears in

her eyes...

She throws herself on him ... Is all over him ... Smothering

him with kisses ... We see SAMSON'S harsh, hard, set face as

he's being kissed...

Sud de nl y t he c ha ine d up S AMS ON s pu rns t he r epe nt an t

DELILAH... He lashes out with his sandaled, foot ... And

boots her across the room ... She lands like a sack of

potatoes against the wall...

MUSIC 'CANNED HEAT' BY JAMIROQUAI...

Lavish, debauched frivolities- PHILISTINES, MACEDONIANS,

PERSIANS ETC having a ball...to one side of the dance floor

we see the forlorn figure of SAMSON...

We see this ... Liberties being taken with poor SAMSON ...

Women teasing him ... Dwarfs kicking -him ... A camp chap in

a robe lifting SAMSON'S tunic to reveal his undergarments-

SAMSON, somewhat mincily, twists and writhes, squirms, in a

vain attempt to protect his modesty ... But it is hopeless

... The tau nter s s quea l w ith del ight at his pa thet ic

plight... .

SAMSON, incensed, begins to push mightily against the pillars

-his face a mask of crazed revenge

OLD MAN PEANUT is determinedly pushing against the walls of

the hallway ... The others, slightly bored, vaguely amused,

watch him...

Chaos... Panic stricken party-goers fleeing in terror...

Rushing towards and past the camera... Behind them the temple

in ruins ... People crushed ... Limbs sticking out of the

rubble...

MUSIC begins "THIS & THAT" by TOM JONES...

MUSIC CONTINUES-...

LOVERBOY is as before ... We see the back of COLIN as he

leans on the mantelpiece ... Deep in thought...

THE MUSIC CONTINUES...

The streets deserted.....    Bleak.... Drizzly....    Foreboding

THE MUSIC CONTINUES...

COLIN sits in front of LOVERBOY... staring intently at him...

THE MUSIC CONTINUES...

The stre ets seem ingl y de sert ed... . B leak .... Driz zly... .

Foreboding.... We become aware of the gentle clicking of high

heel shoes...

THE MUSIC CONTINUES-

COLIN stands directly behind LOVERBOY ... staring down

murderously at him...

COLIN slowly lifts his head ... and stares down the barrel of

the camera...

C/U on OLD MAN PEANUT...

THE MUSIC STOPS.

COLIN staring darkly at LOVERBOY...

We enter the bedroom just behind COLIN ... He looks over his

shoulder ... Talks/refers directly to camera/LOVERBOY ...

LOVERBOY with his eyes shut ... COLIN, upset, opposite...

He turns...and we now see the others back in the room ...

But... LIZ's head is on MEREDITH'S body she smokes ...

MEREDITH'S head is on ARCHIE'S body he leans on the

mantelpiece ... ARCHIE'S head is on MAL's body standing ...

MAL's head is OLD MAN PEANUT's body sitting...

C/U on COLIN'S face ... He can't believe it ... Addresses

the MEREDITH/LIZ person

But this figure does not reply ... The response comes from

the LIZ/MEREDITH combo...

COLIN confused ... Fascinated ... Scared ... Especially by

the relaxed, cross legged, smoking, sexy-bodied, feminine

form disturbingly topped with the nasty old head of OLD MAN

PEANUT ... it speaks...

We take in the splendor of a grand old stately house...Over

this we hear...

We now see MEREDITH.... Immaculate in a dove grey

chauffeur's uniform - below the window ... On the

impressive gravel drive ... Tending to an orange coloured

Bentley... Over this we hear...

We see the upper regency window ... Behind it, staring

through, looking down, is LIZ ... Wearing electric pink

jodhpurs ... Leaf-green, silk, blouse and stock ... Riding

boots ... Her face spectacularly made up - severe.... Over

this we hear...

MEREDITH stops waxing ... LIZ at the window staring down...

he does not look at her...

He takes out a pack of cigarettes- studies the box with

mild disapproval...

Suddenly Mal is the chauffeur -looking as though he's                 *

dressed in a hurry...                                                 *

We see LIZ at the window... She is slowly, erotically,

flagrantly, licking the glass...

Now he turns ... C/U on him as he looks up at the window

and stares ... Over this we hear...

All in the room...'normal! Again...MAL snaps a piece of

chocolate off a bar and hands it to ARCHIE...

They all laugh...                                                         *

MEREDITH smiles... Eventually looks at COLIN.                             *

We are at the foot of the stairs ... can hear footsteps

descending ... and now OLD MAN PEANUT appears ... carrying

a battered old suitcase ... he opens the heavy, wooden,

studded, creaking, dungeon door and enters ... we see a

figure, trussed up in bin bags and with an old Tesco bag on

its head hanging from a meat-hook ... it struggles...OLD

MAN PEANUT slams down the case ... opens it ... inside a

jumbled variety of rusty tools /gadgets/ implements....

from the tangled hardware he manages to extract a thick,

rusty file ... an ancient heavy plane...a mallet-and a six

inch nail ... uttering to himself...

All in the room...COLIN on his feet. his blood up...

She stares at him...

She stares at him...

At this moment LOVERBOY shifts ever so slightly in his chair

to ease his discomfort... COLIN flips...

LIZ staring at him...

COLIN staring at her...

A car has parked on the motorway... It's door ajar... The DRIVER

is hurriedly/scrambling down the muddy grass verge... Towards

the body of LIZ... She turns her head slowly and with great

difficulty towards him...

Chaos... Violence... Terror... Screaming... LIZ, battered, scrambling

around on the kitchen floor... COLIN, mad, grabbing a knife...

After her... On her... Screaming in her face... Insane... With

rage... Fighting... Struggling... LIZ somehow managing to squeeze

through the kitchen door... COLIN after her like a fiend... Her

going down again... Him stamping on her... Kicking... Booting... Like

she's the worst dog in the world... Horrific... Horrendous...

Horrible... He's going to kill her... A howling, wounded beast...

he r la s t ve st i ge o f s tr en gt h ... F o rc in g h er se lf up ...

Running/scrambling in absolute terror... Through the lounge...

Banging off walls and furniture... And still he's in pursuit...

Her life's going to end here... She takes her chances... Runs at

it... To get away... runs at it... Running at the window...

Straight at the window... And crashing through... And down... And

COLIN shocked... And can't believe it... and horrified... And

brought closer to his senses... Him going to it... going to the

shattered window... A weak man... Trembling... And frightened...

And holding onto the window frame to stay upright... And

looking out... And down... And seeing her getting up and

struggling... And limping... And broken... And bleeding... And

running away... Running away... Fleeing... From him... From the

monster at the window... From COLIN...

We are on COLIN's face... His heartbroken face... Awash with

tears... Real tears... Tears for her... For LIZ... We pull back

slowly and see COLIN on the floor by LOVERBOY's chair...

Holding on to LOVERBOY's knees/legs... Desperately holding on...

LOVERBOY looking down on him... LOVERBOY's bruised, beaten

face loo kin g do wn on h is `tor tur er'... B ut w ith gre at

compassion... With huge feeling... His own eyes filling with

tears... And COLIN holding on... And sobbing and sobbing and

sobbing... C/U on LOVERBOY's bruised and bloody hand as it

hangs limp by his side... Slowly, painfully, it begins to

move... To reach out... Inches closer to poor COLIN... Gently,

soft ly, ten der ly LOVE RBOY pla ces his hand on COLI N's

anguished head... So softly... So gently...

MAL, MEREDITH, ARCHIE and OLD MAN PEANUT waiting in the hall...

They sit in silence... Eventually...

They enter the room...

The men file in... COLIN sits in one of the armchairs... LOVERBOY

sits with his head bowed...

COLIN does not reply...

COLIN smiles...

COLIN dips his head... bites his lip... sadly nods...

Pause... COLIN stares at LOVERBOY... Stares... Stares...   Then slowly

looks away... Eventually...

LOVERBOY does not move... pause...

LO VE R BO Y s hi ft s i n hi s s ea t ... OL D M AN P E AN UT s n or ts

derisively...

LOVERBOY, with great difficulty, gets to his feet...

LOVERBOY struggles to walk... Shuffles on painful legs... The

black plastic bin bags trail around him...

LOVERBOY, very slowly, begins to cross the room... But he is

not heading for the door... He is heading towards ARCHIE...

The men chuckle... LOVERBOY reaches ARCHIE and with extreme

gratitude he takes ARCHIE's hand...

LOVERBOY shuffles to the door...

LOVERBOY stops...

LOVERBOY turns...

LOVERBOY slowly shakes his head...

LOVERBOY goes...

Pause... Slowly the door is closed...   The men sit in silence...

Eventually...

Slight pause...

The men all leave... We hear the front door closing...       COLIN

sits there... Alone in the room... Sits there...                           *

He slowly gets up... Slowly puts his raincoat on... Goes to                *

the door... Stops... Does not turn... We are on his back... His

head bowed...

He goes...

We take in the empty room... See the open wardrobe... hear

the front door open...

OLD MAN PEANUT squaring up to use...     Super-aggressive... Hyper-

cantankerous... Ultra-mean

He looks over his right shoulder... His POV...

A vignette of his MUM and HAZEL (50) sitting on an old

sofa, drinking tea and chatting happily... Behind them on a

floral wallpapered wall is a painting -- Spanish/Woolworth's

style... Carmenesque... A wounded 18th Century soldier is

slumped in a chair being tended to by a wild, exotic,

gypsy, flamenco-type woman... Nearby, standing alarmed,

humiliated and cuckolded wearing a white frilly, puffy-

sleeved shirt, red breeches with a gold stripe, black

boots, is the shocked faced husband... These three

characters bearing an uncanny resemblance to guess who?...

C/U on ARCHIE as he turns back to look at us... (the vignette

has gone)...

We can just see part of MAL... His face half in shadow... He

is looking at us... Edgy... Defensive... Dodgy... He slips into the

shadows... Is gone...

CUT                                                                        *

COLIN emerges onto the street... Closes the door behind

him... We move in on his brave/sad face as he gazes up at

the old, bluey, London sky, and says to Liz's spirit...

Slowly he begins to walk the wet street... Away from us...

Towards his new life...

THE END
