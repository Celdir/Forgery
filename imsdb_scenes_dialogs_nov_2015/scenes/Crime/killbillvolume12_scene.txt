OVER BLACK

We hear labored breathing.

BLACK FRAME

QUOTE APPEARS:

QUOTE FADES OUT

WE STAY ON BLACK

...breathing continues...

Then a MAN'S VOICE talks over the breathing;

BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN

lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has

just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her

face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W

turning the red blood into black blood.

A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME

holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the

corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the

young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice

speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the

audience.

But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that

shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the

"BILL" of the title.

In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes

were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the

planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters.

And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he

corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.

He continues wiping away the blood.

OVERHEAD SHOT

We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on

the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others

in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is

male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.

We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated

by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending

on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a

white bridal gown.

This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she

will only be referred to as The BRIDE.

Back to CU of The BRIDE.

The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.

While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in

the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and

says;

After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride

receives a bullet in the side of her head.

BLACK SCREEN: Presentation Credit

B/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death.

The BRIDE speaks to us in a VO;

CU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two

bullet holes in her.

CU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still

clutched in her dead fist.

AN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower

print dress.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ.

A YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF.

And then finally, The Bride.

We do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal

gown

To

The Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the

asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the

past, because she looks like a million dollars

now.......three million even.

INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia

convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A

PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her.

TITLE SEQUENCE

As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the

soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the

Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax.

The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home.

BLACK FRAME

TITLE APPEARS:

EX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR

WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A

CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR

She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on

something.

The BRIDE'S POV:

A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of

Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the

driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle

the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The

BELLS" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't

see ice cream truck bells.

SUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM:

We hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks

into the shot, heading for the front door.

EX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY

The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the

same age as The Bride stands in the doorway.

The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the

blonde on her doorstep.

The BRIDE

on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her

eyes.

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE

(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see

it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding

chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four

people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the

face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.

The BRIDE ON THE PORCH

We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS

LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme

throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies

it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens

to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme

plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When

the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.

INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY

The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of

the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of

the sofa.

These two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER

the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing

together on the plush carpet.

The HOUSEWIFE

KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the

small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and

the mail is kept.

The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a

FLYING TACKLE from behind by The Bride that sends them both

into........

An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has

framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a

collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the

negro experience in the American military. Starting with a

plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro

troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers

fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war,

the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and

finally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH

THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.

They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked

in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...

When The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.

The HOUSEWIFE

hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and

comes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.

The BRIDE

rises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath

hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,

double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what

Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)

The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally

demolished living room.

The two    woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each

looking    like they know how to use it, each waiting for the

other to    make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep

into the    other one.

Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women

locked in life and death combat......

....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD

LITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.

The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat

concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year

old's voice. The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to

the eyes of The Bride.

The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay."

The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons

behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks

into the newly destroyed living room.

The Housewife switches to her mommy voice.

The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the

condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a

bar room brawl.

She says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries

to enter the living room.

The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living

room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like

she's been fighting.

The Bride smiles at the confused Little Girl.

* Whenever during the picture somebody says The Bride's real

name, it will be BLEEPED OUT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, ...that is,

till I want you to know. *

The shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she

just stares at the blond lady.

Nikki still says nothing, only stares.

The child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself.

The little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the

door of her bedroom.

The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat

both finished.

The two women move into the kitchen. The Bride re-sheaths her

SOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the

drawer.

The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife

pours both of them coffee.

As The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's

VOICEOVER ON THE SOUNDTRACK:

The two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking

coffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs.

Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with

low volume;

She pauses for effect -- the ham.

Vernita says her name;

The blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face.

The B-word stops Vernita short, almost like a cold-handed

slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as

well).

Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.

As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl

for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.

Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a

box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom."

As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand

inside the cereal box.

Vernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The

Bride....

.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS

the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO

SMITHEREENS.

The Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR....

Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES

again...

...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...

...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her

back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT

INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and

the kitchen counter.

While her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to

the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's

grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH

THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel

entering Vernita's abdomen.

The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker

pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.

Vernita dies.

The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki

standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her

mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she

sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife

still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The

little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her

stare.

As she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already

stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL"

sewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood

off her    blade.

And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride

walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to

her mourning.

EXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY

The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her

vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she

makes here getaway.

She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words

"Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a

pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a

page that's headline reads;

On the pager are five names numbered going down the page

written in red ink.

The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink.

The second name on the list is;

The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through

Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of

the residential district.

Although we're only in a tight CU, we can tell a few things:

one, she's in her hospital room; two, she's alone; three,

it's night; and four, one hellva RAINSTORM is pounding

outside.

EXT. EL PASO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The rain pisses down in buckets in front of the hospital...

The wheel to an Alfa Romeo rolls into FRAME and stops.

The car door opens and two yellow galoshes step out into the

Elle standing over The Bride's hospital bed, says to her;

As she lifts the syringe off the tray....

Her cell phone RINGS....

She curses to herself...there can be only one person on the

other end....she answers it.

The female assassin turns away from the wide-eyed stare of

The Bride, and paces the hospital room talking in the cell

phone.

Elle pauses as Bill on the other line has his say. We don't

hear his side, we stay with Elle as he talks. We can tell by

her face, he's making some sense. After awhile she answers

back;

The female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at The

comatose Bride with the open eyes. Even though her face is

expressionless, she almost seems to be smiling.

Elle leans closer to the Bride's face.

The Bride does one of her motor reflex functions...She SPITS

in Elle's face.

Elle springs up, wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down

at The comatose Bride in her bed.

She grabs The Bride by the front of her hospital gown...

....Yanks Her up to a sitting position...

...And PUNCHES her hard in the face three times.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The CAMERA is in a corner of the ceiling, looking down on the

THE BARREL EXPLODES LEAT AT US - BANG!

QUICK CUT BACK TO The BRIDE IN HER HOSPITAL BED,

BANK still echoing in her ears. She lets out a SCREAM OF PAIN

and her hand goes to the side of her head, as if she were

just shot.

Her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her

skull where the hole was. She knocks against it with her

knuckle...it goes...TINK...TINK.

Suddenly she says out loud;

Her hand goes down to her belly, unly to find it not swollen

but flat. She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown

and sees a JAGGED SCAR which runs down her abdomen. Her

fingertips trace it.

She quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the

lines.

MACRO CU The LINES IN HER PALM look like a road map.

She stops counting, shocked;

She counts again.

The Bride's two eyes fill with tears as she realizes her baby

is long gone.

WHEN SUDDENLY...

She hears the STEP...STEP...STEP...OF BILL'S BOOTS WALKING

TOWARDS HER ROOM....

WE SEE THE CINEMATIC EQUIVALENT OF A COMIC BOOK THOUGHT

BALLOON by her head. INSIDE OF IT WE SEE BILL'S BLACK BOOTS

walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (THE BRIDE'S FLOOR) - NIGHT

We see a HOSPITAL ORDERLY'S bright red and white Reeboks

softly slapping against the smooth surface of the

institution's floor. They make a sound nothing like Bill's

shoes.

The BRIDE listening to them            Orderly's Reeboks walking

getting closer. WE HEAR the            down the hospital

STEP...STEP...STEP...in time           corridor.

with Orderly's sneakers.

The Bride HEARS BILL'S

VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY;

The Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets

her bearings, is to play possum.    She throws    herself back down

on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room.

They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in

her bed in her coma.

She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare.

Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of

her, creates a slightly different effect.

The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for

what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when

The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE

BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY.

The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her

hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind

of a "TA-DA" presentation of her vagina.

Trucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren)

fronts.

CU The BRIDE

EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being

exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her

trying-to-be expressionless face, "I've seen a fuck load

better than you, fatass."

The Truckers pay the bill of fare.

As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the

rules;

The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and

turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline

in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren.

And with that, The Orderly's gone.

The BRIDE'S POV:

As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren

begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly.

While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV

BLINKS.

Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles.

Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride.

Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald.

Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT

Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door.

THEN...

He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE

A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says;

More falsetto SCREAMS behind the door...

THEN...

The HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected.

INT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His

buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The

Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma.

He moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose

Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the

front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the

I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT

AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into

scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE.

She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor.

The BRIDE

upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last

five years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the

bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and

tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE

CRASH BELOW FRAME.

The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work.

Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning

top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl

to do?

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out.

BACK TO The BRIDE

She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room...

STEP...STEP...STEP...

She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached

to his belt. Her hands removes it.

The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red

Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor.

CU The BRIDE

She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU.

The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.

The ORDERLY'S POV:

He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead

Truckers on the floor, and no Bride.

WE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past

shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE

The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his

ankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He

steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and

SLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons.

The STANDING ORDERLY

lets out a "YELP," adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

IMPACT CUT

The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned.

The BRIDE (Confined to the floor)

crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor,

placing his melon head between the door and the door frame.

Then taking the door in her right hand.

SLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR

FRAME.

The ORDERLY

lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in

both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind,

since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at

The comatose Bride asking him questions.

He screams.

Suddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck,

that she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill. She snatches it

from around his neck.

Then The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the

Orderly's hand - one spelling "B.U.C.K." on each finger of

his left hand. And another spelling "F.U.C.K." on the fingers

of his right.

The Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she

does this A SPECIAL THEME MUSIC WILL PLAY (We'll call it her

REMEMBERING THEME).

WE DO A    QUICK SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM INTO HER EYES -

We see    Buck enter her room that first night, five years

ago....    He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights

you use    in a tent when camping. -- It gives off a soft blue

light.    Buck examines The Bride through the blue.

He starts to unbuckle his belt.

WE ZOOM OUT OF HER EYES INTO A CU. The REMEMBERING THEME CUTS

OFF. She looks down at Buck and says;

A "how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face.

The Bride looks down at him....The VENGEANCE THEME BEGINS

PLAYING LOUDLY ON The SOUNDTRACK, and the VEIN IN HER

FOREHEAD BECOMES PRONOUNCED and begins to PULSATE IN TIME

WITH The MUSIC. Every time The Bride comes face to face with

a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid

movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic

anticipation of the carnage to come...

...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this

Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land.

She searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown

wallet that says on it, "BIG    EL PASO    PIMPIN," loaded with

lettuce. She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup

truck key chain that has the    words,    "Pussy Wagon" on it

written in a pimpy font. She    gathers    up all these items, and

Gerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly

uniform.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot

open, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a

wheelchair.

She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her

arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars,

looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops.

What made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4

hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side,

and the words, "PUSSY WAGON," written along the flat-bed

hatch door. Pimpy font.

The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand.

EX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns.

EX CU TRUCK DOOR LOCK POPS UP OPEN.

INT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup

truck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away.

It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES.

Now The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat.

Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's

still stuck hiding in the hospital.    And until she regains

full use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin

anywhere or doin anything.

Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the

door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her,

her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky,

the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her

strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO HER FACE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO FACE.

Toe doesn't move an inch.

It doesn't move.

CU O-REN (11-years old), hiding under a bed, watching...

...her FATHER (dressed in the uniform of a sergeant for the

American Army) fighting THREE YAKUZA GANGSTERS. He kills one

with his bare hands. The other two slice him to death with

samurai swords...

...and her MOTHER being raped by the same men. When they

finish, they SHOOT her.

Little O-Ren watches, hidden from sight, withi the eyes and

face of a stone.

SHOCK CUT

O-REN ON TOP OF BOSS MATSUMOTO PLUNGING A HUGE KNIFE INTO HIS

CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a

geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl

uniform.

The Boss's screams cause TWO OF BOSS'S MEN to run into the

room, only to be SHOT DOWN by O-Ren, as she removes a gun

from a holster strapped to her thigh.

The 20-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII

sit on either side of him. They both wear    sashes down their

front; one reads, "Miss Panama," the other    reads, "Miss

Venezuela." As we cut to this shot, he has    both hands on each

of their bare knees. He's laughing as the    TOP OF HIS HEAD is

BLOWN OFF.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Pavement of the parking lot. We HEAR a CAR DOOR OPEN

OFFSCREEN, then The Bride's bare foot comes from above FRAME,

stepping down INTO The SHOT.

She walks around to the driver's side and climbs in.

She sticks Buck's ignition key in its slot and turns.

The truck's engine RUMBLES to life.

She spies a pair of Elvis T.C.B. SUNGLASSES lying on the

dash. She puts them on.

EXT. TEXAS STREETS/ INT. TEXAS STORES - DAY

The Bride drives Buck's big, yellow pussy wagon all over El

Paso buying supplies.

WE FOLLOW Her bare feet into a clothing store.

Her feet, legs, and ass slip into a new pair of LEVI'S.

Her hands grab a pair of CHERRY BROWN COWBOY BOOTS.

Then slips on the cowboy boots.

Chooses another TOP.

And finds a warm JACKET.

She opens Buck's "BIG EL PASO PIMPIN" wallet, and pays for

the items.

She emerges from the store wearing her new outfit, and climbs

back in the truck.

She drives, stopping at a DEPARTMENT STORE, and walking

inside.

She picks up a SHOVEL, a HAND PICKAXE, a big CAMPING

FLASHLIGHT, a MAP OF TEXAS, a writing NOTEBOOK, and a bunch

of RED and BLACK FELT PENS.

While the Bride is buying items in the department store we'll

CROSSCUT....

called, "The Texican"....

...Her Registering with the OLD BASTARD of a desk clerk,

...now submerged in the warm bathwater, by herself, perfect

MUSIC CUE ON SOUNDTRACK, she begins to cry...her poor heart

has been shattered and five years of tears come flooding out

of her.

She cries for her baby...

She cries for the motherhood robbed from her...

She cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel,

who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her

path...

She cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover...

She cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades...

She cries for the five years of life snatched from her...

She cries for the countless violations she endured while

incapacitated...

And finally, she cries for all the misery she will cause the

undeserving......enroute to Bill's retribution. Retribution

that begins the minute she steps out of this bathtub.

She curls up into a fetal position inside the tub of warm

water...weeping.

We DOLLY back...to give our heroine some privacy...WE

DISSOLVE through the bathroom door...Till we're on the other

side, filming a closed door with crying on the other side.

When she's finished shedding tears, is when she'll begin

shedding blood.

When the bathroom door opens, the woman that emerges, has

closed out all of her emotions...save from one...revenge.

It's that woman, in her new outfit, that climbs into the

yellow pussy wagon, puts the T.C.B. Sunglasses over her eyes,

and starts the engine that sets into motion the gory story to

follow.

EXT./INT. BUCK'S TRUCK DRIVING IN DESERT (MOVING) - NIGHT

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:

The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of

prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil

derrick pumping up and down.

The Bride STOPS the truck.

Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the

headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular.

She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside.

She    smiles.    If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken

it    as a sign    that her vengeance quest was never meant to be.

But    as it is    there, it would appear that fortune has smiled

on    The Bride    and her bloody intentions.

She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand

pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and

CHANGES THE MUSIC TO A POUNDING HEAVY METAL ANTHEM.

CU The BRIDE'S COWBOY BOOTS

next to the X ROCK

IN TIME WITH The METAL, The Bride's cowboy boots count out

ten paces from the rock.

When the boots stop, the flashlight ENTERS THE SHOT

illuminating the spot, THEN...the shovel ENTERS, striking

deep in the unmarked earth.

EXT. TEXAS DESERT - NIGHT

Deep in the middle of Fuck-Knows Texas, lit by the headlights

of Buck's 4x4, The Bride digs a hole in the

ground......TILL...

She HITS SOMETHING HARD.

She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the

hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is

revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth.

She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army

footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in

the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open,

she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the

rim.

Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the

department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of

her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag.

We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one.

The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

She reaches in and pulls out a PHOTOCOPY OF HER SONOGRAM.

There on the page is a photocopy of her unborn baby girl. A

fierce grimness crosses her face as she places the sonogram

back in the envelope.

1 CLEAR ZIP-LOCK BAG containing a PHONY I.D. and BANK BOOK

both w/ the name "CANDY RALSTON" on them. Reaching back in

the locker she pulls out the final item,

INT. SUSHI BAR (OKINAWA, JAPAN) - DAY

The ENTRANCE to a tiny sushi bar, covered by a Japanese

curtain....

SUBTITLE APPEARS:

....The fabric is moved aside, and The Bride enters the shot,

and the tiny establishment.

The little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word

cozy. Besides The Bride, the only other person inside is The

SUSHI CHEF, who smiles at her behind the midget bar.

This Japanese man in his mid-fifties greets the tall, blonde

western girl with a turned-on-for-the-tourists affability.

The Bride smiles at this and walks further inside. She

doesn't come across as one of the world's deadliest

assassins, but instead as a sweet, slightly airheaded,

American tourist.

The Sushi Chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise, and

says;

The Sushi Chef YELLS IN JAPANESE, to someone OFFSCREEN.

The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to

imagine there could be a back room to it.

Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling

to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride.

The Bride puts on a thinking face.

The Sushi Chef goes "Oooh" like he's just discovered the

answer to a mystery.

Saying with surprise and admiration;

The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle.

Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or

understand you, he yells the word;

And everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately

afterwards.

The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know;

He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young

blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful.

He YELLS    OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE

MAN with    a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He

heads for    the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in

Japanese,    "What she wants to drink?"

The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking.

In Japanese he YELLS/ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald

Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish.

As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he

asks;

The Sushi Chef continues slicing.....

There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he

brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth.

The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he

pours one for The Bride, then disappears again.

As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef.

As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride.

The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that

point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks;

The Bride answers in Japanese;

INT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY

The trap door in the floor opens up, and HATTORI HANZO (Sushi

Chef), climbs inside the room, followed by The Bride.

The room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand-carved

wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of

the second half of the attic.

The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel, looking and

touching the shiny wood. She looks behind her to Hanzo who is

still by the trap door, and says;

The Sushi Chef answers in ENGLISH;

She starts reaching for one...

She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath.

Her hand lifts it from the rack.

She UNSHEATHS the steel, partially....then with GREAT

FLOURISH....completely.

Hanzo's mouth froms a smile.

He pulls a baseball out of his pocket.

THEN SUDDENLY - HE THROWS THE BASEBALL HARD, right at The

Bride's head....

QUICK AS A WHIP, SHE SLICES THE BALL IN HALF, IN MID AIR.

The two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor.

He gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards

her.

Hattori Hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name,

"BILL" on it with his finger.

The blonde girl nods her head yes.

The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor,

throwing it open.

He points into a corner...

.....starts to descend....

.....before his head disappears, he says;

...he closes the door behind him.

She smiles slightly...then moves over to the window, takes

out a handkerchief, and wipes Bill's name off.

sheath. At the base of the sheath, by the handle, he's carved

the face of a lioness...

We go back and forth between CU of HANZO reciting the

doctrine like a samurai drill instructor and the Bride

repeating it.

The Bride repeats this...

The Bride repeats this...

The Bride repeats this...

The Bride repeats this...

The Bride repeats this... Her eyes look at the greatest maker

of swords on this earth and says;

EX CU The Hanzo Sword,

her white hand with her long fingers COMES INTO FRAME and

removes the beautiful, artful instrument of vengeance.

OVER BLACK

TITLE CARD:

A BLANK PIECE    OF DRAWING PAPER

A hand comes    in and, as the Bride talks over this image,

draws with a    piece of charcoal, a portrait of the geisha

regaled O-REN    ISHII.

The charcoal drawing gets color and becomes ANIMATED, turning

into a JAPAMATION O-REN...

JAPANESE ANIMATION SEQUENCE

We see Japamation-style images of The Bride's verbiage.

Japamation images of O-Ren and her Army, taking on ANOTHER

YAKUZA ARMY, among falling cherry blossoms.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH between cartoon images of this and the

real life real McCoy samurai sword battle.

O-Ren's ability is simply amazing.

INT. JAPANESE NIGHT CLUB

O-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the

city of Tokyo. The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with TWO

BODYGUARDS standing behind them, toast their new leader, with

much laughter and drinking...all except one...BOSS TANAKA.

Boss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the

alcohol-fueled frivolity.

Boss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the

plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces.

The party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the

Tanaka Crime Family.

The Bosses all react with shock and outrage...O-Ren remains

cool. She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it

for the rest of the sentence.

The BOSSES react again...O-Ren;

Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says;

Then...

Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,...

O-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed...

Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body...

The head hits the floor...

And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of

blood shoots up in the air.

The BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more

flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse.

The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to

their swords and draw them.

O-Ren turns her blade in their direction.

The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch.

The lady looks across at the two men and says in and

authoritative voice;

They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords.

They do.

They do.

They do.

They do.

You better believe they do.

The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her.

As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for

their bosses.

He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen.

She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks.

Nobody says anything.

EXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT

The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The

CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant

staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on

their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not

satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The

door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps

inside, the door is slid shut.

INT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT

The private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The

patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA

CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII.

Sitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari

sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than

O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are

dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid

skirts and matching blazers.

FLASH ON

EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's)

On her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE.

FLASH ON

EX CU OF AN EYEBALL

The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits,

white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes,

are her soldiers, "The CRAZY 88."

FLASH ON

EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move

blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way.

And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans

Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL.

They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a

joke in Japanese.

SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest,

her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's

listening to The Bride's narration.

The Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE --

O-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe

and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound.

CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono

on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.

The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost

taking off the tip of her nose in the process.

INSERT: DART EMBEDS ITSELF IN A WOOD POST.

O-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a

halt. Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to

retrieve the eavesdropper.

INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The white paper door to O-Ren's dining room SLAMS OPEN. Yuki

and Go Go step into the corridor.

All trace of the Bride has vanished.

They look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal.

Whoever was there is gone now.

Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the

Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, SLAMMING

the door behind them.

ONE SHOT

CU The BRIDE

at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. She

observes all the activity by O-Ren's private dining room.

When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off

her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the

parking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door.

Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece

yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides,

like the one Bruce Lee wears in "Game of Death." She tosses

the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo

sword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her

back inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren

dining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open

the door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to

the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki

leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the

bathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce

Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.

BACK AND FORTH

between CU's of the two women, face to face.

The Bride PUNCHES her in the face.

INT. O-REN'S PRIVATE ROOM

Aside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the

Tokyo underworld - Mistress O-Ren Ishii - and her private

army doing when we cut back?

Singing karaoke, of course.

It's Crazy 88 MIKI's turn at the mike and he's having a whale

of a good time singing Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," in

Japanese....

WHEN...

A COMMOTION is heard being made by the restaurant staff and

the other patrons, from the other side of the white paper

wall...Just as they all start to notice it, they hear;

The Crazy 88 spring to their feet. One slides open the door.

They see O-Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle

of the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand

gripped around a post. She has a terrified look on her face.

Before anybody on O-Ren's side of the room can say anything

...The Bride steps out from behind Sofie.

O-REN'S

reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned

out to be. She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's

BLEEPED OUT.

The Bride

The VENGEANCE THEME BURSTS ON THE SOUNDTRACK...The Vein on

her forehead begins to pulsate. WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS

ZOOM INTO HER EYES. A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren

beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS

SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES. The FLASHBACK DISSOLVES, we ZOOM

BACK INTO A CU, the vein stops pulsating, and the theme STOPS

PLAYING OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, LEAVING A CLEAN, COLORFUL CU of

The Bride loaded for bear.

She raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the

Shoulder with one stroke.

SOFIE

Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in

agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes

of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both

surprise and shock.

The CRAZY 88

run out into the dining area and create a human wall between

themselves and their Mistress.

MR. BARREL AND GO GO

take positions on either side of O-Ren.

O-REN

seated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet.

The Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's

blood flies off the blade.

The entire floor of the dining room lies between the two

warring parties.

The restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in

fear.

O-Ren says loudly to the room;

The Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits.

The Bride, The Crazy 88, and O-Ren hold    their ground without

moving a muscle, till the dining room,    as well as the entire

restaurant known as "The House of Blue    Leaves," is deserted

of every human not engaged in the face-   off that precedes

combat.

O-Ren gives a simple order;

MIKI, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward,

unsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde.

Raising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming A

Banzai Scream...

The Bride turns to face him.

Miki Charging and Screaming...

The Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking

Position.

Miki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her.

The Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to

arrive.

Miki arrives at his destination, he Swings...

The Bride Swings...

The Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half. Miki

looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand.

The Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then

Lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air.

Miki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end

of a spear. Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in

the B.G.

O-Ren and her crew watch stunned.

The Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that

starts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge

blue splash. Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish -

Red blood - Dead man.

The BRIDE

looks up from the pond, across the length of the    floor, into

the eyes of O-Ren Ishii.

She takes one step forward, hears the slightest    noise, Twirls

the samurai sword in the air once, drops to one    knee, and

thrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-   covered

floor. The sword sticks in the floor half way...

The Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor...

OVERHEAD SHOT

Looking down on The    Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew

at the other. A Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried

in the floor...The    red circle grows larger...and larger...and

larger...and larger    still...

Leaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking

straight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee,

and straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo

underworld.

O-Ren

her eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;

The six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same

time with a GREAT SOUND EFFECT.

They circle the Bride.

The BRIDE

Inside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her. She Whips

the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in

front of her. Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel.

Holding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see

reflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her.

The six Crazy 88 Attack...

The BRIDE

does a Zatoichi-like SWISH-SLASH-SWISH with her steel blade.

Four boys die an    immediate samurai blade-inflicted death,

SCREAMING GRUNT,    TWITCHING BODY, FROZEN IN THE STANCE IT WAS

SLASHED IN, RED    BLOOD SQUIRTING FROM WOUNDS, THEN A CRASHING

COLLAPSE TO THE    FLOOR.

The last two put up more of a fight...but then one of them is

SLASHED and FALLS and the last one is SLASHED AND CRASHES

THROUGH the restaurant's big picture window.

EX CU The EYES

of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet,

...BEAT

...they Look back up at O-Ren.

O-REN

standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow.

The BRIDE

swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead

attackers flies off.

GO GO and MR. BARREL

unsheath their swords.

WHEN...

We hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then

behind her, through the broken pictures window we see

seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the

riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry

samurai swords.

The BRIDE

looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren.

O-REN

smiles.

O-Ren smiles...

Both O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,...

This is something they used to say back when they fought

alongside of each other as "Vipers."

The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the

restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride.

As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE

SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western

Stand-off.

We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround

the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one

JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE

IRON over his head.

As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of

The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword

Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc...

....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point...

...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN

TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE

ON SCREEN.

As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms

flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde

hair whipping like a whirling dervish....

...She's a Goddess of War Venus.

Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The

Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights.

This explosion of furious violence is punctuated

CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the

fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning

the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO

OIL BLACK.

Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and

liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's

blade.

Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS

While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang

out of its holster, and Throws it...

....It Twirls Through the Air...

...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces.

The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an

Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's

Out.

The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over

her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air,

Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck.

She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the

vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from

its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.

While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her.

Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends

It Flying in the Charging Man's path...

...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground...

...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he

falls flat.

The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks

her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off.

...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands

off.

So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine

foot tall Bride fights with the others.

When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's

perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the

Bride back to the floor like an alevator.

As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders,

somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an

attacker's legs into his groin.

He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free.

ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, "The Best One." He

Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to,

"Come get a piece."

The Bride does a screaming charge towards him....

...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm -

steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to

collide.....They meet.....

SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN -

CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE -

They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a

mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither

clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm.

...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the

floor.

The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of

his chest.

Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain

alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still

holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker,

backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining

killers.

Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the

action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from

his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and

Crashes to the floor.

The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself

for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy

Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top.

She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and

feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped

over on its shell....

Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground.

...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of

her head, and Pops back up on her feet.

And then there were seven.

The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved

out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the

floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle.

The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor,

lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In

repose.

EX CU The Bride's eyes

pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE

FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood.

O-REN

WHIPS OPEN a red fan.

GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the

switch.

The room goes dark.

The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still

on the floor....

...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she

breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED

OVER HER FACE.

Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in

(Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) .....

The Bride rises to her feet...

The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a

circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in

rhythm with the Metal...

The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both

Music and The Bride Explode!

WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE

With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers

fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow

falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like

black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage.

The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue

backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and

death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all

sword-weilding partners.

She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They

seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then

CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or

hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each

encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride

crouches down low in repose while the others continue to

circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again.

We Cut in closer whenever we need to.

Finally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's

sword.

GO GO

Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the

lights back on. The electricity shines light on...

The BRIDE

Splashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls

and ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded

men who have yet to die, litter the ground.

With a big "Whoosh" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's

subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade.

Then saying to the foes who litter the ground.

The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant.

The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last

remaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren

Ishii.

Go Go

steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai

sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain.

She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a

WHOOSH sound in the air.

BALL AND CHAIN

in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us.

The BRIDE

ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk

of wood post behind her.

Go Go

eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she

lets fly...

The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo

sword...

...Go Go yanks...

...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip.

GO GO

smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

The BRIDE

removes her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go.

The BOOMERANG

TWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go.

BAM

The young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and

chain. She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on

the floor. She looks    across at her opponent...WHOOSH...

WHOOSH...WHOOSH..she    LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the

chest, knocking her    on her back...

...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the

Bride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal

ball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead.

The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its

purpose.

She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight.

Go Go hops up on a table...

As they fight they hop from table to table...

Go Go throws her ball and chain...

...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP...

BATS it away with the table leg.

Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around

the Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS...

...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL

CRASHING through another table.

Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai

short sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it.

The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly

with struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to

the Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams

as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she

rolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the

table leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER

HEAD.

The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and

delivers a powerful "C.K." to the Bride from below, dropping

her to her knees.

O-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and

begins to strangle.

The chain digs into the Bride's throat.

The Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty

looking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh.

The nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her

flesh...the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat

with them.

Go Go lets out a horrific scream.

The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young

girl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe

becomes stained with red.

Go Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the

floor.

The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins

breathing air into her lungs.

Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her...

The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's

weapon above her head.

Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second

floor...

The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the

ball and chain over her head.

Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs...

She gets to the top.

The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain...

It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari

sisters, smack DAB in the back of the head.

CU GO GO

We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind

it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit

shatter like a teapot.

Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the

staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before

the tumble began.

The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go

to the last two remaining combatants...

...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.

Mr. Barrel says;

Mr. Barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick, like from a 17th

Century costume ball, and holds it over his eyes.

O-REN ISHII

Screams at her "...last line of defense;"

O-REN

is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder.

The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she

just saw.

Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look

she's never seen from him before.

He then looks back to the Bride.

Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the

slightest hint of plea in her voice;

He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his

sword;

INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The

Handle locks into place with a Click.

He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and

says;

O-Ren fries and egg on her head.

Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left

hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn

room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel

with   the Bride, He stops and    says;

He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the

restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's

lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says;

He exits the Movie.

O-REN and The BRIDE

match eyes. The Japanese gal says;

The Bride just smiles at her rival's response.

O-Ren's composure returns.

O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire

battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the

same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white

paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING....

.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky.

A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow

falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but

Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the

doorway looking out into the white night.

The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside...

The Bride follows her...

INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT

As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance

from one another.

COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish

Flamenco Guitar.......

The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in

front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle

and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her

cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls

around her.

O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises

up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face

vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls

around her.

O-REN'S FEET

White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow

underneath them...

The BRIDE

Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers

Crunching snow underneath them...

O-REN

when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat

artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in

one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird....

....The Two Women circle each other....

They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING -

CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...

O-REN LEAPS in the air

does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her

opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing...

SLASHING The BRIDE

across her back - Spinning her around...

O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The

Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together

as the Blades become entangled...

O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that

loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into

The Bride's mouth...

Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on

her ass in a koi pond.

- The Combat Guitar Stops -

O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs;

The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises

out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly

to O-Ren in Japanese;

The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with

The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They

separate...

...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like

two locomotives...

O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The

respect for the Bride's ability is transparent.

The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again...

Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers...

Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down

legs staining White Socks with Red...

They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl

with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist -

Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off.

Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate.

As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs,

leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females

have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last.

They continue breathing...

The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle

each other for their final attack.

With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash

in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay...TILL...They Find

themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall...

...The Bride and O-Ren both begin Running diagonally through

the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing

to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their

Samurai hearts out...

UNTIL...

They both SWING...

...can't tell who got who...

A SCALP OF LONG, BLACK HAIR FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, landing in

the white snow.

CU O-REN ISHII

facing away from the Bride. Sword still in her hand. We see

she doesn't have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A touch of her BRAIN

is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops.

The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who's regime has just

ended with one swing, stares off into space.

Her sword FALLS from her grip...in the snow by her feet.

O-Ren FALLS to her knees, toppling forward.

Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says;

The Last thing she says before she dies;

With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and

she's gone.

The BRIDE

removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing

earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the

blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list,

off her Hanzo Steel.

EX CU THE HANZO SWORD

is returned back to its sheath. The LION'S HEAD that Hanzo

carved into the wood seems pleased.

The BRIDE

now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her

head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT.

SOFIE FATALE

Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her MAZDA XOXO.

The BRIDE slams the trunk, SCREEN BOES BLACK...

The MAZDA driving down the road at supersonic speed.

The BRIDE

BLACK SCREEN

The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her FRAMED in the

TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly

Viper syringe in her hand.

When she speaks it comes out of a VOICE BOX at the bottom of

the helmet. Turning her voice deeper and electronically

spooky. The two women speak Japanese to each other.

Sofie offers up her remaining arm.

She injects Sofie with the gold syringe.

Sofie is injected.

YUKI YUBARI upon hearing the news of her sister's death...

She SCREAMS!

BACK TO SOFIE

BACK TO YUKI

Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up.

BACK TO SOFIE

BACK TO YUKI

sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An OLDER JAPANESE MAN in

a business suit sits next to her at the bar...he puts the

make on her.

Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice;

She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the

business suit.

The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she

gets annoyed;

THEN...

He lets out a GRUNT coming from below.

We see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short

sword, and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen,

creating a big red grin across his mid-section.

TWO SHOT YUKI AND BUSINESS SUIT

Yuki focused, Business Suit penetrated...She opens him up

more...he feels every inch of the blade's progress.

Blade cuts deeper...

And with her last line, does the final disemboweling slice

that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor.

BACK TO SOFIE

The Bride takes this in...then moves on.

EXT. TOKYO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The big hospital of TOKYO is located by a hill by the

highway. Sofie's MAZDA pulls off the highway to the side.

The Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the

trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the

hill....Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the

huge hospital.

CU SOFIE

in a hospital environment. Bill's voice speaks to her OFF

SCREEN;

He shhhh's her off screen;

BACK TO THE BRIDE AT THE TRUNK

Then with SUPERMAN X-RAY VISION we see through the helmet to

the Bride's face inside as she says the last line.

CU of SOFIE

WE PAN to a CU of YUKI

Bill says off screen;

Yuki blows a pink bubble gum bubble, it pops and she says in

English;

CU HATTORI HANZO

He's sewing something that requires a lot of concentration.

CU The BRIDE'S BARE BACK

What he's sewing is, the NASTY SLASH O-Ren gave the Bride on

her back, closed with a simple needle and thread.

CU The BRIDE

lies naked on her stomach, head up, chin resting on her

folded hand, feeling no pain at the needle piercing her

flesh. The sleeping giant is awake, and in her eyes we see

she's filled with a terrible resolve.

As Hanzo sews, he recites in Japanese the Yagu mantra, the

Bride recites in Japanese after him.

EX CU: O-REN ISHII'S name written in the Bride's notebook

with the number one next to it. A black felt pen comes into

frame and draws a line through the name.

We stay with Yuki's side as she stops across the street from

the Bride. During their face-off we only see the Bride at a

distance.

The Bride is in the b.g., back to us packing her trunk, just

about ready to make a clean getaway...

WHEN...

Yuki yells to the figure across the street.

We see the back-turned figure of the Bride slightly freeze

upon hearing the Japanese greeting. Without turning around

she says;

THRILLER MUSIC begins on the soundtrack.

The Bride turns around to face the young avenger.

Yuki giggles.

Yuki giggles.

Yuki giggles. Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches

on the beam.

Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face.

Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face.

Yuki giggles.

Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back

and FIRES A LOUD INTENSE VOLUME of firepower at The Bride.

The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy

wagon is demolished by the ammo.

The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her

backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of

front lawns...

Yuki chases her with machine gun fire...

The Bride LEAPS over a long hedge...disappearing Behind it.

Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the

hedge...

The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and

rolls under a Volkswagen van.

Bullet FIRE EXPLODES all around the Bride as she rolls out on

the other side. She removes her 9mm automatic and returns

fire from behind the van.

Yuki yells to her in English;

She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth,

and slides it towards the Bride.

The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on

the asphalt towards her...

She takes off running...as the Volkswagen van EXPLODES BEHIND

HER.

She cuts through the backyard of a house -- THE CAMERA TAKING

OFF WITH HER -- over their fence, in the backyard over the

fence into another yard. She trips, falling into the other

house's swimming pool. Instead of splashing around, the Bride

swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow

end. Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool.

Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front

of the house. It's located on a cul de sac.

WHEN...

Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street.

Both women see the other.

Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of

her car as she speeds down the dead-end street.

The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on

the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and

automobiles.

When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,...

She jerks the wheel...

SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite

direction.

SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN...

SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN...

BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street.

In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back.

Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around.

She gets ready to make a third pass.

Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their

front door.

The Bride yells at them;

Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and

drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for

her.

The Bride runs into the house she's in front of.

She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back

door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is

hiding and they block the door.

Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands

up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and

says;

She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself

face down on the lawn.

The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters.

Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.

Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride

runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and

runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms.

Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand...

The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just

about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall...

WHEN...

Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg.

The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of

the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING --

blood pours out of her gunshots.

Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up

the house.

The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge.

Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the

hallway.

The Bride fires...

The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking

her through a bedroom doorway.

Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from

the doorway into the hallway;

The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's

giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.

She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up

everything around the Bride.

When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;

From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue

powder. It gives her energy.

Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.

Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the

Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her.

The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm.

The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat.

Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style.

Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at

Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off

her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs.

The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs.

She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead.

Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open...

Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her

schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her

head turns in the    direction of the Bride...

The Bride sees this and can't believe it...

They lock eyes...

...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a

deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that

builds to a scream...

She charges up the steps at the Bride.

The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty...

Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high...

The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her

ankle holster.

Yuki chargin...

The Bride cocks back the hammer...

...Yuki charging, getting closer...

The Bride FIRES

Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but

she keeps charging...

The Bride fires again...

Yuki jerks but keeps on charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised

high...

The Bride FIRES

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty...

The Bride fires, but her gun jams...

Yuki leaps on her with the knife...

They struggle for a moment...

...TILL...

...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the

side.

INT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT

The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a

name tag on it that reads, "B. Owens," answers the phone.

CU The Bride

on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number

written on the back that says, "B. Owens," and her phone

number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in

a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't

see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood

planks. The moon shines into the structure.

I don't know how you got my number,

but you can just rip that shit up,

because --

-- I've been shot five times --

-- Stop, I don't wanna hear no

more. I got problems of my own.

I'm dying.

Then bitch, you better call

yourself a ambulance, cause I don't

do this shit no more.

I can't call an ambulance.

--    No, you can call a ambulance,

you    just don't want to. But if your

ass    is really dying, you ain't got

no    motherfuckin choice.

I do have a choice, and I'm

choosing to call you. If you refuse

to help me, I'll die. And that will

be your choice.

Bitch, I don't even know you!

What do you need to know? I'm from

Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and

only you can help me.

Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse.

Nurse Owens likes that last line.

The Nurse hangs up the phone.

INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens.

Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor.

The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey.

INT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

OVERHEAD SHOT

The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the

nurse extracts the bullets.

The Bride screams.

The TV is turned up loud to hide the screams.

The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three

cigarette butts and other balls of lead.

The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior;

Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says;

She passes out.

EX CU SLOT IN DOOR

is slid open revealing two male eyes on the other side.

A FEMALE VOICE FROM OFF SCREEN says to the Doorman;

The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door,

and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into

a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of

the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their

luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.

One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of

the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE.

Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a

tux, waits for L.F.'s word.

L.F. laughs.

Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest.

As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five

other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai

swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his

hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the

sword;

The two men stare...

Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull

to death. He peels off two hundred.

Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it.

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.

She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer

inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.

The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.

He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;

Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.

Dropping his money roll on the table...

Color L.F. impressed.

With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes

them and inspects them.

Alburt starts to move from his position by the door.

L.F. motions him back to his position.

The players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the

table, trade quips.

Bill looks from the dice to L.F.

Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room

reacts.

Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then

throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the

money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up

his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says;

The room reacts.

He holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5...

Bill throws...5...more reaction...more money...

He shoots again, he wins again...

L.F. MOVES THE MONEY in front of him.

Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her

table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent.

In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes

go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F., casually tosses

the green on the felt and says;

-- You and nobody else. You sell at

the bar a half can of warm piss, at

twenty bucks a shot. How much did

the six-pack cost you? 5.60, 5.65?

You're greedy O'Boyle. You're just

too Goddamn greedy. You know what I

like to do when I meet greedy

people? Take every fuckin thing

they got. Leave em with nothing.

So that's your game, you want to

teach me a lesson?

I wanna    burn you    down. When I'm

through    with you,    you won't have a

pot to    piss, or a    window to throw

it out    of. You'll    thumb a ride out

of L.A.    wearing a    barrel.

I could always save myself this

horrible fate by not taking your

bet.

To be replaced by a different fate.

The embarrassing truth that you run

a gutless game. I won't forget it.

I'm sure these gentlemen won't

forget it. I'm sure they'll tell

people who won't forget it. And we

won't come back. If we don't come

back, you won't get our money.

Couple of weeks, you won't have a

game.

You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And

the idea of taking everything

you've won away, and sending you

out the door with nothing but a red

face, is so appealing to me, that I

will take your bet. But.....not

with those dice.

She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are

placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards. She sets the

dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her

stick.

Bill looks down at them.

His hand scoops the dice off the table.

He catches the young lady by surprise.

From the door Alburt says;

He throws....

....................BOXCARS.

The spectators go apeshit.

Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he

just busted.

INT. BED AREA OF HOTEL ROOM

Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone.

In the b.g. L.F. is throwing everybody out.

He looks over and L.F. is sitting on the floor of the bed.

All the players have left, only L.F. and her five tuxedo boys

remain.

He hangs up.

Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket

pocket, looking at L.F. and her boys, he says;

Without another word he exits the hotel room.

Nobody makes a move to stop him.

L.F. O'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for

the sound of the elevator in the hall.

The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack;

They hear the elevator in the hall.

L.F. O'Boyle tells her men;

Alburt smiles.

The Five men go out the door.

INT. HALLWAY HOTEL

The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to

see....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the

end.

This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.

He Charges at them.

In the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His

mastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts

through    the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,

is the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's

blade.

INT. HOTEL ROOM

L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the

front door.

She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for

that matter, to step through the doorway.

WHEN...

The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black

gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and

YANKS her out the window.

EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT

Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor),

outside L.F. O'Boyle's room.

He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side

by her hair.

L.F. Is too hysterical to answer.

He drops her......

............... SHE FALLS....

...................................SHE SPLATS.

Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her

fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge.

EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY

A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle

of a barren Texas wasteland.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image;

A fist knocks on the trailer door.

It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick

Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black

cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre.

No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle

five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live

there.

Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and

dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his

natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging

in the passenger's    seat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;

Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.

INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR

Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air

conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through

the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between

Elle and Budd.

The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits

in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand.

Bill stands.

The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention.

Bill nods his head, "yes."

Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN;

The disrespect is pain.

Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare.

Bill tries to charm his brother.

Budd chuckles.

Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself.

EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works

at.    His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than

him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had

when    they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to

the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile.

INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar. No strippin goin

on yet, just a few BARFLIES drinkin. The owner, TED, yells at

him as he walks by.

Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back,

passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks.

ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies' room and says to

him;

EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking

lot and stops.

The BRIDE

sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front

door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long

blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a

rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her

noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the

truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.

Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"

tee-shirt.

INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage

explodes into honky tonk guitar. She walks up to the bar and

oders a;

The BARTENDER gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock. As she

drinks the Texas brew...SHE....

...Watches the BAND....

...The crowd...

...Looking for Budd among the crowd...

...She sees him...

...He's the bouncer...

...She observes him...

...he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his

head to the music...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on

the soundtrack.

Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through

the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd

sitting oblivious on his stool....

WHEN...

Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling

every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over.

Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area.

The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE.

EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his

pickup on an empty highway home from work.

He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the

side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the

motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him,

hanging way back in the    dark.

Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,

trailing him.

EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper

home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.

The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out

of her windshield...

Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We

see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.

The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai

sword.

She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma

Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute

member of the audience will read the significance of her

choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The

Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she

intends to send to his maker.

She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her

skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...

THEN...

...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both

eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...

THEN...

Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,

and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.

THEN...

On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she

crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.

THEN...

Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their

fight makes a LOUD racket.

The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.

From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off

the phonograph.

From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking

out the window of the camper.

The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.

The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound

he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the

claws of a cat.

The curtain closes again.

The needle is placed back on the phonograph.

CU The BRIDE

face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her

eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins

crawling towards the trailer again.

...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the

sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.

She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of

pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on

a table.

Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,

slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.

Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted

image of Budd's feet on the floor.

She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde

hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left

hand grabs the front doorknob...

QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's

handle down hard on the door lock --

EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.

She flings the front door open...

The BRIDE'S POV:

Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back

and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a

DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.

SERGIO LEONE CU:

The Bride Blinks.

Both barrels BLAST in our face.

The BRIDE

standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and

PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.

Landing hard on her back in the dirt.

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the

needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.

Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the

trailer looking down at The Bride.

BUDD'S POV:

The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated

from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from

her throat.

Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over

The Bride.

More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.

He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.

The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,

still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,

right in ole Budd's face.

Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The

cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes

away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.

With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto

her stomach, exposing her butt.

SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both

barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.

The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any

opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back

and she lets out a SCREAM!

THEN...

Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks

a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.

THEN...

Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small

silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,

and presses one button on the panel.

INT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT

The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename

"California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout

with her COACH.

This is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass.

With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the

sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm.

Elle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth.

This gets Elle's attention.

We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange.

We cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The

Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword.

I'll give you a hundred thousand

dollars for it.

I'm sure you would. But I'll take,

one million.

Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you

were such a capitalist. I thought

drunks like yourself were beyond

such monetary concerns?

Well Elle, a million dollars buys a

whole lotta Jack.

Why then are you selling it to a

hateful bitch like me, when you

know Bill would pay more?

If I'm gonna drink myself to death,

...it won't be on Bill's dollar.

It's gonna be on yours.

What's the terms?

You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll

see you here tomorrow mornin. You

give me a million in foldin cash,

I'll give you the greatest sword

ever made by a man. How's that

sound?

Sounds like we got a deal. One

OVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...

Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be

the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN

WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)

digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot

too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but

not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed

of Budd's pickup.

The BRIDE

She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.

Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her

wrists tightly together in front of her.

A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry

brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees

stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.

She has no idea where she is.

She turns her head to the left and sees,

Back window and Cab of truck.

She turns her head to the right and sees,

Hatch Gate to flatbed.

She listens...she hears,

Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says

something to the other in Spanish...

THEN...

She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...

The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...

THEN...

We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a

coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.

BOOM...They set it down.

She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of

leaves leading in her direction...

TILL...

With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the

flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.

Revealing Budd, looking down on her.

The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.

She FALLS to the dirt HARD.

Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been

dup up.

Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of

"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of

dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;

"PAULA SCHULTZ."

Budd and Ernie stand over her.

The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only

weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.

Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in

English;

The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she

won't give it to them.

The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and

carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound

legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips

out a can of mace from his pocket.

He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her

eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.

He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the

beam.

Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.

The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine

box and place her in.

Budd puts the flashlight inside.

He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over

the coffin...

WHEN...

...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...

...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,

THEN...

...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.

THEN...

...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.

INT. PINE BOX

Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between

the lid and the box. However with each nail pounded in, more

lights is cut off...

TILL...

...the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head. The

last hammered nail obliterates that light source.

The Bride lies in TOTAL DARKNESS.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.

Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...

INT. PINE BOX

EX CU HER FINGERS turn on the flashlight.

CU The BRIDE

LIT by the flashlight beam...

BAM...

...a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making

The Bride jump...

BAM...

...More dirt. She reacts again.

BAM...

The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with

each new shovelful.

The Bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming

more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside

the pine box.

We've never seen her like this before.

She's starting to lose it...She lets out a SCREAM...She

SCREAMS again...Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the

lid...She pounds on it...Her bound feet kick up at it...She

starts to cry...She's getting hysterical...Her fingers begin

clawing at the wood lid...

TILL...

They're ripped open and bleeding...

Leaving Blood Trails on the wood.

TILL...

She exhausts herself. All this while, she's been screaming

the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth;

The Bride halts her hysteria.

She wipes    her eyes, and runs her hands down her face,

mentally    sending the little girl she became, back to wherever

she came    from. The woman we know as The Bride is back. She

talks to    herself.

She does. The Bride continues in VO;

Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.

She does. The screen goes Jet Black

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old

coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the

flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,

Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.

parts her lips...and lets out a;

This is the face of satisfaction.

Lotus Mountain.

For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the

White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The

temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But

now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All

the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,

who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some

feared as a devil...neither was wrong.

A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill

leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.

She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.

Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.

ZOOM...

The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all

alone, somewhere in the middle of China.

She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps

to Pai Mei.

INT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE

The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred

years ago, except now it's empty and dusty.

The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin

steps.

Her Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple.

PAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back;

A beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's

private chamber.

The still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back;

She climbs the wooden staircase.

INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER

PAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a

sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting

area. The Bride enters the room.

She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting

area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her

head.

* From here on end, whenever ENGLISH is spoken     by The Bride,

or every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be     spoken in

ENGLISH IN LIVE SYNCH SOUND. However, whenever     MANDARIN is

supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths     as DUBBED

ENGLISH like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky     Flick.

Pai Mei is still unseen.

Her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.

WE CUT TO PAI MEI

He's just like he was in the films earlier. Long White Hair,

Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing

White Robe. Everything's the same, except he's older, by

about a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting

area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.

This brings up The Bride's eye...She GLARES at the old man.

She lowers her eyes.

Pause...

THEN...

Pai Mei softly LAUGHS to himself, and strokes his long white

beard...

She rises.

CU The BRIDE

through the scrim, eyes down.

Pai Mei laughs to himself again;

The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. She opens the

drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged

weapon.

The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.

Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,

parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.

The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with

the sword.

He deftly moves out of the way.

The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,

with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.

Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of

Effort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out

of the sword's path.

He's amused, and Speaks while they fight;

She tries more...

He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an

open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.

She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.

Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.

She ATTACKS with a wild cat's fury.

He HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.

He LEAPS HIGH UP IN THE AIR, and LANDS STANDING on the Blade

of her Sword.

The Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe

it.

Pai Mei smiles at her and says;

He does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the

face in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD

WALL.

The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.

Pai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his

hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling

STOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.

The BRIDE'S FACE

shows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,

that she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly

amazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to

quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to

distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.

She takes the sword from him and tries again.

But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the

sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young

girl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other

arm...Poised to cut it Off.

...Then he TWISTS her arm, till the blade's against her own

throat....

...Then TWISTS again till it's against her hip...

...Then TWISTS again while KICKING her leg, till the blade's

edge is against her thigh...

He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...

...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the

stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between

her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.

He takes the sword from her grasp...

SWINGS once...

The BLADES's against her jugular.

He SWINGS twice...

The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.

He SWINGS a third time...

The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.

He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the

blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on

the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls

to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.

He CHOPS the sword in half with his hand.

Again she ATTACKS...again he eludes.

Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal

style martial arts dance.

As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;

With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her

wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in

the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He

could literally break her arm in half.

He TWISTS her wrist...

...The pain is excruciating.....

He TWISTS more...

She CRIES OUT.

Through gritted teeth, she answers;

He raises his other hand to chop off her arm.

The Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH;

He lets go of her wrist. She cradles her still-throbbing arm.

EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front

of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,

he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.

The Bride stands behind him, watching.

He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.

He turns to the new student;

He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.

The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.

Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her

scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....

INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei

concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody.

She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her

fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a

scoop of rice    with her fingers.

Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick.

She does.

THE WOOD WALL

The Bride HITTING it.

She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall,

hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her.

He walks off in a huff.

EXT. PIT - DAY

Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round

deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride).

We see one lone rat in the huge pit.

Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS

up in the sky.

A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through

it.

She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes

with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.

The BRIDE

Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu.

MORE wall....

At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.

Trying to catch the rat to no avail.

WHEN...

A golden arrow kills the rat.

She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,

looking down on her. It's sundown.

She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase)

and looks at her teacher.

She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the

golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to

her teacher.

She POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew.

Pai Mei looking down on her, says;

We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an

affirmative NOD and GRUNT.

The BRIDE'S FIST

goes through the wall.

INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE BATHROOM - DAY

Pai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub, when he

hears a noise.

She answers from outside the door;

She does, bowing to one knee.

PAI MEI and the BRIDE

looking at the hole in the wall.

She moves in front of the wall.....Takes her position...Her

right hand in a fist -- Locked and loaded into position....

With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where

she'll strike....Like she's transferring her energy into the

wood...She removes her left hand...and...STRIKES!

She hits it HARD, but her fist doesn't go through.

Her eyes sneak a look at the old man, who wears no

expression.

She does.

And when she does, she DOES it.

CU PAI MEI

he says in ENGLISH;

She immediately goes down to her knees;

He just as immediately, lifts her back up.

THEN...

He MOVES the wall one inch in front of her.

Then the old man leaves to finish his bath.

The blonde gal begins again....Fist against wood...no

effect....starting all over.

BACK TO COFFIN, SIX FEET UNDER

PITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in

Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat

of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back.

Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above

her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where

many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound

by a leather belt around her.

Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and

wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots

and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her

bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to

her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside

down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out.

Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her

wrists, till both hands are free.

She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin

lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her

nose, about three inches from her hand.

THEN...

AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins

to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her

left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy

to it...

...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST....

...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her.

With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

A crack in the lid...

AGAIN...

Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride...

AGAIN...

More dirt...

AGAIN...

Even more dirt...

AGAIN...

THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water...

THEN...

Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB -

SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting

plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.

EXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT

A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the

tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her

grave.

WHEN...

The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of

Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother

earth's womb.

Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she

rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's

air as if it were gulps of water.

DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle

on her body.

SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.

INT. DINER - NIGHT

A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG

SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer,

when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's

big picture window that makes him look twice.

SODA JERK'S POV:

Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the

Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the

world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts

character "PIG PEN." With each of her footfalls, a smaller

mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.

The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at

the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;

BLACK FRAME

TITLE CARD:

CU ELLE DRIVER

Behind the wheel of a hot black and gold Trans Am, driving

full out on top of the desert's surface. Spanish Rock coming

out of her powerful speakers.

EXT. DESERT BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

The car stops in front of Budd's camper. She shuts off the

car and the radio.

The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the

bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with

one Good Eye.

INT. BUDD'S CAMPER'S KITCHEN - DAY

Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle

sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd

stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as

he finishes telling the tale of last night.

Budd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the    name

Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her

pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and    sees

the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the

T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off.

The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the

Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair.

She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath.

Budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars

with breakfast margaritas.

Pause.

He hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. He takes a gulp.

Elle looks right at him with her eye, and says;

He looks over at Elle and grins.

Elle looks at him.

She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet.

He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open.

Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are

inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all

this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle.

He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then

another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks

down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath.

The Black Mamba opens its WIDE JAWS...and LEAPS RIGHT AT

BUDD...

...STRIKING Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession

(three times in the face, and once in the forearm).

Budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles

of money fall with him.

Elle takes a sip of her Margarita.

The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator.

Elle looks down, Budd    lies on his back on the kitchen floor

at her feet. His face    is already grotesquely swollen and

white as a sheet. The    serpent's extraordinarily potent venom

makes a full-frontal    assault on the cowboys's nervous system.

Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away. She looks down

at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just

described.

Budd, dying, watches from the floor as Elle takes out her

cell phone and presses one button. The other party comes on

the line, but we never hear their side.

Budd tries to make a sound from the floor, Elle calmly places

her foot over his mouth.

WE FLASH ON

She hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man

under her shoe.

Picking up the Hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on

her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money.

CU The BLACK MAMBA

out from under the refrigerator, behind Elle...

Elle senses it. And slowly turns her head to look back..

Both Black Mamba and Elle Driver LOCK EYES...

ZOOM INTO BOTH CU's tighter and tighter, till Elle says;

The viper known as death incarnate, LEAPS at Elle.

Elle flicks her wrist slightly. She doesn't even swing the

blade. She just holds it.

The snake's head touches it, and is immediately SEPARATED

from its body.

ELLE'S EYES look down at the Japanese steel in her hand.

HANZO BLADE

a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel.

EXT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black

suitcase in her hand.

She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am, starts up the

FLIES through the air, then ROLLS OVER AND OVER about five

times in the desert sand and dirt...ending upside down.

The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of

the black and gold sports car. A smile with the slightest

hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face.

She hops out of the truck and into Budd's camper.

INT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

As she walks through the door, Budd's dead, swollen body

greets her. As does her serpent namesake, dead on the floor

from decapitation.

She begins searching the camper, quickly, for something in

particular. We don't have the slightest clue what it could

be.

The BRIDE'S POV:

She watches from a high perch, Budd practicing with a ...

SAMURAI SWORD.

The BRIDE

searching under his bed, she sees a sword on the floor,

resting in a shiny, black wood mahagony sheath. She removes

it from its hiding place.

WOOD SHEATH

Its one of Hanzo's sheaths. She opens it. It is a Hanzo

sword. Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English

words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from

Bill."

She closes the sheath, this will do. She sees a pair    of

cowboy boots. Picks one up and places the sole of the    boot

against the sole of her foot. Her feet and this man's    boot

are around the same size. She slips her dirty feet in    them.

She's good to go.

EXT. DESERT

Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the

Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck.

A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face.

Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.

The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's

home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten

years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every

footfall creating a cloud of dust.

The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other

in showdown position.

A shark smile spreads across Elle's face.

The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish.

Elle does the same.

Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde

warriors circle each other.

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE

of Pai Mei SNATCHING out Elle's eye with his Eagle's Claw.

Elle nods her head 'yes.'

Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position.

The Bride raises up her sword.

The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai

bearing.

The Bride brings her sword back into combat position.

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its

We feel a count of Two Mississippi...

ELLE,

BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's

neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit

the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an

aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle

feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the

spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a

balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the

spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED.

Elle drops the Bride's sword.

As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each

other.

The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is

escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across

at each other, the two women see the other for the first

time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as

bitches...but as sisters.

Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls

to her knees in front of The Bride....

...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against

The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's

leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the

Bride's leg.

The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and

begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.

Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have

been theirs.

glass doors and walls and the color beige.

Bill walks through the glass doors, to a lone Asian FEMALE

RECEPTIONIST, her desk is the only furniture in the lobby. In

standing by himself in the empty lobby.

As the Bride has said these things, WE'VE seen    INSERTS of her

A convertible Volkswagen Karman Ghia enters the road heading

it will get closer every second.

Bill senses something about this automobile, and throws a

glance at his sleeping child.

His cell phone RINGS, he answers it.

INT. THE BRIDE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Bride behind the wheel of the convertible, her long

blonde hair whipping in the wind, talks to Bill for the first

time in five years and six months.

He glances down at the sleeping child.

The Bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice.

She wipes her eyes. Her hand moves under her shirt,

fingertips rest on scar.

Don't ask how old she is, ask, if

she's five.

Is she five?

Aren't mothers like God, aren't you

supposed to automatically know?

I did and I do.

I want to meet her.

Have dinner with us at my hacienda

tonight. She's expecting you.

What do you mean?

I knew you were on your way, so I

told B.B. Her mommy was coming to

see her.

What have you told her about me?

That you were sick, that you were

asleep, but one day you'd wake up

and come back to her.

And she asked me, "If Mommy's been

asleep since I was born, how will

she know what I look like?" To

which I replied, "Because Mommy's

been dreaming of you." And she

said, "Then I'm gonna start

dreaming of her." So I gave her a

The EXACT PHOTO DISSOLVES OVER The Bride's face, then

DISSOLVES AWAY.

Pause....The cars get closer...

The cars will soon pass...

His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does

the same.

The cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass.

The Bride looks into the other car.

We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat.

We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill

holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our

face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF.

The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the

driver's side window EXPLODES over her head.

The two cars pass each other.

The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks

in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing

the cell phone she screams in it;

Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview.

He hangs up.

INT. WHERE HATTORI HANZO SLEEPS - JAPAN - NIGHT

Hattori Hanzo lies sleeping on his mat...

WHEN...

His phone wakes him up in the middle of the night...He

hurriedly answers it.

INT. MEXICO HOTEL - DAY

The Bride's on the phone, calling Japan, in tears.

INT. THE BRIDE DRIVING TO BILL'S VILLA

The same shot we saw during the opening credits. She's

dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one

she was bushwhacked in.

Over her CU we DISSOLVE TO A CU OF HANZO talking to her

earlier on the phone.

WE DISSOLVE BACK to The Bride.

We see the same shots as before of The Bride driving up to

Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his

front door. We see TWO BLACK-SUITED MALE SATELLITES approach

her.

Now comes the new stuff.

She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the

boot, and removes her MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN.

The two satellites freeze...

She SLIDES THE PUMP once, and FIRES.

ONE is BLOWN APART by the blast.

She SLIDES THE PUMP a second time...BLAST.

TWO buys the farm.

She slides the PUMP again...

...and BLASTS the front door, kicking it open and stepping

inside.

INT. BILL'S VILLA - NIGHT

ANOTHER BLACK-SUITED SATELLITE hurries down the stairs,

reaching for his weapon...

She FIRES the shotgun into his kneecap...

He TUMBLES down the stairs landing at her feet.

She points the shotgun straight down at his face.

She FIRES...Then moves further into the house.

Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan.

Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes

across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head

for parts unknown.

So far, so good.

She enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook

and housekeeper, Josephina.

Josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her.

She grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen

pantry.

She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway

leading to the living room.

With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she

moves down the hall. As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to

her from around the corner.

Back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end.

She pumps the slide, and TURNS THE CORNER - SHOTGUN RAISED -

READY TO FIRE...

WHEN...

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES - blink once.

EX CU HER FINGER comes off the trigger.

What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a    tuxedo,

holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her.    Standing

next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed    up in a

very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange

squirt gun, aimed at The Bride.

The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says;

Then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been

shot.

B.B. lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside

her dad...Bill falls to the floor.

B.B. parrots this.

Bill on the floor, says up to his little girl;

The little girl falls down pretend dead.

The Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them,

is truly thrown.

Bill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying

breath;

And with these last words, pretends to die.

But then while pretending to be dead, he speaks in a dramatic

narrator's voice.

B.B. raises her head off the floor and says;

The little girl's head drops back down.

Bill continues his dramatic narration;

B.B. springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says;

The Bride continues watching in gobsmackery.

Bill raises his head off the floor, and says to her in his

normal voice;

The Bride shakes off her confusion, and acts out a big death

scene fo her little girl.

She falls to the floor and pretends to die.

The little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl

in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy.

Mommy opens her eyes.

From the floor, looking up at her daughter, she speaks to her

for the first time.

They embrace each other.

The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins

to creep into her voice;

She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better

look at her.

B.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair.

All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor.

The little girl gets shy.

As she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says;

B.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the

Bride's wedding gown.

Parroting Bill;

The little girl gives a big nod, yes.

B.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes.

He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then

says to B.B.;

She says excitedly;

He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and

as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through

the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The

Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World." It's obviously one of

their songs.

INT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT

The dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father

and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.

The Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill.

Why? Where you a bad daddy?

I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad

daddy.

Our little girl learned about life

and death the other day.

You want to tell Mommy about what

happened to Emilio?

I killed him. I didn't mean to, but

I stepped on him and he stopped

moving.

Emilio was her goldfish. She came

running into my room holding the

fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy

daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said,

"Really, that's so sad. How did he

die?" And what did you say?

I stepped on him.

Actually young lady, the words you

so strategically used were, "I

accidentally stepped on him."

Right?

Yeah.

To which I queried, "And just how

did your foot accidentally find its

way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And

she told me no no no, Emilio was on

the carpet when she stepped on him.

Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And

just how did Emilio get on the

carpet? And Mommy, you would have

been real proud of her, because she

didn't lie. She said she took

Emilio out of his bowl, and put him

on the carpet. And what was Emilio

doing on the carpet, baby?

He was -- flapping.

And then you stomped on him?

Uh-huh.

And when you lifted your foot up,

what was Emilio doing then?

Nothing.

He stopped flapping, didn't he?

Uh-huh.

And you knew what that meant,

didn't you?

Uh-huh.

What did that mean?

He was dead.

She told me later, that the second

she lifted up her foot and saw him

not flapping, she knew he was dead.

Is that not the perfect visual

image of life and death? A fish

flapping on the carpet, and a fish

not flapping on the carpet. So

powerful even a five-year old child

with no concept of life and death

knew what it meant. Not only did

she know Emilio was dead, she knew

she had killed him. So she comes

running into my room, holding

Emilio in both of her little hands -

it was so cute - and she wanted me

to make Emilio better. And I asked

her, why did she step on Emilio?

And she said, she didn't know. But

I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt

Emilio, you just wanted to see what

would happen if you stepped on him,

right?

Uh-huh.

And what happens when you stomp on

Emilio, is you kill him. And you

discovered that, didn't you?

Uh-huh.

So we drove down to the beach, had

a little funeral, and gave Emilio a

burial at sea. And right now I'm

sure he's happy as can be, swimmin

around in fish heaven.

But the point being, our child

learned two very important lessons.

One, about life and death. The

other, somethings once you do, they

can't be undone. I knew just how

she felt

You loved Emilio, didn't you?

Uh-huh.

Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I

did to Mommy what you did to

Emilio.

You stomped on Mommy?

Worse.

I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot,

like we were just doing. I shot her

for real.

Why?

I don't know.

Did you want to see what would

happen?

No, I   knew what   would happen to

Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't

know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what

would   happen to   me.

What happened?

EXT. PORCH - DAWN

Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house

drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and

the sea.

Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps

across from him.

Between them the dawn sky breaks.

He holds up the bottle of vino.

She shakes her blonde head, no.

She gives him a look.

She shakes her blonde head, yes.

She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.

She gives him another look.

Bill drinks some wine.

The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts

will be shown on the screen.

To give herself a running start with the story she starts it

off in Japanese;

Bill interrupts her.

The Bride explodes;

What the hell do you care what I

talk in? Don't you know when to

keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to

tell you what you want to know, if

you'll just shut up and listen and

stop talking! Now may I continue?

You're right, I'm wrong, continue.

The morning I left, I threw up. I

don't feel like speaking in

Japanese anymore - on the plane, I

threw up. When I got to my hotel, I

threw up. So naturally I started

thinking, maybe I might be

pregnant. So I bought one of those

home pregnancy kits. Went back to

my room and took the test. The

little strip said blue. I was going

to have a baby. I tried to call

you, but you weren't there, so I

just thought I'd call back later.

But you never did.

- Would you shut up, I'm trying to

tell you how I feel.

My apologies, please continue.

So I just figured I'd call you back

later. I was just so happy, I put

on music and danced by myself in

the hotel suite, holding my little

blue strip.

What I didn't know, was at some leg

of my journey, I was spotted. With

me in Los Angeles it didn't take

Lisa Wong long to figure out

someone put a hit out on her. So

she sent an assassin of her own to

There's a knock on the hotel room door.

The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.

PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt

outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.

The Bride says through the door;

Seeing it through the peephole.

As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she

bends down to pick it up...

WHEN...

A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the

bent over woman was previously standing.

Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.

The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.

Karen aims the shotgun down at her.

With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.

It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.

The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.

Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES

the shotgun The Bride's way.

The Bride DIVES out of the way.

The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.

The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,

and THROWS IT across the room at Karen...

Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade

sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,

and drops it to the floor.

The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do

except wait to get shot.

She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...

Karen stops.

Karen looks at her, "what?".

Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the

floor.

The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off

the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the

directions on the box.

It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.

Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she

leaves, she says;

BACK ON THE PORCH

Starting to get mad.

She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her

turn.

Bill listens stoney, then;

The Bride listens stoney, then;

That's his explanation.

She hears it.

They both understand one another.

They both laugh.

She nods her head, yes.

EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING

As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach,

The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket

off, face each other in a combat stance.

The BRIDE

Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in

its sheath.

BILL

stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his

student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to

use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up.

Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He

removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.

WIDE SHOT

The two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend

to charge/attack...stand in showdown stance.

The BRIDE

The VENGEANCE THEME EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

She takes her combat stance. But what she doesn't do is

remove her sword from its wood sheath. The fist of her left

hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. Her right

empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill.

Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in

Japanese;

She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a

standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an

eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for

his attack.

He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat

grip, to charge her.

He screams a samurai scream...and charges her...

She stands motionless...

Unblinking...

Watching him coming...

No fear....

No expression...

We go back and forth, close, wide, low.

TILL...

They meet...

Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its

grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at

her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his

sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each

other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,

and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.

Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His

body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up

a little blood...he looks at her.

Their faces are very close...

The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our

eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with

compassion.

She doesn't have an answer.

She looks at him apologetically;

He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;

They smile at each other.

Then...

Bill turns his back to her...

And walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each

step his heart swells, on the fifth...

It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout...

He falls to the beach...dead.

The Bride walks over to his body.

She unsheaths her Hanzo sword.

Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth.

She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the

tiniest of crimson smudges.

She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's

blood from off the blade onto the white cloth.

She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body.

The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this

purpose, has come to the end of its journey.

Beatrix, in a moment    of enormous generosity, allows herself,

one final tear, shed    for her corrupter, her enemy, the father

of her child,...her    MAN. The tear is for her as well. For

she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any other

man's WOMAN.

EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath.

EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek.

The blade disappears inside the sheath.

The teardrop falls of her chin.

Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished

business, is completed.

The Bride exits the beach.

Bill doesn't.

SERIES OF SHOTS END FILM

As a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack.

We see the Bride, get B.B.

The Bride and B.B. are driving away.

The Bride and B.B. eating in a coffee shop.

The Bride and B.B. in a motel room. They both wear bath

towels and both of their blonde heads are wet. The Bride sits

The Bride spooning B.B. from behind, both of them are asleep.

It's the morning...

B.B. Sits on the motel room bed, watching Saturday morning

cartoons on T.V.

INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - MORNING

The Bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying

her eyes out.

She shoves a towel in her mouth so B.B. won't hear her.

We wonder for a moment what's wrong...

Till we see her face in CU...

Her tears are tears of joy.

She can't believe this is even happening.

Her daughter is alive. They're together. They get to begin

again.

She covers her mouth so B.B. won't hear her crying and get

worried or confused.

But as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel

room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes,

happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought. Over

and over again....

Thank you god...thank you god...thank you god...thank you

god.

She washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she

walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby,

hugs her from behind as the two watch Saturday morning

cartoons.
