The screen is black. First we hear the sound of a

single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes

faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow

streets of some old hill village in Sicily. Now,

confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us

and another, and as our surroundings become more

visible, we discover that we are moving through a

pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,.

suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves

on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe.

It is a clear, cold morning in September of Nineteen

Fifty-nine. We now see the Corleone compound at

lakeside, half-hidden by pines and firs. We move

toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past

the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard

dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main

house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by

a Chauffeur and a pair. of large dark-headed men named

Al Neri and Rocco Lampone. Rocco limps slightly.

As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the

car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom

Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business

suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house

and looks off.

HAGEN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE LAKE AND LKSIDE

Standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy,.

Tony Adams Corleone, aged about ten. The boy, dressed

for travel, is looking off at the lake, his back to-

passes through.

breathing rhythms; a hand-held device with electrodes

which measures changes in perspiration or galvanic skin

through the newsroom with its teletypes and general

sense of activity. A Cameraman comes up to her:

We follow her out of the newsroom, dawn a hallway and

around a corner and in through a. door rrar!ced, "Projec-

Elizabeth comes into the projection room, pausing in

the doorway as her eyes adjust to the change in light.

We see that Tony, in miform, is the only otter person

in the projection 'roem. Tony takes out a cigarette

lighter.

Here.

As Tony flicks the lighter on:

Thank you.

My name's Adams. Tony Adams.

Z know who you are Miss Dunne.

As Elizabeth finds a seat, we see that what is being

run i.n this Projection room is an interview ime-troreen

Elizabeth and a large, attractive, Latin-American

political leader named Arnando. ?Tidal. They sit to-

On the screen the scene has shifted to an attractive

beach area where Vidal, in a wet suit, is adjusting

his'-scuba gear preparitory to diving. Admiring child--

For a glimpse of another facet of

Armando Vidal's nat.ire, we spent the

last day at the beach at Finca del

his skills as a scuba diver -- one

of his favorite hobbies.

When will this be shown?

Sometime in the Fall.

While Elizabeth, in the projection room, is saying

this. her image on the screen has turned to the T4

This is Elizabeth Ann Dunne coming

to you from Finca del Sol where --

in an exclusive interview -- El

okay.

What are you doing about lunch?

We are close on a picture of Elizabeth and Arne

Grundellius, the Secretary of state, whom we might

remember by sight as the Speaker at Tony's gradu-

Frankie Rizzi, about 30, is driving. Frankie is the

son of Connie Corleone and Carlo Rizzi. In the back-

of pilings. The limousine drives onto the ferry.

Frankie is listening to the baseball scores. Neri is

nervously checking his watch. A few passengers are

boarding. There are no other cars.

Salf a dozen loose, Puerto Rican kids come bopping

up the automobile deck. one is listening to a radio

that he holds to his ear. He crosses up to Frankie.

One of the Puerto Rican kids is hit squarely in the

like he was hit in the chest with a baseball bat.

Prankie is out of the car, reaching for his gun. Before

he can get it clear, he is hit in the shoulder and spun

to the splintery, oily deck.

As a Puerto Rican goes to finish off Frankie, Al Neri

blows him away.

REVERSE Z.

as two other Puerto Ricans blast Neri simultaneously.

Neri's eyes go wide. He coughs.: A big, stringy sob

of blood appears in his mouth, vomits out onto his

shirtfront.

He goes down to his knees, tries to raise his grin

for one last shot. A Puerto Rican grins and putting

his gun. an inch from Neri's face, pulls thetrigger.

We have pulled back to include the buria.L services

for Neri. At the graveside are Tony, in dress blues,

Hagen, Rocco Lampone and others.

The services finish and the group breaks into smaller

informal, groupings. We move to Tom Hagen and Tony, who

have drifted to one side.

Cmberto. Michael's son. Anthony.

Youi father must be proud.

What do you think, Tom? They're

The whole thing don't make sense

to me.

All Z know is Al got a phone call

from that, nephew of his, Tommy,

who runs numbers in Staten Island.

It was something about Al's sister

being sick bad with the ptomaine or

I something. We walked right into it.

What about Tommy?

The nephew? Nobody seen him since.

Ask me he's out in the Narrows with

about eight slot machines tied

around his neck.

As Rocco Lamm pone comes up, clearly agitated:

How do you Like the ally oaf that

Maatrocima is shaking hands with Hagen,. Rocco and

Mike's son, Anthony. Sam Maatrocina.

Maatrocina holds out his hand to Tony. Tony just looks

at him coldly for an insulting split second. Maatro-

hand moves to squeeze Tony's bicep. Now he shows his

teeth in a grin

The members of the Corleone Family and some of their

the tensions of the day are beginning to ease.

We pick up Fraakie who is guiding Tony through the

Santino always liked the old place.

He picked it up after Pentangeli

knocked himself off.

Dania near ruined his appetite.

Good man though. From the old days

Tony nods. All are seating themselves as:

Would you care for a little wine?

A little Anisette? No? All right.

I've invited L berto Croce to sit

in with us-because of his strong

connections in Latin America and

in the exile comarunity down in

Florida -- and because he's a

trusted and valued friend of the

Corl eone family.

And now,, if your friends in Langley

have decided that you're not a

Russian spy, perhaps you can tell

as the nature of the service they'd

like us to perform.

It's a political assassination.

The target is Asmanda Vidal.

A,NQ1'8ER ANGLE

Santino, whose attitude has been somewhat sardonic

throughout, now breaks out in a bray of laughter.

Tony turns on his cousin, then coldly and quietly:

If it's too much for you, just say

so. M can break this off right now ---

Santino, taken aback at the cold authority in Tony's

manner, turns for support.

What did I say, for God sake.

They're locking for World War Three.

What do you think, Rocco?

As Rocco Lempone -- who walks with a limp as a souvenir

of his service in World War Two-- thinks about it, then:

You're starting to talk about a

pretty big operation. You're

going to need an assault team --

maybe two. Small arms. Ammo.

Hand grenades. Field radios. A

support network down there. You'll

have to have transportation. Stag-

ing areas.

The supplies can be made available.

How about getting them down there?

No problem. We can carry eight tons

a trip in the DC Six.

What do you think, Umberto? Can

you get your hands on a few Anti-

As x'rankie starts to rise, Hagen puts a stop to any

further discussion.

All-right. That's it.

We all agree -- except Santino --

that what Tony proposes is possible

although not. easy.

Of course, financial arrangements

will have to be worked out --

There's no problem there. Every-

thing will be handled through me

and in cash.

You can tell your friends that they

have a deal.

TONY.

Good.

Tell them this too --- what the

Corleone family wants for its part

in this operation is the uncondi-

tional pardon of Danny DeVito. And

that will have to come first.

I don't know if they'll accept that.

It's a non-negotiable condition.

Trainees and from them chooses Tony.

You.. You'd like to kill me,

wouldn't you, Sir? Well, here's

your chance.

The Instructor tosses Tony the knife. Tony catches

it. As they circle,. the Instructor taunts Tony.

Come on. Come on. Make a move,

Sir. Are you falling in love with

me? Then do something hostile.

Make a face. Stick out your tongue.

Do something, Mister Adams.

Tony swings the knife. The Instructor avoids him.

My little bitty sister can make a

The Instructor offers a tempting target. Tony swings.

The Instructor slaps his cap across Tony's face, grabs

Tony's wrist and disarms him, throwing him to the

ground.

the Instructor's balls. The Instructor grabs his

groin and goes down in a heap.

Tony rolls to his feet, grabs up the killing knife

and presses it to the Instrutor's throat.

me about it..

The Instructor is looking at Tony. Suddenly he grins;

You're getting there, Mister Adams.

Tony looks at the knife in his hand, then tosses it

away and starts off. At this point a jeep comes

bouncing over the hill and skids to a breadsiding

He pushes his way through the Television Cameramen

We pan him over to a limousine which he gets into

quickly. The limousine drives off.

Today in Leavenworth, Kansas, one--

six and. a half years of a fifteen

We are shooting past the big, nubby sculptured head of

Sohn Kennedy which identifies, but in no way dominates

the long, high handsome lobby with its crimson carpets.

The Opera is breaking for intermission and the audience

is moving toward the bars and the terrace.

We move to the bar where, in the crush, we find Tony.

As everybody seems to be ordering at once---

Tony turns to watch a woman move off with two drinks-

EXT? TEE TERRACE ( iYNEL'Y CENT~'R) - NZGET

On the broad, impressive terrace, overlooking the curve

of the river- as it mirrors the lights of Washington, we

find Elizabeth, dressed for evening. She is surrounded

by three urbane men, Morton, her Television Producer,

Swartzwalder, a Jurist and McKissick, a young Senator.

McKissick is lighting Elizabeth's cigarette as Tony

comes up with the two drinks.

Finally.

Thank God for 'the Navy.

As she takes her drink:

Mister Adams,_ I'd like you to meet

Judge Swartzwalder -- Senator

McXissick and Jack Morton from

As long as the ratings hold up.

As Tony is shaking hands around with the Judge, McKissick

turns to Elizabeth:

Tony has heard this last.

A buzzer sounds from inside. Elizabeth hands Tony

What's the ?...

She breaks off because Tony has put his hand over her

mouth. Her eyes blaze as she reaches for his wrist.

Noise in the living- room.

There it is again.

This time we too have heard something. He uncovers

her mouth.

There's a window in the front room.

As for a frozen moment., surprise and consternation

show an his face. At this point:

Don't make a noise. Just stand

where you are or I'll kill you.

We have pulled back and panned slightly to include Tony

who is sitting on the. floor, his back against the wall.

The gun in. his hand is, trained on the Man who has just

-come in.

As: the Second Man stands motionless, Tony is on. his

feet and up to him. Tony takes the qua from him and

As Tony enters with his prisoner, the First Man - the

into Elizabeth's throat. He is looking the other way,

but turns as: _

Turn very easy.

The First Man turns, sees Tony and the Other Man.

S've got a. gun at your partner's

head.

There is 'a beat, then:

Drop the gun or I slit her throat.

You drop the knife.

Don't you think I'll kill her?

her. I_ said crop the knife.

Suddenly the Second Man's knees buckle as. Tony, in a

lightning move, brings the gun barrel down across the

Man's head.

As the Second Man is on his hands and knees, Zi.?ce a

stunned ox, dripping blood on the carpet, Tony tuns

once more to the an with the knife.

pulls the trigger.

The. kneeling man plunges for+qard, dead, the back of -

his head blown off.. Tony now turns, without emotion,

to the man with the knife.

That's what you're going to look

like in two seconds if you harm

As the First Man drops his knife and releases Elizabeth,

she is locking at Tony, stunned, her aplomb totally

vanished.

Elizabeth nods and half-stumbles out of the room. Tony

crosses to the Man.

Tony lifts the gun and blasts the First Man three

EXT. EVERGLADES BAY - DAY

We are in a swampy backwater on the West Coast of

Florida, south at Fort Meyer. Hacked out of the

everglades is a clearing on which a tourist acccmmo-

dation has been built. It is called Tarpon Lodge

and signs announce "Cold Beer", "Boat Rentals" and

"Tourist Accoammdations". There is a small pier.

as a small, commercial fishing boat comes chugging

up the bayou and blows its whistle.

CLOSER - THE FISH=TG 3O

comes out to the bow of the boat, locks off toward

M=. As AIRSTRIP - DAY

A rough airstrip has been bulldozed out of the scrib

pine and palmetto forest. At one end is a hanger and

on its side the words: INTER-CAR EAN CBAMTERS.

As Croce and the Latin Americans come up:

CROCE.

1 Inside-the hanger we see a D.C. Six. Tony comes out

cleaning cosmolene off his hands with a rag.

Tony, I' d :like you to meet Doctor

Barcenas.

I'm pleased to meet you, Doctor.

They shake hands, then:.

Permit me to present my companions --

Indio, Borracho, Padre Pepe, El

Fararon, Arrigo and my brother, Jorge.

The members of the assault team -- the Indian, the

Drunk, the Priest, the Pharoah, Arrigo who looks

like a pimp, and the romantic, fire-eating younger

brother -- are introduced to Tony individually. Xd

lib greetings, then to Barcenas:

Are you read-!?

CONT=T Z :

For many years.

As they move into the hanger:

Z understand from Senor Croca that

the idea with the diving suit did

not work out.

There were a few problems.

But the other is. fine?

Yes. ,

You've been in. touch with your

Everything is arranged.

INT THE EA2GAR - DAY

At one side of the hangar we see crates of various

weapons. Boxes of hand grenades, mortars and mortar

shells. Sub-machine guns caked in cosmolene, LAW

rockets, field radios. So on. As Tony and Roberto

come in, followed by the others:

we got you BARS and Carbines

plus ten, thirty calibre light

machine guns, and ten, four-point

t o inch mortars with a thousand

rounds of high explosive and a

thousand, rounds of white phosphorous.

Tony is pointing out the various boxes and crates:

plastic tube.

We also got you two hundred Sixty-

They're lightweight, one-shot dis-

posable Bazookas.

There is also field gear, medical

supplies, tentage, demolition mater-

Arrigo, the. pimp, comes up, takes the LAW rocket from

Roberto, then:

Corleone, who is at the bar fixing drinks.

Half an hour late.

means he's willing to talk like

L.A ONE

Rocco, is that what happened to

flicks it.

Eagen comes around his desk to the door to greet

Maatrocina as he enters, followed closely by the

cold-looking Ralph Augusto.

Sam. Z'm glad. you could come.

Ralph. Good to see you. What

are you drinking?

He'll leave Pat Brady for dead in

to talk about.

How we can all accommodate to this

as the crowd laughs and cheers them on.

Aqua!

We move up to a loud speaker attached to an ornate and

bunting festooned.lampost. From the speaker we hear:

As the predominantly Latin American crowd cheers, we

pick out Tony, in civilian clothes, amongst. the' cheer-

The blood of our martyrs is still

too fresh on our pavement. We will

be friends and neighbors, but never

again slaves to Imperialism.

A young Latino, and we will recognize him as Ar=igo,

has moved to Tony's side. As the cheers have erupted

once more, Amigo, with'a brief nod of the head, indic-

ates that Tony shouldfol:ow him.

ANOT'_R ANGLE

As Arrigo goes, Tony looks after him briefly, then over

to the American Delegation including Lucas, the Assistant

Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs; Cariock,

the Speaker of the House and several prominent liberal

Senators including McKissick of Utah and the elegant

Harthaiemew of Pennsylvania.

Also in the delegation, in uniform, is Stu Palmateer.

The older man's eyes meet with Tony's for a brief

moment. He has seen the exchange. He watches as

Tony leaves, then looks over toward u_agudo, Vidal's

Chief of Police. The harsh, heavy Policeman is laugh-

1 ing at something Vidal has said, seemingly paying no

attention to Tony's exit.

INT. LOBBY ECT!L ME LA REVOLUTION - :TIGHT

As Tony is crossing the lobby, Elizabeth Ann Dunne,

display is still in progress.

EXT. AVENIDA DE LA R VOLUCION - NIGHT

Throngs of Merry-makers are moving along the wide,

palm-lined avenue that follows the curve of the bay.

Many are in cost=e. Some play instruments. Others

have bongo drums. The atmosphere is frenetic. There

is. a pervasive beat. The whole city seems to throb

with it.

We are on Arrigo who stands outside the flaw of traffic,

We are on the part of the harbor where the big fishing,

boats tie up. The sound of the celebration is fainter

now, a couple of blocks distant. We are on an old,

but seaworthy fishing boat; the name on the stern is

"Stelia.Maria". Amigo comes up the pier, pauses by

the short gangway.

As Tony comes up and joins Axr-igo a Third man suddenly

appears out of the darkness. As he comes up to Tony,

we recognize Jorge Baxcenas.

You bring it?

Yes.

This way.

Jorge leads them aboard.

INT. MAIN CABIN (STELLA MAR15) - NIGHT

In the cabin are Roberto Barcenas, Indio, ?araron,

thing faintly flashy but also enormously sensual about

her..

One Man is cleaning a stripped automatic rifle. Another

is loading a banana. clip with 30 calibre bullets. Barcenas,

the girl and some others are bent over a map on the mess

belt which he puts on the table and opens. 'IIe takes

As Roberto takes up the money and counts it., Tony

takes out a small vial in a plastic container.

and blows most of Fritz's head away.

As a fountain of blood gushes up from the stalk of

Fritz's neck and Hagen's car starts to swerve into

the curbing, the Gunman in the other car sends two

more blasts of deer--load into Hagen's car.

as the Corleone Button Men in the following car blasts

at the attackers, the Shotgun Man blasts away.

as Hagen is hit by half a dozen buckshot and he flaps

As Rocco Lampone comes out of the wreckage, the Button

men are pulling Tony -- who is unconscious -- out.

Lampone looks at Fritz and Hagen.

Not a goddamned thug you can do

for them. Let's get out of here.

As The Corleone Men carry Tony to the other ca= and

get him inside, people are starting to gather.

It's all right. It's all right.

Gangway. We're getting him to

the hospital! Man's hurt here!

Clear the road:.

As the Bystanders move back, the Corleone car burns

rubber and digs out

Camera is subjective, the screen is pitch black with

a single red-orange dot moving erratically in the

center. It is the coal of a cigarette as someone

takes a last puff, tamps it out, then scratches a

match and. lights another.

In the flare of the match we see a Nurse's bulldog

face.

ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLC1 ING TONY

He wears a bandage around his head like a burban. Be

is looking at the Nurse in the flicker of the match

flame.

Who are you?

OY., gc?od, you're awake.

Wait a minute.

104.

I'll be right back.

The nurse has risen. She switches on a lamp and

exits.

ANOThR ANGLE (MIRROR SHOT)

We are angled into a mirror over a chest of drawers,

holding on Tony as he sits up in bed, then gingerly

gets to his feet. He is wearing silk pajamas. Now

he crosses to the mirror and checks himself out.

Aside from the bandage he seems to be in one -piece.

Now, in the mirror we see the door open and silhou-

etted in the doorway, the figure of Michael. Tony

turns.

ANOTffER ANGL -

as Tony and Michael look at one another for. a long

moment.

How are you feeling?

What am I doing here?

As Michael comes into the room and closes the door:

I had Rocco bring you.

How's the head? A little -pain?

A little.

The Doctor says it's nothing.to

bother you, but I've always found

it's easier to be brave about some-

body else's headache.

Did he say how soon T could leave?

Sit dcwn. Sim down..

Tony doesn't sit down.

r'd like to get out of here as soon

as possible.

Let me ask you a question. Have

you any idea where you stand?

I'm not totally stupid.

I aC 't think you're stupid. I

think you're smart. 3 t not smart

enough.

t'n willing to learn.

Good.

You've let your enemies get too

close to you.

Those people who tried to kill you

in Las Vegas, they were Maatrocina's

people.

Are 'you sure?

Michael answers that question with a look: Of course

in sure.

MICHAZZ,

The question to ask is this: Who

knew you were flying to Las Vegas?-

The girl I was staying with and ---

Tony breaks off:

Someone f_ cm Langley?

Before I left, I called a man named

Stuart ?almateer.

(CONY r ED)

106.

I told Tom Hagen -- God rest his

soul --- but I warned him. it was a.

mistake -- that whole Vidal business.

As the only contact between our people

and the Government you had no protec-

tion. You were naked.

It they want to break the contact,

they elimirate you and they're clean.

As long as you're alive,. you're a

threat -- do you understand?

As Tony sits. He's not sure whether he likes or

trusts or is ready to forgive his father, but he

knows the sound of good sense when he hears it.

How long do you think the-Administra-

tion would last if it were to come

out that the President used the

Corleone family to assassinate the

head of a foreign state.

The question is rhetorical.

Michael takes out a cigar and goes about the ceremony

of lighting it.

I'm not supposed to smoke these

things, but it, isn't every day

a man's son comes home.

You were saying?

Every year- -- on February third --

I've sent you a check. Those ohecks

were never cashed

Would you like to '.cacw why?

107.

r've always know why -- and z res-

pect your reasons. But, neverthe-

less, I'm your lather and anything

t have is yours - if it's money you

want, my friendship, the benefit of

my experience -- if you'll accept it.

It's yours.

I I need your advice.

(nods, then)

There are two ways I see to handle

this. First, I can make you dis-

appear in. Sicily until everything

blows over. Things change. Men get

old and angers cool. In four or

five years you could probably be

safe to come home again..

What's the other way?

MICE?

0 The other way is a gamble that you

could lose.

And it would mean becoming a part

of the family -- for a while anyway.

Tony is just looking at Michael.

Think about it. Sleep on it.

We'll talk again in the morning.

I=. THE BOATHOUSE (CORLEONE COMPOUND) - DAE

Tony enters the glassed-in boathouse. Outside, cold

Your father will be out in a moment.

There's coffee on the sideboard.

Tony tads. The Ser-want exits. 'ror.?y crosses to the

it, his eyes fall on a table in the corner on which

(CCdN V E )

are many Pictures, mostly in heavy silver frames.

Some are studio portraits. Some are grainy blow-ups

of snapshots. Tony crosses to the table of pictures.

VERY CLOSE - THE PICTURES

As Tony looks, we are moving from picture to picture.

The first is a wedding portrait taken on Connie's

wedding day. Carlo is kissing the Bride. The God-

father stands, proud and uncom.fortable in his tuxedo.

Michael in his uniform. The twins, - all heavy eyebrows

and baby fat.

'"here is a picture of Sonny with his fists up and

laughing as if about to hit someone.

There is a photograph of the three brothers, Sonny,

Michael and 'redo, their arms around each other, at

an outing someplace. Sonny is in the middle of a

big grin. Fredo looks shy and scared. Michael is

staring straight ahead, a boyish smile on h 1s face

although his eyes are cold.

There is a picture of Michael and Ray at Tony's con-

firmation.

There is a blown-up snapshot of the Godfather in his

tomato garden in the backyard..

is the little boy, Tony. aged three or four. They

have the special rapport that sometimes exists be-

tween the old and the very youzg. They play teasing

games with paper fangs and the bug spray can, then

suddenly, the old man's heart ;ailed him, and he falls

i n to the tomato vines. After a moment the lit :le boy

understands that the old man is no l anger playing a

game, and he beomes frightened:

LOS.

INT. TifE BOATHOIISZ- DAY

We are on the door as Michael enters. He pauses for

a moment, then:

MICHAEL ' .

Do you remember your grandfather?

as Tony turns from the table full of pictures with his

grandfather's framed portrait still in his hand.

Yes..

As Tony puts down the picture, Michael comes up.

Do you remember him with admira-

tion and respect?

Z remember that I loved him.

0 So did I.

I've been thinking about these

choices.

Michael holds up his hand to delay the decision.

Talk with me for a moment.

Let me learn something about my

son.. What's Trident Scholar?

It's a special honors program for

First Classmen.

You liked Annapolis?

Yes.

Enough to make a life in t e Navy?

No. Not that much.

2 was surprised you didn't go to

Dartmouth.

I thought about it, but Kay wanted

me to go to Annapolis and the price

was right.

How's Hanover these days?

About the same.

I always liked that town. That' S

where Z met your mother -- when I

was going to school up there.

I know.

I'd planned to live there, you know.

Teach maybe -- or go into law. A.

little office on Wheelock Street.

Deeds and wills. I would have liked

that.

Why didn't you do it?

Because one day a Sicilian pimp

and dope peddlar named Virgil

Solla2 O tried to assassinate my

father -- your grandfather -- and

I had to do something about it.

It was a mistake. S took a road.

The wrong road for me. It ended

here.

is this so bad? Sa

don't know. it depends or. what

you call terrib? e . You have to

MICHAEL (cant 'd)

live a certain way --- a cold way -

or you won't live long.

Do you remember your uncle credo?

?redo, the fisherman. Yes. I'll

always remember, he had a secret

way to catch fish. 'He taught me.

You say a Hail. Mary' before you

put the line down. It never fails.

You know what happened to ?'redo?

He died didn't he?

I had him killed. My own brother.

It was something r had to do -- or

felt I had to.

Why?

He went against the family. So I

waited until our mother died and

then I --

(breaks off ,

Not too many people are fitted for

this kind of a life. I've had to

do mazy hard things, but sending

you and your sister away -- that

was the hardest.

There is a beat. To= and his father look at each

other and for a moment we feel that Tony is going

to cross to his father, then the moment passes:

And now, that I've said t~ at, I'd

like to hear your decision.

Morehouse and Palmateer are in the office. Their atti-

tudes are. less than cordial as Tony enters.

Come in Adams, sit down. I've

called Stu in on this --

Though I'm afraid I can't give

you much time. I've got a brief-

ing with the Z-orty Committee at

noon.

what I have to say won't take long.

And I think we 111 all be happier

if it's not on tape.

Morehouse pauses a moment then openens a drawer and

switches ofd his tape machine.

Sow's your health? I understand

you got a crack on the head?

I'm fine now.

you were up at your father's place

in Tahoe?

T::at d s rig

113.

Has he changed much?

Not as much as I' d. expected.

I remember him very well -- from

the Senate hearings on crime. Heat

little man. Very polite, spoke in

a soft, reasonable voice. He sat

there with two million dollars worth

of legal talent at his elbow and told

the United States Government to go

piss up a rope.

You had to admire the pretentious

little bastard.

We're wasting each other's time

with this, Mister Morehouse.

' M OREHOUSE

All right, Son. This is your party.

You've got five minutes.

But before we start, I'm not going

to listen to a lot of recriminations

about that cveration. Your people

blew it, pure and sim le. It was

totally mishandled. A mistake from

beginning to end.

The big mistake was that I'm still

alive.

Come again?

11 you'd managed to get rid of me

down there - or in Vegas -- you' d

be all right. silt it's too Late

now. You've lost your chance.

I don't know what the hell you're

talking about.

114.

If anything should happen to me --

anything at all -- you can find out.

The full story will be all over the

six o'clock news.

I'd like to hear your conception of

the full story..

You were running a no-lose operation.

if we succeeded, you were rid of

Vidal. -- if we failed, the Corleone

family was set up to take the blame.

Your hands were clean. I was the

only one who could dispute your

story and I wasn't supposed to come

back. I've found out that my res-

ignation from the Navy was processed

and accepted a full week before I

went down here ---

Stu?

Well, yes, Sir. His resignation did

go through, but it was a snafu -- a

Yeoman's mistake, that's all.

A clerical error.

And I don't buy it.

don't give a shit if you buy it

or not. And I'll tell you some-

thing else, Mister Adams, or what-

ever your fucking name is, I don't

react favorably to blackmail.

It's not blackmail. It's a simple

statement of fact. If anything

happens to me or if the Corleone

Family is damaged iz these Senate

Hearings, then the whistle blows

and the whole zdmin .st_ation aces.

(CONTINUED) ?

And what makes you think T. give a

shit about what happens to the Admin-

istration?

Morehouse grins without humor. Tony's eyes flicker.

Morehouse has told something that Tony needed to know.

Morehouse is up and coming around the desk, as he

continues. _

Whatever I did was done under dix-

ect orders from the President of

the United States, and I. will. so

testify in open hearing. if that

upsets some of you= guinea gumbarrs

in Nevada, then so be it. The days

are over when your father and his

like could corrupt and intimidate

this Nation.

No. You've taken over the job.

Your five minutes are up -- now get

the hell out of here.

As Tony turns and goes, Morehouse glares after him,

the glint of victory in his eyes.
