FADE IN:

OVER the opening strains of "I LOVE YOU, CALIFORNIA," a

MONTAGE:  a mixture of headlines, newsreel footage and

live action.

The meat wagon hauls ex-button men to the morgue.  Where

will it end?

EXT. L.A. SKYLINE - SUNSET

Palm trees in silhouette against a cherry sky.  City

lights twinkle.  Los Angeles.  A place where anything is

possible.  A place where dreams come true.  As the sky

darkens, triple-kleig lights begin to sweep back and

forth.

EXT. MANSION (HANCOCK PARK) - NIGHT

The KLEIG LIGHTS are out front.  Valets hurry to park a

line of elegant cars.

INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

The MAYOR yanks a cloth to reveal a MODEL of L.A. criss-

crossed by an elaborate FREEWAY SYSTEM.  The CROWD oohs.

A COUNCILMAN claps.  A SOCIETY MATRON nods her approval.

PIERCE PATCHETT, 50, tuxedoed, watches off to one side.

A behind-the-scenes power broker, Patchett exudes

authority much more so than the Mayor does.

More applause.  One REPORTER asks a little too loudly...

The Mayor wears a plastic smile, ignores it.

INT. THE MOCAMBO - NIGHT

A CLUB PHOTOGRAPHER pops snapshots, but the real action

is on the floor where MICKEY COHEN does a wicked "Lindy

Hop" with THREE different GIRLS at once.  A fireplug of a

man, he hardly seems a public menace.  Nearby is his

bodyguard JOHNNY STOMPANATO.  Over it all:

His hair in a slick pompadour, Stompanato keeps an eye on

Cohen and comes onto a CIGARETTE GIRL at the same time.

Mickey works a sweat on the dance floor.  A bottle of

champagne pops; Stompanato reacts, nearly draws a pistol

from his shoulder holster.  As he laughs at himself...

INT.

Lurid page one headlines cover the wall where SID

HUDGEONS types.  The essence of sleaze, Sid is the

publisher-photographer-writer of

keeper of inside dirt supreme.  As he continues...

INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

The party continues.  The Mayor has moved off to the side

with the power brokers.  Patchett is a presence.

EXT. STOREFRONT - NIGHT

A dozen people watch a display windoe TELEVISION as it

rolls the opening of the hit show "Badge of Honor."  Over

familiar THEME MUSIC, "Sgt. Joe Reno" (actor BRETT CHASE)

walks the streets of Los Angeles.

INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT

The Mayor continues.

As Pierce Patchett nods sagely.

INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Wrestler GORGEOUS GEORGE primps and poses before flatten-

ing an opponent with a drop kick.

INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

An enthusiastic crowd adjusts their 3-D glasses.

EXT. COHEN MANSION (BEVERLY HILLS) - DAY

In monogrammed silk pajamas, Mickey Cohen answers the

door, his pet BULLDOG Mickey Jr. at his feet.  The police

are waiting.  REPORTERS' flashbulbs pop.

EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE - DAY

JOHN WAYNE gets his hand prints in the sidewalk.

EXT. WESTCHESTER BEAN FIELD - DAY

MIGRANT WORKERS hurry to finish the harvest.  We PAN

TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who wait impatiently with bull-

dozers under a "Spirit of the Future" BANNER.  As the

last picker leaves the field, the bulldozers move in,

leveling the bean rows to make way for a housing tract.

EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - STEPS - DAY

Flashbulbs pop as Mickey Cohen exits and starts down

the steps.  Accompanied by his LAWYERS, bodyguard

Stompanato and mob lieutenants DEUCE PERKINS and NATE

JANKLOW, Cohen ignores REPORTERS' shouts.

As Cohen gets into a waiting car, the media turn their

attention to District Attorney ELLIS LOEW.  A singularly

ambitious man, Loew loves the spotlight.

The SONG ENDS and so does the MONTAGE.

INT. PACKARD (ACROSS FROM BULLOCKS WILSHIRE) - NIGHT

December 24th.  Wendell "BUD" WHITE, 30, stares at the

enormous Christmas tree on the deco platform over

Bullocks' entrance.  An LAPD cop, Bud's rep as the

toughest man on the force has been well earned.  In the

back seat, with cases of Walker Black and Cutty Sark, is

Bud's partner -- DICK STENSLAND.  Older, but also a tough

hump, "Stens" sucks on a pint of Old Crow.

The passenger door opens and Mickey Cohen bodyguard

Johnny Stompanato slides in.  Guinea handsome, Johnny

wears his curls in a tight pompadour.  With his boss

behind bars, he's out of work.  Bud just stares at him.

Stompanato smiles.  Nervous.  Through the window, Bud

watches a Salvation Army Santa palm coins from a kettle.

Impatient, Bud tugs at a finger, CRACKS a KNUCKLE.

Bud's eyes narrow at this last bit of info.  Stompanato

holds up a slip of paper.

Bud digs into his wallet, pulls out twenty bucks,

exchanges it with Stompanato.  Stompanato smiles smugly,

grabs a bottle of Scotch from the back.

Without warning, Bud grabs Stompanato's tie and yanks,

slamming his forehead into the dash.

EXT. 1486 EVERGREEN - NIGHT

A stucco job in a row of vet prefabs.  A neon Santa

sleigh has landed on the roof.  Through the front window,

we see a fat guy browbeating a woman.  Puff-faced, 35-

ish, she backs away as he rages at her.

The Packard pulls up out front.  Stensland could care

less.

Bud KILLS the IGNITION, picks up the radio.

EXT. 1486 EVERGREEN - BUD - NIGHT

steps to the house.  Inside, we hear SLAPS, MUFFLED

CRIES.  Bud grips an outlet cord coming off the roof and

yanks.  The sleigh crashes to the ground with REINDEER

EXPLODING around it.  A beat.  The fat guy runs out to

investigate, trips over Rudolph.

Bud pounces.  Fat guy takes a swing, misses.  Grabbing

fat guy's hair, Bud smashes his face to the pavement.

Once, twice.  Teeth skitter down the walk.

Another face full of gravel.  Fat guy's WIFE watches with

apprehension from the steps as Bud cuffs her husband's

hands behind his back, empties his pockets.  A cash roll

and car keys.  Bud looks over at her.

She nods.  Bud hands her the keys and the cash.

Bud watches as she gets into a pre-war Ford in the drive.

She backs over a blinking reindeer as she goes.

INT. STAGE FOUR (VARIETY INTERNATIONAL PICTURES) - NIGHT

The "Badge of Honor" set.  A Christmas party in full

swing.  Eating, drinking, and dancing.  Star Brett Chase,

seen earlier on television, is holding court.

LAPD Sgt. "Trashcan" JACK VINCENNES, late 30s with slick,

good looks, dances with a young ACTRESS.  Grinding their

way through a ballad, they're obviously hitting it off.

They're interrupted by Sid Hudgeons.

The Actress storms off.  Jack looks to Sid.

EXT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

WITH a VIEW of Grauman's Chinese.  Jack and two uniformed

patrolmen wait on the darkened street.  An arc light has

been set up.  Hudgeons creeps back over from the house.

INT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

The arc light floods the living room about the same time

that Jack kicks the door in.  The room is caught flush:

Christmas tree, a bag of weed on the couch, two kids

necking in their BVDs.  MATT REYNOLDS and TAMMY JORDAN.

EXT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

Jack exits, hauling Jordan and Reynolds by the neck.

Jack stops with Grauman's FRAMED behind him and Hudgeons

CLICKS off several shots with his CAMERA.

Windows light up.  Rubberneckers appear.  Jack hands the

kids to the patrolmen, heads back in with Hudgeons in

tow.

INT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT

Jack scoops the pot, flips through an address book.  A

card falls out.  "Fleur-de-Lis.  Whatever you desire..."

Jack looks from the card out the window at the kids being

loaded into a black and white.  They're both crying now.

Sid hands him a President Grant 50.

INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT

Suspects, mostly drunk and disorderly, are ushered

through.  Sgt. ED EXLEY, 30, bespectacled, is at the desk

with a YOUNG OFFICER.  Exley is an up-and-comer.  Burning

with ambition.  The faster he rises through the ranks,

the more resentment he leaves in his wake.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - NIGHT

Tinsel-trimmed photos of movie stars look down from the

walls as the OWNER takes an order from LYNN BRACKEN.

Her hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it

up.  There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn.  She

seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie

stars.  Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the

counter.  Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a

moment.

The Owner spots Bud.  A big smile turns to a frown.

The Owner begins indiscriminately loading hard liquor

into a cardboard box, leaving Bud and Lynn to look at

each other.  Bud says the only thing he can think of.

As the Owner bangs a case of liquor on the counter...

EXT. HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - NIGHT

Bud exits with his booze, heads for the car.  Something

catches his eye.  A woman in the rear passenger seat of a

new Cadillac.  SUSAN LEFFERTS.  Both her eyes are black.

Bud starts over.  The case on his hip, he motions for her

to roll down the window.  The driver's side door opens

and bodyguard TURNER "BUZZ" MEEKS menaces his way out.

Meeks stops short as Bud shoves his badge in Meeks' face.

Setting the case on the car's hood, Bud spins Meeks

around, pats him down.  He finds a .38 in a shoulder

holster.

Bud removes Meeks' wallet, checks the ID.

Bud raps on Susan's window with his badge.  It comes

down.

Beside her, a man leans over.  Pierce Patchett, seen

before at the freeway unveiling, is a man used to being

chauffeured.  Like FDR, he smokes his cigarette in a

holder.

Patchett has no idea he's walking on thin ice.  As he

stares impatiently at Bud, Bud looks back to Susan.

Bud looks to see Lynn Bracken moving to the driver's

door.

Susan laughs.  Patchett eases back into the shadows.

Bud considers Meeks' gun license, then hands him back the

.38 and wallet.  Lifting his booze, Bud watches Meeks get

back in the car.

Stensland steps up as the cabbie starts to pull away.

For an odd moment, Stensland and Meeks lock eyes.

CLOSE ON DUDLEY SMITH

Fifty, handsome in his police captain's uniform.  Singing

"Silver Bells" in a beautiful low tenor.  Tough,

respected, Dudley goes to bed as a cop every night of his

life.  He's a department power to be reckoned with.

INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT

An

along with the gathered patrolmen as Dudley finishes to

applause.  Dudley joins the press.

As the Reporter scribbles down the quote...

They laugh.  Dudley points the way out.

Dudley's the last one out the door.  As he goes, he turns

back to give the men a wink.  He's no sooner out the door

when the first case of Johnny Walker is brought in.

INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT

Ed Exley gets another report from the Young Officer.

He hands the report to Exley.  It's now that Dudley comes

through on his press junket.

As the photographer snaps Exley's picture...

As the Reporter and photographer wander off, Dudley turns

to Exley a bit more serious.

INT. DUDLEY SMITH'S OFFICE - DAY

Dudley pours two drinks, hands one to Exley.

They drink.  Exley looks to a photo on the wall.

Himself as a ten-year-old standing between Dudley and his

father Preston, both in police uniform.

Remembering, Exley invokes his father's favorite toast.

Exley raises his glass, but Dudley just watches him.

We can see Dudley doesn't approve.

The criticism stings, but Dudley's a straight shooter.

INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT

A large impromptu bar has been set-up.  The party is in

full swing, the floor packed with nightwatch blues.  A

PHONOGRAPH SPEWS DIRTY CHRISTMAS CAROLS.

Stensland pours eggnog and Old Crow into the water cooler

as Bud elbows his way in with another case.

More cops vocie their agreement.  Bottles are passed.

Only Bud doesn't seem as caught-up as the rest.

INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NARCO PEN - NIGHT

Jack Vincennes at his desk.  Holding the Fleur-de-Lis

card, Jack dials the number.  A corkboard on the wall is

posted with press clippings.  "Dope Crusader Wounded in

Shootout."  "Actor Mitchum Seized in Marijuana Shack

Raid."  That one includes a shot of Jack ushering Mitchum

into jail.

CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Jack redials.

The line goes dead again.  Jack dials a new number.

INT. MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT

Exley surveys the carousing rowdies.  Raising his

voice...

The party continues undiminished.  From across the room,

Stensland eyes Exley with disdain.

WATCH COMMANDER'S OFFICE

The command not really his, Exley reads a report, ignores

the party, though his window looks into the thick of it.

Suddenly a ripple goes through the room.  The men begin

to push out through a rear door.  Exley stands, stops a

COP.

Exley starts out after them.

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

Stensland in the lead.  Pulling out a blackjack, he

enters Cell #4, begins wailing on one of the Mexicans --

Dinardo.

Cheered on by drunks in the tank and his fellow officers,

Stensland goes wild.  He's joined by Lentz, Crumley and

Tristano.  Shaking his head, Jack Vincennes moves away.

INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

Bud types his report with one finger.  Jack looks in.

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

Followed by Jack, Bud forces his way through the crowd.

The men who see it's him quickly clear a path.

Swigging from a pint of gin, Stensland works skinny

GARCIA.  Head saps.  The kid drops to his knees drooling

blood.

Bud grabs Stensland, hauls him off of Garcia who looks

up.

Bud sees red.  Letting go of Stensland, Bud White picks

up Garcia by the neck.  There are cheers, "Attaboys" and

"Holy Fucks" as Bud bangs Garcia's head on the ceiling.

Cops block Exley's way.  As Bud looks over, Garcia kicks

him in the balls.  A dangling shot.  Bud keels into the

bars, Garcia stumbles out of the cell, smack into Jack.

Jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer,

then puts Garcia down with a left-right.

Exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket.

Exley has just started taking names when Bud grabs him by

the scruff of the neck and hauls him off balance into...

HALL

As Exley struggles, a cop opens the door to the store

room.  Bud slings Exley inside, then slams the door

tight.  Exley is locked in.  As Bud moves off, we hear

POUNDING.

CELL BLOCK

The

and unnoticed.  Stensland swings like a madman.  That's

when a flashbulb goes off.  Freezing everyone in black

and white.

INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

The CHIEF sits behind a desk in a four-star uniform.

Dudley Smith sits to his left, D.A. Ellis Loew to his

right.  Seen earlier at the Mickey Cohen press

conference, Loew is the only civilian.  Bud White stands

across from them.  There to be judged.

Bud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the Chief.

The Chief sighs, looks to Loew.

Loew steps to Bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell

block photo.  The headline:  "BLOODY CHRISTMAS."

Bud sets them on The Chief's desk.

Turning, White shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as

he makes his way out.  Dudley Smith hides a smile.

OTHER SIDE OF GLASS

Exley watches, involuntarily leans back as Bud passes on

the other side of the glass.

THE CHIEF'S OFFICE

Dudley, Loew and The Chief wait as Exley enters.

Dudley gives Exley a look.  He's angry with him.

The Chief interrupts with his own concern.

Exley seizes the moment, going over Dudley's head.

The Chief and Dudley exchange a look.  Neither approves.

As Exley starts out, Dudley pulls him aside, speaks low.

JACK VINCENNES

Looking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the...

CHIEF'S OFFICE

Round two.  Centred on Jack.  Exley is gone.

The Chief just got Jack where he lives.

Smiles all around.  Loew smiles at the two-way.  A move

not lost on Jack who wonders who might be on the other

side.

Jack leaves.  The Chief steps to the mirror, looks

through.

OTHER SIDE OF GLASS

Exley clenches his fist in victory.  The Chief continues.

INT. ROOM 114 (GRAND JURY WITNESS ROOM) - DAY

Glasses off, Exley waits, looks up as Jack enters.

At that, a CLERK steps in from the hallway.

As Exley's about to go...

INT. TWILIGHT LOUNGE - NIGHT

An old black guy in a frayed, threadbare tux plays piano.

Bud, nursing a highball at the bar, steps over to a

REDHEAD with too much make-up on too many miles.

A hand on Bud's shoulder.  He turns to see Dudley Smith.

Dudley starts off.  Bud turns back to Redhead, but she's

already talking to a sailor.

BOOTH

Dudley sits at a table.  A newspaper is opened, a little

mound underneath.  Bud joins Dudley.

Bud looks back over.  Dudley's getting too personal.

Smith yanks the newspaper revealing Bud's badge & .38

Special.  Bud can't believe his eyes.

Dudley dismisses the question with a wave of his hand.

Dudley lays brass knuckles on the table.  They're

chipped, caked with blood.

The marquee gushes:  "Today Sgt. Joe Reno:  Badge of

Honor Star Brett Chase."

INT. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

A nerdy 14-YEAR-OLD asks Brett Chase:

Chase looks over and winks at Jack who waits in the

wings.

As the kids applaud, Chase joins Jack who gives him a

quick drag of a cigarette.  A nervous PA joins them.

Chase points out a fetching girl in the second row.

Chase and Jack watch the PA ask "Sweater" a question

while pointing to Chase.  Maybe sixteen, she nods "yes"

eagerly.

PRINTING PRESS

The latest issue of

cover:  "Gail Russell Caught In Love Nest.  Nymph or

No?"

INT. CITY JAIL - DAY

Bud White flips through today's booking slips, finds one

that's interesting.  Reading to himself...

Containment Squad strong-arms, BREUNING and CARLISLE

pause as they pass.

CITY JAIL - HALLWAY

Bud walks to a door covered in sheet metal.  He opens it

to reveal a holding tank with a burly, jumpsuited

PRISONER.

Bud enters, closes the door behind him.  A beat, we hear

the sounds of FISTS ON FLESH.  It's Bud's business now.

INT. BEVERLY HILLS MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

Deuce Perkins (the Mickey Cohen narcotics lieutenant seen

earlier) stands at the bookshelf.  He pulls down books to

reveal a shoe box.  He sets it on his desk, pulls back

the cover to reveal several bags of white powder.

Heroin.

A BRANCH SNAPS outside.  Perkins opens a drawer, fishes a

revolver.  Turning off the light, he heads to the window.

His finger parts the curtains.  At that instant, he

staggers, falls as GUNFIRE rips into him.

The heroin just sits there on the desk.

EXT. McNEIL PENITENTIARY - DAY

Grim-faced guards scan the yard from machine-gunned

towers.

INT. McNEIL PENITENTIARY - VISITOR BOOTH - DAY

Mickey Cohen sits across from visitor Johnny Stompanato.

Cohen is going off the handle.

As "STRANGER IN PARADISE" ENDS, so does the MONTAGE.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - AD VICE - DAY

Addressing the squad, a no-nonsense VICE CAPTAIN picks up

a stack of magazines.

As the Vice Capt. hands it out for the men to examine,

new member Jack Vincennes arrives late.

The men laugh.  Jack sits, flips a magazine.  Men and

women.  Men and men.  Girls and girls.  Girls and horses.

Vice Capt. retrieves the magazines, hands them to Jack.

Exaggerated "oohs" and "aahs" from the men.

As they go, Jack sees the books are stamped:  "Fleur-de-Lis

Whatever you desire."  Jack takes the matching

business card from his wallet, the one he found on

Christmas Eve.

INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - NARCO PEN - DAY

Jack Vincennes is at his desk.  Holding the Fleur-de-Lis

card, magazines spread before him, Jack dials the number.

INT.

Sid Hudgeons sits behind his desk, answers the phone.

INTERCUT WITH Jack at his desk:

Hudgeons reaches into a stack of papers, pulls out a

magazine like the one Jack has.

The LINE CLICKS off.  Jack hesitates a moment before

cradling the receiver.  Something's not right here.

EXT. HOLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - TWILIGHT

As Exley pulls in, his two-way drones:

As the report ends, Exley switches off the two-way and

gets out of his car.

INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

Accompanied by Bud, Dick Stensland crams the contents of

his desk into a box.  Well-wishing cops pat him on the

back, offer words of encouragement, but Stensland looks

like he's going to cry.

It's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face

with them.  This is hatred.

Acting on impulse, Bud goes after Exley.  It's a mauling.

Four vicious body shots.  A potentially lethal head shot

sails wide as Exley falls to the ground.

As four men move to hold Bud back, Exley looks up at him.

Dudley steps into the fray.  He helps Exley to his feet.

Four cops are genuinely having trouble holding Bud back.

Dudley watches with something bordering on admiration.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Accompanied by Bud, Stensland reaches his car, loads his

box of stuff into the trunk.  Bud is moody, pensive.

Stensland gets in the car, drives off.  Bud is left

alone.

INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

Exley sits alone in a sea of desks.  The SQUAWK BOX

DRONES.  Exley squints at the clock on the wall, can't

make it out.  He takes his glasses from the inside of his

jacket.  2:00 A.M.  Finally, something to do.  He walks

to the wall calendar, tears off Feb. 28 to reveal Mar. 1.

As Exley sits, the call SQUAWK BOX booms to life.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD AND CHEROKEE - NIGHT

Patrol cars.  Blues setting up a crime scene blockade.

Exley pulls up, DOUSES his SIREN.  PATROLMAN #1 runs

over.

Exley pushes him aside, heads for the door.  It's wide

open.

INT. NITE OWL - NIGHT

Exley takes mental snapshots.  Ten stools front a

counter.  The side wall mural-papered:  winking owls

perched on street signs.  On the right a string of

tables.  Three in disarray.  Food spilled, dishes broken.

A high-heel pump by an upended chair.

Heel drag marks across the linoleum floor heading back

toward the kitchen.  Exley follows.  Past an open, empty

cash register.  Outside -- SIRENS.

SERVICE RUNWAY

Crisscrossed drag marks connect, lead to a walk-in...

FOOD LOCKER

Blood-soaked bodies on the floor.  Five, maybe six in a

tangle.  Dozens of shotgun shells float in the pools of

blood.  As Exley struggles to maintain his composure...

Exley looks at a green-faced ROOKIE in the locker

doorway.

Exley shoves the Rookie, puking, out the door.

EXT. NITE OWL - NIGHT

Patrolmen hold back a swarm of reporters and rubber-

neckers.  HORNS BLAST.  Motorcycles run interference for

meat wagons cut off by the crown.  As Ed emerges,

reporters surge, shout questions.  Exley hurries past,

finds Dudley in command and barking orders.

Exley spots a photographer moving in.  He looks properly

serious as the flash bulb pops.

INT. NIGHT OWL - NIGHT

Forensics Chief RAY PINKER walks Exley and Dudley

through.

A FORENSICS COP approaches Pinker.

Exley and Dudley react, look at each other.

EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - DAWN

Set in a no-man's-land of bulldozed homes.  A sign

proudly announces the impending arrival of the freeway.

The motel is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence.

Abandoned but for a pair of LAPD cars and a light burning

in room 6.

An unmarked pulls up and Exley and Dudley step out.  They

start forward, but a SCREAM inside 6 stops Exley short.

INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - DAWN

Bare.  A table and chair bolted to the floor.  A tough

FLAT-NOSED GANGSTER is cuffed to the hot seat.  On the

table are a .45 and a fat roll of $100 bills.

Breuning and Carlisle watch as Bud White delivers a

couple of short, stiff body shots.  Flatnose is not used

to being on the receiving end.  All the same, we get the

idea Bud's a bit reluctant.

Bud's back is to Dudley and Exley who enter behind him.

Bud turns, sees Exley and Dudley.  A beat.  As Bud looms

over Flatnose, the gangster babbles.  Snitch-frenzied.

Dudley turns to Exley.

Uncuffed, Flatnose rubs his wrists.  Wary.  As Breuning

steps back, Flatnose snatches the .45 off the table.

Exley dives for cover, but the other four cops just stand

there.  Dudley looks down on the floor at Exley.

Flatnose looks at the gun a beat, then squeezes the

TRIGGER.  CLICK CLICK.  No bullets.

CLICK, CLICK.  They shove Flatnose back in the hot seat.

Dudley offers a hand to Exley, helps him to his feet.

INT. EXLEY'S PLYMOUTH - DAY

They drive in silence.  No love lost here.  Finally.

EXT. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

Exley pulls up.  Bud looks to him.  Really curious now.

INT. COUNTY MORGUE - HALLWAY - DAY

Exley and Bud walk.  An orderly wheels a covered corpse

toward them from the other end of the hall.  Bud's

spooked.  The orderly wheels the body in to the

examination room.

As Bud and Exley pass, the CORONER pulls back the sheet,

is surprised at the sight of a woman who we don't quite

see.

MORGUE MEAT LOCKER

Exley and Bud walk past a wall of drawers to where a

coroner's assistant waits.

The assistant pulls open drawer 12.  A naked man.

A tag on his toe and half his face blown off.

Stunned, Bud stares at what's left of his old partner.

Bud's torn between wanting to smash Exley and finding out

why Stensland is dead.  He squeezes out the words.

Then, from the hall...

INT. COUNTY MORGUE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

HILDA LEFFERTS, 50, enters with the coroner to ID the

body of her daughter, Susan.

There's stray buckshot in the upper chest and shoulders,

but a sheet hides the real damage.  It's the girl Bud saw

outside Hollywood Liquor.  Without the black eyes, she

does look like Rita hayworth.

As Bud and Exley appear, Mrs. Lefferts looks confused.

Exley doesn't realize, but Bud recognizes the deceased.

The Coroner lifts the sheet.  Mrs. Lefferts gasps.

As Mrs. Lefferts swoons, Bud and Exley both hold her up.

INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

The room buzzes, jammed to the rafters with every

detective standing ready.  The Chief waits as Dudley

Smith takes the mike, holds up an

Bud White listens, not too sure.  Stensland said he had

something big going on...

The room goes loud, a big rumbling.  Dudley holds up a

list.

Catcalls.  Boos.  The Chief steps to the mike.

The men exchange knowing looks.  The real message:  kill

them clean.  Exley doesn't approve.  As the men hurry

out...

INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

Detectives pairing up and moving out.  Scanning his three

name list, Bud joins his PARTNER for the day.

The guy looks at him a beat, nods.  As Bud heads off...

EXLEY

watches everyone go.  Wishes he could be part of the

action.  He spots Jack talking to his REDNECK partner for

for the day.

JACK AND REDNECK

Redneck chews tobacco, has a Texas drawl.

As Redneck thinks, Exley steps up.  He's overheard.

Jack stares.  Redneck shrugs, spits tobacco juice in a

cup.

INT. HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - DAY

Last time we saw the Owner was Christmas Eve.  He looks

up from a customer as Bud strides in, badge out front.

EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN, BRENTWOOD (PATCHETT'S) - DAY

A big, pink Spanish mansion with lots of tile.  Also last

seen outside Hollywood Liquor on Christmas Eve, Pierce

Patchett is in the front yard, chipping golf balls over a

koi pond.  They land in a tight grouping.  As he tees up:

Bud's halfway up the walk.  Patchett sees the cuffs

hooked to his belt.  Patchett is cool as can be.

Patchett studies Bud a beat, weighing his options.

Patchett's burly BODYGUARD starts over from the house.

If only Jack had been around to hear that.

Bud nods, his patience running thin.

Bud turns, heads down the walk.  Patchett hits his golf

ball.  It lands just past the koi pond, with the rest.

Ice.

EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM, LOS FELIZ (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

A modern-looking triplex.  A projector's flicker strobes

against the closed curtains.  We hear a PHONE RING.

INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

The film is

Lake.  It's projected on a wall in front of which stands

Lynn Bracken and an OLDER GENTLEMAN, in his underwear.

Lynn's long, blonde hair hangs down over one eye.  She

looks more like Veronica Lake than Veronica Lake.  The

film flashes over them as they kiss.

The PHONE RINGS.  Lynn ignores it as long as she can

before breaking away to go answer it.

She waves him off.  As he practices pointing his finger

like Ladd points a gun, Lynn reacts to the news on the

phone.

EXT. 9781 SOUTH DUQUESNE - DAY

A South Central plywood and tar-paper dive.  A BLACK

BOXER pounds a heavy bag/speed bag combo bolted to the

porch.  Wiry, a welterweight, he doesn't see Jack and

Exley till they're almost on top of him.

The Boxer leans on the bag to catch his breath.  Looking

them over, he finally nods.

Exley nods, this is true.  The Boxer's still listening.

Jack holds the DMV list out to the Boxer, who waves it

off.

Jack and Exley scan the list.  Jack's finger stabs down

on, "Coates, Raymond, 9611 South Central, Room 414."

EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

Lynn does her best to usher the slightly disheveled

Older Gentleman out the door.

As he begins to mash up against her...

Bud's standing at the bottom of the stairs.  The Older

Gentleman strikes a pose.  He still thinks he's Alan

Ladd.

Sputtering, the Older Gentleman exchanges a look with

Lynn then hurries away, giving Bud a wide berth.

INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

A nice breezy feel.  The perfect place to shack up.

Bud nods, eyeballs the place.

Bud watches her move to the bar.  God, she's beautiful.

She steps back with a scotch for both of them.

Lynn smiles again.  She likes Bud.  A beat.

Lynn starts toward the door.  Bud watches her a moment,

then follows.  She takes his glass at the door.

Out the door, Bud turns back.  Blurts:

Lynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away.

He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off.

A last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car...

EXT. TEVERE HOTEL - DAY

An L-shaped walk-up.  Jack coasts the car to the curb.

He leaps out with Exley.  Exley holds up at the sight

of a late model sedan.  He leans down to look in the

window at the two-way on the dash.

VOICES from the carport ahead.  We see a chrome bumper,

the purple fender of a '49 Mercury coupe.  A door slams.

Drawing a .45, Jack starts over with Exley, .38 in hand.

CARPORT

Toting shotguns, Dudley's boys from the Victory Motel,

Breuning and Carlisle, stand by the purple Mercury.  Jack

and Exley come around the corner, lower their guns.

Breuning wheels, pumps a round into the chamber.  He very

nearly fires before he sees who it is.

As Jack moves to peer through the Merc's window.

Jack spots them.  Three shotguns on the passenger side

floor, an empty box of shells and loose dollar bills.

Breuning actually has to restrain his partner.

INT. CORRIDOR - TEVERE HOTEL - DAY

Breuning and Carlisle lead the way with Jack and Exley

bringing up the rear.  Squinting, Exley reaches to his

pocket for something.  Not there.

The door to 414.  Two men on either side.  Breuning rears

back.  Jack rears back.  They kick at the same instant.

The door flies off its hinges to reveal two young black

men, LARRY FONTAINE and TY JONES, waking from a couple

of flop mattresses.

ROOM 414

Fontaine jumps up.  Entering, Carlisle aims, but Exley

grabs his arm.  The BLAST rips the ceiling.  Jack aims.

Fontaine freezes.  Jones doesn't dare get up.

Jack and Exley burst into a...

SECOND BEDROOM

Another black, RAY COATES, passed out on mattress, sur-

rounded by empty beer cans.  Jack sticks his .38 in his

back, starts to cuff him.  As the cuff ratchets down...

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

Dudley watches intently as Ed Exley skims a report,

memorizing names and dates.  Jack and other brass are

also here along with a stenographer.  So's Bud.  One of

these guys killed Stensland.  Through tinted glass, the

three suspects in three different rooms.

Satisfied, Exley sets the report down.

As Exley steps into the #1 room, Jack joins Dudley.

INT. #1 ROOM - DAY

Exley closes the door.  Ray Coates is cuffed to a chair,

dressed in baggy County denims.  One eye swollen shut,

lip split, a smashed nose with one nostril split.

Exley unlocks his cuffs. drops cigarettes and amtches

on the table.  As Coates rubs his wrists...

Coates just stares at him.

No bite.  Coates just stares back.

Unseen by Coates, Exley reaches under the table, takes

hold of one of three toggle switches.

Exley flips the toggle.

#3 ROOM

The speaker over Larry Fontaine's head crackles to life.

#1 ROOM

Exley flips up the second toggle.

Exley flips the switches off.

Coates nods.  Exley flips up the toggles as he leans

in.

Exley flips down the switches, stands.

Exley opens the door, looks back in afterthought.

Exley exits.

OBSERVATION ROOM

Exley enters.

Exley looks through the glass into #2.  Larry Fontaine

is weeping.  A piss puddle on the floor by his chair.

#2 ROOM

Fontaine tries to control his sniffles as Exley enters.

No answer.

No answer.

No answer.

No answer.

The voice is strong, full of conviction.  Exley

glances at the mirror.  Then...

Exley can't hide his surprise at this.

But Fontaine is gone.  Head lolling, eyes squeezing

out tears.

OBSERVATION ROOM

Exley steps out of the interrogation room.  Dudley

braces him.

Bud's all ears.

#3 ROOM

Reading, Jones has his feet on the table.  Exley

bursts in.

No answer, but Jones looks nervous.

OBSERVATION ROOM

Everyone's attention is riveted, particularly Bud's.

They watch, listen over the speaker.

No answer, but Jones is squirming.

Jack turns to Dudley.

They don't notice as the chair back begins to splinter

in Bud's hands.

#3 ROOM

Exley sits across from him, tries to wrap it up.

The door blasts open.  Bud slams Jones up against the

wall.  As Exley stands, he bangs his knee on the table.

Pulling a .38, Bud breaks the cylinder, drops 5 shells

on the floor.

Bud shoves the barrel into Jones' mouth, pulls the

trigger twice.  CLICK, CLICK.  Jones starts to slide

down the wall.  Bud jerks him back up, roars.

Two more clicks.  Jones spills.

EXT. AVALON BOULEVARD - EVENING

A four cordon.  They coast up to a GRAY CORNER HOUSE.

Dudley Smith behind the wheel of the lead cruiser.  Bud

White rides shotgun, reloading his revolver.

STREET

Bud is out the door and scooting down an alley.  Exley

moves to follow, but Dudley cuts him off.

ALLEY

Bud vaults a fence, pads up the back porch.  A screen

door.  Bud slips the catch with a penknife and walks

inside.

SCREEN PORCH

Bud heads for a blind-covered door.  Unlocked, he

enters...

A HALLWAY

Light bouncing from side rooms.  We hear the opening

spiel of "Badge of Honor" from the left.  Bud wheels into

a...

BEDROOM

A NUDE GIRL spread-eagled on a mattress.  Bound with

neckties.  One in her mouth.  Her eyes grow wide at the

sight of Bud, then flicker to the adjoining room.

Directing him.  Raising the .38, Bud enters...

THE KITCHEN

Sylvester Fitch sits naked at the table wolfing Rice

Krispies and watching "Badge of Honor" on a flickering

TV.  He looks up, sees the .38 before he sees Bud beyond

it.  Fitch drops his spoon, raises his hands.

Bud SHOOTS him in the face.  Dead, Fitch just sits there.

Bud moves behind him.  Pulling a spare piece from an

ankle holster, Bud FIRES back at the door from Fitch's

line of fire, then puts the gun in Fitch's hand.

We hear the FRONT DOOR CRASH OPEN.  As Fitch slides off

the chair to the floor, Bud dumps the Rice Krispies on

him.

EXT.  GRAY HOUSE - NIGHT

The Girl on a stretcher.  Being carried to an AMBULANCE.

Bud White walks alongside, looking like some ferocious

pet pit bull.  The ATTENDANTS get her inside.  One joins

her.  The other closes the door, pauses to light a smoke.

Bud rips the cigarette out of his mouth, nearly taking

the guy's lips with it.

One look at Bud, and the Attendant is running around to

the driver's side.  Exley arrives, steamed.

Bud starts away, but Exley gets right in his face.  Other

cops begin to take notice.  The ambulance pulls out.

Bud goes after Exley, but ten hands pull them apart.

Dudley on Exley.  Four cops genuinely having trouble

on Bud.

And as if things couldn't get crazier, shouts from the

cops on the street.  POLICE RADIOS CRANKED UP.

INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

Electrified, "Nite Owl Killers" on everyone's lips.

Exley strides through with purpose, beelines to a filing

cabinet.  Exley pulls the file he's looking for.  He

scans an interrogation transcript, reads to himself the

words he's looking for:

INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY

Police rush back and forth.  Exley hurries over to the

desk, but he's not there.

A few cops mumble they haven't.  As Exley decides what

to do, Carlisle from the original arrest steps over.

EXT.  1ST & OLIVE - DAY

Exley and Carlisle pull up across the street from a

four-story Victorian with paint peeling off the clap-

boards.  They jump out of the car toting SHOTGUNS.

Carlisle waits as Exley checks the mail slots:

"R. Navarette, 408. "

INT.  STAIRWELL - VICTORIAN BUILDING - DAY

Exley and Carlisle take the steps two at a time.

INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY - VICTORIAN BUILDING - DAY

pumps the shotgun, nods to Carlisle who kicks the door

in.

NAVARETTE LIVING ROOM

Exley and Carlisle burst in on four men eating sandwiches.

Fontaine and Caucasian NAVARETTE at a table.  Coates on

the floor.  Jones by the window.  Exley squints.

Fontaine and Navarette raise their hands.  A jostled BEER

BOTTLE CRASHES to the floor.  Reacting, Carlisle JERKS

the TRIGGER.  Fontaine goes down.

Navarette draws a .38, SHOOTS Carlisle twice in the

chest.  Exley BLASTS Navarette.

Screaming, Jones pulls a .45 from his belt.  Exley FIRES,

blowing him right THROUGH the WINDOW.

Coates draws and FIRES, makes a run for it.  A bad pull

takes out half a back wall.  Coates is out the door.

ELEVATOR

Coates makes it inside, frantically pushes buttons.

HALLWAY

Here comes Exley.  Stumbling, wiping Navarette's blood

out of his eyes, he closes on the...

ELEVATOR

Coates watches as the elevator doors begin closing.

HALLWAY

Exley charging.

ELEVATOR

The shotgun barrel juts through.  The doors bang against

it.  BLAM!

L.A. MONTAGE

TONY BENNETT belts "BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS."

INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - DAY

Exley returns to grudging respect.  His white shirt

flecked with blood, he's clapped on the back by Dudley

who dubs him "Shotgun Ed."  Exley doesn't enjoy it.  He's

numb, stumbling along.  As he notices the blood on his

hands...

INSERT - NEWSPAPER HEADLINE

NITE OWL HERO!  Over a photo of Exley.

EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE - DAY

A coffin is lowered into the ground.  A WIDOW leans on

the Chief's arm, accepts a tri-folded American flag from

Dudley Smith.  Exley drops a handful of earth on the

casket, has trouble getting the wet dirt off his hands.

A sea of dress blues.  Jack looks bored, dressed too

flashy for a funeral.  Bud looks grim, rain dripping off

the brim of his cap.  As a TWENTY-ONE GUN salute is

FIRED...

EXT. CEMETERY (SOUTH CENTRAL, L.A.) - DAY

Larry Fontaine's mother mourns alone as her son is

buried.

INT. CITY OF ANGELS HOSPITAL - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

nagging doubt.

EXT. ORANGE GROVE (ANAHEIM) - DAY

People cheer as bulldozers mow down orange trees.  A

banner heralds the future:  "On this site:  The World's

Biggest Amusement Park."  Cartoon characters dance among

the fallen trees.

INT. STATE ASSEMBLYMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Sitting behind a desk is the Older Gentleman last seen

doing his best Alan Ladd impersonation at Lynn Bracken's.

He stares emphatically at the SMARMY LAWYER who stands

before him holding a manila folder.

The Lawyer simply hands him a stack of photographs.  From

Lynn Bracken's apartment.  The first is the Older

Gentleman naked except for his socks and garters.

INT. STATE ASSEMBLY - CHAMBER - DAY

The Older Gentleman rises for an assembly vote.

EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - NIGHT

Rain.  A limo disgorges a heavy-set man who climbs steps,

knocks on the door.  Lynn answers in an evening gown.  He

gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her.

Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan

a look down the street.

Bud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened

silhouette behind the wheel.  Smiling a bit sadly to

herself, Lynn disappears inside.

This is no stake-out.  Bud watches after her with

yearning.

INT. TROCADERO CLUB - NIGHT

Cigarette girls and club photographer make the rounds.

Johnny Stompanato enjoys the frenzien floor show.

Loew awkwardly rides atop a sleek Palimono.

INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The crowd in a frenzy as Vincennes-snitch, the

welterweight black boxer, beats the shit out of a white

fighter.

INT. MIDDLE CLASS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A father holds out his hand, counts along as Jack slaps

$100 bills into his palm.  Maybe four thousand dollars.

Jack says something about "We appreciate your

understanding during this difficult time."  As "Badge of

Honor" comes on the TV, the father responds with "Goddamn

actors."

Leading, Jack looks through an open door where Brett

Chase's high school "Sweater Girl" is being comforted by

her mother.  As she locks eyes with him an instant...

INT. PIERCE PATCHETT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The monied johns watch horny as hell as "Ginger Rogers"

twirls around the room with a female "Fred Astaire."

Clothes fly as they spin.  Still, most eyes turn to Lynn

Bracken as she enters oozing that cat-girl grace.

EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Reporters scribble as the Chief speaks.  Uniforms

everywhere along with Exley and Loew.  Bus sits in the

back.

Exley steps up.  The Chief hangs a gold medallion around

his neck.  Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands.

Exley then accepts a handshake from Dudley.  The

policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm.

Dudley lifts the medal from his chest.

Exley uses the noise to have aprivate chat with Dudley.

Dudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as

more bulbs flash.

Exley considers his medal.  It is an appealing thing.

In the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat.  No one's

watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows

pretend smoke off the barrel.  As the song ends...

INT. VARIETY INTERNATIONAL PICTURES - STAGE 4 - NIGHT

A "Badge of Honor" fund-raiser for D.A. Loew's re-

election cmpaign.  Hot dogs and sauerkraut.  Fishbowls

stuffed with cash.  Jack is here, returns a smile half-

heartedly.  Loew sits with his wife and teenage daughter

as Brett "Joe Reno" Chase speaks.

Applause.  Leaving the podium, Chase smiles at Ellis

Loew's daughter who absolutely gushes.  Chase then winks

knowingly to Jack who returns a tired, humorless smile.

Jack scans the room.  An odd moment as Jack catches his

own reflection in a mirror across the way.  He puts a

hand to his face.  Is that him?

Jack turns to see Sid Hudgeons approaching.

Hudgeons scans the crowd, points someone out.

Jack spots Matt Reynolds -- one of the young actors Jack

arrested on Christmas Eve.

Even Jack's not immune to a comment like that.

As Hudgeons heads over, Hudgeons points out...

Reynolds gets a nervous bead on Loew.  Hudgeons realizes:

Hudgeons heads off.  Reynolds, plae, nods at Jack.

Jack doesn't really feel like talking to him.  Reynolds'

nerves won't let him stay quiet.

Jack remembers the name, plays along for what it's worth.

Jack recognizes the name, bluffs for more information.

Reynolds looks like he's going to cry.  Hudgeons returns

with a double Scotch straight up and a hot dog with

sauerkraut.  He hands the drink to Matt.

Reynolds downs a few gulps, looks across the room at

Loew.

Reynolds looks to Jack who gives a noncommittal shrug.

Reynolds nods, drains his glass and heads off.  Hudgeons

hands Jack a folded slip of paper.

Hudgeons takes out a President Grant $50 bill.  Jack

doesn't take it.

Jack takes the $50 as Reynolds returns, shaking his head.

Emboldened by Jack's promise, Reynolds heads off.  Jack

and Hudgeons watch as he strikes a conversation with Loew

who's captivated.  Hudgeons chomps a bite of his hot dog,

gives Jack the high sign, but Jack just feels like a pimp.

INT. VICTORY HOTEL - ROOM SIX - NIGHT

Screams.  A cauliflower-eared Cleveland mob enforcer on

the hotseat.

Breuning works him with a rubber hose as Dudley asks

unanswered questions.  Bud watches, revulsion growing.

More screams as the hose thwops down.  Bud looks away,

then shuffles blindly out of the room.

INT. VICTORY HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Bud runs water in the sink to drown out the SCREAMS.  It

doesn't work.  Finally, he leans down and sticks his head

under the stream of water.  That doesn't work either.

EXT. VICTORY HOTEL - NIGHT

Hair dripping wet, Bud makes it to his car.  The tires

spit gravel as he tears away.  Dudley appears in the

doorway, watching curiously.  As cauliflower continues to

SCREAM...

INT. BUD'S PACKARD - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - NIGHT

Bud watches Lynn Bracken's apartment,  Colored lights

play on the windows.  Shadows pass.  Finally the front

door opens.  There's Veronica Lake, all sparkles and

spangles, kissing another distinguished gentleman

goodnight.  Bud watches the man into a waiting limo.  As

it pulls away...

INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - LIVING ROOM -

NIGHT

Now Lynn just looks tired.  As she puts away Scotch

bottles and picks up empty glasses, there's a KNOCK on

the door.  Lynn sighs, become sultry Veronica Lake before

our eyes.

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

Bud stands there, filling up the door frame.

Bud looks at Lynn a moment, then down at his own feet.

Embarrassed.  She smiles.

Bud looks back up.  Lynn's smile fades as she studies his

face.  She's not going to ask questions.  Lynn looks at

him a moment more, then runs a hand through the blonde

hair covering one eye.

INT. LYNN BRACKEN'S (1736 NOTTINGHAM) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lynn comes to Bud naked, her hair brushed back.  Bud goes

slow, gently, takes time with his kisses:  like she was a

lonely woman he wanted to love to death.

Lynn plays off his timing:  her kisses back, her touches.

Finally, Bud forces himself to stop.  He pulls back so he

can see her.

Bud doesn't answer, but yes.

She kisses him.  Softly, drawing it out.  Not a job.  She

wants to make love to him.  And as Bud stops thinking...

EXT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE (HOLLYWOOD) - NIGHT

Jack sits in his car waiting.  He checks his watch...

1:30.  Well past midnight.

Jack decides.  MOVE WITH him as he gets out and crosses

the street.  The apartment is dark, the front door a few

inches ajar.  Suspicious, Jack listens.  Dead quiet.  He

enters...

INT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE - NIGHT

No one here it seems.  Till Jack nearly trips over a

body.  Matt Reynolds.  Soaked in blood.  Throat slit.

Jack looks down in horror as Reynolds seems to stare back

up at him.  Jack stumbles out the door.  We hear his CAR

DOOR SLAM shut, the SCREECH of RUBBER down the street.

EXT. 2345 HALBORO (HUDGEONS' HOUSE) - NIGHT

Jack pounds on Sid's door till lights switch on.

Hudgeons opens the door.  He's in his pajamas.

Jack grabs him, jerks him into the door frame.

Hudgeons starts away, but Jack grabs him.

Jack lets go of him, starts to ramble off into the night.

INT. AFTER HOURS CLUB - NIGHT

The BARTENDER walks down the bar to where Jack arrives.

As the Bartender turns for one, the only bill Jack finds

is the President Grant fifty.  The things he's done for

fifty bucks... As he looks up with despair at his

reflection in the bar mirror, the Bartneder sets down a

bottle and shot glass.  He plucks the fifty from Jack's

hand.

Jack grabs the bottle and starts out.

INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Spent, Bud and Lynn lie in bed.  SHe traces a finger over

his bicep as he muses on the ceiling.

Lynn's tracing finger stops on Bud's shoulder -- a small

white scar.

Bud looks away.  Lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about

it.

Lynn listens sympathetically.  Bud's opening up.

Frustrated, Bud pokes at his own chest.

Bud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of

himself.  Lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her.

Lynn nods.  That simple.

INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - EXLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Exley looks up as a CLERK enters holding two files.

EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY

Exley stands in the trees as a PARK RANGER approaches.

INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

Ray Pinker looks up from his microscope as Bud enters.

Pinker is ticked as Bud steps over to where a group of

Nite Owl crime scene photos are posted on the wall.  Bud

pauses at a photo which shows the floor around the table.

We see a high heel shoe, blood smears across the floor.

Bud wonders, maybe a puzzle piece just fell into place.

Pinker remembers something.

Pinker rummages a shelf for a glass jar which he hands

Bud.  Inside are two wax-saturated cotton balls.

Bud just stares at the picture of Susan Lefferts.

EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

A shingle shack dump.  Bud walks the front steps, RINGS

the BELL.  Hilda Lefferts answers.  She doesn't look so

good.

INT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Pictures of Susan smile down from four walls.  Vamp poses

on a nightclub floor.  Mrs. Lefferts is all twitchy and

nervous, her eyes darting to a closed door.

Mrs. Lefferts talks directly to a photo of her daughter.

Bud hands her a snapshot of Stensland taken in Tijuana.

Out of uniform.  She recognizes him.

Mrs. Lefferts' eyes go crazy, darting to a closed door.

Rolled towels are crammed against the bottom of it.

Bud starts for the closed door.

Bud kicks away the towels, opens the door, steps into...

DEN

Innocuous except for the smell.  It hits Bud right off.

As Mrs. Lefferts goes shrill, Bud beelines out the door.

EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

Holding a flashlight, Bud crawls under the house, into...

CRAWLSPACE

Bud elbow-crawls over the dirt, between wooden pilings.

There's a long burlap sack ahead.  It smells bad.  Bud

rips burlap.  A rat's nest explodes.  Bud sweeps a

forearm at them.  As they clear, he sees a gristle-caked

human skull staring back, a .38 hole in the forehead.

Undaunted, Bud tears the burlap back further.  He pats

the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet.  Bud checks

the ID.  "Turner Meeks."  Bus knows him by that name and

another.

EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - DAY

Bud crawls out, blinking sunlight and gulping fresh air.

Mrs. Lefferts is there.  She's scared.

Bud opens Meeks' wallet, pulls out a couple hundred bucks

and gives them to Mrs. Lefferts.

INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

Ray Pinker looks up from an autopsy as Exley enters.

The stiff is Matt Reynolds!  Pinker continues working

away.

As Exley's head swims...

EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY

Mrs. Lefferts waters the grass, watches as a car pulls

up.  Exley gets up, starts toward her.  She drops the

hose and runs for the front door  Exley cuts her off.

Exley spots the entrance to the crawlspace.  He hurries

over, enters nearly flat on his belly.  Mrs. Lefferts

calls in after him.

INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY

Jack sits unshaven and hung-over, the dregs of the Scotch

bottle on the desk.  He considers a framed "Badge of

Honor" photo:  Jack and Brett Chase, before a banner "To

Protect and Serve."  Jack punches a fist through it.

INT. LAPD - FORENSICS LAB - DAY

Exley walks alonside as a body bag is wheeled into the

lab atop a gurney.  Pinker steps over.

INT. JACK'S DESK - DAY

Sitting in disgust, Jack spots something amidst all the

clutter -- the Great Jerk-Off Books of 1962.  He flips

one over, looks at the Fleur-de-Lis stamp.  Jack

remembers something Matt Reynolds told him.  He dials the

phone.

As Jack waits, Exley appears in front of him.

Exley clicks off the phone.

Jack stands, heads out.  Exley follows; he needs help.

Exley watches as Jack continues down a hall.  Then:

Jack stops, looks back at him.

Jack looks like he might cry, but smiles instead.

Both men are quiet a moment.

So does Jack.

EXT. BROWN DERBY - DAY

A Packard pulls up out front.  Bud gets out, heads

inside.  Another car pulls up across the street.

CLOSE ON JACK

Watching Bud.  Jack gets out, starts across the street.

INT. BROWN DERBY - BAR - DAY

At the bar, Johnny Stompanato looks over as Bud joins

him.  Stompanato isn't happy about it, but he smiles

anyway.

Nervous, Johnny taps his pinkie ring on a bottle of beer.

Johnny taps his ring harder.  The bottle almost tips.

Bud's hand flashes out, grabs Stompanato by the crotch.

Bud loosens his grip.  Stompanato gasps for air.

DOOR

Jack peels in, catches a glimpse of Bud and Stompanato.

Too far away too hear anything, Jack quickly ducks out.

BAR

Stompanato's recovering.

Bud starts to raise a hand.  Stompanato cringes, but Bud

just slaps a twenty down on the bar and goes.

INT. BROWN DERBY - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Jack's on the phone to Exley.

EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

opens and Bud steps in.  Jack doesn't see who opens it.

EXT. BUSHES - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

LEAVES RUSTLE.  There's movement in the underbrush.  Jack

appears, followed by Exley.  Jack pulls a gun as they

near a window.

They press up to the glass for a partial view.  Bud White

sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet.

Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look.  This isn't

the Bud White they're used to.  A pair of woman's hands

take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin.

The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her

policeman.  It may have been a long day, but she's every

inch Veronica Lake.  Only the hair's not over her eye.

They stand, kiss again.  Lynn's gown spills down around

her ankles.  Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of

them disappear into a bedroom.  A long beat before...

INT. BROWN DERBY - ENTRANCE - DAY

Exley and Jack enter.

RESTAURANT

Exley scans.  There's Stompanato with a girl who looks

amazingly like "LANA TURNER."

Engrossed, Stomapanato doesn't look up till Exley's nearly

on top of him.

As Stompanato stands, Exley flashes his badge.

As Jack arrives, Lana tosses a drink in Exley's face.

Jack pulls him aside.

INT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PATCHETT'S) - LIBRARY - NIGHT

In a silk robe, the unflappable Pierce Patchett smiles

at Exley.  Jack stands alongside.

A beat.  Exley and Jack don't look like they appreciate

being joked with.  Patchett finally sighs.

EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN - NIGHT

Exley and Jack head for the car.

A call CRACKLES in over Exley's RADIO.  Exley picks up.

KNOCKING on the door.  Lynn answers to reveal Exley.

Exley lets it pass.  As he enters...

Exley can't help but smile.  Lynn smiles back.

Exley watches her as she steps over to fix the drinks.

She hands him his drink.

Exley stews.  Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass.

Exley's had it.  A menacing step forward.  Lynn's smile

becomes a laugh.  Lost to himself, Exley leans in and

kisses her.  Lynn pulls back, then kisses back.  In a

beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes.

As they trash the furniture, Lynn looks over his shoulder

at her own reflection in a closet door mirror.

REVERSE ANGLE - INSIDE CLOSET

Two-way glass.  Sid Hudgeons is in here SNAPPING

pictures.  As Lynn and Exley continue with their frantic

lovemaking...

INT. FORENSIC LAB - NIGHT

Ray Pinker rubs his tired eyes.

Pinker could care less.  As Jack's wheels turn...

INT. LAPD - RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT

Jack searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like 1939

and 1940.  Reading one headed "Meeks," Jack lets out a

low whistle.  He's found something.

INT. PACIFIC DINING CAR - NIGHT

Jack waits at the bar, watches the door anxiously.

INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Spent, Exley and Lynn sit, half-dressed, on the floor.

They're quiet.  Then, through a smile:

She actually embarrasses him with that one.

Exley shakes his head.  He's heard enough.

Exley doesn't answer, but the answer is yes.  Lynn

smiles.

As Exley kisses her...

IN CLOSET

Exasperated that he's still stuck in here, Sid Hudgeons

checks his watch, shakes his head in disgust.

EXT. 9608 VENDOME (SILVERLAKE) - NIGHT

Jack knocks at a darkened house.  The porch lights come

on.  The door opens to reveal Dudley Smith in his

bathrobe.

INT. 9608 VENDOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jack sits at the table while Dudley makes coffee.

Dudley walks over, hands Jack his coffee.

Jack shakes his head.  Dudley raises a REVOLVER.  He

FIRES it at point-blank range, right into Jack's heart.

Jack hits the floor, his cheek pressed flat on the

linoleum.

Jack opens his mouth to speak.  His lips form the words,

but no sound comes out.  Dudley crouches down beside him.

Dudley leans low, gives Jack an ear.  As he dies...

Dudley frowns in ignorance at the name.

INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Nothing mobilizes the police like losing one of their

own.  Dudley is at the podium along with Exley.  Dozens

of detectives take notes, including Bud White.

As the men move odd, Dudley approaches Exley.

Exley tries to look like he's thinking as Jack calls from

the grave.  Screaming the name Dudley!

As Dudley moves off, Exley watches him go.  Scared.

INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BUD WHITE'S DESK - DAY

Bud looks over as Dudley sits down across from him.

INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY

Pinker looks up as Exley enters.

A put-upon Pinker sighs.

Pinker goes to his desk for a twenty-year-old photo of

Meeks.  he hands it to Exley, whose wheels are turning.

EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - DAY

A RAIN STORM has turned the courtyard into a mud bath.

As usual, a light burns in room six.  Bud White parks

alongside the other cars already here.  He makes a dash

for the door.

INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM SIX - DAY

Sid Hudgeons is cuffed to the hot seat.  Dudley sits

across from him.  Dudley's henchman Breuning looms.  Bud

enters.

Breuning cuffs Hudgeons in the side of the head.

Breuning cuffs him again.

Bud looks over at mention of the name.

Dudley sighs, looks to Bud.

Hudgeons flinches as Bud steps up, twice Breuning's size.

Bud digs a fist into Hudgeons' gut.  As Hudgeons gasps to

get his breath back.

Bud looms, rests his hands on the back of Hudgeons'

chair.  He doesn't like where this is going.

Wooden slats pop as Bud tears the bolted chair right out

of the floor.  Hudgeons and the chair land sideways.

Bud can't hear him.  He uprights the chair one-handed.

As his fist cocks back, he's restrained by Breuning and

Dudley.  This is no act.  They can barely hold Bud back.

Bud breaks free, heads outside.

EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - HUDGEONS' CAR - DAY

Bud jams a tire iron into the trunk seam and pops it with

a ferocious yank.  He tears at the carpeting.  A manila

envelope.  Bud rips it open and 8x10 glossies of Exley

and Lynn spill out.  Raindrops dot them, as Bud's in his

Packard and tearing out of there.

INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - DAY

Dudley and Breuning watch from the door.

Breuning laughs.  So does Hudgeons.

Dudley and Breuning stare at him.  A bit grimly.

But no one moves to do so.

As Hudgeons protests, Dudley slaps a hand over his mouth.

As Breuning and Carlisle move in...

INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY

A wormish CLERK searches dusty filing cabinets with dates

like 1939 and 1940.  The same ones Jack looked through.

Exley steps over from another row.

Exley ponders the implications.  Taking out the photo of

Meeks, he gets an idea.

EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

Blue, Lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down.

A SCREECHING on the wet street as Bud's PACKARD pulls up.

She watches as he gets out and starts for the house.

Lynn stands, holds her arms out.  Bud stops short on the

steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him.

Lightning flashes.  Bud shakes hs head.

More lightning.  Lynn looks God-awful sad.

Too tired to lie anymore, Lynn finally just nods.

Bud backhands her, hard.  Lynn faces straight into the

next one as Bud hits her again.  A third time as the sins

of the father are visited on the son.  Bud stops short as

the self-realization slams home.  Lynn waits stoically.

She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back

into the rain.

INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY

Drawers are open.  Files are everywhere.  Exley's reached

the end of the line.  As he looks through one last file,

he finds a stack of official photos.  Then he stops

short.  There's a photo of four cadets and an academy

instructor.

Two of the cadets are IDed as Turner Meeks and Dick

Stensland.  The instructor is Dudley Smith!

Exley looks up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS and Bud is

there.  Fury.  He slams Exley, knocks him flat.

Bud's here to kill him.  He hauls Exley up, pummels him,

then throws him over the table.  Then up into a wall.

Plaster cracks.  Bud's on some gonzo animal plane.  Bud

strangles him.  Exley gags.  It'll be over in moments.

Until Exley's flailing hands finds Bud's .38.  Yanking it

from his waistband, Exley smashes Bud in the forehead.

Bud reels.  But, blind with rage, he moves back in only

to have the barrel of the .38 placed right between his

eyes.

Bud shakes his head.  He's coiled, ready to make a move.

Bud hesitates, the answer obvious.

Exley points out the academy photo on the floor.

Bud sees, but does he really?  As Bud reaches for the

photo, Exley relaxes slightly.  Bud slaps the gun away,

drops Exley to the ground.  He grabs, begins slamming his

head into the floor.

Exley's almost out.  But maybe Bud heard him.  The attack

slows, stops as Bud does think.  Exley stays conscious.

They just stare at each other a beat as it sinks in.

Bud smiles.  For a second he likes Exley.

EXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN (PIERCE PATCHETT'S) - DAY

Exley and Bud make their way up the walk.  Bud pulls his

.38 from its shoulder holster, shoves it in his

waistband.

FRONT DOOR

Exley RINGS the BUZZER.  Looking back, Bud sees a

pitching wedge and pile of golf balls abandoned in the

grass.  A single ball floats in the koi pond.  Bud's eyes

narrow at the sight.  Not like Patchett at all.

And Bud shoulders the heavy door right off its hinges.

INT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN - HALLWAY - DAY

Bud draws his .38 as he strides in.  Exley tries to keep up.

Double doors on the left open into a library.  Bud stops

short, slowly lowers his gun.  Exley steps up beside him.

LIBRARY

Hanging from a ceiling light, Patchett's body slowly

twists around, a toppled chair beneath him.

Bud goes to the body while Exley heads for a side table

on which rests a typed sheet of paper.

Bud checks Patchett's right hand, the knuckles are split,

two of the fingers badly distended.

Bud dashes to the PHONE, dials.  It RINGS.  No one

answers.

Bud shoves the phone into his hand.

EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY

A county sheriff's unmarked parked out front.  A DEPUTY

behind the wheel.  Exley's Plymouth pulls up behind.  The

Deputy gets out.  MOVE WITH him as he steps BACK TO

Exley, who's rolling down his window.

Exley looks at Bud.  Bud looks down in shame.

As the Deputy moves off.

INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

A SECRETARY looks up as Bud and Exley beeline Loew's

door.

INNER OFFICE

Loew looks up as they burst in.

A beat as Loew considers his options.

Loew enters his bathroom.  Bud looks to Exley who nods:

Go.

OFFICE BATHROOM

Loew is at the mirror clipping a few stray nose hairs.

Bud enters full of menace followed by Exley.

Bud just glares at him.  Loew shakes his head.

The MIRROR SPIDERWEBS as Bud slams Loew's face into it.

Bud swings him around, forces him forward and shoves his

head in the toilet.

He holds it there, finally lets Loew up for breath.  Then

backhands:  one, two, three.

More backhands.  Holding Loew by the scruff of the neck,

Bud marches him past Exley and back into the...

INNER OFFICE

Bud heaves up the window, practically throws Loew through

it.  Loew catches hold of the window framing.  Bud

hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him

through.

OUTSIDE

Bud holds his leg.  Loew screams as coins, comb and

wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the street

below.

INNER OFFICE

Bud shakes Loew, could drop him at any time.

OUTSIDE

We hear Loew's PANT LEG TEARING loose.

More TEARING.  Loew's life may depend on the answer.

INNER OFFICE

Exley helps pull Loew back inside.  Bud dumps him on the

floor.  Bruised and bloodied, Loew looks up at Exley.

Exley pulls his .38, shoves it into the side of Loew's

neck.

Loew looks at Bud, nods, his face a bloody mess.

EXT. CITY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Exley and Bud exit.  Bud's wheels are turning.

Bud just stares at him a beat.

Bud looks away, shakes his head "no."  Finally...

INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - HOLDING ROOM - DAY

Lynn looks up as Exley enters.  her face is puffy,

swollen.

A blank look from her.

A beat as Exley wonders how he should interpret this.

Lynn looks away, can't help an ironic smile even as she

starts to cry.  As Exley gives her his handkerchief...

INT. LAPD - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Bud waits at the cage window as a RECORDER returns with

some information.

As Bud thinks, a ROOKIE-TYPE approaches.

EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - SUNSET

Bud's Packard crests the rise looking down on the

Victory.  Exley's Plymouth is in the courtyard.

INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - SUNSET

Exley in the hotseat.  Sitting there thinking.  At a CAR

DOOR CLOSING, he goes to the door.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Exley opens the door as Bud approaches, toting a shotgun.

The sun is down.  The sky is just a dull glow.

As the reality sinks in, Bud and Exley hear TIRES on the

GRAVEL; CARS are COMING.  Being in a concavity, they

don't see them yet.  Then the CARS STOP.   But still Bud

and Exley can't see anything.  They hear the CLICKS of

CAR DOORS OPENING, but they don't hear them shut.  There

are FOOTSTEPS, MURMURED WHISPERS.  More CARS PULL UP.

Exley starts for his car, but Bud holds him back.

A beat.  Resigned, Exley nods.  They retreat back to Room

6, disappear inside.  A beat.  There's MOVEMENT in the

shadows to the left.  To the right.

INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - NIGHT

There's a big back window.  Bud covers most of it with a

ratty old mattress.  He pumps the shotgun.

He pulls a .45 automatic from his waistband.

He throws the auto to Exley, pulls out a .38.  Bud's

armed for bear.

Bud switches off the light.  They wait in silence.  Then:

A CREAK outside the front door.  Bud levels the SHOTGUN.

BOOM!  The DOOR is BLOWN OFF ITS HINGES.  We see the

figure of a man sprawl back in the dirt.  In the darkness

beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES from all around.  Exley and Bud

RETURN FIRE.

We hear the BACK WINDOW BREAK under a MUFFLED BLOW.  Bud

charges back, yanks down the mattress revealing two men

climbing through.  Sitting ducks:  torn apart by THREE

TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS close in.  A beat, then...

Bud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering WHOOP.

A third man looks through the window.  BOOM!  Bud nails

him.

Bud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window.

EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting

the room.  Two sets of feet shuffling along.  Bud FIRES

the SHOTGUN.  Shrieks as the men go down.  Bud extends

the .38 to fire point blank headshots.  Then...

Bud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM

6.

INT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

Exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains

down.

The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in.

Four men with rifles.  One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard.

They spot Exley lying there.  Hushed whispers as they

approach:  "Dead meat."  "Be careful."  Kicks in the

side.  The men look at each other, sneer.

Exley jerks a foot.  The foot man stumbles as Exley spins

around SHOOTING.  FIRING the .45 and his own .38.  All

four men go down.  Exley stands, digs into his pocket to

reload.

Bud scrambles back through the window.  Exley looks over

and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun.  It's dead quiet.

At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door.

He's got Exley dead to rights.  As he squeezes the

trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the

ground.

The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder

blade.  It spins him around.  A SECOND SHOT to the

stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley.  A

THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes.

Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat.

He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest.

Bud falls hard.

Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to

shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud.  A frozen

moment.

Dudley aims the .38, cocks back the hammer.  We hear

DISTANT POLICE SIRENS.

Dudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket.

It's over.  Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger.  But

Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left

calf.  It took all Bud had left.  As he collapses...

Dudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun.  Dudley

FIRES, misses.  A wild SHOTGUN BLAST takes out half the

wall.  Dudley stumbles out the door.  SIRENS BLARE.

EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

Dudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down.  Exley

steps out behind him, but doesn't drop the shotgun.  The

two of them are bleached white by headlights.

Dudley raises his badge over his head.

Exley steps ahead to block his way.

Exley doesn't answer.  Dudley smiles.

Exley glares.  Laughing, Dudley brushes by, limps toward

the gathering policemen.

The SHOTGUN BELCHES flame.  Dudley goes down, shot in the

back.  Exley drops the gun, raises his hands over his

head.

A midnight assembly.  The Chief, D.A. Loew and several

high ranking brass.  Their attention riveted

THROUGH the one-way glass into...

INT. ROOM #1 - NIGHT

Bloody, exhausted, Exley sits across from two INTERNAL

AFFAIRS DETECTIVES.

As Exley begins...

TELEVISION SCREEN

Honor" is:  "Dedicated to the memory of technical advisor

Sergeant Jack Vincennes."

INT. ROOM #1 - NIGHT

Exley stares across at the Internal Affairs Detectives.

As Exley looks to the gray-tinted wall mirror...

OBSERVATION ROOM

Loew leans over, whispers to the Chief.

INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Exley in his dress blue uniform.  The Chief smiles, pins

gold stars to his shoulders.

Applause.  Flashbulbs.  Lynn watches from the back as

Exley runs a handshake gauntlet.  Finally, he spots her.

She's returned to her natural brunette.  Looks even

better.  Exley steps over.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Exley walks Lynn out.

Lynn gestures ahead.  They walk to her car.  She opens

the back door.  Bud's in the back.  Braces on his legs,

head sutured.  Jaw wired shut and tubes running in and

out.  But his hands still look strong.  Bud forces a

smile through the wires, tries to say something, but

can't.

Exley takes his hand.  Bud squeezes till both men wince.

Exley slips his Medal of Valor into Bud's hand.

Bud takes it, turns away so Exley won't see the tears.

As Exley steps back, Lynn closes the door.  PARTY noises

drift from upstairs.  Exley looks to Lynn.

A beat.  Exley wishes he'd gotten the trip to Arizona.

She kisses him on the cheek, gets in the CAR.  STARTS it.

Exley looks back at Bud.  Bud presses his hands to the

glass.  Exley touches his side, palms half the man's

size.  Hands against hands.

The car moves. A turn into traffic, a good-bye TOOT on

the HORN.  Exley's all alone.  As he watches them go...
