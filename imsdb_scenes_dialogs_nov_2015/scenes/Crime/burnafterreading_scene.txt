Palmer jumps in:

A beat.

Another uncomfortable beat.

Stunned silence.         Ozzie turns to look at Peck.

At length:

He gropes, uncomfortable.

Palmer nods at Olson.

Osbourne gets to his feet, agitated.

Wider shows the cocktail party, meagerly attended but in full

swing. Besides Osbourne and Katie there is Harry Pfarrer

(who has just inquired about the cheese), bearded, forties,

rugged; his wife Sandy; and a shiny-faced young couple, Doug

and Tina Magruder.

Osbourne holds a cocktail tumbler.

Harry looks at him coldly.

He eats a piece, cupping one hand under his mouth.

Katie tries to separate the two men by including Doug

Magruder.

Ah. I'm on the legislative side, I                 *

work with Senator Hobby.                           *

Harry laughs.

Choking on piece of cheese, coughing

Why?!    For fuck's sake, Ozzie!

I'm just----I don't know.    I got so

tired.

You're tired.

Tired of swimming against the current.

Uh-huh.

Independent thought is not only not

valued there, they resist it, they

fight it, the bureaucracy is

positively----

Did you get a pension, or severance or

something, or----

I didn't retire you know, I, I quit.

I don't want their benefits.

But I suppose my benefits are all

right, I suppose you can live with

those, is that the idea?

It's not like that's the only way to

make money.

Yes?    Yes?     What're you gonna do?

I'll do some consulting.

Consulting.

Yes, to help while I----I've always

wanted to write.

Write.    Write what.

No, only guys do. I submitted a

et cetera. I'm really looking for

Him?

No, before.

Him?

Yeah.    He uh, he might not be a loser.

How can you tell?

That's a Brioni suit.

Oh yeah?

He looks like his optometrist has a

He reaches into his wallet.    He pulls out a picture:

A snapshot of a soulful man in a dark robe and a high caftan

standing on a curb in front of a large stone building.

Linda shrieks:

Ted nods gravely.

He looks at the picture for a sad beat, then shrugs.   He

stuffs it back in his wallet.

Through a mouthful:                                              *

It now drops onto his shirt.

Krapotkin leaves.

CLOSE ON OSBOURNE

Sitting in a bar booth, staring, incredulous.

Across from him, a man of Osbourne's age.

Osbourne stares.

The man responds only with a shrug and a commiserating head-

shake.

Osbourne struggles to compose himself.

He leans in, voice lowered.

Osbourne looks.

There are two men with drinks at a booth. At Osbourne's look

one of them, who has been staring, looks hastily away.

The man meets his look again.   He smiles, rises, ambles over.

Osbourne extends a hand.

He smiles as he deposits a large manila envelope in

Osbourne's extended hand.

He nods toward his companion, watching from the booth.

The man walks off; his friend hastily knocks back the rest of

his drink and rises to follow him.

Osbourne stares stupidly at the envelope in his hand.

So let's figure this thing out!

Chad, your Berry Blast is ready.

We know who he is

Right: Osbourne Cox.

So we can find out where he lives,

right?

Um.    I guess.

You should change.   Into your suit.

Why?

So you don't look out of place in the

neighborhood. There are certain

elementary things.

His neighborhood?

Beyond, the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and

stairs. Harry arrives at the top of the stairs. He nudges

back a drape on the window at the top of the steps. He looks

down one way, then the other. He lets the drape fall back

and seems to relax.

Harry enters the bedroom. He strips off his shirt and steps

out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master

bedroom. He leaves the door open.

Chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but

stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the

curtain whipped back. Harry emerges from the shower. He

rinses off, humming "Born Free," and walks into the

foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress

pants that was draped across a bureau.

Chad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches.     Harry

stops, just outside the cracked door.

Through the crack we see only the white of his shirt.

Abruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room

and bends to pick something off the floor.

Chad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again

as Harry approaches.

Chad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown

pinstripe coat that matches Harry's pants.

The closet door is thrown open.

Harry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder

holster in his other hand and----BAM----shoots Chad in the face.

The gun bucks. Unused to the recoil and still screaming,

Harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and

drops the weapon.

He crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles

off on all fours. In the hallway he rises and tramples down

the stairs.

Harry walks cautiously over. With a bare foot he

experimentally waggles one of Chad's feet. Limp.

Harry nudges the door.

It creaks fully open.

Chad's face is a powder-burned, chewed-up mess.

He gingerly crouches down.

He tries to avert his eyes as he feels in Chad's suit

pockets.

He comes away with a wallet and hastily stands.

Inside are a few dollars and nothing else: no credit cards,

driver's license; empty.

He leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason

feeling obliged to return the wallet.

As he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside

pocket he notices:

The suit label has been cut away.       He fingers the raveled

fringe.

He straightens up again.

He seats himself facing the desk. A desktop nameplate

identifies his superior as Gardner McC. Chubb.

Palmer hands a folder across, grimacing.

Palmer shakes his head.

Gardner Chubb is flipping bemusedly through the contents of

the folder.

Ted sighs.

Linda looks at Ted for a beat, thinking.

She takes his hand.

Ted swallows.   He looks down.

Linda still has his hand.      He tries to cover his reaction to

the physical contact.

The phone beeps.    A voice comes through the intercom:

She punches a button on the phone.

Looking at her, Ted sighs. He shakes his head sadly, rises

and goes. Linda pushes the door of the cubicle shut with her

foot.

Beat.

Another beat.

118   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                               118 *

The chopping stops.

Harry slaps the knife down.   He stares at Katie, jaw

grinding, for a beat.

Through grit teeth:

Katie, unused to backtalk from Harry, is stunned.   She

returns in a manner as hard as his:

Her fingers form quotes:

Harry glares at her, vibrating with rage.   Her look at him is

equally hard.

Harry abruptly turns and stomps up the stairs.

Brief tromping on the second floor.   Katie sits in puzzled

suspense.

Footfalls descend the staircase.

121   EXT. STREET ACROSS FROM TOWNHOUSE - DAY                         121 *

Harry stares at the man underneath him.     The gasping man

explains:

Harry is blindsided.    He stares.   He slowly sits up,

digesting:

The freed Tuchman Marsh man also sits up, still panting

heavily.

Harry rises and walks stiffly, zombie-like, up the street.

The man watches him go.

After a few paces Harry stops and sits on the curb.    He

starts weeping.

The man, still breathing heavily, calls out:

Harry's cell phone chirps.     He fishes it out and unfolds it,

sniveling.

Harry stares, trying to fit this in.     Osbourne prompts, after

a silent beat:

Harry again stares: maybe he has this figured wrong.

After a silence:

Echoing up the street:

Linda is dumbfounded.

A silent beat.

Krapotkin fishes something from his pocket.

Krapotkin stands with the disk extended toward her.

Linda recovers from her astonishment and is moved to outrage:

Linda, the whole thing is crazy. It

was crazy the first time, and you want

to do it again? Break into the man's

house? And why would----why would----you

said the Russians didn't even want

this stuff!

My world is bigger than that, Ted.

There's other people. There's the

Chinese.

Linda, these surgeries----

It's not just the surgeries, Ted!

It's not just the money! We can use

it as leverage! To get Chad back!

What do you mean "get him back"!

Information is power, Ted!     Hel-lo!

What do you mean "get him back"!      You

don't know where he is!

Somebody has him.    And we can----

You ask the police to help you find

missing people! And you----

I can't take it! I can't take it! I

can't take it! You know I can't do

that! We're operating off the map

here, Ted! This is way higher than

the police, it's higher than that!

Linda, I----

I need a can-do person, Ted! I hate

your negativity! I hate all your

reasons why not! I hate you! I hate

you!

Linda enters, handing him a drink.    She sits opposite.

Harry looks up, surprised.

He catches himself.   His gaze wanders back to the haunted,

empty spot.

Linda starts quietly weeping.

This focuses Harry's attention.    He looks at her as if just

now noticing her.

Harry moves next to her and puts an arm around her.

He squeezes her shoulder, takes a gulp of the drink.

Harry squeezes her shoulder again.

Del and Connie and Sandy all wear smiles that stay fixed a

beat too long. Then Del relaxes and turns to Sandy.

She gives them a cold smile as a technician finishes

unclipping her lavaliere and she leaves.

Connie looks at Del and mouths "Bitch."

Linda chimes in:

Linda and Harry

Harry reaches for Linda and she slides closer.     He puts an

arm around her.

The thought drifts away as his gaze fixes on something.    With

his look still fixed:

Linda follows his look.

On a bench a short distance away a middle-aged man with

aviator glasses and hair plugs is staring at them.

A slightly overweight woman stops tentatively in front of

the man in the aviator glasses and they start to talk.

Linda turns to Harry.

Relaxing now that he sees the man in aviator glasses engaged

in conversation, Harry warms to his theme.

Harry has stopped chewing.    He is staring at her.

Linda feels obliged to fill the silence.

Harry stares.    Linda doesn't know what to make of his fixed

stare.

Harry is beginning to look sick.

A long silence.

Then, quietly:

Now Linda stares, unsure of what to make of the question.

Linda's eyes widen.   She is a little frightened.

People nearby turn to look.   It is a scene.

Harry reaches up.    He grabs her by the shoulders and shakes.

Ted shakes his head.

BANG.

Ted is shot in the upper chest.

He grabs a three-hole punch from the desktop and flings it at

Osbourne and charges.

BANG----another shot goes off.

Ted barrels into Osbourne, knocking him over----

----and goes on past him, lumbering up the stairs.

Osbourne gets to his feet.
