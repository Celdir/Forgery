FADE IN:

EXT. GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY

A majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the

Columbian highlands.  A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and

then another.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  The view changes and tiny

dots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH.

CLOSER

We realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel

machetes in slow methodical rhythm.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  WE SEE

the South American Indian MEN clearly now.  Their tar stained

teeth.  Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.  Their

jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect

the harvest.

EXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY

Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized

bales speed along the narrow road.

EXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY

The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the

leaves.  Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after

armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a

gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire.

The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke

streaks the sky.  Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel

ashes into the pot to cool the solution.

INT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY

A primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the

equipment.  The machinery.  The solutions.  The over-sized

vats.  Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport

automatic weapons at all the points of entry.  The coca is

now a "basuco" paste and is being sent in for a wash.

INT. LABORATORY - COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY

A conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine

hydrochloride.  The bricks are wrapped, tied up, weighed, and

bags and the plane takes off.

across the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.  A long

way from being the boss.

INT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY

George stands in line to register for college, wearing his

Brooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair.

The room is crowded and the line is long.  Bob Dylan's

"Subterranean Homesick Blues" blares out of one of the kid's

transistor radios.  George looks around the room.  He is

uncomfortable.  He catches his reflection in the shiny glass

partition and stops.  He doesn't like what he sees.

Something is not right.  He looks like everyone else.  Same

cookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie

cutter faces.  He's a carbon copy.

It's George's turn but he doesn't hear it.  "Twenty years of

schooling and they put you on a day shift."  The words hit

him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own

reflection.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY

George sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a

lunch box.

him.

GONZALES, 21.

SERIES OF SHOTS

Barbara and Maria introduce George and Tuna around to the

despite their ill fitting shorts and Tuna's unhip black

socks.  The beach scene is one big party.  Lots of beer,

music, bikinis, and good times.  By the end of the day,

George and Tuna have a hundred new friends.

The weed comes out and is passed around.  Pipes.  Joints.

Bongs.  In SLOW MOTION, Barbara takes a huge hit of grass,

grabs George's face, french kissing him, and giving him a

huge shotgun.

INT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY

George and Barbara are sleeping late.  Their bodies

intertwined beneath the sheets.  A slam of the front door

wakes them up.  It's Tuna.

George and Barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the

kitchen to find Tuna holding a brown paper shopping bag.

Tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the

kitchen table.  It's a grey mound of stocky, seedy marijuana.

Barbara examines the reefer.

George, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door.

They walk in.

INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS

George, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is

California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at

the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures,

manicures.

DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate,

especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by

beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut

and runs to embrace her.

Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all

around.

George and Tuna stick out there hands.

Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter.

After the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his

playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now.

Derek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out

from under a sink and sets it down in front of George.

George and Tuna look at each other.

his cellmate quickly clears everything off the top bunk.

The room looks at him.  They ain't buying it.

inspections.  It's a long walk.  George's heart beats hard.

The sound is audible and grows with every beat.  BA-BUMP.  BA

BUMP.  Cesar lurks at the baggage carousel.

George stands in front of the customs agent.  He tries his

best to look relaxed as the agent reviews his documents.

BA-BUMP.  BA-BUMP.  The heartbeats are very loud.

George's breathing is labored and his swallowing reflex

doesn't seem to be working.  Cesar passes through, eyeballing

George the whole time.

George opens the Samsonites.  Super dry mouth.  BA-BUMP.  BA

BUMP.  The beats are deafening now.  Cesar nervously monitors

the situation from the payphones.

George winks at the customs agent, who shakes his head before

finishing the inspection.

Diego, Cesar, George and JACK STEVENS, a silver haired

executive type, lounge around the mini-suite.  Cesar still

has that crazy look in his eye.

A beautiful Latin woman enters and kisses both Diego and

Cesar.  Her name is INEZ, and friendly she is not.

The men proffer their hands, but she just looks at them like

ants before sitting down next to Diego.

Inez addresses Diego and Cesar only.  She speaks in Spanish.

The conversation is about "Why Friday?"  Inez has some

problem with it.  Diego explains.  And Inez is reassured.

He indicates George, Diego and Jack Stevens.

Diego and George look at each other.

Diego nods.

This is too much for Inez to handle.  She starts screaming

machine gun Spanish.  Something about a "lousy two-hundred

and fifty-thousand dollars," and how Diego is "such a coward"

to give away all his money.  Diego is embarrassed but tries

to remain calm.

But Inez is wild.  She starts in again, a log of "Putos

(SOB's)", and "Cojones" and "Maricones (gay/sissys)."  Even

Cesar is uncomfortable.  Diego stands.

Inez takes a swing at Diego and catches him full across the

face.  Time stops in the room.  Question.  What will Diego

do?  Answer: SMACK!  Diego swings back and a full scale is

on.  Cesar continues the conversation.  It's surreal.  As if

Diego and Inez weren't beating the shit out of each other

right in front of them.

Stevens thinks about it.  Kids as collateral.  Inez and Diego

are still duking it out.  But Diego finally gets the upper

hand and drags her into the bedroom.

Cesar walks him to the door.

Diego calls from the other room.

INT. LA BELLE MER - BEDROOM - LATER

Diego has put Inez in the bathroom and is holding the door

closed.  She pounds and kicks and screams in frustration, but

George is pinned against the wall and the Colombian men all

start screaming at him in Spanish.  There seems to be a

problem.  A man, ALESSANDRO, steps forward.  He is the one

George's puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his

face.  Alessandro presses it against George's front teeth.

George nods.

He indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of

cocaine.

George sits on his bed, reading.  Two duffel bags are tucked

At one-hundred and eighty-seven degrees, the white powder

dribbles off the hotplate and melts away.

Mr. T puts his nose in the powder.  George pulls Foreal

aside.

INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT

Money everywhere.  All over the floor, the counters, the

chairs, and even in the sinks.  George and Derek count the

money patiently, writing the dollar amount in yellow high

lighter on the top of each stack, before wrapping it with a

rubber band.

George divides the money.  There's a hell of a lot.

INT. AIRPORT - MIAMI - DAY

Immaculate in his white turtleneck and sunglasses, George

EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - LOS RIOS, COLOMBIA - DAY

The blazer pulls into a long driveway.  They approach a gate

where SHIRTLESS TEENAGERS with MAC-10's stand guard.  The

gate opens.  YOUNG SOLDIERS open the door for George and

roughly usher him over to a Jeep within the confine.  They

frisk him top to bottom.  Diego is leaning against another

Jeep and waits for George to be released.

The sound of a young man, a MALETON, struggling can be heard

in the distance.  From another area, PABLO ESCOBAR emerges.

He is singular in purpose.  He is handed a pistol and moves

quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words.  And

then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head.

George and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch.  Escobar is

handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his

hands, as he moves back.

George hesitates.

The large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where

the maleton was just shot.  George looks back at Diego as he

is led away.

Escobar moves over to embrace George.  George returns it, and

their hands come together.  George can't help it.  He

reflexively looks at his hands.  Escobar understands.

Escobar looks at him with a cold stare.  But George doesn't

flinch.  His face reveals nothing.  Finally, a smile breaks

across Pablo's lips.

Diego watches the two men walk outside.  Escobar throws an

arm around George's shoulder.  Pablo hops into a Jeep and

motions for George.  The bodyguards come running.  But Pablo

waves them away.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - COLOMBIA - DAY

Escobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it.  Before

them is a stunning panorama.

Escobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to

respond in full.

Escobar looks at George a long time.  He's inscrutable.

EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - ENTRANCE - DAY

Diego is a little pissed off for being left for so long.  He

taps his foot and picks at his fingernails.  Escobar and

George pull up in the Jeep.  Diego leaps to his feet.

Escobar wraps his arms around Diego in an embrace.

MONTAGE - GEORGE AND DIEGO TAKING OVER THE WORLD

The following images are overlaid with snow falling and money

lines being drawn off mirrors.  The effect is surreal and

dreamy.

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

A duffel bag is unzipped, revealing bricks and bricks of

cocaine.  Each marked with a "P."  A knife punctures one of

the bricks.  A mound of white powder is brought up to a man's

nose.  It's George who samples, and then it is sampled by the

man he is doing business with.  The shot widens TO REVEAL all

the participants and dozens and dozens of duffel bags.  A

handshake seals the deal.

always notably absent.

INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT

The money is so high, it almost reaches the ceiling.  There

is nowhere to put it.  George and Diego sit at the coffee

table, dwarfed by the stacks of bills.  There is a

discrepancy in the count.

George starts to pick up the money.

George moves down the hall looking for a place to stack the

money, but there is no more room.

George opens the back bedroom door to find wall-to-wall

money.  It's packed.

No luck there, either.  George drops the money on the floor

and moves back into the living room.

INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

A huge reception.  All the pomp and circumstance Colombian

money can buy.  Politicians.  Policemen.  And every smuggler

north of Colombia.  George sits with Diego and Inez at the

table of honor.  Inez is opening presents.  Diego's tipsiness

is a little out of character, but hey, it's his wedding day

and a little champagne never hurt anyone.  He drunkenly

throws his arm around George's shoulder.

George notices MIRTHA showing teeth across the room.

They kiss.  George walks across the dance floor directly

towards Mirtha.

Cesar arrives.

He kisses her.

They leave.  George looks back, Mirtha is giving him more

teeth.  George arrives at the table.  Various greetings.

They all agree.  Mirtha still gives George the teeth from

across the room.  Diego returns to the table.

George exits after Mirtha.

INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

George steps into the empty lobby looking for Mirtha.  He

She blows him a kiss from the adjoining lounge chair.  He

blows one back.  She licks her lips and it's on.  He's out of

the chair, pouring champagne over her tan body, and licking

it off.  She squeals with delight.

A table gets knocked over as they cause a commotion.  A hotel

manager comes over, but George hands him a wad of cash and he

quickly fucks off.

INT. MIAMI NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT - MAGICAL REALITY

The dancing is in SUPER SLOW MOTION now.  Passionate, carnal,

intimate.

There is no white dress.  There is no tuxedo.  George and

Mirtha haven't even taken off their sunglasses.

They kiss.  Mirtha wipes her red nose.

INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

George moves to the bedroom.  Mirtha is pregnant and she's

showing.  She's also bent over a mirror with a straw in her

hand.  George opens the door and takes her by surprise.

INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - LATER

Mirtha and George lead Fred and Ermine from room to room,

showing off the house.  The decor is, well, eclectic.  It

doesn't match the architecture.

George and his father move outside.

EXT. GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

George and his father walk.

They move along the rear of the house.  Classic cars line the

driveway.

He turns and looks at his boy.

INT. HOLIDAY MOTEL - LITTLE HAVANA - 1978 - DAY

Diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker.  His

eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of

the back of his pants.  He knocks the dust off his nose

before moving outside.  George is on the porch, smoking a

cigarette.

George doesn't have time for this.  He checks the cylinders

on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind.

But Diego won't get off the soap box.

A black sedan pulls up and FIVE PUERTO RICAN MEN approach the

room.  George and Diego greet them and lead them inside.

It's game time.  The atmosphere is charged with danger and

everyone is acutely aware of everything.  The guys sit down,

their guns bulging through the inside of their suits.  The

suitcases are opened.  The rules are the same.  No English.

No raising voices.  No sudden movements.  George offers their

leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined.

The count starts.  George and Diego riff through ten thousand

dollar bundles.  Diego is still acting pissy.  He's mumbling

to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around.  The

guys keep a close eye on him.  Diego finishes a stack, throws

one of the bags on the ground.  The conversation is in

Spanish unless otherwise indicated.

The pressure is getting to one of the hoods.  His name is

BENNY.  He's got a crazy eye and he seems ready to snap.

George resumes the count, but Diego won't get off it.

The men all reach for their pieces and all hell starts to

break loose.

The guns are out and pointed.  It's out of control now.

George steps forward with the keys.

BLAM!  Courtesy of Benny, George is hit.  The shoulder, the

collarbone.  It's hard to tell.

Tony very carefully takes the car keys.

The men slowly back out the door.  George looks at Diego.

EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

George and Diego exit the terminal.  George's arm is in a

George and a very pregnant Mirtha move through the crowd to

find Augusto.

As Mirtha leaves, Augusto throws his arm around George's

shoulder.

Augusto lets out a big laugh.

Augusto throws an arm around George's shoulder.

Augusto says nothing.  But the ball is dropping in Times

Square.  10, 9, 8, 7...

Happy New Year.  Streamers, confetti, and champagne.  George

marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone.  He's

steaming.  The music is up, so he has to scream.

INTERCUT

Derek Foreal in full New Year's regalia, complete with party

hat.

George's face scrinches in pain.

Waiting for him is Cesar.

INT. THE YACHT CLUB - SUNSET

The Yacht Club is a tavern style bar that juts out over the

water.  The crimson sky streaks the windows.  Diego looks

like Che Guavera.  His hair is long, and a graying beard

sticks through his gaunt face.  The bar has been taken over

by Diego's BANDITOS.  Automatic weapons and PROSTITUTES

accent this drunken setting.  George is escorted through the

door by Cesar, and the room quiets.  All eyes on Diego and

George.  Diego rises.

There is a pause.  Diego's goons ready their weapons as Diego

scoops up a cringer with his pinky and sniffs.

One of the men says something in Spanish and everyone laughs.

George is furious.  He starts to tremble and his face turns

red.

George lunges at Diego and is immediately grabbed.

They lead him away.

EXT. YACHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS

George is getting the shit kicked out of him.  His teeth

broken, kicked in the head, the body, the groin.  His arm

stomped.  Blood and broken bones.  It's a king size beating.

The men prop him up and Cesar reaches back and hits him with

a haymaker.  CRACK.  George's nose is broken.  Blood spurts

everywhere.  George is dropped to the ground, spit on, and

left for dead.

A beautiful, sprawling estate.  A family barbecue, Colombian

Escobar embraces George for a moment, and then George starts

to move away.

Fred, Ermine and Mirth are waiting for George in the car.

Mirtha's water has broken.  Ermine honks the horn from the

back seat and screams out the window.

He finally gets it together, but before he runs out the door,

he does one last blast.

INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - MATERNITY - DAY

Mirtha is on the birthing table and screaming in pain.  She's

crowning.  George wears hospital scrubs and a surgical mask.

He and his saucer pupils hold Mirtha's hand in comfort.  The

baby comes, and DOCTOR MICK BAY slaps it's behind and cuts

the cord.  Tough ass Mirtha breaks down and sobs

hysterically.  But something is wrong with George.  The color

drains from his face.  He grabs his chest and falls over onto

the floor.  The MEDICAL STAFF attends to him.

The doctor grabs George's wrist.

INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - LATER

George lies in the recovery room, sedated, tubes everywhere.

He's hooked up to IV's, monitors, and machines.  Dr. Bay

Blowing money right and left.  Shopping with Mirtha, buying

INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - 1985 - NIGHT

The Eastham house is all done up for a party deluxe.  Fully

catered, with bartenders, waiters, music, the works.  And of

course the three c's, champagne, caviar and Colombians.

George is laughing with Augusto and Martha Oliveros, but when

Derek Foreal appears in the doorway, George excuses himself

and walks over.

George throws his arm around Derek's shoulder.

Mirtha runs in with a giant crystal punch bowl filled with

mother of pearl.  She holds it over her head triumphantly.

A very underweight Mirtha nervously runs around the party,

shoving coke up everyone's noses.  She is gakked to the gills

and out of control.  Her pupils a mile wide.

Singing.  The birthday cake is brought in, the candles are

blown out and everyone cheers.

Mirtha runs over to her husband, still holding the cocaine.

She's sweaty, her hair matted down on one side.

She tries to push a line up his nose.

Mirtha's loud now and making a scene.  He thinks about it.

Everyone raises their glasses.

A party guest comes running inside.

The WAITERS, in their white jackets, exchange knowing looks.

The BARTENDER comes out from behind the bar.

In an instant, all of the waiters' guns are out.

George pulls up to the front.

Ermine's back is to George.  She won't look at him.

a lot to say but nothing's coming out.  George hands Fred a

gym bag.

one another in the doorway of the old house.

George breaks away and moves to the T-bird.

face.  Nervous.

He gets up and moves to the BANK MANAGER.  They move to

another MANAGER TYPE.  And another.

And then everyone disappears behind closed doors.  Finally,

the BANK PRESIDENT emerges and moves over to George.

George starts to shake.  The bank president tries to explain,

but whatever he says is unimportant.  George is paralyzed.

INT. APARTMENT - LIBERTY CITY, FLORIDA - NIGHT

An inexpensive one-bedroom furnished apartment.  It ain't

much, but it's home.  Mirtha has just received the news and

is losing her mind.  Clara Blanca is cooking dinner.

Kristina sits there.  She hears everything, so does Clara

Blanca.

She storms into the bedroom and slams the door.  George

stands there.  Awkward silence.  George goes to Kristina.

Tough question to answer.

Kristina nods "no."  They embrace.

INT. GEORGE'S THUNDERBIRD - MIAMI - NIGHT

The car moves along I-95.  George is driving while a jacked

up Mirtha does a speed bump.  A cop is following in the

distance.  It is not okay.

George tries to fend her off.  The car swerves all over the

road.  It's turned into a full scale fist fight.  The red

lights of Florida's finest come up behind them and George is

pulled over.

room.

Kristina yanks her arm away and they get into a heated

argument.  Through the glass, George can't hear the words but

it's clear that Kristina doesn't want to be here.

Mirtha forces Kristina over to the glass and keeps showing

her, prompting her to talk.  Kristina stares at George

through the glass.  Cool.  Defiant.  Angry.  She picks up the

two Broncos and the back of a truck.

WE FOLLOW the duffel bags out of the Bronco into the house.

The boys sit around as George samples the product.

George leaves the room.  The camera slowly pans back to the

guys.  Something doesn't look right.  They have not moved.

They look bummed.  Leon looks at G.G.

The CAMERA PANS BACK SLOWLY to the bathroom door, George

comes back into the room, dancing.  He goes and sits down

with the guys.

George is the only one smiling.  No one is looking at him.

He looks at each one.  He slowly realizes something's up.  He

looks to Dulli finally.

EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - CONTINUOUS

George turns around as a GUARD taps him on the shoulder.

George looks up to find Kristina being buzzed through the

gate.  She moves through the open area and onto the grass

quickly.  SLOW MOTION: Father and daughter come together at

last in a long embrace.

He hugs her hard.

Kristina looks at her father, smiles, and disappears.  There

was no Kristina.  The guard continues to tap.

George looks up to find a prison guard.  His name is GUS, and

he helps George to his feet.

The shadows grow long, and Gus leads George down a cement

path that cuts through the grass.  The huge structure of

Otisville looms dark against the sky, and Gus and George take

the long walk back.

EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - DUSK

Standing outside the fences, Kristina smokes a cigarette as

she watches her father being led away.  After a few moments,

she turns around, walks to her car and gets in.  Time to go

home.  And as the brown Mazda pulls out of the driveway, the

taillights turn red, growing smaller and smaller, until they

finally disappear.

THE END.
