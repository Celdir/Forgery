FADE IN:

A PAIR OF SMOKESTACKS AGAINST AN ORANGE AUTUMN SUN SKY...

THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL: A CEMETERY in the

foreground. TOMBSTONES blend into a NEVER-ENDING SEA OF

MIDDLE-CLASS ROW HOUSES in the distance, and nothing seems

to separate the two. A NEWLY DUG GRAVE is in the LOWER

LEFT-HAND CORNER of our FRAME.

MILITARY DRUMS. HUNDREDS of POLICEMEN, in their DRESS

BLUES, ENTER from FRAME RIGHT. A FEW COPS CARRY a COFFIN.

SUPERIMPOSE ON THE SCREEN'S LEFT SIDE: THE FOLLOWING WORDS

FADE IN--PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH:

New York, New York.   1988.

A new breed of narcotics has swept the great city, bringing

with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in

recent memory.

The old criminal order is gone. In its place, new ethnic

groups rise up to seize control without respect for

traditional rules of engagement.

Outmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and

scandal, the Police find themselves burying one of their

own at the rate of twice a month...

The WORDS TURN BLOOD RED, then DISAPPEAR. The POLICE LOWER

THE COFFIN when they arrive at the SITE. As we begin to

ZOOM INTO a CLOSE ANGLE ON THEM, we HEAR MUSIC. A THUMPING

POP BEAT. THE CLASH'S "ROCK THE CASBAH"...

CLOSE ON: BOBBY GREEN, thirty. He is passionate and vital

and handsome, a real physical presence. His CLOTHES are

stylish, expensive. A sly SMILE. He steps forward, into:

INT. STOREROOM

The camera MOVES with him to SEE: ROSARIO DIAZ, twenties,

dark-skinned, impossibly gorgeous. Leaning up against the

wall, biting her lower lip, eyeing Bobby with true desire.

CONTINUED:

She beams. They kiss, PASSIONATELY. SUPERIMPOSE:

"BROOKLYN". They really GO AT IT. They are ferocious; as

they DEVOUR each other:

Then we HEAR a fist BANGING ON A DOOR, a MUFFLED VOICE:

No ANSWER--they're too busy making out. Then, MORE

BANGING. They both START LAUGHING. The voice continues:

She grabs him; he moves back in, starts MAULING her again.

She SLIDES DOWN his body, perhaps to perform fellatio...

INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM

A huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. Decadent,

pure New York. BOBBY emerges from the back room area,

straightening out his outfit. ROSARIO is behind him,

fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club.

Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he

appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his

name. He is having a blast.

Bobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of

Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch.

He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S "HEART OF GLASS."

Bobby waves hello to people, greets them ("Hey, baby!"), a

pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a

swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt,

claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES

every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN.

WE WANT HIS LIFE. SENSUOUS, SEDUCTIVE, INCREDIBLE FUN.

CONTINUED:

A MAN waves to BOBBY. Bobby SEES: seated at a table,

surrounded by his gang: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Thirty-five, acne-

scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. One of his men,

PAVEL LUBYARSKY, is next to him. Bobby nods back to them.

NEAR THE COAT CHECK

Rosario meets up with several of her girlfriends, and we

SEE an OPERATION at work: people come get their coats,

slide the coat check girls a HUNDRED BUCKS, and with their

coats the patrons get JUNK put in their jacket pockets.

Rosario looks to one of her girls--ALINA, a young Russian

with too much makeup--and counts the cash. Pockets some of

it. From Rosario's BEHAVIOR, we SEE she's INVOLVED in the

DRUG TRADE.

INT. THE FRONT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT - LOBBY

A HUGE FIGHT that's breaking out. Violent. Club patrons

and SECURITY GUYS are in the melee. Girls SCREAM. ROSARIO

moves past all this, to the front door. LOUIS FALSETTI,

forty, backs off from the multiple struggles all around

him. Louis is wearing a jacket that says "SECURITY" on it.

He is the jocular type, very overweight, redfaced. Bobby

arrives at the fight scene. With cheery braggadocio:

Bobby moves RIGHT IN. Grabs a struggling and drunk PATRON,

puts him in a headlock. He gives the Patron a SHOT TO THE

TEMPLE, just to keep him docile. Lou, Bobby's best friend,

watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly

detachment, CHORTLING with every punch and scream. He

balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding

spillage. But the BATTLE GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER. Seeing

his friend Bobby, who's hardly got everything in control:

The Patron is acting up again, trying to free himself from

Bobby's grip. Bobby looks down at him. With humor:

CONTINUED:

Gives the guy a shot in the head. Meanwhile: LOUIS

saunters past the melee, jumping gracefully over a fallen

drunk. He BOWS in triumph when others applaud his leap.

Everyone laughs as he goes out the door. Bouncer FREDDIE

helps clean up the mess. A GIRL SCREAMS as a GUY is

flipped on his back by bouncers. A PATRON with BLOOD ON

HIS FACE, acting like an eight year-old, to Bobby (who

hurls his guy out of frame):

INT. STAIRWELL

Wood-panelled walls. Bobby walks upstairs, fixing his hair.

INT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - FOYER/LIVING ROOM

An ornate, gaudy place. The walls are covered by mirrors

with that cheesy brown marble pattern print all over them.

Plush couches, clutter. Bobby walks in.

We HEAR RADIO MUSIC up here, nothing like the stuff played

downstairs. A RUSSIAN CROONER. In an EASY CHAIR sits

MARAT BUZHAYEV (pronounced BOO-SHY'-EV). He is old,

kindly, weakened by age; sits next to his babushka wife,

KALINA. Buzhayev watches a Russian musical program with

the sound off, listening to his small transistor radio.

CONTINUED:

Bobby leans over, hugs the seated old man. The two EMBRACE

WARMLY--they are close. Before separating, Buzhayev

touches his face. KALINA yells happily in RUSSIAN, grabs

BOBBY, embraces him too. She couldn't be more motherly,

amd Bobby BEAMS at the treatment.

Bobby is moved, almost embarrassed by the loving attention.

Then, gently dropping a set of KEYS on a side table:

Marat smiles.    Then, as Bobby stands:

Bobby lights up, nods. Marat pats his cheek. Kalina tries

to give him a small care package of food. He politely

refuses, and a minor and friendly AD-LIBBED argument in

Russian ("He said he didn't want any food, and you keep

trying to give it to him!") breaks out between the old

husband and his wife. As Bobby exits:

EXT. QUEENS CATHEDRAL - SUMMER EVENING

A modern church. A big crowd in front, made up of POLICE.

We HEAR MUSIC. CLOSE SHOT of a black outdoor sign, behind

glass. "OUR LADY, QUEEN OF MARTYRS CHURCH, QUEENS, NY".

TILT DOWN: WHITE PRESS-ON letters CROOKEDLY spelling out

"NYPD PULASKI SOCIETY MTG. - 7 PM". SUPERIMPOSE: "QUEENS".

INT. QUEENS CATHEDRAL - BASEMENT

The MUSIC explodes down here. A large room with columns.

Streamers, balloons everywhere. Old cops, young cops, men,

women, are here. Skinny, portly, giddy, drunk.

CONTINUED:

Many are IN UNIFORM, loosened up a bit, like they've just

gotten off work and it's time to relax. Children run

about. American, New York State flags. Pictures on the

walls: people with plaques, portraits. ARCHIE BUNKER'S NEW

YORK. A SIGN READS: "CONGRATULATIONS! TO `CAPTAIN JOSEPH

GRUSINSKY'". Cases filled with trophies. Food tables,

piled high. And beer. Lots and lots of beer.

Many COPS are drinking, cavorting, smoking CIGARS, making

sandwiches. And DANCING UP A STORM. Men and women FLIRT,

GAB, MAKE OUT. FLASH! Pictures taken constantly. A mass

of people surround TWO PEOPLE as a PHOTO is taken:

ANGLE ON: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY, thirties. Bobby's OLDER

BROTHER. In uniform. Clean-cut, though not neurotically

so. Sharp, tough features--the GLOW of a WINNER. He is

SMILING, receiving many AD-LIBBED CONGRATULATIONS and

holding one of his children in his arms, infant PAUL. Next

to him is his wife, SANDRA, thirties. Next to her, their

older infant, TEDDY.

NEXT TO JOSEPH: BURT GRUSINSKY, sixty. Bobby's father, we

will soon learn. Tough as nails. Unsentimental, ex-

military, rough-edged, vital. In this world, he is a king.

Standing behind Burt are his two closest associates:

MICHAEL SOLO ("G.Q."), fifties, somewhat urbane, and JACK

SHAPIRO ("Pudge"), also fifties. A big, quiet man. Huge

hands. The enforcer. Burt is beaming over his treasured

son. He directs a PHOTOGRAPHER, repositions Joseph:

FLASH!

Burt waves to the Photographer, then leans again into

Joseph's ear. Still wearing a smile for the outside world:

CONTINUED: (2)

INT. CAR - OUTSIDE THE CHURCH

A CLOSEUP of ROSARIO.    Beat.   Then:

Bobby seems reluctant.   Then:

ANGLE ON BOBBY as we go to:

INT. CHURCH STAIRWELL

We MOVE past partygoers. THEN, APPEARING AT THE TOP OF THE

STEPS: Bobby and Rosario--who's being eyed up and down

salaciously by the men in the party. The two start to come

down the narrow stairs leading to the basement. A portly,

ebullient man, RUSSELL DE KEIFER:

CONTINUED:

Bobby slinks past De Keifer.     Rosario touches his arm:

INT. BASEMENT

A wiry YOUNG POLICE REPORTER, in uniform, moves to Joseph.

Burt stands nearby, proud:

The Reporter reads his question off a small pad.      (VERY

important that he come off like an amateur.)

Someone hits his arm.     He drops his pad, picks it up.

CONTINUED:

ACROSS THE ROOM:

Bobby and Rosario come down the stairs. Bobby immediately

SEES his family, though they don't see him yet. To

Rosario, quiet:

ACROSS THE ROOM

Bobby approaches, looks over to Sandra. The two nod an

AWKWARD HELLO. Then the two brothers meet. We SEE the

relationship between them. Strained, but a warmth deep

UNDERNEATH:

CONTINUED:

SIMULTANEOUS: Burt motions to JACK, MICHAEL.      The two WALK

UPSTAIRS. Burt steps forward.

Burt and Joseph take one look at her and respond with

subdued "hellos." She is not exactly, well, PROPER-

LOOKING. And she isn't white. She picks up on this, tries

to act as though she doesn't care. Burt turns to Bobby:

ANGLE ON BOBBY. This gives him pause, but Rosario gives

him a slight nod of her head, assuring him it's okay. So:

INT. CHURCH - UPSTAIRS

Jack and Michael are walking through the seemingly empty

main hall of the church. Looking for anyone who may be

hanging out, ducking in and around. They spot a COUPLE,

making out in one of the pews. The man is shirtless, the

woman in her bra. Caught, they let out an embarrassed

CHUCKLE. With offense, but also humor:

The couple sheepishly exits the room, pulling on their

clothes. As they do, they pass: Bobby, Burt, and Joseph

coming up the stairs. Joseph pulls up the rear, standing

behind his father. Bobby sees Jack and Michael, now seated

several rows back. BEAT, then:

Bobby gladly gives a nod of recognition, sits down in an

empty front pew. Burt brushes lint off his son's shoulder:

CONTINUED:

Joseph speaks up, diverting Bobby's attention:

Joseph eyes his father with trepidation, then begins:

Bobby looks behind him. He's SURROUNDED. Interrogation-

style, his brother at the fore, Bobby nonetheless remains

calm, almost cheery. To Jack, in the back:

CONTINUED: (2)

Jack steps forward, a PHOTO in hand.

Puts the PHOTO in front of Bobby. MUG SHOT of an acne-

scarred, dark-eyed man we've seen before: VADIM NEZHINSKI.

Not amused, they withdraw the photo from in front of Bobby.

Bobby's sense of humor disappears now.

CONTINUED: (3)

Michael Solo pipes up from the back:

Bobby is still focused on his brother, then to his father:

Burt remains stoic. (Though silent so far, he should be a

HUGE presence in the scene--others look to him for

reaction, approval, etc.) Joseph sharpens:

CONTINUED: (4)

Burt gestures to Mike and Jack, and they exit. Joe doesn't

respond at first. Then, begrudgingly, to Bobby:

Joseph lingers, leaves. Father and son. ALONE. Then,

staring straight ahead as he takes a drag of his cigarette:

Bobby starts to leave.   Burt grabs his arm:

CONTINUED: (5)

Bobby turns his back on Burt, getting up to walk

downstairs. Burt remains emotional, reaching out to his

son when Bobby is not looking, lowering it to no avail.

INT. BASEMENT

The music is off now. Bobby comes down, Burt follows.

Joseph is getting something whispered in his ear by another

cop. A squat man with a bad toupee starts to speak: NYPD

Deputy Commissioner SPIRO GIAVANNIS.

Rosario is leaning up against a post, drinking, watching

the party. She stares down a GUY who OGLES HER

LASCIVIOUSLY. With a sense of humor, she winks at him:

Bobby approaches Rosario, grabs her hand:

He tugs her away.   She stops him.   With assurance:

CONTINUED:

She hurriedly puts down her drink. Joe stands near Spiro,

but his attention is on his brother:

APPLAUSE.    Bobby, Rosario move to the exit.   SIMULTANEOUS:

CHEERS.   Joseph smiles, waves.   Filled with hubris.

APPLAUSE for Burt, who waves, steps up:

BIG APPLAUSE as JOSEPH STEPS FORWARD. BOBBY AND ROSARIO

squeeze through the crowd, to the stairs.

CONTINUED: (2)

BOBBY STOPS. Instinctively, he turns back to the room,

motions to Rosario to stop. Out of respect. She does.

Then: the CHURCH BELL rings. TEN TIMES. Silence. The

BELL GONGS. The CAMERA DOLLIES PAST: JOSEPH and his

family, and JACK, and MICHAEL, then past ROSARIO, and BURT,

and BOBBY. The bell stops. The SEA of BLUE, the POLICE,

genuflect. Our characters do not. Instead, BOBBY STARES

at JOSEPH AND BURT across the crowded room. They return

the glare, and Bobby exits...

EXT. QUEENS STREET - FRONT OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The camera TILTS UP to an apartment window.   We CUT INSIDE:

INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

MUSIC UP: PRINCE'S "HOUSEQUAKE." Hot girls and flashy-

looking guys. The men are drinking. The women make

themselves up en masse in front of a large mirror over the

sofa. A couple KISSES in the corner. Everyone's getting

ready for a night of revelry on the town. They are

SINGING, having a GREAT TIME. The decor is late `70's,

though not exaggeratedly so. DRUGS are EVERYWHERE. We

MOVE PAST THIS TO:

INT. BOBBY'S BEDROOM

PAN around the ROOM: a set of weights on the carpeted

floor, with clothes scattered everywhere; on the wall, a

Jets football schedule, a Led Zeppelin poster. Bobby is

PRIMPING in the mirror. Rosario stands on Bobby's king

bed, DANCING SENSUALLY to the music in a state of partial

undress. She MOVES with great FREEDOM, puffing on a JOINT.

Bobby sees Rosario in the reflection; his face lights up.

CONTINUED:

Bobby opens his top drawer to get a watch. REVEALS

THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS in CASH, hidden underneath a fake

drawer bottom. Traces his fingers across the money with

private pride, then puts on the watch. Rosario bounces

down on the bed. Reaching under the bed sneakily, she

pulls out a small box. She hides it. Then:

Bobby approaches her.       Takes a puff of HER JOINT.   Then,

INTIMATELY:

Bobby pushes her down on the bed. Starts kissing her on

the neck, lips, then breasts. Caressing her hips, he leans

back and looks at her, observing the brightness and

kindness of her face. Her eyes--mild, calm, and truthful--

and her smile carry him into a wave of tenderness. He

moves in to kiss her again, and under his breath:

She takes out a little JEWELRY BOX.

CONTINUED: (2)

He opens it.   A CHAIN.   A SIMPLE GOLD CHAIN.

She takes it out, puts it around his neck. She has a HUGE

SMILE, EAR TO EAR. He looks at her, moved. A FLOOD OF

EMOTION. Sotto:

Bobby gently spreads her legs, starts to rub the inside of

her thighs. Then moves to her breast. Kisses her with

love. Rosario clutches him, secure. The DOORBELL RINGS.

INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

A mussed Bobby ENTERS from the bedroom, passing the party.

Bobby opens the FRONT DOOR: Louis, Hazel. Thrilled, he

waves them in. When the rest of the room sees Louis, THEY

SCREAM "JUMBO!" He holds his arms aloft, as if greeting an

adoring crowd.

As EVERYONE GUFFAWS, Freddie the bouncer yells out:

CONTINUED:

Bobby laughs happily, knowing this is bullshit. Hazel

shakes her head, joins the gals. Louis starts emptying his

pockets. Out comes a pharmacy. DRUGS SPILL all over a

formica endtable. Louder:

Bobby laughs again, PINGS Louis on the ear. Lou grabs his

head, but ignores the needling. Louis looks up, observes

Bobby's clothes:

CONTINUED: (2)

Bobby starts to punch Louis in the arm, playfully but hard.

Rosario enters the room, singing along with the song that's

playing (YAZ'S "SITUATION"). She moves to Bobby's side,

mock punches Louis' stomach too. To the gang, with CHEER:

INT. POLICE STATION - WEAPONS DEPOT

SILENCE, except for the CLICKING of GUN MECHANISMS.

The troops gird for battle, checking their weapons. JOSEPH

is here, as are Jack and Michael and a whole gang of cops.

Bustling by a set of lockers. Very businesslike. Joseph

cleans his piece. Michael leans over to him:

Joseph clicks his weapon into place.

Joseph is deeply troubled by the prospect.

ANGLE ON JOSEPH.

EXT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB

Mob scene.    Bobby and Rosario and Louis and the gang enter.

INT. EL CARIBE - CLUB ENTRANCE

Bobby gleefully shakes hands upon entering, then splits

from the group. Rosario joins several girls as they fix

themselves up in front of large lobby mirrors...

INT. MARAT'S APARTMENT - FOYER/LIVING ROOM

Opening the door is Kalina, who embraces him.   In Russian:

A grown woman, Marat's daughter MASHA, waves while sifting

through a stack of FURS on the sofa. One of her young

children, a daughter, holds her hand.

INT. DINING ROOM

Marat sits at the head of a table with lots of FOOD

(including a HUGE SMOKED FISH) on it. He waves Bobby over,

ebullient. ELI MIRICHENKO, Masha's husband, is seated

here, too--trying to talk to his young toddler SON. Bobby

sits down, next to Marat.

The toddler runs to Bobby. Bobby lifts the youngster onto

his knee; as he bounces the child on his knee, he turns

back to Marat:

Marat nods, waves to Kalina for drinks.

CONTINUED:

Marat nods, considering this. Reaches to the FISH. He

takes the EYE out of the fish and starts to suck on it.

Daughter Masha stands behind her seated husband, holding

and bouncing her little girl. ELI antes up, to Marat:

Marat waves him off.    Turns back to Bobby, re Eli:

CONTINUED: (2)

Marat grins from ear to ear.   Excitedly, he nods.   Then:

The two hug. Bobby is being shown out by Kalina, and is

about to depart when Buzhayev calls to his wife in Russian:

She reaches for her purse.   But Bobby refuses graciously,

waving it off as he exits:

INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM

A LARGE NEON SUN is lowered from the top of the theater.

Sitting on it, singing: `80's POP STAR TAYLOR DANE. The

CROWD GOES NUTS. As this happens: BOBBY ENTERS, sits down

at a table against the back wall. Louis is next to him.

CONTINUED:

Without a word, Louis motions:

ACROSS THE ROOM

At a large CORNER TABLE: VADIM NEZHINSKI, seated in the

center. Surrounded by two YOUNG GIRLS and Slavic-featured

men and dark-skinned Latinos. A LATINO MAN and one of

Vadim's guys, a YOUNG DARK-SKINNED WHITE MAN, converse at

the table. After a beat, the two men MOVE TO THE COAT

CHECK AREA. CASH stacked on the edge of the table.

ROSARIO appears, coming through the crowd. She goes to

Nezhinski's table, counts out MONEY for him. Nezhinski

appears affectionate with her, sticks some of the BILLS in

her hands. Bobby turns away from Vadim's sight.

The CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSE-UP on LOUIS:

INT. MEN'S ROOM - FLASHBACK

It's the men's room in the club. Louis is in the stall,

his pants pulled down. He HEARS: Nezhinski's voice and a

muffled struggle. Louis immediately pulls his feet up,

squatting on the toilet seat. Looks into the crack in the

stall door. We STILL HEAR:

We SEE exactly this. Nezhinski faces the MAN. Two

associates of Nezhinski's hold him back, covering his mouth

with silver electrical tape.

Nezhinski's associates pull down his pants, and Louis sees

the man's bare ass. The man is panicking, muffled cries

for help penetrating even the flashback. Nezhinski pulls

out his switchblade, holds it up to his face, then LOWERS

IT. A GLINT of REFLECTION on the KNIFE. HORRIBLE.

INT. CLUB

Back to the present.

Bobby laughs heartily. Just then, Vadim sees him. Pavel

HOLDS UP HIS DRINK in acknowledgement and WAVES HIM OVER.

CONTINUED:

VADIM'S TABLE

Bobby walks   to the table. There's a lot of food around

Vadim--he's   eating off six different plates. Bobby is

really only   focused on Rosario. When Rosario sees him

(she'd been   counting bills) she brightens, virtually

getting out   of her seat:

AD-LIB GREETINGS. Bobby sits between Rosario and

Nezhinski. Rosario kisses him, grabs onto his arm; Vadim

puts his arm around Bobby's shoulder. Turns to his people:

MUMBLED AGREEMENT. The men surrounding Vadim are "yes"

men, and they seem to take their cue from him. To Bobby:

Bobby looks at Vadim's ample waistline.

Everyone LAUGHS, Vadim most of all. He KISSES Bobby on the

head. Bobby looks at Rosario as Vadim continues:

CONTINUED: (2)

AD-LIB amusement from the "yes" men.   Vadim moves closer:

Bobby does not respond, instead nodding to some patrons who

shout out hellos. Vadim shakes Bobby's shoulder with

affection. Intimate:

Bobby takes Rosario by the arm away from the table.

THE BAR

As Bobby moves with Rosario to the bar:

CONTINUED:

These words hit Rosario, and we SEE that she's troubled by

her own behavior because she stares at her shoes,

momentarily speechless. He grabs her:

Bobby purses his lips, frustrated.     Then:

Momentarily confused, she mutters a "'kay," then kisses

him. Bobby moves the hair from Rosario's face.

BOBBY'S ABOUT TO RESPOND IN KIND WHEN...       All of a SUDDEN:

BOOM! PANIC. SCREAMING. LIGHTS.

The DOORS at the club's entrance have burst open. LOUD,

like a gunshot. COPS enter. Plainclothes and uniformed

both. JOSEPH comes in, holds up his badge, which hangs

around his neck. WITH COMMAND:

FOUR UNIFORMED COPS BOLT straight to    the COAT CHECK AREA.

ALL KINDS OF DRUGS and WEAPONS start    falling to the FLOOR.

The patrons are desperate to get rid    of any incriminating

evidence, and BOTH MEN AND WOMEN RUN    TO THE BATHROOMS.

INT. MEN'S ROOM

Several patrons start DUMPING NARCOTICS INTO THE TOILET

BOWLS when MANY COPS ENTER and, with ferocity, hit them

with batons to corral them. The TOILETS are backing up...

INT. WOMEN'S ROOM

Some girls rush in, others are already inside. Two PRETTY

YOUNG WOMEN are in the corner, FREEBASING, when COPS BURST

IN. One of the Pretty Girls, out of surprise, starts to

shake the small pipe flame to extinguish it. The opposite

occurs, and the flame IGNITES THE ETHER. THE TWO GIRLS

BURST INTO FLAMES.

INT. MAIN ROOM

The cops pin EVERYONE up against the wall or on the ground.

EVERYONE IS LINED UP, SEARCHED. I.D.s are checked. Bobby

turns to Rosario:

Troubled, she nonetheless puts a handful of pills in his

palm. Bobby quickly SWALLOWS them. A UNIFORMED COP

approaches Bobby:

Bobby is brutally shoved to the floor and searched; Rosario

is tossed aside. The Uniformed Cop, to someone else:

All patrons in the club, with rare exception, get forcibly

lined up, HANDS CLASPED on the backs of their heads.

PARAMEDICS SPEED to the LADIES' ROOM. JESSIE THE COP takes

out a ketchup squeeze bottle--except it's black--and

forcibly fills Bobby's mouth with charcoal:

CONTINUED:

As Bobby gags, JOSEPH walks through the club with

confidence. The place, though absolutely packed, is

uncharacteristically SILENT. He turns to UNIFORMED COP #2:

This gets Mike's attention. Joseph signals something to

him, he nods, moves to the back. Joseph walks over to

LOUIS, pokes his gut:

Several COPS laugh. Then: Joseph SEES Bobby, and vice

versa. CLOSE SHOT on JOSEPH. He sobers, his brashness

muted. Joe walks toward Vadim and his party. Vadim has

his face to the wall. Joseph kicks his legs further apart.

(Joseph takes his frustration about his brother out on

Vadim.) In Russian, SUBTITLED:

Vadim turns around. Joseph starts to search him.          He pulls

a WAD OF MONEY from Vadim's pocket:

Vadim doesn't answer. Joseph takes out a HUGE SWISS ARMY

KNIFE he's got on his keychain. He cuts the wad in half.

Michael and Jack search the other members of Vadim's party.

They rip out pockets. Michael points to a WOMAN'S FUR:

He motions for the MINK. She hands it over.       HE PATS IT

DOWN CAREFULLY. NOTHING.

ACROSS THE ROOM

The Uniformed Cop puts handcuffs on Bobby and others.

Rosario watches, upset but powerless. Louis is down, next

to Bobby. Unwittingly referring to Bobby's brother:

CONTINUED: (2)

SEVERAL OFFICERS charge through now, PULLING THE LATINO MAN

AND THE YOUNG DARK-SKINNED WHITE MAN (in cuffs) from behind

the coat check. Bobby is pulled up, on his feet.

BACK TO

Joseph interrogating Vadim.   As he looks through I.D.:

Just then, MICHAEL SOLO interjects.   In Joseph's ear:

Joseph nods, acknowledging this news.    He EYES Vadim, then

turns to the TWO MEN:

Michael reads two other men, one of whom is a TALL MAN from

near the table (a lookout, perhaps), their Miranda rights

in a totally perfunctory manner. Almost mumbles them.

PARAMEDICS exit the WOMEN'S ROOM.   Girls are on STRETCHERS.

MARAT BUZHAYEV enters the main room of the club. He is

ESCORTED by TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS, who are very obviously

NOT ARRESTING HIM. They are asking him questions and

writing down his comments. He TURNS TO SEE:

CONTINUED: (3)

A HUMILIATED BOBBY, who eyes him back. Bobby is then

quickly ushered out along with tens of others. Marat

watches, as does Rosario. Louis and Rosario are left

behind, not having been arrested. Neither has VADIM.

Joseph moves close to Vadim. With arrogant brio, re: the

Dark-Skinned White Man, in Russian, subtitled:

JOSEPH EYES VADIM, virtually mocking him. VADIM EYES JOE

BACK with SILENT RAGE on his face. Then the cops push THE

YOUNG DARK-SKINNED MAN out, and as they do, he turns back

to Vadim. The Young Man is TERRIFIED. Bobby, too, is

hauled out like a common criminal. Cuffed...

INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - HOLDING CELLS

The station: 1980's-era, very unlike ones seen on T.V. The

walls are tan brick, peppered with fallout shelter signs.

Archaic, Robert Moses era-like. Lit entirely by large

fluorescents overhead, noticeably free of those desks and

typewriters that are familiar to us from other cop movies.

A big sign above a bulletin board reads, "WE OWN THE

NIGHT." Bobby is led in by a PORTLY COP. A madhouse.

There is BLOOD all over the floor, forming a LAKE.

The Young Dark-Skinned Man is right outside the cell, his

body in spasm, covered with blood coursing from his neck.

Cops huddle around him as he kicks and screams.

After seeing this, Bobby is shoved in his cell, his nose

still leaking the charcoal, blood all over his shoes.

After a beat, he lies down on the cot...

EXT. STATION - DAWN

Bobby exits, walks toward the nearby SUBWAY STATION.   SPOTS

BURT, who's waiting for him. Bobby ignores him:

CONTINUED:

Burt grabs his son's arm.      Moves closer:

Bobby looks around. Nobody's listening. He opens up.

With quiet but real fury, and total sarcasm:

Enraged, Burt SLAPS his SON on the side of the head:

Bobby COCKS HIS FIST. BUT BURT IS READY. A STANDOFF.

Then Bobby decides against it, bolts. On BURT as we GO TO:

INT. MARAT'S APARTMENT - DAY

BOBBY ENTERS. Packed with people. A family get-together

for Thanksgiving. Children abound, a PARTY atmosphere.

BOBBY is in the FOYER, holding a cake he's brought.

CONTINUED:

Several FURS laid out on a felt-covered bench. Into the

LIVING ROOM, he sees Masha and ELI seated on the couch,

holding the hand of their son, who is dressed in a striped

suit. Upon seeing Bobby, ELI NODS TO HIM and Masha enters

the foyer, greeting Bobby with a kiss on both cheeks and

taking the wrapped present from him.

INT. DINING ROOM

Bobby enters. Sitting at the large table is MARAT, playing

with one of his grandchildren. Bobby knocks on the

doorframe to announce his entrance. When Buzhayev spots

him, the child hides behind Marat's leg. Marat lets out a

laugh at this; to the child:

The boy waves perfunctorily.

Marat addresses the boy clutching his leg (AD-LIB a Russian

"go"), kisses him, and the child runs off. Bobby steps

closer to Marat:

Marat darkens considerably. More interior tone, almost as

much for himself as for Bobby:

Marat brings his hand to his head, looks pained.

CONTINUED:

With great effort, Marat stands.

He puts his arm around Bobby's shoulder.

Marat looks at Bobby with great sympathy as they walk

toward the LIVING ROOM.

Bobby mutters a "THANK YOU." Buzhayev touches his cheek.

Marat then turns back into THE DINING ROOM, spreading his

arms affectionately and wide, yelling "OHHH" to the

children as they cheer. ANGLE ON BOBBY as we GO TO:

INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - UPSTAIRS OFFICE

Present: Joseph, Michael, Jack. Joe's seated at the head

of a long table, which is covered with coffee, deli

sandwich remnants, and police reports, etc. They are

working; we greet them in media res.

ALL OF A SUDDEN, IN COMES BOBBY.   Intense beat.    Finally:

Beat.   Bobby takes a step toward him:

CONTINUED:

Bobby takes another confrontational step forward.       Raging:

Bobby LUNGES forward, grabbing his brother. Joseph leaps

up out of the chair. A FIGHT. Awkward punches are thrown.

Messy. Jack and Mike leap in, trying to pull the two

apart, hollering "BREAK IT UP" AD-LIBS. The two are split

up, panting...

Bobby exits, slamming the door.    ANGLE ON JOSEPH,

distressed. Silence, then:

Michael is quieted as Joseph packs his briefcase...

EXT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Joseph drives up to the house, a working-class part of

Queens. He parks the car.

INT. CAR

Joseph looks at his knuckles. They are bruised and

bleeding. Emotional about the fight, he looks toward his

lit house, then opens the car door.

EXT. CAR

Joseph drops his keys as he exits. Reaching down for them

on the asphalt, he HEARS a SOUND and LOOKS up and to his

left. A MAN WITH A HOOD OVER HIS HEAD. Looks almost like

an old-time Klansman, with two holes cut into the hood for

his eyes. He's pointing a GUN RIGHT AT JOSEPH. Joseph's

eyes pop, and he lets out a quick gasp--but he has no real

time to react. The man pulls the trigger.

A THUNDERCLAP slaps the silence in the neighborhood:   THE

GUN HAS FIRED. A FLASH OF LIGHT.

A MIST OF BLOOD plumes around Joseph's head. The bullet

hits Joseph in the face, through the CHEEK. HE snaps back

spasmodically.

AN AUTOMOBILE, a MONTE CARLO, pulls up to the scene of the

crime. Another HOODED MAN in the back seat throws what

looks like a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL into Joseph's CAR. The AUTO

starts to BURN. Joseph lies on the sidewalk, bullet in the

head, his blood everywhere. He seems pretty dead to us.

The Monte Carlo SPEEDS OFF.

INT. MONTE CARLO

The Shooter slumps into his seat, ducking out of sight of

the street. He pulls the hood off, over his head. It is

VADIM NEZHINSKI. In Russian:

EXT. STREET

Joseph, on the ground. The car burns in relative silence.

Dogs barking in the neighborhood. A beat.

INT. POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE BOXING GYM - NIGHT

The PAL gym, filled with off-duty cops boxing, jumping

rope. BURT hits a large bag that swings from the ceiling.

He is dressed in sweatpants and a V-neck undershirt.

CONTINUED:

As he hammers away, he is involved in some CHEERFUL BANTER

with fellow cops:

Then he SEES, in a LARGE MIRROR: TWO UNIFORMED COPS and the

POLICE CHAPLAIN EDWIN O'CONNOR, standing near the doorway.

He stops his exercise. They approach him.

After a long beat, Burt's expression changes, and he senses

something bad. A long look at the men. Then:

The cops turn to each other. Burt tries to prep himself,

but it's impossible; we SEE the cracks in his sangfroid:

Burt does his best to stay stoic.

Hesitantly, they leave. He crouches near his gymbag.

Closes his eyes. The color drains from his face. Then,

seeing other cops eyeing him:

ALL OF A SUDDEN, as if he's been SHOT, he COLLAPSES.

INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

SMOKE AND DRINK everywhere. MADONNA'S "DRESS YOU UP" plays

in the background. CROWDED. Bobby, Rosario, and Louis are

at the center of a poker game. Lou sits next to Bobby,

partnering with him in the game and whispering into his ear

from time to time. Rosario sits next to Bobby and watches

the game intently.

The poker pot seems exceptionally large. A STOCKY LATINO

MAN is the main one competing with Bobby. Bobby's a mess,

maybe worse than we've yet seen him. But he is HAPPILY

DRUNK, his eyes BLOODSHOT. He and Louis look at their

cards. Rosario turns, looks at Bobby for a BEAT. She sees

a small bruise he's got on his forehead, kisses it.

He starts rubbing her between the legs, under the table.

She kisses his bruise again. Louis pokes her. Smiling and

pointing to his crotch:

Rosario lets out a loud laugh.   Louis whispers pearls of

wisdom to Bobby:

Bobby ignores him.   Instead, aloud, to the Latino man:

Bobby turns to him, winks. The PHONE IS RINGING. A LOT.

ROSARIO gets up, walks over to the phone near the sofa and

picks up with a soft "hello". Meanwhile, Bobby puts a

whole lot of cash in the middle. The Latino Man looks at

him like he's crazy. Finally:

CONTINUED:

Bobby takes a SHOT OF LIQUOR.    Turns over his cards.    He

has a pair of QUEENS:

A pair of tens. Bobby stands, CLAPS ONCE.       Lou, thrilled,

jumps up and HUGS Bobby.

Rosario has a slightly serious look on her face as she

calls out to Bobby:

She shakes her head as if to say, "I don't know." Slightly

peeved that he needs to attend to the call, he leaves the

table. As he does so, Louis, to some girl, proudly:

Then Louis grabs the pot for himself as Bobby picks up the

phone, several feet away from the ruckus. He covers his

free ear with his hand to hear better:

CONTINUED: (2)

Bobby, of course, is stunned. The poker table in the

background is a riot, a contrast to the sober message

Bobby's getting. He turns his back to the crowd; sotto:

HANG UP. Bobby waits a beat, frozen, then does the same.

Rosario knows something is wrong, approaches him.

Rosario sees how remote he is, what a blow it is.     She

pulls him to her:

Bobby eyes her, walks to the table.      A CLOSE SHOT on him.

Bobby grabs his coat. Rosario responds in kind, moves to

Bobby. He spins to her. In hushed tones:

CONTINUED: (3)

Bobby moves to Louis:

Hurt, Rosario spins around and enters Bobby's room, closing

the door behind her.

Pats Louis' arm as if to reassure him. Then the Latino Man

tries to grab some of the pot. OTHER PLAYERS REVOLT:

A FIGHT BREAKS OUT. Louis moves over to the WOMEN, holding

them back (odd--they weren't going anywhere to begin with):

PUSHING, SHOVING. PUNCHING. Bobby exits his place,

leaving behind Rosario and Louis and chaos...

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Bobby walks briskly to the entrance. MEDIA are all around,

but they aren't paying attention to him. They are

elsewhere, with members of the police, each other, etc....

INT. E.R. WAITING ROOM

He enters. The room is jammed with officers and friends,

including many faces from the opening party.

CONTINUED:

Most of the cops don't seem to recognize Bobby at all.    All

the NEWS MEDIA are outside, banned from the hospital's

interior.

BURT emerges from the hallway. He sees Bobby, at first

comforted by the sight of his son. But quickly he darkens,

and starts to walk right past him. Sotto:

Burt keeps walking.    Bobby follows:

Bobby touches his father's arm, and Burt spins around:

Bobby is speechless for a moment. Burt pulls his arm away

and walks on. A MUSTACHIOED COP approaches Burt:

ENTER: someone we recognize as the MAYOR storms in with his

ENTOURAGE. The COMMISSIONER (WILLIAM RUDDY--we'll see him

later) and Deputy Commissioner Spiro Giavannis are with him

too. They approach Burt. Bobby moves aside.

CONTINUED: (2)

Meanwhile: MICHAEL takes Bobby's arm, walks him into:

INT. SMALL PHONE ROOM

A small room with payphones. There's a window through

which we can SEE the WAITING ROOM.

CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY.

Bobby starts to exit.   Michael stops him:

A beat, then:

Bobby realizes that NO ONE WANTS HIM HERE. He looks

through the glass to SEE Burt, still speaking to the Mayor.

Bobby storms out of the room to:

INT. HALLWAY

He turns toward Intensive Care. SEES a CROWD DOWN THE

HALL. Two GUARDS block the doors to the ward. Determined,

Bobby decides to walk over.

Bobby hurriedly takes out his wallet. As he does, we HEAR

a SOFT CHIME. A WOMAN'S VOICE SOUNDS on the P.A.:

Bobby stares at the men for a beat, then makes his move.

Charges past the Guard.

The Guards stop him, and a messy struggle ensues.

All of a sudden, Joseph's wife SANDRA emerges from the

ward. She looks devastated. The struggle stops. All fall

silent, out of respect. Bobby steps back. Sandra turns to

look at Bobby. To the Guards:

Bobby walks toward the entrance.   Stops.    Sandra seems to

read his mind, speaks:

CONTINUED:

Bobby nods subtly, mouths a "THANK YOU." The Guards step

aside. He walks to the doors. Pauses. ENTERS:

INT. WARD

Joseph's bed is in the back of the large space. His face

is blocked by hospital curtains. Bobby steps forward.

Slowly, he walks to his brother's bed. He peels away the

CURTAIN. Looks at JOSEPH'S FACE. Joseph's visage is

completely RAVAGED on the left side, covered with bandages

that are soaked with blood. A TERRIBLE IMAGE. The emotion

surges within him; he's HEARTBROKEN.

It is a surprisingly painful moment. We can TELL he didn't

expect this level of destruction. His mouth drops open

slightly. Joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at

Bobby. Bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches Joe's arm

gently. His fingers move down to his brother's hand.

Joseph is unresponsive but conscious. All of a sudden:

Joseph's hand closes around Bobby's fingers. The

connection is huge. Bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs

them, almost ashamed of the emotion. It is a shocking

OUTPOURING of FEELING from him.

He leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead:

He waits a beat. The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder. He

backs away, his eyes reddened. The camera MOVES INTO a

CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as we GO TO:

INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY

A loud, active hallway of a housing project. Graffiti on

the walls, trash on the floor, but FULL OF LIFE.

Bobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught.

He SEES, in one far corner of the hall, two young Latino

teens smoking CRACK.

He goes to one of the apartment doors, KNOCKS.    Opening the

door is a LATE MIDDLE-AGED LATINO WOMAN.

CONTINUED:

Behind her, is ROSARIO. (The woman who answers the door is

clearly Rosario's mother.)

INT. ROSARIO'S APARTMENT - FOYER

Rosario's mother discreetly backs away from the door. He

and Rosario stare at each other for a moment. Bobby gropes

for words. His emotions bubble up inside of him; then,

barely audible, his voice cracking:

He sinks down, holding her tight, his head at her stomach.

She gently strokes his hair, kissing the top of his head.

She shakes her head to reassure him, whispering

"no...no...". In this moment, he needs her. In this

moment, he is like a twelve year-old boy...

INT. CAFE CAPPUCCINO - BRIGHTON AVENUE - NIGHT

Across from the El Caribe. It's like a scene out of Balm

in Gilead here--raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and

drinking coffee after their nights on the town. Bobby and

Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables. Bobby kisses

Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse. She

looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine.

Louis, meanwhile, is unaware of Bobby's state of mind, and

is busy putting on a show--as usual:

He gets up and starts kicking and chopping in the air in

the clumsiest manner possible. Accidentally kicks the

waitress, who's bringing the check.

Bobby picks up the check, hands Louis some cash.

CONTINUED:

Louis smiles, walks off.    Scoops up the tip from a nearby

table.

Bobby kisses her atop her head. JUST THEN: VADIM AND HIS

GANG enter the establishment. They create a ruckus.

Spotting Bobby and Rosario, Vadim ambles toward them:

Bobby gives a simple nod as well. Inside, Bobby is

extremely uneasy, though outwardly he is quietly confident:

Without making eye contact, Bobby shrugs; then:

CONTINUED: (2)

Rosario leaves the table.    Two GIRLS walk by:

Bobby nods to them.    Vadim watches them walk away.   Then:

The brazenness of the comment shocks Bobby. He looks up,

begins to focus. Incredulous. Softly, as the camera ZOOMS

INTO a CLOSE ANGLE on BOBBY:

Another member of the gang speaks up: Pavel:

CONTINUED: (3)

Pavel LAUGHS, and Bobby looks at him with real resentment.

Vadim pushes Pavel aside, motions for him to sit down

elsewhere. Vadim pulls up a chair. Sits down. Intimate:

Vadim turns over his hand.   A SPIDER WEB TATTOO graces the

palm of his right hand:

Vadim leans back in his chair. Bobby's eyes widen. Vadim

makes a "POP" sound. Bobby tries to hide his shock. Vadim

grabs Bobby's arm, squeezes it.

And the men move to another table. Bobby looks at Rosario

and Louis, who're standing by the register. They turn back

to Bobby and SMILE, totally unaware of the conversation

that's just taken place. CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY as we GO TO:

EXT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO

It's a huge municipal structure.   Bobby bolts inside.

INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA TWO - ENTRANCE

The place is hopping, with police everywhere. Almost like

a fraternity house. BOBBY CHARGES IN, looks around.

Pushes his way through the crowd toward the main desk.

CONTINUED:

SERGEANT PROVENZANO, forties, rings a SILVER BELL, which is

engraved with the words, "Homicide Bell." The room quiets

down. Provenzano holds up his hands. Grinning:

APPLAUSE. Provenzano bows.        BOBBY shoves his way through

the crowd. Urgently:

EXT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - HALLWAY

Bobby looks down the hall.       He SEES his father, talking to

a CROWD of UNIFORMED COPS.       Burt sees him, keeps talking.

Bobby touches his arm.

Bobby pulls his father aside, looks around to be sure the

two of them are out of earshot of others. Forcefully:

Burt is surprised.       His attention sharpens:

Burt realizes the severity.       Then we HEAR:

CONTINUED:

INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - MUSTER ROOM

A large room, lit by fluorescents. Mostly empty of

furniture in the center, with vending machines against the

wall and a sole IBM PC in a corner. A huge GUN RACK is on

the wall, conspicuous, a hint perhaps of the violence to

come. It is Bobby and Burt, Jack and Michael. Bobby's

been telling his story. He and Burt are seated--Jack looks

out the small window in the door, then turns the LOCK for

privacy; and a nervous Michael is pacing:

Bobby looks at his father, then nods.      Mouths an almost

INAUDIBLE:

Michael purses his lips, then spins around to Burt.

ANGLE ON BURT.    He betrays no hint of concern:

Uncustomarily, Jack speaks:

CONTINUED:

Burt lets his temper flare; briefly, we SEE a more mature

version of Bobby:

Bobby sees an opening:

Michael turns to the others.    Brightening:

CONTINUED: (2)

A beat.   Bobby is dead serious:

CONTINUED: (3)

A beat.   Bobby is still there, fixated.

Finally, Bobby exits.   We GO TO:

INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bobby enters his room, which is dark. Rosario is here,

asleep. Her back to Bobby. Upon hearing him enter, she

turns and looks at him (and US) in SLOW MOTION...

Bobby sits on the edge of the bed, touches her back. She

senses something wrong and speaks, voice ravaged by sleep:

Bobby nods.

Something seems to dawn on Bobby:

She looks at Bobby, who appears deep in thought:

Bobby leans over, kisses her:

He lies down next to her, still fully clothed.    Stares up

at the ceiling. She whispers to him:

CONTINUED:

EXT. HOSPITAL - RAINY DAY

Burt and Jack and Michael. Burt is talking to the others

in front of the hospital, but we are in WIDE SHOT, and we

can't HEAR them. Burt shakes their hands, then walks

inside. Mike and Jack walk in the opposite direction...

EXT. PARKING LOT

BOBBY stands inside an abandoned parking kiosk. (He's been

watching from afar.) Jack and Mike approach their parked

car. He tries to obscure himself partially inside the

kiosk. They see him.

Bobby hesitates, then reveals himself completely:

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON MICHAEL, JACK.

Jack, Michael turn to each other.    Then: ANGLE ON BOBBY.

PRELAP a PHONE RINGING:

INT. "HELLO" PHONE OFFICE

A small office equipped with telephones, headsets, and fold

out chairs. Lockers line the walls. Bobby's on the phone,

waiting for someone to answer. REVEAL: Jack and Michael are

here too, with HEADPHONES ON, LISTENING IN. Finally:

Bobby looks to the cops.    They start mouthing something,

but he ignores them:

CONTINUED:

Mike and Jack's hairs stand on end upon hearing this.

Bobby hangs up.

Jack reaches into a nearby LOCKER for something, then

approaches Bobby and hands him a small BLACK BEEPER.

Bobby takes the BEEPER.     Michael touches his shoulder:

CONTINUED: (2)

ANGLE ON BOBBY as he sobers.   Nods.   Then:

Michael grabs Bobby's shoulder, a gesture of affection.

INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LATER

Bobby enters the bedroom. Presses his answering machine

button, and a message begins to play. It is Rosario.

As her voice plays on the machine: he moves to the dresser,

where he opens the top drawer. INSIDE: THOUSANDS OF

DOLLARS--his SAVINGS. He begins to take the money out of

the drawer and count it when: we HEAR a SOFT BUZZ. He

quickly looks over, CHECKS THE BEEPER. He stares at the

paged number...

EXT. FLUSHING MEADOW PARK - FOGGY DUSK

A MAN #1 stands by a bench, almost floating in the fog. He

is stocky, dressed in a down vest. Bobby enters the frame,

trepidatious; he and the man eye each other for a moment,

then Bobby holds out the beeper. The man takes it.

MAN #1 takes out A KEL DEVICE LISTENING UNIT and its

accessories. Among them, a CIGARETTE LIGHTER. He UNSCREWS

THE LIGHTER. Complex electronic innards.

CONTINUED:

Man #1 hands Bobby the LIGHTER.    He FIRES it.    It works.

The Man unceremoniously turns to leave.     Then, suddenly:

Bobby acknowledges that with a single nod of his head. The

man departs. Bobby grasps the lighter tight, looks at the

man as he virtually disappears back into the fog...

INT. CHURCH - EARLY EVENING

It is an older Catholic church, a beautiful interior. A

line of young Latino women hold candles, singing as they

walk toward the altars. A HEALING MASS. Rosario is here.

CONTINUED:

She lights a candle at the altar, then walking back to the

pew, she SEES BOBBY and approaches. Bobby looks around,

seeming harried and paranoid...

Bobby looks at her, his eyes filled with emotion.

He doesn't respond at all.

He appears almost in tears...    Finally, sotto:

Rosario is shocked.     Almost inaudible:

As she steps back, he moves forward:

Rosario tries to recover.    Can barely speak.     Sotto:

CONTINUED: (2)

Rosario breaks down, tears flowing.    Her hand to her mouth:

Bobby spins around to see if anyone's listening.      He pulls

her into a dark corner of the church:

Bobby pulls her to him, holds her tight.    In her ear:

Rosario is emotional.    Then:

Still fervid, she is silent.     CLUB MUSIC up...

INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM

Bobby enters the place, determined. He has A BAG tucked

under his arm. Many CLUBGOERS say hearty HELLOS to him.

People are dancing, having a glorious time. LOUIS IS HERE,

THRILLED to see Bobby. He HUGS him, effusive, heartfelt:

CONTINUED:

Bobby gently pats his old friend's shoulder.       Interrupting

this, Freddie steps in:

He then walks by the COAT CHECK. He and ROSARIO see each

other. He turns, SEES Pavel, in back. Pavel waves to

Bobby, and Bobby starts walking to him.

INT. BACK OF THE CLUB

Bobby approaches a table, reserved for Pavel and the rest

of the gang. Bobby joins them, with his bag.

Pavel thinks a moment, eyes his cohorts.       Back to Bobby:

Bobby turns to leave.    Pavel calls after him:

CONTINUED:

Pavel quickly draws his hand across his Adam's apple.

Bobby exits, passing by ROSARIO as he does. She gives him

a fearful look...

EXT. BOARDWALK - NIGHT

The famous Brighton Beach boardwalk. Bobby stands in the

cold, waiting, holding his bag of money. Alone. Takes out

the LIGHTER, the LISTENING DEVICE. He fires it--it works.

Looks at his watch. In rummaging through his pockets for a

smoke, he finds a little slip of paper with a phone number

on it. He APPROACHES a nearby PHONE BOOTH. Bobby holds

the paper in his hand, dials the number. A voice answers:

INT. ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL - INTERCUT

JOSEPH on the phone, in bed.      Nearby, Sandra is folding his

blanket around him.

EXT. BOARDWALK - INTERCUT

Bobby says nothing.

Bobby SEES Pavel's CAR DRIVE UP.      Bobby hangs up the phone.

Takes a deep breath. We HEAR:

EXT. BOARDWALK STREET

Bobby approaches the car. Pavel is in the back seat,

calling to him with the window open.

Bobby approaches the automobile. Pavel is in the back

seat, calling to him with the window open. Another

American sedan behind them. Bobby enters Pavel's.

INT. LIVERY CAR

Bobby takes the front passenger seat.      Pavel is behind him.

Someone we DON'T KNOW is driving.

CONTINUED:

Bobby is somewhat edgy, with Pavel behind him. The car

pulls away from the curb. Then: Pavel throws a small towel

over Bobby's head. POINTS A REVOLVER AT BOBBY'S TEMPLE.

Bobby is startled by the action, blinded. Trying to stay

calm...

Bobby obliges. The driver, looking anxiously in his rear

view mirror, makes a SHARP LEFT, and the car VEERS. Pavel

then PATS BOBBY DOWN, searching for a wire, anything

incriminating. To the driver:

The CAR makes A SHARP LEFT.      In Russian, subtitled:

EXT. STREET

The Livery Car makes another brutal SHARP LEFT, tires

screeching just slightly.

INT. LIVERY CAR

Pavel again:

The camera MOVES INTO a SHOT OF THE HOODED BOBBY...

EXT. STREET

The Livery Car pulls up to the curb. We are on: a strange

residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere.

Dark, deserted. Many silhouetted figures stand in doorways

up and down the block. They are all armed, with shotguns

and machine guns slung over their shoulders. A GARBAGE CAN

IS ON FIRE a few yards away. The men get out of the car.

They pull Bobby out:

INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY

They walk up the stairs, PULLING Bobby up over the steps.

He stumbles. They pick him up, lead him to a door.

INT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM

Someone pulls the hood off him. Bobby looks around. The

room is ABSOLUTELY BARE. The driver puts Bobby's bag of

money down on the floor. A TEENAGED BOY wearing a SURGICAL

MASK comes and puts one on Bobby's face as well. Bobby

surveys the place. Where the hell is he? With that mask

on his face, we HEAR his BREATHING, loud and present,

through the sequence.

It could be night or day, we wouldn't know. The windows

are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light. There is

VISQUINE hanging from seemingly everywhere. Parts of rooms

are cordoned off with the material. SILHOUETTED FIGURES

ROAM through the space like apparitions. A SLAVIC-LOOKING

MAN takes Bobby's bag of money, leaves the room.

IN THE HALLWAY

Stands Pavel, masked as well, armed now with a Kalashnikov

rifle. Without a word, he motions with a move of his head

to Bobby. "FOLLOW ME," he seems to be saying.

INT. BEDROOM

Bobby enters the room, right behind Pavel. He SEES: a

dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror. Tables set

up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them.

There is a television on in the corner, a Russian ethnic

musical program silently unfolding.

There are other people in the room: a BROWN-HAIRED MAN; and

two dark-haired SLAVIC-LOOKING WOMEN. It's an assembly

line for the preparation of narcotics.

The SLAVIC MAN takes out the STACKS OF BILLS. Starts

counting them methodically. Pavel motions to the Brown-

Haired Man, puts up two fingers.

On cue, the Brown-Haired Man rubs his hands together, then

takes two large JARS from his desk. Beneath the desk,

Bobby spots what looks like an ENORMOUS NUMBER of packages

of NARCOTICS, stacked against the wall.

This is clearly THEIR STASH HOUSE. The Brown-Haired Man

pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk

blotter. He sits down, takes off his jacket, REVEALING:

TATTOOS, UP AND DOWN BOTH OF HIS ARMS.

CONTINUED:

The designs combine several images--skulls, snakes, and the

SPIDER WEB element that marked Vadim's own tattoo.

He takes a RUSTY LETTER OPENER--it had been sitting atop

the desk--and pierces a GREEN PACKAGE. White powder seeps

from the package.

Bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and

pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form. He uses

two PLAYING CARDS to move the drug. Bobby eyes that RUSTY

LETTER OPENER...

The Brown-Haired Man dips a measuring spoon in another

powder to add to the mix. He is cutting the drug. He

continues to manipulate the substance, and his hands move

with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef

on a cooking show.

CLOSE SHOT on some lines of COCAINE. Pavel takes a toot.

He OFFERS it to Bobby as a taste. Bobby accepts. He pulls

down his mask momentarily, RUBBING a RATHER LARGE QUANTITY

OF THE DRUG ON HIS GUMS, HIS LIP. We HEAR:

Bobby looks over to see: EMERGING FROM THE BLACK, FROM DOWN

A DARKENED HALLWAY: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Everyone is wearing a

surgical mask--except, of course, for him. Bobby eyes him

with eyes that seem to become more BLOODSHOT by the second.

The Slavic Youth finishes counting Bobby's cash:

Vadim points to the MONEY:

CONTINUED: (2)

Vadim walks over to a stack of green packages:

Vadim steps away from the narcotics and towards Bobby:

Vadim looks at that money again, takes a step forward.

Bobby's forehead has beads of sweat. Vadim walks up close.

Looks Bobby in the eye for a BEAT.

Vadim puts his hand on Bobby's chest, checking his

heartbeat.

Bobby shakes his head. He is wired, out of it, but he

pulls himself together. His jaw clenches. With fire, an

edge of defiance:

CONTINUED: (3)

Vadim violently pulls out Bobby's pockets. Out falls: a

WALLET, SOME CHANGE, KEYS, A CIGARETTE LIGHTER, MATCHES.

He sifts through the items, lighting the lighter. It

fires. Bobby gets slightly edgy. Notices that the others

congregate around the objects from his pocket--all except

for Pavel, who holds an AK-47 trained on Bobby.

Bobby inches ever closer to the rusted LETTER OPENER that

the Brown-Haired Man had used to open a package of cocaine.

Vadim puts down the lighter. And it occurs to him:

Bobby realizes instantly that Vadim is right. Bobby

shrugs, feigning innocence. He braces himself and decides

to give the signal:

Bobby looks around.   There's NO CAVALRY TO THE RESCUE.    He

tries again:

Still NOTHING. PAVEL'S attention turns to VADIM.   He moves

toward NEZHINSKI, who:

Starts FRANTICALLY POUNDING THE LIGHTER against the DESK.

Trying break it open. Bobby scans the joint... The MEN

are trained on that lighter, and this is his chance. He

slips the LETTER OPENER into his hand.

SEEMS LIKE WE CAN LITERALLY HEAR THE BLOOD RUSHING THROUGH

BOBBY'S HEAD NOW. Setting himself, Bobby looks around the

room--where's that backup???--and: the camera SPEEDS PAST

Pavel's and Vadim's faces, to the other side of the room.

It MOVES toward the WINDOW:

VADIM HITS THE LIGHTER AGAIN. This time, it BREAKS OPEN.

REVEALING A BEVY OF WIRES. It is CLEARLY NOT JUST A

LIGHTER. The camera TILTS UP. VADIM IS ENRAGED:

CONTINUED: (4)

IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S A GONER. PAVEL RAISES HIS GUN and

CHARGES TOWARD BOBBY--ABOUT TO FIRE, when--

THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN. COPS EVERYWHERE. Mike and Jack lead

the way, but there are what seems like tens of EMERGENCY

SERVICES UNIT OFFICERS with them:

NO ONE FREEZES. CHAOS. GUNFIRE. PAVEL SWINGS BACK TO

BOBBY, a TERRIFYING LOOK ON HIS FACE. But Bobby is ready,

and SHOVES THE LETTER OPENER INTO PAVEL'S NECK. BLOOD

CASCADES DOWN THE MAN'S CHEST. Pavel collapses on Bobby,

still very much alive. His eyes are popping, and he throws

his hands around Bobby's THROAT. VADIM CHARGES INTO:

INT. BACK ROOM

Where he pulls up a SECTION OF LINOLEUM, REVEALING a TRAP

DOOR that leads down to the apartment BELOW...

INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

HORRIFYINGLY--DRUG PEDDLERS, ARMED with all kinds of GUNS,

POUR OUT from rooms everywhere--on the FIRST LEVEL of the

building as well as the THIRD.

AND EVERYONE COMES OUT FIRING.

THE COPS ARE FORCED TO ENGAGE IN A FURIOUS GUN BATTLE, THE

BULLETS COMING FROM EVERYWHERE. ABOVE AND BELOW.

SEVERAL PUSHERS ARE HIT. THE POLICE have their gear and

are reasonably protected, though TWO OF THEM ARE WOUNDED.

Bullets SPLINTER the floor beneath their feet and the wall

right above their heads. They have their backs to the wall

as their only cover... PERCUSSION GRENADES THUNDER through

the STRUCTURE...

INT. BEDROOM

A FUSILLADE OF BULLETS.   CONFUSION.

BOBBY IS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE. STILL STRUGGLING WITH

PAVEL, this has become the madness of war. Pavel bleeds

profusely all over Bobby's chest, and this is a fight to

the death.

CONTINUED:

Bobby wrenches the LETTER OPENER out of Pavel's collarbone

and desperately--and repeatedly--stabs Pavel in the base of

the neck. Pavel's screams mix with gunfire to make a

hell...

AT THAT MOMENT: A SHOTGUN BLAST blows the top of Pavel's

head clean off, spattering Bobby's face with brain

particulate. Bobby is forced to get out from under... We

HEAR POLICE SIRENS. RADIOS ON--

INT. TENEMENT - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - BACK ROOM

VADIM slides down to the BACK ROOM in the APARTMENT BELOW.

Panicked, he cocks his gun, searches for an escape route.

INT. BEDROOM

Bobby gets up, into a crouch, amidst the gunfire.    Dodging

the bullets.

An ESU Police Officer does not recognize Bobby as an ally,

and he trains his assault rifle on Bobby. Bobby screams,

his hands raised:

This is INAUDIBLE, with all the ammo being dispensed, and

Bobby knows it; so he dodges the Officer; the Officer

begins to unload his weapon, getting CLOSER to BOBBY.

AND CLOSER.

AND CLOSER.     Bobby is about to be killed when:

HE SEES HIS CHANCE. HE CHARGES BACKWARD. WITH FEROCIOUS

DETERMINATION, HE THROWS HIMSELF OUT A NEARBY WINDOW.

THE PANE SHATTERS. BOBBY TUMBLES THROUGH, HIS FACE AND

BODY RIDDLED WITH SHARDS OF GLASS.

EXT. TENEMENT

Bobby FALLS roughly twenty feet through the air. His body

tumbles upside-down, toward a wrought-iron FENCE that

surrounds the base of the apartment building's side.

Bobby HITS the FENCE. His LEG GETS CAUGHT on one of the

small spikes. He SCREAMS as we GO BACK TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING

Cop cars pull up by the dozen, from EVERYWHERE. Out of one

comes BURT GRUSINSKY, carrying a shotgun. He charges right

into the structure...

INT. DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM

Nezhinski opens the window, about to go out onto the fire

escape. A WARRANT UNIT OFFICER is below. Looks up:

BEHIND HIM:

VADIM SPINS AROUND.   FREEZES.   His hands are in the air.

Officers pour in, among them BURT. Cops forcefully push

Vadim to the ground. Start to cuff him. Burt pulls Jack

ASIDE:

Jack is speechless--he doesn't know. (We SEE that Burt's

question--revealing Bobby's identity--REGISTERS on VADIM'S

FACE.) Vadim mutters, aloud but sotto, in Russian:

Burt frantically PUSHES THROUGH THE CROWD OF COPS...

EXT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - ALLEYWAY

Bobby is upside-down, hanging from the fence, but he is

alert. Two members of the EMERGENCY SERVICES UNIT approach

him.

On sheer instinct alone, he starts to PULL his LEG off the

small SPIKE, his teeth clenched. An ARMY of ESU TROOPS and

PARAMEDICS come to BOBBY'S AID...

CONTINUED:

BOBBY is being lowered from the fence. An AMBULANCE ZOOMS

UP the STREET, to the alley. Burt rushes to his son.

Jack and Mike come right behind him. Bobby looks at his

father, his face nicked by many small cuts from the glass.

Sheepish, he cannot say a word and averts his father's

gaze.

Burt eases when he hears this. They move Bobby toward the

ambulance. Burt turns to Michael. Sotto:

INT. AMBULANCE

Bobby sits up on the stretcher as a MEDIC treats his leg.

Burt approaches, watches for a moment. The Medic leaves

the post for a moment, and the two are ALONE. Burt stares

at his son, who finally speaks:

CONTINUED:

Burt is getting emotional, aware of how close his son came

to death. Trying not to show it--and failing.

With that, the Medic returns, and with a heavy heart, Burt

closes the ambulance door. Bobby is alone with the Medic

for a moment in the back of the vehicle; he watches through

the window as his father walks to his car. Bobby sinks to

the cot, lies down. AS VADIM NEZHINSKI is LED AWAY in

HANDCUFFS...

FADE IN:

A LOCAL NEWS CHANNEL: the STORY is about the BUST: MAJOR

NARCOTICS SEIZURE, 40 KILOS OF COCAINE. An OFFICER is

KILLED; Two PERPETRATORS (among them: PAVEL and the SLAVIC

MAN) KILLED. Four others wounded.

MORE THAN A DOZEN ARRESTS. We SEE the PERPS, lined up

against the walls. VADIM NEZHINSKI'S MUG SHOT. We're told

he's AWAITING TRIAL. In a RELATED STORY--

CHANNEL TWO NEWS ANCHORWOMAN MICHELLE MARSH:

A news report on Joseph Grusinsky's release from the

hospital. He is a hero, she says, and she tells us it's

been five months since his shooting. He is GOING HOME...

EXT. JOSEPH'S BLOCK - SUNNY DAY

Several POLICE CARS line the block. There are ARMED

OFFICERS perched on rooftops. As PROTECTION. Many of the

houses have "WELCOME HOME" banners hanging from them. The

media are here. NEIGHBORS are on their porches.

INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM

Packed with people and playing CHILDREN. Lively. Food

everywhere. TWO ARMED GUARDS stand against the wall. A

CROWD surrounds someone. Then, as the CAMERA DOLLIES

CLOSER, people move away to reveal: BOBBY, seated in a

chair against the wall. His leg is bandaged. AD-LIB

friendly HELLOS from partygoers, who surround him and treat

him respectfully. PAN OVER TO REVEAL: ROSARIO, seated next

to him. She sits quietly; his arm is around her shoulder.

People are STARING AT HER.

CONTINUED:

SPIRO GIAVANNIS (we saw him at our film's beginning--he's

the Deputy Commissioner and he's in uniform) shakes Bobby's

hand enthusiastically. He uses his hands to cup Bobby's:

Bobby points to the ARMED GUARDS next to him.

LAUGHTER from others.    Bobby's expression changes, sobers.

AD-LIBBED AGREEMENT from others.    A FAT LADY peeks her head

in, calls out:

A RUSH toward the door.    Rosario leans in to Bobby:

CONTINUED: (2)

He gives Bobby his BUSINESS CARD. Bobby takes it, mutters

a "thank you." Spiro pats him on the shoulder, leaves.

Bobby turns to Rosario, knowing she's somewhat out of place

here. Children run by, having fun. Bobby eyes them, then

he leans closer. Sotto, tender:

She nods.    Whispered:

He leans over, kisses her.

INT. FOYER

A RANDOM WOMAN, who'd been looking out the window, turns

back toward the house. With a huge smile on her face:

INT. DINING ROOM

Bobby brightens, begins to stand with only a little

difficulty as he anticipates Joseph's entrance. As this

happens, Rosario slips out from under his grasp:

And she walks off.    Bobby watches as she enters:

INT. BATHROOM

Rosario closes the door on Bobby, turns on the running

water. Then begins to rummage through her purse. Finds a

small vial of cocaine inside. Takes it out, opens it, but

DROPS IT IN THE SINK. The drug spills into the water,

washing it down the drain. Frantically, she tries to

finger whatever residue is left on the porcelain...

INT. FOYER

ENTERING THE HOUSE: JOSEPH and Sandra, his wife. Joe holds

two bags--one filled with cards and memorabilia, the other

with clothes. What seems like a ZILLION PEOPLE are here

when he walks in. Everyone CHEERS. BURT moves right

behind him, all smiles. Joseph is thrilled--but somehow

not the same. His face doesn't look bad, but one eye is a

different color from the other, and he's had reconstructive

surgery on his jaw. There is, of course, a scar, and he's

lost a lot of weight.

Behind him, Burt waves everyone closer. Jack and Mike and

other faces we can recognize from around the precinct stand

back, all smiles. AD-LIB HELLOS. An elderly NEIGHBOR

comes forward, giddy:

LAUGHTER. Then Joseph FREEZES. He NOTICES: BOBBY, next to

the ARMED MEN who haven't left his side.

The two brothers make eye contact. The crowd quiets a bit.

Bobby smiles at the sight of his brother. Joseph gets

emotional, too:

Without a word, Bobby nods, moves to his brother. As Burt

looks on, pleased, Bobby takes his hand and grips the back

of Joseph's neck. Joseph pulls his brother to him by his

neck. A real embrace. Joseph pats Bobby's back.

The two separate, both smiling gently. Breaking the moment:

CONTINUED:

Soft laughter. Small talk begins. The group dissipates,

moves to eat, etc. Burt moves to Joseph:

Burt nods, reluctantly. All our men walk to the den--

except for Bobby, who hears: ROSARIO, down the hall. She

approaches him.

A beat. Bobby senses she's not completely right. Looks

into her eyes, then, more an accusation than a question:

A muttered "no" from Rosario, hardly a committed denial.

Before he can say anything, from the DEN, Burt peeks his

head out:

Burt motions for Bobby to enter the den.       Back to Rosario:

Bobby then moves to the den.

INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DEN

Burt and Joseph and Jack and Mike.    Bobby enters the room.

As he does, we HEAR:

Bobby closes the door behind him softly.       Joseph sees

Bobby, is surprised he's here...

Jack nods.

All of a sudden, a VOICE from behind:

CONTINUED:

Everyone turns around, slightly surprised Bobby's opened

his mouth here:

An ugly beat.    Then:

Bobby exits, and Burt watches him depart.

INT. LIVING ROOM

The unaware crowd is having a great time. Children run

around the rooms. Bobby SEES GUARD #2, approaches. Burt

comes up next to him, takes him into a corner:

Bobby contemplates this; we SEE that he tacitly accepts his

father's words. Then:

CONTINUED:

Bobby is about to leave.     Burt stops him:

Bobby motions to his bodyguard. Burt senses he's said the

wrong thing. Gently tries to stop him:

With that, Bobby leaves with his bodyguard. Burt stands

there for a moment, frustrated. TEDDY, his grandson, runs

past him. Naked. Sandra follows the boy. Burt turns to

see the naked youngster, then to Sandra:

EXT. METS MOTEL - EARLY EVENING

It's a cheesy hotel on Queens Boulevard. TWO UNMARKED CARS

pull up. Armed Guards exit the autos first, casing the

area. They're followed by Bobby.

INT. MOTEL - HALLWAY

Bobby approaches his room. A Guard, we'll call him VITT,

is outside the room holding his shotgun. Nods a "hello".

Bobby moves past him, opens the door. The ROOM is EMPTY.

A beat.   Then Bobby spins around, furious:

INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A number of PEOPLE are HERE. It's PACKED. We are on the

DANCE FLOOR. MUSIC: GRANDMASTER FLASH'S "WHITE LINES".

ROSARIO DIAZ is in the center of the crowded floor, dancing

up a storm. She is having a GREAT TIME, surrounded by many

would-be male suitors and Louis. She is laughing and

stoned, and her gyrations are wonderfully erotic and free.

As she moves, she pushes the men away with a smile. All,

of course, except for Louis. Louis dances a CAN CAN with

two amused girls. Though fat, he's surprisingly graceful.

ALL OF A SUDDEN: COMING THROUGH THE CROWD: BOBBY. When

Louis sees his friend, he lights up. Bobby's furious

inside, but strangely calm outside:

Bobby GLARES at Rosario. He takes her arm, starts to walk

her out. She tries to pull Bobby toward the dancing:

CONTINUED:

Bobby grabs Rosario by the elbow.     She yanks it away:

Rosario moves toward the coat check, and Bobby follows.      As

he does, Louis walks with him:

Louis nods, understanding.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE EL CARIBE

Rosario leads Bobby back toward the ESCORT CAR.      He leans

forward, grabs her arm. Sotto but intense:

CONTINUED:

Looking down at the ground, she exhales. Hits the side of

a nearby car gently with the palm of her hand, frustrated.

She gets emotional.    Shrugs:

Bobby tries to comfort her, reaches out to her arm.      As

tears come out of her eyes:

Slight comfort. She nods. Bobby leans over, kisses her.

He tenderly puts his hand on her face. She kisses his

hand. Their GUARDS are WATCHING. She smiles, and that

love returns:

CONTINUED: (2)

FADE IN:

EXT. OUTSIDE RIKER'S ISLAND PRISON - EARLY MORNING

Vadim Nezhinski is being led, in handcuffs, into an

unmarked Chevy. Both JOSEPH and Jack are here. Joseph and

Vadim exchange looks as Vadim is placed into the back seat.

Joe's expression is pure suppressed rage...

Joseph gets in his lead car, also an unmarked Chevy.    Both

vehicles pull away from the curb...

INT. STAIRWELL - OUTSIDE MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT

We SEE Bobby's ARMED GUARDS waiting on the steps.    TILT UP

TO the closed door. Over this, we HEAR:

INT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - RAINY DAY

Bobby and Marat Buzhayev, inside the living room.   Bobby

sits down, on the couch's armrest; Marat is in an easy

chair, his lunch being served on a T.V. tray in front of

him by his wife Kalina. The television plays a Russian

movie, and Marat seasons his food.

CONTINUED:

Marat turns to Bobby, puts his hand on his knee. Emotional:

Bobby is moved.    The two embrace.

INT. VADIM'S COP CAR

The car is moving. Jack is driving. Another cop is in the

front passenger seat. Two other cops straddle Vadim.

Silence, then, motioning toward Joseph's car:

INT. JOSEPH'S CAR

As Joseph looks back at Vadim's vehicle, behind him:

INT. VADIM'S COP CAR

Jack puts a cigarette in his mouth, turns to the cop next

to him:

ALL OF A SUDDEN:

CONTINUED:

A VAN CROSSES THE LINE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. COMES RIGHT

TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO PASSENGER'S SIDE. EXPLOSIVE. A

THUNDERING SOUND, GLASS EVERYWHERE. THE COP IN THE

PASSENGER'S SEAT FLIES RIGHT THROUGH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD.

He's probably killed.

INT. JOSEPH'S CAR

The cops see this accident.     The DRIVER:

As Joseph PULLS OUT HIS GUN, READYING HIMSELF TO DO BATTLE,

ANOTHER CAR PULLS IN BETWEEN THEM. AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE

immediately pins Joseph and the other two police inside the

vehicle.

INT. VADIM'S COP CAR

THREE MEN IN SKI MASKS emerge from the van, automatic

WEAPONS IN HAND. JACK PULLS OUT HIS PIECE and immediately

begins firing at them, using the wheel and dashboard as

cover. He opens his door to slink out.

VADIM HITS THE FLOOR.

The other two officers are immediately riddled with

GUNFIRE.

Two of the men PULL VADIM toward them. The third man in a

ski mask is hit by Jack's fire, but has just enough

adrenaline to get into the SECOND CAR.

IT SPEEDS AWAY.

INT. JOSEPH'S CAR

JOSEPH, DUCKED BEHIND THE CAR SEAT AND COVERED WITH GLASS,

THRUSTS HIS HEAD UP.

VADIM IS GONE.

INT. BURT'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

Burt, dressed in his v-neck undershirt, is reaching into a

jar of B & G pickled tomatoes. The television plays "THE

PEOPLE'S COURT". THE PHONE RINGS; Burt grabs the receiver:

CONTINUED:

A beat.   Burt looks disturbed, then:

Burt hangs up, grabs his jacket--which had been draped over

the kitchen chair. Burt bolts out of the house...

INT. MOTEL ROOM

Bobby and Rosario, in media res.     Bobby lights a cigarette.

A KNOCK. BURT BARGES IN. Rosario stands. Other Cops come

through the door as well, beginning a move.

Bobby looks to Rosario, who's in shock.      Burt looks to her:

CONTINUED:

The two start packing...

EXT. MOTEL FRONT - RAINY DAY

Our characters are leaving the hotel, bags and all. The

RAIN comes down in SHEETS. They pause under the awning,

waiting for the cars to be brought close. Burt stands

under the awning, looking out at houses beyond the parking

lot. Rosario is rummaging through her suitcase as Bobby

stands nearby. Vitt approaches Burt:

Burt nods, Vitt runs off. The sound of RAIN. Bobby is

putting his BULLETPROOF VEST on, SEES Burt STARING OUT.

Burt shakes his head, moves to help with the vest:

A GUARD approaches:

CONTINUED:

Rosario is right behind them, listening. When Burt stares

at her, she averts his gaze. Burt changes course:

Burt warms slightly, too. A beat, then the CARS PULL UP.

Bobby looks at his father with real feeling. Burt eyes

him, then touches Bobby's cheek, a truly loving gesture:

Bobby takes Rosario's hand as we GO TO:

EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT

THREE CARS: Burt in one, heading the route. Behind him is

Bobby and Rosario's car, with guard Vitt behind the wheel

and the two of them in the back seat. A third car has TWO

OFFICERS in it. That vehicle trails the other two. The

CARS DRIVE OFF.

NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE IS TO BE SHOT IN A MOSTLY

SUBJECTIVE WAY, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON WITNESSING THE ACTION

AS OUR CHARACTERS WOULD.

INT. BOBBY'S CAR

Bobby and Rosario are in the back seat. She looks through

her pocketbook for some gum, he remains focused on the view

through the windshield of his father's car.

Bobby's driver, Vitt, follows Burt down the streets. RAIN

is FALLING frighteningly HARD, to the point where the

windshield wipers aren't moving fast enough for the water

on the windshield. Upsetting. Visibility's terrible.

The cars swing onto the Kosciusko Bridge loop. The traffic

is sparse this early morning. We HEAR the THUMPETY-THUMP

of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers. And we HEAR

the steady, haunting HUM of the bridge surface beneath the

wheels of the automobiles. Bobby puts his arm around

Rosario, in the back seat. Re the rain:

Bobby does not answer, instead spots an OLDSMOBILE driving

alongside his vehicle. Seems a bit suspicious, the way

it's moving...

A FLASH!

CRACK! A BULLET punctures the windshield, but we don't

HEAR the SHOT. The hole SEEMS TO APPEAR almost out of

nowhere. The windshield cracks down the middle...

VITT IS HIT in the SHOULDER, and he lets out a piercing

cry. Blood hits the seat. Rosario screams. Bobby pushes

her head down, into the back seat.

THE CAR starts to swerve. Bobby climbs awkwardly over to

the front seat. Takes the WHEEL, forcefully pulling Vitt

to the side. To Rosario:

CONTINUED:

Rosario crouches, covers the back of her head with her

hands. THE WATER gets pushed away by the speedy wipers

REVEALING: BURT'S CAR AND THE OLDSMOBILE HITTING EACH

OTHER, SIDE TO SIDE; THEN, A HUBCAP--we don't know from

which car it's been dislodged...

COMES SPINNING AT INCREDIBLE SPEED. AT BOBBY'S WINDSHIELD.

Right at BOBBY, RIGHT AT US. WE BLINK. Bobby swerves.

THE HUBCAP SKIDS OFF the front windshield. Bobby brushes

up against the guardrail. We SEE THAT IT is all that

protects him from spinning off into the river, two hundred

feet below.

Bobby darts from lane to lane, and the THIRD POLICE CAR--

behind the Olds--has SLAMMED on its BRAKES to avoid hitting

Bobby's car...

THE OLDS IS RIGHT NEXT TO BURT'S CAR.      BOBBY SEES the

barrel of the gun swing to Burt.

ANOTHER BIG PUDDLE--A MUFFLED THUNDERCLAP sound... The

water slides away, REVEALING that the back window of Burt's

car has shattered.

Bobby is startled at this, his mouth momentarily drooping

open. He CAN SEE:

HIS FATHER, FIRING his WEAPON out the window at the OLDS.

We HEAR BURT through the RADIO, a STATIC-RAVAGED SIGNAL:

Bobby pulls up alongside the Olds. Looks inside. He tries

to get a good look but cannot. He SEES TWO people in the

car, one driving and one doing the shooting--

BOOM!   And it punctures a hole in the side of Bobby's rear

door.   Rosario is JOLTED--screams again...

She shakes her head, her face still buried in the vinyl.

She's hysterical--but physically unharmed.

The traffic gets denser now. The WEATHER is terrible,

blinding. Rushes of WATER COVER the glass around the car,

wrecking visibility. We ARE ON: the B.Q.E., with many

trucks, big and small, on it.

CONTINUED: (2)

The Olds weaves in and out, in front of and behind, many

large semis. BOBBY WATCHES AS: Burt's car is right behind

the Olds. This is unbelievably dangerous.

A TRUCK starts changing lanes. The Olds scoots past it

before it does, but: Burt does not. THE TRUCK CLIPS Burt's

car on the driver's side. He sneaks through, recovering

and keeping up the pursuit.

POLICE CARS, SIRENS BLAZING, JOIN THE PURSUIT...

The truck starts to skid on the drenched roadway. Then: IT

JACKNIFES, spinning out. The Police Car behind Bobby's

slams into the truck, making a MACABRE CRUNCHING SOUND.

BOBBY'S EYES, as he turns around and witnesses the horrific

accident through the RAIN-SOAKED rear window. It is

TERRIBLE:

The truck CRUSHES the Police car, its carriage flipping

over and flattening the vehicle and probably the people

inside.

The Olds skids ferociously, pulling off the expressway

toward city streets. Burt's car follows. Burt's car and

the Olds are neck-and-neck. Bobby pulls up beside Burt.

Into the radio:

But Burt does not. Burt has a clear shot at the hooded man

in the back seat. HE FIRES.

A HIT! We can see the BLOOD spatter the perp's automobile.

The man's head jerks back spasmodically. We HEAR:

AND THEN, CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY: THREE QUICK CUTS, CLOSER AND

CLOSER...SILENCE... He sees, through the rain: a LONG

SHOTGUN BARREL come out of the window from the rear

passenger's seat area.

His eyes pop. The OLDS SPEEDS UP.    THE BARREL OF THE

SHOTGUN turns:

WATER covers the windshield, BLINDING the driver (and us).

The water slides off the glass.

THEN: A TERRIBLE THUNDERCLAP.

CONTINUED: (3)

BOBBY WATCHES as BLOOD COVERS BURT'S FACE. He's been HIT.

He loses control of the automobile... Bobby freezes, IN

DISBELIEF. IN HORROR. HIS FATHER HAS BEEN SHOT...

EXT. STREET

Through the RAIN, we SEE: a patch of parochial school

children, ASIAN CHILDREN, on the streetcorner.

Bobby's car peels off, away from danger. Burt's car IS

HEADED RIGHT FOR THEM. In what seems like his dazed last

gasp, he SLAMS on the BRAKES. The car skids out, spins.

The motion is DIZZYING...

THE OLDS is uncontrolled. The vehicle moves through a

traffic light, HITTING another car.

STARTS TUMBLING, NOT ON ITS SIDE, BUT HEAD OVER TAIL.

It is one intense image. The car is upside down now. It

slides for tens of feet before stopping. Smoldering...

The rain falls, making an oddly serene sound.   We HEAR

SIRENS. The Police are approaching.

Burt's car stops slowly. He gets out of the car, his face

a mess. He stumbles for a few feet in the rain. BOBBY'S

CAR ARRIVES on the SCENE...

BURT'S EYES ARE RED, filling with blood. His JAW is open.

He gasps for air, a vacant stare on his face. His body

spasms. Then he collapses, on his knees. FALLS. FACE

DOWN. IN A POOL OF BLOOD. The Police are in the

background...

WIDE SHOT of the BLOCK as BOBBY MOVES TO HIS FATHER, WHO IS

LYING ON THE STREET. Bobby bends down, turning his father

over. His father's blood is all over his hands now.

Burt is dead.

Other cops surround them. Bobby looks up at all of them,

they at him. Broken, he pushes the others away. As water

drips off his face:

CONTINUED:

Bobby eyes his father, spent, crestfallen--but not

histrionic. The CAMERA TILTS DOWN. The BLOOD from BURT'S

BODY flows into the street, along the curb,into the gutter.

INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Bobby and Rosario, outside an office. Armed cops are up

and down the hall. We HEAR conversation through the walls.

Bobby is standing, smoking a cigarette, holding back tears.

Rosario is seated on a nearby bench--wet, shivering,

stunned. Rosario looks to Bobby:

Speechless, Bobby nods.     Jack emerges from the office,

approaches Michael:

Bobby, emotional and glassy-eyed, interrupts:

These words hit Bobby.     His eyes close, forcing tears down

his cheeks.

Michael turns to an OFFICER, motions. The officer leaves.

The camera DOLLIES INTO a CLOSE SHOT of Bobby and we GO TO:

INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DEN

Sitting on the couch is Joseph. He is trying to be stoic,

but appears wan and tired. Alone. We HEAR the crowd in

the house, but they are in the living room. A KNOCK: Bobby

enters.

Joseph eyes him, seems heartened by the sight of his

brother. But he is out of it, emotionally bludgeoned:

Bobby walks over to Joseph, stands close to him.   Searches

for words. Before he can speak:

Then, as emotional as we've yet seen him, Bobby strains to

get the sentences out of his mouth:

Bobby breaks down. Joseph responds by CLUTCHING him

tightly. The brothers rock back and forth gently.

INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

The shot is of a small and bare room in a Queens funeral

home. In the center is a COFFIN. The camera DOLLIES

TOWARD IT. Entering the room is an UNDERTAKER, with Bobby

and Joseph right behind.

CONTINUED:

The Undertaker unhinges the coffin. Inside is Burt, eyes

closed, clothed in a suit. We don't see the body; what we

DO see are the reactions of his two sons. Bobby's grief is

obvious, but he's already seen him dead. This is new

territory for Joseph, who though he does not break down,

seems overwhelmed. Both young men nod in acknowledgement,

and the Undertaker closes the coffin.

As the Undertaker leads Joseph away, Bobby enters an:

INT. ANTECHAMBER

Where waiting are Jack and Michael. Bobby gives a fiery

stare to the two cops. He approaches them. Sotto but

intense, his teeth clenched in a simmering anger:

A nod.   Bobby senses uncertainty:

Michael looks to Jack, who steps forward:

CONTINUED:

The men all turn around.    Joseph stands there, wounded but

COMMITTED:

Joseph turns and reenters the room with the coffin. Bobby

WATCHES him from behind, as his hand runs along the top of

the casket. We HEAR:

BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...

EXT. INTERBORO CEMETERY - DAY

A LIMOUSINE pulls up against the backdrop of thousands of

tombstones. Emerging are Bobby and Joseph. They are both

wearing dark sunglasses. Rosario and Sandra and the

children get out behind them and are led away by funeral

coordinators to another place in the coming processional.

In the distance, many many people and a long line of cars

move toward the two brothers.

The Undertaker walks away briefly, to direct some traffic.

Bobby slowly puts his arm around Joseph's waist, prompting:

Joseph grows more emotional, adjusts his sunglasses.    Leans

to Bobby, clears his throat. Sotto:

Bobby is surprised to hear this admission, and is taken

aback by the honesty of it--especially in this moment.

Joseph grabs his brother's arm, his voice cracking:

CONTINUED:

Bobby tears up, his voice breaking too; he shakes his head:

Interrupting the moment, the Undertaker approaches:

The Undertaker guides the two men toward the procession.

Just as the drums reach a THUNDEROUS VOLUME, we GO TO:

MINUTES LATER.

A line of cars files into the cemetery, led by the HEARSE.

The procession is PHENOMENALLY LONG. The New York skyline

is in the distance.

UNIFORMED POLICE LINE the narrow road. The COFFIN is

removed from the HEARSE, put on WHEELS for the move to the

gravesite. Bobby, Joseph approach. The DRUMS CONTINUE:

BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...

People get out of their cars. Many of them we recognize

from elsewhere in the film but don't know by name. One of

the people to emerge from a Town Car is MARAT BUZHAYEV and

his ever-present BABUSHKA WIFE, KALINA.

The walk begins, with everyone saluting Bobby and Joseph.

Behind them, the Mayor, the Commissioner, all the rank and

file of the Force. The turnout is enormous. Rosario is

here too, though several rows back. She is with the women.

Bobby peers at the procession, which is made up of hundreds

of SALUTING COPS, others. AMONG THEM, we SPOT:

LOUIS FALSETTI.

At that moment, BOBBY SEES his old friend, and the two make

EYE CONTACT. Bobby is greatly moved by his appearance, and

nods subtly to Jumbo. Louis salutes gently, a slight and

sympathetic smile coming across his face...

SIMULTANEOUS: Joseph takes a look at the COFFIN, grows more

distraught. He breaks down. Bobby is there to catch him

and does.

CONTINUED: (2)

Several WHITE-GLOVED COPS move to help, and then, trying to

recompose himself, he squeezes his brother's forearm for

support. Tries to straighten:

Bobby is devastated by seeing his brother like this and is

momentarily rendered speechless. He tightens his own grasp

around Joseph, leads him on the walk behind the COFFIN.

FURTHER DOWN THE PROCESSIONAL

Rosario. Walking. Eyeing the Cops, the Cop Wives. She

does not fit in. Cops are staring at her. She SEES COP

WIVES looking at her, leaning over to each other and

TALKING ABOUT HER. Though she can't hear what they're

saying, she is made to feel terribly uneasy...

Rosario quickens her pace away from them, and the MARCH

MOVES ON...

EXT. GRAVESITE

The line of police and relatives now heap dirt onto the

coffin, which is in the ground. BOBBY and JOSEPH silently

lead the line, shoveling dirt and moving on. Rosario moves

behind them. Bobby SEES: BEYOND THE CEMETARY GROUNDS:

TEENAGERS have climbed the trees. And they're LAUGHING at

the spectacle. Michael stands next to Bobby.

A beat, then Bobby speaks in a way that's preoccupied.

Almost as if the words are more for himself than for Mike:

Bobby leans closer, more focused:

Michael turns to him, surprised.

CONTINUED:

A beat, as Mike ponders.     Then:

Bobby looks at his brother, then back to Mike.

Bobby again eyes Joseph, who stands over the grave wiping

his eyes with a handkerchief. He WALKS OVER to him, puts

his arm around him. Into his ear:

Joseph looks at him for a moment, nods subtly.     Then he

looks back into the grave.

ANGLE BACK on Bobby, as he spots ROSARIO, who stares right

back at him. He's GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HER HIS DECISION.

A LINE OF POLICEMEN in white gloves begins to FIRE RIFLES

into the AIR. FIVE SHOTS...

EXT. PAN AMERICAN MOTOR INN - DAY

A fairly run-down place, on the way to Kennedy Airport.

INT. PAN AMERICAN MOTOR INN - SUITE - LIVING ROOM -      DAY

Bobby is still in his funeral suit, standing near the sofa.

Smoking a cigarette, holding a drink in his hand. An ARMED

GUARD accompanies Rosario into the hotel room--they've

arrived home from the funeral separately. She turns her

back to him, puts her handbag down on a dresser.

Bobby eyes the Guard, who promptly leaves the room.      He

places his drink on the coffee table.

She turns.    He starts to take off his tie.

No response from Rosario yet.     Surprised and not surprised.

She looks at him for a moment, then stares at the floor.

Shakes her head. She gets emotional:

CONTINUED:

She is still shaking her head, still staring at the floor:

Bobby gets up, walks over to the desk. Rubs his fingers on

its surface, not looking at her but resolutely:

This seems to focus Rosario who stares at him.      He moves

closer to her:

She halts him, opens up.     Tearful:

CONTINUED: (2)

She is momentarily speechless.

A moment, then she turns to walk toward the bedroom.

Bobby grabs her.

He holds her by the wrists:

CONTINUED: (3)

A TUSSLE. As he tries to restrain her, a torrent of

emotion explodes from Rosario:

She breaks free. Panting, tears streaming down her cheeks.

After a beat, Bobby seeks to calm her.

She looks at him, frozen.

Without a word, she turns and walks back into the bedroom.

Closes the door. Bobby sinks to the couch, picks up his

drink. After a beat, we HEAR a:

THE FACE OF SPIRO GIAVANNIS

As he looks into the CAMERA. We can't yet TELL where we

are. He continues, backing up from us slowly, leading us

somewhere not yet in focus:

We PAN AROUND to REVEAL: BOBBY GREEN, as he steps forward,

in FORMAL POLICE UNIFORM. His HAIR is cut, closely-cropped

now. He is clean shaven. A REAL PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION.

INT. COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE - DAY

A lavish room. Filled with photographs of important people

shaking hands, receiving awards, etc. COMMISSIONER WILLIAM

RUDDY, a middle-aged, balding, and yes, ruddy-faced man, is

here.

CONTINUED:

Ruddy leads him to the corner of the office. Bobby is

guided into position as: the Commissioner picks up a small,

leather-bound black book. With one hand, he holds the

Bible upon which Bobby places his hand. With the other, he

holds a manual, off which he reads an oath:

Bobby repeats after him. (This process continues until the

entire PLEDGE IS COMPLETED.)

SERIES OF SHOTS:

Of Bobby in the POLICE ARMORY. He is RECEIVING his GUN and

his BADGE. Over this, we STILL HEAR:

INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY

He walks down the hall, with his back to us.

BACK TO THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE

Ruddy and Giavannis shake Bobby's hand vigorously:

CONTINUED:

BACK TO THE POLICE STATION HALLWAY

CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY, PAUSING right before he enters the

MUSTER ROOM. HE takes a breath and ENTERS:

INT. POLICE STATION - MUSTER ROOM

Many cops, mug shots and files strewn all over. A

discussion, in media res. Many cops approach Bobby, all of

whom shake his hand, AD-LIBBING WHISPERED "HEY, BOBBY" and

"WELCOME TO THE FORCE." Bobby thanks them, then moves to

stand behind his brother. Michael testily grills Jack on

the investigative progress:

As Michael says the following dialog, a UNIFORMED OFFICER

comes up to Bobby. Sotto, in his ear, he speaks to him:

The Uniformed Officer leaves, and Bobby stays put to hear

this exchange.

CONTINUED:

Michael points to Bobby, who up until now had been focused

on--and concerned by--his brother's behavior.

An awkward silence.    Everyone's pained.   Bobby stiffens:

Michael hesitates, then nods. Everyone wheels around and

exits the room. Jack follows Mike out the door. Bobby

turns to his brother:

CONTINUED: (2)

Bobby eyes Joseph, who looks deeply troubled.   Bobby sits.

Joseph ponders for a beat, then comes out with it:

Just then: the Uniformed Officer KNOCKS and RE-ENTERS:

CONTINUED: (3)

EXT. PAN AMERICAN MOTOR INN - DAY

An UNMARKED CAR with Bobby inside pulls up to the front.     A

GUARD steps forward to greet, protects him.

INT. MOTEL ROOM

Bobby enters. There are several guards in the space.

Bobby scans the room, and quickly notices EVERYTHING OF

ROSARIO'S IS GONE. Bobby wheels around, to a GUARD.

INTENSE EXPRESSION.

The GUARD hands Bobby a NOTE.   BOBBY SEES IT, GRABS IT

WITHOUT READING IT.

Bobby tries to charge past them. The Guards all restrain

him delicately ("C'mon, calm down"), but Bobby is in no

mood and instead starts a melee. He is a tour de force of

energy, and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue

him. The FIGHT is more a WRESTLING MATCH than anything

else, and it is messy, tough:

Bobby's forehead is cut; the struggle is UGLY. The Guards

rouse up enough strength to PUSH HIM into the HOTEL ROOM

for GOOD. THE DOOR SLAMS. A SILENT BEAT. Bobby paces, in

a rage. Then, sarcastic:

CONTINUED:

Bobby stares at the door.

Still in a fury, he takes a lamp and HITS THE DOOR

REPEATEDLY. Then he HURLS the lamp toward a mirror on the

wall, AND IT SHATTERS... Exhausted, he stops. Moves to:

INT. BEDROOM

Where he sits on the edge of the bed, touches his neck.

BLOOD on his hand. He STILL GRIPS THE UNREAD NOTE. He

throws it to the ground; and then, perhaps motivated by the

realization of his situation, a flood of feeling comes over

him. Tears begin to fall down his face, and he succumbs.

It is as though all of the emotions in our story find their

outlet here, in this moment. Bobby lets all the remaining

feeling drain from him until he has nothing left.

After this outburst, he is exhausted. He calms, breathing

heavily. A beat; he puts his bloodied hand to his head...

We PRELAP the SOUND of a PHONE RINGING:

INT. QUEENS BAR - PHONE BOOTH

A noisy Queens place, its blue collar patrons watching

boxing on the television and cheering. PAN OVER TO: one of

those old, in-the-wall phone booths, with a sliding door.

Bobby is on the phone, seated in the dark space. Holds a

GLASS half-full of LIQUOR. Distraught, he listens for an

answer as the PHONE RINGS once more. Then:

A BEAT.   Bobby collects himself.    Then:

CONTINUED:

ANGLE on BOBBY as we GO TO:

INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A SHOW is about to go on. The place has a darker quality

to it now, and many patrons are wearing HALLOWEEN MASKS.

BOBBY ENTERS, approaches a table in the back, where seated

are Louis and Louis' girlfriend, HAZEL. Lou is armed with

a huge grin, and he stands and hugs Bobby:

As they sit, Lou notices Bobby is alone:

CONTINUED:

JUST THEN, THE HOUSE LIGHTS DIM.    A SPOTLIGHT on the STAGE.

MARAT BUZHAYEV ambles up to the microphone with some

difficulty.

APPLAUSE.    Marat holds up his hands to quiet the clapping:

MORE APPLAUSE. THE SPOTLIGHT swings to Bobby, who stands

briefly, sheepishly. Marat waves to him, Bobby nods, sits.

The SPOTLIGHT swings back to Marat who finishes up his

introduction ("Enjoy the show!

CONTINUED: (2)

Thank you.") and exits to still more applause. ELI

MIRICHENKO, Marat's son-in-law, approaches Bobby. In his

EAR:

Eli nods, exits.   Beat.   Then, sensing Bobby's mood:

Louis turns to watch the show for a beat, takes a huge swig

of his DRINK. Then turns AROUND AGAIN; close to Bobby:

Louis turns back to the show. The camera moves into a

CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as Louis' words FREEZE him. He seems

ready to EXPLODE. Then, finally:

CONTINUED: (3)

Bobby gets up with astonishing speed and moves right next

to Louis. He grabs his arm tightly and, in his ear:

The camera MOVES INTO a CLOSE SHOT on LOUIS as he FRETS...

EXT. BACK ALLEY

Still grabbing Louis's arm, Bobby wrenches him loose.

Louis stumbles and falls to the asphalt. Bobby steps

FORWARD. Something is different about him now. He is

colder than ice, his eyes black saucers of rage.

Louis begins to crack.   Tears come to his eyes...

CONTINUED:

Louis begins to sob quietly, shivering. He brings his hand

to his mouth. Bobby takes a threatening step forward:

Louis' eyes widen.    He holds out his hands defensively.

Louis is crying loudly, like a ten year-old. He falls to

his knees. Shivering in fear, he moves to Bobby's feet:

Bobby clenches his fist.    Louis grabs onto him again:

CONTINUED: (2)

Bobby stares at him for a moment, then his teeth grit. He

tries to calm himself but cannot. With a ferocity, he

unleashes a brutal punch across Louis' face with the brunt

of his fist. Louis collapses. In Louis' ear:

THE CAMERA DOLLIES past A SHOOTING GALLERY. ADDICTS, their

inert bodies both crumpled and standing in virtual trances,

wander an ALLEYWAY. They RECOIL from CAR HEADLIGHTS:

EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING

An American sedan, a DARK BLUE car, pulls up to the

building. A man gets out--we can't quite tell who it is

yet...

INT. DARK AND DIRTY HALLWAY - ABANDONED APARTMENT BUILDING

A young AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE stands in a doorway, dressed

in a green parka. The hall, covered with trash and

graffiti, is illuminated by a solitary light bulb. He

guards ANOTHER SHOOTING GALLERY, which is in the room right

behind him.

FOOTSTEPS. The AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE is on guard. The MAN

emerges from the darkness, his back STILL TO US. Upon

seeing him, the African-American Man smiles, reaches into

his pocket. Hands the unseen man a small yellow envelope:

CONTINUED:

We CUT TO the over-the-shoulder of the man, and leaning out

of the DARKNESS and into the LIGHT: ELI MIRICHENKO, Marat's

son-in-law. He continues:

The African-American Man nods. Satisfied with the cash,

Eli turns around, walks back down the hallway. ANGLE BACK

ON AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN as the camera zooms past him, into:

INT. SHOOTING GALLERY

In the darkness, among the addicts: BOBBY GREEN. His face

illuminated only by the sliver of light from the crack in

the door. He's witnessed the whole thing... We HEAR:

INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The group is all together. Cops we don't know pack the

room, standing around the table. Seated at the table:

Michael, Jack, Bobby, and at the head, Joseph. A TOUGH-

LOOKING COP we've seen before but not met:

CONTINUED:

EVERYONE LAUGHS.     Bobby turns to Joseph:

Joseph's back stiffens.       With resolve:

The troops get up to leave.      Jack approaches Joseph.

SOTTO:

Bobby looks at Jack--who leans in, to Joseph's ear:

Joseph contemplates this briefly, then Jack pulls him

CLOSER:

CONTINUED: (2)

Bobby senses the pressure being placed upon his brother,

and he moves Jack away from Joseph:

ANGLE ON BOBBY, JOSEPH as we GO TO:

EXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD - LATE NIGHT/DAWN

SERIES OF SHOTS of:

1. WIDE SHOT of A MARSH AREA, with tall wheatlike weed

growth that is extremely dense.

2. MEDIUM SHOT of a STRUCTURE, in the middle of this. An

old, small, abandoned stone building, built as a WPA

project in the 1930's. It is a men's/ladies' bathroom,

probably a Robert Moses project, but long since abandoned.

3. WIDE SHOT of the STRUCTURE. The CAMERA BOOMS DOWN, from

high above the STONE BUILDING, and PANS to REVEAL the TALL

WEEDS AROUND IT.

4. MEDIUM SHOT of ELI'S DARK BLUE AUTOMOBILE, arriving.

Eli emerges from the car. A bodyguard behind him, armed

with an AK-47. He prepares to GREET:

AN ARRIVING LIVERY CAR.

Out steps: A HOST of men in suits, grasping suitcases--

presumably filled with money.

THEN ANOTHER TOWN CAR.    And yet ANOTHER.

The men all congregate like it's a legal business

transaction. HANDSHAKES, SMILES.

We PAN AROUND, MOVING THROUGH THE WEEDS NOW. And we SEE:

Bobby and Joseph, as they arrive, MOVE INTO POSITION. The

camera MOVES LATERALLY and we SEE: Michael and Jack and

other COPS, doing much the same. All carrying SHOTGUNS.

One COP POINTS A SHOTGUN MICROPHONE at the ACTIVITY, and

our guys can HEAR perp conversations in their EARPIECES...

CONTINUED:

ANOTHER CAR ARRIVES. APPEARING out of it is VADIM

NEZHINSKI. Joseph bristles at the sight of him. Bobby

grabs his brother's arm, squeezes:

JUST AT THAT MOMENT, a WHITE VAN PULLS UP: two men get out.

They open the back, FILLED WITH FURS. They take a number

of coats out of the BACK OF THE VAN, bring them to the

shack...

ALL THE COPS appear confused. What the hell is this?

ANOTHER TOWN CAR. A CROWD OF PEOPLE stand around the auto.

Helping someone out of the vehicle. Whoever this is, he's

the EMPEROR...

EMERGING: MARAT BUZHAYEV. Stepping up behind him, Eli,

helping King Marat. MARAT and VADIM greet each other.

They KISS WARMLY. ANGLE ON BOBBY. A beat. We SEE the

devastation. Almost to himself:

Then the cops spot: TWO YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN, sitting in the

back of the car. They do not get out. They seem clueless.

STANDING GUARD over all of this is a LOOKOUT, who is armed

with an AK-47. Several other ARMED MEN take positions

closer to the structure as the FURS ARE BROUGHT IN.

BUSINESSMEN make some banter, then enter the shack--led by

NEZHINSKI. MARAT BUZHAYEV and ELI follow him in. Many

other men pour into the structure, BRIEFCASES in hand.

A TRANSACTION BEGINS inside the shack, and the COPS are

WATCHING. They SEE the action through BROKEN WINDOWS...

INT. SHACK

NEZHINSKI and MARAT, with the Businessmen. He looks behind

him, to MARAT, who steps forward. In Russian:

CONTINUED:

The Man places a FUR on a distressed countertop.    Rips it

apart. Nezhinski steps forward:

Places one of the lengths of fur into: A BASIN filled with

fluid... The CAMERA ZOOMS into A CLOSE SHOT on the FUR in

that basin...

The FUR IS POKED a COUPLE OF TIMES. A beat. Then: WHITE

PLUMES RISE from the coat's fabric to the top of the

liquid, and Eli begins to skim the substance off the

surface.

DUMPING OUT   some of the substance (now in crystalline form)

onto a pad,   MARAT BUZHAYEV hands it to a BUSINESSMAN, who

TASTES it.    THE BUSINESSMAN nods, pleased with his

product...    He reaches for a SUITCASE. It is OPENED.

Filled with   MONEY.

EXT. FIELD

Bobby and Joseph.    Joseph has his earpiece, HEARS.     Then:

Bobby gets up, out of the weeds, SHOTGUN aimed:

INT. ABANDONED STRUCTURE

Vadim and Marat SNAP TO ATTENTION. SHOCKED. RUSSIAN WORDS

ARE EXCHANGED, and everyone starts to PANIC...

EXT. FIELD

The COPS begin the assault, EXPLODING FROM EVERYWHERE.

SIRENS, the whole thing. Bobby and Joseph get up, stand

into a crouch and move slowly toward the structure. A GROUP

OF ESU COPS charge MARAT'S CAR, GOING FOR THE CHILDREN--who

watch this with fear and incomprehension...

CONTINUED:

An ARMED GUARD, standing outside the shack, begins to fire

at the cops. EVERYONE OPENS FIRE.

ALL OF A SUDDEN: A COP, that TOUGH-LOOKING COP we saw at

Joseph's house but a few moments earlier, is HIT by the

Armed Guard's fire. HIT IN THE FACE, he falls down near

Joseph and Bobby. DEAD, his visage a bloodied pulp.

CLOSE SHOT ON JOSEPH. HE FREEZES. We momentarily FLASH

CUT back to his OWN SHOOTING... He cannot bear reliving

the terror of his moment...

As the COPS move in: Bobby spins around to look for his

brother. He finds him still on the ground. Joseph seems

unable to move, holding onto his shotgun for dear life:

Joseph looks at his brother, shakes his head. Completely

shattered in the moment. STILL. SHOTS RING OUT. Bobby

pushes his brother down on the ground. In his ear:

Chaos begins. All of the men inside the small building

have aimed their guns into the WEEDS. But instead of

stopping because of the shooting, Bobby progresses

inexorably toward the structure, his shotgun poised to

fire.

NOW MICHAEL and JACK and OTHER MEMBERS of the NARCOTICS

TEAMS come out of the WEEDS. THEY FIRE their WEAPONS.

MARAT'S GRANDCHILDREN are DRAGGED OUT OF THE CAR, CRYING

LOUDLY...

FIFTY YARDS AWAY

A LINE of UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS forms. They move in

unison. Seems like a hundred men. Bobby and Jack and some

of his men are coming from one side, the line from another.

SIRENS. A GUN BATTLE. The LOOKOUT with the AK-47 is hit--

fatally. Bobby SEES several people FLEEING out a back

entrance toward another section of the weeds. Joseph

remains in the grass, his head down, his hands on his head.

We cannot SEE his face...

INT. ABANDONED BATHROOM STRUCTURE

Vadim Nezhinski is frazzled by the approaching FORCE he

sees through the window.

CONTINUED:

Moving with tremendous speed, he begins to light the FURS

on FIRE... SMOKE... Vadim BEGINS TO COUGH, taking a

suitcase of money with him. He backs out of the STRUCTURE.

EXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD

BILIOUS CLOUDS OF SMOKE.     BOBBY is MOVING TOWARD THE

BUILDING.

VADIM SCURRIES INTO THE WEEDS... THE SMALL STRUCTURE

REALLY STARTS TO BURN. It is an odd flame, BLUE and

SILENT.

BOBBY RUNS OFF, into THE WEEDS, following VADIM. ELI

CHARGES TOWARD HIS CAR. JACK is RIGHT BEHIND HIM:

Jack ruthlessly pumps Eli full of bullets, and the man

falls down dead. Jack approaches, mercilessly FIRES

ANOTHER SHOT into the corpse...

INT. WEEDS

The WIND HOWLS... Tall, tawny-colored weeds, marsh. BOBBY

moves through the DENSE WEED GROWTH. Pushing his way

through the brown plants.

We HEAR POLICE DOGS. BOBBY starts THRASHING. The CAMERA

is HAND-HELD, MOVING TO AND FRO WITH FEROCIOUS and

VERTIGINOUS SPEED. ANGLE ON BOBBY as we:

INT. CAR - IN THE RAIN

It is Bobby, SEEING, through the WET GLASS: BURT, AS HE IS

SHOT. DURING THE CHASE IN THE RAIN. We GO BACK TO:

EXT. WEEDS

Bobby raises his shotgun as he RACES THROUGH THE PHRAGMITES

GRASS. The WEEDS PART. It is TRICKY. HEAVY BREATHING.

BOBBY SEES other MEN running through the weeds, but he

can't tell who's who. CONFUSION...

BOBBY STOPS. FEET CRUSHING THE TWIGS... A GUNSHOT, FROM

WHERE, GOD ONLY KNOWS... A RUSH OF IMAGES--SHADOWED

FIGURES, OBSCURED BY THE WEEDS, APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR LIKE

PHANTOMS...

BOBBY'S HEARTBEAT THUMPS ON THE SOUNDTRACK... A MAN

backing up toward him; each man has his back to the

other...

CONTINUED:

BOBBY DOESN'T SEE HIM YET. BUT WE CAN. THE CAMERA ZOOMS

INTO BOBBY, WITH THE FIGURE BEHIND HIM. BOBBY SEES THE

SHADOW ON THE GROUND. He turns, SLOWLY...raises his

weapon, about to FIRE when he realizes:

It's MICHAEL SOLO, who, in profile to Bobby is unaware he's

almost been killed. He stops when he feels the barrel of

Bobby's shotgun against his ribs. SLOWLY TURNING AROUND,

he sees BOBBY. WHISPERED:

ALL OF A SUDDEN, we HEAR, SHOUTED:

Bobby looks at Michael, points to his earpiece. Michael

nods, and as we HEAR Mike's words into his radio ("Our

guys, outta the brush!") Bobby starts to back up, toward

the clearing...

EXT. CLEARING

Bobby is greeted by the boys. Other POLICE, including

Michael Solo, emerge from the weeds, quietly. Jack

APPROACHES:

Bobby acknowledges this, turns to another OFFICER:

The Officer looks, counts.     Then nods.   Bobby looks toward

the weeds and says:

SEVERAL COPS BREAK FLARES, ROLLING THEM INTO THE WEEDS.

CONTINUED:

All the officers back up--all of them except Bobby. Who

stands, shotgun in hand, waiting for VADIM NEZHINSKI to

emerge from the now-burning brush.

TWO OTHER MEN come out of the fire, coughing. They are

carrying their guns and thus killed by POLICE GUNFIRE. NO

SIGHT OF NEZHINSKI AS BOBBY WAITS. AT LAST, HE DECIDES TO

GO IN.

AS the other POLICE panic around him, Bobby ENTERS THE

FIRE...

INT. FIERY WEEDS

Bobby walks through the FLAME. It is OTHERWORLDLY. The

ORANGE-BLUE, the SMOKE, it all seems to blow from left to

right...

CHAOS of HEAT, SMOKE... We HEAR ONLY THE RUSHING WIND...

BOBBY seems INCONCEIVABLY DRIVEN. Methodically stepping

forward, past the FIRES, PEERING THROUGH SMOKE. NOTHING...

JUST TUFTS OF SMOKE...

Then he spots an area in which the SMOKE FLOWS UNNATURALLY,

AGAINST THE BREEZE, as though it SURGES AROUND SOMETHING...

SOMETHING COVERED IN SMOKE, STANDING...

A GUST OF WIND PASSES--REVEALING--A SILHOUETTED FIGURE,

WITH HIS ARM RAISED, POINTING, RIGHT AT BOBBY.

VADIM NEZHINSKI, POISED TO SHOOT.

Within what seems like a split second, Bobby raises his

SHOTGUN and FIRES it. VADIM CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND. A

DIRECT HIT to the chest.

Bobby lifts his shotgun and approaches. The weeds

separate, REVEALING NEZHINSKI, with a look on his face that

registers a kind of shock, a shock that he's been hit.

Nezhinski sees Bobby standing over him. With all the

energy he has in the world:

Bobby stands over him for a BEAT. Then Bobby turns his

back on Vadim, walks through the fires around him. As

Vadim calls after him ("BOBBY!

CONTINUED:

PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!"), the flames begin to engulf

the area where Nezhinski lies...

EXT. FIELD

BOBBY EMERGES FROM THE FIRE...     HE WALKS TOWARD THE POLICE

CARS. THE POLICE ARE ASSEMBLED     around: MARAT BUZHAYEV.

BOBBY WATCHES HIM FOR A MOMENT,    HIS FACE filled with

CONTROLLED RAGE. BEAT. EACH MAN    STARES AT EACH OTHER. THEN:

BOBBY TAKES A THREATENING STEP FORWARD. Bobby's expression

seems unmatched in its ferocity; Marat sees in Bobby's eyes

a horrible determination, begins to cry... Bobby's

emotions are a CAULDRON:

Marat gets on his knees. WHIMPERING. Bobby puts Marat's

hands on his head, starts PATTING HIM DOWN. CLEAN.

BOBBY PUTS THE SHOTGUN AT MARAT'S TEMPLE.    We HEAR the

DOGS, the FIRE, the WIND, the SIRENS...

The police see the unforgiving expression on Bobby's face

and the reality of the old man in front of them. Bobby

turns to the others, particularly JACK. He looks at him,

dark-eyed. Then he turns away and starts walking, making

eye contact with none of them. He utters a command, to all

of them and none of them in particular:

Bobby walks past the small building, which CONTINUES TO

BURN SILENTLY--with that eerie BLUE FLAME... Other cops

watch him with awe and respect. They back away from him.

He proceeds on toward the cars.

HE SEES: Joseph inside one of them, still. Staring at him.

WE DOLLY WITH HIM as he moves to his brother. CROUCHES

DOWN, stays by JOSEPH...

CLOSE SHOT OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT BOARD, SURROUNDED BY FLOWERS:

"ONE P.M.: N.Y.P.D. EVENT - ACADEMY GRADUATION."

INT. ONE POLICE PLAZA - FOYER - OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM

HUNDREDS OF POLICE OFFICERS, all dressed up to the nines,

are HERE. White gloves and all. Milling about in a white

plaster walled room. Upbeat chatter. Then: Bobby emerges

through the DOORS in his DRESS BLUES. Upon seeing him, the

others smile, CHEER. People touch him, shake his hand.

Eye him with respect. AD-LIB GREETINGS.

Bobby moves toward the AUDITORIUM DOORS.   Now Michael

approaches. In Bobby's ear:

Bobby sees: JOSEPH, STANDING nearby with his hand on his

child's shoulder, the rest of his FAMILY SURROUNDING HIM.

The brothers embrace. Then:

INT. AUDITORIUM

The ceremony is getting underway. As Bobby and Joseph move

past the seated crowd toward their chairs in front:

CONTINUED:

Bobby approaches the POLICE CHAPLAIN, hands him a note.

The CHAPLAIN looks at the paper, nods. He then walks to

the podium. Bobby sits as the Chaplain begins:

ANGLE ON BOBBY as his REAL NAME is SPOKEN:

CONTINUED: (2)

As the man speaks, Bobby SCANS the room. HE SEES ROSARIO,

standing in the crowd behind the seated audience. Her face

is partially obscured. BOBBY CANNOT BELIEVE THE FLOOD OF

EMOTION that overwhelms him, the happiness he feels upon

catching a glimpse of her.

But just as quickly as this thrill grabs him, it disappears

when she becomes completely visible; for he realizes that

IT IS NOT HER but rather a young woman who bears merely a

faint resemblance... Joseph interrupts this, leans over:

Police line up on the stage. Everyone's seated, Bobby and

Joseph in front. The POLICE BAND begins to play the drums.

Bobby straightens up, raises his hand--along with the sea

of blue--in a SALUTE as the flag is carried to the front.
