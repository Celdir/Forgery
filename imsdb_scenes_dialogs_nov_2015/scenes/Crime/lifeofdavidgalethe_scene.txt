FADE IN:

EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE

A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely

highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through

the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The

sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO

into the mist.

She runs, and runs.

She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway.

Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a

tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.

She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

INT. OFFICE OF "DEATHWATCH AUSTIN" - SUNRISE

A clock on the wall: 6:11.

Beneath the clock a simple banner reads "DeathWatch Austin."

The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled

with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates.

About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces.

Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with

a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer

screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs

quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a

phone to one ear.

The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12.

CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE

(31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at

nothing. She bites her lip.

They all exchange looks: they've lost. David stands.

A PHONE RINGS. David controls himself.

Another PHONE RINGS. Constance stands.

He nods to her, exits.

She walks to the photo wall. With a red magic marker she

marks a cross over the photo of a Hispanic male.

The wall clock reads 6:13.

EXT. PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF OFFICE - SUNRISE

The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going

to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty

parking lot to Volvo station wagon.

As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the

capitol building in the distance.

INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE

David drinks from a travel cup as he drives, windows down.

EXT. INTERSECTION - SUNRISE

David stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop

inside. The cop gives him a cursory glance.

INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE

He stares at the cop. The cop looks neutrally ahead; behind

him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the

reflection of the rising sun.

BACK TO DAVID

He stares, then:

The cop ignores him.

The cop looks over; his face says he expects a confrontation.

David points to the seat belt buckle.

The cop nods, weary, embarrassed. He reaches back for the

belt. David takes a sip and drives on.

CLOSE ON TELEVISION

Court TV reporter, Roberts, stands in front of the Supreme

Court.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE IN:

INT. NEWS MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY

KRUGER (47) watches with a leg up on her messy desk, eating

low-fat tortilla chips and massaging a knee with an electric

massager. A name plate on her desk reads "Barbara D. Kruger,

Crime and Courts Editor." News magazine covers are on the

walls. Kruger is black, short, overweight, wears an old

jogging suit and new oversized athletic shoes. She has half-

frame granny glasses on a cord around her neck.

Kruger reaches for a phone, hits four numbers, takes a chip.

ON TV

A book-jacket photo of Constance.

BACK ON ROBERTS

ON KRUGER

She waits impatiently, munching, swallowing.

She holds the phone out in the direction of the TV, uses the

opportunity to eat another chip.

ON TV

We see old footage of David on a TV talk show.

ON KRUGER

Bitsey Bloom (The runner from the opening) enters. She wears,

as always, a tailored suit.

Kruger shushes her with a we-know-already gesture.

She puts him on SPEAKER, and reaches for a chip.

Bitsey shoots Kruger a look, mouths "you're sick."

Bitsey and Kruger moan in unison.

Bitsey vehemently shakes her head "no" to this idea.

Kruger hangs up the phone before he can respond.

Kruger reaches for a chip.

INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

ZACK (boyish, 24) sits in the passenger seat, smoking and

looking at a case file in his lap. He holds the cigarette

just outside the slightly open window. Zack has a bohemian

grunge thing going -- long hair, ultra-hip glasses. As Bitsey

drives, she keeps looking down at the dash's instrument panel.

We hear strained patience in her voice.

EXT. INTERSTATE 45 - NIGHT

The car's lights move past a sign: "Huntsville 27 Miles."

INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

Zack has a police photo: a woman naked on a kitchen floor,

hands handcuffed behind her. Over her head is an opaque white

plastic bag, sealed around the neck with duct tape.

She looks at him a beat.

Zack picks up another file photo: Christmas shot of the Gale

family: David (31), his wife (Sharon, beautiful, 29), and

son (Chase, 6).

CLOSEUP - OVERHEAT LIGHT

is on.

BACK TO SCENE

Bitsey keeps looking down at the light.

Zack reaches for the car ashtray.

Zack pinches the cherry off, lets it drop out the window.

He shows her the filter, animatedly puts in the ash tray.

She gives him a look. They ride a beat in silence.

Bitsey sniffs.

She points to an approaching rest area exit sign. They share

a glance, then a laugh. Zack affects an evil, maniacal cackle.

EXT. REST AREA EXIT - NIGHT

The car exits for the rest area.

Zack mimics the OPENING MUSIC to "Dark Shadows."

EXT. REST AREA - NIGHT

Well lit and empty. The rental car is parked with the hood

up. They stand looking at the radiator.

He puts his hand on it.

Bitsey shrugs.

Zack animatedly adjusts his balls, spits.

Bitsey's not paying attention. She's watching headlights

coming toward them.

A late model pickup pulls up behind them. They shade their

eyes from its headlights. The lights go off. An OLDER COWBOY

(mid-60's, Stetson, lizard skin boots) steps out.

EXT. HUNTSVILLE MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

The motel lies adjacent to Interstate 45 and a Kettle

restaurant. The rental car pulls up to the reception building.

EXT. HUNTSVILLE MOTEL SIX - NEXT DAY

The rental car is parked in front. The morning is overcast,

it's sprinkling. Bitsey emerges from one of the rooms on the

second floor carrying an umbrella.

INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - DAY

Bitsey enters and sees Zack in a booth, smoking and reading.

The hyper-smiley TEENAGE HOSTESS approaches her.

Bitsey ignores her, takes a menu without comment. She goes

and sits across from Zack; he's reading Dialogical Exhaustion

by David Gale.

Bitsey opens the menu; he puts the book down.

She's unsure how to interpret his comment. He smiles.

They stare at each other. Zack picks up his book, starts to

read, affects a shiver.

EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY

Drizzle. The prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a

few hundred yards down the road. In front of the guardhouse

is a sign: "TDC Ellis Unit. All visitors must report."

SUPERIMPOSE: "DAY ONE"

The rental car ENTERS the FRAME, brakes briefly for the empty

guardhouse, and moves on toward the prison.

EXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY

Bitsey and Zack get out of their car. She has an umbrella.

Three razor wire fences surround the prison. Guard towers

rise at the corners. Outside the fence sits a small building

with a sign: "REPORT HERE."

Bitsey makes a there-you-have-it face. They move toward the

building.

Someone hawks. They look over. Within the fence, a skinny

Hispanic inmate (50's) spits. He's hunched in the rain thirty

yards away. He watches them neutrally.

CAMERA TRACKS Bitsey and Zack as they walk nervously past a

series of kennel-like pens that run along a long building.

Inmates watch them pass: A smoking, tattooed white male (30's)

stands by his door. A muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim

skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside

him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back

against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white

guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the

building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger

(20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the

chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face.

INT. ELLIS RECEPTION OFFICE

As Bitsey and Zack enter, a clean-cut man in his forties is

on the phone (DUKE GROVER). He waves them in and holds up a

wait-just-a-second finger.

The office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet.

A portrait of GOVERNOR HARDIN (female, mid-50's) is on the

wall, a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other.

At a desk sits a WOMAN WITH TEXAS HAIR (40's).

Grover hangs up.

They shake hands.

Grover's demeanor suggests a successful Little League coach,

his suit suggests J.C. Penny. He speaks quickly.

EXT. ELLIS UNIT ENTRANCE

Bitsey and Grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the

Unit gate -- Grover walks as fast as he talks. Zack follows,

turns his collar up.

Zack smiles to himself.

The unit fence gate parts as they enter. The older gate guard

nods as they pass.

They come to the door of the entrance area.

The DOOR BUZZES, Grover opens it.

INT. ELLIS ENTRANCE LOBBY - DAY

The lobby has institutional chairs and few vending machines.

To one side is a guard's counter and a walk through metal

detector. They enter and make their way toward the counter.

They arrive at the counter. Behind it are two GUARDS, one

male, one female.

Grover keeps talking as he walks around the detector and

waits for her.

He leads them down the hall.

And any discussion of criminal activity on your part is

admissible. Not plannin' a jailbreak are you, Bitsey?

INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY

The door guard gets up from his small table and opens the

door for them.

The visitation hall has the linoleum-and-fluorescent feel of

an empty school cafeteria. It is seamlessly intersected by

curved wall of sheer glass. Across the hall a guard's booth

is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look

like they are in a sound booth.

Every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. On the

visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each

section. Just getting up from a chair in the hall's center

is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots.

This is David's lawyer, BENJAMIN BELYEU (late 30's).

On the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs

trace the outline of its curve. Above each chair a microphone

hangs from the ceiling. The center chair is in a stainless

steel cage. Inside sits David Gale.

He exits as Bitsey and Zack make their way toward Belyeu and

David; it's a walk of about twenty-five feet.

Belyeu's voice is a thick combination of Cajun and Harvard

Yard.

Belyeu speaks as slowly as Grover did quickly. David stands

up politely in his cage -- he's too tall and has to hunch.

Belyeu laughs, smiles pure Old New Orleans charm.

Belyeu takes a few steps toward them, extends his hand.

They move toward David. A SPEAKER-SYSTEM LOUDLY (really

loudly) interrupts:

All wince. David sits, smiles, a bit embarrassed.

A beat. They all look over at the guard's booth. One of the

guards makes a get-on-with-your-business gesture.

Belyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts

to stuff them into his antique carpetbag.

Bitsey's confused. Belyeu just smiles at her, then looks up

at the microphone. She understands, nods.

Belyeu picks up his bag. He and Zack start the hike to the

door. Belyeu turns, walks backwards.

David waves "get lost." Belyeu turns.

They watch him walk away. Bitsey turns to David. He's looking

at the floor, caught in a thought.

She does so. David smiles at her, he has a beautiful smile,

sincere, charming, vaguely devilish.

David looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in the

air. Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse.

Bitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen.

David smiles, nods.

He shrugs.

She sits with pen on paper, poised for dictation.

David looks at her a long beat, then gives her the smile.

D) OVERHEAD

SEXY FEMALE GRAD STUDENT (over-dressed in a mini-skirt and

heels) moves hurriedly through the University of Texas (U.T.)

campus.

E) FROM BEHIND TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS

attending class in an U.T. lecture hall -- they are laughing

as David entertains from a mike at the podium.

INT. U.T. LECTURE HALL - DAY

Thirty animated students (circa 1992) are listening to David

lecture. He's younger (31), vibrant -- looks like a grad

student himself. On the white board behind him are phrases:

"Lucan," "objet petit a," "Fantasy Theory."

As women applaud...

Laughter.

The crowd laughs, David changes tone.

The over-dressed Sexy Grad Student enters loudly from a side

door, out-of-breath and discombobulated. The crowd laughs at

the timing. David pauses.

He animatedly gestures to the seats, waits a beat as she

moves towards them.

The Sexy Student sits, adjusts herself.

A guy behind the Sexy Student taps her on the shoulder, she

turns and he hands her letter from the registrar's office.

It's from a girl friend two rows back. The girlfriend mouths,

"It came today?"

Laughter. The Sexy Student turns back around, throws the

letter in a book.

INT. U.T. HALLWAY - DAY

Students pour out of the double doors leading from David's

class. The hall is crowded. Standing waiting for him against

the wall is Constance (glasses, granola clothes).

She's looking at a document, holds a file.

INT. U.T. LECTURE HALL - DAY

The students are leaving. David is quickly erasing the white-

board. The Sexy Student approaches him (her name is Berlin).

He turns, nods, takes his books and papers from the podium.

He looks at her a beat, starts to walk toward the door.

He stops, turns.

She affects a solicitous shyness -- then goes all sex.

He checks the room, then comes over to her, close.

He smiles, turns, walks away. As she watches, anger builds.

INT. U.T. HALLWAY - DAY

David comes out the room. Constance sees him, hurries to

him. She's excited, and speaks now -- as always -- with

absolute authority. They talk as they walk down the crowded

hall.

She hands him a copy.

EXT. U.T. CAMPUS - DAY

David and Constance exit the building into the sun.

They've come to a sidewalk junction, stop.

She looks at him sternly over the top of her glasses.

EXT. GALE HOME - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

The house is an immaculately restored two-story Victorian,

far better than what a university professor can afford.

The grounds are perfect. David's Volvo is in the driveway,

his wife's new Laredo beside it. On the street out front

sits a new VW Beetle.

INT. KID'S ROOM - NIGHT

David's son -- CHASE -- sits in bed holding a stuffed sheep

in the air. David turns off the light in the adjacent

bathroom, comes in holding his son's jeans and shoes. David

wears a t-shirt which says "Evil-Doer & Curious Person." The

room is over-decorated with boy stuff.

INSERT - KID'S CALENDAR

hangs above the bed, opened to the month of March. It has a

felt-tipped pen hanging from a piece of string taped to it.

Ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days, then there are

three empty days before a large smiley face awaits on the

fourth. The frowny faces are in a kid's hand, the smiley

face in an adult's.

BACK TO SCENE

David puts the jeans and shoes away.

David comes and sits beside his son. Points to an African

statue (a man holding a spear) on the bedside table.

Chase reaches under the sheets, searches, finally pulls out

a laser pointer.

He "shoots" some toys in the corner with the red laser dot.

He tucks his son in.

Chase giggles, points at his dad, then pokes his nose.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Obsessively cool, full of designer furniture and rough

fabrics. The art is mostly contemporary and conspicuously

lit -- a Damien Hirst piece sits in one corner. A few African

antiquities are scattered throughout.

A BABYSITTER sits on the couch reading a school textbook,

holding lip gloss and absentmindedly applying it as she reads.

David passes on his way to the door.

He exits. When she hears the DOOR CLOSE, the Babysitter

reaches for the TV remote.

INT. DUPLEX - LIVING AREA - NIGHT

The duplex is upscale, two-story with a vaulted ceiling.

Scattered about are forty party-goers, mostly grad students.

Some spill out onto the back patio and around the pool.

Everyone has a t-shirt with a philosophic idea ("Yawnic,"

"Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know," "[Philosophic t-shirt]".)

LEONARD COHEN MUSIC PLAYS.

FROM FRONT DOOR

GREER (late 20s, Persian, "Host" t-shirt) escorts David into

the living room.

Greer leaves him at the sofa where an OLDER PROFESSOR (60s,

homemade t-shirt -- "Pre-Socratic" -- over his shirt and

tie) stands speaking with ROSS (late 40s, "Homosexualist" t-

shirt).

He moves to the patio. They watch him go.

They sit on the sofa.

She's standing behind them. David tilts his head back.

She's tipsy, brings her face down between their heads.

An uncomfortable beat. She reaches over and takes Ross's

drink from his hand, drinks the rest, puts it back.

Ross walks to the bar. Berlin comes around and sits in his

seat. Her mid-drift T-shirt reads "Sex is Power."

A beat. She's turned facing him, he looks forward.

ON FOOD AND DRINKS TABLE

Ross has two gin-and-tonics and is finishing pouring David's

Black Bush. He moves away. The table is neatly laid with

snacks and bottles. The flower arrangement is perfect.

SAME SCENE - LATER

The table is now in mid-party chaos. Food spilled, bottles

empty, the flowers in disarray. "I'M TOO SEXY" PLAYS LOUDLY

in the background. Berlin takes a bottle of Red Label from

the table.

CAMERA TRACKS her THROUGH the living room, where a few people

now dance, and out onto the patio.

A crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool.

They surround two patio chairs which face each other, one

with David, the other with Ross. The men are playing an Irish

drinking game -- the crowd has chosen favorites.

Laughter, a few animated moans. David raises his glass to

Ross and downs a whiskey. Someone starts to chant: "Gale!

Gale! Gale!"

Laughter. Two women holding each other boo. Ross drinks.

The crowd wants more. Someone makes chicken sounds.

David looks at him, contemplates, then smiles. He holds his

glass out for a refill. The crowd applauds.

FULL SHOT OF PATIO

The crowd is chanting: "Ross! Ross! Ross!"

SAME SCENE - LATER

The crowd has dispersed. A couple of small groups converse.

Someone is being thrown into the pool. TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS.

Inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it.

INT. BATHROOM

David is washing his face. As he dries, the TECHNO MUSIC

downstairs gets BRIEFLY LOUDER. He looks from beneath the

towel into the mirror. Berlin has entered the bathroom.

She locks the door, leans back against it. She's flushed.

He folds the towel.

David lays the towel down, leans back against the sink --

they face each other on opposite sides of the bathroom.

He laughs.

He makes an I'm-not-so-sure face. She moves playfully toward

him.

She comes up to him, leans into him as she puts her mouthclose

to his ear. He keeps his hands back on the sink counter.

She stands with her body against him, looks into his eyes.

She puts her fingers over his mouth, keeps them there.

With her free hand she takes one of his, rubs it against her

face and lips as she speaks.

She moves his hand down, brushing it against her breast and

to her groin. She brings her mouth toward her fingers --

which are still against his lips.

With her eyes open, she kisses the back of her own fingers,

runs her tongue between them, opens them to reach his mouth.

INT. HALLWAY

A Hispanic woman (T-shirt: "DerriDa-Da") bee-bops to the

bathroom door. Tries the handle, then dances away.

INT. LIVING ROOM

About eight dancers dance to the TECHNO MUSIC -- its pace

increasing. A couple them are really into it.

INT. BATHROOM

Berlin and David are against the sink, kissing in full

passion. The MUSIC from downstairs seems LOUDER. Her T shirt

is off. Panting, he turns her against the sink.

Pulls her skirt up, reaches for her panties.

He does so.

INT. KITCHEN

Ross sits at the kitchen table, holding his throbbing head

against the POUNDING MUSIC. Greer sets a cup of coffee in

front of him, sits across. A long beat. They seem like parents

waiting out a teenager's party.

INT. BATHROOM

Berlin is back against the sink, undoing David's fly as he

takes his T-shirt off. The MUSIC from downstairs seems even

LOUDER. His pants and underwear fall. He starts to penetrate

her.

She turns, faces the mirror. He positions himself behind,

enters her.

He moves against her.

He looks at her in the mirror, then continues. She watches

him.

ON PATIO

A guy sits alone at the far end of the pool on a lounger.

The dancers can be seen in the living room behind him.

INT. BATHROOM

David thrusts against Berlin, her thighs pound against the

edge of the sink. The MUSIC is as LOUD as it is downstairs.

He looks at her in the mirror, unsure.

He thrusts harder.

They continue in rhythm. She reaches back and pulls him into

her.

She watches him do so in the mirror.

INT. LIVING ROOM

The dancers dance -- the TECHNO PACE has INCREASED even more.

One dancer is a blur.

INT. BATHROOM

Berlin is pulling David into her. They approach a climax.

She scratches him on the small of the back. Blood trickles.

INT. LIVING ROOM

The MUSIC and dancers are in pure FRENZY. Suddenly, the MUSIC

STOPS. Greer stands by the STEREO, his hand coming back from

the power button. He gestures "that's-all-folks."

INT. BATHROOM

David and Berlin stand still and apart, breathing heavily

into the reality-inducing silence. He looks at her in the

mirror, a look of shame. She gives him an odd smile.

INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Constance wakes with a jolt, sweating. She gets up and goes

cabinet. It's stacked with prescription medicines. Suddenly,

she turns to the toilette, vomits.

INT. BARNES & NOBLE COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

David and Constance sit by a window, the U.T. campus in the

b.g. David's distracted, wearing a suit and a long face.

She's wearing the closest thing she has to business attire.

She has stacks of paper spread in front of her.

He makes an effort, plays the "good listener."

David nods.

She looks through her papers, finds the copy in the stack

beneath her coffee cup. She starts to hand it to him. He is

looking out the window, caught in a thought.

A beat. His reaction tells her the jest hit home.

A longer beat. He holds her eyes.

She's stunned, then genuinely angry.

He looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched.

She trails off. They stare at each other a beat. Then, she

starts to collect the papers.

As she collects, she winces, grabs her side.

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

Two people sit in front of monitors displaying various angles

on sound stage. The main monitor is playing the end of the

show's signation.

ON SOUND STAGE

A camera operator cues the host (50s, male, bow tie). The

host is flanked by David and Governor Hardin.

The set has an upscale regional television look. The Governor

has the rare ability to look comfortable while David fidgets.

Constance stands behind the cameras. She motions to David --

something about the papers in front of him.

Constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile. The Governor

is unsure how to react, then laughs. The host chuckles with

her.

The host's laughter is overdone. David smiles. Constance

bites her lip.

The Governor makes an animated thinking face.

Constance makes a "Yes!" gesture with her hands. The Governor

is surprised into silence. The host laughs and, noting her

reaction, trails off. David becomes more confident, his tone

more sincere.

David cuts his eyes briefly to Constance.

Constance rolls her eyes. The Governor is ready for this.

A beat. David doesn't respond.

A long, miserable beat.

Constance shakes her head in irritation.

BACKSTAGE - LATER

The show is over. David and the Governor are shaking hands.

Constance stands nearby.

She moves toward her handlers.

Constance's and David's polite smiles follow her.

EXT. TELEVISION STATION - DAY

Constance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to the

parking lot.

They come to the end of the sidewalk, where two SUITS are

standing -- one Hispanic, one white (30s).

The officers show their Ids. Constance takes one to examine

it more closely.

The officers exchange a look.

Constance and David look at each other, stunned.

INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY

CAMERA CRANES DOWN and ROTATES, ENDING UPRIGHT BY Bitsey as

she listens to David.

The speaker, loud as ever, startles Bitsey. David nods over

to the guard's booth.

A guard approaches. David stands up and moves to the back of

his cage, puts his hands behind him and out the slot in the

back to be handcuffed.

Cuffed, David stands aside for the cage door to be opened.

EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Bitsey and Zack are walking from the Kettle to their rooms.

Zack is lighting a cigarette. The rain's stopped, but the

lot is wet.

They walk a beat in silence.

They come to the stairs and start up.

In a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the

rest area. The older cowboy watches Bitsey and Zack climb

the stairs. On his STEREO, PUCCINI plays. Once they are in

their rooms, he TURNS UP the opera, closes his eyes, feels

the music.

INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

The car moves through an older Austin suburb with wood framed

houses (circa 1950) in varying states of repair.

It's an overcast day. Zack drives, slowly, searching.

Bitsey has the passenger seat fully reclined, lies with her

eyes closed.

SUPERIMPOSE: DAY TWO.

She looks up. Zack is pointing at house 3307, which needs

paint and a lawn mower. In front of the house is a homemade

sign which reads, "David Gale Death House and Museum" See

where it happened!" Beneath are the opening hours (12-8);

someone has marked them out and scribbled "ring bell."

They share a look.

EXT. PORCH OF HOUSE 3307 - DAY

Bitsey rings the bell. Zack stomps out a cigarette, points

out a worn "Block Home" sign in the window, raises his

eyebrows. As Bitsey straightens her skirt, the door is opened

by a GOTH GIRL, probably not quite eighteen.

She has jet-black hair, nose piercings, tattoos, a Nine Inch

Nails T-shirt. METAL MUSIC comes from within.

The Goth Girl just looks at them. After an uncomfortable

silence, Bitsey extends her hand.

Her voice is slacker monotone.

A beat.

Bitsey reaches in her bag.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

They enter. The room is dark, messy, with an old couch and

TV/VCR. A kitchen is adjacent. The walls are full of Goth

bric-a-brac: London Batcave poster, one from Burton's

Frankenweenie, a couple of fan-zine pictures of Siouxsie and

the Banshees. In one corner is a very expensive STEREO, from

which THE CURE plays. In another, a dead plant. The Goth

Girl turns the MUSIC DOWN.

A table near the door has numbered photos beneath a torn and

curling sheet of plastic. Small packets of snapshots sit on

the table along with a few hand-labelled videos and a book

of clippings. There's also a guest book.

Bitsey signs in.

Zack signs in.

Bitsey does so. As does Zack.

Zack puts his back. Bitsey is looking at a photo: the Goth

Girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plastic

wrap over her head. She's handcuffed and wearing a platinum

blonde wig. The pose is half-corpse, half-pinup.

Zack looks at a video, hand-labelled: "Constance Harraway

Murder (with breasts)! Copyright 1997! Svengali Productions!"

She takes them to the coffee table. Among her own things, a

dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler

(an index card with the #1 leans against it). The area has

been outlined on the table with white shoe polish.

Bitsey and Zack exchange a look. The Goth Girl moves into

the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the various

areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed --

the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto the

patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty

pots with dead plants lying around.

By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined

and indexed (#2).

She moves to the sink. On the linoleum, the position of

Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3). In this area are

a pair of handcuffs (#4). Not far off is a roll of packing

tape (#5). A pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on

the sink counter (#6).

Zack picks up the gloves.

He puts them back.

A beat. Zack's shocked.

Got questions?

INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

Bitsey drives. They are on the two-lane highway to Huntsville.

Zack smokes out the window.

He does so.

They look in their respective mirrors. Some distance behind

them is the older cowboy in his pickup.

INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY

Bitsey sits in front of David. He's less animated than the

day before, drained. He rubs his wrists. They are speaking

in hushed tones.

A beat.

A beat. She nods.

A beat.

He shakes his head.

It takes Bitsey a second to understand. David smiles.

ACCELERATED ROTATING ZOOM OUT TO LONG SHOT.

WHITE.

INT. U.T HALLWAY - LONG SHOT - DAY

ACCELERATED ROTATING ZOOM IN.

David and Constance stand by the double doors. He's

concentrated; she's biting her lip. They're looking onto a

large parking lot.

The lot is practically empty except for Sharon and Chase,

who stand near their Jeep. It's packed with various household

items, things not entrusted to movers.

He nods and goes out.

EXT. U.T. PARKING LOT - DAY

As David approaches them, Chase runs to them -- still carrying

Cloud Dog. He jumps on his dad.

As he walks, David drapes the boy sideways over his shoulders

(like a fur). Chase squeals with pleasure.

Chase bonks him on the nose. David sets Chase down when he

reaches his WIFE. He kiss him goodbye as the boy struggles

to move on to something else. A long beat as David and his

wife stand uncomfortably.

A beat.

She turns and walks to the Jeep. The door's open.

Chase climbs in, sits in the driver's seat.

Chase scoots over to the passenger seat. Sharon gets in the

driver's seat.

She closes the door. Suddenly, Chase opens the passenger

side door, runs around the Jeep carrying Cloud Dog. He runs

to his dad, hugs him one last time.

Chase starts to go back, turns and hands David his Cloud Dog

without comment. He then quickly runs back around the Jeep

and gets in.

David watches them drive away. Chase's hand waves out the

window until they are out of the parking lot.

INSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN

with an e-mail message: "David, I want a divorce. I'm sorry

to say it so plainly, but that's how I feel it. I don't need

time to think, this whole 'rape' thing has only forced..."

INT. DAVID'S U.T. OFFICE - DAY

David sits in front of his computer, staring into space.

The office is institutional, cramped. Books line the walls,

fill the desk.

There's a framed poster (Warhol-style) of Socrates. He reaches

into his desk for a bottle of Black Bush and fills his glass.

There's a KNOCK on the door. Constance enters.

David closes the e-mail. She collapses in the chair opposite

his desk, exhausted.

A beat as he absorbs the information.

David nods.

David mouths a "thank you."

EXT. GALE HOUSE - DAY

A Century 21 real estate agent is putting a "For Sale" sign

in the front yard.

INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - DAY

David is having lunch with an IVY LEAGUE-LOOKING MALE in his

fifties. Only water and bread are on the table.

The Ivy Leaguer vigorously butters his bread.

He takes a bite of bread.

EXT./INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DAY

David stands on the balcony of a sparsely-furnished 420-a-

month apartment. Books are stacked everywhere. An Interstate

runs nearby. He holds a phone, looks down in the pool area.

DAVID'S POV

A horribly-tanned man in his seventies (wearing a Speedo)

attempts to do Tai Chi.

ON DAVID

David lets the PHONE BEEP, just stares down at the man, saying

nothing.

EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT - DAY

As David gets out of his Volvo, a SORORITY PLEDGE (funny

clothes, Greek letters on her cheek) quickly approaches.

She takes his picture with a Polaroid camera.

She runs to a waiting convertible, where two other girls

sit.

She jumps in the car and they speed away.

INT. HIGH-RISE OFFICE - DAY

The office is Philip Stark chic with large window walls --

Austin stretches into the distance. David sits on a sofa

across from an exceedingly ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (early 40s).

He's staring into space.

He looks at her. She forces a strained smile.

INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dark. David lies on the floor, his head propped against a

wall. He's in his underwear and drinking from a Black Bush

bottle. The phone's beside his ear and Chase's MESSAGE on

his wife's MACHINE TWEAKS out of the receiver speaker. After

the BEEP, David hangs up, gets a DIAL TONE, and punches re-

dial. The MESSAGE STARTS again.

After the BEEP, he hangs up, gets a DIAL TONE, and punches

re-dial.

INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY

David is in the office of an overdressed YUPPIE BLACK MAN

(early 20s). David is doing his active listening thing.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

David and Belyeu approach a ball fifty feet from the green.

David chooses a club.

David walks to the ball.

David looks at him, then concentrates on the ball -- suddenly

it has meaning. He swings. The ball lands in a water trap.

INT. PICTURESQUE MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

David's Volvo winds up the road, enters through a gate. A

sign beside the gate: "The Go lightly: A Recovery Clinic."

BLACK.

FADE IN:

EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - DAY

It's a beautiful day. The house looks much different than in

the Goth Girl's care -- flower bed, well-manicured lawn,

fresh paint. The "Block Home" sign is in the window. David's

Volvo pulls up in front.

INT./EXT. CONSTANCE'S FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

Constance opens the door for David. He's wearing a short

sleeved Radio Shack shirt and tie. She's taken aback.

Looks at him a beat, bites her lip, suppresses a laugh.

He plays hurt, then they both burst out laughing.

LONG SHOT - CONSTANCE AND DAVID

She hugs him as they laugh on the porch.

INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The living room is now Laura Ashley cozy. The sliding door

is open so the room's sunny, breezy. Constance leads David

in. She looks tired but is animated, a bit too much so. Her

hair is different.

She smiles at him maternally, touches his face. They hug

again.

She moves from him, takes a photo from a case file on her

kitchen table.

INSERT - PHOTO

of a young black women -- pleasant, timid.

BACK ON SCENE

She lifts a small plant, moves to the porch.

He notices she has bruises on her arms.

EXT. CONSTANCE'S PORCH

She sets the plant down among others. At the very back of

the yard, the Older Cowboy spades in a vegetable garden.

Constance looks at him a beat, sighs.

Contance sheepishly nods.

He kisses her on the forehead -- he's surprised.

EXT. STARBUCKS - NIGHT

David exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup-

container, tries to sip one without spilling the others.

He's still wearing the Radio Shack shirt, seems happier.

In the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his

Camero and moves toward the store. As David comes in front

of the car, he sees his former baby-sitter sitting in the

passenger seat. Their eyes meet. He smiles. She smiles back,

waves. As he passes, he hears the girl hit the car's automatic

DOOR-LOCK BUTTON.

INT. OFFICE OF DEATHWATCH (AUSTIN) - NIGHT

David enters carrying the coffee. The matron sits on a desk

licking envelopes. The college guy is on the floor beneath a

desk rewiring a computer terminal.

David goes to the Matron, gives her cup and three Sweet &

Lows.

He takes one of the unsealed envelopes from her stack, then

puts a cup beside the legs of the College Guy.

David makes his way to the back office. The College Guy gives

the Matron a look -- they're surprised, pleased.

INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY

Constance sits at a spartan desk. Nothing is on the walls,

though a window opens onto the alley behind. She's talking

on the SPEAKER PHONE with the DeathWatch national director --

a social gathering is going on behind him.

David comes through the door. She waves him in.

He sets her coffee in front of her. Then sits across from

her.

David holds up the envelope for Constance to see, then

animatedly licks and seals it. He then, literally, pats

himself on the back.

She smiles at him, shakes her head.

Constance hesitates, looks at David. He shakes his head no.

Constance is not sure how to react. David just stares at

her.

David stands up and leaves the room, quickly. His coffee

spills. Constance can only watch.

EXT. DEATHWATCH OFFICE (AUSTIN) - NIGHT

Constance comes anxiously out the front door.

CONSTANCE'S POV

David's Volvo pulls out of the parking lot.

BACK TO SCENE

She stands watching it drive away, breathing heavily. She

winces, grabs her stomach, vomits on the sidewalk.

EXT. AUSTIN STREET - NIGHT

The Volvo is parked on a seedy Southside street. David stands

at a phone booth and dials a long-distance number and a

calling code. He waits, impatiently, looks across the street:

There's a liquor store.

CLOSEUP - RECEIVER

at his ear, Chase's MESSAGE BEGINS.

BACK ON DAVID

He speaks into the PHONE after the BEEP.

David starts to put the receiver back, then suddenly starts

smashing it against the phone's body; he smashes it long

after there is anything left to destroy, long after his hand

bleeds.

EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NEXT DAY

Constance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward

her front porch. She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks.

David is sitting on the porch beneath the Block Home sign,

holding Cloud Dog. He wears the Yale sweatshirt, the Radio

Shack shirt is wrapped around his injured hand. He's sloppy

drunk.

She opens the door as he stands.

INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

David enters rambling, stands leaning against the back of

the couch, holding the sheep.

She's not in the room.

He looks back toward the entry hall. A small flyer lightly

blows along the floor into the living room.

He looks in the entry hall.

ENTRY HALL

Constance lies unconscious on the floor near the open door.

The mail is scattered about her.

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

David sleeps in a chair, on the floor beside him is a stack

of vending-machine coffee cups. A typical hospital INTERCOM

can be heard throughout the scene.

A female DOCTOR (mid-30s) sits beside him, lightly shakes

his shoulder. He wakes, groggy.

A beat as he collects himself, sits up.

A beat as the situation clarifies for both of them. David is

stunned, the doctor embarrassed.

They sit in silence. The hospital intercom seems to say:

CLOSEUP - DAVID

CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES.

WHITE.

INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - CLOSEUP - BITSEY - DAY

CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES. Bitsey stares at David, engrossed.

He stands, goes to the back of the cage to be handcuffed.

EXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY

The rental car sits in a corner of the mostly empty lot, as

far as possible from the razor-wire fence and exercise pens.

INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

Zack waits in the driver's seat, smoking. He looks nervously

through the windshield toward the pens. Bitsey raps on the

window, startling him.

Zack unlocks the door, throws his cigarette out. Bitsey opens

the door and gets in.

He STARTS the CAR.

EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY

The guardhouse is now occupied. The crossing guard is down.

Across the drive sits a Texas Highway Patrol car.

All along the drive's left side, protest vehicles are parked

in the grass. They stretch out to the two-lane highway, where

another Highway patrol car is stationed.

The drive's right side is also marked off, though the only

vehicle on this side is a Houston TV news truck. Six people

in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive.

The rental car ENTERS the FRAME.

INT. RENTAL CAR

Bitsey and Zack approach the guardhouse.

The guardhouse attendant looks in, waves them through as the

crossing guard lifts.

Standing among the six people in ponchos is Duke Grover.

They pass him in SLOW MOTION. He sees them, smiles, makes a

"Hello" shooting-gesture.

The next-to-last vehicle on the left is the Older Cowboy's

pickup. He sits inside talking with another man. The Older

Cowboy sees them, touches his hat as they pass.

EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

The rental car passes a farmhouse.

INT. RENTAL CAR

Bitsey and Zack are headed to Huntsville.

EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

The rental car passes a black teenager hitchhiking in front

of an abandoned vegetable stand.

EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DAY

Bitsey and Zack make their way to their rooms. Zack's is

first.

INT. ZACK'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - DAY

Zack unlocks his door, enters. The room's a mess, papers

everywhere. He walks toward a portable computer sitting on

the room desk.

Zack runs from the room.

EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DAY

Zack runs towards Bitsey. She stands outside her room.

As he comes to her door, he sees what she's indicating:

Between the door and its frame, someone has stuck a roll of

duct tape.

INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - DAY

Bitsey pushes the door open, looks in and around. She sees

something, enters. Zack enters behind her, sees what she

sees.

He goes. She approaches the middle of the room.

The room, in contrast to Zack's, is perfectly neat. It has

two twin beds. The nightstand has been moved to the center.

On it is a lamp, turned on. Suspended just above the lamp, a

VHS cartridge hangs from the ceiling by fishing line.

BITSEY'S BATHROOM

Zack checks behind the shower curtain.

BACK IN BEDROOM

As Zack enters, he sees Bitsey holding the VHS Cassette.

She holds up the cassette. It has a label typed from an old

typewriter: "For Bitsey Bloom."

EXT. MOTEL SIX RECEPTION - DUSK

Zack runs out the front door carrying a VCR, the cables drag

the ground behind him. He runs toward the rooms.

INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL ROOM - DUSK

Bitsey unlocks the door, lets Zack in.

He goes to the TV.

He starts to hook up the VCR.

He turns ON the TV.

She hands him the tape. He starts to put it in, hesitates,

looks back at her.

He puts it in, pushes play. She sits on the bed. He sits

beside her. They watch the black leader appear.

CLOSEUP - TV

An image flickers in. It's a woman lying nude on the kitchen

floor of house 3307, facing away from the camera.

An opaque white kitchen bag is over her head, sealed at the

neck with duct tape. Her hands are handcuffed behind her.

She appears dead.

BACK TO SCENE

They stare at the screen, she bites a thumbnail. He turns

the sound up.

INT. HOUSE 3307 - KITCHEN - DAY (ON TV)

Hi-8 video: The woman does not move. The kitchen is cleaner

than we've seen it, but otherwise unchanged.

Kitchen gloves can be seen -- laid upside down and inside

out -- on the dish rack beside the sink. Near the body on

the floor is a roll of duct tape. In the lower right corner

of the screen is part of what looks like a towel.

The audio is full of ATMOSPHERIC HUM. A REFRIGERATOR

contributes. BIRDS can barely be heard in the distance, so

can what sounds like a LAWN MOWER.

Suddenly, the woman makes a muffled sound, seems to come to

life. Her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs, then

jerk at them. She panics. He legs flail, kick against the

counter. She screams, muffled, frantic. She rolls onto her

stomach, her whole body fights against the cuffs. She

desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip

the plastic. Soon, her energy wanes, she jerks less. Her

covered face now points toward the camera. Her head seems to

rock, a sleepy nod. Her body goes slack. Black.

EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DUSK

Bitsey stands at the railing, looking out at the interstate

and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon.

After a few seconds, Zack comes up beside her.

A beat, she keeps looking straight on.

Bitsey takes a deep breath, turns to him, holds his eyes.

She shakes her head no. Her lips start to tremble. He puts

his arms around her as she starts to cry.

INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Bitsey and Zack sit at a booth having coffee. Zack smokes.

The VHS cassette is also between them, as is a small stack

of crumpled tissues. The thunderstorm can be heard in the

distance. The waitress is refilling their cups, and they

wait until she leaves. Hushed tones.

Bitsey gestures to the tape, makes a need-I-say-more face.

EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

The storm batters the motel. We see Bitsey's dark front

window. Lightning. A figure stands looking out. More

lightning. It's Bitsey, intently watching the night.

INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

SUPERIMPOSE: DAY THREE

On the back seat is an aluminum suitcase. Zack sits beside

it looking out the back window. Bitsey drives.

It's still raining, hard. They're on the two-lane highway to

Austin.

CLOSE ON DASH

The over-heat light is on.

BACK TO SCENE

ZACK'S POV

The cowboy's truck can be seen through the tire mist fifty

yards behind them.

Bitsey watches in the rearview mirror. Zack out the back

window.

Bitsey doesn't respond, just watches in the mirror, then:

INT. LAW OFFICE OF BENJAMIN BELYEU - DAY

The office has a view of the rain-soaked capital.

Expensively decorated. Dark woods and deep carpets --

Belyeu's practice is clearly thriving. A sharp-looking CLERK

sits at a corner table counting money from the aluminum

suitcase. Bitsey sits on a huge sofa. Belyeu stands just

outside his door.

He goes to his desk and starts sifting through papers.

The Clerk puts the last of the money back into the suitcase.

The Clerk exits.

A very professional-looking assistant enters, hands Bitsey

her video.

INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

Bitsey comes out of two huge oak doors, walks past a gold

"Belyeu and Crane" sign. She turns a corner.

At the end of another short hall, she comes to the elevator,

pushes the call button. As she waits, she looks out an

adjacent window at the capital in the rain. She remembers

something, looks down -- she has her purse but no umbrella.

She heads back toward Belyeu's office.

As she turns the corner, she sees the older cowboy enter the

Belyeu and Crane office.

EXT. AUSTIN OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Bitsey hurries umbrella-less through the rain to the rental

car parked in the loading zone.

INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

Bitsey opens the door. Zack's in the passenger seat. She

doesn't bother to sit.

Zack makes a face.

EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE - DAY

A taxi makes its way through the hundreds of protesters and

press that now gather along the drive.

INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY

Bitsey, wet and hugging herself, paces in front of David.

She's upset.

Over the loudspeaker:

She sits.

A beat. David looks up at the microphone.

TWO SHOT

Rotates.

WHITE.

EXT. ALLEY - MED. SHOT - DAVID - SUNRISE (ROTATING CAMERA)

David sits in a lawn chair beside his Volvo. The tailgate's

down, serving as a makeshift table for a coffee thermos and

whiskey bottle. David stares off down the alley, clearly in

pain. He holds a child's drawing.

INSERT - DRAWING

Has Gaudi's church and a matador in background. Prominent in

the foreground are three labeled figures: Sharon ("Mommy"),

Chase ("Me") and a dark-haired man ("Papa Jorge"). Jorge is

dressed in a tux, Sharon seems to wear a bridal gown.

INT. DEATHWATCH AUSTIN OFFICE - SUNRISE (6:09)

The atmosphere is tense. Dusty Wright sits on a deskholding

a red Magic Marker, the matron sits behind it.

They look at the college guy, who closely watches a computer

screen.

In the center of the room, a middle-aged priest sits and

quietly prays while holding the hands of an overweight woman,

she murmurs quiet affirmations.

Finally, the college guy looks up at Dusty, nods. The room's

occupants all exchange glances.

Dusty walks to the photo wall, marks a cross through the

photo of Jo Ann Johnson, then walks to the back office.

INT. BACK OFFICE - SUNRISE

Constance, wrapped in an afghan, sleeps on a futon. She's

shockingly anemic.

Dusty kneels beside her, watches her sleep. After a beat,

she wakes with a slight jolt -- like someone whose been

fighting to stay awake. She looks at him, then sees the marker

in his hand. She looks away.

Dusty stands, goes to the alley window.

DUSTY'S POV

David's Volvo is parked just outside the window. David sits

in a lawn chair behind it. David looks awful.

EXT. ALLEY - SUNRISE

In the window, Dusty holds up the marker. David nods.

EXT. HOUSE 3307 - CONSTANCE'S BACK YARD - DUSK

David sits on the porch holding a drink, a bottle of Black

Bush in the chair beside him. He's staring at nothing.

Constance comes out the open sliding glass door, wearing a

turtleneck sweater and wrapped in her afghan. She goes to

the chair beside him, picks up the bottle and sits. They

silently survey the yard, the sunset. She hugs the bottle,

he sips his drink.

A beat.

She reaches over and puts her hand on his arm.

She has the bottle in her other hand, looks at it, takes a

swig.

She puts the bottle down beside her chair.

Her hand (on his arm) holds up four fingers.

She laughs, coughs. He laughs. Their laughter trails off

into the yard. He takes her hand in his.

They are holding hands in the air, their elbows on the chairs'

armrests.

A beat. They watch their fingers lightly play with one

another.

They turn, their eyes meet, hold.

INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Constance and David are in bed making love. He's on top, one

hand supports her head, the other strokes her face.

They tenderly kiss. He starts moving, gently.

He kisses her neck.

Moves up to her ear.

He kisses her mouth, moves against her in delicate rhythm.

Her moans take on a teary edge. Their voices, breathless

whispers, meld into one another.

She's begun to cry.

He stops moving, kisses her tears.

He moves again, slowly.

EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NIGHT

The house is dark. A light in one of the rooms comes on.

INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - DAY

She's awake as David enters. He opens the curtains, sets a

glass of water beside bottles on the nightstand. He crawls

on top of the covers, spoons her, nuzzles the back of her

head.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE PARKING LOT - DAY

David goes to the pay phone against the building.

INT. CONSTANCE'S BATHROOM - DAY

Constance stands in a bathrobe beside her shower. Turns the

water on. She's caught in a thought, bites her lip.

She turns the water off.

EXT. APARTMENT POOL AREA - DAY

David sits in a lounger speaking to someone on his right.

He's sober.

A beat.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Dusty Wright sitting in the

lounger beside him.

INT. CONSTANCE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Constance, still in her robe, puts an armful of sheets in

the washing machine. She feels faint.

EXT. FORMER GALE HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

David sits in a swing set, rocks slowly. He's simply looking

at the house. A yuppie woman opens the back door.

INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Constance is quickly sorting through a box of memorabilia, a

photo catches her attention.

INSERT - PHOTO

Constance on vacation in a Caribbean resort. She sits alone

at a dinner table, looks to camera, seems surprised to be

photographed.

BACK ON SCENE

As Constance contemplates the photo, she hears the DOORBELL

ring.

EXT. LAWN - FROM ABOVE - DAY

We see David lying in the grass of recently-cut lawn.

INT. DAVID'S VOLVO - DUSK

David in the car in a mall parking lot, staring at nothing.

On the seat beside him is Cloud Dog and a half empty Black

Bush bottle.

INT. DAVID'S VOLVO - NIGHT

David's asleep, using Cloud Dog as a pillow. The bottle is

empty.

A light flashes in on him, waking him. There's a KNOCK on

the window -- it's the police. He's blinded by the flashlight.

POLICEMAN

INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - BITSEY AND DAVID - DAY

ROTATING CAMERA. Bitsey's agitated. David's drained.

The guard approaches.

A beat.

David moves to the back of the cage to be handcuffed.

The guard escorts him away. When he's out of earshot:

EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY

A guard hangs up a phone and leans out the door.

Bitsey stands in the rain. Behind her, hundreds of protesters

flank the drive.

She turns and walks toward the highway.

The parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers.

The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists:

They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint

signs ("Don't kill with my taxes!", "Mark 6:10," "Murder

doesn't Stop Murder!"). Beneath one umbrella stands a large

black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey.

The right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penalty

activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs:

"Rape and Suffocate Him!", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'Let's

Do it'." A blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours."

At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign

leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale." It catches rain;

its letters run.

INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The restaurant's crowded. A Church of Christ couple (50s)

eat without comment. The man's T-shirt reads, "It's Simple:

You Kill, You Get Killed."

In the booth beside them sit Bitsey and Zack, their dinners

largely untouched. Bitsey watches three sleazy JOURNALISTS

at a table not far from theirs.

They find this hilarious. Bitsey looks away.

A beat.

EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Pouring rain. As Bitsey and Zack hurry toward their rooms,

they see Belyeu getting out of his Cadillac. He carries

Bitsey's umbrella and opens his own.

He turns, comes toward them. Bitsey holds a newspaper over

her head, Zack slouches.

She nods.

They turn from one another. Bitsey turns back.

He turns.

Bitsey nods.

INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT

Dark. Bitsey and Zack sit on either side of the room's table

looking out the window. Rain shadows run down their faces.

The room phone is on the table, as is Zack's watch: 10:17.

EXT. MOTEL SIX AND KETTLE - LONG SHOT - FROM ACROSS

INTERSTATE - NIGHT

The rain's lightened up. The motel's full. Lights are on in

ten of the motel rooms. The Kettle's lights go off, one after

another.

INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT

Zack sleeps at the end of one bed, fully dressed. Bitsey,

lost in agitated thought, neatly packs a suit into her

perfectly arranged suitcase. She stops, thinks. She goes to

her purse and takes out the VHS cassette, a pen and a note

pad. Hesitating a beat, she puts the tape in the VCR. She

turns on the TV and waits for an image.

EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

Rain. All the rooms except Bitsey's are dark. From within

comes a TV glow.

INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - INSERT - BITSEY'S

NOTEPAD - NIGHT

She's sketched a flow-chart of the tape with major elements

timed out.

BITSEY

has her shoes off, sits on the floor with her back against a

bed. She's still watching the tape, tired, exasperated.

Finally, she turns the TV OFF, rubs her eyes. She stands,

looks at the radio alarm clock on the nightstand: 11:33.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Bitsey brushes her teeth. Looks down and sees a towel on the

floor. Picks it up, starts to hang it on the towel rack,

stops, looks at herself in the mirror. A beat. An idea hits

her, first as something odd, then as a freight train. She

spits, hurries into the bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

He starts to pull himself awake.

She disconnects the VCR.

She has the VCR. Grabs her purse on the way to the door.

She opens the door, exits.

INT. HOUSE 3307 ENTRY HALL - NIGHT

The DOORBELL RINGS over BAUHAUS MUSIC. The Goth Girl, wearing

only the Nine Inch Nails T-shirt, opens the door.

Bitsey barrages past carrying the VCR, Zack follows with the

TV.

INT. HOUSE 3307 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bitsey, Zack and the Goth girl enter.

Bitsey checks the kitchen. The tripod's back. The other

exhibit pieces haven't changed.

She starts to leave, turns back.

Bitsey, moaning, reaches for her purse.

CLOSEUP - STEREO CLOCK

reads 1:48. Zack's hand ENTERS the FRAME, turns the MUSIC

DOWN.

SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

Video: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen. Camera zooms in to a

perspective similar to that on the Constance tape. The exhibit

pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or-

less where they were before. The Goth Girl enters the frame,

she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter.

She picks up the index cards.

Zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. The camera is

on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's TV. Near it, the

hotel TV/VCR. Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning,

freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on the

Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by-

side.

He does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left TV

(Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance).

Zack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter

as an ersatz dish rack -- he drapes the kitchen gloves over

them.

He does so.

Zack repositions the tape. The Goth Girl picks up the

handcuffs.

Zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the TVs. NICO sits

on the floor, starts to take off her T-shirt.

He goes to Nico, arranges her in the position of Constance

(which now bears no relation to the white outline on the

floor).

Zack comes back behind the tripod. He and Bitsey look at the

two TV images -- roughly the same. The Constance tape,

however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower

right-hand corner. Bitsey points to it.

She plays the tape of Constance for eight seconds.

Bitsey touches the TV screen by one of Constance's feet.

The foot moves ever so slightly. She hits pause.

Bitsey looks up at Nico.

SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

Nico hurries from the bedroom into the kitchen. Bitsey and

Zack stand by the sink. A white plastic bag is now on the

sink counter; beside it, the roll of duct tape.

Nico hands Zack the key to the handcuffs. He tests them,

then lays them on the counter.

Zack and Nico move behind the tripod. Bitsey puts the bag on

her head, rips off a long length of tape. She seals the bag

around her neck. She then handcuffs herself from behind,

with some difficulty.

CLOSEUP - KEY

is on the sink counter while she does this.

BACK TO SCENE

Bitsey sits on the linoleum, then lies on her side.

Bitsey lies perfectly still.

Bitsey starts to pull slightly at the cuffs.

Bitsey panics, fights like hell against the cuffs.

Zack runs to her, knocking the tripod over. He rips the bag

open. She sucks air.

She tries to catch her breath. Nico releases the handcuffs.

Bitsey nods, holds up her hand, wants to say something.

She takes his arm, looks at him.

SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

Zack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking.

Nico sits on one of its armrests. Bitsey, full of adrenaline,

paces in front of them, thinking out loud.

A beat. Bitsey contemplates.

They stare at each other a beat. The same thought:

INT. DUSTY WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT

Dusty looks up at a wall clock: 4:23. He sits fully dressed

in his living room, listening to an OPERA. He closes his

eyes.

CAMERA PULLS BACK OUT of his window and into:

EXT. WOODS BESIDE WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT

Behind a couple of trees near the woods' edge, Bitsey and

Zack hide watching him.

She turns back into the woods.

EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Bitsey and Zack emerge from the woods near the rental car.

They walk and speak quickly in the light rain.

They come to the car, get in.

INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

Bitsey drives.

INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT

The wall clock: 4:50. Dusty hears the PHONE RING over a

BARITONE'S ARIA. He turns the MUSIC DOWN, and picks up.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

The gas station is old, isolated on a country road.

Closed, dark. By the road, a single light pole illuminates

the area -- its light catching the drizzle.

Directly beneath the pole is a phone booth, where Bitsey

waits by the rental car.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

Zack is on the phone with the booth door open. Bitsey stands

just outside.

Zack hangs up before Dusty can respond. He stops out of the

booth and gives Bitsey a tentative look.

INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT

Dusty hangs up, thinks.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

Bitsey sits in the car's driver seat. Zack stands by the

booth.

EXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

Bitsey is in the woods, watches Dusty pull away in the pickup.

She hurries to the front door, enters.

INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

Bitsey turns on the lights and begins searching. She sees 11

videos on a bookshelf. Some are labeled, three aren't.

She takes the cassettes to the TV/VCR. Puts one in (her hands

are wet). Nothing. She searches for the right AV channel.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

Zack anxiously waits. His eyes check the road.

INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

Bitsey has a picture, but the tape is an old TV western.

She starts to fast forward, realizes she won't be able to do

so with each tape, hits eject. She checks the clock: 5:04.

She takes another unlabeled tape. It's a home video of a

city council meeting.

She grabs the next unlabeled tape.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

Zack paces in front of the booth, checks his watch.

INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

Bitsey has an old "I Love Lucy" episode. Ejects, looks at

the label: "Lucy." She grabs another, labeled "Unforgiven."

The credits from Unforgiven roll on screen.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

Zack sees lights coming toward him. Gets into the phone booth,

drops two coins, dials six numbers. He hesitates to punch

the seventh, checks the road. The approaching lights belong

to a car. He quickly hangs up.

INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

Bitsey is frantic. Another tape is an old Johnny Carson

interview with Pavarotti.

She reaches for another.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

Zack hugs himself in the waning drizzle.

INT. WRIGHT CABIN

Bitsey has what looks like an office Christmas party. She

goes for another tape -- the last. Cheyenne Autumn comes up

on the screen. She hits eject.

She gets up, unsure what to do next. She goes back to the

bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes,

indifferent to the mess. She goes to a filing cabinet, quickly

rifles it. She looks around the room, sees something.

She goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it.

After the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer.

It's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to

"Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40 W. 43rd St./New York, New

York 10036." A beat as she stares in disbelief. She rips it

open, pulls out a VHS cassette and checks the label:

"Constance." The PHONE RINGS, startling her. She looks at

the phone, then at the clock: 5:14. The phone doesn't ring

again. A beat of absolute silence.

Bitsey goes quickly to the VCR and puts in the tape -- hands

shaking. After a few seconds, Constance appears standing in

her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe. She's wearing

the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water.

ON VIDEO

Constance turns from the sink:

The response is silent, but she nods. A beat -- she bites

her lower lip. In one quick movement she takes the key from

the handcuffs and swallows it with the water. It goes down

with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay. She

puts the glass in the sink.

She takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks

one end to the back of her gloved hand. She tears off another

small section, drops the roll on the floor.

She tapes the small section over her mouth.

She then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it

a beat. Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes

watering. She nods once, and turns back. She quickly puts

the bag over her head. After she has smoothed the excess air

out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other.

She seals the bag around her neck.

She smoothly takes off the gloves. They're inside out and

she snaps them so that the fingers extend. She drops them

upside down on the dish rack. She removes her robe -- she's

nude beneath -- and tosses it aside. It lands in the bottom

right hand corner of the screen.

She feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them.

She sits on the floor, cuffs herself. She rolls onto her

side, perfectly still, waiting.

ON BITSEY

Engrossed, trembling. The spell breaks as she comes to the

part of the tape she's seen before. Averting her eyes, she

fast-forwards past where Constance struggles to where she

dies. Constance lies perfectly still. A beat.

VIDEO

A man wearing gloves walks into the frame: Dusty.

ON BITSEY

This is what she's needed.

VIDEO

Dusty goes to Constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks

her pulse. He looks briefly up into the camera, then stands.

He picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod. A beat.

We see only Constance's dead body -- then black.

ON BITSEY

A hand grabs her shoulder. She screams and spins around.

It's Zack, breathing hard.

Bitsey hits the eject button.

EXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT

Bitsey and Zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods.

The pickup is nowhere to be seen.

As they disappear into the trees, Dusty can be seen standing

beneath the eave at the side of the house, watching.

EXT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE

The car moves full speed through the misty dawn. The drizzle

has stopped.

INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

Bitsey drives. The overheat light is on. Zack has her purse

in his lap, rips a page out of her phone book.

She's almost in tears, yelling.

EXT. INTERSTATE - IN FRONT OF MOTEL SIX - SUNRISE

The rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate

shoulder. Zack jumps out, as Bitsey spins away again. He

runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist.

EXT. HUNTSVILLE TOWN SQUARE - SUNRISE

The rental car barrels through the empty square, ignoring

stop signs.

EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE

The rental car flies past a "Huntsville City Limit" sign and

disappears into the fog.

INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE

The overheat light is still on. Bitsey looks down, then turns

on the RADIO. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN SONG is on.

She punches scan.

EXT. HIGHWAY JUNCTION - SUNRISE

The highway forks off to another. An arrow sign at the fork

reads: "TDC Ellis Unit/8 Miles."

INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE

Bitsey smells something.

EXT. HIGHWAY TO ELLIS UNIT - SUNRISE

The rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a

dead roll, stops. Bitsey jumps out, VHS cassette in hand.

She doesn't close the door. Starts running.

Bitsey runs down the middle of the two-lane highway. The

rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist -- visibility

is no more than fifty yards. The sounds of her breathing and

SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist.

She runs, and runs.

A car comes up quickly behind her. Its HORN BLARES. She turns,

starts to wave it down. The driver SITS ON his HORN, swerves

around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on.

She runs. Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. Runs past

a sleepy farmhouse.

She runs, and runs.

She slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway.

Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a

tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.

She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

Coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights.

They rise on hill and then fall behind another.

They appear again. Soon, she can make out the form of an

ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. The vehicles move

slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their

cargo. She stands to the side of the road as they approach.

The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked "Texas

Department of Corrections" -- pass silently in SLOW MOTION.

She watches as they disappear back into the mist. In SLOW

MOTION, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot

hear her. We HEAR NOTHING.

INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - SUNRISE

In the b.g., Dusty walks out the front door carrying two

large suitcases. On his desk in the f.g. is a radiator cap.

Dusty walks along the Ramblan. He carries a duty-free bag

and the aluminum suitcase. He comes to a building, checks

its number against a piece of paper, enters.

INT. BARCELONA APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

Dusty ascends a staircase onto hallway. He walks a few steps

to door number six. An OLD SPANISH WOMAN passes him.

The old woman moves down the stairs. Dusty puts the aluminum

suitcase on the doormat. From the duty-free bag he takes out

David's Yale sweatshirt, lays it over the case. He RINGS the

DOORBELL, turns and walks back down the hall.

He stands at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone to

answer before descending. Sharon (older than we've seen her)

opens the door, sees the case and sweatshirt. She looks

around, but Dusty is gone. She picks them up.

INT. NEWS MAGAZINE - EDITORIAL FLOOR - DAY

Bitsey sits at her neurotically neat desk, looking out the

window. It's a sunny day in New York. For the first time, we

see her wearing something besides a business suit. Framed on

her cubicle wall is the latest News cover page: a picture of

David with the headline "The Executed Innocent."

A MAIL GUY drops a Fed Ex package on her desk.

It's from "Belyeu & Crane/420 Congress Ave./Austin, Texas,

78710." She opens it, pulls out Cloud Dog and a handwritten

note on Belyeu & Crane stationery.

INSERT - NOTE

reads: "David wanted you to have this. He said it would be

the key to your freedom. Regards, Benjamin Belyeu."

INT. SHARON'S BARCELONA APARTMENT - DAY

unsigned note: "I'm sorrier than you can know."

INT. NEWS MAGAZINE - EDITORIAL FLOOR - DAY

Bitsey holds the stuffed sheep. puzzled.

Looks at the note,

Suddenly, she understands. She squeezes the sheep, shakes

it, hears something. She cuts the sheep open with scissors.

A Hi-8 tape is in the stuffing. It's hand labeled: "Off the

record." She jumps up.

TRACKING SHOT

Bitsey hurries THROUGH the cubicles. She goes DOWN a hall

Bitsey locks the door, puts the tape into a Hi-8 deck.

The tape is cued to where Dusty picks up Constance's robe

and walks past the tripod out of frame. We see only

Constance's body. We hear the sliding door to the patio open

behind the camera.

A long beat. FOOTSTEPS on the patio.

David walks into frame. He goes a couple of steps toward

Constance's body and stops, facing her. We see him only from

behind. He looks at her, runs his hands over his head.

A beat.

A beat.

David goes to Constance, kneels. He reaches down and with

his thumb gently strokes her face through the plastic. He

stands, turns and walks back to the camera. He reaches behind

the lens to turn it off. A beat. Half his face fills frame,

his watery eyes looking directly at us. In the other half,

we see Constance's body.

Black.
