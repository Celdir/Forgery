FADE IN:

EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)

Dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage. A pillar of

steam rises from an underground grate. It's the dark

place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids.

We see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable

suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the

surroundings-- At first glance, you'd think he could run

for Congress some day.  At first glance.

Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution

style. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling

in a strawberry field.

There's the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE "CLICK" of a gun being

cocked. The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake's

ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull.

The voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40's). With his

suit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a

"Steve" or "Roger" more than a "Butch".

CONTINUED:

EXT . - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT

Title: Three Weeks Ago...

The same alley... The door of a building bursts open as

LIONEL DOLBY (late 40's), dressed in a cheap suit, stumbles

out breathing heavy. The dim light of a bare bulb glares

off the sweat on his forehead.

A moment later, Jake emerges from the same door carrying

a large black revolver.

Lionel starts shaking his head spastically.

In the distance, A POLICE SIREN WAILS, growing louder.

Jake takes a tentative step forward.     Lionel sees a BLOOD

STAIN on Jake's shirt and recoils.

The SIREN GROWS LOUDER, Jake turning his head towards it.

CONTINUED:

Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of.

INT. - THE EUCLID BAR

A dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar.

A single overweight PATRON sits at a corner table with

face buried in his hands as he WHIMPERS. Jake and, Lionel

Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway.

MILES, late 20's, wipes blood off the bar. Placed at the

edge of the bar are two briefcases, both open, both filled

with neat stacks of blood splattered money.

A DEAD GUY lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood.

Jake grabs the Dead Guy's legs as Lionel watches in

disbelief.

Lionel stands frozen.       Jake, drops the dead guy's legs

with a THUD.

The POLICE SIRENS grow LOUDER.

CONTINUED:

Miles lets out a little chuckle; it's just enough to set

Jake off again.

Jake pulls the gun and points it at Miles.

Miles non-chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under

the bar.

The POLICE SIRENS sound like they're right outside.

Jake cocks his gun, never taking his stare off Miles.

Lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money.

Lionel again looks at the briefcases; then the shotgun

leveled at Jake; then at the direction of the POLICE

SIRENS... He runs for the door without a second thought.

EXT.- THE EUCLID/CITY SIDEWALK- NIGHT

Lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar

to street-level just as a POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a halt

in front of the bar, lights flashing, SIREN WAILING. On

the door is the emblem for the NEW YORK POLICE

DEPARTMENT.

Lionel does his best to look casual as TWO UNIFORMED

OFFICERS jump out of the car and rush the Euclid. One of

the Officers catches Lionel looking over his shoulder.

The last thing Lionel hears before he turns a corner--

As soon as he's turned the corner, Lionel breaks into a

full sprint down the street.

INT.- THE EUCLID

OFFICER WALTER SOBOZINSKI, a middle aged cop with a couple

of spare tires, stands by the front door with his gun

drawn, in a dramatic stance.

The second middle aged cop, OFFICER RICHARD ROTTOVICH

comes calmly down the stairs behind Sobozinski.

Rottovich closes the door and locks it behind him.

Sobozinski lets out a bellowing LAUGH.

We PAN OVER TO REVEAL Jake, Miles and BIG AL (the Patron)

sitting at the bar by the Dead Guy.

CONTINUED:

The Dead Guy stirs-- GORDO, late 20's, dressed in a blood

soaked suit stands up; wiping blood off his face.

Jake tosses the revolver on the bar.

Jake starts taking    the money out of the briefcases. Gordo

strips out of the    jacket and shirt, revealing a THIN WHITE

VEST. A wire runs     from a battery pack on his belt, up

the center of the    vest, ending at a scorched, bloody,

explosive squib.

Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing

fake blood. A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot

where the squib was.

Jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the

pile.

CONTINUED:

Big Al moves over to the bar.

Al slaps Jake on the back and exits.

Jake catches Gordo hawking over his shoulder.

Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway.

CONTINUED:

Jake rubber bands two small wads of cash and hands them

to Rottovich and Sobozinski.

Sobozinski and Rottovich head for the door with their

newly padded pockets.

CONTINUED:

Sobozinski and Rottovich exit.

EXT. BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)

Butch shaking his head, still holding the gun.

INT.- FOUR SEASONS HOTEL- NIGHT

A suite in the upscale hotel. Miles answers a KNOCK on

the door-- An expensive CALL GIRL stands at the door in

an overcoat.

She lets the overcoat fall open, revealing her lack of

clothing.

INT.- PRADA STORE- NIGHT

Gordo stands in front of a mirror trying on a new suit.

The sales people fawn over him.

CONTINUED:

INT.- BIG AL'S APARTMENT- NIGHT

Big Al has a cordless phone to his ear...

Big Al picks up a CHINESE TAKE-OUT MENU and leafs through

it while on the phone.

EXT.- SOHO STREET- NIGHT

Jake walks down the crowded street, passing the bars and

restaurants of SoHo. His jacket's buttoned up to hide

the blood stains.

Jake passes a group of well-dressed, well manicured people

waiting in line outside of a trendy bar called "Wax."

Among the hip and well dressed, he seems out of place at

the moment. An outsider.

An attractive blonde in her late twenties, LILY, bumps

into Jake.

She throws Jake a smile he can't but help return. They

stand for a second facing each other before she's whisked

away by an OLDER MAN, dressed in an expensive suit.

CONTINUED:

Jake's smile fades as he watches her saunter into the

bar, but not before she throws him another glance over

her shoulder. Jake continues on into...

INT.- NEIGHBORHOOD BAR- CONTINUOUS

A semi-crowded bar.    Not hip and trendy like "Wax."

Jake finds an empty stool at the end of the bar and orders

a drink. He takes a second to look around at the cliques

of people talking, laughing, having a good time before he

pulls a newspaper out his coat pocket.

Jake takes a pen from the bar and opens to the crossword

section.

Jake sits alone with his crossword puzzle.

INT.- JAKE'S APARTMENT- LATER

Jake enters a sparsely furnished loft. The skyline of

Brooklyn twinkles through dirty, picturesque windows.

Jake drops his keys on a table and hits a button on an

answering machine.

Jake stands his sparse little world, addressing the quiet

before he fishes for his wallet, which he can't find.

CONTINUED:

The realization makes Jake smile.

Then a FLAPPING SOUND spins him around to see a PIGEON,

flapping up against the inside of a partially opened

window.

Visibly upset by the bird, Jake moves towards the window

and pushes it wide, allowing the bird to escape.

Jake stares out the window after the bird.

INT.- DOLBY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT

A nicer apartment than Jake's. Lionel Dolby, the Mark

from the Euclid rushes around, haphazardly throwing

things into a suitcase. There's a KNOCK on the door that

stops Lionel dead in his tracks.

Another KNOCK.       Lionel still frozen.

The door flies open with a      BOOM. In the doorway, we see

HARLIN, an older mountain      of a man dressed in a plain

black suit. Behind him is       LUPUS (late-20's), dressed in

a sweatsuit a pilot could      spot from 20,000ft.

INT . - JAKE'S APARTMENT- MORNING

A RINGING PHONE... Jake stirs on the futon oddly placed

on the floor in the middle of the room and picks up the

phone.

CONTINUED:

Miles hangs up before Jake can answer.

INT.- BIG AL'S- DAY

Jake stand's with Miles in the sparse living room. Big

AI's body sits reclining on a Lazy Boy chair, eyes bulging

open. An open carton of food rests in his lap. A feast

of take-out Chinese surrounds him. The TV blares an old

episode of "The Little Rascals."

There's a singed, neat bullet hole in his forehead.

Big Al stares up at them with those bulging, vacant eyes,

his mouth hanging open. Jake reaches down and grabs the

remote control and turns the TV off.

INT.- DINER- DAY

Gordo enters and takes a seat in the back booth with Jake

and Miles.

They just pulled him out of the East River.

CONTINUED:

Gordo throws Jake a hard look, letting the news sink in.

Jake can only slump back into the booth.

Gordo looks to Jake, but can see that he's still processing

the information.

CONTINUED:

INSERT SHOT

INT- BIG AL'S APARTMENT- NIGHT

Big Al sits on the Lazy Boy, about to take a big bite of

egg foo young. He stops as the front door is kicked open

with a CRASH.

Big Al's eyes grow huge as we hear a LOUD BALM!!!

BACK TO THE DINER

All three of them turn their attention out the window.

They watch the bustle of people walking past wondering if

any one of them is looking back.

Gordo and Miles exchange a look, unsure of how to

respond.

CONTINUED:

A WAITRESS approaches.

Jake turns his attention out the window.

EXT. - THE EUCLID-- DAY

A basement bar in a crummy neighborhood. There's no sign,

but everything about it says, "Condemned."

INT.- THE EUCLID- DAY

Jake, Miles and Gordo sit at the bar of the run down

watering hole. Jake stands placing neat stacks of money

into a Fed-Ex box.

Gordo and Miles start unloading the same neat stacks of

money from their pockets. It's not as much as Jake put

in.

Shaking his head, Jake seals the Fed--Ex box, then hands

the form to Miles and. Picks up the phone.

Jake hangs up the phone.

Jake levels a stare at Gordo for a second.

CONTINUED:

Jake picks up the phone and dials another number.

EXT.- THE BULLDOG GYM- NIGHT

A neon sign in the shape of a boxing glove tells you what

kind of gym it is.

A police car comes to a stop in front. Rottovich and

Sobozinski in the front seats. Jake gets out of the back.

Jake nods and approaches the door where Harlin and Lupus

stand vigil. Lupus wears another loud sweatsuit.

Jake takes a step towards the door, but is pushed up

against The wall by Lupus who begins to roughly pat Jake

down.

Harlin shakes his head and pushes Lupus out of the way.

CONTINUED:

Jake steps back and raises his arms.

Harlin gives the Officers Sobozinski and Rottovich a slight

nod of acknowledgment.

INT.- BULLDOG GYM- CONTINUOUS

Harlin and Lupus lead Jake through the cavernous gym.

All around them, huge, sweaty, boxers work the speed bag,

jump rope, spar, etc... There's not one that doesn't look

like he's spent some time in the State Penal Boxing League.

Jake nods and let's out a silent sigh of relief.

INT.- STEAM BATH- CONTINUOUS

A huge room filled with steam. Harlin and Lupus stand by

the door as Jake cautiously steps in. NEW AGE MUSIC is

being played-- Could be Yanni.

Sitting in a lounge chair, wearing a white terry cloth

robe is THE KING PIN. His large body is less fat than

just big, constructed of circles and topped off with the

baldest head you've ever seen.

A MANICURIST sits next to the King Pin working on his

nails.

CONTINUED:

This isn't so bad.     Jake almost has to stifle a laugh.

Jake nods and the King motions for the manicurist to

leave.

Jake visibly bristles...

CONTINUED:

The King picks up a long, metal nail file.

CONTINUED:

The King Pin stands up and moves over to Jake.

With surprising speed, the King Pin grabs Jake by the

neck.

A few pained CHOKES from Jake as his knees buckle.

The King loosens his grip and let's Jake fall.

Lupus snaps to attention.

Jake begins to speak, but is silenced with a look.

CONTINUED:

The King picks up the nail file again.

Jake turns to find Lupus and Harlin on either side of

him. They take him by the wrists and hold his hands up

for the King.

The King begins to gently trace between Jake's fingers

with the nail file.

Jake remains rigid against Lupus and Harlin as the nail

file scrapes along the soft, fleshy webbing between his

fingers.

Jake shuts his eyes... Then opens them to find the King

now gently stroking his hands-- Almost a loving caress.

The King continues to stroke Jake's hands with his own

meaty paws.

EXT. BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)

Jake shakes his head slowly.

CONTINUED:

INT. - SQUAD CAR- NIGHT

Rottovich and Sobozinski sit staked out in front of a

small cigar/magazine store.

A hooded figure turns a corner onto the street, heading

for the Cigar Shop. He wears a knapsack slung over his

shoulders.

CONTINUED:

INT.- ANOTHER CAR- SAME

Parked across the street and well hidden among the other

parked cars... SPECIAL AGENT GUNTHER MOONAN, a guy in his

early 40's in the kind of suit you'd find on a "2--for-1"

rack. He sits pointing a TELESCOPE MICROPHONE out the

window, wearing headphones. He chews on gum loudly.

We HEAR the SOUNDS OF CAR DOORS OPENING, then SLAMMING

SHUT.

Moonan puts down the mic and hits "STOP" on a microcassette

recorder.

Moonan takes a second to remove his gum, then checks his

teeth in the rearview mirror.

EXT.- STREET/BROOKLYN- SAME

Rottovich and Sobozinski walk quickly down the street.

Ahead of them, the hooded figure approaches, his hands

buried in his pockets, a knapsack slung over his shoulder.

As he gets closer, we see that he's just a KID of about

ten or eleven.

Rottovich reaches over and pulls off the Kid's hood.

CONTINUED:

Rottovich can't help smiling.

The Kid jumps back startled and throws his hands up.       The

cops share a laugh.

The Kid hesitates for a second before handing the knapsack

over. Rottovich opens it and pulls out TWO BRICKS OF

HEROIN, wrapped in plastic. He nods to Sobozinski.

The Kid stays rooted right where he is, looking up at the

Detectives like a lost puppy.

Sobozinski fishes in his pocket starts to peel off bills

for the kid who then sprints away.

Rottovich and Sobozinski head off with the knapsack.

EXT. - BACK-NIGHT (PRESENT)

Butch and Jake...

CONTINUED:

Butch shoves the gun a little harder into Jake's head.

INT.- BAR- NIGHT

A trendy bar, dimly lit and packed. We PAN along the hip

crowd and STOP on Jake speaking with a SLICK GUY dressed

in black Armani.

Jake buys another round to the indifferent Slick.

THE SCENE DOESN'T CHANGE--- Slick MORPHS into a FAT TEXAS

BUSINESS MAN wearing a ten-gallon hat. He doesn't smile.

The Fat Texan MORPHS into a WALL STREET-type suit, who

remains stoic as Jake reaches over for another round of

drinks.

CONTINUED:

Wall Street MORPHS into a THIN EURO-TRASH man who takes a

drink from Jake without even a "thanks."

Euro-Trash MORPHS into an distinguished looking OLDER MAN

as he takes a sip.

Jake punctuates some unheard point with a slap on his

knee.

Jake looks up as the OLDER MAN MORPHS into LIONEL DOLBY,

the nervous mark from the earlier con.

CLOSE-UP: Dolby's lips loosen in a wide SMILE.

Jake smiles back. He puts his drink down, then takes the

drink from Dolby. They remain talking as THE BACKGROUND--

EXT. - SIDEWALK-NIGHT

Under the light of a streetlamp, the two continue to

talk.

CONTINUED:

Gordo approaches, dressed in a suit and looking slightly

anxious. Introductions are made.

Gordo pulls an envelope out of his coat and gives it to

Dolby.

Jake speaks quickly to Dolby who nods emphatically.    He

hands the envelope back to Gordo.

INT. - JAKE'S APARTMENT- NIGHT

Jake stands TALKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA, loading a big,

black revolver with bullets.

Jake spins the gun cylinder then SLAPS it closed, pointing

it straight at the CAMERA.

BLAM!!!

INT. - THE EUGLID BAR- NIGHT

A flash of Gordo's stunned face before his chest EXPLODES

IN RED.

Jake stands holding the smoking gun.   Dolby looks around

in shock.

Gordo lying in a pool of blood...

Big Al sits cowering at a table...

Miles casually washing glasses...

Dolby turns to Jake, eyes wide, lips trembling in fear.

CONTINUED:

Dolby eyes the briefcases of money.

Jake stops for a second and listens... He points over his

shoulder and on cue A POLICE SIREN WAILS in the distance.

Dolby bolts for the door without the money.

EXT.- SIDEWALK- CONTINUOUS

Dolby tries to act casual as he walks away.

INT. - THE EUCLID BAR- CONTINUOUS

Rottovich and Sabozinski enter the front door.

EXT - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)

INT.- JAKE'S APARPMENT--NIGHT

Empty except for Gordo, Miles, Jake and Lupus, dressed in

another of his trademark loud sweatsuits.

INT . - WAX--NIGHT

A crowded night...

LILY, the attractive blonde from earlier, flirts with a

well dressed, OLDER MAN who has his hand firmly planted

on her ass. She squeezes his hand and gives him a quick

peck on the cheek before walking away. She takes a look

at the man's wallet she just lifted before putting it in

her bag.

From out of nowhere, Jake bumps into her.

CONTINUED:

Jake takes her by the arm out to...

EXT.- ALLEY/OUTSIDE BAR- NIGHT

Jake pushes Lily through the back door where she finds

Gordo, Miles and Lupus waiting. Her once flirtatious

demeanor is replaced by something harder.

Jake takes her bag and dumps the contents on the floor--

A few wallets, a watch, even a wedding ring. Jake picks

up one of the wallets filled with cash.

Lily scoops up her bag and finds a cigarette, eyeing them

all suspiciously.

Lily takes a second to look the guys over. Miles gives

her a wink. Lily slowly raises her middle finger at him.

Lily saunters to Jake with a seductive grin.

Jake may be aware that he's stopped breathing.

She puts her hands on Jake's chest and leans in a half

inch more, her lips an eyelash away from his. She

whispers...

Lily pushes past Jake and heads out of the alley.

Gordo gives Jake a nod of approval and Jake takes off

after Lily.

EXT.- CITY SIDEWALK- NIGHT

Lily down the street, Jake giving chase.

Jake catches up and blocks Lily's way.

Lily studies Jake's face for any hint of sarcasm.      None.

Lily steps back and hails a cab.

She points to a large digital clock hanging in a store

window reading "11:11p".

CONTINUED:

Lily hops into the Cab and tosses Jake's new wallet onto

the sidewalk.

The cab pulls away.

Jake looks up at the clock-- "11:12P".

EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)

A circle of BUSINESS MEN sitting at a conference table.

CONTINUED:

We PAN AROUND THE TABLE OF BUSINESS MEN and settle on

MORGAN GILLETTE, a man in his early fifties with the

sharp, angular features of a reptile. We STAY with

Morgan as the meeting breaks and everyone heads for the

door and into...

INT. - CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN/HALLWAY-DAY

Gillette is greeted by a handful of SUITS.       Butch is with

them, staying in the periphery.

Gillette and his crew head through a large glass revolving

door to...

EXT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN- DAY

A busy mid-day New York sidewalk.       Gillette heads towards

a waiting Town Car.

As Gillette and his crew disappear into the car, we PAN

up to see the front of the building which has a large

sign reading, "City Bank of Manhattan; A Gillette Family

Company."

INT.- THE EUCLID-- RESUMING

Jake looks over the crew, who are less than convinced.

Miles lets out a whistle.

CONTINUED:

Jake looks over at Lupus for confirmation.

INT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN/LOBBY

Empty. The marble floor spotless, the dark oak teller

windows vacant, a row of desks.

A lone man, GRANT ASHBY, MATERIALIZES behind a desk on

the empty floor and sits behind a computer terminal.

CONTINUED:

An envelope stuffed with cash MATERIALIZES on the desk

next to Ashby.

EXT . -- CAYMEN ISLANDS--DAY

Crystal clear water gently rolls onto a white beach.

INT.- GRAND CAYMEN'S BANK- DAY

Another empty bank... A lone TELLER MATERIALIZES behind

the counter.

Jake MATERIALIZES on the empty bank floor, walking

confidently up to the Teller with a SILVER BRIEFCASE in

hand.

Jake approaches the Teller, now wheeling a BLACK SUITCASE

behind him by the handle.

Jake presents the Teller with a series of papers and a

photo I.D.

CONTINUED:

The Teller turns to a computer printer and removes a

check. Jake signs a few documents and places the check

into his pocket.

EXT.- CAYMEN ISLANDS/STREET--DAY

Lined with shops and stores, but it's as empty as the

bank. Not even a car: Jake strides out of the Grand

Caymen's Bank and walks across the street to another

building with a sign reading "BANK OF THE GRAND CAYMENS."

INT.- BANK OF THE GRAND CAYMENS- DAY

Again, empty... Jake strides in and approaches the deserted

teller counter.

ANOTHER TELLER MATERIALIZES and greets him with a smile.

INT.- JFK AIRPORT/TERMINAL HALLWAY- DAY

Like the banks, empty. Jake walks with the suitcase down

the flourescent lit hall towards a series of tables under

a sign marked "Customs."

As we get closer to the Custom's Desk, a CUSTOMS OFFICER

wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a badge

MATERIALIZES behind it.

Jake approaches and slides the suitcase towards him. The

Officer slides it back to Jake, revealing another envelope

stuffed with cash under it.

CONTINUED:

The Officer literally looks the other way as he pockets

the envelope and waves Jake through the gate.

EXT.- JFK AIRPORT- DAY

Jake exits the terminal. Outside, the street is empty,

not a traveler, an airlines rep, a luggage handler or a

cab. Jake waits at an empty cross walk until the "walk"

signal is given.

As he walks away, WE SEE some PEOPLE MATERIALIZE carrying

luggage... Then a FEW CARS... Then an AIRLINE REP...

Gradually more and more people and cars, each MATERIALIZING

into a normal scene at the airport until we lose Jake in

the crowd.

INT.- THE EUCLID- RESUMING

Jake stops and gauges the crew for their reactions, which

are the same all the way around-- Slack jawed disbelief.

Her eyes stay on Jake as a smile grows across her face.

EXT.- PAY PHONE- DAY

Jake dials a number...

CONTINUED:

EXT. BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)

Butch takes out a cigarette.

INT. - 16TH PRECINT/OFFICE- DAY

An office of empty chairs and desks. Through the windows

we can see the hustle and bustle of the precinct. SPECIAL

AGENT GUNTHER MOONAN, still dressed in the same shitty

suit, sits behind a desk as Rottovich and Sobozinski

enter.

Moonan quickly flashes a badge and his best Kodak smile.

CONTINUED:

Moonan holds up crime scene photos of Big Al's body.

Moonan takes out a microcassette recorder and hits PLAY.

CLICK.   Moonan kills the recorder.

The Officers look out the window to see TWO SERIOUS LOOKING

MEN in suits.

INT.- BULLDOG GYM- DAY

Boxers at the bags, a jumping rope, etc...

Jake and Lily stand in front of the King Pin, who's

dressed in shorts and a t-shirt. He wears boxing gloves

and headgear. Lupus and Harlin stand vigil by the

sparring ring.

CONTINUED:

King Pin eyes Jake suspiciously for a second.

Lily just shrugs and rolls her eyes.

CONTINUED:

A few of the BOXERS training around stop and turn.          The

King Pin lowers a glare at Jake.

Jake looks behind him to see Harlin looming.

A few more BOXERS stop and turn. Jake notices he's being

watched. The King Pin takes a step towards Jake...

Jake unbuttons his shirt and stands in front of the King

Pin, arms crossed. It's getting weird.

The King smiles and begins to take off his shirt.       Harlin

and Lupus share an uncomfortable glance.

The King strips down to the waist and reveals an incredibly

large, incredibly round stomach which he SLAPS loudly.

The King grabs Jake's hand and puts it on his stomach.

It just got weirder.

Now the whole gym has stopped, everyone focused on Jake

and the King Pin.

CONTINUED:

The King starts to get that look again.

Jake winds up and punches the King in the stomach.           He

shakes his fist in pain.

Jake's demeanor changes as he winds up and hits the King

as hard as he can. The King just smiles.

The King then hits Jake back in the gut with surprising

speed. Jake falls to his knees, but the King's right

there. With one arm he pulls Jake up and starts to pummel

him in the stomach with an unbridled visciousness.

Jake spits up blood as the King hurls him face first into

the ring.

Harlin and Lupus lift Jake up.        Lily looks at Jake with a

pained expression.

CONTINUED:

Everyone in the gym goes back to their workouts.

EXT. - BACK ALLEY (PRESENT)

Butch lets out an easy laugh.

EXT. - CITY BANK OF NEW YORK DAY

A flood of people exit the bank at the end of the day.

Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of

the building. Miles reads off a piece of paper.

Miles points out a woman crisply dressed in a suit,

MICHELLE STRIGO. They follow her down the street.

Jake watches as she hails a cab. A MAN, also hailing a

cab goes for the same one. Michelle gets into a screaming

match with the man.

monetary earning potential from Supermodel-types ages 20-

25."

EXT. - CITY BANK OF NEW YORK- NEXT DAY

The same flood of people exit the bank... Jake, Lupus,

Lily, Miles and Gordo wait by the side of the building.

Miles points out ALICE TANNER, a mousy looking woman in a

bad skirt. She gets to the intersection and waits for

the light to change, even as hordes of others jaywalk the

way New Yorkers do.

FREEZE FRAME ON ALICE-- A CGI SIGN appears: "Single woman

looking for opportunity. Plays by the rules and willing

to claw her way up to middle management."

EXT. - CITY BANK OF NEW YORK- NEXT DAY

Again the flood of people.       Again Jake, Lupus, Lily, Miles

and Gordo wait.

Miles points out a GRANT ASHBY, a schlubish middle aged

balding guy walking down the street. They follow.

INT.- THE BULL AND THE BEAR PUB- NIGHT

Dark oak and brass, the bar plays host to legions of

Suited Urban Professionals gathered in cliques.

Jake and the others watch as Ashby makes his way through

the crowd, taking a seat alone at the bar.

FREEZE FRAME ON ASHBY-- A CGI SIGN appears over his head:

"SINGLE MALE seeks end to safety of tedious and solitary

lifestyle. Moral and ethical constitution flexible."

Jake watches as Ashby orders a drink and pulls a

newspaper from his coat. He opens it to the crossword--

Just like Jake would.

Jake watches Ashby do the crossword puzzle alone.

INT.- GARMENT DISTRICT/WAREHOUSE- DAY

Jake, Miles, Gordo, Lily and Lupus enter a warehouse

housing racks of clothes.

CONTINUED:

They're greeted by FRANKIE SUITS, an ancient rake-thin

man, perfectly coiffed and exceptionally dressed.

Suits grabs Jake with a hug.     It's a heartfelt one.

The others exchange greetings with Suits who moves over

to Lupus and studies his loud sweatsuit.

Miles gives him a look like he's speaking latin.

Jake and Lily follow Suits into...

INT.- SUITS' OFFICE- DAY

A spare little office piled high with clothes. Suits

reaches into a desk drawer and pulls out a large envelope

and slides it to Jake.

CONTINUED:

Jake takes out the papers and gives them the once over.

He then puts an envelope thick with cash on the desk.

Suits gives Lily another suspicious look.

Lily watches in utter confusion.

CONTINUED:

A dead look comes over Suits.

Jake considers those words for a moment.

Suits guages the seriousness in Jake's face and nods.

The he gently rests his hands on the papers.

CONTINUED:

Suits holds out his hand.         Jake takes it.

They shake, knowing it'll be the last time.

INT.- GARMENT DISTRICT/WAREHOUSE- CONTINUOUS

INT. - TIFFANY'S - NIGHT

Jake and Lily enter the store. Jake takes a quick moment

to case the place-- A few scattered CUSTOMERS, some being

helped by SALESPEOPLE. All the Customers look like the

uppercrust crowd you'd expect at Tiffany's.

Jake leaves Lily by the front counter as he starts a slow

turn around the store.

He casually pretends to be browsing as he moves next to

MR. LEWIS, an older, distinguished looking gentleman,

being helped by a SALEGIRL, who is scribbling on an order

form.

CONTINUED:

The Salesgirl takes the order form and walks away.

A change comes over Jake. It's subtle-- Posture, facial

expressions, a slight tug of an accent-- but it's there.

Mr. Lewis turns and looks at Jake. There's no real hint

of recognition, but Jake's smiling up at him like an old

friend.

Jake extends his hand.

Mr. Lewis seems to search for second, then extends his

hand more in an effort not to appear rude.

The Salesgirl returns.

a second.

her waist.

gives him a friendly smile, then back to Jake.

Unseen to Mr. Lewis, one corner of Jake's lip goes up in

a grin.

EXT.- TIFFANY'S/SIDEWALK--NIGHT

Jake and Lily exit the store.     Jake hands Lily the

trademark colored box.

Lily puts on a big smile while opening the box.

CONTINUED:

Jake pulls Lily closer and looks into her eyes. She leans

in and they kiss-- A deep, slow kiss that makes people

have to walk around them.

Mr. Lewis sees them and smiles to himself as he gets into

a cab.

Jake and Lily are still kissing as the cab pulls away.

Lily finally breaks the kiss--- Slowly.

Jake watches as Lily walks away. She looks back at Jake

once before disappearing around a corner.

Lily looks away, her face softening for a moment.

Jake continues to LAUGH...

INT . - LILY'S APARTMENT--DAY

Not even the soft morning light can diffuse the reality

of this slum-pit studio apartment.

Jake lies next to Lily, kissing her neck. A spoon

RATTLES in a glass from the growing RUMBLE of a passing

subway train. The RUMBLE rises to an almost deafening

volume.

Jake's a little alarmed.   Lily, oblivious.

Lily shrugs indifferently.

Jake resumes kissing Lily's neck, trying to rekindle some

RUMBLES in the distance.

egg.

HEAVY FOOTSTEPS from the hall catch her attention, growing

louder, then stopping at her door. A KNOCK.

knife, but it's only a butter knife. She tosses it aside.

Lily moves to the door and looks out the peep hole.

Lily moves to the closet.

More KNOCKING.

Lily rumages in the closet and a baseball bat. She hefts

the bat and takes a stance in front of the door.

More KNOCKING.

Another KNOCK. Lily slowly reaches for the doorknob.

Then the door flies open with a CRASH. Harlin fills the

doorway.

Lily, wide-eyed, stands frozen with the bat still cocked..

Lily takes a swing.      Harlin easily grabs the bat and

backhands Lily. She      goes flying back into the far wall,

bounces off and lands     with a THUD at Harlin's feet where

she finds the butter     knife.

Harlin reaches down and pulls Lily up by the hair.            The

egg SIZZLES in the pan.

Lily takes a stab at Harlin, but the knife just bounces

off his coat. Harlin slaps Lily again, sending her flying

into the stove. Smoke starts to rise from the burning

egg.

Harlin steps closer, but Lily throws her hands up in

surrender.

A spoon RATTLES in a cup as the RUMBLE of a subway train

grows LOUDER.

CONTINUED:

Lily shakes her head and points to her ear and mouths,

"Can't hear you." Harlin moves closer and they lean into

each other.

She grabs the smoking pan from the stove and WHACKS Harlin

across the head. The burned egg lands on the floor.

Lily watches as he sways and teeters on his feet, like a

drunk. She raises the pan again... But before she

delivers the final blow, Harlin steps on the egg, causing

his leg to shoot out from under him. He lands flat on

his back, out cold. The wood floor CREAKS with his weight.

Lily wipes the blood from her nose and turns the hot

plate off.

(FLASHBACK) INT.- CUSTOMS DESK

Gordo hoists the suitcase onto the desk. The Customs

Officer looks around nervously. We see he's looking at

Moonan in the B.G., who gives him a nod.

The Custom Officer waves Gordo through. Gordo reaches

down and picks up an IDENTICAL BLACK suitcase already

lying on the table next to his and leaves.

Moonan walks over to the Customs Desk and takes the

original black suitcase. He nods to the Customs Officer.

Moonan turns and walks TOWARDS CAMERA, wheeling the

suitcase behind him.

We CLOSE-IN ON THE BADGE hanging from Moonan's neck.     On

it is a number and the single word, "CUSTOMS".

A THIN, WHITE VEST, splattered with blood and wired with

squibs falls to the ground.

POLICE SIRENS WAIL just around the corner.

Jake emerges from .the back alley, his shirt ripped and

splattered with fake blood.

A black car comes to a stop n front of him.    The tinted

glass slides down and Jake leans in.

Inside we see Moonan and Lily riding in the back, Miles

and Gordo up front.

She smiles that smile.

Jake gets in and the car pulls away, followed seconds

later by two Police Cars SCREECHING to a stop in front of

the Euclid.
