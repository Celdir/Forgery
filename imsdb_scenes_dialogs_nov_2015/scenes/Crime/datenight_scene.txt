FADE IN:

INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

A modest city bedroom. Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes

sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in.

In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his

mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of

WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he

finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA

FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap.

Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the

one who told me not to mess up the

precious picture piles!

he gives him a long, slow kiss.

PHIL (CONT ' D )

Minty fresh.

That was nice.

It was nice.

Hey from now on when you change the

toilet paper, could you just make sure it

is out?

Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's

over!

Oh, believe me, we're just getting

started, Phil.

(reaches into picture pile)

Look at this one of your Mom with me. I

mean that woman can't contain her 'Love!

ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands

stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle

deep in a manure bin.

She just takes a while to warm up. You

guys are gonna be best buddies. You

picked a favorite of us yet?

2.

Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara.

That's exactly the one I picked!

Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed.

It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look

joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front

of them.

Man, I wish I was them.

Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades

as she stares at the picture. He notices.

I just... when I was growing up my Mom

and Dad had a picture just like this.

Now they can't even acknowledge each

other.

Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.

Let's always remember to have some time

that's just for the two of us. No matter

what else comes up in our lives - if it's

work or friends or when we have kids-

We're having kids? With an "S"?

OK fine. But I promise you it's never

gonna happen to us.

Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that

when I'm long in the tooth.

You'll be even hotter long toothed.

Right now to be honest Clara they're a

little stumpy.

Oh really?

As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and

turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of

pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.

Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures.

wasn't the pictures.

You know how long that took?

We'll fix the picture piles, Clara.

We've got all the time in the world.

From now on everything's gonna be just

about us.

Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.

OLLIE (V.0.)

MOM!

The Talking Head's "Once in a Lifetime" kicks

INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNING

Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an

ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am.

OLLIE (O.S.)

Mo-om!

It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan

in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER

while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a

T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each

side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite

directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the

hall and Phil to the bathroom.

OLLIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Mom! Mom! Mom!

I'm coming, Ollie!

INT. OLLIE'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's

bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil

showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the

doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack

of PAPERS in his hand.

Uh Phil?

Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers.

Yep?

I need to switch. I've got an open

house.

Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but

contains it.

Really?

Yeah. Really.

As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands

together.

OK, so I say today we go for the slacker

look - cool yet approachable.

Yeah, well Mom says that.

Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.

Oh. Well... that's cool too!

INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - SAME

The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly

through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin

SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open.

She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then

stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing

a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror.

As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as

well.

Ech. Mine.

She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts

brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of

razor hairs and bits of toothpaste.

Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to

discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and

shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.

Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the

holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT.

As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fad

NT. KITCHEN

Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as

Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits

at the table. Phil finally notices.

What?

Breakfast?

Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob

today. What's it gonna be?

Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign

of his tom.

How about... some Captain Crunch?

Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.

Captain Crunch?The cereal?

Uh... yeah. Sure.

Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out

cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed

in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.

Ah ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a

bowl yesterday.

But Dad already said yeah sure.

Clara glances at Phil.

said it. I said it

Yeah, sure! You know it's only one bowl

A week.

One bowl a day a week.

Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already

in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.

This is not for you today!

Yeah right.

Worth a try.

Did you get his lunch together?

Oh. Whoops.

You just get his breakfast and I'll do

it.

As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie

and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton. Peeking

back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the

phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch. He

stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly

returning the carton to the fridge.

Hey Jane? I'm getting a late start but

I'll be there as soon as I can.

Sorry I dropped the ball. It's this

Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today.

You know how he freaks me out with all of

his mixed animal metaphors that I don't

(focusing on Ollie's lunch)

Ollie, do you want a banana?

7.

Did you hear me?

(not looking at him)

Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed

animal metaphors that you don't

understand. Banana Ollie?

So I should probably get going. With the

highway construction it takes forever to

get downtown these days.

OK. Have a good day.

Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it

off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly

kisses Phil on the cheek.

CLL. -- (CONT ' D )

Sorry. Your mouthy was still ail milky.

Sorry for the milky mouth.

He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1i121

dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink,

then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk

in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her

head, she tosses the carton in the trash.

EXT. FRONT OF FOSTER' S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport

next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks

a newspaper off his lawn.

CHAZ (O.S.)

Well, well! We're up bright and early,

aren't we!

Yes we are!

(under his breath)

ike you say to me every morning.

Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and

Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'

car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few

inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING

STUCK halfway.

OW! OW! OW!

Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and

peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room.

Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger

side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the

front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear

and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's

seat.

HONKING.

EXT. EISENHOWER HIGHWAY - A LITTLE LATER

The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD

CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of

it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his

window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in

slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR

DIGGS APPRECIATES YOUR PATIENCE WHILE WE BUILD OUR

HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his

watch.

EXT. STREET

Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her

30's, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW

SIGNS on the sidewalk.

His name's Juan and he's some kind of

Spanish, I think. He knows all these

exclusive, underground places downtown.

It's so exciting. And in bed...

I never knew I could still get my leg

back that far.

Too much information, Jane.

INT. OPEN HOUSE

Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each

move quickly around different parts of the vacant home,

cleaning and inspecting.

The divorce was the best thing that ever

happened to me. Seriously. You know

that great nervous feeling in your

stomach? Where you don't know what's

going to happen next?

On her way down the hall, Clara spots a mark up ahead on

the wall. She reaches into her large purse and pulls out

a mini-409 mister and a rag. With the aim of a

SHARPSHOOTER, she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she

passes.

JANE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

With Larry, I lost that. Everything had

just become routine, you know? Boring.

Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through

the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a

weird, loud buzzing noise.

But now, all of a sudden I'm alive again!

Good for you, Jane.

Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki

the side and silencing it.

Good for you.

T. FRONT HALLWAY - A LITTLE L

prospectuses.

There's this g---eat restaurant downtown we

went to the ot__ar night that you guys

would love. _"st amazing view of the

city. You guys should check it out on

your next date night.

(focusing on stapling)

Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have

those that much anymore.

't have date nights:

(shrugs),

You know, we're pretty tired all the time

between work and Ollie. And some of the

shows on TV these days are really great.

Ah. I see.

10.

They staple in silence for a second. Jane and Clara look

at each other.

I know that's really lame.

So it's Phil?

No, it's not Phil. It's the both of us.

I don't know. It just... happened.

So why don't you change it? All you have

to do is stir things up and have one

great, sexy, exciting night again.

I guess. Maybe.

Not maybe. Tonight.

Nah. Tonight's no good.

Why not? Seriously think about it.

What's really gonna be more important

tonight than that?

Clara takes this in. Jane's right.

INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE

Checking his watch, Phil shakes his head as he rushes

through the large bullpen of the Chicago Mercantile

Exchange. In the pits all around him, BUYERS and SELLERS

scream out their orders.

INT. MR. RIVERS' OFFICE

In a dark wood office with STUFFED AR 'i12 L HEADS lining

the walls, a young, smartly dressed man in his 20's,

GEORGE, quietly goes through a binder with MR. RIVERS,

60, at the older man's desk. As Phil bursts in they both

look over.

I'm sorry I'm late. The construction on

the highways is insane these days!

MR. RIVERS

Don't worry about it, Phil. It's fine.

Catch your breath.

George gives Mr. Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake, then

heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil. Phil nods

back warily, then takes out his binder, ready to launch

into his report.

MR. RIVERS (CONT'D)

Uh, Phil. Listen, before we start...

I've been thinking... this next quarter

we need to venture into open tundra.

Start really ripping the meat.

(beat, trying to decipher)

Uh. OK. You mean... take the fund in a

more high risk direction?

MR.

Yeah. That's wha: I - -aid.

Sure. OK, fine. I can work up some

higher risk options and come back

tomorrow.

MR. RIVERS

OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want

George to give me his thoughts on where

we need to be hunting too.

Oh.

MR. RIVERS

s nothing personal.

So let me get this straight. You're

telling me that tomorrow I'm going to

have to interview for the job I already

have? Against George?

MR. RIVERS

I wouldn't put it like that. I Just need

our pack leader to be more like... like a

momma kangaroo. Ya get me?

Kinda.

Actually, no. Not really at all.

12.

MR. RIVERS

The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth

and knows its momma's teat is just always

there, ready to suckle. But at the same

time, momma kangaroo's still a wild,

dangerous creature.

Sorry. Still not totally getting you.

MR. RIVERS

I've had a wife and a family. Three of

them. It's hard to stay the fastest

cheetah when you need to mind the pack,

Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't

have a family to worry about. He can rip

the meat.

Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to...

I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat

and eating them like tartare when George

was still... in the jungle!

MR. RIVERS

What does that mean?

I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just

can't.

MR. RIVERS

Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta

say that lately your leadership on this

has felt a little... well... tame.

That's all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers!

I'll see you tomorrow.

Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River's office.

Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from

school.

reservation's at 7:45.

She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a

Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose.

13.

Without breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and

hands the grateful mother a tissue, then takes out a mini-

bottle of Purell and cleans her hands.

Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it.

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Mrs. Foster?

Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned

MRS. CARDIGAN, 45, walking toward her in the parking lot.

Oh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you

later.

Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a

warm smile.

I've been meaning to tell you that you

can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan.

MRS. CARDIGAN

I'd prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries

matter.

OK...

MRS. CARDIGAN

Can we speak a moment? Alone?

Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car.

As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan.

Is everything OK?

MRS. CARDIGAN

Well, I'm afraid not. Oliver's been

antagonizing the girls in the class a

great deal lately. Especially Jenny

Diggs.

Really? Oh no. Why do you think that's

happening?

MRS. CARDIGAN

I'm going to leave that to you and your

nd to figure out. But beyond that,

,i: overall attitude these days is

just... sub par. E

14.

MRS. CARDIGAN (CONT'D)

His penmanship is sloppy. He lacks

motivation and tries to just "get by" o

assignments. You know, this is a very

competitive school, Mrs. Foster. In my

opinion, maybe you should consider

whether this is really the right

environment for him.

(beat, stunned)

Uh... wow. OK.

Mrs. Cardigan starts away. Clara climbs into the car,

watching Mrs. Cardigan.

(under her breath)

Wow. What a bitch.

Did you just call Mrs. Cardigan a bitch?

(remembering Ollie's in the

No.

Yeah you did.

I didn't. I really didn't.

Clara quickly pulls out.

CAR PORT - LATER

Phil SQUEEZES out of his drivers seat with folders full

of RESEARCH. As he walks toward the house he spots the

TONS of room on the other side of Clara's car and shakes

his head.

Unbelievable!

INT. OLLIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Still carrying his research, Phil peeks in on Ollie, who

packs a suitcase.

Hey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta

tell you it's about time.

I'm going to Nana's tonight.

15.

On a school night? Why?

Mom says you guys are going out.

Tonight? What? No.

Clara?

INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Phil marches into the bedroom.

Clara? Cl-

He stops in the doorway as he spots her. Made up in an

evening dress in front of a full length mirror, Clara

looks STUNNING as she finishes putting an earring on.

Wow. Wow.

Clara tns and smiles.

I thought I could take you out to

celebrate you finally getting that report

in. A romantic dinner downtown like the

old days, and teen...

(raises :,er eyebrows)

Wow... It sounds... great.

Great!

She turns back and continues getting ready.

It's just... is there any chance we coul

take a rain check?

A "rain check"?

Yeah. Unfortunately I really need to do

a bit of work tonight. E

16.

I thought all the cramming was for this

report today. Did something go wrong?

Uh, no. Nothing like that. I just

decided I could play with it a little

more. Make it a little better.

Clara takes him in a moment.

Oh. OK.

Controlling herself, Clara starts putting her jewelry

back in the case.

Listen, I'm sorry...

You don't need to apologize, Phil.

Listen, if I had more warning-

Then something else would have come up.

You know it. That's the thing, Phil. We

used to do things on the spur of the

moment all the time. Even after Ollie

was born. Now we never do anything

together.

They stare at each other, then Phil breaks

Listen... any other night.

OK. Maybe another time. Let me just get

out of this and call my Mom then.

As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her,

feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around

the room, Clara's SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their

romantic night. He looks down again at the papers in his

hand and sucks in, conflicted.

INT. CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

As Clara starts to take her dress off, Phil scoots past

her, humming to himself. She looks over to see him

choosing a tie and jacket from his side. Clara looks

him, still unsure.

17.

That dress really wasn't playing fair,

Clara.

With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie.

Well get a move on, girl!

She zips her dress back up.

A DOORBELL RINGS.

INT. RUTH'S FRONT DOOR

RUTH, Clara's mother, opens her front door and brightens.

(to Clara and Ollie)

Hey sweeties.

Phil.

Ruth.

Nana rented us a special treat tonight

before bed, Ollie! The Wizard of Oz!

PHIL,

Wow. Wizard of Oz. Don't you think

that's a little scary for a 5 year old?

(not looking at him)

No, Phil, I don't.

OK... not so sure about that.

Clara? What do you think?

(putting her pressure on)

Yeah, Clara. What do you think?

18.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE

Phil's flustered as he and Clara head out the door

towards Phil's car.

I'm sorry, Phil. I just felt like she's

doing us a favor tonight.

fine. Fine.

oust as they climb into the car, Clara stops.

You know, I should pee before we go.

OK. Sure.

As Clara runs back to Ruth's house, Phil plops down in

the driver's seat.

I'll just wait in the car as you go back

E inside to pee. Again.

EXT. EISENHOWER PARKWAY - SUNSET

As the sun sets, Phil and Clara sit in BUMPER TO BUMPER

TRAFFIC. It extends for MILES toward the center of the

city.

CAR - S

Phil turns on the air conditioner and adjusts the vents.

You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor

Diggs. Tries to widen all the highways

to get reelected, but all everyone's

going to remember when it's time to vote

is all this mess.

You're hot?

Yeah. That's why I turned on the air.

Clara shuts the passenger side vents which causes AIR to

GUST out of Phil's vents, into his face. He glances at

Clara, oblivious, then reaches over and turns down the

air.

You know, Mrs. Cardigan told me today

that Ollie's been antagonizing his

daughter.

Antagonizing? How does a five year old

"antagonize?" I'm sure she wouldn't have

mentioned it if it wasn't "the Mayor's

daughter."

She also went on that Ollie's

penmanship's sloppy and he's not

motivated enough.

(trying to make a joke of

Got all my best traits, huh?

He looks over to see that Clara looks out of the wiF n,,

not responding - a response in itself. He sucks in.

I think he's fine.

She actually had the gall to suggest we

should think about sending him somewhere

else.

Maybe she's right if the school has that

kind of attitude.

Clara's about to object bit stops herself and takes a

breath, playing affection-.-ely with the back of Phil's

hair.

You know what? All we ever end up

talking about is Ollie or work. Let's

just focus on us tonight.

Great. I'm all for tha

Beat. They sit in silence in the traffic.

Ga.

So what are you thinking about?

Right now? Traffic.

Oh. Well, I heard this unbelievable

story from Jane today.

Yeah?

She has this old classmate who went into

labor with her second child the other

day. She's totally healthy and

everything's normal with the pregnancy.

So she goes into labor and walks into the

emergency room, and the second the nurses

and attendants see her come in, they go

into a panic and start yelling A,LA! ATMiA!

AMA!

What's AMA?

Advanced Maternal Age!

No! You've got to be joking me!

kid you not!

That's unbelievable!

I know.

Beat. Clara looks out the window.

The funny thing is she's my age,

actually.

Suddenly, Phil's smile fades as he realizes the possible

ulterior motive.

Huh.

21.

Clara picks up on his change and figures out what he's

thinking. A bit flustered, she opens her vents again.

Phil looks over at her.

I thought you were cold.

I was, but then you turned it down and I

got hot.

But I turned it down because... you see

when you open and close your vents it

makes my... never mind.

Phil reaches over and turns up the air again. Tapping

his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he gets fed up,

suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding

toward the exit.

What are you doing?

I'm just gonna take a shortcut.

Phil, please don't. You think they're

shortcuts but they always take longer.

And we're already-

Clara, please just trust me, OK

They zoom ahead for a moment in silence. Frustrated,

Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a POWERFUL GUST

OF COLD AIR onto Phil's face. Biting his tongue, he just

leaves it blowing on him as they drive.

INT. THE SIGNATURE ROOM

Phil and Clara rush off the elevator and enter the

Signature Restaurant on the 95t Flcor of the John

Hancock Center, with dramatic s- Lng views over

skyline of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan.

I promise you it wouldn't have been any

faster. I promise!

OK, Phil. Will you just tell them we're

here? I'm gonna go pee.

22.

Now?

What?

Nothing.

As Clara hurries off, Phil, shaking his head, makes his

way through the crowds to the SUPERMODEL HOSTESS.

Good evening. Welcome to the Signature

Room.

Thanks. The name is Foster.

Foster... Oh, I'm sorry. We just had

give away your table.

You gave away our table? We're just ten

minutes late!

Actually, you're 11 minutes late.

OK. But don't you guys have, like, some

kind of grace period or something?

have an eight minute grace period.

You have an eight minute grace period?

How did you come up with an eight minute

grace period?

I just work here,

So what if someone's 9 minutes late?

We're allowed to give a two minute grace

on the grace.

23.

OK. Which adds up to ten minutes! We're

11 minutes late. That's just one minute

later than the grace on the grace.

I'm sorry sir, but management

specifically said no grace on the grace

on the grace. After ten minutes, we send

a host around calling your name and if

there's no answer, we give the table

away. Sorry.

So how long's the wait for another table?

Well, let's see...

Phil looks on as the Supermodel Hostess runs her finger

down a LONG LIST OF WRITE-IN NAMES. As she turns to the

next page...

Oh boy.

INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Even the bathroom has sweeping views of Chicago. As

Clara leaves a bathroom stall, she notices a NERVOUS

YOUNG WOMAN washing her face over and over.

A knock and a SLICK LOOKING MAN quickly peeks his head in

the Women's room.

SLICK LOOKING MAN

We've gotta leave now.

Whoops. Sorry.

It's OK.

The Nervous Woman quickly leaves the bathroom with the

Man. Clara looks after them a second, then washes her

hands.

INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER

How lc= -until they seat us?

24.

Two hours. They gave away our

reservation. Peanut?

What?!? Did you tell them that we hit

traffic?

They wouldn't care, Clara. If they call

your name at the bar and you don't

answer, they give your table away. So

how about a nut?

A YOUNG HOST (not the Hostess) mills around the bar.

GALE PARTY?

Clara sighs, frustrated.

I mean, did you try something like

telling her it was our anniversary, or my

birthday, or slipping her some money-

Oh, I see. Lying and graft were the

answer!

Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST

searching for the party and starts focusing on him

instead of Phil as she thinks.

GALE PARTY?

I'm sure if you had been there instead of

peeing again you would have done it

better.

GALE PARTY?

You're not even listening to me, are you?

(repeats, still watching)

Yeah I am. You're sure if I had been

there instead of peeing again I would

have done it better.

Clara, Just because you can repeat the

words I say doesn't mean you're-

LAST CALL! GALE-

Sorry! We're right here!

Wait. What are you doing?

Shhh!

The Young Host approaches.

Gale party of three?

The third's running a little

going to start without them.

eat. Follow me.

Phil shoots Clara a look, but she ignores it. He falls

into line after her as she follows the Young Host to th

restaurant.

INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SIGNATURE ROOM - MOMENTS LA

hields his face as they pass the Supermodel Hos

at the Greeting Station. The Young Host leads them

secluded table right by the windows - THE BEST TABLE

THE RESTAURANT.

(handing them menus)

Enjoy your dinner.

The Young, Host leaves.

See? Was that so hard to do, Phil?

bad to be the Gales, eh?

Clara opens her menu as looks nervously around the

restaurant.

Look Phil! It's white truffle season!

I'm totally doing it!

26.

We can't do this, Clara.

I'm taking you out.

Not the truffles.

This is stealing.

Stealing? You're kidding, right.

We're not the Gales.

So? You said yourself - if you don't

answer at the bar they give your table

away.

Well, what if they show up now?

u get spanked'

I'm serious!

I don't know. What if they do, Phil?

Clara picks up her menu and reads, shaking her head.

What?

It's just... I don't know. You used to

be the one who would think up stuff like

this all the time.

This hits Phil. He takes in his wife reading the menu

for a beat.

You know what? You're absolutely right.

Clara lowers her menu and they look at each other for

what feels like the first time tonight.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Gale.

27.

It's OK, Mr. Gale. And might I add you

look very handsome tonight?

You're not looking too shabby yours

Mrs. Gale.

Mr. Gale?

They turn, surprised, to see TWO BURLY MEN in suits at

their table. The Older of the two politely speaks to

them.

OLDER BURLY MAN

We need to have a word with you both.

What's this about?

OLDER BURLY MAN

k you know what this is about.

you could please come with us.

Why can't we talk here? u

OLDER BURLY 'MAN

(beat, smiles)

I think it would save everyone a lot of

embarrassment.

(gestures with hand)

Please...

The Younger Burly Man comes behind Clara's chair to pull

it out. Getting up, Phil shoots Clara an "I told you so"

look as he follows the older Burly Man through the

restaurant toward the kitchen doors, the Younger Burly

Man walking behind them with Clara.

INT. BACK KITCHEN AREA - MOMENTS LATER

The Burly Man leads them through the kitchen. A WAITER

stops, surprised.

Can I help you?

OLDER s _ i12'LY MAN

Nah. We're fine A

Walking to the rear service elevator, the Older Burly Man

pushes the down button. The elevator opens.

28.

Whoa. Wait a minute. Where are we

going?

OLDER BURLY MAN

Get in, please.

The Younger Burly Man coming up behind them crowds them

into the elevator.

Hey! Jesus!

The elevator doors shut and the older Burly Man pushes

the G Floor then nods to his partner. They reach in

their pockets.

Listen, this is all getting out of hand,

OK? I admit we maybe did something a

teeny bit wrong, but-

Suddenly, they grab Phil and Clara, putting HANDKERCHIEFS

over their noses and mouths. Phil and Clara veil and

struggle for a moment, then PASS OUT.

E CLOSEUP ON PHIL'S NOSE

An AMMONIA STICK waves back and forth under Phil's nose

and he startles awake, disoriented, to see he's TIED TO A

CHAIR in the middle of a GIGANTIC MEAT LOCKER. A VIDEO

CAMERA on a tripod aims at their faces and across the

room, the Younger Burly Man sorts through items from

Clara's purse and Phil's wallet scattered all over the

table.

Whoa. What the hell is this?

Tied in the chair next to him, Clara jumps as the Older

Burly Man waves the stick under her nose.

Phil?!? What's going on?

I don't know.

A VOICE speaks from a speakerphone on the table

The chloroform may make you feel dizzy

for a few moments, but it will go away.

29.

Phil takes in what's going on, freaked.

Listen... you can just have all our

money, OK? Whatever's there, it's yours.

We're not looking to cause problems or

put up any kind fight. We'll just walk

away and not report anything, OK? All we

want is for you to let us go unharmed.

We need to discuss your little stunt

tonight first, Mr. and Mrs. "Gale." Or

should we say... what is it Harry?

HARRY, the Younger Burly Man reads Phil and Clara's IDs,

which he's grabbed off of them.

Phil and Clara Foster.

That's what this is abo

else would it be about, Mr. Foster

Wait. `'This a joke, right? Some funny

little bald guy's gonna jump out and

scare us and say, "Gotcha!" or somethi

OK, where is he? Where's that guy?

You think this is a joke?

Phil looks at the faces of the two thugs. No one's

joking.

No. Are you insane?!? You don't drug

people and tie them up for that! This i

I just- I hope you know this is gonna go

way beyond a shitty review in Za

I'm seriously pissed off!

INT. DARK BACK ROOM

SHADOWY FIGURE talks on a phone as he looks at a screen

showing Phil and Clara in chairs.

30.

Yes. Well, I'm a little upset as well,

Mr. Foster. And confused. It would help

me to know why a couple like the two of

you would try to pull something like

this.

T NT. WAREHOUSE

Phil's now getting really annoyed.

You must be kidding! Like a million

people don't do it every single night of

the week! This is unbelievable! I'm

just in shock here!

Harry and Frank look at each other, puzzled.

I enjoy your humor, Mr. Foster. Now why

don't you start by telling me how you got

into the Rainbow to set it uD-

"Into the Rainbow?" What the hell's

that? Restaurant code?

-and then you can tell me where the

photos are that you arranged to bring

tonight.

Photos?

Clara figures out what's happened.

Wait a minute. I think there's been a

really big mistake here. We're not the

Gales.

know you're not the Gales.

They know we're not the Gales. Don't you

get it!

No, Phil. I think they think we're

actually "the Gales" who made the

reservation tonight.

31.

Ohhhhhh. Oh. No. She's right. We're

not those Gales. You've got the wrong

people. Really.

Then why were you two at the Gales'

table, Mr. Foster?

OK, listen, what happened is we lost our

reservation and when the host came around

yelling the Gales' name and no one

answered, my wife said that we were them.

I swear on my life to you that's what

happened.

You're saying you just took someone

else's reservation you didn't know?

That's what you want me to believe?

I know that seems really weird. Listen,

I agree, that's what I said to her.

One problem with your story. When I came

over to the table - and you guys were all

alone - you were still calling each other

Gale.

That was just... we were... no, you don't

understand...

We'll need to move things along, Frank.

With a nod, Frank reaches into his pockets, slowly taking

out a GUN and a handful of BULLETS. He loads the gun as

Phil and Clara watch.

Wait a minute. What's going on?

I don't t don't like

this.

Clicking the loaded gun, Frank and Harry both come toward

Phil and Clara.

32.

If in ten seconds you don't tell us where

the photos are, you lose a knee, Mr.

Foster. Ten more seconds, you lose

another. Then we go to your wife.

Please! You can't do this! We're not

lying!

One... two... three... four...

Frank clicks the loaded gun at Phil's knee.

Oh Jesus. Don't do it!

Five... six... seven... eight...

Jesus!

OK FINE! FINE! YOU WIN! YOU CAN HAVE

THE GODDAMN PHOTOS!

Everyone looks over. Phil's surprised.

But we can't just tell you where they

are. We have to take you to them.

EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - A LITTLE LATER

In the middle of the deserted warehouse district, Clara

and Phil exit the meat packing plant behind Frank, who

carries Clara's purse, Harry holding a gun as he follows

them. As they head toward a Towncar, Frank throws the

keys back to Harry.

You drive with her in front.

So what's your plan here?

I don't have a plan Phil.

You don't have a plan?

33.

No. I was just trying to keep our knees

for the time being.

Well, if we end up in that car with them

we're as good as dead.

Quiet!

Well, any time you want to help...

What's that supposed to mean?

I said quiet!

They continue walking toward the Iowncar, Phil thin ing

hard. Suddenly, his expression changes and he star s

weaving dizzily, putting his hand to his forehead.

Phil?

He drops to the ground.

Whoa.

Phil? What is it?

I'm... not feeling so great...

's wrong with him?

I don't know.

I didn't... eat dinner and when I don't

my blood sugar... Hypoglycemic...

You're not hypoglycemic.

Phil shoots Clara a quick LOOK OF

34.

You're diabetic! You never get the terms

right, Phil! Oh no! This is bad, guys.

I just can't... go any further.

Harry and Frank look at each other, not sure what to do.

Should we call Mr. Stockton?

Don't say his name, you idiot!

Sorry! I was just-

We'll just throw him in the back and have

her show us.

hey move over to pick up Phil. Clara thinks fast.

Wait! In my purse there's a Luna Bar.

If you give it to me I can find it for

him.

With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her purse. She rummages

inside...

and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing

Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back

grabbing his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a

dash and grabs it. As Frank blindly lunges after her,

she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on the ground,

whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at

Harry.

Drop the gun and the keys.

oa! Clara! No

Harry drops them, raising his hands. Phil gets up and

grabs the gun and keys, then awkwardly hits Harry as hard

as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the

gun.

Harry looks at him, confused.

Ow! Why, man?

35.

Sorry. i was trying to knock you out.

Why,

ought that's what you do when-

Phil! Just c'mon!

Sorry.

Befuddled, Phil meets Clara at the car and they climb in

and speed away.

PHIL (V.0.) (CONT'D)

OK, let me just start from the very

beginning...

INT. POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Phil excitedly chatters next to Clara at a table in an

interrogation room in the police station. Across the

table, a YOUNG POLICE OFFICER takes their statement

We got to the restaurant late because we

hit all this traffic on the highway-

the shortcut.

What?

I just think we might have made it on

time if we stayed on the highway. Your

shortcuts end up being long cuts most o

the time.

OK, are you going to tell the Policeman

or and I gonna tell him?

You can tell him.

Because you always interrupt me when I

try to tell stories, and every time you

do it disrupts my flow.

Fine, you tell it. I won't say another

word.

Fine.

See, now I've totally lost where I was.

CLARA AND YOUNG POLICEMAN

You got to the restaurant late-

Yeah. Even using my shortcut which, by

the way, was a shortcut - and they gave

away our reservation. So we were at the

bar and the host was calling out for

these other people over and over-

Which is what they do right before they

cancel a reservation anyway.

I thought you said you weren't going to

interrupt me, Clara.

I just want him to understand we weren't

really "stealing" someone else's

Across the table, the Young Police officer, eyebrows

raised, watches Phil and Clara volley back and forth.

Do you think he really cares, Clara?

were just kidnapped, CHLOROFORMED and

almost shot! I don't think he's going

turn around and book us for reservation

theft! Am I right?

YOUNG POLIO OFFICER

Please. Go on.

So all of a sudden Clara yells out that

we're these other people.

You just took someone else's reservation?

37.

Yeah. I know! Even the guy on the

speakerphone couldn't believe it!

You two kinda bonded over that, didn't

you?

We didn't "bond" over it. I'm just

saying, speakerphone guy obviously

thought it was weird to do.

YC JG POLICEMAN

Guys, you lost We were in the

restaurant.

Ah, you mean the speakerphone guy who's

kidnapped and drugged us thinks it's

weird to do so it's weird to do?

Guys?

You're new "buddy."

Oh c'mon!

And we found out speakerphone guy's name,

Phil. It's Mr. Stockton.

The Young Policeman looks up, interested.

Mr. Stockton? Hold on a minute.

The Officer dials an extension on the phone.

Lieutecant Manning? i12eeird story. Havea

couple '.n here who claim --o have escaped

a kid- 7-ng this evening and the name

Stockt came up. OK. Will do.

He hangs up.

Lieutenant Manning likes to be notified

ere's anything involving Mr.

n.

38.

Wait. So you already know about this

guy? You know who he is?

A knock at the door and a handsome man in his late 40's,

LIEUTENANT MANNING, enters the room with a smile. He

reaches over and shakes their hands.

How do you do. Lieutenant Manning.

The Officer offers him his note pad.

Nah, as long as they're here might as

well get everything from the horse's

mouth, right?

As the Officer heads out of the room, Lieutenant Manning

sidles down into his seat.

Can I get you guys anything to drink?

Coffee? Water? Maybe a shot or two of

r whiskey?

That sounds more like

So why don't you tell me all about your

incident with Mr. Stockton.

You tell it, Clara.

Oh, don't be like that, Phil. Please.

Guys... you've obviously been through

something traumatic tonight. Thankfully

it's over and you're both safe and sound.

Maybe you should cut each other a little

bit more of a break.

Phil and Clara look at each other, each letting out air.

Manning's right.

Seriously, Clara. You tell him.

Well, we never a. t_::ally "met"

Stockton.

39.

CLARA (CONT`B)

He was in another room on a speakerphone

where these guys who kidnapped us took

us. But he was obviously the one pulling

the strings.

Who is this Stockton guy anyway?

LIEUI N'T' MANNING

Let me fill you in on all that later.

Now, why would he have wanted to kidnap

you two?

Honestly, you wouldn't believe this, but

it's because we sat down at the wrong

table tonight for dinner.

(looks up, interest

Really? The wrong table?

We pretended to be someone else who

didn't show up for their reservations.

My idea. And it turned out that these

people must have something this Mr.

Stockton wants.

Do you know what?

Photos.

Lieutenant looks up, interested, then writes again.

That's all you know?

Phil and Clara look at each other. Nod.

OK. I'm just confused about one thing.

When you took this other reservation, how

did you know for sure that the real Gales

weren't going to show up late?

Excuse me?

How were you so sure the Gales weren

going to show up if you don't know the

at all?

Clara looks down at the table, furrowing her brow.

Clara?

Sorry. I... I lost my train of thought.

Well, I can pick things up then.

Phil notices Clara giving him a LOOK.

What? Why are you looking at me like

that?

(intensifying the look)

I'm not looking at you like anything.

OK, well, I had the same question for her

when we sat down, which she thought was

Rubbing her forehead, Clara KICKS Phil's leg HARD under

the table.

OW! Jesus!

Clara stink-eyes Phil AGAIN, trying to get the message

across.

And there's that look again!

CLARE?

look! No. Looking. At all.

RINGING. Lieutenant Manning reaches into his jacket

pocket and checks the number on the cellphone. He hops

up.

Can you excuse me a moment?

41.

utenant Manning gets up and exits the room. Clara

does to the window in the door and watches him walk down

the hall to his office as he talks on the phone. Phil

puts his leg on the table, pulling up his pant leg to

inspect.

OK, I'm not dense, Clara. That was not

an accident and if those weren't looks-

Phil, we're in trou

What are you talking about?

He's in on this. He's got something to

do with it.

s hil as well.

Oh God.

How do we get out of here?

INT. ING'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Manning talks in his off ice.

42.

Uh huh. I know you don't. It will be

contained. Right now.

Hanging up the phone, Manning walks quickly back through

the police station to the interview room. He stops in

the doorway...

.it's EMPTY. Confused, he turns to an OFFICER outside

at the desk.

Where'd they go?

They said you were done with them.

Manning walks quickly back to his office.

Sitting behind his desk, Manning enters a password on his

computer and starts typing out an ALL POINTS BULLETIN.

We are CLOSE UP on the computer screen as the words come

ALL LOCAL AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT... PHIL AND CLARA

FOSTER... FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE... ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

INT. TOWNCAR - LATE

Clara drives as Phil scans the rearview mirror from the

passenger seat.

We can't just go to another police

station, Phil! We don't know how big

this is! It might not just be Manning!

Well then we're screwed! Who do we go

to? The FBI? The CIA?

They're not going to believe us over a

Police Lieutenant!

Shit. This is their car, Phil. We gotta

lose it too.

Searching the street, Clara spots a OPEN PARKING SPACE.

She whips the wheel around, trying to parallel park into

the space.

43.

You've got it, Clara. Spin it back now!

just let me do it,

She spins too late and too severely, hitting the curb.

Dammit! I hate this!

It's all right. You just should have

spun it when I told you to.

Flustered, she pulls back out and tries again.

rn! Quick!

Would you stop it? You're stressing me

out!

Angry, Clara whips the car back into the spot, NAILING

the car behind them and setting off a loud CAR ALARM WITH

Hearing the alarm, a LARGE MAN rushes out of a restaurant

nearby, looking at them.

Hey! You just hit my

The Large Man stomps toward them.

Run!

Phil and Clara get out of the car and run away on

The Large Man marches over and inspects his bumpe

yells after them.

Assholes!

EY INS LAT

They catch their breath in the alley.

OK. So we've got no car. They know

where we live. So where can we-

shit.

44.

Clara's eyes go wide as it hits her as well.

Ollie.

Phil takes out his cellphone and quickly dials, listening

as Ruth PICKS UP.

Hello?

Suddenly, GUNSHOTS RING OUT over the phone.

Oh God! Ruth! Is everything OK?

No it's not, Phil!

What's wrong?

RUTH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Feet up, Ruth eats Fiddle Waddle as she watches an action-

packed CHASE SCENE on TV.

It's CSI night! Call after 11!

Ruth hangs up the phone, shaking her head, and takes

another mouthful of Fiddle Fiddle.

ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Phil looks at the phone, incredulous.

What's wrong?

What? Just call her again and tell her

what's happened!

Phil dials the number again. Ruth picks up.

INT. RUTH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We sure do Phil! We sure do!

Ruth slams the phone down and pulls out the phone cord so

she won't be bothered again.

EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

Clara tries on her phone, then hangs up, frustrated.

Great, Phil. Now she's not picking up at

all!

You think this is my fault, don't you?

T - ft

No. I just don't know why you two can't

get along is all.

You know, your Mom shows me no respect, 0

Clara. And you just pretend like it

isn't happening.

So you think it's j1y fault. Listen,

Phil. Every single other boyfriend I

ever dated got along with her just-

Wait a minute! Holbrooke Peterson!

What?

Clara starts looking through her purse for her phone.

Holbrooke Peterson does something hush

hush with the FBI! I think he even lives

down here.

Holbrooke Peterson? You mean the tongue

guy?

What?

46.

Holbrooke was your prom date who you said

had the really long tongue, right?

Oh yeah.

(catching herself, shrugs

Uh, yeah... something like that...

She finds her phone and dials.

Since when have you been in touch with

Holbrooke Peterson?

We found each other on FacebookA

Facebook? I didn't know you were on

Facebook!

It's a networking thing for work.

Everyone's on Facebook.

0 yeah? Who else are you "in touch"

h on Facebook?

Hello? Holbrooke? Thank God you're

there. It's Clara Foster...

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT

HOLBROOKE PETERSON, a thoroughbred of a man in his mid-

30's, opens the door to his candlelit apartment with a

smile to find Phil and Clara.

Wow! Clara! You look exactly the same

So do you!

He gives her a big, tight hug, lifting her a little.

You feel exactly the same too.

Phil double-takes. Did he hear him right?

47.

This is my husband, Phil.

Ah! The man who actually landed Clara.

Holbrooke gives Phil the up and down with a winning smile

and holds out his hand.

Philly Cheese Steak. Nice to meet you.

Um... yeah... I don't go by... it's 1 - usL

Phil. Nice to meet you, too.

notice the whole place is filled with reclaimed and

recycled furniture and LIT WITH CANDLES.

How beautiful. Or, the candles... Did we

know, all you "Phil"-i-stines in the

suburbs.

Holbrooke chuckles. Phil's about to say something when a

look from Clara reminds him to bite his lip. Holbrooke

gestures to some cardboard furniture.

So have a seat.

Holbrooke starts to sit down himself, then makes a show

of taking a LARGE GUN out of his shoulder holster and

putting it on the table.

Whoa. You carry that around at home?

Yeah. I'm supposed to sleep with her

under my pillow.

Wish I didn't have to, but I just see it

as... I carry the weight so citizens like

It's so funny. I always knew you'd end

up doing something in public service.

I don't know. That's lust how I

Phil looks to Clara - can you get a load of this guy, but

Clara's focused on Holbrooke.

HOLBROOKE (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is

not a man you want to get on the wrong

side of.

INT. HOLBROOKE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Phil watches as Holbrooke licks the salt allllll the wav

around his Margarita glass with his extra long tongue.

Clara listens intently, eating some jicama slices from a

platter on the table in front of them.

He's like a Nicaraguan turtle - keeps his

head deep in his shell unless he

absolutely has to stick it out. Those

photos must be really important to him.

49.

HOLBROOKE (COIN" D )

More jicama, Clara? And sure no

Margari-La to calm your nerves?

No thanks, I'm

Holbrooke picks up the plate and Margarita glass, then

crosses to his INDOOR COMPOSTER, adding the extra liquid

and scraps.

What does Stockton do?

Officially, he runs a bunch of these

exclusive private clubs downtown where

his high powered friends go to let their

hair down. Has one place called Le

Passage, another called The Rainbow-

e Rainbow! Stockton asked how we

Interesting. I've had some of my guys

looking into Stockton for years, but

nothing ever sticks to him. He's very

careful - ties up his loose ends and

covers his tracks. But with this... he

might have accidentally left himself

open.

The th need to do now is keep you

Aw, how is Ruth? Always thought the

world of her.

50.

And she of you.

As it comes out of her mouth, Clara realizes and guiltily

looks over at Phil BRISTLING. Holbrooke goes to a pile

of already used sheets of paper and picks one up along

with a pen.

I'll just need your full names and your

socials so I can get the paperwork

started at the bureau. Not yours, Clara.

Know that by heart.

Both Phil and Clara are taken aback.

Just kidding. But I'm sure Phil-a-buster

knows 'em both, right?

Phil looks on both sides of the paper Holbrooke hands

him.

Uh... there's already writing all over

this.

Does another tree really need to die for

me to get your socials, Phil?

Phil bites his tongue yet again, squeezing the writing

into a side of the paper.

So just one kid, guys? What's keeping

you? Clocks ticking Clara - tickety tock

tuck.

Yeah, well, that's a topic for another-

It's just that by now, you and I woulda

had a whole brood.

(under his breath)

That's... charming.

Phil scoots the paper back to Holbrooke, who squints and

dramatically turns it sideways.

w! Paging Dr. Illegible,

L.O.L,, right?

(thinking he doesn't

It's because you're writing's hard to

read, Phil, and everyone knows how when

doctors write things down-

No. Yeah. I get it.

Holbrook. makes a big show of putting his gun back

holster as he gets up.

We'll have you stay at the bureau for the

night. Safer for you.

Thank you so much, Holbrooke.

(sighs, relieved)

I feel like we're in good hands for the E

first time tonight.

As Holbrooke goes into the other room to call, Clara lets

out a sigh of relief then notices Phil's mood.

What's wrong?

I don't know. Maybe I should have had

Phil's really had enough with this guy.

Your goodness... where does it end?

Clara shoots Phil a look he back, but Holbrooke

doesn't get his sarcasm.

How I roll. Now for some reason they

wanted us to come in the back entrance.

He makes a big show of putting his gun back in his

shoulder strap before getting out of the car.

INT. FBI WINDOW

Through the window, we see Holbrooke, Phil, and Clara

walking toward the back of the building.

In the foreground, A SHADOWY GUY watches them, then

whispers into his walkie.

FBI BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Holbrooke uses a KEYCARD on his keychain with a flourish

to enter the rear of the building, then leads Phil and

Clara through the doors. Suddenly he stops and Phil and

Clara FREEZE behind them.

At the other end of the hallway, an FBI UNIT in

bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of

them. AGENT #1 in the center, obviously the agent in

charge, yells to them.

Continue slowly down the hallway.

sudden movements. Are they armed,

Peterson?

Uh,

What the hell's going o

I don't know.

53.

Well, tell them to stand down.

Uh.. .

Tell your men to stand down, Holbrooke.

His men?

The Agents look at each other and chuckle.

What do you want us to do, Holbrooke?

Reformat our hard drives?

Our badass I.T. guy!

The laughter builds.

I. I. guy?

OK... I'm not the "I.T. guy." I help out

with computer questions out of kindness!

But see if that happens anymore, Harold!

Alright, enough. Point is, Agent

Peterson scored tonight. When I typed in

those socials, an APB shot up with a

whole laundry list on these guys.

What?

crooked cop did it! It's a lie!

It's your booking, Peterson. We're Just

here to back you up.

Holbrooke...

Holbrooke looks nervously between the Agents and Phil and

Clara. He turns to them, taking Clara's arm.

Listen guys. I'll just book you and then

tomorrow we can straighten the whole-

(pulling arm away)

What? Oh no you're not!

Oooohs from the Agents.

You just gonna take that, Peterson?

All right. Didn't want to have to-

Holbrooke reaches into his holster to whip out his gun...

.but BOBBLES it and it falls to the ground, right at

Phil's feet. Looking down, Phil instinctively GRABS IT,

holding the gun to Holbrooke's head.

All right! Nobody move or he gets it!

Clara's STUNNED. The Agents look at each other, but

don't seem overly concerned.

Holbrooke has a gun? Why does he even

a have a gun?

Listen, man. I'm not that important.

I'm really not. I'm not the IT guy but

I'm just one step above him! No reason

to do something rash, all right?

You think it's even loaded?

A` -.

I don't.

loaded, guys! It's loaded!

I'm not screwing around!

He's not screwing around! He's not

screwing around!

Pulling a terrified Holbrooke, Phil and Clara back toward

the rear exit of the building. They try the door, but

it's locked.

55.

Keycard.

What?

A FEW FBI AGENTS

He wants your keycard.

Thanks. He and I, the communication

isn't great...

Getting the keychain from Holbrooke, Phil uses the

keycard then lets it fall to the floor as the door

unlocks and they back outside.

EXT. FBI BUILDING - CONT

Phil and Clara back away, keeping Holbrooke between th

and the agents. Through the door, Agents slowly creep

down the hallway after them, guns trained.

Seriously, Phil. I'm a bad shield. I

promise.

Wow, Phil!

Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise.

Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke.

When we're about to drive off we'll let

you go.

Uh, they were on the keychain.

What?

HOLB'?n`_

The key chain you dre-,~_d with the keycard

inside. The keys were on that.

And so the hero falls...

Shit.

we'll never outrun them.

56.

Searching around, Phil eyes the KEYCARD PANEL outside the

entrance. He aims the gun and FIRES, MISSING BADLY.

Both he and Holbrooke cover their ears.

AH!

YOW! Man is that loud!

As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs

the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock.

(stunned, looks at her)

How are you so good at that?

The Agents try the door, but are LOCKED IN. Agent #1

tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass,

but it's BULLETPROOF. He gestures and all the Agents

rush around to the front.

gotta get going! Quick!

Where?

They both look around, unsure.

Across the bridge a few blocks down that

street there's an entrance to the Green

Line subway. Get on it and you can get

anywhere in this city.

Phil and Clara look at him, confused.

Aren't you supposed to be our hostage?

Whatever. I don't know. Sure. What's

the difference? I'm never gonna get

behind that desk now anyway.

my gun! I dropped it in front of

everybody!

It wasn't so much of a drop. it was more

of a... bobble.

Yeah, a bobble's bad...

57.

Listen, if you just leave me here I can

tell them you ran the other way. It'll

buy you time to get there. And maybe I

can work on clearing all this up for you.

Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run

away. Suddenly Phil stops, thinking.

What?

Let me have the gun.

As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and

hands it to Holbrooke

Here. Tell them you got it back from us.

Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful.

Thanks, Phil.

As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of

husband.

EXT RIDGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

A lit up raucous PARTY BOAT in a canal starts to pass

under a roadway bridge up ahead as Phil and Clara, trying

to stay in the shadows, walk quickly toward it. Phil

glances back over their shoulders - the road is DESERTED.

it's just on the other side of that

bridge. I think we're going to make it.

He notices Clara looking at him.

What?

Nothing. That was just nice of you, back

there.

This is crazy, but you know what I'm,

reminded of right now?

Bourne identity?

58.

I'm talking about right now. When we

used to walk home late at night after

going downtown to the clubs. We couldn't

ever find a cab, remember? We'd grab

those "healthy" dogs and cheese fries at

the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler

Planetarium to watch the sunrise.

Where I held your hand for the first

time.

I can't believe we used to stay up all

night like that.

It's because we could sleep 'til noon.

If I remember correctly, we weren't

always "sleeping."

Beat as they share the moment together, walking.

I just don't understand when we got so...

I don't know...

Old.

No, I was thinking numb. When did we

become one of those couples that we used

to look at in restaurants back then and

think were so sad?

We're not that bad, Phil. I just think we

haven't been that honest with each other

recently.

Phil doesn't understa

Not big things. Just little things

keep adding up and putting this thing

between us.

Like the fact I know you never want to

talk about us having this other baby.

59.

It's not that I don't want another kid,

Clara. It's just... I used to be the

whole pie with you. And now with Ollie

and your work, I'm barely even a piece of

the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a

pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of

me's not jumping at the chance of having

the little pecan I have left of your

attention going into some new baby's

mouth!

But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home

you're the one who seems like your hardly

even there! It's all about your work.

Believe me, if you-

Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive

past them over the bridge.

Shit!

I think we're OK. Just play cool and

keep walking.

The patrol car continues across and down the street. 1i121

Phil and Clara breathe a sigh of relief.

Then suddenly, a few blocks down, BRAKE LIGHTS. The

patrol car turns around and TURNS ON ITS LIGHTS, zooming

back toward them.

Now you can say shit.

Phil looks around - they're in the middle of the bridge

with no place to run. Then he notices the lit up PARTY

BOAT coming out the other side of the bridge beneath

them.

e 's only a few feet.

What u high? No way.

But looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them,

Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the side of the bridge.

AH!

60.

As she's YANKED OVER THE SIDE, Clara CLUTCHES onto the

railing. With Phil hanging onto her other arm, they

DANGLE above the water and the boat.

Ahhh! Are you CRAZY!?!

Let go, Clara!

A GROUP of DRUNKEN PARTIERS on the boat, spotting them,

cheer below. Some even take FLASH PICTURES. Phil looks

down - if they don't let go soon they're literally going

to miss the boat.

go or I'm going to tickle you!

No you're not, Phil. We have a rule!

tickling. I'm not-

He reaches up and TICKLES Clara under her arm. She

giggles.

Ah! Stop it, Phil! Ah! It's not funny!

I mean- Stop it! Ah!

Clara can't hold on any longer...

EXT. BOAT

They land - THUMP! - onto the top deck of the boat, both

groaning as they roll back and forth while the Drunken

Partiers CHEER and FLASH PHOTOS.

Ow! I think I broke my butt.

OW! OW! Dammit, Phil! What's our rule

about tickling?

I'm sorry! I didn't do it for pleasure!

What is our rule?

61.

"It's only funny if it's funny for the

both of us."

Right! And guess what? It wasn't funny

for me, Phil!

Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm. Walking

down the side of the boat, she passes a MAN down on one

knee in front of an EXCITED WOMAN, who nods, accepting

his proposal.

B i g mistake!

They look at her, stunned.

A OTHER PART OF THE BOAT - M0_,'_= -1; LATER

Phil limps along, finally finding Clara alone and calmed

down, looking out over the rear of the boat. He comes

next to her. Beat.

T ' s your elbow?

's OK, How`s your butt?

Well, for jumping off a bridge onto a

moving boat, not so bad.

I can't even fucking believe this is

happening to us.

You know, we're kind of running ou

ons.

Maybe we could just hide or something

until this all blows over.

What makes you think it ever wil

iaybe we should just turn ourselves

62.

Imagine what it's going to be like for

Ollie when everyone hears about this

tomorrow. I bet our pictures are going

to be all over the papers.

Phil nods, gazing out. Then suddenly an idea comes to

him.

Wait. What if we found the pictures?

What do you mean?

These pictures that everyone's after.

we could get them we'd have some kind o

bargaining chip to get out of this.

But then we'd have to find the Gales.

don't know anything about them.

Except... the Rainbow.

The pictures have something to do with

that place!

Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these

clubs are so secret you have to know

where they are and how to get in-

Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone,

dialing, then notices Phil looking out, shaking his head.

What?

You're not listening to me again!

"You have to know where they are and h

to get in-"

That's great. Clara wanna cracker?

63.

I'm calling because of what you said,

Phil. I know who can help us.

Clara dials the number.

Hey Jane, it's Clara.

Where am I?

(beat, looks around)

I'm... I'm on a party cruise around

Chicago. Oh yeah. It is turning into

quite a night. Listen, we need to go to

this club called the Rainbow later. Do

you know how we can get in?

Clara looks at Phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her

ear and listens. Phil watches her until he notices the

boat IS TURNING. He looks around the side.

A slew of POLICE CARS on the shore. He taps Clara.

ara...

Clara turns and looks.

Oh shoot. You know what Jane? I've

actually gotta jump off right now.

INT. TOUR BOAT - LATER

POLICE swarm all over the tour boat, checking every

compartment. A DRUNKEN PARTIER shows Lieutenant Manning

SNAPSHOTS of Phil and Clara landing, groaning, and

arguing on the back of his digital camera. A POLICEMAN

comes up to Manning and shakes his head.

Check again.

Manning pockets the camera and starts to walk away.

Hey! That's mine, man!

Evidence.

The Partier mumbles "Asshole" as he stumbles

Manning si i.s and looks out over the wa

64.

EXT. STREET - LATER

It's WINDY and COLD as Phil and Clara, soaked, squeak and

slosh down the street. Clara, missing one heel, dumps

water out of her purse as she checks her cellphone.

Mine's totally shot too.

You got the info from her though, right?

Yeah, but we can't get in looking like

this, Phil.

I don't think we have a choice. Not a

big shopping hour.

They walk past the 24 CHICAGO FITNESS CENTER, lights

blazing. Windows show machines filled with young

HARDBODIES working out.

Now if we wanted to do a little cardio,

on the other hand. Who knew that many

people worked out at 1 in the morning?

Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks

back up at the building.

You wanna do a little cardio?

Clara smirks at him, then Phil, thinking, gets it. He

shakes his head.

OK, now that's scary. You know you're

starting to think like a real criminal?

You know that, don't you?

Clara waggles her eyebrows. We hear Devo's "Secret Agent

Man" over a TrC _ GE .

INT. 24 HOUR FITNESS CENTER - MONTAGE

- Phil and Clara walk up to the front counter, where the

GYM GREETER boredly watches TV. They say something and

the Greeter waves them through without looking up. As

they hurry on, the Greeter's TV goes to a PROMO TEASER

for the local late night news: a SNAPSHOT of Phil and

Clara from the boat with a caption that reads: BONNIE AND

CLOD?!?

65.

- In the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil pulls at the COMBINATION

LOCKS, searching for an open locker. Unable to find one,

he picks up a bench to throw it at them when TWO JOCKS in

workout clothes walk in and look at him strangely as he

holds the bench. Phil moves the bench back and forth,

pretending it's part of his EXERCISE ROUTINE.

- In the WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Clara, wrapped in a towel,

blows out her hair at the mirror. An ATTRACTIVE THIN

WOMAN walks behind her toward the showers and they smile

at each other in the mirror. As the THIN WOMAN

disappears behind the shower glass, Clara makes a MAD

DASH for the lockers.

- Back in the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil lingers as a MAN IN

A DARK SUIT undresses, getting ready to work out. As the

man is about to lock his locker, Phil rushes up to him,

excitedly telling him something and pointing outside.

The man, confused, exits, and Phil MOVES IN, quickly

undressing.

- The Attractive Thin Woman comes back to her locker and

opens it. Her face drops. Inside hang CL A"S DRIPPING

CLOTHES.

- OUTSIDE THE GYM, Phil, looking slick in a colored shirt

and black suit, walks quickly around the corner, then

stops, stunned. Clara, waiting for him with her hair

blown out and in a tight fitting RED FLAPPER DRESS with a

RED HEELS, looks AMAZING. From her expression, she feels

the same about Phil.

EXT. ALLEY - LATER

Looking both ways, Phil and Clara walk nervously down a

dark, derelict alley.

Down here?

It's what she said.

And if you die, does Jane get your

commissic-l on the open house?

Up ahead, a TWO S:_=:Y LOOKING CHARACTERS huddle near a

bunch of GARBAGE CANS watching them, a SMALL FIRE nearby.

Nervously, Clara approaches.

Excuse me?

Men shoot her a fierce look.

66.

Um... do you know which is the way back

to Kansas?

They eye her, then inspect Phil up and down. One of them

LUNGES, and Phil jumps back...

but he's moving aside some trash cans, revealing a

RAINBOW COLORED STAIRWAY going down.

Welcome to the Rainbow.

INT. THE RAINBOW - LATER

Reaching the bottom of the stairway, Phil and Clara,

amazed, take in THE RAINBOW.

It's a CAVERNOUS ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION that's been

converted into a GLAMOROUS CLUB. The place is PACKED

with an elite looking CROWD. Everything in the room -

the carpet, the tapestries, the clothes of the waitstaff -

is EMERALD GREEN.

Phil and Clara nod at each other then separate,

disappearing into the mix.

INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW - SAME

Phil looks around, amazed as he wanders between BLACKJACK

and BACCARAT tables, where well-to-do OLDER guests gamble

large sums of money, fast looking WOMEN cheering them on.

VOICE (O.S.)

If you wanner be pissed at anyone about

it, be pissed at Stockton...

Hearing the name, Phil spots a BALDING MAN talking to 2

other MEN at one of the tables. He lingers closer.

You know, rumor is he's behind the whole

mess. Raking it in on both ends.

What do you mean?

Hush hush shell companies he owns. One

of them hires all the construction

inspectors. Another he's got rents all

the construction equipment. The more one

slows things down with violations,

more the other takes to the bank.

67.

The Balding Man leans in and speaks more quietly, causing

Phil to lean in even more.

BALDING MAN (CONT'D)

My guess is he's trying to screw up Mayor

Diggs' reelection. Imagine what someone

like him could do if he got someone less

"squeaky clean" in the Mansion.

The Balding Man suddenly notices Phil listening. Phil

pastes on an excited face.

you! Gale, right?

What?

Sorry. From the side... confused you

with somebody else.

Phil quickly moves on.

INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW -

Clara talks to a BUSY BARTENDER at the bar as he

scrambles to fill drink orders.

BA --Y_-_.

really get s,-.y names.

Thanks any-way.

With a sigh, Clara starts away from the bar, when she

FREEZES.

ough the crowd, FRANK and HARRY walk right toward her -

but they haven't seen her yet. Clara spots the KITCHEN

DOORS nearby and rushes through.

INT. KITCHEN - C vUOUS

Clara peeks out through the double door windows. Frank

and Harry continue through the crowd, unaware.

VOICE (O.S.)

Watch it!

Clara quickly hugs a large bulletin board covered with

pictures and time schedules as a WAITER carries a large

tray of food past her.

68.

As she moves off the wall, some papers drop. Clara pins

them back on, when something else on the bulletin board

catches her eye...

.Among all the snapshots of staff scattered on the

bulletin board is a picture of a backyard party with a

whole group of laughing young people, and the middle of

the picture, smiling at the camera...

. is THE NERVOUS WOMAN FROM THE SIGNATURE ROOM

BATHROOM.

Clara pulls the picture off the wall. She catches a

WAITRESS coming back through the double doors.

Excuse me. Does she work here?

Dora? I guess she still does. Hasn't

been showing up lately, though.

Do you know where I can find her?

You could try back tomorrow, see if she-

I need to find her tonight.

Did you try Ray's place?

Ray?

That sleazebag boyfriend of hers. He's

got that place a few blocks from here

where he used to throw those after work

parties.

Do you remember where it is?

ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW

Phil scans the crowds, back and forth.

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Phil!

Hearing his name, Phil nervously turns. MR. RIVERS and

GEORGE stand together in a corner.

69.

hit.

MR. RIVERS

This is a surprise! What are you doing

down here?

Uh... well, same thing as you guys, I

would guess. Working those "extra

hours," right?

CLARA (O.S.)

Phil!

Clara, looking amazing in her red flapper dress, weeds

through the crowd. Mr. Rivers and George take her in,

obviously impressed.

Phil, we gotta go. I found out where-

Clara, you remember Mr. Rivers?

Clara suddenly notices Phil's boss.

Oh. Oh. Yeah.

And I'm George.

Sorry, but I've got to steal him. We've

gotta be somewhere else right now.

MR. RIVERS

At 2 in the morning? Where are you guys

headed?

I'm sorry, Mr. Rivers. We really can

talk about it.

Phil and Clara move off quickly through the crowd as Mr.

Rivers watches the hand_i12__e, dressed up couple,

intrigued.

MR. RIVERS

Phil Foster with places to go he can

talk about at 2 in the morning.

70.

MR. RIVERS (CONT'D)

You know what makes kangaroos so damn

dangerous, George? They look so sweet

and tame, so you forget they're wild

animals. Lethal when they want to be.

George, not fully understanding, chuckles and holds out

his hand for another handshake, but Mr. Rivers, still

watching Phil, LEAVES HIM HANGING.

CLOSEUP ON A TV MONITOR

A TV MONITOR IMAGE of Phil and Clara making their way

through the crowd to the exit.

In the dark room, Frank and Harry look expectantly to the

well dressed man in a dark suit, who absently twirls with

two metal balls in his hand.

MR. STOCKTON

See where they take you.

EXT. RUN DOWN ROW HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

Phil and Clara knock on the door of a the deserted

looking row house. No answer. Clara tries the door...

That never really-

OPENS. She shoots Phil a look.

OK. Never mind.

Phil and Clara inch insi

RUN DOWN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

As they start down the dark hallway to the living room,

Phil hunches over, hugging the wall.

are you bent over like that?

sneaking.

CLA?.A

Rut why don't you just walk normally and

quietly?

This is the wav I sneak. You sneak in

your way and I'll sneak in mine, OK?

71.

OK. Fine. I was just asking.

Clara walks quietly behind crouching Phil. Reaching the

living room, they spot TWO PACKED SUITCASES on the couch.

Suddenly, the DOOR SLAMS behind them and RAY holds a gun

to Phil's head, DORA nervously next to him.

Talk! Who are you?

You know, that's like the 5th gun I've

had to my head tonight! Just lower that

thing and cool it, OK?

Off guard from Phil's reaction, Ray, confused, does.

She was in the bathroom at the

restaurant!

Who are you?

Who are we? Good question! Well,

everybody thinks we're "the Gales"

because we were lucky enough to take your

reservation tonight!

What? Why would you take our

reservation?

Phil shoots Clara a look.

Don't.

Both of you. Stand ov there in the

corner. Dammit Dora, ere's your

goddamn brother? He was E,.--,-Dc.-zed to b

here an hour ago!

I don't know, Ra_, He's not answering

his phone.

Yeah, well, if these guys found u

long do you think it's gonna take

other guys? We're dead! DEAD!

72.

Excuse me.

In the corner, Clara raises her hand. Ray eyes her

strangely.

Sorry. I have to pee.

You have to nee?

Clara nods. Phil shrugs.

That's my wife.

Flustered, Ray waves Dora to take Clara.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dora talks to Clara as she washes her face in the sink.

You must just think I'm awful.

I don't think anything about you. I just

want this to be over.

Ray saw Mr. Stockton making all this

money blackmailing people at the club.

When he found out who was interested in

me... he said it would be so easy. We'd

never have to work again.

RAY (O.S.)

HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PEE, GUYS?!?

We're coming!

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Ray peeks nervously out of the window, searching the

street.

Listen, it looks like things didn't turn

out the way you planned, but I think all

Stockton wants is his pictures back. As

soon as he gets them I bet-

73.

Stockton's pictures? You.think they're

Stockton's pictures?

You really have no idea what you've

gotten into, do you?

BOOM! The window SHATTERS and Ray and Phil hit the deck.

As Ray starts blindly firing back, Phil crawls on his

knees and elbows across the floor toward the bathroom.

CLARA (O.S.)

PHIL?!?!

I'm OK! I'm OK!

Ray spots Phil crawling away and gets up, turning to him.

Hey! Get-

Suddenly, Ray is SHOT IN THE ARM through the window. He

drops to the ground in pain, yelling and clutching his

arm.

Ahh!

Phil crabs along even faster.

INT. BATHROOM

Clara rushes to the bathroom door, pulling Phil inside

and locking it.

As Clara focuses on Phil, Dora thinks fast, taking an

ELOPE out of her purse and putting it into Clara's

bout them seeing.

Oh God! Are you hit?

No... just... a little ... winded...

that... crawling's... tough... on the

core...

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

As Harry kicks the gun away from Ray, moaning on the

floor, Frank comes to the bathroom door. He lightly raps

on it, then speaks softly.

74.

How about you guys let me in before

someone gets really hurt?

INT. BATHROOM

Dora quickly opens the window and gestures for Phil and

Clara to climb through. Just as they squeeze outside...

BAM! The door handle's BLOWN OFF and Frank kicks the

door in. He grabs Dora, rushing toward the window, but

Phil and Clara are GONE.

Dammit!

Frank eyes Dora, then SHOOTS HER IN THE FOOT, sending

screaming to the ground in pain.

You stay put.

He hurries back through the house.

FRONT OF RUN DOWN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Phil and Clara sprint to the street as a BUICK pulls up

in front and a confused looking CHUBBY GUY steps

Hey? Which is 357 Maple Street?

You're Dora's brother?

Who are you?

You're late!

OK sorry! The roads are all screwed

with all this construction-

BOOM! They wince as a SHOT hits the rearview mirror of

the car. All three spin to see Frank aiming his gun and

marching toward them, Harry right behind him.

CHUBBY GUY (CONT'D)

Hey!

Phil quickly pushes Dora's brother aside as he and Clara

hop into the Buick and PEEL OUT.

75.

Frank and Harry SPRINT for their Towncar down the block.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

Phil screeches the car around the corner.

Phil! Careful!

Phil WHIPS the car around another bend.

Please, Phil! It's not going to do any

good if you-

(taking another sharp turn)

Clara! Please! Just leave the driving

to me, OK?!? I know what I'm-

SMASH! - they HIT something head-on, SHATTERING the

windshield.

face to face - nose to nose - with another broken

windshield. In the driver's seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA

h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG BLACK DUDE a

stares at them in shock.

No no no. Tell me you did not just do

that.

Shit!

The Black Dude gets out of his car to inspect, head in

hands.

Oh, man! You did not just do that!

Whew, you gonna be payin' for this!

owe you one.

Phil throws the car into reverse, but his tires just

screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place.

Looking out his window toward the front, Phil sees that

THE SMASHED FRONT GRILL OF THEIR CAR HAS INTERLOCKED WITH

ASHED FRONT GRILL OF THE BLACK DUDE'S HONDA. _-M

The Black Dude comes toward him.

76,

Oh no no no. You're gonna get outta this

car and hand me over a license and some

insurance. We gonna do this right. Man,

I think I got whiplash and shit.

A SCREECH. Phil looks back to see FRANK AND HARRY'S

TOTnNCAR coming around the corner.

Shit.

Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car and hops into

the Black Dude's souped up Honda.

Hey! HEY! What do you think you're

doing?

The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver's

door, but Phil's LOCKED it. Phil yells to Clara.

PUT IT IN REVERSE AND GUN IT, CLARA!

What? That's insane!

Frank and Harry's car SPEEDS TOWARDS THEM. It will smash

into them in seconds...

I KNOW IT IS! BUT DO IT!

Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to

reverse, and guns it. At the same moment, Phil steps on

the gas.

The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS

as he's THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY

SHAMMY BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The

Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield

into the passenger's seat next to Phil.

JESUS CHRIST! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH

YOU?!!

NOW PUT IT IN DRIVE!

Huh?

JESUS! JESUS!

77.

PUT IT IN DRIVE NOW!

Phil, this is-

JESUS JESUS!

DO IT!

(to Black Dude)

AND YOU! CUT THE JESUS!

Mumbling angrily, Clara puts her car in drive and steps

on it. Their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels

smoke and speed up in the OTHER DIRECTION. They race

past Frank again, who angrily whips the Towncar around in

pursuit.

Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their

conjoined cars down the middle of the street, but he and

Clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer :ildly

back and forth. They hit the curb at an angle and -JcK

DOWN a whole row of mail boxes until Phil spins h--'-s v;:-reel,

getting them back into the street.

Just let me out, OK? You can have it! 1i121

You can have it!

DAMMIT! TRY TO KEEP IT STRAIGHT CLARA!

STOP YELLING AT ME!

I'm not yelling! I'm just talking in an

very animated voice!

Looking back over his shoulder again, Phil sees they're

approaching the lar

ge intersection with Michigan Avenue.

OK, now when I say so, spin your wheel!

NOW!

On his command, Clara spins her wheel sharply to t1-

right., but it's the wrong way and their cars JACK

across the road. An ONCOMING SUV honks desperately.

Ahhhh! Other way! Other way!

78.

Flustered, Clara WHIPS her wheel in the other direction,

and their two cars tilt up on four wheels (out of eight),

barely screeching past.

Landing again and taking in a deep breath, Phil shoots

her a pissed off look.

What? You just said spin the wheel,

Phil! You didn't say which way.

Yes I did!

No you didn't!

She's right! You di

God! Thank you! Can we take him home?

I need him!

Both Phil and the Black Dude sees that the Towncar's

turned onto Michigan Avenue and is still right behind

E them.

I say our best chance is to reverse

again, then use both engines to floor

as fast as we can all the way down

Michigan.

Why stay on Michigan?

Why stay on Michigan? Because it's a

wider street.

It's also a busier street! I think it

would be better to try to branch off.

Why do you have a problem with every

route I take?

Flustered, Phil turns to the Black Dude next to him to

commiserate, unaware that his STEERING WHEEL DRIFTS.

79.

She does this wherever we go! Every

time!

Phil doesn't notice the LIGHTS GROWING BRIGHTER behind

him..

PHIL!

LOUD HONNNNNNNKKKKKK. Phil and the Black Dude look over

their shoulders to see they're heading straight for a

DELIVERY TRUCK.

PHIL, CLARA AND BLACK DUDE

AHHHH!

Phil SPINS the wheel sharply and they go SIDEWAYS,

jumping the curb and soaring into MILLENNIUM PARK.

In their car following them, Frank and Harry's -mouths

drop.

EXT. MCCORMICK ICE RINK

The conjoined cars sail across the

grass and SMASH

THROUGH a barrier, landing on the MCCORMICK ICE RINK.

Their cars PINWHEEL OUT OF CONTROL across the ice. Phil,

Clara, and the Black Dude are all WIDE EYED as the world

is a SPINNING BLUR around them.

Finally, they hit the other side. Getting his bearings,

Phil sees the Towncar has entered the park after them.

He searches where to go next, then spots something.

Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight

put your foot to the floor. Give it

everything!

Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors

it. The car goes faster... faster...

Oooh. I really woulc_n.'t be doing that.

Doing what? What are you doing?!?

Clara glances over her shoulder. Their heading strai

toward a CONCRETE STAIRWAY.

CL. (CONT'D)

Oh God.

80.

Just trust me!

The conjoined cars HIT the steps and their wheels SMOKE

as the TWO ENGINES POWER TOGETHER ALL THE WAY UP THE

STAIRWAY!

The Towncar tries the follow them, but its single engine

doesn't have enough power. Swearing under his breath,

Frank reverses back down the steps.

EXT. CLOUD GATE

Phil and the Black Guy both look back over their

shoulders as they speed by Anish Kapoor's large metallic

CLOUD GATE. No sign of the Towncar. The Black Guy holds

up his hand for Phil.

Ha HA! That last move was wicked, man.

Wicked.

They try to give each other a fancy handshake, but Phil,

the WHITEST MAN EVER, muddles it up.

a Sorry.

s cool.

They're back.

They peek again over their shoulders. The Towncar's

driven around and is now BACK ON THEIR TAILS.

Jesus! What the hell are you guys in

trouble for?

f i ght... you name it.

EXT. GREAT LAWN

Phil and Clara's conjoined cars barrel across the gr ss

of the Great Lawn in Millennium park, then SPIN onto

Columbus Drive, the Towncar giving chase.

EXT. COLUMBUS DRIVE

Phil peeks back over his shoulder then sighs, looking at

Clara.

Can we just try to work together at this?

I'm not blaming you. Please?

Clara nods.

Now whatever direction I give you, take

your normal version of it and tone it

down like 85 percent, OK?

35 percent. Fine.

OK. Small left. Now!

Clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel slightly lefts

They ZOOM around the corner.

Yes! That was awesome! Perfect, Clara!

Now give me a medium right. Do it!

She does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another

street.

Yes!

Now we're cooking with fire!

Now tiny le

CL AP.A

You act it!

They make the slightest turn.

82.

Yes!

(spotting something ahead)

No.

Oh no.

What?

Clara turns around to look. LIGHTS FLASH as a BARRIER

comes down across the road - A DRAWBRIDGE ahead is slowly

rising.

Phil looks behind - the Towncar's got them closed in.

The Black Dude peeks back as well, then turns to Phil.

say we can pop you guys up and over.

Excuse me? What are you talking about,

"pop you guys up and over?"

You climb over, then we both reverse it

and leadfoot the motherfuckers. Send you

flying over the top.

What?

Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control of the car back

to the Black Dude. As the conjoined cars zoom toward the

drawbridge, Phil CRAWLS ON THE ATTACHED HOODS FROM ONE

WINDSHIELD TO THE OTHER, sitting next to Clara.

Phil, don't even think of it.

can do it. Clara.

No, Phil. We can't! It's suicide!

Here we go now... One... two... THREE!

NO!

83.

But Phil reaches over and switches the gear to reverse,

stepping on Clara's foot to GUN IT.

AHHHH!

The two cars SMOKE as their wheels spin in opposite

directions, then DISLODGE. Phil and Clara's car flies

reverse UP ONE SIDE OF THE DIAGONAL DRAWBRIDGE...

.and LANDS SPINNING IN A FLURRY OF SPARKS OVER ON THE

OTHER SIDE, causing AIR BAGS to deploy all around Phil

and Clara.

The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing his

Honda across the road, and PUTS ON HIS SEAT BELT. Frank

and Harry's eyes go wide as Frank jams on his brakes, but

the Towncar CRASHES right into the Honda.

ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank

and Harry.

Hope you all got insurance.

Hitting a button, he starts a FIBER-OPTIC LIGHT SHOW on

his Honda.

INT. PHIL AND CL ARA' S CAR - CONTINUOUS

As their car comes to a SMOKING, SPINNING STOP in the

middle of the deserted road, Phil sandwiched in air bags,

catches his breath.

We did it! We did it!

A DOOR SLAM. Phil moves an air bag aside to see Clara

MARCHING AWAY down the street.

EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Phil rushes after Clara, trying to catch up.

Where are you going?

I want to make sure that at least one

our son's parents survives tonight!

What?

84.

You almost just got us killed!

I see. I almost got us killed. Forget

about the people chasing and shooting at

us all night long because of the

reservation you stole.

There's a difference between fleeing from

people shooting at you and knowingly

driving a car in reverse over an open

drawbridge!

Unbelievable! You know, all you complain

about is that I don't take risks anymore.

Then the second I do, you get mad at me

for doing it! I can't win with you!

Poor Phil! You have i so bad, don't

you!

Oh, you have no idea! Every single day

from the moment we wake up you're bossy,

a disapproving, inconsiderate-

I'm inconsiderate? I'M INCONSIDERATE?!?

Have you ever seen our bathroom in the

morning after Tsunami Phil's blown

through? The floor! The sink! You use

my toothbrush.

What's the difference? Afraid you're

gonna get my cooties?

I want my own toothbrush, Phil! Sue me!

And how many years have I asked you to do

a simple thing like put the toilet paper

in right?

Listen to yourself! You have problems

with how I pqt in the toilet paper!

Because under makes no sense, Phil!

Under makes no sense! When it's under it

doesn't pull off right! It just keeps

spinning and spinning and doesn't cascade

properly!

85.

After ten years of asking you to have

roll the right way, you still can't do

it!

Yeah, how about the fact that I have not

woken up with our comforter over me once

in those 10 nears! You steal the whole

thing away from me every night and

mummify yourself.

What? Phil, I do not "steal" the

comforter. It just happens when we're-

(points at her)

Bulls Bull-shit.

Don't you point that at me!

I see your hock leg lock maneuver. Don't

think I don't!

You wrap that leg around and lock the

comforter down then reeeeel it in so I

can't pull it at all.

I do not leg lock the comforter!

Oh yes you do!

u think I don't know your little

icks? Where you leave like half a

thimble of milk in the carton and put it

back in the fridge so you don't have to

be the one to "finish" it and replace it?

You're right. I do that. You know why

do that, Clara?

Because you don't want to haul your

ass to the market to buy it yourself!

Because I'm afraid to! God forbid I

the wrong kind of grass-fed bio

homogenized whatever and meet your wrath!

You're like the Nutrition Nazi.

86.

PHIL (CONT' D )

And I've got to be your little Nutrition

Nazi Goebbels because we have to be this

"united front" with Ollie! What's wrong

if he eats two bowls of Captain Sugar

instead of one? Or if his handwriting

isn't perfect? Or if he goes to school

for one day not dressed like Finneas J.

Nerdo!

Poor Phil. I feel so sorry for you. I

must be hard having to be the cool fun

parent while I get to be the one who

makes sure our child's fed, clothed and

SURVIVES!

How would you even know? You don't give

me or anyone else a chance! You're so

goddamn controlling! You've got to be

Wonder Woman, keeping everyone in line,

looking down on them from her fancy

Wonder Woman plane and controlling

everything with all her wonder

superpowers! You paint yourself as this

victim but you get off on being the

superlady!

Urgh! You know w sometimes I don't pay

attention to you, Phil? Because you give

me a headache!

Clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a

frustrated sigh.

What? No aspirin in the wonderpurse?

How could it be?

Clara, furious, HURLS her purse at Phil's head. He ducks

and the contents spill all over the road.

Screw you, Phil!

Yeah, fine! Sure! Screw me ! Even if I

survive tonight I'm screwed all around

anyway! Screwed with you! Screwed with

my job!

What are you talking about, screwed with

your job?

87.

was supposed to spend all tonight

guring out a new brilliant plan for the

fund so George wouldn't take it over

tomorrow. Doesn't look like that's gonna

happen!

Why didn't you tell me?

I don't know, Clara. Maybe because I

didn't want you chiming in on how Mr.

Rivers was right. He wants the new guy

for all the reasons you complain about

me! Someone who doesn't "play it safe."

Someone who'll "take a risk."

I can't believe that's what you think

do.

Yeah, well...

You know, when you set up this whole

"magical" night, in that dress... I got

this glimmer that it was going to be like

it used to be with us. But... I don't

know. I guess we're just not those

people anymore.

I guess we're not.

Shaking his head, Phil turns and walks away do-- the

street. Clara, trying to hold it together, h

and starts to gather the items from her purse

something catches his eye. She picks up the

ENVELOPE that Dora put in her bag.

EXT. ROADWAY - MOMENTS LATER

As Phil walks along, Clara comes running up behind him.

Phil! Phil!

She steps in front of him, trying to catch her breath.

I think we said all needs to be said

right now, Clara.

Panting, Clara holds out the manila envelope.

88.

This... this... this...

What?

Side cramp... Wow.

She hands Phil the manila envelope and bends down, trying

to stop her cramp. Confused, Phil opens it and looks at

the pictures inside. His brow furrows.

What is it?

Clara looks over his shoulder, shakes her head and TURNS

THE PICTURE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Phil's eyes go wide.

Oh jeez. It's... it's...

It's the Mayor.

Phil looks at Clara, taking it all in.

PHIL (V.0.)

I bet this didn't have anything to do

with Stockton at first.

EXT. DESERTED STREETS - LATER

Phil and Clara walk quickly down the street as they piece

things together.

The Mayor must have gone to Stockton's

club one night. He saw Dora working

there and obviously gave some sign that

he was interested.

So much for "Mr. Squeaky Clea

Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and

convinces her to take him up on it so

they could photograph it and blackmail

him.

They knew it was an election year and he

would have to pay them whatever they

asked.

89.

But somehow Stockton found out about the

photos too and wanted that power over the

mayor himself.

So he sent his guys to the restaurant to

intercept the Gales and get the photos.

But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed

before the Mayor even had a chance to

show up.

Phil thinks. He snaps his fingers.

What?

If we could find some way to get in touch

with the mayor directly, without anyone

else knowing, there actually might be a

way out of this for us.

Clara thinks for a moment. A light comes to her eyes.

can.

DOORMAN BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT

Phil and Clara walk into the lobby of the doorman

building and start toward the elevator, straight past the

NIGHT DOORMAN.

Whoa whoa whoa. Where do you

you're going?

Oh, we're guests of Apartment 605

The Doorman picks up the phone to call the apartmen

And you are?

looks at him in shock.

Are you crazy? It's 4 in the morning!

90.

I'm not really allowed to just let you up

there.

Please. Just look at us!

The Doorman looks at Phil and Clara - a white, well

dressed suburban couple.

OK. Yeah. Go ahead.

The elevator door opens and they get inside.

Have a nice night.

You too.

As the elevator doors close, Phil and Clara look at each

other, then simultaneously slip PAPER BAGS with EYE and

MOUTH HOLES over their heads.

INT. MRS. CARDIGAN'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Mrs. Cardigan, in her frilly nightgown with her eyemask

pulled up on her forehead, walks through her dark living

room toward the POUNDING on her front door.

PHIL (O.S.)

GAS AK LADY! OPEN UP!

MRS. CARDIGAN

All right. All-

As Mrs. Cardigan opens the door, Phil and Clara, in their

masks, BUM RUSH her. Screaming, Cardigan dodges, running

back to her desk. Phil and Clara give chase, but

Cardigan grabs a LARGE METAL YARDSTICK and starts

WHOPPING PHIL over and over on his paper bag head,

screaming the whole time.

AHHHHH!

OW! OW! OW!

Clara grabs her from behind, bringing her down.

rubs his paper bag head.

9i.

Jesus!

INT. CARDIGAN'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Having put Cardigan's eyenask back over her eyes, Clara,

bag off, holds Cardigan in a chair as Phil comes back

into the living room holding two spools of FUZZY YARN.

I can't find any rope. Only yarn.

Yarn? Fine. Just use that. I'll start

looking.

Phil gets to work, wrapping the yarn over and over, tying

Cardigan's arms to the back of the chair, while Clara

searches Cardigan's desk.

MRS. CARDIGAN

You two weren't very prepared.

Excuse me?

MRS. CARDIGAN

You should have been more prepared.

Thought ahead and brought the rope

you.

OK, why don't you lay off the critiqu

's not a critique. It's a fact.

Oh is it a fact?

MRS. CARDIGA?

Yes. ng word choice.

Wrong word choice? Unbelievable! Well,

let me throw a little word choice

"correction" your way.

Partner!

Five year old kids can't be

"antagonistic."

92.

Phil looks over. Clara makes the "Cut it out" gesture

across her throat.

If you're done tying her up, come over

and help.

Phil crosses the room and starts going through notebooks

on the desk.

MRS. CARDIGAN

The name's Cardigan, not Rockefeller, if

you haven't figured it out yet! What

idiots!

You must be such a positive influence on

our youth.

MRS. CARDIGAN

You're one to talk!

Partner!

1i121 Listen, lady, just sit tight and we'll be

out of here before you know it.

Phil picks up and flips quickly through a notebook, when

he spots something and doubles back, starting to read.

His brow furrows.

Clara, deep in her own workbook, suddenly brightens.

Got it!

She notices Phil's expression.

CLARA (CONT ' D )

What?

hands the book to Clara to read. She does and

darkens.

Oliver told her he's being mean to Je y

Briggs because... he says he wants to

marry her?

And that's what married people do.

93.

As this hits them, Phil and Clara look at each other,

then at Mrs. Cardigan, blindfolded in the living room.

MRS. CARDIGAN

What's wrong over there? No "crown

jewels" yet?

Let's make the call,

INT. MAYOR REYNOLD'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The PHONE RINGS in Mayor Reynold's bedroom. He hops up

and peers at the clock - 4:30 am - then at the caller ID.

CARDIGAN, L. He looks over at his wife who snores loudly

with earplugs in, then picks up the phone, confused.

Lucy? Is everything OK?

INT. CARDIGAN'S APARTMENT - SAME

On the phone in Cardigan's office, Phil is confused.

Lucy? Who's Lucy?

MRS. CARDIGAN

I'm Lucy.

(stunned',

You and the Mayor are on a first name

basis?

MRS. CARDIGAN

You're calling our Mayor in the middle of

the night?

I had nothing to do with this Charlie!

Charlie?!? Lucy!?!? _ appened to

"Aboundaries matter?az =_.h? What happened

to that, bitch?

Hey "partner." How about you put a sock

in it now.

Who is this ? r1

94.

You don't know me, Mr. Mayor, but I've

recently come into possession of

something that you were supposed to get

from the Gales tonight.

Silence on the line.

Hello?

And?

And whether you realize it or not, we

ended up doing you a favor. You see,

this man named Mr. Stockton - I

know if you know him-

MAYOR DIGGS (PH(

I know who he is.

Well, he tried to steal the photos from

the Gales. He's even got cops on his

payroll helping him out. We think he was

planning to sabotage your re-election.

MAYOR DIGGS (PHONE)

So what do you want for them?

What do we want?

Phil looks at Clara.

We just want our lives back. We want to

go home, Mr. Mayor.

INT. MAYOR'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Mayor looks over nervously as his wife stirs. She

goes back to snoring and he whispers into the phone

again.

That's it.

Mayor Diggs breathes out and rubs his forehead.

MAYOR DIGGS E

If you really can get me... what I was

supposed to receive earlier without this

getting out, I promise you I'll take care

of your safety.

But now the police think that-

Trust me. Get me the photos and he won't

be bothering you again.

INT. CARDIGAN'S OFFICE

Clara sees Phil furrow his brow, confused.

is it?

Phil's concentrating hard on something. Thinking.

MAYOR DIGGS (PHONE)

Uh... yeah. We'll meet you at the Adler

Planetarium in 1 hour. Come alone. E

Of course. And... thank you.

ON STOCKTON'S MONITOR in front of him we see that Frank

and Harry hold a wounded Ray and Dora in the meat locker.

MAYOR DIGGS (PHONE)

They thought you were stealing the photos

from the Gales to try to blackmail me

yourself.

MR. STOCKTON

Did they, now? That's great.

MAYOR DIGGS (PHONE)

They're going to meet me in an hour with

them. Alone.

MR. STOCKTON

st keeps getting better.

ADLER PLANETARIUM - LATER

Phil and Clara sit silently on the steps of the

beautiful, old Alder Planetarium looking at dawn hitting

the CHICAGO SKYLINE.

Man, I love this city. Always have.

When was the last time we watched the

sunrise together?

Probably the last time we were here.

Nope. it wasn't. It was the morning

that Ollie was born.

CT,ARA

You're The morning Ollie was

born.

They look at each other, remembering.

Man, I'm starving!

Me too.

Sorry you never got your truffles.

97.

Clara reaches into her purse.

Who needs white truffles when you've got

a lemon zest Luna bar.

Clara breaks it in two and hands half to Phil. They

click the halves together, toasting each other, then

silently chew, looking out. Phil shakes his head and

starts GIGGLING.

What?

OK, what happened to us tonight?

the hell are we doing here?

Clara starts laughing too.

It's not funny.

No, I know it's not funny. It's not

funny at all.

en why are you laughing?

Why are you laughing?

They're both cracking up... then Phil notices a moment

later that Clara's laughter has turned to

Wha e gonna be OK, Cla

CLP--P, A

No. It's not that. just... this is

nice. Right now.

(tears up again)

You don't understand... I really don't

want to be Wonder Woman, Phil! I don't

At all!

You don't see that this whole time I'm

flying in a glass plane! In a glass

Mane!

Uh, OK, but I think Wonder Woman actua

flies an invisible plane, not a glass

plane.

98.

This makes Clara break into a bigger round of sobs.

You see! It isn't even there at all! I

don't even have a plane! No plane! I'm

running on fumes!

You're not running on fumes, Clara.

I'm not trying to be uptight, or

controlling! Or a nutrition...

Nazi.

Nazi! I'm just trying the only way I

know how to keep everything from fall

apart!

It won't fall apart. And I really can

help whenever you feel like it is. With

Ollie. Whatever. You just never act

like you need me to.

That's because as it is you see us as a

distraction from your work!

You think I see you guys as a

distraction? God no, Clara.

You don't understand... I have this wife

who does everything better than anyone

I've ever known. And the greatest son.

You want to know why I obsess so much

about my stupid job? Because I want to

feel like... like I can do something good

enough to deserve someone like you. I

mean, I look at you and I jest don't

stack up.

That's crazy, Phil. You do. You're a

god man. You're the best man I know.

I'll never be the guy who remembers

always put toilet paper on the right way.

99.

I don't think I would really want to be

with that guy, Phil. I just... want us

to be on the same team again.

As Clara sniffles, Phil takes this in for a beat. He

nods.

Listen, you know what I said before,

about not being the people we used to be?

Phil, we were angry-

No, Clara. It's true. We're not. And I

know I'm going to drive you crazy again,

and you're definitely going to drive me

crazy. But I wouldn't want to do it with

anybody else.

He hugs her tight.

We had a good fight tonight, didn't we?

Yeah, we did. You know the worst part

about not talking about all this

recently?

What?

We missed out on a lot of make up sex.

And our make up sex woulda rocked!

You think?

Oh yeah.

Phil s when he spots something behind Clara.

MAYOR DIGGS looks both walks from his car in

the parking lot toward the--.

Here we go.

Tell me now. Do you need to pee?

1 hold it.

100.

They get up and start walking down the steps to meet him.

EXT. BOTTOM OF STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

Phil and Clara meet the Mayor at the bottom of the steps.

Clara takes the manila envelope out of her purse, handing

it to him.

This is what you're looking for. I've

tten down our information inside.

And that's it?

That's it. We're going home now.

The Mayor nods, and Phil and Clara start walking past him

toward the parking lot. Mayor Diggs stays behind,

nervously tapping the envelope in his hand.

As Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot, ALL THE MAYOR'S

CAR DOORS OPEN, and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr.

Stockton climb out. Frank and Harry pop the trunk and

grab SHEETS OF CLEAR PLASTIC. Phil's eyes go wide.

Oh God. Run, Clara!

Phil and Clara start to run, when a GUNSHOT hits the

ground in front of them. They turn, when ANOTHER SHOT

rings out.

The next one won't be a warning shot.

They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and

Stockton walk toward them, Harry and Frank behind with

the plastic.

MR. STOCKTON

(to Harry and Frank

Let's do it over there.

y and Frank quickly throw the plastic sheets down on

the grass nearby.

I'm going to wait in the c r

don't mind.

MR. STOCKTON

Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.

As Mayor Diggs starts to walk back to the parking lot, he

opens the manila envelope. Manning gestures for Phil and

Clara to walk to the plastic sheets.

Please. Please don't do

Please! We have a child!

said over there!

i12J PH I L

Just me then, OK? I promise you she's

not going to say anything! Please! We

have a child!

Last time I'm going to say it.

Resigned, Phil and Clara sadly look at each other, then

walk to stand in front of the plastic on the ground.

On your knees.

Phil, scared, holds out his hand to Clara. She takes

looking back at him and they kneel in front of the

plastic, side by side.

Mr. Stockton nods to Lieutenant Manning, who checks his

gun.

M A Y O R DIG GS (O . S . )

Mr. Stockton and Lieutenant inning turn. Mayor Diggs

sifts through pages of DOCJ J:TTS that were in t h ''w Wila

Envelope.

-eally were planning to give you the

pictures, Mr. Mayor. That is, until you

-.sre so casual about is not needing to

worry about the cop who was after us.

That made me a little suspicious because

I never told you which cop it was.

Then we got to talking and realized how

dumb we were.

102.

E If you came on to some waitress at the

Rainbow, you must have felt pretty darn

comfortable there.

Which meant Stockton was probably your

buddy.

MR. STOCKTON

Where are the pictures?

But we were still confused, because if

you guys are buddies, how do you explain

the Falconwood Corporation?

Mr. Stockton's face blanches.

MR. STOCKTON

They're obviously not going to tell us!

Just shoot them!

Wait. I've heard that name. What's the

Falconwood Corporation?

Runs the hiring of inspectors for the

Department of Highways in Chicago. You

know, the ones who have been finding all

those violations?

MR. STOCKTON

Manning! I said shoot them!

I work for the Mayor, Terrence.

Why do you keep interrupting, Terrence?

Maybe because according to the paperwork

you've got there, he owns Falconwood.

Not only that, you'll see those other

pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called

Eurostruct - which rents the city all of

its construction equipment.

MR. STOCKTON

Frank, Harry!

Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns

his gun on them.

103.

The more violations Falconwood finds, the

longer Eurostruct rents the equipment.

That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor.

I'm sure that's not a moral problem for

you, but he's kind of screwing you in an

election year, isn't he? Some of us are

pretty pissed off about the roads.

Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it all

You did this to me? I don't get it,

Terrence. Why? How much do you need? I

have the Lieutenant here watch your back

on all of your gambling clubs-

MR. STOCKTON

Oh, do you mean the ones that you gamble

at? Where I cover your debts? Those

clubs?

I slipped your company 5 no-bid

foreclosed buildings for a dollar each

downtown.

MR. STOCKTON a

You think that pays for what I do for

you? The girls I have to pay off? The

jet charters? And let's not even get

into your "re-election fund"! Let's not

even go there!

Listen to them.

Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket

pocket, shoving it against the back of Phil's neck.

MR. STOCKTON

How did you get this? How?

Tha be from me.

Mr. Stockton and others turn around to see HOLBROOKE

104.

Manning tried to object, pulling out his bad

Yeah, yeah. I know all about you, buddy.

With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the

WIRES under their clothing. Seeing them hand over the

wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor Diggs what he's just

EXT. FRONT OF PHIL AND CLARA'S HOUSE - MORNING

As Holbrooke drops Phil and Clara off in front of their

house, his BLACKBERRY buzzes and he checks it.

Everything OK?

Yeah. They just need me downtown in half

an hour for a news conference with the

Deputy Mayor. Want it for the morning

shows.

Don't think they're going to be calling

you the IT guy any-more.

Listen guys, I feel weird about not even

acknowledging you two.

Don't.

But you should be up there with me. You

handed this whole case to me.

(smiles, winks)

Yeah, well-, that's how we roll.

They get out of the car and start up the driveway.

As Clara opens the front door, Phil slowly bends down,

Phil looks over to see his overly cheery neighbor Chaz in

his jogging suit. He smiles, appreciating Chaz for the

in.

You have your presentation in a few

hours.

Yeah. You know, I think I'm gonna be OK.

I had a good time tonight.

Yeah. Me too. It was fun.

It was.

So... let's do this again sometime?

For the first time the whole night, THEY KISS.

Interlocking fingers, they head inside, closing their

front door behind them.

FACE OUT.
