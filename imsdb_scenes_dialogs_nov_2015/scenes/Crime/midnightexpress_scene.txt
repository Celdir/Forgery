boots.  SOUNDS continue, Accentuated.  MOVE Across open

TRAVEL BAGS On The bed.  Clothes, possessions.  CONTINUE

old ceilings And windows suggesting Ancient Europe & design,

A haunting greenish AFTERNOON light.

We MOVE to HANDS, TIGHT - drawing out a strip of adhesive

tape,

SCISSORS move in TIGHT...SNIP!

UNDERARM, TIGHT.  Tape being laid over it.

BACK OF SHOULDER.  TIGHT.  Tape going on.

BELLYBUTTON, TIGHT. TAPE going Then: a harsh RIP! SOUND

and the tape comes off the bellybutton.

HANDS with new strip of tape. Moving to:

HASHISH PLAQUE. Four of them, thinly pressed. One on top

of the other. The HAND wrapping a portion of the TAPE around

them and:

BELLY, TIGHT. SOUNDS of BREATHING stop. The belly is sucked

in. The TAPE is pulled HARD across, then CLINCHED.  We

hear F.X. of HEART BEAT--

MOVE UP THE CHEST TO:

BILLY HAYES - 21, baby-face, attractive, medium build an

aura of innocence. His eyes moving off his belly to:

MIRROR.  FULL SHOT.  Climax.  A creature in a bondage of

his own devise, he is naked in his underpants, his body

criss-crossed by a network of TAPE and 40 tightly pressed

plaques of HASHISH in every conceivable crevice of his

body. The eyes are hard.

NIX THROUGH HEART BEAT, SOUNDS OF AIRPORT.

INTERIOR

ISTANBUL AIR TERMINAL dirty, crowded, wooden benches,

peddlers.  Turkish flight instructions on LOUDSPEAKER,

followed by mediocre English translations. NOTE: ALL

DIALOGUE IN TURKISH TO FOLLOW WILL BE MARKED OFF BY

PARENTHESIS. A CERTAIN WILL BE SUBTITLED, BUT SOME NOT.

REPEAT IN ENGLISH over:

BILL walking down a long CORRIDOR. He moves somewhat stuffly

in the clothes we saw laid out on the bed; his face

complicated by dark, rather ridiculous aviator sunglasses

and an increasing edge of nervousness to his actions. With

him is:

SUSAN 23, healthy outdoor looks, dressed casually colorful

like an American student abroad.

APPROACHING P.O.V. - a group of TURKISH SECURITY GUARDS,

in rumpled green uniforms, at a security CHECKPOINT inspect

the carry-on bags of several PASSENGERS.

BILLY tensely contemplating the guards as he walks.

SUSAN digging in her bag for her passport as she walks.

BILLY, looking from guards ahead to SUSAN. He suddenly

breaks stride, still a fair distance from the

checkpoint. SUSAN glances at him. He is holding his belly.

With a sense of panic, he turns and goes back down the

corridor without waiting for a response.  SUSAN concerned,

moves on.

BILLY in the  WASHROOM MIRROR, again checks himself out.

His glasses are off, and he has just watered himself down.

But the SOUND of his HEARTBEAT is up, and his nerves are

visible in his eyeballs and he knows it.  He dabs at the

sweat on his sideburns.  He closes his eyes, takes a DEEP

BREATH.  A pause. He puts his dark sunglasses back on.

Turns away from the mirror.  No going back now.

ADVANCING P.O.V. - SECURITY CHECKPOINT.  The GUARDS again.

Closer, closer, Guns in their HOLSTERS. SOUND of billy's

heartbeat,

CLOSE - GUARD smoking a cigarette, bored, uniform, looks

at BILLY.

The GUARDS again.SOUND of Billy's in a tattered olive

BILLY PASSPORT. The Guard's tobacco-stained FINGERS take

it open it. Basic information on Billy: Birth Date April

17, 1949.  Birth Place: Babylon, Long Island. No wife, no

minors.  Signature.

GUARD gives it back to BILLY.

BILLY opens his shoulder bag, proffers it. The GUARD tosses

it, pushing aside books, grabbing a white plastic dish.

Curious, one of the other GUARDS ambles over looking at

the frisbee.

BILLY tightens. Cursing the frisbee. Sweat now runs his

sideburns again.  HEARTBEAT up.

THE SECOND GUARD studies BILLY curious about the sweat.

Suddenly reaches up, indicates the eyes.

BILLY understanding the gesture rather than the words,

removes his glasses. His eyes. Straight, staring at the

GUARD without trying to look away. A long moment.

FIRST GUARD stuffs the frisbee back into the bag. Scowls.

Takes a puff on his cigarette, coughs. Phlegm rattles around

in his throat.

Reads the International Herald Tribune, seated on a crowded

olive-colored out on the tarmac She has saved him a seat

and pulls her bag off as BILLY sits down.

He waves BILLY through.

BILLY puts his glasses walks past the back the SECOND GUARD

turns away.  BILLY walks past the Checkpoint. His HEARTBEAT

drops.

SUSAN reads the International Herald Tribune, seated on an

crowded olive-colored BUS out on the tarmac.  She has save

him a seat and pulls her bag off as BILLY sits down.

He looks at her. Relief. A smile, awkward - he wishes he

could tell her.

Lays his head back on the wooden bench. Reaches out:

TAKES HER HAND in his. She returns the grip.

THE BUS DOOR slams shut.

THE TURKISH BUS DRIVER rolls the bus out towards the PLANES

visible in the far distance?.

SUSAN, feeling Billy is better, shows him the Herald

Tribune.

BILLY, his sunglasses removed, looks at the paper, almost

abstractedly.

NEWSPAPER Picture of JANIS JOPLIN.  That big, earthy, rugged

smile.

BILLY'S P.O.V. - Moves Up page One To The Headline: NIXON

OUT-RAGED AT PALESTINIAN HIJACKERS: CALLS FOR CAPITAL

PUNISHMENT

BILLY, thinking other happier things, reaches over and

playful!.:squeezes her tit twice, rapidly.

Bus stops suddenly. BILLY changes expression.

THROUGH FRONT WINDSHIELD we see TURKISH SOLDIERS in several

HALFTRACKS drawn up in a semicircle blocking the bus. The

Pan American PLANE is directly behind. Also JEEPS and a

POLICEMAN waving the bus down.

BUS BOOR opens and the Turkish Police OFFICER hops aboard

briskly:

PASSENGERS.  A confused hum.

The Turkish-speaking PASSENGERS are gathering together

their items and beginning to exit as:

POLICE OFFICER repeats, in ENGLISH

CLOSE BILLY. The POLICE OFFICER is only beginning the

speech.in English but already Billy realizes, And it's

panic.  Silent panic. That horrendous cold feeling all

over his back: Oh God what have I done, what can I do now?

He freezes.

MOVE TO SUSAN rising, fetching her things, irritated.

Behind her we see the other AMERICAN PASSENGERS beginning

to disembark with the usual chorus of overlapped

conversations, expletives, including:

Laughter is returned from several of the American

contingent, but we MOVE BACK to BILLY in foreground; all

of a sudden he is on his knees trying to crawl under the

seat.

She bends down to look, coming FACE TO FACE with him. He

grips her arm.

His tone stuns her; never before has he spoken to her like

that.  A LOOK between them; he has his glasses off now.

She's not a stupid girl by any means and realizes something

is very wrong and for the both of them, she'd best do

exactly as he says. And fast.  She moves OUT OF SHOT.

BILLY, crouched low in the aisle starts to work fast, his

finger: shaking reaching into his sweater starting to work

the TAPE loose from around his chest; looking from under

the bench. Still quite a bit of commotion as passengers

are exiting. BUT THEN:

BILLY P.O.V. - UNIFORMED LEGS coming slowly down Isle

Towards him. The muzzle of An M-l RIFLE tapping loosely

Against the side of the kneecap.

PAN WITH and MOVE UP as TURKISH MILITARY LIEUTENANT comes

into view, intersecting outgoing PASSENGERS, eyes casually

coming to rest on:

BILLY looks up from his kneeling position on floor; his

sweater rolled back down; he indicates the passport in his

hand. "Just found it" expression.

MOVE to the LIEUTENANT not necessarily suspecting anything,

but with a customary insolence reserved for young vagrant-

types, he stretches his rifle arms length with one hand

and gently prods Billy up with the tip of the muzzle placed

under his chin. MOVE BACK to the OFFICER, bringing the

rifle back to his side, indicating Billy get off the bus

with the others. All in silence.

BILLY among a group of MALE PASSENGERS funnelling into two

lines that pass on either side of a wooden inspection table.

Thirty TURKISH SOLDIERS with rifles ring the area. It is

open, vast, no place to run or hide. The only apparent

hope is to melt into their regular jostling patterns of

the passengers impatiently waiting.

TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN (Police) are on each side of the table,

body-searching the male passengers alternately.

SUSAN is in a similar set-up twenty yards away, with FEMALE

ATTENDANTS doing the searching. She glances at Billy as

she undergoes search. She is cleared, passes on, towards

the ramp of the plane.

BILLY, his sunglasses off, smoothly melts among the male

PASSENGERS pulling some books from his shoulder bag.  Glides

to the head of the line. MOVE TO:

The FIRST OFFICER patting down a PASSENGER, his back

partially turned to Billy. MOVE AROUND bringing him into

foreground as:

BILLY skirts him in the background, camouflaged among two

other conversing PASSENGERS waiting for the SECOND OFFICER

who now appears in foreground on the lateral TRACK; he is

busy with another passenger. In passing him, Billy replaces

the books in his shoulder bag as though he had already

been searched by the first officer,

Tension. FOLLOW BILLY as he approaches the boarding ramp.

BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN at the top of the ramp waiting.

Smiling STEWARDESSES. Pan America. Haven.

BILLY - FOOT rising off Turkish soil onto ramp.

TURKISH HAND lightly touching Billy's elbow, then grasping

the ARM.

BILLY his eyes flattening.

SUSAN in LONG SHOT, reacting.

BILLY turns trying to seem casual; he confronts the SECOND

OFFICER face to face and gestures towards the:

FIRST OFFICER who happens to glance at them.

SECOND OFFICER tightens his grip on BILLY, angry, and pulls

him back to the TABLE. MOVE with them. The officer has

been lied to; in addition he is young, inexperienced, about

eighteen.

BILLY, comprehending, spreads his arms.  The OFFICER pats

him down carefully, brushing against his armpits. Precisely

in the area where we saw the hashish. But incredibly he

doesn't notice, continuing to work his way down the hips

and legs.

CLOSE BILLY eyes on the sky behind the OFFICER, praying

silently for a break.

TURKISH FINGERS moving up the inside of his legs, onto his

belly, touching the hard bulge below the navel. But again

not noticing.

BILLY in limbo, SOUND of his heartbeat.

SECOND OFFICER pausing, his fingers around Billy's chest,

about to let it go, then:

PLACES HIS HAND suddenly flat on Billy's heart.

OFFICER, sensing the accelerated Heartbeat, stares at:

BILLY whose eyes jump, startled by this technique.

FINGERS like excited spiders quickly run back up into the

armpit area.  STOP - right on the packets.

TURKISH EYES SWIVEL to BILLY EYES CLOSE. Frozen moment.

Then, sudden blur of movement at the edge of frame.

SECOND OFFICER jumping back, grabbing his pistol from his

holster, crouching on one knee, aiming the gun barrel at

BILLY, hand shaking. He is terrified.

AMERICAN PASSENGERS scream and the deck all around.

BILLY stands there, arms straight up in the air, eyes

clamped shut, trying not to breathe. CHORUS of rifle and

revolver CLICKS OFF as:

PULL BACK to OVERHEAD SHOT BILLY surrounded by thirty

SOLDIERS with rifles pointed at him from all directions,

crouched nervously. The PASSENGERS all huddled on the

ground.

BILLY, eyes closed. Edge of frame shows a shaky muzzle a

REVOLVER poked into his belly, moving up.

MOVE to THE FIRST OFFICER, older, more experienced but

scared, poking with the revolver; reaches in with his hand

cautiously, starts to pull up the turtleneck sweater. MOVE

with the hand, revealing the HASHISH PLAQUES around the

navel. A pause. His HAND draws the sweater higher.  More

PLAQUES.

FIRST OFFICER'S FACE relaxes. Starts to smile, finding it

funny.

MASTER ANGLE SOLDIERS REGROUPING. PASSENGERS starting to

rise from the ground.

SUSAN dumbfounded watching all this from the door of the

PLANE, starts back down the ramp. But a flow of upcoming

PASSENGERS slows her descent.

BILLY is led roughly by TWO SOLDIERS parallel to the plane

his hands on his head. He manages a glance at Susan. A

slight but strong movement of the head and eyes. 'No. Don't

come down the stairs'

SUSAN understands it, looks helplessly, hesitates lost

between two worlds. A silent shaping of a puzzled mouth.

She is washed back along in the flow of passengers.

VIP ROOM AIRPORT LOUNGE.  The scene moves very fast,

Indicating A sense of chaos.  Much smoke.  Many phone calls.

Half A dozen Turkish police OFFICERS Are bizarrely seated

In A row of fold up chairs next to A desk. Chattering among

themselves (AD LIB) lighting their Turkish cigarettes.

They hardly pay attention as:

MOVE TO BILLY, scared, sweating - backlit by the huge

windows overlooking the airstrip. In background, we see

the 707 Pan American PLANE beginning to circle towards the

runway.  GUARDS have stripped him down to his bare chest

and now knife through the adhesive tape from two sides at

once. Then RIP the tape off.  BILLY winces.

ANOTHER ANGLE the room. Billy's luggage Is being Tossed.

Clothes fly through the air. A sweatshirt; Marquette

University Rowing Team. A 35mm camera. A gift package for

his mother ripped open.  A silver Turkish kettle, clanging

To The floor. Another package is ripped open and a set of

Turkish tea cups smash and break all over the floor. Very

fast.

BILLY watches, bewildered. He is stripped of the last plaque

in of the confusion is that each time another police officer

his navel. FOLLOW the plaque clattering onto the pile of

forty plaques.

MOVE BACK QUICKLY to the OFFICER with notebook at the desk.

Part of the confusion is that each time we see another

police officer we see he has another face.

ANOTHER ANGLE --

The OFFICER is puzzled.

A LOUD SOUND OFF.

The DOOR flies open and ANOTHER OFFICER strides in.

Paunchy, moustached. The room is suddenly silent as we

TRACK him in, followed by a grinning civilian FLUNKY with

a big portable photo instrument and bulb.

THE FIRST OFFICER jumps up from the desk, makes an

obsequious salute to the SECOND OFFICER who arrogantly

acknowledges it and takes the vacated chair behind the

desk. The FIRST OFFICER moves to the first fold-up chair

in the row, pushing the police officer in that chair further

down. THIS OFFICER, in turn, shoves the next man down. It

goes all the way down the line like a comedy until the

last man in the row stands up against the wall. But this

is all in the background as:

Sharp SOUND OFF of FILM BEING RIPPED FROM CAMERA. He darts

a look at

POLICEMAN stretching the undeveloped film out.  Another

loud SOUND OFF, interrupting this--

THE DOOR flies open again and a THIRD OFFICER strides in,

obviously the most important yet, because the SECOND OFFICER

jumps up from the desk, and all the others immediately

move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moment's

hesitation. But the THIRD OFFICER strides right up to Billy,

waves to the SECOND OFFICER.  THE CAMERAMAN in background

bubbles with enthusiasm, sliding into position. Billy is

puzzled - what's going on?  His arm is grabbed and he is

swivelled around.

REVERSE ANGLE - OVER CAMERAMAN

BILLY in the middle, flanked by SECOND and THIRD OFFICER,

grinning like big game hunters, their arms on his shoulders.

The FIRST OFFICER, sticking a bunch of hashish plaques

into Billy's hands, runs OUT OF FRAME. BILLY looks from

side to side. The SECOND OFFICER pats him hard on the back

of the head, meaning 'look at camera'. BILLY glances at

him, sees the grin on both the officers' faces. Thinking

this is the necessary expression, he grins at the camera.

CAMERAMAN disgustedly looks up from his eyepiece.

SECOND OFFICER slugs BILLY in the stomach with a quick

back-handed fist. BILLY groans, sinks to his knees. The

plaques fall on the floor.

He growls, grabbing Billy's arm and hauling him up,

gathering the hashish plaques and putting them back in his

arms. The TWO OFFICERS put their arms back on Billy's

shoulders. BILLY, in pain, makes the proper expression of

misery.

FLASH!  The bulb goes.

THE 707 PAN AMERICAN PLANE, destination New York, roars up

into the sky. PULL BACK all the way to BILLY sitting next

to the window, huddled over, feeling woozy and near

vomiting.  He glimpses the plane but it is anti-climatic

now; as he stares down at his boots. Then remembers

something! Surprised.

ANOTHER ANGLE - ROOM. The Turkish OFFICERS talk AD LIB

among themselves, congratulating, slapping shoulders,

pointing to the hashish plaques, etc.

In center background, we see BILLY submissively lifting

his arm for permission to speak,

THIRD OFFICER nods, approaches, followed by OTHERS.

BILLY slowly, partly out of pain, pulls off one of his

boots, bangs it on the heel and two more PLAQUES clatter

to the floor.

TURKISH MOUTHS drop open.

BILLY finishes the process with the other boot. An awkward

silence OFF.

ANOTHER ANGLE. The room explodes with screams and commotion.

AD LIB:

Amid all the screaming TWO POLICEMEN rush over and yank

BILLY upwards, and start to strip all his clothes.

BILLY spread-eagled STARK NAKED against the wall. He is

afraid to move. A strange silence.

ANOTHER ANGLE. BILLY naked in center B.G. against the

wall.The OFFICERS and SOLDIERS quietly leering at his trim,

muscular buttocks. Hungry stares.  Bisexuality is prevalent

in Turkey.But there is also embarrassment among the

officers; none would do anything openly in front of the

others; instead they just stare and smoke their cigarettes.

Low murmurs. Continued telephone calls. Much thick smoke

all over the room.

Another DOOR opens OFF. Obsequious GREETINGS in Turkish.

BILLY is afraid to look over his shoulder, feeling

enormously humiliated.

A perfect Texas drawl. BILLY glances over his shoulder.

Sees:

TEX a tall, lanky blonde-haired American in a business

suit with boots. Clean cut, very handsome, with a strong

flavour of danger in his blue eyes.

ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, so grateful at last to see a fellow

American, reaches quietly for the clothes, his eyes never

leaving Tex. Release?

TURKISH DETECTIVE sits at the main desk in the room.  Unlike

the others, he has no moustache; a skeletal face,

intelligent looking.  TEX Is behind, leaning casually up

against the wall. Angled to Billy's side is the entire

array of seated OFFICERS looking on like a tribunal.

BILLY, standing to the side of the desk, clothed now,

buckling his belt - afraid.

BILLY'S EYES MOVE TO:

TEX who makes a cool affirmative nod of the eyes to Billy.

STREETS, ISTANBUL, AFTERNOON. TEX drives his American CAR;

BILLY in the passenger seat; TWO TURKISH PLAINCLOTHESMEN

in the rear seats . Various BACKGROUND SHOTS of the city.

It sounds bad. Tex looks at him without expression.

Pause.Billy tries to sense a sympathy in this ambiguous

man, a liking towards himself. But feels nothing yet, except

someone who can speak English.

ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY nervously takes the pack and matches.

BILLY fumbles to light up his cigarette. He is nervous,

grateful to volunteer any information...anything.

TEX grins, sceptical of his naivete, changing the subject.

BILLY nods, takes a deep drag on his cigarette.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Tex glances at him, questioningly.

Billy leans back in seat, blowing out the cigarette smoke.

A narrow cobblestone STREET.  TEX pulls the car to a halt.

THE PUDDING SHOPPE TWILIGHT Internationally-known cafe,

adjacent BAZAAR. Crowded, noisy. WOMEN dressed in black

hold crying CHILDREN by the hands. FOREIGNERS, mostly

students and hippies, move about laughing, joking. Hawkers,

street peddlers, vendors cooking shishkebab.  small GYPSY

BOY leads a huge MUZZLED BEAR on a leash.

BILLY sits at a small outdoor TABLE alone sipping tea and

eating baclava - nervous, very nervous, still trying to

sort it all out in his head. If he doesn't find the seller,

what will happen next?

MOVE across the TABLES, past a middle-aged AMERICAN COUPLE,

to TWO TURKISH PLAINCLOTHESMEN watching him closely. They

look evident. TWO HIPPIES make a wide berth around them.

MOVE ON to another TABLE where TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN

sit, equally evident, watching BILLY.

TEX sits in his car, in the distance, casually glancing at

a newspaper.

BILLY's eyes rove.

INTERIOR PUDDING SHOPPE Large. Many tables. Stairs. A back

exit.

ANOTHER GYPSY BOY leads a huge PINK PIG leashed with a

wooden sign around its neck proclaiming "Pig" in Turkish.

Various TURKS point the pig out, laughing at it, some

disgusted by it, making faces and gestures: "Go way, go

way!  "Ayip!"  The PIG moves past BILLY, who shifts his

gaze to:

POV - CABDRIVER #1 lingering at the curb. PAN to CABDRIVER

#2  PAN to CABDRIVER #3. PAN BACK to #1 and again to #2

indicating no real fix on identity.

BILLY tense now, knowing this is the chance he must take,

nods with his head, pointing at CABDRIVER #2, off.

THE PLAINCLOTHESMEN move out towards CABDRIVER #2.

BILLY tentatively rises, as if to join them, but moves

slyly towards the interior of the cafe.

PLAINCLOTHESMEN move in roughly on a surprised CABDRIVER

#2 who begins to protest LOUDLY (AD LIB).

BILLY moves through the INTERIOR of the PUDDING SHOPPE,

past the tables, past the stairs, towards the back of the

shop, at a normal.to attract attention.

A PLAINCLOTHESMAN looks around, sees he is gone. Tells the

others (AD LIB) They spread out looking, abandoning the

CABDRIVER #2 who spits and curses them (AD LIB).

BILLY, with one backward glance, now eases out the BACK

DOOR, into a bilious sunlight, onto a STREET. Pause.

A HAND with GUN moves into FRAME pointing a six-inch barrel

right at his temple.  BILLY freezes, moving just his eyes

to:

TEX looking down at him calm, merciless.

BILLY - the sense of betrayal in his eyes.

ESTABLISH PRISON - OVERHEAD ANGLE. A large and Byzantine

structure suggesting the 15th Century Sultan's Janissary

Barracks. Irregular crescent various wings; a MOSQUE inside

the prison. The possibly a shapes to the sense of an endless

a decorative an equally in a city, labyrinth built by some

mad Arab architect to suit purpose and now, in the 20th

Century, transformed by mad Turkish bureaucracy into a

prison. It should be preferably made to look like Istanbul.

Faint background atonal Turkish CHANTING. Evening Muslim

prayer."Allah wakbah, Allah wakbah..." on and on, suggesting

to us fear rather than praise.

BILLY - his scalp being shaved off by a prison BARBER in

an un-specified ANTI-CHAMBER, His eyes are staring dead

ahead.

BILLY is now completely BALD, SOUND SHARP OVER:

A CELL DOOR SLIDING OPEN. BILLY steps in, bewildered.

The cell is dark, almost black, an overpowering stench; a

small grey metal bunk is bolted to the floor with a lumpy

mattress. BILLY turns, looking back at the man staring at

him from the door.

ZIAT is quickly summing up Billy's character. This is his

craft.He is a prisoner and trustee. sinister man whose one

motivation in life is the accumulation of money, in the

pursuit of which he has acquired an ugly purplish SCAR

running the width of his throat, various other facial SCARS;

and one blind milky white EYE. He's stocky and strong --

about five ten, with bushy eyebrows, brown cigarette teeth,

big dirty nails, repulsively in need of a bath. What's

surprising is that he is no more than thirty years old

looks and behaves like sixty. The personification of the

denaturalization of a man. Time, body, mind - all of them

warped.

BILLY, not yet attuned to his nature, only repulsed, is

still wearing his own clothes and makes a shivering gesture,

enunciating very clearly, hoping he will understand.

ZIAT smiles, showing his stained teeth, and starts to slide

shut the cell door on its ROLLER.

A cobra smile flashes, as the cell door bangs shut.

Goes.

BILLY walks around the cell, hugging himself for warmth.

BILLY stops, goes to the edge of the cell.

A BONY BARE ARM motions from the bars of the cell next to

his.  We never see the face but hear a thick ITALIAN ACCENT,

hoarse and cracked.

Extends a stick with a big nail pounded into the end,

twisted over to form a hook.

BILLY takes it. Hesitates.

BILLY cautiously slides the cell door open, amazed that

it's been left open.  Nothing makes any sense to him in

this labyrinth

ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY steps out into a WALKWAY. A bare

bulb overhead casts light. He glides past the three cells,

seemingly empty.  Finds the cell with blankets, sheets,

towels and various supplies stacked inside.  But it's

locked.  He slips the stick in between the bars and

stretching, hooks the first blanket.

BILLY asleep with the blankets pulled up to his chin.

Suddenly DIRTY HANDS reach into frame and rip the blanket

off. WIDEN TO:

Then SLAPS at BILLY. BILLY ducks away. Encouraged, ZIAT

steps up closer to him, sticks his fingers in his chest

screaming.

And feints as if to hit BILLY again. BILLY reacts to defend

himself, pushing ZIAT off and jumping out of the bunk.

ZIAT, Enraged by the shove, comes back at BILLY, screaming,

arms flailing like a bear to pummel him, but BILLY, not

understanding the Turkish bluster in his mannerisms, meets

him with a sharp right FIST into the front of his face.

ZIAT staggers back, startled into silence; he has misjudged

this kid.

BILLY waits, ready for the fight in the defensive position.

The guy is bigger than himself.  ZIAT, however, now feels

the blood from his mouth and nose and freaks out, running

out of the cell SCREAMING at the top of his lungs as if

he's dying.

BILLY is blindfolded, stumbling down stone steps pushed by

a GUARD, into a dungeon-like basement room. THE PUNISHMENT

CELLS.

THE GUARD removes the blindfold. BILLY, adjusting to the

light, stares around. The cell is spartan, with a series

of pulleys and primitive bondage devices hanging from the

cobwebbed ceiling.A DOOR opens and:

HAMIDOU STEPS in, lowering his head to get through the

door.Chief of the guards. A clean uniform.  Four stripes.

The only guard to carry a holstered gun. very frightening

man. He is about six two, two forty, and muscular, and

moves lightly like a fighter on his feet.  His skull is

bullet-shaped and completely shaven like Billy's, Enhancing

this effect, he has no eyebrows, and his pale blue eyes

(suggesting a trace of Indo-European stock in his ancestry)

are set deep in his skull somewhat like turtle eyes, giving

nothing away. His nose is a beak of skin his neck broad,

his mouth a small crescent that moves as lightly as his

feet between anger and amusement. He approaches BILLY,

looks into his eyes, drawing out the moment for himself,

enjoying the tension and the fear he instils in others.

BILLY meets his eyes respectfully, then realizing this is

perhaps not the thing do to, looks away. But, fascinated

by the man's features beyond his self-control, he looks

back.

HAMIDOU, amused by eye actions, smiles thinly. The sort of

smile that could imply friendship such is its hint of charm.

And slowly his hand moves up to caress the edge of his

hairless upper lip. An erotic gesture in Turkey.

"Its in my memory locked."  He slowly extends his right

arm stiff out to his side.

BILLY watches, fascinated.

HAMIDOU lets the arm linger; then:

SMASHES BILLY across the face with an open palm. BILLY

shoots back: and smashes against the wall just from the

force of one blow.  Stunned.

HAMIDOU advances, taking a wooden CLUB (FALUKA STICK) about

feet three long and three inches wide from a GUARD.

BILLY scared, emphasizing the words, trying to make himself

understood.

THWACK!

BILLY'S LEG BUCKLES, where the faluka stick has just smashed

him behind the kneecap. He SCREAMS going down.

BILLY looks up from the floor:

HAMIDOU with his club in hand.

Raises the club.

BILLY tries to block it with his hand, and the CLUB smashes

his thumb.  SCREAM.

BILLY is hoisted upside-down in his UNDERPANTS ONLY with

thick rope tied about his ankles, the legs spread - onto a

PULLEY suspended from the ceiling. He is yanked upwards,

then lowered slightly, his head and backs of shoulders

banging against the stone floor.

THE PULLEY is LOCKED into place.  (LOUD SOUND)

BILLY has this surprised look on his face still, through

the tears.  What's happening?

Hamidou motions the GUARDS out of the room (AD LIB).  Turns

back to BILLY, raises his club.

BRINGS IT DOWN FORCE on the soles of BILLY'S BARE FEET.

SCREAM.  He cocks the club again.

BILLY twists To avoid The blow

CLUB catches him On The ANKLEBONE

BILLY SCREAMs louder than ever as we hear The SOUND of

wood On bone.  Whimpering SOUNDS follow.

BILLY looking through teary eyes, sure now that he is going

to be killed. The CLUB - OFF - smacks sole skin with the

same force as the first blow. No let up.

BILLY still in the same position, vomits all over himself.

HAMIDOU SPINS the PULLEY to a new position bringing:

BILLY into a steeper, more vertical position.  He is on

the verge of fainting, bleary-eyed, looking as:

HAMIDOU moves around in between his legs. Doing something

indistinct with the stick between his legs, then dropping

the stick. Then, with this bizarrely excited expression on

his hairless face, he begins to undo his own pants. But,

for Billy, it all BLURS OUT TO:

JAPANESE SILK SCREEN depicting a fat jovial Buddhist monk,

fishing placidly by a stream. Then moves to soap carvings

of chess pieces Then a bed-sheet hung as a curtain with

astrological symbols paint; on it.  SOUND OFF, of a blaring

radio.  Atonal TURKISH MUSIC.

Then: ERICH - a gentle long bird's face. Long whitish-blond-

hair, Swedish, well above six feet, 25.

Another FACE moves into view JIMMY BELL, American, 23 fiery

eyes, black hair and moustache, intense, strong.

ANOTHER ANGLE - BELL puts a huge cone-shaped JOINT with

aluminium foil filter into BILLY'S LIPS. He hardly knows

what it is, Puffing weakly. Though dehydrated and his face

white without color, he has no facial markings.

BILLY looks down at

HIS FEET Bloated black and blue with inflamed red points

in various spots. A vicious bruise on his anklebone. ERICH

is running a cold rag from a basin of water over them, his

fingers tender.

BELL eases BILLY up from the bed, as ERICH puts a pair of

clip-clops on his feet.

BILLY nods. They rise together, bracing his shoulder.

BILLY adjusting to the sensation of standing.

Looks around.

A DORMITORY TYPE ROOM with 24 bunk beds set head to head

in horizontal fashion, cramped and with minimal privacy. A

narrow WALKWAY leading towards a TOILET AREA and STAIRCASE.

Helps him with ERICH to take the first steps.

THE COURTYARD. The THREE of them emerge in a thin AFTERNOON

sun, Billy now disengaging and hobbling on his own power.

BILLY glances at him, understanding. Pause.

Glances at ERICH.

THE COURTYARD

VARIOUS ANGLES The yard is 30 by 50 paces with a wall 20

feet high. Cigarette butts, orange peels crumpled news-

papers, rocks, sticks, broken glass litter the place.  No

guards are on the walls; the only GUARDS are unarmed

inanimate lumps of boredom who look as helpless as the

prisoners with whom they intermingle; they have raggedy

olive green uniforms and worn boots (they make $1 a month,

augmented by bribes).  On one side of the yard is a 2-story

ROGUS (cellblock) with barred windows from which Billy and

his two companions have just emerged.  On the other side

of the yard is another 2-story KOGUS (the children's kogus).

The COURTYARD is colorful, almost like a bazaar, about 8O

people in it - groups of exotically dressed AFRICANS,

AFGHANS, ARABS, MALAYSIANS, EUROPEANS, and predominantly

TURKS pacing back and forth talking in little circles,

hawking wares, trading illegal currencies.

Screaming Turkish STREET URCHINS 10-14 years old, share

the space playing soccer and volleyball with a surprising

viciousness, continually hitting each other and cursing. A

bunch of them vehemently lay bets on the soccer game.

Other aspects of the prison which should become evident:

1) NOISE - continuous, Loud. Radios, Turkish music,

screaming, shouting.  2) CATS - all kinds, some of them

pets, some stray, tolerated because they kill the rats. 3)

THE PRISONERS all wear their own clothing; the foreigners

preferring jeans, clip-clops, sneakers, Sweat suits. 4)

THE HEADS of only the new prisoners are shaved, then allowed

to grow back. 5) MANY PRISONERS have physical disabilities.

Carbuncles on the back from wet mattresses. Boils on the

lymph glands around the neck, buttocks, under-arms,

sometimes SO painful the victim walks with his arms up in

the air.  Arthritic in the knees, hips, ankles. Fungus on

the feet.  Many limp.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PRISONERS glance at BILLY as he walks,

noting the beating he has taken and sizing him up, then

going on with their business.

BELL's eyes follow a knot of KIDS to:

ZIAT has a window open on the FIRST FLOOR KOGUS and is

selling little cups of tea to the kids from inside where

he works a GAS STOVE. The kids push and punch each other

to get the tea faster.

ZIAT leaves the stove in the hands of an ASSISTANT and

moves down the window to a particularly gaudy AFGHANI a

fierce hawk-faced old man with a chunk of his ear missing.

He wears a colorful flowing robe, various scarves, turban,

trinkets, rings, baggy pants, and pointed curved shoes,

and makes emphatic violent gestures at ZIAT with his

mutilated THREE FINGERS.  ZIAT Seems to speak something of

his language and bargains back.

BILLY says nothing to them about the Ziat incident, sizing

him up for himself.

THE AFGHANI having concluded the deal with ZIAT reaches

deep into his layers of clothing around his crotch and

pulls out several scrofulous $10 bills which discreetly

takes in exchange for a thick wad of Turkish currency, his

eyes moving around, stopping on BILLY. A hooded look.

BILLY turning his eyes away from ZIAT

BILLY stunned.

ANOTHER ANGLE - all the color and breath seems to have

gone from BILLY.

BELL snorts, amused, kicking the SOCCER BALL away hard as

it dribbles towards them.

And stalks away, disgusted. A deep anger inside him.  ERICH

looks at BILLY who is quiet; by way of apology.

He shakes his head, looking at:

BELL him across the courtyard huddling with a cigarette,

bartering angrily. a raggedy GUARD giving him a cigarette,

bartering angrily.

BILLY and ERICH.

They walk.

Billy stops.

Even ERICH has to smile now.

ASLAN - a young big fat heavily moustached Turk, wearing a

black silk double-breasted business suit, grotesque cuff-

links, heavily pomaded hair, is huddling in a section of

the YARD with FIVE other grinning GANGSTER TYPES, all in

suits.

ERICH Glances back at BILLY

MAX - "Eskilet" (skeleton). British, tall, straggly long

hair with wire spectacles set crookedly over his nose. An

earing in one ear. The far away eyes of an international

junkie, preoccupied and uninterested in small talk. Tough

in his skinny way, like apiece of old dried leather.

He occupies with his YOUNG STRIPED CAT a bunk in the far

corner of the SECOND FLOOR KOGUS - in the process of

shooting himself up with "Gastro" a smelly brown liquid

stomach medicine.  No one is in the vicinity except

ANOTHER ANGLE

ERICH and BILLY who watches repelled as MAX fumbles with a

piece of twine tied around his arm in a tourniquet,

searching for an unused spot amid dirty infected track

marks. PLUNGES the needle in, pumping in the black gunk.

Glances at BILLY.

Pulls out the needle, loosens the tourniquet. His eyes

take on a far away stare.

Gives a spoon with a taste of the black residue to:

HIS CAT who is full of spunk, and tries to catch Max's

HAND.

He looks at BILLY, not remembering him.

MAX is beginning to go. He sits on his bunk.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MAX'S head begins to bob back and

forth.Focuses on BILLY.

MAX smiles from faraway like a Cheshire cat and his head

drops forward onto his knees, nodding off.

HAMIDOU, swinging his falaka stick rhythmically against

his leg and that calm killer look on his face, leads an

uneasy BILLY down a MAIN WALKWAY with a roof overhead; we

gather that the prison contains several separate wings.

ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING - HAMIDOU glances back at BILLY,

indicates with his stick "come here" and opens an office

door.

BILLY, still bewildered, his bruised feet almost back to

normal, limps in warily eyeing HAMIDOU who follows.

NECDIT YESIL, the lawyer, fleshy, grinning, thin black

hair heavily greased, sits at a conference table. Standing

adjacent is STANLEY DAVIS, the U.S. Consul - eyeglasses,

striped tie, neat summer suit with stripes, trimmed hair,

ivy league look, his eyes moving from Billy to:

OLDER MAN, late 50's white hair, blue-eyed New York

Irishman.A suburban insurance agent, rumpled suit, an

anxious look on his face. Moving towards BILLY fast:

FATHER AND SON embrace; the father's left hand grabbing

Billy's arm tightly as if never to let go.

HAMIDOU looks on, intrigued by the Father and Son; leaves

silently, closing the door.

FATHER looks into his son's eyes, his own eyes moistening.

He looks tired, pain all over his face.

BILLY looks down.

ANOTHER ANGLE

ANOTHER ANGLE

The professional smile from the Consul, but in the handshake

and the eye contact, BILLY is cool. The unanswered question:

Where were you before my father arrived?

ANOTHER ANGLE

YESIL moves forward. unctuous. bubbling with high spirits,

profusely shaking BILLY's hand, exuding confidence in

fractured English,

Pause, BILLY looks at him wondering how to take him in.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A pause. YESIL Shifts, Throats are cleared. BILLY moves to

sit down, limping faintly; he is wearing sneakers and the

bruises don't show.

Sits down at the conference TABLE.

BILLY laughs.

FATHER is happy to see his son laugh.

BILLY laughs again.

BILLY smiles. A pause. A worried look returns to the

Father's face

Glances at DAVIS, YESIL back to his father, his voice

beginning to tremble, ashamed of himself for letting it

show.

ANOTHER ANGLE. The FATHER understands the desperation in

his voice, puts his hand on his son's.

FATHER I promise you, Billy. Just sit tight and don't..

DON'T do anything stupid.  Let me work with Mr. Yesil and

Mr. Davis.  We'll get you out... Okay?  Billy, okay?

All the assurance of the world is written in this kindly

Irishman's face.

BILLY feels it.

BILLY being led by TWO GUARDS down a huge arched CORRIDOR

in the COURTROOM BUILDING.

THE COURTROOM - monolithic, frightening, immense with cross-

currents of greenish light from the enormous windows.

People seem insignificant.

THE PROSECUTOR, wearing dark green glasses, continues,

scowling, gesturing profusely at:

BILLY in the PRISONERS DOCK, baroque design, isolated.

Doesn't understand a thing, Erich's extra-large blue pin-

striped suit makes him look rather absurd.

HIS FATHER, CONSUL DAVIS, YESIL and ANOTHER LAWYER are

seated together at the defence table conferring in low

tones with each other. YESIL looks over at BILLY with a

big reassuring grin, nods his head - nothing to worry about.

TURKISH GIRL from the Press with a yellow legal pad, makes

notes in the Spectator Gallery. Her legs flare out from a

short skirt.

BILLY pries his eyes away to:

PROSECUTOR continuing in front of the THREE JUDGES high on

an Alice in Wonderland podium wearing long black robes

with scarlet collars. One of the Judges is bald, the other

has his eyes closed, could be asleep. The CHIEF JUDGE in

the middle has a sagging somewhat kindly face and short

grey hair.  A YOUNG MAN below the podium, is clacking at

an ancient typewriter on a small table.

He sits, staring malignantly at BILLY.

THE JUDGES rise.

The JUDGES exit.

ANOTHER ANGLE, General commotion in the courtroom as people

move about. The FATHER and DAVIS and the OTHER LAWYER

consult among themselves, the FATHER vigorously nodding

his head.  YESIL approaches BILLY.

BILLY leans forward anxiously in the dock.

But YESIL is called over by the other LAWYER and hurries

off.  A SOLDIER comes over and sits BILLY down.

THE CHIEF JUDGE puts on his glasses, stands to read the

verdict.

YESIL, standing with the OTHERS, motions BILLY to rise.

BILLY rises, tense.

FATHER looks over at him, manages a reassuring smile.

JUDGE continuing, after preliminaries:

PROSECUTOR, his expression souring, makes a gesture of

defeat. We wanted a conviction for smuggling, not

possession.

BILLY, not understanding sees the Prosecutor's gesture,

and a hint of hope crosses his expression.

JUDGE puts the paper away, looks at BILLY directly.

BILLY looking at the JUDGE doesn't understand. Thinks he

might be free.  But suddenly TWO SOLDIERS move in, and

start chaining his hands together. He is bewildered, looking

at:

YESIL hastily conferring with Billy's FATHER, more concerned

about making a good impression with him than with Billy.

BILLY watching this, a lost look.

FATHER is too shocked to do anything but look at YESIL who

continues on:

BILLY is forcibly removed from the DOCK - in chains.

THE FATHER, in the same CONFERENCE ROOM,

Stops. Knows it sounds bad.

BILLY looks down.

FATHER grips BILLY by the arm hard.

BILLY nods, acquiescent.

BILLY nods.  His FATHER points to a stack of ITEMS on the

conference table, picks up a cigarette carton.

HUGS HIS SON BILLY is on the verge of tears.

HAMIDOU enters the room. A morbid curiosity in his

expression about this show of grief. Watches a few moments,

then indicating the visit is over, he taps his falaka stick

lightly a few times on the hollow door.  THWACK!  THWACK!

FATHER breaks the embrace with BILLY, tears streaking his

cheeks. Silently indicates for him to "Go, go Fast."

BILLY goes, past HAMIDOU

FATHER shaking his finger at HAMIDOU

It sputters out of his mouth, senseless to:

HAMIDOU who closes the door. He has an angry glint in his

eye.

BILLY lies on his bunk at night deeply depressed, paler.

Candlelight flutters softly against the stone walls. A

PHOTO of SUSAN taken outdoors with a mountain range in the

background, is on his wall with various SOAP CARVINGS of

little chess piece she has designed.

In the distance, very faintly coming upwards into our sound

consciousness we hear a TRAIN WHISTLING in the night, on

an old railroad track bypassing the prison walls. Two

whistles.  Chugging. Then passing off. The Midnight Express.

The CAMERA DRIFTS around the SECOND STORY KOGUS revealing

the sleepers: ERICH, BELL, MAX...

The CAMERA LINGERS on ZIAT in a far corner of the Kogus,

top bunk, against a wall.  Never secure, he shuffles in

his sleep.

ZIAT is evidently awake he pulls his RADIO over into the

bed, and peering around to make sure no one is watching,

here moves the screws from the back of it, pulls off the

cover and puts in a sheaf of large denomination GERMAN

MARKS: inside we briefly glimpse a wad of different-colored

CURRENCIES stacked with rubber bands.

COURTYARD. Volleyball game in progress. ERICH is tall and

plays with dexterous grace. BILLY is fast, agile. BELL is

muscular, intense, his hits power-packed.

THE THREE they play against are hilarious looking in this

context, moving like big clumsy bears, waving their arms

and screaming at each other, disorganized. Ever conscious

of fashion, they have their jackets and vests off but play

in their Elvis Presley shirts rolled up at the sleeves,

shiny slacks, black pointed pumps. The boys wear shorts

and sneakers. On the sidelines we see a group of PRISONERS

laying bets and shouting encouragement.

BILLY leaps up for a ball close to the net and as the

TURKISH OPPONENT backs off, he dinks the ball in just over

the net; the Turk SCREAMS his teammates scream at him.

BELL goes up for another ball close to the net and really

SMASHES it with all his might, and:

BALL bangs right into the eye of a TURK who flails his

arms and SCREAMS with pain, very theatrical.

THE SAME TURK now swaggers around the COURTYARD, wearing

sunglasses so no one will see his black eye.

BELL across the pointyard grins at him and points him out

to BILLY, and ERICH.

THE TURK scowls back at BELL, huddles menacingly with

another TURK.

BELL, smirking at the Turk, turns and walks away.

Suddenly a CRY OFF and:

THE TURK runs up, pulling a sharp SHIV from his pants, and

using the cloth as a handle he repeatedly STABS BELL in

the ass and backs of his thighs. One, two, three, four,

five QUICK STABS, like a cook hammering veal. In spite of

its violence, the action seems like slapstick.

BELL tumbles to the ground, crying out.

THE TURK stashes the shiv and disappears among his FRIENDS,

his honor restored.

BILLY and ERICH run over to help BELL who is obviously

more in pain than in danger.

LONG SHOT - HAMIDOU and ASLAN the young fat Turkish gangster

pointed out previously by Erich, are taking tea together

in the FIRST STORY KOGUS alone except for ZIATR and

Hamidou's two FAT SONS, 7 and 8 years old, both dressed in

little suits listening politely as Hamidou gestures to

them, in couched terms. The voices are distant and, after

a few beats, UNDER BILLY'S VOICE:

They go on, each protesting.

A BURLAP BAG comes flying over the WALL of the COURTYARD

late at NIGHT. Then another comes over, lands in the yard.

one is around.

A THIRD BAG comes over, gets caught on a hooknail and rips

right open. HUNDREDS of yellow PILLS spill out.

COURTYARD.  The SUN is just coming up in the East.  PRAYER

can be heard in the distance. Thousands of bombers are

scattered all over the courtyard.

ASLAN arguing vehemently with a GUARD, in his ragged

uniform, who won't open the cell of the FIRST FLOOR KOGUS

into the courtyard.

ASLAN, red in the face, steps back, suddenly pulling out a

little REVOLVER. He promptly shoots the GUARD in both legs

and stalks back towards his bunk.

PRISONERS rushing out into the COURTYARD, scrambling for

the windfall of free nembutols.

THE PRISON DIRECTOR, A balding unimpressive looking man in

a western suit, is calling up the circular stone STAIRS to

the second story Kogus from the first story.  With him are

several GUARDS, equally reluctant to move forward.  Hamidou

is absent.

A PHOTOGRAPHER, seedy looking, readies a big old fashioned

box of a CAMERA.  He snaps the shutter on:

ASLAN and a group of FELLOW GANGSTERS, all impeccably

dressed and grinning for camera, fresh from their victory.

BILLY, ERICH, MAX, form their own group; in contrast to

the Turks, none of them are smiling, MAX has his YOUNG CAT

in hand.  The PHOTOGRAPHER is lining up his shot, posing

them like actors.

COURTYARD. GUARDS pull out SIX KIDS by the ears from a

line-up.

CLOSE KID being pinned onto his back on the floor in

CHILDREN'S KOGUS: then he is bent over double by a wooden

bench; and TWO GUARDS sit on each end of the bench, holding

him down.  A silence,

HAMIDOU appears in a hat and mohair suit with narrow lapels,

accompanied by his two little fat SONS, also in their Sunday

best. With a ceremonious solemnity, HAMIDOU takes off his

jacket, hat, vest, hands them to his sons.

BILLY watches through the WINDOW with OTHER PRISONERS.

HAMIDOU is passed a falaka stick.  He raises it high in

the air and begins to whack at the buttocks, legs, and

feet of the SCREAMING KID.

ANOTHER ANGLE - On this cue, the five GUARDS on the other

benches begin whacking away; the KIDS squirm, scream,

struggle but the GUARDS sitting on the of the benches brace

their legs farther apart to keep their balance, In immediate

background, the other KIDS watch, scared.

THE TWO SONS with wide-eyed but passive expressions, stare

at their father at work.

HAMIDOU beating his VICTIM, screams out:

Then stops.

BILLY WATCHES AS:

HAMIDOU is handed back his vest, jacket and hat by his

SONS: Puts them on ever so neatly and leads them off as if

on a Sunday stroll leaving the CRYING behind. On their

backs, we hear, placidly:

TEN DOLLAR BILL exchanging HANDS. The dirty nails of ZIAT

clutch the bill, waving it to the candlelight to see if it

is authentic his milky white EYE across the BILL.  He is

next to his bunk at night.

MAX and BILLY are next to him, MAX eagerly gouging with

his knife into a small bar of SOAP:

PULLS out a ball of HASHISH inside, neatly concealed. Brings

it up to his NOSE, sniffing.

ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY is watching with glazed eyes - stoned.

Approving of the $10, tucks it into his belly cloth looking

over and scowling at:

MAX'S YOUNG CAT on his bunk scratching playfully at one of

his wool sweaters.

ANOTHER ANGLE MAX holding the ball of hash:

ZIAT thinking MAX is correcting his English, nods and

repeats:

BILLY and MAX snigger and ZIAT realizes they are making

fun of him.  He hates that and suddenly reaches over and:

SHAKES THE CAT hard off his bunk. A SQUEAL from the cat.

MAX surprised, glares at Ziat.

Then hurries after it, calling its name...

ZIAT shrugs. So what?

ZIAT grins, shrugs, squats and fiddles with his keys and

footlocker.

BILLY watches, repulsed and fascinated.

ZIAT shrugs. He thinks BILLY is an idiot.

MAX has followed his cat down to the end of the floor but

it has run up into a rafter which he cannot reach. He calls

up.

RAFTER Nothing.

Max gives up.

He shuffles off back to his bunk.

THE CAT is back on ZIAT'S BUNK - NIGHT scratching with his

paw around the radio. of the neck, hard. Suddenly he is

GRABBED by the scruff  of the neck, hard.

BILLY jerks up from his bunk as he the hears a loud,

piercing SCREECH, OFF, echoing through the Kogus.  Then

silence.

ZIAT, industrious as always, is preparing his tea on the

three burners of the small bottled gas' stove in THE

KITCHEN, FIRST FLOOR Kogus; needless to say the area is

filthy with scraps all over the floor, cats and two large

wooden eating tables occupied by some PRISONERS. The Kitchen

opens up in background into a WASHING ROOM with SINK. It

is EARLY MORNING - Muslim CHANTING OFF,

THREE TURKISH PRISONERS walk in, talking (AD LIB), followed

by MAX stoned, who shuffles over to the table, about to

sit, sees something.

HIS CAT, dead stabbed, and lying there neglected in the

corner, just another scrap ready to be swept out.

ZIAT calmly pours the tea for the table, paying MAX no

attention, an excellent actor. Prominently seated, however,

is a GUARD.

MAX quietly glares at ZIAT and the Guard but says nothing;

he has been in prison long enough to know how to hold it

in.

ANOTHER ANGLE

MAX - silently walks over and gently picks up the corpse

in his arms, starts to walk out.

BILLY listening impassively to:

YESIL the lawyer. They are in a booth in the VISITING

CAMBER.  Bars separate prisoner and visitor.

BILLY closes his eyes as YESIL'S VOICE drones on, explaining

the details, the cast, the simplicity Of it,  FADING OUT

UNDER:

BILLY walking the COURTYARD counting his paces 48, 49, 50

Turns, goes back.

BILLY, MAX and BELL (bandaged around the ass from the

stabbing) are huddled around BELL's BUNK late NIGHT candle

burning, a sheet sealing off some of the kogus. Bell

furtively looks around, pulling out and elaborately

unfolding a set of DRAWINGS from a pack of letters.

BILLY, puzzled, turns the drawings upside-down, sideways.

THE DRAWINGS are a lunatic mess of scrambled lines, dots,

crosses.

ANOTHER ANGLE

MAX and BILLY, trying to follow the map, look at each other

dubiously.

INSERT DRAWING, illustrating roughly the structure of the

prison. His FINGER tracing, bubbling with nervous

enthusiasm.

MAX is standing, tapping on the wall, listening, a funny

look on is face.

ANOTHER ANGLE

BELL between BILLY and MAX walking in the COURTYARD

continuing intently:

BELL reaches the wall, turns around and continues Lowers

his voice occasionally as other PRISONERS intersect them.

Max is fed up with it now, no longer joking.

His eyes go back in time, haunted, vague breaks off.

ANOTHER ANGLE

P.O.V. - THE ROOF, its edges visible over the courtyard.

BILLY shakes his head.

A pause. BILLY looks away from BELL'S stare.

Looks down.

BELL understands, deeply disappointed.

Bell leaves:

A LONG DUNGEON CORRIDOR at the end of it, the frame of a

small; DOOR, cracks of light at its edges. TRACK IN - F.X.

of a siren, capture and now BEATING - heavy beating from

behind that door.  CLOSER we reach it. The door FLIES OPEN

and HAMIDOU is glimpsed lighting a cigarette. Like a surreal

dream, his hand holding the match has a thick LEATHER THONG

bound around its knuckles and blood speckled on his fingers.

A BLUR of foreground movement a GUARD coming out the door -

dragging:

BELL by the hair across the floor. His face contorting in

agony.

CLOSE BILLY'S TOOTH BEING PULLED

WIDEN to a STONE CHAMBER and a crazy looking DENTIST in a

filthy long white smock, puffing on a cigarette holder,

his ashes falling over Billy as he works his mouth. A

motorized drill is plugged into the wall, adjacent a filthy

spittoon covered with blood; dried blood is spattered

liberally around the chamber.

BILLY spits out the blood and looks in the mirror.

Suddenly he starts SHOUTING angrily in TURKISH. The DENTIST

screams back at him. AD LIB.

THE DENTIST still screaming, leans BILLY back in the chair

and looks in his mouth.

BILLY is washing himself in his undershorts at the SINK

with ERICH; the hot water is on full blast and billows of

vapor fill the small stone room, like a sauna. He pours a

pitcher full of hot water over his head; his eyes lingering

on:

THE STONES of the wall with their cracked moldings; some

areas are noticeably darker than others - Bell's "wet

spots", the alternate escape route.

ERICH uses a coarse washing sponge on BILLY's back.

EYES of the ARABS peer through the musky vapors at Billy

and Erich; they loll about the door curious, lecherous for

their bodies.

ERICH massaging BILLY on his bunk in the SECOND STORY KOGUS.

ERICH leans forward and kisses a tentative BILLY on the

lips.  A gentle kiss. They are standing inside the TOILET

STALL; lower themselves down onto the seat. ERICH looks

back over his shoulder, guarding their privacy. It is late

NIGHT.

BILLY closes his eyes, softly - and with hesitation -

returns ERICH's caress. Their hands probe each other's

bodies.

ERICH and BILLY do yoga positions together EARLY MORNING

fully clothed, in the FIRST FLOOR KOGUS empty space.  ERICH

lies on his belly, his back stiffly arched, feet raised.

BILLY stands silent, balanced lightly on his feet, his

palms pressed together beneath his chin, centering, eyes

closed.

BILLY rises gracefully onto his toes, stretching his arms

out above his head. It is the beginning posture, his body

greeting the day.

BILLY and ERICH sit silently now in lotus position, facing

each other, breathing slowly, relaxing minds still, looking

into each other's eyes. Billy closes eyes.

SOUND OFF, interrupting the clomp of FOOTSTEPS on the

STAIRS.

ZIAT comes down, staring at the two of them as he goes

into the KITCHEN to prepare early morning tea.

BILLY's expression changes.

Rises from his position.

THE SUN flowering up over ISTANBUL.

BILLY rises from his BUNK to the chanting drone of "Allah

Wakbah" OFF, and moving to the closest wall, takes out an

old wet rag.

BILLY erases out a scraped numeral (54) on the wall and

with a chalky piece of rock, inscribes in bold strokes the

numberal: 53

JIMMY BELL wakes, hearing the perpetual "Allah Wakbah"

CHANT.

He is noticeably pale and weaker than before.

BILLY cuts hair in the FIRST FLOOR there with a disturbed

tight look on his face, work with a pocket mirror. BELL

sits inspecting the

GUARD approaching with a slip in hand.

THE GUARD hands the slip to BILLY who is pleasantly

surprised.  A visitor.

BILLY, walking down and turning a CORRIDOR into: in the

PRISON, following a GUARD and turning into:

THE VISITING ROOM where the little booths with BARS separate

prisoner and visitor. Behind the grill is the Consul,

STANLEY DAVIS. His face is grim and grey. BILLY senses it

immediately.

BILLY sits, tense.

DAVIS swallows hard, not to say it

ANOTHER ANGLE

Billy's face drains of all expression.

BILLY'S EYES. Numb, dazed, surreal.

Suddenly he is GRABBED by his ivy-league striped tie and

his face is yanked up to the bars, his glasses falling

off.

BILLY is berserk, his face right up against the bars,

GRIPPING Davis tight.

Commotion OFF as GUARDS run in, HAMIDOU in the lead.

The GUARDS try to pry loose BILLY'S strangling grip ON

DAVIS' tie.

HAMIDOU takes out a KNIFE and cuts the consul's tie in

half.  DAVIS falls backwards.

BILLY is hauled now. back, still gripping half the tie.

He is trembling now.

DAVIS is shaken. He has red bar marks across his face and

is absent-mindedly trying to adjust half a tie as he looks

at:

BILLY being hauled out by HAMIDOU, SCREAMING something

indistinct.

COURTROOM. Same as before.

BILLY, in the prisoner's dock, addresses the Court; as he

speaks, a Turkish TRANSLATOR. drones underneath his voice

level:

YESIL the lawyer; DAVIS the consul.

THE PRESS GIRL from the previous trial in the short skirt.

BILLY

YESIL looks over, surprised he is talking like this. Looks

at DAVIS.

BILLY.

PROSECUTOR looks over, through his dark green glasses.

TRANSLATOR stops, looks puzzled.

BILLY

Sits down, disgusted; under his breath:

SILENCE in the uncomfortably. courtroom.  PEOPLE looking

at each other DAVIS looks down.

YESIL flips some pages abstractedly.

TRANSLATOR SCARED:

THE OLD CHIEF JUDGE, the same one as before Shakes his

head.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE JUDGE turns to BILLY in the foreground

rises, and unexpectedly crosses his wrists out in front of

him.

Makes the gesture of the hands forcefully, with anger.

BILLY WATCHING,

JUDGE

As he translates, the JUDGE unable to control his emotion

exits rapidly, not looking at Billy, followed by the TWO

OTHER JUDGES.

THREE OLD GLEANING WOMEN swathed in black like three fates

turn from their sweeping as BILLY is led out COURTROOM

NUMBER SIX down a long stone corridor. Dust floats through

long slanting shafts of yellowish light, like a striped

leotard dream.  BILLY walks, his eyes straight ahead -

determined.

BELL sings it, strumming sloppily but with feeling on his

guitar.  BILLY lies, his back up, on his BUNK nearby.

MAX, stoned, sits at the base of the bunk. It is NIGHT.

The song falters, but MAX now joins in, improvising:

SEVERAL TURKS are partying it up down at the other end of

the SECOND FLOOR KOGUS, playing a "sas" - Turkish type

guitar, counterpointed by a little drum; the music is

stridently Turkish, and one of the men does a belly-dance

in underpants with two lemons masquerading as breasts under

his shirt. The LOUD TWANGING of Bell's GUITAR can be heard

OFF, interrupting them. They are annoyed.

BELL leading MAX into the next stanza:

BILLY, touched - listening, thinking.

TWO TURKS from the party walk up, waving at BELL's guitar,

annoyed.

THE TWO TURKS tense, the mood changing.

BELL gets even angrier, puts the guitar aside, ready to

spring.

They don't understand but one of them is reaching into his

pants for his shiv.

ANOTHER ANGLE BILLY is moving fast between the TWO TURKS

and BELL. A new authority in his voice, and controlled

anger in his face.

BELL looks.

BELL astonished.

BILLY, with Max's little screwdriver and a metal spoon,

digs hard at the cracks around a dark stone in the SINK

ROOM, FIRST FLOOR KOGUS.  With him is MAX working on the

same stone. They are sweating, shirtless, looking back

over their shoulders at:

BELL guarding the STAIRS.

BILLY works the stucco out, jiggling with the stone (about

a nine inch circumference) using his fingers and

screwdriver.  Painful work.

BILLY kicks with his sneakers at the stone, as silently as

possible. A LOUD NOISE - crumbling dust, stucco.

BELL at the stairs freezes, fearful. Then SILENCE.  He

Runs over.

MAX, BELL, BILLY.

BELL studies it, pointing to the stone above left the one

that has been loosened.

BILLY has his head pressed close to the loosened stone.

Suddenly:

ANOTHER ANGLE - all THREE press their ears to the stone.

A silence. The faintest whisper of WIND and dripping 'WATER -

indicating a shaft of some nature. BELL looks back at BILLY.

BILLY smiles. MAX reaches over and grabs Bell's face between

his hands, kisses him violently.

MAX now on guard at the STAIRS, looks over at:

BELL AND BILLY - with fresh paste putting the finishing

touches on the edges of the stone which has been replaced

in its original position. Bell's half naked torso reveals

a pair of dice with lucky sevens tattooed on his shoulder.

THE REPLACED STONE. On close inspection, it is apparent

that the stucco around it doesn't match the other stones

one bit, but as we PULL BACK to see ZIAT washing his tea

cups in the SINK during the DAY, this irregularity is lost

in the greater mosaic of the wall structure. At least ZIAT

doesn't notice as:

BILLY nervously comes into the SINK area, watching him,

and calls to him.

BILLY followed by ZIAT into the KITCHEN casts a look of

relief at:

BELL and MAX who wait at a table with empty tea cups.

A HORDE OF COCKROACHES stream out from a crack in the stone

as BILLY and MAX dig, scrape, jiggle the third stone. Both

covered with sweat, working with confidence now.

A DARK EMPTY SHAFT on the other side. Dripping water.  Two

stones removed.

BELL runs over:

Bell turns to go. Suddenly a LOUD CRUMBLING NOISE and:

A FOURTH STONE starts to go - but brakes itself.

BILLY, MAX, BELL all framed in a posture of fear -- not

daring to move.

SECOND STORY KOGUS remains silent.

BELL looks up the STAIRS, tiptoes back, indicating they

are clear.

MAX AND BILLY. All THREE of them look:

THE THREE A HALF STONE SPACE. Easily big enough for them

to squeeze through. BILLY shines a candle in the shaft,

OFF.

THE THREE look at each other. The same thought. Eager eyes.

The TRAIN WHISTLES by in the night, OFF.

BILLY looks at his watch, hates to do it. Shakes his head.

MAX groans to himself.

BILLY tense and restless at his BUNK TWILIGHT. A loud RADIO

OFF - Turkish News.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MAX, BELL, AND BILLY. A pause.

He extends his hands and the other two cross in a six-handed

shake.

MAX signals down the STAIRS - "all clear".

BILLY going through the HOLE in the STONES that NIGHT into:

A DARK SHAFT spookily leading downwards. He lights a thick

CANDLE tied horizontally across his sneakers so as to give

him his light source where his footholds are.  His P.V.O:

PART DUMBWAITER SHAFT, PART WATER WELL from a previous

century A series of corrugated mossy old footholds and

iron spikes lead down at irregular intervals.

BILLY, MAX AND BELL, each with their own foot candle, are

spaced along the shaft easing downwards. BILLY looks up at

MAX about ten feet above.

BILLY in a sweat, slips. A tense moment - then he catches

himself.  OFF - the TRAIN WHISTLE can be heard, echoing

into the shaft.Mixed suddenly with LOUD TALKING OFF. Arguing

in Turkish.  BILLY freezes, signals upwards with a sharp

hiss of breath.

BILLY identifying the relative location of the voices,

eases downwards, coming to a GRILL, looks in at:

A BASEMENT ROOM with FURNACE. TWO TURKISH GUARDS throw the

prison rubbish in the furnace, still arguing, AD LIB.

BILLY signals upwards.

REVERSE ANGLE, from inside the basement, of BILLY slipping

past the grill, his face sharply illuminated by the flame

of the furnace.

Off the walls around the grill we can see the GIANT

SILHOUETTES of the two guards still arguing.

BILLY comes to the base of the shaft. A puddle of scummy

water.  Unstraps the candle. A current of WIND He peers

around.

P.O.V. - A WINDING NARROW CATACOMB, WITH BEEHIVE BURIAL

PLACES ON BOTH SIDES.

BILLY, sniffing the stench, unrolls a ball of THREAD ties

it to a marker and heads in.

BILLY, BELL and MAX are in the catacomb. A scratchy hideous

sound and:

BATS fly out squealing from the ceiling.

THE BOYS hit the ground as BATWINGS flap over them,

colliding against each other, knocking off walls,

SCREECHING, then diminishing in sound. Fewer and fewer.

Then gone.

BILLY looking up.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Heads in that direction.

A HUGE SPIDER scatters off, as BILLY's CANDLE illuminates:

ANOTHER ENDLESS WALKWAY.  BILLY comes to a stop -

frustrated.

INTERSECTION Two walkways.  BELL leads in, unwinding the

thread, stops.

BILLY comes into view, equally frustrated.

ANOTHER MAZE of walkways. The three stop exhausted, faces

blackened.  BILLY, in utter rage and frustration starts

kicking the wall.

SILENCE as the three pathetic escapees ponder their fate.

BILLY, getting a grip on himself, thinking.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Takes the THREAD and starts to follow it back.

THE SHAFT. BILLY leads the climbers UP.

MAX reaches a new foothold, stops, getting his breath.

Looks down at BELL heavy breathing OFF.  Urging him on.

BELL, suffering, can't help but grin.

MAX overhearing it.

BELL starts to giggle.

MAX laughing, shaking his head.

BILLY can't go on, starts to giggle at the thought.

ANOTHER ANGLE - the THREE of them, spaced along the shaft,

are all giggling hysterically. Echoing. HOLD ON them.

BILLY comes through the HOLE in the stones in the SINK

AREA.  It is still NIGHT.  He looks around - silence. MAX

follows through the hole.

BILLY and MAX work fractically to seal up the STONES.

BELL, exhausted, is at the STAIRS guarding. Distant early

morning SOUNDS of prison waking up.  We feel they will be

spotted this time, but:

BILLY slumps into his BUNK as the first rays of LIGHT come

up in the sky and the CHANT from the Mosque commences.  He

immediately sinks into sleep.

CLOSE on OLD TEA LEAVES being washed in the SINK.  A MILKY

WHITE EYE follows into view.  ZIAT is preparing his early

morning tea, his good eye now moving to something beyond

the tea leaves. Curious, he straightens, throwing the

withered bunch of leaves the sink.

ZIAT approaches the irregular stucco paste around the

REPLACED STONES; runs his fingers along the ridges, noticing

the paste is fresh.

BILLY snoring from fatigue.  BELL wakes him quickly.

OFF there is a lot of SHOUTING downstairs.

BILLY standing in a group of PRISONERS with BELL and MAX.

He has a look of total despair on his face, as he watches.

THE SINK.  PRISONERS are everywhere jabbering excitedly

among themselves.  ZIAT is conferring with HAMIDOU as GUARDS

rip out the last stone, revealing the HOLE leading to the

SHAFT.

BILLY's gaze shifts to ZIAT fixing all his hatred on him.

ZIAT grinning, moves away, and his falaka stick cocked

like a sergeant major - moves among the prisoners.

They all fall immediately silent.  HAMIDOU continues his

walk among them, bypassing:

MAX who shifts his gaze onto:

BILLY.  HAMIDOU approaches, his eyes moving over BILLY

with contempt, and shifting him aside with the stick. To

him Billy is the same passive prisoner as before. He moves

on, shifting OTHERS aside and then stops at:

BELL.  HAMIDOU swings his stick up slowly and taps him

lightly on the chest. BELL realizes and is afraid.

He punctuates this last with a theatrical tap on the chest

and he gestures to the GUARDS.

BELL, already broken by bad beatings, shivers.

GUARDS grab him, hurry him out the Kogus behind HAMIDOU

BILLY holds himself rigid, trying not to break. Bell's

PROTESTS continue OFF.

MAX unable to contain his anger, strides right up to ZIAT,

collars him, livid.

MAX is about to swing when BILLY grabs him.

ZIAT Glances from BILLY back to MAX fixing on him as BILLY

walks him away.

MAX is at his BUNK that NIGHT; puts away the hypodermic

needle, stoned and speeding at the same time, smoking a

cigarette.  BILLY inwardly tense, sits with his head in

his hands.

Tears have formed in his eyes.

BILLY looks away, not even considering. But MAX is caught

up in the notion.

MAX clumsily brushes the burning ash off his shirt where

it's made a hole.

His eyes cloud with tears.  He sits down, head between his

hands.

Suddenly shifts mood again, stands, pulling out a SHIV,

resolute, eyes brightening.

BILLY looks up wondering.

Lurches against the bunk.

BILLY smiles, shakes his head, then:

MAX slumps back down on the bunk, suddenly tired of killing.

BILLY glances at him, not sure whether he heard.

MAX gives him a goofy nod - and a grin. Imitating Robert

Newton as Long John Silver.

MAX, distracted, let's his attention wander back.  Inaudible

his head bobbing now.

He lurches over gently on the bunk.

MAX Sleeps.

BILLY surprised, then reflective.

THE BACK OF THE RADIO is unscrewed; the cover pulled off.

EMPTY!

MOVE TO ZIAT.  The look is as Billy expected. Horror, shock,

anger, fear.  ZIAT SCREAMS hysterically like old Greek

widow and:

BEATING HIS CHEST and tearing at his hair, ZIAT runs out

of the KOGUS wailing, moaning.

THE SECOND STORY KOGUS is being" controlled" by the GUARDS.

WIDE ANGLE reveals a circus of clockwork destruction as

the GUARDS, making abundant NOISE, systematically rip up

each bunk, locker, mattress, picture, book, etc., their

faces flushed with this opportunity for orgy.

THE PRISONERS are lined up in the COURTYARD, each one being

body searched.Prominent are MAX and BILLY, looking up amused

at the

SECOND STORY WINDOWS - feathers from a mattress fly around.

ZIAT Briefly appears, his face at the window, looking at

the prisoners in the yard, frustrated.

HAMIDOU breaks apart a with his bare hands.

ZIAT is stripping MAX's possessions, sure he will find it

here.

Ziat springs up.

GUARD calling out from the STAIRS.

ZIAT leaning in CLOSE, OVER THE STOVE in the KITCHEN, framed

by GUARDS. It is the same crouched posture he always uses

to work the stove but now his eyes show complete despair

as he sees:

A THOUSAND SHREDS OF PAPER MONEY floating in his pots amid

his withered tea bags. From ashes to ashes and dust to

dust.

ZIAT folds his head into his hands, sobbing then wailing

very human, very sad.

KITCHEN - NEGDIR an Arab, is now running the tea concession.

A jolly ebullient man. Pours a cup for MAX. Several OTHERS

are at the table.

Just as:

ZIAT enters the kitchen; he eyes Max with hatred, sits at

the other TABLE and orders tea. Surprisingly, he is wearing

a suit and clean shirt-unlike his usual grimy appearance.

BILLY, looking shaken, enters the kitchen, glances at ZIAT

sits with MAX.

BILLY glances over at:

ZIAT drinking tea.

BILLY AND MAX

BILLY looks over to see:

HAMIDOU and a DOZEN GUARDS spreading through the KOGUS,

assembling everybody with shouts of "SAYIM!"

THE PRISONERS are lined up in ranks in the FIRST FLOOR

KOGUS.

BILLY glancing at MAX next to him, wondering why.

HAMIDOU goes down the line, his FLUNKIES searching each

man.

A GUARD reaches into ZIAT'S pocket and comes out with a

matchbox. Yells to HAMIDOU who comes over.

MATCHBOX Containing a small amount of HASHISH.

HAMIDOU reaches over and pulls ZIAT out of the 'line

roughly.

Starts to slap him around.

BILLY glancing at MAX.

HAMIDOU smashes ZIAT again, but pulls the punch.

Raises his arm again.

Point at:

MAX who stiffens, eyes like cracked eggs.

HAMIDOU peers at MAX, advances.

Indicates the matchbox in his hand.

GUARDS drag off.

BILLY sits on his his anger building, his imagination

running wild.

MAX being dragged down a CORRIDOR by his feet. A SCREAM.

BILLY

BELL, his features distorted, being carried into an

AMBULANCE.

BELL, MAX and BILLY at the wall, digging together, MAX

hugging BELL the time they found the shaft.

MAX twisting out of the grip of a GUARD and, grabbing the

glass from his smashed spectacles, he cuts deep into his

wrist.  GUARDS grab him. A LOUD LAUGH OFF carrying over.

BILLY turning on his bunk to see:

ZIAT joking with TWO GUARDS as he enters the SECOND STORY.

The guards back down the stairs.

BILLY already in movement.

ZIAT, in his suit, collecting suitcase from his bunk,

preparing to leave.

Turns and catches a FIST in the side of the face.  Staggers

into a bunk.

BILLY, fists clenched, yells a string of Turkish curse

words at him:

Lunges.

ZIAT is bulky, throws the smaller BILLY off and scrambles

past a bunk.

BILLY is up and after him. Jumps back as a SHIV cuts the

air in front of him. His side is cut.

ZIAT holding the shiv, feints, cursing BILLY in Turkish.

BILLY skips back, takes a MATTRESS off the bed and runs it

right into KNOCKING HIM AND THE WHOLE BUNK OVER.

THE TWO scramble around, BILLY tackling him into another

BUNK which also goes over. Chairs break.

ZIAT butts his head into BILLY'S jaw.

BILLY staggers back from the blow and ZIAT jumps him, BITING

into his ear.

ZIAT, getting a better hold, now BITES into BILLY'S NOSE.

BILLY slams ZIAT in the nose hard with the palm of his

hand.  ZIAT relinquishes his hold, grabbing at his broken

bleeding nose.

BILLY beats him around the head but though the blood now

flows and teeth are broken, is like a clumsy bear, hard to

kill.

ZIAT scrambles away on his knees under another BUNK now

screaming as loud as he can.

SEVERAL PRISONERS watching from further down the SECOND

STORY Kogus now move in sync, turning on their RADIOS loud

as possible, drowning out the cries for help, others

watching the stairs.

BILLY takes the BUNK and throws it over, revealing ZIAT

cowering in pure terror. He grabs ZIAT by the hair, hauls

him up and

LAUNCHES HIS KNEE into HIS FACE.

ZIAT thuds onto the floor.

BILLY stomps him in the gut hard.

ZIAT screams unnaturally shrill.

BILLY, driven by supernatural anger, now jumps on him and

CLAMPS HIS MOUTH right on ZIAT'S open SCREAM.

A STRUGGLING KISS ensues.

BILLY pulls back, his mouth filled with blood, spitting

out.

AN UNIDENTIFIED PIECE OF FLESH which Bits the ground with

an odd slow motion grace.

ZIAT - CLOSE in terror; throat cords rippling; eyes bulging

with disbelief, body quivering, mouth open and screaming,

but it is a SILENT SCREAM and the mouth is a dark hole

filled with blood and without a TONGUE.

BILLY, without a moment's mercy, crashes his fist into

ZIAT'S face.

ZIAT his strength now broken, collapses on his back.

BILLY crashes his fist again into the hated face. He is

GRABBED now by a GUARD, but:

ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY shakes the GUARD OFF, then as ANOTHER

GUARD runs up, BILLY SLAMS him aside and, obsessed, lunges

back down on ZIAT and

BOTH HANDS CLAMPED TOGETHER high in the air delivers a

final blow to ZIAT'S face. The bones shatter. Pause. His

ogre unconscious beneath him, BILLY, now in SLOW MOTION,

EXTENDS HIS ARMS IN THE AIR - in the fighter's victory

gesture, and his eyes glow with the fever in them, and

with his mouth and face bloodied, he looks like a savage.

No longer Billy Hayes.

BILLY bound in a thick leather belt (a kiyis) which screws

tightly around the waist and cinches the hands together,

is being HAULED in continuing SLOW MOTION through a huge

DOOR somewhere in one of the cavernous corridors of the

prison.The door is approximately NINE FEET by SIX FEET,

strong and wooden with a circular iron handle which one of

the GUARDS now pulls open; a GLIMPSE of darkness within.

THE DOOR CLOSES. SUPERIMPOSE:

MAX, barely recognizable in a torn sheet and with a

blackened face, comes rushing into a crowded ROOM, screaming

louder than any other inmate. marks on his face, He is

enraged, blood dripping from scratch ATTENDANTS in white

smocks chase him over the beds. Max is yelling in Turkish.

The ATTENDANTS wrestle with him, but he throws them off,

tearing around the room mindlessly. In the process we see

that not much attention is paid him because everybody else

is crazy!  There are 50 other LUNATICS yelling at each

other in fights over sheets, blankets, beds, cigarettes,

jumping: screaming, pushing, shoving; some babbling to

themselves, rocking, crying, chanting, singing.  Several

of them (the craziest) are stark naked. some, wrapped in

torn blackened sheets, patrol the room like quick ferrets,

sharp eyes open for anything they can steal. Others move

in meaningless, blank-eyed silence. The walls are filthy

black and join the ceilings in arches rather than angles,

giving the look of an old dungeon. Fifty beds are lined up

right next to each other so that you walk right into your

bed.  A constant nerve-racking NOISE.

HAMIDOU bursts into the ROOM, the angry look in his eyes

spelling real trouble for Max. MOVE with him as he sweep

sin on MAX and picks him up with one move and SMASHES HIM

against the wall. Max hardly notices.

ANOTHER ANGLE - HAMIDOU takes the leather kiyis from an

ATTENDANT, moves in on MAX and starts clamping it around

him.

AN ATTENDANT walks through the room with an apron containing

several large pockets bulging with red, green, blue, white

PILLS, which he distributes by the handful.

THE LUNATICS gobble them up as if they were candy. In some

of the clustered areas, nine lunatics occupy as little as

three beds.

MAX is tightly bound now by HAMIDOU, but his body arches

against the bindings, his neck straining, his teeth snapping

at the air.  HAMIDOU grabs him with one hand by the leather

waist, hauls him high up in the air and

THROWS MAX half-ways across the room, MAX smashing heavily

against some beds, continuing to SCREAM OFF as:

THE ATTENDANT with the pills-now bypasses BILLY on one of

the beds.

BILLY gobbles them up. He has changed. Lines in his face.

No smile, no sense of humor; a brooding silence about him,

a straight ahead look. He pays no attention to MAX off; he

is in grubby white pyjamas and shower sandals. Rolls back

onto hi& bed with its filthy torn sheet, totally ignoring

the surrounding commotion, and

ANOTHER ANGLE - turning onto his shoulder, BILLY suddenly

finds himself face to face with a dark saddened visage.

The MAN is very young and stark naked but for an old black

rag wrapped around his head and clutched under his chin.

His eyes are yellow, the voice pleading.

BILLY shakes his head sharply --too sharply --and barks,

irritable.

Turns on his other shoulder, trying to sleep.

YOUNG MAN in a surprisingly meek tone.

BILLY, really aggravated now, springs up from the bed, and

in the quirky way the mad and the eccentric adopt walks

determinedly away from the young man, looking back to shake

his head bizarrely at him one more time.

ANOTHER ANGLE

BILLY walking down the aisle bypasses MAX int he kiyis,

rolling on the floor, still screaming in Turkish.

Several LUNATICS are gathered around tormenting him, one

of them yanking on his penis as if it were made of rubber;

another is playing with his ass. A third one, also in a

leather kiyis, is leaning over MAX jabbering and drooling

into his face.

MAX, more enraged by this than the other bodily offences,

lunges up sharply and bites the man's FACE. SCREAMS, etc.

BILLY, paying no attention except for a brief disinterested

glance, keeps going into:

A SECOND ROOM.  MORE  LUNATICS. A screaming OLD MAN is

chasing after another OLD MAN who has stolen his tespe

beads, waving them back at the first old man who howls

with rage, frantic to have his beads back. The second old

man throws the beads to a THIRD OLD MAN who hops across

the beds with the FIRST OLD MAN chasing him. BILLY

intersects.

A LITTLE NERVOUS MAN stares into a broken pocket mirror

fingering the large round carbuncle under his eye, trying

to rub it away with little grimaces and flurries of nervous

motion.

TWO ATTENDANTS in smocks indifferently finish eating on a

newspaper spread across one of the beds; they shake out

the paper.

CHICKEN BONES, ORANGE PEELS hitting the floor. A flurry of

movement, as the LUNATICS scuffle like rats over the left-

overs. AD LIB curses, yells.

AN OLD MAN obscenely gestures to BILLY from his bed.

His blackened teeth leer.

BILLY, seemingly immune to all of this in some private

island of his own madness, walks in his determined way

past a PARTITION to:

A CIRCULAR STONE STAIRCASE leading downwards, the stones

damp, dark, slippery. BILLY continues with the same straight-

ahead determination to:

A LONER LEVEL. at last BILLY's expression changes to almost

childish relief, for here at last is the refuge he seeks

the relative comfort and silence of THE WHEEL.

It is a grim, squat PILLAR dominating the room and bearing

the weight of the ceiling. And around it some SIXTY LUNATICS

trudge slowly, near silently, in counter-clockwise flow.

It is a hypnotic shuffle and BILLY blends right in, sliding

easily into the sluggish, mindless river, his eyes hanging

loosely on the floor, watching:

THE SOOTHING RHYTHM OF FEET shuffling at a comforting pace.

These are the spokes of the wheel.

TWO TINY BARE LIGHT-BULBS give faint, eerie illumination

to the chamber. One one side, a pot-bellied stove flickers,

etching the shadows of the walkers in a strange orange

glow.

SOME LUNATICS, not walking, hover around the stove.  OTHERS

are jammed onto a low L-shaped wooden platform that runs

the length of two walls. of these men are naked, covered

with open running sores over their knees, elbows, buttocks.

But they are much quieter than the upstairs crowd. They

are the lowest order of madmen. They have no minds left.

They are the damned.

BILLY walks among them, expressionless. A tall, thin

cadaverous TURK with a grizzled beard now shuffles up

alongside BILLY, looks at him, walks with him. is about

fifty, his pyjamas relatively clean, looking more sane

than the average but his eyes are bright and scary and his

wet hair is matted down on his head, and big clumps of it

have been pulled out. He speaks with a cultured English

accent.

BILLY is interrupted but keeps his eyes on the ground.

AHMET doesn't wait for an answer.

BILLY doesn't notice, shuffles along.

BILLY pays no attention, keeps shuffling on.  Glances at

him, smiles.

The smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord deep

inside Billy, because Billy glances briefly at this lunatic

who is smiling. Billy looks back at his feet.

BILLY plods on. grins and tries to explain the situation

like a father lecturing a child.

They walk on.  Ahmet's expression changes.

He wraps his rags around himself quite carefully and we

FOLLOW him out of the circle. He drops to his hands and

knees and with a sense of dignity, crawls into the filthy

blackness under the L-shaped wooden platform, disappearing

like a cockroach.

BILLY plods on.

AN OLD WHITE-BEARDED MADMAN the Hoja, grandiose in his

rags, leads MUSLIM PRAYER in the first ROOM. Some of his

followers have prayer mats, others a scrap of sheet or

newspaper; their tones discordant, still pushing and shoving

at each other during the prayer.

TWO SPASTICS can't follow the routine of kneeling and

bending; they tangle up absurdly and fall to the floor in

a ball of arms and legs.

A FALAKA STICK pokes BILLY wake SOUND of the CHANTING fills

room. It is evidently impossible to distinguish night from

day because there are no windows.

ATTENDANTS poke the LUNATICS awake with their "clubs.

A MASS OF LUNATICS in the ROOM all at once.  Attendants

take a redundant and comic head count. The place sounds

like a "yadi yadi room" the noise fearsome.

ANOTHER ANGLE

ATTENDANTS poke around underneath a bed and pull out a

very old trembling VEGETABLE.

OTHER ATTENDANTS wrap an old DEAD LUNATIC with no teeth

and foam on his open lips into a dirty sheet and haul him

away.

BILLY amid the LUNATICS.  We MOVE closer and closer to

him, the head COUNT regressing. The room has become a

torture cell - the NOISE LOUDER, LOUDER, closing in on

Billy.

BILLY is led down a CORRIDOR by HAMIDOU into:

A VISITING room - Cabins are lined up like narrow wooden

phone booths.

BILLY plods without interest to the specified cabin, closes

the door, sits in the chair. No one is there. He waits -

indifferent to any sense of time. Dirty two glass panes

separate visitor and prisoner booths; bars are between the

panes.  An erratic microphone is the method of

communication, giving a weird and distant aspect to the

voice.

HAMIDOU opens a small peep-hole in the cabin door, looks

in unseen as:

TEE VISITOR DOOR opens and SUSAN tentatively walks in

holding a large photo album; it takes several moments for

her to react, and then her face shows the shock.

BILLY stares at her, his face rabid, decaying; if he

remembers her even, he doesn't register it because she is

a shock to him as well. Reality, the outside world all at

once. His mind is spinning, unbalanced, unable to grasp

it.

SUSAN

The MICROPHONE makes her voice jarring, gagged. She looks

silently.  No sobbing, no big sad looks. Just shock.  Shock

of recognition, shock of time gone by.

BILLY looking at her, his eyes moving down to:

BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN, her neck, her breasts straining

against the thin shirt.

SUSAN fingers the photo album nervously, speaking slow and

distinct; not sure she is communicating.

Stops, shakes her head. It sounds all wrong in this context.

BILLY is still staring at her breasts. He hasn't seen a

woman for five years and now a hungry animal look comes

into his eyes He moves suddenly pressing up against the

glass, rabid.  And in Turkish:

His voice is savage, demanding.

SUSAN understands, startled. Looks around.

BILLY

A strange look in his eye.

SUSAN slowly, scared, begins to unbutton her shirt.

HAMIDOU looks on silently, does nothing.

BILLY follows every movement with wild-eyed lust.

SUSAN leans up close to the window.  With both hands on

the front of her blouse, she slowly draws it apart.

BILLY going wild! Against the window. His hand down in his

pyjamas.

HER BREASTS spring free, quivering, full and ripe with a

deep cleavage and hard dark nipples. They hang full and

loose.  FULL SCREEN

BILLY'S EYES - FULL SCREEN.

BILLY beats on the window, working his mouth soundlessly.

SUSAN is shattered, scared of Billy's sanity.

Tears. Fear.

BILLY tightens dramatically and comes right in his pants,

slumps against the window.

SUSAN realizes he has come, surprised.

BILLY looks at her. Furtive, animal shame. And suddenly he

starts to cry. A flood of feelings locked up too long come

pouring out. He murmurs some words, Turkish SOUNDS

sputtering out in his throat, then:

Softly, working his mouth finding it hard to speak.

SUSAN yearning. Tears sprinkling her eyes.

BILLY straining, not out of physical weakness but an

emotional one. Sputters, eyes closed.

It sounds pathetic, lost.

SUSAN is worked up to the limit, tries to hug him through

the window.

Remembers something. Grabs the PHOTO ALBUM with all her

strength, holding it up for him to see through the

glass.Then remembering herself, looks around the room to

make sure they're alone and in a contained voice:

BILLY looks at it listlessly.

HIS P.V.O - SUSAN holding the album open to PICTURES of

his MOTHER and FATHER in front of the house, ROB on a

bicycle, PEG in her cheer-leading outfit.

A certain tone slips into her voice.

BILLY looks from the album to Susan. Possibly there is a

gleam of understanding in his eyes but it is very faint.

An Attendant BANGS on Susan's door, OFF.

SUSAN quickly puts the album away as if it were a hidden

weapon.

She buttons her blouse but her eyes are worried, on Billy.

The ATTENDANT now swings open her door, annoyed.

Susan stands, about to go, then suddenly leans up close to

the bars, hard and practical.

Pause. Silence. She closes her eyes, in pain; she doesn't

think she has reached him. She turns to go, resigned.

BILLY looking at her. Behind him HAMIDOU opens the door.

A calm and cunning look on his face, glancing with Billy

towards

A BRIEF GLIMPSE of SUSAN looking back, the album under her

arm. The door closes.

BILLY, with the same deadened expression as before, comes

down the STAIRS towards THE WHEEL. It is early morning and

the walkers haven't started yet. Billy looks at the Pillar

a dire look of reflection passing over his eyes. Then he

starts walking but in a clockwise motion, opposite the

normal pattern; in the same methodical manner as before.

ANOTHER ANGLE

BILLY, on the inner track, passes TWO LUNATICS who are

walking counter-clockwise. They glare at him, motion for

him to turn around. Billy just keeps walking.

BILLY intersects several more LUNATICS going counter-

clockwise They motion for him to turn.

Tries to block Billy's way, but BILLY shakes his head,

brushes by him - determined.

AHMET Slides up next to BILLY in his rags.

More LUNATICS join the flow, gesturing or grunting at BILLY.

BILLY STOPS, turns, looks at the rest of them slogging in

the usual direction, looks as if he 'sees' them; and he

walks out of the wheel, towards the stairs.

AHMET curious about his unusual behavior, follows BILLY.

ANOTHER ANGLE

BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET at the base of the

STAIRS. BILLY carries on up the stairs.

BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET.  His eyes glint

with special knowledge and he takes AHMET into his

confidence using the latter's tone of voice:

Eyes narrow. Surprise. Fear. He shuffles away.

BILLY looks at him and turns up the STAIRS.

BILLY in his BED. The usual UPROAR. THE ATTENDANT comes by

with the pills, offers a handful to BILLY.

He takes them, puts a few into his mouth, swallows.

Reflective, unsure.  A RADIO playing OFF blares suddenly

with the U.S. Armed Forces Station - JANIS JOPLIN singing

"Take another piece of my heat now, Baby" then it's switched

back to a TURKISH STATION, loud. Billy rises.

BILLY enters the TOILET with the PHOTO ALBUM tightly

clutched under his arm. A dark stone room, very shadowy.

Piles of waste on the floor. A vacant-eyed barefoot LUNATIC

shuffles past BILLY who goes to one of the four partitioned

HOLES cut into the floor.

ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY squats over it and with his filthy

long nails he starts to slit open the back binder of the

album Susan gave him. Flickering shadows. He looks up

absently.

THREE LUNATIC FACES stare in at him through wooden slats,

tongues hanging out and drooling - playing with themselves -

OFF.

BILLY makes a lunatic face and SCREAM kicking at the

partition.

THE LUNATICS, petrified, scatter off but ONE LUNATIC skids

in a puddle of urine and crashes onto the tile howling.

BILLY slits open the binder to reveal TEN HUNDRED DOLLAR

BILLS with Pictures of Mr. Franklin' neatly inserted.

ANOTHER ANGLE

BILLY has no particular expression on his face.  Reflective,

staring at the money; he looks up.

A LARGE SILHOUETTE is moving towards him.

BILLY just watches, transfixed, not trying to hide the

money.

HAMIDOU comes into a faint light, looking down at him;

glances at the money. Shakes his head gently.

Reaches for and:

ANOTHER ANGLE - HAMIDOU takes the money from BILLY like

candy from a baby, then takes him by the ear and slowly

lifts him up.  Billy is like a vegetable in his hands.

HAMIDOU leads BILLY roughly out of the lunatic room, pulling

him by the ear.

HAMIDOU still Pulling BILLY by the ear, guides him through

the GUARD QUARTERS.

HAMIDOU leads him up a narrow winding flight of STAIRS.

The tone of his voice indicates a severe reckoning this

time.

HAMIDOU pulls BILLY by the ear into a large echoing BATH.

BILLY looking, bent over by the ear - a hint of awareness

of new surroundings.

ANOTHER ANGLE - the BATH is deserted, spooky with greenish

Yellow fish light flittering down from holes in ceiling

around damp mossy arches. Steam rises off a bath.  Benches,

buckets of water.  HAMIDOU swings BILLY around until he is

facing him.

HAMIDOU makes an elaborate gesture of putting aside his

falaka stick and holstered gun; he will use his hands.

He takes that: stiff arm all the way back to its full arc

and WHACKS BILLY up against the wall.

BILLY bounces back off the wall. The print of Hamidou's

fingers is imbedded like a flaring white rainbow in the

redness of his left cheek. SLAM -  a backhanded whack.

BILLY bounces right back from the wall. steadies him.

THE BLOW, in SLOW MOTION comes sailing into:

BILLY, and we see the brief boxer's distortion of all his

face as he flies upwards and back into:

THE BENCH smashing it. Echo like jarring F.X.

BILLY is held up by the PAJAMAS, steadied. The Turkish

words seem far away, incomprehensible.

WHACK - ANOTHER BLOW, but:

HAMIDOU this time holds onto the pajamas using Billy like

a punching bag.

WHACK - A REVERSE BLOW.

HAMIDOU increasingly excited.

WHACK - ANOTHER BLOW in SLOW MOTION

RIP! - a loud SOUND as HAMIDOU moves with a blur of speed,

and shreds BILLY's pajamas with his hands.

BILLY naked, totally passive, semiconscious. HAMIDOU

suddenly shifts position and snaps Billy into a strenuous

wrestling hold across his knee on the steamy floor. He

loosens him up by cracking his bones along his back.

HAMIDOU - sweat pouring off his face, excited.

A bizarre otherworldly scene. This man is dredging Billy

through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam, the

sweat, and an ethnic identification with a Turkish steam

bath as a bedroom. He loosens his hold abruptly, rises,

moves off as:

BILLY holds himself on his knees, head sunk on his chest,

gasping for breath, about to vomit. Pause; he looks up

horrified at:

HAMIDOU pouring fresh buckets of water on the floor.

SSSSSSSSSS!  The awakened STEAM coils like a snake into

every cranny of the little room.

BLURRED VISUALS - HAMIDOU stripping his shirt off. A huge

muscular flash of chest,

A BELT being snapped open.

BILLY waiting.

A FIGURE moving through the steam, closer.

BILLY backing away from it.

STEAM - a glint of a FACE coming through.  HAMIDOU - his

eyes so intense they seem to burn off the steam like sun

cutting haze. Then disappear again.

BILLY pulls back. A pause. Silence. Cat and mouse.  Then

very suddenly:

A HAND reaches out of the STEAM and GRABS BILLY by the

hair.  A GRUNT, OFF.

BILLY his eyes moving fast.

A FLASH of a huge darkened penis, fully erect cutting

forward into the steam like a from drill, detached from

the rest of the body.

A SOUND - grotesque and so sudden after the silence it

jars the senses. A BLURRED VISUAL then:

BILLY Launching forward in SLOW MOTION, desperation

distorting his features and:

STEAM - then BILLY'S HEAD SLAMS through it in SLOW MOTION

and:

SMASHES the penis with its skull. A horrifying GASP.

BLURRED VISUALS - STEAM - HAMIDOU staggering CLOSE -

surprise, pain...

BILLY MOVING.

A FOOT coming up fast through the steam, connecting again

with the genitals. Another SCREAM.

A BODY hitting the tiles.

BILLY groping for the falaka stick. Raises it.

A STRUGGLE - Two bodies thrashing, one of them screaming

now in pain. A definitive sound then a THWACK! Another

thwack!  The steam seems to clear and

BILLY is on top of the gigantic HAMIDOU smashing him with

the falaka stick with all his might.

HAMIDOU is in contortions, his nose busted and bleeding.

His HAND gripping BILLY by the neck, forcing him back and

strangling him at the same time. Billy is red in the face,

such is the force of this creature but continues to beat

him, harder, harder.  His expression filled with a life

energy, seeded in hatred, that he thought he had lost.

Again, Again -

The BAND slips from his throat, then springs up desperately

again and clenches Billy's whole face with one gigantic

palm, clawing to get in, then just as quickly slips away.

BILLY beats on - again, again.

BLOOD flows fast in agitated swirls into the little pool.

BILLY opens a door gently, moves across an empty CORRIDOR,

dressed in and gun in intense. Hamidou's holster. large

uniform with his He looks shaken, weak, falaka stick dizzy

but

BILLY starts, clenches the falaka stick ready to spring,

spins.

A LITTLE SHOESHINE BOY is his case down the corridor.

BILLY has not seen a child in a long time. get words out,

then manages: Surprised.  Can't get the words out, then

manages:

THE KID shrugs, moves on, looking At Billy strangely.

BILLY goes up a flight of STAIRS.  Ahead, VOICES passing.

He stops. Goes on.

BILLY goes through an empty GUARD QUARTERS.

BILLY is in another CORRIDOR, approaches

A SMALL PORTAL, daylight at its edges.  Locked?

BILLY, tense, tries it. It swings open on:

DAYLIGHT!

BILLY squints.  Adjusting to the harsh sensation.

AN ISTANBUL STREET - TRAFFIC, SOUNDS.  TWO GUARDS

approaching the portal in the distance, drinking soda pop.

BILLY steps back, straightens his clothes, steps out briskly

and at such an angle that

THE TWO GUARDS don't notice him in the traffic  as they

enter the open portal.

LONG SHOT - BILLY walking down the street, looking back,

almost bewildered, not quiet believing this.

TIGHT - RAILROAD TICKET being stamped.  SOUND - SNAP.

MOVE UP to TICKET CLERK behind a grill.

THE CLERK looks puzzled.

BILLY is on the other side of the grill.  A ill-fitting

new Western style suit, a hat over his dyed black hair;

totally paranoid. He hasn't slept in three days and the

bruises from the Hamidou beating now show clearly black

and blue on his face. His eyes are alert, darting around,

his speech clipped and to the point.

THE CLEF!!  Shrugs.

BILLY taken by surprise.

BILLY Moves off a small provincial RAILROAD DEPOT - DAY.

He looks at the:

EMPTY TRACKS - No 'midnight express'.

BILLY, tenser than ever, uses the occasion of buying a

newspaper at an OUTDOOR STAND to study:

THE MAIN SQUARE of the VILLAGE (EDIRNE) - DAY. SOLDIERS

and POLICE are abundant, chattering bustling amid tanks

and half-tracks.  Mountains can be seen in the far distance.

BILLY camouflages his face as best he can in the Newspaper

"Hurriyet" studying:

CABDRIVERS in the Main Square.  Most of them are older,

grizzled looking standing next to their old battered dusty

cabs talking with stray SOLDIERS. Billy's eyes settle on a

YOUNGER DRIVER with longish hair, possibly an ally.

BILLY glances down at his newspaper as a SOLDIER intersects

and his expression goes stony as he sees:

FULL COLOR DRAWING (first page) of a ridiculously fierce

heavy-muscled barechested MAN beating a facsimile of Hamidou

into the ground.  Next to it a blurry badly reproduced

photograph of BILLY with a superimposed GUN in his hand.

You can't really tell it's him.

BILLY, controlling himself, crumples up the newspaper into

a baton, his eyes everywhere.  Be the darting A crosses

square.

ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, intersecting a POLICEMAN who glances

at him, joins the YOUNG CABDRIVER..

DRIVER looks at him neutral.

Billy eyes:

APPROACHING SOLDIERS.

THE DRIVER, noticing Billy's look at the soldiers, gets in

the cab.

BILLY climbs into the back seat, feeling already he has

made a mistake. There is something too alert, too hard in

this young driver.

BILLY P.O.V. - THE MOUNTAINS as they roll in the taxi.

FORESTS - FIELDS.

INTERIOR TAXI

BILLY leaning back in his seat, casual.

Indicates the bruises on his face.

DRIVER looking at him in the rear view mirror. His curiosity

narrowing.

BILLY casually glances out the window.

THE DRIVER studies BILLY in the rear-view mirror. Then:

BILLY looks at him hard. Something's wrong with this man.

Cutting off further conversation, he looks out at:

THE MOUNTAINS of Greece - with longing.

BILLY stares back at:

THE DRIVER whose eyes now move away from the rear-view

mirror under the pressure of the stare.  SOUND OFF loud

machinery.

BILLY turning - in rear window, we see a TURKISH HALFTRACK

pulling alongside the cab, SOLDIERS waving their arms for

the cabdriver to get out of the way.

ANOTHER ANGLE - the HALFTRACK pulls level. The CABDRIVER

slows down, with a curse.

BILLY - beads of sweat trickle his brow

THE PERSONNEL CARRIER, disinterested, pulls past.

BILLY breathes heavily with nervous relief.

THE CAB pulls up to the end of a dirt road.

BILLY has his MAP out, studying it.

ANOTHER ANGLE - the DRIVER, exasperated, waves southwest.

ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY slips him fifty lira. The DRIVER

takes it, muttering under his breath, jams the cab into

gear.

THE CAB follows rutted tracks into low HILLS.

INTERIOR CAB - very bumpy.

BILLY's entire expression changes. It is all over.

A TANK AND HALFTRACK are sitting there by the rutted track,

with SOLDIERS. And a little LEAN-TO with several POLICE.

Also a couple of attack DOGS on leashes. The Driver honks

his horn on the approach.

ANOTHER ANGLE

ANOTHER ANGLE - TWO POLICEMEN and A SOLDIER come sauntering

over, their collars open, beer bottles in hand, slightly

drunk.

FIRST POLICEMAN glances BILLY

SECOND POLICEMAN meanwhile eases his arm down on the OPEN

WINDOW bringing BILLY into foreground. The COP'S mouth is

open and exhaling a wave of beer breath over-BILLY.

BILLY P.O.V. - BEER FACE FOCUS PAST him to SOLDIER at tank

reading "Hurriyet" - the picture of BILLY on page one,

spread for all to see.

DRIVER turning around to address him.

SOLDIER circles the cab from the other side.

BILLY motions to the DRIVER.

THE DRIVER ignores it. Calls out again, louder to BEER

FACE.

BILLY rigid. This asshole of a driver!

BEER FACE glances at BILLY, pulls his head out the window.

Looks down the road. Takes a sip of beer.

SOLDIER, disinterested, moves back towards the tank.

BEER FACE looks in the other direction down the road,

burps.Very conscious of his authority, shakes his head

without looking at the driver.  Moves away.

BILLY nudges the DRIVER.

THE DRIVER impatiently turns and looks straight at BILLY,

aware of his anxiety.

BILLY hardening.

DRIVER calling out.

BEER FACE turns.

DRIVER leans out the window.

BILLY looks around fast.

BEER FACE starts back lazily, half drunk, with the OTHER

POLICEMAN

DRIVER

His eyes grow big suddenly As he sees the barrel of

Hamidou's REVOLVER right in His cheek.

BILLY all business, very quiet.

BEER-FACE advancing looks puzzled, thinks he sees something,

then crouches as:

DRIVER gets out the door crouching, yells.

BILLY firing SHOTS off to distract them has climbed over

the front seat, jams the cab into gear. It stalls! Again

he tries, and now shoots off.

THE CAB Roars past the roadblock.

THE COPS AND SOLDIER, scattered by the shots, now scream

at each other. They run.  SHOTS are fired.

BILLY guns the cab down the road, flying.

CLOUDS OF DUST trail the cab.

THE TANK starts to roll after it. Full speed. The HALFTRACK

follows, the MEN riding it shouting.

BILLY looks back, then looking ahead sees something.

P.O.V - a speck in the far distance. Another ROADBLOCK.

BILLY decides, then -

THE CAB swerves right off the road and jumps into the gently

rolling FIELD on the border of the road, pock marked with

HILLS.

THE TURKS come roaring down the road, pointing to the cab.

LOW ANGLE - the TANK makes a flat out stop, gears grinding.

THE GUN TURRET swings left.

THE CAB in the far distance, at an angle to the tank, starts

running up an incline.

THE TANK FIRES.

P.O.V. - SHELL BLASTS WIDE OF THE CAB.

BILLY, startled, looks back, guns for the top of the

incline.

HIS P.O.V. - ANOTHER SHELL now blasts to his front right,

closer. Something heavy (shrapnel) thuds into the rood of

the cab.

BILLY drives all out.

P.O.V. - THE INCLINE CLOSER, CLOSER, ABOUT TO MAKE IT,

THEN: A BLAST

TANK P.O.V. - the CAB spinning in the blast of the adjacent

shell-burst.

BILLY, shaken but unhurt, staggers out of the cab, looks:

P.O.V. - A WHEEL BLASTED AWAY, FUEL PISSING OUT FROM THE

SHRAPNEL HOLES, SMASHED WINDSHIELD AND FENDER.

THE TURKS are coming up the incline now, like the Cavalry --

some on foot running, others on the HALFTRACK.  BULLETS

whistle and pop nearby.

BILLY running. He tears off his jacket.

SOLDIERS pass the wrecked car, at the top of the incline

shouting, pointing and firing at

BILLY in the distance.

ONE SOLDIER seems lighter than the others and takes off in

a sprint as the OTHERS follow.

THE HALFTRACK now crests the incline and gathering full

gear and momentum, roars off down the slope after Billy.

CLOSE BILLY running sweat all over him. In background, the

HALFTRACK and running FIGURES.

BILLY runs into a high dry cornfield with the sun starting

to set ahead of him in the Greek mountains.

MOUNTAINS - must make those mountains.

BILLY running all out - eyes fixed on them, breathing,

skipping heartbeats.

THE PERSONNEL CARRIER bypasses the FAST SOLDIER who slows

down, panting. Billy has outrun him.

OTHER SOLDIERS run up in the distance.

BILLY, tireless, obsessed, runs right into a POPPY FIELD.It

is a splendid beautiful scarlet red, set off by the dipping

rays of the sun.

HIS FEET smashing down the poppy plants.  Fast - THUCK!

THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!

CROSSCUT the metal TREADS of the Halftrack into the poppy,

mowing down entire rows.

TWO SOLDIERS on the PERSONNEL CARRIER are waving

encouragement to the driver inside. They have him.

ANOTHER ANGLE the HALFTRACK closing the distance on BILLY

now thirty yards apart.

BILLY looking back, starting to fade. Huge wheezing gasps

of breath.

SOLDIERS running up looking at

THE HALFTRACK in the distance.

SOLDIERS yell.

BILLY runs out of the POPPY FIELD into a THIN FOREST.

THE SOLDIERS screaming in the distance, jumping up and

down waving for the halftrack to come back.

LOW ANGLE - the HALFTRACK with the waving SOLDIERS on board

now blasts out of the poppy field at full speed.

BILLY -- he has no chance, In immediate background is the

fast HALFTRACK.

ONE SOLDIER on the HALFTRACK now looking back to the SHOUTS

of his comrades. Confused. Turns bout back to yell something

and:

ENORMOUS EXPLOSION The HALFTRACK disintegrates in a tank

landmine.

BILLY thrown to the ground by the force of the blast, looks

back, GASPS!

A BURNING WRECKAGE. Black spirals of smoke.  Secondary

explosions.

BILLY stumbles up. A gash of blood is on his temple but he

doesn't know it or feel it such is his stress. He runs on,

SHOTS whistling towards him from the poppy field.

TURKISH OFFICER screaming angrily at Billy, cursing, shaking

his fist at the sky.

BILLY, in the forest, is totally out of breath and out of

eyesight of the pursuers. He stops against a tree.  FROG

SOUNDS. The gurgle of water. Muddy ground. He looks:

THE MARITAS RIVER rushing ahead. A strong current.

BILLY peels off all his clothing except his pants, not

delaying one more moment. He feels he must keep going. And

he's right. DOGS are barking OFF.

A SNARLING ATTACK DOG is tearing through the minefield,

fast, ahead of the others.

BILLY looks, sees it.

THIRTY YARDS - the huge DOG coming right at him!

BILLY runs for the edge of the bank and plunges in.

THE ATTACK DOG sprints up to the edge of the river bank

and without a moment's hesitation, plunges right in after

him.

BILLY lashing into the current with a fierce breast stroke,

is swept downstream kicking futilely.

THE DOG, its jaws open and clacking, is also swept down

river.

BILLY going under, coming back up - fighting, still

fighting.

THE DOG struggling sails past as

BILLY hauls himself out of the river, going in a circle,

dizzy. Falls. Struggles up again. Looks back. Must keep

going. Must.

THE BASE OF' MOUNTAIN - hilly, rugged.

BILLY runs, drags, runs again.  He is a lamentable sight -

naked except for ripped wet pants, barefoot, bleeding,

muddied.  Dimly he makes out:

A FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT. Some cows, goats, chickens. NO

sign of people.

BILLY staggers towards it. Wears something. A rooting SOUND.

Stops. Something familiar about it.

A FAMILY OF PIGS snort and root in the mud, little piglets

running around.

BILLY staggers towards them, muttering to himself.

Then yells in the recognition of it

BILLY BILLY falls to his knees in the confined pen; the

pigs run around squealing. Trying to reach out for one of

them, he falls face first into the mud and lies there.

Pause.  A wooden DOOR squeaks open OFF. BILLY slowly turns

his muddy eyes over his shoulder.

BILLY P.O.V. - TWO SOLDIERS, khaki-colored uniforms,

helmets, olive faces, mustaches, approach cautiously from

the farmhouse, rifles ready.  Following them is an OLD

FARMER, Further behind in the doorway is his WIFE and

CHILDREN.

BILLY muttering to himself, in Turkish.

THE SOLDIERS approach close, stand above this strange

figure, look at each other.

BILLY with dimming strength.

BILLY

THE FARMER understands, makes a vigorous nod of his head.

CAR DOOR SLAMS SHUT - and BILLY, his movements still weak,

moves a few steps from the car and stops.  SUBTITLE:

Framing Billy are SUSAN and his FATHER, both silent.  They

look with him at

HIS SISTER, BROTHER, UNCLE, AUNT, SISTER-In-LAW FAMILY

FRIEND - AND GRANDMOTHER, all on the porch of the ordinary

house in BABYLON, LONG ISLAND - DAY; all of them returning

his gaze in that first SILENT moment. Curiosity.

Recognition. Shock. Love.

And then they move. But we don't hear their movements. It

is SOUNDLESS reunion; the SISTER running out first in SLOW

MOTION, the MOTHER following last, crying; the GRANDMOTHER

too infirm to move, the shaking her head from side to side

in SLOW MOTION, her tears lost somewhere in the wrinkles

of her face.

BILLY surrounded by FAMILY - SLOW MOTION - SOUNDLESS.  His

eyes flooding. All the feelings in him.  And deep inside -

a solitary question.

EPILOGUE BLACK SCREEN - SUPERIMPOSE:

And OVER this, the SOUND of a PASSING TRAIN rushing by in

the night - UP, FAST and AWAY.
