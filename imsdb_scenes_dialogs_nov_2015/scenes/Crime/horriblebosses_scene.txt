Looking incredibly weary, NICK WATERS, 30's, enters his

apartment in his business suit. He stumbles into --

He drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens

his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man. PAN

OVER TO the alarm clock which reads "1:23 AM."

MATCH CUT TO:

The alarm clock now reads "4:59 AM." It switches to

"5:00" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off. Nick sits up in

bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself

out of bed. He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the

saddest, deadest houseplant in history.

Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy

leftover containers and crusty condiments. The orange

juice container he grabs is empty.

Damn.

He opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple

boxes of "Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon!" He

pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed

photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD

WOMAN on the cheek. The frame reads: "I Y Grandma!"

Nick sighs sadly.

Nick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a

fork. He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes

his mouth with it.

Nick showers while simultaneously brushing his teeth and

shaving. He loses track and brushes his face with the

toothbrush.

2.

Nick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers

and closet. Clearly, no laundry has been done in a

while.

Nick hurriedly buttons his shirt, tucks it in and begins

tying his tie as the elevator reaches the lobby.

As he drives to work, he dials a number and transfers it

to speakerphone.

JENNA (V.O.)

Hello?

Hey, Jenna, it's Nick.

JENNA (V.O.)

It's five-thirty in the morning,

Nick.

Yeah, sorry. This is like the

only time I have to make any

personal calls. I just wanted to

see if you felt like going out

again because I had a great time

with you on our last date.

JENNA (V.O.)

Our last date was two weeks ago.

You haven't called me since.

I know and that's my bad. I've

been swamped at work --

JENNA (V.O.)

Yeah, I remember. Work was all

you talked about when we went out.

Right. Well, I'm up for a

promotion which will give me a lot

more free time --

3.

JENNA (V.O.)

Listen, I'm actually seeing

someone. And even if I weren't,

the last thing I need is some

career-obsessed guy complaining

about work all the time. See you

around, Nick.

She hangs up.

A soulless four-story building in a drab office park.

Nick exits his car and runs full-speed to the entrance.

Nick bursts through the doors and looks at his watch. It

reads "6:02." He looks up at a security camera with a

flashing red light, indicating he is on tape.

Fuck!

Nick sits at his desk inputting information from a large

PILE of documents into a spreadsheet on his computer.

The clock on his computer turns to "8:00 AM."

HARKEN (O.S.)

Nick.

Nick jumps, startled. He turns to see his boss, DAVE

HARKEN, 40's, standing behind him.

Yes?

See you in my office?

4.

of the lobby security camera footage on a television.

The time code at the bottom of the screen reads "6:02."

We see Nick looking up at the camera and silently

mouthing the word "Fuck!" The image freezes and we PULL

BACK to see Harken holding the remote. Nick stands

across from him.

Here's my concern, Nick. You're a

punctual guy. You understand the

importance of getting to work on

time. So that leaves me to wonder

if there isn't something wrong

with the internal clock in our

security system. What do you

think?

I don't know, Mr. Harken. I might

have been a minute late.

Two minutes according to this. So

either you're a liar -- which I

know you're not -- or our system

is off by a full minute. And if

that's the case, I have no choice

but to dismiss Thomas, our

longtime security coordinator.

Okay, I might have been two

minutes late.

There's an uncomfortable beat. Then --

So you did lie.

No, I --

Harken picks up the phone.

Who are you calling?

Thomas. I'm letting him go.

5.

Wait! Okay, I guess I lied. But

I didn't mean to --

(hangs up phone)

Trust is everything in this

office, my friend. I know you've

been working your tail off for

that promotion, but if I can't

trust you, how can I make you

Senior VP of Sales?

I understand. You can trust me.

Now you sound like my wife.

He glances at a framed photo on his desk.

of the hot, bikini-clad MRS. HARKEN, 30's, standing on a

beach.

`Trust me, honey.' `Trust me.'

Meanwhile, she's making love to

every guy in the neighborhood.

Oh, I'm sure she's... loyal to

How could you possibly know that?

I don't.

Are you making love to my wife,

Nick?

What?! No!

6.

I'm just kidding around. She's

out of your league. No offense.

None taken.

Hmm.

Harken has crossed to a credenza with several bottles of

booze, two glasses and an ice bucket. He begins to fill

a glass with ice and Scotch.

Would you like one?

It's 8:15.

You think there's something wrong

with a man enjoying a drink in the

morning?

No, no. It's fine. I'd love a

drink.

Harken hands him the drink he just poured.

Thank you.

My pleasure.

Harken returns to his chair and sits.

Aren't you having one?

It's 8:15, Nick. I'm not an

alcoholic.

Oh. Well, I only took it because

I thought you were having one.

You took a drink because you

thought I was going to have one?

7.

That doesn't exactly sound like

something a Senior VP would do.

Well, I --

What if you thought I was going to

dip my balls in honey and shaved

coconut? Would you do that too?

Of course not.

Of course not. Anyway, we've

moved up the date of the AGM so

you're gonna need to complete your

due diligence by Monday. You'll

probably need to be here all

weekend.

Okay.

Hey, you want a promotion, you've

gotta earn it. Life's a marathon

and you can't win a marathon

without putting a few Band-Aids on

your nipples.

(huh?)

Got it.

Nick gets up to go.

Nick.

Nick turns back.

That's 18-year-old Scotch. I

can't really pour it back into the

bottle.

Nick, unsure of what to do, picks up the glass and gulps

it down.

8.

That should carry you till lunch,

huh?

A car pulls up outside the modest building.

STACY, cute, 30's, is dropping off DALE STEVENS, 30's,

who wears the scrubs of a dental hygienist.

Boy, I have to get used to driving

with this heavy ring on. I keep

swerving to the left.

Aww. You really like it?

I love it. I feel like a queen.

It's tiny and yellowish.

Well, you're my queen. I love

you, Stacy.

Have a great day at work.

They kiss. Dale exits the car.

Stacy drives off. Dale steels himself for what lies

ahead, then goes inside.

Dale enters the waiting room, passing a few PATIENTS. He

grabs a mask and goggles from a supply room, then heads

9.

Dale finds his boss, DR. JULIA HARRIS, 30's, sexy but

with something a little off, hovering over a patient, MR.

ANDERTON, 50's. Dale seems visibly uneasy.

All right, Mr. Anderton, I'm going

to give you the nitrous now and

your root canal will be over

before you know it.

Dale? Please.

Dale turns the valve on the tank and soon Mr. Anderton's

eyes roll back in his head. Julia shuts the door, picks

up a drill and begins boring into the patient's molar.

(loudly, over the

How are you today, Dale?

I'm fine. Thanks.

You get a haircut?

Uh-huh.

Looks good.

Thank you.

You ever watch that show, `Gossip

Girl'?

Uh, no.

I watched it last night. I'll

tell you, lot of cuties on that

program.

Number 7 scraper, please.

Dale hands her a tool.

10.

Thank you. I fingered myself so

hard to Penn Badgely, I broke a

nail.

Dale sighs and looks down at the unconscious Mr.

Anderton. This obviously isn't the first time Julia has

spoken this way.

I'd let that kid put it in my ass.

Bet he's packing a plus-size

sausage under those True

Religions.

(then, looking up at

Probe.

What?

I need the probe.

Oh, right.

He hands her the tool.

Bet you're no shrimp in the cock

department either, huh, Dale?

Julia, please.

Oh, come on. You know I like to

fool around.

She lifts the patient's limp hand and cups it over her

breast.

Mr. Anderton! Bad!

She smacks the lifeless hand and cackles with laughter.

Okay, enough fun. Let's get back

to work. Water, please.

11.

Dale hands her the Water Jet tool. Julia briefly sprays

some water in the patient's mouth, then casually sprays

down Dale's crotch with it.

Hey!

Sorry, I'm a squirter.

(studying his groin)

I think I can just make out our

friend. Looks like someone is

circumcised!

All right, Julia, listen. You

can't keep doing this.

I know, I know, you have a

She's not my girlfriend anymore.

Stacy and I got engaged last

night.

Julia's whole demeanor changes. She becomes deadly

serious.

What?

We're engaged.

You're actually going to marry

that little dummy?

Hey!

I thought you said she was just a

hole for your dick.

That's a horrible thing to say. I

never said that!

Mr. Anderton GROANS groggily.

12.

I'm very disappointed in you,

Dale.

(then, coldly)

Scaler.

Shaken, Dale hands her the tool.

A medium-sized warehouse building in an industrial

neighborhood.

KURT GAMBLE, 30s, good-looking, sits at his desk. Unlike

Nick and Dale, Kurt seems content in his workplace. A

reasonably cute, but by no means drop-dead gorgeous, UPS

GIRL approaches his desk with a package.

Excuse me? Can you sign for this,

please?

Sure.

Whoa, whoa. Hold on. What is

this?

I'm sorry?

This is one of those hidden camera

shows, isn't it?

What do you mean?

Come on. You're way too good-

looking to be a UPS girl. What

are you, a model? An actress?

What's gonna happen when I open

this box? Is something going to

jump out at me?

13.

Nothing's gonna happen. I'm just

a UPS girl.

Shut up.

You shut up. It's true.

Well, then, I need to take you out

to dinner.

Why?

Because I want to be able to tell

my friends that I took out the

hottest UPS girl in America. Come

on, what do you say?

She considers this briefly, then scribbles her number on

a Post-it note.

Awesome. I'm Kurt.

Myrna.

Pretty name. How's Tuesday?

Macaroni Grill?

Okay.

See you then, Myrna.

She heads off. Kurt opens his DATEBOOK and scribbles

"UPS Girl" in the Tuesday slot. We see every night of

the week is filled with appointments with other women:

"Barnes & Noble girl," "Lauren? Laura?," "Blonde Chick"

and so on.

JACK (O.S.)

Busy week?

Kurt looks up at JACK PELLIT, 70s, the kindly,

affectionate owner of the company.

14.

Hey, Jack. Yeah, just doing my

part for the women of America.

You're what we used to call a

rapscallion.

That sounds a lot more innocent

than `sex addict.'

Walk with me, Kurt.

The two of them head toward the exit.

I wanted to talk to you about --

Last quarter's profits? I ran the

numbers. We're down by 11 percent

year-to-year.

It's this damn recession. What

about cost-cutting measures?

Well, I know you don't want to cut

No way. These people have worked

their asses off for me. There's

no reason they should suffer.

Kurt looks at his boss with admiration. There's a lot of

love between these two.

There's also the issue of our

hazardous waste disposal. We're

paying a lot right now and the

Bolivians have come back with a

very good offer.

You know why it's good? Because

they'll dump our chemicals in

rivers, pollute water supplies and

hurt people. I've spent my life

building this company.

15.

Would you want the Pellit name to

be associated with something like

that?

No, I wouldn't.

As they pass the unisex rest room, they see MARGIE, 30s

and clearly pregnant, looking uncomfortable as she waits

to get in.

Everything okay, Margie?

Oh hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt. I've

just been waiting to get in there

for a while now...

Who's in there?

It's... your son.

Of course it is.

(then, knocking on

Bobby? There's someone waiting.

You almost done in there?

After a long beat, the door opens and out steps BOBBY

PELLIT, late-20s, weasely-looking, sniffing a bit too

much and rubbing his nose repeatedly. There's something

unnaturally energetic about him.

What the fuck?! A guy can't get

any privacy in this place!

It's all yours, Margie.

Margie quickly slips into the rest room and shuts the

door.

You know, Bobby, you seem to be

spending more time in that

bathroom than at your desk these

days.

16.

Well, then, you're fucking stupid,

Dad. Because that's clearly not

true.

All I ask is that you do your part

around here, son.

I do my part. I do other people's

parts. But you just like to ride

my ass because I'm your son. I

don't see you screaming at --

-- dickskin here.

That's because Kurt does his work

and does it well. You could take

a lesson from him.

The only thing I'd take a lesson

from him on is being gay. And I

wouldn't take that lesson because

I don't want to be gay.

Come on, Kurt.

Kurt follows after Jack.

Yeah, that's what I thought.

Jack and Kurt pass a receptionist desk and go out into --

Kurt walks Jack to his Cadillac.

Tell me something, Kurt. Are you

happy here?

You kidding? It's the best job in

the world.

17.

I'm glad to hear you say that.

I'm rewriting my will tonight and

there's going to be a special

place for you in there.

He gives Kurt a hug like a doting father, then climbs

into his car. As Jack pulls out and begins driving

across the parking lot, Kurt waves. Suddenly, the car's

HORN begins to honk in a CONSTANT BLARE. Kurt lowers his

hand as the car veers off the pavement, slowly cruising

into a tree where it stops abruptly, the horn still

honking.

A bewildered Kurt runs toward the car, as we --

Kurt sits at a table looking depressed.

He died instantly. They say his

heart burst in his chest like a

water balloon.

PAN to reveal Kurt is sitting with Dale, who looks just

as dejected.

Wow. Sorry, man. He was like a

dad to you.

I loved him. And I loved working

for him. And now his idiot son is

gonna be in charge. You know how

many times I've caught him doing

blow at work?

PAN FURTHER to reveal Nick sitting beside Dale.

That sucks. You were the only one

of us who didn't totally hate his

job.

Did I tell you Harken tricked me

into having a drink at eight

o'clock this morning? The guy's

the devil.

18.

I thought he was giving you a

promotion.

He is. And he's got to do it

before the General Meeting next

week.

Well, at least your boss doesn't

sexually harass you.

This again?

I'm telling you, she's out of

control. It's a full-on hostile

work environment.

She's a woman who wants to have

sex with you. How bad can it be?

Today she sprayed my crotch with

water so she could see the outline

of my wiener.

Why don't you just fuck her?

I'm engaged!

Oh yeah. Congratulations, by the

way.

Thank you.

There's gotta be other dental

hygienist jobs out there.

I can't apply for another job,

remember?

Oh, right. Because you'd have to

tell them you're a child molester.

19.

He's not a child molester. He

just took his dick out in a

playground.

It was nighttime and I was peeing!

And it's bullshit that I got put

on the registered sex offender

list for that!

It worked out. Julia probably

hired you because she's a sexual

deviant herself.

Why would they put a playground

next to a bar anyway? That's

entrapment.

A SEMI-CUTE GIRL walks past.

Well, I should go see if that girl

wants to bone.

Kurt groans as he pulls himself out of the booth.

I thought you were all broken up

about your boss dying.

This is how I grieve, okay?

Kurt heads off after the girl.

Man. He must be grieving all the

time.

Nick sits alongside five other CO-WORKERS at a conference

table. Harken's chair at the head is empty. Nick pours

himself some water from a glass pitcher on the table.

He did say ten o'clock, right?

20.

Yeah. Do you know what this is

about?

It just said `staff meeting' on

the memo.

Funny how he gets all over me if

I'm a minute late, but he makes us

wait fifteen.

HARKEN (O.S.)

You were two minutes late, Nick.

Nick jumps as Harken enters.

And I didn't know I had to punch a

clock with you.

You don't. Of course you don't.

I'm sorry --

I'm going to attribute this to

your drinking problem.

I don't have a --

(with a smile to the

Let's get started. Shall we?

Nick's eyes narrow. Suddenly, he grabs the heavy glass

pitcher from the table and SHATTERS IT AGAINST HARKEN'S

FACE. Shards of glass fly everywhere as Harken falls

from his chair onto the floor.

SMASH CUT TO:

Harken is fine. Nick is as we left him.

Okay, have we figured out our best

sales distribution plan for the

new model year handsets?

21.

Nick's CO-WORKERS bury their heads in their notes. Nick

tensely raises his hand.

Yes?

I simulated a number of sales

cycles, factoring in likely end-

users, point-of-sale limitations

and specific demographic

variables.

And?

And in my opinion, an open plan

selling process in our top 30

markets along with targeted

upgrade offers to existing

customers promises the greatest

yield.

Harken nods. Is he impressed?

Thank you, Nick. Did everyone see

how he did that? Yes, he may be a

pathological liar and have a

crippling drinking problem, but

when the chips are down, Nick has

what it takes.

Nick glows.

Which brings us to our next order

of business. I've decided who I

want as our new Senior VP of

Sales. He's sitting right here

among you.

Everyone turns to look at Nick.

It's me.

Everyone's head snaps back to Harken.

What?

22.

I've decided to absorb the

responsibilities of the Senior VP

position into my own. I realized

if you want something done right,

you do it yourself. So, I'm going

to be knocking down the wall

between my office and what

would've been the Senior VP's to

create a single, enormous office.

However, as a cost-cutting

measure, I will only be taking 85%

of the additional salary I'm

entitled to. It's called self-

sacrifice, people. Learn from

this.

Harken heads out.

Nick hurries to catch up with Harken.

Mr. Harken, can I speak to you?

What is it?

You've been hinting for months

that I was in line for that

promotion.

And look how hard you've worked.

So you've just been lying to me?

Not lying. Motivating. We're all

on the same team here, Nick.

We're all trying to find Lorenzo's

oil before it's too late for

little Lorenzo. Besides, I'm the

one who's taking on a lot more

work.

23.

(barely keeping it

Last month you kept me working so

late I didn't get to say goodbye

to Gam Gam!

What?

My grandmother. I told you I

needed to see her but you said I'd

be fired if I left early. She

died before I could get to the

hospital.

She taught me how to swim --

Oh, my God. I had no idea... that

you called your grandmother Gam

Gam.

I don't mean to laugh, but that's

adorable.

(off Nick's outraged

Look, Nick, I'm sorry you didn't

get to say bye-bye to Gam Gam. I

make you work late because you're

an invaluable part of this

operation. And I need you in your

current position.

I've been in that position for

eight years now. Why would I stay

here after being treated like

this?!

Because I will see to it that no

one else in our industry will hire

you.

What?

Anyone who interviews you will

want my letter of recommendation.

And I'm prepared to tell them that

you are a dishonest, insubordinate

drunk.

24.

But that's not true! You can't do

this!

Harken gets directly in Nick's face, speaking softly but

intensely.

Let me make this clear, you weak,

little fuck. I own you. You're

my bitch. Don't make the mistake

of thinking you have free will.

Because I can crush you any time I

like.

(stepping back,

Settle in, friend. You're here

for the long haul.

Harken slaps him hard on the back and continues on his

way, leaving a stunned Nick.

Kurt somberly heads to his desk. He's wearing a dark

suit.

PELLIT (O.S.)

Yo, dickwall! What the fuck?

Kurt sees Bobby Pellit standing in the doorway of what

was Jack's office.

What?

You're three hours late. What's

the deal?

I was at your father's funeral.

Maybe that excuse would've flown

when my dad was here, but I'm in

charge now.

That excuse wouldn't have made any

sense when your dad was here.

In my office. Now.

25.

Kurt enters. He notices that the "Jack Pellit" nameplate

has been partially taped over with the name "Bobby"

scribbled in magic marker.

Sit.

Kurt sits. Bobby quickly slips a small mirror and rolled

up dollar bill into a drawer. Kurt sees Bobby has tossed

most of Jack's mementos, achievement awards and photos

with luminaries in the trash.

I've been looking over the books.

You're the accountant. Tell me

why this company is in the

crapper.

It's not in the crapper. It's a

recession. But we're still

profitable.

Bullshit. Look, I know you and my

dad were pals. Frankly, I always

thought it was weird and gay and I

never understood why my dad

thought you were so great. But it

doesn't matter now because he's in

the ground and I'm your boss. And

there's gonna be some changes

around here. First of all...

(pointing to a

What is this `EnviroTech Waste

Management' shit that we're paying

so much for?

Your father made the decision to

pay a little more to dispose of

our chemical waste responsibly.

Yeah, fuck that. We've got an

offer from Bolivia to dump the

stuff for a third the cost.

But that would endanger thousands

of local residents.

26.

So some jungle tribesmen get

cancer. Boo friggin' hoo.

They're not tribesmen. It's a

Look, Bobby, your dad told me very

clearly he'd die before he'd save

money by hurting people.

Well then, we're right on

schedule, aren't we?

Kurt's eyes narrow. He reaches into the trash can and

grabs one of Jack's discarded ACHIEVEMENT TROPHIES and

PLUNGES its pointy end deep into Pellit's chest, impaling

him in his chair.

SMASH CUT TO:

Kurt sits across from an unharmed Pellit.

Oh, and we also need to trim the

fat around here.

(snapping out of it)

What do you mean?

I want you to fire the fat people.

They're slow and lazy and they

make me sad to look at. Start

with Large Marge.

ANGLE ON Margie at her desk.

Margie's not fat. She's pregnant.

I'm not firing her.

Fine. Then fire Professor Xavier

over there.

ANGLE ON a balding, middle-aged man in a wheelchair,

HANK, who sits at a desk near Margie's.

27.

Hank?

He creeps me out. Rolling around

in that weird little chair of his.

I'm not firing anyone! It's like

you don't care about this company

at all.

No shit. You think when I was a

kid I dreamed of running a fucking

chemical company? No. I dreamed

of retiring. Of being fed

tropical fruit on a beach by a

model while she blows me. And as

soon as I squeeze all the profit

out of this place, that's exactly

what I'm gonna do. So here's the

deal. You either fire the fatty

or the cripple, or I fire both of

them.

Kurt sighs as he looks from Margie to Hank and back. At

last, he gathers his resolve and crosses to Hank's desk.

From a RESPECTFUL DISTANCE we watch as Kurt breaks the

news to Hank who reacts with sad resignation.

Kurt turns to see Pellit standing directly beside him.

(loudly, to the room)

Everyone, can I have your

attention please? I've just

learned that Kurt has fired our

dear friend Hank here. I want you

to know that I am as surprised and

angry about this as you are.

What are you -- ?!

This is entirely an accounting

department decision. My hands are

tied.

(then, to Kurt)

You are one heartless bastard,

Gamble.

28.

Pellit heads off. Hank glares at Kurt.

Look, Hank, this was not my --

Fuck you, Kurt.

Hank wheels away, leaving Kurt to face the angry looks of

his CO-WORKERS.

Dale, dressed for work, knocks on Julia's office door.

JULIA (O.S.)

Come in.

Dale enters.

You wanted to see --

He looks up to find Julia sitting at her desk in nothing

but an unbuttoned white lab coat.

Oh, God.

Have a seat, Dale.

Do I have to?

Please.

He sits, then immediately stands again.

Look, Julia, this is ridiculous --

(holding up hand)

I know what you're going to say

and that's exactly what I want to

talk to you about.

29.

Yes, I like to joke around at

work. And sometimes I might cross

the line a bit. But the last

thing I want to do is make you

uncomfortable. That's

unprofessional and I pride myself

on being a professional.

She leans back in her chair and puts her hands behind her

head revealing even more of her body.

So from now on, I want you to tell

me when and if I cross the line.

Now. Right now.

What?

You're naked, Julia!

I'm not naked. You can't even see

my pussy.

Okay, right there! Just saying

`pussy' to me. That's over the

line.

That's over the line? You're

starting to sound like a little

faggot, Dale.

Again! Naked, `pussy,' `faggot.'

All over the line. And probably

Okay, let's not start talking

about illegal, Mr. Pees-on-Young-

Boys.

It was an empty playground! In

the middle of the night!

Even worse. That little boy must

have been terrified.

30.

Julia stands and moves uncomfortably close to Dale. He

tries not to stare at her breasts.

Let's cut to the chase. You're

engaged now. And I respect the

institution of marriage too much

to violate it. That's why you

need to fuck me well before the

wedding. Because the closer it

gets, the less ladylike I'm going

to feel about this whole thing.

I'm not going to sleep with you,

Julia.

We'll see about that.

(then, suddenly

OUT! GET OUT!

Startled, Dale hurries out of the office.

Nick, Dale and Kurt sit miserably over their drinks.

They've all had a few.

I feel like a total sucker.

Harken was never planning on

promoting me.

That coked-out douchebag is gonna

destroy Pellit Chemicals.

She stood there with her breasts

right in my face.

Nick and Kurt turn to Dale.

You know, yours just doesn't sound

that bad.

Why don't you guys quit? It's not

like you're sex offenders.

31.

It's true. I mean, I'm young. I

could go back to school, change

fields.

In the b.g., a GUY has noticed them. He heads over.

Yeah. Why should I care about

protecting Pellit's name when his

own son doesn't? There's a

million jobs out there.

The world is your oyster.

Well, well, if it isn't the Three

Musketeers, Nick, Kurt and Dale.

Still hanging out like high

school, huh?

I don't believe it. Kenny Orkin!

I heard you moved to New York to

work at Lehman Brothers or

something.

I did. Hired me right out of

Yale.

So what are you doing back here?

Don't you read the papers? They

shut us down. I've been looking

for work for the last two years.

It's crazy out here. I can't even

get a job waiting tables.

You? Waiting tables? You were

voted Most Likely to Succeed.

Everyone thought you were set.

Everyone including me.

I'd murder those Lehman Brothers

if I could. Line them up, put one

bullet through their three heads.

32.

Easy, Kenny.

It's just not fair. I was making

high six-figures. Now I can't

even afford this drink.

(holds up glass)

Seriously, you think you guys can

help me out at all?

The three guys exchange uncomfortable looks as they reach

for their wallets.

Uh, sure. Here's a few bucks,

Kenny.

Okay, y'know that's not really

gonna do it for me.

(looking around,

I'll tell you what? What if I

give you guys handjobs? Forty

bucks. We can do it in the

bathroom right here. I'll do the

three of you for a hundred.

You're gay now?

No, I'm not gay.

They look skeptical.

I'm the opposite of gay!

They guys look at each other with eyebrows raised. Nick

mouths "opposite."

Come on. Handjobs for the Three

Musketeers. Let's do this!

The BARTENDER spots Kenny and points at him.

I thought I told you to stay out

of here!

33.

Whoops. Gotta go, guys. Call me

if you change your minds. I'm at

my mom's.

He hurries out. There's a silent beat as the guys

process what they've just witnessed.

The three guys are walking home, all mildly buzzed.

So I guess we're just gonna be

miserable for the rest of our

lives.

What do you mean?

What options do we have? We can

quit our jobs and turn into Kenny.

Or keep our jobs and turn into

sad, ball-less losers who spend

their days dreaming of ways to

kill their bosses.

There's a beat as Nick regards Kurt.

You do that too?

Of course. Everyone does. It's

the only thing that keeps us from

going totally bat-shit.

The other day I imagined shoving

one of those jugs from the water

cooler in Harken's mouth and

making him drink until his bladder

explodes.

Jeez.

That's so funny. I had the same

idea for Pellit.

34.

Only using gasoline instead of

water. And his ass instead of his

mouth.

You guys are sick.

What's sick about it? It's just a

way to let off steam.

Yeah, Dale. It's not like we're

actually going to kill our bosses.

They continue walking. After a beat.

You have to admit though, our

lives would be a lot better if our

bosses were dead.

Well, of course. It's the one

thing that keeps me from being

happy.

Me too.

There's another beat.

Let's just consider this, for one

second.

Consider what?

Killing our bosses. I'm just

being hypothetical here.

(laughing it off)

Yeah, right.

Very funny.

Well, it's not like they're gonna

live forever. These pieces of

shit are going to die someday.

35.

We'd just be accelerating that

natural process.

Shut up, Kurt.

Yeah, shut up, Kurt.

Frankly, I don't see any reason

not to do it.

Well, first of all, killing

someone is illegal and immoral --

It may be illegal but I'm not sure

it's immoral. Sometimes one evil

person has to die for the greater

good of the community. If Bobby

Pellit has his way, hundreds,

maybe thousands of innocent

Bolivians will suffer. It would

actually be immoral not to kill

him.

Nick begins to warm to the idea.

I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam

Gam because of Harken.

Exactly! Who knows how many other

Gam Gams have died alone.

I can't believe you guys are

actually talking about this. I

don't care how bad our bosses are.

We're not murderers.

No, we're not, Dale. We're just

trying to live our lives. But

what are we supposed to do when

someone makes it impossible for us

to live our lives? Do we just

bend over and take it up the ass

forever?

36.

No, we do not!

What you guys are talking about is

wrong and you know it.

Julia's ruining your life. That's

wrong.

Yeah!

She's not ruining my life. If

anything's ruining my life it's

you guys and your drunk bullshit.

If it's bullshit, Dale, then how

come we all want to do it so much?

They reach the corner where they part ways.

I don't want to do it. And when

you sober up neither will you.

We're not killing anyone.

Dale heads off.

I was just being hypothetical.

Yeah, me too.

OFF their ambivalent looks --

Dale is organizing some equipment when a pair of woman's

hands suddenly cover his eyes.

WOMAN (O.S.)

Guess who?

37.

I'm really not in the mood for

this now --

He turns and reacts as he sees it's not Julia, but his

fiancee, Stacy.

Stacy?!

Not in the mood for what?

For... nothing. What are you

doing here?

Julia appears in her office doorway.

I invited her.

She called and said now that we're

engaged, she wanted to offer me

free dental work. And you know

I've had that loose filling for a

while. It's so sweet of you,

Julia.

It's my pleasure. You're part of

the family now.

Uhhhh... I don't know if this is a

good idea.

Why not?

We don't want to take advantage of

Julia.

Dale, there's nothing you could do

that would be taking advantage of

me. Nothing.

(then, to Stacy)

Now what do you say we pump you

full of gas?

38.

Julia leads Stacy into the exam room. Dale cuts them

off.

Wait -- no gas. She doesn't need

to be out.

What are you talking about, Dale?

You know I'm not good with drills.

You don't want your fiancee to

suffer, do you?

OFF Dale's defeated look --

Stacy lies on the chair with the nitrous mask over her

nose. Julia and Dale stand beside her.

Ten, nine... eight... seh...

And she's out. Immediately, Julia pounces on Dale,

feverishly trying to unbuckle his belt.

Hey! Stop it, what are you -- ?

You're gonna give me that dong,

Dale!

NO!

Stacy groans softly. Dale pushes Julia away.

I knew you only brought her in

here to mess with me.

Let's have sex on top of her.

Let's use her like a bed!

39.

Julia begins to clamber up onto Stacy's supine body.

Dale pulls her off.

All right, that's it, Julia. This

is over. You're out of your mind.

I quit!

He goes to turn off the gas but before he can --

I'll tell her you fucked me!

What?

If you don't fuck me, I'll tell

her you fucked me.

Tell her whatever you want. She'd

never believe you.

Julia opens a nearby drawer and tosses an envelope onto

Stacy's chest.

She already knows you're a sex

offender. And once she sees

these, I think she'll believe me.

What is that?

You remember your first week here

when I replaced the crown on your

second bicuspid?

... Yeah?

I took a few snapshots of the

procedure. For my files.

Dale lunges at the envelope and pulls out the photos.

40.

-- Dale lies on the dentist chair, his eyes open and his

hands behind his head with Julia at his crotch,

apparently fellating him.

-- Julia, now nude, straddles Dale, who is naked from the

waist down on the chair. She holds one arm in the air

like a rodeo cowboy.

-- Julia is on the floor, her legs splayed while Dale

lies limply on top of her.

-- Julia is on all fours. Dale is limply draped over her

back, apparently doing her doggy-style.

You... you did all this while I

was unconscious?

Yup.

How did you make it look like I

was awake?

Taped your eyes open.

This is rape! You raped me!

Don't get all dramatic. Your dick

wasn't hard. But it will be next

time. Or else Stacy here gets a

look at my photo album.

She holds up the packet of photos.

Now, let's repair this patient's

filling, shall we?

Dale gapes at her, dumbstruck.

41.

Kurt and Nick are playing a videogame as Dale bursts

through the front door.

Let's kill the bitch.

Huh?

What bitch?

My boss. Our bosses. They need

to die.

Nick and Kurt exchange a look.

We were drunk last night, man.

And didn't you say killing was

wrong?

That was before Julia tried to

fuck me on top of my fiancee's

unconscious body.

Whoa!

I say we kill them all. Are you

guys in or out?

I was in last night.

Yes! Nick?

They both turn to Nick who is uncertain. Kurt spots the

photo of Nick with his GRANDMOTHER and grabs it off the

wall.

Look at her. Look at Bubby.

Gam Gam.

42.

Look at Gam Gam. Getting a smooch

from her favorite grandson.

Little does she know that she'll

never get to say goodbye to him.

And why? Because his shithead

boss wouldn't let him leave. What

would Gam Gam want you to do?

Probably not kill him.

This isn't about Gam Gam. This is

about you. What do you want,

Nick?

I want him to die.

Damn straight!

Okay, I'm in.

All right! Let's do this.

How do we do this?

I was thinking about that on my

way over. Stacy and I watch a lot

of `Law & Order' and there's a ton

of ways criminals mess up. Things

we'd never think of. They leave

behind clothing fibers, bullet

casings, hair, skin cells --

Skin cells?! I can't even keep

track of my keys!

Exactly. And that's why we need a

professional.

What are you talking about, a

hitman?

Dale nods.

43.

You know, that's not bad. I mean,

we don't clean our own apartments,

right? We hire someone to clean

them for us.

Maybe you do, moneybags.

But where are we supposed to find

a hitman?

That's the only problem. I have

no idea.

There's a beat. Kurt's eyes light up.

I do. Meet at my place tomorrow

after work. And make sure you're

not followed.

Why would anyone follow us?

I don't know. People get

followed.

What people?

Just meet me at my place.

Kurt opens the door on Nick and Dale. The decor of

Kurt's place is best described as a middle-income

bachelor pad.

Come in. The guy should be here

pretty soon.

Wait. You actually found

someone?!

It was as easy as buying a used

futon.

44.

He points to his computer. On the screen is a listing

Craigslist?! You found a hitman

on Craigslist.

Yup. But they don't post it as

`hitman.' That would be stupid.

They use code words, like

`liquidation,' `pest control,'

`wet work.' Check it out. This

is our guy.

Nick reads the listing.

`Skilled professional with years

of experience in domestic and

international wet work. Fast and

discreet. No children or

political figures.'

See? He's principled.

This is so dangerous. What if

he's a narc?

Yeah, Kurt. Call him back and

cancel.

It's too late. He's on his way.

What do we do if this guy gets

here and he asks for so much money

that we can't afford him and he

gets mad and kills all of us?

I don't think he'd stay in

business long if he killed

everyone who couldn't afford him.

(looking out window)

Guys! I think this is him!

The others hurry to look. From --

45.

We see a black Mercedes SLK pull up. A distinguished-

looking MAN in a well-tailored suit steps out. He wears

sunglasses and carries a briefcase.

Nice car.

Whoa. This guy's legit.

I bet that briefcase has one of

those guns you have to screw

together.

All right, let's just be

professional here. We don't want

to seem all giddy.

A knock at the door.

How's my hair?

It doesn't matter!

Kurt opens the door on the Man who looks even smoother up

close.

Is one of you Kurt?

(whispering to Nick)

Oh my God, he's like James Bond!

(to the Man)

Yes, hi, I'm Kurt. Please come

in.

Thank you. Are all three of you

participating in this?

46.

Yes, we are.

Very well. Now before we go any

further, I need to know if there

are any hidden recording devices

in this room. I will find out if

there are.

No, no! We definitely don't want

to record this, sir.

Then let's get started.

He walks to the middle of the living room, opens his

briefcase and takes out a plastic tarp which he proceeds

to unfurl over the carpet.

Whoa, whoa. What's that for?

For the mess.

We don't want you to kill us!

Oh my God! I knew it!

Kill you? What are you talking

about?

The guys exchange a confused look.

Your ad said you do wet work.

That's correct. I urinate on

other men for money.

What?!

Why do you think my ad was in the

`men seeking men' section?

47.

You were looking in `men seeking

men'?!

Yeah! We're men seeking a man,

aren't we?

You are such a moron.

So you're telling me I drove all

the way to the Valley and no one

wants to be pissed on?

Please don't kill us.

I don't kill people!

(then, sighing)

Can I use your rest room? I've

stored up rather a large amount of

pee for this.

It's right through there.

The Man heads off. After a beat --

Good thing I didn't call the guy

who was offering to do `dirty

work.'

Kurt drives. Nick is in the passenger seat. Dale in

back.

All right, I'll take the blame for

that one.

That's big of you.

I'm going to make it up to you. I

figured out a much better way to

find a contract killer.

48.

What's that?

Kurt reaches up and pushes a button on the rear-view

mirror. A male voice comes over the speaker.

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

Hello, Mr. Gamble, thank you for

contacting On Star --

Oh, come on!

This is your plan?

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

-- my name is Gregory. How can I

be of service this evening?

Gregory, I need you to direct me

to the most dangerous bar in Los

Angeles.

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

I'm sorry?

We need to find the bar with the

most scumbags, lowlifes and

hardcore shitheads. Can you help

us out?

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

I'm afraid our listings are not

organized by danger, sir. I do

see there is a Bennigan's three

blocks from your current

Okay, Gregory? That's unhelpful.

While I'm sure there are plenty of

shitheads there, they're not the

kind of shitheads we need.

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

I can direct you to the

neighborhood with the greatest

number of car-jackings in your

area.

49.

Now we're talking.

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

Very good, sir. You may wish to

lock your doors.

Kurt and the others lock their doors.

Kurt's car drives down a depressed-looking block.

The guys are still chatting with Gregory.

So, do you like living in

Bangalore?

GREGORY (ON STAR REP)(V.O.)

It's not bad. Humid.

Now, `Gregory.' Is that your real

name?

GREGORY (V.O.)

No, sir. My real name is

Atmanand.

Atmanand? How did you get Gregory

from that?

GREGORY (V.O.)

`Gregory' was assigned to me by On

Star.

Why don't they let you use your

real name?

GREGORY (V.O.)

Many Americans find our real names

off-putting.

Actually, I do find Atmanand a

little off-putting.

50.

GREGORY (V.O.)

You have arrived at your

destination, sir.

Thank you, Gregory./Thanks,

Gregory.

Kurt's car pulls up on a grimy-looking South-Central

street and stops in front of a dingy bar. The guys get

out and look around warily.

This must be the place.

Aren't you worried about your car?

Nah, Gregory's watching it.

You really think we're gonna find

a hitman in there?

I think we're gonna have a hard

time deciding between all the

hitmen in there. Trust me, these

are the lowest of the low.

The three guys enter the squalid, smoky place. The room

is full of surly-looking PATRONS, none of them white.

People turn to stare.

Oh, real nice, Kurt. Way to be

racist.

This isn't a race thing. We need

a criminal and this neighborhood

is where they live. I'm not

saying that's because there are a

lot of black people here. That's

the fault of our society that

discriminates and disenfranchises

them.

51.

You said they were the lowest of

the low.

I was speaking socio-economically.

So what do we do now? Yell out

`anyone here kill people for

money?'

Let me handle this.

They each take a seat at the bar where a no-nonsense

BARTENDER walks over to them.

Yeah?

Hey. How you doing? Nice place.

Listen, does anyone here kill

people for money?

Kurt!

An intense-looking GUY on the next stool notices them.

The fuck did you just say?

Don't get me wrong. This isn't

about race. Our society

discriminates and disenfranchises

(head in hands)

Oh my God.

I'm a small business owner. Who

are you calling disenfranchised?

I didn't mean you in particular.

Right. You mean all black people.

52.

Maybe we should go?

You could do that. Or I could

take the aluminum baseball bat I'm

holding in my right hand and

disenfranchise your teeth from

your mouth.

I vote we go.

The three stand and head for the door.

Okay, we're going. I'm sorry if I

offended you. It was never my --

Oh shit, please shut up.

Okey doke.

The guys come out onto the sidewalk.

This is ridiculous. We're never

gonna find someone to do this for

us.

COCKSUCKER JONES (O.S.)

Yo!

They turn to see COCKSUCKER JONES, 30s, the guy who was

sitting next to them at the bar.

I think I can help you boys.

He gestures for them to follow him into the alley beside

the bar. Kurt and Nick move to follow.

Oh, we're just gonna follow him

into that alley?... All right.

Cocksucker Jones leans in to the three guys.

53.

I heard you're looking for someone

to take care of some business for

you?

Yes, we are. Are you a...

businessman?

(putting out his

Cocksucker Jones.

(unsure whether to

take his hand)

Excuse me?

That's my name.

Your first name is Cocksucker?

And my last name's Jones. You got

a problem with that?

No, no. It's just interesting.

That's the name on your birth

certificate?

Naw, man. It's a nickname. My

real name is Dean.

Oh! Like Dean Jones. The actor

from Herbie the Love Bug.

(quietly to Dale)

I don't think he knows who Dean

Jones is.

I know who Dean Jones is, bitch!

I can't walk around here with that

kind of faggy, cracker name.

So you chose `cocksucker'?

54.

That's right. Nobody fucks with a

cocksucker. `Cocksucker' is the

toughest name there is.

Not `motherfucker'?

I considered Motherfucker. But in

the end, I thought Cocksucker

Jones sounded more badass than

Motherfucker Jones.

I agree.

Okay, here's the thing: we each

work for a boss that we need to

get rid of. Is that something you

might be able to help us with?

It is. Assuming you've got the

cheese.

We've got cheese. How much cheese

are we talking?

For three hits? That's gonna run

you thirty large.

That's a lot of cheese.

We don't have that much cheese.

Isn't there any kind of discount

because we're buying three at

once? Like buy two, get one free.

This ain't the motherfucking Cold

Stone Creamery. It's thirty large

or nothing.

There's no way we can pay that.

55.

Five large.

Wow.

Good negotiating.

That's a lot more reasonable. And

that would be for all three,

Cocksucker?

Yeah.

Great. We're in.

Okay, meet me back here tomorrow

night with the cash. I'll take

care of the rest.

Should we bring the bills in any

kind of special denominations?

No, just, whatever. Small bills.

Got it.

And do you want it in any

particular container, like a

shoebox?

Or a paper bag?

Or plastic. I read an article

that plastic is actually better

for the environment than paper.

Fuck the environment! Just put

that shit in a briefcase.

Got it. Thanks. Come on, guys.

They turn to go, when Dale turns back.

56.

Should we deduct the cost of the

briefcase?

What?!

I mean, assuming we don't get the

case back... We're not getting the

case back, right?

Cocksucker glares at him.

Well, that's like an extra eighty

bucks. Only seems fair that we

should take that out of your end.

We'll cover the briefcase, Dale.

Then let's get a cheap one. It

doesn't have to be real leather.

(then to Cocksucker)

Are you cool with faux -- ?

Kurt grabs Dale by the shoulder and hustles him to the

car.

MUSIC CUE: Frank Sinatra's "(Forget Your Troubles, Come

On) Get Happy"

-- Dale, Kurt and Nick each take a turn at an ATM

machine, withdrawing the maximum amount they can.

-- Nick at his desk at work. He looks over his cubicle

wall and his eyes narrow as he sees Harken directing a

WORKMAN who stencils the words "Senior Vice President of

Sales" below where it already says "President." Another

WORKMAN uses a sledgehammer on the wall of the office.

Nick grins malevolently.

-- Kurt is at his desk in the chemical company. He looks

up to see Bobby Pellit open his office door and lead out

two obvious HOOKERS. Pellit has white powder around his

nostrils. He spots Kurt watching him and he sneers back.

Kurt smiles devilishly.

57.

-- CLOSE ON Dale as he places tooth X-rays into plastic

contact sheets. PULL BACK to reveal Julia is licking his

neck while tweaking his nipples through his scrubs. In

contrast to earlier, Dale appears to be unfazed and

almost amused by Julia's antics.

Cocksucker Jones holds an open briefcase that's empty but

for a single stack of taped together 20-dollar bills.

Looks like it's all here.

Turns out we didn't really need

the briefcase after all. Could've

just used a manila envelope.

Shut up, Dale.

So, Cocksucker, how long do you

think it'll be before you've...

taken care of business?

Here's the thing. I just got out

of doing a dime for some pretty

ugly shit and I'm still on

probation. They're watching me.

So if I step out of line, I go

right back inside.

You told us you could take care of

it.

And I'm gonna. I'm gonna be your

professional advisor. Think of me

as your murder consultant.

We don't want a murder consultant.

We want a murderer.

I knew we were getting ripped off!

Okay, look. This isn't what we

talked about.

58.

Can we just get our money back,

please? Then we'll be on our way.

Sorry, no refunds.

That's five thousand dollars. You

think we're just gonna walk away

and let you keep that?

(getting in his face)

I think you're forgetting who

you're talking to.

Cocksucker pulls back the lower edge of his jacket to

reveal what appears to be the holster of a gun.

Whoa, whoa! We don't want any

trouble.

Now either I give you the advice

you paid for, or you can walk away

with nothing. Up to you.

Look, the whole reason we came to

you is because we don't have the

experience to do it ourselves.

Most killers are first-timers.

Look, the key to a good murder is

making it look like an accident.

Gas leak, brakes failing, suicide,

that sort of thing. If you do it

right, you won't even have to be

there when it goes down.

That makes sense. But how would

we fake three accidents?

You need to stalk your prey, track

their movements, get to know them

inside and out. Where do they go?

What do they eat for breakfast?

Who're they fucking?

59.

You're talking about surveillance

and recon.

But making it look like an

accident won't be enough if the

pigs can pin a motive on you.

Well, we all have obvious motives

for killing our bosses.

So why don't you kill each other's

bosses?

Hey, that's a good idea. Like

Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train.

The Danny DeVito movie?

Yes, the famous Alfred

Hitchcock/Danny DeVito movie.

You're thinking of Throw Mama from

the Train. But it's actually the

same idea. If we kill each

other's bosses there's no link to

us.

That's pretty good.

That's what you're paying me for.

Now ain't that worth five grand?

The guys all AD LIB "no's."

Yeah, well, too fucking bad.

Nick is poring over a stack of documents when his phone

rings.

60.

Kurt and Dale wait in the car outside of Nick's office.

We're outside. You ready for a

little recon?

Yeah. I just need to get Harken

to let me leave early.

What's the difference? He's not

going to be your boss much longer.

If I get fired before we kill

Harken, this'll all have been for

nothing. I'll just be an out-of-

work murderer.

I'll be down in three minutes.

He hangs up then peers over his cubicle wall to see

Harken talking to another EMPLOYEE nearby. Nick takes a

breath, leans over his garbage pail and sticks a

Commtronix pen down his throat. At the sound of Nick's

loud WRETCHING, Harken looks over to see him puking into

the trash pail.

What in God's name...?!

Sorry, sir. I've been fighting

this bug all day. I'll just get

back to work --

Nick wipes his mouth and turns pathetically back to his

desk.

No. Go home. I don't want you

getting everyone else sick.

Oh, okay. Thank you, Mr. Harken.

Nick grabs his jacket and moves to go.

61.

Wait. Take your work with you.

Have it on my desk at six AM.

Nick barely conceals his contempt as he picks up the

stack of papers and heads out.

Disgusting.

Kurt's car pulls up slowly and parks. Kurt, Dale and

Nick slump down in their seats.

Okay, boys, as soon as Pellit

makes a move, we tail him. It is

on now.

Oh, it's on.

Hells yeah!

They watch the house with steely determination.

The guys are bored out of their minds, barely awake.

Dale nibbles on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a

plastic bag.

Ugghhhhh, I can't believe how much

this sucks.

I don't get it. On TV,

surveillance always looks so

great. They've got their cups of

coffee. Their sunflower seeds.

They talk about their lives.

62.

And then, right when they reveal

something really intimate, the

perp appears and they spring into

action.

A long, silent pause as they watch the house...

Are we even sure he's home?

They exchange looks.

(opening his door)

Let's go check it out.

They get out of the car. Dale pockets his sandwich.

The three guys creep around Pellit's patio, peeking in

doors and windows. Finally:

I don't see him.

Kurt is about to try a window when Dale stops him.

What are you doing?

We're not gonna get intel standing

on his lawn. We have to go in.

What about fingerprints? We don't

have gloves.

Here, do this.

Kurt pulls his shirt sleeves down over his hands. Dale

does the same. Nick, who wears a T-shirt, tucks his

hands inside the bottom of the shirt. With some

difficulty, Kurt slides open the window.

Here we go.

The three of them manage to wriggle through the window.

It's not graceful: Dale's foot gets caught on the sill,

causing him to tumble on top of Nick and Kurt. At last,

all three are inside.

63.

Dale, keep an eye out. Let us

know if Pellit's coming.

Got it. Wait, I don't know what

he looks like.

It doesn't matter. Just tell us

if anyone comes.

Got it.

They take in Pellit's living room. There's a leather

sofa, a 60-inch plasma and enormous speakers. On the

wall are framed Ed Hardy posters depicting dragons and

half-naked girls.

Wow. This guy's a bigger

douchebag than me.

Okay, let's split up. Look for

any intel we can use on him.

What kind of intel?

I don't know. I guess we'll know

it when we see it.

Kurt heads upstairs while Dale and Nick look around the

living room.

Hey, Nick? Does this count as

intel?

Nick looks over to see Dale holding in his sleeve-covered

hands an open wooden box filled with white powder.

Holy shit, that's a lot of blow.

God, this must be worth, like, ten

thousand -- oh shit!

64.

Suddenly, the box slips out of Dale's hands. It hits the

floor, sending a cascade of cocaine all over the rug.

What the fuck?!!

Sorry, my sleeves were slippery!

We've got to get that back in the

box.

I've got it.

He kneels and begins trying to scoop up the coke in his

hands. It's an impossible task.

Kurt looks around the room. He doesn't see anything

useful so he heads into --

He flips on the light. His eyes land on Pellit's

toothbrush. He grins slyly.

Dale is still on his knees, scooping up coke, as Nick

returns from the kitchen cradling a Dustbuster in his T-

shirt.

Look out. Let me try this.

Struggling with his hands in his T-shirt, Nick vacuums up

the cocaine from the rug. When he's finished, he pops

open the vacuum's waste receptacle and dumps the contents

back in the wooden box.

Which is now filled not only with cocaine, but bits of

hair, dust bunnies, food and other crap.

65.

I guess we should've emptied the

Dustbuster before we used it.

You think?

Just BELOW FRAME, Kurt removes Pellit's toothbrush from

his ass and returns it to its holder, careful to keep his

hands covered with his sleeves.

He's about to go when he notices a bar of Neutrogena face

soap beside the sink. He looks around deviously.

Dale and Nick are doing their best to pick the crap out

of Pellit's cocaine.

Hey look, there's a piece of

cereal in here. Can't tell if

that's a corn flake or a frosted

flake...

Kurt comes down the stairs.

Okay, my work upstairs is done.

You guys ready to split?

Kurt pulls away from the curb.

We need to be better prepared.

That was totally dangerous and a

complete waste of time.

Not a complete waste.

He pulls a BlackBerry out of his pocket.

Oh no... don't tell me...

66.

You stole that from Pellit's

house?

It's got his calendar and his

contacts. This is what recon's

all about.

Nobody said we'd be stealing.

Shall we pay a little visit to

your boss, Nick?

I guess so. But let's make a stop

first.

Nick emerges from the store with a plastic bag and gets

into Kurt's car.

What did you need to get?

Nick holds up a box of latex gloves.

No more sleeve gloves.

Nice.

Oh man, you should've asked me.

I've got a whole box of those in

my bedside table.

(off their grossed-

Don't judge me.

Take a right up here. Harken's

place is about a mile away.

They drive for a beat. Then --

67.

Y'know... this is kinda, I don't

know... exciting.

Very.

(a little smile)

Yeah.

I guess we're really doing this

now, huh?

I guess so.

A two-story house with a tidy yard. Kurt's car pulls up.

Kurt and Nick begin pulling on their gloves.

Can I have a pair?

You know, last time with the three

of us, it got a little... messy.

What if Kurt and I go in and you

stay here and watch out for

Harken?

Okay -- again, I don't know what

he looks like.

If anyone approaches the house,

assume it's him and give us a

signal.

Fine. I'll honk the horn six

times.

Maybe something a little more

subtle?

68.

Honk the horn four times?

How about you just honk once?

People honk once all the time.

You'll be running in and out of

the house.

Fine. Honk twice.

Okay...

Nick and Kurt get out of the car. After a beat, Dale

remembers his sandwich and pulls it out of his pocket.

Kurt and Nick sneak up to the front porch which is

camouflaged by shrubs. They peek inside.

Looks like the coast is clear.

Kurt tries the windows. They're locked.

Damn. Guess we'll have to break

in the old-fashioned way.

Kurt looks around and spots a small rock beside the

porch. He picks it up and winds back to throw it at the

window.

Kurt, wait!

But it's too late. Kurt has released the rock. It HITS

the window, but instead of breaking the glass, the rock

itself BREAKS into two pieces.

Holy shit. I broke the rock.

No, it's one of those hide-a-key

things. Look...

69.

Nick shows Kurt a key concealed in one half of the fake

rock. He grabs it and inserts it into the front door

lock.

The guys tiptoe in, whispering and tense. The place is

tastefully decorated with attractive furniture and modern

art. There is a vase of flowers on a table.

Wow. This is not how I pictured

his place.

For all we know, he's got a closet

full of skin suits.

A CAT springs out of nowhere, startling them, then runs

off.

Jesus!

Stupid cat.

Let's check upstairs.

They head up.

Dale is finishing the last of his peanut butter sandwich.

He checks the rearview mirror. No sign of anyone.

(singing a la Cher,

`Do you believe in love after

love/I can feel something inside

me say/I really don't think you're

strong enough now...'

Just as Kurt and Nick enter, the cat suddenly jumps out

from behind the door, startling them again.

70.

God damn it! How many cats do

they have?

I think that was the same one.

Little bastard.

Kurt notices a framed wedding photo on the dresser of

Harken and Mrs. Harken.

Damn. That's Mrs. Harken? I'd

like to cover her in cock yogurt.

You want to cover every woman

in... did you say `cock yogurt'?

I did.

Yet again, Kurt and Nick jump as the cat LEAPS out of

hiding with a YOWL then runs off.

Ahhh!

If he's so scared of us, why

doesn't he just leave us alone?!

Dale plays a bowling game on his cell phone.

C'mon, c'mon... yes!

A breeze blows through the open windows of the car,

catching the plastic bag from Dale's sandwich and

carrying it out the window.

Just then, Harken, in running attire, comes jogging up

the street. His eye is caught by the plastic bag falling

from the car window onto the street. He stops and

angrily picks up the bag.

71.

Hey, schmuck.

Dale, surprised, turns to the window.

Excuse me?

You want to tell me why you're

littering on my street?

Oh, I'm sorry, that blew out the

window. I wasn't littering.

I don't care if it blew out of

your twat. Now, get your fucking

Chevy Cavalier the hell off my

block!

Whoa. Sir, there's no need to be

hostile.

Hostile? You want to see hostile?

How about I go in the house and

get my --

Suddenly, Harken begins to choke and his face grows

increasingly red.

Get your what?

With one hand Harken grabs his throat and with the other

he looks at the plastic bag he's holding.

Peanuts?

Huh? Oh, yeah. It was a peanut

butter sandwich.

Harken collapses to his knees. His face is turning blue

now. Dale quickly steps out of the car.

Oh god! What should I do?! Tell

me what to do!

72.

Harken yanks up the right leg of his jogging pants

revealing an EPI-PEN strapped to his ankle. He reaches

for it, but Dale moves faster.

What do I do with this? Should I

inject you?!

Harken nods urgently as his eyes begin to roll back.

Okay, hold on! I got this.

Dale takes the cap off the epi-pen, raises his arm and

jams the needle into Harken's chest. Harken lets out a

grunt.

Did I do it? Did I get enough

in?! I'm gonna do it again!

Dale raises his arm again.

Nick continues to search around the bedroom. Kurt is by

the window.

Do you see a Day Runner or an

address book?

(glances out the

What the...? Dude, check this

out.

Nick joins him at the window and they both react as they

see what appears to be Dale repeatedly STABBING Harken in

the chest, neck and arms. Harken lies motionless on the

sidewalk.

That's Harken! Dale's killing

Harken!

Holy shit! He's really doing it!

Out where everyone can see him.

73.

What the hell is he thinking?!

He's not stopping. He's gonna get

us all caught. We've gotta get

out of here.

What about Dale?

He's a psychopath. We leave him

behind.

Right. Let's go through the back!

As they hurry to leave the room, Kurt stumbles over the

CAT which has appeared yet again. Unseen by either of

them, PELLIT'S BLACKBERRY SLIPS out of his pocket and

lands on the floor at the foot of Harken's bed.

As Dale kneels over Harken to check his breathing, a car

pulls up alongside and MRS. HARKEN steps out. Seeing her

husband on the ground, she rushes over.

MRS. HARKEN

Oh my god! What happened?!

He had an allergic reaction. But

I think he's coming around. Do

you know him?

MRS. HARKEN

He's my husband.

Mrs. Harken kneels beside Harken and supports his head.

MRS. HARKEN

Honey? Can you hear me?

Harken groggily looks down at his torso which is

perforated by dozens of tiny needle marks.

(groggy, to Dale)

Wha-- What did you do to me?

I injected you with your thing.

74.

MRS. HARKEN

He saved your life, honey.

Thank you so much!

She grabs Dale in a warm hug.

Oh, it was nothing.

(to Mrs. Harken)

What's this? What's with the

hugging?

MRS. HARKEN

I'm just thankful that he was

here.

I'll bet you are. Do you know

this guy?

MRS. HARKEN

No. We just --

Are you fucking him, Rhonda?

MRS. HARKEN

Oh, come on.

What were you doing out here,

anyway? Waiting to fuck my wife?

I've never met your wife --

Still a bit woozy, Harken gets to his feet and points at

Dale.

You need to get the hell out of

here.

MRS. HARKEN

Dave, stop it. You should be

thanking him. Why are you being

so suspicious?

75.

Why? Because I know you sleep

around on me. And I'm going to

find out who it is.

MRS. HARKEN

You're being ridiculous.

Am I? What about Maurilio? I see

the way you look at him.

MRS. HARKEN

I am not having sex with the

gardener!

As Harken and his wife continue to bicker, Dale quietly

retreats to Kurt's car.

Nick and Kurt pace nervously.

I can't believe that idiot Dale.

You realize we're all going to

jail because of him.

I can't go to jail. Look at these

eyes. Look at this ass. They'll

be all over me.

Yeah, me too.

Well...

What do you mean `well'? I'd get

raped just as much as you.

No, of course you would. You're a

good-looking guy.

You think you're more rape-able

than I am.

76.

I never said that --

Dale enters.

Oh good. You guys are here. Did

you see me out there?

Yeah, Dale, we saw you.

Pretty neat, huh?

No, it wasn't neat! You stabbed

Harken to death in front of the

whole neighborhood!

Not cool, man.

Wait, that was Harken?

Who'd you think you were stabbing?

I wasn't stabbing anybody. That

was an epi-pen. He was having an

allergic reaction to peanuts and I

injected him.

Kurt and Nick digest this for a beat.

So let me understand this. My

boss, who we are trying to kill,

was dying in front of you and you

saved his life?

Not cool, man.

Wait, you were just mad at me for

killing him and now you're mad at

me for not killing him?!

See, this is why I needed to know

what these people look like!

77.

Hang on a sec. Maybe this recon

wasn't a waste of time. Now we

know Harken's deathly allergic to

peanuts and Pellit has a huge

stash of cocaine.

We could put peanuts in Harken's

house and rat poison in Pellit's

coke!

Everyone would assume that Pellit

just got a batch of tainted drugs.

But Harken must always have that

epi-pen on him.

They consider this for a beat.

I bet he doesn't wear it in the

shower. We could put peanuts in

his shampoo!

Perfect! Two fatal accidents.

And we're not even there when they

happen.

That just leaves Julia.

Tomorrow night, I'll surveil her

and figure out how to take her

down.

Good. I'll get some rat poison

and take care of Pellit. Dale,

think you can get some peanuts

into Harken's shampoo?

I can do that.

All right. That just leaves us

with one final thing to settle.

78.

What's that?

Dale, if Nick and I were in

prison, which one of us would get

raped more?

OFF Dale's confusion and Nick's annoyance --

Nick sits in his parked car watching the house through

binoculars.

Through an upstairs window, he sees Pellit enter his

bedroom. Nick checks his coat pocket and confirms it

contains a Home Depot bag with rat poison inside. Nick

dials his cell phone.

Kurt sits in his car, reading Maxim magazine. Julia's

car pulls up. She gets out, goes to the trunk, opens it,

then bends down to get a bag of groceries. Nick watches

her ass appreciatively as she does and keeps watching as

she heads into her building.

SFX: His cell phone rings.

Hey. Have you learned anything

about Julia yet?

Well, I've learned that Dale is a

homosexual because this chick is

unbelievably hot. How's it going

over there?

I'm just waiting for Pellit to go

to sleep. I wonder how Dale's

doing with Harken.

79.

Dale's car is parked.

Dale watches the movie Precious on his laptop. He

glances over to see Harken turn on the light in his

bedroom. On the seat beside Dale, we see a large jar of

Planters peanuts.

Harken looks around suspiciously, then goes to Mrs.

Harken's closet. He opens it and begins looking through

her clothing. He sniffs one of her dresses and his eyes

narrow. He sniffs himself, then compares it to the smell

of the dress. Unsatisfied, he continues searching around

the room for any incriminating evidence. Suddenly, his

foot comes in contact with something on the floor. He

reaches down and picks up...

PELLIT'S BLACKBERRY.

He turns it on and scrolls down the contacts list to

"HOME" which shows Bobby Pellit's name and address.

Harken's face turns beet red.

Dale ducks down as he sees Harken's garage door opening.

Harken's Porsche 911 pulls out and zooms up the street.

Still scooched down, Dale dials his phone.

Nick watches Pellit performing a series of sweaty KUNG FU

MOVES in a full-length mirror.

Jesus, where does he get the

energy?

Oh yeah.

CELL PHONE RINGS.

Nick answers.

What's up, Dale?

80.

Harken just left his house. I'm

going in.

Good luck, man.

Thanks.

Dale flips on the light and enters clutching the peanut

jar in his gloved hands. He slides open the shower

curtain and Harken's CAT LEAPS OUT at him.

Ahhh!

He regains his composure and finds a bottle of men's

shampoo. As he nervously removes the cap from the

shampoo and the lid from the peanuts, he notices that MR.

PEANUT is STARING right at him. Despite his jaunty top

hat and little monocle, there is something almost

accusing in his look. Dale stares back at Mr. Peanut as

we see his resolve soften.

Nick watches as Pellit finally gets into bed and turns

off his bedside lamp.

Okay. Here we go.

Nick reaches for the door handle as --

SFX: Nick's cell phone rings. Nick jumps, then answers

the phone.

Nick?

What?

81.

I'm not sure if I can do this.

Where are you?

In Harken's bathroom. About to

pour the nuts in his shampoo.

But, I just... I know he's a real

shithead, but he's still a person,

y'know?

Lights appear in Nick's rearview mirror.

(looking down at the

rat poison,

Yeah. I know.

Harken's Porsche pulls up and stops just behind Nick's

car. Harken gets out and heads toward Pellit's front

door.

What should I do? Should I do it?

Suddenly, Nick looks up to see HARKEN knocking on

Pellit's door. In the bedroom, Pellit's light goes on.

What the fuck?!

What?

It's Harken. He's here!

At Pellit's?! Why?!

I don't know. He's knocking on

his door!

How would Harken even know Pellit?

82.

Looking irritated, Pellit answers the door. Before he

can get a word out...

... Harken removes a gun from his pocket and SHOOTS

Pellit twice in the chest.

Nick reacts, slumping down in his seat, horrified.

Oh my god oh my god oh my god...

What? What? What?!

He shot him. Harken shot Pellit!

Oh my god. Is he dead?!

Shhhh!

With shaking hands, Nick reaches for his ignition but

knocks the car keys out. They fall onto the floor of the

car.

Fuck!

As Nick bends down to find his keys, Harken's shadow

looms over him. Nick cowers just out of sight.

Harken looks around. Did he hear something? No. He

calmly but briskly walks away from Nick's car, gets into

his own and speeds off.

What's happening?

Harken's gone.

83.

What about Pellit?

He's not moving. He looks dead.

Shit! What do we do?!

I've got to get out of here before

someone sees me! Meet me at the

bar. I'll call Kurt.

Nick ZOOMS away from the curb.

Nick's car SPEEDS through a red light at an intersection.

A TRAFFIC CAMERA FLASHES as it snaps Nick's photo and

license plate.

With trembling hands, Nick and Dale take deep gulps of

their drinks. Kurt hurries in, looking disheveled. The

ensuing conversation is conducted in tense whispers.

Okay, let's all stay calm and

figure this out.

Calm? How can we be calm? I

watched a man die an hour ago!

A man you were going to kill

anyway.

Well...

What?

I don't know if I had it in me.

Me neither.

84.

I can't believe you guys! You

can't just bail on a plan like

that at the last minute.

You think when it came down to it,

you would've been able to murder

Julia?

Kurt softens.

I don't know. I mean, afterwards,

it was kind of hard to imagine

killing her.

Nick and Dale turn to him, quizzically.

`Afterwards'?

Kurt realizes what he said.

You slept with her, didn't you?

Oh god. Please tell me you didn't

sleep with her.

Kurt lowers his head.

You are a mess.

I know, I know. But it's not my

fault.

Kurt's car is parked across the street.

KURT (V.O.)

At first I was surveilling her

just like I was supposed to...

85.

Kurt watches through her bedroom window as Julia

undresses sexily.

KURT (V.O.)

Then she started deliberately

undressing in front of the window.

With the lights on. She must've

known I was there.

As Julia removes her bra, we see Kurt's face pressed

against his car window, his breath fogging it up.

Julia enters her bedroom with a tray of food. She wears

a skimpy kimono-style robe. She sits on her bed and

unwraps a Popsicle.

KURT (V.O.)

Then she made herself a little

snack. A Popsicle...

We see Julia eat the Popsicle as suggestively as humanly

possible. Then she picks up a banana and peels it.

KURT (V.O.)

... then a banana....

Julia eases the whole banana into her mouth. Then she

picks up a hot dog.

KURT (V.O.)

... and finally a hot dog. I

mean, three penis-shaped foods

cannot be coincidence. And in

that weird order? That's not a

proper meal.

DALE (V.O.)

So you took that as an invitation

to fuck her?

Julia opens her front door, stares straight at Kurt and

beckons him inside with one finger. She walks back

inside, leaving the door wide open.

KURT (V.O.)

No. I took her invitation to fuck

her as an invitation to fuck her.

86.

Kurt opens his car door so quickly he tumbles out

headfirst, planting his face on the street. He jumps up,

but one ankle is tangled in the seatbelt. He finally

extricates himself and hurries to the house as fast as he

can.

There is something clinically

wrong with you.

I know. I'm a rapscallion.

You're not a rapscallion. You're

a whore. A filthy whore.

Hey. Not nice. And besides, I

think I actually solved your

problem, Dale. Julia just needed

a good fucking. I bet she's not

going to mess with you anymore.

Whatever. We have bigger fish to

fry right now. What do we do

about Harken?

Here's what we do. We call the

cops and make an anonymous tip

that Harken killed Pellit. Boom.

Harken's in jail. Pellit's in

hell. Julia's had the crazy

fucked out of her. Our problems

are solved. Boom.

Okay, but we should find a

payphone. We don't want them

tracing the call to us.

Nick, Kurt and Dale emerge from the bar.

Come on, we'll take my car.

The three of them climb into Nick's car.

87.

Before Nick can even pull out of his parking spot, they

hear the WHOOP of a police siren and see the flashing

lights of a SQUAD CAR behind them. The guys' faces go

white.

What the hell?

Nick unrolls his window as one COP approaches his side

and his PARTNER comes up on the other.

Are you the owner of this vehicle?

Uh, yes. Is there something

wrong?

We've got an APB on a black Kia

Spectra, license 4HIG208.

Can I ask why?

A traffic cam caught this vehicle

fleeing the scene of a crime

tonight. I'm going to need you to

follow us to the station.

Officer? This is not my car. Is

it okay if I just -- ?

All three of you, please.

Nick glares at Kurt as the cops head back to their car.

Kurt, Nick and Dale sit in a waiting area looking equal

parts terrified and pissed at each other. Throughout the

following, they speak in hushed voices.

They know everything. We're dead.

I can't believe I let you guys

talk me into this!

88.

Oh, please. We were just being

hypothetical. You're the one who

pushed us to do it.

We can't even say anything about

Harken now.

Why not?

Uh, well, Kurt, being outside the

murder victim's house because I

was planning to murder him

probably isn't the best alibi in

the world.

You know, I didn't actually do

anything illegal, so...

You broke into two people's houses

and stole a BlackBerry!

You gonna rat on me, Dale?

Well, since I'm the only one

without a connection to the

murder, yeah, maybe I will.

That means you'd also rat on me.

Not if I rat on Dale first.

Just then, a burly detective, HAGAN, appears behind them.

Gentlemen, this way, please.

The guys glare angrily at each other as they follow

Hagan.

Nick, Dale and Kurt sit on metal chairs across a table

from Hagan and his equally burly partner, SAMSON. Hagan

slides a PHOTO across the table to Nick.

89.

taken by the traffic camera. His terrified face is

clear, as is the time stamp at the bottom.

Do you want to explain why you

were driving 61 in a 25 zone, a

block from the victim's house two

minutes after he was shot to

death?

I... was drag racing.

(off their skeptical

I am a drag racer. There's no law

against that, is there?

Actually there is.

You were drag racing in a Kia

Spectra?

I don't win a lot.

Here's what I don't understand.

You're at the crime scene. An

hour later when we find your car,

you just happen to be hanging out

with this guy...

(gestures to Dale)

... a registered sex offender --

Tsk tsk.

... and this guy...

(gestures at Kurt and

holds up a wallet)

... whose employee ID says he

works for Pellit Chemicals, the

victim's company.

90.

Wait. My boss was murdered?!

Bobby Pellit?!

You want me to get you a Kleenex?

I can't believe this.

What were you doing near his

house?!

Nick looks at him, pissed.

Where were you during the murder?

I was making love.

`Making love.'

(to the cops)

Let me ask you something,

Detective. Let's say one of us

knew who the shooter was and was

willing to hand you that perp on a

platter. Would he be entitled to

some sort of immunity for that

information?

Both Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him.

No. But he would be entitled to

some sort of jail time. Because

if he knew who the shooter was and

didn't tell us, that would be

obstruction of justice.

A beat.

Well, then I'm glad we have no

idea who the shooter is, right,

guys?

91.

If you expect us to believe this

is all just a big coincidence,

we're going to be here for a long

time.

Okay wait!

Now it's Kurt and Nick who look nervous. Is Dale about

to crack?

Saying that we'll be here for a

long time implies that we can't

leave. Does that mean we're under

arrest?

Samson looks to Hagan who grimaces.

No. We just brought you in for

questioning.

So, you don't have evidence

constituting probable cause to

arrest us?

Not yet.

Well then, we're free to go?

Technically.

Dale nervously stands up, half expecting to be hit.

Come on, guys.

Kurt and Nick, impressed and relieved, stand and head

out.

The three guys head for the exit.

92.

Nice work. Where'd that come

from?

`Law & Order.'

We really showed those guys.

`We'? You were gonna turn us in!

For, like, a second.

SAMSON (O.S.)

Stop!

The guys turn to see Samson holding out a traffic

citation.

(handing it to Nick)

For speeding and running a red

light.

Don't get too comfortable out

there, boys. Our forensics team

is sweeping Pellit's house for

fingerprints and DNA. And they

don't miss much.

We HOLD ON Kurt's face and --

Kurt pulls Pellit's toothbrush out of his butt and

returns it to its holder.

Kurt suddenly looks nauseous.

Kurt drives, Nick is in front and Dale in back.

93.

We are so fucked.

Maybe it's time to lawyer up.

I don't have money for a lawyer.

I gave all my money to Cocksucker

Jones!

Hey, that's right! I forgot all

about Cocksucker. Why don't we

ask him what to do?

We did pay him five thousand

dollars to be our murder

consultant.

Actually, it was five thousand

forty with the briefcase.

OFF their looks --

Cocksucker Jones looks up from his bar stool, surprised

to see Nick, Kurt and Dale.

Oh damn, look who's back. How did

it go with the Strangers on a

Train shit?

Not great. We need your help.

One of our intended victims killed

another of our intended victims.

Cocksucker's eyes go wide.

Shut the fuck up! What kind of

evil geniuses are you?

94.

We don't even know why it

happened. But the cops brought us

in as suspects. What do we do

now?

First things first. I'm gonna

need another five thousand

dollars.

What? No way. You said the last

five thousand would cover this!

Okay, fine. Pay for my drink.

As Nick puts down a few bills on the bar, Dale leans in

to Kurt.

Not the best negotiator, is he?

Let me ask you this -- the guy who

killed the other guy you were

planning on killing, are the

police after him too?

No. They don't suspect him.

All right, so you're gonna need to

encourage him to turn himself in,

by say, kidnapping his wife and

mailing him her earlobe or

something.

That's horrible.

Naw, the earlobe's vestigial.

(off their looks)

All right, how about you trick him

into confessing what he did while

you wear a wire?

A wire. That's good.

95.

Is that how the cops caught you

when you murdered someone?

What the hell are you talking

about? I never murdered anyone.

There's a beat.

What?

Who told you I killed somebody?

You did. You said you served a

`dime' for `some pretty ugly

shit.'

It was ugly.

What was it?

You ever see the movie Snow

Falling on Cedars?

No.

Yes.

I got caught with a video camera

making a bootleg copy of that

movie.

You did ten years for video

piracy?

Hey, that's a federal offense.

They take that shit serious.

I also made the mistake of

representing myself at trial. May

have insulted a few of the jurors.

96.

Hold on. You're telling me we've

been taking murder advice from

someone whose biggest crime was

taping an Ethan Hawke movie?!

So you do know it.

If you're not a murderer, why do

you carry that gun on your belt?

Gun?

He pulls back his jacket to reveal the holster we saw

earlier.

This is a motherfucking iPhone.

He pulls the phone out and shows them.

I feel like such a moron.

Well, you are a moron. You don't

walk into a bar and hand a guy

five thousand dollars just because

he's black.

Come on, guys. Let's get out of

here.

The three of them turn to go.

(calling after them)

Trust me on the wire thing,

though. Worked for Donnie Brasco.

Bootlegged that movie too.

Hagan and Samson pull up in their car and get out.

The detectives enter to find a CRIME TECH leaning over

his computer.

97.

You got something for us?

We didn't find any foreign prints

in the house, but we did get a DNA

match for one of your suspects,

Kurt Gamble.

Where was it?

Pellit's upstairs bathroom. His

toothbrush. It had traces of

Gamble's fecal matter.

That sick bastard.

That's not all. We found feces on

Pellit's hairbrush, face soap,

floss and razor.

Razor?!

The handle. Not the blade. This

Gamble guy put just about

everything in that bathroom up his

ass.

All I care about is that it puts

him inside the house. That's

enough for a warrant for him and

his drag racing, sex offender

friends.

(takes out cell)

I'll call the DA.

Kurt's car pulls up with the lights off and parks.

Kurt is at the wheel, Nick sits shotgun, Dale in back.

98.

Okay, looks quiet. Is the tape

recorder ready?

Dale pulls out a mini-tape recorder and hands it to Nick

along with a roll of surgical tape.

Fresh batteries, fresh six-hour

tape, voice activated.

One of us needs to tape it to our

chest.

I'll do it. I'm the only one

without hair on my chest.

That's `cause you shave it.

I don't shave it. I wax it.

Nick gives Kurt the recorder and Kurt tapes it to his

chest then lowers his shirt.

So what do we do now? Wait for

Harken to come home and ambush

him?

I have a better idea. Let's be in

the house when he walks in. He'll

be so mad, he'll be more likely to

confess.

Right. We'll sit there in the

dark till he comes in, and then

switch on a lamp. That'll freak

him out.

Hey, we should find an office

chair so one of us can

dramatically spin around and face

Harken.

I'll be in the chair.

99.

Why do you get to be the guy in

the chair?

He's my boss.

We could try and find more than

one office chair so the three of

us can spin around at the same

time.

That doesn't sound intimidating.

That sounds like a musical number.

I guess you're right. I'll turn

on the lamp.

So I'm just supposed to stand

there like an idiot?

You're recording it all. You're

the most important member of the

team.

Don't patronize me, Nick.

The guys tiptoe onto the porch, peeking in the windows.

Nick tries the front door... and it swings open. They

look at each other, then quietly head inside.

The LIGHTS suddenly come on.

Surprise!

There are 20 or 30 PARTYGOERS in the house which is

decorated for a birthday party. The guys stand

dumbstruck. The revelry peters out as the guests realize

there are three strangers at the door. Mrs. Harken steps

up.

100.

MRS. HARKEN

Who are you?

Uh... hi... sorry we're late. I'm

Nick. I work with your husband

MRS. HARKEN

Aren't you the young man who

helped Dave on the street the

other day?

Uh, yes. How's he doing?

MRS. HARKEN

He's fine. Thanks to you.

(then, to Nick)

Did I invite you to this?

Before Nick can answer a GUEST at the window calls out.

His car just turned the corner!

Someone get the lights!

As everyone scurries to hide, Kurt finds himself pressed

up against Mrs. Harken, beside the sofa. He checks her

out.

(shaking her hand)

Hi, we didn't formally meet. I'm

Kurt.

MRS. HARKEN

Hi.

Nick didn't tell me that his boss

was married to a model.

MRS. HARKEN

(noticing him now,

I'm not a model.

When did you quit?

101.

We see Mrs. Harken is intrigued. Just then, the front

door opens and Harken enters. The lights come on.

Surprise!

A jittery Harken nearly jumps out of his skin as the

crowd starts singing "Happy Birthday." Mrs. Harken takes

Harken's arm.

MRS. HARKEN

Were you surprised?

Oh, yeah.

MRS. HARKEN

Look, everyone's here.

Almost everyone.

MRS. HARKEN

Who are you talking about?

I think you know.

I need to put my stuff away. I'll

be right back.

He heads off to his study, leaving his confused wife.

She notices Kurt, standing at the buffet, staring at her.

He smiles and winks. Mrs. Harken gives him a little

wave.

He's going off alone. This is our

chance.

You guys ready?

(still staring at

Mrs. Harken)

So fucking ready.

Okay, stay close.

102.

Gotcha.

The three of them head toward the study.

Just as Nick and Dale enter, Harken looks up and sees

them.

What the hell are you doing here?

You come to stab me a few more

times, you lunatic?

And my wife invited you? Are you

fucking her too?

Nick tries his best to suppress his nervousness and be

cool and threatening.

We know what you did, Harken.

What does that mean?

We were there. We saw you kill

him.

So what is this? A shakedown?

You think you can blackmail me

because you saw me kill my wife's

lover?

Nick winces. So close.

Say his name.

Nick and Harken turn to Dale.

What?

103.

The guy you killed. What was his

name?

Trust me, Pellit's name doesn't

matter anymore.

There it is!

(turning to Dale)

Let's go, guys --

He freezes as he sees for the first time that Kurt didn't

accompany them into the study. It's just him and Dale.

Nick looks around, panicked.

Yeah, I killed Pellit --

Hang on. Hold that thought,

because I want to get my friend,

I walked right up to his door and

I shot him in his fucking chest,

and I'll tell you something: I

liked it. So if you think I'm a

pussy who won't do the same exact

thing to some half-assed

blackmailer, guess again.

(looking back at the

You know who really thinks you're

a pussy is my friend Kurt. Let me

go grab him and you can tell him

exactly what you just --

You're pathetic, Waters. You come

into my home, on my goddam

birthday and try and pull this

shit? Well, guess what? You're a

dead man. You...

... you, and your friend Kurt,

whoever the fuck he is. Dead.

Men.

104.

We didn't know it was your

birthday.

Harken has crossed to a drawer and taken out a small

safe. He begins turning the combination lock.

What are you doing? What's in

that?

My gun. Just give me a second.

Nick and Dale exchange a look, then quickly rush out of

the room.

looking thoroughly freaked out, Nick and Dale push their

way through the partygoers.

We had him! We had the whole

thing. What happened to Kurt?

Just then, the door to a guest bathroom opens and Kurt

emerges, buckling his belt and looking strangely red in

the face.

Oh, hey.

`Hey'?! Where were you?!

Uh, I had to go to the bathroom.

Bad salmon puff. Are we ready to

record Harken?

You're too late, Kurt! He

confessed the whole damn thing!

More than once! Then he told us

we were dead men! He's getting

his gun right now!

Oh, man, I'm so sorry. I fucked

up.

105.

Yeah, you --

Suddenly, the bathroom door opens again and out steps

Mrs. Harken, also looking disheveled. She adjusts her

dress then rejoins the party.

(realizing what Kurt

You dick!

Overcome with rage, Nick PUNCHES Kurt in the arm then

rushes to the door. Dale and Kurt hurry after him.

seeing them go. With a grim look, he calmly heads to the

garage.

Nick sits steaming mad as Kurt drives. Dan fiddles with

the tape recorder in the back.

Look, I wasn't thinking. She's so

hot and I'm so weak. I'm a weak,

weak man. I admit it.

From the back seat, we hear from the tape recorder:

KURT (V.O.)

In here? But all those people are

right outside.

MRS. HARKEN (V.O.)

I know. That makes it even

hotter.

We hear unbuckling and unzipping.

MRS. HARKEN (V.O.)

Your balls are so smooth.

KURT (V.O.)

I wax them.

Is there anything you don't wax?

Kurt shrugs. We hear some WET, SMACKING SOUNDS.

106.

Ugh. Turn it off, Dale!

KURT (V.O.)

Oh yeah... oh shit!

MRS. HARKEN (V.O.)

Whoops. That was fast...

Yeah, Dale, turn that off!

A short distance behind a car is following Kurt's. As it

comes closer we see it's a Porsche. And it's driven by a

determined-looking Harken.

Kurt's car turns the corner and stops short.

From the guys' POV we see an unmarked car and a police

squad car parked outside of Kurt's place. Hagan and

Samson stand with two UNIFORMED OFFICERS.

KURT (O.S.)

Holy shit! They must have found

my DNA.

NICK (O.S.)

Turn around! Get us out of here!

Kurt quickly does a U-turn and ZOOMS off in the direction

they came, inadvertently SPEEDING through a red light.

We see a traffic camera FLASH.

clearly showing the three guys, their faces distorted

with panic.

107.

Okay, it's clear that none of us

can go home again. Probably ever.

What?!

I'm sure they have cops at all our

places. I think our best bet is

to get out of the country.

Where are we going to go?

Mexico?

Everyone flees to Mexico. That's

the first place they'll look.

You're right. What about Asia?

We could become kick boxers.

What the fuck are you talking

about?

What if our entire lives have been

leading up to this moment? What

if we were destined from the very

beginning to become Asian kick

boxers?

What if I was destined to smack

you right in the face?

That seems like a lesser destiny.

SFX: Dale's cell phone rings.

Hello?

108.

Julia lies in a bubble bath, a glass of wine on the edge

of the tub.

Hello, lover.

Oh God. Look, Julia, I can't talk

right now --

Kurt reacts at hearing it's Julia. He makes an "I'm not

here" gesture.

No worries, baby. I actually

meant to call your home phone.

You know, to tell Stacy about us.

No! Wait!

I think I've waited long enough.

I'm tired of you playing with my

emotions.

I'm not playing. I'm going to do

it. I swear!

This Friday. At the office.

Fine!

Wait. What are you going to do to

me?

I'm going to... have sex with you.

Details! And be explicit.

Right now? You want me to say it?

Oh, shit. We've got company.

109.

He points out the back window and the guys react as they

see Harken driving directly on their tail.

It's Harken! Lose him!

Lose him? Sure, Nick. His 500

horsepower is no match for my 150.

Say it!

I'm gonna put my penis in your

pussy!

Despite the danger, Kurt and Nick turn curiously to look

at Dale.

Oh, come on, Casanova. You can do

better than that.

I'm gonna make you feel good.

With my tongue... and my fingers.

And whatnot.

Just then, Harken speeds up and SLAMS into the tail of

Kurt's car. Kurt struggles to stay on the road.

Jesus Christ, this guy's nuts!

You going to slap me with your

cock, Dale?

Yes! Yes! I'm going to beat your

face with my cock!

More!

BANG! Harken again HITS Kurt's car from behind. A tail

light shatters.

110.

I'm gonna put my balls in your

hair! I'm gonna spit on your

arms!

Kurt and Nick exchange a baffled look.

See you Friday, you dirty bird.

Julia hangs up. Dale looks like he's been violated.

Nice job `fucking the crazy out of

her,' Kurt!

Maybe I should've spit on her

arms.

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

Good evening, Mr. Gamble.

The three of them JUMP, startled by the sudden voice in

the car with them.

What the hell?

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

This is Gregory, your On Star rep.

Our on-board sensors report that

you have a damaged tail light.

Yeah, thanks, Gregory, we know.

We're being chased by a crazy man

and he just smashed into us!

Kurt looks in the rearview mirror and sees Harken is

still behind them. As his car reaches an intersection,

Kurt swerves at the last second and takes a hard left.

Harken overshoots the turn.

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

Oh dear. I will alert the local

police authorities and direct them

to your location.

No, wait! Don't call the police!

They're already after us.

111.

They think we murdered someone.

Suddenly, Kurt's engine dies and the car comes to a

gradual stop.

Why are you slowing down?!

I'm not! The engine died!

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

I have remotely disabled your

engine.

Why would you do that, Gregory?!

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

It's a standard On Star safety

protocol when we believe a driver

has committed a crime.

I pay nineteen bucks a month for

this fucking service!

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

Please stay with your vehicle.

The police should arrive shortly.

I thought you were our friend,

Gregory!

There's a sound of screeching tires and Harken's Porsche

ZOOMS up behind them.

He's not stopping!

Oh, shit!

Harken's car PLOWS into the rear of Kurt's, forcing it

into the back of a parked car. Even if the engine was

working, there'd be nowhere to go now.

Dazed from the impact, the guys look back to see Harken

slowly approaching on foot, holding a gun in his hand.

112.

Shit, shit, shit...

Harken taps on Kurt's window with the barrel of the gun.

Kurt lowers the window.

I'm guessing you don't want to

information -- ?

Out of the car. All of you.

The three guys nervously exit the car and face Harken who

points the gun at them.

Look, Mr. Harken --

Shut the fuck up! I've got six

bullets in here. So if I want to,

I can shoot each of you twice,

just like I did that bastard,

Pellit. But if I do that, I'll

have to spend the rest of my life

running from the law or rotting in

jail.

Police sirens approaching.

So, you're not gonna shoot us?

No. I have a better idea.

Harken turns the gun toward his own thigh and FIRES.

Unnnnhhhh!

What the -- ?!

As his leg bleeds, Harken wipes the gun off with his

shirt, then suddenly tosses it to Dale.

Catch.

Startled, Dale catches the pistol with shaking hands.

113.

Now I can tell the cops that when

I discovered you three killed

Pellit, you tried to kill me to

shut me up.

That's crazy!

Down the street, two squad cars turn the corner and speed

toward them. Dale looks down at the gun in his hand and

drops it.

Is it? Because I don't see a

shred of evidence proving that I

killed Pellit. It's like I've

always told you, Nick. Life is a

marathon and you can't win a

marathon without putting a few

Band-Aids on your nipples.

Nick deflates. The three guys realize Harken's won.

Then, from the car's open window they hear:

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

Did I mention that this

conversation is being recorded?

Kurt, Nick and Dale exchange a look of shock and relief.

Who said that?

That's Gregory, our On Star rep.

ON STAR REP (V.O.)

My name is Atmanand!

Harken's face falls. He looks around nervously as the

police cars come to a halt.

You can't -- this isn't --

And with that, Harken BOLTS AWAY as fast as his injured

leg will take him. It's not very fast. The guys watch

him for a beat as they share a joyful, exhausted moment

together.

114.

I think this is gonna work out

okay for us.

I told you.

Should we stop him?

Probably.

I've got this.

(looking to heaven)

This is for you, Gam Gam.

Nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in SLOW

MOTION, violently TACKLES Harken to the pavement. Harken

goes down hard, his face SLAMMING against the asphalt.

As the COPS hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of

Harken's neck, pinning him.

Get the fuck off me!

Kurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure.

Hey, Harken, one last thing?

What?!

Your wife gives great head.

Harken struggles wildly but he's helpless.

CUT TO BLACK.

SUPERIMPOSE: ONE WEEK LATER

115.

The sun is shining. Birds are chirping. It's a bright,

new day as Kurt heads into the building.

Kurt enters and looks over at what was Pellit's office.

He smiles when he sees Margie, the pregnant employee, now

running the company. He heads over.

Kurt knocks on the doorframe and enters.

Oh, hey, Kurt. Come in.

Thanks, Margie. I just wanted to

congratulate you on taking over

Bobby's job.

Thank you. Terrible what happened

to him.

Yeah. Tough month for the Pellit

family. Anyway, if there's

anything I can do to help out

before the baby gets here, please

let me know.

What baby?

Your baby.

(beat, offended)

I'm not pregnant.

Yeah, right. Look at that big

belly.

Kurt pats her belly. Margie now looks genuinely pissed

off.

116.

I'm aware that I have a weight

problem, Kurt. It just happens to

manifest itself in my lower

abdomen.

I... oh, my God. I'm really

sorry, Margie --

He falls silent under Margie's death stare.

Kurt, I know you were a favorite

of Jack's. He was willing to

overlook your inappropriate

behavior with female clients and

service people. But you should be

aware, I'm not Jack. And I have

very little tolerance for the

mistreatment of women. So

consider this your first strike.

How was I supposed to know you

were just fat --

Strike two.

Kurt opens his mouth to say something but thinks better

of it. He stands up and slumps out. Life as he knew it

at Pellit Chemicals is clearly over.

Julia enters to find Dale waiting for her. A PATIENT

lies asleep in the chair, his face obscured by the

nitrous mask.

Thank God it's Friday, right,

Dale?

Yeah.

Let's drill this patient and then

you can drill me.

117.

Could we do it on top of the

patient? I like the element of

danger.

You continue to surprise me, you

weird little man.

Julia quickly undoes the patient's belt and yanks his

pants down.

You like that? This getting you

hot?

Oh, yeah.

Julia begins handling the patient's implied genitals

which are obscured by a tray of tools.

(in a puppet voice)

`I wish I was Dale's weenie so I

could have sex with Julia.'

Suddenly, the patient bursts out LAUGHING and sits up.

What the hell?!

The patient pulls off his nitrous mask to reveal it's

KENNY, the guys' former classmate from the bar.

Sorry, Dale. I couldn't keep it

together anymore --

What is this?

Julia, meet my old high school

friend, Kenny.

How do you do?

118.

Kenny will do just about anything

for fifty bucks and that's why I

hired him to help me frame you.

Your days of sexually assaulting

me and your patients are over.

Seriously? This is all you've

got? Your word against mine? I'm

a highly respected professional

and you're two losers.

Three losers.

Dale points to the window where Julia sees COCKSUCKER

JONES outside holding up a video camera. He waves to

her.

You little bastard --

Shut up, Julia. Now, my fiancee

and I are going to take a very

expensive two week vacation which

you're going to pay for. And then

I'm going to come back to a rape-

free workplace. Because if you so

much as look at my ass, I'll have

yours locked up.

With a bounce in his step, Dale strides out of the room.

There's an awkward beat with Kenny and Julia.

I don't suppose you could take a

look at this molar --

OUT! GET OUT!

Kenny scampers out, pulling up his pants as he goes.

Nick is in his new office as a young employee, CARTER,

20's, pops his head in.

You wanted to see me, Mr. Waters?

119.

Hi, Carter. Just wanted to check

if you had a chance to finish

those regional sales projections

yet?

Oh, I think I may need another

day.

Okay. I was hoping to give them

to the marketing guys today, but I

can hold them off.

In the future, it'd be great if

you could tell me if you're going

to miss a deadline.

Carter's eyes narrow. All at once, he rushes at Nick,

grabs him by the throat and HURLS him THROUGH THE PLATE

GLASS WINDOW, shattering it.

Nick plummets forty feet and lands with a SICKENING

CRUNCH directly onto his own car. Just behind him we see

a parking plaque that reads "Nick Waters, Senior VP of

Sales."

SMASH CUT TO:

Carter stands opposite Nick as before.

Sure. No problem, Mr. Waters.

Thanks, buddy.

Nick smiles and closes the door behind Carter. He

settles into his comfy chair and puts his feet up on the

desk.

It's good to be the boss.

CUT TO BLACK.
