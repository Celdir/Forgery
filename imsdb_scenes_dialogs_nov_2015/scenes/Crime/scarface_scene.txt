The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or

Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack.  Tony loves the

his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny

Omar Suarez (El Mono -- "The Monkey") is so named 'cause he

looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish

intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing

between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon

from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the

wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor...with

him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana.

In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline,

flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.

Waldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly

as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move

back to Manny.

The somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South

Miami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens

playing cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the

street.

The ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,

rattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,

jacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and

needing paint.   You'd arrest these guys on sight.

As he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around       (Xl

tilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes

Many of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,

also pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red

and white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-

Silence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- TBE

SUN RAY -- is coming closer.                                (X)

The motel is coming closer in silence.

EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY

Tony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior

corridor to a room marked "9".  Nodding to Angel who            (Xl

remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol,

Tony knocks. Pause.

The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-

inch Columbian, "The Toad". He's in his forties, sports

shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on

his face, like Omar; he's good-natured, a nice guy, he

smiles.

Spreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.

Tony, stepping   into the conventionally tasteless orange and

blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the

windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture inducating

he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not

meant to be a body search.

The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark

Columbian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails,

and short boy-cut hair, "The Lizard"; she's tinier than the

Toad, about five-two.

The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.

#00766                          25

She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the

television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists

intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.

Pause.

Tony paces back towards, the door casually, $0 check Angel

out.. .The Lizard staring at him.     ..

#00766                      26

Pause.   Everthing seems okay.

Tony's eyes check out the bathroom.

It's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a

move somewhere off-center andis now sitting on the bed,

coiled and always watching.

There's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then

commotion.

Tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening

#00766                                        28

A small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the

parking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,

sees nothing, casually goes back in.

Manny    looks     at   his     watch.

Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the

shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the

bathtub.   Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.

Tony, coverd by the two kids, watches from the lip of the

bathroom.   He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their

pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.

Angel      looks at Tony; the             eyes          between   them         steady.     They're

dead     and they know it.

Toad,   well-prepared, connects                     a     voltage    adapter and

extension cord.

Lizard reenters            the room, shakes her head                      at     the     Toad   who

nods and turns             on the whirring machine.

The Toad smiles            amiably       and       angles    the chainsaw              slowly

towards Angel.

The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at                                            his

brains...o.c. we know what's happening as we hear the

chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.

Lizard     has                           on     her       face.     The        machine     cuts    off.

The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his

shirt, examjning  his first cut like a butcher. He glances

at Tony.

#00766                      29

A brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a

strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a

terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.

Manny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with

Chi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel.   They

signal and separate.

The Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched

with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.

Tony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily

dotting his eyes.

He nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel

lying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of

his blood, piss dead.

Manny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram

pistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to

notice.

At the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens....

The kids are starting to strap Tony up to the top of the

shower.

The Lizard watches from the lip of the bathroom, impassively.

#00766                                             30

Tony,     devastated,            spits      in     his     face.

Toad's      eyes     narrow        meanly.

Kid   one    slaps         the    tape       across       Tony's        mouth.

Kid two      reaches        up     to       tighten       the     overhead          strap       to    Tony's

wrist.

The Toad turns on his                       chainsaw          when    suddenly           there's       a

gunshot from the hall.

and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and

shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She

crashes backwards into the room, wounded.  Everything

happens very fast now.

Manny is        at   the lip           of     the bathroom,             he    fires       and    hits      kid

one, who        is   turning,          in     the neck.

Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the

unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling

across   the bathroom.

The      Toad, chainsaw           in       hand,        slashes      at      Manny.

Manny     fires      a     burst       into      him      and     the        Toad    crashes         backwards.

Manny     now      spins    into       a    wall,       hit     in    the      side.

The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at

him.   In b-g., the window simultaneously blows out as

Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.

#00766                                         31

Chi-Chi     climbing         through     the        window     fires    at        him.

Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces

a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-

second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine

pistol.

He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten

craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.

Tony,     yelling, whirls              after     the    Toad.

Manny, holding his side, empties                         his    pistol       on     kid      one     who

is still twitching.

Chi-Chi     sees       Angel,         gags.

The senior citizens, playing Mah-Jorigg on the porch, mutter

in astonishment.

As the Toad staggers out into the parking lot,                                         blood       flying,

chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.

Their      eyes       follow.

As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set

in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.

There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all

that counts.  He stands behind the Toad.

The     Toad   whips         around     to    the     voice, eyes          stark       with        terror.

Tony      empties      the     clip     into    the     Toad,       blowing       hiin      apart.

The bystanders just                   stare, stunned           by    the      ferocity.            Then

an old lady faints.

The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony

turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his

audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance

and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identi-

fication.

quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.

The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor,

dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat

preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Max-my with a phony

effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now

Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the

Rich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their

Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a

eyes lock.

She looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,

curly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and

The    mother is amazed       at the cost        of      the    gift.       Tony pulls

out    another present,       for her.

Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an

He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a decal, a private

joke.   He slaps it on the rear fender. It's the same

sticker we saw earlier of the American flag with the

epitaph, "Will the Last American leaving Miami please bring

the flag."

Elvira   wonders    about       it    as     he    joins     her.

Tony leads her           to    his yellow           Cadillac        convertible   parked   (Xl

They get in the car.

Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing

lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with mas,sive  iron

kettles bubbling with coca paste...across  to a row of ovens

where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians

working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey" as he

passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his

vineyard.

Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on.   In his

skinny  suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his

nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

Tow, awed by the scope of it all,               follows   along,   stops    to

look at a sample of the dried coke.

The      Shadow     stops,   eyeballs    him.

Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then

samples the coke off his thumb into his nose. Pause.                       His

expression says I like it.   He moves on.

The Shadow moves with him.

Looking over the laboratory like it was his.                Omar glances

at him, annoyed.

The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains

to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings

from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.

At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony.     The Shadow sits impas-

sively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar

and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the

glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.

He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements

of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, con-

stantly changing dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).

briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters --

just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the

same stony, loyal expression.

Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.

A beat. He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.

Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.

Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.

Tony shrugs.

Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.

She nods to him in that                   somewhat       uninterested,     rude,

upperclass Latin way.

She   withdraws.     Tony        watches        her   go.

Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars

on the patio table, looks up through them, at the heli-

copter rising off the lawn.

Tony glances    up       at     the    chopper, the servant pouring coffee

for him.
