WALTER VALE, sixty-two, is standing by the window of his

modestly furnished Colonial house. He is holding a glass of

wine and peering out through the drapes.

After a few moments an OLD CAR pulls up. A slightly

overweight WOMAN gets out of the car. She starts to walk up

to the house.

Walter steps back from the window and waits. The doorbell

rings. Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass

down on the end table. And then he goes to the door and opens

it.

She steps into the house and Walter shuts the door. They both

stand there awkwardly. Barbara is tightly wound and

overcompensates with a forced pleasantness.

INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, PIANO ROOM - LATER

Walter and Barbara sit side by side in a very close

proximity.

Walter starts to play the piano. It's a lesson in progress.

Walter keeps playing.

Walter stops.

She passes her pencil through her curved fingers. Walter

looks at her for a long moment.

Walter walks Barbara to the front door. He opens it and then

hands Barbara some money.

it.

Barbara turns and leaves. Walter shuts the door.

immediately notices that the kitchen light is on. Something

is not right.

He turns on the living room light and crosses to the kitchen

table and sets the brown bag down. It's then that he notices

some fresh flowers on the kitchen table. He looks slightly

confused. He looks around the apartment. There is an UPRIGHT

PIANO along one wall.

There is no answer. He walks down a LONG HALLWAY and looks in

the kitchen. Nothing. He walks over to the FIRST BEDROOM and

looks inside. There are signs of someone living there. He

looks in the SECOND BEDROOM. He sees nothing.

Suddenly he hears the sound of running water from the

bathroom. He notices a light under the door. He walks to the

bathroom and listens. A faucet is turned and the water stops

into the hallway.

She has a West African accent.

Suddenly Walter is pushed up against the wall. Hard.

A very angry, YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN is in Walter's face.

He grabs Walter violently by the collar and shakes him.

The Young Middle Eastern Man slams him against the wall. It's

more of a warning shot then a violent act. Walter is

terrified.

Zainab opens the door.

Tarek stares at Walter, trying to make sense of it.

Walter reaches into his pocket and holds up his keys.

Walter is starting to get through.

Tarek is getting nervous.

This catches Tarek's attention.

Walter hesitates.

Tarek looks like he might belt Walter. Instead, he lets him

go and quickly backs up. He paces while trying to gather his

thoughts. Walter doesn't move. Zainab runs into the bedroom.

Tarek looks at Walter for a long moment. It's clear that he's

telling the truth.

Zainab emerges from the bedroom. She is dressed.

down. He is clearly shaken. Tarek shuts the front door.

Tarek walks back toward the bedroom. Walter tries to catch

his breath.

Walter is sitting on the couch with a glass of wine. Tarek

enters and sets down a bag. He picks up TWO AFRICAN DRUMS

next to the piano and places them by the front door.

Zainab enters from the bedroom mumbling something in an

African dialect. She drops a bag and crosses back to the

bedroom.

Walter doesn't respond. Zainab emerges from the bedroom again

with the last bag.

He hands her a SMALL PLASTIC BAG from a local grocery.

She snatches it without a word.

They turn and exit. Walter gets up and walks over to the

front door and locks it.

He stands by the front door trying to process the events.

Then something catches his attention.

WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Walter walks to the window and picks up a handcrafted,

decorative FRAME off of the sill. It is a PHOTOGRAPH of Tarek

and Zainab. They are hugging each other and smiling. Walter

looks down onto the street.

He sees Zainab and Tarek exit the building and cross the

street. Zainab's cart tips on the curb and the contents spill

out onto the sidewalk. Tarek quickly moves to help her.

Zainab yells at him.

Walter watches as they finally collect their belongings and

move down the street.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - LATER

talking in a very agitated tone on his cell phone. Zainab

Walter nods.

The lie is obvious. They are stuck. Walter just nods again.

INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER

in Arabic. He hangs up and rejoins the table.

Walter pours himself some wine. He offers some to Tarek.

Zainab shoots Tarek a glance. Walter misreads it.

Walter nods. Zainab gets up and starts to clear the table.

Her comment is more of an indictment than a pleasantry.

She leaves the room.

Zainab enters.

Zainab starts to put on her coat.   Tarek picks up his drum.

Zainab shoots Tarek a glance.

Tarek and Zainab leave. Walter watches them go and then looks

coat. He removes some papers from his briefcase and then he

notices the drum again.

He sits down in the chair next to Tarek's drum. He takes the

drum between his legs and he hits it a few times.

This time he is slightly more successful at finding a rhythm.

He closes his eyes and bobs his head. He's really getting

into it.

swipes his own turnstile.

Walter passes through. Tarek struggles a bit with both

drums. He gets halfway through when the turnstile bar locks.

He's stuck.

Walter takes Tarek's drum and Tarek quickly ducks under the

turn style that Walter just paid for.

Suddenly a MAN takes Tarek by the arm.

Tarek reacts by pulling his arm away.

He reaches for Tarek again who instinctively moves his arm

again which agitates the Cop. Another COP enters into the

action.

Walter steps up.

Tarek takes out his wallet. He shows them an ID CARD. Walter

steps back to the wall and sets the two drums down. Cop #2

stands between him and the action. Walter can barely make out

what is being said.

Tarek is starting to panic. The two Cops share a look.

Another train passes. Cop #1 asks Tarek a few more questions

SODA MACHINES and TWELVE BLUE PLASTIC CHAIRS. In one corner

wearing a Muslim headdress. Walter approaches the window and

waits in line. The other people waiting comprise a mix of

nationalities: African, Latin American, Chinese, Indian.

The Guard talks to a MAN in front of Walter. The Man has a

Slavic accent.

paper. Walter steps up to the window. He sets a piece of

paper on the window sill.

The Guard takes it.

Walter takes out his wallet.

INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER

Walter is let through a large metal door. There is an X-RAY

MACHINE immediately in front of him.

he steps into a small room. The door slides shut and he is

alone in the small white room until a door on the other side

slides open.

He steps through and walks down a small hallway. On the left

side of the hallway are small, glassed in, meeting rooms for

lawyer consultations.

Walter enters into a large bright room. It resembles a prison

visitation room. Along the perimeter of the room is a clear

fiberglass wall with twenty-five small cubicles. Each cubicle

has one seat and a phone. On the other side of the fiberglass

is another seat and a phone.

Walter looks around the room at the VISITORS and DETAINEES.

INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER

Tarek walks out wearing a blue jump suit. He sees Walter and

smiles.

They each move toward the other and settle into a vacant

seat. They both pick up the phone as they sit down.

Walter hesitates.

Walter complies. He sets down the phone so that he can press

the letter up against the glass. Tarek reads the letter.

Walter looks around the room, trying to give Tarek some

privacy. He watches the various immigrant families speaking

to one another. Tarek taps the glass and points to Walter's

phone. Walter picks it up.

Walter nods as he folds up the envelope and places it back

into his coat.

They both sit for a moment. Unsure what to say next. Finally

Walter's curiosity gets the best of him.

Walter can only nod, unsure of what else to say.

A GUARD walks past and taps Tarek on the shoulder and speaks

to him. We can't hear what is being said.

Suddenly the door opens on the detainee side of the glass and

a VERY YOUNG LATIN WOMAN walks out tentatively. She almost

looks absurd in the oversized blue jumpsuit.

She looks at Walter, unsure if she is supposed to approach

the glass and talk to him. Walter just stares back, also

unsure of what to do. They are caught in awkward moment.

Finally Walter manages a nod. She nods back and smiles. It is

the innocent smile of a child.

Suddenly a female guard appears in the doorway and beckons

the Young Girl back inside. The Young Girl looks at Walter

one last moment before disappearing behind the door.

INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER

Tarek shakes his head.

The Arab Woman is cautious.

Mouna hesitates.

Mouna walks into the apartment. She stands by the door.

Mouna sits.

Mouna nods. Walter leaves. Mouna breathes deeply in an

attempt to control her emotions. She looks around the
