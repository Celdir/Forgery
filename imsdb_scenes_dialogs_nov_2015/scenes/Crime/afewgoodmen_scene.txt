FADE IN:

EXT. A SENTRY TOWER --

-- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.

Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower

cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable

sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very

faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts,

we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible

now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the

steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure

and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT

POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.

Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding

a rifle and staring straight out.

The drum cadence has been building slightly.

A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight

that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into

the distance.

SUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA.

The drum cadence continues, and we

INT. A MARINE BARRACKS

We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then

THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR

where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY,

two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop

when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still

growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it

slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into

INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT

WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in

his bunk.

DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S

shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks

at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --

-- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out

of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and

DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come

out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.

Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision

and professionalism.

-- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto

his mouth and eyes --

-- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.

-- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking

him, just holding his head still --

-- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo. We HEAR four

sharp blasts from a whistle and we

EXT. THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - DAY

and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper

Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a

sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished

silver and brass.

The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds

before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.

As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from

various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game.

Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were

all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same

fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM

that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works.

SUBTITLE: THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, WASHINGTON, D.C.

HIGH ANGLE of the entire band an we end credits.

EXT. A RED BRICK BUILDING - DAY

It's an important building, a main building. A few SAILORS

enter and exit and

A WOMAN

as she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building.

The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early

30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency

to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her

JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...

We follow JO, still muttering, as she walks into the brick

building which bears the seal of the

UNITED STATES NAVY - JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S CORPS

INT. WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

As JO  enters. CAPTAIN WEST and two other officers, GIBBS

and LAWRENCE, sit around a conference table.

Jo lets this sink in a moment.

Jo looks around the room for a response.

JO gets up and walks out.

LAWRENCE goes to the door and motions for JO to come back

in.

EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB

His name is LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE DANIEL ALLISTAIR KAFFEE,

and it's almost impossible not to like him. At the moment

he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread

out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27

Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own

against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.

KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law

School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous

spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life,

passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.

He smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right

between his legs.

He smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel

of SHERBY's glove and into center field.

SPRADLING, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath,

walks up behind the backstop.

He goes back to hitting fungoes.

Swapp! The THIRD BASEMAN takes one in the face.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

About 16 NAVY AND MARINE LAWYERS (several of whom are women)

are taking their seats around a large conference table.

A PARALEGAL is handing out folders and some photocopied papers

to the LAWYERS.

We might notice that one of the lawyers is Lieutenant Junior

Grade SAM WEINBERG. Sam's serious and studious looking. If

he weren't in uniform, you wouldn't guess that he was a naval

officer.

CAPTAIN WHITAKER walks in.

KAFFEE walks in.

He hands KAFFEE some files.

"Oooh"'s and "Ahhh"'S from the other LAWYERS. (Subtle Note:

Kaffee doesn't want to move up in the world.)

WHITAKER hands him a file.

INT. JO'S OFFICE - DAY

JO sits behind her desk. KAFFEE and SAM stand in the doorway.

KAFFEE knocks politely.

JO looks up.

JO is staring at him. KAFFEE doesn't know why.

JO is finding this hard to believe.

JO's deeply puzzled.

KAFFEE and SAM come into the office and sit.

KAFFEE and SAM exchange a look.

During this, she'll hand KAFFEE a series of files, which

KAFFEE will pass To SAM without even glancing at them.

None of this really means anything to KAFFEE.

JO takes another beat to size this guy up.

Passing KAFFEE another file --

She hands it to KAFFEE who hands it to Sam --

KAFFEE gets up without waiting for JO to say --

KAFFEE's gone. SAM's standing in the doorway.

And in VOICE OVER we HEAR --

EXT. CUBAN FIELD - DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

And while we HEAR the letter read in V.O., what we're seeing

is this: SANTIAGO's life in Guantanimo Bay over the last 8

months. He had a rough time of it.

THE SHOTS SHOULD INCLUDE:

-- SANTIAGO running along at the rear of a group of MARINES.

It's been over seven miles and he's matted with sweat. A

SERGEANT runs up along side, grabs his back, and pushes him

to keep up with the group. SANTIAGO falls, struggles to get

back up and keep running, and

EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY

-- SANTIAGO doing push-ups alone in the rain. He's being

supervised by a SERGEANT who sees to it that his face hits

the mud every time down and

INT. MESS HALL - DAY

-- SANTIAGO sitting alone in the mess hall, not a friend

within four seats of him and

EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY

-- SANTIAGO being chewed out by a Lieutenant in front of his

squad and

EXT. ROCKY HILL - DAY

-- SANTIAGO running with the squad of MARINES again, this

time down a rocky hill. It's hot as hell and it looks like

he's gonna pass out.

He stumbles, and the SERGEANT picks him up and pushes him

down the hill. He rolls about 30 feet before he stops. Over

this, we HEAR

At this point, with SANTIAGO's letter still in V.O., we

INT.  JESSEP'S OFFICE - DAY

THE LETTER - DAY

It's the last paragraph of the letter we've been hearing,

and at the moment, we can't see the hands that are holding

it.

And as these last words are spoken, we PULL BACK TO REVEAL

COLONEL NATHAN R. JESSEP, who drops the letter he's been

reading on his desk, where it joins a stack of other letters

just like it.

JESSEP's a born leader, considered in many circles to be one

of the real fair-haired boys of the Corps. He's smart as a

whip with a sense of humor to match. As soon as he drops the

letter, he says

He's talking to his two senior officers. CAPTAIN MARKINSON

is in his late 40's. He's a career marine and a nice guy in

a world where nice guys may not finish last, but they sure

as shit don't finish first. Lt. JONATHAN JAMES KENDRICK is

26, from Georgia, and an Academy graduate.

If you asked him he'd tell you that the gates to heaven are

guarded by the U.S. Marine Corps.

He tosses the letter over to MARKINSON. MARKINSON is looking

it over. JESSEP is waiting for a response.

The room calms down for a moment.

The ORDERLY cones in from the outer office.

The ORDERLY stops.

KENDRICK is gone.

MARKINSON sits.

MARKINSON starts to stand --

JESSEP grabs his hat and walks out, leaving MARKINSON sitting

all alone, and we

EXT. WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - MAIN GATE - DAY

It's maybe a little hazier today than it was yesterday. An

M.P. is waving a procession of three Military Police sedans

and a fourth unmarked car through the gate. The cars drive

through and we

EXT. THE BRIG - DAY

Another red-brick building. A few M.P.Is stand out front as

the cars pull up. As soon as they come to a stop, all the

doors swing open and various uniformed and non-uniformed

officers hop out and move to the unmarked sedan where they

escort DAWSON and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, out of the car.

HAROLD DAWSON's a handsome, young, black corporal. Intense,

controlled, and utterly professional.

LOUDEN DOWNEY's a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm. He's

happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do.

DAWSON's his hero.

The two prisoners stand still for a moment. They might as

we'll be in Oz.

DAWSON doesn't say anything.

EXT.  SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

and KAFFEE's at it again.

JO walks up from behind the backstop.

Jo just stares.

Jo moves close to KAFFEE to say this with a degree of

confidentiality.

KAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech.

KAFFEE doesn't, but he doesn't say anything.

INT. THE BRIG - DAY

And an M.P. is leading KAFFEE and SAM down to DAWSON and

DOWNEY's cell.

DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention. Through the following,

the M.P. will unlock the call door and let the lawyers in.

DAWSON and DOWNEY aren't too comfortable sitting in the

presence of officers, but they do as they're told. KAFFEE's

pulled out some documents, SAM's sitting on one of the cots

taking notes.

KAFFEE tries not to make too big a deal out of this last

piece of news.

KAFFEE kinda strolls to the corner of the cell to think for

a moment.

DAWSON says nothing.

SAM is staring at DAWSON.

DAWSON stares at KAFFEE.

KAFFEE takes a long moment. He picks up his briefcase and he

and SAM move to the door.

KAFFEE smiles at DAWSON.

And as KAFFEE and SAM walk out the open cell door, DAWSON

and DOWNEY come to attention and snap a salute.

They hold the salute until KAFFEE and SAM are well out of

sight, and we

INT.  KAFFEE'S OFFICE - DAY

He's packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the

work day. Lt. JACK ROSS, a marine lawyer maybe two years

older than Kaffee, opens the door and walks in..

ROSS smiles and shakes his head.

He closes the office door.

KAFFEE holds for a moment. Dawson and Downey neglected to

mention this... He packs up his briefcase and cleats.

EXT.  THE PARKING LOT - DUSK

It's dusk and people on the base are going home from work.

We can see the flag being lowered in the background.

KAFFEE's walking toward his car. JO intercepts him and starts

walking along with him.

Jo steps aside and lets KAFFEE got into his car.

HOLD on KAFFEE and Jo. JO smiles.

EXT. SIDEWALK NEWSSTAND - DUSK

KAFFEE IN HIS CAR

He's driving down a Washington street and pulls over at a

sidewalk newsstand.

He gets out of his car, leaving the lights flashing, and

runs up to the newsstand.

As he plunks his 35 cents down and picks up a newspaper, he

engages in his daily ritual with LUTHER, the newsstand

operator.

And we

INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A baby sleeping in a crib pull rack to reveal SAM is standing

over the crib. KAFFEE's sitting on a beer.

SAM joins KAFFEE in the living room.

KAFFEE finishes off his beer, and stands.

KAFFEE nods and puts down the empty beer bottle.

Sam opens the front door for him and they stand out on the

stoop for a moment.

KAFFEE starts toward his car, then turns around.

We hold for a moment on KAFFEE as he walks to his car, then

EXT. THE AIRSTRIP AT GUANTANAMO BAY - DAY

The whole place, in stark contrast to the Washington Navy

Yard, is ready to go to war. Fighter jets line the tarmac.

Ground crews re-fuel planes. Hurried activity.

A 36 seat Airforce Jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a

stair unit is brought up.

HOWARD, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the

passengers begin to got off. Mostly MARINES, a few SAILORS,

a couple of CIVILIANS, and KAFFEE, JO and SAM. KAFFEE and

SAM are wearing their summer whites, JO is in khakis.

KAFFEE and SAM stare out at what they see: They're not in

Kansas anymore.

HOWARD shouts over the noise from the planes.

KAFFEE turns and glares at SAM.

EXT. CUBAN ROAD - THE JEEP - DAY

Tearing along down the road, and now we see a beautiful

expanse of water, maybe 1000 yards across. It's a section of

Guantanamo Bay.

The jeep drives on and we

JESSEP, MARKINSON and KENDRICK are standing as the LAWYERS

are led in.

KAFFEE smiles and nods.

JESSEP smiles.

EXT.  THE FENCELINE - DAY

A SQUAD OF MARINES jogs by as a jeep carrying KENDRICK and

the three LAWYERS cruises down the road.

We FOLLOW the jeep.

KAFFEE turns around and looks at SAM.

INT. THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR - DAY

KENDRICK leads the LAWYERS down the corridor to Santiago's

room.

Two strips of tape which warn DO NOT ENTER - AT ORDER OF THE

MILITARY POLICE are crisscrossed over the closed door. They

open the door and step under the tape and walk into

INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - DAY

The room is exactly an it was left that night. The un-made

bed, the chair knocked over... The LAWYERS look around for a

moment. The room is sparse.

Kaffee goes to the closet and opens it: A row of uniforms

hanging neatly. He thumbs through then for a second, but

there's nothing there.

He opens the footlocker: Socks, underwear... all folded to

marine corp precision... A shaving kit, a couple of

photographs, a pad of writing paper and some envelopes...

Kaffee closes the footlocker.

The LAWYERS take a moment.

SAM turns to KAFFEE.

SAM and KENDRICK walk out the door. JO stops KAFFEE.

INT. THE OFFICERS CLUB - DAY

JESSEP, MARKINSON, KENDRICK and the LAWYERS are seated at a

table in the corner.

Stewards clear the lunch dishes and pour coffee. Jessep is

finishing a story.

JESSEP laughs. KENDRICK joins him. SAM and KAFFEE force a

laugh.

MARKINSON forces a smile. JO remains silent.

JESSEP's not quite sure what to say to this Navy Lawyer

Lieutenant-Smartass guy who just gave him permission to speak

freely on his own base.

Here's something else KAFFEE didn't know. Neither did Jo.

SAM jots something down on a small notepad.

MARKINSON doesn't flinch.

KAFFEE nods.

There's silence for a moment.

KAFFEE takes a sip of his coffee. Then drains the cup and

puts it down.

JO's not upset. JO's not mad. But she's gonna ask her question

'til she gets an answer.

A moment of tense silence before --

The LAWYERS start to leave.

KAFFEE stops. Turns around. Sam and JO stop and turn.

KAFFEE and JESSEP are frozen. Everyone'staring at Kaffee;

The OFFICERS at their tables... KENDRICK... SAM...

MARKINSON... JO... KAFFEE makes his decision.

JESSEP smiles.

HOLD for a moment. JO's very disappointed.

JESSEP stands there and watches the LAWYERS as they turn and

leave the Officer's Club.

MARKINSON looks at the ground.

MARKINSON looks up as we

EXT. ANDREWS AIRFORCE BASE - DUSK

As a plane touches down on the runway. It's dusk in Washington

and

EXT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - DAY

A little one-bedroom. Just the essential furniture, barely

even that.

KAFFEE's sitting and watching a baseball came on t.v. He's

holding a copy of The Baseball Encyclopedia, normally his

favorite reading material, but right now he's having trouble

keeping his mind in it. He's holding a baseball bat and

fiddling with it.

The remnants of a pizza and Yoo-Hoo dinner sit next to him.

His white uniform in a pile in the corner. There's a BUZZ at

the door. KAFFEE's not expecting anyone. He goes to the door.

KAFFEE opens the door and JO walks in.

JO hands KAFFEE the file she's been holding.

KAFFEE's stunned. He opens the file and begins to read.

KAFFEE looks up. Still too stunned to say anything. Then

finally...

KAFFEE hands her back the file.

INT. A HOLDING ROOM IN THE BRIG - NIGHT

DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention as KAFFEE and JO are led

in.

KAFFEE starts in immediately.

There's some understandable tension in the room, broken by --

INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

ROSS is playing a game of full-court basketball with some

other OFFICERS.

A door at the far end of the court opens and KAFFEE and JO

walk in. They head down the sideline toward Ross.

KAFFEE shouts --

But ROSS is into the game...

ROSS stops cold and looks over at Kaffee. The game flies by

him. He motions to the locker room door in the corner of the

gym and the three of them make their way to privacy.

They're in the

LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

and KAFFEE slams the door shut behind them.

Some of the wind has been taken Out of Kaffee's sails.

This is now clear: Ross is as good as Kaffee.

ROSS turns and heads back to the gym as we

INT. A HOLDING ROOM - NIGHT

Kaffee and JO are sitting at a table. Dawson and Downey are

at parade rest. Kaffee lights a cigarette.

DAWSON and DOWNEY say nothing.

KAFFEE can't believe this. He looks over at JO.

DAWSON just stares at him.

HOLD ON the four of them for a moment, then

Jo waits Just a moment before she calls out --

The M.P. has shown up and unlocked the cell door.

JO, DOWNEY, and the M.P. are gone. KAFFEE paces a moment

before he says --

KAFFEE paces another moment, then sits on the cot. He's trying

to choose his tack carefully.

KAFFEE gets up.

KAFFEE stares at DAWSON.

KAFFEE calls out --

KAFFEE and DAWSON are staring each other down. The M.P. shows

up and unlocks the cell door. KAFFEE steps out to leave.

DAWSON holds on KAFFEE. Then DAWSON, a man who would rather

die than breach military protocol, takes his hands and puts

them in his pockets.

The cell door closes and we

INT. THE OFFICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

One light is on at the end of the hall.

SAM has joined KAFFEE and JO. The mood is somber.

There's a pause in the room.

JO looks at him, shakes her head, and turns to walk away.

She turns back.

Jo walks off leaving KAFFEE alone. We HOLD on KAFFEE. He's

not having a good night.

INT. A GEORGETOWN BAR - NIGHT

KAFFEE sits at the bar. The place is crowded with YUPPIES

and STUDENTS. KAFFEE's been drinking there a while now. Next

to him is a YUPPIE LAWYER, regaling his FRIENDS with the

story of his latest brilliant maneuver in the world of high

stakes corporate law.

We HOLD on a KAFFEE a moment longer, then

EXT. A GEORGETOWN STREET - NIGHT

KAFFEE sits on a bench in the night. He takes a sip from a

bottle he's holding in a brown paper bag.

EXT. THE PARADE GROUNDS - DAY

A bright, sunny morning. The BAND is performing for a group

of day campers.

INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

DAWSON and DOWNEY are at the defense table, ROSS is his place.

KAFFEE walks in and joins JO and SAM at their table. Papers

are being passed back and forth between ROSS and the SERGEANT

AT AMS. Quiet activity.

The door in the back of the courtroom opens and RANDOLPH, a

marine colonel, enters and takes his place at the bench. We

can HEAR the band in the background.

Everyone present in the courtroom stands.

KAFFEE stands.

JO, SAM, ROSS, RANDOLPH... it's hard to say who's the most

surprised. It takes everything Jo's got to suppress a smile.

The silence is broken by ROSS, who takes the two files, drops

them into his briefcase, closes the lid, and snaps it shut.

RANDOLPH looks at KAFFEE and ROSS, then turns to the SERGEANT

AT ARMS.

He raps the gavel.

RANDOLPH walks out. ROSS walks up the aisle without a word

to anyone. The M.P.'s come to escort DAWSON and DOWNEY back

to their cell.

KAFFEE and JO and SAM are the only ones remaining. SAM is

looking at KAFFEE with question marks in his eyes.

KAFFEE picks up his briefcase and begins heading toward the

door.

Jo's still stunned.

KAFFEE's at the door, stops, turns around, and takes it all

in for a moment.

He walks out the door, and we

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Among the stuff, is a blackboard that's been hung on the

wall. Written across the top are three headings:

Sam is on the floor, sorting papers into piles. KAFFEE comes

in from the kitchen with a fresh bottle of Yoo-Hoo and joins

Sam on the floor.

SAM doesn't laugh.

Sam looks away. He doesn't buy it.

Jo lets herself in. She's carrying a huge stack of papers

under one arm, and a large brown paper bag under the other.

But we stay with KAFFEE and Sam a moment longer.

KAFFEE's still looking at SAM. SAM nods his head.

INT. KAFFEE'S APT. - LATER - NIGHT

The remnants of the Chinese food is spread around. SAM and

JO are sitting and taking notes from KAFFEE. As he speaks,

he'll pace slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. He refers

to the blackboard.

KAFFEE looks at the cartons and the mind-numbing amount of

paper.

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT -

SERIES OF SCENES

The scenes cover the three weeks of preparation leading up

to the trial, and are interspersed with shots of Kaffee's

apartment getting messier, KAFFEE, JO and SAM flipping through

documents and reference books, writing on the blackboard,

dozzing off...

We start with

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jo's on the phone, KAFFEE and SAM are going over testimony,

with SAM sitting in a mock witness chair. During this, KAFFEE

will go to the door, pay the PIZZA Man for the pizza, and

return without missing a single beat.

INT. A LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT

MOS -- JO pulls two thick volumes off a shelf and takes them

to the table where SAM and KAFFEE are working. She plops the

books down where they join a pile of about two-dozen just

like them and we

INT. A COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The LAWYERS have their books and papers spread out in front

of them.

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

MOS -- KAFFEE's paying the pizza boy again. He goes into the

living room where SAM is on the "stand". It's getting hard

to see the floor from all the papers, cartons, books, pizza

boxes, etc., and

INT. THE BRIG - DAY

A HOLDING ROOM where DAWSON and DOWNEY are being put through

their paces.

INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT

MOS -- The clock reads 3:37, and KAFFEE, in sweatpants and a

bathrobe, is pacing around slowly with his baseball bat and

SAM and JO art listening to a lecture for the 14th time.

SAM begins to gather up his things. He stands in front of

KAFFEE.

Sam steps out the door. JO looks at the ground, then up at

KAFFEE.

Jo walks out the door and KAFFEE closes it and locks it behind

her.

Then he says, very softly...

INT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

A few M.P.Is are standing by the entrance. KAFFEE comes around

the corner and heads toward the courtroom. We're immediately

stricken by something:

In his dress blue uniform he could easily be mistaken for a

real live naval officer. He opens the courtroom doors and

walks into

INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

A few more M.P.'s are standing around. THE JURORS, nine

enlisted navy and marine men and women, are in their place,

Ross is at his table looking through some papers, and DAWSON

and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, are seated at the defense table.

The trial in a few moments from being underway and a few

people are milling about. KAFFEE walks down the aisle but is

stopped by a voice behind him.

KAFFEE turns around to see a MAN and WOMAN who are clearly

Dawson's parents.

KAFFEE continues on and stops next to JO, who's talking with

a WOMAN in her mid-30's.

Not quite the words of inspiration KAFFEE was hoping to hear

before he does the hardest thing he's ever had to do.

He walks over to ROSS.

RANDOLPH enters.

KAFFEE walks back to his table as

RANDOLPH raps the gavel.

RANDOLPH without objection, the sworn confessions of the two

defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the

court record.

ROSS walks to the jury box.

ROSS walks back to his seat.

Before KAFFEE's even stood up, these words are coming out of

his mouth.

KAFFEE walks back to the table and takes his seat.

While McCGUIRE, a civilian in his late 30's, is being sworn

in, KAFFEE has sat back down.

He leans over to DAWSON and whispers.

DAWSON doesn't change his expression.

ROSS goes back to his table. KAFFEE stands.

KAFFEE sits.

HAMMAKER, a young marine corporal, is being sworn in.

HAMMAKER gets off the stand, and KAFFEE watches while walks

past DAWSON and DOWNEY. A barely perceptible exchange occurs

between the eyes of DAWSON and HAMMAKER.

KAFFEE makes a decision.

SHOT OF WASHINGTON AT NIGHT

THE PARADE GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING, two SAILORS are raising

the flag.

INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

COMMANDER STONE, a Navy doctor in his mid-40's, is on the

stand.

KAFFEE sits.

KAFFEE gets up.

STONE says nothing for a moment.

KAFFEE has gone back to his table where JO has handed him

some documents. He shows then to STONE.

ROSS stands immediately.

Jo stands.

KAFFEE and SAM are dying, but they're trying to keep their

poker-faces. RANDOLPH'S gonna try to be polite about this,

but he thought he made himself clear.

RANDOLPH raps his gavel.

And the courtroom begins clearing out. KAFFEE, JO and SAM

are packing up their various papers.

There's an uncomfortable silence.

Sam starts to leave. JO turns and says

Sam stops and turns around.

A long silence. KAFFEE makes a decision.

KAFFEE picks up his stuff and walks out.

SAM and JO stand there uncomfortably for a moment. JO begins

packing up her things.

Despite their differences, SAM likes this woman.

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A baseball game is on.

KAFFEE's pacing slowly around, carrying his baseball bat.

He's looking at the blackboard as he walks around the room.

He's studying it. Studying it hard. There's a knock on the

door. KAFFEE answers it. JO is standing in the doorway.

INT. A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

On the Virginia side of the Potomac. KAFFEE and JO are sitting

at a table, finishing up dinner.

We HOLD on then for a moment, and in VOICE OVER hear

CORPORAL HOWARD, the young marine who drove the lawyers around

Cuba, is on the stand.

ROSS takes three books out of his briefcase and puts them on

the table. He brings one to HOWARD.

ROSS has produced another book.

ROSS sits. KAFFEE walks over to ROSS's table and picks up

one of the books. He brings it to HOWARD.

KAFFEE chucks the book back on ROSS's desk.

KAFFEE gives HOWARD a subtle "You Did Good, Kid" look, and

we

INT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DUSK

It's the end of the day's session. KAFFEE walks down the

hall with SAM and JO.

EXT. SIDEWALK STAND - NIGHT

KAFFEE'S CAR

as it drives along a street in the D.C. business district.

it's evening now and the windshield wipers are fighting

against a rain KAFFEE pulls over at his usual newsstand. He

hops out, leaving the lights flashing and the door open, and

runs to the stand.

He gets back in his car, tosses the newspaper on the passenger

seat, and turns on the ignition. And as soon as he does

-- a hand is slapped over his mouth --

-- and KAFFEE jumps out of his skin.

Because sitting in the back seat, in civilian clothes, is

MARKINSON.

KAFFEE begins driving down the street.

And with this, KAFFEE screeches the car over to the side of

the road. He grabs the parking brake and pulls it up. He

turns to Markinson.

KAFFEE's wheels are spinning. He's pumped.

KAFFEE shakes his head and laughs.

KAFFEE puts the car in gear and we

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Where KAFFEE has just finished telling his story to an amazed

SAM and JO.

There's silence.

Then JO has a total adrenaline rush.

JO picks up the phone.

KAFFEE is impressed. He turns to SAM --

Jo continues giving information to the person on the phone,

while Kaffee keeps talking to the both of them. Sam is writing

down notes as fast as he can.

JO hangs up the phone.

INT. A WASHINGTON SALOON - NIGHT

A WAITRESS sets two drinks down in front of KAFFEE and ROSS,

who are sitting across from each other in a booth in the

back.

ROSS only takes a moment digest this.

ROSS takes another sip of his drink, then lays it on the

line for Kaffee..

ROSS stands up and heaves a few dollars on the table.

INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

People are filing in. KENDRICK is standing at the entrance

to the courtroom. KAFFEE glides past him...

KENDRICK watches this impudent thing walk into the courtroom

as we

INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

KENDRICK's on the stand. What drives Kaffee's entire

examination of Kendrick is this: Kaffee's got him. He's gonna

win. At least this round. All he has to do is not let his

emotions take control of his professional skill.

SAM will have files and documents ready to hand Kaffee as he

needs them.

KAFFEE's handed some more files.

KAFFEE looks over at DAWSON. They share a brief moment before

KAFFEE turns back to KENDRICK.

ROSS doesn't even wait before he says --

But KENDRICK isn't listening -- he's glaring at Kaffee.

FWAP! - a nerf ball slams into a hoop.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

JO and KAFFEE. KAFFEE's pumped and shooting baskets as Sam

walks in with some bound papers under his arm.

KAFFEE lets the ball drop out of his hands.

EXT. A MOTEL - NIGHT

A SEDAN, with U.S. MARSHALL stenciled on the door, sits in

front of one of the rooms, and the two FEDERAL AGENTS inside

the car are reading the newspaper as KAFFEE'S CAR pulls next

to them and KAFFEE jumps out.

AGENT #1 sticks his head out the window and calls to KAFFEE --

KAFFEE pays no attention and bangs on MARKINSON's door. The

door opens and KAFFEE walks into

INT. MOTEL ROOM

HE tosses the log book on the table.

KAFFEE is silent. And now it begins to sink in.

Setback. Big setback.

MARKINSON says nothing. But his face says that KAFFEE was

born yesterday.

KAFFEE stares at him.

Then shakes his head, sighs, and picks the log book up off

the table, and heads for the door.

KAFFEE leaves.

HOLD on MARKINSON.

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT

KAFFEE'S APARTMENT later that night and SAM and J0 have just

heard the report him.

INT. THE HOLDING ROOM - DAY

Jo is working with DOWNEY. He sits on a mock witness stand.

JO smiles.

DOWNEY smiles.

INT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

Jo is going over last-minute details with KAFFEE.

They turn and head into the courtroom as we HEAR MARKINSON

in VOICE OVER...

INT. MARKINSON'S ROOM - DAY

MARKINSON is writing a letter and we HEAR it in V.O.

And while we continue to HEAR Markinson's voice writing the

letter, we begin a SERIES OF SHOTS: MARKINSON is getting

into his class A dress uniform, complete with medals, side

arm, and military dress sabre.

MARKINSON is finished dressing. He stands in the middle of

the motel room.

MARKINSON takes a pistol out of his holster and cocks the

trigger.

MARKINSON puts the pistol in his mouth --

We HEAR the BLAST of the gunshot as we

EXT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

Kaffee is at the end of his examination of Downey.

At the defense table, KAFFEE, poker-faced, scribbles something

down on a piece of paper and slides it to JO. JO looks at

it:

"Where's he going with this?" JO scribbles "?" And hands it

back to KAFFEE.

KAFFEE knows what's coming. There's nothing he can do about

it. And he can't lose his cool in front of the jury.

JO. Helpless. Panicked.

DOWNEY's confused. These are questions he hasn't been asked

before.

KAFFEE's world is falling down around him, and there's nothing

he can do about it. And he knows it.

Jo leaps to her feet.

Everyone is frozen.

DOWNEY looks at DAWSON.

The room is still silent. DOWNEY does something we've never

seen him do before. He straightens himself up and says this

with the pride of a man who believes he's done the right

thing.

ROSS let's it hang. He looks over at KAFFEE. KAFFEE won't

meet his eyes.

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

JO and SAM are sitting in silence. It's dark outside.

SAM doesn't know. JO is beside herself, and trying to keep

it together.

SAM understands, but he doesn't say anything. The door opens

and KAFFEE walks in.

KAFFEE seems to be in an incredibly normal mood.

JO studies KAFFEE for a moment.

JO and SAM are frozen.

KAFFEE says this with no particular feeling one way or the

other.

Jo and SAM don't say anything.

And with one motion, he knocks everything from his desk. A

ton of papers, books, files, etc., falls to the floor.

There's dead silence. Maybe just the sound of KAFFEE breathing

after this exhausting outburst.

Finally...

Jo picks up her purse and coat and walks out. The door slams

behind her.

KAFFEE walks into the kitchen without a word.

SAM gets down on the floor and begins picking up all the

stuff that Kaffee knocked off the desk.

KAFFEE comes back in with a bottle of Jack Daniels.

But Sam continues.

SAM stops and sits in a chair. KAFFEE sits on the couch.

SAM takes a swig from the bottle.

We HOLD on the two of them for a moment, then

EXT. A SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

JO is walking through the night at a brisk pace. She's doing

her best not to fall apart.

TWO HEADLIGHTS appear coming down the street, and KAFFEE's

CAR, with SAM driving and KAFFEE riding shotgun, slows down

alongside JO. KAFFEE rolls down his window.

JO ignores them and keeps walking. The car crawls along with

her.

JO starts walking faster.

KAFFEE hops out and calls --

JO keeps walking.

But JO'S still walking.

She stops. She turns around.

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - LATER - AFTERNOON

A nerf ball bounces off the wall.

KAFFEE, JO and SAM are sprawled out in the living room. For

hours now they've been trying to come up with an idea.

KAFFEE's mind seems to be on his basketball game.

He sees that SAM and JO were already sitting down.

SAM and JO are silent for a moment.

KAFFEE heads to the closet.

And we go to KAFFEE AT THE CLOSET.

OFFSCREEN WE HEAR

During this, KAFFEE's opened the closet door. He reaches in

to grab his bat when all of a sudden he notices something:

His clothes.

His uniforms and his civilian clothes. Hanging neatly along

the bar. He stares at this a moment, then suddenly heads

back through the living room towards the front door.

KAFFEE storms out.

INT. THE COMPUTER ROOM - DUSK

A small room at the end of a corridor at the office. KAFFEE

stands over a printer and watches it spit out something he's

been waiting for. He tears the printout off and we

INT. KAFFEE'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

KAFFEE is looking over the computer printout. From what we

can tell, it resembles a large, military coded phone bill.

KAFFEE picks up the phone and dials.

INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT

SAM hangs up the phone slowly.

INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

The day's session is going to begin in a few minutes. KAFFEE

comes around the corner and runs into Jo.

INT. AN ANTE-ROOM OFF THE CORRIDOR - DAY

JO closes the door behind them.

KAFFEE looks at her.

KAFFEE takes that in. He picks up his briefcase and grabs

his jacket.

Then he turns to JO.

And in VOICE OVER we HEAR the SERGEANT AT ARMS.

INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

Everyone stands at attention as RANDOLPH enters. SAM is

missing.

JESSEP is escorted in through a side door. He's wearing his

dress uniforms, adorned with the appropriate medals.

JESSEP sits.

And from the back of the room, SAM enters. He's escorting

two young AIRMEN in Airforce dress uniforms. SAM shows the

AIRMEN to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the

defense table.

Over this we HEAR --

SAM scribbles something on a piece of paper, KAFFEE walks

over, looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names:

Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Perez, then turns back to RANDOLPH.

KAFFEE holds up a document from his table.

KAFFEE nods and decides to move on.

JESSEP steals a quick glance at the two AIRMEN sitting out

in the courtroom.

KAFFEE gets a document from his table.

That landed. On the JURY, RANDOLPH, ROSS...

JO hands KAFFEE the computer printout.

Handing Jessep the printout --

Jo's handed KAFFEE another printout and a stack of letters.

RANDOLPH ponders this a moment.

Jessep's smiling...

...and now he can't help but let out a short laugh.

The courtroom is silenced. Jessep's slammed the door.

KAFFEE looks around the room, sees that the world is waiting

for him to do something...

KAFFEE says nothing. He glances over to AIRMEN O'MALLEY and

PEREZ.

KAFFEE doesn't respond. JESSEP gets up to leave.

And JESSEP starts to leave, but he's stopped by --

JESSEP turns around.

Jessep goes back to the stand.

KAFFEE gets the two log books from his table as well as the

piece of paper that SAM scribbled on.

If you looked closely at JESSEP, you could see a drop of

sweat.

KAFFEE speaks with the quiet confidence that comes from

knowing you're about to drop your opponents

And JESSEP has no answer.

Nothing.

He sits there, and for the first time, seems to be lost.

Everyone's sweating now. Everyone but KAFFEE.

Jessep is looking at O'MALLEY and PEREZ.

JESSEP says nothing.

KAFFEE will plow through the objections of ROSS and the

admonishments of RANDOLPH.

And nobody moves.

Silence. From everyone. RANDOLPH, ROSS, the M.P.'s, they're

all frozen. JO and SAM are likewise. JESSEP seems strangely,

quietly relieved. KAFFEE simply takes control of the room

now.

Silence.

RANDOLPH looks to ROSS.

ROSS is frozen. He doesn't know what to do.

ROSS looks at KAFFEE, then JESSEP, then nods his head "yes"

to RANDOLPH.

The SERGEANT AT ARMS begins leading the JURORS out of the

room.

No one will say anything until the jurors are out of the

room.

The M.P.'s are tentative. They've never heard a marine colonel

referred to as "the prisoner" before. They sure as hell have

never been asked to guard one.

ROSS continues reading JESSEP his rights, over --

And JESSEP lunges at KAFFEE, and KAFFEE would be dead but

for the three M.P.'s who've leapt in to restrain JESSEP.

SAM and JO have come to their feet and stand behind KAFFEE.

ROSS is done reading JESSEP his rights.

The courtroom is silent from Jessep's outburst. Jessep shakes

his head.

KAFFEE stays on JESSEP a moment longer, then remembers --

The M.P.'s start leading JESSEP out, and KAFFEE notices

DAWSON. And DOWNEY. And ROSS. who are watching a man in a

marine colonels uniform be led away in handcuffs... KAFFEE

takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes some sweat

from his hands. He takes a deep breath as we

INT. THE COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

There's low murmur in the room as the JURORS are being led

back into their box.

Everyone's in place.

RANDOLPH enters.

All rise. And sit when RANDOLPH sits.

The SERGEANT AT ARMS takes all the slips of paper from the

FOREMAN and brings them to RANDOLPH.

KAFFEE stands, and nods to DAWSON and DOWNEY that they should

do the same. SAM and JO stand as well.

It's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but

they do.

RANDOLPH looks up. Then reads from the last slip of paper.

A little of the energy drains out of the room. RANDOLPH

continues reading.

RANDOLPH clears his throat.

RANDOLPH raps his gavel.

All rise.

RANDOLPH's gone.

The M.P.'s move to DAWSON and DOWNEY to unlock their

handcuffs. KAFFEE is packing up his things, just another day

at the office.

SAM slaps his hands down on the table --

SAM lets it hang. DAWSON is staring at SAM. His stare moves

slowly to the floor.

DAWSON looks up at HIS PARENTS. The moment hangs there...

before

KAFFEE nods.

DAWSON looks to KAFFEE. There's gotta be more. This can't be

it.

But KAFFEE has nothing to say.

DAWSON and DOWNEY walk to the SERGEANT AT ARMS and begin to

follow him up the aisle and out of the courtroom. But before

they get to the door, KAFFEE turns around and calls

They stop and turn around.

DAWSON stares at KAFFEE for a long moment.

DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention.

DAWSON snaps a salute and holds it.

KAFFEE stares back. Then stands up straight and returns their

salute.

With one last glance back at KAFFEE, DAWSON turns and walks

out the door, followed by DOWNEY.

ROSS walks over to the defense table.

ROSS smiles.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE - DUSK

KAFFEE, JO and SAM are walking down the steps. The BAND is

practicing on the parade grounds.

And SAM heads off toward his car.

JO holds out her hand. KAFFEE shakes it. JO kisses him.

Jo splits off toward her building and KAFFEE keeps walking

toward the bleachers as we PULL BACK TO INCLUDE the almost

empty parade grounds and PULL BACK as to show the Washington

Navy Yard and PULL BACK and back and back and
