based on the life of Sam Childers

FINAL SHOOTING DRAFT

This is true...

EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - (2003)

The night is stillborn.

Without sound or movement and nothing is in definition. All we see

are degrees of blackness in this unlit world. The vague impressions

of an African village in the void... a ragged line of tukuls (straw

huts)... a bicycle propped against a mud wall... a soccer ball in

the dirt...

INT. TUKUL - NIGHT

And we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats. A mother, father

and their two boys. The younger boy we'll come to know as "WILLIAM"

(9). His older brother "CHRISTOPHER" (12) curled next to him.

EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

And slowly the blackness begins to shift... an otherworldly light

seeping in from someplace far off... shadows contorting in a ghostly

orange flicker... images emerging... the silhouettes of men coming

into this village carrying flaming torches.

INT. TUKUL - NIGHT

The family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming

from outside, and suddenly --

SCREAMING! -- GUNSHOTS!

The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their

tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army

(LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- "Get up!

Get up!" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands --

"Don't shoot!" --

KAK! KAK! KAK!

And he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and

boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks

free -- scrambles deeper into the room --

THE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of

storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing

into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE

SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING

WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out

of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED

PHOTOGRAPH which has fallen on the ground...

EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

CHAOS! -- PANDEMONIUM! -- the black sky ablaze in apocalyptic fire --

families yanked out of their burning tukuls by LRA rebels -- the

adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death -- the

women and children forced into the center of the village -- huddled

together and weeping --

-- and now we see WILLIAM hauled out -- his captor shouting to

another soldier -- pointing to WILLIAM'S mother and she's pulled

from the group and forced onto her knees...

... and WILLIAM is brought in front of her -- his captor saying

something in Arabic as he hands him a club -- "Kill her!" -- WILLIAM

shaking his head `no' -- tossing the club in the dirt and --

CRACKKK! -- WILLIAM is hit with the butt of a rifle -- goes down --

blood streaming down his face as he's pulled back up to his feet --

crying -- shaking with fear...

... and then he sees his mother staring up at him... and despite the

hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and

son... something calm and reassuring in the way she's looking at him

now... her eyes full of love... and pity... for her child in this

terrible moment... and before we see how this ends we --

FOR A LONG BEAT -- AND THEN WE BLEED UP WHITE LETTERS ON THE BLACK

SCREEN THAT READ --

... AND THEN THE ECHOED VOICES OF MEN YELLING TO ONE ANOTHER...

BOOMING MUSIC... TAUNTS... WHISTLES... AN ANNOUNCEMENT, INAUDIBLE,

OVER A LOUDSPEAKER... TAKING US TO...

INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - RURAL PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - (AUGUST/1998)

And we see SAM CHILDERS coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in

jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old,

with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good-

looking... even handsome if the light is right... but his face is

tricky... always changing... behind the quick smile, around his dark

eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence.

INT. PRISON RECEIVING AND RELEASING - DAY

We see a CLERK handing Sam a prison issue tub full of his personal

affects. He takes out his clothes, digs out a leather wallet, a

watch, some silver rings and a lighter.

He looks up to the Clerk and flashes a malicious smile --

EXT. PRISON - DAY

A beat-up CHEVY VEGA parked at the curb. Sam's wife, LYNN, 30's, in

a thrift store dress, leaning against the car, waiting.

Sam (dressed in civilian clothes now) pushes out a door and she sees

him, straightens her hair, an uneasy smile.

EXT SIDE OF ROAD/INT. LYNN'S CAR - DAY

The Vega pulled of the side of the road and Sam fucking Lynn in the

back. There's nothing tender about what we're watching here. Sam

finishes and Lynn slumps into the seat, pulls down her dress.

EXT. MOBILE HOME PARK - DAY

The Vega pulls up to a beat-to-shit single-wide and Sam and Lynn get

out. We see a homemade sign hanging outside the trailer that reads,

"Welcome Home Daddy!"

And now Sam's daughter PAIGE (6) bursts out of the trailer and down

the steps... Followed by Sam's mother, DAISY, mid 60's, comes out of

the trailer.

And she jumps into his arms.

Lynn enters the trailer, Paige follows.

INT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY

Sam and Daisy enter.

There's a quiet anxiety to this homecoming. Everybody on edge,

careful.

Lynn hesitating, not sure how to answer... not sure what's going to

happen when she does... finally...

He walks toward the fridge.

He turns to her, studies her with cold eyes...

Sam's face changing, starting to turn bad. A look we'll come to

know.

Daisy scooping up Paige and exiting, screen door slamming behind

them and now Sam and Lynn are all alone.

Lynn reaches for him but he shoves her back violently...

Sam exits.

EXT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY

Sam straddles the bike and kicks it to life. He PEELS OUT, kicking

up gravel as he blasts past Paige and Daisy.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Sam riding down the road.

INT. CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT

A tough biker bar in Johnstown, PA. A jukebox in the corner playing

Lynard Skynard. Sam coming through the door, AD-LIBBED greetings

from some of the other bikers here. He makes his way to a back table

where a hulking biker in a leather vest named DONNIE is sitting with

two girls. Donnie looks up, sees Sam...

They embrace, old friends.

Donnie laughs, slaps him on the shoulder...

Sam smiles that wicked smile and we go --

INT. BACK HALLWAY - THE CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT

-- as a biker chick leads Sam down this hallway into --

INT. BATHROOM - THE CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT

Sam and the biker chick crammed into this dirty stall, Skynard

pounding through the walls. He rolls up his shirt sleeve as she

cooks a spoon of methamphetamine... juices a hypodermic... he finds

a vein and she spikes his arm... presses the plunger and his head

rolls back on his shoulders... speed slamming into his bloodstream

as we RAMP UP THE MUSIC.

INT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - MORNING - WEEKS LATER - (DECEMBER/1998)

Snow piled up on the windowsills and it's cold as shit outside. Sam

passed out on the couch and this guy looks like hell.

Thinner than the last time we saw him, skin sallow and drawn tight

over his face. He stirs awake, sees Paige playing by herself on the

floor next to him. She sees that he's awake, picks up her doll, and

quietly goes outside without saying a word.

INT. BATHROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - MORNING

Sam coming in, taking a piss, staring at himself in the mirror and

we see a junkie map of track marks running up and down his arms. And

then WE HEAR a Pentecostal communion hymn, "the Old Rugged Cross",

coming through... taking us to...

INT. CHURCH - JOHNSTOWN, PA. - DAY

A congregation packed into this church for Sunday service. We see

Lynn and Paige in the crowd, singing along with the congregation.

EXT. DOPE HOUSE STREET/INT. DONNIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Sam and Donnie in this car, parked in front of broken down clapboard

houses. Donnie pointing through the windshield...

EXT. PORCH - DOPE HOUSE - NIGHT

Bone chill cold. Sam and Donnie on this porch, scarves pulled around

their necks, hands shoved into their jackets trying to stay warm.

Donnie KNOCKING at the door...

Donnie KNOCKING again and the door cracks an inch... and we see a

black man with a SHAVED HEAD on the other side looking out...

Suddenly Sam pulls a short barrel shotgun from his jacket --

MOSSBERG 10 GAGE -- presses it to the door and --

BOOOM!

INT. DOPE HOUSE - SAME

DOOR SPLINTERING OPEN! -- concussion like a fucking pipe bomb --

wood splintering through the room like shrapnel -- Sam and Donnie

STORMING IN...

INSTANT PANDEMONIUM! -- JUNKIES hopping off the couch, scattering

like rats deeper into the house -- SHAVED HEAD darting out of the

room -- Sam leveling the MOSSBERG in his direction --

BOOOM! -- the room flashing like a fucking supernova.

INT. STAIRWAY- DOPE HOUSE - SAME

SHAVED HEAD scrambling up these stairs -- Sam coming up after him --

hunting him -- MOSSBERG BLASTING in his direction -- BOOOM! --

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DOPE HOUSE - SAME

SHAVED HEAD sprinting down this hallway -- Sam tracking him in the

b.g. -- bloodlust in his eyes -- leveling the MOSSBERG and --

BOOOM! -- BOOOM!

Shotgun slugs ripping through the house like cannon shot -- SHAVED

HEAD bolting through the smoke -- crashing through a door into --

INT. BEDROOM - DOPE HOUSE - SAME

-- SHAVED HEAD bombing in -- hitting the ground -- trying to get to

his feet but it's too late because --

-- SAM kicks open the door behind him -- SHAVED HEAD going onto his

back, trying to crab crawl away from him but there's nowhere to go --

Sam moving closer --

-- SHAVED HEAD working his way into a corner -- holding his hands in

front of his face -- terrified, shaking --

Donnie coming into the room --

Sam KICKS him toward the closet --

SHAVED HEAD crawling to a small safe in a closet, spins the combo,

opens it and pulls out six ounces of uncut cocaine.

SHAVED HEAD grabs a stack of hundreds, hands it to Sam and --

CRACKKK! -- he SLAMS the butt of the Mossberg into SHAVED HEAD'S

face and he hits the ground on his back -- Sam standing over him --

shoves the barrel of the shotgun into his mouth --

But Sam's not moving... just staring down at SHAVED HEAD... and

we're watching something here... a terrible intelligence taking

over... something bloodless and inhuman coming over Sam in this

moment... and he chambers a slug into the shotgun...

And this is it. He's going to blow this guys brains all over the

floor...

His finger curls around the trigger, eyes becoming lethal...

And he snaps back, looks around, sees Donnie standing there...

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/INT. DONNIE'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

MUSIC LOUD AS IT GOES! -- SCREAMING! -- Sam and Donnie pumped and

celebrating after the robbery. Sam in the passenger seat, already

cooking coke in a bent spoon...

Sam juices a needle and spikes Donnie's arm. Donnie feeling the

rush... pressing on the gas and howling like a wild man... both of

them wired out of their heads... BLASTING down this dark, country

road... and then they see...

Up the road, standing in this bitter cold with his thumb out.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Donnie's car pulls off the road and the Hitchhiker hustles up to it.

INT. DONNIE'S CAR - NIGHT

The Hitchhiker climbing into the backseat. He's late 40's, a

drifter, probably American Indian. Donnie starts driving.

Sam looking back --

Suddenly -- silver flashing -- A BLADE -- out of nowhere -- pressed

into Donnie's neck from the backseat -- the Drifter pulling him

tight against the seat rest, pressing it into his throat --

Sam reaches his leg over and STOMPS ON THE GAS PEDDLE -- the car

LURCHES forward -- accelerating --

But Sam's not letting up... pressing down on the peddle hard...

90... 100... 110 mph -- Donnie YELLING -- trying to keep the car on

the road -- MUSIC BLARING -- like some wild ride to hell and then --

SAM SUDDENLY JUMPS IN THE BACKSEAT -- wrestling with the drifter --

fighting wild -- elbowing him in the face and somehow the blade is

in his hand now -- and --

Stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick!

He stabs him six times in the gut. The drifter HOWLING in pain.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Donnie's car skidding off the shoulder of the road, back door

popping open and the Drifter's body dumped into the dirt. The car

PEELS OUT, accelerates, tail lights disappearing into the dark.

INT. BEDROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Lynn sound asleep in bed. And she slowly stirs awake, hears water

running from somewhere in the trailer.

INT. HALLWAY AND BATHROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Lynn moving down the hall... toward a sliver of light coming from

under the closed bathroom door... gently pushing it open to see --

Sam standing at the sink... covered in blood... frantically trying

to clean himself up... trying to wash the sin from his skin and

clothes but it's useless... and the sense we get is that we're

staring at a man at the edge of an abyss... set to swallow him

whole... terrified... shaking...

... and now he realizes Lynn is here and he turns to her... holding

up his stained hands... a terrible fear in his eyes when he says...

EXT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY

Days later and we see Lynn and Paige, dressed up, sitting in the

idling car, waiting.

INT. BEDROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY

And we find Sam in this bedroom all alone, wearing a thrift store

sportcoat, sitting on the edge of the bed. Frozen. Staring at his

stocking feet and three or four pairs of workboots scattered on the

floor.

Lynn steps into the doorway...

Sam turns to her, and he looks lost here. Like a little boy.

And she comes into the room, sits on the bed next to him, puts an

arm around his shoulder.

INT. BAPTISM CHURCH - JOHNSTOWN, PA. - DAY

Packed with Sunday families listening to Pastor Krause at the

pulpit. Behind him we see a BAPTISMAL TANK filled with water. And

now we see Sam, Lynn, Paige, and Daisy sitting near the back. Sam

looks uncomfortable, on edge.

A few hands shoot up --

Three or four people moving to their feet, making their way up to

the altar. Lynn turns to Sam, their eyes meet. He looks hesitant,

unsure. She gives him a reserved little smile, nods her head

slightly as if saying "you can do this"...

And in her look he finds strength, gets up, slowly makes his way

to...

And now we see Sam on his knees in the baptismal tank. The water

almost up to his waist. Pastor Krause kneeling behind him.

... and he leans Sam back, cradling his head as he submerges him in

the water completely... and when Sam comes back up the church breaks

into ROWDY HALLELUJAHS!... and we see Lynn... tears in her eyes...

clapping in the back row... and an organist and singer begin to sing

"Amazing Grace" taking us to...

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY - (JUNE/1999)

Months later and the snow has thawed... it's summer... and we see

Sam with other CONSTRUCTION WORKERS finishing their day, packing up

their tools, cleaning up. We notice that his gaunt cheeks have

filled out and he looks healthier.

And now a CONTRACTOR comes up to Sam, hands him a check.

EXT. STEPS - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Sam alone on these steps, lost in thought. Screen door opens and

Lynn comes out, sits next to him.

BEAT.

Sam shakes his head, and they're quiet... both of them sitting here

on these steps... the burden of this life catching up to them in

this moment.

INT. EMPLOYMENT OFFICE - DAY

A WOMAN stares down at her desk with a frown, shaking her head. Sam

sitting in a small chair in front of her.

EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY

And we see Sam standing next to his Harley, talking to a MECHANIC.

INT. PAIGE'S ROOM - CHILDER'S MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Sam on the edge of Paige's bed reading her a CHILDREN'S BOOK.

Off her look...

Paige curls into him closer, and we're watching him here... in this

moment... holding his daughter... not so sure they're gonna be ok.

EXT. THE CROSSROADS BAR PARKING LOT/INT. LYNN'S CAR - DAY

CLOSE ON Sam, behind the wheel of the car, parked, staring out the

front windshield. REVERSE to see he's in the parking lot of the bar,

just watching the entrance.

INT. THE CROSSROADS BAR - DAY

Empty except for a handful of regulars. Sam coming through the door,

taking in the place, the fucking grime and despair. Moving to Donnie

who is sitting in his same spot...

Sam sits.

Donnie sizes him up, "how much is a little bit?", turns to the

BARTENDER...

Sam shakes his head.

WAITRESS slides a shot and beer in front of Donnie...

Donnie smiling, inviting him back into this world. And we're

watching Sam, threshold moment here, considering.

INT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

It's late and we see Lynn sitting at the kitchen table alone. Sam

has not come home and she is clearly worried. And then we hear a car

pulling up outside, door opening and closing, and Sam coming into

the trailer.

Lynn staring at him, trying to read this man's face but he's not

looking at her. Avoiding her gaze. Did he use? Is he high? And then

she sees a PINPRICK OF DRIED BLOOD on his shirtsleeve. Her face

contorting almost imperceptibly. Her worst fear realized. Relapse.

And she moves to him without saying a word... lifts up his arm and

unbuttons the cuff of his shirt... slowly pushing up his shirtsleeve

to discover a NEEDLE PRICK in his arm...

... and then he pulls out a $20 bill and hands it to her.

Lynn searching his eyes and she knows he's telling the truth.

And she pulls him close, hugging him tight, grateful.

And we hold on Sam, his troubled eyes. Completely out of options.

And we see that for this man the inability to provide for his family

is crushing.

EXT. MOBILE HOME PARK - NIGHT

HEAVY WINDS! -- FLASHES OF LIGHTENING! -- a storm starting to batter

the trailer park.

INT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Lynn in front of the TV, scared, watching an EMERGENCY WEATHER

WARNING... winds buffeting the trailer... Sam coming into the room

from the back...

EXT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Sam opening the door, coming down the steps, looking up to the sky

and it is fucking black, swirling, ominous.

INT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Sam coming back into the trailer fast --

Lynn following him --

INT. HALLWAY - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

-- down the hallway -- WIND PICKING UP -- starting to rock the

trailer back and forth.

-- Lynn darting into a bedroom, scooping Paige out of her bed.

INT. BACK BEDROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Sam coming in, moving to a metal gun locker in the corner of the

room, pulling out a SHOTGUN.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

THE WIND -- SLAMMING the trailer now -- Lynn and Paige -- terrified -

- watching as Sam moves to the center of the room, points the barrel

of the shotgun toward the floor and --

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

Blows four gaping holes in the floorboards, then starts to kick

through the wood with his boot --

He kicks a hole in the planks, turns to Lynn and Paige --

Paige crawling through the opening... into a shallow trench

underneath the trailer... Lynn squeezing in behind her... Sam

staying outside... no room for him... the trailer starting to buck

VIOLENTLY in the tempest... thin walls contorting around him...

... and Paige starts to cry -- terrified -- Sam laying down on the

floor next to the opening, close enough so she can hear his voice...

And he starts to play a child's word association game with her...

something she knows... something they've played before...

And we hear her tiny little voice say...

And so this little game goes between father and daughter... Paige

listening to his voice... in the midst of this terrible storm...

somehow becoming less terrified.

EXT. MOBILE HOME PARK - DAY

A brilliantly clear day and we see neighbors picking up after the

storm. Sam on a ladder leaning against the trailer, nailing down a

strip of bent aluminum as a pickup truck pulls up. Window rolls down

and we see it's the CONTRACTOR from before.

Sam climbs down, moves to the truck, shakes his hand.

Sam, seizing an opportunity here.

EXT. MOBILE HOME PARK - DAY

A SHOT of Lynn carefully applying a vinyl application on the side of

a new (but used) truck that reads, "Childers Construction Company"

EXT. CHILDER'S HOUSE - DAY - (JULY/2000)

C.U. ON lynn's closed eyes -- smiling --

Months later and we're with Lynn and Paige, their eyes shut, as Sam

leads them both by the hand...

Sam finally stops them.

They do and both of their eyes go wide with surprise.

REVERSE to see a modest two bedroom house at the end of this

driveway. Their new home.

Paige sprints for the house as Lynn hugs Sam, softly starts to cry

into his shoulder.

INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT

The first night in their new home and we see a few unpacked moving

boxes here.

INT. PAIGE'S ROOM - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Paige sound asleep on a small bed upstairs.

INT. KITCHEN - CHILDERS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Lynn in the kitchen organizing the cabinets. And Sam enters carrying

a box, sets it on the counter.

Lynn looking up, seeing how dirty Sam is from the move...

Lynn tossing him a kitchen towel. Sam, smiling mischievously...

Sam winking at her and playfully snapping a kitchen towel at her

butt... Lynn giggling and scooting away...

And he snaps her butt again but she grabs the towel and snaps him

back...

She snaps him again and he feels the sting...

She snaps him again but he grabs her and they fall into each other

against the counter... laughing... and he kisses her... playful at

first and then it becomes more passionate... and just as it starts

to lead somewhere we go...

INT. CHURCH - DAY - (AUGUST/2002)

Two years later and we're watching a congregation finish a Sunday

hymn. Sam, Lynn, Daisy, and Paige (10) in the crowd listening to

Pastor Krause.

Polite applause as a tall, white South African man named PAUL

RELLING steps up to the pulpit, and in a deep Afrikaner accent he

And we see Sam in this sea of faces, listening.

INT. FOYER - CHURCH - DAY

Parishioners slowly filing out of the church after service. Lynn,

Paige, and a few other women chatting by the entrance.

And now Lynn looks over her shoulder and sees Sam talking with Paul

Relling off to the side, just the two of them in a corner, deep in

discussion.

INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT

The first thing we notice is the relative "opulence" of this

place... deep shag, new color TV, matching sectional sofa... the

rural idea of making it. Sam, Lynn, Daisy and Paige at the dinner

table eating. Sam in his own world, oblivious to the MINOR

CONVERSATION until --

Paige heads to the kitchen.

Paige comes back in carrying the beans.

EXT. MISSION CONSTRUCTION SITE - OUTSIDE KAMPALA - DAY

Two weeks later and we're in the rural countryside outside Kampala,

Uganda. Sam on the roof of a bombed out school building with other

white VOLUNTEERS, working.

Sam looks below to see a dozen black men dressed in the ragged

fatigues of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Each is

carrying an AK 47 and standing guard at various points around this

compound. The lead soldier is a man named DENG. ANGLE three others

we'll come to know as "NINETEEN", "MARCO" and "A.J."

EXT. MISSION CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

It's later and we see Deng sitting underneath an awning by himself,

working on his machine gun. Sam approaches...

There is a certain reserved nobility in this man, in the way he

carries himself and speaks. An unwavering strength and self-reliance

born from a lifetime of war and struggle.

Deng hesitates, then hands his AK over to Sam who pops the mag out

and studies it...

Sam pulls out a knife and begins to work on the base plate of the

mag as he explains...

And Sam hands the weapon back.

Sam considers the question for a moment... then simply says...

INT. DORM - MISSION - NIGHT

Fifteen or twenty volunteers lounging on cots in this dorm, playing

cards, talking, smoking. And we find Sam off from the group, on his

bunk, reading The Bible...

Sam turns to find a British man in his late 20's named DAN standing

next to him, thick Cockney accent, smoking a cigarette.

EXT. MISSION CONSTRUCTION SITE - OUTSIDE KAMPALA - DAY

It's mid-day, blazing hot, and we see Sam approaching Deng.

Sam offers him a can and he takes it.

Deng looks at him, surprised by the request...

EXT. DIRT ROAD - RURAL UGANDA - DAY

A dirt road cutting through grassy plain stretching in every

direction... and we see a BRIGHT YELLOW BUS speeding toward us in

the distance, kicking a rooster tail of dust high into the air...

and as it gets closer we see 15 or 20 men piled onto the roof,

hanging on for dear life as this bus bounces over the road...

INT. BUS - DRIVING - RURAL UGANDA - SAME

... Sam and Deng crammed into this crowded bus...

An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to

connect here, but Deng is reticent.

And Deng simply says...

Deng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching

the land blur past. And Sam says nothing more, intuitively feeling

this man's need to be alone in the moment. A great, lost giant.

EXT. UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY

A dense sea of people. 20,000 displaced refugees living on top of

each other.

Life is lived out in the open here... women bent over brightly

colored washtubs sloshing clothes in soapy water... smoke from giant

cooking pots drifting into the air... semi-clothed children, some

with even younger children on their hips, running everywhere. The

poverty and hopelessness is overwhelming.

And we see Sam and Deng walking through the camp...

Deng sweeping his hand, indicating the mass of refugees.

EXT. MEDICAL AREA - UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY

A row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area.

Each enclosure jammed with the desperately sick. Battle-weary AID

WORKERS move among them, doing what they can, caring for the ones

who are most desperately ill.

And another SPLA soldier comes up to Deng --

Deng turns to Sam...

Deng leaves and now Sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of

humanity all around him. And suddenly there's COMMOTION! -- two aid

workers coming into this tent carrying a WOMAN on a stretcher. One

of the aid workers looking around -- a white woman -- mid 30's --

her name is AGNETE CLOSSON, Regional Director of Doctors Without

Borders. She sees Sam across the tent.

Sam moving to her --

Sam grabbing the woman underneath the shoulders as another aid

worker gets her feet...

And they swing the woman over to a cot... but as they do the sheer

piece of blood-stained muslin that was covering her face falls

away... and we see that she has been mutilated... her lips cut off

of her face...

... and now a DOCTOR sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her.

Sam and Agnete pushed back, away from the action. Sam still shocked

by what he's seen.

Agnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam.

And she walks off.

EXT. NIMULE, SUDAN - DUSK

Establishing a bustling trading center on the border of Uganda and

Sudan. Noisy and overpopulated, a maze of concrete and tin

buildings, hundreds of people on the streets, riding bicycles,

finishing their business before nightfall.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT

A stale room with two cots, bare, institutional. Deng on the edge of

his cot, pulling off his boots, taking off his jacket, getting

comfortable. And we see Sam sitting on a small balcony overlooking

the empty street below.

He pulls a baggy of tobacco from his pocket and begins to roll a

cigarette...

And now Deng turns to Sam...

Deng staring at him, skeptical...

INT/EXT. HOTEL - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT

Sam has no response... and Deng lights his cigarette... and suddenly

we hear voices... through the open window... children's voices...

Sam peering into the darkness but seeing nothing... only empty

streets... and then one-by-one... out of the darkness like

apparitions... we see children coming up the street carrying

bedrolls... some of them singing spiritual hymns as they walk...

laughing as children do... at first just a dozen or so... and then

more... fifty... a hundred...

EXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - NUMILE, SUDAN - NIGHT

Deng steps onto the balcony next to Sam.

And we continue to watch this great migration of children... now

streaming into this town... a few of them finding a dark corner just

below us... unrolling their reed mats... huddling up against each

other for the long night...

Sam watching them for another beat then suddenly turning, moving

back into the room...

INT. STAIRWAY - HOTEL - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT

Sam coming down these steps. Deng following.

EXT. HOTEL - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT

Sam exiting the hotel, moving to a group of 5 children huddled on

the sidewalk...

The children looking up, surprised to see a white man here...

The children getting to their feet... and Sam moves to another

cluster of children up the block as Deng catches up to him...

And Sam starts to move up the block further, wanting to gather up

more children, but Deng stops him...

And he looks up the street and we see more children here than we

thought... hundreds of young kids huddled on the streets...

Sam knows he's right. A moment here as he looks to the children he's

gathered, staring up at him...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT

-- and a DOZEN CHILDREN are ushered into this small room. Sam

pushing their cots against a wall so there's more space. Deng

speaking to the children --

-- and they begin to settle onto the floor... and now we notice a

particular BOY in this group... maybe 8 years old... wearing bright

GREEN SHORTS... and we watch as he and his SISTER move to a corner

of the room and unroll their mats...

... and eventually Sam turns off the lamp and we stay here in the

dark... Sam on his cot, listening to these 12 little children

breathing... their shifting bodies on the floor trying to get

comfortable... and then...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NUMILE, SUDAN - DAY

Sam's closed eyes... sound asleep...

Just before dawn. Deng standing over him, shaking him awake...

Sam looking up to him...

Sam sits up, looks around the hotel room and we see that it's

empty... the children vanished... only a small, handmade toy on the

ground which has been left behind.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - RURAL SUDAN - DAY

Sam, Deng, and a few other SPLA SOLDIERS jammed into the flatbed of

this truck, carrying heavy weapons, bouncing fast over this open

dirt road... featureless savanna FADING into sporadic mud huts...

the outskirts of a VILLAGE in the distance... and thin columns of

black smoke twisting into the air...

... and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass

CHILDREN walking along the side of the road... night commuters

returning to their village... some of them huddled together,

weeping...

... and we notice -- Sam notices -- the little boy in the GREEN

SHORTS, walking hand-in-hand with his sister, their faces quiet

masks of fear as they move closer to their home.

EXT. VILLAGE - YEI, SUDAN - DAY

The pickup arrives and Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers hop out...

and this is what they see:

Complete devastation. 30 or 40 bodies mutilated and stacked outside

smoking tukuls. Some children already here, on their knees, weeping

next to the corpses of their parents. If you could smell the air it

would smell of burnt flesh and death.

Sam silent, aghast, just staring at the horror all around him...

... and now we see GREEN SHORTS and his sister arriving at the

village... moving to their family's tukul and discovering their

mother and father piled outside. Naked and burned alive. And the

sister falls onto her mother's corpse and begins to wail as GREEN

SHORTS stands there -- frozen -- staring down at his dead parents --

and suddenly --

MOVEMENT! -- from inside the tukul... a small dog... a family pet...

darting into the open... running across the dirt... GREEN SHORTS

going after it, yelling his name...

Sam watching the boy chasing after his dog, rounding a corner out of

sight...

... for a moment...

... just the boy's voice calling after his dog... and then...

BOOOOM!

A muffled burst -- in the distance -- Sam, Deng, and the other

soldiers running out of the village toward the explosion...

EXT. DIRT ROAD - YEI, SUDAN - DAY

... Sam, Deng, and the others arriving at the source of the

explosion. And we see GREEN SHORTS laying on the side of the road...

cut in half by a land mine... his dead eyes wide open with

surprise...

... and Sam drops to his knees... lifting what's left of the boy

into his arms and rocking him back and forth... and we watch as a

terrible sadness overtakes him... something happening here... a

fierce and overwhelming burden dropping into this man as he holds

this dead boy... in the dirt... in the middle of this savage

world...

... and as Sam puts it, his "life changed forever" in this moment...

and we see him looking up to the heavens...

tears streaming down his face... saying something we can't hear, but

it's a promise... to God...

To save the children of Sudan.

INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY

A bright, fluorescent corridor filled with garish advertising and

harried travelers rushing to make planes... and we find Sam coming

down this concourse, carrying his duffle bag, his face

expressionless. He reaches a revolving door but stops... doesn't

pass through... sees Lynn, Paige, and his mother waiting for him on

the other side... their happy, expectant faces...

But they don't see him yet... and he just stays here... hidden...

watching them through the glass... and as Sam puts it, at this

moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same

way again... in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on

the side of road in Yei...

... and finally he forces a smile, pushes through the revolving door

and we watch, from this side of the glass, as Paige leaps into his

arms... Lynn and Daisy moving to him too, embracing him, welcoming

him home.

INT. BATHROOM - PAIGE'S ROOM - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Paige brushing her teeth at the sink. Sam watching her from the

doorway...

And he grabs her and carries her into the bedroom, plops her onto

the bed...

Sam giving in, playing their little game as she gets under the

covers...

Sam bending over, kissing her forehead...

INT. HALLWAY - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sam coming out of Paige's bedroom, pulling the door closed, finding

Lynn waiting for him.

She senses more but knows this man well enough not to push... and so

she simply turns away.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Quiet. Just Sam on this porch all alone, been here for some time,

eyes far off, images in his mind he can't seem to shake.

And he steps into the yard... walking along the side of the house...

just moving... trying to shed this feeling like snakeskin...

... and he comes to something on the ground which stops him dead in

his tracks... something we don't see yet... and slowly he reaches

down and picks up...

A LITTLE DOLL. One of Paige's toys. Soiled and faded and left in the

dirt. And we watch him holding this forgotten doll... and what we

see on his face ain't pretty... his world collapsing out from under

him... trying to keep rein on his emotions... a battle he's losing.

INT. BEDROOM - CHILDERS HOUSE - MORNING

Lynn stirs awake, looks next to her and realizes Sam never made it

to bed the night before.

EXT. CHILDERS HOUSE - MORNING

Lynn coming out the front door in her nightgown, sees a light on in

a utility shed in the back...

INT. UTILITY SHED - MORNING

... Lynn slowly pushing open the door to find Sam on the floor,

hunched over a pad of Paige's art paper... drawing... paper wads

strewn all around him... been here all night...

He looks up...

He gathers up a couple of the papers, moves to her.

He hands her a sheet of paper -- CU to see it's a crude drawing of

building.

Lynn studying him, trying to judge how serious he is here. And Sam

looking back at her, his eyes like we haven't seen them before.

Sparkling.

She smiles, shaking her head, catching his enthusiasm...

He hands her the other paper -- CU to see it's a another drawing.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY - (MAY/2003)

Eight months later and we're looking at a simple, cinder block

church which is under construction. A scattering of pickup trucks

parked at the site and a flurry of activity. WORKMEN pouring cement,

laying sheetrock, etc. And Sam in the middle of this crew, putting

the finishing touches on a timber frame which is about to be raised.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY

Children at play, laughing, screaming, swinging on swing sets and

digging in a sand pit. And we see Sam off to the side, leaning

against a (new) black Harley, watching Paige playing in the group.

Sam turns to see a BIKER, late 40's, leather vest, standing with his

12 year old DAUGHTER.

The Biker extends his hand, they shake.

She runs off.

EXT. CRACK HOUSE - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY

A torn up house in a shitty part of town, windows spray painted

black. Sam pulls up to the curb on his Harley, gets off, opens one

of the bike's hard cases and pulls out the same SAWED OFF 10 gage

we've seen before... chambers a slug as he moves toward the house...

INT. CRACK HOUSE - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY

Dark, junkie squalor. Two or three people slumped on a ratty couch,

strung-out, watching a flickering TV -- and then --

THE FRONT DOOR CAVES IN!

Sam coming into the house -- sawed-off leveled -- junkies scrambling

for cover -- YELLING! -- CHAOS! -- Sam moving into --

INT. CRACK HOUSE - BACK ROOM - DAY

Sam comes around the corner and finds himself face-to-face with a

CRACKHEAD pointing a .357 MAGNUM -- eyes amped up and wild --

shaking -- a stand-off -- and Sam sees a body on a bare mattress in

the b.g. -- bone thin and pale -- spent hypodermic hanging out of

his arm --

It's Donnie.

A TENSE BEAT -- not sure how this is gonna go -- and then the

CRACKHEAD shakes his head "no"

INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY

Donnie in a bed, covers pulled up to his neck and he's shaking bad,

retching in a bucket, deep in the throes of a detox. Sam and Lynn

here doing what they can, toweling off his forehead, trying to keep

him warm, as Donnie pulls the sheets tighter, gritting his teeth,

shaking his head.

And somehow Donnie finds strength in his words, and in Sam's hand

touching his head, and he nods.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY - (AUGUST/2003)

A bright Sunday morning and we're staring at the cinder block church

which is almost completely finished... the sound of a garage band

coming from inside, playing an unlikely rendition of a spiritual

hymn... and a handful of people, dressed for service, moving up the

cement stairs into...

INT. ENTRY HALL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY

And we see Donnie, dressed in his biker jacket and a buttondown

shirt, sober for the moment, greeting people as they come through

the front door. Standing next to him is Daisy handing out programs.

INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - DAY

Still under construction. Exposed beams and bare insulation on the

walls. There's a small riser at the front of the hall with an altar,

organ, and the GARAGE BAND playing the rocked-out hymn.

A handful of people here sitting in pews. FARMERS in clean overalls,

FACTORY WORKERS, BIKERS still dressed in their riding leathers,

listening to the garage band and chatting.

And now we see Lynn and Paige (11) standing near the back. Lynn

nervous, checking her watch.

INT. FOYER - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY

Sam on his knees, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, wrenching a

leaking pipe. Lynn and Daisy walk in...

Sam hearing this, moving to his feet, toweling off his hands.

Lynn exits and Daisy steps forward, shuts the door behind her. Just

she and Sam here alone now.

INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY

Sam entering at the back of the chapel, taking a moment to

appreciate what he's looking at: 20 or 30 people here in the church

that he built. A dream realized. And he walks down the center aisle,

shaking hands with a few people, climbing steps to the altar and

switching on the microphone...

Sam turning to the crowd, clearing his throat, clearly nervous.

Some applause. Lynn and Paige sitting with Daisy who is beaming.

An awkward beat...

A beat, considering what to say... and he begins...

Sam holding up a worn bible, and we start to notice something

here... a transformation happening in this man as he speaks to these

people. His nervousness falling away and a natural charisma taking

over...

And we see the congregation hanging on his every word, identifying

with this man standing before them. One of their own.

Some laughter and applause...

And the congregation responds with a Hallelujah!

INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY

Sam holding Paige, her face buried in his shoulder, crying.

Lynn pulling Paige off, kissing Sam on the lips.

Sam turning to Donnie, and we see he's back to the hulking man he

once was.

Sam winks, slaps Donnie on the shoulder, as we --

EXT. SPLA CAMP - KITGUM, UGANDA - DAY

FULL SCREEN - SEVEN LARGE SHIPPING BOXES RIPPED OPEN

And we see a line of SPLA soldiers (including NINETEEN, MARCO, and

A.J.) sitting in the dirt, pulling on NEW BOOTS, smiling, spit-

polishing them to a high shine.

Sam and Deng watching the soldiers.

INT. TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY

Deng driving fast down this bumpy road. Sam in the passenger seat.

Nineteen, Marco, and A.J. in the flatbed of this truck, ever

watchful.

EXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY

Sam already out of the truck, moving into the bush. Deng

following...

But he's not listening, moving through the scrub to a small

clearing... walking around...

Sam kneeling down, picking up a handful of red dirt, letting it

trickle through his fingers...

EXT. NIMULE - ON THE BORDER OF SUDAN AND UGANDA - DAY

Establishing a busy trading town on the border of Sudan and Uganda.

And we see a small crowd of villagers standing underneath a tarp,

watching a small color TV (the only TV for miles) -- on the screen

we see a black man in a military uniform giving a fiery speech --

this is JOHN GARANG -- one of the good guys -- the founder of the

SPLA.

INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICE - NIMULE, SUDAN - DAY

A tight, cramped office filled with villagers. Two or three men

here at desks handling the administration of life in the bush:

renewing travel papers, registering newborn children, hearing

complaints from local farmers, etc. And we see Sam and Deng at one

of these desks, a topographical map splayed out in front of them.

Sam pointing to the map. The Administrator turning to Deng --

The Administrator turning to him, laying it out simply --

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANGE - SUDAN - DAY - THREE MONTHS LATER

What we're looking at is the modest beginning of The Angels of East

Africa Children's Orphanage. A cluster of tukuls and 2 or 3

rudimentary wood buildings built on the dirt Sam first let trickle

between his fingers.

And we see life already finding it's place within these bamboo

walls. Acholi WORKERS laying brick on what will eventually become a

schoolhouse and chapel.

And we find Sam with two or three small CHILDREN who are crying for

no apparent reason. He's on his knees, trying his best to soothe

them but he is way out of his depth here.

And now we see Deng in the b.g. approaching with a powerfully built

Ugandan woman in her late 40's.

Betty, no reaction. Just the incessant crying of the children in the

b.g.

Betty hears this, turns to the crying children and softly says --

-- and instantly their crying stops.

INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANGE - NIGHT

We see Betty and another Camp Woman (ROSE) moving through this room

carrying lanterns, helping the children get ready for sleep --

And we see Sam here too, doing what he can, tucking in a few of the

kids, starting to make a connection with these children.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

And we see a handful of SPLA soldiers stationed around the perimeter

of the compound, standing guard. Sam and Deng sitting next to a

lantern by the front gate.

Sam feeling terrible, realizes he's offended him.

Quiet, awkward, just the two of them sitting here quietly for a long

beat. Finally...

And Deng smiles brightly. Sam realizing he's been played. And Deng

starts to LAUGH. A deep, guttural, infectious laugh. Sam joining

him, and we sense that at this moment these two have become friends.

And gradually their laughter subsides, and it's quiet again.

Deng considering this for a beat, and then...

BEAT.

EXT. AFRICA NIGHT - PITCH BLACK

The heavy stillness of an African summer night. Only the sound of

Kestrel hawks screeching far off in the distance, hunting prey...

and the drone of African Cicadas buzzing all around us.

INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

The children sprawled on their mats sound asleep.

INT. SOLDIER'S BARRACKS - CHILDREN'S ORPHANGE - NIGHT

Deng and a few other soldiers sleeping on bedrolls.

INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

Sam sitting on his cot. He rips open an airmail package and pulls

out a small VIDEOCASSETTE, slides it in a VIDEOCAMERA, hits play --

ON THE SMALL VIDEO SCREEN we see Paige, dressed in a pilgrim

costume, performing in a Thanksgiving Day play. Her voice coming

through the tiny speakers as she recites her lines. Sam smiling at

what he's watching.

EXT. FRONT GATE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

A few of the SPLA soldiers sitting next to their weapons in the

dark, smoking, tossing beads into a carved wooden trough, playing

the ancient game of Mancala --

Soldier #3 reacting to his mistake as --

-- WE SEE SHADOWS IN THE DARKNESS... MAYBE 10 OR 12 FIGURES MOVING

SLOWLY THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH... LRA REBELS... APPROACHING THE

PERIMETER OF THE ORPHANAGE.

The SPLA soldiers oblivious to the advance.

INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

Sam watching Paige's play -- when suddenly --

AN EXPLOSION! -- machinegun fire popping o.s. -- Sam hitting the

ground, scrambling for cover --

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

-- Sam rushing out of his tukul -- sees the front gate OBLITERATED

from a grenade blast -- bamboo fence burning -- the death song of

AK47's howling in the darkness --

-- Sam hustling across the compound -- joining Deng and another

soldier behind a makeshift shed --

Sam peering around the corner -- sees MUZZLE FLASHES in the

blackness -- maybe 15 or 20 rebels moving through the bush like

specters -- flanking the compound --

Sam looking around, realizing the rest of the SPLA soldiers are

scattered throughout the compound firing randomly into the dark.

Sam, split-second decision here -- and he starts to sprint across

the compound to --

INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

TERRIFIED SCREAMING! -- the children cowering in the corners --

Betty and Rose here trying to calm them down --

Sam bursting through the door --

Betty nodding as Sam rushes out --

INT. STOREROOM - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

-- Sam bombing into this shed -- quickly opening a metal chest and

pulling out an AK47 and mags of ammo --

EXT. FRONT GATE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

-- Sam scrambling across the compound with the AK -- moves next to

Deng and pops a mag into the machinegun --

And Sam starts to open up the AK -- laying down a curtain of

suppression fire as Deng shouts to his men --

-- and they start to fall back to the center of the orphanage --

INT. CHAPEL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

Betty and the other Camp woman herding the terrified children into

this building -- the only brick structure on the compound -- and

then Deng, Marco, A.J. and the other SPLA soldiers coming in --

moving to the window holes and returning fire --

EXT. FRONT GATE - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

Sam sweeping the AK back and forth, trying to hold off the rebels as

long as he can -- and then --

KABOOOM!!

More of the fence eviscerated by a grenade blast.

REBELS ADVANCING ON THE ORPHANAGE -- BREACHING THE PERIMETER --

Sam becoming overwhelmed in the fight -- firing as he retreats back

into the compound --

INT. CHAPEL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

-- Sam storming into the chapel -- turning to Betty --

Betty and the other woman do exactly that -- they move the children

into a tight group in the center of the room.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

Rebels moving through the compound, firing into tukuls and setting

everything on fire.

INT. CHAPEL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

Sam, Deng and the other soldiers returning fire --

Sam starting to open up with his AK -- Krakakakakakak! -- spent

shells showering down around the children huddled in the middle of

the room.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

Rebels swarming around the chapel, but reaching a point where they

can't advance any further --

-- and we see a rebel squat behind a shed and screw an RPG into a

launcher -- he pops up -- levels the launcher at the chapel and --

Krakakakakak!

He's cut down before he's able to fire --

INT. CHAPEL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

-- Sam sweeping his AK across the compound -- the other soldiers

burning through magazines and reloading -- rebels firing back --

Betty and the children crowded on the floor in the middle of this

STORM OF GUNFIRE -- and we stay in this little chapel -- watching

this last stand -- until we --

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - MORNING

And we see the entire orphanage has been razed to the ground. Betty

and a few of the children picking through the burned out buildings

and torched tukuls, looking for anything salvageable. Deng,

Nineteen, and some of the SPLA soldiers loading the corpses of

rebels into the back of the truck...

... and now we find Sam staring at the brick chapel in the middle of

the compound. The only structure that remains. Everything else --

his entire dream -- in ashes.

INT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT

And we see Lynn pushing a shopping cart down the aisle, past shelves

loaded with packaged produce. And we hear BUZZING. Lynn digging the

cell phone out of her purse --

EXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, SUDAN - SAME (DAY)

And we find Sam sitting at a table along this dusty, crowded street.

His duffelbag on the ground next to him.

INT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT

Lynn immediately senses something wrong.

EXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, SUDAN - SAME (DAY)

And we see that he's not. This man is empty, alone, defeated.

INT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT

She hears the anguish in his voice.

EXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, SUDAN - DAY

INT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT

And we're watching her here, clocking the resignation in his voice.

A moment of quiet for both of them. Lynn sensing the dimensions of

his heartache. All she wants to do is bring him home, hold him

close, ease his pain... but she knows that's not what he needs...

not this man...

EXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, CAFE - DAY

INT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT

And we see her move around a corner into an empty aisle, away from

the other shoppers. And she says...

EXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, SUDAN - DAY

And we watch Sam listening, finding strength in what this woman says

next...

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

BEGIN SEQUENCE. Giving us a sense that many months are passing.

-- Sam and a crew of VILLAGE MEN hauling the charred remnants of

tukuls and burned building out of the compound on their backs.

-- The remainder of the bamboo fence that once surrounded the

orphanage being torn down.

-- Nineteen, Marco, A.J. and a few other SPLA soldiers cutting the

bush away from the edge of the compound with machetes.

-- Sam, Deng and the crew of village men digging post holes around

the perimeter of the orphanage...

-- The men sinking metal beams into the holes with cement, then

surrounding the compound with heavy gage CHAINLINK FENCE.

-- New DORMS being built from brick. An INFIRMARY. A MESS HALL.

SOLDIER'S BARRACKS. And finally, Sam laying the last brick on the

chapel in the center of the compound. Completing it.

INT. OFFICE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

A simple administrative office with a short-wave radio and sat

phone. Sam here, sitting at a desk when we hear a knock at the door.

The door opens and we see Deng.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

Sam following Deng to the center of the compound where we see 5 or 6

camp women (including Betty and Rose) dressed in colorful robes and

headdresses. Maybe 80 children here, quietly sitting in the dirt,

watching the women. Nineteen, Marco, A.J. and the rest of the SPLA

soldiers here too, watching from the side.

And now the women begin to move in unison... singing an ancient

Acholi song as one of the older orphan boys beats a small drum in

accompaniment...

The women continuing their dance... moving in a tight circle and

stomping their feet as they sing...

And now Betty peels away from the group and approaches Sam, talking

to him directly in Arabic...

Sam looking to the 80 little orphans watching this from the side...

and now Betty bends down and scoops up a bit of ashen earth and runs

her finger across his forehead, blessing him...

OFF SAM standing here with his ashen face, staring at these people

in front of him -- his African family.

INT. MESS HALL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

Days later and we see Sam here with Nineteen and a few other SPLA

soldiers, eating lunch, trying to learn their language. And it's

humorous to these guys as Sam tries to pronounce some words in

Arabic...

And suddenly we hear YELLING coming from outside.

EXT. MESS HALL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

Sam coming out fast, sees soldiers pulling open the front gate as

THREE pickup trucks speed into the compound -- SPLA military trucks -

- skidding to a stop.

Sam rushing over as soldiers help two YOUNG BOYS out of one of the

trucks. Both are around 5 years old, injured and crying. And then a

third child is lifted out in a makeshift stretcher -- this is ALICE -

- 10 years old -- her broken body limp and bleeding profusely --

mumbling something to herself in Arabic over-and-over again --

INT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAY

-- DOORS BANGING OPEN! -- CONTROLLED CHAOS as the children are

hauled into this clinic -- Betty taking care of Alice -- the worst

off -- hooking her up to an IV as Sam moves to her bedside -- the

little girl still mumbling quietly --

Sam taking Alice's hand in his... very slowly her beautiful eyes

open and she sees him... and says something in Arabic...

Betty translates and Alice smiles faintly... and now one of the

other camp women comes over and Sam steps back so they can work...

EXT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DUSK

Sam coming out of the infirmary and finding Deng here with a few of

the SPLA soldiers who brought the children.

Off Sam, hearing this, we...

EXT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAWN

And we see Sam and Deng sitting outside the infirmary, exhausted,

been here all night waiting. And now the door opens and Betty comes

out. She looks down at them and simply shakes her head...

And we know Alice is dead.

And it looks like a grenade has gone off inside Sam. And suddenly he

grabs an AK and gets up, seething, walks off...

EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - DAY

... Sam walking fast through the compound... Deng following...

Sam reaching the SUV and starting to gear up...

FADE UP the plaintive wail of an Acholi WAR SONG... haunting...

ethereal... and then a chorus of voices rising up... taking us to...

INT. SUV - DRIVING - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY

Bombing down this rutted, red dirt road. The engine at full tilt.

Sam, Deng, Nineteen, Marco, and A.J. jammed into this truck riding

in dead silence... AK47's bouncing between their knees... only the

sound of the WAR SONG playing as we watch these men... a grave

stillness on their faces... thinking of what men do just before

their own death.

EXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY

We see two LRA VEHICLES approaching in the distance... a LEAD JEEP

and a PICKUP TRUCK behind it...

INT. LRA PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY

Four CHILD SOLDIERS squatting in the flatbed of this truck carrying

AK47's. We recognize one of the boys as the younger brother from the

opening scene -- WILLIAM.

INT. LRA JEEP - DRIVING - DAY

With two ADULT REBELS in this Jeep as they drive down this road past

bombed-out vehicles... and in the distance we see the smoldering

wreckage of a transport truck on the side of the road... the thick

smoke hanging over the road like a black curtain... blocking out

vision of the road ahead...

... and the Jeep punches into the black smoke followed by the pickup

truck... and we're lost in the swirling haze for a moment before

coming out the other side... and this is what we see --

SAM -- standing in the middle of the road ahead of us shouldering a

RPG -- the ADULT REBELS see him just as --

WHOOOOSH! -- an RPG streaks right at us and DETONATES -- KABOOOOM! --

and the Jeep flips onto it's side --

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

THE PICKUP GRINDS TO A STOP! -- the driver slamming it into REVERSE -

- accelerating back into the curtain of smoke -- trying to get the

fuck out of there when --

BBrrraaaappp!

.30 CALIBER MACHINEGUN STRAFE across the front hood --

EXT. SUV - SAME

-- and we see A.J. behind the .30 cal -- opening it up --

BBRAAAAAAPPP! -- BBRAAAAAPPP! -- blasting the engine compartment of

the truck, trying to disable it --

EXT. LRA PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

-- the pickup truck reversing out of the black smoke -- OUT OF

CONTROL -- going off the road into a ditch -- WILLIAM and the other

boys bailing out of the flatbed -- TWO ADULT REBELS piling out of

the cab -- scrambling for cover behind the truck.

EXT. BUSH - DAY

Sam, Deng, A.J. and the others hustling through the smoke and

finding cover. From Sam's vantage point he sees rebels hiding

behind the disabled truck for cover -- shooting back -- a withering

firefight -- the big .30 cal ROARING offscreen but the truck is

protecting the rebels -- no clear shot --

EXT. LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY

William and the other child soldiers here with two ADULT REBELS --

crouched behind the truck for cover -- the ADULT REBELS returning

fire, but the children aren't moving, scared shitless.

William peers around the truck and sees Sam fifty yards away, turns

to the boys next to him...

The other boys reacting, this means something to them. And now one

of the ADULT REBEL turns to the children...

And he pops up and returns fire, but the boys don't move.

EXT. BUSH - DAY

MARCO running through the smoke toward Sam. He hits the ground and

starts to screw an RPG into his launcher... he wants to hit the

transport truck, but Sam shakes his head, waves him off...

Marco hears this, ditches the RPG and picks up his AK.

Marco laying down suppression fire as Sam sprints across the road --

advancing on the transport truck -- firing his AK from the hip --

bullets zinging past him -- he dives behind a berm and finds himself

next to Deng. Neither man says a word as they jam fresh mags into

their AK's, gunfire erupting all around them.

EXT. LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY

The adult rebels continue fighting -- alternately popping up from

behind the truck and returning fire. The ADULT REBEL realizing that

William and the other boys still aren't fighting --

But William and the other boys don't move, and the Adult Rebel keeps

shooting until his mag clicks empty. He looks around and sees an RPG

LAUNCHER on the ground, picks it up, arms it --

EXT. BERM - DAY

Sam and Deng behind the berm. Sam peers over just as GUNFIRE misses

him by inches. He drops back.

Deng shakes his head --

Sam chambers a round, pivots around the berm as --

EXT. LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - SAME

-- the Adult Rebel stands up with the RPG -- fires! -- at the same

instant William shoots him in the head -- he jerks -- WOOOOOSH! --

the missile launching at a bad angle as --

SAM COMES OUT FROM BEHIND THE BERM

RPG streaking directly at him -- hitting the ground short --

BA-WHOOOM! --

AND OUR VISION EXPLODES TO WHITE

For a long beat... only silence... and then slowly the white begins

to fade... and we see Sam flat on his back... eyes blinking open...

shell-shocked... staring up at blue sky... and then a shadow coming

over him... someone stepping into his POV...

it's William, hands held open in surrender, staring curiously at

this strange white man laying in the dirt... and now Deng and Marco

appear next to Sam and help him to his feet.

And we see the battle is over. The remaining child soldiers slowly

emerging from behind the LRA truck... laying down their weapons and

walking toward Sam... joining William... staring at this white man

in front of them...

... William reaches into his pocket and...

... Deng and Marco REACT -- lifting their AK's -- "Don't move! Don't

move!" -- but the boy only pulls out a FADED PHOTOGRAPH... the one

he grabbed just before his capture... a picture of him and his older

brother... standing next to each other smiling.

INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

80 children laying on the floor on reed mats, getting ready for

sleep. And we find William in mid-conversation with a young boy

named Anthony.

Anthony nods. William pulls out his photograph.

Anthony studying the photograph...

William folding up the photograph, getting up, moving to another

little boy a few feet away... kneeling next to him... and so he

continues...

EXT. GENERATOR HUT - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

A soldier cuts off the generator and the compound goes black.

INT. TUKUL - NIGHT

And we see Sam on his cot when the light goes out. He leans over and

torches a small Kerosene lamp next to him.

INT. DORM - NIGHT

The children on their mats in the dark now... quiet... a few of the

younger ones whimpering, starting to cry... the darkness becoming

too much... reminding them of past horrors... and then we hear a

FAINT VOICE in this dark room... singing quietly... an ancient

African lullaby... and then other little voices joining in...

singing this song they all know... a song their mother's once sang

to them...

INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

... Sam hearing the soft chorus drift across the compound... somehow

finding comfort in it too... blowing out the lamp and laying here in

the dark... listening to the children sing.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING

A SLOW DISSOLVE... life springing up in the camp... daylight

breaking... a routine seen here... Betty, Rose and the other camp

women arriving at the orphanage... cooking fires being lit...

soldiers drinking cups of strong coffee, warming themselves after a

long night...

... and Sam coming out of his tukul carrying his duffle bag...

discovering William curled up next to his door, sleeping on a mat in

the dirt... been there all night. William stirring awake, seeing Sam

above him and scrambling to his feet.

William, no response. Just staring up at him.

William, nothing.

And Sam walks across the compound followed by William a few paces

behind... and he reaches Deng, Betty, Nineteen, and a few of the

other volunteers waiting by the truck...

Sam tosses his bag into the back, says goodbye to everyone...

They shake hands and Sam gets into the truck... and we see William

already here, sitting in the backseat.

But William isn't moving...

... and finally Deng reaches in and grabs him... tries to pull him

out but he fights back... yelling as Deng drags him out of the

truck...

INT. TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY

Sam turning around in his seat as we pull away from the compound...

and he sees William still struggling in Deng's arms... and finally

he breaks free and SPRINTS for the truck as it drives off... fast as

he can... chasing Sam until he no longer can.

INT. SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH/KITCHEN - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY

And we see two teens moving toward the sound of a crowd coming from

inside the church, responsive, "Hallelujah!"... and then Sam's voice

over it all...

INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - SAME

Sam at the pulpit in mid-sermon. There is an air of Fire and

Brimstone to what we're watching here... electric... the

congregation listening in rapt attention...

Ad-libbed SHOUTS and PRAISE... and now we see Lynn, Daisy, Donnie

and Paige in the congregation listening... as we go --

INT. HALLWAY/FOYER - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY

Lynn and Sam walking through the facility, and we see this place is

alive with activity. More than just a church, this is a community

center. Lynn opening a door and we see a Volunteer here with a dozen

little children running around this playroom...

Lynn pulling the door closed and they continue... moving down a set

of stairs to the basement where we see children and parents... some

of them playing ping-pong and air hockey... others in a corner

rehearsing for a Christmas play...

Sam turning to her --

Lynn catching up to him now, realizing his head is still back in

Africa.

INT. SHED - CHILDERS HOUSE - DAY

Sam working on his Harley. Donnie entering in the b.g.

Donnie moving next to him, working on the bike...

Sam smiling...

Sam and Donnie share a laugh.

And we see in Donnie's eyes just how troubled he is.

And they both take a knee, bowing their heads as Sam continues...

And we leave these two men, their heads bowed in quiet supplication,

next to this Harley, praying for strength.

INT. SHOWROOM - CAR DEALERSHIP - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY (JULY/2004)

Four or five gleaming sedans on this showroom floor. And we see Sam

sitting across from BILL WALLACE, late 40's, gold Rolex.

Sam, getting down to business...

Bill feeling the rub, shaking his head...

Sam shifting, not giving up, coming at him another way...

Bill staring at him, saying nothing, on the spot. Sam hoping that

somehow he's reached this man. And finally Bill stands up...

Sam feeling this victory, flashing a smile, shaking Bill's hand.

INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

Upscale French provincial in suburban Johnstown. A "barbeque" is

underway. 15 couples here with their kids and a handful of waiters

in white-tie offering champagne and hors d'oeuvres to the guests.

DOOR BELL RINGING -- and we see a perky woman in her late 40's

coming through the crowd, blonde hair from a bottle, accessorized to

the hilt, holding a glass of white wine. SHANNON WALLACE. She opens

the door to find Sam, Lynn, and Paige standing in the doorway.

And they enter... Lynn smiling awkwardly, dressed in the same yellow

dress we saw her in previously... her only dress... and Sam looking

around this enormous room...

Smiling, a joke she loves...

Everybody turning to see the car dealer coming through the crowd,

smiling, a little drunk. AD-LIBBED introductions and then...

Bill ushering them deeper into the house... quick intros to a few

guests as they pass... Sam, Lynn, and Paige taking it all in...

starting to sense the dimensions of this massive house... the

waiters in their pressed jackets offering them food... the

extravagance... like nothing they've ever seen...

... Bill pulling Sam off from the crowd so it's just the two of

them... taking an envelope from his jacket and handing it to him...

INT. BATHROOM - SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

Sam coming into this bathroom and locking the door... taking the

envelope out of his pocket and tearing it open... pulling out a

personal check -- CLOSE UP to see it's in the amount of $150

HOLD ON Sam face, and it's disgust we see in his eyes.

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

Front door opening fast and Lynn and Paige coming out, followed by

Sam, pushing them along...

Shannon appearing in the doorway in the b.g., calling after...

Lynn turning to respond, but Sam keeps her moving forward, down the

driveway, past the line of parked BMW's and Mercedes to their truck

at the curb...

As they load into the truck...

INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - DAY

-- Sam coming into the house, enraged, followed by Lynn. He moves to

his gun cabinet, grabs a hidden key, unlocks it...

And he starts pulling out weapons... shotguns and assault rifles...

stuffing them into an oversize gun bag...

Lynn reaching for him and he grabs her wrist... tightly... staring

at her with dark eyes. A flash of the "old" Sam Childers here when

he says...

And for the first time in years this woman is scared. He lets go of

her wrist and continues to fill the bag -- and we go --

EXT. PAWN SHOP - JOHNSTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

Sam coming out followed by the Shop Owner...

REVERSE to see Lynn's car parked at the curb, Sam pointing to it...

The Shop Owner considering, as we go...

EXT. ROAD - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

Windy, pissing rain. And we see Sam walking up this rural road,

hands in his pockets, head down... the only human for miles...

trudging through this shitstorm completely alone.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

And we see Sam with a group of men working in the sweltering heat...

laying brick... adding another room to the children's dorm...

... and he squints into the distance, sees a cloud of dust on the

horizon, cars coming closer.

EXT. MAIN GATE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

Seven or eight heavily armed vehicles coming through the gate. Maybe

20 or 30 SPLA soldiers guarding a black SUBURBAN in the middle of

this motorcade. Nineteen waving his hand, yelling as the cars pass --

Palpable excitement ripples through the compound... Sam's soldiers

grabbing their weapons and forming a ragged line near the Suburban

as it stops...

... the back door to the Suburban opens and a black man, dressed in

shirtsleeves and slacks, steps out. The same man we saw giving the

fiery speech on the little outdoor TV in Nimule earlier -- JOHN

GARANG.

Sam turns to Deng --

Deng nods as we go...

EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - DAY

Sam and Garang walking through the middle of camp, trailed by a

squad of SPLA bodyguards and camp children...

And they continue through the camp. A few of the children running up

to Garang, touching the cuff of his shirt, then sprinting away...

Garang smiling, an instant affinity for this man.

And another child runs up to Garang, touching him, and then sprints

away giggling...

More children running up... Garang touching their heads...

Sam turning to him, coming to an understanding here. Realizing that

both of them are warriors in the same fight.

And now we see they have arrived at the brick chapel in the middle

of the compound. Garang turning to him, eyes suddenly becoming

dark...

AND SUDDENLY WE'RE SOMEPLACE FAR AWAY... ANOTHER WORLD... THE

SILHOUETTES OF ANIMALS DANCING ON A DARK CEILING... PROJECTED FROM A

CHILD'S NIGHTLIGHT... WE ARE...

INT. PAIGE'S ROOM - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Donnie tucking Paige into bed, making it up as he goes, clearly out

of his depth here but wanting to do it right.

And Donnie does just that, bends down and kisses Paige on the

head...

And now we see Lynn in the hallway having just witnessed this

through the cracked door, keenly feeling Sam absence in this moment.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

And we see Sam, Betty and Rose leading a group of children, their

hands covering their eyes so they can't see, into a clearing behind

one of the dorms.

The children inching forward, following his voice, until...

And we see a hundred little eyes popping open, staring at something

off screen, confused for a split second at what they're looking at.

REVERSE to see a PLAYGROUND: two or three battered swingsets, a few

see-saws, and a jungle gym soldered out of metal pipe.

And the kids SPRINTING for it, climbing all over the jungle gym like

ants... hitting the swing-sets... and then we hear it... something

we realize we haven't heard in this place before... the sound of

laughter... children losing themselves in play. Innocence flooding

back.

And now we see Nineteen, A.J. and two other SPLA soldiers standing

around a BUNNY BOUNCER... staring at it quizzically... talking in

Arabic, trying to decide what this thing is... and then A.J., the

bravest, slings his AK onto his back and carefully straddles the

bouncer... pulling up his long legs and resting his feet on the

pegs...

And he begins to bob back and forth... holding onto the bunny's ears

with his big hands... the other soldiers starting to laugh as he

bobs faster... and then we see A.J's smile... a million watt smile

on this guy... the first time he's played like this since he was a

boy.

EXT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER

Hours later and we see Sam pushing a couple of the smaller children

on the swingset. Deng approaches...

Sam, no reaction, just keeps swinging the children...

Deng clearly worried for his friend, but doesn't press the issue.

And now Sam notices William off from the group, sitting on the

ground by himself, not playing.

Sam approaching William, kneeling down next to him.

William, no response.

William, no reaction whatsoever. Something dawning on Sam in this

moment...

William just stares back at him and Sam realizes he doesn't speak

English. And they both just sit here for a moment, silent, staring

at the children playing on the playground. And then Sam, feeling the

need to unburden himself, begins to talk...

William watching him quietly.

And he stops and it's silent between them again. William just

sitting there quietly. And Sam looks up to the sky... feeling his

life washing over him... his burden... this fear.

INT. SUV - DRIVING - DAY

Sam behind the wheel, driving alone the edge of a dry ravine. Deng

is in the passenger seat and we see Nineteen, Marco and A.J. crammed

into the back.

Deng checking a handheld GPS unit --

Sam looking out the window, sees movement at the bottom of the

ravine.

... and we see what he sees -- CHILDREN hiding behind a bush.

EXT. RAVINE - DAY

And we see the SUV picking it's way down the rocky slope... reaching

the dry riverbed below and moving closer to the children...

EXT. SUV - DAY

... and the terrain becomes inaccessible and the SUV stops. Unable

to go any further. Sam and the others getting out of the truck and

we see two children hiding behind a bush 50 yards away. Sam

WHISTLING to the kids, but they draw back. Too scared to move.

A.J. and Nineteen move off as Sam pops the rear hatch on the SUV and

pulls out a MEDICAL BAG.

EXT. RIVERBED - DAY

A.J. and Nineteen moving over rocks toward the children, calling out

to them in Arabic -- "Come out, we won't hurt you." -- but they

don't move...

... and finally they reach the kids and we see it's two boys (6

years old), kneeling in the dirt, terrified...

He smiles, reaches for one of the boys -- and --

-- A SHOT RINGS OUT!

-- A BULLET hits A.J. in the neck, killing him instantly.

Nineteen dives behind a boulder for cover.

EXT. SUV - DAY

Sam, Deng, and Marco scramble behind the SUV. A moment before we

hear Nineteen YELLING offscreen.

Nineteen responds.

SNIPER POV -- and we see A.J.'s lifeless body lying by the

children... and the SUV... and then part of Sam's head peering from

behind the truck --

EXT. SUV - DAY

Sam looking through binocs as --

-- A SHOT RINGS OUT! -- hitting the windshield right next to his

head, and he drops behind the truck.

Deng opening the rear door and reaching inside the truck... pulling

out a long barrel HUNTING RIFLE as...

-- A SHOT RINGS OUT!

The bullet hitting the SUV, narrowly missing Deng. He slides the

HUNTING RIFLE to Sam.

SNIPER POV -- locked on the SUV when suddenly -- Deng and Marco

pivot around the truck and start firing -- bullets popping all

around and the sniper drops for cover as --

EXT. SUV - DAY

-- Sam SPRINTS over the rocks and dives into a shallow ditch out of

sight. Deng and Marco stop firing and drop back behind the SUV.

SNIPER POV -- slowly pops up from behind the rocks after the

shooting stops. And we realize he didn't see Sam change positions.

EXT. DITCH - DAY

Sam rolling onto his stomach and slowly sliding the barrel of the

rifle between two rocks... then seeing a sliver of the SNIPER hidden

on the ridge.

SNIPER POV -- still locked on the SUV, waiting for a clear shot.

EXT. DITCH - DAY

Sam putting a bead on the Sniper, but at this range the shot is

going to take instinct. Sam turns his head away from the rifle and

exhales -- controls his breathing -- as we go --

SNIPER POV -- trained on the SUV... and then we see a FLASH from the

right side of the screen... and a delayed POP!...

CRACKKK! -- THE SNIPER DROPS

Killed instantly.

EXT. SUV - DAY

Deng looking through binocs at the ridge --

EXT. RIVERBED - DAY

Sam, Deng, and Marco moving toward the children, weapons drawn,

scanning the area in all directions. Deng is the first one to reach

the boys who are huddled on the ground, shaking from fear...

But the boys don't move... and Deng reaches down, pulls them to

their feet and we see that their ankles are chained to a post which

has been buried in the ground.

Sam joins Deng, sees the chains.

Sam realizing that these children were used as bait -- for him.

EXT. RAVINE RIDGE - DAY

We're at the top of the ravine now and we see Sam and the others

moving toward the location of the SNIPER...

... and Sam is the first to reach the body... laying on the ground

face down... a pool of blood soaking the dirt underneath... and he

rolls the body onto it's back and we see it's just a kid -- no older

than 15 years old.

INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

It's late at night and we see Sam on his cot, sitting here in the

dark. And we hear the sound of his satellite phone vibrating on the

table next to him. He picks it up, sees DONNIE'S name on the

screen...

INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

And we see Donnie on a couch by himself in this shitty little room.

INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION:

And now we see Donnie's DOPE WORKS sitting on the table in front of

him. He's using again.

And it's silent between them... both of these men lost in their own

worries for a moment... and then...

And we're watching Sam, this question hitting him like a freight

train. Unable to answer.

EXT. NIMULE - SUDAN, AFRICA - DAY - DAYS LATER

We're hit by a crush of people, a thousand black faces moving past

us and all the noise and confusion of this busy border town. And we

find Sam, Deng, and Nineteen here loading supplies into the back of

the SUV.

Sam turning to find Agnete, the aid worker, approaching him.

Sam turning to her, face-to-face, starting to get pissed...

Sam, finished with this conversation, slams the lift-gate closed on

the truck and starts to climb in...

Sam looking at her and there's a warning in what she says next...

about violence corrupting men... consuming them...

EXT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DUSK

Sam sitting outside his tukul alone, tearing open an airmail package

and pulling out another VIDEOCASSETTE, slides it into his

videocamera, hits play --

ON THE SMALL SCREEN we see a school production... children dressed

in costumes shuffling across the stage... lines being spoken by

rote...and then the awkward entrance of Paige speaking her lines...

but instead of finding joy in this sweet moment he finds

heartache... the distance from his family... from their innocence...

simply too great to bear in this moment...

... and then he hears giggling... and he realizes two young orphan

BOYS have snuck up behind him and are looking at the screen over his

shoulder... and Sam holds it up so they can see better and now more

children gather around -- maybe 10 or 15 kids -- pointing at the

small screen... giggling and chatting in Arabic...

The children laughing hysterically... and for an instant Sam is

swept out of his melancholy by their sweet enjoyment...

... and then Sam sees Deng and Nineteen approaching quickly...

EXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN SUDAN - NIGHT

A moonless night... and we see headlights piercing this blackness...

bouncing down a singletrack road... we are...

INT. SAM'S TRUCK - DRIVING - NIGHT

Deng behind the wheel driving -- Sam in the passenger seat -- Marco,

Nineteen, and a third SPLA SOLDIER jammed in the back --

Far ahead we see three sets of HEADLIGHTS coming towards us on the

road -- just bouncing white dots on the horizon -- and silently

they begin to check their mags and weapons -- preparing for battle --

-- and the headlights get closer -- Deng not slowing down -- and we

realize we are on a collision course with this convoy -- and finally

we see MUZZLE FLASHES in the distance -- and --

THUNK!, THUNK!, THUNK!

Machine gun strafe hitting the front and side of the truck --

Sam and Nineteen leaning through the open windows as Deng drives --

leveling their AK's and firing --

KRAKAKAKAKAK! KRAKAKAKAKAK!

And now the approaching convoy LIGHTS UP with RETURN FIRE! -- Sam

and Nineteen hanging out the windows blasting back -- Deng stepping

on the gas, accelerating toward the convoy like some hellish game of

"chicken"(reminiscent of Sam and Donnie's wild ride with the Drifter

in scene #29) --

-- and we watch as the headlights barrel towards us at full bore --

BULLETS POPPING across the windshield of the truck -- SAM AND

NINETEEN IN CONSTANT FIRE MODE -- THE SOUND DEAFENING -- headlights

blown out on both trucks and now we're plunged into total blackness -

- only the wild-strobe of machine gun fire lighting up the night as

these trucks slam towards each other -- and finally --

THE LRA CONVOY CAREENS OFF THE ROAD AND BOTTOMS OUT IN A DITCH

Deng skidding to a stop as Sam, Nineteen, and the third SPLA SOLDIER

pile out of the truck -- firing and advancing on the caravan by

foot.

EXT. DITCH - SIDE OF DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Rebels jumping out of their disabled trucks -- Sam and his men

flanking them -- blasting one of the trucks until the engine bursts

into flames -- cutting down the rebels before they even knew what

hit them. And then there's a great stillness. The quiet of death...

... Sam coming out of the blackness with his AK leveled... moving

toward the flaming wreckage of the caravan... Deng, Nineteen, and

Marco moving to each rebel body... making sure they're dead.

Sam and Deng moving to the back of the Transport Truck...

Marco hustling up with a spotlight -- Sam switching it on as Deng

rips the canvas back and we see --

TWENTY THREE CHILDREN IN THE BACK OF THIS TRANSPORT TRUCK

Boys and girls... none of them older than twelve... tied together

with rope... emaciated... terrified... in very bad shape.

The implication of this hitting Sam, his mind reeling, turning to

Nineteen...

Deng and Marco helping the children out... one-by-one... untying

them...

And now Nineteen pulls up in the SUV, lighting up the children.

And Sam moves to the first child in the group -- a little girl --

reaching out to her but she pulls back.

And slowly the little girl steps forward... and Sam gently unbuttons

her shirt and begins to examine her little body... turning her

around in the harsh light of the SUV's headlamps... and he finds

five infected gashes on her back... whip wounds... already turning

gangrene... and he gently pushes her toward Deng...

And Sam continues with the group... assessing each child's health...

tenderly running his hands over their broken, starved bodies...

somehow calculating which ones are worse off and pulling them out of

line...

... and he reaches the last child and we see that the SUV is now

PACKED with children... huddled into every available corner... 10

children in total. There's no more room.

Deng hesitating, knows the reaction he's going to get...

The children become hysterical, crying, running at Sam and grabbing

for him, begging to be taken.

Sam, Deng, and the others loading into the SUV... some of them

climbing onto the roof... the only available space... the remaining

children clamoring around the truck as it begins to pull away...

Deng yelling this to the children as they drive off...

... the faint cries of the children slowly fading as they speed into

the darkness.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAWN

A red sun breaking the horizon. It's ONE HOUR LATER and we see the

SUV blasting through the front gate of the compound and skidding to

a stop -- DOORS POPPING OPEN -- SOLDIERS JUMPING OFF THE ROOF --

Betty and the other camp women already pulling the children out of

the truck... ushering them into the infirmary...

Sam yelling at another soldier as he walks across the courtyard --

INT. TRUCK - DRIVING - MORNING

Two hours into this return trip and it's silent in this cab. Deng

checking a handheld GPS, clocking their position, and then they see

it -- through the windshield -- in the distance --

Rising in a thin column a half-mile away.

EXT. ROAD - DEEP IN SUDAN - DAY

The scene of the ambush the night before. Burned out pickup trucks

and dead LRA rebels strewn in the dirt. Sam's SUV arriving and he's

the first one out... whistling for the children but they're nowhere

to be seen.

And now we realize that the column of smoke isn't coming from the

bombed-out LRA trucks -- it's coming from behind them. Sam moving

around the back of the TRANSPORT TRUCK to see --

THIRTEEN LITTLE BODIES STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER

The children Sam left behind.

Burned alive by the LRA an hour earlier.

Sam just standing here, staring at this smoldering pile of children.

Starting to go someplace very dark. And as he puts it, most of him

died in the bush this morning too.

INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - NIGHT - (JUNE/2005)

And we see a line of American TRAVELERS waiting to be checked

through customs... BUSINESS MEN in their rumpled suits carrying

briefcases, PARENTS with their tired children returning from

vacation... and Sam standing in this line with his duffel bag,

somehow cut-off from the life all around him. And the CUSTOMS

OFFICER waves him forward... Sam handing him his passport...

And he looks up, studies Sam --

And we see Sam has no answer for him. This question beginning to

plague him like a festering sore.

EXT. PASSENGER PICK-UP - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - NIGHT

It's raining and we see Sam sitting on a bench waiting, staring o.s.

at a SKYCAB TROLLEY. Two men working through a pile of BLACK GOLF

BAGS, heaped on top of each other like bodies, tossing them one-by-

one into the back of the trolley...

He looking up as Donnie gets out of his car, smiling.

Donnie is strung out, but Sam is too deep in his own shit to see it.

INT. OFFICE - BANK - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY

A BANK MANAGER at a desk, in a gray suit, shaking his head.

REVERSE to see Sam sitting in a chair across from him, a manila

folder filled with his business papers sitting on his lap.

Sam opens a manilla folder and pulls out a photo of a truck for

sale.

Sam leans over the desk and sets another photograph down in front of

him -- and we see it's a gruesome photograph of a mutilated boy...

An employee approaches the bank manager with something to sign,

looks down at the photos. The Bank Manager becoming uncomfortable.

Sam pulls out another photograph and sets it in front of the Bank

Manager -- this one even more gruesome...

Bank Manager not looking at the photograph...

Bank Manager glancing at the photograph then looking away...

And he slams the desk with his open hand, taking us to...

INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - DAY

A/C on the fritz and it's blistering hot in here. 150 parishioners

in pews waving themselves with hand fans trying to stay cool. And we

see Sam at the pulpit in mid-sermon, shirt pitted and rolled up to

his elbows. The rage in this man is palpable.

The congregation whipped into a frenzy. A few of them jumping to

their feet, shouting praise...

INT. CAR - DRIVING - KAMPALA, UGANDA - DAY

And we see John Garang in the back of this car as it drives through

downtown Kampala.

INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - SAME

Sam becoming more possessed...

The congregation responding, "Amen!"

EXT. TARMAC - KAMPALA AIRPORT - DAY

EXT. TARMAC - KAMPALA AIRPORT - DAY

The helicopter lifting off the ground, ascending into the cloudless

sky until it's just a speck in the limitless blue...

INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY - (JULY/2005)

Paige and her girlfriend from her 7th grade class sit on the

landing. Donnie flips through a magazine, Lynn puts away laundry.

Chatter here about an upcoming formal...

And now we see Sam off from the group, absently watching the TV in

an adjoining room... and a NEWS REPORT begins... a PICTURE OF JOHN

GARANG flashing on the screen... Sam moving closer to the set so he

can hear --

Sam going completely still...

ARCHIVAL SHOTS OF GARANG.

Sam frozen, shocked... just staring at the TV as the newscast

switches to another story...

Sam looking up to find everybody staring at him.

Sam lost here for a moment...

Sam snapping, FLASHING WITH RAGE --

Quiet. Nobody moving. Completely still. And then...

Tears welling up in Paige's eyes, anger, hurt, wanting to lash out

at him somehow. And what she says next she's felt her whole life...

Donnie instinctively grabbing his arm, protective...

And Sam spins -- gets in his face -- eyes dark and threatening --

Sam and Donnie toe-to-toe and the threat of serious violence here.

Tension like a hair trigger.

Donnie standing here, hurt... looking to Lynn to make sure she's

alright and she nods for him to go... and he turns and walks out.

Paige bursting into tears and running out of the room.

INT. BAR - DAY

A crowded, noisy outlaw bar in Johnstown. We see Sam sitting at the

bar all alone, a shot of whisky and a bottle of beer in front of

him. Staring into a void.

Sam turns to find a burly looking BIKER standing next to him

smiling.

Sam nods.

Sam bristling...

The Biker smiles a nasty, malicious smile. His buddies moving next

to him now... and we see a quiet storm brewing in Sam...

A moment here --

Sam staring at the Biker with a look we've come to know -- and --

CRACKKKK! -- Sam HEAD-BUTTS the Biker's face and a sudden, violent

brawl breaks out -- Bikers swinging cue sticks -- Sam wading into

the crew -- swinging wild -- taking the Biker down and stomping on

his face -- bloody -- murderous -- and then --

EXT. JAIL - JOHNSTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

Sam released, coming out a door and we see Lynn's car parked in the

parking lot, engine idling.

EXT. JAIL - JOHNSTOWN / INT. LYNN'S CAR #2 - DAY

Lynn behind the wheel as Sam comes around the passenger door and

gets in. And the two of them just sit here for a long beat, until...

BEAT. Sam says nothing.

She looks to him and we see she has tears in her eyes...

INT. SHED - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT - (AUGUST/2005)

Sam sitting in a chair in the dark. And we hear his cell vibrating

on the desk. He picks it up and sees DONNIE'S name on the screen...

a moment here and then he sets the phone back down... doesn't answer

it... as we go...

INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - SAME

Donnie on a couch and he looks like hell... pale, gaunt face...

phone at his ear listening to RINGING and RINGING... and then the

sound of Sam's voice...

Donnie hesitating... doesn't hang-up... and we can feel how badly he

needs to talk to somebody...

Donnie smiling to himself, a fleeting memory, and then something

dark coming over him. And now we see another man here in this shitty

dope house, cooking up a spoon of black tar, juicing a needle.

Donnie watching him like a hawk...

EXT. WOODS - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAWN

Eastern White Pine wrapped in early morning fog. Hazy. Floating like

a dream. And then the sound of WOOD SPLINTERING... and we find Sam

alone in this vapor cutting logs with an axe. Sweating despite the

chill in the air...

... and then a voice from somewhere far off. Sam stopping, looking

into the haze as a figure materializes... coming toward him calling

his name... at first it looks like Donnie... but then we see it's

Lynn...

And when she reaches him her look tells us something terrible has

happened.

INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - DAY

DONNIE'S CORPSE lying in a casket...

Packed with mourners. And we hear a CHILDREN'S CHOIR singing a

plaintive hymnal... "My Jesus, I love thee"... and Donnie's mother

in the first pew, dressed in black, surrounded by a few other women

offering her comfort.

And now we see Sam moving up the steps to the platform... and the

choir softly finishes... and he looks out over the congregation...

not saying a word for a long beat... and then...

And Sam stops, unable to continue... just stares out at the

congregation... at the expectant faces looking back at him,

waiting...

... but he steps away from the lectern, down the steps, and walks up

the aisle toward the exit... the congregation staring at him as he

passes...

INT. LYNN'S CAR #2/CHILDERS DRIVEWAY - DRIVING - DAY

Hours later. Lynn and Paige still dressed from the funeral, driving

up the driveway to their house.

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see a FLATBED TRUCK parked next to the

house and 7 or 8 MOVERS pulling heavy machinery out of the barn.

EXT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY

Lynn getting out of the car, approaching some of the men...

And she makes her way into...

INT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY

Filled with movers busily hauling equipment out of the garage. Lynn

coming in, confused...

And now she sees Sam going through a cabinet in the back.

Sam slamming the cabinet closed, moving past her without saying a

word. Lynn grabbing his arm, stopping him.

He walks off...

And she sees two men start to dismantle the "Childers Construction

Company" sign that she painted herself years ago --

EXT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY

Sam moving toward the house. Lynn comes out of the barn after him...

But he's not stopping. He reaches the house...

INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE - DAY

... Sam coming inside, moving to the kitchen... Lynn following him.

Sam grabs papers from the counter and hands them to Lynn. She

quickly pages through them, can't believe what she's reading.

Sam finds the Keys.

Lynn follows Sam into the office.

Sam starts to spin the combination but hesitates...

She moves past him, spinning the combination and cranking open the

vault. Sam grabbing a couple stacks of cash.

And he looks to her...

Sam standing here, weighing something in his mind. A choice he must

make here... and finally he moves past her...

But he's gone.

EXT. KAMPALA AIRPORT - DAY

And we see Sam moving across this crowded tarmac. Disconnected. A

bit frightening. And he's greeted by Deng.

But Sam says nothing, and Deng sees that his eyes are deserted.

Inevitable. And Sam moves past him without saying a word.

INT. MESS HALL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

30 or 40 adults and children here eating the last meal of the day.

And we see Sam in a corner, off from the rest of the group. And

maybe it's just the lighting in here, but there's a darkness around

him -- literally as if the space surrounding this man is devoid of

light.

And we see William working his way through the room... refilling

cups with hot tea... his particular job here... and he comes up to

Sam and accidently sloshes some of the tea onto Sam's arm and he

flinches! -- burned -- "Damn it!" -- shoots his arm out and

accidentally hits William in the chest -- knocking him backward onto

the ground.

The entire room falls silent. Nobody moving.

And Sam gets up and walks out of the room.

INT./EXT. TRUCK/RURAL ROAD - SUDAN - DAY

A convoy of 2 OR 3 AID RELIEF TRUCKS coming down this dirt road. And

we see Agnete here with a DRIVER in the first truck as they drive

onto a NARROW BRIDGE -- and just before they reach the other side --

A PICKUP TRUCK filled with heavily armed LRA REBELS pulls in front

of them, cutting them off.

The truck grinding to a halt. The driver becoming terrified, trying

to jam the truck into reverse --

Agnete climbing out of the truck as we go --

EXT. NARROW BRIDGE - SUDAN - DAY

Rebels jumping out of the pickup truck and moving up the bridge as

Agnete approaches -- holding up her hands --

Agnete and the LRA LEADER meet in the middle of the bridge --

And suddenly the LRA LEADER slams her in the gut with the butt of

his rifle and she collapses. The other Rebels swarm all over the

convoy, pulling out AID WORKERS and DRIVERS, forcing them onto their

knees in a group.

Everyone terrified -- some of them sobbing -- Agnete looking up,

trying to talk to the LRA LEADER--

-- and he SLAMS her in the face with the butt of his rifle and she

goes down hard... and he rests the barrel of his rifle on the back

of her head... he's going to shoot her -- and --

KAK! KAK! KAK!

His chest EXPLODES! -- three bursts from behind -- the other rebels

spinning toward the gunshots as --

KRATAKRATAKRATAKRAK!!!

A firestorm of lead -- Sam, Deng, and the rest of his team coming

onto the bridge shooting -- rebels scrambling for cover but it's too

late -- dropping as they try and sprint away -- and in an instant

it's all over.

Agnete sees Sam, rushes toward him, but when he looks at her she

freezes. He is completely unrecognizable to her in this moment -- a

killer's thousand-yard stare -- barely human -- more like a machine

than a man.

And he moves past her down the bridge, to the LRA LEADER on the

ground who is still alive. And he puts the barrel of his rifle

against the rebel's head and...

BOOOOM!

He's dead. Just like that. And he continues walking up the bridge.

And we see Agnete, Deng and the other soldiers having just witnessed

this.

INT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

William coming in quietly, moving next to one of the captured Rebels

from the previous scene who is shackled to a bed, injured. Two SPLA

soldiers here standing guard.

William pulls out the photograph of his brother, holds it up...

The Rebel looks at the photograph but says nothing, just shakes his

head... and he looks off, his thousand yard stare inscrutable...

And William simply folds the photograph back up and slips it into

his pocket... but he doesn't leave... he sits here a moment

longer... quietly... thinking... and then...

The Rebel hears this and turns to him... and nods his head...

And we see something happening in this hardened rebel... his eyes

filling with a distant memory... a sadness... and slowly he nods his

head again.

And we stay here with these two lost souls sitting next to each

other... silent... connected by a shared history and anguish.

EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER

Sam sitting alone, lost to the world around him. Deng approaches.

Neither one acknowledging the other for a long beat until...

Sam, no response.

And Sam turns away. After a beat Deng walks off, leaving him alone

once again.

INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

And we see Sam here in the dark... moonlight filtering in through

the thatched roof... like shards of glass cutting through the

blackness... and he doesn't look right here... soul worn thin...

eyes hollow... starting to go someplace very bad...

... IMAGES FLASHING IN HIS HEAD... babies burned and screaming...

Donnie in his coffin... and we realize we're watching something

here... his world starting to cave in on him...

... and he drops against his cot... distraught... tears in his eyes

and this man is breaking... and suddenly we see a gun in his hand...

finger curling around the trigger as he puts it to his head... eyes

closing against the world... and...

WE HEAR A KNOCK AT HIS DOOR

Sam frozen... still holding the gun... and slowly the door pushes

open and we hear soft footsteps shuffling into this dark room...

... and William steps into the light, sees Sam here on the ground

with the gun in his hand... and slowly he moves next to him, sitting

on the cot without saying a word... just the two of them here for a

moment... and then slowly he begins in perfect English...

Sam looking to William... this small boy sitting above him...

telling his story...

And William pauses in his story... lost in this memory... his face

becoming a mask of pain... but no tears... there are no more tears

in this young man left to be shed... and so he continues...

And now William looks down at Sam... staring at this man on the

ground... and he reaches out and gently touches Sam's head... a

moment of tenderness for both of them... an act of love.... these

two broken souls finding each another here... and William says...

And Sam sets the gun down and reaches out to William, pulls him into

an embrace... holding him close... and we know that without a doubt

this boy has saved this man's life.

INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY- CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT

Soft Christian music is playing on the radio. Lynn folding clothes

in the laundry room when the phone rings. Paige comes into the

upstairs hallway and answers it.

INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

Sam on his sat phone --

INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT

And there's a long pause... so much to say but no words to say it...

each of them holding their phones to their ears and just

listening... and finally Sam says...

And we see tears well up in Paige's eyes when she hears this... and

now we see Lynn coming around the corner, overhearing them as they

begin their little game one more time...

Sam smiling to himself... and we realize this man is coming back to

life when he says...

Lynn hearing this and tears roll down her cheeks as we go...

EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - NEXT DAY

And we see the soldiers at their posts... Betty and the other Camp

Women cleaning clothes and preparing food... and we see most of the

children loitering around a tree in the shade, sullen, not playing

on the playground.

And then we see Sam coming into the courtyard kicking a soccer

ball... some of the children see him and point... and slowly the

entire camp begins to notice Sam kicking the soccer ball awkwardly

by himself out in the open... Betty and the other women stopping

their chores and watching him, speaking to one another in Arabic...

Deng and the other soldiers staring as Sam pops the ball into the

air and bounces it off his head...

... and now a couple of the smaller kids sprint for him and he kicks

them the ball... and slowly the rest of the children join in the

fun... kicking the ball back and forth... an impromptu soccer

game... and then we hear LAUGHTER again... joy flooding back into

this place.

Deng watching with a big smile as this white man dances around these

little children... a Pied Piper of joy... playing in the dirt.

EXT. FRONT GATE - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER

And we see William approach a knot of soldiers standing by the front

gate smoking cigarettes...

Soldiers nodding their heads "yes."

And the soldiers turn their backs on William and he slinks away.

EXT. RIVERBANK - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY

We see a line of women along the riverbank in their colorful

dresses... scrubbing pans and washing clothes... singing an ancient

African spiritual as they work... the sun dropping pale red on the

horizon...

And we see Sam here too... alone with himself... sitting at the

river's edge, watching the water rolling gently past... listening to

the soft serenade of the women... the beauty of it all...

... and then he gets up and walks into the river... and he kneels

down so that water reaches his waist (reminiscent of his first

baptism in scene #35)... and now the women on the riverbank stop

their work, watching him as he closes his eyes and gently leans

back... submitting to the water... and when he comes up again we see

in his eyes that his soul has been saved in this simple act.

And the women begin to shout their praise from the riverbank as we

go...

INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAY

And we see William here alone, pulling out a small satchel...

filling it with a bottle of water and a blanket...

EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - DAY

William at the edge of the compound... looking over his shoulder to

make sure nobody is watching him... and then quickly slipping under

the fence and he's gone...

EXT. BUSH - DUSK

William walking through the dry scrub alone... already a couple

miles deep in the bush... the sun starting to set... light waning...

William starting to get nervous, picking up his pace...

AND THEN THE SOUND OF MEN

A squad of LRA rebels coming through the scrub... William hiding

under a bush, terrified... the men coming closer... no idea if they

saw him or not... his mind racing... voices getting louder...

starting to hyper-ventilate from the fear -- and --

Sprinting through the bush -- running for his life -- rebels see him

-- yelling for him to stop -- chasing him down -- shooting their

rifles into the air and he hits the ground in the fetal position --

too terrified to continue -- eyes clamped shut as 4 or 5 rebels

surround him -- guns pointed at his head -- caught.

INT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DUSK

Sam coming into the building, finding Betty tending to a sick child.

Betty shaking her head "no", and we see the worry on Sam's face...

intuitively knows something is wrong.

INT. LRA TRUCK - DRIVING - DUSK

William bound and gagged being dragged through the bush by 5 or 6

rebels... and one of the rebels sees him staring at them and he

brings the butt of his Kalishnikov down hard -- striking William on

the head as we go --

EXT. OFFICE - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DUSK

Deng coming up to Sam...

Sam closing his eyes, knows instantly what William has done.

EXT. LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - NIGHT

William shoved through the bush... moving deeper into this rebel

encampment... dark and otherworldly... figures moving around camp

fires... laughing... men with little girls... their child wives...

with pregnant bellies... and incongruously the sound of American rap

music coming from a jambox somewhere.

The overriding sense we get from this place is one of `insanity.'

And William is dragged to a clearing next to a grouping of tents and

he's kicked to the dirt... two other soldiers pinning him to the

ground as a third grabs his feet and pulls off his shoes... William

YELLING and now a handful of other LRA soldiers start to gather

around... most of them only a few years older than him... watching

as his ankles are bound together and placed on a wooden block...

... and now another soldier steps forward with an AXE... and the

crowd whips into bloodlust... shouting... cheering...

AND THE SOLDIER LIFTS THE AXE INTO THE AIR --

WILLIAM WRITHING ON THE GROUND BUT CAN'T GET FREE --

AND THE SOLDIER STARTS TO BRING THE BLADE DOWN -- AND --

The soldier freezes -- everyone turning as an LRA COMMANDER comes

through the crowd -- takes the axe from the soldier --

EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - NIGHT

Deng hustling up to Sam... shaking his head...

EXT. LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - NIGHT

And we see William in a bamboo cell in the center of camp... and we

see other children here... in various stages of fear and

suffering... some of them completely naked... shivering in the cool

air... others catatonic, probably doped up or too battered to move.

INT. SUV - DRIVING - NIGHT

Sam, Deng, Nineteen and Marco in this lead truck... been out here

for hours... behind them we see the second camp truck following...

And they come to a fork in the road, pulling to a stop.

Sam looking at a topo map on his lap...

EXT. LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAWN

Pale yellow sun breaking and we see William and a line of 10 or 12

other children -- shackled in iron -- being loaded into the back of

a TRANSPORT TRUCK.

INT. SUV - DAWN

Both SUV's parked off the side of the road now. Sam and Deng here,

looking at maps and the GPS tracker. And we hear Deng's radio

squawk. He digs it out, responds in Arabic, then turns to Sam...

INT./EXT. - LRA CONVOY/BUSH - DEEP IN SUDAN - DAY

A convoy of 4 or 5 LRA trucks barreling down this dirt track. And we

see lots of rebels standing up in the back of these trucks, cradling

heavy weapons, alert -- and suddenly we see in the distance --

TWO ROOSTER-TAILS OF DUST COMING AT US

From different angles -- converging on the LRA convoy -- the Rebels

see them and point -- they know what's coming and they begin to

prepare for war --

Getting closer -- and then we see them --

SAM'S TWO TRUCKS

Bouncing over the terrain towards us -- coming fast -- and then --

WOOOOSH!

An RPG streaks toward the lead LRA truck and -- KABOOOM! -- the

truck is blown off it's axles -- the other LRA trucks pulling off

the road -- and suddenly we're in a withering firefight -- the roar

of heavy weapons at full-tilt.

SAM AND HIS MEN

Jumping out of their trucks and flanking the LRA convoy --

triangulating fire -- shredding the rebels -- blowing them back off

their feet.

Sprinting through the bush -- edging around the LRA trucks --

finding a position on their weak side and locking an RPG into a

launcher -- shouldering it -- aiming -- WOOOOSH! -- the missile

streaking toward the second LRA jeep and --

KABOOOM!

It's blasted into the air -- onto it's side -- rebels scurrying away

from the wreckage -- still firing -- an absolute hail of lead --

AK's barking in every direction --

KRATAKRATAKRATAKRATAKRAKKK!

One of the rebels standing up -- firing an RPG -- WOOOOOSH!

MARCO crouched behind the new orphanage truck firing -- sees the

white streak coming at him -- dives -- just as --

THE TRUCK IS EVISCERATED IN THE BLAST!

SAM moving closer to the rebels -- shooting -- picking them off one

by one -- gunfire raking over his head -- a dozen muzzle flashes

coming from everywhere -- Sam yelling over the thunder --

And we see Deng coming out of the bush to his right -- and then

Nineteen to his left -- and they charge on the remaining rebels --

Sam providing covering fire -- a curtain of lead cutting through the

enemy -- and just like that it's over -- Sam waving behind him --

-- and suddenly there's just a sick silence -- smoke rising from the

shot-to-shit LRA trucks -- bodies strewn in the dirt -- the brand

new orphanage truck bombed out and smoking on it's side.

And Sam makes his way to the first TRANSPORT TRUCK -- Deng covering

him as he rips the canvas back to see --

50 CHILDREN CRAMMED INTO THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK

Soldiers start to unload the children --

Sam moves to the second TRANSPORT TRUCK, rips the canvas back to

50 MORE CHILDREN SHACKLED IN THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK

Holy fuck indeed.

He's been here before... 100 kids and he only has one good

vehicle... and we watch him standing here... staring at these tiny

faces looking back at him... a moment... lost in indecision until

one of the kids stands up near the back...

Sam sees him and suddenly he knows exactly what he needs to do...

And we've seen this before... Sam going through these children...

assessing their health... one by one... separating the worse off

from the others... forming two group... turning to Deng and Nineteen

and motioning to the smaller group (about 15 children)...

Deng herding the children toward the one good truck...

Sam and Marco moving from one dead LRA rebel to the other... rolling

them onto their backs... going through their belts... pulling out

extra ammo clips and grenades...

Marco swinging four or five machine guns onto his shoulder...

At the SUV, now jammed with children. Sam talking to Nineteen, Marco

and the others...

Sam turns to see Deng next to him, holding an AK in his hands, a

steely resolve in his eyes. Sam nods, emboldened by his support.

The soldiers load onto the SUV and drive off, leaving Sam and Deng

standing here in the middle of these 85 children.

Waiting for the war that will surely come.

INT. SUV - DRIVING - DAY

And we stay in this truck as it pulls away... driving for a long

time... until Sam, Deng, and the children become only specks on the

horizon... and then...

WHITE LETTERS ON A BLACK SCREEN THAT READ --

Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army continue their reign of

terror in Sudan and Northern Uganda.

Amnesty International estimates that Kony and the LRA are

responsible for over 400,000 murders and more than 40,000 child

abductions. These children are tortured, raped, sold into sex

slavery, and forced to take part in ritualized killing by LRA

commanders.

The Islamic Government of Sudan continues to provide weapons and

safe haven to Kony and the LRA as part of a deal to wage a proxy war

against the predominately Christian South.

Without pressure from the United States, this support will continue

and more innocent children will be slaughtered.

Now you know.

As of 2011, Sam Childers has rescued over 800 children from the LRA.

His `Angels of East Africa Orphanage' is home to more than 300

orphans, and feeds over 1200 meals a day to neighboring villagers in

need.
