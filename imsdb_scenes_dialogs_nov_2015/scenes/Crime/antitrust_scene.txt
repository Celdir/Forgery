ON A BLACK SCREEN

it says: "The coolest thing?"

We hear a (famous) Seattle alternative band.

EXT. OUTPOST CAMPUS - DAY (BEGIN MAIN TITLES)

Quick cuts, seductive angles: 70 hot-air balloons rise over

a vast, green corporate campus. Their mylar skins are

imprinted with Outpost '98 logos; their gondolas are dressed

in Outpost-colored bunting.

18,000 Outpost employees cheer. They're spread out over

rolling lawns, amid Arabian tents and costumed Acrobats.

Over the balloon-dotted sky, the graphic re-appears: "The

coolest thing?"

INT. OUTPOST OFFICE - DAY (CONTINUE TITLES & MUSIC)

A Programmer sits in his handsome office, forested landscape

out the window. The screen says: DARYL, M.I.T. '95

JUMP CUTS of tall refrigerators: Snapples, Cokes, Fruitopias,

Zaps, Jolts, Barques & Sprites are lined-up behind glass

doors. "The coolest thing?"

INT. OUTPOST CAMPUS - DAY (CONTINUE TITLES & MUSIC)

A 24-year-old Korean-American Girl sits at the edge of a

plashing, post-modern fountain. DIANA, STANFORD '97

MONTAGE of world capitals & remote places: Stockbrokers &

Farmers, News Anchors & Students, CEO's & Eskimos boot-up

Outpost '98, or log-on with Outpost Internet Traveler.

Over the last shot (a Ghetto Kid uses Outpost Word in the

library): "The coolest thing?"

EXT. COFFEE HOUSE/TERRACE - DAY (CONTINUE TITLES & MUSIC)

A Programmer sits with two colleagues, drinking lattes at

the edge of Lake Washington. MITCH, BERKELEY, '98

MONTAGE: Programmers play competitive games at an Outpost

picnic; Toddlers play on computers in an Outpost Day Care

Center; Geeks confer at a diagram-covered whiteboard;

Employees listen/dance to the Seattle band we've been hearing,

on-stage, at the Outpost '98 launch.

BACK TO SCENE: COFFEE HOUSE/TERRACE (CONTINUE TITLES)

One of Mitch's colleagues is nodding. DONNY, HARVARD, '97

Donny didn't mean to sound so mushy. Nobody knows where to

look for a second.

As they laugh: "The coolest thing?"

MONTAGE of magazine covers (Newsweek, Vanity Fair, WIRED)

featuring Gary Boyd. They say, eg: "Who Owns Cyberspace?" On

a Time cover, he's composited by the Capitol Dome: "ROBBER

BARON OR VISIONARY? Outpost's Antitrust Woes"

GARY (early 40's) reads a statement before a Congressional

Sub-Committee. His voice is pleasant but firm:

A bloated Senator looks hostile.

As we watch, CAMERA pulls back from the screen on which the

movie is being projected. REVERSE INTO:

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - EVENING (END MAIN TITLES)

Over an audience of 40 or so computer students we read:

STANFORD UNIVERSITY

We pick out MILO CONNOR, watching keenly. He's 21: clear-

eyed, alive, innocent. He sits with his best friend, TEDDY

CHIN, third-generation Chinese-American.

Some appreciative laughter in the auditorium. But behind

Milo, LARRY LINDHOLM squirms in his seat. He whispers:

BRIAN BISSEL, in front of Milo, twists in his seat:

Larry gets up.

Two Outpost Recruiters, REDMOND PRICE, 31 (gray suit) and

DANNY BAYLOR, 29 (Outpost '98 golf shirt) note the walkout.

Danny scans headshots in a Stanford Yearbook. (On-screen

behind them we see Seattle: night streets wet-down &

shimmering; Young People entering a club; Young People

climbing Mt. Shasta.) Finding Larry's picture, Danny points

out the name to Redmond, who shrugs: unconcerned.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

The double-doors swing open (over them, a plate reads: THE

HEWLITT-PACKARD AUDITORIUM) and Larry comes out.

UP THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

ALICE POULSON, a very pretty girl of 21 (more hiply dressed

than the geeks) searches the hall, reading the names over

the doors (NEC Communications Classroom, Toshiba Computer

Lab, Mitsubishi Classroom). She spots Larry.

EXT. STANFORD COMPUTER SCIENCE BLDG. - A MOMENT LATER

Tilting down the neo-classical edifice, we read the name

etched over the entrance: WILLIAM GATES COMPUTER SCIENCE

BUILDING. We find Larry and Alice sitting on the steps.

As we hear Larry speak, we cut back into:

THE AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

The lights are on. Milo & Teddy stand by a table dressed in

Outpost bunting, laden with refreshments & giveaways:

mousepads, T-shirts, caps & books with the Outpost logo on

them (a simple contour drawing of a frontier outpost). While

most Students chat earnestly with Recruiters, Milo & Teddy

load their plates with pizza and tortilla chips.

Milo puts some brownies on his plate.

Spotting a book on the table, Milo picks it up.

EXT. GATES BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

Larry looks at her: you didn't answer my question.

THE AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

Milo and Teddy discuss the book almost joyfully. (We see a

page of code: utterly indecipherable.)

EXT. GATES BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

Brian, already wearing one of the Outpost caps, effuses to

Redmond.

Across the room, Milo (eating chips, perusing code) reaches

for a napkin but unwittingly grabs some bunting. It unravels

in a long TP-like streamer -- just as Danny approaches,

peering at Milo's ID tag.

He tries to sluff the paper off his hand; Danny holds out a

cell phone.

Milo and Teddy look at each other: right. But Danny looks

like he means it. Milo's grin fades. He takes the phone.

Danny holds out two plane tickets, in 1st class folders.

INT. UNIVERSITY AVENUE DINER (PALO ALTO) - NIGHT

Alice examines one of the tickets almost suspiciously.

Larry, Teddy & Brian are at the table with Alice & Milo.

It's a student hang-out, with loud music.

As Alice predicted, Milo is pleased by Larry's remark.

"Empowered." Larry smiles conspiratorially at Alice.

INT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

In a tidy, playfully decorated room, Alice stirs in bed,

sees the space next to her is vacant.

TINY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo sits at a desk, thinking, agitated, in the dim light of

a PC. He looks up, sees Alice in the doorway.

She picks her way through geek clutter (motherboards, code

manuals, Coke cans) sits next to him.

He looks at her: you've gotta be kidding.

He doesn't deny it: she sees right through him.

INT. 737 - FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY

In the cabin, everybody types on a notebook but Milo. He

looks out the window expectantly: at the Seattle skyline.

INT. SEA-TAC AIRPORT - GATE 13 - DAY

Milo comes off the plane. Danny and Redmond greet him.

INT/EXT. HIGHWAY/CAR - DAY

Redmond drives his black Lexus 85 m.p.h. Danny leans forward

from the backseat.

Milo almost blushes. He makes an awkward segue.

EXT. GARY BOYD'S COMPOUND - LAKE WASHINGTON - DAY

Beyond a rocky beach, buildings are cunningly carved into a

wooded hillside. Glass walls are framed in rich wood. The

main house is 28,000 sq. ft. Then there's the guest house,

pool building, reception hall, library...

EXT. GATEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Redmond pulls up. A discreet Guard in a Mr. Rogers cardigan

recognizes him. The gates swing open.

EXT. BOYD HOUSE - DAY

They pull up by a Lexus SUV with a baby seat. Another Man in

a cardigan stands in the open front door.

Milo just sits there, eyeing the monumental residence.

INT. BOYD MANSION - DEN-LIKE ROOM - DAY

Milo and the Houseman cross a long room with a lake view. We

hear music by Satie. The Craftsman furniture and lamps are

custom-made. A Cezanne hangs on the wall.

ANOTHER DEN-LIKE ROOM WITH A VIEW

There's a Craftsman crib here, stuffed animals, another

Cezanne. Even the toys seem arranged. They enter an

ANTEROOM/CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo sits on a bench. He tries not to look, but his childhood

hero is partly visible through a glass panel in the door:

Gary (in a suit and tie) has an open American face. But

something goes on behind his pleasant features and self-

possessed mien: his desire (or need) to solve the problem at

hand is so intense it makes him appear vexed -- even

vulnerable.

CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

As Gary concentrates, two Outpost Senior Managers speak:

PHIL TATE, 40 (bald); and RANDY GRIMES, 36, (gray eyes).

ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

Gary speaks with precise hand gestures: settling the matter.

Phil and Randy gather their papers, and stand. They exit,

nodding at Milo as they pass. Then Gary comes out.

Milo is a little dazzled as they shake hands: such a fam-

iliar face, such a big figure in his young life.

INT. DEN-LIKE ROOM - MOVING

Now New Age music plays. They move back through the same

room, but the Cezanne has been replaced by a Hieronymus Bosch

(bodies roiling in Hell). Milo is -- puzzled.

NEXT ROOM - STILL MOVING

As they walk, Milo watches a Cezanne "original" digitally re-

configure to a Bosch, brushstrokes and all.

He opens a glass-doored refrigerator, scans a shelf with

rows of Snapples -- in alphabetical order.

He selects a Kiwi-Raspberry, they walk on.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM (LAKE VIEW) - MOMENTS LATER

They enter. An entire wall is taken-up by a Bosch triptych.

As Gary crosses to the other side of the room, Milo stands

by a table covered in art books -- hundreds of them (Soutine,

Chinoiserie, Roy Lichtenstein...)

Gary heads back, carrying something spherical.

Glancing down at the daunting display of books, Gary looks

vaguely afflicted. He mutters:

Looking up now (and much more at ease) he holds up a shiny,

detailed metal object: model satellite.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - LATER

Milo and Gary peer at a monitor, side-by-side. Milo sips his

own Snapple now. Gary speaks his language.

Milo has a deer-in-the-headlights look.

INT. GARY'S HOUSE - ANOTHER ROOM - DUSK

As they walk, Milo chides himself for his reticence. Gary

seems to read his mind.

Milo's amazed by Gary's acuity. And his candor.

They have come to a stop in a windowed entryway. Milo watches

Gary keenly. Gary nods. He knits his brow.

EXT. CUPERTINO HILLS (SILICON VALLEY) - NIGHT

A block of floodlit "tract mansions," Taco Bell palaces of

the Valley's newly rich. Milo & Alice cross a vacant lot to

where the lights twinkle below. Their '89 Honda Civic is

parked nearby. Milo is excited.

He's sweet. She kisses him. He holds onto her.

He'd hate to think that's true. But he manages a smile.

EXT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The Honda is loaded with luggage and boxes, some of which

are tied to the roof. Milo & Alice stow a final piece.

As they head back in, they see a Toyota park at the curb.

She continues inside. He waits, watches Teddy cross the

sidewalk to join him.

A brown Buick parks behind Teddy's car. As they speak, a

rumpled, 50ish MAN in an off-the-rack suit gets out.

Milo grins, he high-fives Teddy.

They embrace. It's awkward, but it's heartfelt.

INT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

Milo enters, reading Teddy's phone number.

The rumpled Man sits on a radiator, watching CNN on a TV,

the last remaining piece of furniture. Alice enters, holding

a jam jar filled water, hands Milo a business card.

Milo reads the card: Lyle Barton, Asst. Prosecutor, DOJ,

Seattle Branch Office. Milo's a little spooked.

Milo tries to give back the card.

And he goes.

She kisses him. They head out. We linger. On TV a graphic

says: SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA: MASS SUICIDE - LIVE. Emergency

Medical Personnel roll gurneys with bodies out of a new

Mediterranean mansion. Footage shows bodies (including a few

children) on bunkbeds, uniformly shod in black Nikes.

EXT. OUTPOST CORPORATE CAMPUS - DAY

Crane past identical, low, steel & glass buildings, amid the

vast lawns & fir trees... Past a building under

construction... To find Redmond's Lexus, cruising.

INT./EXT. REDMOND'S CAR/CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS

Milo looks out the window, Redmond gives the tour:

The Day Care is a Michael Graves-looking building with a big

cartoon-dog sculpture on its roof, ears cocked to the sky. A

Teacher leads her little charges inside.

Two Men in suits, with briefcases, (conspicuous amid the

Geeks in jeans and T-shirts) enter Building #19.

The car pulls into a lot full of Miatas, BMW's, Boxters.

CLOSE ON - THE OUTPOST LOGO

THEN TILT UP TO SHOW:

EXT. BUILDING 20 QUAD - DAY

The logo is of inlaid stone. Redmond & Milo walk over it.

Milo carries a box with some personal effects, including a

small painting. Redmond wears a photo I.D. tag.

INT. BLDG. 20 LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

At the desk, a RECEPTIONIST looks up, stands to hang a

temporary ID pass around Milo's neck.

Milo smiles. Redmond uses his magnetic swipe card on an inner

door (a security cam is at every door); he holds the door

open for Milo.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They walk up a long carpeted hallway, past open offices where

Geeks (mostly males under 30) sit at workstations.

They pass a room in which Geeks play video games. Just outside

it, a chubby programmer, DESI, sips a Diet Coke.

He bows deep, with mock-obeisance. Milo blushes, Redmond

laughs, he snags Milo's elbow. They walk again, passing a

service hall with a Civil Defense sign.

ANOTHER HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

Up the hall, a young woman (LISA) is about to go into her

office. She pauses half a second, looks at Milo, goes in.

She's beautiful.

As they pass her office, they look in: she's already at her

workstation, studiously avoiding their gaze.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - MOMENT LATER

A handsome, modest office like all the others: workstation,

whiteboard, window. They enter.

Milo puts down his box, picks up the book: The Next Highway

(Gary by a highway on its cover). As we look at it:

INT. OFFICE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY - LATER

In an office with a bank of monitors that play feeds from

security cameras, BOB SHROT, 40, Head of Physical Security,

issues Milo his swipe card. Redmond watches.

He drags the card through a sample slot, producing an

unbelievably loud, piercing EEEEEEEE. He shouts over it:

INT. HALLWAY - LATER

EXT. BUILDING 20/PARKING LOT - DAY

As they walk, Milo watches two Hardhats roll a spool of fiber-

optic cable into the building under construction.

They approach a 1990 Deux Chevaux, cheap but charming.

INT. BLDG. 20 CAFETERIA - DAY

Blond wood, smoked glass -- a room as sleek as the Geeks who

lunch here are nerdy. Milo and Redmond push trays.

Lisa's at a table, looking at Milo. When their eyes meet,

she busies herself, placing the plates back on her tray.

Lisa passes behind them, smiles fleetingly at Milo. At a

table, Randy and Phil note the "interaction." Meantime:

He laughs.

INT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lisa moves swiftly up the hall. She looks up it and down it

(making sure no one's looking) before ducking into

MILO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

She goes to the box on Milo's desk (his personal effects) --

starts rooting through it.

INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

Redmond and Milo have eaten; Redmond stacks their plates.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - LATER

Milo has fed the old Skywire disks into his machine. He reads

a complicated screen.

Milo looks up. It's Gary. Milo is thrilled.

Milo's smile deepens. Gary notices the small painting (by

Alice) hanging on the wall. He stares at it.

Milo colors as Gary drags a second chair in front of the

screen; didn't realize he was contradicting Mrs. Boyd.

Milo smiles as Gary sits down, studies the screen.

Milo can't quite get over: Gary's his counselor.

EXT. QUAD - OUTSIDE MILO'S OFFICE - LATER

Two awe-struck Geeks see Gary through the window.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

MILO SCROLLS THE SCREEN:

INT. EMPTY HOUSE - EVENING

We're in an old (empty) Craftsman house. Through a front

window, we see Alice lead Milo up a path. As they enter:

Milo's grinning as he takes in the house.

THE BEDROOM - MOMENT LATER

Windows give onto a garden with a small studio. Milo's still

beaming, Alice is pleased. Till he says:

She gestures at what she hopes will be their home.

She pulls him back into the kiss.

MONTAGE W/ MUSIC

1.) MILO types intently in his office.

2.) GARY sits with MILO at his desk, discussing code. Pan to

the window; we see a different pair of awed Geeks.

3.) Milo & Alice read in bed. He's reading Gary's book.

4.) MILO shows GARY one of his early programs, written on

1.0.: it's simple-looking, with some childish writing scrawled

on it. Gary seems touched.

INT. OUTPOST CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Two DOJ AGENTS depose Gary. (A video-cam records his answers.)

Two Outpost LAWYERS sit next to him. One of the Agents is

reading from a document:

Gary studies his copy of the E-mail. He looks vexed.

The Agent shifts in his seat. We get an idea of Gary's

negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonable,

while offering nothing).

The Agents confer. Gary sees Phil, looming outside the open

door. One of the Agents sees him, too. He doesn't try to

hide his annoyance:

INT. AN OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

Gary takes a manila envelope from Phil, opens it.

Gary reads the page from the envelope: computer code.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY

Milo stares at his screen, frustrated. Gary enters.

Catching himself, Gary trails off. He sits down, exhales.

Gary seems sincerely contrite. (He needn't be: Milo just

wants to please him. Besides: Milo sees he'd like to stop

obsessing about convergence, to be a "worldly zillionaire,"

engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be more

engrossing than Skywire?)

Reading the page Gary got from Phil, Milo knits his brow.

INT. LISA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

PAN OFF a TV, where local news footage shows a mangled,

smoking BMW, post-wreck, on a lonely nocturnal highway.

Lisa watches the news report, knowingly.

INT. BUILDING 20 HALLWAY - DAY

Lisa heads up the hall, carrying a CD-ROM.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY

Milo's typing.

He looks. He stands.

This seems to jolt her. She pales a little. What a mysterious

girl. But this only adds to her allure.

This strikes a deep chord with Milo, all of it.

They're looking at each other: he gets self-conscious.

They sit. As she inserts the disk, he finds himself looking

at her. On the screen, the frontier outpost we know as the

logo appears. It's struck by a bolt from the sky. The outpost

comes alive with light, music, movie-images through its

windows, a ringing phone. Finally, the word SKYWIRE burns

into it. It's neat, she's really good.

Simultaneously, they reach for the mouse. Their hands touch.

They look at each other. Something happened.

She nods, manipulates the mouse. He stares at the screen

strenuously, fighting the impulse to stare at Lisa.

INT. ANTEROOM - GARY'S OFFICE

Gary's SECRETARY types as Milo enters. She smiles at him.

INT. GARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Gary's face is red. The two Lawyers who sat in on his

deposition are with him again.

Gary has used the phrase before, but the pretense of

ingenuousness is gone; it's witheringly condescending.

ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo hears Gary yelling behind the closed door. It's

indecipherable, but we discern an enraged "bullshit!" Milo

flips through a copy of Wired, trying to ignore it. The

Lawyers come out, passing swiftly, rather grimly.

INT. GARY'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

Agitated, Gary rather compulsively lines-up the papers, pens,

etc. on his desk; he barely hears the knock at the open

doorframe.

Still distracted, he finds a page of code on his desk, gives

it to Milo. Once again, Milo marvels.

Their eyes are locked. Gary blinks, sags into his chair.

Milo just wants to get out. He studies the code to hide his

discomfort. Gary watches him.

He smiles. For the first time it looks forced.

INT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A youthfully upscale place, a converted red-brick warehouse.

Alice looks great. The Waiter pours wine.

Milo smiles (again it looks forced) raises his glass.

She just looks at him. He grows a little defensive:

A Busboy leaves a basket of rolls. Glum, preoccupied, Milo

takes one without looking, brings it to his lips --

He looks at Alice, looks at the roll, blanches.

He throws the roll back into the basket.

We see the rolls: covered in seeds.

He smiles. But his heart's not in it. She hates to see him

suffer. She picks up her glass.

EXT. TERRACE OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - DAY

Milo sits alone, marking up pages of code as he eats. He

doesn't notice Lisa, standing with her tray.

He indicates she should sit.

She smiles charmingly to cover whatever she's feeling. The

more enigmatic she is, the more intrigued he is.

EXT. BLDG. 20 QUAD - DAY

Milo and Lisa walk, eat ice cream out of paper cups with

Outpost logos. They laugh. We go nearer.

She maintains eye contact. Her meaning is clear.

Milo turns, sees Brian (Stanford classmate, Outpost zealot)

give an envelope to a Guard at the door of #20; he trots

over to Milo, who is as flustered as another guy might be

having been found in bed with a girl.

He looks at Lisa, back to Milo, wondering why he isn't being

introduced.

Seeing how flushed Milo is, Brian thinks he must have

blundered in on something. He starts to back away.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

The station is closed. Milo's car is parked, empty.

We find him, in an illuminated phone booth.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. TEDDY'S LOFT (SUNNYVALE) - CONTINUOUS

A funky space, posters on the wall, a red Stanford pennant,

rubber trees at either end of his desk.

On the wall beyond Teddy the word GOOK (in blood red) has

been covered over with paint but still bleeds through.

EXT. BUILDING #20 QUAD - DAY

Through a window, we watch Milo traverse the quad.

We are

INT. GARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Gary turns back inside, where Phil reads Milo's new code.

Phil is confused by Gary's sincerity; so is Gary.

EXT. BUILDING #20 PARKING LOT - EVENING

Desi and another Geek watch in astonishment: Gary walks Milo

to his car, his arm circled over Milo's shoulder. He seems

to be -- apologizing.

EXT./INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - EVENING

Milo comes eagerly up the path: can't wait to tell Alice

what just happened. He enters -- pulls up short. Alice is

waiting for him. She's white.

She doesn't know how to say it.

Milo is staggered. She moves to him...

He hangs onto her, for support.

EXT. SUNNYVALE LOFT BLDG. (SILICON VALLEY) - DAY

Establish the funky building, vestiges of police tape on the

door, a limo and many cars parked out front.

INT. LOFT - MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

A mixture of Teddy's relatives and Computer Friends have

gathered. In the BG, Teddy's Dad weeps volubly.

INT. TEDDY'S WORKSPACE - CONTINUOUS

Teddy's brother, NELSON, shows Milo the workspace: red

Stanford pennant, rubber trees on the desk. Milo, in a suit,

peers at the painted-over epithet on the wall.

Nelson shows Milo a San Jose Mercury: mugshots of two skin-

headed Aryan Nations Members in their 20's.

Milo unpins a picture of himself & Teddy from a board.

Milo is stung by this. Alice appears in the doorway.

Milo is pinning the picture back up. The pushpin falls to

the floor, he kneels to retrieve it. On the floorboards, he

sees a thin, shiny plastic filament. He picks it up.

But when he looks up, Nelson's gone.

As he heads out with Alice, he unthinkingly stuffs the

filament in his suit pocket.

EXT. BLUFF OVER THE PACIFIC - DAY

A raw beautiful bluff. The sea stretches to infinity behind

a smaller group of Mourners. A LAY MINISTER intones the Lord's

Prayer.

EXT. BLUFF - LATER

Milo approaches Larry with trepidation. Larry nods, it's

okay. They hug each other. They walk slowly back toward the

cars.

They smile. For a moment, they've brought Teddy back to life.

Alice comes up from behind, to fetch Milo.

EXT. BLDG. 20 - DAY

Arriving for work, Milo sees Outpost flags at half mast.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

As Milo comes up the hall, Lisa is standing there. We get

the feeling she's been waiting for him.

He looks at her, perhaps hearing Teddy's words ("what're the

chances?"). He nods, moves on. She watches him head up the

hall.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY

Milo types. There is a rapping on the doorframe. Gary.

Gary nods. Spontaneously Milo stands, hugs Gary.

INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Milo sits on the couch, in dim light. Alice comes in.

EXT. DINING ROOM TERRACE - DAY

Milo eats alone. Through the window, he sees Lisa inside.

She's eating alone, too. Gary comes trotting up.

He is unclasping a manila envelope; he takes pages out.

Seeing Gary's code, Milo knits his brow: it must be sort of

like -- Teddy's.

Milo's smile freezes. As he stares at Gary, we zoom with a

reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily but

Gary remains dominant in frame. For Milo, it feels like the

very ground is going out from under him.

Gary continues to explain, pointing at lines of code. And

Milo pretends to listen. But he can't even make out the words

Gary speaks -- he hears only a jumble of echoes.

Milo nods mechanically; he wants to scream. Or run. He

perceives, amid the echoes, that Gary is standing, smiling,

saying "See you later." And he's gone.

Milo touches the pages, like some talisman of Teddy.

It strikes him she always shows up at these moments. He

gathers his wits before looking up.

INT./EXT. MILO'S CAR/OUTPOST PARKING LOT - DAY

Pulling out of the lot, Milo seizes the car phone. He hits

HOME on the speed-dial. Gets a busy signal. Rings off. He's

about to press re-dial when he sees the Outpost logo branded

on the receiver.

He throws it down like it's contaminated.

EXT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - DAY

Middle-of-the-day sounds: chirping birds, school children.

Milo pulls to the curb at a bad angle.

EXT. INT./FRONT DOOR/FOYER - DAY

He fumbles with his keys. When he gets inside:

He moves into the bedroom. He sees her through the window,

painting in the studio.

EXT./INT. BACK GARDEN/STUDIO - MOMENT LATER

He stands outside the studio. Waits for her to look up. She

does. She smiles. Then she sees something's wrong. He waits

for her to come out here, where it's safe to speak.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - LATER

He paces, agitated. She watches him. She's skeptical, but

doesn't want to appear unsympathetic.

INT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Milo's at the closet, rummaging among the clothes hanging

there. Alice comes up behind him. He finds his suit jacket.

He digs in one pocket, then another. He finds the fiber optic

strand (from Teddy's floor). Shows it to her.

EXT. BACK GARDEN - AGAIN

They've trooped back outside. She's worried she's indulging

his paranoia.

He knows what she's saying: he's unqualified for this, a

space-cadet. She tries to hold him. But he wriggles away.

He paces, he thinks. She watches him, worried.

She can't lie. She shakes her head.

BEGIN MONTAGE:

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Standing at his window, Milo can see #21. Workers in Hardhats

come out of it, carrying lunchboxes. Milo holds a small

writing pad. He notes the time.

EXT. SUBURBAN MAIN STREET - DAY (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

Alice parks in front of a drugstore. As she gets out of the

car, she looks around uneasily.

INT. DRUGSTORE - (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

Alice is at the counter, buying a wind-up alarm clock.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT (CONT. MONTAGE)

Milo watches a car pull out of the parking lot, leaving only

one or two others. He writes down the time.

INT. TOYSTORE - (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

Alice is at the counter, among children and mothers,

purchasing a chemistry set.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

He watches a SECURITY GUARD (DELBERT) go into #21 on his

rounds, notes the time: 3:45 AM.

INT. MILO & ALICE'S - STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

Alice, wearing dishwashing gloves, ties the alarm clock to a

small Tupperware container with copper wire.

Milo (wearing latex gloves) is at the sink, mixing chemicals

from the toy chemistry set. Alice approaches with the

container affixed to the clock. As she holds it out Milo

pours the mixture into it.

OVER BLACK we hear ticking. The screen lightens to show:

INT. SUPPLY CLOSET (BUILDING 20)

Milo's alarm clock is set for 11:00. It sits amid mops and

cleaning products.

INT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - DAY

Milo stands in the open door of a refrigerator, as if

searching for a soda. He's looking up the hall, waiting for

someone. He consults his watch. 10:53.

Here comes a GUARD; he nods to Milo as he passes. The Guard

opens a door with his card. Milo rushes through the door on

the Guard's swipe -- "tailgating."

Milo cops an attitude. He's not completely convincing.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

Bob Shrot, the ex-cop in charge of physical security, looks

up as the Guard escorts Milo into the room.

INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

The bomb explodes. The blast is tiny but loud (glass cleaning

bottles ring; plastic bottles moan).

INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Milo sits, watches Shrot encode a new card for him, finding

his info on a terminal. On a monitor behind Shrot, Milo sees

Programmers being ushered out of the building.

ANOTHER GUARD rushes in.

Shrot comes to his feet, grabs a holster (with gun) off a

shelf. Milo, looking flummoxed, stands.

Milo sits. Shrot goes out with the Guard.

Milo moves quickly to the wall, reads a chart with the Guards'

Schedule, runs his finger down it til he finds the name of

the Guard on the 3 AM shift: DELBERT, KEN.

INT. HALLWAYS - A FEW QUICK CUTS - CONTINUOUS

Guards open closet doors, shine their flashlights.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Milo has moved to Shrot's seat. He's encoding a fresh card

with Ken Delbert's information.

INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Panning off the civil defense sign we find Shrot standing at

a closet, examining a piece of the alarm clock.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Milo is at work, bringing up schematic screens, diagnosing

the system with his unique concentration.

Panning to the window, we see the evacuated Programmers

enjoying themselves on the lawn. It's a rare, exciting event:

they jump around, miming explosions.

INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Shrot and the Guard collect pieces of the bomb out of the

debris, puts them in a tray.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Milo brings up the screen that controls the #21 cameras. On

the monitors, he sees nothing very interesting: a hallway, a

room under construction...

He pulls down a menu. RECORDING is highlighted. He clicks

PLAYBACK. The image hardly changes, but a Guard wanders

through. He types, the tape rewinds (the Guard moves

backwards). He finds a neutral spot (showing an empty

hallway), stops the tape.

INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Gary, Randy & Phil approach Shrot; Gary stares at him.

Gary explodes, with incredulity.

Gary strides off. Shrot feels unfairly maligned.

Randy and Phil head up the hall. Shrot watches them. Even if

his "intellectual superiors" are convinced of Milo's

innocence, he isn't.

He walks swiftly back toward his office. Then he runs.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Milo reads a warning message. DOWNLOADING PLAYBACK STREAM TO

RECORD CYCLE WILL CAUSE BIT OVERLOAD. DO YOU WISH TO PROCEED?

Y/N. He types Y.

The glitch freezes the tape (we see it lock into place): it

shows the empty hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They've let the Programmers back in. They head up the hall

as Shrot heads down it. He pushes past them gruffly.

He knows he's enhancing his Neanderthal image (they make

cracks) but he's more interested in obeying his instinct.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Milo immobilizes another camera in #21... and another.

INT. HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

Shrot rounds the corner. His office is in view, now.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Milo, at the keyboard, closes up windows, one by one.

INT. SECURITY OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Shrot is back, he has only to round the corner to see Milo.

We assume his POV as he does so:

Milo sits in the chair where Shrot left him.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Pan off the clock (3:20 AM) to find Milo at his desk, looking

at the clock with a certain dread. It's time.

EXT. BLDG. 20 QUAD - NIGHT

Milo walks the path between the two buildings, fiddling

nervously with the dummied swipe card.

Hearing footfalls behind him, he whirls: it's a Geek loping

to his car. He smiles. Milo smiles: waits, walks on.

Nearing #21, Milo looks around, making sure no one else is

around. His POV (panning): A Programmer works late, visible

through a lighted window in #20... The dog sculpture with

cocked ears sits atop the Day Care, its quizzical expression

seeming to wonder what Milo is up to... The Geek he just saw

racing by on foot now pulls out of the parking lot in his

James Bond BMW...

Milo arrives at the entrance. Heart pounding, he brings the

card to the slot. Will he trigger that awful alarm?

He slides the card, the door clicks.

INT. BLDG. 21 - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

He enters: concrete floor, unpainted walls, construction

lights. At the inner door he looks up at the camera.

A MONITOR

that shows us where Milo stands, minus Milo. Widen:

INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

A GUARD packs up his stuff, getting ready to go home. The

new guard, KEN DELBERT enters.

INT. BLDG. 21 - INNER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Milo moves up a hall with unpainted walls, bare floors,

unconnected wires. The only illumination is from construction

lights on the concrete floor. Opening doors, he sees:

Bare rooms. Wall plates ready to receive electrical equipment,

bundles of wire hanging out. In other words: the building is

as advertised, so far.

EXT. BUILDING 20 - NIGHT

Delbert comes out with his flashlight, heads across the clean-

swept path that leads to #21.

INT. BLDG. 21 - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Milo nears a set of double-doors at the end of the hall. He

hears a low ominous hum from within. Convinced he's found

something, he quickens his pace. He's about to swipe his

card when a beam of light bounces along the wall.

He presses himself into an alcove. Through a chink in the

unfinished wall he sees:

Delbert come in the front door. His rounds consist of shining

his torch up at the cameras, making sure the red lights are

on.

He walks right past Milo (who doesn't breath).

Delbert swipes open the double doors, leans in: the humming

gets louder.

ON MILO: pressing himself into the alcove.

Delbert turns around, heads back down the hall... exits the

building.

Milo waits a beat before heading to the end of the hall.

Using the card, he enters

A BIG SPACE

A studio-to-be, architectural touches like soffits framed in

but not plaster-boarded. The portentous hum comes from around

a corner. He approaches, convinced the answer lies here.

Clearing the wall he sees:

A squat emergency generator sitting on the floor, powering

construction lights. Something you'd buy at Sears.

EXT. #21 ENTRANCE/A MOMENT LATER - (BINOCULAR SHOT)

Through infra-red binoculars we see Milo come out, looking

left and right, to make sure he hasn't been observed.

We are

INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - BLDG. 20 - CONTINUOUS

Randy turns back into the room, where Phil is sifting through

papers spread over a coffee table.

Randy pulls the blinds shut, joins Phil.

EXT. QUAD - CRANE SHOT CONTINUOUS

From a high angle, we track Milo, as he walks along the path

to a bench. The camera passes briefly behind a dark object

in the foreground (dog sculpture) as we track him.

QUAD - TIGHTER - CONTINUOUS

Milo sags onto the bench. He stares out, perplexed, suffering.

Then he knits his brow. He seems to be studying -- the ground.

Or rather the shadow stretched out in front of him: the

looming silhouette of the dog atop the Day Care.

He stands up, turns around. REVERSE ON:

The whimsical canine. Push toward it's ears cocked to the

sky... Then toward a single ear, framed by fur-brown concrete,

but with a smooth, concave inner surface of enamelled metal:

satellite dish.

EXT. DAY CARE CENTER - A MOMENT LATER

At the entrance, Milo applies the swipe-card.

INT. DAY CARE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

He steps in on colorful carpeting, amid balls & tricycles.

Kid's artwork hangs on the wall. He moves through this room,

into the

COMPUTER ROOM

20 screens glow. They hang suspended over a wide, ringed

table, a chair at each keyboard. Indeed, Gary has spared no

expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital

screens. At the moment, they show colorful, childish contour

drawings that say WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: a spaceship).

There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of

the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming).

Milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens.

Not surprisingly, most of the WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings

are of desks or tables with computers.

Tracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that shows a

workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant

at each end of a desk. Even in contour form it's -- familiar.

Milo passes it. And comes back to it.

Staring at it, he sits. He begins typing. [The drawing still

occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the

bottom, there is dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furiously --

numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying to do is

a challenge even to him. He deletes lines, begins anew, his

frustration evident.

As he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the

screen start to fill in. The contour lines slowly dissolve

into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in

Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now).

When all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears CLICK

CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from every direction, as all the

screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images. All

of them show variations on a theme:

A workstation seen by a camera over-the-shoulder of a

programmer (if he were present). The stations are of various

shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed

view of screen & keyboard. At this hour, few programmers are

present. One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk. A

Japanese Geek is hard at work: it's day there.

INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Phil and Randy work at the coffee table.

INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo works the keyboard. Again, the code gets dense and

obscure as he goes deeper. He succeeds in calling-up a

graphical interface. Among the menus he can choose from are:

TARGET SCHOOLS, PD UPLOADS, RX UPLOADS.

He clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, Cal

Tech, etc.). He clicks Stanford, then Chin, Teddy. Two windows

open. In one, there is a video stream of Teddy winning an

award in the Gate's Bldg. In the other, uploaded police video

stenciled SUNNYVALE PD) of the White Supremacists whose mug-

shots we saw in the San Jose Mercury; they're being

interrogated.

In the first window, Teddy's image dissolves into a handheld

crime-scene video (marked SV-PD) of a ransacked grocery store.

"DIE GOOK!" is painted on a wall. Milo looks confused: some

"narrative" is unfolding, but it remains obscure without

audio.

He types some more.

In the bottom window, he brings up convoluted text regarding

the audio. About the only phrases we can understand are:

"Audio Block ON" and "Hardware Requirement: Magnetic Filter

Type PBX-R17."

His eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware

substitute. He digs in his shirt pocket. He takes out his

swipe card, studies it. He casts about some more, till he

sees some kids' safety scissors in a jar.

INT. BUILDING 20 - SERVICE HALL - CONTINUOUS

Randy whistles as he heads up the hall. Arriving at the door

with the Civil Defense sticker, he swipes his card.

INT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

On-screen, long-lens footage shows a low building; the Aryan

Nations suspects come out of it. A still photo appears in

the 2nd window: a steel hasp.

Milo's eyes are narrowed: what am I seeing? Meantime, he is

reaching under the table where he has removed a plate from

the mainframe terminal, exposing hardware within.

He has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its

magnetic strip into a metal slot. He wiggles the card. We

hear an eerie fibrillation, which flattens into the voice of

a serene, eminently sane female:

Crime-scene video streams in now stenciled FBI by the

time/date). A handheld camera pans a blood-spattered wall

then shows a mutilated Asian murder victim. (All of this

footage is made even eerier by the jerky glitches always

present in streaming video, and its sinister graininess.)

Milo pales as he realizes he is watching a primer on how

racial killings are done.

He hears a creaking noise behind him, and whirls.

It's the classroom hamster, on his wheel.

INT. STAIRWELL/BOMB SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

Still whistling, Randy descends some metal stairs, enters a

vast bomb shelter (canned foods, etc.)

INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo has tapped into his own file: footage of him lecturing

at Stanford (as an RA), pointing to a whiteboard.

The audio crackles and drops out again. Milo's eyes narrow:

he sees video of Alice, sitting on a folding chair, speaking

to someone. She has a harder look, pulls on a Marlboro.

What's he seeing? He wiggles the jerry-rigged hardware almost

urgently, till the narration crackles back on:

He hears her voice under the Narration, answering an unseen

Interrogator (sounds like Phil). It's a job interview. Milo

subtly, unconsciously shakes his head, as if to deny what

his eyes see. The narration begins to fibrillate, again:

The audio drops out as Milo sees uploaded medical files and

ER photos of himself marked STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER: he's

waxen, bloated, gasping for breath. With a certain dread,

Milo jams the card in deeper:

Milo is devastated, disbelieving. Now he sees real-time ER

footage: an Allergy Victim, bloated, twitching, gasping,

dying...

The audio crackles out. But Milo doesn't have the heart to

bring it back: he can fill in the rest.

INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Randy traverses a well-lit tunnel. Still whistling.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY CARE CENTER - NIGHT

Numb now, Milo clicks randomly: crime footage, personal

records, animations -- it all flies by with Chuck Worman-

like speed.

Milo closes his eyes, leans back: overwhelmed. Suddenly he

sits forward, whispers almost fervently as he types:

INT. DAY-CARE - UNDERGROUND ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Camera moves slowly through stacks of pre-school supplies,

toward a windowed door at the back of the room.

RANDY appears in the window, lit ominously from below. He

applies his swipe card.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo watches footage of Lisa taken by surveillance cam- eras:

she is outside #21, trying to peek in the door.

In one window, footage of Lisa casing the hallway before

going into Milo's office; in another, footage of her eating

lunch with Milo.

Milo clicks. A MAN's pair of mug shots appear. In the other

window, a grade-school yearbook photo of Lisa.

Milo watches streaming local news footage of a man being

taken from a courtroom in shackles (jerky, grainy). He's

lost the audio, but doesn't need it, anymore.

INT. DAY-CARE STAIRWELL

Randy climbs up to the main floor... whistling.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS

Milo watches eerie crime-scene footage: a Girl with her throat

slashed.

But then, hearing nearly-distant whistling, he clicks on

windows furiously: closing them.

INT. DAY CARE BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy rounds a corner. He enters the

COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The screens show the children's contour images, again. Where's

Milo?

Randy takes a seat at the same console Milo was at, and begins

to type. Camera booms slowly down beneath table-level to

find:

MILO hanging onto the underside of the table, knuckles white,

as he clings to metal table braces. The toes of his sneakers

are jammed into the space between a black plastic data tower

and the table bottom.

Randy shifts in his seat, his knee rising toward Milo's back.

Milo arches it, avoids a knee by mere millimeters.

RANDY: brings up a shot of a Programmer at work, zooms in on

his screen to begin collecting his code.

MILO: begins to lose his grip as sweat forms on his brow

and, worse, on his hands. They're giving way.

RANDY: clicks. A printer across the room start making a hard-

copy of the purloined code.

MILO: stares in horror as the data tower his toes are jammed

on top of starts to shift -- threatening to disengage from

its ports. He tries to lift it back up with heels of his

shoes.

RANDY: knits his brow as his screen flickers. He keeps typing,

but starts to lower his head: he's going to look under the

table.

MILO: winces as he presses the tower upward with his heels,

while trying to maintain his balance...

RANDY: lowering his head, keeps his eyes on the screen, hits

keys. Just as he is about to clear the level of the table --

the screen re-illumines. He comes back up.

MILO: having extended his legs to support the tower, feels

his hands slipping...

RANDY: closes up the window...

MILO: flops to the carpet(!) just as --

RANDY pushes away from the table... From the floor

MILO watches him walk over to the printer, collect his

hardcopy, and disappear from view.

Milo listens: the door clicks shut, the whistling recedes.

BACK ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Milo traces Randy's steps. He sees the door with the Civil

Defense sticker, intuits how Randy got here, i.e, how one

moves, unobserved, between the Day Care and #20.

He sags against the wall. Wondering what to do, now.

EXT./INT. MILO'S CAR/STREET - DAWN

Milo sits in his idling car, staring at his own house, up

the street. How can he go in there?

He puts the car in gear, does a U-Turn.

EXT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - SEATTLE - EARLY MORNING

The Deux Chevaux is parked on the street outside a government

building. Not many people are around, yet. A Janitor hoses

down the sidewalk.

INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - RECEPTION AREA MORNING

Milo slides a business card across a reception desk. It's

the one the rumpled Prosecutor, Lyle Barton, gave him that

day in Palo Alto.

He looks over his shoulder, then back again, frightened.

INT. BARTON'S OUTER OFFICE - MORNING

Milo sits on a wooden bench, foot tapping. Hearing Barton's

voice, he comes to his feet. Barton enters with a Co-Worker,

holding a container of coffee, discussing the particulars of

a case.

Milo is relieved the second he sees Barton's kindly face.

Milo enters as Barton finishes up with his colleague.

INT. BARTON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Milo paces. He surveys framed diplomas, commendations and

photos on the wall. He takes comfort in their solidity:

pictures of Barton's teenage Kids, Barton and Wife at the

Grand Canyon. There's a college football photo, a young Barton

with his team. Milo studies it, smiles. Move in on the photo,

till we see the number on Barton's Notre Dame football jersey:

ND 47.

Milo's smile fades. It takes a moment before he even hears

Barton behind him.

As Milo takes the seat in front of the desk (mind spinning)

Barton moves to his own chair.

What's he gonna say?

INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING

Alice is on the phone in the front room. Agitated, she puffs

on a pencil (surrogate cigarette). We hear Phil through the

receiver:

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

EXT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING

Milo comes up the path. He pauses as he nears the door: he's

not sure he can pull this off.

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

As Milo enters, Alice rushes to meet him.

She watches him as he collapses onto the couch.

She shakes her head.

She sits by him, touches her hand to his face tenderly. He

closes his eyes for a moment, steels himself to her touch.

Then he forces himself to cup his hand over hers.

But he can't stand it. He gets up, looks out the window.

He doesn't see her smile: is that all. Assuming an

appropriately concerned expression, she moves toward him:

She turns him around, kisses him. Her eyes are closed. His

remain open. He's looking at her. Trying to comprehend the

treachery.

She touches him, breathes heavily. She wants more than kisses:

to prove to herself how wrong Phil was, her professional

pride insulted. Or perhaps it's more personal than that,

especially with Lisa as a potential rival.

But she doesn't stop. She moans as she presses herself to

him: wants proof of his devotion.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

He's on top of her in the moment just after. Her eyes are

closed. He stares at her -- glares at her -- with what we

recognize as spent anger.

Shit. She knows.

What's clear is, she liked it. A clap of thunder takes us

to:

EXT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT

It's pouring. Milo stands outside, wearing a slicker, looking

in the window at someone.

INT. PIZZA PLACE - MOMENT LATER

Lisa reads a paperback at a table, a slice of pizza on her

plate, an umbrella hooked to her chair. Sensing someone

standing over her, she looks up. She smiles.

Milo sits across from her. He doesn't know where to start.

He looks around, wants to make sure no one's listening. He

speaks very quietly.

Two Men with even features enter the restaurant. One has a

laptop case slung over his shoulder.

EXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT

They're in a bandshell. The rain falls heavily, drips off

the eaves. She holds the filament from Teddy's workspace.

She's peering at him. He reads her mind.

She wants to believe him.

His plea is so ardent, his humanity so transparent. But she

can't quite do it.

She smiles sadly as she backs away.

She tries to sound tough; there are tears in her eyes.

He wants to comfort her. He takes a step toward her. She

shakes her head: no.

She draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks. She

weeps silently. He moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing

her fear, her trauma. He touches her shoulders. She tenses,

tries to back away.

But he holds on.

Slowly, he wraps his arms around her.

She remains tense for a moment, then yields, pressing her

face into his shoulder. The rain drums on the bandshell.

After a moment:

She clings to him tightly, now, the wall of her mistrust

breached after all the years of pain, secrecy, shame.

A wide shot: they hold each other, alone in the storm.

INT. LIBRARY-LIKE OFFICE - DAY

Alice nods. She sits in front of leather-bound books.

She's at Gary's house. On the hot seat. Phil and Randy watch

her. Gary does, too, but deep in shadow, behind a desk, at a

remove. Rain falls heavily on the Lake.

Phil looks convinced. Gary doesn't.

EXT. HIGHWAY/GAS STATION - MORNING

From across the highway (cars with morning commuters whiz

by) we see Milo pumping gas at a self-serve; Lisa fills-up

in the next lane. Ostensibly, they have run into each other

on the way to work. They are smiling, casual.

Only when we cut close do we see that their expressions bear

no connection to their words.

She defines it:

She pretends to need help lifting her car hood: "a helpless

female." He comes over to help her.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING

Bob Shrot is on the phone. Behind him, a nerdy security

programmer, LEN DIETZ, is at the console that controls the

security cameras (the ones Milo futzed with).

Scrolling, Len knits his brow: he's found something odd.

EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

Milo checks Lisa's oil for her.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Shrot stands over Len's shoulder.

EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

Milo shows Lisa the oil stick. She nods.

He slams the hood.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

Shrot and Len watch a laser printer, as it spits out line

after line after line of swipe card entries...

A LASER PRINTER spits out code. We are:

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY

Milo watches new Skywire code emerge from his printer.

Gary is in the doorway behind him: watching Milo, scrutin-

izing him. Sensing someone, Milo turns and looks.

Gary takes the page. As he reads it over:

Milo thinks: he's testing me.

Gary smiles. There's no way to read it.

EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

Establish the humble building, in a Park.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Lisa and Milo sit together in front of a monitor. A Kid does

his homework on a computer at the next table. Milo shakes

his head, as he scrolls.

At the next table, she notices a Lady reading Time.

She's thought of something. He's watching the nerdy Kid,

smiling sadly, perhaps identifying with him.

Move in on Milo as he thinks it over with a mixture of

excitement and skepticism.

EXT. LIBRARY/PARK - NIGHT

Milo and Lisa walk in the park outside the library, thinking

it through.

The complications pile up. They walk. They think.

They come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of the

park, stop walking.

Gallows humor. What a game girl. He's nuts about her.

He kisses her. There are no constraints now, there's no

"adulterous" guilt: they kiss with a passion deferred.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Slow push-in on the phone on Milo's desk: it's ringing.

INT. ALICE'S STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

Alice is calling him. Her face hardens, she hangs up.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER

As we pan the Best Western decor (in semi-darkness):

Milo grins. He & Lisa lie in bed.

She smiles, rather bashfully.

It's painful for him: losing a second father.

INT. ALICE & MILO'S HOUSE - LATER

Alice is in bed. In the darkness, Milo comes in as quietly

as possible. But she switches on the bedside lamp.

Of course she buys it: it's in the file.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING

Shrot and Len go over the print-out of the card entries.

INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING

Morning TV is on in the kitchen. A Seattle station airs a

puff piece about a party at Gary's house: people in formal

clothes (including Gary & his Wife) hold drinks and eat

canapes on the terrace over Lake Washington. (Gary's haircut

is different: it's file footage.)

Alice, grinding coffee, isn't paying attention. Milo is.

But he's out the door. She's not entirely displeased by such

a dramatic demonstration of his loyalty to her.

EXT. BUILDING 21 - DAY

Close on a satellite dish. We pan from the base of the dish

to the wiring: a cable is fused to a component box.

Lisa is on the scaffolding, having climbed it brazenly, in

broad daylight. She holds a small metal box with a meter and

two clamps. She applies the clamps to the base of the cable.

The needle on the meter dances.

She was expecting to be busted. Still, she's scared.

EXT. SAINT CATHERINE'S DAY SCHOOL - DAY

A Catholic school on a wooded lane. Schoolgirls in uniform

play on the swings and hopscotch courts.

INT. LIBRARY - SAINT CATHERINE'S

Milo types madly on a four-year-old PC. It takes him a moment

to notice SISTER BEATRICE.

With her, we see the complex lines of code.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

Lisa sits with Bob Shrot. She's unfolding a page of sketch

paper.

She hands him an unfinished rendering of the dish. He looks

at her, at the drawing, at her again. She's scared, but tries

to hide it.

Relieved, she gets up. The meter tumbles to the floor, thud.

She goes white. But when she looks up, she sees

Shrot didn't see it: Len is standing in the inner door, waving

a printout.

Lisa grabs up the meter as Shrot joins Len. As she goes out,

she hears:

INT. SEATTLE MONORAIL CAR - NIGHT

Milo looks up as his train comes into a station. Lisa enters

the car, carrying a stack of comix. He stands, they kiss, he

takes the comix.

They look at each other: the consequences of this discovery

would be deadly.

INT. BUILDING 20 CAFETERIA - DAY

A busy lunch hour. Milo is eating with some other Programmers,

including Desi. There's a stir of excitement in the room.

Gary comes straight to Milo's table; all conversation

instantly drops out.

Milo stands. Gary hands him a heavy vellum invitation.

Everybody at the table is listening.

Milo sits down. Everybody's looking at him.

INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

Delbert is seated across from Shrot and Len. Shrot holds the

printout.

Shrot hands Delbert the printout. Delbert looks at it: dense

with coded entries. He stares at it.

Shrot narrows his eyes...

INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

Milo sits with Lisa as she brings up the graphic interface

she's designed for the Skywire broadcast. It's an Outpost

desktop, with recognizable logos, fonts, etc.

He nods. [It's not necessary for us to understand what she's

saying, just so Milo does.] She holds up an audio copy of

Gary's book, The Next Highway.

He already looks nervous. We begin to hear live music.

EXT. GARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The music echoes from inside. Push past a line of cars and

limousines in the lit-up drive, Milo's car at the head of

it.

Milo and Alice get out. As they go inside, she pulls a tag

from the sleeve of his just-bought dinner jacket.

INT. GARY'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

As Milo and Alice enter, he sees a Balthus painting re-

digitize to a Mondrian.

Alice smiles, Milo forces a smile: it'll be even harder to

sneak away, now.

They pass a doorway where a Houseman stands, to keep guests

from entering residential rooms (the ones Milo must pass

through to get to Gary's workroom). A Guy in a pretentiously

hip tux tries to peek in.

Milo looks a little more tense...

PARTY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

The room is full of people. A long windowed wall has been

opened onto a lakeside terrace, where more Guests drink and

chat, and an orchestra plays.

A giant Mondrian digitizes on the wall: the world's largest

ID card. Milo sinks a little more.

Across the room, Gary, his Wife (a blandly pretty blond) and

two Men are grouped around a Monet set on an antique easel

(thus clearly the real thing; Mrs. Boyd has prevailed.) Gary

notices the giant digital Mondrian.

MILO takes two flutes of champagnes off a tray. He hands one

to Alice as Gary et. al. approach.

LINDER is a short, tan man of 50.

RICKY is 25-years-old; he looks like a Polo model.

ANGLE: the orchestra, playing.

ANGLE: a group of SOCIETY TYPES chatting.

ANGLE: Milo, Alice, Gary, Barry Linder, Clarissa, Ricky.

Milo looks utterly preoccupied...

Gary smiles as everyone toasts him, except Milo; he hasn't

heard any of it.

Laughter.

TRACK MILO as he wends his way through laughing, chatting

Guests, dread and determination on his face. He moves away

from us, enters the

ENTRANCE HALL

speaks to the Houseman who guards the residential rooms.

He indicates an area on Milo's side of the door.

He points to a door immediately behind him. As the Houseman

watches, Milo goes into the

BATHROOM

He stands there a moment, breathes deeply. He cracks open

the door. The Houseman is turning away another Guest; Milo

makes his move.

DEN-LIKE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Looking over his shoulder, Milo hurries to a door at the far

end of the room, silently cursing the Mondrian that inevitably

appears.

The Houseman looks over his shoulder, sees the closed bathroom

door, assumes Milo's still inside.

INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Gary chats with his guests. Alice looks up at the digital

art, now a Bosch again.

INT. GARY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS

Milo walks fast. As he passes from one room to next, he sees

a Mondrian: he's been in this room. All the austere,

tastefully decorated rooms are blending together.

He stands in the center of the room making quarter turns.

Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a perfectly-

appointed "den," the ultimate expression of bland, rich,

professionally-decorated taste.

He's lost.

He starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into another.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

The Houseman looks over his shoulder again. He sees the

Mondrian and, in the room beyond that, another Mondrian.

He moves to the bathroom door, knocks on it. Opens it. He

pulls a sleek walkie-talkie from his jacket.

INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS

Milo, still lost, is getting frantic. He doubles back, cuts

toward another wing of the house. Through an open doorway he

sees:

A young, chillingly calm NANNY, watching him. The Baby fusses

in her arms. Milo smiles, keeps moving.

INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS

A Second Houseman follows the trail of Mondrians. He sees

Mondrians in two different directions. He hesitates, picks a

direction, keeps moving.

INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The first Houseman moves through the Guests, toward Gary.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo has finally made it. Sitting at Gary's work station, he

slips a CD-ROM into the PC. It floods with text. The music

echoes from far off. The entire wall behind him is filled

with a Mondrian.

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

As Linder chats, the first Houseman sidles up to Gary,

whispers in his ear. We see Gary smile, excuse himself. He

and Alice share a look as he moves off.

We go with Gary. His smiles fades instantly. He pushes through

Guests, who thank him for hosting such a brilliant "do;" he

hardly hears them.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - NIGHT

Milo writes frantically on his tiny pad, copying from the PC

screen:

LONGITUDE - 77 Degrees 03 Minutes 58 Seconds East

LATITUDE - 38 Degrees 55 Minutes 14 Seconds South

ALTITUDE - 426 MILES

He flips the page, begins entering the fixes for the next

satellite. Thinking he's heard something, he looks up.

Nobody's there.

INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS

The Second Houseman turns in several directions, confused by

the trail of Mondrians. Passing into the next room, he runs

into a Third Houseman, also confused. Each follows a different

Mondrian, in a different room.

INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS

Unlike the Housemen, Gary doesn't follow the paintings. He

moves swiftly, seems to know where Milo is.

GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo still working...

PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Alice looks up at the digital painting: still a Bosch. Her

face sets grimly.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo clicks, closing the window. Concentrating, he doesn't

see what we see on the wall behind him: the Mondrian drains

away... And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch triptych.

After a moment, Milo senses something.

Gary stands in the doorway. Watching him. Milo doesn't

breathe. Gary crosses the room, eyes locked with Milo's.

Gary comes behind Milo. He reads the screen. It's filled

with text, whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down.

Gary stares at Milo. He looks skeptical. The party music

floats in from afar as the moment stretches.

This hangs there.

The Second Houseman sticks his head in.

He looks over. Milo looks over. Among the framed

commendations, awards, degrees we see Milo's childhood

program, written on Outpost 1.0. Gary has had it framed.

Milo absorbs it. Even now, he feels something for Gary.

Milo smiles almost tenderly. He doesn't know if Gary buys

it. Perhaps if he could see Gary's eyes. But they're obscured

by Bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses.

Gary moves away from Milo, he stands over the table with the

art books, vaguely looks through one.

Milo wonders: does he know? He picks his words carefully.

Gary puts down the book. Something in his tone draws Milo.

Is this a confession? A plea for understanding? Or just a

pep-talk to keep Milo focused on Skywire?

EXT./INT DRIVEWAY/MILO'S CAR - LATER

In the car, Milo and Alice pull away from the lights and

limos in icy silence. Several beats.

He looks at her. She stares ahead, out the windshield.

He'd better have his story straight with Gary and Alice.

Or is she faking it? Has he lost the trust of all of them?

He's afraid, now.

EXT. INT. DAY CARE - DAY

Move in on the building, past Kids playing in the yard.

INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

We hear the children's shouts OS. Short, with a fingerprint

kit, is dusting the keyboards. Len stands over him.

EXT. LIBRARY PARK - EVENING

By the balustrade, in the dimness, Milo stands with Lisa.

She looks at him, worried, then takes a disk out of her

backpack.

He takes it. They kiss. She watches him go, worried.

EXT./INT. MILO'S HOUSE - NIGHT

As Milo comes up the path, he sees Alice in the kitchen.

He opens the front door, steps in. She comes from the kitchen

in an apron, wiping her hands. The apron is spattered, her

hair is askew.

He smiles to hide his terror. Is she killing him now? Or

just testing his reaction? Or is it a sincere overture?

When she turns away, we see the fear on his face.

INT. THE BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Alice pulls into a dress.

IN THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Milo, at the stove, sniffs at the food that simmers in a

wok. He grabs a a spoon, examines it; but it's minced too

fine to discern one ingredient from another.

BEDROOM

Alice pulls her hair back with a ribbon...

KITCHEN

Milo churns the garbage in the wastebasket, reads the label

on a jar, the label on a can...

BEDROOM

Alice applies blush-on.

KITCHEN

Milo goes through the spice cabinet...

LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Milo paces. He stops when she comes from the bedroom.

Either she's the most cold-blooded woman in the world, or...

He takes her in his arms, kisses her long and hard -- as if

his life depended on it. When he releases her, she pretends

to swoon. She backs toward the kitchen.

KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

Camera is positioned on the counter, just behind the big

bowl as Alice spoons the food into it... She sprinkles on

some final ingredient, also minced.

DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo's fingers drum the table top...

KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Alice picks up the dish. We don't see her face.

ON THE DISH - MOVING - CONTINUOUS (ALICE'S POV)

We hold the dish out in front of us. The food shines in the

light, a poisonous yellow gleam. We move from kitchen to

dining room, slowly, deliberately...

Milo comes into view beyond the dish, wearing a forced smile.

We come all the way to the table with the dish, where Alice

sets it down.

She sits. Milo, still vamping, pours wine. He picks up his

fork. Stares at it.

His mind churns furiously.

When she's gone, he flips his left arm over and drags the

tines of his fork against it, making score-marks, like those

used by allergists to test for sensitivity.

He dabs the sauce onto the tracks, wipes it clean. He stares

at it.

INT. KITCHEN DRAWER - CONTINUOUS

Alice roots through ladles, bottle openers, cheese graters,

spatulas. At the bottom of the drawer, she finds two pairs

of take-out chopsticks, wrapped in white paper.

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo looks from his watch to his arm -- no reaction yet.

But here's Alice. She slips into her seat.

He unwraps the chopsticks rather slowly.

She smiles, picks up her glass.

They toast. She sips her wine. He sips his. He wants

desperately to glance at his inner arm once more. But she's

watching him, waiting for him to eat.

He picks up the chopsticks, gathers up a tiny bite. She

watches keenly. He brings the food to his mouth, passes it

between his lips, swallows.

He closes his eyes, ostensibly to savor the food, in fact

bracing for a paroxysm.

She watches him expectantly -- either for his verdict on the

food, or for the first fatal spasm.

She grins. She takes a bite. The moment she looks away, he

turns over his arm to get a look, face full of fear.

The tracks are still flat, there's no redness. He shovels a

large bite into his mouth, ecstatic to be alive. Then another

bite, greedy with life.

INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT

Shrot and Len are in a high-tech office. On a monitor, we

see a blown-up image of a fingerprint taken from Milo's

keyboard; Milo's name is printed under it.

In a second window, other fingerprints flash by: thousands

of prints lifted off keyboards in the Day Care.

Shrot waits for a match to click in.

INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Milo scrolls his Skywire code, concentrating intensely. Till

he feels some stickiness on his thumb and forefinger. He

rubs them together, peers at his keys.

Dolly-zoom in on a trace of fingerprint powder.

Fear seizes Milo. He ejects his the Skywire CD -- it is a

bright silver color, with a Skywire logo on it -- slips it

in an equally distinct silver (CD) jewel-case.

INT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER

Milo smiles at Desi as he moves up the hall. He almost bumps

into Gary's Secretary.

He continues up the hall. He ducks into the service hall.

INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Shrot watches as

The computer produces an alarm-like buzzing. The second window

locks onto the matching print. The prints flash in unison,

garishly confirming the match.

INT. TUNNEL/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Milo races along the tunnel that leads from #20 to the Day

Care...

INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Shrot punches a number on the phone.

INT. STAIRWELL/DAY CARE BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo climbs the stairs, fumbles with the swipecard, enters

the Day Care.

INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Len is at the console. On a security monitor, he has called-

up video from a moment ago: Milo hurrying up the hall, almost

running into Gary's Secretary.

Shrot has an eye on the video as he speaks on the phone.

Shrot straps on his service revolver as he heads out.

INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo is under the table, detaching one of the the black

plastic data towers that contain the "primers," stored

surveillance material, etc.

INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Phil hangs up the phone. He turns to Randy, who is with the

two men: the blond GUNTHER, the pale-eyed RIMAN.

INT. DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS

Milo carefully detaches a second data tower.

EXT. BLDG. 20 - CONTINUOUS

Shrot and Len hurry out of the building, toward the Day Care

across the quad. Len is ill-at-ease:

In his haste, Shrot doesn't even hear him.

INT. BUILDING 20 HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Gunther, Riman & Randy head down the service hallway, en

route to the bomb shelter stairs.

INT. DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS

Milo, lugging one bulky black data tower under each arm

(wondering if he should just ditch one) gets as far as the

main, colorfully-carpeted room --

Shrot is there, gun drawn. Len stands just behind.

Shrot thinks he's being mocked, as usual.

Milo sets down one of the towers.

Shrot looks skeptical.

Shrot doesn't deny it.

Milo's sincerity is striking. Shrot cogitates.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Gunther, Riman and Randy climb the metal stairs, turn at a

landing, climb some more.

When they get to the next landing, Riman opens the door.

They enter

THE DAY CARE - BACK ROOM

Hearing voices inside, Gunther draws a gun; they move forward

stealthfully. They enter the

COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy sees: Shrot and Len.

He shines his light under the table, where the towers have

been detached.

EXT. QUAD - CONTINUOUS

Milo hurries away from the Day Care. He has just one data

tower, now, so he can move faster.

INT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy starts to push past Shrot --

He gets to the front room, where the jettisoned data tower

still sits (but he doesn't see it).

Shrot watches anxiously to see if he's stopped Randy.

EXT. OUTPOST - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Milo moves low among the high-priced cars, lugging the tower.

He gets to his Deux Chevaux, opens the trunk --

Milo turns. It's Desi, again.

As calmly as possible, he stows the tower, slams the trunk,

gets in the car.

INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy hangs up the phone.

Reluctantly, Shrot & Len head out toward the front room.

INT./EXT MILO'S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Milo is on the phone, he drives as fast as one can in his

car.

INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy, Riman & Gunther have turned the Day Care into a

surveillance post. They hear Milo & Lisa's conversation on

speakers.

INT. LISA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

INT. MILO'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

He rings off. He reads something off a business card.

INT. LISA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Scrambling, Lisa grabs her old laptop, finds her keys.

INT. GARY'S HOUSE - GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

Phil's on the phone.

Gary's eyes narrow.

EXT./INT. BUILDING/MILO'S CAR - RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

Milo reads the address off the business card, which has a

satellite dish as its logo. (He holds it in front of him.)

When he brings down the card, it reveals a real-life satellite

dish through the windshield.

As the car pulls up by a low cinderblock building, we read a

sign that says KNQR - PUBLIC ACCESS.

INT. KNQR - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS

Milo rushes in, lugging the tower. There's a linoleum floor,

framed one-sheets for tacky public access shows (Yoga, blow-

dried Evangelist, Nude Talk Show). Behind the reception desk

sits a beefy RENT-A-GUARD with an earring.

INT./EXT. LISA'S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Lisa drives fast, checking her rear-view-mirror to make sure

she's not being followed. Pan to the seat next to her: her

laptop lies on the passenger seat.

INT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A monitor shows a green interface with yellow coordinates

(like an air traffic controllers' screen). Randy sits at the

keyboard in front of it, phone cradled on shoulder.

INT. KNQR - CONTINUOUS

Milo speaks to Brian.

Brian is examining the data tower. He touches the Outpost

logo branded into it, rather reverently.

Lisa comes in, laptop slung over her arm.

Brian's thinking it over. He shrugs.

INT. GARY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Gary is pacing...

INT. KNQR - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS

The Rent-a-Guard drags a file cabinet in front of the door,

where he has already dragged the couch, some chairs, a garbage

can, two lamps...

INT. SATELLITE ROOM (UPSTAIRS) - KNQR - CONTINUOUS

Three TV's of various sizes and wood veneers are turned on:

one to NBC ("ER") one to CBS ("48 Hours") one to ABC

(toothpaste commercial). On an in-house monitor a leathery

Woman in a leotard does yoga.

Lisa is cabling her laptop into the station's computer. Brian

boots it up: it runs the satellite. Milo cables the data

tower into the laptop.

Cables go in every which direction: the whole set-up has a

distinctly gerry-rigged look.

Go tight on the laptop power switch. Lisa toggles it on.

INT. DAY CARE COMPUTE ROOM - NIGHT

The yellow coordinates start blinking on. Randy sits at a

console.

Gunther and Riman grab holstered guns, race out. Randy types

some more, speaks into the phone:

INT. GARY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Phil hangs up, blows a sigh of relief.

Phil sags gratefully into a chair... only to see Gary plow

past him. At his workstation Gary types, mutters:

The Bosch wall screen fills up with a dark blue background,

longitude and latitude lines...

Gary throws a printed spiral notebook at him.

Gary hits a switch. A wood panel slides into the wall,

revealing a bank of four TV's.

INT. CAR/HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Gunther and Riman speed toward the station.

INT. SATELLITE ROOM - WNQR - CONTINUOUS

Milo slips his disk in the laptop. Lisa cables the video

tower to the laptop.

Lisa reads from Milo's little pad.

Milo types on the laptop.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

Phil reads to Gary as he types.

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

We see the Earth far below. The Skywire Satellite orbits

majestically into frame, shifts five degrees to the left.

INT. SATELLITE ROOM - KNQR - CONTINUOUS

Milo hits enter. Milo, Lisa, Brian, shift their collective

gaze to the three funky TV sets.

"ER" plays, uninterrupted, Dan Rather, Diane Sawyer on ABC,

the Yoga lady, the audio of all four blending in a chaotic

low melange that adds to the tension (particularly the frantic

medical emergency on "ER").

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

EXT. KNQR - CONTINUOUS

Gunther and Riman squeal into the station parking lot.

INT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lisa looks out the window to the parking lot, below. Milo is

typing in coordinates.

Milo hits enter.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

Gary hits enter.

EXT. SPACE CONTINUOUS

A second Skywire satellite shifts regally away from the Earth,

as if shunning the signal.

INT. SATELLITE ROOM KNQR - CONTINUOUS

Milo, Lisa, Brian watch the TV's. "ER" et al.

EXT./INT. KNQR - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Gunther and Riman tear through the barricade the Rent-A-Cop

has erected with ruthless precision.

INT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo cogitates while Lisa reviews the satellite coordinates --

Milo is scrolling the software, trying to figure out which

of a 1,000 possible glitches is getting in the way.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

INT. KNQR - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The Rent-A-Guard drags furniture, props, lights, in front of

the entrance to the satellite room.

INT. ENTRANCE - KNQR - CONTINUOUS

Gunther and Riman have created an opening in the barricade.

They step through it. They hear the racket the Rent-a-Guard

is making upstairs. They head that way.

INT. STAIRWAY/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The Rent-A-Guard is holding a lightstand as they ascend,

guns drawn.

Riman takes the lightstand from him. The Rent-a-Guard puts

his hands up, sidles across the hallway as they tear into

the barricade.

INT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lisa reads to Milo.

Milo types.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Gunther and Riman rip down the barricade, reach the door.

They whip it open, guns drawn. They see:

An empty supply room. [The barricade was a decoy.]

INT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Rent-A-Guard has joined Milo et al in here. He tries to

slide a heavy shelf in front of the door, but it's not yet

in place. Lisa has dialed 911. She's scared.

OS, we can hear Gunther and Riman pounding at the door.

He hits enter. The door is kicked open. Gunther & Riman enter,

Gunther with a gun, Riman still carrying the light stand.

He immediately bashes the KNQR computer with it. Lisa looks

devastated.

He holds up the computer cable, to show Riman it was never

plugged in, anyway.

Gunther knits his brow. He notices Milo: still staring at

the TV screens.

Milo's gaze stays fixed to the screens. Riman grabs him by

the shirt. But Gunther's concerned by Milo's behavior:

As Milo watches the screens, a pixilated, ghostly image begins

to appear on all of them: the animated Skywire logo (lightning

strike, etc.).

Brian lurches across to the laptop, ejects the CD-ROM. It's

beige-colored, says Outpost Word.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

Gary and Phil watch as the Skywire logo gets steadily stronger

on Gary's TV's. Phil is confounded:

We hear a low steady hum.

A CABLE plugged into a dusty wall-port that doesn't even

have a plate on it. Panning along the cable, we widen to

show:

INT. UNFINISHED STUDIO (#21) - CONTINUOUS

In dim construction light, not far from the Sears generator,

Len sits on the concrete floor. The second data tower is

patched into a laptop. The distinct silver jewelcase lies by

the CD-rom drive. Shrot paces:

FOUR TV SETS

Each shows the standard Outpost desktop: Outpost logo, fonts,

colors. [This is the all-purpose interface Lisa created for

to Milo.] A window at the top shows a succession of Obituaries

with photos Lisa has downloaded from newspapers: "Programmer

Dies in Highway Crash;" "Programmer Among Cult Suicides;"

"Programmer Victim of Racial Killing," etc.) The obituaries --

eight of them -- fade up and down in a continuous cycle.

Meantime:

Lower on the screen, the material from the day-care data

tower appears, following the same succession we saw when

Milo brought up Teddy's data, i.e., footage of a young

Programmer at college, surveillance footage of him typing

away (from behind), medical records that describe his

vulnerability or a crime primer that describes his scenario.

Between the obits and the primers, cause and effect is

(eventually) established.

The crowning note is the audio, Gary in VOICE OVER, gleaned

(by Lisa) from the audio version of his own book:

REVERSE ON

Gary watching.

INT. KNQR - SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We hear sirens grow near. Gunther watches the broadcast,

still gripping his gun.

This sounds ominous. Lisa wonders what it means. Milo wonders

what it means. He swallows hard.

A MONTAGE

1. MOVE PAST ROWS & ROWS OF PC's playing surveillance footage,

a crash-scene upload, and an obituary, in a college computer

lab. Students watch, agog.

2. TIMES SQUARE - Pedestrians and motorists (with craned

necks) watch the Jumbo-Tron, now the world's biggest desktop.

In one window, college video of a promising Programmer, in

the other, footage of a cult suicide. (Sometimes the

Programmer in question is simultaneous with his obit,

sometimes not, but the connection by now becomes clear).

3. The cuts accelerate. In a NETWORK CONTROL ROOM, Technicians

flip switches, trying to bring back scheduled programming.

At the NIKKEI, the Brokers are transfixed by what comes over

the Big Board. In a VEGAS CASINO Gamblers sip their drinks

as they watch it on closed-circuit horserace monitors. On a

STREET CORNER, a Crack Dealer watches on his beeper. At a

STADIUM, the Stones play but (tilting up) the Diamond Vision

behind them plays Milo's broadcast. In an ELECTRONICS STORE,

a wall of TV's -- 200 of them -- plays grisly primer footage

for Shoppers. A guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of Outpost

'98 from his basket, returns it to the shelf... In the Day

Care Computer Room, it plays on all the monitors as Randy

moves through the room with a big buzzing electro-magnetic

hoop, which he runs over each tower, wiping out data.

Through all the cuts, we hear Gary's narration:

INT. JUSTICE DEPT. - WASHINGTON D.C. - CONTINUOUS

A group of Government Lawyers, working late (Chinese takeout,

loosened ties) watch with a dawning sense of unbelievable

good luck.

TIGHT ON: A PC SCREEN - Teddy Chin's recruitment file is in

one window, the hate crime footage is in another.

REVERSE: SUNNYVALE LOFT - CONTINUOUS

Larry watches with his start-up partners. His eyes close: it

hurts to see Teddy, again.

INT. LYLE BARTON'S HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

OPEN on a framed photo of Barton, his Wife and Kids. The

broadcast plays, OS.

She comes in. No Barton. The front door is wide open, the TV

is still on.

INT. MILO & LISA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Paintings are gone from the wall, clothes flung around. Move

in on a note pinned to the pillow, as the TV plays.

EXT. OUTPOST CAMPUS - NIGHT

High wide shot: sirens scream as unmarked sedans and squadcars

squeal into the sanctified parking lot.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

Open on Gary's TV monitors, then pan into the room. Phil has

departed; the Outpost Lawyers have taken his place.

The Lawyers suppress their opinion.

INT./EXT. CAR/RURAL ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Gunther & Riman turn off a rural road...

...onto a tarmac. A private jet sits lit up, waiting.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

INT. PRIVATE JET - 35,000 FT. - CONTINUOUS

Continuous dolly past: Gunther, as he takes a Chivas from

the Stewardess; Lyle Barton who slips on his headset; Alice,

sorting through video casettes; Randy & Phil, playing gin

rummy; Brian, eating a hamburger. Meantime:

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

He hands the pad to Gary.

INT. KNQR - SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Milo watches the screens, anxiously.

INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

Gary is reading from the Lawyer's pad.

Gary looks up. The Lawyer nods soberly at the TV's.

In one window, the Skywire code scrolls slowly past. In the

other, it says: "Here's the code for the operating system

that made this braodcast possible. Take it. Use it. Make the

new convergence technologies as free as the Web."

Under the windows, these words scroll continuously: HUMAN

KNOWLEDGE BELONGS TO THE WORLD.

Watching, Gary knits his brow: he looks wounded.

INT. COLLEGE COMPUTER LAB - CONTINUOUS

In the lab that began the montage, move past rows of Students

scribbling madly as the code unfolds, or saving it to their

hard drives.

Off-screen, a Student says, "Well, the genie's out of that

bottle."

FADE IN ON:

TV - PLAYING LARRY KING LIVE

The CYBER PUNDIT chats with LARRY KING.

We are:

INT. SUNNYVALE LOFT - DAY

Larry Lindholm sits on a couch watching TV. MOVERS are

carrying out computer equipment all around him. He tries to

ignore them.

As Larry (King) chuckles, Larry (Lindholm) looks up.

Milo and Lisa wear backpacks. As Milo sluffs his off:

Larry switches off the TV as he comes to his feet. A Mover

passes by, hauling out a monitor. Larry explains:

Larry hugs Milo. Turns to Lisa:

He hugs Lisa, too. A Mover grabs Milo's backpack from the

floor.

The Mover sets it down, moves on.

Milo grabs up his pack, the three of them head away from

camera.
