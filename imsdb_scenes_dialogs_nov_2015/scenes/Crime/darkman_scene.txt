INT. PIER BUILDING - DAY

BANG!!

A shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit

A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy

but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe.

His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough

man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks.

His name is EDDIE BLACK.

In the distance a foghorn moans.

We are pulling back.

Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell

him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell

fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh...

The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge

empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of

his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty

space.

The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches

falling into darkness.

No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy

comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me

outs my property... Does it matter?

Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay...

Another hard-looking man is approaching.

They're drivin' up.

Black nods.

Get their pieces. We got a surprise

for those fuckers.

2 EXT WHARF - DAY

We are tracking towards a chain link fence which is

swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln

Continentals.

The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out,

eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront.

is a well-dressed and immaculately groomed man of forty.

4 SLOW TRACKING - RUDY GUZMAN

wears a powder blue, polyester leisure suit. His nose has

been broken several times from his years in the Mexican

boxing league. He was almost a contender.

5 SLOW TRACKING - SKIP NATICK

walks with a pronounced limp.

6 SLOW TRACKING - TRUMAYNE JOHNSON MC SAM

is a large black man with a quiet, studied cool.

7 SLOW TRACKING - RICK

is a wiry twenty-year old who looks about in short, jerky

motions. He huddles in behind the others. He is

stylishly dressed, with slicked back, black hair. His

protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows.

3.

B SLOW TRACKING - SMILEY 8

wears a permanent psychotic smile.

9 SLOW TRACKING - PAULY 9

is middle-aged and balding. His spare tire hangs over the

edge of his suit pants. He subdues a belch. He raises a

bottle of Maalox and slugs down fifty cents worth. A ring

of white chalky fluid coats his lips.

10 SLOW TRACKING - CORKY CORCORAN 10

has a thatch of blond hair, he spits out tobacco juice

between his wide spaced front teeth.

11 They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, 11

Black's men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies.

Looks like they just got off their shift and now they're

ready to kick some ass.

Okay, against the car, ladies. You're

c gonna stand for a search.

12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12

hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them

down and haul off iron -- lots of it.

Bunch a cuties.

Put skirts on 'em, I'd marry one.

From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The

visitors bare up in silence.

No leg.

I was engaged to a girl with a wooden

Skip brightens.

Yeah? What happened?

15 The dock workers laugh. Black indulges his wens'

laughter, then cuts

okay, let's cut the crap here.

Durant, I got just three things to say

to you. One

He holds up a chubby finger.

I ain't selling my property.

He flashes a second finger.

Especially a bunch of fucks.

He flashes a third finger.

The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for

the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he

continues to hop in place for balance.

Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is

dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level.

Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there

is now...total silence.

ROBERT G. DURANT

the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a

gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of

the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth.

As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black:

Now let's consider my points, one by

one...

puts a full nelson on Black. Trumayne, grabs Black's

right hand and holds it out, fingers splayed, towards

Durant.

One...

21 INT WESTLAKE LAB - DAY - AN ENORMOUS EYE

Making jerky little movements this way and that.

EYE'S POV: AN ENORMOUS NOSE

We pull focus through the nose, then back to sharp focus

again. The nose fills the screen, every pore a cavern,

every blemish a mountain.

Blinking.

The nostrils flare slightly.

Looking.

Still. Suddenly it is hit by a flash of light as -- B-

DEEEE -- we hear the automatic wind of a camera and its

strobe recharging.

B-DEEEEE! B-DEEEE! We get rapid-fire left and right

nose profiles.

The nose belongs to YAKITITO YANAGITA a Japanese graduate'

student wearing a lab smock and glasses with thick, coke

bottle lenses.

plan, in a couple of months your nose

will be on the lips of every

American...

He is feeding the prints into the input slot of a

computer.

22P ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN: 22P

The nose is broken down into thousands of points. As each

point of the nose is removed from the screen, a number is

assigned.

We've finally got the Imager working

how we want it.

24 We pan to the Holographic Imaging Cylinder. The glass 24

cylinder, wired to the computer, glows to life.

25 Peyton glances from the Imager to the computer. He types 25

on the computer keyboard.

Bio-press checks out okay...

He glances to...

As it hums to life. It is a box containing linear rows of

densely packed pins. Tiny servo-motors beneath the pins

allow each pin to rise or fall individually, per computer

command. A smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed

evenly atop the surface of the pins. The sprays halts; the

wet substance glistens. The densely packed pins rise to

programmed heights, molding the solidifying synthetic

substance into an exact replica of Yakatito's nose.

34 INT HUNT CLUB PRIVATE DINING. ROOM - DAY

The Stracks and Julie are seated at a table next to a large

picture window that looks out on the bridle path. Jodhpured

equestrians gallop past in the distance.

Seated across from them are Baron Hugo Von Hoffenstein, a

bald, hook-nosed Austrian aristocrat with a patrician air

and cold beady eyes. He is accompanied by his attorney

Myron Katz.

Liveried waiters are just clearing the table and serving

coffee.

We want to be reasonable here. We

said we were interested in selling the

pier frontage and we are interested in

selling. But frankly Mr. Von

.will not be robbed.

Seventy-five strikes us as a fair

price for this parcel. We're ready to

conclude a deal here and now at that

price.

Then I guess we're only missing one

element here.

What's that?

An interested party.

Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile.

Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for

Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful.

He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie.

He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods.

Wine is poured around.

real estate business, three factors

determine a property's worth. CONTINUED

Katz leans forward, listening.

preparing to toast.

steward.

.There's been a mistake. We ordered

a bottle of '67 Beaujolais Maison

Reme. Is that not correct?

Oui madame. '67 Beaujolais Maison

Reme. Is what I have serve.

Julie pleasantly but firmly corrects him.

No. You have served us a 1981 or

1982. California Beaujolais.

Pleasant, but hardly worth

charging...

Strack Sr., frowning, examines the wine. It's news to him.

Please, Madame! I serve the Reme!

STRACK SR.

Mine tastes okay.

Ms. Hastings, please. The wine is

fine. You're way out of your league

here. I'm sure the wine steward--

plucks the CALIFORNIA

The wine steward whispers sharply in French to the

waiter, then turns back to the table.

Please forgive us. We bring the bel

Julie addresses the baron.

At any rate, our offer stands at

forty-eight...

As she rises:

.And if we can't toast, we prefer

not to drink. These gentlemen and I

have other business to attend to, so

if you'll excuse us...

Strack Sr. rises, angrily. He turns to leave with her,

murmuring under his breath:

STRACK SR.

I told you to make this deal.

Von Hoffenstein calls after them his wine glass held

Permit me, madame! Too fine a vine

not to use for a toast!

35 EXT. HUNT CLUB LOBBY - DAY

As Julie and the Stracks are leaving, Julie. accidentally

brushes against the Steward and exchanges a few words.

Strack Jr. had been watching. He approaches the steward.

STRACK JR.

How much did she pay you?

19.

Monsieur, I don't know what you are

talking about!

STRACK JR.

Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of

Take a look at that model, Julie.

That was my father's dream. Now it's

my dream. Acres of riverfront

The undifferentiated blue resolves itself, as a ripplin

form emerges from it's depths; a completely bandaged head

breaks the surface of the fluid.

A patient is lifted from a hydro tank, the complex water

vessel in which burn patients are treated. He lies

century mummy. Tubes and wires.poke from his body.

We hear the steady beeping of a cardiogram.

multi-axied burn platform. Behind him are other

some still submerged in their hydro-tanks.

He jabs a sterilized needle deep into the bandaged knee. 114

Interns gasp. The resident leaves the pin in the knee

for dramatic effect.

.and he can't even feel it.

With a sharp practiced motion, he plucks out the pin.

PATIENT'S BANDAGED FACE

His eyes still closed. No response.

Of course, there are serious emotional

side effects to this operation. When

the body ceases to feel, when so much

sensory input is lost, the patient

becomes alienated. The mind, cut off

from its regular diet of input, has a

never-satisfied thirst; alienation

gives rise to loneliness, anger;

uncontrolled rage is not uncommon.

And the rage problem is exacerbated by

the chemical effect of severing the

nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow

unchecked through body and brain--

giving him the strength of dozen men.

Hence the leather restraints.

The Darkman switches off the desk lamp and removes a

returns the mask to the bag, then slips it into his

Mahler symphony plays in the background.

He bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that

rests on a marble stand, 'then, grunting under the

strain of the load, he staggers back across the room

to the king-sized bed.

With a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest

out onto the bed. A torrent of golden ICrugerands.

They wash over the bed, so many that some spill over

the sides and clatter to the floor.

Strack pauses for a beat, staring down at the booty,

then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the

floor.

Like a swan he dives.

He rolls, luxuriating in the feel of gold against

flesh, laughter bubbling from his lips.

Gold coins stick to his flushed, sweating flesh, then

slough off, leaving their imprint.

Strack makes swimming motions with his arms, laving

himself with the golden coins--

A knock at the door.

Strack freezes.

Huhh??:!

Julie Hasting's to see you, Mr.

Strack.

He stands. A coin or two falls from his dimpled ass

384 INT. STRACK'S LUXURIOUS STUDY- DAY

Strack enters, tying his tie.

Julie, how sweet of you to come before

our appointed hour... but I expected--

you in something a little more formal.

Didn't Ruth inform you that we have

tickets to Der Fliedermause tonight?

I can't go, Louis. We have to talk.

Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy?

Thank you, no.

I'll have one;_

As he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink.

...Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and

it's quite good--

Louis, I can't see you anymore.

Darling, settle down. Don't be rash.

As you say, let's talk.

142.

You know about Peyton, the man I was

Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was

burned, horribly, horribly burned--I

don't understand what happened but I

know he needs my help.

Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy

down.

.Your news has a bittersweet

flavor... Of course I'm very happy for

you. If there's anything I can do--

the finest medical care can be at your

disposal--burn therapy, recon-

structive surgery. How badly was

he... mutilated?

Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's

sofa, her body wracked with sobs.

... Where is he, Julie?

He's living in an abandoned warehouse.

He's alone... he needs me.

The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks

it up.

Not now!... Who?... All right, I'll

take it in the other room.

He looks up at Julie.

143.

I won't be a moment.

He walks into an adjoining room. He picks up the

phone.

Yes, Franz... And the closing

price?...

She reaches for a tissue. Next to it is.

Strack's briefcase sitting on top of his desk.

Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves closer.

I feel sufficiently diversified...

Franz, it is immaterial to me what the

market is doing. I want you to buy...

A sheaf of papers stick up above the mouth of the

briefcase.

whirls to face him. He stands looking down over her

shoulder.

.I'm sorry you had to find that,

dear. Our relationship didn't need

this further strain.

The fire... it wasn't an accident, it

was you.

Not me personally. I have an employee

who does certain things for me,

unofficially, off the books. Robert

doesn't like to pay taxes.

And now you'll kill me.

Strack_ spreads his arms.

Hardly. You have nothing on me, my

dear, and you'd find the extremely

expensive police department quite

unsympathetic.

(A beat).

Julie. Consider the big picture.

146.

I suppose this is goodbye then.

Julie stares hatefully at him for a beat, then hurries

out the door.

388 Strack moves quickly to the briefcase. He taps

his fingers idly on the coffee-stained document. Then

he hits a button on his desk-top intercom.

Send Robert in.

Strack strolls over to the window and stares out at

his rising city. OS the door clicks open.

ROBERT G. DURANT

enters the room.

Robert! I have good news and bad.

Custom dictates that you render the

bad news first.

You recall the little difficulty with

my father and how you resolved it. We

have a similar situation with Miss

Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has

uncovered some unflattering

information about us.

No problem at all. And the good news?

Your wife died. I'm joking, of

course. No, the good news is that I

know who's behind our little troubles

of late. When you retrieved my

memorandum, you failed to excise the

good doctor.

147,

Westlake? He's dead. I saw to it

myself.

He's alive. I don't like loose ends,

Robert. Finish it.

Okay. Where is he?

Strack smiles.

I believe we have a guide.

You don't have any kids, Robert.

What are you talking about?

Or should I say, Doctor Westlake?

I'm Durant! Robert G. Durant!

Then I'm going to make a mistake.

There's a long beat. The vein begins to pulse on

Durant's temple. His eyes grow predatory, evil.

Where's the girl?

Strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder. He smiles

back over his shoulder.

You want to see the girl? Follow me,

I'll take you to her...

Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative

steps.

certainly worked some mischief.

cautiously behind.

...And I can handle my own problems.

I do whatever I have to do. In fact,

that's how I got my first properties.

realize those dreams.

All I have are nightmares.

Then share my dream. After all, you

and I are pretty much the same. We

the furthest extremity of the growing building. Wind

to an upright.

Strack laughs.

Bring on the strings! Young lovers!

In peril! Separated by ruthless

forces, larger than they!--What a

banal tale. In it, I suppose I play

the villain. But wait, Julie--which

of us is the monster here?!

With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!!

-- tears his face off, tossing it over the edge..

448 The face spins down, whooshing end over end, the wind

flapping it this way and that. On the way down it slaps

against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening

out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels

away again. It spins downward towards a forest of

reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes

in the open foundation below. Finally it lands--splat--

SHRIEKS and reality melts around him as he tastes the

hot soup of rage.

Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders... we spin

into Darkman's eyeball to find--

455 THE ULTIMATE RAGE MONTAGE 455

Nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the

camera; Julie and Strack kissing, naked.

456 Strack's face bobs, attached now to the body of the 456

dunking bird, his nose nearing the ignition of a huge

lighter. As contact is made the lighter explodes in a

shower of gold Krugerands.

457 The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton's unscathed 457

head, bobbing on a freakish and deformed doll's body.

Atop a circus platform, he does an angry jig. He wears

Darkman hurls him up, up into the air.

463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins 463

to fall, yards away from the girder.

There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted

remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in

close-up.

CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.

Take my hand.

Julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers. She

overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his.

It disgusts you.

No.

Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn.

This hand... it used to caress you.

Now it can only tear, rip away at

things.

But you'll perfect the skin. You'll

get rid of the scars.

It's not just the scars. I've changed-

What we had--our life together--it

belonged in the light of day.

He disappears into the darkness.

Peyton!

Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away:

Peyton is gone...

466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466

he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a

construction trailer. A pedestrian reappears on the other

side.

Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he

slips into the pedestrian traffic.

The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she

desperately searches for him, turning people around,

staring at their faces... It begins to snow.

Peyton!

She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into

alien faces in search of the man she loves.

AS WE ROLL END CREDITS

The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians,

any one of who could be Darkman... We continue to pull

back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards,

wherever the crowd spills, into an alley... As a street-
