FADE IN:

INT. TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY

Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi

zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport.

Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the

cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic

loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not

permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that

they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other

automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get

their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is

Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga".

Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE

UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes

shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red

hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside.

He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy

going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.

He starts driving.

He drives for a while.

Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away.  He also

looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du

Bois.

The driver turns around.

Zed nods.

Zed shakes his head "no".

Zed adjusts his watch.

Zed forgets the adjustment for now.

He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror.

The cab driver smiles.

They drive for a while.

He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger

tightly extended together, then he crosses them.

Zed smiles at this and nods.

Zed shakes his head and laughs.

Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.

INT. HOTEL - HALL - DAY

A long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel.  From

around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag.

Zed is right behind him.

They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

The door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed,

walks into the room.

He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and

proceeds to show him the room.

Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.

He points to the telephone.

He motions toward the bathroom.

He opens the closet door.

He points to a control console next to the bed.

Then he pauses at the door before he goes out.

Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money,

he starts fingering through it.

Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which

bills to give him.

He starts to leave.

The bellboy turns around.

The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door.

Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is,

and takes a seat on the bed.

Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit

and lays back on the bed next to the package.  Before he

dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on

the bedside table.

He is asleep.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAY

Zed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in.

Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package.  Inside

of it is a black steel briefcase.

The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it.

On the bedside table we see Zed's watch.  It reads 12:10 P.M.

Next to it is the phone.  Next to the phone is a piece of

folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads:

45.63.53.37.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

Zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his

face and cascade down his body.

He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits

some out with a spurt.

Then he stops, attentive, listening for something.

He turns the shower off.

Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

Zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower.  He makes his

way toward the knocking.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped

around his waist.  He opens it.

In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than

twenty.  She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but

she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with.

Zed opens up the door and lets her in.  She checks out the

room and places her bag on the bed.  Then she makes her way

to the window for a view of the city.

She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to

examine every detail of the room.

She blows a bubble.

She takes a seat on the bed.

Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.

He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself.

She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the

television from the remote console.  A French talk show comes

on.  She changes the channel until she comes to a station

playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu".  She

smiles and sits back to watch.

Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair.  His

pants are on.

She notices his pants.

She stands up and starts to lift her top off.  He stops her.

He lays down on the bed.

She stands there looking at him and then smiles.

Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she

slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her

eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.

Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the

bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants.

She removes the pants and climbs on top of him.  They begin

to make love.

On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays.

Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't

resist during a moment of passion.

She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp.  An IMAGE

overcomes her mind.

They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both

satisfied.

She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.

She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten.

They rest there for a while...holding each other.

She takes the covers and crawls under them, so does Zed.

Zed laughs at this.

Zed nods at this.

Zed reaches over and turns it off from the console.

He nods.

Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.

She doesn't like the sound of this.  She slaps him.

Zed is a little surprised at this.

She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as

she talks to Zed.

She looks back at him.

He decides to put a stop to this once and for all.

He gives her a kiss.

Zed is unable to speak.  They look into each others eyes for

a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in

through the window.  Then she leans forward and gives him a

soft understanding kiss.

INT. ZED'S ROOM - NIGHT

Zed is asleep.  Zoey is asleep in his arms.

There is a knocking at the door.

Zed opens his eyes.

The knock becomes a pound.

Zed gets up and puts on his pants.  Zoey gets up and looks

around.

There is more pounding on the door.

She trots off naked to the bathroom and starts the shower.

Zed walks over to the door and opens it up.

Standing in the hall is Eric, a Frenchman of Zed's age

wearing baggy French-style clothes.

Zed's happy to see him.

They hug.

Eric walks in and starts to notice the traces of wild love

making around the room.

He peeks into the bathroom.

Eric walks into the bathroom.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Eric walks up to the shower and knocks on the door.  Zoey is

obviously surprised to see him.

Eric opens up the door and yanks her out of the shower.

She shrieks.

He drags her out into the room, she is dripping wet.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Zed can't believe this.

She bites his hand.  He yells in pain.

He kicks her in the butt and sends her toward the door.

He opens the door and throws her into the hall.

INT. HOTEL - HALL - NIGHT

Naked, Zoey falls into the hall.

Eric slams the door shut.

She is instantly back on her feet and screaming as she pounds

on the door.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

She is pounding on the door.

Eric listens.

He picks up her clothes and her bag, opens the door, and

throws it into the hall just long enough for her to yell at

him.

He slams the door shut.

Then he turns to Zed.

Zed sits down on the bed.

Zed starts to get dressed

EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHT

The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue

Soufflot is bustling.

Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past

the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.

INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in

Eric's car.  The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is

playing on the radio.

Zed looks over at him.

INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where

Eric's flat is.  On the top landing there is a dead cat

laying.  Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the

door.

There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.

Eric gives it a kick.  No response.

They walk into the flat.

INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a

connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back.  In the

front of the living room there is a small balcony where the

sounds of the city pour in.  The room itself is a general

mess.  A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor.

Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill"

poster.

Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.

Sitting at the table playing cards are three men:  FRANCOIS,

RICARDO, and JEAN.

Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE

and OLIVER.

They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.

They all return the greeting.

Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen.

INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

The kitchen is an absolute pig stye.  Dishes are piled up in

the sink and on the counter.

Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties

it.  He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer

into the glass.

INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.

Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam

costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto

his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.

Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.

Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto

Claude's shoulder.

The monkey screeches.

Again, the hideous creature screeches.

Then Eric interrupts.

Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a

mass of sparks.  They laugh.

Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom.  On the way

Oliver hands him the glass of beer.

Oliver sits down next to Claude.

INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eric's bed has probably never been made.  In fact, this room

looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment.  But,

there is a certain order to all this chaos.  Eric pulls out a

blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.

He places his hand on the blueprint.

Zed smiles.

Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.

He points to the main floor vault.

He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.

He checks the blueprint.

He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."

Eric looks down at the blueprint.  There is a small passage

connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.

Eric looks closely at the blueprint.

INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin.

The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon

squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled

around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.

No one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a

lighter and cooks it to a boil.

Ricardo hands him a cotton ball.

Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture.

He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the

cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe.

Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.

They all laugh at this.

INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and

Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean

is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small

picture.

Jean and Claude laugh at this.

Jean snorts a line.

Claude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head "no".

Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen

laughing.

Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite

Zed.  Francois sits on the floor.

Eric rolls up his sleeve.

Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the

needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes

with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the

syringe, then all the way back in.

He withdraws the needle.

Ricardo lets go of his arm.

Eric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He

looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.

Then Jean takes another snort.

Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting

up, and drinking more beer.

Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some

heroin in it.

They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to

his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a

lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon

of smoke.

Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...

INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris

weaving in and out of traffic.  Next to him is Oliver, and in

the back seat is Zed and Eric.  They're giving the very

stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights.

A car speeds up next to them.  In it is Francois, and Claude,

with Jean driving.  They are racing with Ricardo through the

streets.

The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting

away on the radio.

But before Zed can even look it has past by.

All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160

kilometers per hour.  He tries to calculate what that is in

miles per hour.

Zed is in too much of a blur.  He leans over to Eric.

The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers.

EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT

The two cars are franticly racing through traffic.

INT. JEAN'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it

is they're going to.

Claude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice.

Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke.

EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT

Jean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and

cuts off Ricardo.

INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric.

Eric takes a big hit.

No, Zed doesn't see.

Suddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows.

Eric laughs.

Zed nods.

Zed nods, delirious.

Zed can't believe this.  He's not sure if what he heard was

what he thought he heard.

Then Eric sees something.

They take a sharp turn.

INT. CELLAR - NIGHT

Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are

all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar.

Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.

An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.

Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables

scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for

great acoustics.

ON STAGE

a BAND is playing away.  In the audience sit about TWELVE

FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.

AT THE BUFFET

In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been

set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it.  Behind the

tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and

JOSEPHINE.

Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk

in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle

and Josephine.

Eric hands them some money.

ZED'S TABLE

Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club.

Oliver sits next to Zed.

He starts laughing.

Zed watches the players on stage and then nods.

Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle

of red wine.

He pours Zed a glass.

Oliver passes on the wine.

Zed sips some.  He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's

good or not.

ON STAGE

Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder.

The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a

delirium of music.

The band stands up.

IN THE AUDIENCE

The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats

then right in front of everything.

ZED'S TABLE

Suddenly, Zed notices something...

ON STAGE

Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the

band.

ZED'S TABLE

Zed blinks but it's true.

Oliver and Claude start laughing.

ON STAGE

And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up

with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.

Eric is all smile as he plays with them.  Sweat is running

down his face but he's caught up in the moment.

ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the

stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like

James Brown.

Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back

to a musician.

The set is over.

Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver,

Claude, and Zed are sitting.

EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHT

EXT. BANK - DAY

EXTREME CLOSE ON:  The door to the bank.

Francois puts a sign on the door that reads:  [Closed for

Bastille Day].

INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY HALL - DAY

The sub lobby teller and the sub lobby guard #2 rendezvous

with the sub lobby assistant.

They walk out into the sub lobby.

INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY

The sub level teller and the sub lobby assistant walk into

the sub lobby just as Eric, Zed, Oliver, and the bank manager

start coming down the stairs.

At the sight of Eric and his men the sub lobby guard #2 aims

his weapon but does not fire because of the bank manager.

Eric presses his Uzi against the bank manager's neck.

He doesn't.

After a moments thought about this, and the fact that Oliver

has a sawed-off aimed at him, he slowly puts his gun on the

floor.

They descend down the stairs into the sub lobby.

Oliver takes his gun.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Francois, Ricardo, and Jean have finished herding everyone

behind the teller windows.  Claude is on his way downstairs.

Then, for effect, he kicks a man.

INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY

Claude comes downstairs with his gun raised.

Everyone turns.

Oliver pushes the sub lobby guard #2 and the sub lobby

assistant toward Claude.  Then he hands him a chain.

Claude can barely maintain his enthusiasm.

He takes the two upstairs.

Eric smiles through his teeth at the bank manager.

Then, from one of the safety deposit booths a sound is heard.

All eyes turn to it.

Oliver walks up to it and kicks the door in.  The stodgy

customer is kneeling in it.  He instantly holds his hands

high.

Eric walks up, gun in hand.

He does.

They all make their way down through the sub lobby hall.

INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY

They're herding the men through the hall.

They walk through a doorway into the storage/elevator area.

INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY

Eric pushes the manager and the others through the doorway.

Eric pushes them infront of the Calibre vault door.

He releases the bank manager and stuffs the barrel of his

handgun into the sub level tellers mouth.

The teller's eyes widen.

The sub lobby teller's eyes plead with the bank manager.

Zed is watching the whole affair nervously.

Eric fires.  The back of the sub lobby teller's head paints

the wall red.

The bank manager, shocked as he is, looks at Zed.  He knows

he's an American.

The sub lobby teller's body slumps to the ground.

Eric grabs the stodgy customer and puts the gun to his

temple.

The bank manager is freaking out, but after what was probably

the most horribly agonizing internal debate, he holds his

ground.

He nods his head "yes".

He nods his head again.

After losing about a pound of sweat...

Eric quickly removes the gun from the customers temple and

fires two shots into the bank manager's face.

The bank manager falls against the vault door and onto the

floor.

He starts nodding his head.

Oliver takes the customer upstairs to the rest of the people.

Eric rips off his mask.

Zed off his clown mask.

He charges into the reserve vault area.

INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY

They enter and Eric walks up to a bathroom door.

Eric enters the bathroom.

Zed looks at the bathroom door close.  After a fuming pause

he turns and walks back toward the Poseidon vault door.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Francois peeks through the venetian blinds of the windows to

the outside.

In the meantime, behind the teller windows guarding the

people who are laying on the floor, Jean and Ricardo are in

the middle of a conversation.  Oliver is sitting on the

counter, having just brought the stodgy customer upstairs.

Also here now are the sub lobby assistant and the sub lobby

guard #2.

In the meantime Zoey is on the floor, unsure of what is going

on.

INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Zed opens up his steel briefcase.  Inside of it are all sorts

of electronic gear and tools.

He takes out a tape measure and some callipers and measures

out a point on the vault door.  He marks the point with a

piece of chalk.

INT. BANK - MEN'S BATHROOM - DAY

In one of the stalls Eric is preparing a syringe.  He has

just cooked the heroin and is now tapping on it to get the

bubbles out.

INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Zed takes a power drill out from the briefcase and attaches a

special diamond tipped bit.  He measures the depth he wants

to drill to and then marks the bit with a yellow pencil.

He places his ear to the vault and taps the spot.

INT. BANK - MEN'S BATHROOM - DAY

Eric readies the needle and slaps his vein.  He is shaking

but trying to remain as still as possible.

He places the needle at the end of a track on his arm and

inserts it.

INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Zed starts drilling into the point he marked with the chalk

on the vault door.

INT. BANK - MEN'S BATHROOM - DAY

Eric's eyes roll back into his head as the heroin fills his

vein.

He drops the needle to the floor and sits back to enjoy the

rush.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Zoey is sitting on the floor next to the other bank hostages.

INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

EXTREME CLOSE ON:  Zed's drill bit.  It burrows into the

steel wall of the safe spewing out spiral shavings.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Zoey looks at all the people sitting around her.  They're all

scared.  Jean, Ricardo, and Francois are talking amongst

themselves.

Zoey looks up at them telling the joke.

Jean is already laughing.

Zoey glances at all of the people.  Then her eyes lock with

the concierge security guard.

The concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly.

Zoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg is an

ankle holster with a small .38 pistol on it.  His fingers

begin to unsnap the safety harness on it.

Her eyes widen.

The concierge security guard unsnaps the safety.  Zoey knows

he's going to make his move.

Before they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips

out the .38 and fires three shots.

Two of them hit Ricardo in the chest.  He falls to the

ground.

The other hits Francois in the arm.

In an instant Jean is firing his machine gun into the group

of people huddled on the floor.

Everyone is screaming and trying to get away.

Machine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guard

killing him dead.

Unfortunately, the wild spray of bullets also rips into three

of the tellers, four of the customers, and the loan officer,

killing them all.

People are trying to flee but Claude fires his gun into the

ceiling.

Jean has jumped up on the table and is aiming at the people.

INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Zed looks up hearing the commotion.

Eric comes running out of the bathroom and into the

storage/elevator area.

Zed gets up to go upstairs.

Eric runs upstairs.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Francois is on the ground holding his arm.  He keeps rolling

back and forth in pain.

Ricardo is dead.

Jean, Claude, and Oliver are waving their guns around ready

to kill someone any second.

Claude motions to the dead security guard.

Oliver goes over to the dead security guard, the whole time

waving his gun at people.

He grabs the gun from the dead security guards limp grip.

Eric storms in.  He isn't wearing his mask.

Zoey notices Eric, she remembers him.

Eric looks over at Ricardo and then at the carnage.

Then everybody notices he isn't wearing a mask.

Then Oliver yanks his off.

Everyone takes their masks off.

Then, one of the bank customers, a MALE TOURIST, speaks up.

Eric looks at him.

Eric is tired of this outburst, he shoots him.

Everyone screams.

Everyone is quiet.

Francois is sitting on the floor bleeding from his arm.

Claude nods.

Then, the phone rings.

Everyone looks at it.

It rings again.

Eric grabs a WOMAN TELLER who is crying hysterically and

lifts her to her feet.

He drags her to the ringing phone.

She is crying too hard.

Eric puts his gun to her head.

She slowly picks up the phone.

She pauses, then hands the phone to Eric.

Eric takes the phone and pushes her to the floor.

He puts the receiver to his ear.

Eric motions to Oliver to check the windows.

Oliver runs over and peeks out the blinds.

Eric looks around at the dead bodies.

Oliver is pacing back and forth wildly.  He starts loading

extra ammo into his weapon.

Eric hangs up the phone, and then leaves it off the hook.

Then Eric catches sight of Zoey, their eyes lock.  Eric

smiles and winks.  Then he turns to Jean with a whisper.

Then he takes off downstairs, smiling.  Jean is a little

stumped.

INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY

As Eric walks down the stairs and through the reserve vault

area a look of intense concentration washes over his face.

You can see that a trillion calculations are being made in

his brain...the question is:  are there any answers?

INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Zed is drilling now with a hand drill.  He removes it and

blows into the hole.  Shavings come out.

Eric comes trotting into the antechamber whistling.

Zed looks into the hole.

He has drilled into the vault door, revealing some wiring.

Zed takes out a volt meter from his briefcase and inserts the

two prongs into the hole.

Eric does.

The volt meter's needle jumps.

Zed gets up.

Zed jumps up and into the storage/elevator area with Eric

close behind him.

INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY

Instead of walking upstairs, Zed finds the fuse box right in

the next room.

Eric is a bit relieved.

Zed opens it up.

He looks through the fuses and then finds the one he wants.

Eric smirks.

Zed goes back to the vaults.

INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Zed trots back to the Poseidon vault door and quickly grabs a

little gizmo from out of his briefcase.  It is a little home-

made black box with a series of LED's on it and two wires

coming out of one side with alligator clips on the end.

Three other wires are also coming out of it.

He slips the alligator clips into the hole and latches them.

He then tapes one of the wires to the vault itself.

The two remaining wires he hooks up to a large twelve volt

battery.

He looks toward the door leading to the reserve vault area.

Zed turns on his little box, the LED's start flickering.

The lights go out and then back on.

There is a whirring sound from the vault door.

The LED's quickly go from red to green.

There is a loud, heavy clicking as the vault door unlocks.

Zed smiles and swings the door open revealing the interior of

the Poseidon vault.

Eric comes running in like a kid on Christmas morning.

He and Zed hug.

Zed looks into the Poseidon vault at the passage connecting

it to the main vault.  It is covered by a small locked cage.

Zed enters the Poseidon vault.

INT. BANK - POSEIDON VAULT - DAY

Zed goes to the gated passage which isn't much more than a

window in one upper side of the vault, but it's enough to get

him into the main vault.

Eric is right behind him.

Zed takes a twirl at the combination lock.

Then, there's a gunshot.  The bullet comes from the Calibre

vault through the window and almost hits Zed.

Zed falls backwards onto the floor.

Then there's another gunshot.

The bullet ricochets through the vault.

Scrambling on their hands and knees Zed and Eric crawl out of

the Poseidon vault.

INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

They take cover.

Another shot is fired into the vault.

Zed and Eric look into the vault.

Oliver comes running in with his gun ready for action.

Oliver takes cover and cocks his gun.

Eric peeks into the vault.

Oliver and Eric look at each other and smile.

Oliver and Eric look at each other and shrug.  Then Eric sees

something in Zed's briefcase.  It looks like grey clay.

There is a pause.  During this time Eric takes the clay and

pushes a detonator into it.

Zed starts to grab the plastique away from Eric.  Eric

resists.

Eric creeps into the room and activates the detonator.

Zed and Oliver run for cover.

Eric tosses the bar of plastique through the caged window and

makes a break for it.

There is a huge explosion in the adjoining main vault.  The

walls quake and a fireball bellows out of the caged window,

blowing it open.

The vault guard #1 screams and then goes silent.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Francois, Claude, and Jean are forcing customers to drag dead

bodies into a cube.  The room shakes and everyone looks

toward the hall that leads to the stairs.

The hostages, whose nerves are already shot, start crying.

INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Dust has blown out of the vault and is settling on Oliver,

Zed, and Eric, who is laughing like a madman.

Zed is looking at him like he's crazy.

Eric gets up and walks into the Poseidon vault.

Before Zed follows him he looks at Oliver who doesn't know

what to think.

INT. BANK - POSEIDON VAULT - DAY

Eric laughs.

He points to the caged window.  It's been blown off it's

hinges.

He starts laughing and then crawls through the connecting

passage into the Caliber vault.

Zed, with his briefcase, follows.

Zed crawls through the opening.

INT. CALIBER VAULT - DAY

The main vault looks like what a vault would look like if it

were blown up from the inside.  On the floor is the still

smoldering body of the security guard.  The room is

incredibly smokey.

Zed squeezes through the opening.

Then, Eric, grinning like a schoolboy, emerges from the smoke

with a brick sized bar of pure gold.

The smoke clears and we see that on the far side of the vault

there is a huge platen on wheels with bricks of gold stacked

onto it.

Eric starts laughing.

Zed looks at him like he's crazy.

Zed takes a seat at the vault door.  The backside of a vault

door looks like an incredibly intricate clock.  Zed removes

the Plexiglass shielding.

He squirms out of the entry with the brick of gold.

Zed shakes his head and goes to work setting dials and using

his voltmeter to test electrical points.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Claude is talking to Jean.

Jean surveys the mess, the crying people.

Eric walks in from the rear stairs.  In his hand is a brick

of gold.

They see the gold.

Eric holds the bar of gold up for all the people to see.

Eric shoots her with his Uzi.

Francois, Jean, and Claude look at each other.

Eric slaps him across the face.

Claude is hurt, not physically but emotionally.

Eric pats his shoulder.

Eric turns and starts to walk toward the downstairs.

INT. BANK - REAR STAIRS TO LOBBY - DAY

Eric is whistling while he walks, he pauses to perform a

quick magic trick, then he continues.

INT. RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY

Eric walks into the reserve vault area.

He stops.  He hears something.  A scratching sound.

He looks at it's source, TWO POLICEMEN, decked out in black

flak jackets and gas masks are starting to come out of a

sewer manhole.

Eric's eyes widen.  He takes his silencer out of his coat and

fixes it to his handgun.  Then, like a man with intent to

kill, he rapidly approaches them.

The one who came out of the manhole turns just in time to see

Eric fire into his chest.  Then, Eric aims the gun into the

tight crawlspace and fires into the other man.  For safe

measure he empties his gun into the tiny causeway.

He drops the gun into the hole and then shoves the other

policeman into it.  He then pushes a large utility wagon over

the manhole cover to stop anyone else from coming in.

INT. BANK - REAR STAIRS TO LOBBY - DAY

Eric comes running out from the reserve vault area and up the

stairs to the lobby.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Eric rushes into the lobby.

He puts the phone on the hook.

It instantly rings.

He answers the phone.

He throws the phone to the ground and looks at Zoey.

He grabs Zoey and lifts her to her feet.

Then, the assistant manager stops him.

Eric suddenly calms down.

He pushes Zoey to the ground.

He grabs the assistant manager and at gunpoint forces him to

the main entrance.

The assistant manager is putting up a bit of a struggle but

Eric simply forces him along.

Everyone waits until suddenly they hear a burst of gunfire

from outside.  They all scream.

Eric walks back into the bank, he picks up the phone.

After a little bit of a wait someone comes on the other end

of the line.

He covers the mouth piece.

INT. BANK - CALIBER VAULT - DAY

Zed is sweating as he works away at the back of the door.  He

glances over what he's done and makes a calculation on a

calculator.

Then, there is a groaning sound.

Zed, terrified, spins around.

Another groaning sound.  The vault security guard isn't dead.

His body is charred and he's not moving but he's very much

alive.

Zed can't believe what he's seeing.

He moves over to the body, leaving his work behind.

Zed hovers over the body, afraid to touch it.  He gives it a

nudge with his foot.

The body groans and then exhales the longest exhale ever.

Zed kneels down next to the body.

Nothing.

Zed puts his hand to the neck of the vault guard #1 and

checks for a pulse.

Nothing.

Zed sits there for a moment looking at the corpse, then, like

he wants to get out of there as soon as possible, he

scrambles to the door and starts adjusting several switches.

He has wired a battery to two leads.  He takes out a wire

cutter and snips a wire.

There is a sudden barrage of whirring and clicking sounds as

the vault unlocks.

Zed calls to Oliver from the passage.

INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY

Oliver is staring at the dead bodies of the manager and sub

lobby teller.

Oliver turns the large wheel and opens the Caliber vault

door.

With some amount of energy the door opens.  Standing inside

is Zed.

He steps out of the vault.

Oliver puts his gun down and they go into the Calibre vault.

INT. BANK - CALIBER VAULT - DAY

Oliver sees the huge platen of gold bricks.  Zed puts his

steel briefcase on top of it.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Eric slams the phone down and then in a fit of rage tears the

phone from the wall.

He grabs his machine gun and aims it at the sub lobby guard

#2.

The sub lobby guard #2 braces himself for gunfire.

Eric fires into him.  He is dead instantly.

Everybody screams.

Eric fires into his dead corpse until his gun runs out of

bullets.

Claude puts his hand on Eric's shoulder.

Eric looks at him.

Eric can't believe this.

Then he looks at Zoey.

She doesn't want to say a thing that'll upset him.

She shakes her head "no".

The sub lobby assistant speaks up.

Eric cracks the butt of his gun into the man's face.

He clicks another clip into the Uzi and grabs Zoey by the

collar and lifts her to her feet.

INT. BANK - CALIBER VAULT - DAY

Zed takes the dolly and starts wheeling the platen of gold

out.  Oliver helps him.

They maneuver out of the Calibre vault.

INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY

They come out of the Calibre vault with the huge platen.

They start maneuvering the platen toward an elevator.

They get into the banks private freight elevator.

INT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY

Zed closes the door and pushes the button to go up to the

ground floor.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Eric is dragging Zoey by the hair toward the door when she

grabs his groin and starts squeezing.

Eric lets out a shrill scream and whacks the butt of the Uzi

into her face.

But she won't let go.  Her years as a prostitute have taught

her to ignore pain.

She grabs hold of the gun hand.

A few bursts of the Uzi go off and one shell stitches Eric's

foot red.

Eric lets go and falls to the ground.

Claude, Jean, and Francois suddenly become attentive to

what's going on.

Zoey starts firing the Uzi but can't control it.  She showers

the room with bullets.  She starts to run toward the back

office blindly firing the gun in the direction of Claude,

Eric, Francois, Jean, and the other hostages.

Then, a tear gas cannister break through the top windows and

start clouding the place up.

Eric whips out his switch blade and hops on his bloody red

foot.

INT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY

Zed is waiting for the elevator to arrive.

Zed is frantic.

The elevator doors open onto the ground floor to the sound of

automatic gunfire.  Zed walks out into the back office.

INT. BANK - BACK OFFICE - DAY

Suddenly, from the back office, Zed sees Zoey blasting away

an Uzi and running toward the rear stairwell.  Eric is in the

lobby limping around.  The other gang members are ducking

from her fire.

Then, her clip runs out.

She sees Zed, their eyes lock.  An IMAGE overcomes Zed.  She

runs down the stairs to the back.

Oliver aims his gun to fire and Zed pushes it up.  Oliver's

gun discharges into the ceiling.  Oliver and Zed begin to

struggle.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Zed and Oliver collapse out of the back office and into the

lobby.  They tumble onto the floor.  Eric hobbles over to

them, his gun aimed at Zed.

INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY

Zoe is near tears.  She drops the empty machine gun to the

floor and starts walking toward the sub lobby.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Eric leans down to talk to Zed.  Oliver and Jean are

watching.  Francois and Claude are more worried about the

tear gas.

Eric waves them off with a brush of his hand.  He's

concentrating on Zed.

Eric lifts him to his feet and holds him up against the

knife.  He turns him toward the smoke and whispers into his

ear.

Eric looks at him and gives him a soft kiss on the cheek.

Zed laughs, there's not gonna be much of a pie to eat.

He slashes Zed across the face with the switchblade.  Zed

falls backwards and tumbles down the stairs like a rag doll.

He walks down the hall toward the gold.

Eric walks into the back office.  The others look at each

other.

Suddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the

shadows, Francois sees it and nervously fires.

In the background the distinctive sound of European police

sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank.

Also, an UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICE is blaring orders over a

bullhorn.

Suddenly all of them start firing like blindly into the

smoke.

Francois runs back to Eric who has walked up to the elevator

via the back office.

INT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY

Eric caresses his hand across the bars of gold.

Francois runs in.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Jean becomes a berzerker and runs out into a cloud of smoke

and throws the tear gas container into the thick cloud.

Then he turns to the police and holds his own gun to his

head.

A single bullet passes through his torso.  As Jean falls to

the ground he lets loose a round of gunfire into the ceiling.

Oliver is still firing, his face is red like a crazed man.

From behind the counter the sub lobby assistant grabs a hold

of Claude and wrestles him to the ground.

The other customers start to flee for cover.

Oliver sees the fracas between the sub lobby assistant and

Claude.  It looks like the sub lobby assistant is getting the

upper hand.  Oliver swings his gun around and sprays machine

gun fire at them...killing them both.

INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY

Zoe walks up the stairs out, not only are they locked but a

cloud of tear gas is pouring into the downstairs sub lobby.

Suddenly, Zed stumbles in.

Zed is like a zombie.  Then he notices Zoe in the stairwell.

They lock eyes.

She steps down into the sub lobby, machine guns crackle in

the background.  She runs up to him just as he slumps to the

ground.

She dabs a cloth to his cut face.  He holds it on.

He takes her hand.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

The police are now laying it on heavy.  Francois comes out of

the office.

Francois is ripped into by machine gun fire.

Oliver races past him.

INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY

Tear gas is starting to fill the room.

Zoe stands Zed up.

They start walking toward the reserve vault area.

INT. BANK - FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY

Eric hops into the elevator and closes the door, just as

Oliver runs up, firing toward the police.

Eric is laughing manically as he leaves them behind.

Oliver turns to where the police will surely be coming in.

INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY

Zoey and Zed rush into the reserve vault area.  Zoey notices

that the downstairs reserve vault is closed.

The gunfire upstairs has subsided and has been replaced by

unintelligible POLICE VOICES.

Zoey quietly opens the door opposite the vault that leads to

the rear stairs to the lobby level.

INT. BANK - REAR STAIRS TO LOBBY - DAY

Zoey peeks up the stairs just in time to see Oliver bolt for

the stairs.

A volly of gunfire rips into Oliver but he stands his ground

and fires into the police.

He starts blasting away.

Terrified, Zoey leads Zed to the storage/elevator area.

INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY

The elevator door opens, Eric steps out and looks around like

a caged animal.

Then, Zed and Zoey appear from the hall to the reserve vault

area.

Eric turns to them with his gun raised, when he sees them he

lowers it.

They all stand there for a moment, the gunfire cracking away

upstairs.  Eric is more casual than he should be.

Zoey spits at him.

Eric laughs and aims the gun at her.

Eric smashes the side of her face with the gun and then grabs

a hold of her arm.

Zed tries to stop Eric but Eric aims the gun at him.

Zed rushes Eric and Zoey starts scratching.  Eric drops the

gun but quickly whips out his knife.

She tries to get away from Eric but he has a hold on her

shirt.

Eric swipes at her with the knife and grazes he back.

Then Eric slashes toward Zed who jumps back.

Zoey falls to the floor.

Zed is standing between Zoey and Eric.

She scrambles away.

He swipes at Zed.

Zed jumps back down the hall toward the reserve vault area.

INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA- DAY

They rush out toward the stairs.

He swipes again.

He swipes and Zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade.

Eric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor.

Zed takes this opportunity and kicks Eric in the face.

Eric reaches for the knife.

Zed, his hand bloody, dives onto Eric.

Zoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on Eric's hair.

She plunges her nails into his face.

Zed is rabbit punching Eric from underneath.

Then, Eric grabs a hold of Zed's balls and squeezes.

Zed lets out a shrill scream.

Eric starts elbowing Zoey in the face.

The three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like

worms, unable to move because each is putting the other

through such agony.

Then, Oliver, shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the

room.  His body is a mass of bullet wounds.

He clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near

Zoey, Zed, and Eric.

The sight of the gun gives Eric the strength only a madman

could posses.  He rolls over and throws Zoey off him.

Then, he smashes his forehead into Zed's nose, bursting it.

Eric, deftly, rolls over and grabs the gun.

He gets to his feet and cocks the pump action.

Then he notices the lack of gunfire upstairs.

Eric turns back to them.

He aims to kill Zed.

Then, all of the French policemen, decked out in their

assault gear and wearing gas masks, storm down the stairs.

At the sight of Eric about to execute Zed they raise their

guns.

Eric stops.

It becomes quiet.

Then, Eric looks back down at Zed and braces for the shotgun

kick.

He squeezes the trigger and...

CLICK

The police open fire with their French made assault machine

guns and fill Eric with bullets.  Instead of falling he does

a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red.

The wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over Zed.

An IMAGE overcomes Eric.

Eric's dead body slumps to it's knees and flops on top of

Zed.

Zed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to Zoey.

Zoey runs up to him and holds him.

The police all charge into the secondary vault area and

secure the downstairs.

Zoey is crying as she holds Zed.

The police have their guns aimed at the two of them.

Zoey looks up.

They take their guns away and kneel next to him, seeing if

he's okay.

The other policeman, unable to tell because of Eric's blood,

simply shakes his head.

Zoey starts to cry.

INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY

Zoey and Zed, bandaged up, are being aided by all of the

French policemen as they walk through the bank.

Smoke is still clearing, but the bodies of customers and bank

robbers alike litter the area.

PARAMEDIC's, wearing all white, try to help the injured, they

assist Zed and Zoey.

Zed's attention is caught by two OTHER POLICEMEN carrying a

body bag.

No longer interested in Zoey or Zed, he goes to check out the

body.

Zoey puts her arm around Zed and helps him out of the

bank...never to return.

INT. ZOEY'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

Zoey is driving.  Zed looks like he's been in a burning

building.

He looks at her.

He looks forward at the streets of Paris.

They drive away.
