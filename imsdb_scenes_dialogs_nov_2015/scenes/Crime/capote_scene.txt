TITLE UP:         "Western Kansas, 1959"

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

The CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty

Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At

the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly. The

girl turns and looks past the camera at her MOTHER, sitting

in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway. Her mother shrugs,

motions for her to go inside.

INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The girl walks through the downstairs rooms. In the kitchen,

the PHONE is OFF the hook. The girl looks back toward the

open front door. She turns toward the stairs, climbs them.

INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS

She walks down the hall to a BEDROOM DOOR at the end. The

door is slightly ajar. She knocks, then enters the room.

INT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The girl's POV: the CAMERA pans across the bedroom of a high

school coed. We see the desk, the bureau, the bed. On the

bed lies NANCY CLUTTER, her wrists and legs bound in rope,

SHOT in the head. There is blood on the wall. The sixteen

year-old girl stands immobile. Before she starts to scream,

EXT. KANSAS LANDSCAPE - DAY

Trees ring the edge of a field.

EXT. N.Y. CITYSCAPE, ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

Buildings lit against the night sky.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING/STAIRS - NIGHT

Camera follows group of partygoers as they mount the stairs:

Truman Capote, Barbara (very tall), Rose, Christopher,

Williams.

INT. SMALL, PACKED NEW YORK APARTMENT/KITCHEN - LATER

The friends are standing in the crowded kitchen -- people

are coming in and out -- talking and drinking and laughing.

Laughter.

Laughter. We see Truman watching everyone laugh. GRAYSON

notices, leans in to him. As the rest of the group continues

talking, we come closer, hear their conversation.

Their attention is pulled back into the group as:

Barbara cracks up, chokes on her drink.

EXT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE/BACK PATIO - MORNING

Truman sits with his coffee, reading the New York Times. An

article catches his eye. He sits up straight, folds the paper

over, reads it.

INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY - DAY

C/U of article being snipped out of PAGE 39 of the Times,

November 16, 1959. As the page gets turned around with each

snip, we see a small PHOTO of a middle-aged man wearing

glasses, with the caption: "FOUND DEAD: Herbert W. Clutter,

a wealthy Kansas farmer..." We read the headline: "WEALTHY

FARMER, 3 OF FAMILY SLAIN. Parts of the story: "HOLCOMB,

Kan., Nov. 15 (UPI) -- ...wheat farmer, his wife... two young

children found shot today..."

INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

Truman on the phone.

INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Truman on the phone, on a long cord, travels between the

study and the kitchen as he talks to William Shawn. We hear

pieces of the conversation, and see Truman in different parts

of the room as he says each bit.

Jump to -

Jump to -

JACK DUNPHY (strong, Irish-American, ten years older than

Truman) -- his longtime boyfriend -- enters the front door

with a bag of groceries, stops in the hall. He sees Truman

on the phone. Truman looks at Jack, though he's still speaking

to Shawn --

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS, OUTSKIRTS OF NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

A train barrels toward us, its headlight bright. The train

roars past, away from the city.

INT. TRAIN, MOVING - NIGHT

Truman hurries through the train, checking his ticket with

the sleeper cabins. His long SCARF trails behind. His longer

cashmere COAT practically brushes the floor.

INT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

Truman opens the door. Inside the cabin his childhood friend

from Monroeville, Alabama, NELLE HARPER LEE (yes, that Harper

Lee), is reading. She looks up, deadpan --

Nelle is a year younger than Truman, dowdy in dress, but

smart, tough, sensible. Truman smiles.

He tries to spruce up her limp silk scarf.

TWO BLACK PORTERS enter, one with an enormous TRUNK

(Truman's), the other with a sensible SUITCASE (Nelle's).

He tips them.

The PORTERS leave. Nelle is stunned. Truman fiddles with the

trunk locks, his back to Nelle. Silence, then:

Truman doesn't answer.

Truman won't look at her. She whacks him.

More laughter. More smacking of Truman. Then it is quiet.

INT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - MORNING

Nelle's awake, but still in her bunk, looking out the window

at the Kansas plains. Truman's dressing, watching her.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

TRAVELING SHOTS of harvested FIELDS, grazing LIVESTOCK,

solitary FARMHOUSES.

The TRAIN chugs across the Kansas flatlands.

SHOTS of SIGNS outside Garden City: "World's Largest Free

Swimpool" and "Howdy, Stranger! Welcome to Garden City. A

Friendly Place. "

EXT. GARDEN CITY RENT-A-CAR - DAY

Truman and Nelle rent a car. People stare.

I/E. RENTAL CAR - DAY

Nelle drives past the main square, Truman in the passenger

seat. Truman looks at a photo in THE GARDEN CITY TELEGRAM.

INT. LOBBY, WALKER HOTEL, GARDEN CITY - DAY

Truman and Nelle check in. People stare. Nelle notices.

EXT. FINNEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, GARDEN CITY - CONTINUOUS

Truman and Nelle trot up the COURTHOUSE STEPS.

INT. FINNEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Truman approaches the GUARD DESK.

Truman CURTSIES.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

In the reception area, ALVIN DEWEY and the two other KBI

AGENTS assigned to the Clutter case are getting their jackets

on and straightening their ties. They've completely taken

over the office. They are: HAROLD "Brother" NYE (34); and

ROY "Curly CHURCH (60 - bald). They all smoke.

Sheriff WALTER SANDERSON -- 60's, kind, overweight -- is

office-less (though he and his wife DOROTHY still live on

the fourth floor of the Courthouse.) WALTER lurks in the

background, nowhere to go, emptying one of many FILLED

ASHTRAYS, BOTHERED by the SMOKE. Truman and Nelle enter as:

WALTER looks uncomfortable. Dewey shakes his head at Church.

Silence. The Agents stare at him.

Silence. Nye is looking at Truman, particularly puzzled.

Dewey stubs out his cigarette.

Dewey walks out. Nye and Church start out after him.

Nelle and Truman are left alone.

INT. SPARE COURTROOM - DAY

Packed with PRESS from all over the Midwest, as well as local

Finney County CITIZENS.

Dewey's leading the press conference from a FOLDING TABLE

set up in front of the Judge's bench, flanked by the two

other KBI Agents. He's got a cigarette burning in an ashtray.

Truman and Nelle stand in the back.

Dewey looks at the journalist. Then, evenly:

Lots of folks try to talk at once, one OLD MAN makes himself

heard above the rest:

The room is immediately noisy as Dewey makes his way to the

door, pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, followed

by Church and Nye. He's about to step out when Truman catches

his eye. Dewey exits.

INT. RENTAL CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

Nelle drives while consulting a MAP. Truman is leaning back,

looking out at the passing farms through the window. He speaks

almost to himself.

Nelle glances over at him. He doesn't notice.

Truman looks back out the window at the farms, leans back.

He leans his head out, closes his eyes.

EXT. CLUTTER FARM - SUNSET

Nelle pulls their car to the side of the COUNTY ROAD which

fronts the CLUTTER FARM. We recognize the FARMHOUSE as the

one in which Nancy Clutter was found dead. A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

(20 years old) sits in a CRUISER parked up the driveway.

CRIME SCENE TAPE marks the perimeter of the property. Truman

and Nelle get out of their car, stand at the foot of the

driveway, gazing at the lonely farmhouse.

EXT. HOLCOMB HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

A gorgeous fall day. Crowds of kids arriving at school. Many

are SOMBER. As Truman and Nelle walk toward the kids, some

look warily at Truman and give him a wide berth.

Kids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up

to a group of THREE GIRLS.

The girl glances toward the school entrance where LAURA KINNEY

(who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with DANNY BURKE (tall,

17).

As Nelle leaves, Girl #1 turns to her friend:

Nelle sees Truman on his way toward Laura, calls out --

Truman doesn't hear. She watches Truman approach them. Laura

backs away. Danny leads her off. Nelle walks over to Truman,

looks at him for several moments.

Nelle leaves. On Truman, as the bell rings and the mass of

teenagers starts to enter the school.

EXT. MAIN STREET, GARDEN CITY - DAY

Truman walks alone, sees the Gilbart Funeral Home. He removes

his hat, slips past the few people standing outside.

INT. GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

Warm but slightly tacky. Some people are engaged in hushed

conversation at the reception area. Truman slips past, into

the back room.

INT. BACK ROOM, GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

No people, low light. Four CLOSED CASKETS at the back of the

room. Truman walks over slowly. After a moment, he checks to

make sure he's alone. Then he LIFTS THE TOP of one of the

caskets. It's Bonnie Clutter's body, in a long-sleaved navy-

blue dress; but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of

white cotton gauze, and lacquered with a shiny substance --

like an enormous cocoon. Truman stares.

INT. WALKER HOTEL, TRUMAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Truman on the PHONE to Jack in Brooklyn. One of Truman's

trunks is open, displaying bottles of liquor, packaged and

tinned gourmet food, and stacks of unused yellow legal pads.

He drinks, standing at the window.

On Truman, gazing at the EMPTY TOWN SQUARE below.

EXT. GARDEN CITY, VARIOUS - EARLY MORNING

A SHOPKEEPER sweeps the sidewalk. There are THANKSGIVING

DECORATIONS in his shop window.

A SCHOOL BUS picks up a SMALL BOY at the intersection of a

DIRT ROAD and the paved COUNTY ROAD.

A SMALL BRIDGE over the Arkansas river. Below them, men are

sifting the riverbed with nets, moving slowly downstream.

INT. WALKER HOTEL, LOBBY - EARLY MORNING

Nelle waits by the FRONT DESK. The ELEVATOR DOORS open and

Truman emerges. He is DRESSED SOBERLY -- NO LONG SCARF, NO

LONG COAT. He walks toward Nelle, then TURNS as if he's a

runway model, walks away, turns again and walks back. He

stops a few feet in front of her. Nelle refuses to smile.

EXT. HOLCOMB TOWN ROAD - EARLY MORNING

Danny Burke walks down the road with a bookbag over his

shoulder. Nelle approaches him, Truman keeps his distance.

He shrugs. They walk together.

EXT. LAURA KINNEY HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Laura opens door to Truman and Nelle.

INT. LAURA KINNEY HOUSE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Nelle and Laura Kinney sit at the table. Truman stands at

the counter.

Truman smiles. Laura smiles back, amused, a bit comforted.

They're quiet for a few moments.

Laura stares at him and nods. He's clearly struck a chord.

She goes in the door to the GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT. They see

her through the LACE CURTAINS getting something from her

DESK, which is stacked with books. Truman whispers to Nelle:

Laura returns. She hugs a SMALL BOOK to her chest. After a

moment, she holds it out to them.

INT. RENTAL CAR/EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON

Nelle and Truman walk quickly back to the hotel. Nelle has

the diary open.

She turns the page. The rest of the book is blank.

INT. WALKER HOTEL, NELLE'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Nelle typing. Truman is propped up on pillows on the bed,

scrunching his eyes to remember what was said that afternoon,

then writing quickly on one of many YELLOW LEGAL PADS, handing

the pages of interview dialogue to Nelle. He's exhausted.

Nelle stops typing a moment, looks through the pages Truman

has handed her:

He pushes some pillows aside and lies down.

She turns back to the typewriter. She types. Truman lies

there, looking at the ceiling for a few moments. He closes

his eyes. Nelle knows without looking --

No answer. She keeps typing.

Nelle turns to look at him. He's asleep. She goes back to

typing. Under her breath:

INT. WALKER HOTEL, BREAKFAST ROOM - LATE MORNING

Truman drinks coffee alone, sleepy. He takes a SMALL BOTTLE

of HOT-PEPPER TABASCO from his jacket pocket and shakes it

over his EGGS. He replaces the bottle in his jacket. Nelle

walks into the lobby from upstairs, heads for Truman.

EXT. DEWEY HOME - AFTERNOON

Ding Dong. We see the FRONT DOOR open. Reveal MARIE DEWEY --

pretty, 35, dressed primly -- and her two boys: ALVIN JR.

(9), and PAUL (6), lurking behind, curious. Marie smiles.

Reverse onto Nelle... and Truman, dressed in a DARK SUIT,

hair neatly combed, like an Exeter schoolboy attending a

funeral. Nelle smiles.

Nelle nudges Truman, who hands over his gifts: a BOTTLE OF

J&B, and a PACKAGE of GOURMET SPICED NUTS.

On Nelle and Truman, surprised.

INT. DEWEY HOME, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

A FOOTBALL GAME plays on the television. No one's watching.

We can HEAR Alvin on the phone in his study at the back of

the house.

INT. DEWEY HOME, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Truman and Marie at the stove. Nelle sits at the kitchen

table. Truman has his jacket off and an apron on, as does

Marie. They are peering into a POT OF BLACK-EYED PEAS. Marie

is shaking in drops of HOT PEPPER TABASCO.

Marie smiles at that word used to describe her husband.

Beat.

INT. DEWEY HOME, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Alvin walks toward the kitchen. He smokes. He looks exhausted.

He hears SQUEALS of laughter.

INT. DEWEY HOME, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Alvin enters. They all stop laughing and look at him. nods

to Truman and Nelle.

Silence. Marie sips her drink.

She cracks up.

INT. DEWEY HOME, DINING ROOM - LATER

The remains of dinner. The kids have left. The bottle of J&B

sits on the table, half-empty. Marie's a bit drunk. Everyone's

PLATE is clean except for Alvin's, on which sits a MOUND of

uneaten black-eyed peas. Truman is mid-story.

Alvin knows.

Alvin knows.

It's quiet for a moment, then Marie looks at Alvin.

Finally, Dewey looks at Truman and Nelle.

INT. DEWEY HOME, STUDY - NIGHT

Alvin shows Truman and Nelle the CRIME SCENE PHOTOS from the

Clutter murders. We see the four corpses, BOUND and SHOT,

the bloody footprints in the Clutter basement. Truman and

Nelle stare at the photos of Nancy and Kenyon. Then, quietly --

Truman hands Nelle one of the photos. She looks at it --

EXT. DEWEY HOME - NIGHT

Truman and Nelle are leaving. Alvin and Marie stand in the

front door. Nelle kisses Marie.

Truman smiles.

EXT. GARDEN CITY - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

MUSIC: "Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas..." Main

Street, CHRISTMAS LIGHTS in the TREES.

The HARDWARE STORE, with Santa Claus DECORATIONS in the window

and a "ONE WEEK LEFT TO BUY YOUR GIFTS..." sign.

EXT. CLUTTER FARM - LATE AFTERNOON

Truman and Nelle walk with PETE HOLT (70, very frail) on the

Clutter property. Apples rot on the ground, the trees are

bare, signs of disrepair are beginning to weather the house.

They don't know what to say. Finally, he looks away.

Silence as the three of them look out over the barren fields.

INT. CLUTTER HOUSE, BONNIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK

Just the bed-frame -- the mattress is gone. Truman and Nelle

find her Bible on the bedside table, her bookmark, see the

painting of Jesus walking on water. Pete Holt stands off to

the side, waiting patiently.

EXT. WALKER HOTEL LOBBY, GARDEN CITY - NIGHT

Through the front window we see a Christmas tree in the lobby.

INT. WALKER HOTEL, TRUMAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jazzy Christmas music on the RADIO. Nelle sits in the big

armchair with a drink. She laughs. We HEAR Jack on the phone:

We see Truman wearing a YELLOW SILK SHORT ROBE with white

lace, bare legs. He's on the phone and walking, for Nelle's

enjoyment, back and forth, like a runway model.

He vamps. Nelle laughs.

Goes to the mini-bar to fix a drink.

Truman puts down his drink and marches out of the room, shuts

the door. Nelle's unsure whether she really insulted him.

From the HALL, we hear a WOMAN SHRIEK, and a MAN saying:

Truman runs back in, shuts door. They crack up.

EXT. DEWEY HOME - NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE, ESTABLISHING

Tasteful Christmas lights strung on the BUSHES. A WREATH on

the FRONT DOOR.

INT. DEWEY HOME, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin. Drinks. A FULL ASHTRAY on

the coffee table in front of Alvin. He's distracted, smoking.

Marie holds a WOMEN'S MAGAZINE, checking what Truman says

with what's written there.

Truman looks at Nelle.

Alvin stubs out his cigarette -- though it still burns. He

stands.

He walks out. Silence.

INT. DEWEY HOME, DINING ROOM - LATER

Christmas dinner. Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin have just

sat down. They wait for the Dewey boys -- Alvin Jr. and Paul.

We hear them in the living room horsing around.

It's quiet for a second. Then something crashes and breaks.

Phone RINGS.

Dewey returns to the dining room, pushing Paul ahead of him.

Alvin Jr. enters.

Alvin Jr. leaves. We hear the PHONE being HUNG UP. Alvin Jr.

returns and sits. They all get ready to say grace, then:

Everyone looks at Dewey.

EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE, GARDEN CITY - LATE AFTERNOON

OVER BLACK SCREEN we hear the voice of a RADIO ANNOUNCER.

Slowly, the sounds of a CROWD emerge in the background.

FADE UP ON: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and front

seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people.

Truman watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the

headline in the Kansas City Star: "Police Fear Lynch Mob."

The CAR RADIO is on.

Truman moves from the car into the large crowd. Old ladies;

ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists

INTERVIEWING citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom

of the COURTHOUSE STEPS. We hear snippets of conversation as

we pass. A CITIZEN is being interviewed by a JOURNALIST; a

MOM WITH BABY standing with a FRIEND; a MIDDLE-AGED man in

an overcoat CRYING silently.

Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together

at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the

photographers. They are talking quietly, turn to Truman --

We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A

CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to

the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the

lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens

the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers

get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and

lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH.

Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence.

They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG,

ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American

Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As

he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as

if they are arthritic. Truman stares.

Truman watches Perry, transfixed. Perry seems terrified of

the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd.

His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look

at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the

steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut.

EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE (4TH FLOOR OF COURTHOUSE ) -

MORNING

FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and

a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says "SHERIFF'S

RESIDENCE - PRIVATE". Dorothy Sanderson opens the door.

He presents book. Dorothy, flattered, takes it, reads the

inscription inside.

It is "Other Voices, Other Rooms" and we see on the back of

it the INFAMOUS JACKET PHOTO of Truman at 23 draped sexily

on a couch. Truman curtsies. The PHONE RINGS.

INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Truman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen;

to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy --

she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen.

INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen.

On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the

cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.)

Truman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his

head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth.

The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely

kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several

moments, Dorothy enters, flustered:

Perry sits up quickly, rubs his legs.

She gathers a tray of Truman's PASTRIES, and COFFEE CUPS.

She goes -- Truman starts to follow, then lingers.

Perry's voice is oddly high, whispery -- special words are

precisely enunciated.

Dorothy's in the doorway.

Truman looks at Dorothy, looks back at Perry.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Judge ROLAND TATE, white-haired, imperious, bangs his gavel.

The packed crowd quiets down. Perry and Dick sit at the

defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their

aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70).

Dick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at

the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece

of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a

LARGE PARROT. Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry --

Hickock looks at Weeks. Weeks nods. Hickock stands.

Hickock sits. Truman whispers to Nelle --

Judge Tate looks at him for a moment --

Crowd gets up. Much talk. Truman watches Perry and Dick

through the forest of bodies. They are led away in handcuffs.

Franklin Weeks stands slowly, then begins gathering his things --

he's old and it takes him ages to collect his papers. Truman

watches.

EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE - AFTERNOON

Truman knocks. He holds a PIE. Dorothy answers.

Truman is caught. He smiles.

INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Truman sits near the bars of the cell. Perry draws on a scrap

of paper at the small table. Dorothy watches from the door

to the living room. The BOOK Truman gave to Dorothy lies on

the floor next to Perry's meticulously made bed.

Perry doesn't answer. Dorothy checks her watch, leaves. Truman

takes a bottle of BAYER ASPIRIN out of his pocket.

Perry extends his hand through the bars. As Truman shakes

some aspirin into it --

Perry puts the aspirin in his mouth, CHEWS THEM, holds out

his hand for more. Truman gives him more, which Perry puts

in his pocket for later.

Perry shakes his head. Silence.

Truman nods, not wanting to push this any further. Perry

picks up the book, holds it out through the bars.

Dorothy pokes her head in from the living room.

Perry doesn't answer.

On Perry, considering whether to trust this man.

INT. NEW YORKER, WILLIAM SHAWN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Phone RINGS, WILLIAM SHAWN answers (50, New Yorker editor,

conservatively attired) at a desk looking onto 44th street.

INTERCUT to Truman in a PHONE BOOTH outside the COURTHOUSE.

INT. COURTHOUSE PHONEBOOTH - DAY

INTERCUT to WILLIAM SHAWN'S OFFICE. On Shawn -- he doesn't

know how to begin to respond.

INT. HICKOCK'S JAIL CELL - DAY

Perry has been placed in an adjoining cell for the afternoon.

He COMBS his greased hair in a mirror. A camera FLASHES.

Nelle and Truman sit outside the cells. Franklin Weeks dozes

off to the side. RICHARD AVEDON -- small, dark, wiry,

flamboyant -- is snapping photos of a bare-chested Hickock

in the next cell, particularly his TATTOOS, while Hickock

chatters away.

Perry is embarrassed, glances over at Truman. FLASH.

Perry glances at Nelle. She MOTIONS to him that his SHIRT is

buttoned wrong. Perry fixes it, looks back at her.

Hickock notices Truman gazing at his tattoos -- the one on

his CHEST: the word PEACE, with a cross radiating rays of

light.

Hickock smiles. FLASH. Truman looks over at Perry, sitting

alone. Truman starts to remove his TIE.

PHOTOS, in quick succession: Of Hickock pulling up his sleeve

to reveal his tattoos. Of Perry combing his HAIR. FLASH. The

GRINNING CAT on Hickock's hand. FLASH. Perry looking directly

at the camera. FLASH.

INT. COURTHOUSE - MORNING, ONE MONTH LATER

Series of shots in and around the courthouse:

TITLE UP:             "One month later"

An officer approaches down a long hallway. A janitor cleans

the basin of the water fountain. Spectators are drawn into

the courthouse. The officer opens the courtroom doors. A

crescendo of sounds.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Spectators take seats. The jury files back into the box.

Perry and Dick chew gum. Perry wears TRUMAN'S TIE, and draws

on a pad with a NEW SET OF COLORED PENCILS -- another PARROT,

quite beautiful, now YELLOW. Nelle and Truman sit together.

Truman shrugs. Nelle raises her eyebrows. Judge Tate GAVELS

loudly, looks to the jury.

Perry and Dick stand. Judge Tate turns back to the Foreman.

Judge nods, the foreman sits. Judge turns to Perry and Dick.

He GAVELS. Perry and Dick are set upon by Sheriff's Deputies

and led out. Photographers crowd them. Dick turns to Perry.

Perry looks at him, utterly lost. FLASH.

INT. WALKER HOTEL, NELLE'S ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Nelle sits at the window, smoking. Truman in the armchair,

holding a drink. They've been up all night. Their bags are

packed. Also -- a few packed boxes of written -- in yellow

notepads and many typed pages. Truman glances at his watch.

Nelle looks over at him.

INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE - MORNING

Truman sits next to Perry's cell. Perry lies on the bed,

staring at the ceiling.

No response.

Perry closes his eyes.

INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

FADE UP ON the sounds of a HUGE PARTY in progress. We see a

home-made BANNER reading "Return to Civilization!" The CAMERA

follows NELLE as she walks through the crowd: Gays, straights,

smoke and noise. Society women, slender and beautiful; BEN

BARON pontificating to CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD.

William Shawn talks to a MUCH TALLER WOMAN.

We HEAR Truman before we see him:

We see Truman in the corner entertaining a small group. Jack

Dunphy stands off to the side. Nelle settles next to Jack.

Guests laugh.

Nelle and Jack stand back, watching.

INT. LE PAVILLON RESTAURANT - DAY

Truman is being interviewed over lunch.

The REPORTER laughs. A waiter passes. Truman taps his glass.

Truman takes a last sip of his drink -- utterly serious now.

INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

Truman sits in bed, writing on a yellow LEGAL PAD, surrounded

by PILES of notes. He squints his eyes, concentrating. Jack

enters, delivers a CUP OF COFFEE. Truman doesn't notice.

INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER

Truman is rifling through the boxes, looking for particular

notes. He can't find what he needs. The phone RINGS.

EXT. STREET, BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON

Jack and Truman walk.

They walk in silence for a few moments.

INT. CAR, DRIVING, TWO-LANE KANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

Truman drives alone, concentrating intently. He has to stretch

to see over the dashboard.

EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY (KSP), LANSING - DAY

A turreted, Civil War-era fortress an hour's drive from Kansas

City. Truman pulls up to the GUARDHOUSE.

INT. KSP, WAITING ROOM/WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Truman waits alone, looking at the lone decoration: a campaign

poster, showing a fat man in a suit grinning while holding a

shotgun. Across the bottom it reads: WALK TALL WITH KRUTCH.

A YOUNG PRISON GUARD sticks his head out of the office door.

INT. KSP, WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Wood-paneled walls, government-issue desk. On the wall behind

the desk is a CHART -- a racial accounting of the current

inmate population. It reads: WHITE - 1405, COLORED - 360,

MEXICANS - 12, INDIANS - 6.

WARDEN MARSHALL KRUTCH is fat, coarse, sweaty even in winter.

And it's spring. He's running for Congress -- there are

"KRUTCH FOR CONGRESS" bumper stickers laying around the

office. He's enjoying a chance at a little publicity. The

YOUNG PRISON GUARD stands quietly by the wall.

Pause.

Truman glances at the campaign stickers, the young prison

guard, then back at Krutch.

Truman reaches into his jacket, pulls from it an ENVELOPE

STUFFED with CASH. He lays it on the desk.

Krutch is stone-faced as he regards the money. Finally:

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

The second floor of a small building in the corner of the

prison complex. Decrepit. The one hall is lit by mesh-covered

BARE BULBS in the ceiling. Twelve cells -- six on each side.

Each is 7 by 10 feet, with one small, high WINDOW covered by

bars and wire. The YOUNG PRISON GUARD opens the heavy GATE

at the end of the hall and shows Truman in.

They walk down the row of cells. In one of them we notice

Lowell Lee Andrews (20, white, spectacled, ENORMOUSLY FAT)

peering at his own face 4 inches from a mirror.

Dick is leaning against the bars of his own cell. He smiles.

Truman hesitates for a second.

Truman walks to the next cell.

Truman sees Perry, gaunt, lying on his cot, almost comatose.

Perry's rather striking drawing of a LARGE YELLOW PARROT

sits propped on his table. An UNEATEN LUNCH TRAY lies on the

floor -- a cockroach runs over it. Truman watches, disturbed.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Camera follows Truman as he walks down an aisle with a small

WICKER BASKET. He stops, looks at a shelf.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Truman waits in the check-out line behind a MOM paying for

her groceries. Her SON (3) stands next to her legs, wearing

a little cowboy hat and cradling a TOY GUN to his chest. He

sucks his thumb. Truman and the boy look at each other.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

Truman sits on the chair, his WICKER BASKET on the table. He

has spread out a cloth napkin. A GUARD watches from outside

the cell. Perry lies completely still on the cot. Truman

takes out jars of BONNET BABY FOOD, inspects the labels.

He decides on the CUSTARD jar. He opens it, takes a plastic

BABY SPOON from the basket.

He spoons a bit into Perry's mouth. The GUARD walks away.

Truman leans close to Perry, whispers:

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON)

Perry sleeps. Truman stands against the wall watching him.

He has cleaned up the basket of food. He walks over to Perry's

desk, sees two handwritten notebooks on it: THE PRIVATE DIARY

OF PERRY EDWARD SMITH and PERSONAL DICTIONARY. Next to them,

he sees a pencil SELF-PORTRAIT Perry drew. It's very good.

Truman touches it.

INT. KSP DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (EVENING)

Perry sleeps. Truman sits on the chair watching, waiting.

Perry opens his eyes, looks at Truman.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (NIGHT)

Perry is sitting up a bit, Truman helps him sip a cup of

water. Perry lies back down. He's looking at Truman.

Perry closes his eyes.

INT. CAR, DRIVING - AFTERNOON (NEXT DAY)

Truman drives through the KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY gate,

waves to the Guard.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - EVENING

Perry sits on the bed, cleaned up, wet hair neatly combed,

looking at a few OLD SNAPSHOTS he has saved in a handkerchief.

Truman sits in the chair across from him. Perry hands him a

photo of his mother. Perry speaks quietly.

Perry nods. Truman waits for more. It doesn't come.

Truman's laughs, surprised by the joke, though it's unclear

whether Perry meant it as one. He stares at Perry.

Perry doesn't respond, then --

Perry leans in, motions toward Dick's cell, lowers his voice --

Perry shakes his head. Then, Truman nods toward Perry's

notebooks.

Perry hesitates.

A moment, then Perry reaches for the NOTEBOOKS, hands them

to Truman. Then he hands Truman the DRAWING he did of himself.

Truman regards Perry. Then he looks at the drawing --

On Truman holding the drawing, looking at Perry.

EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Truman walks quickly to his car, holding Perry's DRAWING and

NOTEBOOKS. At the car, he looks back at the dark jailhouse.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - LATE NIGHT

Truman at the desk, PERRY'S TWO BOOKS next to a LEGAL PAD

already filled with notes. He's on the PHONE with Nelle,

paging through the PERSONAL DICTIONARY captivated by it.

INTERCUT with Nelle, in pajamas, sitting on the porch of her

home in Monroeville, smoking.

INT. NELLE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We hear Nelle exhale her cigarette.

EXT. KANSAS CITYSCAPE - VARIOUS (TWO WEEKS ELAPSE)

INT. DINER, DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY - MORNING

Truman is eating breakfast with Alvin Dewey. A WAITRESS

refills their coffees.

She leaves. An uncomfortable silence. Then:

Dewey taps a cigarette out of his pack.

They eat for a moment. Then:

Truman can't decide whether Dewey is kidding or not. Dewey

puts money on the table.

He walks away. Over his shoulder:

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

Truman walks down the hall. He passes Dick's cell. Dick is

lying in bed. Dick rises and smiles widely at Truman.

Truman smiles, puts HIS FINGERS TO HIS LIPS, continues past.

He stops outside Perry's cell. Perry (looking MUCH HEALTHIER)

is drawing at his table -- a picture of the HUGE YELLOW PARROT

swooping down from the sky. Truman watches for a few moments,

then Perry looks at him.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - MOMENTS LATER

The Guard locks Truman inside with Perry.

Truman looks at the Guard -- he leaves.

Beat.

Pause.

Perry just looks at him.

Perry shakes his head.

Perry looks away. A long moment.

Silence. Then:

Truman gives up for now. Sees the PICTURE OF THE YELLOW BIRD

on the desk.

They look at each other.

EXT. BAR, DOWNTOWN K.C. - NIGHT

Truman on the street outside the club at a PAY PHONE. He

talks with Jack in Brooklyn.

Truman's watching a YOUNG GUY standing outside the bar,

looking at him.

Truman follows the YOUNG GUY into the bar.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - LATE NIGHT

Truman sleeps. He OPENS HIS EYES in bed. Turns to the bedside

table to see the drawing of Perry looking at him.

EXT. KANSAS CITY - DAWN

A young drifter stands alone on an empty street corner. He

checks a pay phone for a coin. It's empty.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

Perry is lying on his cot reading an ADVENTURE MAGAZINE --

something to do with finding buried treasure off the coast

of Mexico -- and sucking on the tip of his thumb. After a

moment he STARTLES and looks up.

Truman stands outside his cell. He holds a stack of books:

Perry's PERSONAL DICTIONARY and DIARY, and a new WEBSTER'S

DICTIONARY and THESAURUS.

Perry searches the cell for something else to give to Truman

to keep him there. Then, he stops. He has nothing left to

give, and is unwilling to talk about that night at the

Clutters. He becomes very still. Truman speaks gently --

No response. Truman places the books on the floor just outside

Perry's cell -- Perry's writings in one stack and the new

dictionaries in another right next to it.

He turns and goes. We stay with Perry as Truman leaves. We

hear Dick speak to Truman.

Hear Truman's footsteps receding. Then, a long shot of the

hallway as the Guard lets Truman out the gate at the end of

the row. Silence.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL

Perry looks down at the books sitting on the floor outside

his cell. He crouches, puts his hand through the bars and

touches the cover of the new dictionary. He's alone.

Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then

passing.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE SKY. Sounds of seagulls. Ocean, sand,

cottage houses in greenery set back from the beach.

EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY

The house Jack rented. Jack types on the upstairs deck. Truman

pulls up in an OLD TAXI. Jack looks out over the railing to

the street. Jack emerges on the FRONT PORCH as Truman walks

up the path with his bags. They look at each other. Then

Truman looks around at the incredible garden, the ocean in

the background, and starts to LAUGH.

Title up:              "January, 1962"

Sound of a MANUAL TYPEWRITER over black.

EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

FADE IN on the peaceful outside of the house. Sound of TYPING.

INT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

More typing. A PHONE rings. CAMERA tracks slowly through the

pretty, tiled living room, toward a DOOR at the far end.

INT. BEDROOM, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

Truman at his DESK, surrounded by piles of filled YELLOW

PADS, NOTE CARDS, an open TRUNK of random notes. He is at

the MANUAL TYPEWRITER. The phone is on the floor, ringing.

He types. The phone rings. Exasperated, he picks up.

INTERCUT with Shawn's OFFICE at the New Yorker, NIGHT. Shawn

has a stack of manuscript pages on his desk.

INT. NEW YORKER, WILLIAM SHAWN'S OFFICE

Truman is completely immobile.

On Truman.

INT. KITCHEN, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - MORNING

Truman at the stove watching his tea water heat up. Jack

enters with a HUGE BASKET of WINE and GROCERIES.

He takes one from the basket. Jack starts to unpack food.

Truman looks at him blankly.

He helps Jack put away the groceries. Then:

Truman looks at Jack, smiles widely.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Truman, Jack and Nelle. A BONFIRE, a wind-up Victrola playing

Ella Fitzgerald, bottles of wine. Jack and Nelle dance. Truman

toasts Jack drunkenly.

Jack laughs.

Nelle tries to smack Truman but can't catch him. The song

changes to a slow one. Jack and Truman dance sweetly together.

Nelle sits on the sand and watches.

EXT. UPSTAIRS DECK, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - MORNING

Breakfast. Truman and Nelle are sitting -- Nelle has a small

envelope in her hand. Truman is obviously uncomfortable. As

Jack delivers a platter of omelettes to the table:

Jack sits. Nelle opens the letter, reads:

Pause.

Jack looks out at the ocean.

EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY

Truman and Nelle carry her bags down the front walk toward a

waiting TAXI.

Silence as they load the bags into the trunk.

Truman shrugs, doesn't answer. Nelle kisses him.

Nelle gets in the taxi, then leans her head out the window.

She drives away. Truman watches her go. He turns back up

toward the house, stops a moment to pick a FLOWER from the

bushes at the front gate.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

A Guard walks down the corridor carrying a SINGLE FLOWER. He

delivers it to Perry, then walks off. Perry is confused. He

hears FOOTSTEPS approaching, but can't see who it is.

More footsteps. CAMERA on Perry as the footsteps finally

arrive outside his cell. He's shocked.

REVERSE onto Truman, looking tanned, healthy, very blond. He

holds a STACK OF BOOKS with a BOW on top. He smiles.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - LATER THAT NIGHT

LONG SHOT of dimly lit corridor, light spilling out from

each cell. A ROW GUARD walks the hall. We hear voices

murmuring.

SIX MORE GUARDS arrive at the top of the stairs. The ROW

GUARD walks over, unlocks the GATE to let them in.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT

Perry is looking at the cover of a BOOK -- "WALDEN POND."

Other books sit next to Perry on the cot. Among them -- WILLA

CATHER's "MY ANTONIA", also "GREAT EXPECTATIONS" --

Perry nods, looks at the other books.

Through the bars of Perry's cell, we can see the SIX GUARDS

enter Lowell Lee Andrew's cell (diagonally across the

corridor). The ROW GUARD appears at Perry's cell.

Truman looks at Perry, then back to the Guard.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, LOWELL LEE ANDREW'S CELL - MOMENTS

LATER

The SIX GUARDS start to pack up Andrews cell while he sits

on the cot and watches.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER

Perry and Truman talk very QUIETLY. (Throughout this scene,

we see in the background, across the corridor, the mostly

obscured cell of Andrews. We see his incredibly FAT LEG being

shackled, his belongings being packed in boxes.)

They look at each other and smile. Then:

They watch Andrews being shackled in the background.

Truman regards Perry, who looks down.

Perry nods.

One of the six guards CLANGS Andrews' cell bars with his

stick.

The ROW GUARD opens the cell door. Andrews is led out, arms

and legs shackled, into the corridor.

Andrews is led past Perry's cell. He looks in at Perry.

Andrews shuffles down the hall. Perry watches him go. On

Truman watching Perry. We hear the GATE slam shut.

INT. THEATER - EVENING

Packed. Nelle stands with William Shawn, who receives well-

wishers. BEN BARON enters, seeing Nelle.

Nelle is embarrassed, mostly for Baron, to have the issue of

money brought up publicly.

Baron moves past, Nelle smiles politely, whispers to Shawn.

INT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Truman sits alone. In the background, we can HEAR the noise

of the huge crowd gathering in the theater. Truman wears his

MOST STYLISH LITERARY OUTFIT: a gorgeous dark green Knize

SUIT over a black cashmere turtleneck sweater, and horn-rimmed

GLASSES (which we've never seen him wear before).

He's frozen with anticipation, nervousness. After several

moments a THEATER ASSISTANT opens the door.

The assistant leaves. We hear the crowd quiet down. Truman

rises slowly, walks through the door to the backstage area.

We hear William Shawn on stage.

INT. WINGS/STAGE - NIGHT

Shawn pauses briefly for a laugh that doesn't come. Truman

continues walking toward the backstage curtains.

Truman walks on stage. Loud applause. Shawn sees him, slinks

back to his seat. Truman walks over to the podium, takes in

the enormous crowd. Once it is completely quiet:

People laugh and applaud loudly.

Perry, eating dinner alone at his table, looks up. We HEAR a

LOUD ENGINE revving outside.

EXT. KSP, THE CORNER WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME

Truman's dressing room. Packed with well-wishers drinking

from bottles of CHAMPAGNE, smoking, toasting, shouting to be

heard. Truman in the corner with Christopher Isherwood, BEN

BARON others, laughing. A LITERARY ENTHUSIAST approaches,

leans in.

Truman and Isherwood watch him walk away.

Truman laughs loudly. We SEE Nelle look over from across the

room at her friend having the time of his life.

INT. NEW YORKER, WILLIAM SHAWN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Truman is hung over but immensely gratified. He's with Shawn.

Truman is barely able to suppress his excitement.

Shawn nods.

Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then

passing.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

Truman, flushed, out of breath, stands outside Perry's cell.

He's just arrived. He holds a FOLDED-UP NEWSPAPER. Perry

sits at his table reading LEGAL DOCUMENTS.

Perry looks up, mistaking Truman's state for shared

enthusiasm. He smiles widely.

The Guard opens the cell for Truman. Perry holds up one of

the DOCUMENTS.

Truman enters. Perry goes to him and hugs him tightly.

On Truman, shocked, being hugged.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER

Truman sits on the bed, his coat still on, watching Perry --

hyped up, talking, walking around the cell.

Perry stops.

Pause.

The Guard lets Truman out of the cell.

The Guard shuts the door.

He walks off down the hall. The GATE slams shut.

INT. PERRY'S SISTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Cheaply built ranch house. LINDA MURCHAK (30) walks in the

kitchen back door, shuts it.

Mrs. Murchak looks like a female Perry, dark and small,

attractive and nervous. Through the window, we see THREE

LITTLE CHILDREN playing on a DECREPIT JUNGLE GYM in the yard.

Truman sits at the table, leafing through a PHOTO ALBUM.

She joins Truman again at the table.

We see an OLD PHOTO of the SMITH FAMILY -- Linda at age 8,

Perry (5); their older sister, June; their brother Frank;

and the parents: Florence (American Indian) and John (Irish) --

in front of their rundown truck on a desolate road.

Truman turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (3) and Linda

HOLDING HANDS and splashing in a big mud-puddle in the rain.

Linda is smiling at Perry, who is naked, laughing.

He turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (6) and Linda sitting

on the back steps of a shack, poking with a stick at something

in the dirt. After a moment, she gets up, clears coffee cups.

She picks up the album to put it away.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - NEXT DAY

Truman slows for a moment as he passes Hickock's cell.

Hickock just stares at him. Truman, unnerved, moves on to

Perry's cell.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

Perry doing pushups. He sees Truman and stops. He stands.

The Row Guard approaches.

Truman regards Perry for a few moments, then:

The Guard unlocks the door. Perry STARTS TO MOVE toward it.

The Guard SLAMS it shut.

No response. Perry can barely control his anger.

Perry picks up a cut-out ARTICLE from the NY Times from his

desk. He reads.

He looks at Truman.

Perry doesn't answer.

Perry stares at him, not believing.

Long pause. Truman reaches in his breast pocket and extracts

a PHOTO (the one of Perry and Linda splashing in the puddle.)

He hands it through the bars to Perry. Perry takes it.

Perry looks at the photo. After a few moments, Truman turns

to the Guard.

The Guard unlocks the cell. Truman enters. The Guard locks

up, walks away. Perry is still looking at the PHOTO.

Perry looks at the photo of himself and his sister for a

long time.

Perry sits on the bed. Then, almost to himself:

Truman waits him out, sitting on the chair. Finally, Perry

looks at him. When Perry speaks, it is quietly, completely

matter-of-fact.

INT. CLUTTER HOUSE, NANCY'S ROOM - FLASHBACK, NIGHT

Perry and Nancy. Perry sits quietly on the edge of Nancy's

bed. A SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP softly illuminates a portion of

the face.

INT. CLUTTER HOUSE, ANOTHER PART OF THE BASEMENT - FLASHBACK

NIGHT

KENYON CLUTTER (15) is bound and gagged on an old sofa, a

NIGHT

Bonnie Clutter (40's, small and thin) tied up on her bed.

Perry points the shotgun at Bonnie's face, FIRES. A BURST of

LIGHT.

INT. CLUTTER HOUSE, NANCY'S ROOM - FLASHBACK, NIGHT

Perry and Dick enter Nancy's room, shine the flashlight on

her face. She looks at Perry. She has been crying. After a

moment, she TURNS HER FACE to the wall, as if she knows what

is coming and doesn't want to watch it. Perry AIMS the shotgun

at the back of her head. The FLASHLIGHT switches OFF. The

shotgun FIRES. A BURST of LIGHT.

INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT

Perry and Truman. Perry still on the bed. Truman sits, not

INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Truman enters, drops his travel bag on the bed, zips it open,

removes a SMALL STACK OF TYPED PAGES. He walks to his desk.

On the desk, we see a HUGE STACK OF TYPED PAGES with a title

page on top which reads: IN COLD BLOOD. Truman lifts the

HUGE STACK, places the SMALL STACK under it. He smooths out

the pages, then steps back from it. He calls out:

No answer. On Truman, standing in the middle of his room. He

has finished all that he can finish, and is lost as to what

to do next.

TITLE UP:          "One Year Later"

OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE COME UP SLOWLY:

FADE IN:

Pause. Jack looks at Truman.

Truman stares back. Finally, he turns back to the television.

Jack goes to the DESK and places the telegram on top of a

LARGE PILE OF TELEGRAMS, all from Perry -- all, we should

assume, unanswered.

Jack walks out. Truman sips his drink.

INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER, EARLY EVENING

Truman at the desk, still in PAJAMAS, typing. Jack enters

wearing a TUXEDO, reads over Truman's shoulder. We see:

INT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The PRISON CAR enters, stops. Perry is removed from the back

seat. He stands, looks at the assembled men, looks at Truman.

He's nudged forward. As he passes DEWEY, he extends his hand:

Dewey is caught off-guard so shakes his hand. Perry is led

to the base of the gallows.

Perry is disappointed by this information.

He stops. Several moments.

Krutch can't tell if he's done. Finally, Krutch nods to the

Guard. Perry is led up the STEPS. The Chaplain follows.

The Executioner puts the NOOSE around Perry's neck. Perry

chews his gum. Executioner opens a BLACK CLOTH SACK.

Perry looks at the Chaplain reading prayers, looks at the

crowd, at Truman.

The BLACK SACK goes over Perry's head. Truman watches. He

stands next to Alvin Dewey.

The Executioner pulls the handle, Perry drops.

On Truman. Then a WIDE SHOT of the inside of the Warehouse:

twenty men watching Perry Smith hang, the Chaplain reading.

OVER BLACK:

The SOUND of a TELEPHONE RINGING, as heard through the

receiver. We HEAR the CLICK of the phone being PICKED UP,

then, after a moment, a VOICE:

FADE UP:

INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - EARLY MORNING

Truman sits on the edge of the bed in his WET OVERCOAT, as

if he'd walked in the rain.

Pause.

We hear Nelle light a cigarette.

We hear her exhale slowly.

On Truman,

FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE. AIRPLANE NOISE. COLORS RESOLVE INTO:

INT. FIRST CLASS SECTION, AIRPLANE - DAY

Truman, seated on the aisle, next to William Shawn. After a

long silence, he extracts from his leather briefcase a PACKAGE

wrapped in BROWN PAPER. Hands it to Truman.

The package says KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY and is addressed

to Truman. Truman opens it.

He takes out PERRY'S NOTEBOOKS -- the DIARY and PERSONAL

DICTIONARY. He opens the Diary. Toward the end, he finds

Perry's final entry. He READS silently. We hear Perry's VOICE:

Truman turns the page. It's BLANK. He closes the Diary.

We CONTINUE to hear Perry's VOICE as Truman takes out a

SNAPSHOT -- the one of Perry (at age 3) and Linda splashing

in the puddle.

Truman takes out a PENCIL DRAWING Perry did of him. It's

very good, though Truman looks old and weary in it.

Truman finds, at the bottom of the package, his TIE. He takes

it out, clutches it.

Truman grasps for William Shawn's HAND, finds it, holds on

tightly. Shawn sits stoically, hoping no one will notice.

The CAMERA pulls back, up the aisle. Truman clutches the

tie, and holds on to Shawn's hand, for dear life.

TITLE UP: (each title fades up in succession)

In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in

America.

He never finished another book.

The epigraph he chose for his last published work reads:

"More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered

ones. "

He died in 1984 of complications due to alcoholism.
