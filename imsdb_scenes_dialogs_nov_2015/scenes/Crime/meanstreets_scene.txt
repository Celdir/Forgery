(SUPERED OVER BOTTOM OF SCREEN LIKE A TV NEWS BULLETIN)

(THE FILM IS IN COLOR UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.)

A darkened diffused image of a man lying on the ground. A

tree is above him. The image is more diffused on the edges.

It is black and white, and appears to be coming from a

television. The body of the man is practically totally in

shadow.

A small orange fire appears in the breast of the man.

The small orange fire fades away.

CHARLES CAPPA JR. (CHARLIE) is 25 of Sicilain origin. He

was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one

year and a half at a Jesuit college. CHARLIE was raised

sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected

many of the religion's tenets. He is very intelligent and

has a sharp sense of humor. He is always well dressed. His

favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and

Theodore Dreiser. He likes reading but enjoys films more.

He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges

quotes from it with his friend TONY.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

CHARLIE has been dreaming. The dream frightened him. A

TITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the frame: CHARLIE. He gets

up to look at his face in the mirror. His room is lit by

moonlight. It is a small tenement bedroom with a fire-

escape outside.

He returns to bed and as his head hits the pillow, we hear

the RONETTES singing "BE MY BABY."

An 8-mm. projector whirring away.

INT. PARTY - HOME MOVIES - DAY

Opening TITLES appear over 8mm. HOME MOVIES in which

CHARLIE is shown along with his friends and family in a

celebration...a sense of "one big unending party."

During this opening segment WE SEE some of the characters

that will later appear in the story: JOHNNY BOY, MICHAEL,

TONY, TERESA, CHARLIE'S UNCLE GIOVANNI, and others. They

are all Sicilian and are members of the same Italian-

American neighborhood in New York City. (WE SENSE, from

these HOME MOVIES, that the neighborhood forces its people

to be strongly tied together in a way of life - Family,

Church, Friendship.) These HOME MOVIES were taken during

some formal and casual gatherings in which CHARLIE

participated.

INT. BATHROOM IN A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR

A longhaired "freak" is about to shoot-up. Suddenly the

door opens and TONY (ANTHONY DEVENZIANO) comes in. TONY is

totally different in appearance and dress from the "freak."

He is 25, and a part time student studying liberal arts.

His father is a very powerful racketeer in a different part

of the city and owns several night club type discotheques

and strip houses on the west side of town. One of these is

operated by TONY - "TONY'S PLACE." CHARLIE is one of his

closest friends. TONY is well dressed, flippant and reckless.

He is a big drinker, liquor, wine, and even cough medicine.

TONY rushes over to the "freak", who is too strung out to

defend himself, smashes the needle, and slaps him around.

INT. BAR AREA

TONY pushes him out the door and into the bar area. There

are a few people in the bar...mainly neighborhood guys like

TONY. A few "freaks" are in the BG.

TONY pushes him out the front door.

TONY crosses over to one of the neighborhood guys by the bar

and slaps him in the back of the head knocking off his hat.

TONY pushes the BOY out of the bar also. TITLE APPEARS on

the bottom of the frame: TONY

EXT. WEST SIDE DOCKS - LATE AFTERNOON

The area is totally deserted except for two trucks parked

side by side. Two men are tossing boxes from one truck to

another and looking around furtively. MICHAEL stands nearby.

MICHAEL LONGO is 26 years old. He lives in a different

neighborhood but comes from the same type of background as

CHARLIE and the others. He runs an illegitimate bar and

dabbles in the yearly sale of firecrackers which he smuggles

in from Maryland. He also deals in contraband cigarettes

and runs a small-time "loan shark" business. He has a knack

for business but he is otherwise unintelligent.

Michael crosses over to a '58 black Oldsmobile.

MICHAEL gets in the car. Another MAN is sitting in the back.

He is also well dressed. MICHAEL takes a small lens out of

his pocket and tosses it to the MAN.

The MAN looks at it carefully.

MAN hands adaptor back to MICHAEL.

TITLE APPEARS on bottom of screen: MICHAEL.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A deserted warehouse area in lower Manhattan. Prominent in

the frame is a brightly painted red white and blue mailbox,

contrasting with the drab hues of the neighborhood.

JOHNNY BOY walks down the street toward camera. JOHN

CIVELLO (JOHNNY BOY) is 23 years old. He is an only child

and lives with his mother, a divorcee. He is clean cut

looking, yet slightly radical in dress. He was expelled

from high school for vandalism and consequently spent

several months in reform school. He is reckless,

unambitious, nihilistic, and was classified a psychiatric 4-

F. He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next

door to CHARLIE. He has adopted TERESA'S family as his own

and spends more time with them than he does with his mother.

JOHNNY is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper

under his arm, and he is smiling. He drops the package into

the mailbox and keeps walking. But he is moving a little

faster now and smiling a little more.

Suddenly the mailbox explodes. Dozens of red, white and

blue fragments shower down on the street. The impact of the

blast knocks JOHNNY down. TITLE APPEARS on bottom of frame:

JOHNNY BOY.

He is up in a moment. The CAMERA TRACKS with him as he

starts running. WE SEE that he is grinning - quite

literally - like crazy.

INT. CHURCH

WE SEE CHARLIE full face. Behind him is a Confessional

Booth. The church is very old, quiet, and dark. The CAMERA

ZOOMS OUT to reveal rows of Holy Candles lit in the

foreground. CHARLIE suddenly begins to speak softly and

confidentially to an unseen entity that is OFF SCREEN.

THE CAMERA BEGINS TO TRUCK OUT. IT MOVES AROUND CHARLIE AND

AWAY FROM THE HOLY CANDLES REVEALING CHARLIE'S PROFILE.

THE CAMERA HAS NOW TRUCKED BEHIND CHARLIE AND WE SEE over

his head he has been addressing a life sized statue of the

crucified body of Christ, eyes closed reclining in his

sepluchure.

This conversation of Confession will occur from time to time

in other parts of the story as CHARLIE will periodically try

very casually to justify his thoughts and actions to his

"God." The images accompanying these monologues are to be of

free association almost documentary in nature.

INT. TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT

The club is dark and noisy and smokey when CHARLIE enters.

He greets TONY who is sitting on a bar-stool. TONY directs

CHARLIE to a corner of the club where the rest of the group

is now getting boisterously drunk.

CHARLIE joins in, immediately taking on the mood of the group.

The rest of the club is filled with many different types of

customers: teenagers, adults pretending to be teenagers,

sailors, male and female gays, and "the boys from the

neighborhood." The music is loud and the lights are flashing

but the strippers have not yet appeared.

TONY is at the bar. He is approached by GEORGE one of the

bouncers. He seems upset about the noise that CHARLIE and

his friends are creating. TONY doesn't take GEORGE very

seriously.

TONY smiles.

CHARLIE's zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs. There

is no particular logical sequence except that events are

suited to the rythmic pattern of the music.

1. CHARLIE and his friends dance and sing along with the

2. CHARLIE picks up a billiard stick. He attempts to hit a

3. CHARLIE tries to pull a tablecloth off of a stranger's

4. A punch is thrown at someone. A lit cigarette in the

5. The Strippers finally appear on stage. CHARLIE becomes

6. TONY drinks from a bottle of Southern Comfort, and as a

CHARLIE sitting at an empty table watching DIANE, the

stripper, perform again. He stares glassy-eyed and then

begins to speak softly, continuing his Confession.

Suddenly MICHAEL appears and sits down at CHARLIE's table.

He hands CHARLIE two cartons of cigarettes.

CHARLIE gives him the money.

CHARLIE remains silent.

JOHNNY BOY enters the night club with two friends. He has

been drinking. JOHNNY BOY'S face shows fresh cuts and

bruises. His friends approach the hat check girl and give

her their coats. JOHNNY BOY approaches her giving her his

pants instead. His friends laugh hysterically.

CHARLIE is now alone at the end of the bar. JOHNNY BOY now

completely dressed enters the bar area. CHARLIE watches

JOHNNY BOY approaching and continues his Confession. JOHNNY

BOY greets people as he passes them, and as CHARLIE speaks,

he appears to be moving in slow motion.

TONY is now behind the bar near CHARLIE. JOHNNY BOY has

reached them.

CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY grimace. MICHAEL appears.

TONY mumbles.

JOHNNY BOY interrupts MICHAEL who is about to speak.

The drinks arrive. They all smile and salute each other

with their drinks.

CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are sitting alone at a table.

EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

JOHNNY BOY is walking along the street. It is rush hour and

the traffic is heavy. A shiny, late model car stops parallel

to JOHNNY BOY. The young boy (SAL) signals him by blowing

the horn. (Note that in the FLASHBACK, JOHNNY BOY'S face is

not bruised.)

INT. INSIDE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

As JOHNNY BOY admires the gadgets in the car he notices that

SAL is becoming very nervous.

He turns to look for the speaker and sees a police car not

far behind.

SAL smiles sheepishly. JOHNNY BOY panics.

EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

The police switch on their flashing red light and try to get

closer to them but the traffic is too heavy.

SAL manages to turn the next corner at about twenty miles

per hour.

INT. INSIDE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

JOHNNY BOY frightened now, underestimates the speed of the

car and quickly opens the door.

EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

JOHNNY BOY tumbles from the car only to smack into a lamp-

post. He has seriously banged his head and blood is running

down his face. But because of the near proximity of the

police car he is desperately trying to maintain an air of

dignity as he calmly tries to walk down the street.

INT. TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT

TONY has now joined the group sitting at the table...

CHARLIE and TONY nod in disbelief.

They all get up.

INT. TONY'S PLACE - BACK HALL - NIGHT

They push their way through the crowd and enter a narrow

dimly lit hallway on both sides.

INT. BACK ROOM - TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT

A boy and girl are necking on a make-shift couch in the

darkened room.

Suddenly the light is turned on. TONY, CHARLIE, and JOHNNY

BOY enter the room. The GIRL is startled and jumps up.

JIMMY appears bewildered.

The GIRL and JIMMY sit self-consciously as TONY goes to the

medicine cabinet, takes out a few items and gives them to

CHARLIE. TONY then crosses to the other side of the room

where he removes the blanket which has been covering a large

cage. He reveals a live, young beautiful PANTHER stalking

to and fro.

The GIRL screams.

The GIRL runs out.

Everyone else except TONY, is backed up against the wall,

frightened. The BOYS laugh nervously.

TONY begins to open the cage. The BOYS are now standing on

top of the nearest pieces of furniture.

TONY ignores CHARLIE's warning as he crouches and allows the

animal to wander onto his lap where upon he strokes the

panther gently murmuring to him.

The BOYS watch in silence.

INT. TONY'S PLACE - CORNER TABLE - NIGHT

The Italian song "Malafemina" (a tango-like rythmn) is heard

coming from the juke-box. It is near closing time and there

are only a few customers left in the club, including MICHAEL

and two gays, BENTON and SAMMY, who is getting very drunk.

CHARLIE is at the corner table with TONY and JOHNNY BOY.

CHARLIE is washing JOHNNY BOY'S face with cold water from a

basin. Some of JOHNNY'S blood has mingled with the water.

TONY ignores CHARLIE's half-joking, drunken remarks.

One of the BOYS more casual acquaintances is lying on the

bar, drunk. He begins to sing along with the Italian

music - but very badly.

A well dressed young boy enters the club. GEORGE, the

bouncer, approaches him.

The BOY walks over to a bar stool and sits down. Nobody

acknowledges his presence.

Suddenly the DRUNK on the bar stops singing and sits up,

dazed. His sudden silence causes CHARLIE and the others to

look up at him. The DRUNK stares ahead for a minute.

EVERYONE laughs.

More laughter. Even the BOY at the bar laughs. The DRUNK

rises, still smiling and stumbles off to the mens room.

The Big Bopper - "Chantilly Lace" in playing on the

soundtrack. CHARLIE is playing with a deck of cards.

JOHNNY BOY is sipping his drink and ignoring the conversation.

EVERYONE laughs. JIMMY is drawing on a table top. CHARLIE

wanders over.

CHARLIE leans over. OVERHEAD VIEW shows large crude swastika.

CHARLIE picks up the cards again.

The people in the bar do not respond. CHARLIE shrugs. The

BOY casually leaves the bar and walks to the men's room.

INT. MENS ROOM - TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT

The BOY slowly swings the door open and stares at the DRUNK

leaning over the urinal, half asleep. He takes out his

pistol and calmly shoots the DRUNK three times in the back.

To the BOY's surprise the DRUNK does not immediately fall

dead. Instead, he turns and grabs the BOY by the throat.

They struggle in the open doorway.

INT. BAR AREA - NIGHT

The Italian music is still playing. Everyone in the bar has

frozen in position as they watch the scene.

In his astonishment CHARLIE allows the cards to fall from

his hands.

The YOUNG BOY breaks away from the DRUNK and runs towards

the exit.

The DRUNK, running only on sheet determination, stumbles

along after the boy.

The people in the bar, including CHARLIE, dash behind tables

and jump behind the bar for cover.

INT. TONY'S PLACE - STAIRWAY EXIT

The BOY reaches the exit and fires at the DRUNK from the top

of the stairs. The DRUNK still follows.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE

The BOY runs down the street and disappears into the darkness.

The DRUNK staggers out into hte cobblestone street. His

mind is gone, it is now just a physical matter of the body

being stopped by the presence of a stationary object.

He staggers straight across the street at tremendous speed

smashing directly into a parked car.

EXT. TONY'S PLACE - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE

Everyone (including the two GAYS at the bar) is running out

the back way.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE

MICHAEL and JIMMY turn the corner and calmly walk to his

parked car. As they get into the car CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY

turn the corner.

As they are getting into the car the two GAYS turn the

corner. One of them, SAMMY, is very drunk and is crying

hysterically. His companion BENTON is trying to calm him

down when he notices MICHAEL.

It is obvious that MICHAEL does not want to take them but he

is also afraid of attracting any attention so he quickly

ushers them into the car.

INT. MICHAEL'S CAR - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE

CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are in the back seat. SAMMY crawls

over CHARLIE into the back seat making apologies. BENTON is

forced into the front seat with MICHAEL and JIMMY. They

drive off, with SAMMY crying.

He returns to English.

SAMMY leans over JOHNNY and CHARLIE to see out the window.

He begins to shout at a young boy on the street.

CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY hide their faces.

CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY groan. They are still hiding their

faces.

He pulls the car over to the nearest corner.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE

CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY get out of the car first so that by

the time BENTON and SAMMY are out they are already on their

way down the street. MICHAEL drives away.

BENTON guides SAMMY the opposite way.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAWN

CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are walking down the street on their

way home.

INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

CHARLIE lives in a typical lower east side tenement apartment.

Each room is painted a different pastel color. It is

furnished in miscellaneous styles and from the pictures on

the wall and various knick-knacks around the rooms it is

evident that this is a family apartment rather than a

bachelors pad.

CHARLIE is helping his mother pack a suitcase. Through out

the scene he is addressing her but she is never seen on

CAMERA. The CAMERA PANS following his movements and CHARLIE

directs his conversation always towards but above and beyond

it.

He moves into the bedroom taking more items out of the

drawers. The room is ver small. The paint if peeling.

Over the double bed there is a large crucifix.

INT. CHARLIE'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are lying on CHARLIE'S MOTHER'S bed

in their underwear.

CHARLIE reaches out to grab him.

INT. KITCHEN - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT

JOHNNY is raiding the icebox.

JOHNNY BOY leaves the kitchen and walks towards the bedroom.

INT. CHARLIE'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

JOHNNY BOY is now by the window looking out at the fire

escape mischieviously.

He laughs. CHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY on the back of the head.

JOHNNY BOY gets into bed. CHARLIE goes into the kitchen to

get a glass of milk.

INT. KITCHEN - DAYBREAK

CHARLIE takes a glass of milk from the icebox. He listens

to the sounds of the neighborhood waking up and getting

ready to go to work. He leaves the kitchen.

INT. BEDROOM - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAYBREAK

CHARLIE returns to the bedroom. JOHNNY BOY appears to be

asleep. CHARLIE goes to the window and peers through the

blinds. He sees in the window across the fire escape.

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES. TERESA is going through the various

stages of getting dressed.

TERESA RONCHALI is 30 years, well built, attractive and

intelligent. She is well read and quiet. The salary she

makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically

supports her family. She has epilepsy which has prevented

her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious

relationships with men. She has however, been having an

affair with CHARLIE for the past year. It is a well kept

secret from both families because the families regard each

other as blood relations.

CHARLIE is startled by JOHNNY BOY who is now awake and has

begun to dial the telephone.

He hangs up roughly and returns to his position in bed.

CHARLIE shakes his head with an exasperated smile as if this

was a common occurance. CHARLIE turns back to look at

TERESA but she is no longer in her room.

INT. TERESA'S BEDROOM

CHARLIE is dreaming this sequence. He and TERESA are both

nude. She is lying face down on the bed. He approached and

ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate

sperm - instead blood. They are shocked. The blood is on

the bed, her legs, back, and his hands. Charlie cries out

in pain.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MID-DAY

CHARLIE and TERESA are in the hotel room making love. The

sounds of traffic can be heard from the street below.

They are getting dressed.

CHARLIE checks his wallet.

She hands him a few bills. He hesitates.

She puts the money into his hand.

She kisses him gently.

TERESA is putting on her stockings. A few minutes have

passed.

He gives her a quick kiss on the tip of her nose.

TERESA laughs at this story but her mood changes suddenly.

He takes her in his arms.

INT. HOTEL - BATHROOM - MID-DAY

CHARLIE enters the bathroom to clean-up. He stares at his

image in the mirror for a moment, then makes a face. He

checks the whiteness of his teeth, pulls back his hair, and

checks his complexion. The mirror image begins to speak.

The CAMERA PANS BACK to CHARLIE'S FACE. His mouth is not

moving.

The image of CHARLIE in the bathroom intercuts with stills

from Catholic School text books - vulgar color illustrations

of parables - emphasis on Christ expelling the devils from

the posessed women.

He strikes his breast penitently as he delivers the next line.

Back to CHARLIE in sync.

Stills of girls, sexy pornographic nude magazine spreads.

Textbook illustration of vocations.

CHARLIE in sync.

INT. RESTAURANT - MID-DAY

CHARLIE is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant.

This restaurant was considered an above average business

with quality and prices to match when it was first opened

three years ago. The quality has diminished but the prices

remain the same. As a result the place is dying. CHARLIE

is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. He picks up

a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it.

He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. She

apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on

the table. He takes a menu.

A chubby, middle-aged man, OSCAR, approaches the table. He

is half owner of the decaying restaurant. He is in his

shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are

smeared with grease and dirt. He is tired and disgusted.

OSCAR sits down next to CHARLIE.

CHARLIE shakes his head in sympathy.

EXT. STREET - DAY

CHARLIE is walking down the street on the lower east side.

A noisy religious street festival is being held on the block.

INT. SMALL ITALIAN CAFE - DAY

CHARLIE enters a small Italian cafe and nods greetings to

some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the

room. This cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house, candy

store, luncheonette, and meeting place for CHARLIE'S uncle

GIOVANNI and his associates.

GIOVANNI De STEFANO is sixty. He is well respected and

powerful both in and out of the neighborhood. He became a

head figure not by being introduced formally as was the

custom, but rather by fighting and killing his way into the

organization. GIOVANNI is well dressed but not a stereotype

of an old Mafioso, rather a kindly and intelligent old man.

GIOVANNI converses intermittently in Italian.

A man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in

the corner of the room in the luncheonette area.

CHARLIE points in the direction of a doorway.

CHARLIE walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining

room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at

the very back of the cafe. MARIO is seated with his uncle.

MARIO is forty five years old. He is GIOVANNI'S closest

associate, brought into the organization in the traditional

manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders).

He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to

GIOVANNI, and is very fond of CHARLIE.

MARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man. They are

deep in their private conversation. CHARLIE passes by

unnoticed and walks into the bathroom.

CHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. He

shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the

conversation.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

GIOVANNI and MARIO are calmly sipping their coffee as they

listen to the old man's nervous talk.

INT. LUNCHEONETTE AREA - DAY

CHARLIE is seated at a table. The waitress, MARIE,

approaches and gives him his cup of coffee... The following

scene is reminiscent of a TELEVISION COMMERCIAL.

He pauses to sip the coffee, then shakes his head.

MARIE is disinterested. CHARLIE continues.

MARIE chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table.

CHARLIE'S monologue continues and gradually he falls back

into his CONFESSION. As he talks, the CAMERA PICKS UP

DETAILS of the cafe and the people in it.

From time to time CHARLIE is casually glancing at MARIE who

is busy with her work.

BLACK & WHITE & COLOR

The images now move out of the cafe and the CAMERA REVEALS

aspects of the neighborhood - LIVE ACTION and STILLS:

stores, people, streets, buildings, in short; a concise

vision of the neighborhood. All this is intercut with

CHARLIE mentally stripping MARIE's clothes off with his eyes.

The image culminate in aerial shots of downtown New York

City. (STOCK FOOTAGE)

CHARLIE now sees MARIE totally naked as she serves the

customers.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

GIOVANNI and CHARLIE are standing and talking.

CHARLIE is struck silent for a moment. He listens.

CHARLIE and GIOVANNI are now sitting at a table.

EXT. BEACH - HAMPTONS - DAY

CHARLIE and TERESA are sitting on the beach which is fairly

deserted. There are rented cottages behind them. TERESA

has a book and some papers from which she is supposed to

write a term paper for CHARLIE'S English class.

CHARLIE picks up a copy of Henry James' Portrait of a Lady

and tries to read it. He tosses it aside.

CHARLIE turns towards TERESA and tries to kiss her. She

playfully turns away. But CHARLIE quickly gets bored with

that and doesn't pursue her. She is confused by his actions.

CHARLIE and TERESA already farther up the beach, walking.

They notice a very beautiful house with limousines parked in

front of it.

The house is seen from a great distance. CHARLIE'S VIEWPOINT.

There is great activity...all with a very businesslike air.

They arrive at the cottage.

INT. HAMPTONS COTTAGE - DAY

CHARLIE and TERESA are coming in, putting down the books and

papers.

She caresses CHARLIE. He is still preoccupied.

They embrace.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

CHARLIE'S father is the patient in the bed. The visitors

surrounding the bed are CHARLIE'S mother, TERESA, and

TERESA'S mother. The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER AS WE HEAR the

sounds of mechanical voices coming from the T.V. sets in the

lobby.

TERESA'S mother leans over and whispers into CHARLIE'S

father's ear.

There is no answer. CHARLIE is embarrassed. TERESA'S

MOTHER asks again.

CHARLIE doesn't know how to react. TERESA'S MOTHER looks up

with a half smile in disbelief. The other Visitors give off

a small ripple of nervous laughter, repeating it...in

whispers.

CHARLIE looks about nervously. Through the door of the

hospital room can be seen several of the older patients

gathered around a T.V. in the hallway. They are watching

the races, the announcer's voice is blaring almost

incomprehensibly.

INT. HAMPTONS COTTAGE - DAY

TERESA and CHARLIE make love.

CHARLIE is getting dressed. TERESA is wrapped warmly in the

sheets - still in bed.

They laugh. He crosses to TERESA and they kiss.

CHARLIE gets her the pills and heads out of the cottage for

a walk.

EXT. ROADWAY - HAMPTONS - DAY

CHARLIE is walking along the roadway and looking at the

different cottages. He is carrying a notebook to which he

periodically refers. He stops in front of a luxurious

cottage and checks the address on the signpost with the one

in his notebook beside which is listed the name GROPPI. He

remains standing at a safe distance from the cottage staring

at it. It looks deserted.

EXT. ROADWAY IN FRONT OF COTTAGE - DAY

CHARLIE walks directly to the front door of the cottage and

rings the bell confidently. The door is opened immediately

which startles him. From inside the house we see GROPPI'S

back as he holds the door open. He is in a satin robe. We

can see CHARLIE'S startled face through the partially opened

door.

At that moment a nude girl, her back to the CAMERA appears

in the FOREGROUND. This startles CHARLIE even more.

GROPPI slams the door in CHARLIE'S face.

EXT. ROADWAY IN FRONT OF COTTAGE - DAY

CHARLIE is still standing in front of the cottage. Suddenly

a little boy of about nine appears.

CHARLIE turns in surprise.

The BOY leads him towards a heavily overgrown treed area.

CHARLIE repeats this question periodically as he follows the

BOY. Finally CHARLIE finds himself alone in the middle of a

dense forest with the BOY nowhere in sight. He calls out

but there is no answer. He realizes he's been had.

CHARLIE is trying to find his way out of the forest.

INT. ITALIAN CAFE - DAY

A loud brass band is playing "Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, How You

Can Love" inside the cafe. They are part of a religious

festival and GIOVANNI has invited them in for drinks. In

return they are playing for him. GIOVANNI has been drinking.

The song ends.

Everyone laughs and joins in.

The band begins the song for the second time. CHARLIE

enters the cafe and goes directly to his uncle who embraces

him.

CHARLIE sits next to his uncle and looks around at the crowd

in the cafe which is now singing along with the band.

GIOVANNI is smiling broadly. Loud applause follow the end

of the song and the band tries clumsily to make its way

through the crowd and out of the cafe.

CHARLIE gets very nervous at the mention of GROPPI'S name.

DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT

An old woman is sitting in front of the television watching

JOHNNY CARSON'S TONIGHT SHOW.

GROPPI has entered the room with his back to the camera.

GROPPI leaves the frame. The old woman looks up from the

television.

WE SEE GROPPI walking towards the bathroom.

GROPPI TURNS ON the bathroom light.

GROPPI stands with the gun in his hand. He lifts it to his

head. He puts the barrel into his mouth. He pulls the

trigger.

INT. ITALIAN CAFE - DAY

CHARLIE is visibly shocked.

CHARLIE looks up to see MICHAEL, standing at the entrance of

the cafe. He waves to CHARLIE in a friendly manner. CHARLIE

waves back and GIOVANNI looks up, squinting to see who it is.

MICHAEL does not approach the table. In respect to GIOVANNI

he signals to CHARLIE that he would like to see him outside.

MICHAEL is surprised at being spoken to in such a curt

manner, especially in GIOVANNI'S presence because he feels

he has lost status. CHARLIE and GIOVANNI continue their

conversation.

EXT. STREET CORNER - NEAR CAFE - DAY

Two YOUNG BOYS about 15 years old walk up to CHARLIE.

He points to MICHAEL.

The BOYS go over to MICHAEL.

MICHAEL goes to TONY, who has been standing in front of the

cafe with a group of boys. They talk for a minute, and go

back to the waiting boys.

The four of them get into TONY'S car. They drive to

CHINATOWN.

EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY IN TONY'S CAR

They start to get out.

They give him the money.

The car pulls away.

EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY

The car pulls up at TONY'S PLACE. TONY yells to CHARLIE,

who is standing outside.

CHARLIE gets in.

EXT. NIGHT - IN FRONT OF MOVIE THEATER

The boys are paying for their tickets.

INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

DONOVAN'S REEF is showing. We see a brief scene from the

film which has JOHN WAYNE fighting LEE MARVIN in a big bar-

room brawl.

The boys smile and watch.

EXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE

The two boys from Riverdale are still watching on the

corner, in the dark.

INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

CHARLIE is at home shaving.

CHARLIE is gluing on a fake beard.

Television image of old women mourning their dead in India.

The images are slow motion. The news continues with more

trivial news images...(Washington investigations,

demonstrations, etc.)

CHARLIE grabbing a white robe off his bed. We don't see his

face.

INT. WEST SIDE TENEMENT APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

TONY enters the bathroom, turns on the light and locks the

door. Party noises can be heard in the background TONY is

wearing an overcoat and is dressed as a World War I "dough

boy". Atop his head is a mask, the features of which can't

be seen. He opens the coat to reveal twenty packets of red

Jello. He turns on the hot water in the bathtub and slowly

begins to empty each packet of Jello into the tub of steaming

water.

LIVING ROOM & KITCHENETTE - PARTY - NIGHT

Most of the characters that were at the club the other night

are present at the party. Many of them are dressed in semi-

masquerade outfits. Some are wearing soldiers' uniforms.

One wears a sheet made up to be a Roman Toga. The girls are

in costumes also. All of the costumes are makeshift.

MICHAEL is made up as Dracula, sporting a large cape, semi

tuxedo-type suit, and a drop of blood on the corner of his

mouth. His hair is slicked back to give him a "Bela Lugosi"

look. He is showing a picture of a girl to one of the boys,

proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest. TONY

comes out of the bathroom and passes by. He takes the photo

from MICHAEL. Group attention focuses on TONY now. He

stares at the picture, holds it away from him, then closer

to his face, then sideways and finally upside-down.

MICHAEL grimaces in shock. He spits.

He wipes his lips with his cape.

The guest of honor, the young soldier is very drunk. He is

attempting to open his going away presents, one of which

turns out to be a carefully folded American flag. He

attempts to open it with one great flourish. He fails

however, knocking over the glasses on the table. The group

applauds.

Suddenly, the doorbell rings and everyone looks up. The

door opens and CHARLIE appears, arms outstretched, dressed

as the ressurected Christ - with white robes, fake beard and

hair, and artificial wounds. His arms stretch out wider.

The initial shock wears off and TONY greets him.

CHARLIE enters in mock holiness.

They all laugh. The rock music blares as CHARLIE walks to

and fro blessing all in the room. TONY is delighted with

the scene. CHARLIE sits at the kitchen table, TONY opposite

him, and the others gather around. The party is getting

noisier. TONY gives CHARLIE a glass of ice cubes. CHARLIE

plays the part of a priest, during the Mass when the chalice

is filled with wine and water, TONY pours the scotch over

his fingers first.

CHARLIE lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest

would. He signifies that there is enough in the glass.

TONY then repeats the same ritual with a bottle of soda-water.

Everyone drinks after repeating the toast. The crowd around

them begins to break up as CHARLIE and TONY begin to have

fun with each other. TONY pulls down his mask, revealing a

skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his

mouth. It completes the Dough-boy uniform quite well.

MICHAEL and a few of the others gather around again as they

continue.

TONY leans over towards CHARLIE.

The others around them give mock applause. TONY smiles and

nods his head to them. CHARLIE laughs. They drink. Someone

hits CHARLIE on the back of the head. CHARLIE startled,

looks up.

They all laugh.

INT. SAME APARTMENT - NEXT ROOM - NIGHT

CHARLIE is talking to MICHAEL. The conversation is serious.

CHARLIE has not lost his sense of humor.

He hands MICHAEL a twenty dollar bill from under his robe.

A loud scream is heard from the bathroom.

APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Someone shoved a nude girl into the bathtub which is now

filled with congealed red jello. The boys are laughing and

shoving each other about roughly. CHARLIE comes out of the

next room and walks along in a Christ like manner through

the madness, his arms outstretched. One boy kneels and

kisses the hem of his robe and CHARLIE blesses him. There

is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the

bathroom and near the doorway. CHARLIE promises to save the

sinner as he pushes his way through. He helps the girl

remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the

bathtub. It is obvious that she is quite stoned. She

caresses him and they find themselves kissing. The others

storm into the bathroom and grab CHARLIE.

They drag CHARLIE into the next room where, amidst all the

shouting and laughing, the other members of the party are

placing firecrackers on model airplanes, simulating their

own "dog fight". They are flying the planes out the open

window.

CHARLIE takes everything in stride trying to shout a few

lines over their laughter.

The doorbell rings and TONY answers it. It is TERESA and

she looks very worried.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

CHARLIE and TERESA dash from a tenement doorway. CHARLIE is

still in beard and wig but his robes are open so they give

the effect of being a bulky overcoat.

It is very late and the streets are deserted. At the corner

of the building in question, a few of JOHNNY BOY'S friends

cling to the wall for safety. When they see CHARLIE and

TERESA they call out.

TERESA gets up against a wall. CHARLIE sends her down the

block and she leaves reluctantly.

JOHNNY BOY can now be seen silhouetted against the moonlight

on the tenement roof. He has a gun in his hand.

JOHNNY BOY fires a shot into the air. CHARLIE clings to the

wall with the others. A moment later he makes a quick run

for the doorway of the building across the street. He

enters the building that leads to the roof.

EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - NIGHT

CHARLIE has reached the roof.

He laughs with glee.

He slaps JOHNNY BOY on the back of the head.

The boys below are still clinging to the walls of the

building. JOHNNY is oblivious to CHARLIE'S statement.

He takes out a home made firecracker consisting of glass

cigar tubing filled with gunpowder and a waxed fuse stick

through the top layer of cork. He lights it.

JOHNNY BOY tosses it over the building and it blows up in

mid-air. The boys below rush madly away. Lights go on in

the tenements around them. The explosion was quite loud.

EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT

CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are sneaking over a fence in an old

cemetary which is part of their neighborhood. It surrounds

their church and dates back to the beginning of the 19th

century. No one is buried there any longer.

It is very quiet and dark. They sit and rest. CHARLIE is

still in his makeup.

JOHNNY BOY closes his eyes. CHARLIE looks at JOHNNY BOY and

then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight. It seems

totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in

the distance.

CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take

them off. He projects the image of Christ delivering a

sermon. Music and laughter in the distance catches his

attention. The lights and the music are coming from the top

floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is

having a party. The sound echoes through the streets.

Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open

windows. As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of

the girls. Screams are heard. People run up and down the

fire escape.

CHARLIE has pulled off the robe. He now removes the beard

and wig and has become himself again. He leans over to find

JOHNNY BOY fast asleep on a tomb.

He wakes JOHNNY BOY up.

They leave.

INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

CHARLIE is sitting in the corner. The restaurant is in the

same condition that it was the last time he was there.

While CHARLIE waits for his uncle in his semi-private

corner, a handful of old Mafiosi, invited by GIOVANNI, sit

at another table. GIOVANNI enters with MARIO. The old

Mafiosi are greeted first. They rise and kiss GIOVANNI on

the cheek. CHARLIE is very impressed at their respectful

showing. The waitresses and everyone else in the club treat

them all like royalty.

OSCAR approaches the table where CHARLIE, GIOVANNI, and

MARIO are seated and greets them warmly.

INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - LATER IN THE MEAL

OSCAR sits.

Refering to CHARLIE.

GIOVANNI nods his head yes.

INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - DURING DINNER

CHARLIE is visible awed by GIOVANNI and MARIO'S confidence

and power. He is behaving as if he were at a job

interview...very formally. CHARLIE had often had dinner

with his uncle but this time the conversation is more

pointed. Their conversation is mostly in ITALIAN WITH

ENGLISH TITLES. They are discusssing GROPPI'S suicide.

THE CONVERSATION IS NOW ENGLISH.

IN ITALIAN.

CHARLIE feels that it would be better not to pursue the point.

They all laugh.

They become aware of the T.V. set which is on in the rear of

the back room where they are dining. The news is

on...politics, society, and war.

CHARLIE listen attentively, but obviously has heard

GIOVANNI'S philosophy before.

CHARLIE nods.

INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - COFFEE

The conversation turns to more direct topics while they have

their coffee and ainsette.

CHARLIE nods, feeling very uneasy.

CHARLIE nods.

CHARLIE heads for the kitchen.

INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT

CHARLIE is examining the kitchen closely. A black cook is

working hard, taking a piece of meat off the grill. He

carefully prepares a dish.

CHARLIE smiles and moves in closer to the grill. The cook

is sweating and mopping his brow.

CHARLIE moves in closer and the COOK continues preparing the

food.

CHARLIE hasn't been listening to the COOK. He has become

fascinated with the flames on the grill. They remind him of

an old device from his Catholic School days. CHARLIE brings

his hand forward and closer to the fire, testing the pain of

the "Fires of Hell."

CHARLIE'S hand touches the flame. He winces. Music in.

INT. TONY'S CAR (NEW CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE-TOP UP) - DAY

CHARLIE, JOHNNY, TONY and JIMMY are driving along in TONY'S

car. As they talk, a derelict takes advantage of a red

light to wipe their windshield.

TONY rolls up the window and rolls the car forward a bit to

force the derelict out of the way.

They arrive at the bar.

Boys are in mid-discussion.

JOEY looks at JOHNNY BOY but decides to let it pass. CHARLIE

gives JOHNNY BOY a dirty look. Music is playing on a juke

box. Several girls stand nearby listening to both the music

and the discussion. JOHNNY BOY looks over at them and then

at JOEY.

JOEY, his friends, and the girls all look up. JOEY'S

attitude changes.

The fellows look at each other bewildered.

Nobody knows what a mook is. JIMMY'S attitude now changes.

CHARLIE can no longer control the situation as tempers rise.

JIMMY swings at JOEY. A fight breaks out. JIMMY, CHARLIE,

TONY and JOHNNY BOY are beaten. CHARLIE, not badly hurt

manages to calm everything down. The police arrive to break

up the fight. People look iin as the two cops walk into the

bar. The boys stop fighting immediately as they see the

cops.

In fact, they treat CHARLIE and the others as friends--

helping them up off the floor, dusting off the clothes, etc.

The police search everyone. When they ask who started it--

what happened, etc. everybody including CHARLIE and the

others cover for everyone else. "It was a joke officer"

"He's my cousin" "We were just kidding," etc.

The cops nod. "Play nice now" and leave.

Everyone apologizes to each other. They drink again.

JOHNNY BOY doesn't say a word--just stares.

They drink again. JOEY gives JIMMY the money, JIMMY goes to

count it.

JOEY extends his hand. JIMMY and CHARLIE shake. JOEY

extends his hand to JOHNNY.

CHARLIE and the others "Oh no."

He is interrupted by a flying fist. The fight breaks out

anew. They barely make it to the door. JIMMY is out first,

with his cash. They run down the street. The west side

boys don't chase them but stand by their bar shouting after

them.

JOHNNY is laughing as he runs. CHARLIE yells at him.

They reach the car. TONY heads in first behind the wheel.

The others jump in.

The car starts off.

Garbage and garbage pails are tosses after them as the boys

take off.

INT. TONY'S PLACE

A LONG-HAIRED ROCK GROUP

The lead guitarist holds his guitar out like a machine gun

and strums frantically on it swinging it back and forth at

the audience and then at the rest of the group. As he does

so, the rest of the group falls "dead" over their instruments.

The number is over and they all get up. The place is empty

except for CHARLIE, TONY, and a few others, all of whom have

been listening to the band. They applaude.

INT. TONY'S PLACE

CHARLIE is talking to the leader of the group.

INT. TONY'S PLACE - PHONE BOOTH

CHARLIE is calling TERESA. The rock group is taking a break

before their evening performance and they can be heard

breaking up the session in the background. TONY and the

others are getting the tables ready.

He hangs up.

INT. TONY'S PLACE - DRESSING ROOM

CHARLIE can see the Negro stripper, DIANE, down the hall, in

her dressing room. She is putting on her makeup. CHARLIE

is still very attracted to her. He enters her room.

As CHARLIE continues to talk to her she undresses and begins

to get into her first costume. CHARLIE feels slightly

uncomfortable.

EXT. TONY'S PLACE - NEAR ENTRANCE

CHARLIE bumps into MICHAEL and a friend as he is leaving.

MICHAEL is sarcastic. He points to the parked car in front

of him.

MICHAEL'S plan is seen on the screen as he speaks.

JOHNNY BOY is dragged to the car and MICHAEL'S friend ties

his leg to the car.

JOHNNY BOY'S other leg is tied to the Chrysler.

We see a close-up of a foot slamming down on the gas pedal,

twice. One car heads for the West Side--the other to the

East Side. Tires screech and exhaust fumes fill the air.

All three laugh.

CHARLIE leaves.

INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT

CHARLIE is on the phone trying to locate JOHNNY BOY. TERESA

is pacing back and forth nervously in the background.

CHARLIE hangs up.

CHARLIE turns and smiles at her. He kisses her because he

doesn't feel like listening. TERESA is too preoccupied to

respond. CHARLIE turns.

EXT. NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE

JOHNNY BOY walking through Greenwich Village looking around

as if being chased.

INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT

CHARLIE is kissing TERESA who is still very upset.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE

JOHNNY BOY is making his way back to the apartment by

sneaking along the sides of the buildings in the darkened

street.

INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT

CHARLIE tries to make love to TERESA out of his nervous

energy and impatience at waiting so long for JOHNNY BOY.

TERESA is rejecting his attempts.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE

JOHNNY BOY imagines he is being followed and dashes into the

door of a nearby building and up the stairs.

INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT

CHARLIE is doubly frustrated by TERESA'S rejection of his

attempts at lovemaking because of his concern for JOHNNY BOY.

He becomes sarcastic and abrupt.

CHARLIE doesn't answer. TERESA continues.

CHARLIE laughs. TERESA is visibly shaken but CHARLIE cannot

be bothered.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE

JOHNNY BOY is silhouetted against the moonlight. He makes

his way quietly over the roofs of the tenements and climbs

down CHARLIE'S fire escape.

INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT

JOHNNY BOY is at CHARLIE's window. Through it he can see

TERESA lying on the bed in tears and CHARLIE pacing back and

forth across the room.

He is still talking loudly, JOHNNY BOY doesn't seem to pay

any attention to the fact that TERESA is in CHARLIE'S

bedroom. He opens the window and jumps in, smiling

sarcastically. TERESA and CHARLIE are startled. CHARLIE

grabs JOHNNY BOY by his coat collar.

TERESA is frightened and rushes towards CHARLIE. JOHNNY BOY

reacts to the scene with uncontrolled laughter. CHARLIE is

outraged and slaps him across the face but JOHNNY continues

to laugh. TERESA screams.

CHARLIE flings JOHNNY BOY against a wardrobe, letting go of

his collar.

TERESA is crying. JOHNNY goes into the kitchen and CHARLIE

follows. TERESA stays in the doorway.

INT. KITCHEN - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT

JOHNNY BOY takes a drink of water from the sink as he talks.

CHARLIE is calmer now; calm enough to realize that JOHNNY

has figured out his true relationship to TERESA. He tries

to protect himself.

CHARLIE is embarrassed and TERESA is afraid.

TERESA is crying.

TERESA makes it to the door and opens it quickly. JOHNNY

BOY grabs her to keep her from leaving. CHARLIE rushes

towards them and pulls JOHNNY BOY away. By now, they are

halfway down the hall.

JOHNNY BOY is interrupted by CHARLIE'S fist as it lands a

solid punch on the right side of his hand. TERESA screams

and rushes to separate them.

CHARLIE stops.

CHARLIE rushes JOHNNY BOY towards the stairs. They bump

into TERESA, slamming her against the wall.

TERESA is terrified that JOHNNY BOY will really go to

CHARLIE'S uncle.

TERESA falls, hitting the stairs with a thud. She lies

there moaning and tossing her head. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY

go to help her.

JOHNNY BOY steps over TERESA to go down the stairs. He turns.

CHARLIE is furious. JOHNNY BOY points to TERESA who is

getting worse.

CHARLIE lunges out at JOHNNY BOY shoving him halfway down

the stairs. He has gotten hold of his coat so that JOHNNY

BOY can't leave. Neighbors from downstairs open their doors

and come up the stairs. CHARLIE, in complete panic, tries

to put something into TERESA'S mouth while holding JOHNNY

BOY at the same time. He shoves his hand into her mouth

trying to pry it open but she bites into it. CHARLIE

screams as the blood streams out. He lets go of JOHNNY BOY.

The neighbors take over. One woman appears to know how to

administer aid to TERESA.

INT. CHARLIE'S BUILDING - STAIRS

JOHNNY BOY is halfway down the stairs by now. The neighbor

takes care of TERESA. While CHARLIE dashes down the stairs,

CHARLIE grabs JOHNNY in the ground floor hallway.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE

In the deserted factory section of Manhattan, JOHNNY BOY and

CHARLIE stand next to a corregated metal garage door.

CHARLIE smashes JOHNNY BOY against the door sending

resounding echoes into the street.

JOHNNY BOY is not fighting back anymore. He is on the verge

of tears. CHARLIE smashes him against the door again--again

the crashing sound reverberates in the empty street.

Again, JOHNNY BOY is thrown up against the door.

CHARLIE slaps JOHNNY BOY and pushes him against the door

again.

CHARLIE stops. He digs his hands into JOHNNY'S pockets but

he can't find anything.

CHARLIE stares at JOHNNY BOY for a moment then puts his hand

into his own pocket and pulls out three ten dollar bills and

three ones.

JOHNNY BOY doesn't take it. CHARLIE forces it into his hand.

CHARLIE, calmer now, is feeling ashamed.

He tugs JOHNNY BOY along.

INT. TONY'S PLACE - BAR

CHARLIE takes a drink. JOHNNY BOY sits at the bar. The

place is beginning to empty and the show is over. CHARLIE

takes TONY aside.

He turns to JOHNNY BOY.

JOHNNY orders a drink.

INT. CAB - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE

CHARLIE gets into the cab.

The cab takes off. They soon arrive at their destination.

CHARLIE leans back into the seat and peeks out the window.

CHARLIE looks out the window and sees DIANE, the negro

stripper. She is standing on the corner waiting for him.

CHARLIE nods his head for the driver to stop.

The car drives away, passing DIANE who is on the corner.

INT. TONY'S PLACE

CHARLIE is back inside the club.

TONY sets up drinks for them and pours them into shot glasses.

CHARLIE strikes a match and lights each glass... little blue

flames dance along the rims of the glasses.

He blows out the flames. CHARLIE moves to the other and of

the room with his drink.

A young couple, two of the few people left in the place, are

having a hushed quarrel at the end of the bar. The boy

leaves for the men's room.

CHARLIE approaches the girl.

The girl looks at him, first embarrassed, then annoyed.

The girl laughs. Her boyfriend comes out of the men's room.

He has her coat in his hand.

CHARLIE reaches over and grabs the GIRL'S arm tightly. She

looks up, startled, and the boy appears to be frightened.

The GIRL is really scared now.

CHARLIE won't let go of her arm. She tries to pull away but

his grip tightens.

The GIRL is in tears.

He is holding her so tightly that she is doubling over in

pain. The BOY, although he is scared, lunges at CHARLIE.

There is a brief scuffle which TONY breaks up.

EXT. TONY'S PLACE - BACK ALLEY - BLACK AND WHITE - NIGHT

JOHNNY BOY is lifting the lid of a garbage pail. He takes

out a brown paper bag and opens it. He takes a small .22

pistol from it and puts it inside his jacket, then replaces

the bag in the garbage pail.

INT. TONY'S PLACE - BAR AREA

MICHAEL has entered the club. The BOY and GIRL are gone.

TONY is with CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY, whose return went

unnoticed.

MICHAEL has two friends with him.

JOHNNY BOY takes out a ten dollar bill and hands it to him.

CHARLIE is stunned.

MICHAEL takes the ten dollars, crumples it and flings it

into JOHNNY BOY'S face. JOHNNY BOY picks it up and slowly

smooths it out. He sets it on fire as he talks.

MICHAEL lashes out at JOHNNY BOY with the back of his hand.

JOHNNY BOY tosses the flaming bill at MICHAEL and quickly

pulls out his .22 pistol. Everyone is shocked.

JOHNNY BOY doesn't answer but holds the gun straight at

MICHAEL'S face. MICHAEL turns to go, defying JOHNNY BOY.

His friends follow. When he reaches the doorway, he turns.

They leave.

JOHNNY BOY is still frozen with the gun in his hand, pointing

it at mid-air. CHARLIE slams JOHNNY BOY across the face

with his fist. TONY takes the gun from his hand.

He hits JOHNNY BOY again.

CHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY again.

SCENE FROM "TOMB OF LIGEIA"

A young girl is in her room with her maid. The maid is

helping her dress. Eerie music creates a frightening

atmosphere. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY watch nervously affected

by the film's mood. The theatre is a 42nd street one with

lots of sleeping drunks.

Suddenly, the maid's face begins to contort as if she's

seeing something horrible. The audience is on edge. The

young girl sees the maid and shouts "What is it?" - but the

maid only sneezes.

EXT. NIGHT - TONY'S CONVERTIBLE - BLACK AND WHITE

CHARLIE is driving. JOHNNY BOY is beside him in the front

seat. The top od the car is down and CHARLIE is driving

with no particular destination in mind.

JOHNNY BOY turns away and tunes in the radio to a loud rock

song.

JOHNNY BOY opens his eyes.

He turns up the radio.

A black sedan has been driving along parallel to CHARLIE'S

car, unnoticed by CHARLIE. Otherwise the street is deserted.

The car begins to drive CHARLIE off the road.

EXT. NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE

BLACK SEDAN - MICHAEL AND ANOTHER BOY.

CHARLIE turns his head to look. JOHNNY BOY looks up. They

fire the gun.

FULL COLOR SHOTS

A barage of bullets (5 gunshots) hit CHARLIE'S car. CHARLIE

is hit in the hand. JOHNNY BOY has been hit in the throat.

He stands up and leans over the windshield of the car,

spewing blood onto it and into the wind. He is screaming.

The black sedan turns onto another street.

CHARLIE is so shocked that the car is completely out of

control. It goes screeching along the street, swerves, and

slams into a fire hydrant, breaking it off and causing water

to shoot out onto the sidewalk, car and street. CHARLIE has

been thrown from the car. He kneels in the street holding

his wrist. He is on the yellow letters "FIRE LANE." JOHNNY

BOY lies against the side of a building--still. CHARLIE

goes to the curb and sits there holding his bleeding hand.

The police arrive with their guns drawn.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

Back in the neighborhood, the religious fiesta is ending.

The singers on the bandstand are singing the last song of

the evening, "Vincino Amare." A crowd of elderly Italian-

Americans stand below the bandstand and listen. There are

four singers, their voices projected through a PA system.

CONTINUES THROUGH ALL CUTS.

TERESA is in bed, asleep. The music can be heard echoing in

the background.

EXT. STREET CORNER

CHARLIE is still sitting on the curb holding his injured

wrist. The ambulance and the police are going about their

business. A crowd has gathered.

GIOVANNI'S LIVING ROOM

GIOVANNI is watching the Late Late Show on T.V. (Car

explosion scene from "The Big Heat"). Aside from the light

of the screen, the room is darkened.

ALL NIGHT VILLAGE LUNCHEONETTE

DIANE is alone, sipping coffee.

EXT. STREET CORNER

The police are standing around CHARLIE with open notebooks,

questioning him. He doesn't answer. JOHNNY BOY'S body is

being taken into the ambulance.

TONY'S PLACE - MEN'S ROOM

TONY is relieving himself. He washes his hands.

The last song of the festival is ending now. As the singers

come to a stirring climax they wave and shout in Italian.

The band plays a few bars of "Home Sweet Home." The singers

throw kisses to the dispursing crowd. People who have been

watching the festival pull down the blinds of shades and go

in.

MICHAEL'S CAR - PARKED

MICHAEL'S car is parked in a deserted area on the docks. He

has his head in his hands. The BOY with him says nothing.

CHARLIE is still in shock, sitting on the curb.

The police are still walking around in a businesslike manner.

CHARLIE stares down at his feet. The wrecked car is being

pulled away.

CHARLIE is being put into an ambulance. He is muttering to

himself and seems shocked and bewildered.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Early morning. A door in the far corner of the room opens.

CHARLIE is motioned through by a cop, who shuts the door

immediately behind him. There is an unnaturally loud

clanging sound that echoes in the room. CHARLIE looks

around, still a little dazed, and spots MARIO standing over

by the door. MARIO has made no move to greet him. He just

stands there watching. CHARLIE walks over to him, sensing

something a little ominous.

MARIO says nothing, just nods at him to step outside.

CHARLIE goes out into the street. MARIO follows.

EXT. STREET - DAY

There is practically no one on the street. The early

morning light makes everything a clammy grey. CHARLIE waits

at the bottom of the steps.

MARIO hands CHARLIE an envelope containing an airline ticket.

CHARLIE stares at the ticket in his hand. MARIO is obviously

uncomfortable.

INT. CAR - DAY

TONY'S car. He is driving CHARLIE to the airport. A

suitcase can be seen in the back seat.

CHARLIE'S face - slightly upset.

CHARLIE snapping seat belt in car.

STOCK SHOT: airplane exploding BLACK AND WHITE (FANTASY)

CHARLIE in car - more upset.

EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

The TWA terminal at Kennedy. TONY'S car pulls up to the

curb, CHARLIE gets out, waves away help from an idle porter,

and pulls his suitcases out of the back seat. TONY leans

across the seat toward him.

CHARLIE breaks away from the handshake and grabs TONY

affectionately behind the neck.

TONY gives CHARLIE'S hand a last slap, then gets back behind

the wheel.

CHARLIE nods and watches the car pull away. Then he picks

up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal.

INT. TERMINAL - DAY

The place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement.

CHARLIE is noticeable because he is the only member of the

crowd who walks slowly, without any apparent mission or

destination. He makes his way toward the large flight board

that looms over the whole room. Loudspeakers announce

planes to and from every part of the world. On the flight

board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin

and change every moment. He passes the insurance machines

and almost stops - more upset than before. A businessman

calmly pays for insurance. (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE

continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses

and St. Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy

dogs and flight bags. He looks at the cross.

The ticket desk is under the flight board. CHARLIE eventually

works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor

and stands staring at the board. He sees the names of

dozens of cities flashing before him. As he watches, a

pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk.

CHARLIE stares at the flight board in dismay and indecision.

He apparently does not hear her.

CHARLIE hears her this time. He reaches into his jacket

pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to

her. The clerk starts to open it to check the destination.

The question is unusual. The clerk looks up. CHARLIE stare

back at her with a quality that is almost defiance.

QUICKLY TO BLACK - MUSIC IN
