The words slowly FADE OUT, taking us hard into

EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN

A small, pleasant house on a tree-lined street in Los Angeles

circa 1928. 210 North Avenue 23. Not far from Dodger Stadium.

SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES, MARCH 9, 1928.

INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE

COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to

shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves

OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air.

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

She throws water on her face as the music continues. She

looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead.

She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day.

The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she

smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light.

INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER

Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS

is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see

much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's

important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the

following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect.

She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair.

CHANGELING A True Story                                       2.

She smiles, kisses him on the forehead, and exits. He sits

on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again.

EXT. PASADENA AVENUE - MORNING

A street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the

street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model A's

and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans.

INT. STREET-CAR - CONTINUOUS

Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in

her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to

an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that

only a few other kids have arrived.

She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward

the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the

school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as

Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there.

She waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it

rumbles away.

INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY

Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room

is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy

wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening

and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once.

Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created

by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator

to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns

at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane

toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper.

The mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off.

CHANGELING A True Story                                       3.

Christine struggles on the headset.

She reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end

as the floor manager, BEN HARRIS, 30s, approaches.

She roller-skates off toward another operator waving another

pink sheet of paper.

CHANGELING A True Story                                       4.

EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY

Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick

telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself.

Then a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees

gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine

closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up,

we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows

indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun.

She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again.

She grabs her belongs and heads back inside.

EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

Christine waits outside the school as another bell rings,

announcing the end of classes. Kids run outside, Walter among

them. He folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk.

She stops, looks at him.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    5.

Christine takes his hand, and they continue down the sidewalk.

She turns and crouches down in front of him.

CHANGELING A True Story                                       6.

She takes his pinky in hers, gives a tug.    He smiles.

He laughs and tears off. She runs after him, letting him

stay ahead of her the whole way.

EXT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Walter is asleep on the floor, in front of the radio, which

is playing the closing moments of Amos and Andy. Christine

enters and turns off the radio. He stirs, looks up at her.

She picks him up and carries him up the stairs.

And she disappears upstairs.

EXT. COLLINS HOME - MORNING

Just enough to bring us into

CHANGELING A True Story                                     7.

INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

She's getting ready for the day and is almost out of the room

when the phone rings. She hesitates, then picks it up.

SUPERIMPOSE: MARCH 10, 1928

She hangs up. She doesn't like this, but there's no way out

of it. She straightens and heads out of the room.

INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A disappointed Walter sits on the couch as Christine puts

things together quickly.

She stops in front of him, kneels down to eye height.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      8.

She heads out, the screen door clattering shut behind her.

EXT. COLLINS HOME - CONTINUOUS

She crosses the lawn and turns at the sidewalk, glancing back

as Walter looks out at her from the window. She waves. He

waves back. With one last look, she continues off.

INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY

If the place was hectic before, now it's even worse: lines

buzzing, voices chattering, operators following Christine

around with papers and question.

Christine glances up at the clock, 4:39.    She's already late.

But she does what's necessary.

She hurries off to take care of it all, the others following.

INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - HALLWAY - LATER

START on a clock which reads 5:20, then TILT DOWN as Christine

comes out of the switchboard room, pulling on a sweater, ready

to leave...as the floor manager steps out of his office.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      9.

She glances down the block. The street car is approaching,

but she doesn't want to piss off her boss by running off.

She looks up to see the streetcar right at the stop.

She races out to

EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - CONTINUOUS

running after the streetcar as it closes its doors.

But the streetcar rumbles away before she can catch it.

Frustrated, she glances at her watch and sighs resignedly.

INT. STREET-CAR - EARLY EVENING

Christine sits on the front bench, watching as the shadows

lengthen, then pulls the bell. The car rumbles to a stop as

she steps out onto the sidewalk.

CHANGELING A True Story                                           10.

EXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING

She passes a grocery store, where a clock reads 6:15, and

continues past other houses on the pleasant, green street.

We HEAR parents telling their kids to come in for dinner,

radios playing music or radio dramas. Peaceful, charming.

Christine smiles, turns the corner, looks to her house --

-- and it's dark, closed up. No lights on inside, no music

or dramas on the radio. Dead silent.

Christine pauses, then picks up her pace. No need to panic,

he could be upstairs asleep, could be in the back of the house,

where the lights wouldn't show.

She goes to the front door.     It's unlocked.    She enters --

INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

It's dark, silent.    She puts her purse down.     Looks around.

Nothing.   She goes into

INT. KITCHEN

switching on lights as she goes. Nothing. She checks the

refrigerator. The sandwich she made Walter is untouched.

She moves to the staircase.

INT. WALTER'S ROOM

She opens the door to his room.      No Walter.

EXT. COLLINS HOUSE

She crosses to the sidewalk.     Looks up and down the street.

A little GIRL on a tricycle rolls past.

The girl continues away. Christine's concerned, but she hasn't

hit the panic button, not yet. She crosses the street to --

CHANGELING A True Story                                           11.

EXT. RILEY HOUSE

-- and rings the doorbell.       The door opens and MRS. RILEY,

forties, emerges.

Christine heads away.

EXT. STREET

Christine stops at the sidewalk in front of her house, looks

up and down the street, arms folded against the growing chill.

She starts walking again. Faster now. Looking around trees

and porches, anywhere a nine-year-old boy might hide. She

hears children playing. Laughing. She picks up her pace,

homing in on the sound.

She turns the corner to find three children playing, none of

them Walter. She looks down the ominously empty streets.

Her worry growing, she heads to the house.       Faster now.   Heels

clicking on the hard sidewalk.

INT. COLLINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

She bursts in, leaving the door open, looking around in case

he came in while she was out. Nothing. She crosses to the

phone, hesitates for just a BEAT, then picks up the receiver.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   12.

There's a long pause as she waits, looks out the window, then:

CHANGELING A True Story                                     13.

EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Christine walks down the street, arms wrapped around herself.

She continues on, calling Walter's name as she disappears

into the shadows.

INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Christine watches out the curtained living room windows, eyes

red rimmed from worry but not from tears, not yet, as a police

car finally pulls up. Neighbors look on as the officers get

out and approach the house. HOLD on Christine's face, pale

and worried, UNDER:

EXT. ST. PAUL'S PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - DAY

Located at 5100 Coliseum Street

INT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - DAY

A large radio microphone with the call letters KGF is atop a

podium, where PASTOR GUSTAV BRIEGLEB stands: fifties, barrel

chested, no-nonsense, a fire-and-brimstone preacher. His

congregation sits in hard wooden pews, listening and nodding.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    14.

There's APPLAUSE and cheering from the pews.   He lets it pass.

The place erupts into applause and cheering.

INT. POLICE CHIEF JAMES DAVIS' OFFICE - DAY

POLICE CHIEF JAMES E. DAVIS, 40s, hard-edged and tall, stands

looking out the window as the radio drones on behind him.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     15.

More cheers and applause as Davis switches off the radio.

INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

The alarm goes off, but Christine is already awake. Staring

up at the ceiling. She slowly pulls herself up and moves OS.

SUPERIMPOSE: APRIL 3, 1928

INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Christine walks past the door to his bedroom. Looks inside.

Goes over to the bed. Her hand lingers, touching it, UNDER:

INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - HALLWAY - DAY

Christine and Mr. Harris, the floor manager, approach the

doors to the switchboard room.

He smiles as he says it, but there's the sense that he doesn't

think Walter's coming back. It's been too long. She senses

it, but moves past it, pushing open the door and entering

INT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

As loud as before...until the operators see Christine, and

the noise stops. She tries to smile, as if to say, I'm okay,

but can't quite manage it.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      16.

Several women approach and hug her as the noise level begins

to climb, but nowhere near what it was a moment earlier.

She nods as he exits, then heads off herself.

INT. SWITCHBOARD ROOM - LATER

Christine moves from station to station, the noise level still

noticeably low. Every time she approaches an operator, they

lower their voices, as if not to bother her.

One operator holds up a pink request sheet. Christine starts

toward her, but then the operator glances to another supervisor

and hands it off. Knowing she has to do something about this,

she turns to the room and, in a firm, clear voice, says:

The room grows quiet.   Everyone is looking at her.

She manages a thin smile as the place returns to normal.

EXT. PHONE COMPANY LUNCH AREA - AFTERNOON

Mr. Harris steps out into the lunch area where a number of

the operators and supervisors are hanging out.

He nods his thanks, and continues off.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      17.

INT. PHONE COMPANY - BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

He approaches the door, slowing as he HEARS Christine inside.

A hang-up, then dialing.   He glances in the open doorway.

Christine sits at a table, phone in hand, a list of phone

numbers in front of her. The list reads LAS VEGAS MISSING

PERSONS DEPARTMENT, SACRAMENTO MISSING PERSONS DEPARTMENT,

SAN FRANCISCO MISSING PERSONS DEPARTMENT...on and on...with

each having multiple checks beside it, indicating all the

times she's called. Her lunch sits untouched beside her.

She puts a check next to LAS VEGAS MISSING PERSONS DEPARTMENT

then looks up as someone answers at the other end of the phone.

She hangs up and ticks another department off the list and

dials again. Mr. Harris heads away, deciding that whatever

it was he planned to talk to her about...it can wait.

EXT. DINER - AFTERNOON

A single car is parked in the dirt lot outside the small,

roadside diner.

SUPERIMPOSE: DE KALB, ILLINOIS.   JULY 10, 1928

CHANGELING A True Story                                     18.

INT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

THe COOK who owns this dive is cleaning the griddle and keeping

an eye on the only two customers in the place: a MAN and a

young BOY, both wearing hats, as was the custom. They're

unkempt, dirty, like they've been on the road a long time.

They finish the last of the food as the cook approaches, tears

off the bill and puts it on the table.

The Man reaches for his wallet.   Pats an empty pocket.   Tries

the other pocket. Nothing.

The Cook hesitates; he doesn't want the trouble of bringing

in the cops, but he doesn't want to get stuck, either.

The Man glances at the Boy seated beside him.   The boy's face

is dirty, partially obscured by the hat.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      19.

The boy nods reluctantly, looks away as the man rises.

The Man nods, exits and drives off.     The Cook squints warily

at the Boy, then at the wall clock.     It's 2:00.

EXT. DINER - LATER

No car.   Just the empty parking lot.

INT. DINER - ON CLOCK

It's 3:15. The Cook is annoyed.      He glances to the Boy, who

won't meet his gaze. Finally:

He goes to the phone.    Clicks the receiver a few times.

He casts a sour look in the boy's direction.

The boy takes a BEAT, looking out at the road.    Then:

INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY

As before, Christine hurries from one station to another,

lost in the barely-managed chaos. She stops at one station,

glancing over papers, then looks over at --

-- the window to Mr. Harris' office, where he is talking with

a police officer, CAPTAIN J. J. JONES, 30s, serious, arch.

She slows, unable to look away, a growing dread settling in

her heart. Harris points out the window. Points...to her.

The police captain nods and enters the switchboard room.

As Jones heads for her, the strength goes out of Christine's

legs. She holds onto the a desk as he stops before her.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   20.

She manages a nod. Behind her eyes is the terror: he's going

to tell me my son is dead. The room gets very quiet.

But she hasn't heard anything past he's safe and unhurt. She

almost goes to the floor as other women rush toward her, crying

and embracing her.

For the first time, Christine cries, great wracking sobs, all

the emotion she's been fighting back all this time coming out

at last...he's okay...he's okay.

EXT. UNION STATION - DAY

Jones and Christine are in a police car pulling up to the

train station. It moves through a police line holding back a

crowd of reporters who SHOUT questions at the passing car.

As Christine and Jones step out, they're mobbed by the press.

Jones smiles splendidly for the cameras, waves, one arm wrapped

around Christine, who looks stunned by it all.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      21.

Beaming, Jones escorts Christine into Union Station.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

Seated on a bench is a POLICE MATRON, and beside her, the BOY

from the De Kalb diner...who we will identify henceforth as

"Walter." He is looking out the window at the passing scenery.

The boy turns his attention back out the window as we HEAR

the WHISTLE of the train pulling into Union Station.

INT. UNION STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY

We HEAR the same train whistle from this side as Christine

and Jones come to the ramp, POLICE CHIEF DAVIS is waiting.

The reporters are held back at the entrance to the platform.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   22.

But she's distracted, looking off to the end of the platform,

where the train is starting to pull in.

The train stops.    Doors begin to open.

But she's already running down the platform as people start

to step off the train. Jones exchanges a look with Davis.

He trots off to catch up with Christine, who walks alongside

the train, looking from window to window, anxious, eager.

Then: the Matron gets off the train, her frame momentarily

blocking the view of the boy beside her...but Christine spots

them. With Jones not far behind, she breaks into a run.

She runs toward them. The matron turns, sees her, smiles and

gets out of the way, revealing the boy.

Christine stops. Staggers so hard she almost falls. She

steps forward slowly, a hand going to her mouth. For a moment,

we're not sure what's going through her mind. She looks to

the matron, who smiles. Looks to the boy, who smiles.

Then she steps back a pace, horror sinking in as Jones comes

jauntily alongside her.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      23.

Jones freezes at the words.

He glances over his shoulder to where the Chief of Police is

waiting, not aware of any of this, and beyond him...the press.

He turns from her, stoops down to look at the boy.

Christine steps back as though slapped.     This can't be.

The boy considers for a moment...then:

CHANGELING A True Story                                   24.

And he RUNS to her, grabbing her around the waist, which only

magnifies her horror. Jones has no idea what to make of her,

or this, or the boy. The only thing he knows is that the

chief of police is standing right over there, smiling now

that he thinks he's seen a mother and child reunion. The

press is nearly insane trying to get through to them.

She looks from him to the boy...who is not terribly dissimilar

from Walter...so that even the audience may not be entirely

sure if it's him or not...and part of her wants desperately

to believe...the pressure is immense.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   25.

It's an agonizing moment, then finally:

Without giving her a moment to reconsider, he waves and the

Chief of Police approaches as the press rushes toward them.

In an instant, they're overwhelmed by people shouting

questions, flashbulbs popping, a fever of excitement.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   26.

He poses Christine and "Walter" so she is holding the boy in

her arms. Dazed, stunned, confused, she manages to smile for

the cameras. Bulbs FLASH and --

-- time SLOWS DOWN, the SOUND MUTED, as Christine looks around

at it all as though in a dream...reporters shouting questions

she doesn't hear...bulbs flashing...the boy beside her, smiling

at it all. He looks at her, mouths the word Mommy, as --

INT. POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER

-- the car door SLAMS and she and the boy sit side by side.

The silence is in profound contrast to the madness of a moment

earlier. An officer gets in they drive off, passing Jones

and the Chief of Police, talking quietly off to one side.

Christine looks to the boy.   He smiles at her.

INT. COLLINS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

The only noise is the clock on the wall, ticking. Christine

sits at one end of the table, "Walter" at the other. Studying

him. He is finishing a sandwich, not meeting her gaze.

He turns, and heads up the stairs.   She follows.

INT. HALLWAY FRONTING BATHROOM - LATER

Carrying a pair of pajamas, Christine comes into the hall and

stops in front of the bathroom door. Knocks.

CHANGELING A True Story                                       27.

She hears him fall and pushes the door open.

INT. BATHROOM

She helps "Walter" stand, discreetly turned away from us.

She stops suddenly, reacting to something we don't see.

Looks slowly looks up to his face.

She takes his hand and marches him out of the bathroom.

INT. HALLWAY

She places him against the wall where she measured Walter's

growth over the years. The marks put him four inches shorter

than the one labeled March. She looks at him, very serious.

He says nothing.   HOLD on her look of growing desperation.

INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

Jones walks quickly down the hall, trying to look interested

in a clutch of papers in his hands, Christine following after.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   28.

Jones glances back, uncomfortable about discussing circumcision

with a woman in public view. He lowers his voice.

He's on the move again, stepping into --

INT. JONES' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

-- and getting behind his desk as Christine follows him in.

CHANGELING A True Story                                       29.

He sits, shaking his head.

She exits.   Annoyed, Jones paces, then picks up the phone.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     30.

INT. COLLINS HOME - DAY

Christine is cooking dinner when the doorbell rings. She

opens the door to find a police officer and DR. EARL W. TARR,

sixties, mildly eccentric in appearance.

She steps aside, and Dr. Tarr enters, looking around.

He looks up as "Walter" comes downstairs. Noting that he

said "the boy," not "your son," Christine looks relieved.

As he bends down to look more closely at "Walter," Christine

stiffens...she can't have heard that right.

CHANGELING A True Story                           31.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    32.

Before she can react, he takes Walter by the hand and leads

him outside. Christine follows them out to --

EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

-- as Dr. Tarr strides onward, the police officer and "Walter"

walking alongside as Christine brings up the rear. A few

houses down they come to a group of CHILDREN playing.

He looks from one child to the other. They don't reply.

Either they don't recognize him, or they're intimidated.

The kids exchange a glance. It's clear they don't recognize

the boy, but they're intimidated by the presence of Tarr and

the police officer. A few reluctantly raise their hands.

Another of them goes to "Walter," who is shorter than he is.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   33.

He heads off again, like some very tall, strange bird marching

down the street. Christine exchanges a look with the kids,

then heads off to follow.

EXT. RILEY'S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Tarr, Christine, Mrs. Riley, the officer and "Walter" stand

on the porch.

She stoops down, studies "Walter's" face, turns it from side

to side. Squints at him. He squints back at her. Note:

she's not wearing glasses. Finally:

CHANGELING A True Story                                   34.

She looks at her watch. Holds it farther away. Can't quite

focus on it. Pulls her glasses out from inside her blouse.

Mrs. Riley nods and heads inside as Christine looks to Tarr,

who shrugs off what was just demonstrated.

Tarr takes "Walter's" hand and heads away, Christine following,

anger growing in her eyes as we HEAR:

INT. COLLINS HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

She is on the phone, "Walter" finishing up his dinner in BG.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    35.

She hangs up. Hard. The events of the day have her teetering

on the edge, but she's holding on. She pulls herself together

and goes to the sink, furiously doing dishes for a silent

BEAT before "Walter" looks up from his now-empty plate.

"Walter" rises, as Christine continues to clean dishes, not

looking back at him. Exhausted mentally, physically and

emotionally. He goes to the door, stops, turns.

Christine fumbles the plate and it SMASHES to the floor.   She

turns furiously to "Walter."

She moves toward him, her anger coming out at last.

He tears off as she slumps to the floor, covering her eyes.

INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

"Walter" is in bed, his back to the door, as Christine appears

in the hallway. She steps into the room, sits on the bed.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    36.

He doesn't move.   Her voice is soft, but firm.

He doesn't respond. She gives it a moment in case he might

open up, then rises and heads back into the hallway. She

switches off the light and heads off down the hallway.

INT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - RECTORY - PRE-DAWN

Pastor Briegleb is typing out his sermon for the day. He's

exhausted. Looks at the clock. 6:30 a.m. He rubs tiredly

at his face when he HEARS the THUMP of the newspaper being

delivered. He stands, stretches and steps out to --

EXT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

-- where the newspaper is visible on the front lawn. He picks

it up and starts into the rectory as he unfolds the paper.

Then: he slows, stunned by something he's reading.   He looks

up again, and hurries back into the rectory.

INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

She's in bed, asleep, as the telephone RINGS downstairs. She

glances at the clock: 6:45. She clearly doesn't want to go

INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The telephone is still ringing as she picks it up.

She starts to reply, but the line goes dead. She hangs up

the phone, pulls her robe closer around her, and steps out to

EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN

where a copy of the Los Angeles Times sits on a neighbor's

front lawn. She looks around, then dashes to pick it up.

She unfolds it as she heads back, then abruptly stops. She

can't believe what she's seeing.

CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER. The headline reads Mysterious

Transformation in Collins Boy.

EXT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - GARDEN - MORNING

Briegleb is eating a big breakfast. Christine, newspaper in

hand, is pacing, furious. She reads aloud from the paper.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      38.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Dr. Tarr is sitting at a desk and speaking to a handful of

reporters, enjoying the attention.

CHANGELING A True Story                                       39.

BACK TO SCENE

As she lowers the paper, incredulous. (And yes, what you

just read was exactly what the doctor really said.)

He laughs.   She turns, looking stricken.     He sobers at once.

Reluctantly, she does.      Shakes her head in disbelief.

MONTAGE STARTS

INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE - DAY

FAUX NEWSREEL FOOTAGE of Police Chief Davis speaking before a

bunch of microphones.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

A crowd of police officers, armed with machine-guns, BLAST

the hell out of a group of guys lined up against a wall.

EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

Another guy, beaten to a bloody pulp, is SHOVED out of a moving

car and left in the rain.

EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

A pair of cops and a couple of thugs inspect a truck carrying

booze over the border from Canada, pay the freight and watch

as the trucks drive off in the truck.

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Two officers are sexually assaulting a woman on the stairs.

BACK TO SCENE

With Christine and Briegleb, in the rectory garden.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   42.

She gets up from the table, paces the garden.

He picks up the article, waves it.

She closes her eyes for a BEAT, then looks to him, her voice

firmer, her decision made.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     43.

He gets up, walks toward her, puts his hands on her shoulders.

Giving her strength...but also his concern.

He looks in her eyes...and she meets his gaze levelly.   The

answer is evident.

INT. WAITING ROOM - ANGLE ON DOOR - DAY

We're in a dentist's office. Christine is waiting for a BEAT

before the door opens, and DR. JOHN MONTGOMERY emerges.

He casts a look back at the closed door, shakes his head.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  44.

He hears an OS moan from the inner office.

He smiles.

INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

Small, with wooden desks, chalkboard, all the basics. "Walter"

stands in front of MRS. FOX, fifties, wearing severe glasses

and an equally severe expression. Christine stands nearby.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     45.

"Walter" hesitates, then takes a seat.    The other kids laugh.

"Walter" tries another vacant seat. There are only three

vacant seats in the room. More laughter from the kids.

He sits.   Mrs. Fox looks to Christine.

For the first time, Christine allows a hopeful smile.

INT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The lights are low. Christine sits on the floor, sorting

through a box containing artifacts of affection: class projects

made by Walter, trees and houses and clay dogs; a heart-shaped

card Mother's Day card, hand-made, with I Love You, Mommy

carefully printed on the front. She runs her finger over it,

tracing the impression left by his pencil.

She starts to cry, and a tear falls onto the pencil drawing.

She frantically dabs at it, trying to preserve it from

distortion...then sets it down and covers her face, weeping.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   46.

EXT. CITY HALL - MORNING (RAIN)

A cold, wet knot of reporters and photographers are waiting

in the rain on the steps to City Hall. Christine sits in a

car with Briegleb, looking at it all.

SUPERIMPOSE: SEPTEMBER 6, 1928

She nods, exits the car and walks up the steps to the front

of City Hall as he drives off. She stands before the press,

looks at them for a moment, then begins.

Flashbulbs pop, dazzling her.    She composes herself.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    47.

As the reporters start to shout out questions, we PAN ACROSS

to a BEAT COP who has been watching. He goes quickly to a

police call-box, unlocks it and picks up the telephone.

INT. LINCOLN HEIGHTS STATION - DAY

The glass door to Captain Jones' office is closed, but we can

SEE him on the phone. Finally, he hangs up and comes out of

the office. His tone is cold but neutral...we think this

could go either way. He stops an officer.

He heads off as Jones goes into his office, closing the door.

EXT. LINCOLN HEIGHT STATION - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY (RAIN)

A police car pulls up to the curb, and Christine and "Walter"

emerge from the back seat. They dash through the rain to the

back door, followed by the 1st Cop.

She allows a moment of quiet satisfaction as she's led into

INT. STATION - BULLPEN

where she's directed to a wooden bench. A nearby clock reads

3:45. She sits, "Walter" silent beside her. In the BG, the

Desk Sergeant puts a call on hold.

DETECTIVE LESTER YBARRA, thirties, good looking, glances up.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   48.

Ybarra takes the call as Jones' calls from his office.

Christine starts to take "Walter's" hand when a matron appears.

She hands "Walter" over to the matron, then enters

INT. JONES' OFFICE

He leaves the door open and indicates for Christine to sit.

She does. He paces, working up to what he's going to do.

He circles, closing in on her. She becomes aware that the

door is open, and he's doing this for the benefit of anyone

who might be listening in.

CHANGELING A True Story                            49.

Jones stands between her and the door.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      50.

The door opens, and a POLICE MATRON enters. He looks back to

Christine, his voice low, his anger replaced by cool

determination. This scene is about to take an abrupt change.

He nods to the matron, who moves to restrain her.

The Matron cuffs Christine's hands behind her back.

A CLICK, and the handcuffs are in place.

EXT. REAR OF POLICE STATION (MONTAGE)

Christine is led, in handcuffs, into a waiting police van.

(VO has been taken verbatim from the police report.)

INT. VAN

A stunned and dazed Christine rides in the back of the van

EXT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - DAY

The police van enters the hospital at 1200 North State Street.

INT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - DAY

A sterile, dreary, white-on-white place where in the

background, we can HEAR the sounds of the insane crying out.

The matron leads a stunned Christine to the front desk.

The matron stops before the desk.   The NURSE barely looks up.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   52.

She stops, noting the looks exchanged between the nurse and

the matron. Her story sounds insane, even to her. She begins

to realize the depth of her predicament.

The matron turns Christine over to two large male ORDERLIES,

who take her by the arms and lead her into the psycho ward.

They force-march her down the hall, the screams of the insane

growing louder, falling deeper into the nightmare.

INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM

Christine is ushered into the room by a NURSE.

The nurse begins putting on a pair of rubber gloves.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   53.

Reluctantly, Christine begins to remove her clothes.

INT. SHOWER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

ON CHRISTINE'S FACE as she stands in a spray of water and

disinfectant, some coming from the showerhead above, some

from a hose sprayed on her by the Nurse in BG. Christine's

eyes are closed, trying to shut out the sense of violation.

Biting her lip, Christine complies.

INT. HALL - LATER

Wet hair plastered to her face, dressed in a hospital gown,

Christine is led down a long hall by the Nurse. As she passes

the closed doors, we HEAR women weeping, talking to themselves,

crying out, screaming, beating on the walls. Fingers poke

through narrow viewing slits in the doors.

The Nurse pulls out a key-ring and unlocks one of the doors.

Christine enters --

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bare, forbidding, four white walls and a narrow slit of a

window. It's a two-person room. Sitting on the other bed is

another PATIENT.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      54.

The Nurse exits, closing and locking the door.

Nothing. She's alone with the other Patient, who doesn't

much like the noise and disturbance.

She starts SCREAMING.    Christine covers her ears.

EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

We slowly PULL AWAY from the narrow window, and the sound of

screaming, into the late afternoon rain and growing darkness.

EXT. OLD ROAD - EARLY EVENING

A lone truck sits beside the road, hood open, steam coming

from the radiator.

GORDON NORTHCOTT, thirties, thin and angular, finishes working

on the car as a police car approaches. The detective we saw

earlier, Ybarra, is inside. He rolls down the window.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      55.

As he answers, Gordon moves casually to the back of the open

truck to get a rag to wipe his hands. There is a GUN on the

floor of the trunk. Gordon picks it up inside the rag.

Ybarra drives away. As soon as he's out of sight, Gordon

slams the hood, runs to the driver's side and starts the truck,

still steaming. He drives off as fast as he can.

EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - EVENING

A long, low house, stonework and brick and wood, behind a

large open area cluttered with junked cars. At the far end

of the open area is a chicken coop, about fifteen feet long.

Ybarra drives up in front of the house, gets out, looks around.

ANOTHER ANGLE - POV SHOT

Someone is watching as Ybarra moves toward the main house.

BACK TO SCENE

Ybarra glances off to a rustling SOUND, and follows it to

EXT. CHICKEN COOP

A few chickens inside, held back by wire. An ax is nearby,

its stained edge buried in an old wooden stump. A corner of

the coop seems to have come down and been crudely repaired.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      56.

BACK TO SCENE

As suddenly someone runs across the dirt yard into the house,

SLAMMING the door. Ybarra runs to the porch, tries the door.

Locked from the inside. He pounds on the door.

No reply.   He braces himself and KICKS open the door.

INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN

The door BANGS against the wall. Flies buzz around the place.

The kitchen is in shadows, but there's no question it's a

mess. Ybarra moves cautiously through the kitchen. No sound

except the wood creaking beneath his feet as he enters

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Old, musty, shadowed. The ticking of an old grandfather clock.

There's no one in sight. Ybarra moves down the hall, glances

into two adjoining rooms. Nothing. He continues into

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Curtains drawn, dark, cocooned against the outside world.

Ybarra makes a circuit of the room, then STOPS at a creak of

wood from a CLOSET. He moves toward it. Pauses. Reaches

for the doorknob...as suddenly a clock CHIMES loudly and the

closet explodes outward and --

-- SANFORD CLARK, 15, runs out. He slams into Ybarra, knocking

him down. They go down in a tumble of limbs, wrestling on

the floor as Sanford tries to escape.

Breathing hard, Sanford finally stops struggling.   Ybarra

cuffs Sanford's hands behind his back.

Sanford stands, and as Ybarra leads him out, we PAN TO a mantle

and a photo that shows Sanford Clark and a man we recognize

as the one we saw by the road earlier: Gordon Northcott.

INT. YBARRA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Ybarra locks Sanford in the car, then climbs in the driver's

side. He checks a cut on his face in the rear-view mirror.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   57.

Suddenly Sanford starts laughing. It's a nearly hysterical

laugh, half fear and half relief...Ybarra isn't there for the

reasons he thought. Ybarra is puzzled by his reaction.

Ybarra puts the car into gear and drives off.

EXT. ST. PAUL'S PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - NIGHT

Enough to ESTABLISH, then:

INT. ST. PAUL'S - CONTINUOUS

Gustav Briegleb sits behind the microphone, waiting to go on

the air. He looks at the clock. 7:59. Glances to an AIDE.

The aide hurries off as Briegleb turns back to the microphone

and touches a switch. The ON THE AIR lamp glows to life.

INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - SAME TIME

Christine is in bed, wide awake, the sounds of the asylum

somewhat lessened now. Her face is dimly lit by moonlight.

On her face, we go to

INT. UNION STATION - TICKET BOOTH - NIGHT

Gordon Northcott makes his way to the ticket booth.

The vender moves away to pull the ticket. Gordon glances at

a cop heading his way. Stiffens. The cop continues past

him. Gordon relaxes as the vender slides the ticket across.

Gordon pays for the ticket and heads toward the boarding gates.

EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

Just enough to establish the transition.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

Christine is on top of the bed, eyes open, not having slept

all night. She's staring at the woman on the next cot. THe

woman is staring back at her. The second-hand on a clock

behind protective chicken-wire passes 8:00 and a loud BELL

goes off, announcing the start of the day.

We hear doors being unlocked up and down the hall. Christine

stands, pulls her hair back, and catches her reflection in

the window: pale, drawn, smudged, and in a hospital gown...

looking like someone who actually belongs in this place.

The door opens and she steps into the hall as a NURSE passes.

Christine doesn't want to stay, so she moves off.

INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - DINING AREA - MORNING

Christine and the other patients sit at long tables. A few

talk in quiet whispers, but most eat silently, staring vacantly

ahead. Some have scars showing lobotomies or electro-

convulsive (shock) therapy. It's a scary bunch. Christine

isn't eating.

Another female patient, CAROL DEXTER, thirties, watches

Christine then slides closer. A BEAT, then:

CHANGELING A True Story                                      60.

Christine is startled by the level-headedness of the advice

from someone she assumed was probably nuts. Reluctantly, she

begins eating the cold-looking oatmeal.

Christine reacts to the taste of the food, which is awful.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   61.

Christine sits back heavily, starting to understand the world

more than she ever wanted to.

It gets through.   Hooker.   Christine nods.

CHANGELING A True Story                                       62.

She nods to an older woman whose upper temples are marred by

surgical scars. Lobotomized. Christine turns away.

Numb with horror, Christine forces down the oatmeal.

INT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - DAY

Sanford Clark sits near several other juveniles being held.

Pensive, nervous, he watches a kid absently tapping a ruler

against his knees.

FEATURE the ruler.   Rising.   Falling.   Tapping.   Then back --

-- on Sanford as we hear it continuing to tap OS.     PUSH IN ON

his face. Then, suddenly --

FLASHBACK

-- on a HATCHET, rising and falling in tune with the ruler

tapping. There's blood on the hatchet.

Gordon Northcott's eyes glitter insanely as he brings the

hatchet down again and just as it comes right AT US we flash --

BACK TO SCENE

As Sanford CRIES OUT with the memory. We PULL BACK to see

the others in the room staring at him. He turns away, won't

meet their gaze. Something's terribly wrong.

Just then, an ADMINISTRATOR comes in.

Sanford rises, goes to the Administrator.

He starts to turn and walk away when:

CHANGELING A True Story                                     63.

The Administrator senses that he's sincere, and troubled.

And with that, the administrator heads away.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON

Gordon Northcott is hitch-hiking by the side of the road. A

truck approaches, passes him...then slows and stops. Gordon

runs up to the truck as the DRIVER leans out.

Gordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under

the seat...when something metallic bangs underneath. He lifts

out a short length of metal pipe.

Gordon smiles, moves as if to hand the pipe back...and suddenly

SLAMS it DOWN on the Driver's head...over and over and over.

Blood splatters his face. Breathing hard, Gordon shoves the

Driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off.

CHANGELING A True Story                                       64.

INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - DAY

Wearing a bandage on one arm, Christine is escorted down the

hall by one of the nurses. She's led into --

INT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

-- where DOCTOR JONATHAN STEELE stands as Christine enters.

He's in his fifties, heavy-set, serious.

The nurse leaves. Christine notes that there are three chairs

in a row. Could be a test. She sits in the middle chair.

Sits as straight as she can. Trying to look sane.

He makes a note of this. She grimaces. This isn't going

well. He motions to the bandage on her arm.

She smiles a forced smile.   Trying to appear level-headed.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  65.

She flashes another wan smile. He makes another note, picks

up the report on his desk, glances it over.

He starts pulling out papers from his file.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     66.

He nods. She's trying to say what she thinks he wants to

hear. It's a chess match that ends with:

He sits back.    Christine's face tells the story.

INT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - DAY

It's raining.    The Administrator enters with Detective Ybarra.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A single table, two chairs. Sanford sits quietly, nervously,

as Ybarra hangs his wet coat up on a hook.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   67.

He sits across the table from Sanford, lights up a cigarette.

Sanford's mouth works for a moment, but nothing comes out.

A long BEAT.   Sanford composes himself, begins:

CHANGELING A True Story                                        68.

Sanford is in tears by now. Ybarra realizes that there's

something real going on here, and backs off.

Sanford closes his eyes.    Takes a long beat.   Finally....

Ybarra freezes, the cigarette not moving in his hand.

He thinks about it for a moment. The fact that he has to add

them all up is almost as chilling as what follows next.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    69.

Sanford looks off, pauses, then, softly and slowly....

Gordon is at his truck, the same one we saw earlier, checking

the engine as Sanford looks on nervously.

Gordon slams the hood shut, looks to Sanford.    Smiles.

as the truck starts to approach from behind.

The truck comes beside the kid and Gordon leans out the window.

EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT

The boy, crying, is tossed into the chicken coop.   There are

two other boys there, also crying and screaming.

QUICK IMAGES

Gordon, eyes insane with blood lust, stumbles toward the coop.

The kids, screaming.

Sanford looking on, afraid to move, the single overhead light

in the coop swinging wildly.

Gordon grabbing an ax.    Raising it.

On Sanford's eyes, terrified.

The ax begins to fall in SLOW MOTION and --

BACK TO SCENE

-- as the long ash at the end of Ybarra's cigarette, TUMBLES

to the floor in SLOW MOTION, end over end, SHATTERING when it

hits the floor and bringing us back to full speed.

Then: silence, except for Sanford's sobbing. Ybarra realizes

he hasn't been breathing. He tries to find his voice.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     72.

He goes to his coat and pulls out a batch of photos of missing

kids bound with a rubber band. Hands it to Sanford.

Sanford takes the photos.   Starts going through them.

A photo, a face, goes down on the table. Then another. A

third. With each photo slapped down the SLAP gets louder,

BOOMING at us. Another photo. Another. Row after row.

He's crying, sobbing, but still putting down photos.

Then he SLAMS down the last one and   half-falls, half-stumbles

out of his chair, sobbing...goes to   the corner of the room

and slides down the wall until he's   sitting in a fetal

position, hands covering his face.    Sobbing uncontrollably.

Numb, Ybarra goes to the table, picks up a photo. Looks at

it. Turns it over to the name, then picks up another. Then

a third. When he picks up the fourth photo and turns it over,

he stops, staring at it.

The name on the back of the photo is WALTER COLLINS.

INT. JONES' OFFICE - DAY

Jones is on the phone, pissed and getting more pissed by the

moment. INTERCUT between Jones and Ybarra in juvenile hall

during the conversation.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      73.

He backhands a newspaper on his desk, headlined DISTRAUGHT

MOTHER CLAIMS POLICE RETURNED WRONG CHILD.

Just then a secretary sticks her head in the doorway.

There's a disturbance off-screen and she goes to deal with it

as Jones gets further wound up to ninety.

He's drawn to the window by the sound of voices. He peeks

through the slats. Several dozen placard-carrying parishioners

and members of the Women's Temperance League are standing in

the street, beating drums and calling Christine's name.

He realizes he's still on the phone.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     74.

He slams the phone down.   CUT BACK TO --

-- Ybarra in juvenile hall, agonizing over this. Finally,

his voice resigned, he looks into the interrogation room.

INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jones has come out into the hall, where Briegleb, several

supporters and a handful of reporters are standing at the

receiving officer's desk. They approach quickly.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      75.

He heads back the way he came as the others shout questions

after him, held back by other police officers.

INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - DAY ROOM - AFTERNOON

Patients are being corralled into a line that extends to a

barred window where a nurse is dispensing pills.

Christine is nudged forward by an orderly, Carol beside her.

She's nudged to the window, where a nurse hands out a pill

and water.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      76.

Christine sees Dr. Steele, breaks away and rushes to him.

He moves off into an adjoining room. Carol Dexter, next in

line, takes her pill...but keeps an eye on Christine.

INT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He goes to his desk as she stands in the doorway.

He pulls a typed letter out of his desk, slides it across.

She picks it up, reads as he continues:

CHANGELING A True Story                            77.

She tears up the sheet of paper.

An orderly appears in the doorway.

She BURSTS past the orderly, running into

CHANGELING A True Story                                     78.

INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

running, pursued by orderlies, two more blocking her way.

They TACKLE her and bring her down. She struggles as the

others look on, and you can see in their eyes that they don't

like what they're seeing, there's rage --

-- and a furious Carol Dexter comes to her aid. She JUMPS

into the struggle. Biting. Kicking. Scratching.

Steele comes on the run just as the orderlies peel Carol off

the fight, spinning her around to face Steele, who SLAPS her.

He looks to Carol, Christine restrained behind them.

He smiles. She gets a hand free and SLUGS him, hard, a nail

slicing his cheek. He touches his face. It comes back with

blood. Then he looks to the orderly.

The orderly hauls Carol off, kicking and screaming, as

Christine is moved toward the nurse's station.

They force a pill in her mouth, following with water as they

hold her nose, forcing her to swallow. She chokes, swallows.

They march her down the hall as Steele returns to his office.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   79.

INT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS

The electro-shock room. Carol struggles against the orderlies

who force her down onto the gurney. A nurse behind her applies

conductor jelly to her temples as another orderly shoves a

rubber bite-guard into her mouth.

Then a pair of metal pincers, points covered in cloth, are

pressed against her temples. A button is pushed...and her

body goes RIGID as a jolt of electricity blasts through her

body. (This was, remember, fairly common practice for violent

behavior in the 1920s.)

Then she passes out, her eyes rolling up in her head.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Christine is peering out the narrow slot in her door as she

sees Carol being wheeled down the hall and put into her bed.

Christine, sobbing, collapses slowly to the floor, caught in

a nightmare and unable to wake up.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Detective Ybarra is sitting at his desk, not happy about a

lot of his life at this moment. He's turning over the photos

of the missing kids identified by Sanford Clark and arranging

them on his desk the way you might arrange cards, playing

solitaire. He looks up --

-- to see Sanford being led out of one of the holding areas,

hands cuffed, clothes in his hands. Being transferred to a

waiting bus. The two exchange a look. Ybarra looks away.

Sanford continues toward the bus.

Finally, in agony, Ybarra can't take it any more. He rises,

goes to the officer standing by the door to the bus.

He leads Sanford away, then stops two passing officers.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      80.

He hurries off.   The officers follow, not sure what's up.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

Christine sits beside Carol's bed. She's awake but dazed.

Christine dabs a wet cloth against her forehead.

Carol takes her hand, holds it.

Christine manages a thin smile, despite her tears.

Christine touches her face, and we know she's heard this.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     81.

EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - EVENING

Two squad cars pull up to the ranch. Ybarra and the other

officers get out, guns up, not knowing if Gordon is still

there or not.

SUPERIMPOSE: SEPTEMBER 12, 1928

They move quickly through the area, checking the house.

Everything's dark, silent. One officer runs into the house,

there's a long pause...then he pokes his head out again.

Ybarra goes back to the car, opens the door.   Sanford emerges.

Sanford hesitates, then starts toward a nearby barn.

INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

He slides the door open and walks to the far end. The dirt

here is a strange white-yellow color. Ybarra follows, still

keeping a wary eye out for trouble. He looks down at where

Sanford has stopped. Several bags marked LYE are nearby.

Sanford nods.   Ybarra edges toward a shovel, hands it to him.

Sanford takes the shovel and starts cutting out sections of

dirt and lye, dust rising around them. Ybarra watches,

pensively, as the other officers edge their way in. He's

looking the other way when one of the officers reacts:

Ybarra glances back...to see a child's shoe being unearthed.

And beside it...bones. And then...a skull.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      82.

The officer races out of the barn as Ybarra looks to Sanford,

who is still digging, crying as he goes.

Sobbing, Sanford drops the shovel and collapses on the ground,

hands covering his face, crying in great, heaving sobs.

INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - MORNING

The patients are lined up outside their rooms for inspection.

Steele passes down them in review. Stops in front of

Christine, who looks exhausted, worn, pale, her eyes

bloodshot...but still defiant. He glances to the orderlies.

The orderlies move all of the other patients away, except for

Christine, who shares a glance with Carol. Several other

orderlies remain. He glances at her chart in his hands.

She doesn't answer. Her eyes never leave his.     He pulls

another copy of the letter out of the folder.

He holds it up in front of her. She focuses first on it,

then on him...and finally, her spine where it needs to be

even if the rest of her is in shambles, looks at him and says:

CHANGELING A True Story                                    83.

He nods, shrugs, puts the letter back in the folder.   Turns

to the orderlies.

They GRAB her and start muscling her down the hall, Christine

kicking and screaming as they go. Steele continues out to

INT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

where he comes through the double-barred door just as Gustav

Briegleb charges in the front door, carrying a newspaper.

Steele approaches.

Intercut with:

INT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS

They wheel Christine into the room, struggling, fighting

against the straps that pin her to the gurney.

INT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS

Steele turns away from Briegleb, unconcerned.

CHANGELING A True Story                                       84.

Briegleb THRUSTS the newspaper into Steele's hands.

Steele unfolds the paper, looks at the headline, which we

don't see. His reaction, though, is ominous and serious.

INT. ROOM EIGHTEEN - CONTINUOUS

The nurse behind Christine applies the conductor jell to her

temples. She's fighting the best she can, but it's hopeless.

The nurse picks up the electro-shock pincers. Places them on

Christine's temples. Reaches for the button --

-- as suddenly the door opens, and a nurse steps in, stopping

the process. The nurse goes to the one at the controls,

whispers in her ear. The nurse then says something quietly

to the orderly, who starts to undo the straps that hold

Christine to the gurney.

They pull her up off the gurney.

INT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Christine is ushered inside, where Steele is waiting.    He

looks upset about something.

She forces herself to stand straight, not easy given what

she's just been through. He approaches.

She looks up into his face, her resolve unshaken, her voice

dry but firm for:

He studies her for one last BEAT, then turns his back.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      85.

Christine takes a moment to process this...not sure if she

heard this right, or if it's a trick.

She hesitates a second, looks to the orderly, being careful

in case this is a set-up.

The orderly nods. She takes one last look around, then gets

the hell out of the room. Alone, Steele picks up the newspaper

that had been laying face-down on his desk, looks at it, and

shakes his head.

INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - DAY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Carol is there as Christine, now in her regular clothes, comes

dashing in. Carol sees her, goes to her.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     86.

They hug. Christine breaks the hug, and hurries away as Carol

looks on, crying.

INT. HOSPITAL - RECEIVING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

Christine comes to the area where she was checked in. No one

is looking at her. She passes the nurse's station and heads

toward the door. Opens it. Fresh air comes in. Freedom.

She steps out the front door as --

-- a moment later, Briegleb passes through the hallway with

an admissions official, having not seen her.

The official moves on, nervous, as Briegleb looks to the

receiving nurse.

Before she can answer, we jump out to

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Where Christine walks among the sidewalk traffic. Free.

Vindicated. She starts to pass a news-stand, where a NEWS

VENDOR is calling out headlines, peddling papers.

The last line stops Christine...just a bad sense that grows

as she turns to the news vendor, who keeps on going.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   87.

Christine's knees buckle as she hears this. She starts to go

down as Briegleb runs toward her from the hospital.

And she collapses into his arms, sobbing uncontrollably, as

passers-by glance over at her...and continue walking.

But they're just words.   She doesn't hear them.

INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

Captain Jones is pacing nervously in the hallway for a long

BEAT when another officer steps out of an office with a brass

nameplate that reads CHIEF OF POLICE JAMES E DAVIS.

Jones straightens his tie and steps into

INT. CHIEF DAVIS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

lots of dark wood and filtered light. Davis is sitting at

his desk, looking at a series of newspapers in front of him

as Jones steps up and stands before the desk.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   88.

Davis gets up and crosses the room, looking out through the

slatted windows at the busy Los Angeles street outside.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     89.

Davis turns back to him from the window.

Jones doesn't like it, but he swallows his pride.   Nods.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   90.

Jones starts to leave, then looks back as Davis settles back

behind his desk.

And he exits as we go to

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Detective Ybarra is sitting on one side of a table, a notepad

in front of him, staring across at "Walter," who isn't very

happy right now, and is staring back with substantial venom.

His true, nasty personality is free to come out at last.

There's a long BEAT, then:

CHANGELING A True Story                                   91.

"Walter" considers this for a BEAT, then smiles.

Ybarra exchanges a look with the matron, then closes up his

notepad.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   92.

He heads for the door when "Walter" cries out, scared.

And on the boy's face, we HEAR:

INT. JONES' OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Ybarra is standing in the doorway to Jones' office, speaking

to the Captain and looking at his notepad.

Ybarra holds up a missing persons sheet.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    93.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - FLASHBACK

Moments earlier.    PUSHING IN on "Walter" for:

INT. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH - RECTORY - DAY

Christine is in a bed in a small room in the rectory, a tray

beside her, still recovering from her experience. Briegleb

enters and approaches a nearby chair.

She takes a BEAT, then slowly, gingerly gets out of bed.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   94.

She glances out the window, to the police car parked across

the street.

She takes a beat, then turns to him from the window.

EXT. ROW HOUSE - VANCOUVER - EVENING

A series of red-brick rowhouses line a quiet street. We see

couples walking, hand in hand, kids playing...then we notice

Gordon Northcott coming around the corner. He looks around,

then cuts across a yard, jumping over a fence to get to

INT. ROW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

where RACHEL CLARK, 30s, is doing dishes as the doorbell rings.

She opens the door and finds Gordon Northcott standing outside.

There's a flicker of a pause...was she expecting him?

CHANGELING A True Story                                    95.

She steps aside as he enters, looks around.

He passes her and heads upstairs. She steps to the back of

the house, where her husband, BOB, is coming in through the

back, wiping engine grease off his hands with a towel.

She rushes past him into the other room to do just that.

INT. ROWHOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER

Gordon is toweling off his hair when he hears a car door slam

shut. Then another. He peers out the window. Several Royal

Canadian Mounted Police cars have pulled up along the street.

Mounties are getting out, moving quietly toward the house.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     96.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bob quietly lets the Mounties in. They signal for Bob to get

the hell out of there. Guns in hand, they climb the stairs.

Suddenly there's the SOUND of breaking glass from above.

They race up the stairs to find the window broken, and Gordon

fleeing across an adjoining rooftop.

The others take off as he and another Mountie climb through

the broken window in pursuit of Northcott.

EXT. ROWHOUSES - NIGHT

Gordon races up one rooftop, over the top, then leaps to the

next one as, below, Mounties race to keep up with him, WHISTLES

blowing furiously. He looks behind him to see the other two

Mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast.

Gordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance

between himself and the police on the ground...and making

increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop

to rooftop.

He leaps across one chasm, barely makes it, keeps running.

The rooftop Mounties follow. One of them makes the jump

successfully, but the other falls short, plummeting to the

ground three stories below. A leg snaps on impact. The first

Mountie hesitates, looks down. The second one waves him on.

He nods and continues the chase.

Gordon runs for all he's worth.    The Mountie keeps after him.

Gordon makes another leap. The Mountie jumps...but he's short.

He grabs onto a rain gutter. Gordon sees his situation, runs

back, and STOMPS on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to

shake loose. The gutter starts to tear free --

-- when a Mountie down below FIRES at Gordon, making him back

off. The Mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then

grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof. Keeps coming.

Gordon keeps running...but comes to a chasm too wide to be

jumped. He hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction --

-- when the Mountie TACKLES him hard. The two go down in a

tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   97.

They SLIDE down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going

over the edge.

With nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the

punches from both coming fast and furious. Finally, the

Mountie backs off just a bit --

-- and DIVES at Gordon, taking them both off the edge of the

two-story roof and DOWN into --

-- a garden below, CRASHING through carefully manicured flowers

and trees to land with a THUD, the Mountie's impact cushioned

by Gordon.

As the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers

to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise

intact Gordon. Looks at him nose-to-nose.

And he YANKS Gordon toward the other waiting officers.

INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - DAY

Christine opens the door to find Reverend Briegleb and another

man on her porch, S. S. HAHN, late fifties.

She steps aside to let them in, closing the door under:

CHANGELING A True Story                          98.

They do as Christine looks to Briegleb.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    99.

INT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - DAY

Hahn marches into the receiving area with Christine Collins

and Briegleb. He goes to the receiving nurse.

She sees Christine Collins and the sentence dies midway.

Hahn pulls out a handful of papers.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  100.

The nurse exchanges a sour look with Christine and heads off.

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

One by one, the Code Twelve patients are brought out of the

hospital and into the light. One of the last to emerge is

Carol Dexter, who blinks against the light, and sees Christine.

She runs to her, embraces her, sobbing.

And in Christine's face, we see a flicker of pride and one

simple truth: if she could not save her son, she could at

least save these women. As they move toward her, Hahn and

Briegleb, we HEAR a TRAIN WHISTLE that segues us into

EXT. UNION STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY

Gordon Northcott, handcuffed, is led out of a train by several

officers. The waiting PRESS rush toward him. He seems to

enjoy the attention. Among the shouted questions we hear:

CHANGELING A True Story                                   101.

And on that the police hustle Gordon away.

INT. CHIEF DAVIS' OFFICE - DAY

Davis is filling out paperwork as the door opens. He looks

up as LOS ANGELES MAYOR GEORGE CRYER enters, closing the door

after him again.

He drops a series of court documents on Davis' desk.   He picks

them up, examines them.

CHANGELING A True Story                            102.

Cryer shakes his head, walks off a pace.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  103.

He lets the question sit as we go to

EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

Mayor Cryer stands beside Chief Davis and addresses a rather

noisy and worked-up press corps from behind a podium.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    104.

The two head back into

INT. CITY HALL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Glancing back over their shoulders at the press outside.

INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

She opens the door as Briegleb enters with three really large,

dangerous looking men, one of whom is carrying a heavy trench

coat.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     105.

The others nod as they make themselves comfortable in the

living room.

She heads off to get some coffee. As one of the men puts his

coat behind the sofa, we see that it contains a sawed-off

shotgun. Briegleb looks out the window, to where a police

car sits, watching the house.

INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - MORNING

She's dressed in her best dress, putting on a hat and a pair

of gloves. Her hands are shaking. She squeezes them together,

closes her eyes. Focuses. With one final, deep breath, she

heads out.

EXT. COLLINS HOME - MORNING

The same police car is there as Christine gets into a car

with Briegleb and the two drive off. The other three men get

into another car and follow. The police car in turn pulls

away from the curb, following both cars.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - BRIEGLEB'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

He's aware that they're being followed, glancing in the rear

view mirror to keep an eye on things. Looks over to Christine,

smiles encouragingly. Looks ahead.

He turns. The other cars do the same. But the traffic here

is even worse. Just then, Briegleb looks back in his rear

view mirror to see --

-- another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting

off the car with Christine's bodyguards.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  106.

Briegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's

too busy. He looks in the mirror to see that another police

car glide into position two cars behind them.

Traffic stops. Jammed. Briegleb is nervous, sensing the

very real possibility of a hit being set up. The traffic is

lined right up against parked cars on either side. Then

there's a momentary break in traffic.

He turns hard into the driveway of a closed shop and shuts

off the engine. Jumps out and opens the door for Christine,

who gets out.

They do. He glances back at the police car. The two inside

start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being

right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the

other. They run the siren to clear traffic, but it's too

late as --

-- Christine and Briegleb hurry down the street on foot,

Briegleb glancing behind them. The foot- and car-traffic is

very heavy...we HEAR horns honking and, in the distance,

something that could be the sound of lots of people.

Briegleb glances back. The police car has popped its doors,

and two trench-coated officers are getting out. Christine

stops a man passing in the opposite direction.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    107.

He moves on. Briegleb and Collins slowly exchange a look

somewhere between disbelief and "oh shit."

They walk quickly up one clogged street and down another, the

police following on foot...moving toward the SOUND of voices,

drums, and cars honking... until they turn onto Spring Street --

-- and find themselves in the middle of the biggest protest

march ever recorded in the history of Los Angeles to this

date. Thousands of people crowd into the street, overwhelming

the police presence...not rioting, but making their voices

heard.

The Salvation Army, the Women's Temperance Society, the Society

for Justice, Catholic groups, Union groups and ordinary

citizens carrying placards and signs that read WE SUPPORT

CHRISTINE COLLINS and JUSTICE FOR MRS. COLLINS and THE LAPD:

A CITY'S SHAME...it just goes on and on and on. Christine

looks out to see her boss from the telephone company, Mr.

Harris, marching arm in arm with the rest. He sees her,

smiles, tips his hat and continues marching.

Christine is stunned...Briegleb even moreso.

He looks behind them, to where the police have stopped.

There's no way in hell they can make a move in the face of

something as big as t his. Briegleb smiles.

They continue up the street toward City Hall.

INT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY

This is a big room, and one thousand observers fill every

available chair with more standing along the wall in back.

It's a circus. Christine sits with Hahn.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     108.

Briegleb is in a seat behind the main section.    FLASHBULBS

pop as THORPE, a city councilman, speaks.

SUPERIMPOSE: OCTOBER 24, 1928

EXT. CITY HALL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Speakers are lowered from the window into the parking lot

where hundreds of others are gathered to listen.

BACK TO SCENE

As Thorpe looks to the other members of the Council, and the

area where witnesses are supposed to wait to be called upon.

A number of seats are empty.

A REPORTER raises his hand, then stands.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    109.

There's APPLAUSE from the crowd which breaks up into pockets

of discussion as a BAILIFF approaches Hahn and whispers into

his ear. Hahn nods, looks to Christine.

Puzzled, curious, Christine gets up and exits with Hahn.

INT. LA COUNTY COURTHOUSE -   HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Hahn is moving quickly down the hall toward a courtroom door,

Christine following.

He gets to the door, pauses. Looks back to her.    She nods.

He opens the door and they enter

CHANGELING A True Story                                  110.

INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dead silence, in marked contrast to the city council room.

As she enters, she sees people sitting silently in the

gallery...row after row of couples, mothers and fathers, some

weeping softly. Some of them notice Christine's entrance and

nod to her with sadness and a strange sense of common

bond...they are all carrying the same grief.

One of the couples, MR. AND MRS. CLAY, see Christine and go

to her, speaking softly. They should be distinct enough in

appearance that we will recognize them instantly when we see

them again later.

She nods her thanks as a door at the other end of the courtroom

opens. They take their seats as a judge and two attorneys

take their places, preceded by a bailiff.

They do. The judge takes his seat. The rest of the room

also sits. He nods to the bailiff, who in turn opens another

door, leading to the holding area.

As Christine looks on, Gordon Stewart Northcott is ushered

into the courtroom for his initial plea. Some women break

into tears at the sight of him. He first seems startled by

the presence of so many, then he smiles. An audience.

As he takes his place beside his attorney, he looks down the

room and meets the gaze of Christine Collins. Her face pales,

as though slapped...but she doesn't look away.

The bailiff forcibly turns him around to face the judge.

Christine's hands grip the seat she's in until her knuckles

turn white...but she doesn't allow him the satisfaction of

seeing her react to his comments. The judge looks up.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  111.

He glances back at his audience.   The bailiff rights him again.

The bailiff removes Gordon, who shares one last look with his

audience, and Christine in particular. He winks at her. She

doesn't give him a flicker of satisfaction with a reaction.

But once he's gone, she sits heavily and covers her eyes,

fighting tears. Hahn puts a hand on her shoulder, but says

nothing. There's nothing to say.

INT. CITY COUNCIL ROOM - DAY

Jones is at last on the stand. Hahn stands before him, the

rest of the City Council, Christine and the huge audience

looking on.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      112.

Hahn turns away, playing to the council and the audience.

The crowd applauds and cheers.    Joes fights to be heard.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    113.

There's laughter from the gallery.   He doesn't like it.

Hahn goes to the exhibit table, picks up several papers.

CHANGELING A True Story                                      114.

More murmuring from the crowd.

This silences both Jones and the crowd. You could hear a pin

drop. Hahn approaches Jones, and now speaks softly.

Jones looks to Chief Davis.   It's a moment.    Then:

Christine's face falls into her hands.   The place erupts.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  115.

Hahn walks away from a devastated looking Jones.

EXT. UNION STATION - DAY

A small crowd is assembled at the front of the station, where

Chief Davis stands with the Boy who had been "Walter" as a

train pulls up before them.

Just then, he turns as a Matron comes off the train with JANET

HUTCHINS, middle thirties, the boy's mother.

She goes to him and hugs him. "Walter" looks like he wishes

he were somewhere on Mars. Davis moves closer to them to be

in frame while the FLASHBULBS pop. She's in the same pose as

they got Christine to take when she "accepted" her lost son.

He towsels the boy's head like he'd like to cut it off. Then

he nods to an aide, who approaches with a bundle of clothes.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    116.

She yanks him away.   Davis smiles gamely at the reporters.

MONTAGE

Shot MOS, under MUSIC, somber and moving, INTERCUTTING between

the two trials.

Christine on the stand, speaking quietly.

Officer Ybarra on the stand.

Chief Davis on the stand.

The murder jury being shown photographs of the Northcott ranch.

Walter's dentist showing a drawing of Walter's teeth.

His teacher, Mrs. Fox, also testifying.

Bits of clothing entered into evidence.

Dr. Steele testifying.

Ending on Christine seated, reserved, holding it all in...

watching. We HOLD on her face to bring us into --

INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Christine is sitting on Walter's bed. She runs a hand along

the sheets, straightening and smoothing them out, her eyes

moist but not crying. We HEAR a knock on the front door

downstairs, and the door opening.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  117.

She continues as Briegleb comes up the stairs and enters the

room. Sees her. Takes off his hat. A show of sympathy.

Christine nods, taking it in, then:

CHANGELING A True Story                                     118.

She nods absently, finishes adjusting the sheets.   He checks

his watch.

She nods again, and stands. He heads out of the room, and

she lingers for a moment, taking one last look around before

turning off the night-light, and sees the drawing he made of

the two of them walking together beneath an orange sun. HOLD

on that image as we HEAR a gavel hammering and:

INT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY

PUSHING IN on Thorpe, at the center of the council's long

table, addressing the crowd and Christine.

INTERCUT WITH

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Where Northcott stands before the judge, jury, and the grieving

family members.

INT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

Still pushing in.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     119.

APPLAUSE erupts from the gallery at this.

INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Quietly PUSHING IN on Northcott, the Judge, Jury, others.

The bailiff complies. The judge reads it, hands it back to

the Bailiff, who brings it back to the Foreman.

INT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

As before.

Even louder applause, some cheering. The pattern continues

through the balance of the statement.

INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Favoring Northcott.

Northcott rises, still smiling, defiant.

INT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

As before.

CHANGELING A True Story                                 120.

The place explodes with cheers.

INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

As the foreman stands again.

There are gasps and cries and tears...but Northcott is defiant.

He looks to her.   She doesn't flinch.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     121.

The defense attorney yanks Gordon around to face the judge.

And he brings down the gavel.

EXT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

Christine is standing outside, putting the horrors of the day

out of her thoughts, as a door opens and Chief Davis comes

out, followed by several reporters.

He pauses as he sees Christine.    Looks away and continues in

a lowered voice.

The press continue after him, not really noticing Christine,

who takes one last look around at it all...and walks slowly

away. Alone.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     122.

INT. STREET CAR - MORNING

Christine, alone, rides the street car to work. The car stops

in front of a school. Walter's school. She looks out the

window, to where children are playing. Then looks away again

as the street-car starts moving again.

INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY

Christine is back at work again, as she had been, though some

of the light has gone out of her eyes. She moves from station

to station, nodding her approval or checking off forms. She

glances to the clock, it's a little after two, then goes to

Mr. Harris, who has just come out onto the floor.

She starts away, turning at:

She heads off toward a back room. He watches her go with a

combination of awe, respect and deep sadness.

INT. PHONE COMPANY - BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Christine is on the telephone, crossing off contact numbers

on a pad of paper.

She checks his number off her list as Hahn appears in the

partially open door behind her.

CHANGELING A True Story                                        123.

He's heard part of the conversation, and there's a sadness in

his eyes.

She starts to dial again when he knocks on the door.     She

turns to see him, mid-dial.

His tone is grave, and she knows that something's happened.

She hangs up the phone, missing the cradle the first time.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

Christine is on the train headed north.   The telegram is in

her hand.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    124.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SAN QUENTIN PRISON - AFTERNOON

She gets out of a taxi in front of the prison.    It's a gray,

grim sight, and moves toward it.

INT. SAN QUENTIN - INTERVIEW ROOM - AFTERNOON

Four bare walls and a long table. Two chairs. One window,

behind bars and chicken wire. Christine waits, alone. Then:

we HEAR footsteps approaching down the hall. A moment later,

a PRISON GUARD escorts Northcott into the room. Northcott

nods to Christine, then glances to the guard, who looks to

Christine.

The guard exits, leaving the two alone.

He nods, walks to the window to a nearby structure.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  125.

He looks to Christine, smiles nervously, glances back out the

window.

He stops himself.   Turns from the window.

She shakes her head.   He nods absently for a moment.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  126.

He's pacing, growing more agitated and scared.

He turns from her, in anguish...but is he just playing her?

She goes around to him, faces him.

He turns almost against his will...meets her eyes.

His eyes go wide and he CRIES OUT, stumbling back and away

from her.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    127.

The guard enters, going to Northcott.

She pushes past him to Northcott, grabs the front of his shirt.

He screams in anguish, and the guard hauls him out, closing

the door after him. Christine tries to open the door, but it

won't open.

She slowly slides to the floor, crying as we HEAR the SOUND

of CHAINS clanking, and we....

INT. EXECUTION AREA - NIGHT

The door to the prison yard opens and closes as Northcott is

led into the area with the scaffolding. The Warden is there,

waiting at the foot of the gallows, along with a chaplain.

Several other parents, including Mr. and Mrs. Clay, are in

the witness gallery at the back, separated from the gallows

area by a large plate glass window. Christine is among the

parents. The Clays see her, and put a hand on her arm for

strength. Christine nods, accepting it, and moves to one

side.

Northcott, legs and arms bound in chains, makes his way to

the warden at the base of the gallows. A clock reads 9:50.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  128.

The chaplain nods silently as the warden looks to the guards,

who begin to escort Northcott up the steps to the gallows.

They struggle with him now, pushing and carrying him up the

last of the thirteen steps to the top. They tie his legs

together, and cinch his arms tightly in place.

They start to slip a black felt mask over his head and secure

the rope. He looks desperately to the witnesses.

The mask goes on and is tightened into place. The executioner

approaches the handle that will open the trap door. The warden

looks to the clock...9:59. From beneath the hood we HEAR, in

a terrified, shaking voice:

Just then the warden nods to the executioner who pulls the

lever and the trap door JERKS OPEN.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   129.

Northcott FALLS through the door six feet then there's a

SNAP...and the body bounces in SLOW MOTION at the end of the

rope...as we HEAR the sound of his heart

slowing...slowing...until it finally stops.

Christine covers her eyes. There is no cheering in the witness

room. Only the sound of weeping.

EXT. SAN QUENTIN - NIGHT

Slowly, the witnesses exit the prison. We find Christine

among them. She nods good-night to some of them, including

the Clays, then starts off on her own, heading into the night.

BLACK SCREEN

SUPERIMPOSE: FIVE YEARS LATER.   FEBRUARY 27, 1935

And: SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF WALTER COLLINS

EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - AFTERNOON

Just to ESTABLISH, then:

INT. TELEPHONE COMPANY - CHRISTINE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

The brass plate on the partially open door announces C.

COLLINS, ASSISTANT MANAGER. She's filling out paperwork as

there's a KNOCK and a group of other employees and operators

appears in the doorway.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    130.

They head off. Christine focuses on her work.     There's another

knock on the door.

She looks up to see Ben Harris in the doorway.    He smiles.

He nods, taking the rejection well.   Starts off when:

And with a smile, he's gone.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     131.

INT. TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - NIGHT

The night shift operators are working, a smaller group but

still busy. We PAN through them until we start to HEAR the

sound of radio-miked applause, then:

INT. CHRISTINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Where Christine is still working as the Academy Awards of

1935 play themselves out on the radio.

APPLAUSE comes through the radio...and Christine is as pleased

as if she'd just won herself.

She's just about to go back to her work when the phone rings.

She picks it up, smiling.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  132.

She stops.   It's not Ben on the phone.

She freezes at something she hears.

She hangs up, grabs her coat, and races out the door.

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Christine climbs out of a taxi and rushes into the station.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Christine is ushered into a room with a long two-way mirror

that looks out into an interview room. Mr. and Mrs. Clay are

already there. In the other room is Detective Ybarra, and a

young boy, DAVID, age 13. Mrs. Clay sees her, and they

embrace.

Mr. Clay motions for them to shush. They turn their attention

to the other room, where Ybarra looks up from making notes.

CHANGELING A True Story                                     133.

EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

David is shoved into the chicken coop. Several other BOYS

are already there, scared, crying. They lunge at the door,

trying to get out, but it slams shut in their faces.

They scream, trying to get out.   Gordon SLAMS an arm against

the door, scaring them.

He laughs and moves off, Sanford accompanying him, looking

very guilty.

INT. CHICKEN COOP - LATER

PANNING the boys huddled against one wall, scared.

We STOP PAN on the last kid...on Walter Collins, at last.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - VIEWING ROOM

As Christine REACTS to this, her hand flying to her mouth.

Not daring to breathe.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    134.

Christine covers her face.     Can barely stand up.

INT. CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT

Two of the kids, Walter and Jeffrey, are sitting in a corner,

talking quietly, urgently.

They pull at the wiring.    Part of the roof weakens and dust

sifts down.

CHANGELING A True Story                                   135.

And in an echo of what he told his mother the last time he

saw her:

The Winslow kids nod, and start crying.   Jeffrey and Walter

look to the rest.

David holds up his hand.

The Winslow boys and two others scramble to the other end,

too terrified to try and escape. Jeffrey, David and Walter

go to the weakened corner of the coop.

They nod, and get into position, each taking a part of the

wire framework.

They do so, pulling for all they're worth...struggling...the

ceiling SHIFTS above them, dirt falling all over the place...

they pull harder, the wire cutting into fingers, but still

pulling...then suddenly --

-- the corner FALLS AWAY, part of the roof starting to come

down with it. The NOISE is substantial.

CHANGELING A True Story                                    136.

They race out the opening, Jeffrey first, then Walter, then

David...but just as the first two get clear --

Walter turns to see David stuck in the wiring. LIGHTS go on

around the ranch. He hesitates...then RUNS back to David,

helps to untangle him. They HEAR a SHOTGUN blast, and FEET

running their way.

Walter gets him untangled, and the two RACE away from the

coop, running for all they're worth as a FLASHLIGHT hits first

one, then the other. They RUN --

-- and David catches one last glimpse of Walter running,

heading for the line of trees....

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT

As the interview continues.   David nods.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  137.

David looks away, his eyes tearing up.   Finally:

And it's all Mrs. Clay can take. Sobbing, she runs out of

the viewing room and into the interview room, where she goes

to her son and embraces him, holds him, the two crying into

one another's arms.

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Christine and Ybarra watch as Mr. and Mrs. Clay lead their

son into their car. As they drive off, Christine finally

breaks the silence.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  138.

She looks at him...and smiles.

She turns and walks off into the night, as we SUPERIMPOSE:

Gordon Stewart Northcott was hanged on October 2, 1935

In exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea, Sanford

Wesley Clark was sentenced to the Whittier State School for

Boys for five years. Upon being released in 1934, he returned

home to Canada, and was never heard from again.

Upon returning to duty after his suspension, Captain J. J.

Jones was demoted to Lieutenant and subsequently sued by

Christine Collins in civil court. He was found guilty and

fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars). He never

paid.

One year after the City Council recommended the removal of

the Los Angeles Chief of Police, James E Davis resigned from

office and was replaced by Roy E. Steckel.

CHANGELING A True Story                                  139.

Davis reclaimed that office in 1933, where he created the Red

Squad, notorious for attacking Communists and their offices,

but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of police

corruption.

In the aftermath of the City Council hearings, the criminal

justice system in California was revised to prevent women

from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime of

disagreeing with a male police officer. Strict medical

procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse.

In November 1929, Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer was voted

out of office after three terms. He was later found to have

been the front man for the Crawford Organized Crime Syndicate,

which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout Southern

California.

For the rest of his life, Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb used

his radio show to expose police misconduct and political

corruption. He also published "The Layman's Handbook of

Daniel."

The California community of Wineville, near Riverside, became

synonymous with the infamous Northcott Murder Ranch. In order

to shake free of the scandal, the residents changed its name

to Mira Loma.

Christine Collins never stopped searching for her son.

The fate of Walter Collins remains a mystery. If he was able

to escape the Northcott Ranch, he would be 86 years old today.
