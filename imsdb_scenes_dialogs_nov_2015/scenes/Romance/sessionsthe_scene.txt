Mark asks a question.

Mark stares at her lovingly.

INT.    MARK'S PLACE.     DAY

From Mark's POV, Amanda slides him out of the iron lung. It

is her first time, and it is an awkward business.

It is some time later. Amanda is giving Mark a massage. With

enormous satisfaction, he feels her curvy parts moving around

him and sometimes pressing against him. He also gets a bird's

eye view of her breasts.

EXT.   PARK.   DAY

Mark, on a blanket, is on an outing with Amanda, Matt and

another COUPLE. They are playing Scrabble.

She finishes shaving him and cleans him up. His eyes feast on

every detail of her face.

Cut to somewhere at night, Amanda is giving Mark a pole

dancing demonstration, complete with disco beat and mirror-

ball lighting.

Amanda wheels Mark towards a clothing store.

INT.   CLOTHING STORE.    DAY

Amanda is wheeling Mark in his gurney around the store,

stopping from time to time to take something down from the

shelf. She picks out a shirt.

As she leans over to show it to him, Mark doesn't seem to be

listening. He whispers to her.

She says nothing and gives the faintest of smiles, then puts

the shirt back. They continue round the store in thoughtful

silence and avoid eye contact with each other. We sense from

the looks on their faces that this moment spells the end of a

beautiful friendship.

INT. SIDE CHAPEL.   DAY

Mark and Father Brendan are huddled together in the little

chapel.

Mark looks troubled.

At that very moment, there is a click, and the tape runs out.

Vera flips the tape over, sets it running in record mode, and

takes her place again behind Mark's gurney.

INT.   MARK'S PLACE.     DAY

Rod vacuums the floor while Mark taps away on his typewriter.

Mark looks troubled.

We hear voices.

We hear the cassette recorder click on.

Greg is a handsome quadriplegic. Vera is there with Mark.

Mark thinks.

Mark comes back to reality.

EXT.   STREET NEAR CARMEN'S.   DAY

ROD is wheeling Mark along in his gurney.

They arrive at CARMEN'S PLACE.

INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    DAY

Cheryl thinks.

INT.   LAURA'S OFFICE.    DAY

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE. NIGHT

Father Brendan approaches and arrives at the front door. He

rings. Rod lets him in.

INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT

Mark is in his iron lung. Father Brendan, wearing civilian

clothes, comes in with a 6 pack of beer.

EXT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    NIGHT

As usual, Cheryl's car is out front.

INT.   BEDROOM.   NIGHT

Cheryl crawls into bed beside Josh. She lies there with her

eyes wide open, unable to sleep, her mind full of thoughts.

Although she has not yet noticed, Josh is also awake.

They get into the business.

INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    DAY

Mark is also awake, staring at nothing, his mind full of

thoughts. As a distraction, he eventually turns and looks at

the picture of the Virgin Mary.

INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    DAY

The phone rings. We hear footsteps approaching. Cheryl

answers it.

She smiles.

INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    DAY

Mark is in his iron lung.

INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    DAY

INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    DAY

INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    DAY

Cheryl smiles.

EXT.   CAFE.   DAY

A WAITER approaches Cheryl and Mark with two beautifully made

cups of coffee. One of them has a straw accompanying it. He

sets them down. Mark looks up at the waiter.

The waiter does exactly as asked.

The waiter leaves. Mark and Cheryl look at each other.

Cheryl smiles at him. She is looking gorgeous today.

He sips on his coffee and soaks her in with his eyes.

EXT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   DAY

Josh walks unhurriedly to the letter box at the front gate

and collects the mail. As he flips through the envelopes, he

stops at one which is addressed to Cheryl, sniffs it, then

opens it. It contains a sheet of paper on which is typed what

seems to be a poem. He reads it with interest, which develops

into mild shock.

INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   DAY

Cheryl and Josh are in the kitchen, arguing.

Tony arrives home from school. As he comes in, his parents

fall silent. He realizes he has walked in on an argument. He

looks at both of them.

A LITTLE LATER. The three of them are sitting round the

dining table eating dinner in total silence. The hostility

between Cheryl and Josh is palpable. When Josh finally does

speak, he addresses Tony.

Cheryl glares at Tony and goes on with her meal.

INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    NIGHT

Cheryl is at the dining table, with her recorder and file in

front of her, plus a late-night snack.

INT.   BEDROOM.   NIGHT

Josh crawls into bed with Cheryl. She is still awake. He

snuggles up to her.

INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   NIGHT

Cheryl rummages around in the kitchen garbage. She finds

nothing. She storms off to the laundry, flings open a

cupboard, pokes around and comes up with a flashlight.

EXT.   CHERYL'S BACK YARD.   NIGHT

Cheryl makes her way to the end of the yard. Holding the

flashlight between her teeth, she rummages around in the

outdoor trash bin. Finally, she finds what she is looking

for. An envelope. She takes the poem out of the envelope and

reads it.

She goes over to the back steps, sits down and continues

reading.

She puts it back in the envelope and walks back inside the

house. She is visibly affected.

EXT.   STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE.   DAY

From behind, we see Vera wheeling Mark in his gurney. ANOTHER

FEMALE FIGURE creeps up beside Vera and whispers in her ear,

all unbeknownst to Mark. The other female figure takes over

from Vera, who trails along, a few feet behind. Mark remains

unaware. He has a new and different-looking shirt, even more

out there than the previous one?

Mark can barely believe it.

EXT.   PARK.   DAY

They are stopped at a park bench. Vera is hovering in the

background, out of earshot.

She laughs, then smiles quietly, then touches him.

Mark's face is a picture of anguish and confusion.

INT. SIDE CHAPEL.     DAY

Mark lets out a deep, meaningful sigh. For a time, he and

Father Brendan maintain a respectful silence.

EXT.   PARK.   DAY

She leans over and kisses Mark on the lips.

INT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY

EXT.   MOTEL.    DAY

Cheryl's car is in the parking lot. We see her draw the

blinds.

INT.   MOTEL RECEPTION.    DAY

Clerk takes two beers from a mini-bar and hands one to Vera.

The clerk looks at her closely. She appears to have a

completely straight face.

INT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY

Mark and Cheryl are in bed, their faces close.

They kiss. Then Cheryl's head slides down and disappears from

view.

Mark closes his eyes.

INT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY

INT. SOMEWHERE. NIGHT

Amanda is giving Mark a pole dancing demonstration, complete

with disco beat and mirror-ball lighting.

INT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY

Mark opens his eyes and looks up at Cheryl. She seems divine.

His excitement increases. We hear the change in his

breathing. Also in her breathing.

INT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY

The expression of elation on Mark's face morphs dramatically

into something else.

Father Brendan closes his eyes and nods knowingly.

EXT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   NIGHT

The Volvo is parked out front. The envelope is still on the

dash.

INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.      NIGHT

Cheryl is dictating.

INT.   MOTEL ROOM.   DAY

We see Mark's face from Cheryl's POV. His eyes are still

closed.

We hear Mark's thoughts.

We hear the sound of typing.

INT.    MARK'S PLACE.      DAY

Mark is in his iron lung, typing. At the top of the page, we

can see the title of the piece:

"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate" Page 8.

INT.   MOTEL ROOM.   DAY

We see Cheryl's face from Mark's POV. It is as beatific as we

have ever seen it.

Cheryl's actions follow Mark's description.

INT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY

Mark is with Father Brendan.

INT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY

Cheryl's lips move away from Mark's chest. She kisses him on

the lips, light and lingering. As soon as there is enough

space between them, he whispers to her.

She whispers back.

INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.       NIGHT

Cheryl continues dictating.

Cheryl pauses, then goes on.

Tony appears. He seems to have some understanding of what is

going on. He and Cheryl hug.

INT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY

They are still in the same intimate position.

INT.   MOTEL RECEPTION.   DAY

The clerk looks bored. Vera looks at the time. She seems a

little anxious.

INT.    MOTEL ROOM.   DAY

The phone rings, Cheryl picks it up.

LATER

Cheryl, already dressed, is getting Mark dressed. She does up

every button of his shirt lovingly.

Mark doesn't answer.

She finishes buttoning him up in silence. A strange feeling,

a kind of chill that Cheryl senses, pervades the atmosphere.

Cheryl is getting dressed. Mark watches pensively. She pauses

and looks at him. He keeps a brave face. There is a knock on

the door.

She and Mark make eye contact for the last time. They manage

to smile at each other.

Apart from her usual things, she is also carrying a long

mirror.

As Cheryl goes out, Vera comes in.

Vera walks in and closes the door behind her.

EXT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY

Cheryl goes to her car and opens the trunk. As she is putting

the mirror inside, the Chinese clerk, who is showing a COUPLE

to their room, gives her an odd look. Cheryl takes no notice,

gets in her car and starts the engine.

Just then, Vera runs up and taps on her window. The window

winds down. Vera hands Cheryl an envelope with money in it.

At first, Cheryl just looks at it, then realizes what it is.

Cheryl smiles.

Vera waves goodbye as she goes and Cheryl sits contemplating

the envelope in her lap. Then she tosses it onto the dash and

drives away.

EXT.   STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE.   DAY

Vera wheels Mark home. They travel in silence.

INT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY

Father Brendan and Mark are together in the chapel.

Time passes.

INT.   MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT

It is a moonlit night. On the opposite wall from the Virgin

Mary is a picture of Amanda and Mark. Mark lies in his iron

lung staring at it.

The poem ends and we hear instead a RADIO BROADCAST of a

Giants' game. Mark is engrossed. Suddenly the broadcast

stops. The digital read-out on the clock radio, which says

12:57, disappears. A street light, visible through the

window, goes out. The electric pump under Mark's iron lung

whirrs to a halt. We hear the sound of air escaping, then an

eerie silence. Even the cat is motionless.

For a few moments, Mark seems hypnotized. Then, he twists his

head and clamps onto his mouth stick. He manoeuvres it over

to the speaker button on the phone and manages to press it in

the semi-darkness. We hear a dial tone.

INT.   ROD'S BEDROOM.    NIGHT

There is an answering machine on a bedside table.

INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT

Mark winces in frustration.

He swings the mouth stick over to the 9 button. As he presses

it, he loses his grip and the mouth stick falls to the floor.

At first, he seems panicky, but after a few moments he begins

to control his breathing and gradually psyches himself into a

strange calm.

Time passes. We see Mark from a high angle. More time passes.

We see Mark's face as he slips into unconsciousness.

INT.   MIKVAH (JEWISH RITUAL BATH-HOUSE).    DAY

Cheryl enters the room wrapped in a white, terry cloth robe.

The room is dominated by a small, beautifully tiled immersion

pool with a hand rail and steps. The MIKVAH LADY gets up from

her chair and approaches her.

She takes off her robe and hands it to the Mikvah Lady, who

does not fail to notice Cheryl's body.

Cheryl closes her eyes and thinks for a moment.

Cheryl steps towards the pool.

She takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water.

Cheryl takes another step into the water.

Cheryl immerses herself up to her chest.

She immerses completely. We see her under the water. She

hears a voice in the distance, her own voice. At the same

time, there is a look of elation in her eyes.

INT.   MOTEL ROOM.   DAY

Mark is on the bed alone. He opens his eyes.

A few feet in front of Mark, Cheryl is holding a full-length

mirror. The angle is such that he can see all of himself. He

is mesmerized by his own image. Flashes of light from the

mirror flicker over his face.

INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR.   DAY

Overhead fluorescent lights flash by, as we observe the

ceiling from Mark's point of view. We also hear the sound of

rapidly rolling rubber wheels, and a voice.

INT.   HOSPITAL.   DAY

Mark is in a regular hospital bed, with a temporary plastic

cocoon over him in place of his iron lung. There is a

volunteer called SUSAN in the room with him.

Mark breaks into a broad smile, then a chuckle.

EXT.   HOSPITAL.   DAY

She smiles. Mark is loaded into an ambulance.

She gets into the ambulance and squats down next to him.

She looks genuinely pleased to hear it.

The driver is ready to shut the doors.

She gets out of the ambulance and waves.

INT.   AMBULANCE.     DAY

Mark is accompanied by an AMBULANCE OFFICER. We see clear

blue sky through the back windows. The sun shines in and

warms Mark's face. He closes his eyes in contentment.

EXT. HOSPITAL.      DAY

We see the disappearing figure of Susan from the point of

view of the departing ambulance.

INT.   MARK'S PLACE.        DAY

Rod shows Father Brendan into Mark's room.

She takes it and opens it uncertainly, somehow anticipating

its contents.

EXT.   CHURCH.   DAY

A full-blown Catholic funeral is happening. Meaningful hugs

are exchanged. Eyes are dabbed. We hear Mark's voice.

INT.   CHURCH.   DAY

Father Brendan delivers a eulogy. We see members of Mark's

FAMILY, all teary-eyed.

We see Rod, Vera and Laura the therapist in various rows.

Also Amanda, holding a toddler in her arms and sitting next

to a tall, boring-looking HUSBAND.

We see SUSAN at the lectern, reading from a book.

We see Cheryl, as deeply touched by the words as she was the

first time.

INT.   MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT

In the middle of the room, moonlit, is Mark's iron lung,

empty and majestic, with the cat sitting on top. As we move

around the eerie capsule, we hear the sound of the French Can-

Can slowly fade up. It continues over END CREDITS.
