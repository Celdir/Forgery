FADE IN (BEFORE TITLES)

EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK

Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the

oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country --

a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy

clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking.

CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a

fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting

from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and

louder until the sound of a train can be recognized.

CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a

man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is

upon us, flashing by with a roar.

Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the

embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the

thick underbrush alongside the tracks.

CLOSE SHOT -- BODY

It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS

AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the

train fades off until there is silence once more.

TITLE MUSIC begins with a crash.

DELETED

FADE IN:

EXT. MEGEVE -- DAY

A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side

overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck --

tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers.

One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl.

She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite

activity -- eating.

Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS

CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining,

black and ugly in the sunlight.

REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.

The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun

shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight

into REGGIE's face.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Including JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks

at him sternly.

WIDER ANGLE

SYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early

thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join

REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS.

JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so

lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of

cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee.

No answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as

REGGIE continues eating.

REGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards

the devastated table before following.

INT. SWIMMING POOL -- DAY

A magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow-

covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows

beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their

conversation continuing.

EXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAY

An open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun-

worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear,

their conversation continuing.

She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over

her. She wheels, terrified.

CLOSE SHOT -- PERUVIAN SNOW-MASK

A strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the

face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The eyes inside this

particular mask stare down at REGGIE.

CAMERA PANS down to include JEAN-LOUIS, his hand held firmly

by the man in the mask.

WIDER ANGLE

Including REGGIE, MAN, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE is too

terrified to answer. Realizing this, the man, PETER JOSHUA,

takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face.

Eyeing one, then the other, SYLVIE sizes up the situation

and rises.

SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS start off, but not before the boy

squirts PETER with his pistol.

DELETED

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

Her face clouding.

EXT. AVENUE FOCH -- LAMPERT APARTMENT HOUSE -- DAY

The Arc de Triomphe at the far end of the Avenue. CAMERA

PANS to pick up a TAXI as it pulls up before the handsome

building. Inside are REGGIE, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS.

MED. SHOT -- TAXI -- LAMPERT APARTMENT HOUSE

As REGGIE climbs out and the DRIVER begins unloading her

suitcases.

JEAN-LOUIS sticks his head out of the taxi window.

MED. SHOT -- THE TAXI

REGGIE looks at SYLVIE, surprised.

REGGIE walks toward the house with the driver, who carries

her cases.  She presses the button that electrically opens

the front door.

DELETED

INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY

As the elevator rises REGGIE gets out, followed by the driver.

He puts down the bags in front of the apartment door.

The driver leaves. She goes to the door and presses the

minuterie, the button that turns on the time-light, and the

lights come on. Then she rings the doorbell. There is no

answer. She rings again. Still nothing. Sighing, she digs

out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock. At this

moment the minuterie expires, plunging the scene into

darkness.

She finds the button and the light goes on again. She inserts

the key and turns it.

INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- ENTRANCE HALL -- DAY

CLOSE SHOT -- DOOR as it opens and REGGIE steps into the

CLOSE SHOT.

She stops, her expression changing.

REVERSE SHOT

From REGGIE's p.o.v. as CAMERA PANS the entrance hall. It is

bare -- no furniture, no rug, no pictures, no nothing.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

She stares for a moment, then goes back out into the landing.

INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY

As REGGIE steps back outside. She looks at the nameplate

beside the door.

INSERT NAMEPLATE

It reads "MR. AND MRS. CHARLES LAMPERT."

INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY

REGGIE looks at the plate in disbelief, then turns and hurries

back into the apartment.

INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DAY

As REGGIE hurries into the entrance hall.

No answer.

Now, CAMERA FOLLOWING, she goes into the Salon. It is also

empty -- stripped bare. There are squares of the wall's

original color where paintings used to hang, the hooks still

in the wall.

She rushes now, going into the bedroom, CAMERA FOLLOWING

crazily, lurching and careening behind her. The bedroom,

too, is empty. She goes to the built-in wardrobe closets and

throws open all the doors. Only some hangers remain.

She pulls open the drawers -- nothing!

She turns, and running now, goes through another door to the

library, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The rows of shelves are as empty

as the rest of the apartment. She begins to turn in a circle,

looking for something, anything. In a panic she turns and

runs out, colliding suddenly with a MAN whom she (and we)

have not noticed until the moment of impact.

REGGIE screams.

CLOSE SHOT -- INSPECTOR GRANDPIERRE

A heavy-set man of no particular age with tobacco-colored

hair, and thick glasses.

WIDER ANGLE

Including REGGIE, in a state of near-shock.

INT. MORGUE -- DAY

We see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too-

familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin.

ANOTHER ANGLE -- OVERHEAD

Looking straight down at the tops of REGGIE's, GRANDPIERRE's

and an ATTENDANT's head and smack into the open drawer.

GRANDPIERRE lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and

reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe.

He stoops to read it. Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then

moves to the other end to uncover the head.  As the sheet

starts to lift:

REVERSE SHOT

REGGIE as she looks down into the CAMERA. She closes her

eyes for a moment, then looks again.

She nods.

She nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the SHOT.

GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen ATTENDANT.

CAMERA suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the

wall. BLACKNESS comes with a loud clang and continues while

the echo dies.

INT. GRANDPIERRE'S OFFICE -- DAY

CLOSE SHOT -- DESK DRAWER (FROM ABOVE) as it is pulled open.

A photograph of Charles Lampert lies face up in the drawer.

A hand reaches in and pulls it out.

WIDER ANGLE

Including GRANDPIERRE sitting behind his desk, and REGGIE,

sitting across from him. The office is as bare as most

policemen's offices. GRANDPIERRE studies the photo.

She starts to rummage through her bag. GRANDPIERRE shoves a

package of French cigarettes across the desk to her. But she

pulls a package of nuts out of her bag. She begins separating

the shells with her thumb nail and eating the nuts, depositing

the shells in the ashtray. GRANDPIERRE watches this for an

instant.

GRANDPIERRE sighs, puts down his pencil and pushes a button

on the desk. He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it

into his mouth.

He rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into

the drawer, closing it fiercely. A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN sticks

his head in the door.

The POLICEMAN leaves and closes the door.

He opens the desk drawer, puts the cigar back in his mouth

and lights a match by scratching it against the glass desk-

top before he remembers REGGIE's request. He puts it back in

the drawer again. The door opens and the POLICEMAN enters

again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits

on GRANDPIERRE's desk, and leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into

the basket.

He begins to take them out, placing them on the desk,

identifying each item as he does.

GRANDPIERRE hands her the letter and watches her closely as

she reads it.

He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts

to put the things back into the basket while he speaks:

He reaches into the desk drawer and pulls out a passport

which he hands to her.

INSERT -- PASSPORT

The cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it

to a picture of a man -- the man we saw in GRANDPIERRE's

photo. Under it is the name: "CHARLES LAMPERT."

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

He hands her another passport.

INSERT -- SECOND PASSPORT

The cover is American. When it is opened, we see the identical

picture, but the name under it reads: "CHARLES VOSS."

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

He hands her, one at a time, two more passports.

INSERT -- THIRD AND FOURTH PASSPORTS

One is Italian which, when opened, shows the same photo with

the name "CARLO FABRI." The other is Venezuelan, the same

photo, and the name "CARLOS MORENO."

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

REGGIE looks down at the four passports, then back to

GRANDPIERRE.

INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DUSK

The house is empty as before. Now it is silent, the late

afternoon light coming from outside. REGGIE stands by a

window. A canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby.

Suddenly there is the noise of a DOOR OPENING.

CLOSER SHOT -- REGGIE

As her head turns, in alarm, toward the noise. There is a

moment of silence, then FOOTSTEPS are heard, coming closer.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As PETER enters.

A silence.

He looks around for the light switch, then goes to it and

flicks it on -- nothing happens. He flicks it a few more

times.

She shakes her head. PETER looks around.

She nods. He picks up the airlines bag and they start out.

REGGIE stops at the door and looks back.

INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY

CLOSE SHOT of a phonograph. A hand appears, starts the record

on it spinning, then places the arm at the beginning.

An instant later ORGAN MUSIC starts with a roar.

INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY

CLOSE SHOT of the coffin. It rests on a low platform, with a

bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open.

Inside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie

the remnants of Charles Lampert.

CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

The INSPECTOR sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his

hands in a prayer-like attitude. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing

row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large,

dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room. Finally, in the first row,

REGGIE and SYLVIE are discovered. Besides GRANDPIERRE, they

are the only ones present. REGGIE turns around to look at

the empty room. They speak in whispers.

CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

His eyes still lowered. CAMERA PANS DOWN to feature his hands --

he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper.

TWO SHOT -- SYLVIE AND REGGIE

The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of

daylight streams in. The WOMEN turn.

MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the

bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes

the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in

his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard

bird. Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel.

CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

As he watches GIDEON.

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

As she watches him.

MED. SHOT -- THE BIER

GIDEON arrives at the coffin. He stops, looks down at

LAMPERT's body for a moment. Then, suddenly, in rapid

succession, he sneezes six times. He takes a small bottle

from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.

He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to

sit. He comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, stops, turns to

sit somewhere else.

TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE

SYLVIE turns and glances at GIDEON. Again, the sound of the

DOOR opening interrupts them. They turn to look.

MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

Again the figure of a MAN is outlined in silhouette against

the outside brightness. When he closes the door we can see

"TEX" PENTHOLLOW, a slim, rangy man with sandy-colored hair,

a weatherbeaten face, washed-out blue-eyes -- also in his

forties. He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a

bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs

from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string.

He starts down the aisle toward the bier, CAMERA LEADING

him, and we notice his unsteady gait. He turns to look at

the others present.

TRAVELING SHOT -- TEX'S P.O.V.

MOVING down the aisle. GRANDPIERRE's face, then GIDEON's,

then REGGIE's and SYLVIE's -- all staring at CAMERA.

MED. SHOT -- THE BIER

As TEX arrives. He stands staring at LAMPERT's body, swaying

on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the

coffin to steady himself. Then he takes the flower from his

lapel and throws it into the open box.

CLOSE SHOT -- TEX

WIDER ANGLE

As TEX turns away from the coffin and approaches REGGIE and

SYLVIE, addressing the latter -- after having first reached

for his hat which he discovers he isn't wearing.

SYLVIE points to REGGIE. Unruffled, TEX starts over.

addressing REGGIE this time.

But TEX has nodded his head and moved off to find a seat.

When he spots GIDEON, the two men stare at each other.

Finally, TEX chooses a seat away from him and sits.

MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

It flies open, this time with a bang, and the large MAN who

appears almost fills the frame.

CLOSER SHOT -- TEX

As the loud noise awakens him with a snort, mid-snore.

MED. SHOT -- THE DOOR

Closing the door, we see HERMAN SCOBIE, a heavy-weight --

tall and wide, but not fat -- with black hair combed straight

back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which

meet over his nose and join up. About the same age as the

first two men, SCOBIE is dressed in a battered raincoat, his

hands thrust deep in the pockets. He marches down the aisle.

Looking straight ahead, CAMERA PANNING with him. He stops

before the coffin and stares into it.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE

As he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to

dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth. He stares hard

at the body, squinting his eyes. Then he removes one hand

from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel,

picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down,

into the coffin.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND

The pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly

but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's

hands. There is no reaction.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE

He watches the dead man carefully, still squinting. Then

finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks

back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after

him.

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

Having watched SCOBIE exit. Suddenly a hand falls on her

shoulder. She jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of

fright.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring a funeral ATTENDANT, a cadaverous type (aren't

they all) with a black cut-away coat and an over-solicitous,

unctuous manner. He is eternally bent at the waist, in a

sort of half bow. He offers REGGIE a letter which she takes.

He backs off and is gone. REGGIE looks at the letter, back

and front, then starts to open it.

She pulls out the letter and starts to read it.

INSERT -- THE LETTER

It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead and the typed message

reads:

"Dear Mrs. Lampert: Please drop by my office tomorrow at

noon-thirty. I am anxious to discuss the matter of your late

husband's death. Sincerely, (signed) H. Bartholomew."

TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE

SYLVIE has been reading over REGGIE's shoulder.

EXT. THE AMERICAN EMBASSY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

The fine old building in the Rue Gabriel.

DELETED

INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY

As REGGIE leaves the elevator two young DIPLOMATIC TYPES

step in, immersed in conversation.

The elevator door closes on them. REGGIE reacts to this and

starts down the hall, finally stopping at the door.

MED. SHOT -- DOOR

It is marked "307-A  H. BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE checks the

letter, then opens the door.

INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY

The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk

is covered with its plastic shroud. REGGIE enters, looks for

somebody, notices that the door to the private office is

slightly ajar.

BARTHOLOMEW comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale

grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than

his forty-odd years. Sickly would be the word that describes

him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy

tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause

him to push them back in place every so often with a quick

automatic motion.

He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do

so.

INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- DAY

A small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three

kids on the desk. BARTHOLOMEW indicates a chair, then goes

behind his desk and sits. A can of lighter fluid stands open

on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it.

He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and

hankie.

He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his

tie.

He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the

hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket.

He opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches

wrapped in waxpaper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of

mustard, a bottle of red wine and two Dixie cups.

He uncorks the wine, fills a cup and begins eating.

He hands her a sandwich and fills a wine-cup for her.

He reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which

he gives her.

CLOSE SHOT -- PHOTO

FOUR MEN, all in army uniform, sitting behind a table. The

glass is held over the first, magnifying the face.

CLOSER SHOT -- PHOTO

It's a photo of a young CHARLES LAMPERT.

The glass and CAMERA move to the next man -- a young TEX.

The glass and CAMERA move to the third face -- a young GIDEON.

The glass and CAMERA move to the fourth face -- a young

SCOBIE.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW

BARTHOLOMEW is silent for a moment, thinking.

REGGIE nods. He writes something on a pad of paper and tears

it off, handing it to her.

BARTHOLOMEW shakes his head.

REGGIE takes the last sandwich and begins eating furiously.

DELETED

EXT. ESPLANADE DES CHAMPS-ELYEES -- DAY

MED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL.

One of the French Punch and Judy shows set up on certain

days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between

the Rond Point and the Place de la Concorde. At the moment,

Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat. The sound of

CHILDREN laughing and screaming can be heard.

VARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN

Sitting on small benches lined up to face the stage. Their

attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended

by the play as only children's can be -- laughing at the

slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

Sitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are

laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention

caught up but her face void of emotion. The bench is too low

for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin.

After a moment, PETER comes up behind her and, stepping over

the benches, sits beside her. She doesn't seem to notice.

[Throughout the following scene the CHILDREN and the ACTORS

can be heard in the b.g.]

She turns and looks at him for a moment.

A ROAR from the CHILDREN. REGGIE and PETER turn toward the

stage.

MED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL

PUNCH and JUDY are arguing loudly.

TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

PUNCH and JUDY are batting each other on the head.

Finally, JUDY knocks Punch out of sight and a PUPPET wearing

a three-cornered hat appears.

MED SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

Wearing a hat, he stands off in the background, watching.

CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

JUDY and the POLICEMAN are batting one another.

PUNCH's head appears on the other side of the stage, says

something, then ducks out.

TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

Charles was mixed up in something terrible.

CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

JUDY has gotten the upper hand is now batting the POLICEMAN's

brains out.

CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE as he winces.

TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

She hands it to him and he holds it in front of her face.

INT. NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

MED. SHOT -- EMCEE.

He stands on the dance floor in front of a five piece Latin

dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional

smile as he speaks into a mike.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

At their table. REGGIE is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress.

She rises and pulls him along.

WIDE ANGLE

Including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it,

laughing self-consciously and looking around.

The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons

to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man.

REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line.

Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one

under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man

at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the

game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women

behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under

their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using

their hands.

(This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's

partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against

the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly

enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next

in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest

miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of

human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co-

ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the

orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can

only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide

from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on

the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve

it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity

which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even

new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be

a torment for total strangers and/or the English).

VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME

Some of the couples in various states of confusion,

entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally,

hilarious.

TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL

It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but

quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an

abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the

twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber

the game but increase his worldly experience.

The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to

move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success

difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange

starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after

it.

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

She is enjoying it thoroughly.

TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL

Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson,

PETER makes a last valiant effort and voila, grips the orange

under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations

from members of his TEAM.

Now he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment.

They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all

possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers

seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they

are too good despite themselves and the transfer is

accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM.

REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin,

turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an

embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON,

the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in

BARTHOLOMEW's photo.

REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly.

Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly

in REGGIE's ear.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND GIDEON

Her eyes show her fright as he whispers:

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE'S AND GIDEON'S FEET

As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin.

CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON

He stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting he

merely closes his eyes.

WIDER ANGLE

Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well

as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward.

REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance.

She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly,

under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him

for a moment.

CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON

Slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling

down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange.

WIDER ANGLE

GIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes.

She goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a

flight of stairs.

CLOSE SHOT -- PETER

Watching her go, a concerned look on his face.

INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT

A small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's-

women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door.

The music and shouting from upstairs float down. REGGIE comes

down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light

and closing the door after her.

INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

REGGIE takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops

it in the slot. Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one

given her by BARTHOLOMEW) and dials the number written on

it. She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers.

She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her

coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice.

Suddenly the door of the booth opens and REGGIE wheels to

look, slamming the receiver down as she does.

REVERSE SHOT -- 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

TEX PENTHOLLOW, the second man from the funeral (and photo),

the man in the corduroy suit and string tie, stands in the

doorway, his face calm, a hand-rolled but unlit cigarette in

his mouth. He has put one foot up against the side of the

door so she can't leave. REGGIE stares at him, terrified.

TEX takes a book of matches from his pocket.

He strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the

burning match in his hand afterward.

TEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the

booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically.

TEX lights another match and throws it into her lap. She

beats this one out too.

He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with

it. She shrinks back.

Then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak he

punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match. REGGIE

is too busy beating them out to do anything else.

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

As she frantically beats out the matches, her eyes on her

work.

She looks up, then blinks her eyes.

INT. 'PHONE BOOTH OVER REGGIE'S SHOULDER

There is no one there. REGGIE rises and steps out of the

booth.

INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT

As REGGIE looks around. There is no one there.

INT. PHONE BOOTH

As REGGIE returns, sits and starts to put another jeton into

the slot. She notices her hand is shaking. She reaches back

into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her

mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her

eyes.

Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks -- but this time

it is PETER.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby.

She goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT

CLERK greets them sleepily.

The NIGHT CLERK gets the key off a hook and hands it to

REGGIE.

They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her.

INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

As REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage. It is somewhat

cramped, forcing them to stand close together.

He presses the button and the elevator starts to rise.

The elevator stops.

He reaches across her and opens the door.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

As REGGIE leaves the elevator, followed by PETER. They walk

to her door. There is a moment of silence as she looks at

him.

He turns and leaves. She smiles slightly, then turns and

puts the key into the door and opens it.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Featuring the door. REGGIE enters, then stops abruptly, the

doorknob still in her hand.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The room has been torn apart. And standing in the center is

HERMAN SCOBIE, the large man in the battered raincoat.

He starts slowly advancing toward REGGIE.

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

She stops as she sees something.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND

Instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one.

WIDER ANGLE

SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself,

then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.

The hand is starting to come down. REGGIE, moving quickly,

turns and flies out.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal

hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and

splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified

with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding

claw.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As PETER comes running up to her. He sees the metal hand.

Pulling her aside, PETER takes hold of the key (still in the

outside lock) and turns it slowly and quietly. Then, using

all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go,

making sure to hold it that way as he steps in.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled

SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but

he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away,

sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over,

head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he

disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door

and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free.

He then rushes to the open window and climbs out.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

REGGIE waits anxiously. When she hears nothing, she gingerly

looks into the room.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

ANOTHER ANGLE

Showing the disarranged room, empty of people. Then, slowly

PETER's hand appears from behind the bed, shaking groggily.

REGGIE rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed.

PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks

out. He then turns back.

He climbs out.

EXT. HOTEL WINDOW THIRD FLOOR -- NIGHT

Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony,

consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between

it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears

and looks down over the railing.

EXT. HOTEL SIDEWALK (FROM ABOVE) -- NIGHT

SHOOTING STRAIGHT DOWN; there is no one on the street and it

is too far to jump.

MED. SHOT -- PETER -- BALCONY

He now looks around. REGGIE's is the last such balcony on

one side, but there are two or three on the other.

PETER climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one

hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony.

CLOSE SHOT -- PETER'S HAND

As it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short

of touching it.

MED. SHOT -- PETER

As he straightens up and prepares to jump.

EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT

From the GROUND. PETER, high above, jumps to the next balcony.

MED. SHOT -- PETER

As he climbs over the railing of the second balcony. He sees

a light coming through the window and looks in.

PETER leaves the window quickly, climbing over the railing

on his way to the next balcony. As he does, the following

exchange is heard (in British English).

EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT

From the GROUND as PETER jumps to the next balcony.

MED. SHOT -- PETER

As he climbs over the rail to the third balcony. There is a

Inside the room are GIDEON, TEX, and SCOBIE in the midst of

a heated discussion.

INT. GIDEON'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

They all turn toward the window.

WIDER ANGLE

As PETER climbs in through the window and joins them.

SCOBIE shakes his head and turns away.

SCOBIE turns and storms out of the door, slamming it.

GIDEON begins sneezing, takes a bottle of pills from his

pocket and swallows two white tablets.

PETER starts for the door.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

As she waits anxiously, smoking a cigarette. There is a KNOCK

at the door.

REGGIE unlocks the door and opens it. PETER enters and she

closes the door again --

PETER is silent for a moment.

She falls in his arms to be comforted.

He takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes.

A pause. The phone rings. REGGIE answers it.

He hangs up.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Slowly, REGGIE lowers the 'phone from her ear and hangs it

up.  She hesitates a moment.

He starts out, pausing by the door and examining the hole

SCOBIE made in it.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

As PETER (now called DYLE) leaves REGGIE's room and closes

the door. He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing,

then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one

of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels --

and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock

has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down

near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of

the thread to the bottom of REGGIE's door. He then runs the

thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it

underneath.

INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

As DYLE enters, the thread in his hand. He goes to a nearby

table where he attaches the thread to the heavy room key,

which he then balances on the extreme edge of the table.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

REGGIE is on the phone.

REGGIE hangs up the phone, picks up her bag, checks her hair

notices the connecting door leading to the room next door,

DYLE's room. She goes to it, silently slips out the key and

bends to peer through the keyhole.

INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT (THROUGH KEYHOLE)

DYLE is removing his coat. Before he lays it over a chair,

he takes a gun from the inside pocket, checks it, and tucks

it into his belt.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

REGGIE reacts in surprise and fright, jumps quickly away

from the door. She hurries to the door leading to the hall

and reaches for the knob.

INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT -- ROOM KEY. The thread attached to it is pulled

(by the action of REGGIE's door opening) and the key falls

to the floor with a clatter.

WIDE ANGLE

Including DYLE as he reacts, his head wheeling to look at

the key. Snatching his coat, he runs for the door.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

As REGGIE sneaks past DYLE's door. When she has passed, the

door opens and DYLE appears. REGGIE takes off on the run,

turning the corner and starting down the stairs.

He starts after her.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

It is deserted, except for the sleeping NIGHT PORTER, as

REGGIE comes running down the stairs.

She turns, looking back towards the sound of his voice, but

does not slacken her speed. She runs out the front door.

EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

As REGGIE runs out. She looks up the street, sees a TAXI and

hails it.

It pulls over to the curb. Looking once more over her shoulder

she takes a bill out of her pocket, opens the cab door, slams

it loudly without getting in and hands the bill to the driver.

She jumps back into the shadows of a nearby doorway as the

TAXI pulls away. At the same time DYLE runs out of the hotel.

Another TAXI is coming down the street. DYLE hails it

frantically.

It pulls up and DYLE opens the door.

Desperately, DYLE reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out

a small dictionary and begins flipping through the pages.

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

In the shadows. She lifts her eyes in annoyance.

MED. SHOT -- TAXI

REGGIE comes out of the shadows, looks after DYLE's taxi,

then hails another one which pulls up.

EXT. LES HALLES -- NIGHT

REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW walking. The Central Market is teeming

with activity -- trucks creeping around other trucks, cases

of fruit and vegetables stacked on every inch of sidewalk,

WORKERS of all types milling around, unloading trucks and

stacking crates, little electric carts scooting in and out --

and nearby, one of the huge, high-roofed sheds where the

butchers work.

TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW

CAMERA LEADING them as they walk.

She takes a banana from a nearby stall.

BARTHOLOMEW looks at her for a moment, then glances around;

his attention is drawn inside the doorway.

INT. LES HALLES BUTCHERS' SHED -- NIGHT

Almost as far as the eye can see, row upon row of beef sides,

hung on hooks.

She shudders, throws away her banana and turns back to

BARTHOLOMEW.

INT. LES HALLES BISTRO -- NIGHT

Lined up at a zinc bar are several BUTCHERS, their white

smocks stained with blood. REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW sit at the

table.

A WAITER arrives.

BARTHOLOMEW shrugs.

The WAITER nods and goes.

BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at

it and rips off the filter tip. He winces.

She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches

and lights it.

REGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the

filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth.

He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically

brand-new in the ashtray.

She hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly

examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first

cigarette.

The WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup.

The WAITER puts down the cup and bowl and leaves.

EXT. HOTEL (PLACE ST. ANDRE DES ARTS) -- LATE AFTERNOON

DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment

later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel. As she watches

DYLE, a SANDWICH-MAN advertising a driving school passes the

hotel. REGGIE falls in behind him, his tall placard hiding

her from view.

EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRE DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

First comes DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner,

then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE. The SANDWICH-MAN turns

off, leaving REGGIE out in the open. A moment later, DYLE

passes a GIRL painting a canvas, her easel set up in the

middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and

turns to look at her work. REGGIE, not knowing what to do,

and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her

way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table,

her back to DYLE. It is already occupied by a middle-aged

TOURIST.

TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST

The TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book,

looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE and

she stares back. Finally, not knowing what else to do, she

smiles, then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it.

He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her.

REGGIE turns to look at DYLE.

MED. SHOT -- DYLE

He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on.

TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST

The TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak. As he

opens his mouth to make a sound, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE,

rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused

TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some

money on the table and starts after her.

EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRE DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

REGGIE following DYLE. As she passes the GIRL painting, she

cannot resist turning to see the work.

CLOSE SHOT -- PAINTING

An abstract jumble, nothing recognizable.

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

As she looks from the painting to reality.

EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRE DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

As the scene really looks.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

She shrugs, continues after DYLE. Now we see that the TOURIST,

in turn, is following her.

REGGIE doesn't stop.

She continues after DYLE. The TOURIST hesitates, then

continues after her.

MED. SHOT -- DYLE

He goes to the curb and starts to step off, attempting to

cross the Rue Danton, but finds the light against him. He

turns back in REGGIE's direction.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she

turns and takes the TOURIST's arm and starts walking with

him back toward the cafe.

She looks back over her shoulder and sees that DYLE is now

crossing the Rue Danton, heading for the platform of a bus

now stopped at the curb.

REGGIE pulls away from him.

She leaves him standing there, more confused than ever, as

she starts after DYLE again.

DYLE has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away.

REGGIE hurries across the street, hailing a taxi.

INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- LATE AFTERNOON

DYLE enters. CAMERA PANNING with him to the head of a stairway

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

Watching.

MED. SHOT -- MAIL WINDOW

The CLERK takes out a bundle of letters and quickly sorts

through it.

He turns and heads out, starting up the stairs where REGGIE

was but is no longer. As he reaches the fourth or fifth step,

a VOICE is heard over the loudspeaker.

DYLE stops in his tracks, pondering what to do.

He stops and comes down the stairs, going to the back of the

room and into the cabin marked "4."

CAMERA DOLLIES across an empty cabin to discover REGGIE in

the third one, on the phone.

INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- DAY

DYLE and SCOBIE stand together, waiting for the elevator,

SCOBIE clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat.

The self-service elevator doors open, one or two PASSENGERS

come out and DYLE and SCOBIE enter. A young GIRL starts in

after them.

He reaches out and presses the top button with his metal

hand. The doors close.

DELETED

INT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- LATE AFTERNOON

As SCOBIE follows DYLE out of the elevator. SCOBIE looks

around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall.

He and DYLE go to it, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Through the door,

which SCOBIE closes behind them, is a flight of stairs,

leading up to a second floor.

DYLE turns to find SCOBIE's gun out of the pocket and pointing

at him. SCOBIE now transfers it to his metal hand and goes

to DYLE, where he proceeds to frisk him.

Finding the gun DYLE carries in his inside coat pocket, SCOBIE

removes it. During the following conversation he will shake

open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out

onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to DYLE.

Then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand.

Shrugging, DYLE sits on the third step.

INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- NIGHT

The last EMPLOYEES leave the building as the WATCHMAN locks

the front door after them.

INT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT

In the semi-darkness, DYLE is still sitting on the third

step, SCOBIE still facing him with a gun.

DYLE yawns wide.

DYLE gets to his feet and starts up the stairs, followed by

SCOBIE. DYLE stops at the door.

DYLE opens the door. The stairs continue up.

EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

A spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights

beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of

roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into

a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely

separated oval-shaped dormer windows.

Below these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven

stories.

SCOBIE aims the gun and starts advancing toward DYLE.

DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a

sheer drop to the street.

Moving quickly, DYLE lashes out and hacks SCOBIE's gun hand

with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof.

Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the

jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around

DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears.

Then, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and,

unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of

the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE

suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold

is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his

back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound

extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder.

Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and

leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple

with one another, each trying to break free and reach for

the gun.

CLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDS

Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun.

MED. SHOT -- DYLE AND SCOBIE

The battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are

beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to

stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by

both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold

him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain,

continues to inch forward toward the gun.

Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining

him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his

momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof,

where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the

slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S CLAW

As it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching

sound and causing sparks to fly.

MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE

As he slides over the edge and disappears.

CLOSE SHOT -- DYLE

As he watches, hypnotized.

CLOSE SHOT -- ROOF EDGE

There appears to be no sign of SCOBIE. Then CAMERA ZOOMS IN

FOR A TIGHT CLOSE SHOT OF SCOBIE'S metal hand, gripping the

rain gutter at the very edge.

MED. SHOT -- DYLE

Having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of

the level part of the roof.

MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE

As he hangs, seven stories over the street, by his metal

hand.

MED. SHOT -- DYLE

He finds it hard to believe.

DYLE turns and leaves going down the stairs.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

The HOTEL MANAGER is busy taping a piece of cardboard over

the hole ripped in REGGIE's door by SCOBIE's metal hand the

night before. DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own

door. The MANAGER eyes him coldly. DYLE "takes" the look.

DYLE smiles, then enters his room.

INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

He closes the door and starts to remove his torn coat,

wincing.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

REGGIE, smoking on the bed, sits up when she hears DYLE moving

about in his room. She goes to the connecting door, unlocks

her side, tries the knob, finds it still bolted from his

side and knocks.

DYLE goes to the door, throws back the bolt and opens the

door. REGGIE enters.

She leads him into her room.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

As REGGIE and DYLE enter from his room. She leads him to the

bed.

As REGGIE goes to the bathroom, DYLE takes off his torn shirt,

revealing a torn and bloody T-shirt. He lies face downwards

on the bed. REGGIE returns, carrying cotton, gauze, tape,

scissors, and disinfectant. She sits next to him and lifts

up his T-shirt to examine the wound.

She wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning

the wound. He winces.

She continues working on his back, cleaning it, then bandaging

it while they talk.

As they continue talking, he rises from the bed and goes

into his own room. REGGIE remains on the bed, watching him

through the open door as he puts on a fresh T-shirt and shirt.

He goes to the bed.

He sits.

She starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek.

She kisses him on the mouth. The phone rings. He tries to

talk as she continues kissing him.

The phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him.

Finally, REGGIE reaches out to the bedstand and takes the

phone off the hook. She brings the receiver up to their mouths

and mumbles into it.

one way, then the other. CAMERA PULLS BACK to show him sitting

on SCOBIE's knee, the large man holding him with his good

hand, the metal one in his pocket. TEX sits next to them

while GIDEON nervously paces the floor. When GIDEON begins

sneezing he takes the small bottle of pills from his pocket

and downs one or two, swallowing some water.

TEX lifts JEAN-LOUIS and puts him down on SCOBIE's other

knee.

A KNOCK at the door. GIDEON goes to open it. REGGIE and DYLE

enter. She sees JEAN-LOUIS and TEX's gun.

She snatches him off SCOBIE's lap.

She starts for the door with JEAN-LOUIS. GIDEON blocks her

way.

The THREE MEN look at him, surprised by his tone.

A pause as the THREE MEN look at one another.

The THREE MEN look at one another unhappily.

He takes DYLE's key and gives DYLE his. GIDEON goes to REGGIE,

takes her key and gives her his own.

The THREE MEN file out. DYLE and REGGIE exchange looks.

She smiles, takes JEAN-LOUIS' hand and leaves. DYLE turns to

survey TEX's room.

He goes first to the drawer in the night table -- empty; and

the bed, looking in it and under it. Then he goes to the

desk and opens the drawers -- also empty. The bureau is next --

he opens all three double drawers and they, too, are

completely empty. Frowning, he goes to the armoire and opens

it -- shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare.

Then, CAMERA PANNING DOWN, he sees the only thing he's found

so far in the room -- a pair of fine cowboy boots.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT -- AIRLINES BAG. CAMERA PULLS BACK to include

GIDEON, staring down at it as it lies on the table in the

Inside, the initials "C.L." are printed in gold.

MED. SHOT -- TEX & GIDEON

GIDEON has put the wallet aside and now picks up the letter,

removing it from the envelope and reading it.

A broad grin from TEX. They continue going through the items

from the bag.

TEX takes the list, examines it, then folds it and puts it

in his pocket. They finish with the items from the bag.

The TWO MEN look at one another, then smile -- then laugh.

INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

REGGIE on the phone, JEAN-LOUIS standing by.

She hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS.

REGGIE looks to where JEAN-LOUIS is pointing -- to the top

of the high armoire.

Taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands

on it. Although she is still not high enough to see anything,

by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand

over the top and grope around blindly.

REGGIE has finally managed to pull down the case -- a

rectangular black bag about the size and shape of a trombone

case. As he climbs off the chair, JEAN-LOUIS suddenly runs

to the door, unbolts it and runs into the hall, CAMERA PANNING

with him.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - THIRD LANDING - NIGHT

As JEAN-LOUIS runs out into the hall, shouting.

DYLE is the first one to appear, coming out of GIDEON's room.

TEX has also appeared from REGGIE's room, followed by GIDEON.

The THREE MEN rush by JEAN-LOUIS and squeeze simultaneously

into SCOBIE's room.

INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

As DYLE, TEX and GIDEON enter, REGGIE is placing the little

straight black chair to its original position. There is no

sign of the black case.

TEX grabs the chair and moves it to the armoire, climbing up

on it and grabbing the bag.

He brings it to the table as DYLE and GIDEON crowd around

him, anxious to see.

CLOSE SHOTS (PANNING)

INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

DYLE, TEX and GIDEON stand in the center of the room, looking

around. REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS wait in the open doorway. The

room looks like a cyclone hit the place, but there is no

sign of SCOBIE. The sound of running water can be heard coming

from behind the closed door to the bathroom and DYLE is the

first to notice the water beginning to leak out from under

the door.

INT. BATH -- NIGHT

SCOBIE, still dressed in his raincoat, lies face up, his

They have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the

Pont au Double. DYLE shrugs.

During the following, the VENDOR makes a double-decker cone

and hands it to REGGIE. DYLE pays and they resume their walk --

all with no break in the dialogue.

She offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough

force to dislodge the ice-cream. It lands right next to his

lapel, over his outside breast pocket.

He pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks

inside, then shakes his head sadly at what he sees. REGGIE

still holds the empty cone, not knowing what to do with it.

Seeing this, he takes it and sticks it into his pocket.

They resume walking.

as well. She smiles at him.

DYLE looks at her, then sits down and starts to remove his

shoes.

Shoes off, DYLE starts for the bathroom, humming.

Testing the water with his hand, he now steps in fully

dressed. REGGIE can't believe her eyes. She goes to the open

door for a closer look.

INT. BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

MED. SHOT -- DYLE

In the shower, making sure his suit gets uniformly soaked.

He takes the soap and begins washing as if he were washing

himself without the suit.

As he takes out his handkerchief and rinses it.

He opens his coat and reads a label inside.

He flicks a little water in her face, then takes the nail-

brush and scrubs his watch and watch-band. He holds up his

wrist so she can see the watch.

He begins unbuttoning his suit. She turns and leaves, slamming

the door after her.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

REGGIE slowly lowers the phone to its cradle, a worried

expression on her face. Then the bathroom door opens and

DYLE appears dressed in a large bath towel. Her back is to

him.

She doesn't answer.

She shakes her head.

She turns and looks at him.

EXT. SEINE - BATEAU MOUCHE -- DUSK

The large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze

with lights.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND DYLE (PROCESS)

At a table for two by the rail, the city slowly passing in

the b.g.

She doesn't answer.

WIDER ANGLE

She rises from the table and walks away. DYLE hesitates a

moment, then follows.

ANOTHER ANGLE

They walk back to the table, where a WAITER is busy putting

food on it, mostly on REGGIE's side.

REGGIE reacts in surprise.

She looks at him with happy amazement, then pushes her plate

away.

The lights go out.

EXT. SEINE BATEAU MOUCHE -- NIGHT

A searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now

begins sweeping the river banks. On benches by the water's

edge, lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly

and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of

mutual affection. Some are embarrassed, some are amused and

some (the most intimate) damn annoyed. One even shakes his

fist at the light.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

Who, like everyone else, leave the table and stand together

at the rail watching.

She rises on tip-toes and kisses him gently; his only reaction

is to look at her.

She kisses him again. He responds a little better.

She starts to kiss him again, but he stops her.

INT. GIDEON'S ROOM -- NIGHT

MED. SHOT -- GIDEON. As he sits bolt upright in bed, startled.

The room is dark and the phone is ringing. He switches on

the lamp, looks at the clock (it reads 3:30) and shakes his

head before picking up the receiver.

He hangs up, swings his feet out of bed and spears his

slippers, reaching for his robe at the same time. Then he

shuffles sleepily to the door.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT

As GIDEON comes out of his room and goes to the elevator.

The cage is there. He opens the door and enters.

INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

GIDEON closes the sliding grill and presses a button. The

cage starts down. GIDEON begins sneezing. Suddenly the

elevator stops between floors and the lights go out.

Just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts

moving down again. GIDEON shakes his head and leans back,

whistling again. The cage comes to his floor and starts past

it. Seeing this, GIDEON looks confused.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

The NIGHT PORTER is asleep behind the desk. The elevator,

GIDEON inside, keeps coming down. It passes the lobby level

and keeps right on going, toward the basement.

The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is

a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes

that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely

awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking

horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He

presses the call button and the motor starts.

An instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER

opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES

PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor

of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a

puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no

strings to cut -- only a throat. From ear to ear.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. He is now doubly apoplectic.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal REGGIE and ADAM, in their

CAMERA. Next to him is the airlines bag, its contents dumped

on the floor.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Including ADAM as he enters, his gun trained on TEX. Without

speaking he goes to the airlines bag, then stoops down to go

through the spilled contents, keeping one eye all the time

on TEX. But he can't find what he's looking for.

ADAM takes it and looks at it.

INSERT -- ENVELOPE

The corner containing the stamps is missing, torn off.

hidden by all the legs.

MED. SHOT -- SYLVIE

She recognizes him from these fragments.

She rushes to him, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER. JEAN-LOUIS stands

looking at some stamps. SYLVIE grabs him.

Smiling, JEAN-LOUIS holds up an enormous sack of assorted

stamps -- hundreds of them.

REGGIE runs up and joins them.

JEAN-LOUIS looks in one direction, then in the other, trying

to remember.

They all run off down the line of booths. JEAN-LOUIS stops

and points off.

INT. FELIX'S ROOM -- DUSK

A bare, unkempt little room. FELIX, a man in his sixties,

studying something on the table. There is a KNOCK. He looks

up. Another KNOCK.

enters.

He gestures for REGGIE to come closer. Together with SYLVIE

and JEAN-LOUIS, she goes to the table and looks at the stamps.

He hands her the four stamps and her change.

CLOSE SHOT -- FELIX

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT

surprise, finds it an inch or two ajar.

INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

As REGGIE enters. She freezes, having seen something on the

floor.

MED. SHOT -- TEX

His dead body lies on the floor, the wrists of his extended

arms tied to the leg of the bed, his ankles to the steam

radiator. And tied around his head is a plastic, transparent

bag, inside of which the suffocated man's face, the eyes

bulging against the plastic clinging tight to his features,

can be seen all too clearly. REGGIE enters the shot, bending

down to see if he's alive. Then she sees something beside

his hands near the leg of the bed.

CLOSE SHOT -- CARPET

With his dying effort, TEX has traced a name against the

grain of the maroon carpet -- 'DYLE.'

INT. HOTEL STAIRWAY -- NIGHT

Between the first landing and the lobby. REGGIE running, the

elevator following.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

REGGIE reaches the lobby first and, without hesitation, races

toward the front door and out. The confused hotel MANAGER

behind the desk can only stare in surprise. The elevator,

ADAM inside, has not yet reached the bottom.

EXT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

A taxi stands by the curb. REGGIE leaves the hotel and runs

to it.

Calmly, the DRIVER points to the little printed sign on his

windshield reading "ITALIE."

She looks around and sees ADAM come out of the hotel and

straight toward her. She turns and runs off toward the Place

St. Michel.

EXT. PLACE ST. MICHEL -- NIGHT

station ("St. Michel") and rushes to it, scampering down the

stairs. ADAM is behind her.

INT. ST. MICHEL METRO STATION -- NIGHT

REGGIE comes flying down the stairs and runs past the ticket

booth, fishing in her bag for her carnet (booklet of tickets),

just coming off the stairs, who runs after her.

DELETED

INT. METRO TICKET GATE -- NIGHT

REGGIE gets to the gate ahead of ADAM and manages to crowd

in front of some OTHERS about to pass through. Barely

stopping, she holds out her ticket to the GUARD to be punched,

then heads down the platform, still running. ADAM gets to

the gate but the GUARD stops him as he tries to pass through.

ADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up

and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run.

INT. METRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

CAMERA LEADING REGGIE as she runs -- the passageway is nearly

empty. Her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls.

CLOSE SHOT -- PASSAGEWAY WALL (TRAVELING)

The jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly,

forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons and colors.

INT. METRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

REGGIE stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating

two different directions, an arrow for each.

"DIRECTION: Pte D'ORLEANS Pte DE CLIGNANCOURT-------"

Choosing "Clignancourt," she runs off. CAMERA PANS SHARPLY,

180 degrees, to pick up ADAM rounding the corner in hot

pursuit.

INT. METRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

REGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every

few steps.  Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across

the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM.  He has evidently

made the wrong turn back in the passageway.

They stare at each other for a moment.  Then the bell rings,

announcing the arrival of a train. ADAM turns, running back

through the exit behind him. Not knowing what to do, REGGIE

looks into the darkness of the tunnel. The approaching train

can be heard.

She turns to look at the gate -- slowly, the pneumatic door

starts to close. As it does, the train roars into the station.

INT. METRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

The gate can be seen slowly closing. ADAM runs to it, tries

to force it back but cannot. Finally, he jumps up and,

commando style, vaults over it.

INT. METRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

REGGIE is just entering the red center car (the two on either

side are dark green). ADAM runs for the red car and just

manages to make it as the doors shut in unison, the latches

falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing

to inform the motor-man to depart. The train starts to move.

INT. METRO CAR -- NIGHT

The entire length of the car separates ADAM and REGGIE.

For a moment, their eyes meet, then ADAM starts to weave his

way past the other PASSENGERS, on his way to her.

Suddenly, he is stopped. ADAM turns to see a TRAIN GUARD.

ADAM shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him, but

again the TRAIN GUARD stops him.

He tries to pull away from the TRAIN GUARD and finds himself

staring into the serious face of a GENDARME.

ADAM looks at the GENDARME, then at REGGIE.

INT. "PALAIS-ROYAL" METRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

class car behind the red, first-class one. Reluctantly, ADAM

does.

As ADAM enters and goes to the door through which he can see

REGGIE in the car ahead. She is gone. Moving quickly, he

returns to the exit door and looks at the platform.

INT. METRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

From ADAM'S P.O.V. She is hurrying toward an exit marked

"SORTIE."

ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring ADAM as he hurries from the car. He finds his way

blocked by FIVE NUNS in large, white butterfly hats.

It takes him a few precious seconds to work his way around

them.

DELETED

INT. METRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

REGGIE has entered an area leading to the exit. But as she

reaches the stairway leading up to the street level, she is

confronted with an iron grill barring her way. She tries to

open it, but it is firmly padlocked. A sign hung on it reads

"FERME LES WEEKENDS." She turns, desperately looking for

some way out.

INT. METRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

ADAM is off the train. He stands on the platform as the train

doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows and

the train pulls out. He looks around in all directions,

looking for some sign of REGGIE. He spots the exit marked

"SORTIE" (the same one used by REGGIE) and starts toward it.

INT. METRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

As ADAM enters the deserted area. There is, miraculously, no

sign of REGGIE. He goes to the locked grill and tries it,

testing the padlock. CAMERA PANS to a phone booth (solid

door with a window in the upper half) and we see REGGIE's

hand reaching up to dial a number.

INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

REGGIE sits on the floor of the booth, dialing.

She holds the receiver to her ear. The number can be heard

ringing but no one answers. She hangs up and reaches for the

phone book, leafing through its pages.

Carefully, REGGIE opens the door and comes out. She goes to

the corner and looks around it.

INT. METRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

From REGGIE'S P.O.V. as ADAM walks away from CAMERA, down

the platform. CAMERA PANS TO REGGIE, peeking around the

corner. She looks the opposite way, sees another exit at the

other end of the platform (also marked "SORTIE"). She looks

back once more at ADAM, then makes up her mind and starts

running towards the exit.

MED. SHOT -- ADAM

As the bell rings announcing the next train. He turns to

look and sees REGGIE.

He takes off, running after her.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

As she runs, ADAM several yards behind her.

She turns into the exit.

INT. METRO STAIRWAY -- NIGHT

As REGGIE starts up the long, steep flight of stone steps

leading to the street level. ADAM appears behind her, climbing

two at a time and gaining.

He is rapidly closing the gap between them. It is clear that

REGGIE is tiring.

PASSERSBY, descending the stairs, stand aside to let the two

strange Americans pass, watching in wonderment. ADAM is only

a few steps behind now.

As REGGIE wearily gains the top, ADAM lunges for her. He

manages to grab her foot as he falls forward, but all he

winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand.

REGGIE shrieks, then regaining her balance, continues running,

limping in her one shoe. ADAM scrambles to his feet and starts

after her again.

INT. METRO TICKET BOOTH AREA -- NIGHT

As REGGIE, still hobbling, runs through and toward the stairs,

leading to the street. CAMERA PANS TO ADAM, as he, too, runs

through. He is again several yards behind her.

EXT. PLACE PALAIS ROYAL -- NIGHT

As REGGIE comes up the stairs from the Metro. She stops long

enough to kick off her other shoe, then runs across the

street, ignoring the traffic, toward the Rue de Valois (which

forms one side of the Palais Royal). ADAM is gaining on her

again.

EXT. PALAIS ROYAL COURTYARD -- COLONNADE -- NIGHT

The smaller court at the Comedie-Francaise end of the Palais

gardens, separated from the larger garden by a double

peristyle consisting of two twin rows (these separated from

each other by a small marble court) of twenty columns each --

in all, eighty columns. The only person in sight is the man

we have known as BARTHOLOMEW, waiting at the far end of the

columns, looking at his watch impatiently.

Then, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais, REGGIE runs

into the court. She spots "BARTHOLOMEW" and fishes in her

bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving

them.

ADAM has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the

near end of the colonnade as he spots "BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE,

still running, is halfway between the two men. "BARTHOLOMEW"

draws his gun but can't get a shot at ADAM, who has ducked

in among the columns.

This news hits REGGIE hard and she stops, in alarm.

She looks at "BARTHOLOMEW," then back at ADAM, who has drawn

his own gun.

(NOTE: Both "BARTHOLOMEW" and ADAM are in among the stone

columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of

each other's sight. REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps

in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to).

REGGIE looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do.

REGGIE takes a step toward ADAM.

REGGIE stops, turns back to "BARTHOLOMEW."

She looks toward ADAM for a moment, then back to

"BARTHOLOMEW", then slowly starts toward ADAM.

REGGIE stops in alarm.

MED. SHOT -- ADAM

During the following, he looks around, looking for some way

out.

During this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns,

creeping cautiously across the open space between the two

colonnades and finally, behind the second.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND CARSON

She has seen ADAM's move from her angle, but doesn't know

quite what to do.

MED. SHOT -- ADAM

As he slowly moves along behind the second colonnade, his

gun ready, trying to get an angle on CARSON.

Suddenly ADAM stops -- he has caught sight of CARSON through

the columns. But he will have a difficult shot.

CAMERA PANS DOWN to his gun. As his finger tightens on the

trigger and the hammer moves slowly back.

CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

the column as the bullet hits it and screams off.

Quickly, he peers back out and throws another shot.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

Seeing CARSON otherwise occupied, she turns and runs toward

the open stage door of the Comedie Francaise behind her.

(Beside the door is a poster announcing the forthcoming

schedule of presentations.)

ANOTHER ANGLE

Including CARSON who, seeing REGGIE running to the door,

turns and fires at her. But he is too late -- she is safely

inside. CARSON looks quickly back toward ADAM, then takes

off after REGGIE.

MED. SHOT -- ADAM

Over his shoulder we see a broken picture of CARSON running

toward the theatre door, flashing by the near and far columns.

ADAM tries to get a shot at him, but can't.

Finally he runs after him.

INT. COMEDIE FRANCAISE -- BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT

As CARSON enters and slams the door behind him, locking it.

INT. COMEDIE FRANCAISE -- STAGE DOOR -- NIGHT

ADAM arriving at the door, bangs on it, then looks around,

frustrated. Several yards away he sees a short stairway

leading down to a door below the street level. He runs to

it, tries the door and enters.

INT. COMEDIE FRANCAISE -- ORCHESTRA -- NIGHT

As CARSON enters the auditorium and looks around.

CARSON'S P.O.V.

seats.

INT. COMEDIE FRANCAISE -- TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

A large room, lit by a single bare bulb, under the stage.

next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic

pieces which fill the room.

INT. COMEDIE FRANCAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

As CARSON moves carefully across the darkened stage near the

footlights, looking for REGGIE. At mid-stage, CAMERA PANS

DOWN to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box.

Inside, huddling down, is a terrified REGGIE, holding her

breath as she watches him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As CARSON moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board

and throws on all the switches. The stage is bathed in light.

He returns to the stage.

INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

ADAM is looking up, having heard the footsteps on the stage

over his head -- and hearing them now. He looks around and

sees a narrow, curving staircase leading up. He goes to it,

and, starting up, finds a door. He tries the knob -- the

door is locked.

INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT

REGGIE, cringing back from the bright light, notices the

doorknob turning. It makes a slight clicking sound.

INT. COMEDIE FRANCAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

CARSON, upstage, looking behind a piece of classic scenery,

hears the doorknob and turns suddenly.

We catch a quick glimpse of REGGIE as she ducks down out of

sight.  Too late.

ADAM stops himself from pulling the lever just in time. He

lets his held breath escape. He looks back at the ceiling.

The one marked C-4. As CARSON's voice is heard, CAMERA MOVES

to the next trap, marked D-4.

MED. SHOT -- ADAM

He looks at the lever marked D-4. He is perspiring heavily.

Now he slowly reaches for the lever.

INT. COMEDIE FRANCAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through

out of sight. At the same time we hear a shot.

CLOSE SHOT -- PROMPTER'S BOX

As REGGIE slowly peers out.

REGGIE'S P.O.V.

The empty stage, without being able to see the open trap

from this low angle.

MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

As she climbs out of the booth and, seeing the open trap

now, runs to it, looking down through it.

MED. SHOT -- OPEN TRAP

FROM ABOVE, over REGGIE's head. She can see CARSON sprawled

on the floor below, face down and dead. ADAM stands beside

the body, looking up at REGGIE and smiling.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As GRANDPIERRE and his TWO ASSISTANTS, guns drawn, walk onto

the stage from the wings. They go to the open trap and look

down at ADAM.

ADAM is surprised, then shakes his head.

EXT. RUE DE RIVOLI -- NIGHT

As a TAXI rolls by the arcades, CAMERA PANNING with it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring the desk. Behind it sits ADAM (now CRUIKSHANK).

REGGIE stares at him, unbelievingly, then looks around,

confused. By way of explanation he indicates the door to the

hall.

BONUS ITEM -- Lyrics to the theme song of the film:

When we played our Charade we were like children posing,

Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we

played.

Oh, what a hit we made. We came on next to closing Best on

the bill, lovers until love left the masquerade.

Fate seemed to pull the strings, I turned and you were gone.

While from the darkened wings the music box played on.

Sad little serenade, song of my heart's composing, I hear it

still, I always will, best on the bill Charade.
