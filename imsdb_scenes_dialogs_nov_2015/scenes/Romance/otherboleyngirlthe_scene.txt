ANNE shrugs, smiles..

INT. BEDROOOM - NIGHT

MARY and ANNE enter the bedroom. A sea of candles. MARY stares

at the bed. A child. Suddenly terrified.

The two SISTERS hug tightly. Visibly emotional.

WILLIAM rolls over. MARY stares. Soon WILLIAM snores

contentedly. MARY is wide awake. Confused.

EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust.

The Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER

in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake.

The SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS,

who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS..

It's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not,

This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end.

Behind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome,

in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest

COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough,

intimidating lot.

Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large

ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books..

Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the

PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS.

Behind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's

weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance,

etc.

Then come the animals: FALCONS, in cages, and the HUNTING

HOUNDS, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an

assortment of FRESH HORSES for travelling, and hunting.

And finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of ARMED GUARDS,

and a second STANDARD BEARER..

EXT. HEVER - DAY

The BOLEYN family page, (WILLIAM STAFFORD), is perched on a

hill. Keeping watch. Staring into the distance..

Presently, he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder

approaching. His expression changes...

EXT. HEVER - ESTATE - DAY

Pandemonium breaks out among STAFF and FAMILY MEMBERS as

STAFFORD calls out, "The King!"

INT. HEVER - DAY

ANNE is being dressed by MAIDS. Hearing the commotion outside,

she rushes over to the window to see the approaching RIDERS.

ANNE looks out of the window. Scans the approaching RIDERS until

she finds the KING..

The young HENRY TUDOR is a dazzling, magnetic, intensely

glamorous and handsome figure. A total contrast from the

bloated, bearded figure of his later years.

ANNE turns to face MARY. The two SISTERS embrace tightly.

EXT. HEVER - DAY

The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is nervously assembled outside the

house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. Huge

marquees in the gardens. Fountains. Additional staff. Smart

uniforms. New extensions to the stables and kitchens).

MARY is discreetly hidden, among the CROWDS. ANNE is pride of

place. Visibly nervous. SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH are beside

her. The proud PARENTS.

Everyone bows deeply in deference as the King arrives.

The King dismounts athletically. His DOGS are unleashed, bark

excitedly..

A SERVANT in stiff, new uniform, with trembling hands, brings

wine on a tray. HENRY takes a glass..

GEORGE, visibly nervous, bows deeply from the neck. But HENRY's

attention has been caught by a beautiful woman behind GEORGE..

MARY dutifully, modestly averts her eyes..

ANNE curtseys deeply...

ANNE offers HENRY her hand. He takes it, then leads ANNE away.

MARY shoots ANNE a look, `Good luck'.

EXT/INT. HEVER - DAY

ANNE leads the KING through the house. She is followed at a

distance by SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. And watched by MARY and GEORGE

from a gallery above..

HENRY looks up, his eye having been caught by something..

HENRY points at an emblem above a doorway..

HENRY is delighted by ANNE's candour..

HENRY smiles, visibly charmed..

WATCHING FROM ABOVE, MARY smiles to herself, "Well done, Anne",

as HENRY and ANNE continue down a corridor..

INT. BOLEYN HOUSE - EVENING

The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled, frantically changing ANNE

from her day attire to her finest evening clothes. SIR THOMAS

watches..

K

M

SIR THOMAS adjusts her hair..

MARY watches. A momentary stab of jealousy at FATHER's

attention. But as ANNE looks over at MARY for support..

MARY smiles. Shakes herself out of it. It's her sister. What was

she thinking?

INT. BOLEYN HOME - NIGHT

MUSIC is being played. Everyone is dressed in their finest, a

packed banquet hall. MUSICIANS come to a climax, loud and

enthusiastic applause from everyone. HENRY gets to his feet..

ELIZABETH, the DUKE of NORFOLK, etc..

A beaming SIR THOMAS raises his glass.

LATER: dinner is served. Everyone is eating. HENRY and several

close COURTIERS are engaged in debate..

Her heart pounding in her chest.

INT. STAIRCASE - BOLEYN HOUSE - NIGHT

SIR THOMAS stops ANNE on her way upstairs.

SIR THOMAS kisses ANNE's forehead..

SIR THOMAS watches ANNE go. Admiring her. Then he turns to see

his wife, ELIZABETH. She turns away in disgust.

INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

MARY and ANNE lie together. In spoons position. ANNE is fast

asleep. MARY strokes her sister's hair. Eyes open.

EXT. HEVER CASTLE - STABLE YARD - DAY

The following morning..

Thirty or more RIDERS, STABLE-BOYS and HORSES are gathered. To

one side, a deafening pack of DEER-HOUNDS, (wire-haired

Lurchers), barking frantically.

The MASTER OF THE HORSE helps HENRY mount his steed - the

biggest and most glamorous stallion of all, with wonderful,

ornate saddlery.

they ride pillion, (ie), riding on the same horse as their MEN,

sitting behind them, holding onto them..

F

ANNE curtseys deeply..

H

It's clearly an invitation. He indicates there is room for ANNE

on the back of his saddle. But ANNE fails to read the signal.

A STABLE-BOY leads out her horse.

ANNE skilfully mounts the horse, and sits upright..

A flicker behind HENRY's eyes. It's the first wrong move ANNE

has made.

ANNE shoots a look at MARY. Then follows.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The thunder of hooves..

WILLIAM STAFFORD leads the way out with a pack of some forty or

fifty hounds. It's a stirring sight. Following the hounds, come

thirty or forty RIDERS, led by the KING himself.

T

I

Up ahead, the HOUNDS start to bark. Their pace increases.

They've got a scent. The BUGLER blows his horn..

The DOGS begin to increase their pace. The RIDERS urge their

horses to gallop. The LADIES hold tight to their MEN..

EXT. FIELDS - DAY

Up ahead, a STAG, wide-eyed, innocent, lifts it's head..

The sound of the hunting bugle and the roar of approaching

footsteps, like thunder.

The STAG twitches in fear, then bolts off towards the forest.

EXT. FIELDS - DAY

The DOGS and RIDERS roar across fields. The hounds snarl, almost

delirious with primal agitation..

Among the RIDERS, the more advanced HORSEMEN have already opened

up a clear lead on their weaker counterparts..

and, of course, ANNE..

They jump over a hedge. One of HENRY's COURTIERS catches the

hedge and falls. HENRY smiles, then turns to see..

ANNE comfortably jumping the hedge herself. HENRY's smile fades.

He urges his horse to greater speed..

EXT. FIELDS - DAY

The terrified DEER bolts into safety of the forest. The barking

HOUNDS, locked into the scent, follow.

Galloping through trees and thick forest is not for the

fainthearted. But HENRY charges past, kicking up dirt..

INT. FOREST - DAY

HENRY weaves skilfully through low-hanging branches. He looks

over his shoulder, ANNE follows, close behind..

Sharp branches tear at HENRY's face. Some draw blood. Behind

him, several other COURTIERS suffer lashes from the branches,

and pull up. But not ANNE. She kicks her horse harder. Seemingly

impervious to the whipping branches..

Ahead, the DEER darts and weaves. The HOUNDS give chase.

EXT. FOREST - RAVINE - DAY

A steep ravine, with a sheer drop of twenty-five feet deep. At

the bottom, a brook with dangerous rocks, then another sheer

climb of twenty-five feet the other side.

The DEER arrives, looks, then scampers down the ravine, pursued

by the HOUNDS.

struggling with the brook.

HENRY raises his hat, and salutes the DEER.

The COURTIERS laugh, then they turn their horses around and head

off. ANNE stares. It's a clear opportunity to impress. She looks

down at the rocks. A long stare, then..

The COURTIERS gasp in disbelief as ANNE lurches forward, and

leaps into space, heading fearlessly down the sheer ravine.

But, reaching the bottom, the horse leaps across the brook, then

scrambles up the other side.

She made it! Exhilarated, ANNE turns, breathing hard. The KING

stares at her. The COURTIERS stare at her.

the mud, it's hooves grasping horrifically at air..

The KING's horse falls backwards, unseating HENRY, sending him

flying, and worst of all, landing on top of him as they fall and

tumble dreadfully down into the brook, and onto the rocks..

Pandemonium breaks out. The sound of shouting voices, cries of

horror, raising the alarm.

ANNE's FACE: what has she done?

INT. HEVER - NIGHT

HENRY slowly comes to, to find himself staring at a number of

faces. A PHYSICIAN, SIR THOMAS BOLEYN, the DUKE of NORFOLK, one

or two COURTIERS, and finally, ANNE..

HENRY flinches in agony, tries to move..

ANNE opens her mouth, wants to protest, but is hastily ushered

out of the room.

HENRY looks at MARY, then..

MARY lowers her eyes..

HENRY stares at MARY.

EXT. HEVER CASTLE - DAY

Strapped and bandaged, HENRY is helped onto his horse. Beside

him GEORGE BOLEYN is also on a horse, riding off to court for

the first time..

SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH bow, curtsey farewell..

HENRY embraces him, whispers in SIR THOMAS's ear..

HENRY shoots a lingering look at MARY, which ANNE notices. Then

the King and his entourage ride off.

MARY waves farewell to GEORGE. ANNE stares. Suspicious.

INT. HEVER CASTLE - DAY

MARY and ANNE are sitting together. Presently the door opens,

and WILLIAM STAFFORD emerges..

MARY and ANNE get to their feet. STAFFORD raises his hand..

MARY shoots ANNE a quizzical look, then goes with STAFFORD.

ANNE's smile fades. A flicker of suspicion. She follows..

INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - DAY

An intimidating atmosphere. Dogs lie at the feet of the DUKE of

NORFOLK. SIR THOMAS looks up..

MARY's eyes widen in disbelief..'What?'

INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

ANNE listens at the door. Horrified.

INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - SAME TIME

WILLIAM STAFFORD watches from the doorway as the DUKE of

NORFOLK, WILLIAM CAREY and SIR THOMAS smile delightedly, staring

at MARY..

MARY shoots a desperate look at her husband..

M

SIR THOMAS's expression darkens. A flicker of pain.

INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

ANNE'S FACE, outside the door: it's as if a knife had been

plunged into her gut.

She turns and runs down the corridor..

INT. WILLIAM CAREY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

WILLIAM and MARY lie in bed. MARY is equally wretched. Tears are

also running down her cheeks. She stares at her husband..

MARY stares at him..

A

M

EXT. BOLEYN HOME - STABLES - DAY

MARY is getting ready to leave. She turns a corner and `bang',

walks straight into ANNE. A tense moment. The two SISTERS stare

at one another..

MARY stares, saddened, `Oh, Anne', but there's no time to talk.

She has to go. ANNE is left. Her eyes blazing.

EXT. PALACE - DAY

MARY and WILLIAM ride through London streets escorted by

SERVANTS bringing their belongings. They approach Whitehall

Palace. Armed GUARDS slowly open the gates.

MARY's face: as the heavy gates open. She shoots a last look at

the `free' world outside. Then, she rides through the Palace

gates.

`CLANK', the heavy doors shut behind her.

The outside world has been totally sealed off. Faces appear at

palace windows, staring down at the `new arrivals'.

MARY. Then he lets the curtain fall.

INT. COURT - DAY

KATHERINE of ARAGON, (late-30's), imperious, intimidating,

Spanish. Surrounded by other LADIES IN WAITING, (mostly high-

born, Spanish, and the QUEEN's age). A SERVANT announces..

QUEEN KATHERINE looks up..`Who?'

MARY flinches. Blushing deeply, her skin glowing with

perspiration and terror, she begins to sing..

Normally she sings well. But her voice now is strangled with

fear. MARY stands rigid, her knuckles whiten, nails digging into

her hands, drawing blood.

Finally, MARY finishes. The room is silent. All eyes on

KATHERINE, who stares coldly. A formidable adversary.

INT. CORRIDORS - WHITEHALL PALACE - AFTERNOON

MARY walks through the packed corridors of court, her face

burning from the humiliation. The sound of a voice behind her..

But MARY does not hear. She continues walking, distressed, and

distractedly enters..

Finally, she is caught by JANE PARKER, whom we had seen at the

window earlier. Younger, also English, a kindred spirit..

JANE smiles. MARY manages a smile..

The two girls shake hands.

J

smile fades.

EXT. TILTYARD - DAY

A large dusty yard, where KNIGHTS train for combat, and practise

their fighting skills. MARY is with GEORGE, who is putting on

his armour..

MARY hands over a handkerchief..

GEORGE hastily gives it back..

GEORGE gets to his feet, indicates to his MALE COURTIER friend

that he is coming..

H

H

M

GEORGE finds his helmet, puts it on..

MARY watches GEORGE go to join the other MALE COURTIERS.

INT. MARY'S ROOM - COURT - DAY

MARY enters her room, and closes the door. She begins

undressing, taking off her clothes, then catches sight of a DOG

in the shadows. She gasps. It's the KING's dog.

MARY covers herself in modesty, and falls to her knees in a deep

curtsey of deference. HENRY steps into the light, walks towards

her..                H

M

HENRY tails off as MARY unbuttoning her dress..

MARY's dress comes off her shoulder. The KING's eyes, however,

instead of staring at MARY's beautiful, exposed body, stay

focused on her eyes. An uncomfortable moment..

HENRY bows in respect, then turns, and takes his leave, leaving

MARY standing in the room..

INT. NORFOLK'S STUDY - COURT - NIGHT

The DUKE of NORFOLK stares in disbelief at MARY. His dogs lie

intimidatingly at his feet.

MARY speaks quietly. Lowers her head..

An incense-filled Royal Chapel. The ARCHBISHOP is giving mass,

in Latin, for the Royal Household.

HENRY is lost in prayer. It's not long, however, before he turns

to look at MARY.

Meanwhile, a remote country parish church. Far away.

him.

INT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY

In the Royal chapel: the ARCHBISHOP solemnly performs the

Eucharist, breaking bread and making wine from blood..

But, in full view of all those in the chapel, the KING continues

to stare at MARY.

gaze. But then, for the first time, she reciprocates. And looks

back.

This is witnessed by the QUEEN, and further back, by the DUKE of

NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN.

Everyone is pretending to focus on the MASS. But none of them

can concentrate..

INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY

In the country church: The PRIEST's eyes become accustomed to

the dark. Everywhere, long shadows, eerie darkness..

Presently, a WOMAN steps into the light. It's ANNE. Dressed in a

shawl.

ANNE hands over a purse of coins. They walk to the altar..

Up ahead, the GROOM slowly steps out of the shadows. Now we see

his face. It's HENRY PERCY.

EXT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY

Back at court: the service ends.

Everyone in the Royal Household filters out of the church. But

it's a very different atmosphere to when they entered..

The extent of HENRY's affection for MARY is now public knowledge

evidenced by..

..the attention SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK now receive from CARDINAL

WOLSEY and THOMAS CROMWELL, and the way in which QUEEN KATHERINE

and her SPANISH LADIES are being neglected.

MARY allows herself a private smile of satisfaction. Surprised

at how good it feels. To be the number 1.

INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

MARY lies in bed, in a room covered in flowers. She admires a

beautiful necklace in a box, and a handwritten letter from the

KING. We can see from MARY's face how much she likes it.

Presently, urgent `knock', `knock', at the door. MARY's eyes

widen in excitement. The King?

She hurriedly closes the necklace's box. Tucks the letter away

in a drawer.

She gets out of bed. Anxiously straightens her hair, then goes

to the door, to find..

GEORGE, her brother, who bursts in..

INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - BOLEYN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

A FAMILY MEETING: ANNE and HENRY PERCY, (the HANDSOME YOUNG

NOBLEMAN from Mary's wedding), stand in front of the DUKE of

NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and GEORGE..

HENRY PERCY looks down, avoiding eye contact..

`Snap', NORFOLK's quill breaks. SIR THOMAS almost chokes.

GEORGE's eyes widen..

ANNE recoils, terrified..

SIR THOMAS gives the signal for WILLIAM STAFFORD to escort PERCY

out.

SIR THOMAS dismisses her..

ANNE goes. GEORGE follows..

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE - DAY

MARY paces anxiously in the corridor. Presently, ANNE emerges

from the room. Burning with humiliation. Their eyes meet. MARY

is about to speak, but ANNE cuts her off..

M

ANNE storms out. GEORGE shoots MARY a look, "I'll deal with

this", and runs after ANNE..

OVER THIS: we fade in MUSIC and the sound of laughter..

INT. BALL-ROOM - PALACE - NIGHT

A grand MASQUE BALL. We're in a spectacular candle-lit ballroom.

MUSICIANS play. Large formations of DANCERS perform elaborately

choreographed moves. Among them we pick out..

SIR THOMAS BOLEYN stalking the party. Ever watchful. On duty.

Vigilant. He is distracted by the sight of...

His son, GEORGE BOLEYN, surrounded by FRANCIS WESTON and his

FRIENDS. GEORGE is clearly in his element. Laughing in delight.

Very fond and intimate with FRANCIS WESTON..

SIR THOMAS looks concerned for the first time.

watches proceedings with a blank, distant expression. Presently,

a voice behind her..

MARY turns to see a MASKED MAN behind her.

The MASKED MAN is tall. His voice is quiet, but strong.

MARY's smile fades..

H

SIR THOMAS urgently nods, `Go on!' MARY theatrically swoons.

Falling into the KING's arms. A gasp among the COURTIERS..

SIR THOMAS quickly picks MARY up. He carries her through the

crowds, out of the ball-room..

QUEEN KATHERINE watches from a distance. A flicker of pain.

Then, with great dignity and pride, she turns back to watch the

entertainment..

INT. KING'S APARTMENT - COURT - NIGHT

`Thump', the doors open, and MARY is carried into the King's

apartments. HENRY fusses, brings water. Opens windows.

SIR THOMAS bows to the KING, shoots MARY meaningful look, `Don't

fail me', and retreats. HENRY closes the doors. He and MARY are

left alone.

HENRY makes her comfortable.

HENRY goes to get water himself..

S

HENRY looks at MARY..

HENRY reaches out. Their hands meet..

HENRY leans forward and they kiss. Gently at first. MARY

resisting. Then harder..

canopied bed, and lays her down..

They begin to make love. As radical a contrast to the scene with

WILLIAM CAREY as it is possible to imagine..

MARY's eyes open. She gasps. Her hands grip the sheets..

INT. PALACE - DAYBREAK

HENRY and MARY, entwined in one another's arms, as the sun

rises...

INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE HENRY'S APARTMENTS - DAY

Several hours later:

WILLIAM STAFFORD is fast asleep in a window seat in the corridor

outside. Finally, the door opens. And MARY emerges from the

KING's apartment.

S

MARY stares at STAFFORD. As he straightens his shirt..

STAFFORD turns, leads the way. MARY follows.

INT. NORFOLK'S STUDY - COURT - DAY

The DUKE of NORFOLK's dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by

the fire. Slurping hungrily.

The entire family is gathered. SIR THOMAS, LADY ELIZABETH. Also

present is WILLIAM CAREY.

MARY stares at her husband..

MARY's eyes burn..

MARY stares daggers..

WILLIAM CAREY's face: a flicker of pain..

B

NORFOLK turns to SIR THOMAS, ignoring MARY as though she were a

piece of livestock..

a palace window as, in a stableyard down below..

GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON return from riding together. The sound

of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the

stable-boys..

SIR THOMAS watches as GEORGE and FRANCIS walk back to the palace

together. There's something in their manner, the intimacy

between them..

SIR THOMAS's smile fades.

INT. PALACE - DAY

`Slap', HENRY spreads out a huge architect's drawing of a

magnificent ship on a table. He sits with SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and

the DUKE of NORFOLK.

SIR THOMAS looks up in disbelief..

G

INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - LONDON - DAY

GEORGE BOLEYN, visibly shocked and distressed, stands in front

of his father.

SIR THOMAS's expression changes..

SIR THOMAS walks out. GEORGE stares after him..

INT. BALL-ROOM - PARKER FAMILY CASTLE - NIGHT

MUSICIANS play. We're at GEORGE's wedding. Attended by the KING

and QUEEN, all the senior LORDS. It's a markedly grander and

posher affair than MARY's earlier wedding, a clear indication of

the BOLEYNS' new, elevated status.

M

IN ANOTHER CORNER:

MARY and the KING also clap. HENRY whispers sexily in MARY's

ear. She laughs. Then HENRY is called to one side...

MARY is momentarily left alone. She looks up to see WILLIAM

CAREY standing in front of her, swaying slightly.

MARY stares - suddenly hard - punishing him.

MARY pulls away. But CAREY pulls her roughly to one side. HENRY

sees this from across the room..

MARY pulls her arm away, and goes. She walks across the room,

visibly shaken, and joins the KING.

INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

HENRY and MARY make love. Two people giving everything of

themselves..

Hours later: they lie together, enveloped in one another's arms.

MARY is awake. The King asleep in her arms. She lovingly strokes

his hair. Watches him breathe.

Her face is glowing. Content. And the look in her eyes tells us

more eloquently and unequivocally than any sonnet..

M

...that she has fallen in love.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - COURT - DAY

The sound of groaning. Wretching. Shooting through a half-open

door, we see MARY hunched over her basin, vomiting.

P

instinctively covering her belly.

MARY's eyes widen with the implications.

INT. KING'S APARTMENT - DAY

SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and the DUKE of NORFOLK stare at MARY. Also

present are several PHYSICIANS and GEORGE BOLEYN..

SIR THOMAS looks at the PHYSICIAN, who nods..

INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Shooting through a half-open door..

SIR THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK are having a private audience

with the KING. SIR THOMAS whispers something in HENRY's ear..

(WE DO NOT HEAR THE WORDS - WE DO NOT NEED TO).

HENRY's face breaks out in a smile. He delightedly shakes SIR

THOMAS's hand. OVER THIS: the sound of a voice..

INT. COURT - ACCOMMODATION - DAY

A blindfolded MARY is led through doors by SIR THOMAS..into a

suite of grand, unfurnished rooms, the most prestigious

accommodation at court..

G

MARY removes her blindfold. She gasps in disbelief, turns 360

degrees, staring at the size, and grandeur of the location..

But LADY ELIZABETH remains granite-faced..

LADY ELIZABETH turns and walks out. MARY looks anxiously at SIR

THOMAS, who gestures dismissively..

INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY

MARY wakes up. She gets out of bed. She goes to the window and

draws the curtains.

Then MARY looks down, and gasps. The floor has fresh drops of

blood on it.

MARY goes to her bed, and rips back the sheets. Her eyes widen

in horror. There is blood all over the sheets.

T

MARY covers her mouth. Lets out a loud cry. The sound of

approaching footsteps as SERVANTS come running..

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

MARY lies on the bed being examined by several PHYSICIANS. SIR

THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK look on in concern. Finally, the

PHYSICIAN turns, washing his hands..

S

SIR THOMAS's face. Overcome with relief..

The PHYSICIAN clears his throat. This will not be easy..

MARY looks up. Her heart sinks.

INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - COURT - DAY

MARY lies in her bed, watching with a forlorn expression as

MIDWIVES and MAIDS prepare the apartment for lying-in.

CURTAINS are drawn for darkness. A large CRUCIFIX is placed in a

corner.

As each TAPESTRY is hung, the room becomes darker...

..and darker.

..and darker.

MARY cranes her neck to remain in sunlight for as long as

possible, but before long..

..her face slips into darkness, and the room into total silence.

And effective imprisonment.

He misses MARY.

But HENRY shows no interest.

The DUKE of NORFOLK notices this. A flicker of concern.

EXT. GARDENS - DAY

An archery competition is in progress. But HENRY pays no

missing MARY.

Sensing an opportunity, SIR JOHN SEYMOUR advances, and presents

his pretty daughter JANE to the KING.

The DUKE of NORFOLK, (never far away), notices how modestly and

demurely young JANE SEYMOUR flirts.

F

She has been well trained.

But she makes no impact on HENRY. He waves the SEYMOURS away.

Not remotely interested.

INT. MARY'S ROOM - LYING-IN - EVENING

The KING is visiting MARY. He sits by her bed. They hold hands

and are talking intimately.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

This is being watched by the DUKE of NORFOLK, and SIR THOMAS

BOLEYN. NORFOLK's face is dark and brooding..

NORFOLK looks up...

SIR THOMAS is about to speak, then changes his mind.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

MARY sits up. Her eyes widen in horror..

Sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother GEORGE..

GEORGE turns, looks all around him..

GEORGE notices MARY's vexed expression..

GEORGE moves MARY's lips into an upward shape..

MARY's lips: a reluctant, unconvincing smile..

EXT. VILLAGES - DAY

The RIDERS and the WOMAN gallop through villages, spraying mud.

VILLAGERS stop and stare..

A MOTHER pulls a child out of the path of the RIDERS.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

The RIDERS and the WOMAN ride in silhouette against a perfect

full moon..

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

HENRY and several of his COURTIERS return from a hunting trip.

Several dead STAGS are carried on horseback. The atmosphere is

celebratory. It's been a good day.

Dogs bark in excitement.

INT. GREENWICH PALACE - THAT NIGHT

A dinner at court. HENRY is at one end, in serious conversation

with foreign AMBASSADORS. Presently, at the other end of the

table, loud laughter.

H

It's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner

of the room. HENRY looks up again. Then returns to his

conversation.

HENRY loses patience..

At the other end, a COURTIER gets to his feet..

HENRY's expression changes. The room falls silent..

Then HENRY smiles. Delighted. DOGS bark in bewilderment. Soon

MARY lies in bed. Sitting by her side is her father..

SIR THOMAS smiles as he remembers..

MARY shoots a private, knowing look..

MARY stares hollow-eyed..

EXT. TILTYARD - DAY

HENRY and several of his closest COURTIERS are sparring close-

combat sword fighting. It's tough, physical, no-holds barred

stuff..

INT. ARMOURY - DAY

AFTERWARDS: HENRY and his COURTIERS, (among them GEORGE), are

being undressed and washed by their PAGES and SQUIRES..

There is a powerful physicality, a sexual confidence to HENRY

which he exudes, even among men. He moves closer to GEORGE.

GEORGE has tried to put HENRY off. But might just have said the

wrong thing.

INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - COURT - FOLLOWING DAY

A small, precious-looking GIFT BOX sits on a table.

ANNE looks at the box. Her heart misses a beat. It carries the

unmistakable royal seal.

A SERVANT stares..

The SERVANT opens it. Other SERVANTS crane their necks, stand on

tiptoes. Inside is a large pearl pendant. The SERVANT gasps.

ANNE, too. Covers her mouth. It's beautiful..

But from somewhere, she manages to find the strength..

The SERVANT stares in disbelief..

The SERVANT bows, and leaves, taking the box. ANNE watches, a

A ROYAL MESSENGER, in the King's livery, holding a larger, more

expensive looking GIFT BOX, walks towards the Boleyn house..

ANNE shakes her head, and sends the gift back. She looks

anxious. Knows this is a high risk game she's playing.

The MESSENGER stands in front of the KING, holding the rejected

BOX in his hands..

EXT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - DAY

The same ROYAL MESSENGER walks towards the BOLEYN house. This

COURTIERS, bursts through doors, and storms along a corridor.

It's an impressive sight..

People scatter to get out of the way.

INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - COURT - DAY

The KING bursts in. Everyone leaps to their feet. SERVANTS stop

and stare and curtsey. LADY ELIZABETH bows, clearly thrown..

HENRY turns full circle, looking for someone..

The MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS stare at one another, visibly

embarrassed by what they have just witnessed.

The clearing of throats, averting of eyes. Then they get on with

their work to the sound of the MARY's cries..

INT. SIR THOMAS'S STUDY - NIGHT

`Crash', SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK burst into the study, angrily

slamming the door closed behind them. ANNE is inside.

NORFOLK stares at ANNE..

ANNE stares back defiantly..

Not a flicker of emotion on her face.
