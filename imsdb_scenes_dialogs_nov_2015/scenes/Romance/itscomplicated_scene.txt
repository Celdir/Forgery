As long as I've known you both,

you've always managed to somehow do

everything entirely right.

-- That's so true.

But, honestly, how can it be thirty

years!?!   When did we do that trip

to Spain?

It was for both of our what..?

-- Fifteenth anniversaries.

God, that was a great trip...

Ollie, how was graduation?

It was fantastic. I can't believe

I'm not in school anymore. When's

Luke's graduation?

Next week.

It's in three days!

Sorry!   I mean this week.

Are the girls going?

They can't wait.

How long is Luke home before he has

to go back for work?

-- Only a week...

Aw, that's it?

I know, I hate it. Well...

Congrats again...

Great party...

You're leaving?

Yeah, I have some

-- stuff I have to get done tonight

for work...

I'll see you two in New York.

Absolutely. Lookin' forward to it.

Good.    Well....

-- Jane, what are you wearing to

the graduation?

Oh, a suit or dress, probably a

suit.

Fancy.    Okay.

See you there, Janey.    Where are

you staying again?

We're at The Park Regent. You said

you were at The Four Seasons,

right?

I don't know.

Where are we?

We're at The Park Regent too.

Oh. Good.     That'll be convenient,

actually.     Okay, so, see you soon..

-- I'll walk you out.

So, Ted, do you think you can help

us get Pedro into El Montecito for

kindergarten?

I thought it was sweet how well you

and Jake were getting along. Felt

like old times.

Yeah, well, we know how to do this

by now. It has been ten years.

That's crazy.

Okay, your Mom is home. She'll

figure this out.

Gabby, you're leaving now? I

thought you were going in the

morning?

I know but my friends are all there

and they wanted me to come tonight.

But honey, it's gonna get dark

soon. You can't see out the back

window. It's Saturday night.

People will be on the road

drinking...

Mom, she'll be there in a couple of

hours, she'll be fine.

Okay, I'm leaving this stuff here.

I'll be back for it in a few days.

Want me to drive it down in the

morning?

I could be there by lunch. We could

go to that big Bed, Bath, and

Beyond, buy kitchen stuff... Gabby,

can you look up from that thing??

I got it covered, Ma.

Hey gangsta, help me carry these...

Yep....

Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the

house alone?

What are you....? No!

-- I'm not! One of you is always

moving out...

But I am wondering who I'm gonna

watch The Hills with?

Mamacita... I'm gonna miss you.

Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing

this.

Mom, you don't happen to know where

Dad is, do you? I tried calling

him to say goodbye...

He was at Sally and Ted's.

He was? How was that? You and

them at the same --

-- not that it's in any way, any of

my... was just...

-- It was....

-- whatever. It was fine.

Was her lunatic child there?

Not this time. Gabby, call me when

you get there. Do NOT forget.

Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, niiice....I

like this wall of windows, Peter.

That was Adam actually.

Oh.

Love where you put the stairs.

That's so good!

Adam's idea...

Oh my God, the kitchen! Finally -

I have a real kitchen with four

walls... It's...oh, wow...you

actually understood what I wanted!

All Adam.

I'm happy you like it.

Okay. Hi.

Hello.

You read all my e-mails.

All 47 of them.

Jane, it's 10:15.

It is?

Oh, sorry, I have a 10:30...

dentist. Can you leave these and

I'll make a few notes? Well,

actually, I have one tiny note now.

In my bathroom...um...no his and

her sinks.

Okay, sure. No his?

Just hers.

And you don't think in the future

you might want a his?

Oh, God, we're talking code about

my life, right?

No, no, didn't mean to be.

The truth is, in my current

bathroom, I have two sinks and

sometimes the other sink makes me

feel bad.

One sink. Not a problem. Can we

schedule a meeting for next week?

Does Tuesday work for you?

Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too

early? At the house?

I'll be there.

Jane!

-- Hey..

Hiii.

Hello.

-- Perfect.

Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake.

Hold on Pedro, I'm talking to

someone.

Pedro, up! Now!!

What are you doing in this

building?

Dentist.

You don't go to Sharon anymore?

Uh, no... changed.

You know it's not healthy not to

have sex for...however long it's

been...

Trust me... I'm not not doing it on

purpose.

Okay. I don't know if this is true,

but I read on line about this woman

who hadn't done it in so long her

vagina closed up.

What!!!    Get out of here.

I swear to God. It grew back

together.

Wait. Was it ever one piece?

All I know is, she had to have a

vaginaplasty.

Ouch!!!!

Oh my Goddddddd.

"Dr. Moss, Hi. I have a little

situation that needs fixing...."

Bubbee, you want to fix your

situation? Just date someone.

Seriously. Anyone.

I have an Adler, J. in a Superior

Suite, Park Avenue view. Oh, I'm

sorry, here it is. Adler J -- two

Standard Doubles. Sorry about

that.

Yeah, we're not the ones in the

Superior Suite. Have the other

Adlers checked in yet? Just

wondering.

No, they haven't, ma'am. Not yet.

Now I just need a credit card and

your signature.

-- Mom, is it okay if the girls

come with me now and help me set

up?

And by girls he means the three of

us.

Wait. Hold on. Set up what? I have

reservations for all of us for

dinner. That's not happening now?

I don't know. Me and my friends

are having this huge thing at our

apartment and the girls said they'd

help us set up..

We're going to be together all day

tomorrow.

-- Mom, it's his last night before

graduation.

Okay, okay.    Do you want me to

help or...

Pinot Noir, please. No, you know

what? I'll have a Tanqueray Martini

very dry with a twist.

Where's your....??

Pedro got the stomach flu so I'm

flying solo.

Really? Didn't know you knew how

to be by yourself.

Any chance you could just go easy

on me? Just a one night free pass.

You look good, Janey.

Yeah....

You do. You always do.   Your

hair's shorter.

Longer.

I like it.

Mrs. Adler, your table's ready.

Want some company, Mrs. Adler?

I would like to propose a toast to

your Mother.

To me?

I've done my part with you guys,

but Jane... you -- very talented

you...

Oh, God...

Gabby, I'm serious. Jane, you did

a magnificent job, as you always

do...

When I look at the three of you

beautiful kids...all grown up, I

think of all the work your mother

did, much of it without my help...

Dude...pull it together.

-- Janey, I take my hat off to you.

Okay, Jake. Thank you.

Out of nowhere, sudden

appreciation. But thank you.

Really.

Not totally out of nowhere,

Jane...if you know what I mean.

Which I don't...but...

What's he...?

So who's coming home when?   No

one's told me the details.

Hey.

How's Pedro feeling?

Okay, we're gonna help pack Luke

up, the three of us leave day after

tomorrow and Luke's home the end of

the week.

-- I will. Call you when I land.

Janey, what flight are you on?

I'm on the uh, the four o'clock.

Ah, too bad. I'm on the five

o'clock.

That's nuts, why don't you try to

get on the same flight?

Yeah, I could try.

It's been...great, but let's not

... push it.

He was just trying to be nice.

I know. Okay, I've got to hit the

road, guys.

Jane!

It's Adam...

It's 8:30 Tuesday morning!

Are we still okay?

Yes! Totally forgot! I'm so

sorry! Can you give me a lift back

to the house?

Sure...come on in.

-- But perhaps the most important

lesson in going through your

divorce is to learn to forgive.

Forgiveness is the key to--

In spite of your hurt feelings,

prove to her that you can be a

mature--

Just getting a divorce?

Not possible?

-- Yes, but you'll wake up in the

morning, open your bedroom door and

fall 12 feet into your kitchen.

Ahhh! Forgot it was all open up

there!

But I get where you're headed.

Let me see what I can do... This

property is so great... Have you

lived here a long time?

About ten years. I bought this

place right after my divorce but

it's taken me until now to be able

to finally do this....

Good morning!

Am I interrupting...?

Hi. No, well, we   were just about

done. Adam, this   is my ex-husband,

Jake. Jake, this   is Adam Schaeffer,

my architect.

Hi.

Good to meet you.

Can I take a look?   Do you mind?

Why haven't you returned any of my

calls or e-mails?

Jake, come on. This is just too

weird. We have to just never do

what we did - ever again. You're

an adulterer and I'm an awful

person, basically. I haven't slept

in days. What we did was just so

wrong on so many levels.

And it was so right on a couple of

levels too. Admit it.

No! It wasn't! On no levels was

it right!

You can't say we didn't enjoy each

other's company. Sitting at the

bar, dancing...after dancing...

Come on, you and I haven't had fun

like that in a hundred years.

Yes! Because we're not supposed to

have fun like that! We're

divorced!   Are you like, what?

Unhappy at home?   Does she not

"understand" you? Did you just

want to know what it would be like

with someone my age? What is this?

I'd be lying if I said I never

think about you, Janey. I think

about you. A lot. And no, it's not

perfect at home. Obviously. Look

at me. I've got three grown kids

and I'm going to kindergarten

interviews. I'm a walking cliche.

Could I interest you in a little...

No!

Why do you think the sex is so much

sexier this time?

I don't know.

I've gotta get to work.

Me too. Okay...

See what happens when you're not

looking out for me.

She lets me eat everything.. pasta,

cream cheese...

Can you hand me my robe?

Why do I have to..?

-- Because the last time you saw me

standing up naked I was in my

forties.

Things look different lying down.

Just...

You've gotten a little nuts.

Jake, I think it would be really

good for us to not talk for a few

days. Okay?

You know what I think -- just for

the record? I think we're doing

something kinda brilliant. All the

things that tore us apart aren't

issues anymore. I'd say our

problems actually went away.

What..?

Didn't you always say you felt you

weren't being heard? Wasn't that

our big issue -- both of us always

feeling rejected and unappreciated.

Look at us now. You're so much

more together, you're not exhausted

all the time, you're not catering

every weekend and busy all day with

the kids and I'm calmer, less

obsessed about work. I'm a partner.

I'm there. We grew into the people

we wanted each other to be! And I

don't know... I appreciate things

about you I couldn't even see

before.

Really?

What? When did this happen?

Where'd you meet him?

Well, it... started in New York.

In New York??? Last week?

Yeah, we did it once there and once

here. Maybe more than once there,

I was drunk so...

You had drunken sex with a married

man in New York when you went for

Luke's graduation?

Turns out I'm a bit of a slut.

Apple, Blueberry or Plum?

Wait, wait, wait. Hold on....

You're not saying!!!!

-- What?

No! You're not!

Oh, God, but I am. I'm having an

affair with Agness Adler's husband.

That. Is. Genius!

But also sort of wrong.

I know.

Coming!

What were you doing in there?

Going to the bathroom.

The toilet didn't flush.

Yes it did.

Why were you in the shower with

your clothes on?

What are you talking about?

I heard the shower door close.

What do you have, x-ray ears?

What's up Pedro?

Jake took a shower with his clothes

on.

Pedro!    Darling...

What's he talking about?

I don't speak Pedro.   That's your

department.

I know what it's like to have your

ex remarried and to not have so

much going on in that department.

I mean, do you date ever or...

Uh, constantly actually.

Constantly?

Everyone I know or have ever known

has fixed me up. And then,

sometimes I just meet women, I

don't know how that happens, but...

-- But no girlfriend?

Not yet.

Just like to date...

Actually, I find it really

stressful. You know, the last time

I was in the dating world was 1978.

It's a little more complicated

these days. I can't tell you how

nice it is to have a conversation

with a woman and have the pressure

off. Not to mention, a home cooked

meal that no one else I know could

possibly cook.

That was a compliment. So you

don't have a guy in your life at

the moment?

No....

No.

O.M.G. I thought he'd never leave.

Hello Jane, you look very beautiful

tonight.

Mmmmm. Love when you smell like

butter.

What are you doing here?

Missed you.

It's nine o'clock. Where does your

wife think you are?

At yoga.   Shall we do some

downward facing dog?

Not tonight big guy.

Is it really necessary for you to

always say no before you say yes? I

won't think less of you, you know.

Really, Jake, I'm a little tired, I

was just gonna take a bath.

Good. So, we'll just hang out.

Ooooo, is that Croque-Monsieur?

Who's plate is this? Yours or his?

Mine.

What's with the `big guy'? Is that

because you think I'm fat or is it

a term of endearment?

I have no idea why I keep saying

that. I'm sorry. I'll stop.

Thank you.

I love how quiet it is in your

house. I have no quiet in my life.

Ever.

Yeah, well, you live with a five

year old.

Yes...and don't forget Pedro.

So what does that mean exactly...?

What's going on over there at your

place?

My marriage is... not turning out

as I hoped. That's obvious....

Agness started out really looking

up to me... We never used to fight

but now... with the kid....lately

we're all about where he's gonna go

to school and now she says we need

a bigger house, more help. I was

thinking of cutting back at work...

now that's never gonna happen. And

she wants another baby before Pedro

gets too old which I get but since

we're always fighting... oh, God,

listen to me.

Isn't a baby part of the deal when

you marry a woman that age?

Is it? I guess so. She's got me

booked at the fertility center

every other day and she's so amped

up on hormone injections I may need

to find an exorcist if she doesn't

calm down.

I wish it was funny.

Incredible ice cream. I'm turning

around...

Remember when we used to smoke pot

and eat your ice cream in the hot

tub?

The "hot tub"... That feels like a

billion years ago.

How long has it been since you...

Me?   Since before Lauren was born.

27 years?!!

At least.

Are you kidding me? Put that away!

It's been too long...

Exactly.

I'm not going to....

Okay, why don't I leave this with

you... (It's kind of amazing.)

Maybe you'll take a few hits...

Oh, you got a little ice cream on

your shirt. Let me get that out.

It's okay...

Wow, wow, wow...what's happening,

Jake?

Don't get it.

I always get it. I have three

kids.

Hello. Hiii...

You still on the plane? How was

Luke when you left? Oh, that

sounds like fun. Let me know what

I can bring..... No! Don't have

any idea where he is.

Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow.

Now I'm lying...... Lauren and

Harley are giving Luke a graduation

party this weekend. Sweet, huh?

Hello stranger. Welcome back.

You know, the kids are finally gone

and now all of a sudden Jake's back

and I get to take care of him in

some way...

And, listen, I get how therapy

works, I do... We look at things,

we examine them, weeks turn into

months, what....? we're going on

eight years, right?.... and I'm

okay with that, I like it... but in

this case, I need to know what you

really think. Like, I'd like you

to say... Don't do this, it's

absolutely wrong or go ahead,

you'll be fine. I actually want to

be told what to do.

What's interesting is I'm already

seeing you open up more than I have

in some time. I'm thinking,

through this affair, you may learn

to view the world in a different

way.

I'm sorry. I need more concrete.

Are you saying I should keep seeing

him? Because, honestly, if the

guilt and fear could go away, maybe

I could let go a little and figure

this out.

I wouldn't resist looking at this.

Okay... and another way of saying

that is....?

Let go Jane. It can't hurt.

Harley!!!

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spit on

you. I just needed to kiss you.

While you were choking?

It worked.     I'm not choking

anymore.

Who did you just see?

No one. Thought it was your

cousin...but...

Ohhhh my sweet Lord....

Now what?

Honey, I totally forgot I have a

conference call at 1:15, I gotta

get back to the office. Waiter!

Honey, stop eating, get the waiter.

Call the one over there.

Harley, we can't leave, we're

meeting with the Wedding

Specialist.

When you got dizzy, did you feel

your heart was beating funny?

Yes, but I was admiring my

beautiful...

-- Well that's nice to hear after

all these years...

Did you forget to take any of your

medications today?

Took `em all.

What all did you take?

Uh....Lipitor, baby aspirin..

Flomax.

Flomax?

Yes, otherwise I pee 40 times a

day.

How long have you been taking the

Flomax?

Not that long. And I only take it

sporadically. I have to sneak it

actually.

It reduces semen and that's not

good for my wife right now.

Sorry.

I knew you were all going to be

here for the weekend so I made a

bunch of stuff last night.

Looks like Jake Adler's favorite

meal to me.

Very funny.

Very.

Harley?

Yay!!!!

Mom, this looks amazing.

Hi.

Hey.

Where should I put this...?

Wherever.

That looks incredible.

Thanks.

Jake?   Glass of wine?

Uh, sure.    Thanks.

Jane?

No thank you.

Hi Ag... Just got here.

Okay, I will. Yeah, no, I know.

I'm sorry guys, I gotta hit it.

Bye-bye.

-- None of my beeswax, Jane.

And please never tell me.

What's up?

Nothin', punky.

Yeah? So, we're going to see you

tomorrow night, for sure, right?

Okay...What did you see and what do

you know?

Nothing. Really.

Okay, he checked in, you arrived,

you met in the elevator, possible

kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor

came down, thumbs up. That's it.

Have no idea what happened in

between.

Have you told Lauren?

No and I won't --

Mom. Dad's leaving...

Uh. No, I don't. But I have. But

I don't think I've had any since my

kids were born...so not in like 27

years.

Oh my God, we have kids the same

age! And I haven't had any since

my kids were born either!!! Except

for tonight. I had one hit off of

this.

You might not want to hold that

quite so...

Hello Officer.

I actually know him! Blueberry

scone and a latte.

Oh my God! That was horrifying. I

instantly saw myself in a mug shot.

My heart is leaping out of my...

Wow... This is the most insane

dashboard I've ever seen. It's like

we're in a cockpit. It's

spectacular. Adam, what kind of

car is this?

Jane?

Hi.

Did you get this high from one hit?

Hey, there's your ex-husb-- Uh-Oh.

He's headed right toward us. Not

the time to be "feeling groovy"

Oooo. Why so intense, big fella?

Hello Jane.... Adam.

Hey, good to see you again.

Adam, this is Agness, Jake's

wife...

Now that is an odd sentence for me

to say since that was me for most

of my life. Seriously. How weird

is that? Both of us married to the

same man!

You know... it's... hey, what are

you gonna do?

Yeah, why go there.

Because there, is...fascinating. I

mean, when you think about it, it

sort of links us in some cosmic

crazy way, doesn't it, Agness? Of

all the men on the planet, we both

said "I do" to this guy.

Yeah. Twenty-five years apart. I

know you're having like an "Ah-Ha'

moment, but I think I'm gonna get a

refill. Adam, good meeting you.

-- What?   What am I, Jake?

You're my ex-wife, lover, oldest

friend and girlfriend.

Okay. You're hilarious. And

because of that, even though I kind

of hate you/love you, I'm going to

let you have some...

You love me? I mean, I heard "hate"

had top billing, but...

Oh my God, you're smoking weed in

the guest bathroom.

Yes we are and we'd appreciate it

if you didn't tell anyone about

this.

No. Never.     Adding it to the list.

Care for a toke?

I don't really smoke marijuana.

Me either.

Okay, one hit.

Oh. Baby.

Mmmmmmmm.

It's crazy how good this is.

Yeah, and I'm not even stoned

anymore.

Neither am I.

Oh, then...merci, Monsieur.

Do you remember when I asked you

the other night, if you were dating

anyone and you said no... It

sounded to me like you were maybe

saying yes.

I was sort of seeing someone.     But,

it's over now.

Honestly.

`Cause I'm not strong enough to

fall for someone who's with someone

else. Wouldn't be able to take

that again.

I understand. I wouldn't say it

was over if it wasn't.

Great.

Hey sleepy! What time did you get

in?

Have no idea. Lauren and Harley

drove me home.

I'm surprised you remember that.

Hi. I didn't know you slept here.

We were playing Scattagories with

Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell

asleep on the couch.

Sweet.

I got cold in the middle of the

night.

Okay, who wants what?

Hi baby...

What's Dad doing here?

What's the difference? I was

drowning over there. I'm not going

to get that many more chances in my

life to figure myself out. Janey,

let's use these couple of days to

see if we can make this work.

We can't, Jake. I told you this

the other night. Please listen.

But you were all pissy because you

thought I stood you up. Things are

different now. I'm a free man.

Can we just hug? I hate that

you're being so distant. It's

literally giving me a pain in my

stomach.

Oh, God...

See!    Too much!

Okay!    Good note.

Can I help with what you're doing?

Hold your basket or...

I'm fine....

Okay... I'm going to go to the

video store and get us all a dvd to

watch tonight. We'll have movie

night. Just like old times. How's

that? I'll make the popcorn.

What do you mean... you were ten

when we broke up.

I was eight actually and I don't

know...it's all foggy to me now.

You don't remember us in Hawaii or

all sleeping in that tent in the

backyard.

Yeah, of course, but I don't

remember like you and Mom hugging

or waking up together...

-- It's okay. I'm not damaged or

anything. You've been good

parents...

Speak for yourself dude. I'm

definitely damaged from the

divorce.

Hello troops.

Why are you still here?

I don't know, you and Mom sleeping

in the same house. Harley thought

we should stay.

She exaggerates. I just thought

perhaps you might want to talk

later, or ... Is that the noodle

thing?

Oh. Sorry. I think I ate it all.

The guy ran out of fabric so he

didn't make me long sleeves.

Or short sleeves. It's weird.

And kinda girly.

Not what I'm going for.

Gray sweater. Very old.

But cute.

You sure? You don't have to say you

like it just because you nixed the

last 20 things.

Keep it. It's cozy.   Boy, you have

a lot of clothes.

Uh, not anymore. Okay, we're

almost done. You are helping me so

much by the way.

-- Adam, I really have to pee.

Oh good. Me too. Meet you back in

thirty....

Putting this on my desk....

I'm not in there...

Why are you naked!?!

Why do you think?

Okay, I'm gonna be sick.

Not working! Big close up!

Okay!   Good night!

Everybody okay?

What's happening?

Okay. Let me explain. The reason I

left Agness wasn't just because my

marriage wasn't working.

I've also fallen in love...back in

love... with your mother. Or maybe

I never stopped loving her.

Is this a joke?

Knowing how to be divorced is next

to impossible... and sometimes over

the years, I've thought that your

Dad and I weren't quite finished.

And, as it turns out, we weren't.

So I went out of my comfort zone,

which, I found out, if you're

really honest with yourself, isn't

all that comforting. So, I

experimented with a part of myself.

I wanted to find out if, after all

these years there was still

something there between us.

And was there?

There kinda was.

But Mom, you have to understand how

bonkers this sounds to us. For two

people who for years couldn't be in

the same room together...to then

have an affair??? You and Dad...!

I know...it was hard for me and I

was doing it. I hope you'll

forgive me for confusing you or

betraying your trust, but I did

this for me and for him and I

realized even though your Dad and I

once had something extraordinary...

we no longer really fit together.

But he is a part of me and always

will be.

So it's over now? You guys are

back to being divorced.

For better or for worse.

I want you to know it didn't last

long and you're divorced, so maybe

you understand, when marriages end,

there's doubts and hurt, and you've

got kids and sometimes you wonder

if you did the right thing and when

the moment presented itself...

-- I get it. I could imagine it...I

could...

I told him it wasn't going to work

between us but I guess he didn't

believe me and unbeknownst to me,

he showed up at my house yesterday.

He left Agness and...

-- Jane. I actually think I

understand what happened

but...uh...you know I'm not as

macho as I appear and I think it's

probably best for us not to get any

more... involved because your

relationship with Jake isn't really

done and I know you're saying it

is, but he's in love with you and

for everyone's sake, that should

probably get resolved.

Wow.   So that's how grown ups talk.

Please tell me you're not going to

quit my job and ask Peter to take

over because then I'll never get to

see you and...

I was thinking of asking Peter to

step back in.

Oh... I hope you don't...

Thanks.

Good, I could use one.

Would you all like to have your

meeting in the house...it's dry and

I've got hot coffee...

Jane, I need to ask you

something...

Anything...

You wouldn't happen to have any of

those amazing chocolate croissants,

would you?

Oh.... you like those, huh?

I have incredibly fond memories of

them.

I don't have any here, but we could

go into town and get some... right

out of the oven.

You want to do that?

Yeah... love to.
