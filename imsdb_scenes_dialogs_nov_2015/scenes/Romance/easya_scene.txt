INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

OLIVE PENDERGHAST (17), a cute teenager, speaks directly into

the WEBCAM atop her computer.

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

Olive sits with her best friend, RHIANNON ABERNATHY (17), a

brash teenager. It would be safe to say that these girls are

definitely on the "B List" at their school.

Olive starts to say something, but Rhiannon interrupts her.

Rhiannon folds her arms and pouts.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Olive continues to narrate into her webcam.

INT. THE ABERNATHY LIVING ROOM

MR. and MRS. ABERNATHY (50's) sit on their couch, smiling at

the television, in their horrifically rustic home.

MR. ABERNATHY bares a striking resemblance to ukelele player,

Tiny Tim. (Although the man we're looking at has an even

more frightening smile.)

MRS. ABERNATHY has hair to her ankles and dresses like a

Mormon.

We float upwards to -

INT. RHIANNON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rhiannon is on the phone, agitated.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Olive is on the other end of the phone conversation.

We INTERCUT between the two sides.

EXT. WOODS - LAST YEAR - NIGHT

Olive, uncomfortable, and Rhiannon, bored, sit around a

campfire with the Abernathys.

The couple stare at the fire with the same creepy smile

plastered on their faces.

There is an excruciatingly long and painful silence.

Mrs. Abernathy squeaks out a meek titter that is annoyingly

high-pitched.

Mrs. Abernathy titters again. Rhiannon rolls her eyes.

There is another awkwardly long silence, while the Abernathys

grin away at their fire.

INT. RHIANNON'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Rhiannon is getting increasingly angrier at her friend.

She quickly catches her faux pas and stops talking.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Although still skeptical, she seems a tad more mollified.

INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

Rhi and Olive continue their conversation, as Rhi pops a

tater tot into her mouth.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Rhi sits, bored and uncomfortable, while her parents smile at

the campfire for an, again, awkwardly long moment.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

To her webcam --

Ken Nordine's beat poem `OLIVE,' (from the late 60's album

`Colors'), underscored to jazz, plays as we see a montage of

In her bedroom, Olive --

-- watches `The Notebook,' pining over Ryan Gosling.

-- paints her toenails Jungle Red.

-- dances to the jazz music, but alone, in her underwear and

a t-shirt that declares: `Hands off.'

-- reads TEEN PEOPLE magazine.

-- dances some more.

Out of breath from dancing, she walks over and displaces the

NEEDLE from the KEN NORDINE ALBUM she's playing.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

To the webcam --

INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Olive and Rhi walk, with books in hand, to class - weaving in

and out of people.

Rhiannon suddenly stops and twirls Olive to face her.

Pedestrian students stop in their tracks to stare at them.

Olive grabs her and drags her forward, interrupting the show.

Rhi drags her into the --

INT. GIRLS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-- and abrasively, gets up in Olive's face.

Pressured, Olive lies.

A well-manicured FEMALE HAND stacks WOODEN JENGA BLOCKS onto

a table.

The toilet flushes and MARIANNE BRYANT (16), an Aryanesque,

cardigan-wearing Christian-girl exits from a stall and walks

to the sink, where she vigorously washes her hands - while

staring at Rhi and Olive with disgust.

Marianne wipes her hands and leaves the restroom. Olive's

stomach revolves at her now-turned-public admission.

(I promise it's the last time...)

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

The Abernathys smile at the campfire, roasting WEINERS.

Rhiannon would rather be anywhere other than there.

Rhi snorts in contempt of her father and his wienie.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - LAST YEAR

Marianne and her lackey, NINA HOWELL (16), who's just as

awful as she is, pass out flyers.

Marianne aggressively shoves her literature into passing

students faces.

INT. GYM - LAST YEAR

The school's MASCOT (17), a SHIRTLESS MUSCULAR KID painted

BLUE and costumed as a DEVIL, bursts into the auditorium and

begins to rile students up by thrusting his PITCHFORK in the

air.

The crowd goes wild.

INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - LAST YEAR -

Marianne, melodramatically, grabs a PASSING STUDENT by the

arm.

The scared student takes her pamphlet and runs away.

INT. GYM - LAST YEAR - MONTHS LATER

The mascot, unenthusiastic and feeling ridiculous, walks into

the gym dressed as a --

He can't seem to get himself or the student body as excited -

with the exception of Marianne and Nina, in the stands

applauding proudly.

The school band is playing `GOLDFINGER.'

Across the gym, Olive sits with Rhiannon.

Rhiannon laughs.

They both get lost in the thought.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Olive loads books into her locker. She sees Marianne walk

past with Nina. They give her a repulsed look.

Olive decides to nip this in the bud. She catches up to

them.

Nina, reluctantly, gives them a moment alone.

Olive knows that Marianne knows her name, but obligingly

nods.

Olive looks over and sees that Nina is talking to a group of

GUYS, who are looking at Olive, intrigued.

Marianne sees what her friend is doing and smiles at Olive,

coldly.

She turns on her heels and leaves Olive behind.

She shakes off her attempt and continues on her way, walking

past the guys who smile at her. This alarms her.

Without stopping --

Battling her frustration, she goes to class.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Olive eats dinner with her family.

Her father, DILL (40's), is a regular dad-kinda-guy. Her

mother, ROSEMARY (40's) is heavyset with a fun disposition.

Also in attendance is her `a-little-too-precious' sister,

GINGER (12).

Olive and her folks get along really well.

They all nod at her.

They continue to eat.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

She takes a deep breath.

INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

As Olive walks through school, she is met with a totally

different energy. She no longer blends in. Guys are

checking her out. Girls are glaring at her, scornfully.

She's kind of digging it.

INT. CLOSET

In almost complete darkness, a very nervous EIGHTH GRADE

OLIVE (13) sits with a scared shitless EIGHTH GRADE KID (13).

You can hear other PRE-TEENS snickering and whispering

outside the door.

Olive presses a button and her watch illuminates.

The kid snickers. He feels a little more at ease.

They both laugh.

The kid smiles warmly and gratefully at her.

She extends her pinky to him. They link pinkies and they

swear on it.

There's a long silence.

There's another long silence. Finally, from outside the door

Olive and the kid listen as people scurry from outside the

closet.

The kid starts to make his grand escape, but Olive stops him.

The kid smiles.

He extends his pinky and she links it to hers. He kisses her

quickly on the cheek and darts from the closet.

Olive sits in the closet for a moment, contemplating what

just happened, wondering if he was telling the truth, then

she opens the door.

The coast is clear, except for ANOTHER PRETEEN KID walking

past. She aggressively grabs him and pulls him into the

closet with her and, promptly, thrusts her tongue into his

mouth.

They make out.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Olive seems lost in thought. She snaps back to reality and

the task at hand.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Olive half-listens in class, while her English teacher MR.

GRIFFIN (early 30's), a handsome guy, lectures on `THE

SCARLET LETTER.'

Nina raises her hand. Mr. Griffin points to her.

Nina whips around and gives Olive a look, surprising her.

The class bursts into surprised laughter. Even Mr. Griffin

tries hard to suppress a congratulatory glance in her

direction.

Mr. Griffin, begrudgingly, calls her to his desk. He starts

writing something on a piece of paper.

INT. FRONT OFFICE - BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Olive sits with her arms crossed outside of the Principal's

office. She clenches a note in her fist.

Marianne, who's an office aid, has a smirk on her face as she

watches Olive squirm. She slams her fist down on the

stapler, repetitively.

Neither says anything for a few moments.

The principal's door opens and Marianne quickly shuts up and

continues her work.

TWO KIDS emerge. One, obviously, a bully; the other,

obviously, the bullied. The BULLIED kid is holding a

BLOODIED TISSUE up to his nose. He and Olive exchange

meaningful glances.

PRINCIPAL GIBBONS (60's), a colossal prick disguised as a

man, gestures for her to come in. Olive gets up and enters --

INT. PRINCIPAL GIBBONS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He closes the door behind them. He holds his hand out and

she gives him the note that Mr. Griffin wrote. Gibbons

studies it.

She thrusts her hand out.

He eyes her hand, not amused, and she quickly withdraws it.

As serious as a heart attack...

She starts to say something --

She relents, but stares him squarely in the eyes.

He gestures to the door.

She quickly runs out of his office.

EXT. BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Rhiannon, excitedly, approaches Olive - dying to talk to her.

Rhiannon ignores her sincere attempt to confess.

Rhiannon pulls her keys from her purse and they walk to her

car.

They get into her car.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The scene looks the same. Olive sits with her family, having

family dinner.

Her parents seem more impressed than upset. This is

definitely a first.

Olive looks to her little sister and thinks better of saying

the word out loud.

Both her parents wheels are going. They're both seeking the

answer in their heads, but are coming up with nothing.

She leans over and whispers something in her daughter's ear.

Her parents search their brains, but nothing is coming to

them.

Excited by the prospect --

She begins maneuvering her peas around the plate.

Olive touches her index finger to her nose, as she continues

to manipulate her food.

Too intrigued by Olive's admission to really care --

Rosemary figures it out as Olive is assembling the A.

She leans over and whispers it in Dill's ear. He nods in

understanding.

Olive quickly scrapes the peas into a pile.

Now, it's Dill's turn to whisper in Rosemary's ear. She nods

in understanding.

Olive gets up from the table and kisses her dad on the cheek.

She goes over and kisses her mom on the cheek, as well.

Leaving the dining room --

She retreats upstairs.

Dill chuckles, but Ginger is not amused.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

She smiles slyly into her camera.

INT. ROOM 704 - DAY

Bored, Olive sits at a desk in a classroom, reading a

tattered copy of `The Scarlet Letter.' She's dressed much

racier and is starting to look pretty hot.

There's only one other person in the room. The BULLIED KID

seen by Olive leaving Gibbons's office the day before.

The bullied kid is thin as a rail, pale as a ghost and

slightly effeminate. He looks miserable. Not just by this

detention, but from life in general.

Olive laughs to herself.

Brandon shoots her a `that's not funny' look.

He laughs.

There's a brief silence between them.

Ignoring his cynicism --

Tell me about it.

He's not real. The guy I slept

with. I made him up.

So, you started the rumor?

Indirectly? Sort of. Well, not

really. No. No, I didn't.

But you're perpetuating it. That's

fucked up.

Excuse me?

It's true. There's only one thing

worse than these tabloid-chasing

celebutantes with their vapid minds

and their immoral souls and that's

the people who want to be like

them.

Did I say I wanted to be like them?

No, you just want everyone else to

think you are.

Why does it matter if it's not who

I really am? No offense, Brando,

but maybe you could learn something

from me.

You're saying I should pretend to

be straight, so people will like

me? What a novel idea. You should

do seminars. Oh, wait a minute, I

forgot... In high school,

EVERYBODY PRETENDS TO BE SOMETHING

THEY'RE NOT!

Brandon realizes why she's chosen this path and feels for

her.

She smiles sinisterly at him.

There is an electricity in the air and it seems as if at any

moment, they might fling off their clothes and screw right

there.

They both break character and return to being themselves.

Brandon thinks hard about everything that's just been said.

His brain is going a-mile-a-minute. In that noggin, an idea

has been planted.

Olive, not oblivious to this, returns to her novel.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Olive lounges on her bed, flipping through a magazine and

talking to Rhiannon on the phone.

A call beeps in on the other line.

She clicks over.

Olive clicks over to Rhiannon.

Olive is stoked by her idea.

INT. FOYER - PENDERGHAST HOME - NIGHT

Rosemary opens the door to see Brandon. She has no idea who

he is.

Brandon walks in and Rosemary shouts --

Brandon's eyes bulge and Olive descends the staircase.

Olive grabs Brandon by the hand and leads him upstairs to --

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

She closes the door behind them.

She gestures for him to sit down.

She looks at him, strangely.

He nervously nods.

It's his turn to smile slyly at her. She sees where he's

going with this and instantly gets defensive.

She sees tears forming in his eyes.

She walks away from him and is silent for a long few moments.

Brandon wipes his tears away and is the happiest gay you've

ever seen. He throws his arms around her and won't let go.

It seems as if that last statement was more for herself than

it was for him.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

INT. BOSTIC HOUSE - NIGHT

A TEEN PARTY rages. DRUNK KIDS abound.

Olive, looking like a million-fuckin'-bucks, prances into the

party with Brandon, who's looking pretty snazzy himself.

They appear drunk and are falling all over each other.

People stare in complete amazement at a.) Their appearance

and b.) That they're even together in the first place.

You'd never guess that this was anything less than an A-LIST

TEEN COUPLE, ripped from the pages of Teen People.

Olive falls against Brandon laughing. He hoists her up, as

their host, MELANIE BOSTIC (17), a fairly pretty girl,

approaches.

She stares glassy-eyed at Melanie. Brandon just smiles.

She gives her a drunken punch on the shoulder.

She spins around to the entire party, who is looking at them

with complete interest.

They raise a glass to them and Brandon and Olive stumble down

the hallway, laughing.

The bully who emerged from Gibbons's office with Brandon,

goes up to Melanie.

They, with a big group, race down the hall where Brandon and

Olive have just retreated to.

INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

Olive locks the door and drops the drunk act. She's

completely sober and so is Brandon.

Brandon runs over and pulls the blinds down. They giggle,

conspiratorially.

Olive plops down on the bed and stretches out. Brandon lays

beside her. She moans for the benefit of the audience she

knows has assembled outside. She moans again and it's very

convincing.

She leans over and whispers in his ear --

He does so. She extends her palm, impressed. He slaps it

with his.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Sure enough, it seems as if most of the party is listening at

the door - falling all over each other to hear. Nearest to

the door is the bully, who is pleasantly surprised by the

noise inside.

INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Olive reaches into her handbag and pulls out her copy of `The

Scarlet Letter' and reads it while she makes sex noises.

Brandon laughs at this and Olive smacks him with it,

prompting him to stop. She puts her finger over her lips,

giving him the `Shhhh' sign.

She continues to read as she thrusts her hips, making the bed

squeak ever so slightly.

He moans in his deepest voice. She continues to read,

crescendoing her moaning like a pro.

She takes the top of the headboard and lightly taps it

against the wall, over and over.

Brandon suppresses a laugh.

INT. GUEST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Olive is disheveling herself. Brandon musses up his hair.

She unbuttons Brandon's shirt and rebuttons it incorrectly.

He kisses her on the cheek and she smiles.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The whole crowd, leaning against the wall, quickly disperses

when the door opens.

The bully immediately hands Brandon a beer and throws his arm

around him, leading him drunkenly down the hallway, with a

crew of guys after the dirty details.

Olive looks at this and smiles, satisfied. Then she realizes

that, though the guys have gone, there are a whole slew of

girls looking at her completely differently. They avoid her

eye contact, as one would ward off Medusa.

Olive finds Melanie pretending not to be interested in her.

She begins her walk of shame down the corridor into the --

INT. KITCHEN

-- Where she runs smack-dab into the well-developed chest of

MEERKAT TODD.

They make eye contact. Olive is a sick shade of regret.

Obviously oblivious to the demonstration that just occurred --

Olive catches the reflection behind her of a group of guys

leaning against the counter, signalling `NO, DON'T DO IT' to

him behind her back.

She spins around and they instantly pretend to not be paying

attention. She glares at them.

She rushes off.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Olive lays on her bed watching the scene from `Can't Buy Me

Love' that she just performed. She eats a candy bar and

wallows in her self-pity.

Her mom comes in with a nicely-wrapped gift.

Indicating an empty space on the floor --

Rosemary puts the gift on the floor.

Rosemary leaves, chuckling at her own joke.

Too curious, Olive opens the gift. She withdraws a PHOTO of

the BULLY holding BRANDON'S LEGS while he does a KEG STAND.

She smiles, pleasantly.

She pulls out a PINK VIBRATOR and looks at it quizically.

There's an envelope inside. She opens it and pulls out a

$200 Gift Card to TARGET.

There's a note, which she reads aloud to herself.

Olive breaks out into riotous laughter. She's genuinely

touched by this gift.

The phone rings. Thinking it's Brandon, Olive snatches it

up.

INT. MALL - DAY

Rhiannon, clutching an enormous Diet Coke, plods through the

mall with an intensity reserved for girls who just found out

their best friend had her sophomore sexual exploit and didn't

bother to tell them.

WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO LOCATIONS:

Olive sighs as she slumps into her pillows.

Rhiannon screams in frustration, attracting the attention of

passing shoppers.

Entering the red zone --

She slams the phone down into the cradle and seethes.

Berlin's `SEX (I'm A...)' plays loudly as...

She goes into her closet and starts, wildly, pulling down

clothes. She throws them into a big pile in the middle of

her floor.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into her webcam --

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Olive - visibly upset - is cutting something, meticulously,

out of RED FABRIC. In fact, she has yards of red fabric

draped across her lap.

When she finishes the shape, she tosses it behind her and

begins another one.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - LATER

Olive sews these red scraps to her clothes. When she

finishes one piece, as before, she tosses it behind her and

grabs another item from the crumpled wardrobe on her floor.

Time flies and we see the clothing pile rapidly decreasing,

until there are none left.

The song morphs into -- Tommy James and the Shondell's

`CRIMSON & CLOVER' as we fade into --

INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Clad in sunglasses, fuck-me-boots and looking like a bona

fide porn star, Olive struts down the halls of her school.

Sewn across her larger and pushed up breasts is

A FIERY RED `A'

(NOTE: For the rest of the film, every piece of Olive's

clothing will be emblazoned with a RED A.)

Erections are popping up all along the halls, as well as

looks of total disbelief from the girls.

She works it like a Debbie Who Just Did Dallas, Dusseldorf,

Des Moines, Daytona, Detroit and Darfur.

Up ahead, Rhiannon is yakking with a semi-attractive guy

named ANSON (17). She catches sight of Olive and her jaw

drops.

Olive sidles up to Anson, much to Rhiannon's chagrin.

She rubs her knee, seductively, along his inner thigh, turns

and licks her lips at a repulsed Rhiannon and continues on

her way.

INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH LINE - LATER

Anything sexually suggestive you can do with school cafeteria

food, Olive does as she makes her way through the lunch line,

as guys ogle her.

Marianne, also present in the line, watches her in

repugnance.

INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

Olive emerges from the GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM, dressed for gym

class. A TERRIFIED FAT KID named EVAN nervously approaches

her.

He gestures for her to follow him underneath the bleachers.

She reluctantly does so.

She's pissed. She silently seethes.

Evan starts to talk, but she raises her hand to silence him.

Olive turns and starts to leave. Evan summons up his courage

and meekly states to her back.

She turns around and gives him a look of death. He can't

look at her.

And once again Olive feels too sorry for him to say no.

He extends his hand.

She, repulsed by it, shakes his hand. Evan's ecstatic.

With zero vitriol --

Sad for him, she walks away.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Mr. Griffin is alone grading papers. Olive pokes her head

in.

She takes a seat opposite his desk. He points to the RED "A"

on her chest.

She takes a deep breath.

Olive drops her defenses and gets real.

Mr. Griffin smiles at her.

She gets up and leaves, but passes in the doorway, a

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

Pretending to know who she is --

Olive disappears into the empty halls.

He kisses her.

He kisses her.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Assembled in a semi-circle, a handful of WELL-DRESSED

CHRISTIAN KIDS open their meeting of the CROSS YOUR HEART

CLUB with prayer. Marianne, of course, leads them in this

ritual. Nina is also present.

They all smile, say `AMEN' and open their eyes.

Marianne eyes him, suspiciously.

She tears up.

Her boyfriend, MICAH (17) takes her hand and holds it. She

leans against his shoulder, wiping away tears. Nina, on the

other side of her, begins rubbing her shoulder,

sympathetically.

She suddenly bursts into sobs. (And these aren't crocodile

tears. She is flooded with emotion.)

She wipes her tears away.

She takes Micah and Nina's hands, the rest of the group

follows suit.

They all squeeze hands and Marianne manages a smile.

EXT. PARKING LOT - BARBARA BUSH HIGH - DAY

Marianne gives Micah a strictly PG-rated kiss against his

car. They're nauseatingly wholesome.

INT. FRONT OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Olive is sitting in the office, dressed just as slutty as the

day before. A RED "A" sewn onto her top.

Marianne is behind the desk, sharpening pencils. After each

one, she observes the point with a scary satisfaction.

They exchange a few hateful glances at each other.

Mrs. Griffin pokes her head out of her office.

Olive, in no mood for this, drags herself up dramatically and

follows Mrs. Griffin into --

INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mrs. Griffin sits behind her desk and Olive sits opposite

her.

Mrs. Griffin shifts uncomfortably in her chair. There's

something a little unnerving about this kid's awareness.

Mrs. Griffin rolls her eyes.

Olive assesses this statement from her.

She winks at her.

Mrs. Griffin digs in her purse and pulls out a handful of

CONDOMS. Feigning excitement --

Olive sees that Mrs. Griffin is genuinely concerned.

Olive starts to confess, but then just takes the rubbers and

puts them in her own purse.

Mrs. Griffin smiles at Olive as she leaves.

INT. FRONT OFFICE - BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Marianne is talking to Micah, who seems distressed. He rubs

his eyes, like he's been crying. Olive is surprised to see

him there.

She gives him a reassuring smile and he walks into her

office.

Marianne gives her a `go away' look.

Marianne begins crying.

She begins sobbing uncontrollably. Olive, not sure what to

do, goes around the counter and hugs her. Marianne just

cries on her shoulder.

Olive didn't expect this embrace to last this long.

Into Olive's shoulder --

Marianne pulls away and wipes tears from her eyes.

This triggers even more wails from Marianne , who grabs Olive

and squeezes her tightly.

Olive is really confused by this display and is about to say

something snide, but thinks better of it and replies with a

very heartfelt --

Marianne pulls away again and manages to smile at her,

warmly.

INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Marianne, angry as hell, stomps through the hall with hatred

burning in her eyes and coursing through her veins.

Marianne stops in front of Olive and slaps her so hard that

people in the hallways stop, dead in their tracks.

It's the slap heard `round the school.

INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

Olive bursts into Mrs. Griffin's office. Tear-streaked, Mrs.

Griffin is packing her things into a cardboard box. It's as

if her world has just collapsed.

Olive starts to say something, but Mrs. Griffin can't even

look at her.

She throws a framed photo of her and Mr. Griffin into the

box. It shatters. Mrs. Griffin falls apart.

Olive starts to say something again, but she doesn't know

what to say, so she sheepishly turns to leave.

EXT. BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

The Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the school,

with a lot of other kids (and some parents), waving signs on

wooden stakes that say things like:

EXPEL OLIVE!

SCHOOLS ARE FOR LEARNING, NOT FOR WHORING

OLIVE PENDERGHAST IS A WHORE

Rhi is among them, as riled up as any.

The scene is a maelstrom of anger and piety.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Olive laughs.

INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY

Olive enters a Catholic Church. It's empty, but there are a

few CANDLES burning. She sees the CONFESSIONAL BOOTH and

makes a beeline toward it.

She takes a deep breath and enters.

INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

She sits down and begins to talk to the screen.

There's a long silence. Olive tears up and wipes them away.

She looks through the screen. There's no one there.

She throws the curtain to the booth open and stomps out.

EXT. CATHEDRAL PARKING LOT - DAY

Olive, upset at herself, gets into her car and drives off.

But just a few blocks down the street to --

EXT. PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

She parks her car and gets out to try a different

denomination.

INT. CHURCH OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Olive enters to find a SWEET, PORTLY RECEPTIONIST (50's)

searching through RELIGIOUS CLIP-ART on her COMPUTER,

attempting to find the perfect image for the church

newsletter.

The lady smiles, acknowledging Olive.

For her own entertainment, Olive matches the receptionist's

enthusiasm level.

The receptionist joyfully snatches up the phone.

She listens and then hangs up.

She winks at the receptionist and enters --

INT. ASSOCIATE PASTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

ASSOCIATE PASTOR DON (40's) is a gangly, unattractive -

borderline creepy - man. He invites Olive to have a seat.

He extends his hand, which she shakes politely.

Don seems taken aback by the question.

At that moment, Olive looks at his desk and sees a FRAMED

FAMILY PHOTO. Smiling big are Associate Pastor Don, his

wife, A WOMAN WITH A SMILE THE SIZE OF MONTANA and his lovely

MARIANNE BRYANT.

She jumps up from her chair and recoils at the sight of the

picture and the stupid mistake she made by coming there.

Backing up toward the door.

She bolts from his office.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Olive speaks into her webcam --

INT. BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Marianne, excitedly, runs over to Olive who is just getting

to school and throws her arms around her.

Marianne can't seem to break the embrace and Olive just goes

with it.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Olive sits in class. Marianne passes a note back to her.

Olive reads it. It says: Hey girlie! You wanna hang out

after school today? Kisses! Marianne

Marianne looks back and Olive gives her the thumbs up.

Across the room, Rhi sees this exchange and sneers.

INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - LATER

Marianne is working with her partner, Evan. She turns to

Olive behind them and makes a gagging signal behind his back

and laughs silently.

Olive, unaware of how to respond, gives another thumbs up.

INT. HOME EC CLASSROOM - LATER

Olive sees Marianne come into class, tear-streaked. She runs

over to Olive and again throws her arms around her.

Olive just holds her new friend, as she had the day before.

Olive guides Marianne's head back to her shoulder.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Marianne's boyfriend, Micah, writhes in pain on a hospital

bed, clutching his crotch. His worried MOTHER (40's) is

beside him, clutching her chest with one hand and trying to

soothe him with the other.

A DOCTOR enters, with a satisfied smile and a diagnosis.

Micah and his mother both look up in shock. His mother takes

both of her hands and begins slapping him, uncontrollably.

Micah, in pain from the burning sensation and his mother's

hands flying at astonishing speed shouts out:

His mother's face fills with satisfaction.

INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Micah's mother is on her cell phone.

She folds her phone up and slips it into her purse.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The woman on the other end of the phone -- A WOMAN WITH A

SMILE THE SIZE OF MONTANA -- who we've seen in the Bryant

family photo, hangs up. Only this time, her smile is a

disgusted grimace.

She picks up the phone and dials a number. She is,

animatedly, talking to the person on the other end of the

line, while Olive narrates.

INT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY

Marianne is on the phone, listening, with mouth agape.

Undoubtedly, she's just heard from her mother that her

boyfriend has chlamydia.

She screams so loud that Mrs. Griffin comes out of her

office, a panicked expression on her face.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Seething, Marianne's mother says into the phone --

She hears a slam and then a dial tone.

INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Marianne clutches the phone in the cradle with enough force

that it looks like the receiver will shatter in her hands.

Mrs. Griffin looks worried.

Like a teapot about to start expelling steam, Marianne

quivers in rage. Finally, at boiling point, she shouts --

But her long string of profanities is muffled by the long

ringing of the school bell. Mrs. Griffin is taken aback by

Marianne's umbrage.

As we saw before --

INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Marianne, angry as hell, stomps through the hall with hatred

burning in her eyes and coursing through her veins.

Marianne stops in front of Olive and slaps her so hard that

people in the hallways stop, dead in their tracks.

Rhi, who was loading books in her locker, sees this and

happily slams her locker shut. Breezing past her --

But Rhi keeps on walking.

EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY

Micah's on his cell phone, anxiously talking to someone -

checking every few seconds to see if his mom is on her way

out.

There's a dial tone.

INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mrs. Griffin has just hung up on her teenage lover and begins

freaking out. She grabs a cardboard box and begins throwing

items into it.

Olive bursts into Mrs. Griffin's office and sees Mrs. Griffin

packing her things.

As we saw before --

Olive starts to say something, but Mrs. Griffin can't even

look at her.

She throws a framed photo of her and Mr. Griffin into the

box. It shatters. Mrs. Griffin falls apart.

Olive starts to say something again, but she doesn't know

what to say, so she sheepishly turns to leave --

-- and then feels awkward.

This makes Mrs. Griffin cry even harder. She attempts to

pull herself together.

Olive looks at her, quizzically.

Olive puts two and two together in her head. She gasps a

little louder than she planned.

Mrs. Griffin walks over and locks her office door. She

fights back more tears, as she tries to explain to Olive.

Mrs. Griffin stops talking and waits for Olive to speak.

Olive gives her a reassuring smile, steps up to the plate and

offers up a solution.

Olive looks at her, puzzled by her knowledge.

She begins to weep.

Olive puts her hand on Mrs. Griffin's shoulder.

Mrs. Griffin grabs Olive and cries on her.

Olive strokes her guidance counselor's hair.

She strokes her hair.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into the webcam --

EXT. PLAYGROUND - YEARS BEFORE

Two LITTLE 5 YEAR OLD GIRLS (Olive and Rhiannon) chase a

LITTLE BOY all over the playground, desperate to kiss him.

They plot and plan to corner him, but he's just too fast.

Rhiannon finally catches him and kiss him on the cheek.

Repulsed, he wipes his face.

Rhiannon and Olive high five each other.

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

Olive eats her lunch and yuks it up with a table full of

guys. Rhiannon sits at a different table, mostly comprised

of girls, and glares at her from across the room.

The bell rings and the students begin getting up and making

their way toward the exit.

Anson (who we saw earlier with Rhiannon in the hallways)

approaches Olive.

Olive smiles sweetly at him.

Olive walks off

INT. RED LOBSTER - NIGHT

Olive and Anson sit in a booth at a dimly-lit RED LOBSTER.

Olive looks beautiful. The `A' on her shirt is sequined.

A SERVER appears with their LOBSTER. Anson is an odd shade

of green from Olive's little science lesson.

The server leaves them and Olive digs in. Anson is feeling

nauseous and can't touch his.

From across the restaurant, a PARADE OF SERVERS enters from

the back, enthusiastically clapping and holding a cupcake.

Leading the brigade is Meerkat Todd, who's wearing a RED FOAM

LOBSTER HAT.

With as much spirit, as he has as a meerkat --

He leads them through to another part of the restaurant.

They land at the table of the birthday girl. Olive cranes

her neck to see --

Rhiannon, miserable of course, sitting with her parents at a

table in the next room. Olive immediately becomes uneasy.

Olive is visibly squirming in her seat.

The whole place applauds, unenthusiastically. Anson sees

Olive's discomfort.

He gestures for the server who appears.

Even more confused, the server obliges and gives them their

check.

She pulls it out and hands it to the waitress, who leaves.

Olive suddenly becomes self-conscious and a little bit

pissed.

The server reappears with the check.

The sever smiles and leaves them again.

They duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down,

but Olive can't resist the urge to look up and see if

Rhiannon sees them.

She does.

Olive and Rhiannon make eye contact. Whereas, Olive looks

remorseful, Rhiannon looks like she's just been stabbed in

the back -- which she has.

The Abernathys see her, as well, and wave. It's painfully

obvious to Olive that Rhi hasn't told her parents about their

differences. She starts to go over, but Rhiannon's face is

turning vermillion in anger. Olive just waves, sheepishly

and leaves with Anson.

I/E. ANSON'S CAR - RED LOBSTER PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Olive's face is painted with guilt. She feels like shit, but

doesn't want to externalize it.

Anson puts his hand on her knee.

Olive manages a smile. He reaches into his pocket and pulls

out a $500 GIFT CERTIFICATE to ANTHROPOLOGIE and hands it to

her.

Olive is disappointed, but tries not to show it.

Snapping out of her guilt.

He leans over and kisses her. She pushes him off.

But he's kissing her again, a little too forcibly. She

pushes him off again.

He takes off his shirt.

She gets out of the car. He rolls down the window.

He drives off, leaving her outside in the parking lot.

As luck would have it, Meerkat Todd, is coming out the back

exit. He sees her and gives her a surprised, toothy grin.

Tears begin to glisten in Olive's eyes.

Todd walks over and puts his arm around her and leads her to

his car. He opens the door for her and she sits down.

I/E. MEERKAT TODD'S CAR - NIGHT

Olive is trying to pull herself together but she can't stop

crying as Todd drives her home.

Todd doesn't know what to say to her. Finally --

She stops crying.

She smiles through her tears.

Olive's laughter turns to rage.

He stops the car. They're at her house.

There's an awkward moment between them.

Despite the fact that this is positively the most romantic

moment of her young life, Olive looks down.

He holds out his hand and she takes it.

He smiles his goofy grin and she embraces him. She hops out

of the car and goes to her front door.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Into her webcam --

INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Filling the frame, a GOSSIPY GIRL in braces says --

We spin around to see Olive's stunned reaction.

The reality of the situation begins to weigh on her.

Defeated, Olive makes her way through the crowded halls.

INT. STUFFY OLD HOUSE IN MISSISSIPPI - DAY

Micah, beyond miserable, sits between his STERN GRANDPARENTS,

who read the Bible to him.

Micah settles in for a very long visit.

INT. UNDER THE BLEACHERS - GYM - DAY

Where they had previously met, Olive pleads with Evan.

He walks off, leaving her alone.

INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

Olive waits for Mrs. Griffin's response. There's a long

moment of contemplation on Mrs. Griffin's part. Then --

They're locked in a Mexican standoff.

Furious, Olive throws the door open and exits.

INT. MR. GRIFFIN'S CLASSROOM - DAY

Mr. Griffin is erasing the blackboard, when Olive storms into

the room.

Shocked, Mr. Griffin drops the eraser.

The gravity of what she's just done sinks in and she

stumbles.

Not knowing what to say, she runs from his classroom.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Olive is mirthless, as she proceeds with her story.

She contemplates this.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

As we saw before, Olive sits and plays `CONNECT FOUR' with

Mr. Griffin, at his desk. Both are looking beaten down and

very depressed and their minds are on everything but the

game.

Mr. Griffin puts his hand on Olive's.

Olive gets a tear in her eyes. She puts a RED CHIP in at the

top and loses the game. She reaches over and presses the

lever, causing all of the chips to fall on his desk.

THE JENGA SET-UP

There's a ridiculously tall tower of blocks and they all fall

down.

He rakes the chips and the game into his own cardboard box,

full of his things.

He smiles and she hugs him -- intensely, tears quickly

welling up in her eyes.

They just hold each other. Finally, Mr. Griffin pulls away

and takes his things and starts to leave. But then he turns

and says --

They share one last, pained smile and he leaves.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Hearfelt, into the webcam --

She wipes away a tear, pulls herself together.

EXT. BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

As we saw before --

The Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the school,

with a lot of other kids (and some parents), waving signs on

wooden stakes that say things like:

EXPEL OLIVE!

SCHOOLS ARE FOR LEARNING, NOT FOR WHORING

OLIVE PENDERGHAST IS A WHORE

Rhi is among them, as riled up as any.

Olive steps out of the school to see the demonstration. her

jaw drops.

Things have gotten WAY too out of hand.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Olive cries on her bed, clutching her teddy bear. Rosemary

listens, as a good mother does.

Olive gives her a suspicious look.

Ewwww!

I did. I got around. Before I met

your father, I was a garden variety

floozy.

Why are you telling me this?

Because I endured a similar

lynching because of a certain

dalliance.

I promise that it was no worse than

Marianne Bryant's attack on me.

Wanna bet? It was her mother.

Wait, what?

Yep. Don Bryant and I got caught

in a very compromising position in

the locker room during a basketball

game.

That's disgusting! He's

disgusting!

He wasn't back then. He was

actually pretty handsome. All I'm

saying is that MAYBE the reason

that Bryant girl is going after you

is because her mother told her

about me.

So, the sins of the mother are

revisited on the daughter.

There's something else you should

know. This is hard to say but --

Don Bryant is your father.

Marianne is your sister.

Olive turns white.

Olive punches her mother on the arm, who's laughing

hysterically.

They embrace and Olive gets an idea.

Rosemary looks slightly concerned by the grin on Olive's

face.

INT. GYM - DAY

We join a pep rally, already in progress.

The DANCE TEAM attempts to rile up the school with a rousing

rendition of Michael Jackson's `BAD.'

In the stands, Rhi sits with Marianne and Nina.

She extends her palms to Nina and Rhi, who both slap them.

Marianne puts her arm around Rhi.

Marianne nods in agreement, however Rhi is confused.

Rhiannon looks at her new best friends, who just smile at

her.

The song ends and there's a drum roll.

Marianne puts her hand firmly on Rhi's knee.

Rhi puts her head down.

The drum roll ends and Meerkat Todd bounces out in costume.

He jumps around enthusing the student body --

But then he goes out of the gym and reenters pushing a

DUMPSTER.

The familiar chords of the James Bond theme `Nobody Does It

Better' plays from the band.

Meerkat Todd opens the lid of the dumpster and Olive, dressed

in a glittery and slinky RED DRESS, with a BOA draped around

her bare shoulder, pops up and croons with a handheld mic and

slightly different lyrics:

Todd lifts Olive out of the dumpster and she sings her ass

off - and she's quite good.

She winks at the audience. The guys begin to wolf whistle

and howl at her sheer brilliance.

She begins to rub her hands seductively over Meerkat Todd's

furry costume, eventually unzipping it and taking off the

head to reveal:

BLUE DEVIL TODD! The crowd goes wild.

She saunters over to Rhi and kisses her on the cheek, leaving

a big, red lip mark.

She sees that Gibbons is not amused, but that doesn't stop

her.

She walks over to a couple of HORN PLAYERS, and runs her

fingers seductively over their (uh) instruments.

The crowd goes wild - some appalled, but most enthused.

Olive sashays through the crowd as the MALE TEENS scream and

stuff money down her bodice.

The song ends and Olive takes Blue Devil Todd's hand.

There are audible gasps, but excitement nonetheless.

Gibbons angrily storms over and takes the microphone.

She plods out, triumphantly.

INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DUSK

The sun is setting as Olive speaks into her webcam. But this

time, we're not seeing it through the lens, but from a

different point in the room.

All of a sudden -- from outside and downstairs --

James' `LAID' begins to play.

Olive goes over to the window and sees Todd below, holding up

a BOOMBOX (a la John Cusack) and there's a RIDE-ON LAWN MOWER

(a la Patrick Dempsey) behind him.

Upon seeing this, she bursts into laughter, but it couldn't

be more romantic.

Olive can't get the smile off of her face as she goes back to

the camera.

We see her through the lens.

She turns the camera off.

EXT. THE PENDERGHAST HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Olive runs out of the house and tackles him, kissing him -

in the front yard,

in broad daylight,

for the world to see.

OVER THE END CREDITS...

EXT. GYM - NIGHT

The basketball game is going on to an almost empty gymnasium.

We see, from the perspective of their computer screens,

various reactions to Olive's webcast --

-- A proud Brandon watches from a hotel room. A MUSCULAR

BLACK GUY in a towel comes up behind him and kisses his neck.

-- The Abernathys watch with the same demented glee they

derive from watching anything.

-- Mrs. Griffin watches with the face of a person who's been

found out and who's days are numbered. They are.

-- Rhi seems contemplative. Maybe it's because she's been in

love with Olive since grade school. Duh.

-- Evan, the fat kid, is doing jumping jacks while watching.

-- Melanie Bostic (the host of the party) watches with a

group of girls.

-- Marianne feels regret. But a little bit impressed.

-- Mr. Griffin is proud of her.

-- Micah watches in his dark bedroom.

-- Rosemary and Dill are too busy making out to watch.

-- Anson has a jar of vaseline and is ready to jerk off, but

is upset that she isn't `exposing herself' in the

aforementioned way.

EXT. THE PENDERGHAST HOUSE - HOURS LATER

Olive and Todd are still kissing on the lawn underneath the

stars.
