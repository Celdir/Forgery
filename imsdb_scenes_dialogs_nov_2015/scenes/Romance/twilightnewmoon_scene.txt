CREDITS OVER:

A FULL MOON FILLS THE FRAME -- Luminous, tinged with gold.

Slowly, a penumbral shadow begins to spread across the

moon's surface, darkening it from left to right...

... until the moon is enveloped in shadow; a new moon...

which disappears into the darkness.

OVER BLACK - A RUFFLED TULIP appears, isolated against the

blackness.

HOLD ON the tulip as the background FADES UP around it to

reveal we're now in --

EXT. FOREST - ECU ON THE TULIP - DAY

It's surrounded by the dark, lush, greenery of the forest

floor.

SUDDENLY A FOOT SLAMS DOWN next to the tulip, nearly

crushing it. As the foot immediately lifts off again, it

grazes the tulip, knocking its petals off --

ON THE RUNNING PAIR OF FEET

They abruptly change direction. Race on. INCLUDE BELLA

SWAN, desperately searching the woods -- SHORT, SURREAL CUTS

of her frenetic quest --

Ahead, through the darkness of the thick forest, she SEES

SUNLIGHT; a clearing. She hurtles toward it --

EXT. MEADOW - DAY

-- as Bella bursts into the sunlight. It's the meadow where

Edward revealed his skin in the sun. But he's not here now.

Instead, Bella SEES --

ACROSS THE MEADOW -- AN OLD WOMAN, white hair framing her

withered face. Bella's eyes widen with surprise as she

recognizes --

GRAN looks as surprised as Bella. Bella smiles and waves,

as does Gran. Bella starts toward her but --

She spins to the voice behind her to SEE --

EDWARD emerge from the forest, his alabaster skin in sharp

contrast to the shadows. She beams at him, relieved, in

love... until he moves to edge of the shade, inches from

sun's rays --

But Edward just smiles and steps into the sunlight.

Sunbeams SHATTER off his skin like a thousand rainbow

shards, as if he were made of diamonds. An awesome sight.

JUMP CUT TO: Edward now inches from Bella, still glistening,

entrancing her. She wraps an arm around his waist, then

arranges her face into a calm expression. They turn to --

Gran, whose expression is calm, too. Gran's arm is

extended, as if she also holds someone.

JUMP CUT TO: Bella and Edward, only feet from Gran now.

Bella's about to present Edward, but then SEES that --

Gran mimics Bella's movement exactly. With growing horror,

Bella reaches out to Gran... and touches glass!

PULL BACK TO FIND Gran is now surrounded by a GILDED FRAME.

It's a MIRROR, mounted on a wall with wallpaper reflecting a

surreal dreamlike version of the forest behind Bella.

-- as she realizes that's not Gran; it's Bella, sixty-five

years older.

Bella spins to her perfect, eternally 17-year-old Edward.

He takes her now WRINKLED, age-spotted hand. Kisses it.

Then he leans in very close to her 83-YEAR-OLD FACE and

whispers into her ear --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

ON BELLA - her eyes snap open. She lies atop her bed. A

book, "ROMEO AND JULIET," lays open on her chest. Bella

sits up, the dream still weighing on her...

INCLUDE HER ROOM, cluttered with pictures of Edward, of the

Cullens; memorabilia of all things Edward. A KNOCK on the

door. CHIEF CHARLIE SWAN enters carrying two gifts, one

wrapped, one not.

He hands it to her. It's a digital camera.   Bella's

pleased, despite herself.

Bella opens the wrapped gift to reveal a SCRAPBOOK.

Bella races to the mirror, searches her face.

EXT. FORKS HIGHWAY - DAY

An AERIAL VIEW of this lush, green, overcast landscape; the

rainy world that is Forks. FIND Bella's old truck as it

lumbers down the two-lane highway...

EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Bella climbs out of her truck, shouldering her book bag.

She looks around the parking lot, seeking Edward --

She turns as MIKE, ERIC, ANGELA and JESSICA approach.

She pushes Angela to the others; they arrange themselves --

Jessica scoffs, Angela points her camera at Bella; Mike and

Eric joust -- Bella aims --

FULL FRAME - THE CAMERA'S DIGITAL SCREEN

It FREEZES on them, fun, delightfully carefree... but when

the camera lowers, their playfulness has dissipated as they

see someone behind Bella. She turns to see --

EDWARD climbing out of his silver Volvo.

The friends, uncomfortable, move off --

-- But Bella doesn't register their tone. She's transfixed

by Edward who approaches, eyes never leaving hers. He

reaches her, washing away all her concerns --

-- except that one.    Her face falls.

Then he kisses her, tenderly, adoringly. She kisses him

back... despite their restraint, the passion mounts... until

he pulls away. As always, both are left wanting more.

Edward nods toward the school building --

Catching their breath, they start toward school... but

Edward stops, hearing something in his mind. Irritated.

JACOB BLACK, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long,

black ponytail wagging. He looks 18 due to his tall,

muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy,

still catching up to his growth spurt. He nods to Edward,

who moves off to the side but eyes them.

He pulls from his coat a small woven DREAMCATCHER, feathers

dangling from it. He hands it to her.

The bell RINGS. Jacob gives Edward an amiable smile, with

just a hint of snark.

They share a tight smile.   Bella intercedes, squeezing

Jacob's arm.

Edward guides her away.   As they walk off --

She just laughs, but Edward looks back at Jacob with

resentment. Jacob holds his gaze.

INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

Edward and Bella enter the double doors -- suddenly a small,

wrapped gift appears in Bella's face. ALICE presents it.

-- Alice whispers in her ear as she hugs Bella --

Over Alice's shoulder, Bella sees JASPER, keeping his

distance. He offers her a pleasant nod. She tries to hide

Alice's present, hoping no one noticed --

Alice hugs her again and races off before she can change her

mind. Which is when Bella realizes --

He offers an apologetic bow before Alice drags him away.

CLOSE ON A T.V. MONITOR - Zeffirelli's `68 "Romeo and

Juliet" plays. The suicide scene.

PULL BACK TO INCLUDE --

INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

The room is dark as we PAN OVER the class, some students

entertained, some moved, Mike trying not to fall asleep.

The teacher, MR. BERTY, mouths every word --

FIND Edward and Bella in the back of the room, desks pushed

together, whisper-talking.

Bella sits back, knowing she's trapped.    He kisses her hand.

He turns her wrist over, runs his hand over the horseshoe

shaped SCAR on her forearm.

FLASHPOP TO "Twilight" - In the ballet studio, JAMES grabs

Bella's arm and BITES --

BACK ON EDWARD - pained.

Mr. Berty just looks at him, then moves off, intimidated --

Bella is too concerned to be amused.

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Lights glow from inside the beautiful house.

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

ON AN 18TH CENTURY OIL PAINTING, depicting Grecian figures in

swirling robes writhing among pillars and balconies. In a

high balcony, FOUR CALM FIGURES look down upon the bacchanal;

two black haired, one snowy white, one golden haired...

INCLUDE -- Edward and Bella (now wearing a green dress).

She studies the painting - the largest on a wall crowded

with pictures. The other walls are towering bookshelves.

Bella examines the golden haired "God."

PUSH IN ON THE PAINTING, THE FOURSOME

Their features begin to fill in, become real - THEY COME TO

LIFE in the painting, turning to leave the balcony through

an archway. We FOLLOW THEM into --

INT. A CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL - DAY

It's centuries old, its marble cracked and weathered. The

open oculus in the domed ceiling is the only source of

light. The room is empty but for three large wooden chairs

and half a dozen VAMPIRES in elegant 18th century attire.

Two of the Volturi, MARCUS and CAIUS, take their seats,

Carlisle stands beside them. ARO moves to the center of the

room where we REVEAL --

A ROGUE VAMPIRE is on his knees. He looks feral compared to

the others, and terrified. Aro puts his hands on either

side of the Rogue's face. Compassion?

Aro then slowly, dispassionately, RIPS THE ROGUE'S HEAD OFF.

Two Volturi Guards (FELIX and DEMETRI) appear on either

side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and

tosses it aside. Aro calmly sits as the others tear the

Rogue limb from limb. Carlisle has to look away...

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

-- as Bella spins on Edward --

OFF BELLA'S FACE - FLASHPOPS:

-- ON ALL THREE EVIL VAMPIRES, James, VICTORIA, the dread-

locked LAURENT (from "Twilight")

-- CLOSE ON VICTORIA - fire-red hair, burgundy red eyes,

feral, vicious grin (from "Twilight")

BACK ON BELLA AND EDWARD

Bella looks up at him, pained.

He laughs, amused.   She's decidedly not.

-- but he stops, smiles, hearing something in his mind --

-- as the door bursts open and Alice dances in.

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Alice tugs Bella and Edward to the top of the landing, then

skips down the stairs. They look down into --

THE LIVING ROOM - Hundreds of pink candles and rose-filled

crystal bowls. ROSALIE, ESME, EMMETT, Carlisle, Jasper and

Alice look up at her, all of them stunningly beautiful.

Bella would love to disappear, but Edward leads her down to --

THE LIVING ROOM -- where Esme and Carlisle hug Bella warmly.

FLASH!   Alice has snapped a picture of Bella with them.

Emmett moves to Edward's side.   Nudges him.

Bella caught that.    Edward elbows him sharply to shut up.

Rosalie steps up.    Shoves a silver package at Bella.

She walks away, bored. Bella has to smile.     She sees Jasper

across the room. They wave to each other.

Edward pulls Bella into an embrace, they look deeply into

one another's eyes. FLASH!

Alice drags Bella over to a table piled with elaborately

wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates.

The others crowd around... Jasper somewhat away. Bella, no

fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find

an empty car-radio box.

Alice hands her a box.   Bella starts to open it, but --

CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGER - A single drop of deep red blood

appears.

Bella thinks little of it, but then HEARS a disturbing,

grisly SNARL -- she looks up just as --

BELLA'S POV - JASPER lunges toward her!    Teeth bared, eyes

beyond reason --

-- Edward FLINGS Bella behind his own body, causing her to

CRASH into the table, plates shattering as --

-- Jasper SLAMS into Edward; sounds like boulders colliding.

-- Edward pushes him, hard; Jasper SAILS backward, hitting

the wall. But he RICOCHETS off it and comes back at Bella.

-- Emmett and Carlisle TACKLE Jasper from the side, dragging

him to the ground -- Alice helps hold him down --

... But she stops, her head suddenly jerking toward Bella.

Then everybody's eyes snap toward Bella as they catch the

overwhelming scent --

ON BELLA - lying amid the shards of broken china. She looks

at her arm, seeing now - it's been slashed by plate shards;

bright red blood pulses out of her, pooling. She looks up --

BELLA'S POV - THE CULLENS (SLOW MOTION)

All of them now, including Edward (but not Carlisle) stare

down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes. Six suddenly

ravenous vampires...

SLOW MOTION ABRUPTLY ENDS as -- Carlisle jumps to Bella's

side. Edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and

stands between her and the others.

Emmett reins himself in, elbows Rosalie. They drag the

snarling Jasper out. Esme holds her nose, politely exits

with the others. Alice looks at Bella, apologetic --

She slips out the door.   Edward's still on guard as Carlisle

examines Bella's arm.

He moves to pick her up, but his eyes dart to the blood.

Edward looks from him to Bella. Then steps back, allowing

Carlisle to lift Bella and carry her to the kitchen. But

just before the kitchen door closes, Bella sees Edward's

agonized face. He turns away, unable to meet her eyes...

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Bella sits in a chair opposite Carlisle who mops up her

blood as he removes glass shards from her arm. He drops one

into a bowl; PLINK. She tries not to look at the blood.

Off Bella, no, not ever...

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT

A large red bow hangs from the new stereo in the dashboard.

Edward drives in silence. Bella studies him. Finally --

Edward doesn't respond, just pulls the truck into --

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE/INT. BELLA'S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

The truck stops.   Beat.

He faces forward again, jaw tight, mind working, tormented.

She reaches for his hand --

-- he subtly moves his hand away from hers.

He climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side

door for her. She climbs out. He looks down at her face -

he softens as he takes it in. Puts a hand on her cheek.

He lifts her face to his, and kisses her. He begins

carefully, gently... but it changes, he becomes urgent, with

an almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye.

Abruptly, he pulls away. With a last look, he turns walks

off into the night. Off Bella...

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ON A PHOTO - as a printer spits it out. It's the pic Alice

took of Bella and Edward's embrace. Bella, troubled, puts

it in her scrapbook, her bandaged finger running over it.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

"Romeo and Juliet" lessons are on the board. Everyone's

scribbling essays. Bella glances at Edward's desk; empty --

FLASHPOP TO -- (previous scene in truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S

EYES, hard, turning away from her...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

Bella sits with Jessica, Angela, Eric and Mike. They joke,

throw things. Bella's distracted, looking-out for Edward.

FLASHPOP TO -- (scene in the truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S HAND

moving away from hers...

BACK ON BELLA'S WORRIED FACE, off which we go to --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY

PAN the photos on the wall. INCLUDE EDWARD who studies

them, his expression grim. He looks down at Bella's

SCRAPBOOK to SEE the photo of him and Bella. He pulls it

out, takes a closer look...

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

ON BELLA THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of her truck as she pulls

into the driveway. She climbs out, heads toward the house

but stops, relief washing over her --

He stands by the house. Bella hurries toward him, but slows

when she sees his cold, distant face; an unreadable mask.

Edward gently takes her hand. Dread fills her, but she lets

him guide her toward the woods...

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Edward stops by a fallen tree.        Turns to Bella.

Bella reels, trying to take this in.       Finally --

Bella is stung, as if slapped.

She steps back.   Trying to understand this.

He softens ever-so-slightly.

Desperation wells up in her, overwhelming dignity.

He sees she won't let go easily.    Takes a breath.       His face

turns cold again.

Bella looks at him.   His hard face.   His resolve.

Tears sting Bella's eyes. This can't be happening. He

steps forward... kisses her forehead. She closes her eyes.

And here, for the first time, we SEE how truly agonizing

this really is for Edward. But Bella doesn't see.

By the time she opens her eyes - he's gone.    She spins --

She SEES a LEAF FLITTERING to the ground where he grazed a

branch; the only indication of his direction. She hurries

down the path, then runs --

-- and she keeps running, going deeper into the woods...

A SERIES OF QUICK, SURREAL SHOTS - TIME LAPSING

Bella runs through the woods, searching, reminiscent of her

opening dream. It gets darker and darker, until we're deep into

night -- HEAR Bella's sharp desperate BREATHS --

BELLA TRIPS. Falls to the damp forest floor.        She looks up,

the trees spinning around her...

STAY ON BELLA - NIGHT - AS HOURS PASS

She remains on the ground. Curls into a ball.       Darkness

shrouding her. Devastation paralyzing her.

ECU ON HER FACE - numb. HEAR the faint sound of her name

being called in the distance. A search party. She's too

wrecked to respond.

Rain begins to pour; she doesn't register it....

SERIES OF SCENES END ON -- BELLA, lying there, dazed. She

begins to HEAR an animal SNUFFLING. It gets closer. It

sounds large. Scary. Then she hears a whisper --

She lifts her head, looks for Edward... but SEES something

else instead --

BELLA'S POV - A DARK SHAPE, huge, black. Nearing. Its EYES

reflect light for a split second; they're inhuman, savage.

Bella, terrified, manages to DRAG herself to a cluster of

trees. She squeezes between them. Breathing hard. She

closes her eyes, trying to disappear...

INT. WOODS - LATER NIGHT

Bella's eyes open to find herself FLOATING several feet

above the ground. Trees pass by. She's being carried...

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Half the town is gathered - a tired rescue party that

includes Mike Newton and Jacob Black.

Charlie, beside himself with worry, pores over a map with

BILLY BLACK (in wheelchair) and Quileute HARRY CLEARWATER,

46, (dark braids, stout, protruding belly, kind face).

Harry puts a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder.

Charlie is glad for the comfort of his two friends.

Charlie spins to where Jacob points --

THEIR POV - THE EDGE OF THE WOODS

SAM ULEY, 20, emerges, a tall, strong Quileute Indian with

cropped hair and a fierce expression. He's carrying Bella.

Charlie bolts to her; he's never moved faster in his life.

He wraps his arms around Bella, lifting her from Sam's arms.

Charlie carries Bella to the house, cradling her. Harry and

Billy give Sam a nod of praise and gratitude. But Sam backs

away, avoiding any accolades.

ON JACOB - jogging alongside Charlie, peering at Bella with

worry. Then Jacob slows, feeling eyes on his back... he

turns to SEE Sam Uley staring at him. Jacob, uncomfortable,

quickly looks away.

ON CHARLIE CARRYING BELLA up the stairs to the house --

Off her as Charlie carries her inside --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BED - Charlie lays Bella down and wraps

her in blankets...

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES ON BELLA

She's curled in a fetal position in the middle of the bed.

Then at its foot. Under the blankets. On top of them. In

various different arrangements. Meanwhile...

A BLACK LIQUID begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing

everything in the room. It rises up the sides of the bed,

higher and higher until it breaches the top of the bed and

begins to engulf Bella. Off her, submerged in blackness...

EXT.   BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY - A MONTH LATER

The leaves have turned red and orange.    SEE a FIGURE in the

upstairs window --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY

Bella sits in a rocking chair by the window. Her face

blank. Empty. STAY ON BELLA, unchanging - but THROUGH THE

WINDOW OUTSIDE, we SEE TIME LAPSING behind her --

OCTOBER -- Costumed kids appear in the yard, trick-or-

treating. DISSOLVE INTO...

NOVEMBER -- NEIGHBORS (BOB MARKS and his WIFE) bring Charlie

a turkey... they glance up at Bella's window with concern...

WINTER BEGINS -- the trees' branches are now bare...

DECEMBER -- Charlie drags a Christmas tree toward the house...

worry has taken its toll on him. But Bella remains

unchanged...

PAN the now blank walls of the exceedingly neat room; gone

are all traces of Edward...

... LAND ON the scrapbook which lies open; the photo of

Bella and Edward's embrace at the birthday party - gone.

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY

BELLA AT HER COMPUTER, typing an e-mail to Renee.

A SERIES OF TABLEAUS, DISSOLVING INTO ONE ANOTHER:

-- INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Bella sits on the couch, blank, as the rain pounds.    Charlie

watches her, concerned.

-- INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the darkness, Bella is curled up in a ball on her floor.

-- INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

Lunch. Bella sits alone, staring straight ahead. SEE

Jessica, Eric, Angela and Mike, watching her with concern.

Talking about her. She doesn't notice.

EXT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME - DAY

A one-story contemporary home, surrounded by snowy, barren

land and woods. Through a LARGE PICTURE WINDOW we SEE Alice

and Carlisle, arguing inside --

INT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME (CONTINOUS) - DAY

Alice faces off with Carlisle as the others watch on. Esme

desolate; Emmett blank. He sits next to Rosalie who seems

almost irritated. Jasper isolates himself in a corner.

Alice wraps an arm around Jasper, soothingly.

They all turn to Alice... a beat. She closes her eyes,

trying to get a lock on Edward -- PUSH IN ON ALICE as --

EXT. SOUTH AMERICA - ANDES (ALICE'S VISION) - DAY

(Visuals are jumpy, unclear) START HIGH ON A MOUNTAINTOP in

the middle of nowhere. SWOOP DOWN to its peak on which we

find EDWARD. Standing still, face agonized.

-- and suddenly, he starts running, like he's trying to

outrun his memories, faster and faster -- he races toward a

CLIFF; a RAVINE hundreds of feet below --

Edward doesn't slow, just blasts forward faster; then he

LEAPS off the cliff, FLOATING, but the pain stays with him --

ON EDWARD'S FEET landing hard on the other side of the

ravine - as they hit ground we --

CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGERS

-- as they hit computer keys --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

INCLUDE BELLA'S COMPUTER SCREEN, as she types...

Bella stops. A beat as she stares at her own words.   Then

she hits "select all" and "delete" --

ON THE COMPUTER - A BLANK DOCUMENT. She types: "Hi Mom,

things are great, grades are up. Hanging with friends.

Stop worrying. I'm fine."

Bella presses "send", and the cheery e-mail disappears.

Bella rises, returns to her rocking chair, staring out

desolately. PUSH PAST HER OUTSIDE...

AN UNKNOWN POV FROM THE WOODS - ON BELLA IN THE WINDOW

-- Someone's watching her, pacing menacingly, hungrily...

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella exits to find Charlie out by the street, stuffing

trash into the bins. He talks with neighbor, Bob Marks, who

also attends to his trash: two old, beat up motorcycles.

-- as Charlie watches Bella walk to her truck, head down.

Bob sees her, too --

Bella, in her own world, doesn't respond.   Bob gives Charlie

an understanding shrug and heads off.

ON BELLA as she opens her truck door.   Suddenly, it gets

slammed shut again by Charlie.

She looks away.   That's how it feels to her.

She nods.   Knows this all too well.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY

Bella drives, talking on her cell (hands-free, of course).

EXT. PORT ANGELES - MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Bella and Jessica exit the theater.   A MARQUEE behind them

bears the title of a ZOMBIE film.

Bella glances at her.

As Bella looks ACROSS THE STREET, time suddenly SLOWS --

BELLA'S POV - A DIVE BAR, "ONE EYED PETE'S" (SLOW MOTION)

-- FOUR ROUGH-LOOKING GUYS loiter out front next to their

motorcycles. They're in shadow, we can't see their faces.

OFF BELLA WE SMASH TO --

FLASHPOPS: Bella surrounded by FOUR GUYS ("Twilight");

Edward's Volvo skidding to a stop; Edward staring them down --

BACK ON BELLA, a chill going down her spine, FREEZING her as

she stares at the foursome across the street...

Then suddenly -- a pair of lips lean next to her ear --

She turns to find Edward standing next to her. Or so it

seems. But he's an illusion; an apparition - which becomes

clear when --

Jessica steps right into him, dissolving him to nothingness, and

TIME ABRUPTLY SPEEDS UP AGAIN --

Jessica pulls at her arm, but Bella shakes her off.

Much to Jessica's frustration, Bella begins to cross the

street toward the Guys, frightened but drawn.

The apparition of EDWARD REAPPEARS in her path this time.

She stops.

But when she steps backward, he fades. Testing her

hallucination, she strides forward again -- Edward's

apparition reappears, strides alongside her --

She's almost smiling as she reaches the Guys, finally able

to see them clearly -- and stops, realizing --

And with that.... Edward disappears.

Guy #2 pulls up right next to her on his motorcycle.

GUY #2 extends his hand to help her onto the bike.     She

hesitates.

Edward's apparition appears on the other side of the bike.

Bella looks at him with determination -- then climbs on to

the back of the bike --

The bike LURCHES forward, going way too fast. As the wind

blasts her hair back, she realizes this might have been a

mistake --

Guy #2 doesn't hear her, guns the engine, going faster --

BELLA'S POV - DIRECTLY AHEAD

Edward stands in road, directly in their path, more present,

more clear than ever. The bike's headlight illuminates him,

racing toward him --

The bike abruptly pulls up short.

Bella scrambles off, stumbling in the process.    Edward is

gone.

The four Guys then REV their bikes and PEEL out.    Bella

watches them go as Jessica storms up.

An angry Jessica charges off. Bella watches the motorcycles

disappear down the street as --

Off Bella, determination settling into her face...

EXT. JACOB BLACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella pulls up in her truck, a tarp covering something big

in the back. Jacob comes out of the house. A huge grin.

Bella hops out, Jacob gives her a hug.   Bella's surprised by

his affection, but doesn't mind.

Bella pulls the tarp back, revealing - her neighbor's two

dilapidated, rusting MOTORCYCLES.

Bella face spreads into something we haven't seen in a

while... a wide smile. As they pull the bikes off the

truck, they laugh and joke; it's as though Jacob has brought

Bella back to life. But --

UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND JACOB FROM A DISTANCE

-- someone's watching as the two of them wheel the bikes

into the garage. REVERSE on the watcher to discover --

EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS - SAM ULEY - SAME

Next to Sam stand two others, JARED, 17, and PAUL, 18. All

three have cropped hair, sleeveless shirts, cut-offs. It's

unsettling how they watch Bella and Jacob; the ferocity in

their eyes, the danger.

Sam turns; the others follow his lead. The three slink

soundlessly into the darkness of the woods...

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Two hikers, NATE and TIM, 20's, as they tromp through the

shadowy, mist-laden woods. Tim studies his IPhone GPS --

Tim hears a RUSTLE.    Stops.

RUSTLE. Nate stops. Then, from the opposite direction,

another RUSTLE. Then another, and another, from behind,

from in front. It's either more than one creature or it's

moving with extraordinary speed. The guys are terrified.

The guys, faced away from one another, search the trees.

STAY ON TIM as suddenly, there's an eerie SILENCE. Beat.

No answer.   He turns to find that Nate has vanished.

Nothing... then the RUSTLING starts again.       And intensifies.

Tim BOLTS! CLOSE ON TIM - tearing through the woods, too

scared to feel the branches SMACK him in the face. Breath

ragged, he looks over his shoulder --

TIM'S POV - BEHIND HIM - something gives chase, flattening

foliage and bending thin trees in its path. Tim runs harder --

TIM'S POV - UP AHEAD THROUGH THE TREES - THE HIGHWAY

A couple cars pass.    Civilization.   Safety.   Tim races for it --

EXT. HIGHWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Tim bursts from the tree-line, he's almost to the pavement,

he`s going to escape --

BAM! Something YANKS him out of frame at an unnatural

angle. His SCREAM is abruptly choked off, leaving nothing

but a disturbing silence...

INT. JACOB'S GARAGE - ANOTHER DAY

Motorcycle parts are spread out on blankets.    Jacob moves

among them excitedly, piecing them together.    Bella watches.

Bella abruptly sits up, starts to pull a tarp over the bikes.

QUIL ATEARA and EMBRY CALL enter, both 16. Quil is short,

stocky and feisty, with short hair. Embry is tall, thin and

laid back, with chin-length black hair.

They stop when they see Bella.        The two guys share a smile.

Bella rescues Jacob --

Embry chuckles, as well.

Quil makes a run at him, he dodges; a playful scuffle ensues.

Embry, amused, saunters over to Bella.

The scuffle continues.   Off Bella, enjoying them...

A SERIES OF SCENES...

INT. JACOB'S GARAGE - OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL DAYS

The bikes begin to take shape, the parts on the blanket thin

out.

Jacob clowns for Bella's amusement, pretends to skewer

himself with a pipe. She laughs.

He constantly touches her, playful, affectionate. It's

effortless in contrast to Edward's intense restraint. We

can see her spirits beginning to lift.

EXT. JACOB'S GARAGE - NIGHT

Bella and Jacob exit, make their way across the yard to her

truck. Bella seems lighter, happier than before.

He instantly regrets saying Edward's name as he sees it

crush her spirits. Off Bella, retreating into herself...

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (NIGHTMARE)

Bella TEARS through the forest, searching desperately. Then

she turns -- finds Edward a few yards away, his face cold.

She steps toward him -- but he BOLTS backward, suddenly

twenty yards away --

-- he rapidly retreats further until he disappears, leaving

Bella utterly alone, darkness closing in on her...

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bella SCREAMS in her sleep. The light turns on and Charlie

hurries to her side, gently shaking her awake.

Her eyes open, tears streaming down her cheeks. He doesn't

quite know what to do, so hands her a glass of water from

her bedside table. She sits up, sips. He pulls the

dreamcatcher from her bedpost.

She avoids his look.

Off Bella...

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY

Bella drives along the La Push cliffs. Jacob rides shotgun.

He studies a grease-blackened motorcycle crankshaft.

The second she says it, she regrets it -- off her --

FLASHPOP TO - THE MEADOW, Bella lying in the grass with

Edward ("Twilight"), flowers surrounding them.

BACK ON BELLA - her face falls.

He brings his easy smile and optimism to the rescue.

She smiles, grateful. Then she looks out the window at the

cliffs... and notices --

BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE BY THE CLIFF

FOUR MEN stand on the rocky ledge of the cliff (Sam, Jared,

Paul, and a fourth). They wear nothing but cut-off shorts.

They push each other, rough-housing.

Suddenly, two of the guys throw a struggling Jared over the

cliff! BELLA SLAMS on the brakes. Jumps out of the truck --

Jacob climbs out after her --

EXT. LA PUSH CLIFFS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Bella runs toward them.   But Jacob's laughter slows her.

BELLA'S POV - A DIVER (Paul) takes a running start and

FLINGS himself into the air, twisting and cartwheeling down.

Bella is intrigued, sees the potential for adrenaline - for

Edward.

There's that bitter edge again.   She looks at him.

Bella looks closer, SEES the fourth guy is Embry, hair now

shorn, thin frame filled out, laid back expression gone. It

pains Jacob to see him.

She sees he's unnerved, instinctively hugs him reassuringly.

Bella realizes she crossed a line and covers, playfully

shoving him. As they head to the truck, Bella looks back --

BELLA'S POV - ON SAM

-- but now he's looking directly at her. Then he turns and

DIVES over the edge, cutting a clean line into the water.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

Bella carries her tray to an empty table, but looks over at

Mike, Angela, Jessica and Eric. Bella takes a breath, then

casually joins them. They take note, but keep talking.

She's serious.    And a little scared.   Bella see that.

Everyone stares.    Did Bella just speak?

Now everyone's chilled.

As they continue, Angela mouths "thanks" to Bella. They

share a smile and join in, Bella becoming part of the group.

ECU ON JACOB AND BELLA'S FACES

-- just inches apart.

She's lying. PULL BACK to see she's straddling the now

completed motorcycle. Jacob stands next to her, holding the

bike up. There's an intimacy to their proximity. INCLUDE --

EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

The bike is aimed down a dirt road.     Jacob runs through the

instructions:

Bella nods.   Jacob grins... then KICK-STARTS the bike.

She does... the bike moves forward an inch -- Jacob

cautiously steps back. She moves forward another inch --

Bella turns to find the apparition of EDWARD standing next

to her. Her hand slips off the clutch, the bike BUCKS and

falls on top of her. Jacob quickly lifts it off her as the

apparition of Edward disappears.

Bella quickly rises and hops back on.

Jacob nods. Then kick-starts the bike again. She releases

the clutch and moves forward. Slowly at first -- EDWARD

reappears at her side, glowering.

She keeps going, a little faster. EDWARD appears on her left

now; she passes him. He reappears ahead; she passes.

ON BELLA'S FACE as the wind flings her hair back. She

gathers speed... and for a moment, experiences pure freedom,

exhilaration... then she sees Edward standing at the curve

in the road ahead, and realizes --

Jacob races toward her. She reaches the turn, doesn't bank,

goes straight... and flies right into a wall of trees.

As she lies on the ground dazed, Jacob hurries up.

She looks around for Edward.   He's gone.

Indeed, blood drips down her forehead. He pulls off his

shirt to mop it up. She shrinks away --

He bends over her, carefully tending her head. She finds

herself looking at him. His dark eyes, his bare chest and

smooth skin. He glances at her.

He's surprised; there's a moment between them.     He smiles.

He offers her a hand, helps her up.    She holds onto it,

alarmed.

He takes her hand from his forehead.   Holds it.   She tries

to pull it away.

The name stings her.   He takes both her hands now.

He takes this in, it's hard. A wave of something sweeps

over him. He sits back. Closes his eyes, takes a breath.

Off Jacob, rattled, and Bella, concerned...

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Bella does homework. Charlie watches a game.     She's on

edge. Anxious. HEAR A BEEEEP --

EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - ANOTHER DAY

Bella climbs out of her truck, SEES the empty spot where

Edward used to park. SEES Eric and Angela canoodling.

Couples everywhere. She puts her head down, hurries to

class. BEEEEP --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bella paces her room, not wanting to sleep/dream.     She eyes

the phone, waiting for it to ring. BEEEEP --

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Bella's on the phone, leaving yet another message, her

desperation having reached its peak. In the living room,

Charlie and Harry check their fishing gear.

She hangs up, leans her forehead against the phone.     Charlie

enters --

He stops when he sees her.   Puts a hand on her shoulder.

Off Bella's nod --

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

SERIES OF CUTS - Bella tries to navigate her way to the

meadow. She refers to a map, a compass.

Bella tries a trail; it doesn't look familiar.    Backtracks.

Tries another.

FLASHPOP - THE MEADOW - Edward and Bella lie in the grass

surrounded by flowers, sunlight dappling them. They look

lovingly into one another's eyes...

BACK ON BELLA - the memory and her desperation fuel her.

Finally, she sees a clearing ahead, hurries toward it --

EXT. THE MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Bella steps into the clearing, hopeful... but her face

falls. In contrast to the warmth of her memory, the meadow

is cold, gloomy, cloudy. And no Edward. She closes her

eyes, trying to force Edward here.

Nothing.   Her eyes open on the empty, overcast meadow.

Bella sinks to her knees. Tears threatening. But then she

hears a RUSTLING noise. She turns toward it, peers into the

woods.

Another RUSTLING NOISE comes from another part of the woods.

She spins toward it -- nothing. Then she turns and JUMPS

when she finds --

Vampire LAURENT standing just ten yards away.    Dreadlocks,

chiseled face. Bella can't believe it.

She beams, realizing he's real.

Laurent begins to stroll in a slow arc around her, his eyes

assessing her as --

Bella's smile falters, fear beginning to dawn on her.

Suddenly, EDWARD'S apparition appears between them.

Edward fades (throughout, he'll reappear when he speaks,

then fade again). Bella tries to look relaxed.

Suddenly, he's standing inches from her.   She now sees his

EYES. Dark blood-red.

Bella involuntarily takes a step away from him.

And now Bella knows.   Terror overwhelms her.   Edward appears --

He faces her, taking in her scent, bloodlust building.   Her

eyes dart around, escape is impossible --

The only thing she SEES is the apparition of Edward, looking

at her with alarm...

Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his

expression changes. He sees something in the forest behind

Bella - and it terrifies him.

He steps back. Bella's confused as she realizes he's no

longer focused on her... she follows his eyes, slowly

turning... to find behind her --

AN ENORMOUS BLACK WOLF skulking out of the darkness of the

woods. It stalks towards them, a low disturbing GROWL in

its throat, sharp teeth gleaming.

Bella is trapped between the two killers.    Edward whispers

in her ear --

The wolf slinks closer to Bella, a mere twenty feet from where

she stands, then --

FOUR MORE WOLVES soundlessly emerge from the trees, flanking

the black wolf. They're the size of small horses, all of

different hues: dark silver, chocolate, ash and russet-

brown. Their hackles are up, lips curling, bodies crouched,

ready to spring.

Bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her. The RUSSET-

BROWN WOLF is the closest and looks directly at her. Laurent

continues to retreat - then suddenly, almost simultaneously --

-- Laurent BOLTS across the meadow --

-- The wolves SPRING toward Bella -- and leap right over her

in pursuit of Laurent! Their thunderous SNARLS and SNAPS

shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire, surrounding

him before he reaches the treeline --

Laurent SWINGS at the dark silver wolf, SMACKING the wolf

half-way across the meadow. Another wolf lunges at Laurent -

he kicks it and it sails into a tree, SPLINTERING it.

The two wolves recover, lurch back to the pack which closes

in on Laurent. It's impossible to know who will prevail --

Bella doesn't stay to find out.     She RACES into the woods --

EXT. WOODS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Bella runs franticly, tearing down the hillside,

tripping, quickly picking herself up -- running, running --

EXT. WOODS/ROADSIDE - DAY

-- Bella DASHES out of the treeline and to her truck parked

on the shoulder. She jumps in, PEALS out --

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella BURSTS in, out of breath. Charlie and Harry

Clearwater are washing their fishing gear. Charlie spins.

We might note, though they don't, that Harry Clearwater

sighs ever-so-slightly.

Charlie grabs up the phone; as he dials --

Harry seems more concerned than gung-ho as he slips out.

Her eyes dart around the house, their vulnerability spinning

in on her. As Charlie hangs up, goes to his gun cabinet --

EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella knocks.   Then knocks again.    Finally, Billy answers.

Billy starts to close the door, but Bella stops him.

And he closes the door.      Off Bella --

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY

Bella climbs in, slams the door, pissed. Starts the truck.

Then turns it off. Deciding, she tosses the keys aside and

sinks down into her seat to wait...

BELLA'S POV - EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE - ON THE WINDOW - LATER

RAIN now pours down. Billy, inside, pulls the curtain back,

looks out at Bella with sympathy. Then closes the curtain.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - ON BELLA - SAME

Bella looks out the passenger window at Billy. Suddenly,

there's a KNOCK at the driver's window. She spins to find --

JACOB standing there. But his face is shockingly different.

His hair is cropped short. No friendly smile.

No warmth in his eyes. Just a hard, brooding resentment.

Bella is taken aback. She climbs out of the truck to FIND --

EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- behind Jacob stand Sam Uley, Jared, Paul and Embry.

They're oblivious to the rain, wear minimal clothes.

Jacob turns away. Sam leads the group toward the house.

Jacob follows. She, and we, note his sure-footed strides;

his awkward growth spurt disappeared overnight. She grabs

his arm.

He stops, turns back. The others wait on the porch for him.

They're out of earshot, but won't leave him alone with her.

His face is hard as he shakes his head.   He's not talking.

He's shaking, almost convulsing with anger.    She regroups.

Jacob glances at Sam, who gives him a look.     Jacob takes a

breath, trying to calm himself.

He practically runs away, joining the gang who all disappear

inside. Off Bella, standing in the rain...

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella enters, dripping wet, too listless to close the door.

Charlie's face falls when he sees the pain and lifelessness

returned to her. He grabs a blanket, wraps her in it.

Bella heads upstairs.   Charlie sags, helpless.   He moves to

the open door --

UNKNOWN POV - EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- It paces, watching Charlie slowly close the door...

INT. FOREST - NIGHT

Bella TEARS through the forest again, searching. She turns --

finds Edward, cold, distant. But his face begins to MORPH...

... and becomes Jacob's. She reaches for him but he BOLTS

backward, suddenly many yards away.

He, too, retreats further, disappearing until Bella is alone.

BLACKNESS encroaches, the moonlight becoming a tiny

spotlight on her. She searches the dark - then SEES a pair

of EYES, female, blood-red - coming toward her; HEAR a loud

SCREECHING NOISE --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- Bella tosses herself awake, slowly realizing it was just

a dream. But she HEARS the SCREECHING noise again!

Fingernails on her window. Bella bolts upright, looks

around for a weapon --

Bella cautiously moves to her window to find --

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Jacob, shirtless, clings to the top of a tree which bends

with his weight. Bella opens the window, whisper-yelling --

He begins to swing his legs, increasing momentum.       She

realizes what he's about to attempt --

He launches himself THROUGH the window with great agility --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- Jacob lands on the balls of his feet. Bella is stunned.

He freezes, listening for Charlie. Nothing. A bitter, self-

satisfied grin spreads on his face. It pisses Bella off.

He takes in her room.

He stays put.   She tries to push him but he's immoveable.

She becomes aware of her hands on his bare skin and muscular

chest. The intimacy of their touch. She pulls away.

He starts to speak -- but can't.   It's agonizing.   She sees

he's in pain. Is concerned.

She doesn't answer.

He looks at her, doesn't want to but knows it's the only

way. Beat.

He nods slowly, then turns to go.    She stops him.

He looks at her with a wry smile. Then pulls her into a

hug. Her cheek against his bare chest. She takes in the

closeness... then he soundlessly heads out her door. A beat

-- Bella starts pulling on clothes.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Bella drives through the darkness.

She pulls off the road, and drives into the forest.

EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST - NIGHT

Bella parks. Climbs out of her truck. The moon eerily

illuminates the clearing. Forest NOISES encroach.

She hears a RUSTLE amid the trees. Spooked, she freezes --

then SEES JACOB emerge from the trees. A moment as their

eyes meet. Then --

Sam Uley, Paul, Embry and Jared step into the clearing, as

well, half-clothed, movements almost synchronized. Their

expressions simultaneously alter into fury when they see

Bella. Paul spins on Jacob.

Jacob moves in front of Bella protectively, facing Paul.

But Paul and Jacob are so angry, their bodies begin to

shake, nearly convulse. It unnerves Bella --

Paul and Jacob are beyond hearing.

Jacob flashes anger, PUSHES Paul, hard.   Paul FLIES backward.

Paul rises, outraged, throws his head back in a growl,

vibrating violently --

Paul FALLS FORWARD but halfway to the ground there's a loud

RIPPING noise and Paul explodes in silver-gray fur, becoming

a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring!

Bella, horrified, grabs Jacob's arm, pulling him --

But he yanks away from her, runs directly at the Paul-wolf --

Jacob DIVES headfirst into the air - with another sharp

TEARING sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur

BURSTS from Jacob's skin - he lands on the ground a gigantic

russet-brown wolf, charging the Paul-wolf.

Bella reels as the two wolves CRASH into each other,

snarling and RAMMING one another. The sound is DEAFENING.

Their teeth flash at each other's throats.

Bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves

beyond the clearing and into the woods --

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM, as they fight deeper and deeper into

the darkness... until they disappear. The horrible SOUNDS

of the fight still ECHO --

BACK IN THE CLEARING -- Sam starts after them, kicking off

his shoes.

Sam disappears leaving an eerie quiet.    A long silence...

Off Bella, stunned.

EXT. LA PUSH - EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella's truck, driven by Embry, pulls up to a tiny,

weathered house with a window box full of marigolds. Jared,

in the back, jumps out, opens Bella's door. He and Embry

head toward the house. She doesn't move.

Jared, annoyed, hands Embry five bucks.

Bella looks at them, appalled.      They realize she's not

following them.

Bella warily climbs out of the car, joins them.     Embry

pauses at the door --

-- But the guys are already entering --

INT. EMILY'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella hesitantly enters behind Jared and Embry. She sees

EMILY, 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin.

SEE only one side of Emily's beautiful face, draped by long

black hair.

Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of

her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines

that pull down her eye and twist her mouth.

As Jared and Embry beeline for the muffins --

Bella cautiously approaches the counter, keeping an eye on

the door for Jacob.

Jared leans to Bella, challenging.

She spins - Sam is now standing behind her, the front door

open behind him.

Bella is chilled. Sam moves past her to Emily - the sight

of her instantly warms his face.

He kisses Emily's scarred face adoringly. Bella has to look

away. Their utter devotion is a painful reminder of what

she has lost. Fortunately, she's distracted by --

Jacob and Paul's arrival. They laugh and jab one another.

Bella is relieved to find Jacob unscathed. Jared and Embry

crowd them, finding a scar on Paul's arm --

As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes

find Bella's. He nods solemnly to the door; we should talk.

EXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAWN

The sun is just beginning to rise, reddening the clouds

overhead. Bella paces by the cliff's edge, trying to come

to grips with this new reality. Jacob keeps his distance,

trying to control his anger.

Jacob stops -- a beat as his anger is replaced by confusion.

He bursts out laughing.

Desolation fills him.   She sees this.

That lands with her.   She nods.

Bella stops, chilled to the bone.

EXT. FOREST HIGHWAY - DAY

A MASERATI with Canadian plates blasts down the highway at a

blinding speed --

INT. MASERATI - SAME

CLOSE ON VICTORIA, easily controlling the steering wheel

with two fingers. She speaks to someone we don't see, her

words laced with longing and fury.

INCLUDE her barely conscious passenger, DENISE, 30's, a

pretty bleach-blonde with expensive jewelry. She's just

coming to, a bump on her head where she was knocked out.

Denise now lucid, looks around to SEE --

IN THE BACK SEAT her husband, MICHAEL'S BODY, well-dressed

in a turtle neck, 40's, sits upright, his head tilted

forward as if he's resting. Denise reaches for him --

Denise, scared, shakes Michael's arm --

-- which causes Michael's head to roll to the side,

revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead

eyes. Denise starts SCREAMING. Victoria grins.

Victoria's hand jets out, grabbing a fistful of Denise's

hair. She yanks Denise over, exposing her neck just as we --

EXT. EMILY'S BACKYARD - DAY

ON JARED --

With stunning speed, Jacob grabs a four-pronged spading fork

from some garden tools, and FLINGS it toward Jared's head -

Jared easily, and amazingly, catches it.

INCLUDE - A picnic table in the middle of this small,

quaintly landscaped garden. Jacob, Bella, Embry, Paul, Sam,

Jared and Emily are in the midst of a huge breakfast.

They all look at her.   She instantly regrets saying it.

Jacob looks apologetically at Bella.   She shrinks, stung.

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jacob walks her to the door.

Bella nods.   He sees she's blue.

He offers a reassuring look before jogging into the woods.

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella tentatively approaches the large, modern glass home.

She climbs the porch steps, approaches the door...

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella enters to find it perfectly intact, lived-in, warm,

candles glowing... and the Cullen family enjoying the

evening - Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, Emmett and Jasper.

Bella is overwhelmed with joy at seeing them.

But they ignore her. Won't even look at her.      She starts

toward them but suddenly --

Edward appears and YANKS Bella away, pulling her to the door

and pushing her out, slamming it on her --

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- Bella runs to the window, peers in at the family who

continue to ignore her as they gather around Edward --

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - MORNING

Bella awakens, tears on her face. She can't take it. Gets

the hell out of bed, anxious to leave the dream behind. But

it stays with her...

EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella knocks on the door, rain falling around her, wind

blowing strong. Emily opens the door. Sees her.

Sam appears behind Emily.

-- as Sam wraps an arm around Emily. Their deep love is

achingly obvious. Off Bella's face --

FLASHPOP to Bella and Edward at her birthday party, in a

similar embrace, as Alice SNAPS their picture --

BACK ON BELLA - pained.

-- But Bella's already hurrying to her truck, determination

on her face.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

CLOSE ON A RIFLE as it locks and loads. INCLUDE CHARLIE,

who checks it, then notes the position of the SIX MEN in his

hunting party, all wearing rain gear. He SEES Harry at the

end of the line, pausing, looking down.

ON HARRY - he looks down at a large WOLF PAW PRINT.

The hunting party moves forward.   Harry lets them get ahead,

stomps out the paw print.

ON CHARLIE as he passes under a huge tree --

WHIP PAN UP THE TREE to find that HIGH ABOVE, crouching on a

limb, is VICTORIA. She watches Charlie with a vengeful glare.

She noiselessly SWINGS down to a lower branch, getting ready

to pounce on Charlie --

ON HARRY - his eye catches her movement; he looks up, SEES

the back of her red head -- his breath CATCHES --

She HEARS the sound, even through the rain and wind.    Before

Harry can raise his shotgun --

Victoria's standing next to him, WHIPPING the gun out of his

hands with superhuman speed. He GASPS, breath stuck in his

chest. She grins, about to bite -- but suddenly --

THE RUSSET-BROWN JACOB-WOLF smashes into her, knocking her

away. She rights herself immediately and takes off --

THE THREE WOLVES give chase, disappearing. It all happened

soundlessly, in seconds, unbeknownst to the others...

STAY ON HARRY - he still can't catch his breath, IN SLOW

MOTION he clasps his left arm -- INTERCUT WITH --

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - SAME

LIGHTNING FAST CUTS of THE CHASE - the wolves are right on

Victoria's tail, blasting through the forest --

BACK ON CHARLIE - SLOW MOTION - He turns to SEE Harry

clutching his chest. Charlie runs to Harry's side --

SMASH BACK TO VICTORIA escaping at breakneck speed she

bursts out of the trees to --

EXT. THE OCEAN (CONTINUOUS) - SAME

-- Victoria beelines for the choppy water, dives in -- when

she reappears, she's hundreds of yards offshore --

THE WOLVES prowl the beach in frustration as we go --

BACK ON HARRY - SLOW MOTION - he falls to his knees just as

Charlie reaches him. Off Charlie beginning CPR...

EXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAY

Bella's truck comes to a stop; she climbs out. Ignoring the

wind and rain, she strides to the cliff's edge; looks down --

BELLA'S POV - THE WATER - steely gray.     Rough whitecaps.

Bella smiles, tears of relief springing to her eyes.    She

turns to find Edward's apparition at her side.

She steps back from the cliff's edge - which causes him to

disappear.

That's it. She starts pulling off her shoes and coat,

adrenaline pumping --

Edward's apparition reappears, but she keeps going --

She takes a last look at him... then with a running leap --

FLINGS herself over the edge --

ON BELLA SCREAMING with exhilaration as she plummets down,

down... then SPLASHES into the water.

EXT. ON THE WATER'S SURFACE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

No sign of Bella. A beat. Suddenly, she POPS back up.

Inhales deeply -- and laughs!

She enjoys a moment of elation and empowerment... then turns

to swim ashore... but her smile falters when she realizes

how strong the current is...

A WAVE crashes over her head. She gasps for breath.     Then

ANOTHER WAVE hits her. Starts to pull her under...

UNDER THE WATER - Bella struggles --

ABOVE WATER - she pops up, looks around in a panic, SEES --

BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE - something orange-ish,

bobbing on the surface of the water --

Bella goes down - then comes up again - THE ORANGE-ISH thing

is suddenly thirty yards closer.

Bella struggles to stay afloat but the current SMASHES her

into a rock, the air goes out of her chest. She sinks.

ANGLE ON THE ORANGE-ISH THING -- IT'S VICTORIA, floating

effortlessly, hungry anticipation on her face. She dips

below the surface, vanishing...

UNDER THE WATER - BELLA SINKS, struggling at first... Edward

appears in front of her, his eyes full of longing and love.

He reaches to her, she to him, hands almost touching, things

going dark... suddenly A HAND GRABS HER COLLAR --

EXT. BEACH - DAY

CLOSE ON BELLA - barely conscious.

Jacob hits her on the back.   She spits up water, coming to.

She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved.

Behind him stands Sam.

Sam looks out at the water, scanning it.   Sensing something.

Jacob nods.   Sam jogs off.

As Jacob helps Bella up, we RACK FOCUS out to --

ANGLE ON THE WATER - where Victoria bobs, watching Jacob

guide Bella away... then she disappears below the surface.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Jacob drives. Bella wears a fleece jacket but still

shivers. He pulls her close, wrapping an arm around her --

She tucks herself into him.

She nods.   Awkward silence.   He fills it.

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE/INT. TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

The truck pulls up to the curb. It's pitch black outside.

Jacob's still holding her close as he shuts the engine off.

Bella faces him, looks directly in his eyes.

Their faces are close... and stay close for an intimate

beat. They could kiss, their lips near... but Bella blinks

herself back to reality and pulls away.

-- as she pushes open her door. WIND wafts in -- Jacob

reacts to a repugnant smell outside --

He abruptly pulls Bella back into the truck, SLAMS her door

shut and starts the truck.

As Jacob whips the truck around, the HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE --

BELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY -- a black Mercedes is parked in

front. Bella spins to the rear window as Jacob floors it --

He's still flooring it -- Bella cracks her door open while

they're moving - he SLAMS on the brakes. She jumps out --

EXT. ROAD (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella hurries up the road toward her house. Jacob's

suddenly standing in front of her, furious --

She starts to move past him, but he stops her --

Her words are a knife to the heart. She sees that, but

can't take them back. He hands her the keys.

She flinches at the stinging remark. He disappears into the

darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road.

She's closer to her house than her truck. She hurries

forward. The NIGHT SOUNDS start to encroach, branches

crackling, bushes rustling. She glances behind her...

nothing but darkness... she faces forward again ---

And runs directly into a VAMPIRE! Bella SCREAMS -- then

realizes IT'S ALICE. Bella is stunned. So is Alice.

She's clearly confused, but Bella hugs her with tears of joy.

Off Alice's horrified expression.

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

As Bella makes herself hot chocolate, Alice paces.

INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY

A dump, empty but for a table and chair. On the table lie

THE PHOTOS that once lined Bella's walls. Edward stands in

the center of the room, stock still, staring out at the

rising sun. His face is as empty and desolate as Bella's

was after he left.

A CELL PHONE on the table RINGS jarringly. He doesn't move.

It continues. Finally, he whips the receiver to his ear,

exasperated.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME - DAY

Rosalie, on the phone, stands at the picture window --

ROSALIE'S POV - EXT. ALASKAN HOUSE - Emmett, Jasper,

Carlisle and Esme walk away from the house, over the snow to

the treeline, on their way to hunt. None wear coats.

Rosalie turns away from the window.

She stops realizing she may be making a mistake.     But Edward

caught it, sits up.

Edward reels, uncomprehending.

STAY ON ROSALIE as --

She's been disconnected.   Off Rosalie, worried...

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella walks Charlie to his cruiser. He wears a dark, ill-

fitting funeral suit. At the car, Bella adjusts his tie --

Emotion threatens. She hugs him. He holds on a little too

tightly for a beat. Then he bucks up, climbs into his car.

Bella nods, then waves as he drives away. She turns to head

back inside but finds Alice suddenly at her side. She jumps.

Bella shrugs. Alice hears something, then looks down the

road -- JACOB'S RABBIT appears in the distance....

ANGLE ON THE RABBIT -- as it pulls up. Jacob drives, Embry in

the passenger seat. Bella approaches, surprised to find QUIL

in the back; same short hair and hard look as the others.

Jacob climbs out.   Embry takes the driver's seat.

They're wary... but pull out.      Jacob follows Bella into --

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jacob enters behind Bella.   She turns to him...

She sees he's shut down, cold.      She shuts down, as well.

Jacob turns, starts to leave. He looks back, sees her anger

turn to hurt. He stops. Beat.

He moves back to her, looks into her eyes with sadness.

He can't answer that, but he presses his hand to her cheek.

They look at one another, Jacob's hand still on her face,

his eyes searching hers.

Slowly, he starts to bend toward her lips. She doesn't pull

away. She misses him too much, needs him too badly. This

time, she'll let it happen. A kiss is a centimeter away...

Suddenly, the shrill RING of the phone makes them both jump.

Jacob, the closest to it, doesn't move his face, just keeps

looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone, answers --

She smiles.   But he instantly bristles, voice going cold.

Then the phone goes dead --

INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - SAME

-- Edward stares at his phone crazed, enraged, grief-

stricken -- he HURLS it against the wall, shattering it.

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

-- Jacob hangs up the phone.

Suddenly, Jacob's eyes go wild, his body stiffens, starts

trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph.

Bella turns to see what he's reacting to - Alice. She

stands in doorway looking empty, despairing. Bella

immediately hurries to her side.

OFF BELLA'S FACE -- FLASHPOPS of the CIRCULAR HALL, the

THREE VOLTURI - the DISMEMBERING of the rogue vampire --

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - DAY

The door SLAMS open and Bella races in, shoving clothes into

a bag. Jacob dogs her, protesting.

This wounds him. But she can't stop to soothe him.         She

pulls away and continues packing.

Alice enters.

Jacob growls, a shudder ripping through him. Bella

intercedes, stopping him from morphing by grabbing Alice.

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice flies to her car. But Jacob catches Bella's arm, not

hostile. Just pleading.

Bella sees the love in his eyes; this could be last time she

ever sees him. She hugs him, then pulls away.

He watches, agonized as she races to the car, climbs in...

INT. THE MERCEDES (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Bella tries to pull on her seat belt but Alice stops her --

Bella's response is to yank her seat belt into its clip.

Alice sees she won't change her mind. She shifts into gear

and PEELS OUT. Bella looks out the window for Jacob; he's

not there... she turns toward the woods --

BELLA'S POV -- THE TREELINE -- SHREDDED CLOTHING FLIES in the

air as we SEE the HIND LEGS OF A WOLF disappear into the

forest. Off Bella, fighting tears but determined as hell...

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

ON EDWARD walking down a seemingly endless corridor.

Finally, he reaches a set of intricately carved double doors

which open for him. He enters --

INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- Edward finds himself facing three wooden thrones, on

which sit the ancient Volturi: Aro, Marcus, Caius.

Aro wears an expensive, contemporary, black Italian suit,

long black hair in a loose ponytail to his waist.

Marcus and Caius eschew modern clothing for rich silk robes,

their long hair loose around them. All three have

translucent, onion-like, white skin.

Edward registers this, his face setting. Clearly, he's

going to give them cause. He strides out. Off Aro...

EXT. FLORENCE AIRPORT, ITALY - MORNING

Bella waits impatiently at the curb as --

A YELLOW HARD-TOP PORSCHE with darkly tinted windows

SCREECHES to a halt in front of her. The passenger door

opens - Alice is behind the wheel, pulling off the chic,

white, hooded coat she used for protection against the sun.

As Bella climbs in, buckles up --

Alice FLOORS it and the Porsche PEELS OUT --

EXT. TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

AERIAL VIEW - THE YELLOW PORSCHE screams down a highway,

cutting lanes, weaving through Peugots and Fiats --

INT. PORSCHE - DAY

Bella grips the dashboard as Alice narrowly misses a car.

EXT. VOLTERRA - PALAZZO DEI PRIORI - DAY (ALICE'S VISION)

It's jumpy, uneven -- EDWARD stands in shadow, his shirt

open, eyes shut. A clock GONGS as he steps into SUNLIGHT --

INT. PORSCHE - SAME

Alice punches it as Bella SEES --

BELLA'S POV - A MEDIEVAL FORTIFIED VILLAGE atop a distant

hill. Volterra.

EXT. VOLTERRA - DAY

The narrow, centuries-old streets are crowded with festival

revellers who all wear RED. They gaily head toward the town

square carrying red pendants, balloons, scarves. The

PORSCHE weaves through them, hurrying forward.

INTERCUT INSIDE THE PORSCHE --

Alice screeches to a halt at a ROAD BLOCK.   Italian POLICE

wave her back. Bella jumps out --

-- Bella's already running --

Alice watches her go... then senses something, looks up --

ALICE'S POV - ON THE ROOFTOPS - A FIGURE IN A BLACK HOODED

OVERCOAT leaps from building to building, tracking Bella.

As he disappears, off Alice --

EXT. VOLTERRA ALLEYS - SERIES OF FAST CUTS - DAY

Bella races down the cobble-stoned alleys, stumbling on the

uneven stones. Festival revellers head in the same

direction, she maneuvers around them.

ABOVE BELLA - SEE flashes of the FIGURE IN THE OVERCOAT --

As Bella nears the square, the alleys become more populated.

She pushes past people AD LIBBING "excuse me," "sorry."

Finally, she emerges into --

EXT. PALAZZO DEI PRIORI (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

BELLA'S POV - a sea of scarlet flags, dresses and jackets.

On the other side of the crowded square - THE CLOCK TOWER;

it reads one minute before noon.

Bella battles her way through the square; the crowd shoves

back, shouting at her in Italian --

Bella charges forward to find herself blocked by --

A FOUNTAIN - Suddenly, GONG!    The clock tower bells chime.

It's noon!

Bella jumps into the fountain, wades through the shallow

water to the other side -- she jumps out and barrels through

the crowd. Finally, she SEES --

BELLA'S POV - BENEATH THE CLOCK TOWER

Edward, in the shadows, just inches from the sunlight.

-- GONG! Bella's cry is drowned out by the BOOMING CHIME.

She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as --

CLOSE ON EDWARD (IN SLOW MOTION) - as he unbuttons his

shirt, exposing his bare chest --

ON BELLA (IN SLOW MOTION) - calling his name --

ON EDWARD'S FACE - he closes his eyes, welcoming death --

then slowly --

Edward takes a step into the sunlight, the rays hitting his

shoe, but before the sun touches his skin --

BELLA SLAMS into him - it's like running into a brick wall --

Edward opens his eyes and looks at Bella as the clock booms

its final CHIME. He's amazed, already dead in his mind.

He begins to realize... she is real.

He suddenly kisses her, stepping back into the shade with

her. They soak each other in like starved people suddenly

nourished. He pulls away to look at her...

They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when

suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind

him, taking a protective stance in front of her --

They face the DARK ALLEY that runs under the clock tower.

Out of the alley's shadows emerge --

TWO FIGURES IN HOODED OVERCOATS. Both stunningly handsome

males in their 20's: FELIX, huge, strong; and DEMETRI,

slender, elegant. Both have unsettling burgundy red EYES.

Demetri's smile suggests he doesn't agree. He's the more

gracious of the two. But no less dangerous.

ALICE suddenly appears, lightly tripping through the alley

toward them, pulling back the hood of her white swing coat.

She reaches Edward and Bella, positioning herself in a

protective stance, as well.

A very tiny, young woman appears, JANE. She also wears a

dark overcoat, her Botticelli angel-like face peering out

from under the hood. SEE her CRIMSON IRISES.

Felix and Demetri are back off immediately. Edward and

Alice step back, as well. Bella can see they're afraid of

this small girl.

Jane tosses Edward an overcoat.    He dons it.

Jane simply turns and heads up the alley, confident they'll

follow. Felix, smirking, gestures for them to go ahead of

him. Edward takes Bella's hand...

EXT. VOLTERRA STREETS - DAY

Jane leads Edward, Bella and Alice through several narrow,

dark alleys. Felix and Demetri bring up the rear. Edward

never loosens his grip on Bella's hand.

Their path dead ends at a WALL OF BRICK. Jane just strides

forward and, without breaking pace - drops down into an OPEN

HOLE in the street; it's a drain. Alice follows Jane.

Bella looks down, sees nothing but BLACKNESS.

Edward takes her wrists, dangles her over the hole --

INT. SEWERS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- ON BELLA as she drops through the darkness, to be caught

by Alice. Edward lands beside them, then Felix and Demetri.

Edward pulls Bella close as they follow Jane through the

sewer. He meets Bella's eyes, trying to look reassuring,

but he's tense as hell. Finally, they reach --

A FOLDING IRON ELEVATOR DOOR. Jane easily pulls it aside.

They all enter. As the door CLANGS shut on them --

CLOSE ON MODERN ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING. They all exit into --

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

An elegantly decorated space with old world charm. They're

greeted politely by GIANNA an attractive (human) receptionist.

They head through the lobby to --

THE LONG CORRIDOR that Edward traversed earlier.   Finally,

they reach the carved double doors which open --

INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Bella, Edward and Alice enter to face the three ancients:

Aro, Marcus, Caius.

Eight VOLTURI GUARDS (including Jane, Felix, Demetri) line the

walls in a variety of modern dark overcoats.

BELLA'S POV - THE FLOOR - there's a depression in the center

that leads to a drain. Bella shivers.

Aro rises, greets them like old friends, taking Edward's

hand and shaking it --

Caius responds with a sour expression. Marcus could care

less. Aro doesn't release Edward's hand, looks at him as --

Off Bella's look, Edward explains --

He releases Edward's hand and turns to Bella.

He reaches for Bella's hand. She hesitates, does she have a

choice? Aro laughs at her reluctance, further extends his

hand. Bella finally takes it.

A beat as he holds her hand... confusion sweeping over him.

He releases her, moves back to his chair, deep in thought.

Jane turns toward Bella but Edward springs in front of her --

Jane instead focuses her gaze on Edward which FLINGS him

across the room where he collapses, writhing in agony. Jane

concentrates on him with a small smile, enjoying his pain.

Bella and Alice rush to his side.    As soon as Jane looks

away, Edward's pain ceases.

Jane's gaze now turns toward Bella who cringes, awaiting the

pain... but nothing happens. Jane's grin is replaced by

anger. Aro laughs like a child with a new toy.

Jane, infuriated, moves toward Bella, but Aro stops her with

a tiny gesture.

He nods to Felix who moves toward Bella, but he only takes a

step before Edward tackles him.

Alice leaps to help but several Volturi guard hold her back,

which is no easy job. As she struggles mightily --

Edward is David to Felix's Goliath.    Edward will lose, but

he'll go down fighting.

-- Edward is fast, anticipating Felix's moves before he

makes them, but Felix is stronger --

-- Felix grabs Edward, throws him into the ceiling, SMASHING

against the marble; he drops like a stone. Is then

immediately KICKED across the room.

But Aro ignores her, leans forward to study Edward.    Jane is

itching to step in. Aro gestures her back.

-- Felix takes some hits, but then lifts Edward overhead,

CRACKING him like a nut, then flinging him against a wall --

Bella runs toward Aro but a Volturi Guard flings her away;

she flies HARD against the wall.

The guard is then occupied by the thrashing Alice --

Bella, bruised, but not broken, makes another attempt to get

to Aro -- finally reaches him, kneels in front of him --

-- as she yanks her collar back, exposing her neck to him.

Aro is surprised and intrigued. A beat.

Felix immediately releases Edward who manages to look up.

He sees Bella kneeling in front of Aro.

Edward moves toward Aro but is quickly immediately pinned by

Jane's invisible powers; he writhes in agony. Alice can no

longer bear Edward's suffering --

Aro, intrigued, gestures for Jane to stop; Edward goes limp.

Bella is taken aback by this.   Aro is surprised, as well.

She thrusts out her hand. Aro nods to the Guards who

release her. She gives him her hand. He closes his eyes --

EXT. FOREST - DAY (ALICE'S VISION)

Edward hunts a deer. Matching his pace is another vampire -

Bella! She's pale and beautiful - she and Edward smile at

each other as they take a last grand leap for the kill --

INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL - DAY

BACK ON ARO, utterly delighted.   He releases Alice's hand.

Alice moves to Edward's side, helps him up.

Bella hurries to Edward's side, too.    Caius is put out.

Aro gestures - Demetri throws open the carved double doors.

Caius glares at them threateningly.

Edward, recovered now, takes Bella by the arm and, with

Alice, they cautiously back toward the door --

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LONG CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Demetri leads Bella, Edward and Alice out of the hall.

As they make their way up the corridor, they see coming

toward them --

A GROUP OF TWO DOZEN TOURISTS, led by a beautiful vampire,

HEIDI. Edward, Alice and Bella stop to let them all pass.

As Heidi passes Demetri, he gives her a flirtatious smile --

Heidi smiles.   She gives Bella a curious once-over, then

continues on.

A HUSBAND and WIFE, 60's, cameras around their necks, pass

Bella. The Husband winks at Bella --

As the Tourists file past, we HEAR a variety of languages,

German, Japanese, English.

The group is moved toward the carved double doors which

swing open for them. They file into the marble hall --

Edward pulls Bella forward, but she cranes her neck back as

the last of the tourists disappear inside.

As the large doors close... we begin to HEAR SCREAMING --

Edward and Alice rush Bella out - PUSH IN ON BELLA'S

TORMENTED FACE as the SCREAMING gets louder... and louder --

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

ON BELLA'S SLEEPING FACE as the SCREAMING CRESCENDOS --

Bella sits bolt upright, yelling --

She catches her breath, disoriented, confused. Then she

turns to find Edward lying beside her, looking at her.

Beat, she looks at him, wary.

Now Edward takes her by the shoulders.

She's beginning to believe him.

He moves to kiss her... but abruptly stops.   Suddenly --

HER DOOR swings open - she spins toward it as the LIGHTS

flip on and Charlie enters. Edward is gone.

He kisses her forehead. Exits.     A beat... she turns to find

Edward sitting on the bed.

Bella melts in his eyes.   He kisses her.

They look at each other; an impasse.    She decides something,

grabs her jeans, pulls them on--

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN

CLOSE ON BELLA --

INCLUDE THE ENTIRE CULLEN FAMILY who surround Bella. The

house has been restored to it's original warmth and beauty.

Edward sits off to the side as Bella addresses them.

Edward, frustrated, sits back.    She faces the family again.

They nod or otherwise communicate agreement.

Alice jumps up and hugs Bella.

Bella smiles.   Jasper rises, but keeps his distance.

Rosalie, torn, looks at Edward who's stony toward her.

Bella takes it stoically.    Emmett bounds over and lifts

Bella into a bear hug.

Esme approaches and embraces Bella warmly.

Carlisle moves, not to Bella, but to --

The front door suddenly SLAMS. Edward's gone.     Bella

blanches but turns to the family.

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - SAME

POV FROM AFAR ON A HILLTOP -- REVEAL IT'S VICTORIA watching

the house down below. Off her seething fury --

EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

A FERRARI has pulled over to the side of the road. VICTORIA

PEERS IN THE WINDOW. The DRIVER, a middle-aged man smiles --

As she climbs in...

INT. EDWARD'S CAR - MORNING

Edward drives Bella home.    He is somber.   She is resigned.

He takes her hand.

He looks to her, kisses her hand... then suddenly Edward

SLAMS on the brakes --

THEIR POV - THE ROAD

-- Someone stands in the road directly in front of them --

it's JACOB. He glares, then turns and walks into the woods.

She pushes out of the car --

INT. WOODS - MORNING

Edward and Bella tramp through the woods to FIND -- Jacob

leaning against a tree. His expression is hard.

Jacob doesn't buy it. Bella is frustrated. But Edward

takes a step toward Jacob. Calm. Diplomatic.

Jacob leans back against the tree, arms folded, waiting.

She looks at him. He returns the look. Jacob sees the

devotion between them. It wounds him. But he masks it.

Jacob is horrified, starting to shake with rage.

Edward takes Bella's arm, starts to pull her away.    Jacob

lunges, trying to extract Bella from him --

Edward PUSHES Jacob away; he flies back ten feet in the air,

but mid-air he PHASES INTO A WOLF!

-- The Jacob-wolf lands on all fours, spinning to face

Edward in an attack stance. Edward shifts stance, as well,

readying for a fight --

Edward and Jacob circle one another, seconds from lunging --

But Bella races between them, forceful, insistent.

A long tense beat, none of them backing down - it could go

either way --

Both rivals see she's dead serious. Edward backs off, ever-

so-slightly... the Jacob-wolf does the same.

Edward shakes his head.   Doesn't move an inch.

Edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. But his

eyes never leave the wolf's. They glare at one another.

Bella carefully approaches the Jacob-wolf, blocking his line

of sight. Her voice is kind, pleading.

Anguish sweeps through the wolf's fierce face.    It's even

harder to take than when he's in human form --

Suddenly, the wolf BOLTS out of there...

ON BELLA - fighting tears as she watches him disappear...

Edward's arms wrap around her from behind.

She turns to face Edward, looking into his loving eyes...

He kisses her tenderly, washing away her concerns.

And she sees that's the truth, believes it. He takes her

hand and together they turn, heading out of the woods...

Off them, hand in hand, inseparable... as we begin to --

... HEAR the agonized HOWL of a wolf in the far distance...
