A progression of images of CELESTE and JESSE, ages 18 to 30.

Visual media evolves with them throughout the years.

Celeste is a chronic overachiever and Jesse is sweet, goofy

and funny. He makes her laugh. They are best friends but it's

clear that Jesse wishes they were more.

Close-up of their hands crossed, making "C" and "J" shapes.

Celeste and her football player boyfriend, Mike, kissing.

Jesse watches enviously from the sidelines, holding Mike's

helmet.

They go to college together, study together, drink together.

They are still best friends.

Junior year, Celeste with Saleem, her hot, black militant

boyfriend. They kiss passionately.

A moment later, Jesse poses reluctantly with the couple,

holding up a "Black Power" fist, weakly.

Senior year, Jesse draws "C AND J FOREVER" in a pristine,

snowy forest with a stick; he and Celeste laugh.

A moment later, they kiss deeply. They are finally together.

On an engraved necklace, carved into a tree, written on a

wet beach, and on their wedding cake.

Moving into their house, dancing, reading side by side,

kissing. This is true, everlasting love, the real kind.

Celeste and Jesse, in silence, amongst joyful party guests.

Jesse telling a joke and Celeste no longer laughing.

Jesse and Celeste on a bench, distant.

The next picture, hugging.

Jesse asleep on Celeste's shoulder as she kisses him on the

head.

2.

It's a bright, clear Los Angeles Saturday afternoon. Celeste

and Jesse, now 30, both sing along to "Love Rhino," the song

heard under the montage. Jesse drives while Celeste is on her

Blackberry. Jesse, boyishly handsome, wears an old tee and a

hooded sweatshirt. Celeste is wearing all black workout

gear. She is always wearing all black.

I'm a Love Rhino...

Don't worry `bout me, I've Dont' worry `bout me, I've

got a enough love for got enough love, for the two

the...(her Blackberry rings) us. Oh please...

oh shit, I gotta take this.

Turn it down.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

...I'm a Love...

Jess, turn it down, seriously!

She playfully slaps him. He turns it down. A little.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Hello? Hi. With Jesse, running

errands. (to Jesse) Turn it down.

More. (back to the phone) Yeah, I

can do it now. No, it'll be fast,

right? (To Jesse) Hey, I have to

give a quick sound bite for the New

York Times, so no noise please? For

a second?

Maybe. I may have an important call

coming in too, so...

They both know he has no important call coming in.

(on the phone) Okay. Ready? This

year all trends point towards

simplicity and comfort.

Celeste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of

them.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Jess, just go around him! (To the

phone) Sorry.

3.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Consumers will be less likely to go

out for entertainment.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Uhhh, things like Voodoo, casual

wear and cookbooks will see a huge

spike in the market.

What the shit??

(she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone

call.(back to her call) That's

enough of a blurb, right?

Does this tooth look dark?

Okay. Call me back if they need

more.

Like a little darker than the rest?

Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Can't

you just sit still for two minutes?

And we talked about this, no more

smoking!

I wasn't smoking, I just found it.

4.

Come on.

They drive by "Urban Light," Chris Burden's installation at

the entrance of LACMA. They are rows of restored street

lamps. Celeste sneers.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Really? Street lamps? No. Not doin'

it. That is not art.

I think it's beautiful.

A beat passes. Then, Jesse pulls over.

What are you doing? Why are you

stopping?

Well, your appointment is not until

noon and this is that place with

the deadstock vintage Italian

fabric. I thought it would be good

for the guest room windows.

Celeste is truly touched by the gesture.

Oh wow...you are so thoughtful.

Jesse smiles, proud of himself.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Thanks, Jess.

She gives him a kiss on the cheek. Jesse's phone rings, he

answers.

Whassup, muthafucka??

Celeste rolls her eyes and gets out of the car to look at

fabric.

Celeste is getting back in the car with some fabric swatches.

5.

Jess, that place is insane. They

have tassels that were manufactured

for Mussolini's mistress...

(covering the phone) Sorry, I'm on

the phone. It's important.

Okay then.

Really? I just...don't know what to

say. Thank you so much for calling

me.

(whispers) Did you get the job??

Well, sometimes things are just

meant to work out.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Okay, great. Great. Talk soon. Bye.

Was that the job? Did you get the

book job?

No, but Celeste...

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

...a swell came in last night. Out

of the Northeast. It's overhead and

it's glassy.

What the fuck are you talking

about?

6.

7.

Yeah. Take me home, it's fine.

Jesse is dropping Celeste at home.

Be back by six so you can shower.

Why shower?

Dinner with Beth and Tucker.

Right, right.

Have fun shredding your glassy

peel.

Aw, so wrong.

Love you.

Love you too.

He promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature "C

and J" hand sign. She flashes it back. He zooms off.

Celeste and Jesse are on double date with BETH, 30, petite,

and full of energy and TUCKER, 31, preppy in an indy way.

These are their best friends from college. They're engaged.

Did you end up going to see that

band at Spaceland last week?

Oh, The Injured Saint? Yeah, dude.

They are real. You know what? They

should be your wedding band.

8.

They're loud but they're

affordable.

They opened for Darcy Fudged His

Knickers. Now, they're amazing.

You'd be lucky to book them for

your wedding. Or you should see if

Emergency Breakthrough is

available. The horn section is

tight.

It's already done. We got the best

swing band in New England.

Sugarfoot and The Swingin' Scrod.

I told you, I'm not doing it. Swing

is so late 90's, honey.

I love you. We'll talk about this

later.

So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet

zalad and zeh bolognese,

riiiiiiight?

Yawh. But I em murdering zeh creme

brulee alooooone. No sharrrrring.

I don't vant dessert. I vill joost

have bite oof yorrrs.

Ve know zeh end of zat story. Yawh

we doooooo!

Yawh!!!!

9.

I can't do this. I just can't.

Are you okay? Oh no...

It's just not right. I can't hold

my tongue. We can't do this

anymore.

Honey, weddings are stressful, I

know all about it. But you guys

we'll be fine!

NO. WE are fine. What the fuck are

YOU TWO doing??

What do you mean?

Yeah, what do you mean?

What do I mean?? You guys are not

together anymore! This is not

normal! You've been separated for

SIX MONTHS and you hang out every

day like nothing's wrong! It's

fucking weird!

Beth...

No, Tucker, you think it's weird

too. Speak up for yourself.

It's weird. Let's not play charades

anymore.

10.

No charades. We are separated and

we're friends. You guys should be

happy, all we did was fight before.

Yeah, you guys should be thrilled

about this. You'll never have to

pick sides.

Yeah, everyone's cool.

Everyone is not cool! This is not

cool! It's just not working for

me, I'm sorry.

Beth gets up and walks out. Celeste and Jesse sit there and

stare at Tucker in silence.

Bett iz zo angry.

Yah, she iz uber angry. Yahhh.

Yeah, you guys are weird. I can't

do this. It's fucked up.

Tucker gets up and leaves. Jesse and Celeste watch him leave

and sip their wine quietly.

Celeste drives and Jesse is in the passenger seat. He has a

tube of Vaseline Lip Therapy. He is stroking it rapidly as if

it were a penis. This is not the first time.

C, look...uhhhh!

Celeste looks at him. She joins in. She reaches over and

pushes in on the tube. Vaseline comes out of the top. This

looks a lot like a penis ejaculating.

Ahhhhh! Oh god!

They both erupt in laughter. Even though this is the

thousandth time they've done this stupid joke, it will always

be funny. To them.

11.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Beth and Tucker are crazy.

Crazy.

It's not weird that we hang out.

Do you think it's weird we hang

out?

No, of course not. You're my best

friend.

Yeah you too. I mean, we can't not

hang out. The last time we didn't

talk for longer than a week was in

10th grade when you went to Space

Camp Canada.

Yeah, that was 6 weeks of torture.

I mean, the anti-gravity training

was insane but I missed you.

Celeste and Jesse stand in the driveway of Celeste's house.

There is a bit of a linger.

Well, I'm exhausted.

Me too.

Celeste walks to her front door with her key and Jesse heads

towards the side gate with his key. It is now obvious that he

is living in her guest house.

Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight,

how's the heat in there?

Oh, it's fine. I'm fine.

He keeps walking. He turns again to Celeste.

12.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Sorry I'm still living here. Times

are tough and money's tight so you

know...

Jesse, please, you can stay here as

long as you like. It's your

studio. It's actually really nice

to have you here.

For me too.

Oh, don't forget, the contractor

needs to get in there for

measurements in the morning. So

make sure your thingys, your

sculptures, whatever...are out of

the way.

Got it.

Night.

Night. Love you.

Love you too.

Celeste's morning symphony is under way. She sits in front of

a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 4

neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television

tuned to CNN. She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads

the paper, watches TV, and surfs the internet. She is clearly

a culture vulture. Jesse walks by outside his studio and does

the "C and J" sign to Celeste. She does it back

instinctively. Is it weird that we hang out so much? She

shakes it off and titters. She's being ridiculous; it's fine.

Celeste walks in, dressed impeccably. Again, in all black.

She is in a rush, on her Blackberry, bombarded with a hefty

pre-work crowd. People are in some semblance of a line,

waiting to order.

13.

Large coffee, please.

Excuse me, sir?

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Sir? You?

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

You do realize that you just cut in

front of a lot of people.

Oh. Sorry, I didn't know.

Did you not?

I'm in a rush.

So you did know. And everyone's in

a rush, so...

Well, she was looking at the

pastries, I didn't think she was

ready to order.

Well, it's not just her. It's

everyone behind her too. So, if you

want to ask all these people if

it's okay to cut in front of them

because you are late, be my guest.

Just don't assume that your time is

more important than everyone

else's.

14.

Have a nice day.

(sotto) Prick.

Pop Form Headquarters looks like the future. No walls, just

large glass slabs, separate the offices from each other.

Celeste is on camera, in the middle of conducting a live

satellite interview for MSNBC.

American culture is dying. We have

an unrelenting appetite for

processed junk food, talentless pop

stars like Riley Banks and recycled

movie franchises like Transformers.

The more we consume crap, the more

we want crap.

Rachel Maddow is conducting the interview in studio.

Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there

an upshot?

I think there will be a groundswell

movement towards simplicity.

People will start to listen to

their most rudimentary needs-- they

will crave mental, spiritual and

physical nourishment. It's back to

basics.

Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks

for being with us today. You're

great, come back any time. For more

on this gloomy but interesting

subject, look out for trend

forecaster, Celeste Martin's new

book "Shitegeist," on bookshelves

Monday.

15.

Thanks so much, Rachel.

SCOTT, 40, Celeste's partner, gay but very straight, sharply

dressed and bespectacled, sits at his desk. Celeste enters.

So I had dinner with the drama club

last night.

Who's that?

Tucker and Beth. They're such

dicks. They left in protest because

they think Jesse and I are being

"unhealthy." So judgy, right? We're

fine.

You're only done when you're done.

Spare me the spiritual platitudes,

Scotty. If we were gay,(she motions

to Scott) no one would even

question us being friends!

You and Jesse are clearly not ready

to let each other go. And there's

nothing wrong with that.

Yeah there's nothing wrong with

that. I mean, what do you think?

Well, to be honest...

Celeste looks at an e-mail her blackberry and interrupts.

Wait, we're signing Riley Banks??

When were you going to tell me?? I

just trashed her on Rachel Maddow.

Great.

16.

Yeah, that's why I wanted you to

come in. It's a huge account..

Scott, you and I built this company

so we wouldn't have to take an

account like Riley Banks.

Well, you and I may not have a

company if we don't take Riley

Banks. Recession, remember?

She's like a...soul-less hologram.

She is releasing a new album. She

wants us to do the branding and

merchandising. We need to take this

account.

Ok. Fine. I'm gonna go eat lunch.

If you are looking for my opinion,

I do think you should start dating.

I don't do dating. The right guy

will show up. And I'm still on

track for my 25 year plan.

No one has a 25 year plan. Except

for my mortgage company.

First child at 33. Second at 35.

Which means I will only be 56 at my

eldest's college graduation. The

bad news is that I may not be at my

4th grandchild's high school

graduation. But that's okay, I

guess.

I'm fascinated with the mentally

ill.

17.

I've got time. I'm not worried.

Well, do me a favor and get your

fuck on before you meet the next

guy.

Celeste looks at Scott in shock.

What are you doing?

Sorry, I was trying to be your

saucy gay friend. It didn't feel

good.

Yeah don't.

Jesse and SKILLZ, 32, another man-boy, in hip-hop gear, wait

in a very, very long line of very, very hip people at LA's

trendiest new yogurt place.

The economic climate is real bad,

man. And I think my business is

taking the hardest hit of all. It's

brutal. And no one's talking about

it.

You sell pot.

Not for long, dude. Have you been

to those weed pharmacies? They're

killing me. I gotta branch out.

Maybe start working in

methamphetamines? Or maybe teach

pre-school. I always wanted to do

that. I love kids.

Skillz is distracted by something.

SKILLZ (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Sorry, I know this is serious talky

time but would you look at the

fucking seat on that girl?

18.

SKILLZ (CONT'D) (CONTD)

THAT is a party.

I don't think it's over.

What? Her butt? No, it will never

be over. It goes on forever. It's

like space. So great.

No, Celeste and I. I think she's

just confused and overwhelmed right

now about everything. But she'll

come around. She always does.

Uh oh. It's been a while now. I

think it's over, bro. It may be

time to accept that and move on.

Call that dime Veronica.

That was a one time thing, a couple

months after Celeste and I broke

up. Celeste does not know about

that. And we will keep it that

way.

Didn't know that was a hit and run.

Sounded like you liked her.

Well, she's not Celeste. It's

always been Celeste. I'm not ready

to give up.

Okay, but remember, you can't re-

heat a souffle.

Huh?

19.

Also, there's Bettys everywhere.

It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind

Celeste that you can pull wool.

Make her sweat a little bit.

It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go

out with somebody.

They reach the front of the line.

Do you know what you want?

Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I

don't want to start all over again.

I want everything that I believed

to have been true to be true. I

also want a goji berry/green tea

swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity

Pebbles. Please.

(to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go

out on a date with my friend here.

Um, wait, where's your wife? You

guys are here like everyday

together.

Well...we're separated.

Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay.

I'll go.

Celeste and Beth wander amidst the modern art. They stop to

take in a Cindy Sherman photo.

It's so...grotesque.

But kind of beautiful. In a

grotesque way.

20.

Ugh, let's keep moving. Too many

feelings.

BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I need to say this and then I'll

never bring it up again. I'm sorry

I wigged on you guys the other

night but I don't know what you're

doing. I think it's stupid that

you're not together. You are best

friends and that's the hard part.

Nothing else matters.

Beth, the reality is I love Jesse

dearly but he doesn't have a

checking account. Or dress shoes.

The father of my children will have

a car. But...Jesse will always be

my best friend.

Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's

your life. But I definitely don't

think he should be living in your

guest house. I think you're kind of

breaking his heart. Slowly.

Jesse is fine.

Can I show you something?

Sure.

Okay. Look.

What am I looking at?

21.

It's a hair. On my NECK.

Ewww. Will you get that thing

lasered off, please? What the fuck?

I can't because it will pop up

somewhere else where I can't keep

my eye on it.

Are you serious? That's the

craziest thing I've ever heard.

It's not a turnip.

Trust me, I know my body. It's a

cruel land mine.

Okay, well at least pluck it for

Chrissake.

I should, at least before my

wedding, right?

What is wrong with you?

(in pain) AHHHHHHHHHH!

Sorry sir, my friend has a really

strong emotional reaction to modern

art.

That was fucking rude.

Had to be done.

22.

The studio is beautifully, magically chaotic. There are

large canvasses everywhere, paint rags, spray cans, common

household items turned into sculptures (buttons, clothespin,

hangers) and mobiles. Celeste walks in. Jesse is on a

mattress on the floor, he's clearly been sitting there for a

while. He is fist-deep in a huge bag of Cheetos and he's

watching the 2008 Beijing Olympics on Tivo. He is watching a

short feature about Olympian Matthias Steiner, a gold

medalist in weight lifting.

Hey...you're not working? Are you

watching the Olympics? Again? And

crying? Again?

Jesse blows his nose.

Yeah.

God, you really love that, don't

you?

Matthias' wife died in a car

accident last year.

Well, three years ago now but...

And he dedicated his gold medal to

her. The human spirit

is...unbreakable.

Jesse is choked up, can barely speak.

Uh huh. Hey, did you finish that

artwork for the Pop Form website?

Huh? Oh yeah, I'm almost done. I'm

working on it. I think you'll

really like it.

I'll like it more when I have it

because I needed it yesterday,

so...

23.

Celeste, can you sit down for a

minute? I have something really

important to tell you.

Oh. Okay. Does it have something to

do with the work you owe me?

I don't know how to tell you this

but...I have a date tonight. I'm

gonna start dating. People.

A date? Really? That is so great.

It is? You don't...

Yeah! Don't cry. Good for you,

Jess.

That doesn't bother you? Wow, okay.

Well, it's actually the Yogurt

Girl. From Yoga Yurt?

Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She's

cute! But so young, right?

Super young. Her body is all-time.

Okay, no need for that. But this is

good! You gotta crawl before you

walk. I mean she's definitely not

gonna be wifey number two, right?

Ha.

Well, it's just a date.

24.

Big move. I'm proud of you.

Thanks?

Can I get up now?

Huh? Yeah, sure.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Yeah, Skillz kinda made me do it

and from the get go, she was way

into...what are you looking at?

No, nothing. Are you gonna wear

your hair like that?

What? Oh. I don't know, is it

weird?

Not weird, just different from how

it looks best.

Anyway, this is what we're doing

right? We're getting divorced and

we're friends and we're also dating

people? That's what we're doing?

There. Better. You'll be great. You

don't even need to be great. Just

be you. Take her somewhere nice.

Okay mom.

Call me after?

25.

Jesse is on a date with Yogurt girl. It's clear he's hasn't

been doing a lot of talking.

So I was in school but then I

dropped out because I really wanted

to work in fashion but it's really

hard to find a paid internship? So

I went back to school and now I

work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm

really looking to make money doing

something I love? But I'm sure the

universe is looking out for me and

when the time is right, the right

thing will come along, you know?

Celeste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the

outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a

woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the studio door

shuts. Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldn't do that.

Would he?

Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats

breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines.

This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks'

new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be.

Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head,

"yeah, I get it." She turns it off.

Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at

the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally,

a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He

is alone. Phew.

Celeste, Beth, Tucker and Jesse browse as a foursome for

books.

Where is it? They told me it would

be in new releases...

26.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

That's what I call placement.

Well you probably shouldn't steal

it. Even if it is yours.

There.

But you don't have the "O" on your

cover, you can't do that!

Yes I can.

There you guys are...you're on

Oprah's Book List?? That's so

great!

Some people are browsing my book.

Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ...

GIRL (V.O.)

Jesse?

Veronica?

Yeah, hey. How are you?

27.

Good, good. You look great.

Thanks, you too. How's your clothes

pin collage going?

Slowly, but it's going.

Well, don't give up. Your work is

really unique. And beautiful. I

hope that doesn't sound...

No, that's means a lot, thank you.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I had so much fun...that night. I'm

so sorry I didn't call you. My life

is just...

I had a lot of fun too.

Oh sorry, Veronica, this is Beth

and Tucker and Celeste.

Oh, this is your book? I read an

excerpt online, it's really

compelling.

Wow, thank you. That is so nice.

Well, nice to see you.

Oh you too. Take care.

28.

What is that?

That was uh...Veronica.

Story?

No story. Just this girl I met a

while ago.

Huh. She's pretty.

Celeste changes focus again and turns to a Border's employee

to loudly and unconvincingly act out "Interested Reader" for

other shoppers to hear.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

EXCUSE ME SIR? WHERE CAN I FIND

MORE COPIES OF THIS BOOK

"SHITEGEIST" FOR MY FRIENDS? I

HEARD IT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!

He looks at her like she's crazy and keeps walking. And so do

her friends.

Jesse and Skillz are exiting a Bizmarkie concert, surrounded

by older hip-hop fans and young hipsters who weren't alive

when the Biz dropped his first album. They are trashed.

Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what I

neeeeeed...

And you say he's just a friend, and

you say he's just a friend....

Oh baby youuuuu.... Oh baby youuuuu....

Jesse's iPhone rings. A very flirty picture of Celeste comes

up.

No, no, no. Ignore for sure.

29.

Uh, I just need to...(picks up)

Hey.

(whispering) Nooooo!

(talking to Celeste) Uh huh. Okay.

Okay. No, I'm not busy. (hangs up)

Uh, I'm gonna go home.

Come on, after the show it's the

after party.

There's an Ikea dresser that she

needs me to "build."

Skillz takes this in. He is impressed.

Huh. Really, cowboy? Are you

guys...

I told you pal, I know what I'm

know I'm doing. She just needed

time.

Celeste is in a corner with a glass of wine and a HUGE bag of

nuts and bolts. She had a fight with a dresser and the

dresser won. Jesse uses his key and enters.

I'm in here! Fuck Sweden!

Oh baby youuuuu....

It was definitely easier to build

the Brooklyn Bridge, I think.

Well, how hard can it be? It's a

dresser, right?

TIME CUT TO:

30.

Jesse is drunker than before and sitting where Celeste was

earlier. Crying, frustrated. He's covered in sawdust and nuts

and bolts.

Fuck me!!! Do you think they

intentionally pick a random piece

of furniture to make totally

unbuildable, just to fuck with

you??!

Thank you!

Wait. I got it.

TIME CUT TO:

We see Jesse and Celeste admire their "dresser" as they drink

wine.

Perfect.

Fucking lay-up.

We reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish

robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling

that should have been the dresser. They both slide to the

floor in satisfaction. They look at their "artwork." They

laugh; they are pretty drunk.

Ruscha meets Basquiat...

...meets Serra meets Corky from

"Life Goes On."

Yeah. He's a vegan, you know.

Cherish. That is so cute.

They share a laugh.

31.

You're cute.

Celeste looks at him. She kisses him. He kisses back. It gets

hotter. They fall back.

Celeste and Jesse are in bed. Celeste is asleep. Jesse wakes

up and gently kisses Celeste all over her face. This wakes

her up. She is hungover and confused.

Hey. What are you doing?

I love you.

Celeste does not respond. She pops up out of bed.

Okay...

We should talk about this.

Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a

bad idea. I'm sorry.

Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I

love you.

Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were

drunk, and the dresser and I

thought...you're dating other

people!

Only to...god, I'm so stupid.

He realizes how pathetic it sounds.

Oh no, I thought...

You thought what?

32.

Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or

I wouldn't have let it happen. Come

on Jess, we're not getting back

together, you didn't think...

Celeste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up

and leaves. He turns.

You know, there's a guy that you

can call, from Ikea, that will

build you're dresser. You should

call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck

you too. I'm a fucking idiot.

Jess! No, I didn't..Jess!

Celeste collapses back in the bed.

A bunch of Los Angeles hipsters file out of a yoga class.

Everyone is sweaty and a little out of it. Celeste heads out

as she towels off. She heads towards the shoe cubby holes.

Hello.

What?

I said hello.

Oh. Hi.

Celeste keeps walking briskly. PAUL, 35, short but handsome,

tries to keep up with her.

(a little too loud) How was your

practice?

My practice?? It was...wait,

what?...it was fine. (who is this

guy?)

33.

I see you in class a lot. You have

a great warrior two. Are you

single?

Are you really doing this right

now? You're really doing this right

now.

Yeah, I can't believe it either. I

don't do this, it's just happening,

I can't stop...it...what do you do?

Just gonna jump right in there.

Wow, Captain Conversation.

Paul. Here's my card.

You bring cards to yoga??

Look, you're really pretty. I'm not

good at this. Help.

(she looks at the card.) A

financial analyst. Cool.

Not really. It's not cool. Did

you ever tell me what you did for a

living?

No, no I didn't.

Well, will you? I'd love to know.

34.

I'm a trend forecaster. I forecast

trends.

Paul scoffs at the notion that this is a real career.

Trend forecaster. Really? Huh.

They have reached the parking lot. Celeste turns to him with

purpose.

You traded in your Porsche for an

Audi because the economy is tanking

and you're afraid you'll lose your

job soon. You bought a Samsung cell

phone because you think it makes

you seem more "business-oriented,"

unlike the iPhone which is for

teenage girls. You go to yoga

because you went to a sub Ivy

League college, spent the last ten

years working long weeks and

drinking all weekend and you feel

like it's time to do something

"spiritual." Nice to meet you,

(looks at the card) Paul.

Celeste walks away. Paul remains where he is, flummoxed.

Celeste enters through her side gate. She has some Chinese

takeout in her hand. She heads for the studio. She sees that

Jesse is not there. Neither is any of his shit. It's

completely empty and sterile now. He's gone.

Celeste is about to go on the road for work. She is on the

phone.

No, just make sure the San Fran

focus group has a little more

diversity than last time. It was

like a rave. Without drugs. Okay.

She hangs up and pauses. Then dials again.

35.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Hey, Jess, it's me. I'm getting on

a plane but I'd really like to talk

to you. I don't know what happened

last night. Hope you're okay. Call

me.

We see Celeste having lunch with a group of eight teenagers.

She asks questions, they share laughs, she engages with them.

She is good at this. She excuses herself to make a phone

call.

Celeste watches CNN alone. She dials Jesse. It rings.

Jesse is mid-laugh and looks at his phone to see Celeste is

calling. He presses "Ignore." We see that he is sitting with

a women. We reveal that it is: Veronica.

I'm glad you called.

Jesse smiles big.

Hey. It's me. Again. I miss you.

Anyway, call me. Okay. Bye.

She hangs up, takes a breath and then, to herself:

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I love you. I'm so sorry. I've

always loved you.

She chuckles.

36.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Of course. Stupid.

Jesse is walking.

(on the phone) Hey. You're back. I

want to talk to you.

Celeste is in her home office, working on the Riley account.

Yeah, I want to talk to you too.

Where have you been?? It's been

like two weeks. So much to lay

down...like, did you know that pay-

per-view porn is available in

Cantonese?

Really? Like subtitles or dubbed?

Wait, actually, I'm really close to

your house right now. Can I come

by for a minute? It's....important.

Celeste puts away groceries.

Okay. I have to tell you something.

Me too. Wait, you first. Are you

gay?

No, not gay.

He takes a really deep breath.

37.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Um, you're not gonna believe this

but...

(playfully) Oh no, did you go on

another date?

I'm having a baby.

I don't understand.

I'm having a baby.

What do you mean?

I am having a baby.

With another person?

Yes. With another person.

Um. What? Sorry, I'm confused.

Wait, what? What the fuck? With

whom?

With Veronica.

Veronica?? What's a Veronica?

You actually met her. That day at

the book store.

38.

Huh. But that's not even

physically possible, that was two

weeks ago.

Well, the truth is, I slept with

Veronica three months ago. It was

just a one night thing. But she's

pregnant.

Whoa. Okay. Shit. Didn't know about

that. But that's not important

right now. This is not good.

Alright. Okay. You and I are gonna

deal with this. We will, we'll just

have to. What do you need me to do?

No, you don't have to do anything.

But you don't even know this

person, right?

Yeah I know her. I mean, I'm

getting to know her. And I really

want to make it work with her.

Make it work?? You slept with her

once! What are you talking about?

I've actually been seeing her,

well, a lot, recently. And I think

I really like her.

So what you're saying is you got a

girl pregnant and now you think you

like her because she's pregnant?

Or...I'm really confused.

The universe is fucking weird,

Celeste. I slept with her months

ago and never called her after.

39.

But we started hanging recently and

she told me she was pregnant with

my child. I know it's crazy, but

it just feels...right. It was like

this really weird retroactive gift.

I don't know...

Can you excuse me for a second?

Celeste gets up and walks slowly to the bathroom. She gently

shuts the door. She looks around, not knowing what to do with

herself. She focuses on a crack in the wall, she looks closer

and then grabs the wall, thinking she might faint. She

silently begins to sob, mouth open, eyes shut tight. She

collapses on the wall. She is in silent turmoil. Is this

really happening?

Jesse is sitting, waiting. He checks his cell phone. He hears

the toilet flush. A moment goes by. Celeste re-enters,

having pulled it together. But her face is still wet with

tears.

Sorry about that. I had something

in my eye.

Right. Look, I know this is so

sudden. And so weird. I've been

holding on to us, this idea of us,

for so long. And I know you've

wanted me to let go. So I'm sorry.

You were right, we're friends. We

will always be friends. And I need

that now.

Of course.

Thank you. Love you.

Jesse gives Celeste a big, long hug.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Wait, you had something to tell me

too. Sorry...

40.

Celeste takes a beat.

It was nothing.

She forces a smile.

Celeste is on the computer. She drinks coffee. Scott peeks

in.

Hello?

Hey.

Celeste lets out a guffaw.

What are you doing?

I'm just following Diddy Twitty.

I don't...know what that means.

It's Sean Comb's Twitter page.

There's also a singing competition

on television. It's called American

Idol? Keep up.

Okay saucy. You don't have to be so

saucy.

Well, just part of our job,

so...ready for breaking news? Jesse

is having a baby with some girl.

Crazy.

Whoa. Wow. Did you even know he was

seeing someone?

It's this girl he slept with once a

couple of months ago.

41.

And now he's "making it work" with

her. Plane crash.

I don't know what to say. I am so

sorry, Celeste.

No need, Scott, I'm totally fine.

Are you?

Look, I wasn't going to have his

baby. So, good for him.

Well, it's great that you're so

resolved about this but it's also

okay for you to have feelings. It's

very sudden.

Right. Well, let me see...mmmm,

nope, I'm fine. I promise. Not in

love with him anymore. It kind of

makes it easier.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Oh my god, Diddy's snowboarding for

the first time in Mammoth! Amazing.

I actually have a date tonight.

Um...that's great. Who's the guy?

The yahoo who did Pop Form's taxes

last quarter. He's been asking me

out forever. Not the one, but it'll

be nice to be admired.

I agree, go be admired. Who knows,

you may actually even simulate

human emotion.

42.

Celeste, in workout clothes, is cleaning up her house

maniacally. She is walking past her office. The Ikea robot

she built with Jesse catches her attention for a moment. She

keeps walking.

Celeste and MAX, 38, handsome and clean cut, are sitting at

dinner. They have just ordered.

Thank you.

She hands the menu back to the waiter.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

My foot actually pronates. And my

I.T. band is strained when I run,

which really hurts. So Dr. Ozar

recommended a foot specialist who

made these customized orthotics for

me and it's amazing how much better

I feel.

Well, actually I...

Suddenly, Celeste catches a glimpse of Jesse, sitting at the

bar, by himself, watching tv. She is not prepared for this.

OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god,

oh no, we just made eye contact.

Maybe he didn't see me. Wait, he

did. He's coming over. Oh god,

this is so awkward.(to Max) You

should probably leave.

Wait, what? I don't think...really?

Yeah, just go.

Jesse is at the table.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Too late. Here he is, heyyyy.

I just wanted to say hi. I'm Jesse.

43.

Oh, this is Matt.

Max.

Mack.

Max.

Nice to meet you, Max.

We're just here. Just eating. It's

a date. I'm dating.

Cool. The puttanesca special is the

thing to get.

Good to know. I ordered that.

Who are you here with?

Oh, just here alone. Watching the

Lakers.

Kobe-LeBron tonight, right?

Yes. Epic.

So psyched I tivo'ed it.

Nice to meet you, man. Good to see

you, C.

He's cool.

44.

Uh huh.

Celeste immediately scarfs down her salad which has just

arrived. She's quiet.

How was that? Are you okay?

I'm fine!

Celeste stares at Jesse at the bar.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

He always loved the meatballs here.

What?

Nothing. Do you like bread?

Bread? Um, yeah, I like bread.

Cool, cool.

Silence, once again.

Celeste and Max wait for their cars at the valet stand. Max's

car arrives. He pays the valet.

This was great! I'm free next

Wednesday? Sushi?

Um, I don't think we should.

Oh, because of mercury poisoning? I

think that's a myth. I go to this

acupuncturist that...

45.

No, I think you may need some time.

To get over, you know, your

divorce. It took me a long time to

start dating after mine.

Thank you for your concern but I'm

just fine. I guess you're just not

a match for me.

Well, have a good night. Good luck.

Max gets in his car and is gone. Celeste stands there,

confused and alone. She shakes him off.

(sotto) Whatever.

Celeste is running...hard. It is a cacophony of street sounds

around her: traffic, honking, speeding, Celeste listens to

the Dirty Projectors "Stillness is the Move" on her iPod and

joyfully runs across the street.

Celeste arrives to meet Beth. She is in full marathon gear.

She waves at Beth and enters, panting.

Hi honey!

Hi, wow, you are really out of

breath. Did you fucking run here??

From West Hollywood??

Yeah I ran. Just started. It's

really fun.

You're soaking wet. Isn't that like

12 miles??

13.5 actually. I was just clearing

my head, you know, keeping the

endorphins up.

46.

Celeste pants like she's about to collapse. She doubles over

with her hands on her knees. She's in pain.

Do you...want to sit down?

Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? It's so

nice.

Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman

approaches.

I'm so sorry but that's a one-of-a-

kind piece that was handwoven by a

tribe of Afghani women. So if you

could maybe just sit over there?

The saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable

looking chair.

Right. Sorry. Totally.

Wow, you are a sweat tsunami.

You should get it. It's really

pretty.

Celeste gets up and there is an outline of Celeste's entire

body in sunblock and sweat. They look at the wreckage.

Uh boy.

Don't worry. I know people who can

get that out. Easily.

Okay. I guess I'm getting it.

The saleswoman is ringing Beth up for the couch. It is

basically ruined.

The Riley account is a handful.

I've been sooooo swamped.

47.

It's great you're staying busy...

(about the couch) If it doesn't

come out, I can have it

reupholstered.

Thanks. How's dating?

Sorry, can I get your card?

Here you go.

Great. Dating's really great.

Have you talked to Jesse?

No, but I actually ran into him

last night. I think he's getting a

little fat.

I think he's been looking pretty

fit lately. (to the saleswoman) Can

I get a rush delivery on that?

So you've seen Jesse?

...Yeah, I have.

Huh. Have you hung out with...

Veronica?

Yeah.

Yes. I have.

48.

So, my first available delivery is

Monday afternoon. Does that work

for you?

Yeah, that's fine. If you can you

just call my cell...

She's dumb, right?

Huh? Oh no, not dumb. Simple.

Simple means dumb.

No, actually, simple in a really

elegant way.

Elegant??

Okay, so you're all set then.

Elegant??

Thanks a lot. (to Celeste)

BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I thought you would be happy for

him.

I am, I just didn't realize that

Monica was "elegant."

Veronica. And you know what? You

would probably really like her.

49.

BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD)

You're not having regrets about

Jesse?

Not one.

Please let me drive you home. I'm

afraid you'll drown.

Sure. I have a date tonight so I

should probably shower before then.

Beth looks at a sopping Celeste.

Yes. Shower. Who's the date?

Rupert Bates.

Rupert Bates? The Gap model?? Oh my

god, he's so hot but he's like 15.

22. Skillz set me up. He's about

to be a huge star. He's filming

"20,000 B.C.?" It's the prequel to

"10,000 B.C."

Fuck, I LOVED that movie.

I loved that movie too! It really

spoke to me.

RUPERT BATES, 22, very handsome, British, wearing a leather

jacket, sporting tousled actor hair is playing a hideously

earnest original song on the guitar. He sings with passion.

He looks up at Celeste and winks.

Celeste,on the couch, looking slightly mortified. She smiles

tepidly at him.

50.

Rupert finishes the song, closes his eyes and hangs his head.

A beat of silence. Celeste musters up a short and slow round

of applause.

That was so...good.

I wrote that for my mum.

Lucky lady. So how do you know

Skillz?

He provides me with the happy smoky

green treats.

(sotto) Ew.

Celeste cringes. What a dork. Rupert slides next to Celeste

and is all of a sudden right in her face. He touches her

hair. He kisses her, deeply. He pulls away and takes her in.

Hello, Special One.

Oh...hi. Oh god. (whispers) Oh no,

no, no I gotta go.

People file out of the conference room. Celeste walks down

the hall quickly to the bathroom.

Celeste enters a stall. Then, she hears two girls enter the

bathroom. RILEY, 19 and SAVANNAH, 22, are chatting and

primping. Celeste goes quiet and listens.

Ugh. My hair is so dry. It looks

like straw.

Savannah quickly pops a pill. Then offers one to Riley.

Here. Do you want an Adderall?

51.

No, that shit makes me feel like a

robot. Speaking of robot, who the

hell designed this place? It's

like Spock and his eyebrows are

about to walk around the corner.

Hi Riley, I'm Celeste, I'm a

partner at Pop Form.

Hey. Wow, you're pretty.

RILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Why am I breaking out?

Too much sugar? Coffee? Alcohol?

Ugh, maybe it's my skin regime.

Um...it's actually regimen?

Sorry?

Regime is a system of government.

It's a "skin regimen."

Thanks, Scrabble. Nice to meet you.

Charming.

52.

The Riley Banks branding strategy meeting is under way.

Slides are being shown, Scott is giving a presentation on

design ideas. Celeste is distracted and on her Blackberry.

We see an INSERT of Celeste's Blackberry on Dictionary.com,

looking up "regime: a mode or system of rule or government."

Celeste has some ideas for the logo

which are looking really great.

He looks to Celeste who is not paying attention. She is busy

learning that she was right and Riley was wrong. Celeste

looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at Riley. Riley

catches her and looks away uncomfortably.

SCOTT (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Celeste? Do you wanna...

Right. Yes. Sorry. So we are going

for an industrial feel with the

artwork...

Scott enters.

Hello, Special One.

Uh, you got my IM.

Sounds so awful.

Where are the guys who don't wear

makeup for a living? And maybe a

little intellect? A little

intellect wouldn't hurt anybody.

Scott has an idea.

Wait, wait. You've never met Nick,

right? Nick Moran?

The photographer? You know him?

53.

Yeah, we went to school together.

This could be perfect.

(she sings, like she's in a

musical) I'm uncomfortable with

daaaaaating. I don't like any of

iiiiiit.

(he sings back) Trust meeeee. You

will liiiiike hiiiim. Also, I love

cooo-ooock.

You really got to try a little

harder to integrate the gayness,

Scott.

Celeste sits on the balcony with Nick Moran. He has Indy

rocker hair and a Los Feliz beard. He's hip and smart in an

effortless way. Celeste is feeling him. They drink wine and

laugh.

So you pissed in your pants?

I waited seven hours. Three of them

soaking in my own pee. But I

finally got the shot of

Ahmadinejad.

He hands her a photograph.

Wow. That is incredible. I think

he's smiling, maybe.

He is. I think the piss stain

running down my jeans made him

laugh.

Well, the world will think you're

brilliant. No one will ever know

but me.

54.

I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I

didn't win.

Well, the guy who won shit his

pants, so...

They laugh. They are connecting.

(looking at his watch) Oh my god,

we missed our reservation. It was

at 8:30. Should I call down and see

if they can still take us?

How about room service?

Perfect.

Nick and Celeste are kissing. It's passionate but tender.

They stop and their foreheads rest against each other's and

they take a deep breath. They speak in hushed tones.

That was really, really nice.

Um, yeah. So, what are you doing

for the rest of your life?

Making out with you.

They start to kiss again.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I don't remember it ever feeling

like this.

They continue to kiss. Celeste notices that she and the couch

are vibrating. She looks down. Oh no. Nick is masturbating.

Can he really be masturbating?

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

(whisper)What are you doing?

55.

(whisper)What do you think

I'm doing?

(whisper) Why are you doing that?

Don't do that..It was going so

well.

Shhhhh.

Celeste pulls away slowly, shaking her head, "no." Nick keeps

going. Eyes closed.

NICK (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Watch me. I'm almost there.

Celeste cannot believe what she is watching.

Almost where?? No!

Celeste quickly grabs her stuff and gets the hell out of

dodge.

Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhh!

Nick recovers from his climax and looks around to realize

she's gone.

NICK (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Celeste?

Celeste runs really hard, listening to her Sunny Levine's

"Glass Jaw" on her iPhone. She stops suddenly. She sees

Jesse's number, she hits "Ignore." She starts running again

with purpose.

Celeste drives and listen to her phone on bluetooth.

JESSE V.O.

Hey, so, I'm glad you can meet up.

4pm is good. There's this little

place by me, Vegan Vittles on

Elysian Way, kinda hard to find,

call me if you get lost.

56.

Vegan Vittles.

Celeste enters and sees Jesse sitting at a table in a small,

folksy restaurant. Celeste is on the phone. She waves at

Jesse and gestures "one second."

No, I don't want to do a video

chat. Yeah. Just tell her she needs

to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she

hangs up, now on the Blackberry)

Sorry, one second, I just have to

send this e-mail.

Jesse sits there and wait for several seconds for her to

finish her e-mail.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

There. Hi.

Hi. What's up?

A lot. (to waitress) Can I get some

coffee?

We have yerba matte?

Um, green tea?

We have decaf green tea.

Water's fine.

K. Anything for you?

I'll get the veganchilada with the

cashew cheese sauce on the side. Oh

can I look at the seaweed menu?

She hands him a tiny piece of recycled paper.

57.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Oh. Awesome. You do have the Baltic

kelp today. I'll get that. Thanks.

Wow.

How are you? You look great.

Thanks.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Are you wearing...dress shoes?

Oh yeah, they're vegan.

You look good too.

A lot of pilates.

Huh, I didn't know you did pilates.

Yeah, well, Veronica's a dancer and

has equipment at our house, so...

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

How's work?

Um...work is great.

Good.

My book is getting great reviews.

Riley Banks is a new client which

is huge. Things are going really

well.

58.

Great.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Listen, I know this has all been

pretty weird.

It's only weird if you think it's

weird.

Celeste, I never wanted to hurt

you.

Thank you. You didn't. Glad we

cleared that up.

Look, I actually wanted to see you

because...apparently there's some

kind of hold up on your side with

the divorce papers and Veronica's

actually not a citizen so..

What? Where's she from?

Uh, Belgium.

(sotto) Huh. Belgium. Elegant.

What?

Nothing.

Point is, we need to...get married.

I'm sorry. I really need you to

sign those papers.

Well, Jesse, I've been busy with

work. Because some people work for

a living. So I haven't really been

focused on what I can do to help

you get on with your new life.

59.

I'm sorry. I know.

What makes you think you are even

suitable to be a dad?? You don't

even know how to read the electric

bill. How are you going to support

yourself? Have you even thought

this through?

I guess I'll have to figure it out.

Veronica is really supportive of my

work.

Really? Really Jesse? I paid the

rent for ten years. If that's not

supportive, I don't know what is.

That's true. And thank you.

We never even talked about kids.

You had reservations about having

kids.

I had reservations about having

kids with YOU.

Well, ditto. I think Veronica will

be a really good mother.

Low blow.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I'll sign the fucking papers. I

don't have time for this. You're

ridiculous, this place is

ridiculous. Fucking vegan kelp

cashew bullshit. What the fuck is

this place anyway.

60.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

(she addresses the restaurant) Do

any of you have jobs?? Anyone? What

do you do? Wait, let me guess. You

grow pot.

Celeste looks at an innocent bespectacled patron.

Um, yeah. I do.

Exactly. Get a real job.

Celeste exits.

Celeste is in her robe about to get in the bath. She walks to

the kitchen to grab a tea and walks by her office. The Ikea

Robot catches her eye. She stops and enters the office.

Celeste stares at the robot. It stares back. She hates it.

She kicks it. That hurt. She violently, with all her might,

rips its head off. That felt good. She picks it up and starts

to thrash the robot torso all over the room as, slowly,

pieces of wood flail in every direction. She's angry and out

of control. She stops to catch her breath and sees what she

has just done. She falls to the ground in tears.

Celeste and Beth enter and survey the scene. Beth is dressed

like a little boy with a short brown wig, sunglasses and

sneakers. Celeste is in a white trash bag with a belt.

Jesse's a fucking vegan??

A vegan who's soon to have his work

shown. At the Gagosian.

The Gagosian?? You're kidding.

What, the fucking clothespin thing?

When??

61.

Don't tell me actually...how did

anybody even know about his art, he

doesn't...I don't actually want to

know...god, he's on fire right now.

Breaking up with me was the best

thing that ever happened to Jesse.

I should break up with me.

Now, now. Someone else's success

is not your demise, C.

Shut up. Unless it's Jesse's. Who

are dressed as again?

Beiber.

Ooh, he just got a buzzcut.

Really? Fuck. When??

A couple hours ago. It was on

Perez.

That's so sad. His hair was

everything.

I need to fucking drink.

We're doing Car Bombs in the

kitchen. Wanna come?

Noooo.

YES.

62.

Celeste is drilling Car Bombs with 5 guys. She's keeping

pace.

What are you?

What? Oh, White trash.

Snow White is silent. Celeste points to her trash bag.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

White trash?

(doesn't get it) Huh.

Paul (from yoga) enters to grab some ice from the freezer. He

is wearing a black shirt covered in mini cereal boxes with

plastic knives through them. Celeste is mid-Car Bomb and

wasted.

Celeste?

Yoga?

Yeah, I haven't seen you there for

a while.

I've been running a lot. Keeps you

in better shape.

I can see that's important to you.

(referring to the Car Bomb in her

Celeste is now drunk.

How's your practice? (waving her

finger in his face, laughing)

White trash?

Uh huh. What are you?

63.

Um, a cereal killer, obviously.

You're "punny."

By the way, you were right.

About what?

About me. All of it, the car, the

phone, the yoga. Except that I did

go to an Ivy League school.

Cornell.

Barely an Ivy.

I know.

Do you smoke?

At parties.

Me too. Let's go.

Celeste and Paul sit away from the party, smoking cigarettes.

(Playful) Sorry about that day at

the gym. I feel really open after

yoga...

Shhhh. Don't say open. Your

costume's great. Don't ruin it.

I'm kidding. I only go to yoga to

meet girls. Speaking of, what's the

deal with you and me? Is this

happening? Or...

64.

My husband of six years wants a

divorce so he can marry the woman

who's carrying his child. That's

the deal with you and me.

I'm sorry, that sounds tough.

He's having a baby with a girl he

barely knows. He's so lost. He's

just going about it all...wrong.

And you're right. Now what?

What do you mean?

Well do you want to be right or do

you want to be happy?

Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be

right, I AM right. People will let

you down. I've accepted that fact,

but unfortunately, most of the

time, knowing that does keep you

from being happy. But at least

it's real.

No one has ever given a more self-

righteous monologue wearing only a

trash bag. Except for maybe the

homeless guy outside my dry

cleaners.

Time to go, drunky.

(yells to Celeste) Call me!

65.

Celeste is going through papers on her desk. She's cleaning

house. She sees the envelope from the divorce lawyer. She

quickly tosses it aside. Then she comes across one of Jesse's

old notebooks. She flips through it. She reads a couple of

sweet passages about her, it makes her smile. She grabs the

phone.

Hey, it's Celeste. You know, I

still have a bunch of your stuff in

the office. You should probably

grab it at some point. Okay.

She hangs up. She makes a decision. She grabs a box and

starts throwing everything and anything in it that belongs to

Jesse.

Celeste carries a box of Jesse's stuff to his front door.

She doesn't knock. She leaves the box by the door. But she

decides to keep the one journal with the sweet passages for

herself; she deserves it and he'll never know. She starts to

walk away when she notices, it's trash day.

Jesse drives and Veronica is in the passenger seat. They are

quiet and content. They look at each other and smile. After a

You're going to be a really good

dad.

What? Why did you say that?

Veronica studies Jesse's face.

I don't know, I just know it.

No one's ever said that to me.

66.

Three trash cans-green, brown, and blue-are lined up in the

driveway. A huge box is protruding from the blue can.

Celeste considers. So much to be learned from the trash. She

slowly walks over. She peeks in at the box; it has a big

picture of a fancy stroller on the side of it. Crushing.

At least they recycle.

Veronica looks out the window.

This is...so weird but I just

realized...what's your middle name?

I don't even know it.

They laugh a little.

It's um...Godelieve.

Goldleaf?

No, Goldelieve. It means loved by

the Gods. It's Dutch.

Sweet. Mine's Mordechai.

What does it mean?

Means I'm really Jewish.

Veronica giggles. They're getting to know each other. It's

awkward...but sweet.

Celeste is still digging in the trash. She looks further

down.

67.

Guitar Hero?? That's quite an

extravagant purchase for a

freelance writer and his "elegant"

Belgian bride.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Shit. Shit shit shit.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Ow!!! Shit!

Celeste?

Hey!

What...are you doing?

I just...

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Um...came over to drop off some of

your stuff.

But why were you in the trash can?

I lost something.

68.

In the trash can?

My bracelet. It was a whole thing.

It's over now.

You've met Veronica, right?

Yes! Hi! Wow, you're so pregnant,

right! I love your sweater.

Oh. Thanks! (beat) Are you

bleeding?

What? Oh (she touches her cheek),

yeah, I guess I am.

Let me get you something for that.

NO. No, don't. It's fine, just a

little cut.

Are you sure? I'm so sorry about

this.

No, I'm sorry. So sorry. Well, I'm

late for things. Have a good

afternight.

You sure you don't want to come in

for a drink?

Nooooo, no. That's very nice but

no. Great to see you guys! Okay.

Is that mine?

69.

Waht? Oh, yeah, that's weird. I

don't know how...here you go.

She laughs nervously and hands him his journal. Celeste

walks to her car.

Celeste listen to her work messages on speakerphone as she

Instant Messenger's with Beth. Celeste writes "I went through

Jesse's trash last night. Oh no." Beth writes back, "I'm

coming to your office right now."

PAUL (V.O.)

Hey. Celeste. It's Paul. The cereal

killer? There's this yoga retreat

in Tulum that I just got an e-mail

about...uh, that's not why I'm

really calling. I just like you.

Call me back if you want to drink

some cold beer with me. 310 864-

2120.

Celeste and Beth eat lunch in the zen garden outside the Pop

Form building. Celeste is picking at the end of her sandwich,

recounting the waking nightmare of last night. The cut on her

face is neatly bandaged.

You told her you liked her sweater?

What are you, twelve?

It was a disaster. But you should

have seen the sweater. So great.

Beth, am I losing my mind?

Maybe. No. Please no more trash-

diving. Let's focus on you now.

This guys Paul keeps calling me but

I don't know...

C, you never know. Just go out with

him. It doesn't have to be

perfect...

70.

I met him at the gym. I'm not

meeting my husband at the gym.

Just go. Nothing to lose.

Celeste is lying in a quiet, dark room in thai fisherman

pants and a large t-shirt. She takes a deep breath.

So where do you live?

We reveal that she is lying next to Paul, they are both about

to get thai massages.

Uh, I live in Westwood. In a condo.

Cool.

You are gonna love this place.

You've never felt so relaxed in

your life.

Cherry and Lucky enter, the masseuses. They all exchange

quiet hellos and head nods. Cherry and Lucky get to work.

Lucky takes Celeste's leg and pushes it all the way over her

head, not the most comfortable position.

Ahhhhh.(responding to the stretch)

Wow, this is a unique place to take

a date.

Yeah, I take all my dates here.

I feel special.

You are. They all are.

Celeste giggles. Paul takes a deep exhale as Cherry rams her

elbow into his shoulderblade.

71.

PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)

So how is being right about

everything going for you?

Not...that well. I've been on a

real winning streak, so I thought

I'd call you.

You know what? I'm happy you did.

At that moment, CRACK! Lucky has Celeste in a bear hug and it

looks like she may have broken her back.

AHHHH! I don't know what your

definition of relaxing is but...

Just wait. Trust me, you need this

right now.

Celeste and Paul exit. He has a huge smile on his face. She

looks like she's in pain.

Why would you take me to a place

where Asian people beat you up?

That was absolute torture.

But how do you feel?

Celeste takes a beat to see how she feels.

I feel great, actually.

So shut up then.

Where are we going now?

Don't try to control me. You need

to let go. In yoga, we call it

vairyaga.

He strikes a reverse triangle yoga pose in the parking lot.

72.

Oh my god, don't, with the yoga.

Celeste and Paul walk down stairs into an incredibly cool-

looking speak easy. Teddy Pendegrass' "Love TKO" is playing

and people are dancing, actually dancing. No one is there to

be seen, there is no pretention.

This place is...really cool.

You sound surprised.

I am, Westwood condo.

I'll get us beers.

Celeste takes in the atmosphere for a moment. She is happy to

be out. She takes her hair down, puts her hands through it,

trying to look a little better.

PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Hey!

Paul is on the dance floor, with two beers. Celeste meets

him, takes her beer, and downs a third of it. Celeste looks

up and Paul has started to dance. He looks at Celeste with

jocular seduction. He's actually not a bad dancer. Maybe he's

good? Okay, no, he's great. Paul pulls Celeste in and they

dance together. She's sort of embarrassed but she's having

fun. Paul pulls away in a little spin and goes into a James

Brown splits move.

Ohh!!

Celeste is into it now. She dances around him, other people

watch them. Paul pulls Celeste in close. Celeste kisses Paul

quickly, to his surprise.

What was that for?

Vairyaga, bro, let go. Not

everything has to have a reason.

73.

They smile at each other.

Jesse, Skillz and Tucker with their arms up, cheering loudly.

Jesse, Skillz and Tucker are taking in a high school

cheerleading practice, drinking tall boys and smoking cigs.

Despite their ragtag appearance, do not be fooled...They are

very loyal and knowledgable supporters.

Oooh...toe touch basket toss coming

up...degree of difficulty 9.

Gnarly.......nailed it! Way to go,

Becky!!!

Jesse is look at his iPhone. He is looking at "Veronica and

Jesse Baby Registry"

What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn?

It's a very, very tiny Swedish man.

It's a baby carrier that allows

your child to benefit from parental

intimacy without the confinement of

a stroller. Duh.

Why do you know that.

Beth. We go to a lot of baby

showers.

I put a lot of babies in the

ladies.

A parent of a cheerleader looks at trio with disgust. Jesse

is still going through the registry list.

74.

Birthing towels, breast pump,

Diaper genie? Fuck, I'm definitely

having a baby. (beat) How's

Celeste?

She's...oh-kay. I'm fine-tuning her

cannibus levels right now, just

trying to find the right balance.

Celeste doesn't smoke pot.

She does now. She loves it.

How's Veronica? She's so sweet.

Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's

probably just hormones.

But are you into it?

Yeah, I really like her. She seems

great. For someone that I don't

really know that's having my baby.

MY JAM!

Are you scared?

A little. Yes.

That's great. You should be. Just

keep saying "yes." I'm really proud

of you.

75.

Skillz looks at his cell phone. He shows Jesse a text from

Celeste that reads, "I need green. Now."

She's like my top client now.

Celeste is home from her date with Paul and is now obsessing

on Jesse's Facebook page. His status reads "in a

relationship." She's drunk and this makes her sad. Oh,

there's a video. It's of Jesse and Veronica. Jesse presents

Veronica with a cake, she laughs and blows out the candles.

They kiss. Crushing. Confusing. Her doorbell rings.

The door opens to reveal Skillz. He holds up a bag of weed.

Step out of the shadows and into

the light. Are you crying?

I don't know what I'm doing. Dating

is stupid and all of a sudden, my

ex-husband bakes cakes? It's

probably fucking gluten-free.

What?

Nothing. Can you just roll a joint

please?

Skillz rolls a tight joint.

Day by day, C. You need not trip.

Celeste takes a drag.

What are they like together?

Who? Jesse and Veronica?

76.

Yeah.

You know, they're oh-kay. Jesse is

trying. It's not all rainbows and

unicorns but...

So he's not happy.

I didn't say that.

Pop Form employees file out of a Riley Banks meeting. Riley

approaches Celeste.

I really like the logo.

Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think it's

perfect.

The I.M. Pei influence is pretty

cool.

Wow, yeah, there is a little of

that happening. I.M. Pei. Huh.

Are you mocking me?

No, I'm just impressed that you

know anything about architecture.

Why, because I'm a pop star? You

know what your thing is? Contempt

prior to investigation.

I'm sorry?

You're convinced you're smarter

than everyone and THAT is your

dark little prison.

77.

Are you...?? How dare you...

Riley smiles at Celeste, turns and leaves.

Celeste is still reeling from Riley's verbal undressing.

Dark little prison?? Bitch, what

does she know. You know what's a

dark little prison?? Having to wear

midriffs for a living. What does

she...

Celeste is pulling into her driveway and notices...Jesse,

sitting on her porch, smoking a cigarette.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

What the fuck.

Celeste cautiously walks up to her front door. Before she can

speak, Jesse does.

I started smoking again.

I can see that. That must go well

with your pilates.

Jesse looks sad and confused.

I don't know what the rules are and

I'm sure I'm breaking them

but...god, I really miss you.

Celeste tries to digest this.

You want to come in?

They are in her living room on the couch, have a drink.

78.

Veronica is friends with the

assistant gallerist there and he

just really loved my stuff. I

don't know, we'll see...

Jesse, that's great. I'm so happy

for you.

Yeah, yeah. It's great.

Why doesn't he seem happier? He knocks back the rest of the

drink.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I should probably get home.

Yeah. It's really nice to see you.

He hugs her. Tight. They breathe together. They hug

tighter. He pulls away, looks at her and kisses her for one

second, very tenderly. She pulls away.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

You should go.

Can we just...lay here for a bit?

Celeste lays down and Jesse spoons behind her on the couch.

They hold each other. There's a long drag of silence.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I can't believe I'm having a

baby...and it's not with you.

We see Celeste's face but Jesse doesn't. She's crying.

The phone rings. It's early. Celeste, still in her clothes

from the night before, wakes up. Jesse is gone. She fumbles

for the phone.

Yeah.

79.

We have a massive problem on our

hands. I need you in the office.

Now.

INSERT of a large, magnified version of Riley's "RB" logo. It

is pretty clear what the image looks like. Scott stares at

Celeste, waiting for her to freak out.

I don't see anything.

(referring to the logo) It's a

penis. And a butt.

What? Really? I don't see it.

You can't be serious. (points to

the logo) There's the penis. And

there's the penis going into the

butt.

I think it's a stretch.

Well, it's not a stretch, Celeste.

Scott puts a DVD into the DVD player. A reel of news clips

comes on.

...teenagers were hoping to get a

little bit of the teen star's

fashion magic but instead, they

have been suprised by what they

saw.

There's homosexual butt sex in the

logo. Does Riley think we're that

stupid?? I will never support gay

marriage.

80.

Neither Riley nor a representative

from Pop Form-the marketing company

responsible-could be reached for

comment.

Scott turns it off.

Celeste, what did you do. How

could be so careless?

Celeste picks up the magnified logo again.

Oh. Oh my God. Oh wow, I totally

see it now. WOW. Ha. Haha.

Hahahahaaha.

Celeste starts laughing uncontrollably. It's the funniest

thing she's ever seen.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

It's a cock in a butt!!!

Hahahaahaaa!!

(fuming)Stop it. Stop laughing.

Scott, come on...

No, this is not a joke. Our

company's in serious danger.

You're being dramatic.

Get out. I can't, with you, right

now. I have to deal with this. I'll

call you soon.

Her laughter fades and she exits the conference room.

Bon Iver's "Skinny Love" plays as Celeste walks slowly

amongst the celebrity impersonators, tourists and drunks on

the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

81.

It is intercut with a montage of Super 8 footage of Celeste

and Jesse in the past: At a seaside house, Jesse is

reluctantly cutting a head off a fish to cook it, Celeste is

repulsed but laughing. Celeste and Jesse cuddle in a sleeping

bag, fighting off the cold. Celeste and Jesse take cover in a

torrential New York City rain. They stand under an awning and

she smiles as she runs her hand through his wet hair. Celeste

is abruptly shaken out of her memories by a giant Chewbacca

hugging her before she has a chance to stop him.

No...okay.

We see Jesse sitting at the dive bar. Celeste enters and

sits next to Jesse. She is happy to see him.

Hey.

Hey.

We gotta talk.

I know. That's why I called.

Celeste...

Wait, let me say something. I

don't know what happened last

night. I don't know what's

happening with your other

situation. But I need to say this.

For the record, I fucked up. I was

cavalier about you. I took us for

granted. And I know this may sound

crazy but I'd be remiss if I

didn't...if you were open to it...I

think that I could do better. With

you. With us. If there's a chance

still...I'd like to know.

Jesse can't even look at her.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Jesse?

82.

I'm sorry. I can't.

Jesse gets up and leaves.

Jesse walks out of the bar. He takes a deep breath and starts

walking. A beat later, Celeste tears out of the bar, walking

quickly after Jesse.

Hey!

Jesse pauses for a moment. He turns.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Why did you come to my house last

night?

I don't know.

Oh no, I think you do.

I made a mistake.

And?

I shouldn't have come.

You're a fucking coward.

I'm just trying to do the right

thing with Veronica. I'm trying to

change.

Well, you never changed for me.

Jesse pauses.

To be honest, you didn't really let

me.

83.

Wow. All I did was wait for you to

grow up! I rooted for you, I

fucking paid for everything, I did

everything for you!

Yeah, and I was never your equal.

And you know what? I think you

preferred it that way.

Right. Well, I know my success was

never easy for you.

And how do you define success,

Celeste? Because you don't look

very successful right now.

And you are? Pretending to be a

father? Pretending to be an adult?

What do you want?

I just want you to admit that

you're wrong!

Wrong? Wrong about what? What did

you want me to do? Wait for you to

meet someone first? Is that how you

saw it happening?

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I didn't expect to meet someone so

fast, but I did. And I think we

have a chance to be happy together.

I don't want to blow that.

You know what, Jesse? You

definitely will blow it.

I feel really sorry for you. You

might be alone forever.

84.

He starts to walk away. Celeste call after him.

Don't ever call me.

Don't worry about it.

Jesse walks away.

Skillz and Celeste sit in her backyard and watch the last

scene from "Dirty Dancing." The image is being projected onto

her garden wall. There is no sound. Instead, Bob Marley's

"Kaya" plays over the speakers. Celeste is ripping an

enormous bowl from a four-foot bong. Skillz is on his knees,

bracing the bong, looking at Celeste with admiration. Celeste

watches the movie.

She's so sad.

Is she? I don't think so.

No, she's sad. I can tell. I went

to dance camp.

We see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking

elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

That's the first good thing that's

happened to me in months.

Shit'll get better.

Will it? You don't know that.

Celeste grabs a handful of Cheetos from an economy-sized bag.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

How could he do this to me?

J-Thunder? He's not doing anything

to you. You wanted a divorce.

85.

But I didn't want it like this.

When we are no longer able to

change a situation, we are

challenged to change ourselves.

Huh?

Oh. It's Victor Frankl.

Huh.

I gotta go before Petco closes.

You have a pet?

No, but I gotta get a toy for this

girl's cat, you know, so she'll

give up the kitty.

Can I come?

No.

Will you bring me some Panda

Express?

No.

Do you think the Obamas are really

in love?

Yes. Enough questions. I'll pick

you up at noon.

Noon?

86.

Beth and Tucker's pre-wedding BBQ?

Right, right.

Hey, easy on the herb until then.

That shit is powerful.

Celeste is sitting alone, wearing sunglasses, and

uncharacteristically colorful clothes that don't match. Like

a crazy lady jumpsuit. She is going to town on a HUGE plate

of food: chicken wings, fries, burger, hot dog, coleslaw, egg

salad and a beer. She attacks it like it's her last meal

ever. She's also trashed. Celeste gets up and heads towards a

group of people talking including, Beth's mom, Beth and a

couple of her girlfriends.

Hi honey, you remember Eileen

from...

Do you have any more of that ranch

dressing? It's the fucking

booooooomb.

Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beth's mom, CAROL, 60,

very large, a big sloppy hug.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Hi Carol! Beth's getting married! I

was married, remember? These guys

are in for a fucking dogfight,

right?

Beth pulls Celeste away.

Let's get you a soda.

They get to the bar.

Do you guys have any tequila?

We only have Mimosas and Shandys.

87.

I'll have both please.

Beth pulls Celeste away from the bar and brings her into the

house and plops her down on the couch.

I'm going to recommend some quiet

time for you right now.

Can I smoke?

No.

Celeste starts weeping.

I don't want to be alone forever.

Not forever, honey. Just until you

sober up. You'll be fine.

Okay then, I'll just go to the

other side of the pool. I promise I

won't make you look bad.

Jesse and Veronica are talking to Beth. In the foreground,

Celeste slowly floats into frame on a raft in the pool,

passed out, face down, sunglasses half off, fully clothed.

Skillz approaches Beth.

At least she's quiet now.

I'm gonna get her out of here.

Beth has tons of Barneys New York bags and is trying on

clothes for her rehearsal dinner. Celeste is in the fetal

position, hungover on Beth's bed.

88.

(on the phone) Hey Riley, it's

Celeste. I just want to talk to

you about this "error" in your

logo. I'm so, so sorry, I will fix

this...call me.

I just think it's corny to wear

white two nights in a row. I want

to rock a pattern, or maybe

something in pastel...

BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD)

How's this? C! Wake up! I'm

leaving in an hour and I have to

make a decision now. You owe me.

You humped my grandmother

yesterday.

BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Oh no, are you okay?

What the fuck does Riley Banks

know.

Um...nothing. She's a tart.

Yeah dude! She's fucking moderately

talented, blessed with a good face

and has maybe 5 more years left of

stardom. Who is she to tell ME

what...

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I never hung up, I never hung up!

Fuck! Do you think she...

89.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Hey Riley, what's up?

I need to talk to you. Come to my

house. Now.

Oh boy.

Celeste bursts in with all types of nervous energy.

The thing is, I have been having a

really hard time in my life,

everything is sort of falling apart

and when you said that thing about

contempt and investigation, it just

sort of hit a nerve and...

Just, shut up for a minute.

Riley is in tears.

RILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I just found out my boyfriend

cheated on me.

Oh. God, I'm sorry. I didn't even

know you had a boyfriend.

Nobody knew. He didn't want anybody

to know. Fucking ass hole. And

now, my career might be over

because you put a penis in my logo.

Thank you for that.

Riley is clearly destroyed.

RILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I didn't know who to call.

Celeste gives Riley a big hug.

90.

So you called the smartest person

you know.

Riley smiles through her tears.

Riley is asleep on the couch with a blanket over her.

Celeste is up, watching "Great Sports Moments of 2008" on

ESPN Classic.

It is a recap of Matthias Steiner's Olympic weight lifting

triumph after his wife died. Jesse's favorite. Celeste is

crying. This wakes Riley up.

Are you crying?

Celeste turns off the television.

Oh, yeah, this just reminds me of

someone.

A guy?

Yeah. A guy.

You miss him?

Yeah, I do.

They all fucking suck.

Kind of.

So it never gets better?

No, it doesn't. But you do. You're

gonna be fine.

91.

Celeste is runs into a dry cleaners. She is out of breathe.

The long line of impatient people to see this dragon breather

who has broke the silence. She looks at her watch. She

stands diligently in line.

Celeste's phone rings loudly. She picks it up.

Hi...I know I won't...no I'm on the

road already! Near...Bakersfield?

Of course I'll be there...love you

too.

She hangs up and was clearly lying. She must do something.

Something she does not want to do. She looks at the stoic

woman in front of her.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I'm so sorry but I am the maid of

honor and I am supposed to be at

the wedding real far away, would

you mind if I just got in front of

you?...

The woman reluctantly waves her to pass.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Thank you so much, I really do

appreciate...sir?

A disinterested man barely acknowledges Celeste.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I'm incredibly late for this

wedding and my dress is here, is

there any way...

He moves aside. The next man just stares at her.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Hi. I'm sure you heard me ask the

last guy but...

The camera pulls out. A wide shot of Celeste, imprisoned by

her own rules, asking every person to cut. It looks tedious

and ridiculous.

It's Paul. Again. She pushes "Ignore."

92.

Celeste chain smokes. She makes up songs about how shitty

the traffic is. She laughs uncontrollably. She just

screams.

Celeste sits at a window counter. She looks out onto a small

street in the center of town. She unwraps her sandwich from

noisy, wax paper. It's really quiet in the deli. She sees a

group of wedding guests outside. They wave. She waves back.

The wedding is under way.

I now pronounce you husband and

wife.

Tucker and Beth kiss. Everybody explodes in applause. We see

Celeste in the audience, clapping. She looks beat down and

tired.

Three girls, with no stage presence, are giving a speech.

They are trading off rhyming couplets.

She pursued her love of Spanish

men, but missed her Tucker, more

than just as a friend.

And our princess returned home to

her loving prince, and they've been

together ever since.

ALL THREE GIRLS

We love you, Bethy!!

The audience applauds. Celeste rolls her eyes.

And now we're gonna hear from

Celeste, Beth's best friend in the

world.

93.

Thank you. Thanks a lot, girls,

that was so...wow. There are no

words. Well, this is gonna sound

bad but I actually forgot that I

was speaking tonight.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I don't where to start. Um...how do

you get a nun pregnant? You fuck

her?

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Thanks, Tom. Man, it was much

longer than I thought to get to Big

Sur from Los Angeles on a Friday

afternoon. Stellar call on having a

destination wedding the weekend

before 4th of July. Busiest travel

day of the year. So thanks for

that, Mrs. Weinberg.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

But the truth is, I would go

anywhere for Beth. She's my best

friend. And I'm so happy for her.

Senior year of college, we had a

tradition. Every Sunday, come rain

or shine, Beth and Tucker would

meet me and Jesse at the Bishop

with a 12-pack of Miller High Life,

the champagne of beers, and we

would meet to talk about what was

important in the world, you know,

Heidegger's influence on hip-hop.

Or the feminist duality on "Melrose

Place." Life's big questions. Beth

and Tucker were just friends then

but there was always something

there. Just an ease they had with

each other. Jesse and I spent years

trying to get them together,

unsuccessfully.

94.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

But we all remained friends and

watched as Tucker dated the most

slutty, vacuous and vile girls on

the planet. For five long years.

Tucker flinches.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Finally, he removed his head from

his ass, and saw what was in front

of him. And that was beautiful

Beth. And none of us could be

happier about it; they were

perfect. At last. Love wins.

Wedding guests clap. They think it's over. It's not.

Celeste looks at Jesse in the crowd. Veronica is next to

him.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Um...Jesse and I are getting a

divorce. So that's...yeah, our

timing was not as good, I guess.

Beth and Tucker, you are lucky to

be best friends. Work hard and

respect that. It doesn't come

easily. Be patient, don't always

think you're right. And if you are,

it doesn't fucking matter anyway.

Fight for it, everyday, I wish I

had.

Celeste is holding a small plate of food. Jesse sidles up to

her.

I know this may not the best time

to talk about this...but...at some

point, we will have to talk about

Tucker's dance moves.

INSERT of Tucker dancing on the dance floor. It's

unexplainable. It's shocking how terrible it is.

He is so special. Not as special as

that poem. That those girls did?

Wow. Wow.

95.

Your speech was really...beautiful.

Thank you.

I meant it.

I know.

You know what else is beautiful?

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Oh god, tug it.

Aw yeah! Fuck!

Jesse?

Hey.

What are you doing?

What? Nothing. We're just...

Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where

we find the littlest thing that

resembles a penis and we just, you

know...

96.

Celeste and Jesse demonstrate for Veronica. Celeste looks up

and realizes how dumb this must seem.

I don't get it.

Celeste and Jesse stop.

It's stupid.

Veronica is looking at Celete's food.

Oh, the foods out. (to Celeste) See

you on the dance floor? Watch out

for Tucker though.

They leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling. She bites into

the carrot.

We see a raucous wedding dance floor. Everyone's dancing:

Beth, Tucker, their families, their friends, Jesse, Veronica,

Scott, etc. They are doing wedding dances. Celeste sits at

her table, watching with a smile. It is bittersweet for her.

She drinks a martini. Alone.

Celeste and Paul are playing scrabble and drinking wine.

(keeping score on a notepad) So,

that's 38 points plus 50 bonus

points for using all my tiles so...

Wait, wait, wait. I think I may

have to challenge. Zooecia?? That's

not a word, that's my hoochie

cousin's name!

Are you challenging or not?

Yes, I definitely am.

97.

Well, I will tell you that Zooecia

is a sac secreted by a compound

organism but here you go. (he hands

her the Scrabble dictionary) Look

for yourself.

Celeste finds the word, reads the definition and silently

accepts defeat.

PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Ha ha! I go again.

I've never lost a game of Scrabble

in my life.

Well, nothing lasts forever.

Celeste and Paul are making out on the couch.

I'm so sorry I beat you in

Scrabble.

No you're not.

You're right, I'm not.

The making out gets a little hotter. Celeste is aggressive.

Will you get a condom?

Uh...I don't think we should...

No, you're using a condom.

No, I don't think we should sleep

together.

Celeste pulls away from him.

What?

98.

I just...I don't know.

Are you not into it?

No, no believe me, I'm into it.

Then, what's the deal?

I really like you.

Right, I'm confused...why not sleep

with me then?

Because I think I might really like

you.

Oh. (further realizing) Oh. Okay.

Well, I like you too.

Celeste looks distant.

Celeste is at a loud, trendy club. She sits next to Riley.

They have to shout to be heard.

THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST

EMBARRASSING SPEECH EVER! HOW WILL

SHOW YOUR FACE TO YOUR FRIENDS EVER

AGAIN?

ACTUALLY, WEIRDLY, I'M KINDA HAPPY

I DID IT. I FEEL BETTER SOMEHOW.

WELL GOOD FOR YOU THEN.

Celeste looks around at lots of men, grinding each other with

whistles in their mouth and drinks in their hands.

THE GAYS REALLY KNOW HOW TO PARTY,

HUH?

99.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

THIS IS A GAY CLUB.

IT'S OPENING NIGHT HERE. IT DOESN'T

KNOW WHAT IT IS YET.

RILEY, THE CLUB IS CALLED SWALLOW.

Excuse me, can you please tell your

friend Riley that we worship her??

OMG, she's so pretty!

Sure...

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Wait, are you aware that the logo

is...

A dick in a butt? Yeahhh!

It's amazing. All of our friends

are rocking it. It's like the gay

Izod.

100.

Wow, so, what, you just buy the

biggest size they make?

How dare you, I'm a size 10 in

tween. I have a slight frame.

They walk away, offended. Celeste turns to Riley. She is

being adored by gay men.

I LOVE IT HERE!!

Celeste has a big idea.

Celeste is hiking alone on the phone, energized.

Tweens don't want her anymore. But

the gays do! Ten percent of

Americans are gay, Scott. You're

gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod.

She could be Lady Gaga by the end

of the year. Huge market.

Wow, you might have just turned the

cock in the butt around.

We WILL make the cock in the butt

work for us. The cock in the butt

will be huge!

Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear

her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self-

consciously.

MONTAGE OVER SHUGGIE OTIS' "INSPIRATION INFORMATION":

LOTERIA MEXICAN RESTAURANT. PAUL IS TELLING A STORY-HE

IS ANIMATED AND CONFIDENT. CELESTE LOOKS AT HIM, SLIGHTLY

EMBARRASSED. A MOMENT LATER, BETH AND TUCKER ERUPT IN

LAUGHTER. CELESTE SMILES.

101.

OFFICE, LOOKING NERVOUS. JESSE OFFERS VERONICA HIS HAND.

SHE GRABS IT AND SMILES.

"A FRIEND OF DOROTHY'S," A GAY STORE IN WEST HOLLYWOOD.

Celeste is shopping for a dresser. She is talking to a

salesperson.

So, it comes with directions and

it's actually really easy to

assemble.

Look, you do not know me. I do not

want to assemble. Trust me, you do

not want me to assemble. Bad things

happen. Could I just take the floor

model? I'll hook you up.

Lemme go ask my manager.

Thanks, dude.

Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart

filled with baby stuff. She approaches her.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Veronica? Hey, Celeste.

Of course, yeah, hi! What are you

doing?

Oh, I'm getting a dresser. You?

Oh, you know getting...

VERONICA (CONT'D) CELESTE

Baby stuff. Baby stuff.

VERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Beth is uh...throwing me a baby

shower? So I have to register.

102.

She is?

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

That's uh...really nice.

Very. And so helpful right now.

Of course. (laughs nervously) Well,

looks like you're really organized.

Organized, terrified.

You'll do great.

Thanks. I hope so.

VERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Listen, I never got a chance to

just tell you I'm so sorry about

all this. Trust me, I didn't

expect...

No, don't. Really. There's nothing

to apologize for. I'm the one who's

sorry. I mean, I dug through your

trash.

Look, I don't blame you. For

anything. This has all been so

weird. Everything happened really

fast.

Yeah, it did. But everything will

work out. I know it. Jesse's book

is coming out...

He's so talented.

103.

A beat.

Yeah, he is.

An awkward silence.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Well, good luck. Nice to see you.

You too.

They both steer their carts towards each other in opposite

directions but bump right into each other.

Oh sorry!

Oh, it's okay! Bye again.

Celeste and Paul are in a private karaoke room. Paul is

belting his heart out, singing Boyz II Men, "On Bended Knee."

Celeste is loving it. She has her own mike and pipes in once

in a while with a harmony.

Can somebody tell me how to get

things back the way they used to

be...oh God give me a reason, I'm

down on bended knee..ooohohhh ooooh

Ooohh ohhh. Til you come back to

me..

I'm down on bended knee hee hee

hee.

They finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast

with beers.

PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I think we're really good.

No, we ARE really good.

104.

Aw shit!

Get ready. You're first.

Baby when I met you, there was

peace on earth, I set out get you

with a fine tooth comb. I was soft

inside. Soft inside? What the fuck?

Shhh come on. Focus.

You do something to me, that I

can't explain, hold me closer, and

I feel no pain. Tender love is

blind, it requires a dedication.

(quietly) I can't.

What? Come on, we're so good

together. Islands in the stream,

that is what we are. Get in there!!

This is my favorite part!

No. I can't.

I know I'm pitchy but I'm finding

it. Sail away with me...

No. This. Us. I'm sorry.

105.

What do you mean?

I just...can't.

Are you serious? Oh no. Why?

I think I need to be alone? I'm not

ready. I'm having fun and I feel

like I'm beginning to like you and

I just don't think I'm ready for

that.

What? Really?

PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Wow, you're breaking my heart.

I'm so sorry. You are so...great.

But I'm getting divorced.

Celeste, I know.

I think I need to go through this

alone.

Yeah. Yeah, okay. I respect that.

Live by will, not by force.

What?

You're only ready when you're

ready, you know? Don't force it.

It's just some yoga shit.

Thanks.

106.

But I do like you. I like you a

lot. And when you are ready, if

you're ready, call me.

Celeste and Jesse sit across from each other with their

respective lawyers. They are both dressed very well. The

atmosphere is formal, tense. There is not a lot of talking

but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point

pens. CELESTE'S LAWYER, male, 40, speaks:

Sign here. And here. And here.

Celeste looks up, makes eye contact with Jesse and smiles

uncomfortably.

CELESTE'S LAWYER (CONT'D) (CONTD)

And here. Here. Yup. Aaaaaand

here. Here. Couple more. Here...

Celeste is still signing. She looks at Jesse again, who is

straightening his tie.

I like that tie.

Oh, thank you.

One more here.

Is it made out of organic mung

beans?

Jesse nods and chuckles.

No, I actually found it digging

through your trash.

Ohhh, I see. All right.

They've broken the tension. But it's still silent. Then

Jesse chortles. It sounds like a baby pig. It makes Celeste

laugh.

107.

Now, both Celeste and Jesse are silently cracking up, doubled

over as their lawyers sit there, watching them, perplexed.

A LITTLE LATER

Celeste and Jesse walk out of the building.

So...we're divorced!

They high five. What are you supposed to do when you get

divorced.

We did it.

You wanna walk for a couple

minutes?

Sure.

Celeste and Jesse are now approaching the front of "Urban

Light," the installation from the beginning of the movie.

The street lamps are now illuminated. She takes a seat on a

step. Jesse sits next to her. She refers to the lamps:

These are beautiful.

I thought you hated them.

Yeah, well, I've never seen them at

night.

Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in. He looks pretty

sad.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

What's up with you? I know we just

got divorced but no one died,

right?

108.

I'm just feeling like maybe you

were right. I am a fuck up. I

don't know what I'm doing. My

girlfriend left.

What? Veronica? Left where?

Left me. She wanted me to tell her

everything was gonna be okay and I

couldn't. I don't know why but I

just...couldn't. She wants to go

back to Brussels.

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Okay, you can say it now. You were

right, I blew it. Just say it.

Hey...don't do that.

Do what?

You are not a loser. You never

were. You took a chance. I admire

that and I believe in you.

You do?

I do. And I want to thank you.

For what?

For never being the person I wanted

you to be.

Oh, you're welcome.

Go get her.

109.

But I don't know if everything is

gonna be all right.

Well, who does? Do you love her?

I do.

Then it's worth fighting for.

Okay. Okay.

God, I finally understand why you

fucking cry all the time. Shit is

emotional.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

You deserve to be happy. And I wish

that for you, always.

Me too.

So...I guess we were right.

Huh?

JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

I love you.

I love you too.

110.

Celeste sits awhile and looks up at the sky.

Celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth.

Hey. So, you're probably giving

your card to some girl in yoga

right now. But if that doesn't work

out for you...I think I may be

ready. To beat you in Scrabble.

Celeste runs in to pay for gas. She is on her Blackberry.

Celeste stands in line with some gum and water. A young man

blatantly cuts in front of her with a gallon of water. Old

Celeste returns for a moment.

Excuse me, sir?

The young man turns around. Celeste realizes she's no longer

this person. She restrains herself.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

Nothing.

Celeste takes in how she has changed. She smiles a little.

The young man turns back to her.

Hey, I'm sorry for cutting. My

dog's in the car and he's really

thirsty. So, thanks.

No problem.

She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.
