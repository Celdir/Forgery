FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

OCTOBER 21, 1997

EXT. CUMBERLAND, RHODE ISLAND HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

It's the early 1980's and everyone is arriving at school. We push

through the parking lot crowd to a nervous, lanky kid, TED

PELOQUIN.

She barely looks at him as he approaches, just drags on her smoke.

Renise looks unenthused.

Ted nods, confused.

Renise throws down her butt and storms off.

ANGLE ON

school parking lot. She's athletic and tanned and doesn't have a

bad bone in her body.

She locks up the bike and starts walking toward the school.

As she approaches the camera, we PAN to see Ted watching her. He's

sitting on a picnic table with two FRIENDS.

Finally Ted takes his eyes off Mary.

Friend #1 makes a jerk-off motion.

The guys LAUGH.

His friends stare at him.

Friend #2 notices Mary talking to her FRIENDS.

This irks Ted.

This takes the wind out of Ted's sails.

Everyone looks at him.

Suddenly Friend #1 NOTICES something.

THEIR POV

crewcut comes walking up the street. He's in his early twenties

and though the weather is mild he's WEARING EARMUFFS. He

approaches a GROUP OF KIDS sitting on a car hood.

The kids watch as the Ear-Muff Guy approaches another group.

The Ear-Muff Guy heads back to the car.

The Boyfriend grabs him by the collar.

The Boyfriend throws the Ear-Muff Guy to the ground and is about

to pummel him when Ted intervenes.

A crowd starts to gather which only incites Smokey more.

Smokey tosses Ted out of the way and moves toward the Ear-Muff

Guy. Just then Mary shows up and steps between them.

She bends down and helps the Ear-Muff Guy off the ground.

At this, Smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the

school, along with most of the crowd.

Mary turns her attention in the direction Ted was thrown.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

Mary and a muddied Ted are walking Warren home. Warren lags

behind, mumbling to himself. Mary notices that Ted is limping.

Warren approaches and motions for Ted to hop on his back.

Warren pats his back again.

Ted hops onto Warren's back.

Warren walks about five feet and stops.

Off Ted's reaction, we

EXT . MARY'S HOUSE - DAY

Muddy sweat is running down Ted's face as he struggles up a hill

with Warren on his back.

Ted rolls his eyes and continues toward the front door. Mary looks

on, amused.

She smiles at this.

EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

A tuxedoed and smiling Ted drives up in his parent's station

wagon.

EXT. MARY' S FRONT DOOR - TWILIGHT

Ted knocks on the door and Mary's gruff DAD answers.

Ted looks devastated. Suddenly the door swings open revealing

MARY'S MOM.

INT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

Ted nervously enters and sees Warren watching T.V. in the den.

Warren doesn't look his way.

Just then Mary comes down the stairs looking as if the directors

had really taken their time casting this role. Ted can't believe

his eyes.

Mary's Dad shrugs.

This finally gets Warren's attention.

We see Ted discreetly pull a BRAND NEW BASEBALL out of his pocket

and palm it in his hand.

Ted is reaching behind Warren's ear when suddenly Warren TAKES A

SWIPE AT HIM, knocking him to the ground.

Ted HITS HIS HEAD on the coffee table.

next to the OTHER MISSING BALL.

BACK TO SCENE

DIVES ONTO TED. As MARY AND HER PARENTS SCREAM, Ted manages to

free himself from the disabled man's clutches and GETS WARREN IN A

HEADLOCK.

The family jumps on Warren and finally break it up.

Ted looks around but there's no ball in sight.

As Mary helps Ted up, we see that his shirttail is out and his tie

is hanging off. Mary's parents lead the frothing Warren back to

the couch.

Mary looks down and frowns.

Ted starts to tuck his pants in as Mary and her mother head back

up the stairs. Mary's Dad and Ted are left alone. And Warren.

Ted rubs his head, sees a spot of blood.

INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT

Ted dabs his head with a tissue, then moves to the toilet. As he

TAKES A LEAK he glances out the window to his left.

TED'S POV

Ted smiles...

song for themselves, for the spring, for Ted and Mary, and

suddenly they fly away and we...

Ted hangs his head.

EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Mary and Warren are huddled outside the door.

Mary REACTS to this.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Suddenly a POLICE OFFICER sticks his head in the bathroom window.

But the Officer's already climbing in the window. Once inside, he

turns his flashlight on Ted and WHISTLES.

Mary's parents nod.

The Officer makes a face, then rolls up his sleeves.

The Officer reaches down and takes hold of the zipper.

Defeated, Ted holds his breath and braces for the worst.

EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

TWO PARAMEDICS rush Ted out the front door on a stretcher. Mary

runs alongside him holding a towel on his crotch. while a THIRD

PARAMEDIC dabs at his crotch with a towel. Mary's Mom and Dad are

out front along with two FIRETRUCKS, four POLICE CARS, and a crowd

of about thirty NEIGHBORS.

Mary does as she's told.

He gives her two thumbs up as they slide him into the ambulance.

INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

The doors SLAM shut and as the ambulance pulls away Ted starts to

Just then the door quietly opens and Ted's PSYCHIATRIST tip-toes

back into the room and takes his seat. (He has a dab of mustard on

his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into his

collar.)

The Psychiatrist notices the napkin and quickly wipes his chin,

then tosses it aside.

The Psychiatrist scratches his chin.

Ted thinks about this, then glances back at the shrink.

Off Ted's look, we

Ted shrugs.

Ted manages a small smile. Just then, Ted's cell phone RINGS.

Whoever it is HANGS UP. Without reacting, Ted closes the phone and

puts it back in his pocket.

EXT. DOM'S HOUSE - DAY

Dom and Ted are drinking beer while sitting on Dom's front steps.

We see signs of kids everywhere: a tricycle, six-foot basketball

hoop, dolls, etc.

DOM'S WIFE comes out and hands them each a cigar.

She goes back inside.

These guys don't usually talk about this crap, and Ted gets a

little embarrassed.

Dom SIGHS.

Ted and Dom are walking down a hallway.

Ted thinks about this.

INT. HEALY'S CUBICLE - MORNING

Ted is seated inside a small cubicle across the desk from PATRICK

HEALY, a shaggy-looking guy in a mis-matched three-piece suit.

Healy looks more like a used-car salesman than an insurance

investigator.

Suddenly Healy is in his face.

No.

Healy thinks about it.

ESTABLISHING SHOT

EXT. COLLINS AVENUE - DAY

Healy waits alone on a corner carrying one bag and a RACK OF

BEERS. Suddenly a '89 Chrysler Lebaron convertible with a GREAT

DANE in the back SCREECHES to a halt in front of him. The driver,

SULLY, is a muscular, well-groomed man in his thirties.

INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAY

The dog is catching wind in the backseat and Sully hands Healy a

packet.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

This place is modest and clean but it has a direct view of South

Beach. Healy puts his bags down and looks around.

Sully ducks into the bedroom and Healy looks around the apartment.

Suddenly a huge Boa Constrictor slithers up on Healy's lap.

Sully comes back in the room wearing a police uniform.

Healy just stares at his friend.

Healy pops open one of his beers and hands it to Sully.

Healy stares at him, baffled.

Sully stares at the beer, weakening.

Finally, Sully takes the beer. He stares at it a moment and then

sips.

Healy takes the beer from Sully and as he chugs it, we

INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAWN

Healy is on a stakeout. He's dozing. He's been here for hours,

food wrappers litter Sully's car. He's wearing Walkman-type

HEADPHONES which are connected to a RADIO SURVEILLANCE MICROPHONE

attached to a pair of BINOCULARS.

Suddenly MUSIC explodes through his headphones--Healy's jolted

awake. Who threw the grenade? Recovering, Healy aims the

binoculars toward...

HEALY'S POV

Healy has a clear, unobstructed view into Mary's apartment. The

music is coming from Mary's clock radio. MARY sits up in bed and

shakes herself awake, like someone's just poured cold water over

her. She cranks the music even LOUDER. Mary hops out of bed,

wearing only her panties, and though she's a little older now, she

still looks well cast.

A fat patient, GARY, approaches.

Gary takes his and walks off. A couple more patients and then

bucktoothed FREDDIE steps up to her.

Mary points to another PATIENT staring bashfully at Freddie.

Freddie moves off and fat Gary is back, trying to be

inconspicuous.

Mary smiles and hands Gary another McMuffin.

Sully is sitting on the kitchen floor in his police uniform, a

ring of white around his nostrils. The room is littered with beer

and a rolled-up bill on the breakfast table. The dog and the snake

are in the doorway looking at him with concern.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

Ted looks completely drained.

Ted stands and starts moping away.

As Ted leaves, Healy puts his feet up on the table and sits back.

We PAN across the room of unopened boxes to Ted laying awake in

bed. We hear HEAD-BANGER MUSIC coming from the apartment next

door. Finally Ted gets up and walks over to his dresser. As he

flips on a small light we see loose change, a balled-up Kleenex, a

few golf tees, and Ted's wallet. Ted picks up the wallet and opens

it.

jauntily to...

A GOLF TEE NEXT TO MARY'S

Healy places a ball on the tee and takes a swing. He tops the ball

and it dribbles about ten yards.

Mary nods. Healy takes another swing and duck-hooks one about

fifty yards. Mary addresses her ball, takes a smooth backswing,

and

She cracks her shot long and straight.

Mary tees up another ball and Healy puts down his club.

Healy pulls out a huge wad of change from his pocket.

She looks impressed. Healy looks at his watch.

He flips her a coin.

Healy starts to walk off. Mary doesn't know what to do. Will she

ever see this guy again?

Healy doesn't answer or turn around. He just raises his hand and

gives her a little wave.

Mary shrugs her shoulders. Oh well...

EXT. DRIVING RANGE PARKING LOT - DAY

Healy is sitting in Sully's Chrysler LeBaron, right next to Mary's

Honda Civic.

He watches the rear-view mirror, and the moment he sees Mary

coming out from the driving range, he swings his legs out the door

and starts changing out of his golf shoes. As Mary tosses her

golf bag into the trunk, she notices Healy tying his shoes. A

second chance.

There's an uncomfortable pause...Why doesn't this guy ask the

usual questions?

Healy opens the back door to put away his golf shoes. Suddenly,

rolls and rolls of paper come tumbling out. Mary bends over to

help Healy pick them up.

Mary stares at him, mouth agape.

Healy smiles at this and we

A profusely sweating Ted has a DRESSER ON HIS BACK and EEKS his

way toward the front door as his BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER catches

up to him IN A WHEELCHAIR. (The man is a quadriplegic who needs to

use a MOUTHPIECE to operate his chair.)

The Boss's Disabled Brother bites into the mouthpiece and ZIPS

Healy reaches in his pocket, pulls out a VALIUM and a DOGGY TREAT.

Healy shoves the pill into the treat's soft center, examines it,

then thinks what the hell and SHOVES IN ANOTHER ONE.

Puffy GROWLS LOUDER. Healy pops the treat through the mail slot

and listens as the dog DEVOURS IT. Healy looks at his watch, then

sneaks back outside to wait a few minutes for the drugs to kick

in.

INT. MARY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Healy is sitting on Mary's couch with Puffy spread-eagled

upside-down on his lap, KNOCKED OUT COLD. Mary and Magda look on

in amazement.

Magda stares dreamily at Healy, smitten.

The two women go into the kitchen and Healy is left to pet the

MOTIONLESS DOG. Suddenly Healy notices that the dog is A LITTLE

TOO MOTIONLESS. Healy checks Puffy's pulse. He looks at his watch

to time the rate.

He starts SHAKING THE DOG, but Puffy doesn't move. Healy goes into

action. He starts pressing on his heart, PERFORMING DOGGIE CPR.

One-and-two-and-three, he continues trying to revive him.

Healy resumes blowing into the dog's snout, pumping his chest,

with no results. Desperate, he picks up the cheese knife and

quickly SLICES THE WIRES ON TWO TABLE LAMPS.

Healy grabs the two wires and TOUCHES THEM TOGETHER LIKE A

DEFIBRILLATOR on the little pooch's chest.

Healy takes his pulse again. Nothing. He ZAPS him once more with

FLAMES.

When Healy turns back, he's horrified at what he sees. He grabs a

vase of flowers and POURS THE WATER ON THE BURNING DOG.

Healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket as

Magda ENTERS the room followed by Mary.

Mary and Healy walk through the exhibit area. Mary scans the room

for her friend. Healy's face is ashen.

Mary points to an architectural model.

Mary gives him a look. Suddenly, Healy draws a couple of invisible

sixshooters at her.

He turns to go but Mary notices something O.S.

Mary leads Healy over to her friend TUCKER, a

distinguished-looking man in his fifties. Healy looks like a dog

that's being dragged to the vet. Mary and Tucker embrace.

Mary LAUGHS and hugs Tucker tighter. Then:

BEAT.

Healy makes a hand-gesture to imply that Kim's sexuality is in

doubt.

Really

? But he's been married for twenty

Tucker can hardly believe his ears.

Tucker starts to look a little suspicious.

Healy drags Mary across the room toward a MAN who's looking at an

exhibit.

Healy shrugs and the man walks away angrily.

other, as he listens to Sully read the following words:

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - SAME

A disheveled and wired-looking Sully is sitting on the couch in

his underwear READING FROM THE SAME SCRIPT. There's COKE on the

table, DOG SHIT on the floor, and FLIES everywhere.

In the B.G. we see the Great Dane SNIFFING at his empty bowl and

the Boa Constrictor sprawled out on the floor, barely moving.

Suddenly the dog snatches the page out of his hand and STARTS TO

EAT IT.

Magda folds her arms and gloats.

Just then, Healy sees a bug on the car window and instinctively

finally setting his sights on the Boa Constrictor Bill. Bill

glances the dog's way nervously, SENSES TROUBLE, and wiggles his

way into another room. As Hal TAKES OFF after the snake, we

INT. MARY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

Healy starts to knock on Mary's door, but, before he can, the door

suddenly swings open revealing a beaming Mary.

Before he can finish, Mary steps forward and their mouths meet in

a passionate KISS.

MONTAGE OF MARY AND HEALY COURTING

--As Mary watches, Healy plays TOUCH FOOTBALL with Warren and a

few of his friends. Healy catches a pass then, trying a little too

hard to impress Mary, he delivers a forearm shiver to his defender

and gives Warren a vicious STRAIGHT-ARM. When Healy gets into the

end zone he spikes the ball and starts talking trash to another

defender.

--Healy shows up at Mary's door sporting a set of OVERSIZED

INCREDIBLY-WHITE CAPPED TEETH. He gives her a big horse smile and

she reacts uncertainly.

--Healy is in Mary's apartment as Mary finishes dressing for a

night on the town.

When she puts her head close to inspect his pants, he lets fly a

THUNDEROUS FART. She pulls her head away, repulsed, but Healy just

LAUGHS.

--Mary and and the horse-toothed Healy are having dinner in a

romantic restaurant. As he eats he tells an animated story but

he's having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of food are

spraying out of his mouth with every word. Mary has to BOB AND

WEAVE to avoid being covered with debris.

--Healy and Warren are playing monopoly. When Warren isn't

looking, Healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on Boardwalk. In

the b.g. we see one of Warren's buddies fall out of a palm tree.

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

A lovesick Healy is mauling Mary out on the sidewalk in front

while Warren stands off to the side LISTENING TO A WALKMAN.

Suddenly we see Warren PERK UP at something.

ON TED AND DOM

They both duck down in their seats.

Healy winks at Mary.

Healy reaches over and lifts a headphone off Warren's ear.

Suddenly Warren SUCKER-PUNCHES HEALY IN THE THROAT.

Mary watches with a look of concern as Healy gets in his car and

drives off.

ON TED AND DOM

Ted stares gazily.

THEIR POV

Suddenly Dom HONKS THE HORN, then ducks down. Mary turns around

and sees Ted.

Ted gets out of the car and hustles across the street toward Mary.

Finally she recognizes him.

Mary LAUGHS.

Mary is stunned.

Ted is devastated to hear this.

Ted pantomimes an explosion.

She stares at him.

Ted doesn't know how to respond to this and then she smiles.

Mary seems touched by this.

Ted finally smiles and we

newspaper.

Mary looks like she's going to throw up.

We hear the PITTER-PATTER of the dog's nails on the floor, then a

Tucker puts his arms around her.

Mary looks fondly at Tucker.

As we hear a CLICK, Healy stares at the cell phone, seething.

Tucker comes out the front door, looks around, then walks off down

the sidewalk.

Healy discreetly pulls out and slowly follows Tucker in his car.

DUCKS INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT and DRIVES OFF. Healy pulls into

traffic and follows.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Dom's mixing a drink while Ted paces nervously.

Dom nods, satisfied.

Ted just stares at him.

Ted considers this.

Dom shrugs...Duh.

Dom makes a game-show BUZZER sound.

EXT. HOTEL - EVENING

Dom walks out of the lobby just as another cab arrives and Mary

gets out. He sees and her and ducks behind a bush as she walks

past him.

INT. TED'S HOTEL BATHROOM - SAME

Ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter (open to the bra

ads) as he furiously FLOGS THE DOLPHIN (chest-high side view.) We

see some balled-up tissue nearby. After several frantic strokes,

he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly EXHALES, clearly

having COMPLETED HIS MISSION.

He draws a few more breaths, picks up a face cloth, and goes to

clean up.

But something's missing: The Load. Ted looks down, checks his

hands, pants, shoes, looks in the sink, finally glances at the

ceiling, with no luck.

The Load IS MISSING

!!!!

That's when the doorbell RINGS. Ted couldn't look more HORRIFIED.

As he buckles his pants, he makes a last, panicky reconnaissance

of the area. The doorbell RINGS AGAIN and Ted reluctantly goes to

answer it.

INT. TED'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Ted opens the door and Mary is standing there looking as lovely as

ever.

She notices something.

Mary leans forward for a closer look. Ted is terrified.

Before Ted can stop her, Mary grabs The Load off his ear and WIPES

IT IN HER BANGS.

EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Healy is still following Tucker in his car. Finally Tucker stops

in front of a lavish Victorian home and gets out carrying a pizza

and wearing a PIZZA DELIVERY HAT.

Healy SCREECHES to a sideways stop, jumps out and POUNCES ON HIM.

Tucker drops the pizza as Healy SLAMS HIM into a tree.

Healy SLAMS HIM AGAINST THE TREE AGAIN.

Healy SLAPS him across the face.

Healy raises his arm again and Tucker tries to shield himself.

Healy grabs him by the collar.

Healy throws Tucker to the ground and takes off his sport coat.

Healy grabs Tucker by the hair and cocks his arm.

Tucker suddenly gets emotional. Healy stops and looks at him.

Healy slowly lets go.

Tucker rolls his eyes and pulls out his PIZZA DELIVERY BADGE, with

him pictured beside the name Norman Plante. As Healy let's this

sink in, we

EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT

Ted and Mary are eating CORNDOGS at the snack bar.

She smiles.

Mary smiles coyly.

Mary is amused by this.

The Counter-Man hands each of them another corndog.

They smile at one another.

Ted takes a chance.

Mary smiles and Ted LAUGHS...perhaps a little too hard.

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ted and Mary are sitting on her front stoop SMOKING A BONE.

ANGLE ON

ON THEM from the shadows.

Healy and Tucker duck back into the alley.

EXT. MARY'S ALLEY - NIGHT

Healy is throwing DOGGIE TREATS through an open THIRD-FLOOR

WINDOW.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME

We hear the TELEVISION and see Magda DOZING on the couch with a

watery COCKTAIL IN HER HAND and the dog Puffy at her feet.

Suddenly a DOGGIE TREAT flies through the window, landing on the

rug. Puffy SNAPS TO ATTENTION and approaches the treat. He sniffs

it, then GOBBLES IT UP. ANOTHER doggie treat lands beside him and

he eats that, too. Then ANOTHER.

EXT. MARY'S ALLEY - SAME

Tucker keeps throwing the treats up and Healy looks concerned.

As Tucker throws another...

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME

The doggie treat LANDS IN MAGDA'S COCKTAIL, waking her up. Magda

looks around, gets her bearings, and then DOWNS THE DRINK!

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME

Mary and Ted, still sitting on the stoop. Mary seems a little

reflective.

Mary looks a little disappointed.

Mary sort of smiles.

Ted jumps up and starts up the stairs two at a time.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Ted and Mary ENTER, we see Magda HOLDING UP THE COUCH with one

hand and VACUUMING WITH THE OTHER.

Mary doesn't know what to make of it.

Magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a BANGING SOUND coupled

with the O.S. MUFFLED YAPPING of Puffy.

As the O.S. YAPPING AND BANGING continues, Magda PICKS UP THE

TELEVISION and starts DUSTING the TV stand.

Ted walks down the hall, following the YAPPING AND BANGING SOUND

until he comes to the bathroom door. The YAPPING is MUCH LOUDER

now and he NOTICES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIM HESITATE.

TED'S POV

from the force of something BATTERING IT FROM WITHIN.

Ted thinks about this, shrugs, and opens the door.

BARING HIS TEETH like a Rottweiler, Puffy SPRINGS at Ted's

jugular!

INT. MARY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ted stumbles back into the living room with the hopped-up dog ON

HIS FACE. He KNOCKS OVER A LAMP, tumbles onto the floor, and

fights for his life.

Mary and Magda SCREAM as Ted and Puffy mix it up on the floor. Ted

tries to CRAWL TOWARD THE DOOR but Puffy GRABS THE CUFF OF HIS

PANTS.

Ted manages to GET THE DOG IN A HEADLOCK.

Puffy gets a piece of Ted's wrist and Ted SCREAMS and drops him.

Both man and toy poodle SPRING TO THEIR FEET.

They start CIRCLING ONE ANOTHER. Puffy leaps at Ted and Ted SMACKS

HIM into a wall. Unfazed, the dog gets a running start and LEAPS

AT TED'S NECK.

Ted manages to duck and PUFFY FLIES OUT THE OPEN WINDOW!

EXT MIAMI STREET - DAY

MONTAGE OF TED AND MARY FALLING IN LOVE

--Ted and Warren are at the top of a giant WATER SLIDE

Warren motions that he has decided this is not for him.

Ted shoots him a look that makes Warren feel like a

sissy. Convinced it's not too dangerous, Warren

decides to go for it and Ted follows.

--At the bottom of the slide Ted splashes into the huge

pool of water, laughing, having a blast. Then he looks

around...no sign of Warren. Concerned, Ted dives

underwater and a moment later Resurfaces clutching a

GASPING Warren.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

--Mary pumps Warren's stomach as he coughs water out of

his mouth. Ted looks on sheepishly.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Ted and Warren walk down a city sidewalk. As they pass

In the window there is a mannequin dressed in a Super-

EXT. SCENIC PIER - MIAMI - DAY

--Ted and Mary are walking arm and arm on a SCENIC PIER

where PEOPLE ARE FISHING. Right behind them are Magda

and Herb (the Homeless guy) enjoying one another's

company. Ted is on top of the world, feeling good,

looking good-right up until he gets the HOOK IN HIS

MOUTH. Suddenly he gets YANKED OUT OF FRAME.

EXT. SCENIC PIER - MIAMI - DAY

has his FOOT ON HIS FACE as he STRUGGLES TO REMOVE THE

HOOK. Mary looks on, concerned.

before Mary notices.

EXT. BATTING CAGE - MIAMI - DAY

while Mary looks on helplessly. Finally Ted goes into

the cage, SIGNALS THE GUY TO STOP THE PITCHING MACHINE,

comforts Warren whose LEFT EYE IS BLACK AND BLUE AND COMPLETELY

CLOSED.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Ted shows up at Mary's apartment door carrying a BOUQUET OF

FLOWERS and a BASEBALL. When he KNOCKS, the door opens.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Ted peeks around the corner and sees a SOMBER Mary sitting on the

couch.

Mary doesn't look up. Ted ENTERS, revealing his gifts.

Mary finally looks up but doesn't smile.

Ted tries to hide his horror.

Mary picks up a letter off the coffee table and hands it to him.

Ted takes a quick look and then drops it on the table.

Ted CLEARS HIS THROAT.

Mary stands up.

Mary starts to get emotional.

Mary looks away.

And so Ted does.

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ted comes out of the building, a broken man. He paces back and

forth on the sidewalk, manic with despair. Then he seems to grow

angry. He rifles through his pockets until he finds a SLIP OF

PAPER.

TED'S POV

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

the carpet.

No answer. Suddenly he HEARS SOMEONE out in the hall, so he ducks

behind the door.

Healy and Tucker ENTER the apartment and stop in their tracks when

they see the MESS.

Again, no answer. Suddenly Ted SLAMS THE DOOR shut and grabs Healy

by the collar.

Ted releases Healy and glares at him.

Tucker goes into the kitchen.

into the room with A HUGE, GREAT-DANE-SIZE LUMP in his midsection.

Tucker backs away nervously.

Healy grabs Tucker by the neck.

This gets Ted's attention.

Ted thinks about this.

Ted walks out the door leaving Healy and Tucker to stare each

then looks back at the snake.

Healy and Tucker grab Dom and throw him down on the couch.

Suddenly Magda ENTERS from her bedroom. She's holding a half-eaten

BANANA SPLIT. Herb, the Homeless Man, follows after her, sporting

a Tom Jones and buttoning up his shirt.

At first no one knows what to say. Then:

Magda heads back into her bedroom and Herb follows.

Tucker is stumped for a second, then:

Healy slaps Tucker in the back of the head.

Before he can respond, Ted ENTERS.

Ted can hardly believe Dom is there.

You're Woogie

?

Everyone turns to Healy.

Healy glares at Tucker.

Mary looks at Tucker, confused.

Tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods.

ENTERS, with Warren (wearing a walkman) beside him. Everyone is

stunned.

Tucker lowers his head.

Mary manages a smile.

Tucker, Healy, and Dom scoff.

Ted looks into Mary's eyes. She looks vulnerable.

Ted looks Mary in the eye, then starts for the door.

Ted then WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM. They all stand there in silence

for a moment, then Dom turns to Brett Favre.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Ted is walking down the street BLUBBERING LIKE A SCHOOLGIRL.

Everyone he passes stares at him. Suddenly Mary comes running down

the OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.

Ted stops and looks across the street at her. He wipes his eyes,

hopeful.

She holds up a RABBIT FOOT KEY-CHAIN.

They remain across the street from one another.

Ted starts to well up again.

Ted just stares at her.

Mary smiles.

Now Ted smiles.

The BEAMING Ted starts walking across the street. Suddenly a BUS

WHIZZES BY AND SMACKS TED BROADSIDE. He bounces around under the

bus like a rag doll, then finally squirts out the back end and

TUMBLES TO A LIMP STOP.

Mary SCREAMS and runs toward the body as a CROWD begins to gather.

She starts giving him CPR. Somebody covers him with a blanket.

Just then, another CAR WHIZZES OVER HIS FEET like speedbumps. The

crowd winces.

Then Ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open.

Mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven.

As the two lovebirds kiss, a LADY CALLS OUT:

ON THE LADY

As Ted REACTS to this, we pull UP, UP, UP, and
