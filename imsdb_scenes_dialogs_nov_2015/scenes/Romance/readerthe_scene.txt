Based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY. CREDITS

1995. A modern apartment, all cool and glass. MICHAEL BERG is

preparing breakfast, laying the table for two. He is 51, dark-

haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate

quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom

to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an

egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a

sparkling clean plate.

MICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the

sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can,

turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and

BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger. The

credits end.

It's half-serious. MICHAEL doesn't react.

MICHAEL produces a second boiled egg in a cup, seemingly from

nowhere, like a magician, and puts it on the table.

BRIGITTE has re-appeared from the bedroom, now in a dressing

gown. She's still half-serious.

MICHAEL smiles to himself.

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY

MICHAEL kisses BRIGITTE on the cheek as she departs.

He closes the door, then turns to the open door of the

bedroom. He looks at the mess of last night's love-making.

Then he goes to the window and looks out. A yellow U-Bahn

goes by.

INT. TRAM. DAY.

December 1958. MICHAEL, now 15, is sitting on a tram. He is

in a well-cut suit he's inherited, ill-fitting, with two-tone

shoes and tangled mop of hair. Sweat breaks out all over his

face. A WOMAN is staring at him. He's plainly feeling ill.

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY

1995. MICHAEL stands at the window, looking out.

INT. TRAM. DAY

1958. Impulsively MICHAEL gets up, rings the bell and gets

off at the next stop.

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY

1995. MICHAEL closes the window.

EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY

1958. It has come on to rain. MICHAEL is walking along the

street, looking more and more sickly. There is an archway

leading to a courtyard, and impulsively he darts inside to

get out of the rain. He begins to vomit. Opposite him is a

wood workshop open to the yard. A uniformed TRAM CONDUCTRESS

walks past.

MICHAEL'S body is turned away, his face invisible, his hand

over his mouth. She puts down her ticket machine on the

pavement and seizes him by the arm.

HANNA SCHMITZ has ash-blonde hair and is in her mid-thirties.

She disappears. He's sick again. She reappears with a bucket

of water to sluice down the pavement. She wipes his face down

with a wet cloth. Then she fills another bucket.

Effortlessly, HANNA takes MICHAEL in her arms. She holds his

head against her breasts. MICHAEL buries himself and slowly

he stops sobbing. Then he lifts his head.

EXT. STREET. DAY

HANNA and MICHAEL walk at a fair pace along a street, dotted

with the scaffolding of new building. HANNA is carrying his

satchel, she is pulling him by the arm.

EXT. BLUMENSTRASSE. DAY

They come up the road. It is now snowing. MICHAEL stops

outside his block, as if nervous she might come in.

MICHAEL smiles `Thank you' and goes in. HANNA is left alone.

She looks round, frowning, then sets off, stopping

uncertainly at the crossroads to check for the way she came.

MICHAEL turns and watches, curious at her indecision.

INT. BERG APARTMENT. BLUMENSTRASSE. NIGHT

CARLA BERG is at the stove in the kitchen. She takes dinner

through for the BERG family, at a round table in a

traditional apartment, under a five-candled brass chandelier.

MICHAEL'S father, PETER, is a balding, abstracted man, eating

in oppressive silence. Next to him, his older brother THOMAS,

18, his older sister, ANGELA, and his younger sister, EMILY.

MICHAEL has his book in front of him, not touching his food.

CARLA looks reproachful.

INT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAY

MICHAEL is lying in a single bed, his face violently

inflamed. CARLA is with the DOCTOR, a much older man.

MICHAEL turns into the pillow, a wet patch beneath his head.

Delusional with fever, he senses a presence at the door. He

turns. It's EMILY. But at once CARLA's arm pulls her away.

They vanish. The door closes. In the corridor the DOCTOR is

heard.

INT & EXT. BERG APARTMENT. DAY

1959. A sunny day in March. MICHAEL's bed has been moved

beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun. He is

sitting up, working on his stamp collection. CARLA is moving

round behind him, tidying the room.

EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY

MICHAEL is standing holding a small bunch of flowers. He is

looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only. The

woodyard is busy. WORKMEN come out of the building.

INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY

MICHAEL comes up the stairwell, once grand, now in decay -

green linoleum and faded red paint. The sound of a

sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment.

Inside, HANNA is ironing in a sleeveless smock, blue with red

flowers. Her hair is fastened in a clip. She looks at him a

moment.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

The flat is without decoration, an enfilade of small rooms. A

stove, a sink, a tub, a boiler, a table, a few wooden chairs.

There is no window, just a balcony door to let light into the

room. HANNA carries on ironing.

MICHAEL puts them beside the sink. HANNA has a blanket and a

cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she

irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and

puts it over one of the chairs.

HANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with

the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers.

He watches her bare arms moving back and forth. She looks

broad-planed, strong. She is at peace with being watched. She

puts one pair of knickers down, then does another. Then she

upends the iron.

MICHAEL goes out into the hall. The kitchen door is slightly

open. HANNA takes off her smock and stands in a green slip.

Her stockings are hanging over the back of a chair.

She picks one up, rolls it, smooths it up over her calf and

knee, then attaches it to her suspender. She reaches for the

other. The flesh is bare between her legs. MICHAEL watches,

riveted. HANNA seems oblivious. But as she is about to put

the second stocking on, she looks at him. She drops her

dress, and straightens, holding her stare. In response, he

blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat. The door

slams.

INT. STAIRS. DAY

MICHAEL runs down the stairs in terror and shame, and out the

front door.

EXT. COURTYARD. DAY

The WORKMEN look up, curious, as MICHAEL flies by, slamming

the outer door.

INT. BEDROOM. DAWN

MICHAEL is lying in bed. He looks up at the sound of a tram

going by outside.

EXT. STREET. DAWN

The tram making its way along the quiet street.

INT. BEDROOM. DAWN

MICHAEL gets out of bed and quickly gets dressed.

INT. TRAM. DAY

MICHAEL, reading a book, watches unobserved, fascinated as

HANNA collects tickets. She calls out the name of the next

stop. She doesn't see him as she works.

EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY

MICHAEL is standing on the other side   of the street from

HANNA'S courtyard. He is in two minds   about whether to go in.

The WOODWORKERS are loading a van. He   waits for them to

finish before he slips in through the   archway, making his way

to the stairs.

INT. LANDING. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

MICHAEL is sitting on the steps of the first landing. Then,

as if from nowhere, HANNA is suddenly standing behind him, in

uniform, carrying a box of coal in one hand, a scuttle in the

other. She looks tired but not surprised to see him.

HANNA walks straight past him. For a moment he tenses as if

there might be some contact. But she goes by.

INT. CELLAR. DAY

MICHAEL opens the door. He turns on a dim light. There is a

flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke,

poured in from the street. He goes down to the bottom, and

picks up a bucket. He digs in to the coke, and at once it

comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

HANNA is at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of milk. She

has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie. MICHAEL comes

in with the two buckets of coal, his face and clothes filthy.

She roars with laughter, full-throated.

MICHAEL sees himself in the mirror, but she has already got

up, going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen.

HANNA opens the tap. There's a boiler, and steaming hot water

comes out. MICHAEL takes off his sweater, then stops.

HANNA takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door. He

undresses. She puts his sweater on the balcony rail.

On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him.

MICHAEL is naked. HANNA takes his clothes from the chair. He

gets into the bath. She goes to the balcony. In the bath, he

submerges himself. HANNA goes out and shakes his clothes out

in the open air.

When he comes up from under the water, she is laying his

clothes back on the chair. She picks up the shampoo and hands

it to him.

MICHAEL washes his hair, then submerges again. When he comes

back up, HANNA is holding out a large towel. He gets out,

turning away to hide his erection. From behind, she wraps his

body and rubs him dry. Then she lets the towel fall. She puts

her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. He

turns and faces her.

MICHAEL looks at her, awed.

At once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. MICHAEL

goes down onto the floor, HANNA on top of him. All the time,

she's staring into his eyes. He can't take it. He closes his

eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. She puts her hand

over his mouth to smother the noise.

INT. DINING ROOM. BERG APARTMENT. NIGHT

The family is half-way through their meal. MICHAEL is sitting

watching them eat, thinking about his lovemaking with HANNA.

He reaches for more stew. THOMAS goes on eating, a look of

contempt on his face, too superior to engage in this.

CARLA smiles benignly. EMILY knows she's right. They all eat

on for a few moments.

MICHAEL can't breathe, as if some decisive moment in his life

has been reached. PETER is looking at him, seeming to know

what's going on.

EXT. SCHOOL. DAY

A massive brownstone building. The whole SCHOOL is coming

out, but MICHAEL is first, in a desperate hurry, waving

goodbye to his friends and running quickly away.

INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY

MICHAEL comes quickly up the stairs. The door of HANNA'S

apartment is ajar. He pushes it open.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

HANNA is at the sink. MICHAEL comes in, precipitate, tearing

off his clothes and embracing her at the same time. He drops

his trousers and lifts her onto the sink. He comes in about

twenty seconds. He stands sweating.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

They are on the bed. He is lying underneath her. HANNA leads

his hands to her face, then down her body. She begins to

move, and in response, he moves too. He watches awed as she

comes.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

HANNA has fallen asleep on MICHAEL'S chest. He is awake,

looking at the birthmark on her left shoulder. The sound of

the wood yard below. He kisses the birthmark. She stirs.

She opens her eyes. A look of suspicion.

MICHAEL waits a moment.

HANNA smiles, as if there were something funny about it.

INT. CLASSROOM. SCHOOL. DAY

A TEACHER, in his sixties, has scrawled the words `Odysseus',

`Hamlet' and `Faust' on the blackboard. The class of BOYS is

attentive. Next to him, his friend HOLGER SCHLUTER. Across

the way, RUDOLF.

MICHAEL looks content. The bell goes.

INT. CORRIDOR. SCHOOL. DAY

The BOYS come pouring out cheerfully into the corridor and

head to the next classroom. MICHAEL'S demeanour has changed.

There's a knowingness, a swagger, a confidence which is new.

MICHAEL lingers for a moment, then slopes off in the opposite

direction, alone.

EXT. SCHOOL. DAY

MICHAEL comes out the back door of the school, unobserved,

climbs over the railings and starts to run down the street.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. EVE

Later. Dark. MICHAEL is almost asleep, HANNA awake.

MICHAEL thinks a moment.

MICHAEL smiles slightly.

MICHAEL grins, pleased to be able to do something. He goes

and gets his satchel. HANNA turns on a light.

HANNA looks at him a moment.

HANNA makes no reaction.

MICHAEL reaches down to the satchel and pulls out a book.

There is a silence as MICHAEL absorbs the idea.

MICHAEL grins, embarrassed, then opens the book.

INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT

Later. They are in the bath together. HANNA takes a piece of

soap and runs it lovingly down his cheek. Then she passes the

soap across his stomach.

He smiles.

INT. GYMNASIUM. DAY

MICHAEL is playing handball with terrific physical

confidence. A couple of bruising physical encounters. HOLGER,

RUDOLF and MICHAEL all laugh. The whistle blows. Game over.

EXT. TRAM. DAWN

An empty tram moving through the eerie early morning streets.

MICHAEL appears walking alongside it and gets on.

INT. TRAM. DAWN

MICHAEL is sitting in the second carriage. He looks up. The

CONDUCTRESS is HANNA. At first, she does not notice him.

MICHAEL watches, waiting to be noticed. She turns round and

looks at him. He smiles in greeting but she makes no

acknowledgement at all. She turns away. He frowns,

bewildered.

EXT. TRAM. DAY

The tram is heading out of town.

INT. TRAM. DAY

HANNA is now talking animatedly to the DRIVER. They are

getting on very well, laughing together and chatting. MICHAEL

is still by himself in the second carriage, looking foolish.

EXT. TRAM. DAY

The tram comes to a halt and PASSENGERS get on.

INT. TRAM. DAY

HANNA is now in the busy second carriage, collecting tickets.

MICHAEL looks up expectantly. But as he holds up his ticket,

HANNA makes no reaction except to clip it. She turns away

without speaking. The tram comes to a halt again, and

MICHAEL, humiliated, bolts for the door.

EXT. ROAD. DAY

MICHAEL watches the tram disappears up the hill. He looks

around, lost, in the middle of nowhere. A tractor goes by,

WORKERS heading to the fields. MICHAEL sets off to walk back

to town.

INT. LANDING. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

MICHAEL is on the stairs as HANNA comes up, in her uniform.

HANNA lets herself in, saying nothing.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

HANNA has gone in to put down her things at the kitchen

table. MICHAEL follows, desperate.

MICHAEL has yelled in desperation. HANNA looks him straight

in the eye.

HANNA turns and moves away.

HANNA goes to run a bath.

She takes off her clothes to get in. As soon as she does, he

gets up and goes into the other room. He sits by himself,

miserable. He hears her, bathing. Then finally gets up and

goes back in. She is still in the bath.

HANNA looks at him thoughtfully.

They smile. But MICHAEL has a more urgent question.

In the bath, she shakes her head.

She nods.

She looks at him. Then she nods.

INT. BEDROOM. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

MICHAEL is sitting on the side of the bed. HANNA comes in,

wrapped in a towel.

MICHAEL gets it out of his pocket. HANNA has lain down on the

bed, completely content.

MICHAEL sits at the foot of the bed and starts to read.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

HANNA is baking bread. MICHAEL is on a chair beside her with

a book.

He starts to read.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. EVE

HANNA is in the bath. MICHAEL is reading a Shakespeare sonnet

to her.

She pulls him into the bath.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

HANNA is sewing. MICHAEL is reading Huckleberry Finn.

He starts acting out Jim, and the two of them collapse

laughing.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

MICHAEL is at the bottom of the bed. HANNA is lying inside.

He is reading Lady Chatterley's Lover.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. EVE

MICHAEL reads Tin-Tin to HANNA, who is lying on the bed. They

are both looking at the pictures.

They fall back onto the bed.

MICHAEL reaches for a book.

HANNA'S look is so far-away she doesn't seem to hear the

question. Silence. Then :

She throws the book away and they begin to make love.

INT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAWN

First light. Dawn breaking outside the window. MICHAEL is

working at his desk, the surface covered in stamps, his

collection book open. He picks one with a pyramid on it and

looks at it. Underneath, MICHAEL'S VOICE reading Intrigue and

Love by Schiller.

INT & EXT. SHOP. DAY

Seen from outside, a shop full of stamps. MICHAEL and a STAMP

DEALER with white hair and a moustache. MICHAEL is offering

his pyramid stamp, his gestures becoming desperate as the

STAMP DEALER shakes his head, clearly not giving him as much

as he hopes.

Then MICHAEL concedes, the DEALER concedes, and a bunch of

notes are handed across. MICHAEL runs exhilarated out into

the street.

EXT. HILL. DAY

HANNA and MICHAEL are whizzing down a hill together on

bicycles. He has a rucksack. It's a rural paradise - hills on

all sides, a gleaming river below, the sun shining brightly.

She is wearing a blue dress.

EXT. CAFE. DAY

They come to a cafe and sit down outside. They pick up the

menus on the table. A WAITRESS arrives.

MICHAEL starts giving the order. Next to them are a group of

BOY SCOUTS, who are laughing among themselves.

They all laugh. HANNA watches them nervously.

EXT. CAFE. DAY

The meal finished, MICHAEL is alone, paying the bill.

The WAITRESS goes. HANNA returns from inside. MICHAEL holds

out his arm to her, which she takes. They walk away towards

their bikes. He is smiling. MICHAEL looks round, then dares

to reach across and kiss her on the lips. The WAITRESS

watches.

EXT. CHURCH. DAY

They get off their bikes at a small church. MICHAEL stops and

gets out a map and a guide book.

The sound of a choir from inside.

INT. CHURCH. DAY

MICHAEL and HANNA enter tentatively to find a choir

rehearsing Bach. It is a traditional German scene - whole

families singing together at the altar. HANNA is transported,

entranced at the sound of the music. MICHAEL watches.

EXT. RIVERSIDE. DAY

HANNA is in a river, the water up to her calves, her skirt

tied round her thighs. She is completely absorbed. Then she

looks up, aware of being watched. MICHAEL is sitting with a

notebook.

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY

1995. MICHAEL, now 51, is standing by his desk. He opens a

drawer. He takes out the recognizable notebook. He opens its

yellowing pages and looks at the poetry. Then flips the

pages, to some handwritten lists - the words `Odyssey',

`Schnitzler', `Chekhov', `Zweig' with numbers beside them.

MICHAEL flaps it shut, puts it back and turns to go out.

INT. STREET. DAY

MICHAEL leaves his apartment block. He gets into his black

Mercedes.

INT. CAR. DAY

MICHAEL is listening on the radio to the same Bach music they

heard in the church. He drives through the thriving modern

city. Beyond, the huge cranes and gouged-out building sites

of a city under construction.

EXT. STREET. DAY

MICHAEL swings his car into place. He gets out and heads

across the road, prosperous, purposeful.

INT. LOBBY. COURTHOUSE. DAY

An ASSISTANT meets MICHAEL with his robe which he pulls on as

he walks quickly through an elaborate lobby. GERHARD BADE,

also in his fifties, also robed, falls in step.

A robed ASSISTANT is waiting outside the door with documents

he hands to MICHAEL. They all go in.

INT. COURTROOM. DAY

MICHAEL joins his CLIENT, just seconds before the FEMALE

JUDGE comes in and everyone stands. Silence. The JUDGE looks

at MICHAEL disapprovingly, sensing his lateness. Everyone

sits. MICHAEL sits, thinking back.

INT. STAIRWAY. SCHOOL. DAY

1958. A sheriff's posse of sixteen-year old GIRLS, come

laughing, blushing towards the classroom. One of them is

talking excitedly to the other.

They smile together and head for the classroom.

INT. SCHOOL. DAY

The BOYS are already in place, dotted round, as the GIRLS

come in. There are cries of `Here they come'. Then the

TEACHER comes in.

Not far from MICHAEL, a GIRL sits across the aisle, virginal

with brown hair, brown summer skin.

The TEACHER comes in. The class quietens.

INT. SCHOOL. DAY

Later. The TEACHER is in full flow. MICHAEL can't take his

eyes off SOPHIE.

The TEACHER breaks off.

The whole class cracks up. MICHAEL blushes.

EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY

MICHAEL is riveted as SOPHIE swims fast and lithe through the

water. Around him, YOUNG PEOPLE are lounging round on towels.

It's the social centre. HOLGER and RUDOLF are rubbing their

hair with towels as SOPHIE approaches.

MICHAEL looks across to where a group of AMERICANS are

shouting and playing a very loud game of volleyball.

He looks SOPHIE straight in the eye. There is a sudden

silence, MICHAEL looking straight at SOPHIE. SOPHIE looks

down. Then MICHAEL moves slightly to pack up his stuff.

EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY

MICHAEL is cycling back towards town, a smile on his face.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

MICHAEL flies up the stairs, then goes in. HANNA is sitting

sewing. He kisses her on the cheek as he gets out a book.

At once he sits down opposite her. A ritual.

HANNA looks, seeing right through him.

INT. GARAGE. DAY

A huge tram-shed full of empty trams. HANNA is at the end of

the garage, talking to the SUPERVISER, a large man in his

fifties.

He moves away. HANNA looks distraught.

EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY

MICHAEL is watching SOPHIE swimming, a look of anxiety in his

eye, when HOLGER touches his shoulder.

HOLGER and RUDOLF disappear to get dressed. SOPHIE appears in

her swimming costume.

The others are furious with him. They all go off.

EXT. STREET. DAY

MICHAEL is cycling towards HANNA'S apartment, his hair wet

from the lake, looking equally unhappy.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

HANNA is sitting unhappily as MICHAEL reads to her. They are

both in a bad mood.

HANNA just shrugs. She goes and sits at the table to drink

tea. MICHAEL is irritated.

She has snapped at him, razor-like.

HANNA puts down her cup, angry. She goes into the bedroom and

slams the door. He sits, the magic of the day gone. He gets

up and opens the bedroom door. HANNA is on the bed.

Silence. HANNA lets time go by. Then :

HANNA reaches for a book from beside the bed. She throws it

down on the cover.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

HANNA is on the edge of the bath, running water. She has a

pale blue flowered smock. She is running with sweat. The

smock sticks to her. MICHAEL gets out a book. HANNA drops

lavender oil into the bath. MICHAEL stands in the bath and

she washes his body.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

They are making love on the bed. It's intense. At one point

she moves on top of him. She holds his head between her

hands, as if she would crush the life out of him. Then she

lets go.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

They are both sweating, exhausted. She looks a moment.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY

MICHAEL has gone. HANNA washes out milk bottles and empties

them into the sink. Then she picks up her luggage and leaves

the empty apartment.

EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY

MICHAEL is sitting on the pier watching as HOLGER, RUDOLF and

SOPHIE swim competitively out to a pontoon, then turn back,

full of energy and high spirits. MICHAEL watches for a while,

then suddenly he gets up and starts to run away from them

all.

But MICHAEL is running away across the lakeside beach.

INT. LANDING & HANNA'S APARTMENT. DUSK

MICHAEL opens the door. He goes in. The apartment is emptied,

the rented furniture in place, all trace of HANNA gone. He

looks round. He looks at the empty bath, the tap above it. He

opens the kitchen cupboards - some coffee, sugar, that's

about it. He goes into the bedroom, the bed stripped bare. He

lies down on the bed.

INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

MICHAEL lying on the bed, curled up, in his clothes, like a

foetus, asleep.

INT. APARTMENT. DAY

The family at breakfast. MICHAEL slips quietly in the main

door, trying to go to his room without being heard. EMILY

runs to look.

Sheepishly MICHAEL appears.

PETER looks. He seems to know exactly what's been going on.

EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DUSK

MICHAEL is alone in the deserted pool. He is on the jetty. He

takes off his clothes and slips into the water. Just his

head, like a seal's, at one end, just out of the water, quite

still.

INT. COURTHOUSE. NIGHT

1995. MICHAEL sitting alone, thinking back.

EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DUSK

1958. The sun slants, and for a few seconds the water

dazzles. He slips his head under.

INT. COURTHOUSE. DAY

1995. MICHAEL still sitting thoughtfully by himself in the

empty court. Then he looks up. An ASSISTANT has appeared.

He gets up.

INT. BRASSERIE. BERLIN. NIGHT

JULIA is already at the table in a chic modern brasserie. She

is a sympathetic young woman of around 23. MICHAEL

approaches. When she sees him, she gets up.

MICHAEL leans in and kisses her on the cheek.

They're uneasy. She looks a moment, then they sit down.

INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT

Later. They have eaten. They both have big glasses of red

wine. It's more relaxed.

JULIA nods.

JULIA doesn't answer.

JULIA colours, on the verge of tears. Then she looks away.

INT & EXT. CAR. NIGHT

They drive through the gleaming streets. It's been raining -

Berlin is glistening. Their voices :

EXT. CAR. DAY

MICHAEL lets JULIA out, and is watching her safely to her

door from the car.

MICHAEL suddenly gets out himself.

JULIA doesn't need to say anything.

JULIA smiles.

MICHAEL hugs her, his heart aching with love. JULIA goes in

to her place. MICHAEL is left standing still in the plaza

outside, not moving. Underneath the sound of what follows,

thirty years previously.

INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY

1966. A WOMAN LECTURER has a class of about 75 STUDENTS. From

their hair, their dress, it could only be the 1960s.

Nearly all the STUDENTS leave, talking among themselves. Just

eight are left, dotted around the huge room. MICHAEL is one

of them, now 22, in a corduroy jacket and tie. There is a

lull. MICHAEL looks round at the group of oddballs, then

finds ROHL, distinguished, greying, is already in front of

them.

A calm STUDENT with long hair smiles at MICHAEL. She looks

like Francoise Hardy. She murmurs.

INT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT

MICHAEL is working alone at his desk, a light on. The door of

his extremely modest student digs is open. MARTHE appears at

the door, silently. He looks up.

But neither of them move. MARTHE just smiles from the door.

MARTHE shrugs slightly.

They smile at one another. She goes.

INT. TRAIN. DAY

The seminar group, long-haired, hippyish, is on the train :

PROFESSOR ROHL, with MARTHE, DIETER and a few others. MICHAEL

catches MARTHA'S eye. They smile. Then he opens the window,

cheerful.

EXT. TOWN HALL. MANNHEIM. DAY

The STUDENTS are having a cigarette in front of the huge

building. Two black vans with barred windows come by,

carrying prisoners. The first one veers close to MICHAEL on

the pavement, then disappears into the inner courtyard. ROHL

smiles at MICHAEL.

INT. TOWN HALL. DAY

A courtroom has been improvised inside the town hall. There

are large windows, with milky glass, down the left-hand side.

As ROHL and the STUDENTS arrive, the court is a melee of

PHOTOGRAPHERS, LAWYERS and PUBLIC. The three JUDGES are

already in place, next to six selected CITIZENS. MICHAEL and

the others take places in the gallery

The PHOTOGRAPHERS go.

From being noisy and chaotic, the court is now silent.

DIETER grins at MICHAEL in anticipation.

MICHAEL is leaning down to get stuff out of his briefcase, as

MARTHE shakes a pen which isn't working.

So MICHAEL doesn't hear as the JUDGE speaks.

There is a row of six DEFENDANTS. The fifth woman is HANNA,

her hair tied in a knot, her gaze fixedly into the middle

distance, not looking towards the SPECTATORS. She is wearing

a grey dress with short sleeves. They all sit, sideways to

the gallery. HANNA rises to her feet. The words seem to come

very quietly, across a great distance.

It is only when the JUDGE repeats the name that MICHAEL looks

up, hearing it for the first time.

MICHAEL is rigid, blank, just staring.

HANNA doesn't answer.

HANNA has a DEFENCE COUNSEL, a young man, beside her, who is

about to get up. But the JUDGE forestalls him.

Everyone waits.

MICHAEL is intent now, so are the STUDENTS beside him.

ROHL leans into MICHAEL.

INT. TRAIN. DAY

MICHAEL is hanging out of the window of the train, smoking a

cigarette.

INT. TRAIN. DAY

MICHAEL sits down in his seat. ROHL moves to sit opposite

him.

ROHL is looking at him. MICHAEL doesn't answer.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

The train hurtles through the German countryside.

INT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT

A student party, in a candle-lit room. MARTHE is singing to a

guitar. It's been going on for hours - the STUDENTS are on

the floor with beer and cigarettes. The front door is open.

DIETER, beer in hand, looks out to the balcony where he can

see MICHAEL bent away from them, all by himself.

EXT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT

MICHAEL, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out

into the night. His eye lands on a student room in which a

couple are making love.

INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY

The small STUDENT GROUP is now rattling around informally in

the big lecture room.

ROHL waits a moment for a STUDENT to answer.

Everyone laughs.

ROHL is staring at him thoughtfully.

There are some smiles, but DIETER rides over the reaction.

There's a silence. That's clearly why some of them are there.

DIETER frowns, unhappy.

ROHL looks unapologetic.

INT. COURTROOM. MANNHEIM. DAY

ROHL is leaning forward, attentive. HANNA is standing,

opposite the JUDGE, who holds up a book called MOTHER &

DAUGHTER : A STORY OF SURVIVAL.

The judge waits. HANNA seems arrogant, defiant.

There is a stir among the other DEFENDANTS and in the court.

They start talking to their LAWYERS.

HANNA shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious.

The other DEFENDANTS stir with animosity, but the JUDGE is

intent, following his own line.

He waits. HANNA nods slightly.

The JUDGE frowns, genuinely surprised that she doesn't seem

to understand his point.

HANNA is looking at the JUDGE - a perfectly straight

question. MICHAEL smiles slightly, proud of her. Everyone in

the court waits for the JUDGE to answer. Silence. ROHL is

impassive. But HANNA follows her own thoughts. She quietly

asks herself a question.

INT. LOBBY. TOWN HALL. DAY

MICHAEL is alone, smoking. On a bench, side by side, are two

women. One is very small, dark, in her sixties. The other is

composed, formidable, elegant, in her thirties. ROSE and

ILANA MATHER. They look up, catching MICHAEL's eye. Then a

CLERK leans in to the younger woman.

The two women go into the court. The door closes.

INT. LOBBY & COURTROOM. DAY

MICHAEL is alone in the now-deserted lobby, unwilling to go

back. Then he goes to the door. He opens it a little. The

sound of the trial. He opens the door fully. MICHAEL can see

that it is ILANA who is testifying. The court is

conspicuously packed. Large black-and-white photographs of

the labour camp now dominate the room. MICHAEL comes quietly

into the back of the room as the trial goes on.

MICHAEL has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near

ROSE who is sitting in the body of the court. He looks across

to the DEFENDANTS. RITA BECKHART, a large older woman, is one

of a couple who isn't bothering to listen.

ILANA points with her finger at the DEFENDANTS.

The last finger has been to HANNA. MICHAEL watches, but HANNA

does not react.

HANNA stares back, impassive. MICHAEL watches.

HANNA looks back, not apologizing.

INT. LOBBY. TOWN HALL. DAY

MICHAEL sits alone, head in hands, in despair.

INT. COURTROOM. DAY

Now ROSE is testifying. The court is quiet, focused.

MICHAEL looks along the row to where ILANA is now sitting.

MICHAEL watches as ROSE looks across to ILANA. ILANA stares

back at her. MICHAEL watches the exchange as ROSE nods, as if

accepting she must go ahead and speak.

ROSE nods.

ROSE turns, in tears, to look at ILANA.

INT. LECTURE ROOM. LAW SCHOOL. DAY

The group is back in the big hall. But the atmosphere is

grim. It's a while before DIETER speaks.

ROHL is very still, like an analyst who is finally leading

his patient to the heart of things.

Everyone is shocked at his violent passion.

MICHAEL can't answer. DIETER gets up, outraged now.

DIETER turns, furious.

One of the group walks out.

DIETER'S passion is so great that everyone is shaken.

MICHAEL is white. The atmosphere is electric.

EXT. EMPTY ROAD. DAY

MICHAEL walks along an empty wooded road, miles from

anywhere. The sun is shining through the trees behind him.

EXT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY

The wire fence of a concentration camp, deserted. MICHAEL,

with a back-pack, goes alone through the metal gate. MICHAEL

walks among the deserted empty huts.

INT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY

Inside one of the huts, MICHAEL is by himself staring at a

line of empty beds. He moves on, overwhelmed, lost. He passes

through the showers. Then he comes to a room with vast metal

cages on either side. In the cages, the countless dusty shoes

of the exterminated.

INT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY

MICHAEL opens a door and walks into a room with a line of gas

ovens. He walks past them. Then he stands beside them, his

head down.

INT. COURTROOM. DAY

HANNA is standing being examined by the JUDGE. Large

photographs and maps of the village, with the lay-out of the

church, are now on display.

He waits. HANNA doesn't reply.

The JUDGE turns to the row of DEFENDANTS.

ILANA and ROSE are not far away from MICHAEL and the

STUDENTS. The JUDGE puts down a bound handwritten document.

There is a flurry of paperwork among the DEFENDANTS and

LAWYERS as they turn to their copies.

The JUDGE waits.

HANNA takes a look to the other DEFENDANTS. For the first

time her poise is crumbling.

The JUDGE waits.

HANNA can't answer - she has no answer.

HANNA does not reply.

The other DEFENDANTS interrupt to call out `She was in

charge'.

RITA BECKHART has called out from her place. The JUDGE looks

at HANNA a moment.

At once HANNA'S COUNSEL rises.

A piece of paper and a pen are put down in front of HANNA.

Her COUNSEL moves to the bench. MICHAEL stares, first at her,

then at the pen and paper, an apprehension rising in him.

INT & EXT. DAY AND NIGHT. FLASHBACKS

MICHAEL thinks back, to HANNA in her bedroom saying `No you

read', to her looking puzzled at the menu on the bicycle

trip, and to her throwing a book away in the apartment. At

this moment, MICHAEL realises she is illiterate.

INT. COURTROOM. DAY

Back in the courtroom, HANNA looks up to the JUDGE to stop

the conference.

MICHAEL, in a panic, pushes along his row, past ROHL and the

others, who all look up, knowing something is going on. HANNA

turns, as if sensing him behind her.

INT. STAIRS. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY

MICHAEL is sitting on the steps outside the lecture room.

ROHL walks straight past him.

INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY

MICHAEL comes into the room and sits down, smoking a

cigarette. ROHL waits.

MICHAEL looks at him.

MICHAEL stubs out his cigarette.

Two STUDENTS come in for the seminar.

Chastened, they leave.

MICHAEL doesn't answer.

ROHL gets up.

INT. REMAND CELL. EVE

HANNA is sitting on the edge of her bed. A GUARD comes to the

door.

HANNA is taken aback for a moment. Then she gets up.

EXT. PRISON WAITING ROOM. DAY

MICHAEL is standing smoking a cigarette in the waiting area.

A whole number of visitors, old people, children, families

are waiting. Some kids are playing with a football. Then a

GUARD arrives and calls out names. MICHAEL's name is called.

INT. MEETING ROOM. PRISON. DAY

HANNA is led swiftly down a prison corridor towards her

meeting and sat down at a desk to wait.

EXT. PRISON YARD. DAY

MICHAEL is led in the GROUP towards the visiting room. It has

come on to snow. As he walks towards the room, he loses

heart. He changes his mind. The rest of the GROUP go on, as

he falls behind, watching them go. He begins to turn back.

INT. MEETING ROOM. PRISON. DAY.

HANNA sits down at the empty table, waiting.

EXT. PRISON YARD. DAY

MICHAEL turns away and heads back the way he came.

INT. MEETING ROOM. PRISON. DAY

HANNA looks round. Nobody is coming. She waits more.

INT. PRISON. EVE

HANNA is still waiting. Then she is led back to her cell.

INT. MARTHE'S ROOM. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT

MICHAEL appears at the door of MARTHE'S room. She is working

at her desk. He smiles and closes the door.

They kiss. She starts to pull his clothes off. He lets her.

He makes no move to undress her. She takes all his clothes

off until he is naked, and she remains clothed. He looks at

her a moment, then takes her in his arms and they go down on

the bed. They make love.

INT. MARTHE'S ROOM. NIGHT

MARTHE is apparently asleep, MICHAEL awake. As quietly as he

can MICHAEL tries to slip away.

INT. REMAND CELL. DAWN

HANNA is standing naked at the sink, preparing herself for

the day.

INT. STUDENT DIGS. MICHAEL'S ROOM. DAWN

MICHAEL is lying in his own bed, staring up at the ceiling,

not able to sleep. MICHAEL reluctantly pushes back the cover

and gets naked out of bed. Slowly he begins to dress.

INT. REMAND CELL. DAY

HANNA washes herself, naked.

INT. STUDENT DIGS. DAY

MICHAEL is dressed now. He stands in front of his mirror,

adjusting his tie.

INT. REMAND CELL. DAY

HANNA stands in front of the mirror, tying her tie. There is

a small, inadequate mirror in which she checks her dress - a

black suit, a white blouse and black tie. She looks very

formal.

INT. PRISON. DAY

HANNA is led through the prison by a GUARD.

EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY

A lot of people heading into the courtroom. As the seminar

group goes in, MICHAEL hangs back. ROHL looks at him as he

goes through the doors. MICHAEL is left outside, then goes to

watch as the vans arrive.

INT. COURTROOM. TOWN HALL. DAY

HANNA and the PRISONERS are led into the court. HANNA'S suit

is so formal that members of the public call out. `Nazi!

Nazi!' DIETER leans in to MARTHE. HANNA walks on to her

place.

INT. COURTROOM. DAY

Everyone rises as the JUDGES come in to take their places.

HANNA's face is resigned, without expression. The JUDGES sit.

The whole court goes quiet.

There are tears in MICHAEL's eyes as he watches.

ROHL, MARTHE, DIETER and the students are looking down on the

sentencing. MICHAEL is crying.

HANNA is impassive, not reacting. Then she turns and looks up

to the gallery.

EXT. COURTHOUSE. DAY

MICHAEL walks away through the cameras and news crews.

INT. TRAIN. DAY

MICHAEL sits on the train, thinking. The younger MICHAEL

becomes the older.

INT. TRAIN. DAY

1976. MICHAEL is sitting beside JULIA. MICHAEL is 32, JULIA

is a bright little 4 year-old in a coat. The countryside

speeding by.

EXT. BLUMENSTRASSE. DAY

MICHAEL walks with JULIA towards their old house. He looks

round, the memory of coming with HANNA as a sick boy 18 years

earlier clear in his mind. The same landmarks.

INT. DINING ROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAY

They are all three eating at the dinner table, eating a small

roast chicken.

MICHAEL smiles. Even CARLA smiles slightly.

looks down at her, full of love.

EXT. SCHONEBERG. BERLIN. NIGHT

On the other side of a busy Berlin street full of traffic,

MICHAEL holds JULIA'S hand, a loving father, to guide her

across the street.

INT. LANDING. GERTRUD'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. NIGHT

GERTRUD has come to the door, a shrewd-looking intelligent

woman, a little older than MICHAEL, very thin, in slacks and

a blouse. MICHAEL is standing outside with JULIA.

GERTRUD leans down and scoops JULIA up, kisses her. MICHAEL

stands on the step, hovering.

It doesn't look like it. He stands, not going.

GERTRUD gives JULIA her supper and puts her in front of the

TV. Then she comes back to MICHAEL.

GERTRUD says nothing.

They both smile.

He touches her arm.

GERTRUD looks level, not unkind.

MICHAEL turns to say goodbye.

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. NIGHT

MICHAEL standing in the empty room. It's eerily silent. He

goes to his bookcase. He runs his fingers along the spines,

as HANNA once did. He takes out a paperback of the Odyssey.

He looks at it a moment, then he starts to read to himself.

He sits back.

INT. HANNA'S CELL. DAWN

HANNA is in her cell, folding her blanket. She is 53, a new

austerity, a greyness about her. Her cell is modern, but

without decoration.

INT. PRISON. CORRIDOR. DAY

A GUARD comes along the corridor, calling out `Mail'. She

leans into Hanna's cell to tell her she has mail. HANNA is

obviously surprised.

T-shirt, microphone in hand, still reading.

INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT

Middle of the night. MICHAEL is lying on his back, still

reading.

INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY

MICHAEL takes a cassette and puts it into a white box. He

writes on the side ODYSSEY 6. Then he reaches up to put it on

a shelf next to boxes separately marked ODYSSEY 1,2,3,4,5.

Then he takes out a small notebook and cross-references the

new tape in a handwritten list.

INT. CELL. NIGHT

It's dark. HANNA is lying on the bed.

HANNA smiles with pleasure at his reading.

INT & EXT. MONTAGE. DAY & NIGHT

A montage of MICHAEL reading and HANNA listening. MICHAEL is

reading different books. He is animated now, excited. There

are extracts from The Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway) ;

Anatol (Schnitzler) ; The World of Yesterday (Zweig) and

Doctor Zhivago (Pasternak). MICHAEL catching fire with

excitement with what he is doing. HANNA collecting the tapes

from the mail room and organizing on her shelves - her

library growing.

INT. CELL. NIGHT

HANNA is lying in bed listening to a new tape.

EXT. EXERCISE YARD. PRISON. DAY

HANNA is walking round with other PRISONERS, in sequence.

Suddenly she stops dead, an idea hitting her.

INT. PRISON LIBRARY. DAY

The library is right next to the mail room. HANNA walks past

the mail room and goes to the library counter.

The LIBRARIAN goes to get it. HANNA stands, waiting and looks

at the stacks of books, for the first time seeing

possibility.

INT. CELL. DAY

HANNA is back in the cell. She puts down a new parcel and a

book. She puts the parcel to one side, then opens the book.

She then winds back the tape which is already in the

recorder.

She turns off the tape. She runs her finger along the title

`The Lady with the Little Dog'. She gets down a small

decorated metal tin, and takes a pencil from it. She starts

making the sounds. `The', `the', `the'... L, L, L, etc.

INT. CELL. NIGHT

HANNA is working now, circling the word `the' each time it

comes in the book. The book is covered in marks.

EXT & INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. EVE

1981. MICHAEL is coming down a busy Kreuzberg street. He is

37. He goes into his block. He opens the door : the place is

much more lived-in. He picks up his mail. Thumbing through

it, he sees a letter in childish handwriting. MICHAEL frowns,

opening it and taking out a piece of paper.

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. EVE

MICHAEL is holding a letter. He looks down at the writing :

`Thanks for the latest, kid. I really liked it.' He stares,

then puts it down and steps back stunned.

INT. CELL. DAY

HANNA stands with a new package. She opens it excitedly. She

takes out tapes. She looks for writing, a letter. There is

none. She turns the packing paper over and over, but there's

nothing. She stands, desolate.

INT. CELL. PRISON. NIGHT. MONTAGE

HANNA effortfully writing various letters - just a single

message on each. The pen working agonizingly across the

paper. First :

I WOULD LIKE MORE ROMANCE, LESS ADVENTURE

Next:

I AM NOT SURE WHAT KAFKA IS SAYING

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT

MICHAEL continuing to read to her on the machine.

INT. CELL. PRISON. NIGHT. MONTAGE

HANNA still writing.

DO YOU STILL LIKE DICKENS?

Then finally, many attempts at the same sentence, written

many times :

DO YOU RECEIVE MY LETTERS? WRITE TO ME, KID

INT. STUDY. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY

MICHAEL is reading the latest letter from HANNA. He looks at

it. "Do you receive my letters? Write to me, kid." MICHAEL

opens a drawer in a file box on the floor. There is a stack

of her letters inside. He puts the latest on top of the pile

and closes the drawer.

INT. CELL. PRISON. DAY

HANNA stands at her window, in despair.

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY

MS BRENNER is sitting at her desk in a simple, modern office.

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY

MICHAEL is sitting quite still.

INT. BRENNER'S OFFICE. DAY

There is a silence.

INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY

MICHAEL puts the phone down. He looks as if he has just been

handed a sentence. He gets up and stares at the wall which is

now stacked with all the books he has read. Then he goes to

his balcony.

EXT & INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY

MICHAEL stands looking out over Berlin from his balcony.

EXT. PRISON. DAY

MICHAEL walks along the road by the prison wall, then goes to

the guichet to sign in.

EXT. PRISON YARD. DAY

MICHAEL is waiting in a small barred waiting area as MS

BRENNER walks across the yard to open the gate and let

MICHAEL in.

INT & EXT. STAIRS & PASSAGE. PRISON. DAY

MS BRENNER is walking MICHAEL up the steps towards the prison

canteen. They pass GUARDS and INMATES.

INT. CANTEEN. PRISON. DAY

MS BRENNER leads MICHAEL to the door of the canteen.

MICHAEL sees an OLD WOMAN who is sitting at a table. Her blue

dress is stretched too tight across her heavy body. Her hair

is grey. She has a book in her lap, but she's not reading it.

A few PRISONERS are finishing their meal.

It takes MICHAEL a moment to realise the OLD WOMAN is HANNA.

Then HANNA becomes aware of being watched. She turns and

looks round. At once her face lights up. MICHAEL smiles back,

but as he approaches her, he fixes onto her inquiring look

and sees the light go out of her eyes, as if she has looked

at him and been disappointed. He sits down opposite her. She

smiles, weary.

She takes his hand. There is a long silence, MICHAEL unable

to think of anything to say. He withdraws his hand.

There's a moment's silence.

HANNA nods slightly.

There is a short silence.

MICHAEL doesn't answer.

After a few moments, he concedes.

There is a silence.

HANNA looks a moment, a haunting look, searching him.

There's a silence.

MICHAEL stares, devastated.

They look at each other. The other PRISONERS have already

gone. They stand up. She scans his face again, searching for

his thoughts. He takes her in his arms, a little awkward.

They walk side by side, back towards the door. Then by way of

saying goodbye, she takes his hand.

She stretches her arm out before she lets go of his hand,

then vanishes inside. MICHAEL walks on alone.

EXT. PRISON. EVE

MICHAEL comes out of the main entrance. He stands a moment,

looking round at the evening. MICHAEL walks to his car.

INT. HANNA'S ROOM. EVE

The room is simple, a bedroom to one side, a bathroom to the

other. It is all furnished with simple functional furniture.

The end of a hard day's work. MICHAEL hangs a picture over

the desk - a landscape, reminiscent of where they once went

cycling. The job is done. He looks round, grimly content.

INT. CELL. DAWN

HANNA is lying on her bed, fully dressed. She gets up and

gets some books down from the shelf. She puts them, one by

one, in a pile on the table. Then she takes off her shoes.

She stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table.

Her bare feet on the books. Then she reaches up.

EXT & INT. PRISON. DAY

MICHAEL gets out of the car. He is carrying a bunch of

flowers. He walks towards the prison. He leans in to the

GUARD who is in a modern office.

INT. PRISON. DAY

From the far end of the corridor, MICHAEL is seen sitting on

a bench. MS BRENNER comes out of her office and murmurs in

his ear. MICHAEL is seen nodding, ashen.

INT. CORRIDOR & CELL. PRISON. DAY

The two of them come together down the corridor. They stop at

the open door of the cell. The body has been removed. The

books are still on the floor. MICHAEL goes in. A bare table,

a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the

door. There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed

bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins.

MS BRENNER looks at him in confirmation. MICHAEL looks at the

two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the

cassette machine.

Above the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from

magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees.

One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours. MICHAEL

kneels on the bed to look at them. There are quotations,

articles, recipes, even sayings in HANNA'S childish

handwriting : `Spring lets its blue banner flutter through

the air' is one. Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the

young MICHAEL BERG receiving a prize from the school

principal. The headline `Michael Berg receives school

literature prize.'

MS BRENNER reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf. Then she

sits next to MICHAEL on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet

of paper from her suit pocket.

MICHAEL looks at the effortful handwriting on the page.

MS BRENNER looks at him.

MICHAEL shakes his head.

EXT. BRIDGE. MANHATTAN. DAY

MICHAEL rides in a taxi into Manhattan. A view of the

familiar skyline.

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE. DAY

MICHAEL'S taxi comes up Fifth Avenue. It draws up outside an

expensive apartment block. MICHAEL gets out and goes in, the

Manhattan skyline opening up behind him.

INT. LIVING ROOM. ILANA'S APARTMENT. DAY

A superbly appointed space full of great and expensive art.

MICHAEL has taken his coat off. ILANA MATHER appears,

elegant, well-dressed - on the surface, the spirit of

prosperous New York. She is now in her early fifties.

MICHAEL hesitates for a moment.

ILANA shakes her head.

MICHAEL shakes his head.

ILANA shifts slightly.

ILANA looks at him for a moment.

MICHAEL just looks at her.

MICHAEL stares back, understood for the first time.

ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.

ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.

MICHAEL reaches for his briefcase. He takes out the lavender

tea-tin, which he sets down on the table in front of ILANA.

ILANA lifts the tin.

She sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin.

MICHAEL nods slightly.

There's a silence.

There is the shadow of a smile.

ILANA smiles slightly. She puts her hand on top of the tin.

INT. ILANA'S HOUSE. DAY

ILANA is standing at the window watching down to the street

where MICHAEL is walking away. She has the tin in her hand.

When he's vanished, she turns and goes into her bedroom.

There on the dressing table, there is a framed photo of ILANA

with her mother in Germany before the war. She sets the tin

down beside the photo.

INT & EXT. CAR. DAY

1995. MICHAEL is driving JULIA in the big Mercedes through

the German countryside. He is tense, silent. JULIA takes a

sideways look at him, but he does not respond.

EXT. COUNTRY. DAY

They draw up at a church. It is the same one he and HANNA

passed on their bicycles years before. MICHAEL and JULIA get

out and walk towards the graveyard at the side.

EXT. CEMETERY. DAY

MICHAEL & JULIA stand at a deserted grave-side. The whole

cemetery is seen. MICHAEL stoops down and uncovers a simple

stone : HANNA SCHMITZ 1923-1988. JULIA watching, says her

name.

JULIA waits a moment.

JULIA looks, waiting. MICHAEL looks for a moment as if he

will not go on.

There is a moment, then they turn to stroll, MICHAEL talking,

starting to tell the story.

They walk away among the trees.
