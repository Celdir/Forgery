FADE IN:

NIGHT SEQUENCE

Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town

of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets

are deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over

the above scenes we hear voices praying:

CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through

the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly

toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we

hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice

is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly:

A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It

twinkles as Clarence speaks:

The stars fade out from the screen, and a light,

indistinguishable blur is seen.

The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a

group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill.

EXT. FROZEN RIVER AND HILL  DAY  CLOSE SHOT

Group of boys. They are preparing to slide down the hill on

large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out

onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill.

Series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the

hill and out onto the ice. As each boy comes down the others

applaud.

CLOSE SHOT

George Bailey at bottom of slide.

CLOSE SHOT  HARRY

On top of hill, preparing to make his slide.

MEDIUM SHOT

Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by

the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice

at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears

into the water.

CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE

MEDIUM SHOT

George jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to

pull him out he yells:

WIDER ANGLE

The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain.

When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they

pull them both to safety.

EXT. MAIN STREET  BEDFORD FALLS  SPRING AFTERNOON

MEDIUM SHOT

Five or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm,

whistling.  Their attention is drawn to an elaborate

horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the

street.

MEDIUM PAN SHOT

The carriage driving by. We catch a glimpse of an elderly

man riding in it.

CLOSE SHOT

The boys watching the carriage.

The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The

drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored

water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop:

INTERIOR DRUGSTORE  DAY

MEDIUM SHOT

George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter

on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish:

He clicks the lighter and the flame springs up.

WIDER ANGLE

George crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch,

a small girl, is seated, watching him. George goes on to get

his apron from behind the fountain.

CLOSE SHOT

Mr. Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room.

We see him take a drink from a bottle.

MEDIUM SHOT

George behind soda fountain. He is putting on his apron.

WIDER ANGLE

Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools

at the fountain. She is the same height as Mary and the same

age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people.

George regards the two of them with manly disgust. They are

two kids to him, and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy

counter.

George goes over to the candy counter.

George gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice

shoelaces.  Violet gives him the money.

Violet jumps down off her stool and exits. Mary, watching,

sticks out her tongue as she passes.

CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY AT FOUNTAIN

George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish.

He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her.

He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf

ear toward her.  She leans over, speaking softly.

CLOSE SHOT

Mary, whispering.

She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she

has said.

CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY

He turns back to the cash register, whistling.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain.

Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven,

chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It

is evident he has been drinking.

He turns back to the cash register when he notices an open

telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he

starts to read it.

INSERT: THE TELEGRAM

It reads: "We regret to inform you that your son, Robert,

died very suddenly this morning of influenza stop. Everything

possible was done for his comfort stop. We await instructions

from you.  EDWARD MELLINGTON Pres. HAMMERTON COLLEGE."

BACK TO SHOT

George puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses

itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the

ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward

Gower.

INT. PRESCRIPTION ROOM OF DRUGSTORE  DAY

CLOSE SHOT

Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box.

George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite

drunk.  Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the

floor.

CLOSE SHOT

Capsules spilling on floor at their feet.

BACK TO SHOT

George and Gower.

He picks up the capsules and puts them in the box. Gower

waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in

his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background.

George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the

powder for the capsules. Its label reads "POISON." George

stands still, horrified.

George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or

say.  His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison.

George's fingers fumble.

Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns

to him, the box in his hand.

INT. DRUGSTORE  DAY

MEDIUM SHOT

George comes out into main room. As he puts on his cap he

sees a Sweet Caporals ad which says:

INSERT

street. Mary follows him with her eyes.

EXT. STREET  DAY

MEDIUM SHOT

George runs down the street until he comes opposite a two-

story building with a sign on it reading: "Bailey Building

and Loan Association." He stops. Potter's carriage is waiting

at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs.

INT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN  DAY

FULL SHOT

The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There

is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. Before a

door marked:

"PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE", George's Uncle Billy stands,

obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. He is a

very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. With

him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a

waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and

Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk.  The office vibrates with

an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly

toward his father's office.

CLOSE SHOT

Uncle Billy listening at the door. As George is about to

enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.

During the foregoing, Cousin Tilly has answered the telephone,

and now she calls out:

INSERT

CLOSEUP  UNCLE BILLY'S LEFT HAND There are pieces of string

tied around two of the fingers, obviously to remind him of

things he has to do.

BACK TO SHOT

Uncle Billy looking at his hand.

He enters a door marked: "WILLIAM BAILEY, PRIVATE". George

stands irresolute a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs

of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but aware more

keenly of his personal crisis. He opens the door of his

father's office and enters.

INT. BAILEY'S PRIVATE OFFICE  DAY

MEDIUM SHOT

George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing

swirls on a pad. He looks tired and worried. He is a gentle

man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other

people's rights.  Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind

which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits

Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. The

following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument

had been in process for some time.

Goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT  POTTER AND BAILEY

CLOSE SHOT  POTTER AND BAILEY

George cannot listen any longer to such libel about his

father. He comes around in front of the desk.

He pushes George toward the door.

As George passes Potter's wheelchair he pushes the old man's

shoulder. The goon puts out a restraining hand.

George proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on

his shoulder. As they go:

hands.  George tries to protect himself as best he can.

INT. FRONT ROOM DRUGSTORE  DAY

CLOSE SHOT

Mary is still seated at the soda fountain. Each time she

hears George being slapped, she winces.

INT. BACK ROOM DRUGSTORE  DAY

CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND GOWER

George pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely

rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy

venomously.

George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower

looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced

on the shelf. He tears open the package, shakes the powder

out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then

abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to

look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened.

Gower steps toward him.

But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and,

sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is

crying too.

INT. LUGGAGE SHOP  DAY  (1928)

MEDIUM SHOT

It is late afternoon. A young man is looking over an

assortment of luggage. Across the counter stands Joe Hepner,

the proprietor of the store  he is showing a suitcase.

AS CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER to him, he turns and we get our

first glimpse of George as a young man. CAMERA HAS MOVED UP

to a CLOSEUP by now.

Suddenly, in action, as George stands with his arms

outstretched in illustration, the picture freezes and becomes

a still. Over this hold-frame shot we hear the voices from

Heaven:

CLOSE SHOT  THE SCREEN

The arrested CLOSEUP of George springs to life again.

He brings a large suitcase up from under the counter.

INT. GOWER'S DRUGSTORE  DAY

MEDIUM SHOT

The place is practically the same except that it is now full

of school kids having sodas, etc. A juke box and many little

tables have been added. It has become the hangout of the

local small fry.  There are now three kids jerking sodas.

Gower is a different man now  sober, shaven and good-humored.

He is behind the counter when George comes in. Gower's face

lights up when he sees George.

George suddenly sees the old cigar lighter on the counter.

He closes his eyes and makes a wish.

As he snaps the lighter the flame springs up.

George shakes Gower's hand vigorously and exits.

and Bert the motor cop, parked alongside.

Bert opens the door of the cab and puts George's suitcase

inside.

As George is about to enter the cab, he stops suddenly as he

sees Violet (now obviously a little sex machine) come toward

him. Her walk and figure would stop anybody. She gives him a

sultry look.

pounds on the ceiling with a broom.

She goes up the stairs.  Pop is smiling and poking his plate.

A commotion is heard on the stairs, the boys imitating fanfare

MUSIC. Down they come, holding their mother high between

them on their hands. They bring her into the dining room and

deposit her gracefully into Pop's lap.

Pop kisses her. Mother gives Pop a quick hug, then turns

with all the wrath she can muster on the two boys.

Annie crosses the room, holding her broom. Harry reaches out

for her.

As he pushes her through the kitchen door, he slaps her fanny.

She screams. The noise is cut off by the swinging door. George

and his mother sit down at the table.

at them, feeling very grown up and out of place.

Sam Wainwright comes in behind Harry, waggles his hands at

his ears as he talks.

George swings around, delighted to hear a familiar voice.

Leaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking

daggers at George. Mickey, a young punk who has had one too

many, is beside him.

Freddie needs no more. He takes the key from Mickey and turns

the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each

half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts.

Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so

engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers

and elders start to scurry off. As the floor opens, it reveals

an attractive, lighted swimming pool.  George and Mary are

so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening.

Spotlights concentrate on them. They mistake the screams for

cheers.

He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look

at each other.

Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly

on:

In his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's

bath robe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers

the robe around her.

Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that

moment of physical contact he knows he could never be

associated with this man.  George drops his hand with a

shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face.

George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which

his clothes are drying on a line. He is in his long winter

underwear.  He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at

the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the

tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved

problems.  Clarence is standing on the other side of the

stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous

seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night

shirt  with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at

the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.  The

tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them

suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but

each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or

says.  Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing

the tollkeeper.

The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of

it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's

attention, now picks up a copy of "Tom Sawyer" which is

hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the book.

The tollkeeper stares at him incredulously.

George looks up, surprised.

George and the tollkeeper react to this.

He leans forward to spit, but is stopped by Clarence's next

statement.

The tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George casually

looks at the strange smiling little man a second time.

George's hand goes to his mouth.

The tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash.

He has been leaning against the wall on it, tipped back on

two legs.  Tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the

door. From his expression he looks like he'll call the nearest

cop.

George rubs his head with his hand, to clear his mind.

He looks up at Clarence standing beside him.

Clarence is not getting far with George. He glances up, paces

across the room, thoughtfully.

As Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside

the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the

door to the shack. Clarence runs to close the door.

As Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favoring

his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what

Clarence has said.

George feels his ear as Clarence talks.

CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE

George indicates his bad ear.

George feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut

he received from Welch. He is now thoroughly confused.

George feels the clothes on the line.

They start dressing. George interrupts himself.

EXT. STREET  NIGHT

MEDIUM SHOT

This is the same empty street where George's car swerved

into the tree near the sidewalk. George and Clarence come

into shot and up to the spot where George had left his car

smashed against the tree. George looks around, but his car

is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged.

CLOSE SHOT  AT CURB

The owner of the house passes with some Christmas packages

under his arm.

The owner bends down to examine the trunk of the tree, then

straightens up and smells George's breath. He backs away.

The owner proceeds toward his house. George is completely

bewildered.

He puts his arm around Clarence, and they start off up the

road.

INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

It is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. The cheerful

Italian feeling is gone. It is now more of a hard-drinking

joint, a honky-tonk. Same bar, tables have no covers. People

are lower down and tougher. Nick the bartender is behind the

bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the

difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go up

to the bar.

Two people leave the bar as they approach.

As he says this, Nick leans over the counter and puts his

left fist nearly in Clarence's eye. Clarence is puzzled by

this conduct.

Nick turns away to get the drinks.

Nick is listening suspiciously to this conversation.

Nick stops pouring the drinks, bottle poised in his hand.

A cash register bell rings off stage. Clarence reacts to the

SOUND of the bell.

George glances up at Nick.

Nick slams the bottle down on the counter.

CLOSE SHOT

A small wreck of a man, with weak, watery eyes. Obviously a

broken-down panhandler, his hat in his hand.

CLOSEUP  GEORGE

He can hardly believe his eyes. It is Gower the druggist.

BACK TO SHOT  NICK AT THE BAR

Nick picks up a seltzer bottle, and squirts Gower in the

face with it. The crowd laugh brutally. Gower smiles weakly

as the soda runs off his face.

CLOSE SHOT

George, horrified, leaps up and goes over to Gower.

The bouncers throw Gower out the front door. George rushes

back to the bar.

EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in

the snow.

INT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

Nick at the cash register, busily ringing the bell.

EXT. NICK'S BAR  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

George and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a strange,

puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they

landed, looking at each other.

George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with

the neon sign over the door. It now reads "NICK'S PLACE"

instead of "MARTINI'S."

George and Clarence get to their feet.

He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence. Clarence sort

of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested

look.

George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his

arm.  It's flesh.

George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but

without success.

George feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out.

George is completely befuddled.

He starts off. Clarence rises.

George strides off hurriedly. Clarence slowly follows him,

glancing up toward Heaven as he goes.

EXT. STREET  NIGHT

MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE MOVES INTO THE SCENE

The sign bearing the name of the town reads: "Pottersville."

George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street

toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH

him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where

before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become

in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS

of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and

the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority

of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque

house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment,

and so on.

CLOSE SHOT

George stops before what used to be the offices of the

Building and Loan.  There is a garish electric sign over the

entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people

are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and

dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw

into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops:

MEDIUM CLOSEUP

George sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as

a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon.

The cop shoves George to one side. He looks around and sees

Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by.

EXT. STREET  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

Ernie stops the cab, and George enters it.

INT. CAB  NIGHT

MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND ERNIE

Ernie is puzzled by the stranger.

Ernie turns to driving, but he's worried about his passenger.

As he passes the burlesque house he sees Bert the cop standing

beside his police car. Attracting his attention, he motions

to Bert to follow him, indicating he has a nut in the back.

Bert gets into his car and follows.

EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The taxi pulls up to the curb and stops.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The cab is parked. George gets out and looks at the house.

EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT

MEDIUM SHOT

George is stopped momentarily by the appearance of the house.

Windows are broken, the porch sags, one section of the roof

has fallen, doors and shutters hang askew on their hinges.

Like a doomed man, George approaches the house.

EXT. CAB  NIGHT

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The police car has pulled up beside the cab, and Bert and

Ernie stand watching George's actions.

Ernie switches on the spotlight on his cab, and turns the

beam toward the old house.

INT. HALLWAY GEORGE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

The interior of the house is lit up here and there, ghostlike,

by Ernie's spotlight. No furniture, cobwebs, wallpaper hanging

and swinging  stairs are broken and collapsed. In a voice

that sounds like a cry for help, George yells out:

Clarence suddenly appears leaning against a wall.

INT. DOORWAY  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

Bert is standing in the entrance, with his gun in his hand.

Ernie is a few feet behind him, ready to run.

He rushes toward Bert.

Bert tries to lead George away by the arm, but George

struggles with him, trying to explain.

Bert raises his gun to hit George on the head. As he does

so, Clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in Bert's wrist,

forcing him to let George go.

George dashes out of the house and down the street, as Bert

grapples with Clarence, and they fall to the ground,

wrestling. We see Bert kneeling, trying to put handcuffs on

Clarence.

Suddenly Clarence disappears from under Bert's hands. Bert

gets up, amazed by his vanishing.

Ernie's hair is now standing on end with fright.

He runs out of the scene.

EXT. BAILEY HOME  NIGHT

MEDIUM SHOT

George runs up the path to the front door of the house and

raps on the door. He rings the bell and taps on the glass,

when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading:

"Ma Bailey's Boarding House."

MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE AT THE DOOR

The door opens and a woman appears. It is Mrs. Bailey, but

she has changed amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired. In

her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold

suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him.

It is a cruel blow to George.

She starts to close the door, but George stops her.

She slams the door shut in George's face.

EXT. HOUSE  NIGHT

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

George stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs out

to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen. His features

are distorted by the emotional chaos within him. We see

Clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb, holding his

volume of "Tom Sawyer" in his hand.

They walk out of scene.

EXT. CEMETERY  NIGHT

MEDIUM SHOT

George and Clarence approach the tree from which the "Bailey

Park" sign once hung. Now it is just outside a cemetery,

with graves where the houses used to be.

The two walk into the cemetery.

CLOSE MOVING SHOT

George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones,

Clarence trotting at his heels. Again George stops to stare

with frightened eyes at:

CLOSE SHOT  A TOMBSTONE

Upon it is engraved a name, Harry Bailey. Feverishly George

scrapes away the snow covering the rest of the inscription,

and we read: "IN MEMORY OF OUR BELOVED SON  HARRY BAILEY

1911-1919"

CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND CLARENCE

George jumps up.

CLOSEUP  GEORGE AND CLARENCE

George grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him.

George lets Clarence go, and runs off. Clarence falls to the

ground, where he rubs his neck.

EXT. LIBRARY  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it. We see

George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different

of life.  Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close

to body. She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self-

satisfied and efficient.

CLOSEUP

George, as he watches her.

CLOSE SHOT

George and Mary, on the sidewalk.

She looks up, surprised, but, not recognizing him, continues

on.

Mary starts to run away from him, and he follows, desperately.

He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a

tight grip on her. She struggles to free herself.

Mary breaks away from him, and dashes into the first door

she comes to, the Blue Moon Bar.

INT. BLUE MOON  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

Small tables, booths, perhaps a counter. It is crowded. Many

of the people are the same who were present during the run

on the Building and Loan. Mary comes running in, screaming.

The place goes into an uproar. George comes in, practically

insane. Some of the men grab and hold on to him.

Mary lets out a final scream, then faints into the arms of a

couple of women at the bar.

George can't fight through the men holding him. Desperately

he thinks of Clarence, and heads for the door.

EXT. SIDEWALK  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his

police car. He gets out and heads for the door, to run into

George as he comes out.

He grabs for George, who lets him have one square on the

button, knocking him down, then continues running down the

street yelling for Clarence. Bert gets up, takes out his gun

and fires several shots after the fleeing figure.

Bert gets into the police car, and, siren screaming, sets

off in pursuit of George.

EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER  NIGHT

MEDIUM SHOT

The same part of the bridge where George was standing before

Clarence jumped in. The wind is blowing as it has all through

this sequence. George comes running into shot. He is

frantically looking for Clarence.

CLOSEUP

George leaning on the bridge railing, praying.

George sobs. Suddenly, toward the end of the above, the wind

dies down. A soft, gentle snow begins to fall.

CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE SOBBING AT THE RAILING

The police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert

comes into scene.

George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again.

George talks hopefully  George touches Bert unbelievingly

George's mouth is bleeding again.

George touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth

with his hand, laughs happily. His rapture knows no bounds.

He practically embraces the astonished Bert, then runs at

top speed toward town.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

George's wrecked car is smashed against the tree. He comes

running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell,

pats the car, and dashes on.

EXT. MAIN STREET BEDFORD FALLS  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

George sees that the "POTTERSVILLE" sign is now replaced by

the original "YOU ARE NOW IN BEDFORD FALLS" sign.

He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street

of the town. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in

its original appearance. He passes some late shoppers on the

street

INT. GEORGE'S HOME  NIGHT

The lights are on. There is a fire in the fireplace. The

Christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked

around.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

Carter, the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and

photographer, and a sheriff, are waiting in the hall for

George. George comes dashing in the front door.

He grabs his hand and shakes it.

The photographer sets off a flash bulb.

George runs to the kitchen. He gets no answer. As he goes:

He comes running back to the hall.

INT. STAIRS  NIGHT

MEDIUM SHOT

The three children are at the top of the stairs. They are in

their pajamas.

George starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar

knob on the banister comes off in his hand. He kisses it

lovingly and puts it back, then continues up the stairs.

INT. TOP OF STAIRS  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

George and the kids. He is hugging them.

Zuzu comes running out of her bedroom. George crushes her to

Mary races up the stairs, where George meets her in a fierce

George and Mary embrace tearfully.

He stops her with a kiss. She leads him excitedly down the

stairs.

INT. LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

Mary leads George, who is carrying a couple of the kids on

his back, to a position in front of the Christmas tree.

She runs toward front door and flings it open. Ad lib SOUNDS

of an excited crowd can be heard. Uncle Billy, face flushed,

covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with

money, bursts in. He is followed by Ernie, and about twenty

more townspeople.

Uncle Billy Mary and the crowd come into the living room. A

table stands in front of George. George picks up Zuzu to

protect her from the mob. Uncle Billy dumps the basketful of

money out onto the table  the money overflows and falls all

over.

The rest of the crowd all greet George with greetings and

smiles.  Each one comes forward with money. In their pockets,

in shoe boxes, in coffee pots. Money pours onto the table

pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills  small money, but

lots of it. Mrs. Bailey and Mrs. Hatch push toward George.

More people come in. The place becomes a bedlam. Shouts of

"Gangway  gangway" as a new bunch comes in and pours out

its money. Mary stands next to George, watching him. George

stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu. As he

sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins.  Tears

course down his face. His lips frame their names as he greets

them.

Tom comes in, digging in his purse as he comes.

Charlie adds his money to the pile.

Ernie is trying to get some system into the chaos.

Mr. Martini comes in bearing a mixing bowl overflowing with

cash.

Martini dumps his money on the table.

Mr. Gower enters with a large glass jar jammed full of notes.

Violet Bick arrives, and takes out the money George had given

her for her trip to New York.

Annie, the colored maid, enters, digging money out of a long

black stocking.

Mr. Partridge, the high school principal, is the next donor.

Ernie is reading a telegram he has just received.

The crowd breaks into a cheer as Ernie drops the telegram on

top of the pile of money on the table.

As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and

glasses, Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord.

She starts playing "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," and the

entire crowd joins in the singing. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS

of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are

still coming in and dropping their money on the table. Carter,

the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly

looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces. In

the midst of this scene, Harry, in Naval uniform, enters,

accompanied by Bert, the cop.

Mrs. Bailey enters scene.

Ernie hands Harry a glass of wine.

Once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause. Janie

at the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing "Auld

Lang syne," and everyone joins in.

CLOSE SHOT

George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the

pile of money on the table. His eye catches something on top

of the pile, and he reaches down for it. It is Clarence's

copy of "Tom Sawyer." George opens it and finds an inscription

written in it: "Dear George, remember no man is a failure

who has friends. Thanks for the wings, Love Clarence."

At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of

the people on the other side of the tree, a little silver

bell on the Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery

tinkle. Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the

bell.

He looks up toward the ceiling and winks.

The voices of the people singing swell into a final crescendo

for the
