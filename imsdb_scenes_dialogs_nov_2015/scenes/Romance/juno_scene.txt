EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - DUSK

JUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript

subdivision, facing the curb. It's FALL. Juno is sixteen

years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces

and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object

of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned

curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking

leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless

latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger.

INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MOLD-O'-RIFFIC BASEMENT - NIGHT

FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow. He's

sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers

herself onto his lap.

A 60's Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player.

EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - CONTINUED

A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality.

We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away

from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again.

She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and

wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.

BEGIN ANIMATED TITLE SEQUENCE:

Juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a

jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of

juice. We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly

on a mission.

EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the

main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.

The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed

serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container

over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS

with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.

She enters the DRUGSTORE.

INT. DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS

ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from

behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest.

Rollo regards her with intense skepticism.

Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach.

An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and

lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle.

A pile of stolen COSMETICS falls out of the girl's jacket

and clatters to the floor.

Juno crosses and crosses her legs awkwardly, hopping. It's

obvious she has to use the bathroom urgently.

Rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down

one of the aisles.

INT. DRUGSTORE - BATHROOM - DAY

In the dim, reeking public bathroom, Juno hovers over the

commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles. She clumsily

tries to use the pregnancy test.

We see the test box sitting on the sink. It's a TeenWave

Discount Pregnancy Test. The accompanying outdated package

photo is of a shrugging 80s teen with a resigned expression.

The fine print on the box reads "From the makers of Sun-Glitz

Lightening Hair Spritz!"

INT. DRUGSTORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY

Juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the

open test box on the front counter. Rollo scans it and bags

it indifferently.

She places a giant licorice Super Rope on the counter.

She shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the

results. Shake. Shake. Nothing.

EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING

Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house,

gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super

Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to

fashion a noose.

Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of

prairie grass and wild flowers.

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Juno's BEDROOM is decorated with punk posters: The Damned,

The Germs, the Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc. She

picks up a hamburger-shaped phone to call her best friend,

LEAH.

INT. LEAH'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

LEAH's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that

certain girls love to hoard. The PHONE rings.

EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT

Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well

manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team.

Leah busts a gut laughing. It's a stunningly accurate

portrayal of Bleeker's parents.

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SPANISH CLASS - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

Bleeker and Juno are sitting at their desks, listening to a

teacher lecturing about spanish. Bleeker discreetly pushes a

POSTCARD to Juno with his foot. She picks it up off the floor,

reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher

obediently.

EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT

She hefts a coffee table with her bare hands. She's wearing

her father's LIFTING BELT.

INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

CU of Bleeker putting on double socks in his Car-Bed.

CU of Bleeker putting on his sweat bands.

CU of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide.

INT. KITCHEN - BLEEKER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

CU of a CROISSANT POCKET warming in the microwave.

EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING

PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for

early morning track practice. He wears a cross country uniform

that reads "DANCING ELK CONDORS." He is eating some kind of

microwaved snack gimmick.

Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting

for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the

front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe

officiously.

Stunned silence. Juno pops up the footrest of the recliner

and leans back comfortably.

The Dancing Elk Prep cross country team runs past Bleeker's

house in a thundering herd, wearing a motley assortment of

warm-ups. Their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves.

They wave and holler at Bleeker and Juno.

EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - CONTINUED

There's an awkward silence.

She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off.

EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - DAY

Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a

lock around it. In the background, a group of 3 NERDS play a

live-action RPG.

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

Juno tries to push through the masses, but the throng of

students is thick and unwielding.

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Juno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with

photos of Leah and Bleeker, plus a giant poster of Iggy Pop

in his heyday.

She grabs a dilapidated physics textbook. A few pages slip

out. STEVE RENDAZO (the same asshole who harassed her as she

walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway.

He high-fives his klatch of buddies and moves along.

We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with

mixed feelings.

We see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly

with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH.

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SCIENCE LAB - DAY

STUDENTS bustle in, as the teacher, MR. TINKER tries to

maintain order. Juno heads toward her desk and sets down her

bag.

Juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner:

Bleeker. Sound the gong of awkwardness!

Juno and Bleeker head separately over to an available lab

station and unpack their bags in silence.

He slides a piece of graph paper in front of Juno without

looking at her.

The other two LAB PARTNERS, a humorless couple, join them at

the station.

Juno and Bleeker observe the argument like tennis spectators,

fascinated by the dynamics of a real couple.

He furiously scrawls a fake memo in his notebook.

Bleeker reddens and continues constructing the apparatus.

GIRL LAB PARTNER stalks off dramatically.

Bleeker shakes his head and rifles through his textbook.

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper that depicts a

distraught TEEN GIRL clutching her head in a moment of staged

conflict. The ad reads: "Pregnant? Find the clinic that gives

women choice. Women's Choice Health Center."

Juno picks up her hamburger phone and dials. For a moment,

she attempts to copy the melodramatic pose from the ad,

checking herself out in the mirror.

She presses a few buttons in succession.

She SMACKS the phone a couple of times.

She hangs up the phone.

INT. HEALTH CLASS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A HEALTH TEACHER in slo-mo puts a condom on a banana.

INT. BLEEKER'S HOUSE - MOLD-O'-RIFIC BASEMENT - NIGHT

(FLASHBACK)

We see Paulie's face at the moment of his deflowering: he's

comically wide-eyed with shock.

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Juno, her father MAC, her stepmother BREN, and LIBERTY BELL

sit at a very typical kitchen table, eating dinner. MAC

shovels food while chatting about his day.

PHOTO: ARIZONA TRAILER PARK

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - DAY

PILE OF NEGLECTED CACTI festering in a corner of Juno's room.

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

BREN is cutting up LIBERTY'S food diligently. Her nails are

brilliant, holding the silverware.

INT. BREN'S WORKROOM - DAY

Bren stitches a needlepoint pillow of a dog.

EXT. BREN'S TENS - DAY

Bren's nail salon in all its glory.

INT. BREN'S TENS - DAY

Bren chats up a customer as she applies a fresh coat.

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Liberty Bell coughs pitifully as Bren leans over her plate.

Bren speaks in her strong city accent.

We see Liberty Bell blithely pouring bacon bits onto her

dinner.

EXT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - DAY

Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There

is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent

holding a hugely oversized sign that reads "NO BABIES LIKE

MURDERING."

Juno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers.

She continues on toward the clinic entrance.

She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door.

INT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - RECEPTION - DAY

The receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass.

The waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant

women, teens and ill-behaved children.

Juno flashes her best jazz hands.

The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some

paperwork on a clipboard.

The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen.

The receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women's

clinic CONDOM JARS, and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers.

She takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a

pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of

"mommy mags" and health related periodicals. She selects an

issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few

moments.

Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby

teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her

thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.

Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting

woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails.

Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist

clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on

her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their

fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...

There's no answer. We see that Juno's chair is EMPTY.

The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door

drift shut. Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she

tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.

EXT. LEAH'S HOUSE - DAY

Leah's front door swings open to reveal a breathless Juno

standing sheepishly on the porch. Leah sighs.

Leah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend.

EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

Juno and Leah are sitting at a bench in a park. They slurp

giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of Penny Savers.

Juno has her pipe with her.

They turn the pages in silence for a moment. Their lips and

teeth are Windex-blue.

She points to the paper and motions for Juno to look. Juno

scans the ad silently.

We see the ad. It contains a photo of an attractive couple

with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles. It reads "Educated,

successful couple wishes to..."

EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S WINDOW - NIGHT

We see Paulie's bedroom window -- festooned with childish

curtains -- and the light on inside.

INT. BLEEKER'S HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening

to the same LP from when he and Juno went all the way.

He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep

yearbook.

We see the object of his gaze is Juno's black and white

YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten

message from Juno. We hear Juno's voice reading the message:

Bleeker picks up the phone. It's the same HAMBURGER PHONE

Juno has. He reconsiders and puts it down.

There's a knock on the bedroom door.

BLEEKER'S MOM pokes her dowdy head inside.

Bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach.

Bleeker's mom gives up and closes the door.

We see that Bleeker is clutching a pair of PANTIES in one

hand, which he slowly releases as the 45 ends.

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Bren and MAC are seated on the couch. Leah is standing nearby

for reinforcements. Juno paces nervously, trying to suss out

how to break the massive news.

Bren and Mac are predictably speechless.

Leah presents the Penny Saver photos of the Lornings.

Juno cringes upon hearing her most-hated term.

Bren and Mac burst into shocked laughter.

Leah fires a be quiet glance at Juno.

Bren looks understandably alarmed. Juno hastily attempts to

make the situation sound more legitimate.

Leah and Juno exchange glances.

Mac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally.

Juno and Leah hightail it upstairs.

Mac shrugs in agreement.

INT. LORING HOUSE - DAY

Music plays as we see SPARSE IMAGES OF VANESSA LORING'S HANDS

preparing the house for Juno's arrival --

Sprucing a vase of FLOWERS.

Straightening a FRAMED PHOTO of the Lorings.

Dusting off a table with one of those WETNAPS for furniture.

Lining up a shelf of BOOKS.

EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - DAY

The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated

community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb.

EXT. LORING HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic

McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses

the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both

look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.

VANESSA opens the door. She's a pretty, meticulous woman in

her early thirties. Very Banana Republic.

INT. LORING HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home.

She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into

Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench.

MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He's a boyishly

attractive guy in his mid-thirties.

He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver

mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno.

INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Mark and Vanessa usher Juno and Mac into the austere, spacious

living room. A woman in a business suit sits on the couch

with a briefcase in her lap.

Mac seizes Mark's hand and pumps it heartily.

She bares them frighteningly to demonstrate.

Vanessa stares, unflappable.

Mac and Juno join Mark and Gerta Rauss on the couch.

Vanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray.

Vanessa's looks to the ceiling.

Mark and Juno lock eyes.

Vanessa is clearly ecstatic.

Juno and Mac stare at her.

Mark is caught off guard.

Mac casts a subtle, dubious glance at Mark.

INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY/STAIRS - DAY

Juno heads into the foyer and up the stairs. We see a posed

photo of Mark and Vanessa in the stairwell. Their house is

beautiful, but frigid. Juno rubs her arms, shivering.

INT. LORING HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

The Loring's bathroom is huge. Juno flushes and goes to the

double sink to wash her hands. She opens the overhead cabinet

and sees Vanessa's toiletries. She spritzes on some perfume

and examines the more expensive grooming items. There's a

crinkled tube of LUBE in the cabinet. Juno picks it up,

fascinated. She rubs a drop of it between her hands and runs

it through her hair like pomade.

INT. LORING HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Juno opens the bathroom door and instantly BUMPS into Mark.

She holds her WRIST up to Mark's twitching nostrils.

Mark inhales.

Juno mocks his use of "ASAP" silently.

Juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar. We

see GUITARS mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters.

INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S "SPECIAL" ROOM - DAY

The walls are plastered with FRAMED POSTERS of early-90s alt

rock bands. (Mudhoney, Jane's Addiction etc.) Mark removes

his LES PAUL from its moorings and hands it to Juno.

Juno turns the guitar over, examining it closely.

INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Vanessa, Mac and Gerta Rauss are waiting in awkward silence

for Juno and Mark to return. Mac notices a brand new PILATES

MACHINE sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room.

INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - SAME

Mark and Juno tool around on the guitars unplugged. They

play little riffs. He teaches her a couple chords.

INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

Vanessa and Gerta have no response.

Suddenly, a shriek of AMP FEEDBACK, followed by loud,

discordant GUITAR STRUMMING can be heard drifting down from

upstairs. Vanessa's looks to the ceiling.

INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY

Mark has strapped on the Les Paul and is playing and singing.

"Doll Parts" by Hole.

Building together.

VANESSA appears in the doorway. Juno immediately puts down

the guitar. Mark doesn't notice her immediately.

Mark clumsily puts down the guitar and stands up.

Mark hangs the guitars back on the wall. He and Juno exit

the room, chastised. Vanessa looks to Mark in question.

INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY

Juno and Mac have put their coats on and are in the process

of leaving. Gerta hands Juno the DOCUMENTS. Vanessa and Mark

trail behind.

Mac STARES at Juno gravely.

Juno looks at Mark.

Mark seems visibly embarrassed by Vanessa's manic demeanor.

Juno and Mac exit. Mark shuts the door. All is silent in the

foyer. Mark, Vanessa and Gerta stand motionless. Gerta pumps

her fist triumphantly, trying to create a mood of celebration.

Vanessa buries her head in her hands and weeps hoarsely.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING

It is now WINTER. The TRACK TEAM jogs in formation, leaving

tracks in the snow. Those bastards never stop running.

EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY

Bleeker is running alone on the track. His exhalations are

icy puffs in the air. Bleeker's friend VIJAY jogs up alongside

him. Vijay is a solemn, skinny boy, much like Bleeker.

VIJAY jogs off. Bleeker STOPS and wipes away his sweat.

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HEAD OFFICE - DAY

We're looking over Juno's now FIVE MONTH PREGNANT BELLY to a

school administrator filling out a slip.

Juno takes the slip, turns around and smiles all the way

out.

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

Juno exits the head office and bumps into Bleeker.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

SPLOOGE! We see ultrasound goo being squirted onto Juno's

exposed pregnant belly. An ULTRASOUND TECHNICIAN is using a

Doppler device to view the contents of her burgeoning bump.

Bren and Leah ooh and ahh at the resulting image.

The tech takes measurements and types them into her database.

The monitor reveals the baby's head.

Juno and Leah look at BREN, who is dabbing her eyes

discreetly.

Juno, Leah and Bren become immediately defensive.

Bren gestures to the ULTRASOUND MONITOR.

The ULTRASOUND TECH exits in a huff.

INT. JUNO'S BEDROOM - DAY

Juno lays in bed checking out the ULTRASOUND PRINT OUT.

EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - AFTERNOON

The Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa's

exclusive community. A sign on the gate reads "Glacial

Valley."

EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - AFTERNOON

Juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold.

MARK answers the door, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.

He gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly.

INT. LORING HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Mark leads Juno into the kitchen, where he pours two drinks.

The STEREO blares in the background.

She holds up a manila envelope.

INT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON

As they move into the living room, Juno sits down and motions

for Mark to join her on the couch.

Mark sits down. With great fanfare, Juno retrieves a dark,

glossy sheet from the envelope. It's her ULTRASOUND.

Mark EXAMINES the ultrasound, baffled.

Mark looks jolted, as if it's the first time he considered

that her baby might have a father. He stands up and holds

the photo up to the light critically.

Mark chuckles.

A new SONG has begun. Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and

walks toward the stereo. Juno follows him toward the source

of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is.

Mark grabs the STEREO REMOTE off the kitchen counter and

turns up the volume to a roar. Mark and Juno stand in silence

in the kitchen. Mark mouths along with the lyrics.

He gestures at Juno's burgeoning paunch.

Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling

CD's. He's got a Carpenter's disc, the "No Alternative"

charity compilation, and Mother Love Bone.

Juno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up.

Mark SWIVELS AROUND slowly on his desk chair, surprised.

Mark gives a look - "Oh, Really?"

INT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON

We see some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard

of Gore.

Mark and Juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer

floats. They're sitting dangerously close on the sofa.

He raises his mug in a toast and Juno clinks it awkwardly.

A door suddenly slams upstairs. Vanessa's home.

Juno jumps up and rushes out.

INT. LORING HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Vanessa slides her BRIEFCASE off her shoulder and ventures

into the living room. She's struggling to carry some oversized

shopping bags.

Juno intercepts her breathlessly, clutching the ULTRASOUND

photo. Mark trails behind her.

Vanessa JUMPS and makes a strangled sound.

Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios.

Her eyes are wide and she's uncharacteristically ruffled.

She holds the ULTRASOUND up to show Vanessa and drapes her

arm around her.

Vanessa drops the shopping bags, sick with relief.

She can't divert her gaze from the photo.

Vanessa chuckles tightly, clearly embarrassed by her show of

emotion.

INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - DAY

Vanessa and Mark walk Juno out. Juno peers at some shopping

bags from various kids stores.

Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. Vanessa looks

embarrassed.

She waves and heads for the door.

Vanessa looks pain-stricken as Mark helps Juno with her bag.

EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT

Juno kicks the snow off her shoes before she enters.

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Bren sits at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee and an

issue of Dog Fancy.

Juno enters nonchalantly, drinking a giant slushie.

A beat as Bren absorbs this.

Bren rises to leave, clutching the Dog Fancy magazine.

Bren STORMS out. Juno heads to the URN by the door and

defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it.

EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Juno parks her PREVIA on the street. She walks up to the

house and rings the doorbell.

BLEEKER'S MOM answers, visibly annoyed. Her eyes drift down

to Juno's middle.

She steals another glance at Juno's belly.

INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Bleeker's mom escorts Juno wordlessly up the stairs and down

the hallway to Paulie's bedroom. Juno discreetly tries to

charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her

from getting past Bleeker's mom. They share an extremely

awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway.

Bleecker's mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker's

bedroom door. The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration

hanging on it that says PAULIE'S VRROOOM! It looks like

something a 5-year old might have.

INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes, studying

like the tortured brainiac he is. Mrs. Bleeker opens the

bedroom door. Juno appears. Paulie jumps, startled.

Bleeker smiles faintly.

She closes the door halfway and leaves. Juno rolls her eyes

and pulls the door shut entirely.

He nervously cracks open a container of ORANGE TIC-TACS and

pours them into his mouth.

INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - "MOLD-O'-RIFFIC" BASEMENT - NIGHT

CU ON BLEEKER'S MOUTH AS HE KISSES JUNO FOR THE FIRST TIME

INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bleeker glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed.

Bleeker is visibly relieved.

Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker.

Juno is caught off guard by his sincerity.

The song playing ends, and another one begins. It's "the

song," the track that Bleeker and Juno both recognize from

the infamous night in the basement.

Bleeker picks at the carpet, dejected.

EXT. LORING HOUSE - DAY

The house is covered in fresh snow.

INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY

Mark and Vanessa stand silently in the nursery. The walls

are primed slate gray. A single ANTIQUE ROCKING CHAIR sits

in the corner. Vanessa beams proudly and holds two paint

samples up near the wall.

Mark shrugs, resigned.

Vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall.

Mark stares at the wall, looking lost.

INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - DAY

Juno and Leah are walking through the mall, looking bored.

Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of

actual maternity wear. Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel.

She wrestles Leah for the pretzel. Onlookers stare at them,

appalled, as Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson.

Leah claps a hand over Juno's mouth.

Juno drags Leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind

it. They're watching a group of well-heeled women and their

children shopping en masse. One of the women is pushing a

toddler in an ultramodern stroller. And one of the women is

VANESSA, looking vaguely detached.

Juno nods.

The women gather near a play area, sip Frapps and loudly

discuss their outfits for an upcoming party.

One of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa's sleeve.

Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play

area and begins to play energetically with her.

Juno watches intently, but Leah just snickers.

They watch Vanessa for a few more moments. The other kids

wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore

them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children.

Leah stands up. Juno lingers for a moment.

INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - ELEVATOR BANK - A HALF HOUR LATER

Leah and Juno approach the elevator.

The elevator door opens, revealing... Vanessa.

Juno tries her best to look enthused.

Juno glares at Leah.

She lifts her shirt and presses her popped-out NAVEL.

Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces.

Vanessa looks confused.

Vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the

courage for an unusual request.

She grabs Vanessa's hand and plants it on her stomach.

Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby.

She says this as though it's an admission of failure.

Vanessa kneels down next to the swell of Juno's belly.

Leah gives a look to Juno as if she's about to barf.

Vanessa looks like she's giving up hope. Then suddenly,

Juno smiles at Vanessa in awe of her genuine affection.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING

The streets are covered in muddy, slushy snow. The mud is

instantly TRAMPLED underfoot by the collective feet of the

Dancing Elk Track Team on their morning run.

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - BREN'S DESK - DAY

Bren cuts the top three inches off a pair of Juno's jeans.

Then, using a sewing machine, begins attaching an elastic

waistband.

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

We're behind that same WAISTBAND, as Juno walks through the

students. Now, people seem to part the waters for the belly.

INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S "SPECIAL ROOM" - DAY

Mark has the Les Paul on his lap as he stares at the boards

of an awful commercial.

CU - THE SCRIPT (storyboards). A kitchen scene with a kid

eating a new breakfast product called -- BRUNCH BOWLZ.

Annoyed and out of ideas, Mark begins an impromptu song...

Mark drops his head, dejected. Then, the phone rings.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Mark instantly smiles.

Mark hangs up. Smiles.

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

CU on Juno's tray sliding along, picking up an odd combo of

pregnant food.

Pull up to find Juno and Leah walking their trays to a table.

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

Juno and Leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on

the wall, eating their lunch.

Juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help

but glance her way. Some look derisive, others are amused.

She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach.

We see KEITH the teacher talking to some science kids in the

background. He has a Wild America beard. He lifts a cup of

coffee to his lips and slurps lustily.

BACK ON JUNO AND LEAH:

INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - BLEEKER'S LOCKER - DAY

Bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker. Juno marches

up to him, belly leading the way.

Juno is clearly AFFRONTED.

A GIRL strides past (obviously KATRINA) with a sour look

aimed squarely at Juno.

She starts to walk away.

Bleeker takes a deep breath.

Bleeker BRACES himself and pushes up his lab goggles.

Juno picks up her BACKPACK dejectedly and slides it over her

shoulder. She's about to walk away, when...

She turns around, wipes TEARS off her cheek (making sure no

one sees) and continues down the hallway.

EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - PREVIA - DAY

Juno climbs ungracefully into the van. She starts the engine,

then pauses to dig through her backpack for something. She

produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview

mirror, examining herself self-consciously. She puts on some

Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway.

INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY

Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie

website. He has the blank expression of a bored obsessive.

The doorbell rings.

INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY

Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly

knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a

grin.

He and Juno smile conspiratorially.

He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.

INT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and

unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain

to illuminate a bare bulb.

Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.

He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki."

It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking

names.

Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble

her.

She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!

Juno is sincerely pleased.

There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno

kneels down and pops in one of the discs.

Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.

Mark Laughs.

She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves

back and forth stiffly.

Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She

drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.

They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against

Mark.

They laugh.

Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence

for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close

as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.

Juno backs away.

She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters

to her far more than the approval of an older guy.

Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.

He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.

Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at

Mark.

She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.

INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the

front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning

home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased

NURSING PILLOW. They nearly collide.

It's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's

lying. Vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries

her hardest to seem serene and "together" in front of Juno.

She rushes toward the door.

Juno halts.

Juno looks totally betrayed. She doesn't respond. Vanessa

looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying.

She knows exactly to what he's referring.

Juno's face continues to fall. Vanessa notices.

Juno ain't buying it.

This stops Vanessa. Juno looks offended.

A long hideous beat.

Another hideous beat.

Vanessa sighs. It's done.

Vanessa looks defeated.

We hear the front door closing. Vanessa and Mark look over

and notice that Juno has escaped the conflict.

EXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys,

but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.

EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the

shoulder.

INT. PREVIA - AFTERNOON

Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for

the first time since she became pregnant.

After a beat, she begins to gather herself.

INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar.

He's playing a theme that we will soon recognise.

EXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT

Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future.

We push in close... when she gets an idea.

She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she

finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and

pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?

EXT. LORING HOUSE - NIGHT

It's quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting

alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of

wine.

INT. LORING HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events

sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join

her.

Mark nods and sits down.

They STARE at the wall, speechless and defeated.

She buries her head in her hands.

There's a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.

EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT

Mark opens the door. There's a folded piece of paper sitting

on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the

van.

Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute

because of Juno's proficiency in "teen girl origami." He

holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back.

Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over,

examining it.

EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT

Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light's

been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.

She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch

and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly

with it. Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family

finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes.

Juno enters.

Juno nods in agreement.

A wave of REALIZATION crosses Juno's face.

He nods toward her belly.

Juno laughs and hugs her father, planting a smooch on his

cheek.

She salutes and dashes out of the kitchen.

MONTAGE:

INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - BLEEKER'S ROOM - NIGHT

We push in over Bleeker sleeping in his car-bed towards the

window. We look out onto the lawn to find Juno and Leah

running back to the Previa, hopping in, and screeching off.

EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING

Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning

run. He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the

stoop: "BLEEKER -- CHECK THE MAIL."

He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch

on the mailbox.

At least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come

pouring out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the

driveway. Bleeker smiles.

EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - MORNING

Juno waddles toward the field. The guys on the track team,

ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches.

They stare at her quizzically. Bleeker spots Juno approaching

and jogs up to the chainlink fence.

Juno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly.

Bleeker and Juno KISS, oblivious to the gawking track team

guys in the background.

In the distance, near the school entrance, we see STEVE

RENDAZO (the kid who always TORMENTS Juno) regarding the

makeout session with a sad, envious expression.

LEAH passes by, does a double take, then hurries up to the

fence, rolling her eyes.

Juno gives her the FINGER, not breaking the clinch with

Bleeker.

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Juno is lying on her back on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

She's more pregnant than we've ever seen her. She revs a

Matchbox car against the slope of her belly and lets it roll.

Juno suddenly sits up, looking thoroughly freaked. She pats

her lap frantically and jumps off the bed.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - MAC'S WORK DESK - SAME

Mac looks up from the lure he's working on.

EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY

Mac, Bren and Liberty Bell rush out of the house. They pile

into the Previa at breakneck speed. Juno waddles behind them,

protesting.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

CU of Juno wearing a puffy surgical cap. She's being pushed

down the hospital corridor in a wheelchair. She bursts into

giggles. Pull back to reveal her that Leah is pushing her

rather aggressively. Leah jokingly steers the wheelchair

into a wall. Juno feigns whiplash.

Bren appears behind them and orders Juno out of the

wheelchair, exasperated. She pulls off Juno's surgical cap.

Leah and Juno snicker.

INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY

We see Juno is in a BIRTHING SUITE at the hospital, pacing

impatiently, bent over in obvious discomfort. She's wearing

her Chuck Taylors and knee socks with her hospital gown.

Leah and Bren stand nearby.

Juno doubles over in pain.

Juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain.

INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - LATER

We see Juno in the process of delivery, from her POV. Leah

holds one of Juno's feet and Bren holds the other.

We see Leah holding Juno's FOOT, which is shaking. Leah's

shirt is soaked. She rolls her eyes and mouths "Fuck you" at

Juno. Juno's raised MIDDLE FINGER enters the frame.

The doctor reveals JUNO'S BABY BOY above the sheet.

Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to

flutter... and she passes out.

EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - AFTERNOON

Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him

on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the

bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate

Vijay looks on. Bleeker's mom is seated near Vijay, holding

a video camera.

Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. The fifteen or so

people in attendance cheer.

Bleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat.

Bleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno.

She's not there.

Bleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without

stopping to explain. His mother stands up, confused.

INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - DAY

A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and

gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby.

The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator.

Pull back to reveal she's speaking to VANESSA, who stands,

paralyzed, several feet away.

Vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in

her eyes. She spends a few moments just looking at him.

She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren

leaning against the doorway.

Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously.

Vanessa laughs.

INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY

Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth

is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and

accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared

out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's

not sure what to say.

He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game,

but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His

expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained.

Juno nods and swallows.

Over Mac's shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway.

It's Bleeker in his track uniform.

Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. Mac glances

at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac clears his

throat, gets up and leaves the room.

Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his

arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for

the first time in months.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BIRTHING SUITE - EVENING

Juno lies on the bed. She looks rested and relaxed compared

to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and

swollen. Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track

uniform and spikes.

INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING

We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her

eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently.

INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY

The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa's immaculate

taste. Nothing looks as though it's been touched. We see the

antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty.

We pan past the wall Vanessa had said "needed something."

There's a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was

handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it

says: "Vanessa -- If you're still in, I'm still in. Juno."

We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We

see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her

shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa

looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There

are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed

close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the

baby for a single moment.

The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb. Vanessa glows

with an expression of pure bliss.

EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY

It's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle

out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who

is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost

as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY

Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar

is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not

pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.

As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she

passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in

outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.

Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning

his guitar.

EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAY

Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles

and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and

pulls the pick out of the strings.

Bleeker nods.

Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "Anyone Else

But You," by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first

their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.

She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile

ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.

Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with

life and summer activity.
