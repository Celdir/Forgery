In baseball, you don't know nothing.

Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better

learn baseball.

You could look it up.

Titles over --

FADE IN:

A series of still photos. Black and white. Ancient.

BABE RUTH SWINGS -- An icon of American history. His giant

upper body balanced delicately on tiny ankles and feet. The

huge bat in an elegant follow-through...

TY COBB ROUNDS THIRD -- The most vicious ballplayer of them

all, a balletic whirling dervish.

JACKIE ROBINSON STEALS ROME -- Yogi Berra applies the tag.

Too late.

JOE DIMAGGIO WITH HIS SON in the Yankee clubhouse. Walking

down the runway, Joe in uniform. Number five.

PULLBACK REVEALS:

A WALL COVERED WITH BASEBALL PICTURES behind a small table

covered with objects and lit candles. A baseball, an old

baseball card, a broken bat, a rosin bag, a jar of pine tar --

also a peacock feather, a silk shawl, a picture of Isadora

Duncan. Clearly, the arrangement is -- A SHRINE -- And it

glows with the candles like some religious altar.

We hear a woman's voice in a North Carolina accent.

PAN AWAY FROM THE SHRINE across the room. Late afternoon

light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a

small dressing table. A WOMAN applies make up.

ANNIE SAVOY, mid 30's, touches up her face. Very pretty,

knowing, outwardly confident. Words flow from her Southern

lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern,

National and International borders. She's cosmic.

ANNIE OPENS A CLOSET DOOR -- Dozens of shoes hang from the

door. She chooses a pair of RED HIGH HEELS, with thin straps.

She sits on a bench and

ANNIE SLIPS ON THE RED HIGH HEELS -- Smoothing her hands up

her calves as she does.

SHE HOLDS OUR HER LEGS DISPLAYING THE HEELS, side by side.

Like a little girl showing off her new shoes.

ANNIE STARTS PACKING A HUGE HANDBAG -- With fruit, an official

scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick.

ANNIE TOUCHES PERFUME BEHIND HER EARS and, ever so slightly,

in her cleavage.

ANNIE POSES IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR -- She smoothes her dress

along her hips. And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses.

Stylish and slightly mad.

ANNIE STARTS FOR THE DOOR and grabs her baseball glove

EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DUSK

A frame house with porch and lots of trees -- a Thomas Wolfe

house... with a 1959 faded red Volvo in the driveway.

ANNIE LEAVES ON FOOT, turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic,

old Durham, North Carolina neighborhood. In the b.g. other

people are heading the same direction ANNIE PULLS A DURHAM

BULLS BASEBALL CAP from her handbag and pulls it on her head.

EXT. THE CHURCH -- DURHAM BASEBALL PARK -- DUSK

Now visible In the late afternoon sun, a rickety old stadium

carved into the center of an old Tobacco town.

People are arriving on foot from all around...

"Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley fills the air.

CLOSE ON A BASEBALL CLOWN -- MAX PATKIN, 60, at home plate

doing his famous Bill Haley routine. A comic pitcher's windup

full of twists and goofy choreography.

ANNIE SITS DOWN IN HER PRIVATE BOX SEAT -- Her chair is wiped

off by a young black boy, JACKSON, 11, who then sits next to

her. He is her employed errand runner, note sender, and

friend.

A GROUP OF GROUPIES ENTERS THE PARK -- 20 year old girl/women,

dressed in tight pants, tight everything.

Friendly, eager, innocent -- THEY WAVE TO ANNIE.

FIVE PLAYERS' WIVES AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN sit in a special

box seat behind a small sign "Players' Wives".

EXT/INT. THE DURHAM BULL DUGOUT -- NIGHT

As Max Patkin continues his routine, players warm up, and --

THE MANAGER, JOE RIGGINS, 45, known merely as SKIP, short

for "Skipper", a chaw of tobacco in his cheek, stands with

his pitching coach, LARRY HOCKETT late 30's, an ex-big leaguer

whose body has seen too many cocktail lounges.

LARRY ROLLS SOME RED MAN CHEWING TOBACCO into a slab of pink

bubble gum, carefully folding the corners, tucking it neatly

together. Larry examines it as they talk -- And shoves the

giant chaw into his mouth.

A PLAYER, DEKE, 25, stuffs a hot dog into his mouth.

SKIP WHIRLS AND HEADS UP THE TUNNEL into the:

INT. THE DURHAM CLUBHOUSE -- NIGHT

SKIP enters, shouting --

CLOSE ON A BARE ASS -- Baseball uniform around the ankles,

short t-shirt on top, and on top of that the head of EBBY

CALVIN LALOOSH, baseball cap on backwards. EBBY is a great

looking energetic man-child with the endless confidence,

naivete and horniness of youth.

Life is a party.

A YOUNG WOMAN, MILLIE, 20, half nude, is dressing quickly.

EBBY WHIRLS as Skip enters.

MILLIE LOOKS OUT FROM BEHIND A BAT RACK -- Outraged.

As Skip starts to leave.

Skip stares at him. He can't believe this guy.

SKIP WHIRLS AND HEADS BACK OUT TO THE FIELD -- And Ebby

unperturbed, turns his attention back to Millie.

EXT. THE BALLPARK -- MOMENTS LATER -- NIGHT

MAX PATKIN STILL FLAILING AWAY to "Rock Around the Clock".

ANNIE LOOKS THROUGH HER BINOCULARS -- Studying the players

warming up casually on the sidelines as Patkin winds up his

act.

hands with a the BULL MASCOT LEADING THE APPLAUSE.

INT. THE DUGOUT

CLOSE ON ANOTHER PLAYER -- MICKEY MCFEE, 23, black. Smoking

a cigarette -- always smoking a cigarette. He snuffs out his

cigarette and RUNS onto the field with the rest of the team,

as --

EBBY ENTERS THE DUGOUT from the runway. Larry and Skip

encourage their players running onto the field. Ebby is trying

to get the zipper on his fly unstuck. He smiles broadly at

Skip and Larry, and grabs his glove.

INT. THE PRESS BOX

THE RADIO ANNOUNCER, TEDDY CULLINANE, 50, leans into the

radio mike of a very small local station. Next to him is the

local SPORTSWRITER, WHITEY SHERRARD, 40. Between them they've

seen a million minor league players come and go.

EXT. THE BALLFIELD -- NIGHT

ANGLE TO ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- Millie has joined Annie and

Jackson. Clearly, the younger women look up to Annie for

wisdom and insight.

JACKSON AIMS A RADAR GUN at the plate.

THE PENINSULA WHITE SOX LEADOFF HITTER steps in.

EBBY CALVIN LALOOSH WINDS UP and fires. The pitch sails over

the batter's head, over the catcher's head, over the backstop,

and CRASHES INTO THE PRESS BOX.

INT.  THE PRESS BOX

THE ANNOUNCER AND SPORTSWRITER CRASH to the floor as the

ball smashes into their booth.

THE CATCHER TALKS TO EBBY, trying to calm him down.

THE CATCHER RETURNS to the plate.

INT. THE PRESS BOX

WHITEY AND TEDDY WARILY CLIMB back to their seats.

EBBY'S NEXT PITCH HITS FOSTER in the ribs. He crumples.

ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- She's writing a note. She hands it to

Jackson.

JACKSON RUNS OFF with the note. Annie turns to Millie.

P.O.V. EBBY LALOOSH FIRES ANOTHER ONE INTO THE STANDS. AND --

Hit "Rock Around the Clock" --

QUICK MONTAGE OF EBBY'S FIRST GAME -- Strikeouts and wild

pitches. A young, gifted, uncontrollable thrower.

EBBY UNLEASHES A WILD ONE -- And decks the Bull Mascot.

EBBY IN THE DUGOUT READS THE NOTE from Annie.

EBBY STRIKES OUT a Peninsula batter.

EBBY UNLEASHES ANOTHER WILD ONE and a batter hits the dirt.

End "Rock Around the Clock" and --

INT. THE BULL LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

SKIP WALKS THROUGH THE PLAYERS ROOM -- Players are up, joking

irreverently.

A DURHAM PLAYER SITTING HALF DRESSED in front of his locker.

A PICTURE OF JESUS hangs amidst his gear. The player, JIMMY,

25, has a Bible and prays softly to himself.

DEKE WALKS BY, shaking Jimmy irreverently as he prays.

MICKEY (A BLACK) COMPLAINS TO TONY as they undress.

THE MANAGER'S OFFICE -- A tiny cubicle, a desk, phone Larry

joins him with the pitching charts. Skip studies the charts.

THE DOOR OPENS -- A PLAYER ENTERS, in street clothes, carrying

his suitcases. CRASH DAVIS, 30, older than the other players.

And different. More than just opinions, he actually has a

point of view. A career minor leaguer, hanging on wherever

he can get a job. Unlike Ebby -- Crash knows a lot about the

world without baseball. Also unlike Ebby -- he loves baseball

desperately.

Crash speaks slowly, with a trace of cynicism and pride,

like an old warrior who knows he's just a hired gun.

Beat. Skip looks out, half dressed, from his cubicle.

CRASH RISES TO LEAVE -- Picks up his luggage, and turns to

Skip and Larry before exiting. A deep breath

Beat. They know, they share the inability to quit the game.

They're all clinging to the Church of Baseball.

CRASH LEAVES and as he does -- Ed (the catcher) enters.

He does. Remains standing. He can see it coming.

CLOSE ON ED -- Silent. Motionless. Empty.

INT. THE LOCKER ROOM --

CRASH PUTS HIS BAG IN A LOCKER as other players return from

the shower. Crash watches as EBBY SOAKS HIS ELBOW IN A TUB

OF ICE WATER as the sports writer, Whitey, interviews him.

INT. MAXWELL'S BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Loud country music in the players' hangout and pickup spot.

It's full of players and lots of young women.

MILLIE SITS DOWN NEXT TO YET ANOTHER PLAYER, TONY, 25 --

He's slick, urban, smooth.

ANNIE SITS IN THE CORNER at her own table. Max Patkin, looking

spiffy in a turtle neck sweater and double breasted blazer,

sits down next to her. Old friends.

A COCKTAIL WAITRESS DELIVERS another round to them.

waves, and smiles easily.

ANNIE NODS AT CRASH -- He comes over to her table, greets

Max as an old friend, and introduces himself.

SUDDENLY -- HARD CORE ROCK AND ROLL on the juke box. Several

couples dance, and out of the pack --

EBBY DANCES WITH A GROUPIE -- Spinning and whirling,

uninhibited and infectious. He's suddenly dancing with a

different WOMAN, then another, and another...

ANNIE, CRASH AND MAX WATCH the mad performance.

EBBY PUTS ON A ONE MAN SHOW ON THE DANCE FLOOR -- The whole

bar stops to watch him, applauding as he spins to a finish.

A quirkier "Saturday Night Fever" show. More naive, fun. He

climbs off the floor and joins Annie's table.

He extends his hand to introduce himself.

The two men square off quickly. Annie mocks them.

CRASH RISES, pulling Annie with him. But --

EBBY STANDS to challenge Crash.

But Crash and Ebby head outside. She turns to Max --

EXT. THE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

A circle is formed. Everybody gathers. Millie clings to Tony,

her guy of the moment. Crash and Ebby face off.

CRASH PULLS A BASEBALL from his jacket pocket, tosses it to

Ebby.

EBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away,

right at Crash's chest. But, alas --

THE BALL GOES THROUGH A SECOND STORY WINDOW in the distance.

Crash never blinks.

EBBY IS ENRAGED -- HE CHARGES CRASH, lunging at him.

CRASH LASHES OUT A SHORT LEFT -- With lightning speed,

effortless. And brutal. BANG! Ebby goes down. And stays there

stunned. He looks up.

INT. THE CLUB -- NIGHT

ANNIE AND MAX DANCE to Billy Eckstein on the juke box. Millie

and Tony are also on the dance floor.

EBBY AND CRASH WATCH FROM THE CORNER TABLE -- Ebby's right

eye is blackened. He holds a drink on it.

ANNIE SUDDENLY APPEARS at the table.

CLOSE ON EBBY -- His eyes full of fear and wonder.

CLOSE ON CRASH -- He smiles.

THE THREE OF THEM LEAVE the bar together.

INT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

THE SHRINE OF BASEBALL GLOWS -- Annie lights the candles.

EBBY AND CRASH SIT ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF HER COUCH -- Both men

look around the room with wonder. Ebby is clearly more nervous

than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor

league career.

Crash rises to leave, and heads for the door.

Crash at the door. Annie's question is slightly taunting.

He stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion:

Crash heads out into the night. Annie hurries to the-door

while Ebby sits on the couch, bewildered.

ANNIE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY -- Crash is on the porch.

Ebby appears in the door.

Crash walks out into the Durham night. Ebby and Annie stand

in the doorway. She speaks softly to Ebby.

INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

ANNIE PUTS ON A RECORD -- Edith Piaf sings "Le Trois Cloches".

EBBY STARTS UNDRESSING across the room.

She sits in a chair. Piaf sings. Ebby practically rips his

shirt off, exposing a great upper body.

Piaf sings. Annie listens. Ebby re-buttons, then unbuttons

his shirt. It drops, revealing his back.

Ebby drops his pants.

Ebby considers this. Pulls his pants back up. Takes his socks

off. Then his pants.

EXT. DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT

Deserted streets of the old tobacco town. Crash walks alone.

He picks up an old newspaper out of a trash can. He stops in

front of  a store window. He rolls the newspaper like a short

bat. He takes a batting stance, and --

CRASH TAKES HIS BATTING STANCE in front of the window,

studying his reflection. He taken a "swing". And another.

A GROUP OF OLD BLACK MEN stand in a doorway, watching.

INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -'CONTINUOUS NIGHT

CLICK -- A handcuff is locked onto Ebby's wrist. Both his

arms are outstretched -- he's getting very excited.

Annie calmly drags a chair over and sits down.

Annie opens a book and begins reading as Piaf sings softly.

SAME SCENE -- LATER

CLOSE ON EBBY'S FACE -- Intrigued, aroused, frightened.

EXT. DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT

THE OLD BLACK MAN is tossing wadded up balls of paper at

Crash who takes beautiful, fluid swings with the rolled up

newspaper. Batting practice.

CLOSE ON CRASH'S EYES -- Studying the "pitches" with intense

concentration, endlessly working on his game.

EXT. THE DURHAM FIELD -- NEXT DAY

LARRY, DEKE, MICKEY AND BOBBY ARE SINGING at home plate as a

pre-game show. Larry is Diana Ross, the other three are the

Supremes, and the routine is brilliantly tacky.

INT. DURHAM BULLS LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

JIMMY STANDS ON A BENCH trying to get the players' attention.

BOBBY, 25, smooths the creases of his uniform, preening.

All heads turn as:

EBBY ENTERS THE LOCKER ROOM -- He looks trashed.

Lots of teasing from around the clubhouse.

EBBY GOES TO HIS LOCKER and starts undressing. Crash sits

next to him, looking straight ahead. Bobby nearby.

Crash studies Ebby.

CRASH RISES AND HEADS OUT to the field. Ebby sits silently,

holding his shower shoes, taking it all in.

EXT. DURHAM BALLPARK -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- DAY

IN THE DUGOUT -- THE GAME FROM A DUGOUT P.O.V. The players

sit, stand, stir restlessly. A combination of relaxation and

intensity not visible from the stands.

CRASH IS HANDED HIS BAT and helmet by the bat boy.

DUGOUT P.O.V. THE WINSTON-SALEM PITCHER throwing hard.

FOLLOW CRASH INTO THE ON-DECK CIRCLE -- The ritual. The bat

boy hands him the pine tar rag and he rubs pine tar on the

bat with great care.

CRASH RISES -- Heads to the plate. Talking to himself.

CRASH TAKES HIS STANCE -- Upright. Calm. Head still.

CLOSE ON CRASH'S FACE -- His eyes intensely focused.

CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER -- Starts his windup.

THE PITCHER DELIVERS -- Crash strides. Curveball.

Crash swings and misses, offstride. Strike one.

CRASH QUICKLY STEPS OUT OF THE BOX and picks up dirt. Rubs

it on his hands. He's pissed.

P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT DELIVERY -- CURVE BALL AWAY.

CRASH STRIDES INTO THE PITCH -- Lashes a line drive down the

first base line. Just foul.

Crash has started to first. Pulls up. Returns slowly to the

plate. Picks up his bat.

at Crash's head. The ball seems to accelerate. About to

explode his skull. For a moment -- THE FEAR OF DEATH...

CRASH HITS THE DIRT -- It just misses his head.

CRASH CLIMBS OUT OF THE DIRT -- Brushes himself off.

CRASH HOLDS UP HIS HAND to the ump.

CRASH STEPS OUT OF THE BOX -- Motions to the bat boy for the

pine tar rag. The boy brings it over. Crash re-applies it to

his bat.

CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE BOX -- Talking to himself.

CRASH IN THE BATTER'S BOX -- Digs in-again. Takes his stance.

Upright. Relaxed. Ready.

ANNIE AND JACKSON IN THE STANDS -- She's writing a note

quickly, and hands it to Jackson, who hurries off.

CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT PITCH -- A major league

fastball. It explodes to the plate. Crash swings. And misses.

Strike Three.

CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE DUGOUT -- Head high, no show of

emotion. Almost proud. An old Warrior, not giving an inch

even in defeat.

HE RE-ENTERS THE DUGOUT -- Sits down and starts putting the

catcher's gear back on. Deke leans over.

THE BATBOY TAKES THE NOTE FROM JACKSON -- And hands it to

Crash, who refuses to accept it, being busy putting his gear

on.

Crash doesn't seem too amused. He grabs the note, and the

pen hanging from the starting lineup card taped to the dugout

wall. He scrawls a quick note.

ANNIE'S PRIVATE BOX -- She's watching the players through

binoculars as Jackson returns with the note.

Jackson looks at the note uneasily, then reads --

ANNIE PUTS DOWN THE GLASSES -- Takes the note.

EXT. A LOCAL BATTING CAGE DAY

ANNIE DIGS IN AT THE PLATE -- Bat in hand. Crash a few feet

away. Annie spits on her hands, wear batting glove, pumps

the bat back and forth.

ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES the next pitch.

ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another pitch.

ANNIE FOULS ONE OFF and digs in gamely.

ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another one.

CRASH STEPS IN TO HIT -- He takes his familiar stance. The

pitch comes. Crash drills it.

The pitching machine arm flaps. Empty. Silence.

Crash puts the bat down, heads out the gate. She follows.

A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM ARRIVES -- Twenty-five 10 year olds in

uniform with a couple PARENT COACHES.

CRASH STOPS TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS amidst 25 Little Leaguers.

SUDDENLY A VOICE -- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche.

And suddenly Nuke is swept up into a sea of Little Leaguers.

Crash smiles as he turns Annie and the kids over to Nuke.

Crash leaves Annie with Nuke and 25 Little Leaguers.

EXT. CRASH GETS INTO HIS CAR -- CONTINUOUS

AN AGING SHELBY MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- The paint's fading, a

couple dings in the body, but loaded under the hood.

CRASH PUNCHES HIS TAPE DECK -- Sam Cooke's "You Send Me".

ANNIE BITES HER FIST watching Crash leave.

INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

The sounds of lovemaking in a darkened room lit only by a

few candles.

Several beats of silence.

He flips on a lamp near the bed.

Nuke considers this fabulous logic.

Nuke sighs; and lets his head sink in the pillow.

Nuke rests his head on Annie's shoulder. His eyes are wide

open and full of nervous energy.

EXT. DURHAM BASEBALL PARK -- DUSK

NUKE ON A PAY PHONE -- In his uniform. Players warming up in

the background as the ground crew prepares the field.

EXT. HOME PLATE -- THE BALLPARK NIGHT

THE MAYOR OF DURHAM AND THE CITY COUNCIL stand at a mike in

front of home plate. 300 LITTLE LEAGUERS in uniform are lined

up along the foul line, restrained by a rope.

THE MAYOR STEPS to the mike.  A classic Southern mayor.

As the honorable Mutt Clark drones on -- we INTERCUT:

EXT. THE BULLPEN -- CONTINUOUS

NUKE IS WARMING UP TO PITCH -- Crash and Larry watch him

closely, giving advice. As Nuke delivers --.

A MANGY DOG EATS FROM A DISH provided by the players. A couple

kids sit with the players.

MILLIE SITS DOWN NEXT TO A PLAYER -- BOBBY, 25.

JOSE FASHIONS A SMALL CROSS OUT OF CHICKEN BONES and rubs it

on his bat. Bobby notices this.

BOBBY HOLDS OUT HIS BAT for Jose to rub with the cross.

ALL HEADS TURN, A HELICOPTER APPEARS ABOVE THE FIELD

BACK TO THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL -- Hair and hats blowing

from the chopper turbulence.

THE HELICOPTER DUMPS HUNDREDS OF DOLLAR BILLS above the field.

The night sky fills with fluttering money THE ROPE IS DROPPED --

THREE HUNDRED LITTLE LEAGUERS charge across the infield to

the falling money, scooping it up wildly, brawling, shoving,

clawing for the cash.

As the money flutters down...

EXT. DURHAM BASEBALL STADIUM -- SHORT TIME LATER

CLOSE ON THE ROSIN BAG on the mound. A hand picks it up.

Puffs of rosin "smoke". Nuke is on the mound.

NUKE NERVOUSLY WALKS AROUND THE MOUND -- Just before the

first batter. He picks up the rosin bag. Digs a slot for his

lead foot to land. And CRASH APPROACHES, in full gear, mask

tipped up on his head.

CRASH TURNS AND HEADS TO THE PLATE and we hear the beginning

of Nuke's interior monologue.

CRASH TURNS AROUND HALF WAY TO THE PLATE and returns to the

mound, as if he knows everything Nuke's thinking.

CRASH SMILES -- And trots back to the plate.

NUKE'S P.O.V. The first batter steps in. Crash gives the

sign for the pitch.

NUKE SHAKES OFF THE PITCH -- Here comes Crash back out to

the mound before Nuke's thrown a pitch.

CRASH RETURNS ONE MORE TIME to behind the plate.

CRASH CROSSES THE PLATE, past the hitter. He speaks to the

opposing leadoff batter.

NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS -- A fastball.

THE LEADOFF HITTER TEES OFF on the pitch and sends a line

shot over the right field fence.

CLOSE ON BILLBOARD -- "Hit Cow, Win Steak" sign, The home

run hits the cow on a target painted on the cow's rump.

The COW'S MOUTH OPENS AND MOOS.

THE BATTER STANDS AND WATCHES the home run, admiring the

shot, enjoying the moment. CRASH GETS IN HIS FACE instantly --

and gets very tough.

THE BATTER TAKES OFF ON A HOME RUN TROT -- Slightly scared.

AND CRASH HEADS TO THE MOUND where Nuke watches the Mooing

Cow and the circling batter with dismay. Crash smiles.

CRASH SMILES -- Drops the mask, returns behind the plate.

NUKE SIGHS -- Takes a deep breath.

NUKE'S WINDUP AND DELIVERY -- A fastball. A powerful, clean,

overwhelming fastball. Strike one.

NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS HIS NEXT PITCH -- A monster. An

THE SHOWERS -- Naked bodies in the steamy room. No joking

around. A team on losing streak.

SUDDENLY SKIP STEPS INTO THE SHOWER in his uniform and angrily

throws an armload of bats into the shower.

THE SHOWER EMPTIES in seconds. Players grab a seat, and:

WHITEY THE SPORTSWRITER ENTERS as he does every night.

SKIP PICKS UP A CHAIR AND FIRES IT AT WHITEY -- The chair

crashes into a locker. Whitey hurries out.

A couple snickers from the players. Skip whirls.

Silence.

The Durham Bulls sit and stand quietly.

SKIP FLASHES THROUGH A SEQUENCE of signs. Hand to face, hand

EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAWN

THE DURHAM BULLS TEAM BUS is parked. Luggage is loaded. Sleepy

players arriving, escorted by wives and girlfriends.

ANNIE BIDS NUKE GOODBYE -- Off to the side. She pulls

something from her handbag and hands it to Nuke. A pair of

WOMEN'S RED PANTIES, with lace and frills.

NUKE STUFFS THE PANTIES in his pocket, bewildered. A small

kiss from Annie, and he hurries to the bus.

INT. LOCKER ROOM -- DAWN

PLAYERS THROW THEIR GEAR into their travel bags.

A PAPER BEER CUP IS TAPED TO THE WALL -- With a sign:

Franklin sings "R-E-S-P-E-C-T".

DEKE TURNS HIS VOLUME LOUDER -- Mickey does likewise, and

soon we have DUELING TAPE DECKS. C & W going head to head

with R & B. A cacophony.

SKIP LEAPS TO HIS FEET, WHIRLS and shouts.

Silence.

And then from the back of the bus, some soft, gentle, but

slightly dissonant guitar chords.

THE BACK OF THE BUS -- Nuke sits across the aisle from Crash,

who's re-reading Thomas Pynchon. Nuke has a guitar and is

struggling with some chords to "Try a Little Tenderness".

He butchers the chords and the words.

CRASH STRONGARMS THE GUITAR from Nuke.

CRASH WHIPS THROUGH THE FIRST FEW BARS of the song.

HE SHOVES THE GUITAR back at Nuke.

Nuke looks at his left arm rubs his shoulder curiously.

Tony and Deke overhear this and turn around. And Crash gets

wistful, lyrical, and even slightly hopeful.

Nuke, Tony, and Deke murmur in awe at Crash's pronouncement.

CRASH HOPS TO HIS FEET as the bus barrels along, grabbing

Nuke by the collar.

Nuke quickly has second thoughts -- Crash can be terrifying.

Nuke sits back down. Calms. Reaches for a baseball sitting

nearby. He hands the ball to Crash.

Crash takes the ball gently and speaks softly:

As the bus rolls through the country:

A LATE 60'S OLDS CONVERTIBLE ROARS PAST -- Max Patkin at the

wheel. He waves at the team bus and honks.

The opening bars on the National Anthem -- "Oh Say Can You

See"

And Max roars off through the rolling green-landscape...

Hit Hank Williams music to play over:

several second delay.

HIS ASSISTANT (P.A. ANNOUNCER FROM THE BALLPARK) has a phone

to her ear, and writes down each play on a piece of paper,

holding it up for Teddy who enhances shamelessly in his ON

THE AIR "play by play".

CLOSE ON PAPER -- His assistant writes "DOUBLE TO LEFT".

TEDDY HITS A TINY MALLET against a jar. Thunk. The sound of

ball hitting bat. He punches one of several tape cassettes

cued up. A crowd roars. An array of special effects is at

does he picks up two spring loaded hand exercisers and begins

pumping them an he talks.

Crash can hardly keep up. So he slows her down --

Annie launches into a tirade without orchestration or self-

awareness. She's frustrated, confused, angry and...

Annie slides against the wall down to the floor. Tears flow.

Her makeup runs. Her eyes are red.

Crash gingerly helps her to her feet.

INT. MAXWELL'S BAR -- DAY

ANNIE AND CRASH SIT IN THE CORNER of the empty bar.

down the hallway, and as they do:

We begin hearing singing -- raucous, soulful, drunk.

NUKE STOPS IN A DOORWAY -- Looks into the "waiting room".

-- P.O.V.  SEVERAL HOOKERS in various stages of undress, sit

on couches and chairs. Bored, smoking, ancient. The ONE WHITE

HOOKER, a skinny 25 year old, accompanies on a guitar,

struggling to keep up. And a couple HOOKERS are hanging around

a piano that --

CRASH IS PLAYING and singing. He doesn't look up. Crash is

dressed but barefoot. A cigarette dangles from his mouth as

he accompanies himself with decent cocktail lounge chords.

Two Hookers at the piano hum along.

NUKE STEPS INTO THE ROOM -- All the Hookers rise in

anticipation of a new customer. Crash keeps playing, never

looking up.

Nuke interrupts the instrumental passage:

Crash Ignores him, keeps playing.

As Crash plays on --

NUKE GRABS CRASH by the hair and jerks him to his feet. The

two men are face to face.

NUKE LETS HIM GO and Crash staggers drunkenly against the

piano, regaining his balance as:

don't know if he's just being clever or if, somehow, he's

staged It all. Maybe even he doesn't know.

NUKE TOSSES HIS BAG in the Porsche and motions to Annie.

They step away from the others.

NUKE PULLS ANNIE'S RED PANTIES from his jacket pocket.

through the mill. She accepts them graciously.

They look at each other awkwardly, sweetly, and:

NUKE KISSES ANNIE GENTLY ON THE LIPS -- They hesitate, and

Nuke heads for his Porsche.

his father and climbs into his car.

but it's all good natured.

CRASH COMING OUT OF THE SHOWER -- Toweling off, watching the

innocent, vulgar fun. He sits down in front of his locker,

drying his hair, when the CLUBHOUSE BOY approaches:

CRASH RISES AND HEADS FOR SKIP'S CUBICLE -- Wearing only a

towel and his shower shoes.

INSIDE SKIP'S OFFICE -- Skip and Larry sit in postgame

routine, checking charts, smoking, half dressed.

CRASH ENTERS as he's still drying off.

And it hits him. Crash looks at Skip, who looks down at the

floor, unwilling to face Crash who then looks at Larry, who

also looks away nervously.

CRASH SHUTS THE DOOR -- The party rages beyond.

CLOSE ON CRASH -- He's been in the game too long to be

surprised; nonetheless, he's surprised. And hurt. His stoicism

is professional.

ANNIE POURS A DRINK for both of them.

CRASH PUTS A HAND ON HER HIP -- Annie closes her eyes, a

tiny gasp. He kisses her forehead. She kisses his neck. A

tiny smile from Crash. The same from Annie.

SHE KISSES HIM on the corner of his mouth. Her hand finds

the back of his head and she runs her fingers through his

hair.

CRASH RESPONDS -- They kiss slowly, deeply.  As --

HIS HAND ON HER HIP PULLS UP HER SKIRT -- By degrees, the

skirt is raised up her stocking covered leg. At last exposing

the beloved BLACK GARTER SNAPS -- Crash's hand expertly holds

up the skirt and effortlessly UNSNAPS THE GARTER with a

minimum of effort.

FLICK, FLICK, FLICK -- The garter snaps are free.

THE BEDROOM -- Crash carries Annie to the bed.

ANNIE'S FOOT KICKS OVER A LAMP onto the floor.

ANNIE'S BLOUSE FRONT -- Flick, flick, flick. Crash unbuttons

it with one hand in seconds. Even Annie is startled with the

speed and ease of Crash's hand.

HER HAND SLIDES UNDER THE WAISTBAND of his underwear

HIS HAND SLIDES UP UNDER HER panties.

A FULL EMBRACE ON THE EDGE OF THE BED -- Remnants of clothes

cover parts of their bodies.  They tumble out of control to

the floor.

ANNIE'S HAND GRABS ONTO A DRESSER LEG -- A carved oak antique,

her hand holds on tight and shakes the dresser.

THE DRESSER TOP SHAKES -- Makeup bottles and pictures and

dozens of Annie's special things rattle and fall

ANNIE'S READ RESTS ON CRASH'S STOMACH -- Post coital, they

lie on the floor blissfully as Piaf finishes.

ANNIE CHANGES THE RECORD to Hank Williams.

THE KITCHEN -- ANNIE AND CRASH eat an after mid after sex

snack. Crash eats a bowl of Wheaties. They each wear one of

her robes.

Annie sits, munching a carrot and rolling a joint of marijuana

she keeps in a Victorian jewel box.

THEY KISS AGAIN -- And fall gradually onto the table top.

ANNIE SITS ON TOP OF CRASH lying on the kitchen table.

He stretches out a leg and:

KICKS THE BOWL OF CEREAL to the floor. It smashes -- ceramics,

milk, cereal go everywhere. As:

THEY START MAKING LOVE AGAIN in the glaring kitchen light.

CRASH AND ANNIE DANCE in her living room.

THE BEDROOM -- Crash is handcuffed to the bed. He seems

perfectly happy as Annie reads Walt Whitman.

ANNIE HANDCUFFED TO THE BED -- Crash reads.

CRASH AT ANNIE'S RECORD COLLECTION -- He thumbs through it

quickly, puts on a new record.

The Dominoes sing "Sixty Minute Man".  And...

THE BATHROOM -- Candlelight around the bathtub. All we can

make out is two heads, two bodies, sloshing wildly In the

dim glow. Water splashes, dowses some candles.

CRASH AND ANNIE IN BED READING -- Each with a copy of a Thomas

Pynchon novel. Crash tosses it aside. And disappears under

the sheets, playing with her as she struggles to keep reading.

She puts down the book.

ANNIE APPLYING EYE MAKEUP TO CRASH -- Who doesn't resist,

seems even amused. He kisses her deeply, slowly. She kisses

him back. They fall onto the bed.

P.O.V.  OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW -- Dawn. A bird chirps.

And we hear a record skipping, repeating endlessly.

PAN ACROSS THE KITCHEN -- Overturned chairs, spilled and

broken cereal bowls, liquor bottles.

PAN ACROSS THE BEDROOM -- A disaster. Clothes scattered across

the floor, overturned lamps, the bed lies at a cockeyed angle.

Annie and Crash lie face down -- asleep, utterly spent.

CRASH WAKES UP SLOWLY -- Reaches up and pulls his underwear

off of a lampshade, pulls them on, and gets slowly out of

bed. He staggers across the bedroom floor, stumbling a bit,

into:

THE LIVING ROOM -- He stumbles across the trashed room.

Record album covers, more liquor bottles, pillows, cushions,

pictures hanging crookedly on the wall.

CRASH TAKES THE SKIPPING RECORD off the player and breathes

a sigh of relief. He sees his pants lying on the floor and

pulls them on.

CRASH OPENS A DRAWER -- Pulls out a piece of paper and a

pencil. He starts writing...

INT. THE BEDROOM -- LATER

Sun streams in. Annie opens her eyes. Rubs them. Reaches

over for Crash. Her hand hits a note. She whirls. He's gone.

Only a note.

SHE SITS UP WITH A START and reads the note.

ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSE UP OF NOTE -- "Love, Crash".

EXT. GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS -- DAY

CRASH IN HIS CAR heading for Asheville.

EXT. ASHEVILLE BASEBALL PARK -- DAY

CRASH KNOCKING ON THE BASEBALL OFFICE DOOR -- Looking for

work.

INT. ASHEVILLE LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

CRASH UNLOADING HIS GEAR into yet another locker.

INT. ANNIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

ANNIE SCRUBBING HER KITCHEN FLOOR -- Down on her hands and

knees, picking up the broken cereal bowl.

SHE FINDS A BIT OF A JOINT on the floor as she's cleaning.

She picks it up, sits on the floor under the table, and lights

the tiny joint.

EXT. INSIDE A MAJOR LEAGUE STADIUM (ATLANTA) -- DAY

NUKE IN STREET CLOTHES IN THE DUGOUT of an empty stadium.

50,000 seats. Slick. Awesome. He's being interviewed by a

BIG LEAGUE REPORTER, who has a small tape deck and has stuck

mike in Nuke's face.

THE BIG LEAGUE REPORTER nods attentively as Nuke knowingly

delivers the cliches like a veteran.

EXT. ASHEVILLE STADIUM -- DAY

In sharpest contrast to the Big League stadium, a rickety

old wooden grandstand, carved into the pine covered hillside.

CRASH STEPS TO THE PLATE -- In a uniform we've never seen

him in, of course. The Asheville Tourists. He picks up some

dirt, rubs it on his hands. He's as intense as ever. Still

playing for keeps.

CRASH'S P.O.V. -- SLO-MO AS THE PITCHER WINDS AND delivers a

fastball right down the pipe.

INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- AFTERNOON

ANNIE LIES IN BED READING -- She suddenly jerks up.

EXT. ASHEVILLE STADIUM -- DAY

CRASH UNLOADS A MONSTROUS HOME RUN deep into the trees. He

stands at home plate watching it... like Reggie or the Babe.

And doesn't move. For several seconds he indulges himself

uncharacteristically -- until...

THE OPPOSING CATCHER SHOVES HIM toward first.

CRASH SMILES and takes the home run trot slowly. As he heads

toward first, HE RAISES A CLINCHED FIST for a brief moment,

a tiny gesture of triumph. And then, routinely, he just

circles the bases.

A HUNDRED FANS APPLAUD ROUTINELY as he circles the bases.

INT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

SHE LIGHTS A CANDLE for the home run. Above the candles,

displayed in the shrine, are her RED PANTIES.

EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- DAY

ANNIE AND JACKSON OPEN AN UMBRELLA in her familiar place in

the stadium. Umbrellas go up all around, as:

THE RAINS COME -- The players huddle-in the dugouts.

IN THE DUGOUT Skip and Larry reading copies of "The Tantric

Yoga of Sex". And spitting tobacco.

THE GROUND CREW DRAGS TARPS over the mound and the plate.

ANNIE AND JACKSON POP OPEN THEIR UMBRELLAS and walk out of

the ballpark towards home.

EXT. DURHAM NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY

ANNIE AND JACKSON UNDER UMBRELLAS -- He turns down one street,

she heads toward home.

EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

AS SHE APPROACHES -- She stops. Looks up. Crash's beat up

car in the driveway.

P.O.V.  CRASH SITTING ON THE PORCH SWING Still raining.

CLOSE ON ANNIE -- She hesitates, and smiles.

ANNIE SITS DOWN on the porch owing next to Crash.

A moment of silence over the significance of him quitting.

He smiles slightly and takes her hand.

He rises, takes her hand, and they head inside.

And as the rains fall on Durham...

INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

THE SHRINE GLOWS -- Candles everywhere. Rain pours down on

the windows outside. And...

ANNIE AND CRASH SIT ON THE COUCH together, in silence.

The music -- Dave Frishberg sings "Van Lingle Mungo".
