EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, NORTH CAROLINA. DAY

ON A BLACK SCREEN: Credits.

A RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMERS) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE LANGUAGE.

A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES: shrouded in a blue mist

like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small

town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to

the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack.

Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack.

A ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked

forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a

stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian.

Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the

ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet,

the blood pouring from his nose.

His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge.

A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes

down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary

field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants

grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and

its two exotic passengers passes by.

The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the

severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self-

conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts

of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt

to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by

her. An angel in this wild place.

Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to

translate into English:

As the Cabriolet passes, SWIMMER takes the ball an with a

whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. The game

resumes. Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other,

sticks and fists flailing.

EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. NIGHT

A SIDE OF BEEF turns on a huge barbecue. The battered teams

eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat,

illuminated by a roaring bonfire. Swimmer is sewing up a

gash in Inmans cheek as he continues to translate:

During this, Monroe and Ada have arrived, escorted by SALLY

SWANGER, a local woman, middle-aged, kindly, and her husband,

ESCO, a glorious curmudgeon. The Monroes are introduced to

various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the

crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from

Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's

preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches

Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches,

and winces with pain.

Sally collects plates for the Monroes. Hands them to Ada and

her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware. Esco takes

a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it. Monroe

pluckily follows suit.

EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN

CAPTION: PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA. JULY 30TH, 1864. IN THE FOURTH

YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR.

A STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT

surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty.

A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into

open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE

CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON

THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in

the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The

Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and

it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world

of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches.

IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water

for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a

large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the

stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole.

Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling.

INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN.

A dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes

burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose.

EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN.

Young OAKLEY, freshly recruited, approaches a group of men,

like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina

Regiment. He doles out breakfast. Inman, loading his heavy

LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry. Oakley serves

another, ROURKE, last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain.

Oakley keeps his head low as he serves.

INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN

Shadows and shapes. A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It

reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay

team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked

to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels.

EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN

A RABBIT, scared up, darts along the trench. Rourke sees it,

beckons to another Cold Mountain boy, Butcher.

Butcher chases after the rabbit, Rourke in raucous support.

INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN

The crouching man has wrapped FUZE WIRE around the last

barrel, and now retreats, paying out the wire as he does so,

as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards behind him.

EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN

Rourke weaves through the gun emplacements, laughing.

Great sport. Inman, fifty yards away, looks over, amused,

goes back to his gun.

INT. TUNNEL. DAWN

The fuze wire is lit. It fizzes towards the barrels.

EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN

Rourke is running BUT NOW THE GROUND BUCKLES UNDER HIM AND

HE'S BEING LIFTED SLOWLY INTO THE AIR, the earth swelling.

AN APOCALYPTIC EXPLOSION. FOUR TONS OF DYNAMITE RIP THE GROUND

OPEN IN A CRATER 135 FEET LONG, 90 FEET ACROSS, 30 FEET DEEP.

HORSES, GUNS, MEN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES AND THROWN UP INTO THE

AIR.

INMAN DISAPPEARS UNDER DIRT AND DEBRIS.

Pandemonium. The Confederates are in complete disarray. The

Federals pour forwards across NO MANS LAND, through the

peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. They

flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a

dense and impenetrable WALL OF SMOKE.

THEN THEY'RE INSIDE THE GREAT GASH OF CRATER AND CAN'T GET

OUT AGAIN, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud.

The Confederates regroup. Orders are yelled. Chaos developing

into battle.

The Confederates begin firing into the crater. Guns and mortar

wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death

trap.

Inman gets to his feet. Oakley with him, and rushes through

the smoke to the pit, emptying his LeMats into the crater.

LATER: A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the attack. Bodies

falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their

comrades even tighter. The Confederates make a pincer movement

outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in. It's

Medieval.

No escape.

THE CONFEDERATES jump into the pit to engage the Federals.

Hand to hand fighting. Too close for rifles, just bayonets,

and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that

hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which

does a terrible damage. Primitive. Unutterable carnage. Men

killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against

soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. An oozing

layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning

in slick.

YOUNG OAKLEY loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case,

clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with

a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal.

INMAN GOES AT IT. He's a warrior, punching and stabbing and

firing. A coldly efficient killer. He's grabbed from behind

and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle.

He falls and lands on top of Oakley, and he and his Federal

opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their

pillow. The slaughter continues over and around them, the

sound, the sound of hell and madness. The boy has his arm

around Inman, like lovers.

LATER: The Confederates run after the retreating Union

soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. Inman stands,

the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. The

crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. The victors are

yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. Butcher comes alongside

Inman.

A WOUNDED BLACK SOLDIER sits up as Butcher celebrates.

Butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket.

He looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons,

tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not

loaded. The wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself

like a crab away from Butcher. Inman yells at him, appalled.

He picks up another musket. It fires. The wounded Federal

slumps back, dead.

EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DUSK

THE AFTERMATH. The dead being piled up for burial, divided

into allegiance. Wounded prisoners able to walk are led away.

A great deal of casual looting. Of boots, of equipment, of

personal items. Inman sees a soldier in the crater, lining

up wounded Federals, putting their heads in a row. THE MAN

EXTRACTS A HAMMER FROM HIS BELT AND, SATISFIED HE HAS AN

ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENT, PROCEEDS DOWN THE LINE, SMASHING EACH

SKULL.

Inman turns away, sees another Rebel, extravagantly costumed,

a strange FIDDLE head protruding from his knapsack. This is

STOBROD THEWES. He's bent over a dead Federal, examining his

mouth. He reaches behind his back and roots around in the

knapsack, producing A PAIR OF PLIERS, WHICH HE INSERTS INTO

THE CORPSE'S MOUTH. He's yanking away when A SWINGING BOOT

connects with his head and knocks him to the ground.

Startled, he looks up to see Inman hovering over him.

He examines his fiddle for damage. Some orderlies pass,

lifting OAKLEY away on a gurney.

Oakley's pale as a maiden, the life leaking from him. Inman

walks a way with him. Oakley looks up, desperate to be brave.

Inman flicks his eyes to the Orderly, whose look confirms

the boy's wounds are certainly mortal.

INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT

Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them,

the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights,

groans.

EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

Inman walks around the campfires. He hears some fiddle music.

It's Stobrod.

Stobrod sees Inman. Inman stares, his expression an

instruction, the turns and walks away.

INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT

Stobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman.

Stobrod looks at Inman, confused.

Inman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play.

Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising,

increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone

else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in.

Stobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly

puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod.

The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away.

INT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT

A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone,

rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A

FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps

the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next

to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches

Inman, who makes a stand.

EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others,

including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to

one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide

arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to

the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the

ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses.

He slithers over them.

They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN

FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing.

Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate

lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting

against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep.

As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the

Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his

rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing

him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another.

The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party

and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from

the trees.

A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate

trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A

BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed

at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own

lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the

trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold

your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost

home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly

he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him.

Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty

yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK.

He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying

on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly

fade to black, all sound fading with them.

EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. 3 YEARS EARLIER. DAY

A WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge. Men

are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below

which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the

workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a

rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke

and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around

and Oakley, barely a teenager.

Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers,

ADA amongst them. She has the circumspect air of the blue

stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem,

the men's radar for her every move. Inman watches her as

Sally Swanger approaches.

UP ON THE ROOFBEAMS OF THE CHAPEL, the men are preoccupied

with talk of secession from the Union.

Ada comes over, carrying a tray of lemonade glasses. Calls

up to Inman.

Inman swings down. He feels the other men staring, burning a

hole in his head.

He drops down to ground level, takes the lemonade, scowls at

the other guys. They're breaking for lunch and as they make

their way to the trestle tables -- they enjoy jostling Inman.

And he turns and joins the other men gathering round the

tables for lunch. Ada watches him, intrigued. Rourke and co.

approach ESCO SWANGER, a known sympathizer with the North,

to give him a bad time.

Inman arrives just as Rourke points a warning finger at Esco.

He pushes the finger down to get by. Esco continues:

Esco's sons, ELLIS AND ACTON, who're working at the other

end of the building, have now arrived at the table.

The others are desperate to tease Inman.

Ada, at the lemonade stand again, watches them laughing at

Inman, who keeps his head fixed on the table.

EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

INMAN, ON A GURNEY, carried, someone with a cloth to his

neck, which is soaked through with blood. They start to run

with him, heading for the field hospital, worried that he

will die before the wound can be staunched, cauterized.

Throughout, A STRANGE MUSIC PLAYS, discordant notes jangling:

EXT. SWANGER FARM. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

-- from A PIANO, lashed to a cart, as it bounces along the

lane, passing the Swanger Farm. Sally comes out to look.

It's Ada riding next to one of the farmhands, a second boy

keeping watch over the piano. Sally goes over.

EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, SWANGER FARM. DAY

Inman's working in the field, stripped to his undershirt,

hot work, wielding a scythe. He hears something and looks up

at the edge of the lane, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO, which is

still strapped to the cart. She briefly raises a hand to

Inman, then nods to the farmhand who sets them on their way

again. Inman smiles, waves back, watching as the cart rumbles

off down the track.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

It's pouting with rain. INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE, ADA IS PLAYING

THE PIANO.

Men and women crowd into the parlour, in best clothes,

celebrating the completion of the Chapel. Inman is outside

on the porch, his coat soaked, water pouring off his hat. He

looks at Ada. She finishes. Monroe steps in front of the

applause, smiling. His words of thanks leak through the window

to Inman, who stands, watching, listening.

INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

Monroe circulates, with Ada. He nods at a group of men, who

congregate in one part, not mingling. Their leader, TEAGUE,

might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a

black crow in the corner, eyes flashing. Ada doesn't know

them. Esco comes by. Monroe puts a hand on his arm.

And Teague raises his glass across the room.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

Ada appears at the door opening it onto the porch. She's

carrying a tray with drinks. Acknowledges Inman.

He goes into the night rain. She watches him.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

A beautiful day, the farm peaceful. Inman walks up the path

to the farmhouse, its borders flowering and pretty, a slave

woman weeding. He knocks on the door. Monroe answers.

Inman hovers, awkward. Ada appears, awkward.

Ada comes forward, takes the package.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Monroe and Inman and Ada touring the farm. It's a biggish

property, over three hundred acres. And well-tended by the

dozen slave farmhands who work it, some of whom are dotted

about in the landscape. Rolling mountains dominate the view.

Ada walking behind, comes alongside the two men, threading

her arm into her father's but, by so doing, also arriving

next to Inman.

Inman looks at Ada. No word.

INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

From the window Ada watches the Cabriolet head towards town.

At the piano, she unwraps the leather lace from the package

of music. Inside the first book of music, there's a

DAGUERREOTYPE OF INMAN with his LeMats, a typical Confederate

pose. Some of the music has left its imprint on the picture,

the notes like a melody over Inman's face. Ada picks them

out on the piano.

The ebullient sound of Shape Singing. A noisy choir letting

rip --

INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, MAY 20TH, 1861. DAY

-- THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SINGING, MEN TO ONE SIDE: WOMEN TO

THE OTHER. Monroe conducts, sings. Inman is there, as is

Ada. He fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls.

The door bursts open. Young OAKLEY, apologetic nod to Monroe,

sits at the back, then leans forward, as the singing

continues, to say something to Rourke, who says something to

Butcher, the news spreading like wildfire. Rourke gets up,

leaves. Butcher gets up next, follows. Another man. Another.

Depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the

older men are singing and one side of the church is

practically empty.

Inman, remains, fixed on Ada. Who does not look round.

EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

Those left in the congregation now spill out into what has

become a melee as the NEWS OF SECESSION goes up. Enormous

excitement, particularly among the boys, who now seem

curiously attractive to the girls. Inman blinks out into the

sun, Ada finds him. They're awkward as they watch other

sweethearts embracing.

TEAGUE AND HIS MEN COME RIDING UP THE STREET, their horses

clearing a path amongst the celebrating crowd. Teague reins

in his horse and rides it up against Esco Swanger.

Inman steps between Esco and Teague, holding the reins of

Teague's horse, easy and dangerous.

Teague produces a document, which he waves in the air.

And he spurs on his horse, his fellow Home Guard falling in

behind, riding on over the ridge. Inman walks to Ada.

She puts a hand on his arm for a second. They both want to

get to the point of declaration but don't know how. They

stand, people noisy around them, those about to leave, those

about to be left.

And he does so, making his meaning clear for her to follow.

INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

Inman walks inside. Stands with his back to the door. It

opens and closes. Inman turns. It's Monroe.

Now the door opens again and it's Ada. She's dismayed to see

her father.

He indicates they should both leave. Inman sits at a bench.

EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

Monroe and Ada come into town in their cabriolet. They pass

under banners proclaiming the Confederate cause: Old Rip's

Awake! Watch out Yankees! The trap draws up by the Cold

Mountain General Store. Monroe lets Ada down.

Monroe smiles in acknowledgement, gets back in the trap. Ada

heads into the store.

INT. BEDROOM. ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

INMAN SITS ON HIS BED, wearing pants and a vest. His room is

like a monk's cell. Nothing in it. Inman's trunk is packed.

He's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside

the boot, the other blacking it. There's a knock at the door.

He opens it. It's Ada. He abruptly closes the door on her.

INT. HALLWAY, ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

Ada waits outside. She's not sure what's happening. Then

Inman opens the door. He's buttoning his shirt. His boots

are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished. Somebody

walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl. They separate

as the man passes them. They're tender, awkward.

Inman takes it.

She has something else. Wrapped in paper.

HE KISSES HER, pressing into her, his arm circling her waist.

Below them the sound of a MARCHING BAND. It's the RECRUITMENT

PARADE and brings Rourke and Butcher racing down the stairs.

Inman pulls away from Ada as the boys hurtle for the front

door.

EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

Rourke, Butcher, and then Inman appear in the doorway of the

Rooming House, and then fall in with the motley crew of

Volunteers AS THEY MARCH BY WITH THE BAND AND THE ENLISTED

SOLDIERS. The town is out to wish them well, parents, younger

brothers, sweethearts walking alongside their brave men. Ada

comes to the door of the Rooming House. Inman looks back and

sees her, but almost immediately loses her in the crowd. THE

DRUMMERS DRUM, THE CROWD CHEERS, THE RECRUITS MARCH UP THE

HILL --

EXT. BEHIND CONFEDERATE LINES, VIRGINIA. DAY

-- AND THE WOUNDED AND THE WRETCHED STRAGGLE ALONG THE

RAILROAD.

A TRAIN with the seriously injured snakes past the back of

the Confederate lines -- its suburbs of supplies, arriving

and departing troops -- and into peaceful country. FIDDLE

PLAYS, THEN A BANJO.

INT. BOX CAR. DAY

A CROWDED WAGON. It's a cauldron, and those able smash through

the wooden walls to make a breathing hole. Some have their

heads thrust out like crated poultry. INMAN IS IN THERE,

neck bandaged, its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace.

The light plays black and white through the boarded sides of

the boxcar, flashing on Inman's face as he drifts in and out

of consciousness. He focuses and sees the strange head of

STOBROD'S FIDDLE. Stobrod is serenading him, accompanied by

an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man, PANGLE, whose

grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic,

grim world. Inman is panicked, puts a hand to push the fiddle

away. His voice is a croak, spoiled.

He changes his tune, and the tempo, finding a foot-slapping

rhythm, the two musicians grinning at each other. Inman lapses

back into unconsciousness. The rhythm becomes a hammering

sound...

EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

-- AS A MAN HAMMERS A TINTYPE OF HIS SON'S FACE into the

wooden porch of the Chapel, where it joins many other

portraits of those lost to the war. Monroe presides. One of

the slaves from Black Cove holds the ladder for the bereaved

father. Other families wait, with their own daguerreotype to

mount. It's a memorial service without bodies.

Riders approach. Home Guard. Teague brings his horse up

alongside Monroe at the Chapel door, tips his hat in

condolence to the bereaved families. With him is a young,

intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider, BOSIE, his hair

long, a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown. Somehow

sinister.

EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Cold Mountain at its loveliest. The CABRIOLET with Monroe

and his daughter heads towards the farm. At a bend they meet

a couple of riders, TWINS, from Teague's Home Guard, riding

furiously past them. Monroe reins in the trap and lets them

thunder past before continuing on their way home. Monroe is

intrigued by Ada, as if he's never looked at her before.

She squeezes his arm.

Then they see THE FAMILY OF SLAVES turn off the road as their

cabriolet approaches, running away into the fields.

Monroe gets out of the cabriolet and runs into the fields

after the retreating family, who are carrying bundles, chairs,

personal items, all loaded up. Ada has already taken the

reins and has driven up to the house. THE BARN IN WHICH THE

SLAVE FAMILY HAD LIVED IS ON FIRE. Monroe catches one of the

women, remonstrates with her. She's upset, distressed, one

of her sons comes back, pushes Monroe to the ground. They

hurry away. Monroe gets up, hurries to the fire.

A FIGURE SWINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE FLAMES, HANGING FROM A

BEAM. Monroe spies it as he catches up with Ada.

The figure swings round. IT'S AN EFFIGY, A GROTESQUE

CARICATURE OF A BLACK MAN.

Ada turns and runs off.

Monroe stands and considers the flames. Ada turns back once

more to see him -- a small man silhouetted against the blaze.

INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

INMAN lies; bandaged, eyes closed, in THE BALLROOM OF A

COLONIAL MANSION, co-opted as one ward of a Confederate

hospital. Rows of beds, the wounded and the dying, are lodged

between some vestiges of the room's former glory.

SOME LOCAL WOMEN, conscious of their duty to the cause, are

brought through by an exhausted doctor, who's lost all his

grace. The windows are open, but it's still insufferably

hot, the muslin curtains barely moving.

The women try to process this, the attitude.

One woman is overpowered by the stench, gags.

The women begin to approach the beds.

MRS. MORGAN, nervous, decent, sits next to INMAN. His mouth

is moving. She doesn't know what he's saying.

She bends to him again. His voice is a faint croak.

The Doctor is on his exit, stops at the bed.

The Doctor shrugs, not a detective, moves on, stops at the

man in the next bed. Has a brief look, calls to a nurse.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. LATE AFTERNOON

Monroe and Ada are outside, a picnic at the summer table,

autumn leaves blowing up around them. Nearby the charred

skeleton of the barn. Ada gets up, clears away.

Ada takes the dishes away. He gets out his papers, his pen

and ink.

INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

ADA PLAYS THE PIANO. Chopin's Prelude in E Minor. Outside in

the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign

chair, and is hunched over his notes. The door of the parlour

is open and the music floats over to him as he works.

Ada plays. A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN appear at the window. Then

the steady drumming of a summer shower.

She plays some more. Monroe hasn't come in. The rain splashes

on to the window..

After a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes

to the door. She stands at the doorway. MONROE'S SERMON IS

CAUGHT IN THE WIND AND BLOWS AROUND HIM, THE INK RUN TO

ABSTRACTIONS, his hand dropped and visible to Ada as, with

dread, she approaches. SHE CATCHES THE SODDEN PAPERS, CHASING

AFTER THEM, THEN REACHES HER DEAD FATHER.

He's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass

eyed. She leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs,

oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down

the lane.

INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT

INMAN'S FACE as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Mrs.

Morgan, the hospital volunteer, sits by Inman's bed. She

holds ADA'S UNOPENED LETTER, badly weather damaged, the pages

stuck together, the writing blurred where the ink has run.

There are various dates, which she decodes.

INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

Ada is writing at her father's desk. A lonely room.

INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT

Mrs. Morgan reads to Inman, trying to decipher the letter:

Inman is very still. Then, eyes glinting with determination,

gives a TINY NOD.

EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

Ada walks down the hill from the Chapel. There is an absence

of young people, but the older folk are gathered round the

General Store where a UNIFORMED OFFICIAL is reading from a

document.

The Official is flanked by Teague, Bosey and the twins, puffed

up with self-importance. Ada has to walk around him to enter

the store.

INT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

The Official continues outside as Ada enters. Ada approaches

Mrs Castlereagh, the owner.

They go to the back of the store, to a screened-off area.

Mrs. Castlereagh hands her over a packet of material. There's

another, more furtive, transaction to take place. Mrs

Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were

narcotics. Ada tears at the wrapping. It's a parcel of books.

EXT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

Ada emerges, almost collides with Teague. She wriggles past

him, tries to make her package invisible.

EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM - DAY

IT'S WINTER. A solitary RIDER jogs his horse through the

frost, towards Black Cove farm.

Ada is working at a handpump, failing to coax water from the

well. She's wrapped in blankets. The farm is somewhat unkempt

and so is she. The hem of her skirt is frayed. She rips at

it tearing off a strip of material, which she binds around

the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism. Then she

looks up to see the horseman approaching. It's Teague. Ada

immediately heads inside the house.

Teague arrives at the house, takes a brace of RABBITS from

his saddlebag. He heads for the gate. The gate needs oiling,

the path is overgrown, he looks at the pump handle, the

abandoned pitcher.

Ada opens the door, pinning her hair.

Ada takes them. She is very queasy with these dead animals.

He turns and stops at the gate, runs his hands through his

hair and uses the grease to ease the hinge. Then steps up

onto his horse, and rides away. Ada watches him. Shudders.

INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

Ada comes into the kitchen. A weak oil-lamp reveals THE TWO

RABBITS, partially covered on a plate, flies buzzing around

them, a little liquid leaking from them. Ada takes a knife

and contemplates skinning gutting them. Suddenly she gathers

them up and runs out.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

ADA BURIES THE TWO RABBITS. The wind howls. She covers the

little hole with soil and stones. Pumps out water to wash

her hands. Thinks she hears a noise, listens, alert to any

unfamiliar sounds, then hurries back to the house.

INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

Ada comes inside, she closes the door. Locks it. Puts a chair

against it. Goes upstairs, to her bedroom.

INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

Ada enters her bedroom. It's a chaos of books, clothes,

dishes. She closes the door, sets another chair against it.

Then drags her armchair up against that, books and papers

spilling onto the floor. She props up Inman's portrait, on,

the chair, as if he were guarding her. Sits on the bed and,

desolate, begins to write:

EXT. THE OCEAN BY THE HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

THERAPY FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS. Some of those convalescing

swim or are helped to paddle in the healing sea. There are

rudimentary wheelchairs. Inman, a long way from home, is

amongst those sitting in one of these, very still, grey and

sick -- but alive. He pulls at the dressing on his neck,

exposing the still raw and livid wound to the sea air.

Inman has his Bartram, his bookmark is the battered and foxed

picture of Ada, which he considers, before continuing to

read.

Behind him A HUNDRED SLAVES AT WORK IN THE FIELDS, and behind

them the Mansion which has become the hospital. A series of

bells, of shouts, and the slaves stop working, prepare for

the long walk home, congregating, then forming a line, herded

by the foremen.

Inman eases his position to bend over and dip his bandage in

the seawater. He brings the wet bandage to his neck, considers

the ocean, his fellow ragtag of wounded, the slaves, the

great fields, the Mansion. The whole meaning of this war

around him. A GRAVEL VOICE STARTS TO SING THE BLUES, CONTINUES

AS --

EXT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DUSK

The men return to the Hospital. A BLIND MAN IS SELLING PEANUTS

which he roasts over a small fire. HE'S SINGING AS --

EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

-- A tintype of OAKLEY is added to the Chapel's votives,

hammered in alongside Rourke and Butcher. There are fifty or

more images now, the paint flaking around them. The exterior

of the Chapel, three years on, has taken on the burden of

recording history.

There is no minister, no services, just the votives,

daguerreotypes or simply the names of those missing in action,

accompanied by tiny vases of wildflowers. The town shrouded

in mist, and quiet.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. SPRING. DAY

EVERYWHERE SIGNS OF PROFOUND NEGLECT, like a Grimm's fairy

tale of a deserted house. The fields are overgrown with weeds,

the gardens abandoned. The chickens have deserted the henhouse

and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the

packed dirt.

Sally and Esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the

chickens, and knock at the door.

They're seen from ground level, through a boxwood, as their

feet patrol the ground, turn away from the door, and then

retreat, their voices drifting away. Ada is there, crouching

in her hidey-hole, a blanket on the ground, her book. She

wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed.

During this a ROOSTER, black and gold, struts into the

boxwood. As the rooster approaches, Ada shudders, tries to

shoo it away without alerting her presence. Ada peers through

the boxwood as Sally and Esco close the gate and recede. The

rooster comes at her again. She rises up, kicking out at it,

while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her. Ada runs

from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which

continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house.

INT. ADA'S BEDROOM BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ada dabs at the scratches, her dress rolled down to the waist

to reveal her arms and shoulders. Now she shucks off the

dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement. There

isn't one, so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket

for something less dirty.

INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ada enters her father's room, wearing undergarments.

Everything as he left it and, in contrast to the rest of the

house, extremely tidy. She opens a wardrobe, finds one of

his coats, puts it on. It's much too big, and she rolls up

the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in

a swivel mirror. She turns the mirror away and the image

swings into --

EXT. GATES OF HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

-- the figure of Inman walking, frail, grey. A kind of

lurching walk, as if his balance isn't guaranteed. He gets

close to the gate and interests a Guard, on the lookout for

would-be deserters. A BLIND MAN IS SELLING PEANUTS which he

roasts over a small fire. He's always singing. Inman

approaches. When Inman speaks, his voice is a croak.

He's shoveling some peanuts into a twist of paper.

EXT. TREE PROMENADE, CHARLESTON. DAY

Inman and a bunch of other walking wounded make their way,

under supervision, towards the town. The grandeur of the

approach, the carriages. The sorry state of the soldiers.

INT. COURTHOUSE, CHARLESTON. DAY

TWO GREAT TRESTLE TABLES, LOADED WITH CLOTHES. Underneath

the tables, boots -- laced together, origins various. The

charitable womenfolk are helping match clothes to recovering

soldiers, some of whom are still on crutches, or in

wheelchairs. Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a

pair of boots. He accumulates a little pile. On his way out,

AN ELDERLY AND STAUNCH CONFEDERATE GENTLEMAN shakes his hand

and gives him an apple from the barrel.

EXT. TEMPORARY BARBERSHOP, CHARLESTON. DAY

Inman emerges from the Courthouse and joins the line for a

shave at the makeshift barbershop set up outside the

Courthouse. Two barbers, two chairs. A VERY ELEGANT SQUARE,

SOME STUCCO-FRONTED BUILDINGS, A GLIMPSE OF THE MONEYED SOUTH

IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE MODEST TOWN OF COLD MOUNTAIN. AN

AUCTION HOUSE OPPOSITE ADVERTISES SLAVES, CATTLE, LAND...

Inman settles in the seat. The Barber contemplates his scraggy

beard, the livid, scabbed wound on his neck.

INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. PREDAWN

It is almost dawn. The window by Inman's bed is a frame giving

onto the still dark world. The Night Guard passes by on its

patrol of the perimeter. A CLEAN-SHAVEN INMAN IS FULLY DRESSED

UNDER THE COVERS. He gets his hat, pushes his book into his

knapsack and, with one step up, WALKS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND

INTO THE WORLD.

EXT. THE OCEAN BY THE HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAWN

Inman, his footprints in the sand, as he hurries along by

the edge of the ocean, away from the hospital...

EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

-- as Ada walks, the wind kicking up around her, past the

Swanger place. She's bent and curiously dressed in her

father's coat.

Sally Swanger calls out from the field. She's concerned at

Ada's gaunt, ragged appearance. Ada waits for her approach.

And she folds her arm into Ada's. They walk up the lane.

INT. SWANGER FARM. AFTERNOON

Ada eats. Esco across from her contemplating her evident

appetite, the oversized man's jacket. Sally ladles more food

onto Ada's plate.

He starts to chuckle, then Ada, too, then Sally.

A look from Sally.

EXT. YARD, SWANGER FARM. LATE DAY

AN IMAGE -- DISTORTED, WATERY. IT'S HARD TO RESOLVE BUT COULD

BE A CORRIDOR OF TREES. THE SUN LOW AT ONE END, THE SILHOUETTE

OF A FIGURE WALKING SLOWLY FORWARDS, A SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF

CROWS.

Ada is bent backwards over the well, a hand mirror glinting

down into the blackness. The reflection is elusive against

the bright evening sky, the sun almost set, and low.

The image is clearer. The trees sharpen, the figure walking,

the steep incline of the corridor, all fiercely black and

white as if it were a carpet of snow and black hieroglyphs

of trees, and crows flying. The trick of the glass and the

watery disc of the well surface. A buzzing in Ada's ears,

something like a distant music. Then the figure seems to

suddenly pitch forwards, but at that moment, Ada -- canted

over, getting dizzy has to move and the image flies away,

replaced with the sky, the flash of the setting sun.

Ada's faint. She sits up, blank, a little shaken.

EXT. PLANTATION. DAY

Inman walks along an expanse of marshland. Great cranes fly

heavily over him.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. LATE AFTERNOON

Ada is writing in her father's campaign chair, a blanket

wrapped around her, a rake propped next to her.

Ada looks up from her writing with a start. She covers her

letter, guiltily, instinctively. In front of her, at the

gate, is A YOUNG RAWBONED, FERAL WOMAN, OF INDETERMINATE

ORIGINS. She is barefoot, and dressed in a hand-dye_ shift

of blue. Her name is RUBY.

Ada is instantly defensive, intimidated.

Ada gets up, nods to the corner of the yard. Ruby goes over.

The Rooster gathers himself up for a new opponent.

IN ONE MOVEMENT SHE PICKS UP THE BIRD AND TWISTS OFF ITS

HEAD.

EXT. CORNFIELDS. DAWN

Inman's walking on a track which passes through cornfields,

the crop high and thick around him. He stops, hearing

something. Riders. He wades into the field, seeking cover in

the tall crop, lying in the dirt. Horses appear. HOME GUARD

MEN ON PATROL, A CHAIN GANG OF PRISONERS: SLAVES, DESERTERS

IN TOW, A COUPLE OF FEDERAL SOLDIERS. They have dogs, which

sniff and growl, intrigued by the fields, called back by the

Home Guard.

Inman waits until they're well out of sight. AS HE GETS TO

HIS FEET IN THE GREAT FIELDS, ANOTHER BODY APPEARS, THEN

ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, ALL SLAVES ON THE RUN

DOTTED AROUND THE FIELD. He walks to the road, paying no

heed to them. They assemble, paying no heed to him and move

off in the opposite direction. Inman turns, looks at them.

They look at him, then continue on their way.

INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN

Ada wakes up to persistent knocking.

INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN

Ada enters blearily, clutching her novel. Ruby already busy.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

Ruby emerges, followed by Ada, chewing on a tomato.

She looks back at Ada for a reaction.

They're heading for the stable.

INT. STABLE, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ruby's already pitching hay. Turns to Ada.

Ada half-asleep, obedient, stunned by this energy.

EXT. A FIELD OF WEEDS, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ruby dictates a list to Ada as they bustle along.

Ada scribbles, walks, scribbles.

EXT. BARN, BLACK COVE FARM

Ruby up a ladder, inspecting the roof.

INT. COLD HOUSE, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ruby cleans out leaves and detritus from the stone channel,

allowing the stream to flow free and cool.

EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

Ruby doing her version of soil analysis, scrunching the earth,

tasting it, spitting it out. Ada makes a face.

EXT. OUTBUILDINGS, BLACK COVE FARM. AFTERNOON

Ruby looks up. Ada catches up with her.

EXT. APPLE ORCHARD, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

Ruby, delighted, contemplates the bounty of apples.

Ruby whoops, jogs away. Ada, exhausted takes a bite of an

apple, watches her.

EXT. A BLUFF. NIGHT

INMAN WALKS A ROCKY TRACK, FALLING AWAY TO THE RIVER AT ONE

SIDE, A STEEP CLIFF TO THE OTHER, the way itself broken and

precarious, bad country to meet an enemy.

Inman sees A LIGHT in the distance, a torch flicking in and

out of view, like a star to follow. He stops, narrows his

eyes to focus on the view, listening hard. He pulls out the

Lemats.

A MAN, ALL IN BLACK, A HORSE IN TOW, IS AT THE EDGE OF THE

GORGE.

The horse has a burden -- a sack or wrapped bundle draped

over either side of the saddle. The attempts to heave the

bundle onto his shoulders. He can't, and the bundle slips to

the ground, cover falling enough to glimpse an arm, a head.

IT IS THE BODY OF A BLACK GIRL. The man tries again to lift

her. He's clearly upset, despairing, his hat comes off to

reveal long, dandy's hair, all extravagant curls. He staggers

with the weight of the girl, heading for the lip of the deep

gorge.

He kisses the girl again and again, cheeks, mouth, mumbling

to her. He's at the edge now and can just let her go. THEN

INMAN'S GUN IS AT HIS TEMPLE.

He's retreating, on his way back to the horse.

He has the girl back on the horse. Inman brings the torch up

to his face. It's tear-stained.

EXT. VEASEY TOWN. NIGHT

Inman leads the horse, with Veasey ahead of him, hands tied

behind his back, desperate for a reprieve.

They're in the town's main drag now. There's a Chapel and

next to it, a small house.

Disgusted, Inman approaches the front door of the house.

And he leads Inman down a side path.

INT. VEASEY HOUSE. NIGHT

Veasey comes in, now carrying the girl. Inman comes behind,

the gun trained on Veasey as he sets her down by the fire.

He looks longing at the girl as he puts the blanket around

her shoulders. He turns to Inman.

Inman is incredulous that he thinks he can just go to bed...

EXT. CHAPEL, VEASEY TOWN. DAWN

INMAN HAS TIED A VERY DISTRAUGHT VEASEY TO A TREE IN FRONT

OF HIS CHAPEL. Inman is pinning a sheet of paper above

Veasey's head. It's covered in handwriting. A dog barks.

Inman has pulled a handkerchief from Veasey's jacket. He

stuffs it into his mouth, cutting this diatribe short. And

then he walks away leaving Veasey tied to the tree, cursing

through the handkerchief.

INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN

Ada asleep. Ruby enters, shattering the calm.

She picks up some discarded laundry, contemplates the

overflowing laundry basket.

EXT. BOTTOM FIELD. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ada and Ruby working with the horse to make the beginnings

of A SPLIT RAIL FENCE. As they struggle with a heavy rail,

Ruby is testing Ada.

They manage to get the first line of rail set down.

An old-fashioned look from Ada...

EXT. SUNKEN FOREST. DAY

Inman finds himself in A SUNKEN FOREST OF PINE. He moves

warily, his beard longer, his figure gaunt, his clothes

weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal.

He hears DOGS BARKING IN THE DISTANCE, FAINT SHOUTS. He picks

up his pace, skirts round the swampy lake.

EXT. CAPE FEAR RIVER. DUSK

Inman comes to the bank of a HUGE RIVER. The water, as the

light begins to go, is the color of mud, with bubbles,

belching to the surface, full of ugly prominent. Inman is

almost jogging now, an ear tracking his still distant

pursuers. The river is too wide to contemplate swimming and

now it begins to curve left, forcing him -- against his

judgment, to circle back. He approaches A SMALL JETTY.

A sign: Ferry $5. Yell Loud.

On the far bank there's A CABIN ON STILTS above the highwater

mark. Inman calls out, reluctantly, his voice still a kind

of growl. Then again.

A TINY FIGURE steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping

into a small canoe. The canoe heads against the current, the

rower's back bent with the effort. As the canoe approaches,

Inman sees that the ferryman is, in fact, A YOUNG GIRL, not

eighteen. She doesn't look at him. He produces five dollars.

She eyes the bill with contempt.

A dog barks in the distance. Getting closer. Inman turns to

the sound. The Ferrygirl is well aware of her leverage.

Inman is astonished to see VEASEY stumble out of the trees.

His head is shaved, his face bruised and swollen, his clothes

castoffs and ill-fitting, cinched at the waist with rope. He

stumbles towards Inman, urging him to get on with the journey.

He gets straight into the canoe.

Shouts, more barking. Inman jumps in the canoe, and they're

off. The Ferrygirl turns the boat around, rows them away

from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for

the thousandth time.

Inman sits, scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers. The

sun is sinking fast.

She has no love for the river. Another gurgle of viscous

bubbles around the canoe.

A sharp sound, a tiny thwack of ball on meat. The Ferrygirl

SUDDENLY SLUMPS BACK and falls into the water.

Veasey grabs out at the oar, but it goes, too. The girl sinks

quickly, A BLOODY GAP to the side of her head. Inman, on his

knees and stretching, can't help her. Then a second noise as

A HOLE THE SIZE OF A FIST appears in the canoe, just at

waterlevel. Water pours into the canoe. Dogs bark, and now

FIGURES are visible at the jetty. HOME GUARD. One of them

has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot. Inman

can see him sighting the rifle. They lie flat in the canoe.

ANOTHER GREAT FIST OF WOOD is gouged out. Now the boat is

almost full of water. Veasey spits out a foul mouthful. INMAN

ROCKS THE CANOE AND LETS IT TURN OVER ONTO THEM, Veasey

surfaces from under it, clutching the wood as a raft, but

the canoe CATCHES INMAN A BLOW TO HIS HEAD and he sinks.

Veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong,

holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets the

current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, then

up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver its

assault, another shot into the boat, another into the water

near to Veasey's arm.

THE GIRL'S BODY comes by them, carried by the river, the

dress billowing out almost covering her head. The sun has

gone, the light fading, the canoe sliding downriver away

from their aggressors.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CAPE FEAR. NIGHT

In the moonlight, the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and

Veasey drags a half-drowned Inman to land, both of them

retching with the vile river water. AN ALLIGATOR eases into

the river not ten feet from where they lie, lungs heaving.

They get up. Veasey to his feet, Inman to his knees.

Inman nods, coughs. And Veasey AIMS A KICK at Inman's head,

knocking him back into the mud.

INT. ADA'S BEDROOM. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

Ada, her hair plaited in a new and simpler configuration, is

working on Ruby's hair, while Ruby experiments with some

earrings.

A pile of Ada's jewelry on the bed beside them.

There's a small mirror on a stand. It has Inman's picture

stuck in it. She picks it up, removing the tintype, and

holding it up for Ruby to see her hairstyle.

She takes the mirror and shows Ada her simple plait.

She puts the earrings back in the pile.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

THE PIANO jangles down the rutted lane on the back of Mr.

Roy's cart. Ada watches, A SMALL FLOCK of sheep milling around

her in the path. Ruby is dragging a big sow towards the yard.

Ada picks up one of two sacks and staggers towards the house.

INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

Ada arrives in the kitchen. They've got it under control

now, scrubbed and orderly. She puts the sack down next to

another one. Her hands are calloused, the finger nails cracked

and ruined, stripes of earth under them. Ruby comes in,

struggling with the last sack, pleased.

They're working as they talk, taking the sacks into the

larder, putting out stuff for the evening meal.

There's a pause. Ruby not easy with her emotions. Abruptly

she jumps up.

EXT. RIVER, EN ROUTE TO SALISBURY. DAY

Inman stands in the river, hoping to catch a fish, trying to

concentrate. Veasey presides, complaining...

On a parallel track across the river, RIDERS... impossible

to say whether Home Guard or a Federal Raiding Party. Inman

splashes out of the water, pushes Veasey down, silencing

him. The riders pass.

Veasey spots something shining in the grass, picks it up.

IT'S A LONG TWO-HANDED SAW.

Inman is vexed, walks away. Veasey follows, experimenting

with the saw's music when flexed. Inman stalks on.

EXT. NEAR A FORD. DAY

Inman way ahead, full of purpose. Veasey still has the saw,

trots to catch up.

Inman suddenly stops, scowling, puts up a hand, listens.

Inman carefully scouts the track then, with great caution,

edges towards the river bank.

A HEAVY SET MAN labours in the water. He's contemplating THE

HUGE BLACK CARCASS OF A BULL which has slipped into the ford

and died. The man is wet and exasperated.

The man turns, his spirit evidently lifted by the prospect

of help. His name is JUNIOR. He's working on roping the

animal.

Veasey is immediately an authority on bull removal.

The three men contemplate the carcass, swatting away the

swarms of flies. Junior offers a swig from a jug of liquor.

Inman refuses, Veasey takes a long pull, shudders happily.

He walks into the wood.

He takes the saw, walks to the bull, gets on one side,

indicates Junior should go to the other.

And they begin to SAW OFF THE BULL'S NECK.

LATER, and they're in A VILE STEW OF BLOOD AND INNARDS. The

stomach opens and its contents gush into the creek. Veasey

is disgusted, draws back. The two other men haul up the rest

of the animal onto the banks. They're exhausted.

EXT. TRACK APPROACHING JUNIOR'S CABIN. EVENING

Junior, Inman and Veasey come around a bend and there's A

BIG CABIN LOOMING. It's in such poor repair that one end has

slipped from the stones which serve as it's foundation and

STANDS BADLY TILTED OVER. Junior roots up another hidden jug

of liquor, which he drinks from, then hands to Veasey.

They guffaw, delighted in the alcohol haze. Veasey suddenly

exclaims, hand in the air, rushes into the bushes.

EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK

The three men arrive at the yard. DOGS AND CHILDREN MILL

AROUND THE VISITORS. FOUR WOMEN COME OUT, one after the other

each of them in simple shifts which seem to emphasis their

voluptuousness, or so it seems to Veasey. They freely stare.

The women consider the men, then disappear back inside.

INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK

No real furniture. Veasey is shaving. Inman stows his knapsack

behind the woodburning stove, on which a big kettle of boiling

water steams away. Then he gets in the tub, his back to the

door.

Shyla comes in, brings the kettle over to the tub, pours in

the steaming water. She appraises Inman. It's intensely

sexual.

A second woman comes to the door. Dolly.

INT. JUNIOR'S CABIN, NIGHT

LILA, JUNIOR'S WIFE, spoons out stew from a vast pot. The

table crammed with customers -- her three sisters, the three

men, the herd of dogs and filthy children. Nobody speaks.

Each time Lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her

cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress.

Veasey's mesmerized. Inman is also getting drunk, his eyes

increasingly glazed. When Lila makes to sit down next to

Junior, he slides a hand up her dress, exposing a naked

buttock, which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away.

Junior grins, looks over at Inman, then nudges Veasey.

He begins to recite, has a verse in his mind.

Inman gets up suddenly, sways.

And he stumbles over to the fire where he instantly curls

up.

He gets up, wanders out of the door. Junior's eyes glint. He

jerks his head towards the girls then in the direction of

the smokehouse.

He picks up his gun and leaves Dolly gathering up the children

and herding them out.

Shyla stays, Mae having gone off after Veasey. Lila waits

until the children have gone. They consider Inman supine by

the fire.

Lila shepherds Shyla out, shuts the door, swigs from the

jug, walks over to Inman, then turns to the big table and

pushes pots and plates way down to one end to make a playing

field.

Then she bends over the prostrate Inman.

Inman stirs, glazed.

SHE SLIPS A SLEEVE OF HER DRESS TO REVEAL A FULL BREAST.

Inman is drunk, doesn't think he's awake. She takes her breast

to his mouth, and Inman suckles. Then she puts his hands

under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her

legs. She's naked.

SHE PULLS INMAN TO HIS FEET, KISSES HIM, THEN TURNS HER BACK

AND LIES FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE, HER BARE ASS UNDULATING IN

THE AIR.

He doesn't move, except to sway, eyes glazed. She turns.

She's kneeling now, her dress hunched up around her middle,

working the front of Inman's pants. He's in a swoon,

surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her

head. ON CUE, THE DOOR CRASHES OPEN AND HE'S STARING DOWN

THE BARREL OF JUNIOR'S SHOTGUN.

As Lila turns, Junior KICKS HER violently in the head,

knocking her over.

NEXT HE SWINGS THE SHOTGUN BARREL AGAINST THE SIDE OF INMAN'S

HEAD. Inman falls back. Junior goes to the door and whistles.

AND WITH THAT THE ROOM FILLS UP WITH A GROUP OF HOME GUARD

BRISTLING WITH WEAPONS AND PURPOSE. THEY SEIZE INMAN, DRAG

HIM OUT AS JUNIOR SPITS AND KICKS AT HIM.

INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT

Lila enters the smokehouse, hand to her bruised head. VEASEY'S

ON THE FLOOR, WITH DOLLY ASTRIDE HIM, HIS ARM CRUSHING A

NAKED MAE INTO AN EMBRACE. He considers Lila, beams:

THREE MEN BURST IN BEHIND HER, RIFLES RAISED.

EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT

Veasey led out, a CHAIN GANG waiting -- a bedraggled

collection of prisoners, slaves, deserters -- and now INMAN.

Veasey is joined to the line. It starts to rain.

EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

Ruby and Ada at the door of the Swanger house. They both

wear Monroe's clothes by now, like two little men. THEY'RE

CARRYING A SMALL SACK, A PIE UNDER A CLOTH. Ruby hammers at

the door, a little impatient. Sally Swanger opens it, has to

decode who it is under the clothes, the hats.

Sally's strangely awkward, lingering at the door, staring at

the gifts...

They all kiss, then the girls walk back down the path. Ruby

is vexed.

She contemplated the stubble fields they're passing.

EXT. A PATH. DRIVING RAIN. NIGHT

The Home Guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain

tips down. Between the horses, unprotected and drenched,

their prisoners trudge along the muddy path. Inman and Veasey

among them. Veasey has grown some beard.

AN OLDER MAN COLLAPSES, lies where he falls, not moving.

There's a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him. He

picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man. He

doesn't move.

The horses plough on. Inman shouts to BROWN, the leader.

Nobody pays any attention. He has to drag the body.

EXT. VEASEY TOWN. DAY

THE HOME GUARD ESCORT THE PRISONERS PAST VEASEY'S OLD CHURCH.

More days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners,

Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced. The

Home Guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the

prisoners to a horse rail.

Citizens go by, Veasey knows them all. Some of them spit

contemptuously at the Deserters. None of them recognise

Veasey.

Somebody walks by with a young child.

Veasey looks at Inman.

The child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away

from the chain gang by his mother. One of the other prisoners,

SHEFFIELD, leans in to Inman, his voice low.

A GROUP OF SLAVES ARE WALKING BY, CARRYING SACKS. One of the

women is pregnant. Veasey studies the group, sees the pregnant

woman, recognizes her.

In daylight it's apparent that Rebecca is a real beauty. She

turns at the sound of her name, stops, is confused. She sees

Veasey and approaches, appalled at his condition.

THE GUARD KICKS HIM.

Rebecca, reluctant, rejoins the other slaves, walks away

with them, but then turns back to look at Veasey. She clearly

cares about him. And seeing her has somehow broken his heart.

He turns away from Inman, towards Sheffield.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY

THE CHAIN GANG TRUDGES DOWN THE TRACK, horses on either side

of them, steep banks forming a V for the railroad. A TRAIN

IS COMING. Brown rides up to the prisoners, herds them off

the track. The train approaches quite slowly -- the boxcars

full of wounded soldiers. Some of the Home Guard dismount,

take out pipes. The prisoners wait, one of them sits down.

Sheffield says something to Veasey, who casually yanks up

the sitting prisoner. Inman suddenly understands what's going

to happen. The train is almost on them.

But it's too late. SHEFFIELD JERKS FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE

TRAIN, PULLING ALL THE OTHERS WITH HIM, their reluctance

tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming

train.

SOMEHOW THE CHAIN GANG GETS ACROSS THE TRACK, stumbling and

chaotic, the chains yanking tight, then loose, the tight

causing a collapse, the loose a recovery.

They run alongside the train, blocking themselves from the

fire of the Guard, Sheffield screaming tactics -- and then,

as the train starts to pull past them, they run up the bank,

now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIN THE HOME GUARD HAVE REMOUNTED

THEIR HORSES AND ARE RIDING HARD ALONGSIDE IT. Then they

have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top

of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along

the ridge. Sheffield's yelling with adrenaline, Veasey joins

in, elated. One of the guards raises a rifle, steadies himself

on his horse, FIRES. He catches Veasey, who crumples, spinning

round and falling down the bank, until Inman uses all his

strength and practically lifts him in the air. The chain

recovers and works back up the bank.

But then A SECOND BULLET catches another prisoner and this

time the effect is catastrophic -- THE WHOLE GANG JUST FLIPS

OVER AND PLUMMETS DOWN THE BANK. The Home Guard approach,

firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch

by the side of the track. Until all movement ceases. Inman

has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely, almost

completely covering his face. Brown arrives, considers the

carnage.

INT. BARN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

Ada's milking. It's barely daylight. She's slowly becoming a

country girl. Ruby appears in the doorway.

INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ada is in Monroe's bedroom, looks out as Ruby goes off to

town, jugs of cider swung either side of the horse. Ada goes

over to Monroe's closet, pulls out some clothes.

EXT. THE WINTER GARDEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ada buttons Monroe's dress coat and completes the SCARECROW

she's spent the day making, save for the hat, which she now

fixes on, pushing in a hat pin to secure it. She's made a

stern black thing and steps back to consider it.

Horsemen come riding along the lane. It's Teague and his

men.

He doesn't stop but raises his hat to Ada.

INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ada looks out at the Winter Garden. From that distance it

really does look like her father out in the field, arms

outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him. She finds

it unbearable, her tears coming, runs out into the fields,

attacks the scarecrow, pulling off the hat, the clothes...

EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. MORNING

THE SOUND OF TINY BELLS. A misty drizzle. A GOAT snuffles

around in the freshly turned dirt: A hand, pale and wet,

protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies

of the murdered Chain Gang.

SOMETHING SHIFTS UNDER THE DIRT, breaking the surface. Inman

wedged under three or four corpses -- their limbs and chains

wrapped around him, has regained consciousness. He coughs,

can't breathe properly, tries to work himself some air,

spitting out dirt. He makes a noise to distract the goat,

rattling the chains. Inman rears up, the bodies slithering

off him, but even then the animal only retreats a yard or

two. VEASEY SLIDES FACE UP, A BULLET IN HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A

MYSTICAL THIRD EYE. Inman feels a surprising loss and

tenderness. He heaves again, groaning with the pain of new

and old wounds.

EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

Ruby rides back from town along the river. An ugly looking

trap tied over the horses and three or four bulging sacks.

By an abandoned mill she sees the Home Guard under the trees.

She slows up.

Ruby rides on. She rides around the bend -- she's not far

from the Swanger farm.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY

Goats, their bells tinkling, munch around the tracks. One of

them turns at a noise -- a GROTESQUE VISION -- A MOVING,

SEETHING MOUND OF DIRT. It's Inman, inching along the

embankment, the chain of dead bodies in tow, a macabre tug

of war. He considers the goats, they consider him. He rears

up and finds himself STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN.

EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

Sally is pinning out white sheets, they're filling out like

sails in the afternoon wind. Ruby rides up. Sally seems a

little vexed to see her. She walks down to the gate.

Ruby rides off. Sally watches, then goes inside the house,

her energy changing immediately, as if she might faint.

EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. AFTERNOON

HARSH WHISTLES. A secret place, in the heart of a forest.

There's the answering sound of SMALL BELLS, a chorus of them.

Inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter. Goats

appear, they herd around the figure dragging the litter.

IT'S AN OLD WOMAN, silver haired, her face a leather map,

her clothes leather, everything about her like old leather.

HER NAME IS MADDY.

She and Inman round a bend and there's Maddy's house -- AN

OLD CARAVAN, long grown into the ground and plaited with

vines and creepers. Inman tries to sit up. An old whiskered

BILLYGOAT butts up against Inman, knocks him down. Maddy

pays no attention to the struggle, heads inside her caravan.

She emerges, with a bowl of water, rags, washes his face,

pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to

the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal. Inman is

barely conscious, he groans, trying to defend himself.

EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ruby rides up to the farm. She rides past the winter garden,

admires THE SCARECROW -- WHICH NOW PARODIES ADA, the same

outfit she once wore to visit Inman, the same dress, same

hat. Ruby grins as Ada comes over from the field.

Ruby gets off the horse, and they start unloading sacks.

Ruby opens the sacks.

EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

TEAGUE'S MEN RIDE UP TO THE FARM. Esco's out in the field,

labouring away, but with his shotgun by him. Teague stops

alongside the field, the rail between him and Esco. Esco

stops working, picks up his shotgun and goes over. Teague

has four men with him. MO and JO, the twins, huge, and with

the appearance of having less than one brain between the two

of them, GRAYLING, a reluctant-looking man, funereal in his

bearing, and BOSIE.

The riders slowly fan out, almost as if choreographed.

Esco comes over the rail fence, his gun loose in his hands.

He starts to fish out a tobacco pouch. Esco's gun swings up.

Teague shows him the leather pouch, shrugs, starts to make a

cigarette.

INT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

From inside the house, Sally watches everything. Her view

impaired by the sheets.

EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

Mo dismounts. Ambles past Esco, looks behind the sheets.

ESCO KICKS OUT AT HIM, the shotgun rigid and pointing.

Mo examines his breeches for a dust mark, wipes it off,

retreating in a turkey walk of examining and dusting.

BOSIE SUDDENLY DROPS OFF HIS HORSE, ROLLS ON THE GROUND.

Esco is momentarily distracted and, in that instant, Mo kicks

out at him, knocking the gun from his hands, which fires

into the air, a shocking sound.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ruby and Ada digging a trench by the smokehouse, laying in

the pale heads of cabbage. They hear the distant shot.

They stop. Listen. Look at each other, start running.

EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

Jo sets on Esco, knocking him-backwards into a sheet, where

it gets twisted, while Jo kicks and punches, little spots of

blood staining the sheet with each blow. MO PULLS OUT HIS

SABRE AND RUNS ESCO THROUGH, LEAVES THE SABRE IN DEEP, PINNING

ESCO TO THE SHEET, THEN SPINNING HIM ROUND IN THE SHEET SO

THAT IT TIGHTENS. A stain grows out from the blade, huge and

spreading. Teague walks to Esco.

Sally runs out, screaming. She tries to pull out the sabre.

MO REVERSES HIS RIFLE AND CLUBS HER TO THE GROUND.

Mo backs away. Sally is screaming. She watches, helpless, as

Esco dies in front of her, the sheet growing a darker red.

BOSIE, SMILING, FETCHES A ROPE FROM HIS HORSE, ALREADY NOOSED

AT ONE END. HE FLIPS THE LOOP OVER SALLY'S HEAD.

INT. BARN, SWANGER FARM. DAY

ELLIS AND ACTON SWANGER emerge from their hiding places,

unable to bear the sound of their mother's screams. They're

carrying an axe, a pitchfork, mad for revenge.

EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

BOSIE IS DOING SOME SORT OF DANCE ALONG THE FENCE RAIL. He's

very graceful, his hair flying, his hands out, one finger

nail extremely long, his boots stamping down on the fence.

UNDER HIS STOMPING FEET, THE RAIL POST IS PRESSED ON SALLY

SWANGER'S THUMBS. She can't scream any longer, because the

noose has practically strangled her. The rope's tied off to

Bosie's horse, which yanks on the noose with every slight

movement. Sally is prostrate in the dirt.

Her two boys come running from the barn. TEAGUE CASUALLY,

SHOOTS ELLIS WITH HIS RIFLE. BOSIE LETS ACTON GET ALL THE

WAY TOWARDS HIM AND THEN SHOOTS HIM FROM A YARD AWAY, THE

GUN SUDDENLY SPRINGING INTO HIS HAND. AS ACTON FALLS, BOSIE

DOES A FLIP TO DIVE OFF THE POST AND LAND ON HIS FEET NEXT

TO ACTON'S BODY.

EXT. SWANGER FARM. DUSK

Ada and Ruby, riding together on the horse, arrive at the

Swangers.

SALLY IS STILL PINNED UNDER THE FENCE POST. The noose around

her neck has been tied off to the post so that she can't

move. There's a bloody sheet draped over the edge of the

well. Blood on the ground. Ruby heaves at the fence.

Ada runs over. They struggle, can't lift it. Sally's lips

are moving.

She bends down, listens to her. Looks up at Ada.

She grabs a thick log off the stack, staggers back and in a

second they've inserted it into the fence and levered it up

and away from Sally's hands. They fall back onto the dirt.

Ruby cradles Sally. Ada nods towards the well.

Ruby looks over at the well, then at Ada.

INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY

An exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs,

wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary

store. Inman wakes up. He finds himself in a small cot,

wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck. He doesn't know

where he is or how long he's been there.

EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY

Maddy's sitting on a stool. There's a circle of stones where

her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it. Inman emerges

from the caravan. He's pale and unsteady.

She calls over a little goat. It ambles over affectionately

and nuzzles into her hand. She strokes it and scratches under

the chin. The creature gets increasingly tranquil.

She's still stroking the goat. It looks as if it's asleep.

In a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has SLIT

THE THROAT OF THE GOAT, putting the bowl underneath its neck

to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as

if it were only surprised and not dying.

During this she's shucked the skin off the goat with the

authority of someone who's done this a thousand times.

And the goat is now thin and pink, eyes bulging, a piece of

meat.

INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. EVENING

A woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which

pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling

in a pan.

INMAN IS EATING LIKE A MAN POSSESSED, WRAPPING THE MEAT IN

CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH. Maddy watches

him, adds another mound of meat to his plate. Inman nods in

thanks, but -- doesn't look up.

She opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads,

puts them near the stove, then dips into another jar and

pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs.

Inman is circumspect, views the stub lozenge with suspicion.

Inman puts it in his mouth, gags at the taste of it. She

hands him a beaker with milk to wash it down.

She starts steaming the poppies.

Maddy pricks open the poppies and collects their opium, then

hands Inman the liquid.

He drinks the laudanum she's made.

She dips a cloth in the steaming water, unbuttons his shirt.

She has a crock of what looks like treacle and vaseline. She

smears this salve over the neck wound and into his scalp.

Inman surrenders to the drug.

He obliges. She grimaces at the state of it, where the chain

has chewed into the flesh. Gets to work.

He slides off the stool and lays on the floor. Maddy goes

over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes

over him.

EXT. YARD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ada in the henhouse, collecting eggs, is confident now among

the birds. She emerges to find Ruby walking out of the

backdoor with the shotgun and a determined look.

They head towards the corn crib, bundled up against the cold.

A MAN IS KNEELING AT THE CORN CRIB, perfectly caught in the

art of stealing, his head forced away from view. Ruby hands

Ada the gun and approaches, warily.

She walks up to him and KICKS HIM HARD AS SHE CAN ON HIS

BACKSIDE.

INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

A strip of fabric, homemade bandage, being wrapped around

Stobrod's badly gashed hand. Ada is tending to him. Ruby is

cooking at the range, not remotely warm towards her prodigal

father, who looks rather comfortable. Stobrod looks at her.

Ruby walks over with a crock, wrapped in a cloth.

He goes to the door.

And he's gone. Ruby scowls. FIDDLE MUSIC BEGINS.

EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DUSK

THE FIDDLE CONTINUES, A BANJO JOINS IN.

Maddy is loading up Inman for his journey. She hands him a

bulging goatskin satchel.

She hands him an ancient flintlock pistol.

She turns, abruptly, mingles in with her goats. Inman nods,

knows that she doesn't want a fuss, although he wants to

make one, and turns himself, heads away from the caravan.

EXT. WOODS. DAY

THE MUSIC CONTINUES. A TURKEY calls. And again.

JUNIOR is hunting. He creeps through this clearing, eyes

peeled for the turkey, gun at the ready. His dog growls, and

he puts a hand over its mouth. He listens. Another call.

Junior moves, without sound, in its direction, stops for

several seconds under a tree, listening. He looks up. INMAN

IS PERCHED IN THE TREE. THE PISTOL FLASHES IN HIS HAND.

EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman drags Junior's corpse in to the

yard. The dogs whine and slobber over the body. Inman goes

straight into the Smoke House.

INT. SMOKE HOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman reaches behind the stove and

retrieves his bag. He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram,

opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers,

as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing.

EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman emerges with his bag, LeMats at

the ready. The women are all keening over the corpse, as it

a saint had passed away. Dogs, women all howling. A chicken

bobs in, investigates the glob of blood on Junior's skull.

Inman walks away, doesn't look at the women, who don't look

at him.

INT. RUBY'S ROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Ruby wakes up. Looks out of the window.

Ada, also woken, comes into Ruby's room. STOBROD IS OUTSIDE

WITH PANGLE, VIOLIN AND BANJO. Ruby opens the window,

scowling. Stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food,

points at Pangle in his new coat. Pangle waves.

Stobrod and Pangle smile and hurry away.

EXT. PATH IN HILL COUNTRY. DAY

WINTER SETTING IN. Inman, increasingly a stick figure in the

landscape, wasted and fragile, trudges along through fallen

leaves. He still limps from the leg irons. No shelter

anywhere. He unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat

meat and corn bread. He walks and eats, fishes out a lozenge,

tries to swallow it, washes it down with a drink from his

flask. Opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease

into his neck and ankle. The path splits. He doesn't know

which way to go, A CROW repeatedly caws off to the left and,

taking it as a sign, Inman goes in that direction.

INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

Ada in the bed, reading to Ruby from Wuthering Heights.

She lies back in her bed. Ruby takes the book, lies across

the bottom of the bed, as Ada goes to sleep.

EXT. SMALL WOOD. NIGHT

DRIVING RAIN. Inman shelters under a huge tree, whose split

trunk provides a mean shelter. He inserts himself into the

cleft of it, a black thing in a black tree, like a troll. He

stands, shivers, sodden, desolate.

EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

A LITTLE CABIN. Its lights coming through square windows

like a chinese lantern. Inman considers it, the risk versus

the shelter.

The sleet still pelts down on him and he decides to approach.

Closer he can hear a sound coming from the house. IT'S A

BABY'S INCESSANT CRY. HE SEES A YOUNG WOMAN WALKING ROUND

AND ROUND IN THE ROOM, CLUTCHING THE BABY WRAPPED UP IN A

QUILT.

Inman knocks hard on the door. The light from the lamp goes

out, although the fire still gives the room a clear glow.

THE TINY SOUND OF THE DOOR BEING BOLTED.

No answer. Inman accepts this as a rebuttal, and trudges

back towards the road.

Inman turns. A gap in the door appears, the figure barely

seen.

The baby's crying behind her.

INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

Inman enters the cabin. It's a single room. A big fire. The

baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it.

The woman is already at the little stove. She turns to him.

She's painfully beautiful. But sad and fragile. Inman, despite

himself, is mesmerized.

Inman takes out his gun. She starts, terrified.

He turns it handle forwards and offers it to her.

She never once looks at him. Her eyes on the floor or the

food or the baby.

She hands him a plate of steaming beans. An onion perched on

top.

She goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts

the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd

lament. Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire.

He picks up the onion, bites into it. Sara looks across.

He takes another bite. Sara picks up the baby.

Inman, embarrassed, turns his back to her. He sits finishing

the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the

shoulder from her dress. While the baby feeds.

EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

Sara walks ahead of Inman. She carries a pile of clothing, a

pair of boots. It's still wretched outside, she hugs the

house, the porch barely offering shelter. INMAN FOLLOWS,

with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his

arm. She hands him the clothes.

There's a palpable attraction between them, so that every

exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge.

By the dim light, Inman peels off his clothes, sets to work

with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean.

He can be seen from the window and finds himself turning

away to pull off his pants.

INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

Sara sits at the cot, still singing to the baby, then gets

up, goes to the window, sees Inman dressing, walks to the

door, lets it open a little, but not so as she can be seen.

EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

Inman settles down into the corncrib. He's cold and everything

is damp and lumpy and uncomfortable. He pulls his thin blanket

around him. The wind is howling. He levers himself up, looks

at the house with its warm invitation, can almost feel Sara

in there. He reluctantly settles down again.

HE HEARS A NOISE, STEPS APPROACHING. HE REACHES FOR THE LEMATS

UNDER THE BLANKETS.

She stands in a shift, a blanket over her shoulders. Her

body under the cotton very clear to him. She turns and goes

back inside.

INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

Inman comes in. Sara is sitting on her bed. Long silence.

He sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then

removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers. There's

an electric space between them. Then Sara begins to cry,

pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him.

SHE SOBS, SHUDDERING IN THE BED.

They lie, staring up at the ceiling, her tears falling. A

FIDDLE PLAYS HEAVY WITH YEARNING...

INT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. CHRISTMAS DAY. NIGHT

THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing

hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering

it. They're in the abandoned Mill, a derelict space, which

has been cheered up with some rudimentary Christmas

decorations. Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost

completely white. Some token presents. Pangle is picking at

a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, GEORGIA,

with a harmonica. As they play:

He starts the tune of Wayfaring Stranger. Ruby groans.

And he starts up again, but this time GEORGIA BEGINS TO SING.

He's like a pale angel and sings with a soft, true voice.

Ruby finds herself taken by this boy's voice and by Stobrod's

extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild

journey. Ruby sits next to Ada, fiddles with her bracelets,

slips one from Ada's wrist and slides it over her own.

EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

They're all outside now, shaking hands.

The three women walk down the lane, the three men watch.

EXT. SWANGER FARM. NIGHT

The three women head towards Sally's house.

They all three have linked arms. Ada imitates Stobrod.

INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. MORNING

Ada at the window as, outside, SNOW FLAKES BEGIN TO FALL.

EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

Stobrod opens the door of the Mill. The SNOW FLAKES dissuade

him from venturing further. He goes back inside.

THE DOOR SHUTS, FIDDLE MUSIC LEAKS THROUGH THE DOOR, FOLLOWED

BY BANJO AND HARMONICA.

INT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY

Sara, dressed, agitated -- the baby already complaining --

is urgently shaking Inman. Hissing at him:

Inman surfaces from deep sleep.

Inman is up, grabbing clothes, boots, his gun.

She pulls up the window in back of the cabin. Inman throws

things out into the freezing morning. He has his pants on,

but is otherwise naked. He swings over the window and down

onto the frosty ground.

EXT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY

Inman picks up his stuff and, at a crouch, runs for cover to

the wood which borders the property. He can hear horses and

a commotion at the front of Sara's cabin, but doesn't look

round until he's sheltered by the trees.

FEDERAL SOLDIERS, a raiding party, have dismounted and are

already wrangling with Sara. Inman watches, pulling on his

shirt, shivering, then his boots.

Sara is standing in front of the hogpen, as if to protect

the animal, but one of the soldiers, PISTOL, barges her to

one side, toppling her, and opens the gate, starts herding

the hog out into the yard. A second soldier, NYM, emerges

from the cabin, carrying Ethan. Sara starts up, struggles

with him, is again knocked down.

INMAN HAS TO WATCH AS THEY DRAG HER OVER TO A FENCE POST AND

ROPE HER TO IT THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OFF THE BABY AND LAY IT

ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD.

Then Sara starts to scream.

Inman is dressed. Boots on. He looks back at the yard. The

men sitting, smoking, prepared to wait, their breath coming

out in gusts in the freezing air. Flakes of snow fall.

A third Federal, BARDOLPH, chases after the chickens, gathers

them up.

Nym gets close to her, putting his rifle to her chest.

Nym unties her. Pistol has a rope around the hog and now

leads it towards the horses.

She's wailing, an unbearable ululation. NYM SLAPS HER, TWICE,

HARD.

INT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY

The door is kicked open. Nym pushes Sara inside, kicks the

door shut, REVEALING INMAN STANDING BEHIND IT.

EXT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY

Bardolph, a chicken in his arms, goes over to the baby.

Pistol heads towards the cabin. As he approaches the door,

Bardolph rearranges the blankets to, cover the baby. Pistol

opens the door. Nym is on top of Sara. Pistol laughs, enters,

and is clubbed down by Inman, who steps out onto the porch,

while SARA SHRUGS OFF THE BODY OF NYM, HIS THROAT CUT.

Bardolph looks up to see Inman walking towards him. Bardolph

has left his weapon by the fence.

Bardolph obeys, terrified. Sara runs out, collects Ethan,

gives a little moan of anguish, runs back inside the cabin.

AND THEN A SHOT RINGS OUT AND HE CRASHES TO THE GROUND, DEAD.

Behind Inman, Sara stands with a rifle.

EXT. SARA'S CABIN. LATE DAY

THERE'S A HUGE FIRE GOING, WITH A CAULDRON HUNG OVER IT. THE

HOG HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM A TREE, BLOOD DRIPPING INTO A

BOWL.

There's a sense of ritual and order: the chapters of

transforming the hog into food.

Sara is inside the cabin, the door open onto the yard. She

holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight.

She tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed. She

puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside.

Now Inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side

of the spine to make two sides of meat. Now Sara is holding

up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. Now she's

rendering the fat into lard. Now Inman's salting the two

hams. Now Sara's washing the intestine. She sings all the

while -- I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and

my bride bed full of blood -- they don't really converse.

Inman continues to work.

Sara goes back inside to Ethan's crib. Inman glances back,

but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable. THE BABY IS

DEAD. She looks at it. She takes it up in her arms. Kisses

its forehead.

Makes a strange stifling noise. Inman doesn't look at her.

She comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate,

serves it up to Inman, gently touching him as she does so.

Then serves out food for herself. Inman starts to eat.

Inman nods. She collects up the knapsacks, including Inman's,

and goes back inside the house with them. Inman squats,

eating, glancing back towards the cabin. There's the sudden

shocking report of a revolver.

Inman, knowing what it is, goes slowly towards the house and

its two dead bodies. His own face is a rictus, the eyes thin

slits. If he gave into his grief it would never cease.

INT. SARA'S CABIN. DUSK

From the house, the silhouette of Inman working outside in

the day's dying light, snow falling around him. He's digging

a grave.

Inside the house, TWO BUNDLES, the small body wrapped in a

blanket, the other wrapped in the bed's patchwork quilt.

EXT. CABBAGE PATCH, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

Still snowing. Ruby trudges past Ada who is digging out a

couple of heads of the buried cabbages.

She walks past. Ada stares into the distance where

EXT. WILD COUNTRY. LAST LIGHT

-- the snow falls down on Inman. He's hardly visible in its

gusting waves. Just a thin black question mark, hunched over

the elements, moving slowly forwards...

EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

THE SNOW HAS STOPPED. It's left a carpet on the ground.

Stobrod, Pangle and Georgia emerge from the Old Mill. THEY

MAKE HEAVY FOOTPRINTS as they set off up the hill towards

the mountain.

EXT. PATH IN THE MOUNTAINS. DAY

Inman comes sliding down a crumbling slate hill and onto the

path. He cornea to a place where the path suddenly drops

away to reveal a view of the geography. And there, finally,

in the distance, Inman can see the blue ridge. Somewhere in

there is home, is Ada. He goes on.

EXT. SLOPES OF COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

Pangle walks too close to Stobrod and steps on the back of

his boot which promptly detaches itself from Stobrod's foot.

Stobrod turns -- and with a raised finger -- pushes Pangle.

PANGLE FALLS IN THE SNOW, ARMS SPREADEAGLED, AND SMILES.

EXT. PIGEON RIVER BEHIND THE OLD MILL. DAY

SOME HORSES CLUSTER around the Stobrod party's footprints.

Bosie swings acrobatically over his horse, to hang over the

tracks, then up again into his saddle, looks at Teague. The

Home Guard plod slowly forward in the direction of the tracks.

EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

A CLEARING, fringed by poplars. Stobrod is making a fire.

Pangle appears with an armful of firewood, his big grin a

fixture. Then Georgia appears. He's carrying A SMALL BUCK,

frozen and covered with snow.

EXT. SLOPES OF COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

Teague examines the snow's imprinted silhouette of Pangle.

EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

STOBROD SINGS AND COOKS. PANGLE ACCOMPANIES HIM ON BANJO,

Georgia joins in the chorus. Stobrod pulls one of the hickory

stick skewers out of the fire, blows on the, meat, smells,

smells again, looks at Georgia, takes a bite. Chews.

Pangle takes another stick, burns his fingers.

EXT. THE KILLING GROUND. COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

The three men are asleep. The fire still burning. They're

lying like petals of a flower around it. Suddenly Georgia

sits bolt upright, grimaces, gets up stumbles away from the

fire, toward a stand of trees, from which come the vivid

sounds of violent nausea.

EXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

GEORGIA IS KNEELING IN THE SNOW, his head in the snow, when

he A HALF DOZEN RIDERS TROT PAST approaching the sleeping

Stobrod and Pangle. Georgia has to vomit again.

EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

Teague rides up to the fire, the other riders with him --

Mo, Jo, Bosie, Grayling. Stobrod wakes, sits up, Pangle

sleeps.

Teague slides off his horse, approaches the fire.

EXT. TREES NEAR KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

Georgia squints through the trees. Doesn't know what to do.

EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

Pangle surfaces, blinks, grins at everybody.

In the trees, Georgia ducks, retches.

EXT. TREES NEAR KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

Georgia watches as the music starts, Stobrod playing and

singing, Pangle joining in at the chorus. Their improvising

is wild, profound, Stobrod chording the fiddle, Pangle

following him, then, finishing with another verse and ending

with the title declaimed by Stobrod.

EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

Something like compassion has flickered over Teague's face.

Mo and Jo nod to the music's secret rhythms. Only Bosie seems

detached, contemplating his long fingernail. The music

finishes. The Home Guard applaud.

Stobrod gets up, carrying his fiddle, heads over to a big

old poplar. Nods at Pangle.

Pangle gets up, banjo in his hand. Puts his arm around Stobrod

as if they were about to be photographed. The Home Guard

gather around them. From the trees Georgia watches, helpless.

Pangle grins at Teague.

PANGLE TALES OFF HIS HAT, HOLDS IT OVER HIS FACE. THE MOMENT

HE OBLIGIES, TEAGUE'S CARBINE SPRINGS UP IN HIS HAND AND

BLOWS THE HAT AWAY SEVERAL OTHER SHOTS FOLLOW. STOBROD FALLS

UNDER PANGLE, THE BULLETS FLYING.

EXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

Georgia lies prostrate in the snow, shuddering under the

report of each bullet.

EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ruby working in the snow, in the field, clipping a sheep's

feet, the animal on its back between Ruby's knees. She looks

up to see GEORGIA RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD TOWARDS HER,

calling out her name. From the kitchen window, Ada looks on

as he reaches Ruby, the story pouring from him. Ada emerges

from the house, walks towards the bad news.

INT. STOREROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

Ruby sorting out a kit of shovels, blankets. Ada comes in

doesn't know how to help her friend, who shows no emotion.

Ada moves towards her, puts her arms around her. Ruby is

rigid. Ada stops embracing her.

She's tying up the kit. She doesn't know how to grieve.

EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

THE SNOW IS FALLING HEAVILY. RUBY AND ADA TRUDGE UP THE

MOUNTAIN, dressed in Monroe's clothes, hats pulled down,

leading the horse, which is loaded up with tools and supplies.

A choice of paths. They start up one, then Ruby decides

against it, consults the map, and they reverse, pulling the

horse back and then yanking it up the other path.

EXT. PI STRUCTURE, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

Ruby and Ada have made a fire. They sleep under a stone

structure, which forms a natural pi shape, the fire in the

entrance, the snow caught in its light.

EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

Ada and Ruby arrive at the scene of murder.

Pangle is keeled over at the old Poplar, snow covering him.

Only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him.

Ada brushes some of the snow from his face, revealing the

death wound, then lays a hand in blessing on his head.

Ada fishes out Pangle's banjo from the snow. It's broken and

the strings hang slack.

LATER -- and RUBY FINISHES OFF THE GRAVE, hammering in a

stone to mark the place. Ada walks away towards the creek,

to wash her hands. She bends and rinses her face.

As she looks up SHE SEES STOBROD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

CREEK; half-in, half out of the water, slumped against a

tree, blood everywhere, staining the crust of snow which

covers him.

Ruby arrives at Ada, looks to where she's looking, walks

straight into the creek, all her love contained in the urgency

with which she hurtles to her father, oblivious to the

freezing water. She puts a head to his chest, seeks out a

pulse at his wrist. Calls back to Ada.

EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. AFTERNOON

A mean fire burns by the creek. RUBY TURNS A KNIFE IN THE

FLAMES. Stobrod's back is exposed. Just by the shoulder blade

is an ugly grey and purple bulge the size of a crabapple.

Ruby turns to Ada, who is helping.

She cuts the skin and prises out a slug which she drops in

the snow and rolls around to clean. Stobrod doesn't move. He

could be dead. Ada loads the pan with snow.

Ada puts the snow-packed pan on the fire.

EXT. BY THE OUTLIER'S CAVE, COLD MOUNTAIN. AFTERNOON

Squirrels frolic. Teague sits on the trunk of a fallen tree.

He feeds the squirrels, looking straight ahead where the

mouth of a cave winks back at him.

EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. AFTERNOON

THE TWO WOMEN EMERGE FROM A STEEP TUNNEL OF TREES IN A

CHESTNUT GROVE. There's a stream and, up on the bank, A

CLUSTER OF BLACK CONICAL HUTS, made up of chestnut logs,

abandoned and slightly sinister looking. They approach one

of the huts, its door long lost. The snow has drifted in. A

second hut has a door which they pry open. It's dark and

cold, but apparently still weatherproof. They get Stobrod

off the horse and carry him inside, then come out again to

unload the horse of its remaining load.

Ruby picks up the blankets and provisions and goes back inside

to her father. Ada takes the horse to another hut and, despite

his great reluctance, pushes him inside.

Ada wouldn't even recognize this practical, hardy woman she's

become. Stringy and of few words. She sets off towards the

tree tunnel, passing Stobrod's hut.

EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. DUSK

Inman approaches the Killing Ground. He studies the ground,

finds Pangle's grave. Blood has left its black writing in

the snow and he finds first where Stobrod has been, where

the bullet had been removed, then the journey away, still

tiny, telltale spatters of blood, and the hoof prints and

boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse. He puts his

hand into the ashes of Ruby's fire, can't feel any warmth.

It's getting dark. He takes a drink from the stream, shudders

at the cold.

INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

The fire burns, a pall of smoke. Stobrod lies on the ground,

swathed in blankets. Coughs. Ruby sits next to him, wipes

the hair from his forehead. Ada opens her eyes, looks, closes

them, listens to the fire, a strange squeaking as it burns.

EXT. TRACK, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAWN

First light. The sun creeps up, a red streak of dawn. Inman

walking, his head bent to the tracks. He walks quickly, even

as the terrain gets more steep. As he bends to the snow --

where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print -- A FLAKE

OF SNOW LANDS ON HIS HAND. Then a second. He looks up. The

snow falls.

He starts to move more quickly, racing the snow as it seeks

to erase the tracks. The snow thickens.

EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

In the Chestnut Grovel A DOZEN WILD TURKEYS pick their way

across the snow. A shotgun lines up its sight at one of them.

The trigger is squeezed. An explosion of feathers.

EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

Inman hears the shot. Then a second, the sound ricocheting

around him. He can't quite identify its source but he runs

again, heading for the Chestnut trees he can see above him.

EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

Ada collects the two turkeys, the first creatures she's ever

shot. Doesn't quite know how to hold them. She straightens

up and sees, at the other end of the tree tunnel, backlit by

the morning sun, THE SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. She drops the

turkeys tires to reload the shotgun.

Inman comes down the tunnel, approaching the hunter he sees

through the snow at the other end of it.

Inman is bewildered by this woman's voice in a man's outfit,

keeps walking, peering through the snow. Ada fires a warning

shot. Inman, still some distance, suddenly understands.

After all this time, all this way, Inman could give up the

ghost.

He turns, walks heavily away from her. Then he turns again,

completely lost, without compass.

He nods. They don't know how to speak to each other, just

stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in

their throats. Eventually --

And with that, she starts to sob, and sob.

VERY HIGH ANGLE: Inman walks towards Ada. They embrace.

INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

Ada enters, Inman behind her. Ruby looks up from Stobrod.

Ruby digests this. Considers this ghost of a man.

EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY

Ada comes out of Stobrod's hut, a glimpse of Inman sleeping

on the floor, heads for another hut which Ruby is sweeping

out. The snow has stopped. Ada stands in the door, watches

Ruby. Ruby's resistance to Inman is palpable.

INT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

THE FIRE BURNS. Ada lies awake. Ruby sleeping. Ada gets up,

steps out into the snow, her blanket around her.

EXT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

Inman is outside his cabin. Only the light escaping from the

cabin, fire lights them, almost silhouettes.

Ruby stomps out of the hut.

She's at the door to Stobrod's hut. She contemplates them.

And with that she enters Stobrod's hut, slamming the door.

A long pause.

INT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

Ada puts logs onto the fire. After a few moments a knock.

Inman enters. They don't know the rules for this.

Ada laughs, unsettling Inman.

And they kiss, tentative, then more urgent.

She stands holding her clothes in front of her to cover

herself. He takes them from her, drops them to the floor.

EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

A crisp, cold beautiful morning. They're packing up, all

their clothes in layers. Inman prepares the horse. Ruby and

Ada carrying bundles out of the huts. Inman approaches Ruby.

Ruby gives a curt nod, goes over to Stobrod's hut. Inman

gets close to Ada.

She puts her hand to his mouth which creases into a smile.

INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY

Ruby is wrapping a fragile Stobrod for the journey.

He coughs for a long time.

EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

And then the two women are off, little men in their outfits,

tramping off in the snow. Inman watches.

EXT. TRACK NEAR THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

Ruby and Ada walk.

Ruby elbows her.

Ada elbows her back.

EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

Inman has roped Stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a

steep slope. Behind him, their hooves muffled by the snow, A

GROUP OF RIDERS JOIN THE TRAIL, IN SLOW BUT STEADY PURSUIT.

Inman walks on, apparently oblivious to who's behind him. He

and Stobrod are some distance from broken ground, a fringe

of trees.

Inman opens his coat. Stobrod looks at the Lemats. They're

at the edge of the trees.

Stobrod looks round. Inman doesn't. Teague has some new bodies

in his entourage but they're all dead. A SPARE HORSE HAS

THREE CORPSES HUNG OVER IT, ANOTHER HORSE DRAGS A MAKESHIFT

LITTER WITH A COUPLE MORE, SOUVENIRS OF THEIR CAVE VISIT.

Teague waves.

His riders begin, quite casually, to fan out.

IN ONE MOVEMENT, INMAN SLAPS THE FLANK OF THE HORSE. WHICH

CAREERS DOWN THE TRACK, THEN TURNS AND FIRES, TWICE, BEFORE

PITCHING HIMSELF INTO A ROLL TOWARDS THE TREES. HIS FIRST

SHOT KNOCKS JO FROM HIS HORSE, THE SECOND MO, WHO FALLS INTO

THE SNOW, BLEEDING FROM THE GROIN AND SCREAMING. The riderless

horse gets tangled up with the others.

Inman is in the trees, shots around him. He doesn't move

away from, but towards the riders inside the line of trees.

Grayling charges him, riding into the trees. INMAN SHOOTS

HIM, THEN RUSHES FROM THE TREES, FIRING, MISSING BOSIE, WHO

RIDES AWAY, EVIDENTLY NOT RELISHING THE FIGHT, AND THROWS

HIMSELF AT TEAGUE, WHOSE HORSE IS BUCKING WILDLY. Teague's

carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. Inman yanks

the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the

shotgun barrel of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol

almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. TEAGUE'S CHEST

OPENS OUT AS HE'S THROWN OFF THE HORSE. Mo is still screaming.

Inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to

Teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow

under him.

Inman studies him, picks up the Spencer carbine, turns to

look where Bosie has gone, steps up onto Teague's horse,

reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate Teague,

LEANS OVER AND SHOOTS HIM DEAD. He turns the horse in the

direction Bosie had headed. He can't see horse or rider, but

in the stand of Hickory Trees ahead, THE GUSTS OF STEAMING

BREATH betray them both. He rides slowly towards the stand

of trees.

EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

Ada and Ruby walking. They hear the shots. Ada turns and

starts to run through the snow, her hat flying from her head.

EXT. STAND OF HICKORY TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

Inman's horse is parallel to Bosie, who is deep inside the

trees but also riding, slowly. It's like a dance.

And in that second HE PRODUCES HIS GUN AND FIRES. INMAN HAS

ALREADY FIRED THE LEMATS AND THE BOY, SHOT IN THE HEAD, FALLS.

CAUGHT BY ONE STIRRUP THE HORSE BOLTING. INMAN WATCHES, STOCK

STILL, THEN MAKES A COUGH, AS IF CLEARING HIS THROAT, AND A

THIN MIST OF BLOOD SPRAYS FROM HIS MOUTH.

EXT. RIDGE, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

Ada and Ruby running. THEY REACH STOBROD, HIS HORSE STOPPED,

DRINKING FROM THE CREEK. Stobrod, barely conscious, hanging

halfway down its flank, held on by the ropes.

Ada hurries on, taking the shotgun from Ruby, who tends to

her father.

EXT. A GROVE OF TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

Ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses. She hardly

stops to look at the bodies, just rushes on.

THE GROUND SIMPLIFIES AND SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM OF A GROVE. A

STEEP INCLINE, THE SUN LOW AND IN FRONT OF HER. SHE SEES A

BRILLIANT FRAME OF BLACK TREES, AND THEN A SUDDEN FLURRY OF

ANGRY CROWS FLYING TOWARDS HER. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL IS A

SMALL HIEROGLYPH OF A MAN.

FINALLY, THE IMAGE FROM THE SWANGER WELL EXACTLY AS SHE FIRST

SAW IT.

THE FIGURE RAISES A HAND, BRIEFLY, THEN PITCHES FORWARD INTO

THE SNOW.

She runs, her heart broken, towards the body of Inman. He's

dead, the red flag of his life ebbed, away in the snow. Ada

falls to her knees and pulls him over, the snow crusted on

his face, which she wipes away with great tenderness, then

sits, his head in her lap, as Ruby slowly comes up the hill

towards them.

A VIOLIN PLAYS, quite raucous.

INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM, EASTER. DAY

A GIRL, about five or six, with Ada's curls, sits at the

table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled

bottle she offers it. She tries again. Ada comes in suddenly,

takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out.

The girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field.

EXT. FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

THE SOUND OF THE FIDDLE CONTINUING, JOINED BY A BANJO, It's

a glorious spring morning, Black Cove Farm at its most

luxuriant, the path edged with brilliant flowers. There are

more animals in evidence. The girl emerges from the house

and sees Ada in the field, surrounded by sheep. She hurries

over.

ADA IS EXPERTLY SKINNING A STILLBORN LAMB. The little girl

is horrified.

She has the skin off the lamb, which lies like a little pink

cat on the ground. She approaches Grace, takes the live lamb

from her arms, the girl resistant, frightened.

She takes the skin and wraps it round Grace's lamb. Then

puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lamb's

mother.

It goes to the sheep and, after a few false starts, starts

to feed, accepted as a surrogate.

And A VOICE joins in with the fiddle and banjo.

EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

STOBROD is playing, on his repaired fiddle. His hair is now

completely grey. GEORGIA is playing the banjo and singing,

although. A SMALL CHILD with Georgia's reddish coloring keeps

invading his picking hand trying to join in. RUBY HAS ANOTHER

GEORGIA CHILD IN HER ARMS, but is also trying to serve food.

She passes Georgia and touches the top of his head. SALLY

SWANGER is pouring water from a jug, Ada emerges from the

kitchen, with a big pie, racing to the table.

From behind her, Grace appears, carrying a jug of milk, puts

it on the groaning board of the table. Grace has a full plate

in front of her, picks up a fork to spear some meat.

The music stops. And there's quiet except for the sound of

animals: lowing, barking, braying, bleating.

And they eat.
