you said, "Don't say anything, but

Dad lost his job and he's

bookmaking."

to him? He has the wrong idea.

anything else.

Because you have a restraining

What good are you, man?

Why did you have this overwhelming

urgency to see your wedding video

last night?

Oh, I don't know, because I'm

married and I haven't seen my wife

in eight and a half months?

Maybe you think that Nikki's not

around and Tiffany's an attractive

girl and if you get drawn towards

Tiffany, you will spoil your

chances of getting Nikki back to

you?

Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't

think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki

because Tiffany's a slut.

Why is she a slut?

After the dinner at Ronnie's, she

said, quote, "We can go to the back

house and you can fuck me as long

as we turn the lights out."

Unquote. And she still wears her

wedding ring. So she's a loyal,

married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

Maybe she just needs a friend and

she thought if she offers you sex,

it will be easier for you to become

friends with her.

She said she's not a whore anymore,

but she likes that part of herself

along with all the other parts of

herself and can I say the same?

Can you?

on thin ice with my family, you

should hear how I lost my job.

How did you lose your job?

By...having sex with everybody in

the office.

I was very depressed after Tommy

died. It was a lot of people.

Really?

Yes.

What was that like?

Hot.

Jesus Christ. Was it like...older

women, a sexy teacher who wants to

Made me sit on her lap and do

things? Yeah.

What? You sat on her lap?

Mm-hmm.

She told you what to do?

Mm-hmm.

Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I

talked like this. Made me feel like

such a pervert. Maybe we should

change the subject.

I don't mind it.

You don't, do you.

No. But then people were getting

into fights in the parking lot at

work, and in the bathroom...and the

boss called me in to his office and

tried to pin it all on me. So I

accused him of harassment and then

they fired me, sent me home and put

me on some meds.

PAT BEGINS TO SLIDE OUT OF THE BOOTH.

Can I at least finish my tea?

Wait, what?

My tea. Can I finish it?

Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell

Nikki about our dinner? Why would

she do that? Was it a test?

I kinda got that feeling, yeah.

Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a

test. How did I do? I think I did

pretty well.

Yeah, she said you were cool,

basically.

"Basically"? Was I some percentage

not cool?

No, she said you were cool, but you

know.

No, I don't know.

Sort of how you are. It's fine,

relax.

What do you mean? How am I? What

does that mean?

Sort of like me.

I do.

sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't

want to wake you, but I needed an

Be nice. It's game day! I'm makin'

He's very happy.

I'm happy.

No, you're so up, up, up, up.

Isn't that a good thing?

You're just up, up, up. I don't

know what that is. Are you taking

the proper dosage of your

medication?

Am I taking the right dose? Of

course I am.

Okay. Taking a little bit too many

or something?

No, if I was taking that, I'd be on

the floor, Dad.

Just stay with us. Stay for the

game. Spend some family time.

Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to

go.

TIFFANY WALKS TO PAT.

Yes.

I told you I was gonna split my

time with my dad and you, and my

dad was pulling me in one

direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie--

Well, that sounds great, Pat.

That's great for all of them, but

all of them didn't make a

commitment to me in return for my

help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.

What is this craziness with Tiffany

Maxwell?

There's no craziness. I told you

who she was, I was doing this thing

with her. We had a conversation!

She's fucking nuts! When you

started spending time with her, it

all fell apart. This is the fucking

reason right here.

You think I fucked up the Eagles'

juju, don't you?

Ever since, ever since he was with

you, ever since--

You think that I'm why today's

happened?

That's right, you are why today

happened.

I'm the reason why today happened?

I think so.

Let's talk about that.

Be my guest.

The first night that Pat and I met

at my sister's, the Eagles beat the

Forty Niners handily, forty to

twenty-six. The second time we got

together we went for a run and the

Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to

five in the NLCS.

She's right, Dad.

The next time we went for a run the

Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-

seven to fourteen.

Wow.

The third time we got together we

had Raisin Bran in the diner and

the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in

the fourth game of the World

Series, ten to two.

Oh, wow.

Let me think about that. Wait a

minute.

Well, why don't you think about

when the Eagles beat the Seahawks,

fourteen to seven.

He was with you?

He was with me. We went for a run.

Really? That's crazy.

SHE SNAPS OFF A BEER BOTTLE CAP AND DRINKS.

Oh, now you like her, Dad?

I have to say I do. Yup.

Patrizio, I feel terrible, you

know? You made the bet, I won a lot

of money, and now look, your whole

family is in turmoil.

Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it.

You live for this shit. You've been

betting against my father for

years.

Is that right?

You're twisting the knife right

now. You get off on it!

That's bullshit! That's not true!

Don't say that!

You get off on it! If not, then

prove it. Prove it.

Yeah, prove it, prove it!

How do you want me to prove it?

How's he gonna prove it?

By giving them the chance to win

back everything, double or nothing.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Double or nothing on the Bengals,

next week? Is that what you're

saying?

No.

She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy.

EVERYONE GASPS.

I believe in the Eagles, I believe

in my son, I'll take the action.

I'll take it.

Dad!

Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!

I have faith, I have faith.

Excelsior belongs in this house--

--not in the State of New York. In

this house.

Dad, listen to me. I didn't know

that "Excelsior" was the state

motto of New York, okay?

I didn't know, either, but now I

know.

I know, but listen to me, this is

toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is

toxic, you shouldn't be doing this,

you shouldn't be doing--

Randy, what do you say-- (to Pat)

Be quiet, shut up. You already did

enough. (to Randy) Randy, what do

you say? My birds, Benjamin

Franklin's team favored by one and

a half points. I'll give you three

more.

Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't

you take the bet!

In fact, I'll give you ten points.

No, Dad! Dad!

Dad!

You have to take that bet on the

Cowboys.

Dolores, would you stop him?

Jesus!

How could you not take that bet?

Even with the ten points I give

you, that's an insane spread to

your advantage. Cowboys are

cowards. And I'll bet you're such a

coward, you won't take the ten.

Plus, are you listening, plus

whatever their score is at the

dance thing. (to Tiffany) What's

that? Tiffany, what's that?

What? No, no, no, no.

You're crazy to give away that many

points. That's ridiculous! I won't

take that! However, wait a second.

I do like the idea of a parlay.

What? No parlay! No!

No, don't do it. Don't do it.

Pat, how do they run this dance

competition? I mean, how do they

score it and everything?

I don't know, I don't know how they

fucking score! We're participating.

We're not, we're not a part of it.

There are people, this is a high-

end dance contest. I don't know. Do

not put it as part of the parlay,

Randy. Don't--

Pause. Tiffany says nothing.

We can do a five.

What are you talking about, Dad?

You haven't even seen us dance!

That's the parlay.

Will somebody please explain to me

the parlay? Please?

You gotta win two bets or you lose

the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to

win, the birds gotta beat the

Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta

get at least a five at the dance.

That's very, very manic indeed.

That's the parlay.

Shake on it.

You know what? I'm not gonna be a

part of this. (to Randy) Randy,

Randy, you're a sickness. You're a

fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.

Pat, you can't quit.

I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.

Pat, calm down. Thank about it.
