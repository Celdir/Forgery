FADE IN:

EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT

Mist. Dark trees.     Dripping vines.        An ENGINE RUMBLES in the

distance.

The full moon shimmers on a puddle.          A FROG SPLATS IN,

splashing a one man pup tent.

INSIDE THE TENT

LUKE's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen

asleep reading by flashlight. He's nineteen, still slightly

awkward and unaware he's growing handsome.

He listens as the ENGINE RUMBLES LOUDER, closer.

He peers out through the tent flap. Glaring head lamps ROAR

toward him. Scrambling out of his sleeping bag, he HURLS

himself against the side of the tent, as...

OUTSIDE

an RV CAMPER nearly plows down the tent, skidding to a stop

in the mud.

Stillness.

Luke extricates himself from the tent.          He runs to the driver-

side window of the RV.

Inside, ALEXA, thirties, earthy, looks up at him bleary-eyed.

She nods 'yes.'

He nods 'yes.'    She bursts into TEARS.

She gathers herself, sniffling.

INSIDE RV CAMPER

Luke stands at the RV's tiny kitchen counter, wolfing pastry

off a paper plate.

Luke notices an odd pile of stuff by the sink.

She smiles, grateful, eyeing his torn t-shirt and shorts.

He considers, fearful, but thrilled.

EXT. LANGFORD UNIVERSITY - MORNING

Students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle.

The huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old

SEMI-TRUCK RUMBLES up to the curb. It's the cab only, like

the sliced-off front of a train engine.

Luke hops down, startling his friends, KEENAN and JANINE,

passionately making out on the sidewalk.

Twenty, brainy and athletic, Janine adjusts her glasses, the

only remnant of a bookish past, as she thoughtfully considers

Luke's massive truck.

Hoping for a more enthusiastic response, he turns to Keenan,

who climbs up and peeks inside the cab. He's rugged,

streetwise, perpetually bemused, -maybe Ed Norton and Bill

Murray had a son...

Janine stares at him.

She shrugs, trying to put her finger on it, and when Luke

rolls up his T-shirt sleeves, she grins.

Luke glares at Keenan.

Janine sneers.    At a loss, Keenan grabs her and kisses her

passionately.

She walks off rolling her eyes, but secretly loves it.

Keenan climbs up into the cab.

Keenan looks around with fresh eyes. He reaches an arm way

up under the glove box and GRINS, pulling out a small stash

of weed.

EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY

The truck barrels along through the trees.     Luke and Keenan

share a joint.

Keenan looks over warily, then busts out LAUGHING, then

realizes Luke's serious.

They both LAUGH.

INT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - DAY

A small, run-down service garage, crammed with tires, tools

and discarded car parts.

Luke's truck idles in the service bay, billowing smoke.

MAX, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder-length hair

and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag.

Dripping with masculinity, he swaggers around the truck,

chewing gum, wielding a pneumatic torque-wrench, which he

occasionally REVS for emphasis.

Max considers, sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and

SIGHS.

Max disappears through a squeaky door at the back.

Luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender.

He sits, impatient for Max to return.

He examines Max's cap, tries it on. He picks up the torque-

wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner

of Max.

He spins around and REVS the wrench, catching sight of

MICHELLE, twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and T-

shirt, with warm, confident eyes.

Luke swallows, wide-eyed, a deer in headlights.   He sets

down the torque-wrench.

Luke stares, awkward.

An SUV pulls up at the gas pump, stuffed with Keenan and

OTHER GUYS. CHAD, exuding supreme self-confidence, calls

over to Luke as he pumps gas.

Luke's BREATHING grows HEAVIER.

Michelle smiles, and walks out through the squeaky door at

the back. Keenan approaches.

Luke sits, nods 'yes,' wipes BEADS of SWEAT from his brow.

Keenan gives him a high-five.    Luke smiles, catching his

breath.

INT. LUKE & KEENAN'S PLACE

A small, run-down house. Hockey gear, dirty laundry and

Keenan are strewn across the garage-sale sofa. He munches a

burrito while watching the game.

Keenan leaps up.

He races down the hall, sliding on the linoleum.

BATHROOM

Luke, a towel around his waist, stares at himself in the

mirror, horrified.

Keenan looks, clueless, a little uncomfortable now.

Keenan takes a bite of the burrito in his hand, now mashed.

Keenan gives him a look of "I'm crazy?"

EXT. CAFE LUNIZIA - NIGHT

Cheap elegance. Luke and Michelle dine on the patio, strung

with far too many white lights.

She kicks off her shoe and sticks her bare foot on the table,

a TATTOO of a GREEN BIRD on her ankle.

She smiles.

They sip from their glasses and drink each other in.

Luke contemplates a kiss,...

but his breathing grows shallow, he GASPS.

His face REDDENS. Overheated, Luke tugs at his shirt,

brushes SWEAT from his brow.

Luke puts his hand on his chest, FEELS something.

He stands, puts on his jacket.

NEAR THE KITCHEN

HYPER-VENTILATING, his arms CLUTCHING HIS CHEST,

BEADS OF SWEAT on his forehead,

Luke checks the Men's Room door: LOCKED.

He ducks out the service entrance.

EXT. PARKING LOT

By the dumpster, Luke reaches behind his head, WHIPS off his

jacket and shirt, and looks down...

His eyes GO WIDE.

On his chest: FEMALE BREASTS.

Two WAITERS come outside for a smoke.

Luke peers over the dumpster, down at his breasts, with a

HIGH FEVER, and PASSES OUT, slumping to the ground.

BEHIND THE DUMPSTER - LATE NIGHT

Luke's eyes open, dilated, disoriented. He's lying on the

ground, shirtless among bits of garbage.

He watches bleary-eyed, as a MOUSE peers at him from inside

an empty milk carton. The mouse runs over and sniffs at a

canteloupe, which triggers Luke's memory:

He GRABS his chest, relieved to find it's back to normal.

He stands, dizzy, surveying the dark, locked restaurant, and

staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck.

EXT. WOODED HIGHWAY - LATE NIGHT

Luke's Semi THUNDERS along.

INSIDE THE CAB

Luke stares out in shock.

He hears HEAVY BREATHING, MOANS, VOICES.

He looks around for the source of the sounds, glances over.

RIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR

in it's reflection a leering male, stripped to the waist.

The HEAD LAMPS of an oncoming car FLASH at him.

As he glances out the driver-side window, MUSIC BLARES from

the passing car.

INSIDE THE CAR

A glimpse of what might be an ORGY of BODIES intertwined.

The FEMALE DRIVER - GRINS MANIACALLY UP at Luke as the CAR

HORN SCREAMS by.

Luke CAREENS to one side, glancing at the truck's

LEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR

The car recedes in the distance, but the Female Driver

appears CLOSE in the mirror's reflection, LEERING. She LICKS

THE MIRROR from the inside, and disappears.

THROUGH THE TRUCK WINDSHIELD

Luke stares out, EYES GLAZED.

INT. KEENAN AND LUKE'S GARAGE

The decrepit old garage looks as if it may collapse any

second. Barbells on the floor. Luke dodges and weaves,

slugging a makeshift punching bag.

Keenan appears, wiping sleep from his eyes.

Keenan recoils at the attitude.

Luke punches the bag, harder and faster, a near SEIZURE: ROAD

RAGE.

He collapses in a heap.

Luke considers.

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING

Luke hops down from the truck cab, fixes his shirt and hair,

trying to look nonchalant as he rings the doorbell.

Hearing something behind him, he turns as Max PUNCHES him in

the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.

Luke GASPS for air.

Max shoves him across the yard.

Max sneers, skeptical.

They face off.

Caught off guard, a smile escapes Max.

Luke nods 'yes.'

Luke nods, appreciative.

EXT. MUDDY WATERS' MINI-MART - NIGHT

A tanker truck QUAKES past. Surrounded by fir trees, the

eerily empty mini-mart glows with fluorescent junk food.

INSIDE MINI-MART

Luke stands behind the cash register, leafing through "The

Outdoors Man."

The CHIME BINGS and SYDNEY enters, early thirties, elegant in

thrift-store chic. She's cool and in control, ...at least on

the outside.

She surveys random candy bars, stealing glances at Luke.

Disappointed, she checks her reflection in the freezer door.

She SNIPS his hair.    Luke pulls away.

She CHUCKLES, lays money on the counter.

As she leaves, she takes a provocative bite of the popsicle.

EXT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DUSK

Acres of yellowing corn surround a dilapidated farmhouse

converted into a pool hall. The windows glow from warm

lights inside.

Parked along the gravel driveway are pickup trucks, cars, and

Luke's Semi.

INSIDE POOL HALL

Smoke, ROWDY MUSIC and the CLACK of cue balls.

Keenan and Luke snake their way through the pool tables.

Keenan looks over at Sydney, finishing off a bourbon.

RENTAL COUNTER

Janine and Michelle check out a rack of billiard balls from

the worldly British owner, POLLY.

She runs the place like a wild west saloon, with such ease

and confidence, it suggests there may be a shotgun under the

bar.

Polly moves off.

Janine whispers in her ear.

Michelle's jaw drops open, scandalized.

They LAUGH.

AT THE BAR

Luke hands his keys to JEREMY, the handsome bartender, in

exchange for a full pitcher of beer.

Sydney saunters up.

Sydney glances around, talks quietly.

Luke pales.

Luke gives Keenan the evil eye.

The little remaining color in Luke's face now drains away.

He shakes his head 'no.'

Luke moves off, sloshing beer.     Sydney sighs.

POOL TABLE

Janine and Michelle select pool cues.

Michelle LAUGHS.

Luke rejoins them with the pitcher of beer, glancing back

toward the bar. Keenan comes too, with a look of concern.

Keenan steals glances at Luke, trying to sort it all out.

Luke nods.

AT THE BAR

Sydney sits at a bar stool, keeping an eye on Luke and

Michelle. Jeremy lays out a cocktail napkin, speaks with a

slight Texas drawl.

POOL TABLE - LATER

Now alone with Michelle, Luke lines up his cue stick, then

catches Michelle's admiring eyes.

She smiles, glances over at Keenan and Janine, making out by

the jukebox.

Luke peers over the corner pocket, and watches Michelle shoot

and sink the ball.

Luke sneers, not his favorite compliment.

He smiles.

They LAUGH.

The electricity between them charges the air.

Luke maneuvers himself closer.

Luke takes his shot,...

and KISSES HER.

The ball ricochets off the back, across the table, and sinks

in the pocket at the side.

AT THE BAR

Jeremy looks on, aroused.        Sydney squints, dismayed, barely

able to watch.

POOL TABLE

Keenan and Janine rejoin Luke and Michelle, all four elated.

Luke racks up the balls as Michelle lines up the cue.

Before Keenan has lifted the wooden triangle rack,

Michelle HAMMERS the cue ball.

It CRACKS off the rack,

ROCKETS off the table,...

and CANNONBALLS Luke in the CROTCH.

Keenan, Michelle, and Janine ALL GASP.

They CRINGE, poised, waiting for Luke to react.

Luke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the

table.

He sees them watching him.

Surprised, they return to the game.

Michelle lines up the cue ball again, as Luke considers,...

with a slow-dawning realization that something, somehow, just

isn't right.

He casually touches his hand to his pants.

He pales slightly.

He looks to Keenan for help.

AT THE BAR

Sydney watches as Keenan and Luke cross the hall toward the

back.

She flags Jeremy.

OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM

Luke tries the men's room door, locked.

Keenan opens another door that leads them into a store room.

Luke follows, with a look of concern.

INSIDE STORE ROOM

Luke unzips and gently digs in his trousers.

He looks down, SHUDDERS,...

Luke's face CONTORTS, terrified.

Luke shakes his head "no," points toward his crotch, GASPS,

barely able to make a sound...

Keenan gives him a look, repelled, perplexed...

then takes a look,...

His EYES GET HUGE.

Sydney BURSTS in with the bottle of bourbon.

Luke, slack-jawed, keeps checking himself.   Each time the

horror of it grows more intense.

Sydney uncaps the bourbon and drops capsules in from a

prescription bottle.

He and Sydney have to yell to hear over Luke's escalating

MANTRA...

Sydney GRABS Keenan, SHOVES him against the wall.

Keenan nods that 'yes, he is.'     Sydney releases him.

Luke's eyes glaze over...

He weaves, losing his balance...

Sydney helps Luke FLOP DOWN on the floor.    He passes out.

Keenan approaches Luke, then steps back.

Keenan grabs the bourbon-Darvon concoction from Sydney, wipes

the rim of the bottle just in case, then takes a big swig.

INT. SYDNEY'S BED & BREAKFAST - LATE NIGHT

On a corner table sits high-tech laboratory equipment.

Keenan and Luke gulp beers, still in shock.   Luke keeps one

hand down his pants for reassurance.

Keenan looks over at Luke...

Luke glares at him.

Luke and Keenan swallow, wide-eyed at the prospect.

Sydney calms herself down.

Sydney wearily sips a highball. She looks to Keenan for

help. Keenan flashes the international sign for jacking off.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAWN

A deserted, hilltop cemetery. Luke sits on the manicured

lawn, across from a gravestone with vestigial images of

brightly colored smiley-faces and fish.

He bounces a soccer ball against the headstone.

Luke paces nervously.

He glances at a burial ceremony, half-mile away.

A hushed voice...

EXT. LUMBER MILL

Keenan and Luke spar on roller blades, hockey sticks in hand.

Luke WHACKS the hockey puck with such intensity, it may land

on Mars.

Luke glares at him.

Michelle and Janine ride up on their bikes.

Luke smiles, his face REDDENS.

Luke smiles, nods, followed by a look of PANIC.

He ducks away.

Janine gives him a look of "What the hell are you talkin'

about?"

Keenan stares back, PLEADING.

Janine relents, despite herself.

BEHIND STACKS OF LUMBER

Luke leans against the logs, wipes sweat from his brow, and

realizes...

SOMETHING'S HAPPENING AGAIN.

Panicked, he grabs his crotch, feels it,

Everything's normal.

Or is it?

He frantically unbuttons his shirt and peers inside,...

He slumps back against the logs,

WAVES OF RELIEF.

INT. LUKE'S HOUSE - DAY

Luke storms through the house, trying to evade Janine, who

enthusiastically follows. Keenan traipses after.

Realizing she just handed him the perfect straight line...

Luke goes in the bedroom, SLAMS the door.

Keenan and Janine take up residence outside.

Janine tries to peek through the keyhole, beneath the door.

LATER

Janine keeps an ear held close against the door.

Keenan and Janine exchange a worried look.

INSIDE THE BEDROOM

Now approaching the mirror, in awe, ...gently raising a hand

to touch the exquisite FEMALE FACE reflected there, stands a

real female, an absolutely FEMALE LUKE.

OUTSIDE THE DOOR

Janine knocks.

The door opens, revealing Female Luke, wrapped in a sheet.

Keenan clutches Janine.

They STARE, AT A TOTAL LOSS, INCREDULOUS...

Female Luke speaks, with an unmistakably female voice.

Female Luke hesitates.

Female Luke shyly parts the sheet, revealing her stunning

naked torso.

Female Luke checks herself out in the mirror.

Keenan and Janine sit on the edge of the bed, in shock.

Keenan, afraid to answer, looks to Janine.

They both have the same reaction...

Keenan keeps his distance from Luke, embarrassed, if turned

on.

Keenan looks at her shocked.

Keenan's speechless.

Female Luke can't stop gazing at herself in the mirror.

Janine rolls her eyes, as she and Keenan back out of the

room, their eyes locked on her amazing body.

OUTSIDE BEDROOM - LATER

Janine and Keenan are sprawled on the nearby couch.

Luca opens the door.

Janine and Female Luke both roll their eyes.       Female Luke

swings the door shut.

The DOORBELL CHIMES.

FRONT DOOR

Janine throws it open, Max stands outside.

Female Luke comes out of the bedroom, wrapped in a sheet.

She stops in her tracks, stares at Max.

Max stares back, intrigued.

Female Luke nods 'okay.'

Janine, Keenan, and Female Luke are momentarily speechless.

Keenan and Luca GLARE at Janine.

Max gazes at Luca, spellbound.

Luca wraps herself more tightly in the sheet.

His eyes fixed on Luca, he smiles.

Max gets fluid, scanning the room for a toehold, infatuated

by Luca. He seizes on a hockey stick.

Janine ushers Max out the door and shuts it on him.

Luca ducks into the bedroom, shuts the door.

INSIDE BEDROOM

Luca at the window, peers out between the curtains, watching,

as Max walks away.

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

As Max gets to the end of the driveway, he stops and turns

back, sporting a charming smile.

INSIDE THE BEDROOM

Luca jumps away from the window, smacking into Janine.

Luca just stares back at her, nonplussed.

OUTSIDE BEDROOM

Janine emerges from the bedroom to join Keenan.    He looks up

at her, questioning.

OUTSIDE BEDROOM DOOR - LATER

Keenan and Janine sprawled out, leaning against the door,

half-eaten pizza between them on the floor, WEARY.

BUZZING emanates from inside the bedroom.

Keenan and Janine PERK UP.

Keenan finds this particularly unsettling.

Keenan gives her the evil eye.

Inside the bedroom, the BUZZING STOPS.

OUTSIDE DOOR

Keenan grabs the last bottle from his six-pack.

Keenan flips the TV remote, disturbed.

INSIDE THE BEDROOM

Luca sits on the edge of the bed, frustrated.

Luca considers, she goes over to the window, peers out

momentarily, then draws back.

OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM

Janine lies down on the floor.

Spread eagle, eyes closed, she fantasizes, as she directs...

Keenan glances over, taken aback at her tone...

Keenan watches, getting turned on...

Keenan lunges for Janine.

They're kissing, ROLLING AROUND TOGETHER now,...

They roll on the floor, clothes torn...

Keenan and Janine RECOIL.

Whether agony or ecstasy, it's a frightening sound.

The door opens.

Luke stands in his shorts, ALL MALE.

EXT. LANGFORD STATUARY SUPPLY - NIGHT

Sydney makes her way through a barbed-wire fence, past a "No

Trespassing" sign. A lone DOG HOWLS in the distance.

Life-size replicas of Greek Gods, Venus and David, all face

one way in the mist. Their cold stone bodies press up

against each other; nude, indifferent.

A figure peers out between the statues in a long black coat,

a baseball cap over his eyes: Luke.

Sydney smiles, nods in agreement.

Good.

You need to use this incredible

opportunity you've been given, to

figure out which you're supposed to

be: male or female.

What?

Don't you see? You get to choose.

I don't want to choose.   I want to

be a guy.

Yes, well, the thing is, sometimes

your desires can conflict with your

desires. It's important to know

for sure.

Believe me, I know.

I think you need to try again.

No way!

Why're you so resistant? If the

truth is, you want to be a guy,

great, but if not...

Don't even say that!

Well, clearly some part of you

feels differently. You couldn't

change if you didn't want to.

What?!    That's crap!

Sydney moves to leave.

Sydney turns to leave.

EXT. LUMBER MILL - DAY

Bikes and SUV's outside the shut down mill.    Abandoned timber

surrounds an asphalt clearing.

Luke, Keenan, Chad, Jeremy, and OTHER GUYS in the midst of a

friendly, if brutal roller hockey game.

Luke glances over and spots Max high up on a pile of logs,

cheering them on.

Jeremy passes the puck off to Luke who drives it MANIACALLY

to score the winning GOAL.

The Guys CHEER.

AFTER THE GAME

The guys gather up their belongings near the cars.

Luke sits on the running board of his truck, unlacing his

skates.

Max comes over.

Luke grunts, a smile.

Luke SHOVES Max, who SHOVES him right back.

Luke lunges for him.

They go at it, wrestling FIERCELY.

Max gets the upper hand, and pins Luke down to the ground.

Luke surges with RAGE, breaks free. Grit teeth, ripped

clothes, they roll on top of each other, two rabid pitbulls.

Keenan and the Other Guys rush in, pulling them apart.

Luke breaks free of the guys, and moves off.

INT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DAWN

Sydney stands at the bar with a cup of coffee, chatting with

Jeremy.

Jeremy smiles, unsure what she means. When Polly approaches,

her eyes a little red, Jeremy pulls her aside.

She puts a hand to his cheek, reassuring.    Jeremy ducks

behind the bar.

Keenan and Janine enter.

Janine glances to Keenan, as his eyes GO WIDE, grossed out.

Janine and Sydney exchange a knowing look.

Janine nods.

Sydney pulls out a SNAPSHOT, shows it to Janine.

She and Keenan keep staring at the photo...

Janine nods, grasping the significance.

Keenan keeps looking from the photo to Sydney and back again.

EXT. CAMPUS - OUTSIDE DORM

Luke sits, waiting on the steps of a campus dormitory.

Janine approaches, grinning, carrying a box tied with a bow.

Keenan trails behind, straddling his bike.

Janine hands him the box.

Keenan sneers, cringes.

Luke opens it, pulls out a BLUE DRESS.

Luke HURLS the box out to the curb.    Keenan gives him a

thumbs up!

Janine walks over to pick up the box.

Janine storms off with the box.

Keenan picks up his bike, gets on.

Keenan GRINS, rides off.

UP THE WALKWAY

Luke passes a sidewalk trash can and notices the gift box

mangled inside.

Glancing around to make sure no one's watching, he pulls the

dress out, brushes off some dirt.

He shoves it back in the trash, stares at it.

INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT

Luke kneels on the floor, stocking candy shelves.

The CHIME BINGS.

He peers over the aisle, looks around, no one in sight.

Michelle appears by the soda dispenser, wary of him.

As they talk, Michelle maneuvers to get closer.

Luke maneuvers to keep his distance.

They gaze at each other across the magazine rack,

a mountain range of silence between them,...

They stand silent, beneath the hum of fluorescent lights.

Luke's surprised and embarrassed by his own words.

Michelle steps away, confused.

She exits.

MINI-MART - LATER

Luke kneels in the aisle, stocking shelves, distracted,

fidgety, distressed.

He glances up at the magazine rack. A Female Fitness

magazine catches his attention. The BEAUTIFUL COVER model

seems to MOVE.

He stares at it: no movement.

Luke approaches the rack, and flips over the magazine cover.

As he steps away, he glances back at the rack,

CELEBRITY MAGAZINE COVER

The ADONIS on the cover comes to life. He rips off his shirt

as he moves off one magazine cover and into another, where he

passionately kisses the BIKINI-CLAD COVER MODEL.

MAGAZINE RACK

THE MODELS AND OTHERS on half a dozen covers begin stripping

down, moving to other magazines and making out with each

other all across the rack.

OUTSIDE THE MINI-MART

The windows glow among the dark trees.

Inside, Luke rips up covers, HURLING magazine after magazine

across the floor.

INTERCUT WITH:

INSIDE BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

Michelle leans against the shower wall, staring at the spray

of water, upset.

Steam rises, filling the bathroom.

She begins SINGING, longingly,...

Washing herself,

behind the shower curtain,

the timbre of her singing voice mysteriously shifts.

As her hand turns the shower faucet, it changes...

A glimpse of her shoulder behind the shower curtain, grows

more muscular,

and her voice begins LOWERING IN PITCH,...

as MICHELLE BECOMES MAX.

Max steps out of the shower, and towels off in the mirror.

INT. ORLANDO'S BED & BREAKFAST - NIGHT

A persistent KNOCK on the door. Sydney pulls on a robe over

a pair of men's boxers, wiping sleep from her eyes. She

swings the door open.

Luke stands outside in POURING RAIN.

BY THE FIREPLACE

Sydney pours hot tea.

Luke nods sadly.

EXT CEMETERY - MORNING

Morning dew. Acres of empty grass.   Luke sits at the top of

a hill by his dad's grave.

He stares up at the sky.

He tugs out hunks of grass.

A tear rims his eye.

INT. ORLANDO'S BED & BREAKFAST - DAY

Department store shopping bags and boxes are strewn across

the bed.

Sydney checks herself out in the full-length mirror.   A man's

gray tuxedo jacket over lingerie.

INT. LUMBER MILL - DAY

The giant work floor of the abandoned mill.   Sunlight beams

through holes in the roof.

Max, on roller blades, practices guiding the hockey puck

along the floor.

He stops when he notices the figure watching him from outside

the giant metal doors:

Luca in the blue dress, on roller blades, hockey stick in

hand.

LATER

Luca demonstrates hockey technique, expertly guiding a hockey

puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment, timber,

and sawdust piles.

All the while, she dodges Max's attempts to steal the puck.

Max finally gets it, which riles Luca. She hip checks Max.

They swerve to avoid a pipe, crash-landing on top of each

other on a sawdust pile.

They bust out LAUGHING.

Luca pulls away from Max, suddenly self-conscious that Max's

leg is on top of hers.

Awkward from the broken connection, they gaze up at the blue

sky through a hole in the roof.

Max leans over and KISSES Luca.   She responds, tentatively at

first,

then as she grows more confident,...

her face REDDENS, she GASPS.

Luca pulls back, self-conscious, confused.    She brushes

sawdust off her dress, stands.

Looking up, Luca sees Keenan, staring at them from across the

floor, incredulous.

Keenan exits out through the giant doors.

Max stands, brushes off the sawdust.

Max skates off across the giant shop floor.

EXT. LUMBER MILL - DUSK

The Semi Truck is parked alone in the middle of the asphalt.

From inside the cab, the blue dress flips over the rolled

down window.

ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

Keenan leans against a tractor, rolls his eyes, and twists

open another beer, which he gulps.

AT THE TRUCK

Luke hops down from the truck cab wearing Langford U. sweats

and a T-shirt.

Keenan sits on the running board.

Keenan downs his beer, pensive.   He crushes the can and hurls

it, SMACKING a garbage can.

Suddenly uncomfortable sitting so close to Luke, Keenan

stands.

Keenan picks up his bike.

Keenan shrugs.

Keenan rides off, leaving Luke shell-shocked.

INT. SYDNEY'S BED & BREAKFAST - NIGHT

Sydney wears a stunning black silk evening gown.

Small Greek statues now adorn the room.

Sydney pops a cork and pours herself and Luke glasses of

champagne. A toast.

They drink.

AT THE BED

Luke and Sydney begin undressing.

Sydney takes this in, considers,...

Sydney, realizing her mistake, regroups: Plan B.

She retrieves some ROPE.

BEDSIDE TABLE - LATER

The alabaster eyes of a small Greek Statue stares blankly in

the direction of the CARNAL SOUNDS coming from the bed, OFF

SCREEN...

The chiseled eyes of a two-foot Statue of David, blankly

stare.

Luke's voice begins RISING IN PITCH...

The SOUNDS ESCALATE, growing increasingly more INTENSE,

culminating in the extraordinary, never before heard,

SOUND OF ZYTUSIONAL CLIMAX...

Silence.

MIRROR - LATER

A great-looking, bare-chested guy with Sydney's hair appears

in reflection: MALE SYDNEY.

Behind him, still strapped to the bed, is now Luca, a GAG in

her mouth.

Male Sydney carries a phone while fussing with his hair in

the mirror.

Luca MOANS, STRUGGLES VIOLENTLY!

Male Sydney clicks the phone off.

Male Sydney returns to dressing, a ribbed tank beneath a gray

Italian tux.

He gazes at Luca, a pang of guilt.   He sits on the bed,

speaks softly.

Luca stares, distraught.

The entire bed LURCHES back and forth as Luca struggles.

Male Sydney winces, pangs of guilt, which turn to anger...

LATER

Luca lies alone in the room, bound and gagged on the bed.

A KNOCK at the door.

Luca MOANS and tries to YELL through her gagged mouth.

The KNOCK PERSISTS.

SIDE WINDOW

The ivy parts and Keenan peers in.

His eyes GO WIDE.

He pushes the window open a little, whispers...

Luca MOANS and struggles against the ropes.

Keenan sits on the edge of the bed.

Luca MOANS trying to get Keenan to remove the gag.

Luca stops struggling, shocked.

Keenan climbs on top of Luca, starts untying her hands,

straddling her.

With Herculean effort, Keenan struggles to hold back tears...

EXT. WOODED HIGHWAY

The truck THUNDERS along through the trees, head lamps

BLAZING, dashboard lights bright.

Keenan's at the wheel.

Luca indicates 'no.'

EXT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - NIGHT

Students gather outside the farmhouse pool hall.

Male Sydney spots his prey, and approaches Jeremy, who hangs

out alone on the grass near a small bonfire.

The firelight licks their faces.

Jeremy LAUGHS, glances around, unsure what to make of him.

INSIDE THE SEMI

The truck CAREENS around a CURVE.

Luca considers...

They drive in silence.

Luca glares at him.   Keenan realizes his mistake...

The truck ROARS on.

EXT. POLLY WOG'S

As Janine looks on, Male Sydney moves in for the kill.

Sydney tugs at his T-shirt.

GRAVEL PARKING LOT

Keenan and Luca hop down from Luke's truck, scanning the

crowd.

Janine waves to Luca and points across the way.

Luca nods.

They stride across the field.

BEHIND THE BARN

Male Sydney shoves Jeremy passionately against the wall.

Keenan and Luca appear around the corner.

Keenan reaches them first.      He wrenches Male Sydney and

Jeremy apart.

Luca catches up and TACKLES Male Sydney, throttling him on

the ground.

They pull Male Sydney toward the barn door.

Jeremy moves off, wide-eyed and disturbed.

Male Sydney shakes his head 'no.'

Keenan's confused...

Keenan RECOILS.

Luca notices Michelle standing nearby.

Keenan and Luca realize that she's Luca right now, not Luke.

Michelle moves off.

ALONGSIDE THE BARN

Luca runs up.

Luca stares, stunned.

Michelle gestures "Oh really?!"

Michelle stares, incredulous.

She glances back, sad and angry.

Luca watches her go, distraught, and then RUNS...

ATOP A GRASSY HILLSIDE

Luca collapses on the ground, overlooking Polly Wog's.

Janine and Keenan run up, a few yards behind. They sit

nearby, catching their breath, unsure what to say.

Luca gazes up at the moon.

They all three gaze up at the moon.

Keenan steals a glance at Janine.

Janine glares at him, and Keenan winces.

Janine looks to Keenan with a look of remorse, hopeful...

They kiss.

They look to Luca surprised,...

then all three bust out LAUGHING.

Her own admission surprises her.

She almost laughs, sad, but relieved.

INT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - LATE NIGHT

The place is cleared out, save for Polly cleaning up behind

the bar and Max, alone, shooting pool.

Max shrugs.

Max nods, sets up a new rack.

She sinks the cue ball in a corner pocket.

Polly's confused, but presses on.

Max puts the cue stick down, and moves off.    Polly calls

after,...

EXT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

Max slides out from under an old car. Seeing Luca, he

hardens, wiping his greasy hands on a rag.

Max returns to his work.

Luca 'nods', not fully understanding Max's response.

Max walks toward the back, then YELPS, wincing.

Max sits on a crate, starts untying his boot.

Luca moves off, as Max removes his boot, and his sock.

Luca stares at Max, and then down at his ankle, at the TATTOO

OF A GREEN BIRD.

Max meets her eyes,

and it finally dawns on Luca,

standing, in shock, and now putting it all together,

she LUNGES for him, nailing him to the ground, kissing him.

She RIPS Max's T-shirt as they fall to the asphalt, knocking

over oil cans.

Passion.   Unbridled.

IN THE PARTS YARD

Luca manhandles Max, shoving him against a pile of huge

tires, as Max's face transforms...

BY OLD RADIATORS

Michelle slams back onto the crabgrass. She pulls Luca

toward her as Luca's face transforms into Luke.

BY DISCARDED TRUCK CHASSIS

Luke and Michelle roll on the crabgrass, kissing,

TRANSFORMING as they roll, into Luca and Max and Michelle and

Luke and Luca -or was that Max?

INT. MICHELLE'S BEDROOM - DAWN

White gauze curtains billow in the morning breeze. The sun's

first rays light up the down comforter and white pillows.

Michelle stirs slowly, then BOLTS AWAKE.       She grabs Luke, a

vise grip around his torso.

He awakens, groggy.

Michelle bites her lip, embarrassed, releases him.

He smiles.

She nuzzles him playfully.      Luke glances at the clock, MOANS.

He smiles, folds into her.

FADE OUT
