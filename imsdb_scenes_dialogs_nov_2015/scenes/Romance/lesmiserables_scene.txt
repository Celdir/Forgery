1    EXT. TOULON DOCK - DAY                                        1

The convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the

rope -

The camera RISES UP to find JAVERT, the officer in charge

of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed

and expressionless. He stands above the men on the top of

the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the

steep steps of the dock wall.

Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of

half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in

the mist.

FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is

almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.

With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the

damaged ship onto the slipway.

CRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust

of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean.

Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent

command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he

drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the

great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks

water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the

mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength.

Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the

chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm

is passing now, blown by the driving wind.

Javert approaches Jean Valjean.

He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper.

The Foreman has stopped beside FANTINE, a pretty young woman.

As he leans over to whisper in her ear Fantine, surprised,

pricks her finger with her needle.

The Foreman continues his rounds, encouraging the women to

speed up their work.

They get on with their tasks, all glancing up at the boss in

the office above.

The Foreman returns to Fantine, trying to help her.

The Foreman rings a bell, announcing the end of the work day.

The women start to take off their overalls and pack up their

tools for the day.

The women queue up to be paid by the Foreman at the door.

Fantine has taken out a letter. The main factory woman

snatches the letter away from Fantine.

The letter is passed surreptitiously down the line of women

workers.

The main factory woman starts to take Fantine's letter over

to the Foreman.

Fantine tries to get the letter back. The women scuffle.

The owner enters the factory floor. We see him only from

behind: a well-dressed prosperous man.

As he sings, the CAMERA MOVES ROUND to discover him. Clean-

shaven, well-fed, transformed: it's Valjean.

Suddenly Valjean sees Javert appear on the first floor

balcony of his office. His world drops away.

He walks back to the stairs up to his office.

On the factory floor -

The factory women all turn on Fantine.

Fantine continues to defend herself to the Foreman, as the

women sing -

The Foreman pulls Fantine away.

24   EXT. TRACK LEADING TO FACTORY, MONTREUIL - DAY               24

Javert stands back and looks on. As he looks, we see a

memory stirring in him.

JAVERT'S POV - Valjean's posture beneath the cart is

exactly the same as the convict beneath the fallen mast.

The same crouching power. The same almost-suicidal

determination.

Valjean sees Javert looking at him, and knows exactly what

he's thinking. For a moment he hesitates. Then he hears

Fauchelevent's choking scream as the mud gags his mouth.

Valjean strains every muscle, and slowly one end of the

cart begins to rise. As soon as it clears the crushed and

gasping man, the others pull him clear.

Valjean lets the cart down again, and climbs out. As he

brushes himself down he finds Javert staring at him.

He shakes his head, realising how absurd his suspicions

are.

Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more.

Javert is not yet confident enough to continue.

Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent.

Fauchelevent groans as he rises.

26   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                    26

A man with no legs, reacting to the sailors, cranks up an

organ-grinder and from doorways and overhead windows

harbour whores appear and tout for business.

A man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear

fragments of his sales pitch.

Lovely ladies                   Lovely dentures

During the above chorus, Fantine sells a locket containing a

cutting of Cosette's hair to the pawnbroker.

The pawnbroker goes back in his shop and Fantine watches the

whores.

The pawnbroker takes the locket in exchange for the money.

An old woman leers at Fantine from the shadows, beckoning.

She approaches Fantine, reaching out to stroke her hair.

The pimp gestures at Fantine, now slumped in a doorway, her

cropped head in her hands.

A shy captain watches Fantine. The pimp notices.

He moves in on Fantine.

Fantine looks up, a trickle of blood in one corner of her

mouth. The whores cluster round her, hands reaching out to

draw her in to their world. On the rotting warship, more

whores appear out of the gaps of the hull to sing the

chorus.

Whore 3 bites her fingertip and applies her blood to rouge

Fantine's cheeks.

The whores perform for the benefit of Fantine on the orders

of the head whore, as the head whore leads her towards the

hulk.

The pimp leads the captain down the middle of the whores to

Fantine who wears a filthy white dress. The pimp joins the

captain and Fantine's hands as the head whore officiates -

like a twisted wedding ceremony.

He pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down

her cleavage. Fantine reacts with fury. They fall over in the

snow and Bamatabois laughs.

Fantine scratches Bamatabois across the face. Bamatabois

touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers. His

friends drag Fantine against the harbour wall.

Bamatabois suddenly sees that police have arrived.

Bamatabois' friend drags Fantine towards the police. It's

Javert.

He shows the blood. Javert turns to Fantine.

Fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with

occasional spasms of coughing. Unseen by her, Valjean is

approaching from behind. Javert's assistants pick Fantine

up. Javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he

approaches Fantine.

Javert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away.

Valjean steps out of the shadows.

Javert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches

out a hand to Fantine. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to

her in a dream -

He holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face.

Valjean enters, and sees at once that Fantine is close to

the end. He drops to his knees by her bed.

She pushes into his hand a scrap of paper on which she's

written her wishes.

Fantine has stopped looking towards the window. All her

fading strength is now directed towards Valjean. She tries

to reach up to him.

He wraps her in his arms.

Fantine starts to spasm. She sees something over Valjean's

shoulder. Valjean doesn't realise. Her eyes go glassy as

she passes away. Valjean then hears the unforgettable voice

of Javert behind him.

Valjean stands to face Javert.

Javert draws his sword and aims it at Valjean.

Valjean breaks a section of timber beam from the roof.

The men start to circle each other.

They sing at the same time, duelling in song.

The two men fight.

Javert disarms Valjean and drives him backwards towards an

attic door.

Valjean is pushed through the doors out onto a wooden

loading platform beneath a hoist. Below, the walls of the

factory lead straight down to the black sea at high tide.

Javert is triumphant.

Valjean glances down and pushes back, dropping into the

darkness of the ocean.

Javert goes to jump after him and cannot bring himself to do

it.

Cosette goes to put the broom away.

Eponine comes in from outside.

Madame Thenardier sees that Cosette far from going is

hiding behind the far wall. We see Cosette's frightened

eyes peering out from a tiny gap in this wall.

Madame Thenardier imitates Cosette as she sings.

The innkeeper's gang posing as customers who have been

loitering outside come in, explaining to a fifth man who is a

newer recruit a story from Monsieur Thenardier's past. Madame

Thenardier goes outside to open up the rather pathetic frost

fair stall on the porch of the inn.

He goes closer to the windows of the building. Through the

blurry glass he can make out a chapel, and a line of nuns

singing.

Valjean continues and sees a man filling in a new grave.

The man starts as he sees Valjean.

Valjean jumps, takes Cosette protectively into his arms.

Turns to answer.

It's Fauchelevent, now a gardener, still limping from his

injury.

Valjean gazes at him, and remembers.

Valjean and Cosette follow him to the convent.

The fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert

their eyes, or raise the blinds of their carriage windows

to shut out the sight of the losers of their world.

Gavroche, bounding over their heads, evading the swipes of

liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one

particularly grand carriage and begs/taunts the RICH

OCCUPANT.

STILL RUNNING WITH Gavroche as he hops onto the back of

another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at

last, hitching a ride on the back - one or two of his gang

hop on back of carriage with him, the others run panting

after to hear his political lecture.

53   EXT. LAMARQUE'S HOUSE, PARIS - DAY                         53

Marius looks towards Lamarque's house behind him.

Mounted Police ride in to break up the crowd.

The crowd breaks up. The students shout to the crowd:

As Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier she

recognizes him.

Thenardier pulls off his disguise. Valjean recognises him.

He signals to his gang. A door opens in the alleyway

revealing the huge Brujon. The gang move in on Valjean

menacingly.

The gang spill out into the street to find themselves

confronted by Javert now with his men. Marius watches, as

does Gavroche, drawn by the rumpus.

He sees man with his arm protectively round a girl but does

not recognize Valjean as Valjean has averted his face.

He turns back on the Thenardier gang in the passage.

He turns back to find Valjean and Cosette gone.

Marius, equally baffled, goes off in search of them.

Thenardier, listening, hears this all with great interest.

So Valjean is a crook like him.

Gavroche is sitting on a horse trough and falls back into it

when Javert surprises him.

He is furious. He sings to Javert's departing back, and to

Marius who is close by.

She turns back to find Marius gazing down the street.

Joly turns goes over to Marius at the back, a faraway look

on his face.

They sit.

They burst into laughter. But Enjolras isn't smiling.

A scuffle at the door - Gavroche struggling with the

barman. Courfeyrac lets him through.

Enjolras turns to his companions.

66   EXT. RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                                       66

Cosette sees Marius. She comes up the garden path towards

him. She sees Eponine by Marius's side.

Cosette holds the wrought-ironwork of the gate with both

hands, eyes on Marius. Eponine looks on and suffers. Marius

wraps his hands round Cosette's.

Valjean comes to the door.

Cosette turns and runs in to the house.

Valjean walks down the overgrown garden path to the gate.

Marius moves quickly away, instinctively nervous of

discovery, and hides behind the wall.

Valjean peers into the shadows. He senses that perhaps

Cosette has been talking to someone. He looks pensive.

Valjean returns inside.

Cosette has dropped a keepsake through the gate. Marius picks

it up.

Marius makes his way back down the street, filled with

thoughts of his love. Completely forgetting Eponine is there.

Shadows move up the street from the other direction. It's

Thenardier and his gang. They gather at the wrought-iron

gate.

Brujon starts working on the gate lock. He finds Eponine

lurking in the shadows.

Police and national guardsmen control the growing crowds.

Now into view come the leaders of a great FUNERAL

PROCESSION. An entire battalion of infantry, marching with

weapons reversed. A column of black-suited dignitaries

carrying branches of laurel. A division of Cavalry rides in

front, behind a section of military drummers who drum a

military tatoo.

INTO FRAME comes a team of black horses stepping slowly,

black plumes nodding, drawing behind them a gun carriage

draped in the tricolour flag. On the carriage stands a

COFFIN.

Softly, in time with the drums, the watching people begin

to sing.

The police and guardsmen look round to see who is singing

so subversively, but they can't be sure where it's coming

from. The singing grows stronger.

The dignitaries become aware of the singing, and glance

uneasily from side to side.

As the coffin on its carriage draws level with the students,

Enjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses drawing

the carriage and waves the red flag, stopping the horses and

the procession.

The students break the ranks of the crowd and surround the

coffin carriage.

Enjolras, Marius and Courfeyrac and other students climb

onto the top of the carriage as the horses and led by

Combeferre.

The crowd supports them and surround the coffin carriage,

blocking the attempts of the police to intervene, singing

with passion.

Enjolras, the students, and the impassioned crowd have now

become the procession. They turn off the main street away

from the expected course of the funeral procession.

Gavroche's elephant looms over this side street. Gavroche

and his gang jump down from the elephant to join in.

As the procession turns off, the calvary division gallop

ahead and disappear round a corner.

86   EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE/INT. CAFE MUSAIN - DAY             86

They pull up paving stones, rip boards, timbers and front

doors from house and shop-fronts, pull down buttresses, and

raid the Cafe Musain, systematically stripping it of every

item of furniture despite the lamentations and

protestations of Madame Hucheloup and her barmaid.

As the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor

of the cafe the rifles and ammunition they've gathered, to

prepare to defend their chosen ground. A student stands on

a stone post distributing weapons. They line the first and

second floor front rooms with paving stones to create

protected shooting positions. The inside of the barricade

is built neatly with steps up made from paving stones. The

outside is a crazy knarled mess.

A man in worker's clothing is helping build the growing

barricade,. He wears the insignia of the rebels, and keeps

his head down.

The man who's just arrived looks up. It's Javert.

He slips away through the barricade, which is still rising.

87    EXT. BARRICADE - DUSK                                      87

87A   EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT                                     87A

Javert, still in his disguise as a rebel, is let back

through the guarded `gate' into the barricaded street.

They all look up. There's Gavroche, on the top of the

barricade.

Guns swing round to aim at Javert. He stares back in

defiance.

Gavroche comes dancing down the barricade to Courfeyrac's

delighted embrace.

Gavroche grabs Grantaire's red cap and puts it on his own

head, mimicking the students.

Enjolras faces Javert.

Javert is led into the cafe. As they pass through the front

door only one student is holding Javert. Seizing his

opportunity, Javert breaks free and the students have to

subdue him by force. Javert is on his knees and is being tied

to the staircase.

Silence.

Suddenly, out of the darkness, the students and citizens at

the barricade here an ominous distant sound. The sound of

marching feet, hundreds of men, marching in unison. First

soft, then building louder and louder, closer and closer.

Boots on cobbles. The sound comes right into the end of the

street.

Enjolras and all the students man the main barricade.

Silence.

They peer over the barricade. In the pitch blackness, all

they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers. These

are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection

from the torch.

A voice shouts out from the darkness.

At the same time we hear the clatter of guns being levelled.

A flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as

though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut.

A dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. The red flag

falls, the pole sliced through. Bullets richochet off the

cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound

several men.

In the darkness, the clang of ramrods in muskets - the troop

reloading weapons.

Enjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up

when the old man Father Mabeuf who has seen many

insurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the

top of the barricade.

A second volley.

Father Mabeuf falls down dead. While everyone is reacting to

the dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from

noticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of

darkness to creep down the street.

All at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins. Shouts and the

rattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over

the barricade. The students run for their guns and return

fire. They are taken by surprise. All could be lost in the

first instant. Some soldiers make it up to the top of the

barricade, where they're driven back by the fierce

resistance of the defenders. Eponine sees one soldier

aiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of

Marius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe.

They are being   overrun. Panic ensues. The gun battle is

fierce. Marius   in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost

unless they do   something. He drags a barrel of gunpowder to

the top of the   barricade, grabs the torch and with a face of

deadly resolve   he tips the torch towards the barrel.

Everyone freezes.

Marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg.

But already the soldiers have cleared out.

Marius comes down from the barricade.

As everyone surrounds Marius in amazement he spots Eponine

lying propped against the barricade.

He kneels by her side. Eponine is dying.

With a struggle she pulls the letter out of her pocket, and

pushes it into his hand.

Marius is shocked to find blood pouring from her wound.

Rain begins to fall.

Marius tries to comfort Eponine in his arms.

He points to Javert, in a dark corner, his hands tied.

Javert looks up and meets Valjean's eyes. A steady shared

look.

Suddenly Valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the

roofs to gain an angle of attack on them. They are aiming at

Enjolras. Swiftly Valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them

sending them scattering. Quickly other students join in and

the snipers are driven back.

There is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a

brief fire fight ensues.

The snipers have disappeared.

Enjolras turns to Valjean.

Javert hears this with grim satisfaction.

He turns to his little army.

Valjean takes Javert out the back of the Cafe Musain. He

carries a knife.

Valjean uses the knife to cut Javert free.

He raises his gun and points it at Javert.

As Javert goes, he raises the gun barrel and fires a single

shot into the air.

Marius is manically working to raise the height of one of the

smaller barricades.

Grantaire drunkenly starts singing a drinking song and it is

taken up more seriously by Feuilly. Bottles are passed round.

96   EXT. BARRICADE - DAWN                                      96

Gavroche is already climbing the barricade under cover of

the smoke.

The rays of the rising sun break through, lighting up

Gavroche.

Crack! A musket shot. Gavroche falls face down onto the

barricade.

He runs up the barricade, seizes Gavroche's body in his

arms, convulsed with grief, and brings it back through the

gate in the barricade.

At the other end of the street Javert has appeared. He sees

this gate. And talks to the Army Officer.

As the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed

drawing field artillery into position. The Army Officer is

lining up the big guns carefully.

Enjolras gazes on his pitifully small group.

The sun now appears above the rooftops of the city.

And the big guns fire - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it. In its wake

a massive barrage of musket fire.

The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst

right through in the first hit.

Bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball

smashes into the piled debris. Javert is glimpsed among the

attackers.

Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the

barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles

down to others to be re-loaded, firing again.

Valjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting

down the dead, regardless of his own safety.

Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs

towards him -

CRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade

and now the soldiers are storming through. The hard core of

student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Cafe

Musain.

A figure coming closer. A sewer thief, robbing corpses. No

sign of life in either Valjean or Marius.

Now we see the thief is Thenardier. He finds a ring on

Marius's finger and pulls it off.

Valjean wakes, rears up, seizes Thenardier by the arm,

slams him against the sewer wall.

Valjean drops him, picks Marius up once more, and sets off.

Thenardier stares after them, grinning. He's sent then the

wrong way.

LATER - Valjean in the sewers, Marius on his back, and

they're sinking ever deeper into the slimy water.

105   EXT. RIVER EMBANKMENT, PARIS - NIGHT                          105

He starts to move past Javert.

Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head.

Valjean meets his eyes. That old battle of will against

will.

He starts walking past Javert. Javert's hand trembles as it

holds the pistol.

Valjean keeps walking. Javert wills himself to shoot, but

he just can't do it. Frustrated, enraged with himself, he

lowers the gun.

He turns away, trembling now all up and down his body. He

stares into the river. Valjean is gone now. He's alone.

He begins to move away along the embankment, up steps,

towards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the

turmoil in his brain.

He moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. Here he

stands, looking down at the dark water of the night river.

The Seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents

swirl round the piles of the bridge.

He climbs up onto the parapet, reaching his arms up to the

night sky.

He's prepared himself to make this confession, but it's

Marius hears this with shock.

Marius can't conceal that he's disturbed by this

revelation.

He holds out a letter for her.

Cosette takes the letter and kisses it.

Valjean turns back, face shining, towards the table where

the candles burn in the silver candlesticks. There he sees

three ghosts waiting for him. The ghost of the Bishop. The

ghost of Fantine. And beyond her, watching Marius with

love, the ghost of Eponine.

Fantine comes towards him, reaching out her hands.

117   EXT. PLACE DE LA BASTILLE - DAY                             117

As THE CAMERA RISES we see we're in the Place de la

Bastille. The triumphal column has long been completed, but

the great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become

incorporated into an immense barricade - three stories

high, seven hundred feet long. Down all the streets that

converge on the square we now see the multiple victory

marches approaching. They cheer and beat drums as they

climb up to the top of the barricade.

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTIONS:

There in the forefront of one column march Marius and

Cosette.

As the marchers come nearer we begin to realise how many

there are: thousand upon thousand. And there marching among

them we see ghosts from the past - Enjolras and the

students who died - and Fantine - and Eponine -

And out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost: the

grinning face of Gavroche. He climbs out to dance on the

elephant, as the crowd fill the square.

As the marchers converge, there watching them are

Thenardier and his wife. Thenardier gives the marchers a

wave of greeting. Survivors to the last.

Now among the marchers we see the ghost of Valjean, singing

with the rest atop the barricade, amongst the waving red

flags.
