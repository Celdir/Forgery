FADE IN ON:

CYBERSPACE

We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a

sky that's just beginning to get light.  There are a few

stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big

computer sun starts to rise.

We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading

over a computer version of the New York City skyline.  We

move over Central Park.  It's fall and the leaves are

glorious reds and yellows.

We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down

Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and

Hold in front of a New York brownstone.

At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the

words:

ADDING ART

As the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a percentage

increase from 0% to 100%.  When it hits 100% the image pops and

we are in real life.

EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - DAY

Early morning in New York. A couple of runners pass on their

way to Riverside Drive Park.

We go through the brownstone window into:

INT. KATHLEEN KELLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

KATHLEEN KELLY is asleep.  Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and

fresh as a spring day.  Her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized

bed and a desk with a computer on it.  Bookshelves line every

inch of wall space and overflow with books.  Framed on the

children's classic.  Madeleine.

As Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into

the room.  He wears blue jeans and a workshirt.  He's carrying

the New York Times.

Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the

bathroom, and we stay with Frank.

Kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe.

She tosses him his jacket.

INT. LIVING ROOM - KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

As Frank walks to the apartment door.  We see a charming room

with a couch, fireplace, books, and a dining table with a

typewriter with a cover on it.

Frank goes out the door.  It closes.

Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye

peephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing

from sight.  She walks into:

INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

And looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the

street and turns toward Broadway.

He's gone.  Good.

She sits down at her computer.  An expression of anticipation

and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse.

INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's

code name: Shopgirl.  She logs on and the computer makes all

its little modem noises as the computer dials the access

number and connects and we hear the machine:

And we see Kathleen, listening for the words she's waiting to

hear:

And Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up:

INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

We see a list of letters:

Big Cash Op: You can make $$$ in your spare time.  OIL MKT: You

can turn $20 into $20,000 THIS REALLY WORKS U CAN DO IT:

Maximize your selling ability nowwwww!!!  NY152 Brinkley

Kathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters --

all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.

Then she selects the "Read Mail" key for "NY 152 Brinkley".

And the letter comes up:

Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud:

And now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of

NY 152, a man named JOE FOX --

INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

A dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. This

is BRINKLEY.  The pillow has "Brinkley" embroidered on it.

Brinkley's master, JOE FOX, a great-looking guy, full of

charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself

some orange juice.  He's half-dressed.

Joe's girlfriend PATRICIA EDEN, in Armani head to toe, comes

into the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine,

which starts grinding beans.  She's carrying the morning

papers.

Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.

She tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her.

Hold on Joe, listening as he hears the elevator door open and

close on the landing outside.

IT. JOE'S DEN - DAY

As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs

on.

And as he starts to read his letter, we hear:

INT. JOE'S ELEVATOR - DAY

As Joe, dressed for work, takes the elevator down with his

elevator man CHARLIE.  There's a certain amount of Good

morning, etc., as the elevator goes down and the voice-over

continues:

EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - DAY

As Joe comes out of his building.

And the camera now pans from 152 Riverside uptown to:

EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - MORNING

EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

As Kathleen comes onto Broadway at the corner of 83rd Street

and starts downtown.

Through a long lens we can see Joe, walking into blocks behind

her.

As Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the

West Side of Manhattan in the morning.  Mothers and fathers

taking their kids to school, people on their way to work,

dogs being walked.  School buses picking up kids, bakery

trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of

unopened restaurants.

Kathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the

newsstand dealer, and picks up a New York Times.

Metal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons,

the pharmacy, fish store, the Cuban Chinese Restaurant,

Zabar's.

Joe stops at the same newsstand.  He buys all the papers --

the Times, Wall Street Journal, Post and Daily News.

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

As Kathleen picks up her coffee, walks out.

EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

As Kathleen walks down Columbus, we see Joe a block behind

her.  She stops to buy flowers and Joe passes her, crosses to

the Ease side of Columbus Avenue.

EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

A building under construction, with plywood board covering

the front and wrapping around the corner.  Joe goes to a side

entrance and enters.

EXT. COLUMBUS & 73RD STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS

As Kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in

front of her store, a children's bookstore called "The Shop

Around the Corner."  It is an irresistibly inviting store.

There are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large

stuffed animals reading children's books: Madeleine, Good

Night Moon, Where the Wild Things Are.  A teddy bear in a

pinafore is reading The Stupids Step Out.  Waiting for

Kathleen in front is one of her employees, CHRISTINA.

Christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first

time.

Kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which

rises, making a horrible noise.  Two cabs almost collide in

front of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts

yelling obscenities at the other.  Kathleen unlocks the door

to the store.

Christina looks at her puzzled.

INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

Kathleen turns the CLOSED sign on the door over to read

"OPEN" and she activates the computer system.  She looks

around, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore,

with wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read,

some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions

of the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland, etc.  There's a

playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered

with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "The Ten Best

Witch List"  and a collection of witch books -- "The Lion, The

Witch and the Wardrobe," "The Witches," "The Wizard of Oz."

On the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops.

Kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and

suddenly stops to daydream.  A smile creeps onto her face.

Christina looks at her.

A beat.

GEORGE PAPPAS, in his twenties, one of Kathleen's

salespeople, is a cute guy who has no idea that he's supposed

to look in the mirror when he gets dressed.

BIRDIE walks in.  She is in her seventies, has white hair,

and is tiny, like a little sparrow.  She is the store's

oldest employee, having worked there for over forty years,

and serves as a accountant as well as salesperson.

We hear the bell jingle as TWO WEST SIDE MOTHERS come in with

two KIDS IN STROLLERS.

We hear the sound of the garbage truck.  Kathleen goes out

the front door to:

EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

As the commercial garbage truck pulls up and TWO GARBAGEMEN

start to load her trash.

Kathleen is standing there, tongue-tied.

grandfather, SCHUYLER FOX.  The office has been recently

redecorated; everything is new and a little overdone.

Nelson, Shuyler, and Joe high-five each other.

As a DECORATOR walks into the office carrying a pile of

upholstered pillows, and Joe turns to look at them.

INT. SUBWAY - DAY

Kathleen looks up from her book as a butterfly flies through

the subway car.

The train comes to a stop.  The butterfly flies out.

A flour truck is unloading flour into a hole in the ground.

INT. JOE'S KITCHEN - DAY

As Joe reads a copy of Pride and Prejudice.  He can't stand

it.

INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

As Kathleen takes a copy of Homer Price off the shelf.

She opens it to the illustration of the doughnut machine that

doughnut machine as the doughnuts roll down the chute just as

regular as a clock can tick.

We can hear the sounds of Starbucks: "Short decaf cap,"  "Tall

mocha latte."  "Grande lowfat regular."  Etc.

EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - A HALF HOUR LATER

The painter is further along on the sign.  It now reads:

COMING SOON, A FOXBOOKS SU --

Kathleen walks past the construction site.  She doesn't

really pay attention to the sign painter.

We see two police cars barreling up 75th Street, followed by

a television news truck.

EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

The police cars and TV truck barrel uptown.

EXT. 101st STREET - CONTINUOUS

They turn left onto West 101st and stop in front of an

apartment building on the block.  There are more police cars

and a horde of television reporters with microphones, etc.

George emerges from the building as a newscaster broadcasts.

As George comes out of his building into a horde of REPORTERS

with microphones, cameras, etc. and listens to the reporter,

who, seeing George, sticks the microphone into his face.

At that moment, George sees a young woman.  This is MEREDITH

CARTER.  He is struck dumb.

George hasn't heard a word.

George doesn't answer.

George continues to stare at the beautiful woman.  As he

does, she notices him.  She stares back.  The reporter,

ignored, finally turns away.

He continues to stand there, dumbstruck for a moment.

Meredith Carter starts to walk away.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

As George walks along Broadway, past the sign, which now

says: "COMING SOON: A FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE".  He sees it.

INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DUSK

Kathleen in the kitchen, unloading groceries.  Frank is

standing there, plugging in an Olympia Report deluxe Electric

typewriter.

He holds his arms out.  They hug.

He strikes a key.  Practically swoons.

He puts his ear to the typewriter.

Kathleen listens too.

She whips a cover off the other typewriter on the table.

It's the same machine exactly.

Kathleen nods.

Kathleen looks puzzled.

He sticks a piece of paper in the typewriter, starts typing.

He whips the piece of paper out of the typewriter and hands

it to her.

Clutching her piece of paper, she wanders into the bathroom.

INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

We hear the sound of a typewriter begin to clack away in the

next room.

Kathleen walks past her computer, looks at it.  Then she goes

over to the window, looks out at her street at dusk.

EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DUSK

A group of schoolgirls in uniform, in two straight lines,

walk past with a tall woman.

INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DUSK

She goes over to the bookshelf and pulls out a copy of

Madeleine by Ludwig Bemelmans and opens it to the

illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight lines

marching through the streets of Paris.  She looks at it, then

looks up, lost in thought.  We hear the sound of the computer

keys.

And hold on her as she thinks about this.

In the other room, we hear Frank typing.

Kathleen goes to the computer, turns it on.

EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

As we see Kathleen, through her curtains, a small figure

barely lit by her computer.

INT. DRIP - DAY

Drip is a cafe on Amsterdam Avenue with Fifties-style couches

Christina flips the book open to her application.

EXT. 19TH STREET BOAT BASIN - ANOTHER DAY

Joe is on his sailboat.  He is polishing his brass and

whistling.

Joe jumps off the boat onto the dock to greet his

grandfather's daughter ANNABEL, 8, who is coming toward the

fiance, her son, MATTHEW, 4, and the Nanny, MAUREEN.

Joe gives her a peck on the cheek.

EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY

There's a block street fair with little booths, sausage

sandwich concessions, etc.  Annabel and Matt have been to the

makeup booth.  Annabel is a cat and Matt is a pirate.

Annabel is carrying a goldfish in a baggie as they walk toward

Broadway.

EXT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

As Joe, Annabel and Matt walk past.  There's some sort of toy

miniature princess in a pointed hat sitting outside the store

Matt is sitting on the floor reading a book.  Kathleen is

showing Annabel a copy of a book called Betsy-Tacy.

In another section of the store:

Joe smiles and turns to see Kathleen and Annabel at a whole

shelf of Betsy-Tacy books.

As Joe approaches.

Annabel nods solemnly.

Annabel and Matt start giggling.

He smiles at Kathleen, who finds herself smiling back.

Annabel suddenly sneezes.

Kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve.  It's an old

fashioned hankie that's embroidered.  She offers it to

Annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then

looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled.

Joe is looking at Kathleen.

He gets the one Matt is reading.  And the two other Kathleen

has gotten for Annabel.

Returns to counter and gives Kathleen some cash.

He can't finish the sentence.  He looks at her and sees,

behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is

unmistakably Kathleen's mother, with a young Kathleen.

She smiles at Joe...

Annabel and Matt join him at the counter.  Kathleen gives them

each a lollipop.

INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

Someplace like the auditorium at the Museum of Broadcasting.

PATRICIA EDEN, Joe's girlfriend, who is the editor-in-chief

of a New York publishing house called Eden Books, is standing

at a podium at a sales conference.  In the audience are sales

reps, wholesalers, etc.  There's a screen behind her with

pictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks.

There's a burst of applause as a photograph of Veronica Grant

flashes on screen.

We see pictures of Veronica at eight with her sharecropper

family, Veronica at 14 with her first child, Veronica with a

series of husbands, Veronica in a wheelchair, etc.

Now we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of

Veronica on it and the title: "Am I Rising from Ashes, or Did

I Just Forget to Dust?"

Patricia bursts into tears.

Everyone applauds enthusiastically.

INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - A SHORT WHILE LATER

reps congratulating her.  She is the soul of graciousness.

Her assistant, Sarah, comes up.

She walks toward the exit.

EXT. 57TH STREET - CONTINUOUS

Patricia in the pouring rain, trying to hail a cab.  She

spots one across the street.

She whistles -- a longshoreman's whistle.

The cab makes a U-turn, but instead of stopping for Patricia

it stops about twenty feet ahead for a MAN in an overcoat who

gets into it.

INT. TAXI - A MINUTE LATER

As the cab turns onto Eighth Avenue, starts uptown.

Patricia is dialing her cell phone.  She's elaborately

ignoring the man who stole her cab.

She hangs up, folds up the phone, puts it back in her purse

as the cab moves on.

He smiles at her.

The cab stops.

He gets out.  Closes the door.  A beat too late:

of paper.

CLOSE UP - FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER

As Frank unfolds a newspaper clipping of a yearbook picture

They start chatting.

Across the room, Joe is with Patricia, who is telling two

other people the story of meeting the rabbi in the taxicab.

Joe looks over and sees Kathleen.  He suddenly looks

stricken.

Shifts his position so Kathleen can't see his face, but

sneaks a look.

They all laugh.  Joe moves over to the bar.

As he is waiting, Kathleen comes up next to him.

Kathleen laughs.

Joe vanishes into the party.

Everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at

At the same time:

As the iron gates on all the stores start to open, just the

way we saw them open in the opening sequence of the movie.

The pharmacy.  The optician.  The cosmetics supply store.

The video store.

And now, finally, we see the new grate on the new Foxbooks

Superstore start to open upwards.  This is the finest grate

on Broadway, no question of it.  It's electric and almost

soundless.  We see a sign saying, OPENING DAY.  35% OFF ON

ALL BEST-SELLERS.

People on the street notice the store.  One walks in...

CAMERA follows him...

INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

The inside is beautiful.  Gleaning staircase, a cafe,

comfortable chairs to sit, a bank of cashiers, everyone

decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the

And as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children

come up the stairs behind them.

EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

A little group of children dressed as Pilgrims walk down the

Joe is putting sugar into his coffee at the sugar counter as

Kathleen comes in.  He pretends he didn't see her.

INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

We see Kathleen and George at the end of the day, counting

the receipts.  Birdie is using a calculator to total them.

Christina is shelving books.  There are Thanksgiving

decorations -- cardboard turkeys and pilgrims, books on

colonists like Myles Standish.

They look at each other.

The door opens, and Meredith Carter, the woman George had

swooned over in front of his building, walks in.

George stares, frozen in place, as she walks up to him.

Kathleen suddenly sees George, following Meredith out of the

store.  He's in a complete daze.

He goes out the door.

LAURA MARGULIES, a well-known children's book author, enters

as George leaves.

She smiles brightly.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

George and Meredith are sitting in a booth.

George takes her hand in his and looks at it as if it were

the eighth wonder of the world.  He starts stroking it,

caressing it...

Meredith pulls it away.  A beat.  Then she gives it right

back to him.  He continues stroking.  They stare at each

other.  He puts her fingers into his mouth.

She utters a little moan.

INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT - A SHORT WHILE LATER

They come into the apartment.  She throws herself into his

arms.

INT. ZABAR'S CHEESE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

The place is mobbed -- the usual crush the night before

Thanksgiving.

Kathleen, pushing a shopping cart, is trying to wedge her way

through the crowd in the cheese department.  As she reaches

across three people to grab some Brie, she sees Joe walk into

the store.  Quickly, she turns her back so he can't see her.

She stands there frozen.  A beat...

Peeks around, doesn't see him anywhere.  Cranes her neck this

way and that.  No Joe.

INT. ZABAR'S CASHIER AREA - CONTINUOUS

Kathleen, now wearing dark glasses but looking not at all

disguised, looks around and spots a short line and makes a

beeline for it.

At that moment, Joe comes from the Appetizing Department and

gets on the line she was heading for.

Panicked, Kathleen retreats onto another line and stands with

her back to him.

INT. SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

The CASHIER totals up Kathleen's purchases and Kathleen hands

over her credit card.

"She doesn't have cash" is repeated all the way down the

line.

Joe turns to see what's going on.

Rose just stares at him.

Joe looks at her, winks.

The cashier, completely charmed, takes Kathleen's credit

card.

Kathleen is appalled.

Everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly.

As Kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly

starts to put her groceries into a bag.

INT. JOE'S FATHER'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING DAY

An elegant East Side apartment.  Schuyler, his youngish

French wife, YVETTE, Nelson, Gillian and their child Matt,

Joe is on a loveseat with Matt.  Gillian lifts Matt up, sits

down in his place next to Joe and plunks Matt into her lap.

Nelson is already seated in a chair in front of the loveseat

and can't see her without turning around.

As she continues singing, Gillian moves her hand next to

Joe's leg.  Joe edges away.  He looks around the room, sees

Nanny Maureen standing behind the couch.  He stands, offers

her his seat.  She sits.

INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

A much more informal Thanksgiving dinner. We see the

leftovers on a sideboard near a round table in Kathleen's

living room.

Kathleen, Frank, Birdie, Christina, George and George's new

girlfriend, Meredith and TWO OTHER FRIENDS are standing

around the upright piano.  Birdie is playing a Christmas

song, and everyone is singing.

As the singing continues, over, we cut to:

EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DECEMBER DAY

As the Christmas decorations and twinkle lights go into the

window.

Birdie walks by the store.  She stops to look at the

customers inside, and then notices a sign in the window:

"Book Signing January 10 - Best Selling Children's Author

Laura Margulies."  There's a picture of Laura Margulies.

EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DECEMBER DUSK

Kathleen is in the window decorating a little tree with

lovely decorations from a box.  Two people are carrying a

tree home, there's the sound of church bells.

Then she unwraps a pair of ruby slipper ornaments, and as she

starts to hang them on the tree we hear the sound of the

computer.

Young Joe, at the dinner table with his father.  A wide shot

tears are rolling down little Joe's cheeks.

Joe stops typing.  He is surprised to find his eyes watering.

A moment of confusion as he cannot believe he has moved

Birdie looks at Kathleen.

Birdie can't bring herself to answer.

She opens the locket hanging around her neck.  There's a

picture of Kathleen's mother inside it.  Birdie holds the

locket up to her face.

Birdie holds the locket to her ear and listens.  A pause.

Birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag, goes out the

door.

EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT

It's starting to rain.  Kathleen lowers the grate over the

store.  As she turns to walk away, William Spungeon steps in

her path out of the shadows.

He laughs.  So does she.  Dramatically, he whips out an

umbrella and opens it over the two of them.

He touches her cheek suddenly.  Kathleen starts.  Then he

blows on his hand.

Kathleen relaxes.  They start walking.

Spungeon suddenly puts his hand through Kathleen's hair.  She

stops, frozen in place.

He grabs her and tries to kiss her.

He backs her into a wall.

A long beat.

He walks away, leaving Kevin.

Kevin stares after him.  Then he walks away in the other

direction.

INT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

Kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her

tea.  She's starting to feel a little foolish.  She checks

her watch.

A loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next

to hers.  They're laughing.  A man from the group grabs the

empty chair at Kathleen's table.

Kathleen jumps up.

She takes the chair back.  Sits down again.  She watches the

group as they playfully fight over the menus.

She checks her watch again.  Then she opens her copy of Pride

and Prejudice and looks at it.  She can't focus.

A man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at

him.  But he's going to meet another group of people.

As he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower

onto the floor.

She jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were

precious china.

In the window, now, behind her, Joe appears.  He watches, as

she rearranges the book and the flower.

He disappears from sight.

A beat...

He walks in the door.

Joe picks up her book, looks at it.

Kathleen grabs it back.

She places it back on the table, puts the rose into it.

Joe sits down.

Kathleen is shocked at herself.

He lifts the book off the table.  Kathleen grabs for it.

She manages to get the book, leaving Joe with the rose.

She holds her hand out for it.

Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.

She grabs the rose.  Puts it back in the book.

He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very

next table, with his back to her.

The door to the restaurant opens.  Kathleen looks at it

hopefully.  A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined

by a pleasant looking woman.

For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the

wind has just gone out of her sails.  She takes out her

compact, looks into her mirror.  She slides it over to look

behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her.  He

turns away suddenly.

Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.

She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off

on.  But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her

table.

The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTITE

in a boa comes in the door.

A beat.  Joe gets up.

Joe leaves.

EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Kathleen comes down the street.  She drops the rose in the

trash can.

INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - A MINUTE LATER

Kathleen comes in, drops the book on the table, takes off her

coat and goes immediately to the computer.  She clicks on

American Online.  Waits impatiently to connect.  Looks with

anticipation at the mail box.

THE COMPUTER SCREEN - NO MAIL

Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face.

She takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her

face and blows her nose.  Then looks at her handkerchief and

tosses it over her shoulder.

She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of

her shoes.

Then she lies down on the bed, fully clothed.  She reaches

up to turn out the light.

INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dead silence.

There it is.  It's of a man with his jacket pulled over his

head.

They all look at it.

They look around.  There's no one in the store and nothing to

A pause.

They hear the jingle of the front door.  They look hopefully

toward it.  It's only Birdie.

Hold on Kathleen as the computer sound begins.

INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As she types.  And we cut from her face to the screen as we

hear a voice-over:

INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER

The E-mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads.

Joe sits there a second.  A moment of intense ambivalence.

Then he hits the Menu key and signs off.

Joe stands and leaves the room.

The computer sits there.

Hold on the computer.  We hear him open the refrigerator

door. We hear him close the refrigerator door.  He passes

the den without even looking into it.  A moment later he

comes back into the room, stares at the computer.  He starts

for the bedroom, changes his mind.  Circles the computer.

He's going to go cold turkey if it kills him.

Fuck it.  He sits down.  Sign on.  Starts to type.

He stops... Hits the delete button and erases the message.

He starts typing again:

He backspaces to erase "there was no phone."

Screen now reads: I was stuck in a meeting, which I couldn't

get out of it.  Joe sits there thinking for a moment.  Then he

starts typing.

He stops and looks at it.  Then he types:

He sits looking at it.

Then he deletes the whole thing.

Sits looking at the blank screen.

He clicks the Yes box.

Then he starts to type again.

He deletes "for not being there."

Then types again, after "to forgive me".

She closes her eyes.

Birdie sits down on the loveseat next to Kathleen, puts her

arms around her.  Hold on them.

Christina looks over at the picture of Birdie.

customer she's planning to travel, Christina saying she's

finally going to have to finish her dissertation, George

saying he's been offered a job at Foxbooks but even though

it's okay with Kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were

the last place on the earth.

There is a frantic, rummage sale atmosphere.

Kathleen, busy at the cash register, looks up for a minute at

her beautiful store being ravaged by vultures.  We hear the

sound of the computer and hear her voice-over:

As a woman dumps a huge stack of books on the checkout table.

A FORTH SHOPPER approaches the counter with a stack of books

up to his chin, and manages to slide the stack on the

The little bell over the door jingles.

Kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches

it.

Then she comes out of the store, carrying the bell.

Kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate

for the last time.

The grate starts to lower.

Kathleen looks at her store, one last time.  Then she walks

off, carrying the bell.  We hear it jingle in the night.

And hold on The Shop Around the Corner, and it slowly turns

And then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty
