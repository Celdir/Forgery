FULL SHOT - REAR AREA - (DAY) - (GLASS)

This is December 24, 1944, in the first safe area directly

behind the battle line, in the Italian theatre.

In the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen

and artillery rumbles are heard.  The battered terrain shows

the effects of battle.

In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with

camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage.

Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and

the ground.  A camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is

nearby.

MED. SHOT - NEAR RECREATION AREA

We can HEAR LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the men as a jeep

with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's

car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation

area.  A YOUNG SERGEANT is at the wheel, an ADJUTANT beside

him, and in the rear are GENERAL WAVERLY and GENERAL CARLTON.

JEEP - MED. CLOSE

As it jounces along.  General Waverly is weather-beaten and

weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long

wear.  General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean

and fresh from the Pentagon.

He is staring off at the recreation area.

The jeep has come to a halt.

Waverly and the Adjutant alight from the jeep.

The Sergeant looks at General Waverly.

The jeep pulls off and makes a half circle. The Adjutant

makes a gesture, as if to stop it. The General stops him.

TWO SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY AND ADJUTANT

The Adjutant turns to him.

He takes the Adjutant by the arm and leads him toward the

recreation area.

RAISED PLATFORM - MED. SHOT

CAPTAIN BOB WALLACE (BING CROSBY) is wearing a makeshift

beard and Santa Claus hat and PRIVATE PHILIP DAVIS (DONALD

O'CONNOR) is in combat clothes.  They are doing a number to

entertain the soldiers, WHAT DOES A SOLDIER WANT FOR

CHRISTMAS?  During introduction, we

just starting to take seats, off to one side where they are

not noticed by the performers.

GROUP SHOT - ABOUT 6 SOLDIERS

seated in audience.  They look off, see General, start to

rise.

5C.

TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT

The General notices them - motions for them to sit down again,

indicating he doesn't want attention called to himself.

5D.

PLATFORM - FULL SHOT

The number concludes to applause.  Bob holds up his hand for

silence.  He removes his beard.

Automatically, Bob stiffens.  Phil does the same.

AUDIENCE - FULL SHOT

Every man is at attention and every head has turned to where

General Waverly has taken up a position near the front of

the platform.

The boys respond with "Merry Christmas".

Bob, covering his embarrassment:

He turns to the musicians, gives the downbeat.  They play

THE OLD MAN, which is sung by the entire outfit.

The General stands at attention through the first chorus,

visibly moved.  During the second chorus he starts up the

aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is

bandaged to the knee. The Adjutant puts out his arm to help.

Waverly refuses. Toward the finish of the song, he turns,

faces the men and salutes them.  The men return the salute.

(This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the

enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.)  There is a Red Cross

ambulance standing by.

CLOSE SHOT - (NIGHT) - TINY CANDLE

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a hand lighting a candle on

a tiny makeshift Christmas tree.  We reveal a number of

enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench, including

Bob and Phil.  One of the men looks at his wristwatch.  Now

another does.

CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH

The hand is approaching midnight.

CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER

He is looking at his wristwatch.

CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH

The second hand is pointing to the hour.

FULL SHOT OF SCENE

This is the prearranged signal for Bob to begin singing WHITE

CHRISTMAS.  Phil accompanies him on a harmonica.  Toward the

end of the song, an enemy barrage DROWNS out the music.  A

shell BURSTS in the vicinity.

CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

Phil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel

burst.  This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which

he thinks is unnecessary.  Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look,

brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song

left off.  Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him.

EXT. SKY - (NIGHT)

CAMERA SHOOTING UP to the sky as brilliant fireworks explosion

lights up the screen.  Over scene SUPERIMPOSE:

12-A.

INSERT - NEWSPAPER

Headline reads: "V-E DAY!"

As CAMERA MOVES FAST INTO headline, we LOSE the fireworks

display and the headline covers the whole screen.

12-B.

INSERT - CHURCH TOWERS - (DAY)

Bells are ringing for celebration of V-E Day.  CAMERA MOVES

INTO mouth of one bell, blacking out the screen.

EXT. BILL POSTER OF FLORIDA SHOW - (NIGHT)

featuring names and pictures of Bob and Phil.  CAMERA MOVES

to a CLOSE SHOT of the picture, HOLDS for a second, then

suddenly the picture comes to life and we are on the stage

of the theatre where Bob and Phil are doing the production

number "BELLS".

MED. SHOT - INT. THEATRE - AUDIENCE

Perhaps twenty people, photographed at a slant.  They're

warm.  One woman has a fan, some use programs.  They are

enjoying the show, however.  There are some vacant seats

apparent.  This theatre is a modern traveling tent show,

such as have been playing in Florida in recent years, and

beyond the sides we see palm trees, characteristic of Florida.

FULL SHOT - AUDIENCE

APPLAUDING the conclusion of the number.

MED. FULL SHOT - BACKSTAGE

The curtain is down, the boys come off, the curtain goes up

on the next number, which is dancing.  Phil and Bob are met

by COOKE, the Company Manager.

RITA, a luscious Latin type, and some of the remaining chorus

girls and other players ad lib, "Couldn't be cuter!"  "Great."

"Very funny!"

Bob and Phil, with Cooke, go to the backstage telephone.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE

This is the business office of Bob and Phil.  OSCAR is their

representative and manager, not their employer.

He is sixty and looks competent.  He refers to a telegram in

his hand.  Pictures of the boys adorn the desk, and Wallace

and Davis sheets of previous shows are on the wall.  It must

be evident from their billing that the boys are important

stars in New York.

17A.

CLOSE SHOT - GROUP

Phil is holding the receiver up to Bob.  Oscar's VOICE can

be plainly heard.

17B.

CLOSE SHOT - OSCAR

As he speaks into the telephone

He hangs up.

GROUP SHOT - PHIL, BOB AND COOKE

Bob hangs up the phone.

The boys walk to their dressing room.  A group of the chorines

come flying by, toward the dressing rooms, with squealing.

They make quite a picture from the rear, bouncing and all.

Rita shows up in front of Phil.

Phil evidently was trying to hide this from Bob and is self-

conscious at being caught.

MED. SHOT - WATERFRONT INN - BOB AND PHIL - (NIGHT)

The boys are now finishing their dinner.  Bob is facing the

orchestra, Phil would have to turn to see it.  The MUSIC

plays, the boys eat.  The table is close to the bar.  On two

stools sit JUDY and BETTY.  Betty is wearing her glasses and

examining some railroad tickets that have just been handed

her by the bartender.  Phil is not paying attention to his

eating, he is entranced with Judy's pretty legs draped over

the bar stool.  Bob cannot see the girls and is not even

interested enough to turn around.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY

On her part, Judy is not absorbed in the tickets, but is

unobtrusively sizing up Phil.

CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND BOB

Bob notices Phil's absorption.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY

Betty looks from the tickets and sees that Judy is covertly

eyeing Phil.  She leans forward.

MED. SHOT - BOOTH - BOB AND PHIL

Phil is still fingering the card.

There is a drum roll from the orchestra.  Betty takes off

her glasses and puts them in their case, on the bar.  The

bandleader's voice announces:

The audience applauds politely while the girls start toward

the platform,  Phil reacts in surprise to the new development.

23-A.

PLATFORM - FULL SHOT

Betty and Judy do their number: "SISTERS".  As they take

their bows --

MED. SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

Phil pretends to recognize Judy.

He goes, Bob watching, disgusted.  NOVELLO, the owner of the

Waterfront Inn, comes up.

MED. SHOT - BOB AND NOVELLO

Novello evidently knows Bob.

Phil enters the shot with Judy and Betty.

MED. SHOT - GROUP

Novello pulls out the table to permit the girls to be seated.

Phil gets Betty next to Bob, he sits next to Judy.

The orchestra has gone into WHITE CHRISTMAS.

It dawns on him, slowly.  He shows no emotion.

Bob looks at Phil.  The rules are clear between them.

Bob puts his hand out.  Phil takes it.  They shake.

They move toward the dance floor.

Keeps falling off the wagon.

The orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song.  (To

be decided upon.)  The vocal is shared by Bob, Betty, Judy

and Phil, individually.  Toward the end of the vocal Phil

dances Judy out to the terrace overlooking the water.  This

blends into their dance.  The staging of the number should

reunite the four principals by the end of the number.  The

audience applauds and they all go back to their booth.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY

They are a half dozen steps ahead of the boys.

The men are now up to them and help them into the booth.

MED. SHOT - BOOTH - GROUP

Bob does not sit.

As they start off, Novello enters to the girls, agitated.

Bob has stopped.  He looks at Phil, suspiciously.

Phil holds up his hand in "Scout's honor."

Bob turns back to the table.

The girls start off, confused.  Novello, Bob and Phil follow.

He leaves them, as Bob and Phil look unpleasantly after him.

They have reached the wings.

INT. WINGS - MED. SHOT

STAGEHAND is setting up a record on a record-playing mechanism

backstage, as the group passes by heading for the dressing

rooms.

The girls have opened the door to their dressing room.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - MED. SHOT

As they all enter.

As they close the door,

INT. NOVELLO'S OFFICE - MED. SHOT

Novello is with the SHERIFF and the LANDLORD.  The Sheriff

is a husky fellow. At the moment he's eating an eclair and

coffee, from Novello's desk.  The Landlord glares at him.

Novello puts his hand up, listening.

He gets up, opens the office door, and we HEAR their entrance

music, as before, and the Orchestra Leader's voice, "The

Stewart Sisters."

MED. SHOT - CAFE FLOOR

Bob and Phil stand with their backs to the audience.

They turn, face front, and we realize they are mouthing to a

record.

CLOSE SHOT - WINGS - RECORD PLAYER

We identify that the music is coming from this spinning record

player we have previously established.

34-A.

MED. SHOT - CAFE FLOOR

Bob and Phil do the number.

MED. SHOT - AUDIENCE

They APPLAUD at end of number.

MED. SHOT - INT. NOVELLO'S OFFICE

We faintly HEAR the applause.

The Sheriff gets up.

MED. SHOT - CAFE FLOOR

The boys bow themselves off, and run toward their dressing

room.

MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR

They hurry down the corridor, passing the office door.

The office door opens behind them, which they do not see.

The Sheriff steps out, followed by the Landlord and Novello.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - DRESSING ROOM DOOR

There is a plaque attached to the key in the lock.  The

Sheriff smilingly turns the key in the lock.  He puts the

key in his pocket.

The landlord is delighted.

MED SHOT - EXT. CAFE - (NIGHT) - SHERIFF

The Sheriff walks around the corner of the cafe, and a police

car awaits, with cop at the wheel.

The Sheriff continues to the window of our dressing room.

MED CLOSE SHOT - DRESSING ROOM WINDOW

It opens.  The Sheriff watches it.  Out comes Phil's legs,

meaning to get out backwards.  The Sheriff applies both hands

and pushes back.

He pushes Phil in.  Nimbly, he raises himself in.

MED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM

The Sheriff is in the room.  He looks coolly at the boys,

who are now in their own clothes.  He stares at them.  They

stare at him.  Recognition comes all at once.

They all throw their arms around each other, pounding

violently.  'No!  Wow!  You dirty skunk!  You grave robber!'

REVERSE ANGLE - POLICE CAR - SHOOTING BY SHERIFF

Hank looks up enquiringly.

EXT. WINDOW - POLICE CAR

Hank has thrown the door open.

He starts with his red lights going, his siren screaming,

and tires grinding.

MED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM

The Sheriff watches them go, pleased.  A pounding on the

door recalls the Landlord, and he frowns.  He strides to the

door, takes out his key and opens it.

MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR

The Landlord and Novello are looking out the window at the

departing police car, the noise having distracted them from

the door pounding.  The siren is still heard, retreating.

The Sheriff snaps his cigarette at their feet.  They turn to

him, faces alight.

He protests, 'What - !' 'But!'  Novello is openmouthed.

EXT. STATION - (NIGHT)

The train is already moving as the police car arrives.

The girls are on the observation platform.  The police car

screams to a stop.  The boys fly out, with bags, and just

make the train, the girls pulling them aboard.

They go toward the lounge car.

MED. SHOT - INT. LOUNGE CAR - GROUP

They all take seats in the lounge car, happy to have

accomplished their escape.

Bob looks from him to Judy, whose expression is almost

pleading.

FULL SHOT - EXT. TRAIN - (NIGHT)

The rhythm of the wheels and the engine funnel, underscored

musically.

MED. SHOT - INT. TRAIN

All but Phil are half dozing.  One or two other people are

seen in the background, asleep.  There is an air of peace

and quiet in the car, as the music underscoring continues.

Their faces are occasionally streaked with light flashes

emanating from the surrounding countryside.  Phil turns to

the side of the car and sees a bill poster showing a copy of

a winter scene from the Grandma Moses collection, advertising

Vermont.  CAMERA PULLS UP TO scene, the music swells and we

DISSOLVE to a similar landscape in stylized concept.  This

is the WINTER FANTASY production number.  At the end of the

fantasy we hear the Conductor's voice, "Pine Tree.  Pine

Tree, Vermont."

MED. SHOT - OUR GROUP - (DAY)

They are bundling themselves up, coat collars tight, expecting

to enter the snow country.

REVERSE ANGLE - SCENE THROUGH PLATFORM DOOR

Pine Tree Station, all green, no snow.  Four hotel busses

await, one marked 'Columbia Inn Bus.'

FULL SHOT - PINE TREE STATION - (GLASS SHOT)

Our foursome is just getting off the train.  They are the

only ones.  They are looking about, puzzled.

The other three bus drivers are disappointed.

FULL SHOT - BUS EN ROUTE

The bus goes by an incongruous skating rink, with water

instead of ice.  Signs indicate the direction of the sun

scorched toboggan slide.

MED. SHOT - BUS EN ROUTE

The bus winds around another turn in the beautiful green

surroundings and we pass a ski lift and a ski jumping

platform.

MED. SHOT - BUS EN ROUTE

Still another turn of the bus, and in the distance we see a

LONG SHOT of the Columbia Inn.

MED. SHOT - INT. COLUMBIA INN

MARTHA, a sixty year old spinsterish woman, good of heart,

forbidding exterior, is occupied at the desk.

The door opens and a pretty fifteen year old, SUSAN, carrying

the mail, walks toward her.

She puts the mail on the desk.

Through the huge window behind Susan and Martha we see the

figure of a man in overalls, bending over an incinerator,

shoveling the ashes into a wheelbarrow.

His back is to CAMERA.

Susan starts out as CAMERA MOVES UP to window.  After a

moment, Susan appears and crosses to the man in overalls.

He straightens up, dusts off his hands, and as he turns to

take the letters, we see for the first time that he is General

Waverly.  He looks through them, eagerly, then, downcast,

shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work.

58-59

OMITTED

FULL SHOT - EXT. INN - (DAY)

The bus comes to a stop and our principals get out, Phil

staying with the driver for the luggage.  The others enter

the inn.

MED. SHOT - INT. INN

Martha at the desk, and her eyes widen in surprise.

Through the door comes Waverly, carrying a load of wood in

one arm, and a bucket of coke in the other hand.  Susan

follows carrying an armful of kindling.

Bob turns away.

Through the door comes Phil, fast, talking:

Phil has his arm out indicating the direction of the door,

when he sees Waverly.  He freezes.  He brings his hand up to

a salute, from that position.

Phil and Bob stiffen automatically.

He smiles at the girls, and exits, dignified.

INT. DINING ROOM INN - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT -

BETTY AND JUDY

They are doing the number, SISTERS, on the floor.  THE CAMERA

PULLS BACK to reveal the scene.  There is a scant audience

distributed at several tables, totaling not more than fourteen

in number.  Not far from the kitchen entrance Bob and Phil

are sitting at one table.

Martha is seen doing general overseeing, principally acting

as hostess.  Susan doubles between the cashier's desk and

helping out at table.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

They are admiring the performance.  Phil indicates for Bob

to look in this direction.  Bob does.

REVERSE ANGLE - MED. SNOT

The General is seating a table.

MED. SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

Bob shakes his head, unhappy at this condition.  They look

at each other.

MED. FULL SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY

They finish the number and are applauded enthusiastically,

but the few people in the audience don't make for much

clatter.  One set of hands seems to be applauding loudest

and clearest.

MED. SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY

He is the one doing the enthusiastic applauding.  He walks

toward the boys, still applauding.  They applaud too.  The

girls enter the scene, to sit with the boys.

Martha is only applauding politely, until Waverly glares at

her.  Then her enthusiasm is boundless.

A waitress brings food, which Martha helps distribute.

He dignifiedly walks in the direction of some departing

guests, and proceeds to show them to the door.

As he regards Bob with something akin to awe, we

MED. SHOT - INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT)

The last of the supper audience is leaving.  We see into a

room which adjoins the reservation desk and Bob is on the

phone.

CLOSE SHOT - INT. INN OFFICE

Phil is sitting on the desk while Bob talks.

FULL SHOT - COLUMBIA INN FLOOR - (DAY)

The scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying

preparations for the show.  The little stage has been enlarged -

the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall

pushed back a little farther.  There is hammering and painting

going on in various parts of the room.  Trunks have been

unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places, as more trunks

arrive.  Girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around,

do cartwheels; two people sing at the piano; six girls kick

in unison; altogether, it is quite a contrast to the bareness

of the previous scene.

THE CAMERA TRUCKS through all the activity, taking in our

group at the doorway, which features Bob and Phil, the girls

standing nearby.  Martha and Susan are amazed at the activity.

This has not fooled Susan.  She throws her arms around Bob

and then Phil.

She cannot refrain from tears of gratitude and turns and

runs out.  There is a moment of silence.

Betty steps up to him and gives him the biggest smack.

Bob is quite surprised.

They look off through the exit and see a moving van unloading

scenery, as the General arrives in his buggy.

He steps down and looks with amazement at the scenery passing

by.

EXT. INN - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT - WAVERLY, BOB AND PHIL

Waverly is looking interestedly at the goings on, but is

puzzled.  The boys exchange a glance.

The troupe is busy transporting the costumes, etc., from the

moving van to the dining room auditorium as the above scene

is played.

He turns away and goes to his quarters.

MED. SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR - (DAY)

The company is rehearsing as Bob and Phil enter.

People break off what they were doing and begin to drift

out. Bob and Phil have gone toward Betty and Judy.

The girls go.  Phil goes toward the piano, Bob goes toward

Martha, who is on the phone, accepting reservations.

FULL SHOT - ROOM

Bob takes Martha by the arm and seats her in the middle of

the room as an audience of one.  Phil looks up from the piano,

puzzled. The sunset is visible through the window and there

is a mood of quiet.

He leaves her and goes to the piano and they do WHAT CAN YOU

DO WITH A GENERAL, solely for Martha.

Toward the end of the song --

MED. CLOSE SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY

Unseen by the others he is standing by the door listening to

the song.

MED. SHOT - INT. ROOM

The boys finish the number. Martha applauds and Bob bows.

CLOSE SHOT - SUSAN - AT KITCHEN DOOR

She is standing there, drying her eyes with her apron.

CLOSE SHOT - WAVERLY - AT THE DOOR

FULL SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR

Bob and Phil exchange a quick glance.

The General turns and exits toward the lobby, THE CAMERA

PANS with him, a lonely figure walking through the lobby,

the CAMERA STOPPING on a poster advertising tonight's

performance.

FULL SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR - (NIGHT)

It is fairly-well filled.  Bob, Phil, Betty, Judy and the

ensemble are performing a NUMBER which is a MINSTREL SHOW

routine done to lyrics and music.  Bob and Phil are end men,

Betty is interlocutor, and Judy is later introduced as Mandy.

This takes Judy and Phil into a dance to the song MANDY.

This entire number is done in white-face with stylized

costumes and set. During the applause and bows, we CUT TO:

MED. SHOT - WAVERLY TABLE

Waverly, flanked by Susan and Martha, is at a large table.

The other occupants are local hotel owners and their wives.

Martha and Susan beam; all is well.

FULL SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR - (NIGHT)

It is empty and most of the lights are out.  At a considerable

distance from CAMERA Martha extinguishes the last light,

except for a small work light which is servicing Bob, who is

fingering the piano keys and writing music notes, hard at

work.

FULL SHOT - GIRLS' BUNGALOW

In the background we see the boys' bungalow.

MED. SHOT - INT. GIRLS' BUNGALOW

Betty and Judy are in twin beds, the light is coming in from

the moon.  The girls are seen in profile.

Betty turns and looks toward her.  Since Judy does not see

her, Betty's expression is a true reflection of how she feels.

CLOSE SHOT - JUDY AND BETTY

SHOOTING PAST Betty.  Is it possible our Betty has a suspicion

of a tear?

Music has underscored this scene.  Betty is wide awake.

She is looking toward the window.  As the curtains billow

outward we see a diffused figure of Bob, sitting on a fence,

putting out his pipe.  This is followed by an equally diffused

figure of Betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture,

and joining Bob.  Bob takes her in his arms.  At this point

we are brought back to reality by the wind slamming a shutter.

This causes the diffusion to vanish, and Betty gets out of

bed and puts on her robe.

INT. INN KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT)

We PAN Betty to the refrigerator door, which she opens.

Betty whirls around.

MED. SHOT - BETTY AND BOB

We see Bob is having a snack of his own.

He gets up and goes to the refrigerator.  His preoccupation

with the food will permit Betty's expression to be more

obvious than her lines, which are spoken to tell the audience

of her regard for Bob,  since their significance must escape

him.

Bob doesn't get the significance of what she has said.

He smiles at her, oblivious to the meaning behind her lines.

Bob begins to sing COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS, as he prepares the

warm milk and hands it to her.  She drinks it down.  As he

reaches the second chorus, he starts to dim the lamp on the

table,  Betty, pretending to be sleepy, leans her head toward

Bob.

He takes a pillow from a nearby chair and puts it between

her head and her chair.  She waits, eyes closed, expectantly.

But Bob gets to his feet, and carefully tiptoes to the door

and exits, closing it softly behind him.  After a moment,

Betty snaps on the light, throws the pillow on the floor,

and rests her chin in her hand, disappointed and wide awake.

FADE IN:

LONG SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR - (DAY)

Various members of the company are in rehearsal clothes and

sitting around the room.  The orchestra is playing the

introduction to Phil's number, which will employ a line of

six girls who are just coming on the floor.

Bob is on stage supervising the rehearsal.  Judy is standing

across from the piano.  Betty is seated on the sidelines

with her legs stretched over two chairs.

She is knitting a loud colored argyle sock.  Phil, standing

close by, has just finished rolling up a ball of yarn.  He

looks at Betty's knitting, then at his feet.

Phil reacts.

Bob crosses to his stage manager station, which is a desk

and high chair, where Albert is seated, not far from his

wife, Sylvia, who is sipping a glass of water.  Albert holds

a stop watch and evidently helps in the administration.

From his position, Phil, in a series of leaps and turns,

reaches center floor and begins his solo.

CLOSE SHOT - BETTY

She continues knitting while watching Phil dancing.

As Phil comes to a portion where he speeds up his steps she

unconsciously speeds up her knitting, Bob has seen her, and

he looks from her knitting and her look of admiration, which

he mistakes for affection, and then looks from the socks to

Phil's feet.  At the end of the number, which is applauded

by the witnesses, Judy runs to Phil and hugs and kisses him,

THE CAMERA STAYING at this distance.

Bob, looking at Betty, mistakenly sees her disappointment.

Bob looks from one to the other and their smiling shyness

indicates pregnancy.

The girls start crowding around.

MED. SHOT - BOB, PHIL AND ALBERT

Phil puts his arm around Albert.

They walk to the table where the coffee is, and the group

now includes Betty.

She turns away rather abruptly, since she is becoming

emotional.  Bob shakes his head, impressed with what he thinks

is her devotion.

MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

Bob dunks a doughnut into his coffee as he looks after Betty.

He looks at Phil and shakes his head.

FULL SHOT - WAVERLY QUARTERS - (NIGHT)

This is the party later that evening.  Some people are

dancing.  Others are grouped about, and there is a general

home party atmosphere.  The General, Martha and Susan are

seen helping everyone to feel at home.

The CAMERA STARTS ON A LONG SHOT and DOLLIES THROUGH THE

GROUP, passing Sylvia, where ad lib comments about the

impending baby are sketchily HEARD.  The CAMERA CONTINUES

toward the piano, where Bob and Betty are examining the music

sheet of A MAN CHASES A GIRL.

Betty looks up and the CAMERA FOLLOWS her look to Phil, who

is dancing with Rita.  Rita nestles up close to Phil.  This

is seen by Bob and Betty.  Bob smiles.

CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND RITA

On closer view, we can see that Rita is the aggressor.

SCENE FROM BOB'S VIEWPOINT

Betty is walking over to the dancing couple and deliberately

cuts in on Rita, who is displeased, but can do nothing but

yield.  Bob's reaction still implies that this is

understandable since Betty loves Phil.  He turns back toward

the piano, and other couples are between him and Betty and

Phil.

Still at the same camera distance, we see Betty turning Phil

over to Judy.

CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND JUDY

Judy is a little cool.

Phil is delighted that she is jealous.

He holds her closely, by force, dancing, smiling and pleased

with himself.

MED. FULL SHOT - ROOM

The dance music stops.  The people disperse.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT PIANO

Harry, the piano player, is playing the last half of A MAN

CHASES A GIRL.  Bob and Betty are leaning over the piano,

Bob humming the melody.  Betty pantomimes to the others to

quiet down.  Bob starts to sing the lyric.  In the second

chorus, he is joined in the singing by Betty.  During this

chorus we CUT TO show various reactions of the group, and

end on Phil, sitting close to Judy, holding her hand.

CLOSE TWO SHOT - PHIL AND JUDY

We HEAR Bob and Betty, off scene, continuing to the end of

the second chorus, on which Phil, sotto voce, sings the last

four bars.

APPLAUSE follows the song.  Phil gets up.

FULL SHOT - CROWD

Everyone quiets, waiting to hear the announcement.

He looks fondly at Judy, taking it for granted she is

overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is

going to marry her.  He hugs her amidst a general reaction

of congratulations.

MED. SHOT - BOB

He is flabbergasted.

MED. SHOT - GROUP

Phil and Judy are separated by the congratulators.

Betty, hiding her emotion, grips Phil's arm.

Bob sees her emotion through the speech.  Betty notices Judy

upset, shaking off the people around her and running through

the doorway to the kitchen.

Betty makes her way through the crowd to follow her, as the

orchestra goes into HER COMES THE BRIDE.

MED. SHOT - INT. KITCHEN

Judy is crying into her hands as Betty enters.

Betty puts one arm around her.

Phil enters the kitchen.

She goes through the corridor toward the living room.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - CORRIDOR OFF BUTLER'S PANTRY

In the background we see the General in the butler's pantry

getting some drinks for the guests.  He is not seen by Betty

who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few

tears.  Bob comes into view in the mirror, entering the

corridor from the living room.

There is a pause, and Waverly, who has been watching each

one, speaks.

Betty looks at him gratefully.

Happy, he beams at Judy.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND WAVERLY

Something bothers Bob about this story.  He looks searchingly

at Betty, puzzled.  He does not notice Waverly, who watches

him watching Betty.

LONG SHOT - RAILROAD STATION - DAY

Train about to leave.  The General is in the foreground

sitting in the buggy.  Betty is saying goodbye to him.

Bob and the porter are taking care of her luggage.

The General looks at her, questioningly.

The General smiles; Betty waves a farewell to him and crosses

to the train, starting up the steps.  The notion behind this

scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due

to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam.  The manner of

playing, though, indicates the sentiment.  To emphasize it:

Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully

realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return,

consciously, her affection.  We hear Betty:

Not all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick their

spots, but the attention is on the General, who is watching

the scene with a whimsical look.  He, as does the audience,

realizes Bob's true feelings.  As the train starts to leave,

Betty and Bob shake hands.  She holds his handshake a little

longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along with

the train.  Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after

the train, puzzled.

REVERSE ANGLE

THE CAMERA is now on the train platform, Bob out of sight.

Betty wipes away a tear.  In the background we see the General

in the buggy noticing this.

MED. LONG SHOT - TRAIN IN DISTANCE

Bob is in the foreground, the General in the background.

Bob joins the General at the buggy.  From Waverly's expression

we can see that he has decided on a plan of action.

CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTMAS TREE ANGEL - DAY

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN from the ceiling and we see that THE

INN is being decorated for Christmas Eve.

Everybody is so engaged, except those actively helping Phil

and Judy rehearse.  The attitude is slightly cool on Judy's

part, but it is lover's coolness.

They make a nice couple, with his arm around her waist,

dancing as one.

REVERSE ANGLE - BOB

He enters the room, and watches.  He looks intently at Phil.

Phil and Judy dance closer to Bob. They see him. They continue

dancing, talking as they do.

Bob hears, nods, but keeps staring at Phil.  Phil becomes

conscious of the staring.

They dance away.  Bob crosses to the piano and picks up the

package Betty left for him.  He opens it up and it is a single

knitted sock, the one she knitted on previously.  He looks

through the box for its mate.

There is none.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Bob, puzzled.

Painted at the top is the legend:

CLUB - MED. SHOT

as Bob watches her.  When she finishes the number, Betty

steps down from the platform and joins Bob.

Every line of the sock exchange should have the meaning of

the love implications.

Bob is close to declaring himself, if he was only sure of

his ground.

Bob leans over and takes her hand.

He is interrupted by ED HARRISON, who has been brought to

the table by the maitre d'.

She nods, as Ed sits down.

Ed looks at her, surprised.

Bob takes a piece of paper out of his inside pocket and hands

it to Ed.

As he continues to read the piece of paper, we

Seated around the television set are Waverly, Martha and

Susan.  Martha and Susan look at their watches and each other,

nervously.  Waverly also looks at his watch.

The women are becoming very nervous.  Suddenly we HEAR off

shouting.

He runs toward the stairs.  Martha and Susan breathe a sigh

of relief and follow Waverly.

the semidarkness of the lobby we hear a "sst - ", and Susan

and Martha are revealed having been waiting for them.

Martha blows her nose.

He looks to Susan and she begins to bawl.

Bob looks to Betty for support.

She can't hold it back either, and now the three women are

crying.

They start out.

MED. SHOT - EXT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT

As Bob and Betty turn around the corner, they see Phil and

Judy, locked in an embrace.  Bob has been in front, but he

steps back quickly, not wanting to embarrass the lovers.

She walks into sight, Bob following.  Phil and Judy break,

embarrassed.

And he holds his hand out, and they shake hands, still

flustered.

Flustered, the boys open the door to the girls' bungalow,

thinking it is their own.

They all laugh.  The girls enter their bungalow and put on

the light.  The boys head toward their bungalow.  Phil enters

in a gay mood.  Bob stops at the door, turns around and looks

toward the window of the girls' bungalow.

MED. SHOT - INT. GIRLS' BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Judy is getting into bed.  Betty, in her dressing gown, is

MED. SHOT - LOBBY STAIRWAY - (NIGHT)

General Waverly comes down the stairs, cutting quite a figure

in his uniform and decorations.  Martha and Susan, waiting

for him at the bottom, look him over, admiringly.

FULL SHOT - INN FLOOR

The spotlight prepared, pinpoints the General as he enters

the room, and the music starts.  The audience rises and

applauds.  He can't believe it.  He reaches his table,

decorated with flowers, and recognizes he is the guest of

honor.  From the lobby we hear the outfit SINGING the opening

strains of THE OLD MAN.

All eyes turn to the lobby entrance, through which the old

outfit marches, and continues to the stage, and then back to

their respective tables as the song finishes.

MED. SHOT - WAVERLY

He is profoundly moved and walks to the stage.  The audience

is seated.  Waverly looks at the assembled crowd with great

affection.  The people begin to shout, "Speech!  Speech!"

Martha and Susan sit.

The crowd quiets, waiting for the speech.

They howl and cheer.  He makes has way toward his own table,

greeting old friends on the way.

AUDIENCE - FULL SHOT

As they applaud and cheer.  The old outfit is happy.

In the exultation, General Waverly places two fingers to his

lips and blows a whistle of sheer pleasure and approval.  We

underscore with MUSIC indicating another number is taking

place on stage, although we do not see it.

SECTION OF AUDIENCE - MED. CLOSE

Ed Harrison crosses to General Waverly and whispers to him.

Waverly looks surprised, but rises and starts out.

Bob, visible in b.g., has been watching.  He and Harrison

exchange knowing glances.

AT HOTEL DESK - MED. SHOT

The lobby is empty;  in b.g. are the doors to the dining

room, where the show is in progress.  The telephone lies on

the counter.  Waverly enters and crosses to it.  He is a

little annoyed at being forced to leave the entertainment.

He suddenly snaps to attention, the old soldier.

Through the window behind the General we have seen it begin

to SNOW.  The General notices it for the first time, and his

face brightens.

He hangs up the phone, and proudly, head erect, he walks

through the lobby, smiling, eyes wet.  He lifts the bell on

the desk with a loud bang.  Martha hurries in, startled.

Martha salutes.

She and the General gaze at the snow falling beyond the lobby

door which is blown open by the wind.

Underneath all this we have been hearing the introductory

music to WHITE CHRISTMAS, which is the number now in progress

on the stage.  Waverly now turns and walks into the dining

room.

INT. DINING ROOM - MOVING CAMERA

CAMERA FOLLOWS Waverly on his entrance.  As he passes Susan,

we see she is reacting to something on the stage.

CAMERA PASSES Waverly and moves to:

STAGE - FULL SHOT - MOVING CAMERA

Center stage, there is a large cutout of a decorated Christmas

tree.  Also, there is considerable Christmas holly, mistletoe,

etc.  Bob and Betty are seen singing.  Throughout action of

this number Phil and Judy dance.  In addition there is staged

movement by the ensemble.  Bob and Betty are on each side of

the cutout Christmas tree, but it is obvious that Betty is

preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating

with one hand behind the cutout tree.

CAMERA FOLLOWS Bob and Betty as their movement takes them

behind the tree.  It is now that we see very clearly that

the rear wall of the stage (two immense barn doors) has

opened; in b.g. we see the Vermont countryside being covered

by the falling snow.  Also, we see pine trees in the snow

that are decorated.

Betty steers Bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of

mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock

she gave him in scene 110.  Bob looks up, sees the mistletoe

and the sock, and smiles at Betty.

She lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is

wearing the other sock.  They laugh and embrace.

REVERSE SHOT - FROM DINING ROOM

The cutout tree onstage rises to the flies and now the real

trees and falling snow in b.g. are completely visible.  One
