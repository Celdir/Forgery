FADE IN:

INT. ZITO'S BREAD STORY - DAY

Several dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on

end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end

in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse.

We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products

calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is

November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been

penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica

counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter,

in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat

red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE

WHITE BACKGROUND.

Now WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a low

TAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL.

During Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE

DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently

with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the

pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.

NOW WE SEE ZITO

He's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's

early in the day, and he's already been working for hours,

so he's a little tired and disgruntled.

NOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIME

She's entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is

Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked

with grey. She's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes

of a dark color.

EXT. ZITO'S BREAD STORE - DAY

Loretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping

satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She

moves off briskly.

EXT. A.J. CONTI FUNERAL CHAPEL - DAY

This is a little Italian funeral parlor.

INT. THE "WAKE" ROOM"

A generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes,

many folding chairs, a few OLD PEOPLE sitting and, up front,

the star of the show, the CORPSE on display in his gold and

formica casket. Before the casket is a little kneeler. We

discover an OLD LADY there, who crosses herself and rises.

She goes and sits by RUBY, another old women. She leans over

and says.

INT. OFFICE OF THE FUNERAL PARLOR

First WE SEE a name plate on a desk. The plate reads ALFONSO

CONTI. We HEAR his VOICE.

The SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE the loaf of bread which is half

cut up and being buttered. Next to the bread are two steaming

mugs of coffee. We HEAR the subdued TAPPING of Loretta's

tabulations.

The SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta

sitting at the desk having Zito's buttered bread and mugs of

coffee. Loretta's got her calculator going and is entering

figures in Al's black, gold-lettered ledger.

He looks down and sees the stain. He's at a loss.

She downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has

taken off, and slams the ledger shut.

INT. ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL

We are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They

are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall

starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes

are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is

ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift.

He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame,

heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that

Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a

ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes.

After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something

to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and

INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY

WE SEE a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section.

Now WE SEE Loretta, a few feet away, tabulating on a chopping

block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits,

unskinned.

INT. A FLORIST SHOP - DAY

A long white box is being filled with red roses. We HEAR the

FLORIST'S VOICE.

Now WE SEE Loretta tabulating and the Florist working on the

box of roses.

The Florist gives her a look and then smiles.

She gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. It's the first

time we've seen her smile. She has gold work around one of

her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red

rose. Camera moves close to Loretta and the rose.

END OF CREDITS

EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A red neon sign hangs in the window.

It's a quaint downstairs restaurant in Greenwich Village. A

YOUNG COUPLE stop, look at the menu, become more interested

in each other, kiss, and decide to go in.

INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

White tablecloths and dark green walls, a tiny bar up by the

door. The WAITERS all look a little alike. That's because

they're all related. The place is about half full, and bustles

along pleasantly.

MUSIC

A VIOLIN PLAYS a melancholy Neapolitan air.

MR. JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly.

They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is

Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is

impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens

to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a

pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a

mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is

Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked

with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and

high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.

Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who

hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.

Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she

watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.

BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their

order.

They HEAR a distinguished MAN'S VOICE rise out of the babble.

They turn and look. The man's name is PERRY.

PERRY AND PATRICIA FROM LORETTA'S POV

Perry is a university professor. PATRICIA is his

girlfriend/student. He's in his 50's. She's about 25 years

younger. She's getting her coat on in a huff.

She storms out, leaving Perry muttering to himself.

An abnormally SHY WAITER stops.

THE SHY WAITER begins to efficiently clear.

MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA EXCHANGE A GLANCE

Mr. Johnny is amused. Bobo serves them their salad.

Mr. Johnny considers this a point well taken.

BOBO AND HIS NEPHEW EDDIE STAND NEAR THE KITCHEN

Which can be seen through a serving window. They can look

out over the restaurant tables. Bobo is melancholy and

philosophical. EDDIE is a young waiter.

PERRY, FEELING NO PAIN, COLLARS THE SHY WAITER

He holds out his empty glass.

Perry takes his arm.

Perry lets go of his arm. He and the Shy Waiter commiserate

a moment. Then, wordlessly, the Shy Waiter goes.

BOBO IS CLEARING THE REMAINS OF MR. JOHNNY'S DINNER. He's

already cleared Loretta's.

Bobo goes. Loretta is surprised.

Mr. Johnny is uneasy. He massages his head.

Loretta looks at him strangely. Bobo rolls up the dessert

cart. WE SEE Loretta and Mr. Johnny through the frame of the

dessert cart. They turn and look at the desserts.

He does.

Mr. Johnny slowly gets out of his chair. There's not enough

room for him to kneel down. He has to ask two off-duty PRO

WRESTLERS who are eating dinner to move their chairs. They

do so with bemused expressions. Their names are BOB and MOOK.

SHY WAITER BRINGS PERRY A FRESH GLASS OF VODKA ASKS THE SHY

WAITER

MR. JOHNNY ON HIS KNEES ADDRESSES LORETTA

BOB AND MOOK ARE WATCHING MR. JOHNNY'S PERFORMANCE

They are deadpan mugs.

BOBO AND EDDIE STAND NEAR THE KITCHEN WATCHING

LORETTA AND MR. JOHNNY

Mr. Johnny takes off the ring and holds it out to her.

She meekly accepts the ring from him and takes his hands.

Mr. Johnny slowly stands up, brushes off his knees. The

restaurant has fallen utterly silent. Loretta smiles. They

embrace. Loretta kisses him quickly.

A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, SUSAN, IS MAUDLIN FROM THE PROPOSAL

Bobo stands very near her table. She is about to applaud the

proposal. She brings her hands together. Bobo's hand flashes

out and neatly captures her hands before they can part again.

The single sound dies abruptly in the silent room.

LORETTA AND MR. JOHNNY

Mr. Johnny is in control now. He looks around once, regally.

PERRY AND THE SHY WAITER LOOK AT MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA

The Shy Waiter sits down at Perry's table.

MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA

He's helping her on with her coat.

Mr. Johnny puts on his coat.

Bobo approaches with the bucket of champagne. He's flustered.

EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - A CREAM COLORED LTD SPEEDING - NIGHT

INT. A TERMINAL AT KENNEDY AIRPORT - NIGHT

Many PEOPLE, most of them Italian, are lined up to board the

plane. A VOICE can be heard over the P.A. system.

MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA ARE SAYING GOODBYE

He takes a piece of paper from his wallet.

He clumsily kisses her. Then he quickly turns and leaves.

She waves, but he doesn't look back.

EXT AIRPORT RUNWAY - NIGHT

Close shot on plane's wheels and under belly as it slowly

begins to move. Red lights are flashing.

AN OLD ITALIAN CRONE IS LOOKING OUT THE TERMINAL WINDOW

In the background we see the accordion like ramp that was

loading to the departing aircraft, slowly fold up. Loretta

walks up beside her, and looks out the window, too. The crone

is dressed in black and has a black scarf on her head.

The Crone notices Loretta.

The plane takes off. Loretta looks after it anxiously. All

her hopes are on that plane.

INT. A PARKING GARAGE IN LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT

The LTD pulls into the entrance and Loretta gets out. An

ATTENDANT appears.

Loretta walks of into the night.

EXT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Camera frames the window with a sweetheart in neon.

EXT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Loretta walks up the street and enters the store.

INT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Loretta walks in. IRV and LOTTE, the middle-aged couple who

own and run the place, are having an argument.

Loretta pays and waits for her change.

Loretta walks out.

Lotte, caught off-guard, blushes.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

It's a big, old eccentric, three-story corner house. To one

side, it's got a qated arch that leads to an inner courtyard

where three cars could park. It's got two cast-iron balconies.

About a third of the windows in the house are lit.

From within can be HEARD the faint strains of VICKI CARR

SINGING and one DOG BARKING. Loretta appears, carrying

champagne, approaches the front door, unlocks it, and goes

in.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT

MUSIC

VICKI CARR is SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM."

The front hall is typical of big old brownstones. There's a

big old oak coat rack with a built-in mirror and an umbrella

stand. There are several coats hanging from it. The floor is

littered with boots. There's also a side table.

On the table is a large cut-glass bowl filled with a couple

of pounds of hard candy.

Loretta comes in and takes off her coat. A single MAD HOWL

is HEARD, followed by a PANDEMONIUM OF BARKING. FIVE DOGS

charge into the hall to greet Loretta. They are totally

cockeyed, crackpot mutts. Their names are JUDAS, LUCY, LEO

FATBOY, AND JONES.

The VOICE of the OLD MAN is heard calling out from upstairs.

The Five Dogs turn away from Loretta and charge up the stairs

toward the voice. Loretta walks toward the living room.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

This is the source of the Vicki Carr song, which is just

ending. COSMO CASTORINI, Loretta's father is just turning

off the old stereo. He is a powerful man, about 65, with a

huge shock of white hair and gold wire glasses. He's wearing

a big old red silk robe over blue pajamas, and royal blue

slippers. The room it filled with lumpy upholstered furniture,

once grand, now threadbare; shawls and doilies cover holes

in failing fabric. There's a fireplace containing a dying

fire. Cosmo's wing chair, with his newspaper on it, is beside

a lit fringed lamp. Cosmo sees Loretta as she comes in.

He sits in his chair and puts his feet up on an old

needlepoint ottoman. He starts to read the paper.

Cosmo puts down the paper and takes his feet off the ottoman.

Cosmo gets up and heads for the kitchen. He hums and continues

as Loretta opens champagne.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Loretta and Cosmo sit at the kitchen table. It's a big tin

table with a black-and-white design. Loretta has put two old-

fashioned champagne glasses on the table, the split of

champagne, a bag of sugar cubes, and a bottle of bitters.

She pours the champagne, drops a little lump of sugar into

each glass, and adds a dash of bitters. She hands one of the

drinks to Cosmo.

Loretta shows it.

Cosmo examines it.

She smiles. He doesn't. They rise from the table.

THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DARKENED MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The door to the hall opens, and the light from without dimly

illuminates a massive four-poster bed. Cosmo enters, followed

by Loretta. He speaks into the dark a calm and measured

summons.

A lamp is switched on by the bed. By ROSE. Rose is in her

60'S, and is very, very beautiful. Her abundant white tresses

frame a face of porcelain delicacy.

She's wearing an old and richly beautiful white nightgown.

Cosmo goes and sits on the bed.

Rose starts laughing.

Cosmo walks out.

Cosmo shouts from the stairs.

MUSIC

VICKI CARR, SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM", starts playing. Rose

looks weary.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - MORNING

The first golden rays of sunlight touch the great old house.

The front door opens. Close shot of dogs coming into camera

as door opens. The OLD MAN comes out. The Old Man, who is

Cosmo's father, is 83 years old. He is taking the Five Dogs

out for their morning walk. He has their five leashes bundled

in one hand. In the other hand, even though it is a cloudless

November morning, he open black umbrella. He walks off down

the block with the dogs.

EXT. A SMALL CITY PARK SURROUNDED BY HURRICANE FENCE - DAY

The Old Man and the Five Dogs appear and enter the park. He

approaches a park bench where FELIX and LUCY are already

sitting. Felix and Lucy are about the same age as the Old

Man. They each have a well-behaved DOG. When the Old Man

sits down, he lets the Five Dogs go. The Dogs run off, BARKING

like mad.

The dogs can be HEARD in the distance. It sounds like they're

killing each other.

The Old Man makes a low, threatening noise.

The SOUND of the DOGS becomes intense again.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY

The gates in the big archway are opened from the inside.

It's Cosmo. He's wearing a good but old-fashioned suit, an

overcoat, and a homburg. He's pulled his car, a 1965 black

Buick, up to the gate. Now that he has the gates open, he

gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and

goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man

approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella.

The Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house.

Cosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and

son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective

door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the

same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion.

Then they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears

within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

A RED-HOT, WELL-SEASONED CAST IRON FRYING PAN

Receives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of

satisfaction. A wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around

until the pan is coated. Two square slices of yellow bread

with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan.

Two circles of green pepper land next to the bread. A spatula

flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the

cooked side.

Two eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in

the bread.

The circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula,

scooped up deftly, and each is made to frame one of the eggs.

A WOMAN'S HAND garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash

of red pimento. The spatula reappears and lifts the results

from the pan, and slides them onto two small dark blue plates.

Now WE SEE that Loretta is just finishing setting the tin

table for two. In the b.g., Rose is turning away from the

big, old-fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled

coffee pot is steaming up a sun-drenched window. Rose comes

toward the table with the laden blue plates. She's wearing a

nice old apron over a blue housedress. She's thoughtful.

As Rose comes to the table, Loretta in a blue denim work

shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. As

Rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to Loretta,

who's at the stove.

Loretta returns with the coffeepot to the table, and pours.

Then she takes the pot back to the stove.

Loretta comes to the table. They sit down to breakfast.

The WALL PHONE in the kitchen RINGS. Loretta goes and answers

it.

INT. A DARKENED BEDROOM IN PALERMO - DAY

Mr. Johnny is calling on an old European-style phone. In the

b.g. is the sickbed. In the sickbed lies VESTA, Mr. Johnny's

mother, her grey hair spread out on a golden pillow.

By the bed are THREE MOURNERS, old crones dressed in black.

One clutches a missal, the other two clutch rosaries. All

three are grieving in a steady low wordless whine. Mr. Johnny

speaks into the phone in a confidential manner. There is

some long-distance CRACKLE.

LORETTA ON THE PHONE

MR. JOHNNY ON THE PHONE

LORETTA ON THE PHONE

MR. JOHNNY ON THE PHONE

We HEAR Loretta's VOICE over his receiver.

LORETTA ON THE PHONE

Loretta hangs up the phone. She thinks. Rose speaks from the

table, where she's still sitting.

Rose gets up and takes the dishes to the sink, Loretta fishes

in her pocket and comes out with the business card Mr. Johnny

gave her. She dials the number.

INT. CAMMARERI PASTRY SHOP - DAY

(INTERCUT W/LORETTA IN KITCHEN)

CHRISSY, a woman with a Queens accent, answers.

INT. CAMMARERI PASTRY SHOP - OVEN ROOM - DAY

(INTERCUT W/LORETTA IN KITCHEN)

There's a long pause. Ronny's voice returns, hoarse with

emotion.

Loretta hangs up the phone. She looks at the card again,

makes a decision and pockets the card.

THE TOWNHOUSE/INT. THE BUICK - DAY

As Cosmo drives away. He's in a very good mood. He's

WHISTLING. He laughs to himself.

CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY

And the street in front of it. Loretta arrives. She's wearing

a long, navy-blue cloth coat and a knit hat. She looks up at

the sign and at the business card in her hand, and enters

the shop.

INT. CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY

It's a nice Italian bake shop. Three Italian women, CHRISSY,

BARBARA, and MA wait on THREE WOMEN SHOPPERS at the counter.

CHRISSY and BARBARA are in their late 20's or early 30's; MA

is old, old. Loretta comes in and speaks to CHRISSY.

EXT. CAMMARERI'S PASTRY SHOP - DAY

Chrissy comes out and Loretta follows. They walk around to

an outdoor staircase that descends into the sidewalk. Chrissy

shouts down.

EXT. AN OLD DOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE - DAY

The door slides open, revealing ROCCO, a baker missing a few

teeth. He is surrounded by bread.

Rocco slides back the door all the way. Chrissy and Loretta

make their way past him. He slides the door three quarters

shut behind them.

INT. THE BASEMENT OVEN ROOM - DAY

There are two coal-fired ovens, one at either end of the

room. There is a large wooden table roughly center. And

various pieces of baking equipment, dough-mixers, etc.,

scattered willy-nilly. And everywhere there is bread.

PIETRO, a baker, is working at one of the ovens with a long

wooden spatula. RONNY is working at the other oven.

Actually, he is just staring in the open door at the baking

bread and burning coals. He's dressed in black jeans streaked

with flour, a white restaurant shirt, white cotton gloves,

and around his neck, a red handkerchief. He is black-haired,

handsome and intense.

Ronny turns and takes in Loretta.

Everything in the oven room has stopped and everyone is

watching.

He picks up the wooden spatula and slides it into the oven.

Ronny slides a bunch of loaves out of the oven on the spatula,

turns them around, and slides them back in.

Barbara appears in the doorway and comes down the stairs

into the room.

He pulls off the glove. The hand is made of wood.

He goes to the big table, which is floured and covered with

bread. He sweeps everything off the tabletop during the next.

The table is bare. He stares at it blankly. He wanders away,

to the back room where the flour sacks are kept. We hear a

single sob escape him from that room, and then silence.

Everyone in the oven room looks after him. Then Chrissy

approaches Loretta. She holds the big knife at her side.

She holds out the knife.

Loretta considers Chrissy, decides what she's going to do,

and goes to the flour room.

INT. OF THE FLOUR ROOM - DAY

Many 50 lb. bags of flour are stacked under a bare electric

bulb. A rough stone staircase opposite is lit by daylight

from above. Ronny, quietly distraught, stands leaning by his

forehead against a stack of flour. Loretta approaches him.

She feels for him.

He points to the stone staircase.

She touches his shoulder.

He follows her up the stairs.

EXT. THE STAIRCASE ENTRANCE ON THE STREET

Loretta and Ronny emerge. He gestures. They enter the

apartment building behind the bakery.

INT. THE PEACOCK CAFE  DAY

It's a dark Italian coffee and dessert house. Reproductions

of Roman statuary adorn grottos and alcoves. In the back is

a glass case displaying various desserts, and behind the

case, a big burnished gold cappuccino machine. The place is

almost empty.

MUSIC

An album of "NEAPOLITAN FOLK SONGS" is PLAYING on the cafe's

SOUND SYSTEM.

The CAMERA TRAVELS along the face of an exposed brick wall,

DISCOVERING busts of Romans occasionally, and then IT COMES

TO the figure of COSMO. He's sitting at a table which is

inset into a nook, so we cannot see who he's with.

DARK NOOK IN THE CAFE

At a little table away from prying eyes, Cosmo sits with

MONA, his girlfriend. Mona is a pretty but overripe Italian

woman in her late forties. She's all done up, and she looks

at Cosmo with adoration.

He takes out a small velvet box and hands it to her.

She opens the box. It's a gold bracelet with a pattern of

stars and birds.

EXT. RONNY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A three-story walk-up above Cammareri's Bakery.

INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's a two-bedroom apartment. The decor reflects Ronny's

love of the opera. The furniture is overstuffed, fringed in

the colors of Italian passion. But it is all a bit faded,

the remains of an old flamboyance. The walls are decorated

with opera posters; and over the fireplace there is a painting

depicting a scene from "La Boheme": Mimi is standing in the

snow. Ronny stares at the picture of Mimi in the La Boheme

poster. Loretta comes in from the kitchen and sets down a

cup of coffee.

Loretta moves back into the kitchen. Ronny turns and watches

as she walks down the hall.

INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT -DINING ROOM - DAY

CU of Ronny's artificial hand, holding a fork stuck in a

steak. With his right he is cutting his steak. He switches

hands and eats hungrily. Loretta watches.

Ronny drops his knife and fork and turns away. Loretta is

not surprised and does not move.

EXT. STREET NEAR BAKERY - DAY

SHOT OF COSMO & MONA IN THE BUICK

The car has just come to a stop. We see Cosmo & Mona kiss.

She exits car. Cosmo glances around with a slightly guilty

look and pulls away.

LORETTA AND RONNY AT THE TABLE WITH A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY

Camera is close on Scotch being poured into two glasses.

Loretta picks up her glass and swallows a healthy dose.

Loretta pours herself another shot.

Ronny stiff-arms everything off the dining table and grabs

Loretta. They kiss passionately. He pulls her up on the table

and over the table to him. They are in each other's arms.

They are on fire. Loretta pushes him away, gasping for air.

She changes her mind and lunges into another kiss. They stop

again after a long moment. They really haven't breathed.

They both suck in air and look at each other in wonder and

fear and passion.

They kiss again. When they pull apart again, Loretta is

crying.

He picks her up in his arms.

He carries her away, into the bedroom.

MUSIC: "O SOAVE FANCIULLA", from "La Boheme." The MUSIC

CONTINUES THROUGH THE NEXT SCENE.

INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

Ronny is laying her down in the bed. He is over her. They

look into each other's eyes.

They kiss. When they part there is a drop of blood on

Loretta's lips.

Their eyes are boiling with fierce animal tears. They have

opened their souls to each other and they are coming together.

The MUSIC SWELLS to a terrible triumph.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

Dog whines over exterior.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - AN UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

With five beds for dogs. Four of the beds are empty and on

the fifth Judas is whining. He looks around at the other

beds. Where is everybody? He goes out the bedroom door.

THE CASTORINI STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Judas is running down the stairs and into the hall. We FOLLOW

HIM down the hall. The hall is only dimly lit. He finds the

four other dogs. They are crowded at a narrow doorway.

From the doorway comes a golden light.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

THE PLEASED FACE OF COSMO THROUGH A VEIL OF STEAM

The CAMERA PULLS BACK.

We are in the Castorini dining room. Cosmo sits at the head

of the table, a napkin tucked into his shirt.

Rose has just laid down a massive platter of steaming baked

fish. Already on the table is a platter of pasta, loaves of

bread, a big bowl of salad, two bottles of wine, and an

appetizer plate of salami and pimento. Seated at the table

is COSMO, the Old Man, and RAYMOND and RITA CAPPOMAGGI.

Raymond is rotund, moon-faced, bald, somewhere in his fifties.

He has a pencil-thin mustache over his small mouth. His wife,

Rita, looks very like him, except she has hair on her head

and none on her lip. Raymond is Rose's brother. There are

two empty places at table, for Rose and Loretta.

ONE OF THE ENTRANCE WAYS TO THE DINING ROOM

There is an accordion gate across it. Behind the gate, the

Five Dogs stare at the people having dinner.

THE DINING TABLE - RITA IS LOADING UP HER PLATE

The Old Man has piled his plate high with food. Now he stands

up, walks over to the Dogs, and puts the plate down in their

midst. The Dogs attack the food and each other. The Old Man

walks back to the table and sits down. He looks down at the

empty place in front of him, a little sad.

Rose gets another plate from a sideboard and puts it in front

of the Old Man. He immediately, methodically begins to fill

his new plate. Rose goes to her place and sits down.

The Old Man laughs uproariously, subsides, goes back to

filling his plate.

Raymond stares at Cosmo, nodding, remembering. There's a

lull at the table, the SOUND of SILVERWARE.

The Old Man gets up with his newly filled plate and heads

for the Dogs.

The Old Man reverses direction and heads back to his chair.

He sits down and starts to eat.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

Over the house is a great big full moon.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The lights in the bedroom are still on. Cosmo is in bed, in

his pajamas, asleep. Rose comes in her nightgown. She looks

at Cosmo. He's snoring lightly.

He doesn't stir. She goes to him and runs her hand through

his hair.

She kisses his cheek. Then she turns out the lights. When

the electric lights go out, moonlight floods the room. She

goes to the window and looks out through the curtains at the

moon. Rose puts her face in her hands and quietly cries.

EXT. ROSE'S POV SHOT OF MOON FROM CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

RESUME INT. CASTORINI HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (Rose

crying.

INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The bedroom is flooded by moonlight. Loretta wakes up, a

little alarmed.

Ronny wakes up, a little alarmed.

Loretta goes to the window wrapped in a white sheet from the

bed. The window is glowing with moonlight. The moonlight

strikes her, and she is caught in its spell.

Ronny appears behind her, pulling on a robe. They speak in

low voices, as if they were in church.

She turns and looks at him. They kiss. They break apart.

Ronny looks up at the moon.

EXT. THE CAPPOMAGGI HOUSE NIGHT

Shot of the house with the moon overhead.

INT. RAYMOND AND RITA CAPPOMAGGI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

There is a big window right by the bed, and in the window is

the moon. Raymond and Rita are in their bed, asleep. Raymond

wakes up, and sees the moon in the window. He's stunned and

excited, but he too speaks in this low voice of respect.

Raymond smiles at her meekly.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

Over the house is still the great big full moon. The front

door opens and out comes the Old Man with the five Dogs.

The Old Man is in a greatcoat and a felt hat, and he's smoking

a cigar. He stops on the top step and lets go a huge plume

of cigar smoke. Then he starts off with the Dogs down the

street.

EXT.. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

The moon and nothing else. Then a cigar is thrown into it

and sends it shimmering. It was the moon reflected in water.

Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK and WE SEE the Old Man and the

Five Dogs are standing on a ruined pier. The moon gleams up

from the Hudson River. The Old Man speaks to the Dogs.

The Dogs do not howl. So the Old Man, by way of demonstration,

howls at the moon. He looks to the Dogs to follow suit. They

do nothing. He howls at the moon again.

The Dogs do nothing. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until

WE CAN SEE the whole pier, with the Old Man and the Dogs on

it, and the moon above them. The Old Man, frustrated now,

cries out.

The Dogs start to HOWL. The Old Man, pleased as the Mad Hatter

he is, laughs and laughs.

EXT. EAST RIVER - DAY

Transition from moon reflecting in the water to dawn.

INT. RONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

Morning sun floods the room. Close on Loretta, she wakes up.

Loretta jumps from bed, grabs her clothes to cover herself,

and backs into closet.

Loretta emerges from the closet, tucking in her blouse.

Loretta stares at him in alarm, slaps his face, then studies

his face to see the effect of the slap. She is dissatisfied

and slaps him again.

CATHOLIC CHURCH IN LITTLE ITALY - DAY

Camera moves from stained glass windows to confessional.

Loretta is next in line of THREE SINNERS waiting to go into

the confessional. A FORGIVEN WOMAN emerges from the curtained

booth and walks off to pay her penance. Loretta goes into

the booth.

INT. CHURCH - CONFESSIONAL - DAY

Loretta kneels. The slide opens and an OLD PRIEST'S FACE can

be seen in outline through the screen.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

Loretta comes out of the confessional and enters a pew. She

crosses herself. Then she recognizes the back of a woman's

head a few pews down. She gets up, walks down the aisle, and

kneels down next to her mother, Rose.

Rose starts to reply, but then decides it's not worth the

argument.

Loretta crosses herself quickly, gets up, and leaves. Rose

looks after, and then goes back to her prayer.

INT. CAMMARERI'S BAKERY - DAY

Feminine hands apply the final decorative touches of blue

icing to a wedding cake. Then the hands set the plastic bride

and groom on the pinnacle. The CAMERA PULLS BACK.

Barbara is viewing her handiwork, a wedding cake on a

stainless steel wheeled cart. She's in the back part of the

bakery. Barbara is pleased with her creation. We TRAVEL WITH

HER as she rolls the cart out to the front of the store where

Chrissy is waiting on a huge man named HARVEY. She hands him

a tiny box, which he takes meekly.

Harvey lumbers off as Barbara enters the front of the store

with the cake on its cart. Barbara calls Chrissy's attention

to the cake.

The PHONE RINGS. Chrissy answers it.

She hangs up.

Chrissy comes out from behind the counter. She's staring at

the cake.

Without warning, Chrissy whacks the little bride and groom

off the cake and on to the floor.

Barbara looks at her, shocked.

EXT. CAPPOMAGGI'S ITALIAN PROVISIONS - DAY

An Italian specialty store in Little Italy.

INT. CAPPOMAGGI'S STORE - DAY

Provolones and salamis hang from above. To the one side is a

deli counter, to the other a series of tables displaying

cheeses by the pound, packaged cakes, etc. In the back are a

few tables and a kitchen with counter. Up front, behind the

deli counter, stands Rita Cappomaggi in a blue apron.

Out by the tables, Raymond unpacks some jars of olives. In

the back, a TRUCK DRIVER can dimly be seen eating his lunch.

Loretta walks in.

He is walking towards the back now. He shouts to somebody in

the kitchen.

The women are left alone.

INT. A CHURCH BASEMENT

It's been set up for a church bazaar. There are several wheels

of fortune, many stuffed animals, coffee urns, cakes, a game

of ring toss, etc. AS THE CAMERA inventories the contents of

the various stands -- a LITTLE NUN sleeps in one of them --

we HEAR the Old Man's VOICE.

A TUB OF APPLES FLOATING IN WATER

An old, gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out, dries it

with a towel. The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING that the hand

belongs to Lucy, who is standing behind a table with the Old

Man and Felix. She hands the apple to the Old Man, who drives

a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer.

Then the Old Man hands this staked apple to Felix, who dips

it into a deep metal pot. It emerges shining with red candy

goo. Then Felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray

where a dozen already sit. They repeat this process. But the

Old Man, because his thoughts are elsewhere, takes forever

to drive the stake into the apple. This frustrates Felix.

The Old Man's eyes light up. He looks at Lucy.

INT. CAPPOMAGGI'S STORE - DAY

EIGHT NEAT STACKS OF MONEY BEING RUBBERBANDED

By a woman's hands. The last stack is topped with a filled

out deposit slip. The banded stacks are then stuffed into a

night-deposit bag. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a bit to INCLUDE a

ledger. A last entry is made, and the ledger is shut. The

CAMERA PULLS BACK more, and now WE SEE Loretta reaching for

her coat. She puts it on, picks up the deposit bag, and sees

Rita.

Loretta goes out the door, with Rita looking after,

thoughtful.

EXT. THE CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY

Loretta walks-down the street and comes to the CINDERELLA

BEAUTY SHOP, fidgets a moment, looks around to see if

anybody's looking, and goes in.

WE SEE her through the window talking to MILDRED, who handles

appointments. Mildred nods, points, and Loretta goes back

into the store.

INT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY

WE DISCOVER an uneasy Loretta sitting in a beauty chair with

BONNIE, her hairdresser about to start. Bonnie is a little

bored.

TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC STARTS HERE AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE

FOLLOWING SCENES. This music should convey that Loretta is

turning from a frumpy pumpkin into a sleek and beautiful

coach. Bonnie wakes up upon hearing this startling news and

gets very excited.

SHEILA, another beautician, joins Bonnie, and they both get

very excited and start showing Loretta and each other

magazines. They argue merrily about what they should do,

leaving Loretta far behind. A MANICURIST joins them, with

her stuff and starts soaking Loretta's nails.

A MONTAGE FOLLOWS

They're plucking her eyebrows.

They're cutting and dying her hair.

They're painting her nails.

EXT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP-DAY

Loretta comes out. Her hair is jet black and done in a much

more stylish way. She looks great. She looks around as if

she has committed a crime, and walks off quickly

EXT. A DOWDY DRESS SHOP - DAY

Loretta looks in the windows, is dissatisfied, and walks on.

EXT. A BOLD DRESS SHOP - DAY

A stylish dress shop called INSINUATION. Loretta looks in

the window, is intimidated, and walks on. A moment passes.

She reappears. Tentatively, she enters.

INT. INSINUATION - DAY

Loretta approaches a young woman, MER, who works there. Mer

is about thirty, trendily dressed, and French. Mer and Loretta

greet and talk. Loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey

what she wants, but the truth is she doesn't know what she

wants. Mer takes the situation in hand.

There follows a MONTAGE of Mer showing Loretta various

dresses, some outlandish, some beautiful, some

incomprehensible. Loretta tries on several of the dresses in

a big triple mirror. Some horrify her, some frighten her

because they're so sexy, one bores her. We don't see the

dress that she ultimately does buy.

EXT. INSINUATION - DUSK

Loretta walks out with a big shopping bag. She walks away

down the street.

WE FOLLOW Loretta away down the street. She comes to a BRIDAL

SHOP with a big bride dummy shown off in the window She stops

and looks at the bride. She walks close to the window and

stares in hard. Then she slowly backs up from the bride.

Two NUNS are walking by. Loretta, backing up from the dummy,

bumps into the Nuns. She's flustered, makes a brief apology,

and hurries away, casting a furtive last glance at the shop

window.

END OF MUSIC

THE TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC COMES TO A CLOSE.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DUSK

Night is falling. Loretta appears and enters the house.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT

As Loretta enters she drops her bag and, as she takes off

her coat, calls.

A SINGLE BARK is HEARD from the top of the stairs. She looks

up.

A WOODEN ACCORDION GATE SEALS OFF THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

Visible behind the gate are a couple of dogs.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Loretta goes through a door and into the kitchen. She opens

the refrigerator and a cabinet, and makes herself a scotch

on the rocks. She sips it and starts to HUM in an understated

way. She takes her drink and wanders out of the kitchen.

LORETTA WALKS INTO THE LIVING ROOM

She walks to each lamp in the room and turns it on. There

are many table and standing lamps throughout the room.

LORETTA IS LIGHTING THE FIRE

Which was already built in the fireplace. It catches on

nicely. She puts her drink down and gets a big standing

antique mirror on rollers from its place against the wall.

She wheels it to a central place in the room. Satisfied, she

picks up her drink again, leaves the room for a moment, and

then returns with her shopping bag. She throws it on a chair.

Then she goes to the stereo and looks through the albums.

She selects one and puts it on.

MUSIC

Loretta waltzes around in front of the mirror, flirting with

herself in a very serious way. She starts to unbutton her

blouse.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

The moon is overhead as music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA

SOARS UP CLOSE to the moon, until it completely FILLS THE

FRAME with its magic. The moon dissolves into:

INT. THE CASTORINI LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of LORETTA'S FACE as she puts the final touches on

her make-up. Music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA PULLS BACK.

WE SEE her full figure. She has changed into her evening

dress and put on her heels. She's swaying to the music. The

evening dress is sensational. She leans forward and kisses

the mirror.

WE SEE THE LIPSTICK KISS ON THE MIRROR

In the mirror, all around the kiss, is reflected the fire.

EXT. EAST RIVER NIGHT

The moon is reflected in the water as WE SEE the dock of the

night before. We can SEE Jersey lit up across the river.

But then something starts to replace Jersey. It's a huge

white liner coming down the river now, all of her lights

burning, heading back out to sea. FLASHBULBS go off along

the deck. We watch the length of the great ship pass as the

MUSIC PLAYS

END OF MUSIC

EXT. LINCOLN CENTER PLAZA - NIGHT

LINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA'S POV

CROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created

by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled

with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand

and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House.

Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left,

inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous

color.

LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN

The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.

She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights

up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger

jets.

Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher

into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her

eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water,

like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.

FROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER

Forming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for

its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing

quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite

side of the fountain, is Ronny.

He's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and

topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises

a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles

brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and

starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the

fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her

attempt at composure from, Ronny.

Ronny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around

the fountain's perimeter. He comes close to her.

He goes to kiss her. She takes a step back.

Ronny immediately relents, gently takes her arm, and they

walk off in the direction of the opera house.

ONE OF THE CHAGALL'S FROM IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE MET

Ronny and Loretta looking up at it.

Ronny and Loretta join the crowd streaming into the building.

INT. THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

Ronny and Loretta enter, giving tickets to usher.

INT. OPERA HOUSE - COATCHECK - NIGHT

Ronny and Loretta checking their coats. Ronny's coat is

already off, and he's helping Loretta off with hers. He hands

her coat to the CHECKER and pockets the check. Then he turns

and sees Loretta in her dress for the first time.

He's stunned by her beauty. He's at a loss. He mumbles.

His eyes are bright with tears. Loretta is touched and starts

to put her hand out to him. But she stops herself.

He takes her arm. They pass under the great chandelier and

go into the house.

THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

THE CAMERA PICKS OUT A SERIES OF COUPLES

The first couple is PEGGY and CLIVE, a very distinguished

pair of silver-haired lovers dressed magnificently. They are

in their seats, delighted to be where they are, holding hands.

Next is the CELEBRITY COUPLE. Maybe Jackie O and her son,

John. They are seated and people are looking at them.

Next is Cosmo and Mona. Cosmo is helping Mona to sit down,

something she could probably handle herself. He's wearing

good but old-fashioned suit. She is in a dress that makes

her look like a big piece of hard candy.

Next is Ronny and Loretta. They are sitting in the first row

of the First Circle; in other words, very good seats.

They are holding their programs. Loretta opens her program.

THE OPEN PROGRAM - LORETTA'S POV

The opera is LA BOHEME. But then the page fades away into

the dark as the house lights go down.

WE SEE RONNY AND LORETTA FROM BEHIND

Ronny leans his head toward her and whispers.

As the lights come up in the orchestra pit. The CONDUCTOR

takes his place. The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS. He bows and turns to

the orchestra. The OVERTURE begins and PLAYS UNDER NEXT.

EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

The OVERTURE PLAYS THROUGH this ESTABLISHING SHOT and then

FADES AWAY at the start of the NEXT SHOT. WE SEE Rose enter

the restaurant.

INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

The dinner crowd is in and most of the tables are occupied.

The entranceway door opens and Rose enters.

She's got herself up very nice. The host, JIMMY, quickly

approaches her. She's very dignified.

Jimmy leads her to a table for two against the wall.

He seats her.

Jimmy breezes off. There's another table-for-two against the

wall to Rose's front. WE SEE a woman's back from Rose's POV,

and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA,

is having an argument with the man across from her.

But the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and

the argument is too low to be made out. Bobo approaches Rose's

table.

Bobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table

catches Rose's attention again, and their argument becomes a

little louder.

Bobo reappears with the martini and serves it.

Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at

the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the

man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument

goes on.

Sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the

man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and

stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds.

When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to

Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his

50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the

earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with

beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and

apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables.

The Shy Waiter arrives to assist Perry in drying himself.

The Shy Waiter heads for the bar. For the first time, Perry

notices Rose.

They are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now.

The Shy Waiter serves Perry his drink.

The Shy Waiter goes.

He drops his posturing.

She nods.

ROSE AND PERRY ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THEIR DINNER

IN ANOTHER PART OF THE LOBBY DURING INTERMISSION Cosmo and

Mona are sitting on a bench.

He looks around.

He nods, still looking around.

Indicating the end of intermission. The Audience starts to

file back into the theatre.

EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHT

Rose and Perry emerge from the restaurant.

They set off to the left.

OUTSIDE LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT

Rose and Perry are walking towards camera. Rose stops short,

stunned and alarmed by what she sees before them.

EXT. STREET II - INTERSECTION OUTSIDE OF LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT

The Old Man pulls up the Dogs. Aghast by what he sees before

him.

EXT. STREET III - INTERSECTION OUTSIDE LAUNDROMAT

Perry and Rose face the Old Man and the dogs.

In a silent standoff. Perry is puzzled, but has the sense to

say nothing. After a long moment, the Old Man silently steers

his dogs past them. He walks away down the dark street,

silently disappearing into the gloom. Perry and Rose never

move, but follow his slow progress until he disappears.

INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

THE STAGE - THE OPERA IS IN PROGRESS

It's the SCENE in which MIMI is standing in the falling snow.

She SINGS to RUDOLPH. It is a beautiful, poignant moment.

The snow is falling, falling. Mimi is SINGING her

heartbreaking aria of farewell. The lighted tavern window is

behind them, glowing with a golden light.

WE SEE RONNY'S FACE

He's staring intently at the stage with shining eyes. He

wants to share this moment with Loretta, but he is timid she

will not feel as he does.

WE SEE LORETTA'S FACE

A single tear trails down her cheek. Otherwise, she is almost

succeeding in hiding that the opera is moving her. She notices

Ronny's hand creeping towards hers, but makes no move towards

it.

THE STAGE - MIMI STILL SINGING SADLY IN THE SNOWFALL

She and Rudolph join hands.

RONNY AND LORETTA

grab each other's hand fiercely.

At last, they look at each other. She is admitting that she

is affected by the opera. He is grateful that she admits it.

INT. OPERA HOUSE - AUDIENCE  NIGHT

Audience exits.

INT. OPERA HOUSE-LOBBY - NIGHT

The lobby overflowing with the AUDIENCE coming out.

INT. OPERA HOUSE - COATCHECK - NIGHT

Ronny and Loretta at the coatcheck. Loretta dabs her eyes

and blows her nose.

Ronny gets the coats and helps her on with hers.

Ronny is putting on his coat.

Loretta has stopped suddenly, transfixed by the sight before

her.

Loretta and Ronny are standing face-to-face with Cosmo and

Mona. Mona's wearing a coat like a wrapper for hard candy.

Cosmo is wearing his coat and has his hat in his hand.

Stunned at seeing Loretta, he unconsciously puts his hat on.

Then he thinks about it and takes it off again. He looks at

Ronny. Then he looks at Mona.

Ronny looks at Loretta. He waits to follow her lead.

Mona obeys after looking curiously at Loretta.

Cosmo approaches Ronny.

He takes Loretta's arm and steers her a distance away for a

confidential exchange.

Cosmo puts on his hat again. He glares at Ronny. He looks at

Loretta, but he's at a total loss. At last, he stalks off.

Loretta looks after him, angry and disturbed.

COSMO AND MONA GOING OUT THE DOORS FROM LORETTA'S POV

LORETTA LOOKING AFTER THEM, STRICKEN

Ronny appears at her side, solicitous.

Loretta, still looking after, slowly shakes her head.

EXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

Rose and Perry stand on a sidewalk under a street light dimly

shining. About half a block away stands the Castorini house.

They regard it. Over the house hangs the moon, cut through

now with a sharp grey cloud. Rose and Perry's VOICES can be

heard.

The SOUND of the WIND can be heard rising up.

NOW WE SEE ROSE AND PERRY CLOSE UP

The rising cold wind stirs their hair. They both shiver

slightly.

She kisses him on the cheek.

He kisses her on the cheek.

She walks away, towards the house. Perry, shivering, looks

after.

INT. THE BOERUM CAFE - A BROOKLYN BAR - NIGHT

Ronny and Loretta sit at the bar. They are just finishing a

couple of Old-Fashions. The barman, AL, inspects their drinks.

Al nods and walks off. Ronny leans forward to Loretta.

EXT. A COLD AND EMPTY MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT

Ronny and Loretta are walking. Their breath is coming out in

long plumes.

They walk in silence for a moment, then Loretta speaks.

Her eyes are full of tears.

EXT. RONNY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

She looks. It's Ronny's building.

She looks for his response. He makes none.

He shakes his head.

Loretta follows Ronny into his building.

NOW WE SEE THE STREET

Just as the door shuts. A moment passes. Lights go on in

Ronny's apartment. Out of a doorway on the opposite side of

the street steps the figure of a woman. She walks to the

middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted

windows.

NOW WE SEE THE WOMAN CLOSE UP -- IT'S CHRISSY FROM THE BAKERY

Her heart is about to break. She loves this man. She looks

up at the lighted windows, her feelings hanging by one

slender, slender thread.

MUSIC

It's "MIMI'S ARIA"- from the snow scene in LA BOHEME.

WE SEE THE STREET WITH THE FIGURE LOOKING

At the lighted window above. "MIMI'S ARIA" PLAYS. This tableau

reminds us of the scene in the opera where MIMI stands in

the snow. The MUSIC PLAYS and the WOMAN SINGS for a long

moment. Then, the lights in the apartment go out. Chrissy

shudders almost imperceptibly. Her heart has broken. She

hangs her head. Then she lifts her head and slowly walks

away down the street.

EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - RUNWAY - NIGHT

With a great and abrupt ROAR, a big jet is landing.

INT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT

PASSENGERS are pouring into the terminal from the plane.

Most of them are Italian or Italian-Americans. Suddenly, Mr.

Johnny appears out of the shifting crowd, up very CLOSE to

the CAMERA. He looks alert, determined, geared up for action.

MR. JOHNNY AT THE LUGGAGE CAROUSEL

He pulls his two suitcases off the carousel with one quick

powerful jerk.

EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT

Mr. Johnny sticks out his hand and a cab immediately rushes

to him.

INT. OF THE CAB

Mr. Johnny leans forward to the DRIVER and says in a very

definite, determined way.

EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

The cab rushes off into the night.

EXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT

The cab pulling up to the Castorini house. The living room

windows are all lit up. VICKI CARR can be made out SINGING

"IT MUST BE HIM". Mr. Johnny gets out of the cab, gets his

luggage, and heads for the front door. He RINGS THE BELL.

The door opens. It's Rose. MUSIC floods out around her.

Rose is a little tipsy.

She holds the door open for him and he goes in past her

carrying his suitcases. She closes the door.

INT. CASTORINI HOUSE  THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT

INT. CASTORINI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

Rose comes in with two scotches on the rocks. He takes one.

She turns off the stereo, and then sits down across from

him.

There's a pause. Mr. Johnny is uncomfortable with it.

The front door can be HEARD SLAMMING, out of view, and then

Dogs can be HEARD BARKING. Mr. Johnny and Rose look to the

entranceway. The Old Man appears there, holding the Five

Dogs.

The Old Man looks at Rose. He is a specter. He stares, and

then he makes a long low accusing NOISE. Then he disappears.

Rose leaps up, very excited.

The FRONT DOOR SLAMS again. Mr. Johnny and Rose look to the

entranceway. Cosmo appears there.

Mr. Johnny stands up. Cosmo walks off, out of view.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAWN

We watch the effect of the sun coming up on the house. It

begins in darkness, and goes through the many graduations of

light very quickly until it's lit by the light of bright

morning.

THE FRONT DOOR OPENS AND THE OLD MAN AND THE DOGS COME OUT

He's got them on their leashes and, over his head, he carries

the black umbrella. He walks off toward the park and

disappears.

EXT. STREET - DAY - LORETTA IS WALKING

Along a sidewalk a couple of blocks away. She is a wreck.

She's still in her clothes of the night before. She hasn't

slept. Her hair's a bit funny. And she's tormented by the

complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks

great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has

a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is

slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched

in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING.

We follow her as she SINGS and walks.

WE WATCH LORETTA WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW

She's still muttering. She comes to a tin can. She kicks lt.

She comes to it again. She kicks it again.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY

Loretta appears kicking her can. She abandons the can and

enters the house.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Rose is at the stove. The kitchen is filled with steam and

sunlight. Rose is stirring a pot filled with oatmeal.

Another range has the coffeepot heating. Loretta shuffles

into the kitchen, goes to the tin table, and sits down.

There are red roses on the table. Rose sees Loretta.

Loretta is suddenly electrified.

With a long low MOAN, Loretta lowers her head to the table.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as Loretta

just was. He looks like hell, too. His hair is wild and he

hasn't slept. He's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown

leather gloves. He has a love bite on his neck, too. He starts

to SING "O SOAVE FANCIULLA". He SINGS it any old way,

occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just

muttering his way through. SINGS as much of it as he

remembers, which is a lot.

WE WATCH RONNY WALKING FROM THE BACK NOW

He's SINGING away, carelessly sauntering along. He passes an

ITALIAN COUPLE of middle age. They smile as they recognize

what he is singing. They start to SING along with him.

They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a

resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other

appreciatively and go on their ways, Ronny turning his back

to the CAMERA, and they WALKING INTO IT.

EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DAY

Ronny appears and approaches the door. HE KNOCKS, waits, and

then RINGS THE BELL. Rose answers the door and invites him

in.

INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN

Rose walks in with Ronny behind her. There's no one in the

kitchen. Rose calls out.

Loretta comes out of a closet, where she was hiding. She's

very surprised to see Ronny.

LORETTA continues arguing.

Ronny and Loretta sit down and Rose serves them oatmeal.

COSMO WALKS IN dressed for business. He regards the trio,

puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again.

Cosmo sits down. Rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of

him. He absently begins to eat it. A silence reigns. Then he

puls down his spoon.

Cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more.

The SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away.

THE OLD MAN WALKS IN

He looks at the assemblage. The assemblage looks at him.

He points at Rose. Then his pointing drifts to Cosmo and his

hand opens in a gesture of supplication.

The Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at

the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal.

He is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish.

The others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts

down her spoon. She looks at the table, but she is speaking

to Cosmo.

Everyone stops eating. A tremendous silence falls. An old

clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists

to the table and stands. He doesn't look at Rose during this.

Then slowly, he sits down.

She puts her hand across the table to him.

He slides his hand out and takes her hand. Slowly, he lifts

his eyes. Their eyes meet. It's the first time he's been

able to hold her gaze in this whole story. The DOORBELL RINGS.

Loretta's tone is fatal.

Rose gets up.

She goes to answer the door.

Loretta looks at her father.

It's a private moment.

But who appears at the kitchen door is not Johnny. It's the

CAPPOMAGGIS.

They have their coats on and they look very serious and

concerned and timid.

Loretta runs out of the kitchen and reappears with her

everyday bag. She takes out the night deposit bag and hands

it to Raymond.

Raymond covers his face to hide his emotion. Rita, meanwhile

is clearing the oatmeal bowls.

There is a general acknowledgment. Everybody wants coffee.

Rose passes out white mugs and begins pouring steaming drafts

of coffee. Raymond and Rita are standing. The rest are

sitting.

Rita nods. A silence.

Silence. Then the Old Man erupts.

The DOORBELL RINGS. And RINGS AGAIN. Everyone is frozen for

a moment, then Rita mobilizes.

She goes. Loretta puts down her coffee and deep breathes,

preparing herself.

She pushes away her coffee.

RITA APPEARS WITH MR. JOHNNY IN TOW

Rita continues into the room, leaving Mr. Johnny in the

doorway. He is in a dark, vested suit. He is a little

bewildered by the crowd of people, but succeeds in hiding

most of his discomfort.

The Old Man laughs a loud sudden laugh, and then subsides.

Loretta struggles and pulls off the ring.

Mr. Johnny retrieves the ring.

Ronny looks to Mr. Johnny a little sheepishly.

Mr. Johnny, in shock, hands it over to Ronny.

He kneels down before Loretta. He presents the ring to her.

She takes the ring. Ronny and Loretta kiss.

Ronny and Loretta enter into a long kiss. The Old Man starts

to cry. Cosmo leans forward to the Old Man solicitously.

Loretta pushes Ronny away, breaking the kiss. They have both

neglected to breathe the whole time they were kissing.

They are both gasping for air, especially Loretta.

But then she looks at Ronny, and lunges back to him, diving

into another kiss like a mermaid diving into the bluest ocean.

MUSIC

"O SOAVE FANCIULLA" from "La Boheme," COMES UP and engulfs

the lovers, the family, the world.

WE SEE the faces of the lovers swirl away into a golden and

diamond light, and

EIGHT FULL CHAMPAGNE GLASSES

Glistening in sunlight on the white tabletop. Into each is

dropped a lump of sugar. A bottle of recently employed bitters

sits nearby with its cap off (like a respectful peasant in

aristocratic company. And the roses in the center.

Now the CAMERA PULLS BACK. WE SEE the table is surrounded.

Cosmo is dropping the last of the sugar cubes in the last

glass of champagne. Rose is by him. Rita and Raymond are

side by side, as are Ronny and Loretta. The Old Man sits,

staring at his son, intent and approving. But where is Mr.

Johnny?

Everybody takes a glass. The Old Man takes one and gets up

The Old Man takes the glass and walks over to a corner of

the kitchen where Mr. Johnny, deeply disturbed and somewhat

catatonic, sits on a step-ladder.

But the Old Man, wise and merry and tough, presses the glass

on Mr. Johnny, who takes it.

COSMO, THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY NOW, LIFTS HIS GLASS

They all lift their glasses.

CLOSE-UP OF ROSE'S FACE

CLOSE-UP OF RAYMOND AND RITA

Rita nods.

A CLOSE-UP OF RONNY AND LORETTA DRINKING THEIR CHAMPAGNE

And looking into each other's eyes.

CLOSE-UP OF THE OLD MAN

Who knocks back his drink lustily, and then with a glittering

eye looks away from the table.

MR. JOHNNY FROM THE OLD MAN'S POV

Mr. Johnny sits without moving, holding his glass. A long

moment passes. Mr. Johnny is thinking. Then he nods to

himself. He lifts his glass and murmurs for no one to hear

CLOSE-UP OF THE OLD MAN LOOKING AWAY FROM MR. JOHNNY

And he laughs his laugh. This laugh could kill him. The CAMERA

PULLS BACK a little. He pounds the table and knocks over the

roses.
