1	EXT.    LATE 1942.    THE SAHARA DESERT.    DAY.

SILENCE.  THE DESERT seen from the air.  An ocean of dunes  for mile

after mile.  The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to

black.

An old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara.  Its shadow swims over the

contours of sand.

A woman's voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track.  Szerelem,

szerelem, she cries, in a haunting lament for her loved one.

INSIDE the aeroplane are two figures.  One,  A WOMAN, seems to be

asleep.  Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit.  THE

PILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet.  He is singing, too,

but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's

plaintive voice.

The plane shudders over a ridge.  Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF MEN

AND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks

and armored vehicles.  An OFFICER, GERMAN, focuses his field glasses.

The glasses pick out the MARKINGS on the plane.  They are English.  An

ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels furiously.

Shocking bursts of GUNFIRE.  Explosions rock the plane, which lurches

violently.  THE WOMAN SLUMPS FORWARD, slamming her head against the

instruments.  The pilot grabs her, pulls her back, but she's not

conscious.  The fuel tank above their heads is punctured.  It sprays

them both, then EXPLODES.

THE MAN FALLS OUT OF THE SKY, clinging to his dead lover.  The are both

ON FIRE.  She is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely.  He

looks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries

them slowly to earth.  Even his helmet is on fire, but the man makes no

sound as the flames erase all that matters - his name, his past, his

face, his lover...

2	EXT.    THE DESERT.    1942.    DAY.

THE PILOT HAS BEEN RESCUED BY BEDOUIN TRIBESMEN.  Behind them the

wreckage of the plane, still smoking, the Arabs picking over it.  A

SILVER THIMBLE glints in the sun, is retrieved.  Another man comes

across A LARGE LEATHER-BOUND BOOK and takes it over to the Pilot.  The

Pilot is charred.  His helmet has melted into his head.  He's oblivious

to this, cares only about the woman who crashed with him.  He twists

frantically to find her.  Two men pick him up and carry him across to a

litter where they carefully wrap him in blankets.

3	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

The Pilot is being carried across the desert.  A mask covers his face.

His view of the world is through the slats of reed.  He glimpses

camels, fierce low sun, the men who carry him.

4	EXT.    AN  OASIS.    DUSK.

The Pilot sees a man squat down beside him, takes a date from a sack

and begin to chew it.  Carefully, the Bedouin eases the mask from the

Pilot's face, leaving bandages of cloth and oil, but revealing a mouth.

He stops chewing and passes the pulped date into the Pilot's mouth.

Mouth to mouth.

4a*.	EXT.    DESERT.    DAWN.

THE CARAVANSERAI CROSSES THE DESERT, silhouetted against the dunes.

5	EXT.    AN  OASIS.    NIGHT.

The SOUND OF GLASS, of tiny chimes.  A music of glass.

AN ARAB HEAD APPEARS ON A MOVING TABLE IN THE DESERT.  It floats in

darkness, shimmering from the light of a fire.  The image develops to

reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang DOZENS OF

SMALL GLASS BOTTLES, on different lengths of string and wire.  He could

be an angel.

The man approaches the litter which carries the Pilot.  He's still in

the protective reed mask, wrapped in blankets.  The MERCHANT DOCTOR

stands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep

into the sand, then moves away, free of the yoke, which balances in the

support of the two crutches.  He puts some liquid in the Pilot's

tongue, whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll.  Then he slowly sets

about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the Pilot's

flesh.

The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and

MAKES A SKIN CUP with the soles of his feet, then leans back to pluck,

hardly looking, certain bottles, which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl

he'd made with his feet.  This mixture he uses to anoint the burned

skin.  Next he finds green-black PASTE - ground Peacock Bone - and

BEGINS TO RUB IT on to the Pilot's rib cage.  All the while he us

humming and chanting.  The bottles continue to jingle.

6*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    EARLY 1945.    DAY.

The sand gives way to trees, the jingling bottles to distant church

bells, as A CONVOY OF TWENTY TRUCKS - Red Cross vehicles and some

supply vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill road.  The war in Italy is

largely over and the Allies are moving up the country, the wounded and

supply lines slowly following.

7*.	INT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    DAY.

A young CANADIAN NURSE, HANA, sits in a truck full of patients.  Hana

pays special care to the PATIENT lying in the stretcher alongside her.

This is the PILOT - now known as THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  A web of scars

covers the Patient's face and body.  They have the quality of a livid

tattoo, magenta and green-black.  The hair has largely gone and the

effect is curious, lassoing his features, the strong nose, the eyes

liquid.  It's a warrior's face.  But he has no physical strength.  He

coughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road.

8*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.

A JEEP pulls out of the line and approaches the Red Cross truck

containing Hana and the Patient.  The horn blows and Hana looks out to

see it contains her best friend, JAN.  TWO YOUNG SOLDIERS sit up front,

one driving, both grinning.  Jan signals for Hana's attention.

Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS.  The two hands -

hers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side

by side.  They laugh at the effort.  Jan's GOLD BRACELET catches the

sun and glints.

The Jeep accelerates away.  Hana sighs to the patient.

Suddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a MINE.

The jeep is THROWN into the air.  The convoy halts and there's chaos as

soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles.  Hana runs the

other way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by

a soldier.

9*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    LATER.

-- and there's still chaos as two SAPPERS arrive on motorcycles.  One

of them, a SIKH, wears a turban.

The motorcycles arrive at the front of the convoy.  A nurse, MARY, is

helping a doctor, OLIVER, attend to the injured driver.  The other two

bodies are covered with blankets.  There's blood everywhere.  The Sikh

and his colleague pull out the paraphernalia of their bomb disposal

equipment.

10	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.

KIP, the Sikh Lieutenant, and HARDY, his sergeant, explore the road

ahead of the becalmed convoy, using saucer-like METAL DETECTORS and

HEADSETS.  Kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly focused as they inch

along the debris-strewn road.  He stiffens as he registers metal.  With

a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-caked surface.  Something

GLEAMS.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEET walks across his vision as HANA

HURRIES PAST, walking carelessly up the road.  It's so surreal that

neither man registers at first, and then Kip is shouting.

He arrives at Hana.  Then grabs her.  He'd like to slap her face.

By way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet.  Jan's

BRACELET lies in the mud.  Hardy bends down and collects the mangled

bracelet, presses it into Hana's hands.

11	EXT.    VILLAGE.    DUSK.

The CONVOY is threading through A RUINED VILLAGE, passing the souvenirs

of war.  An overturned vehicle now used as a game by some children,

dejected refugees tramping along the side of the road.  From the end of

one of the buildings are hanging HALF A DOZEN CORPSES, strung upside

down with crude placards denouncing, in Italian, their collaboration

with the Nazis.

12	INT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    CONTINUOUS.

Hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck, the Patient

swaying alongside her.  She puts out her hand to steady him.

13*.	EXT.    CONVOY SITE, ITALY.    DUSK.

THE CONVOY is making a PITSTOP.  The trucks are silhouetted in a line.

Hana helps lift the Patient's stretcher onto the ground.  She bends to

him.

The Patient nods.  Hana gets up to prepare MORPHINE INJECTION from a

small kit.  Mary arrives.  Touches Hana gently, conscious of her grief

for Jan's death.

Hana has settled down beside the Patient's stretcher.  She draws

herself up against the night.  On the hill above, she can see the

outline of A SMALL MONASTERY in the moonlight.  She's crying, her face

a frozen mask.

The Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand.

14	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

Hana is investigating the MONASTERY OF ST. ANNA, wandering through its

overgrown gardens, past a pond.  What sanctuary it seems to offer.

15*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.

Hana explores via a gaping hole in a LIBRARY where the walls have

collapsed from shelling.  The garden intrudes, ivy curls around the

shelves.  Bloated books lie abandoned, and there's a PIANO tiled up on

one side.  Hana presses the keys through the filthy tarpaulin which

covers it.  Everywhere there are signs of a brief German occupation.

15a*.	INT.    MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.

Past the Library is a CLOISTERS, drenched with silver light.

15b*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY STAIRS.    DAY.

Hana goes upstairs, negotiating a huge VOID in the stone treads two

thirds of the way up.

15c*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

She comes across a small CHAPEL, with the remains of murals and an

altar pressed into service by the Germans as a table.  Hana finds an

old bed, and a mattress.

16	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.

Hana comes out, passes a DRY WATER TROUGH.  She hears a rustling on the

gravel and turns to see A TORTOISE ambling towards the trough.  On cue

there's A GURGLING SOUND.  THE HANDLELESS PUMP IS SUDDENLY GUSHING,

splashing water everywhere.  The Tortoise, clearly arriving for this,

enjoys a welcome shower.  Hana goes to the trough, dips her hands into

the water.  Looks around her, and makes a decision.

17	EXT.    CONVOY SITE.    ITALY.    DAY.

The Convoy is in the final stages of loading up.  Oliver passes the

vehicles, deep in dispute with a determined Hana, who is carrying some

sacks of rice.

Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions,

then lays another blanket over the Patient.

Hana nods.  A tiny smile.  Oliver shrugs helplessly.

18*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

TWO SOLDIERS are helping Mary and Hana carry the Patient into the

monastery.  Hana indicates the stairs.

They struggle up the stairs, one of the Soldiers gasping as he narrowly

avoids falling into the void in the stairs.  The cot almost tips up, at

which the Patient SUDDENLY SPEAKS, his voice cracked and rasping, but

still clearly aristocratic.

Hana laughs.

Mary laughs.  They reach the landing.  Hana kicks open the door to the

CHAPEL.

18a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana lets Mary take the weight while she goes to the bed and pulls away

the drapes, sending up a cloud of dust.  They lower the Patient onto

the bed.  She turns to the SOLDIERS.

She shuts the door on them, leaving Mary staring aghast at the room,

its faded frescoes, its mold, its chaos.  Hana smiles, opens a shutter

to let a fierce envelope of light into the room.

19*.	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

A smaller upstairs room completely bare.  As Hana tugs off her uniform,

she looks out of the window to see the departing Convoy.  A cotton

dress goes on over her head and she emerges looking suddenly younger

and rather fragile.   THROUGH THE DAMAGED FLOOR OF HER ROOM SHE HAS A

VIEW OF THE PATIENT BELOW HER.  SHE LOOKS AT HIM.  NOW SHE HAS SCISSORS

AND STARTS TO CUT OFF HER HAIR, NOT AGGRESSIVELY, BUT IN A GESTURE OF A

NEW BEGINNING.

19a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

HANA walks down to the Patient's Room and stands in the doorway.  The

Patient turns his head to her.  He's grinning.  He puts up a thumb.  On

the track a song begins:  Some Other Time.

20*.	EXT.  BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.  1938.  LATE DAY.

THE SONG CONTINUED IN THE DESERT where we find the singer - PETER

MADOX, a weather-beaten man who is working on the guts of an BATTERED

TIGER MOTH AEROPLANE.  His face is blackened with oil.  A second

European, ALMASY, stands beside him, holding tools and a section of the

camshaft.  Madox yanks out a perished rubber hose and holds it up for

Almasy to inspect.  Behind them is an ENCAMPMENT - some camels foraging

in the meager scrub, half a dozen black tents of the BEDOUIN: guides

and servants to the Almasy/Madox Expedition.  It's 1938 and the whole

continent is full of such expeditions, competing with each other,

pursuing lost treasures, sources of rivers, hidden cities.

D'AGOSTINO, the team's Italian ARCHEOLOGIST, drives towards the plane

in one of the expedition's adapted FORD MOTORCARS.  He gets out

carrying a large earthenware WATER JAR.  He looks very pleased with

himself as he shows the jar to Almasy and then passes it to Madox.

He reaches for the jug, then pours out a little sludge - it's a

brackish and stinks.  Madox makes a face.

Madox and Almasy have seen many such jugs.

21	EXT.    POTTERY HILL.    DAY.

THE BASE OF A HILL SEEMS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF POTTERY JARS.

D'Agostino emerges over the brow of a dune, leading Madox and Almasy.

The other members of the team are already there - BERMANN, a German

PHOTOGRAPHER and FOUAD, EGYPTOLOGIST from Cairo.

They bend to touch the jars, literally hundreds of them, mostly broken,

piled on top of each other.  Bermann approaches them, carrying his

tripod.

Almasy speaks with a slight but unmistakable European accent.

Almasy gives him a look.  But Madox will have none of it.

The unmistakable buzz of AN AEROPLANE distracts them.

21a*.	EXT.    BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DAY.

LATER and a smart new aeroplane, a STEERMAN, makes a smooth landing on

the flat desert.  The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals.

Almasy is not with them.  He's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic.

A young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane.  They

are GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE CLIFTON.

And it's immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the plane-

crash at the beginning of the film.

Madox makes all the introductions.  Hands are shaken, hellos all round,

as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear.  Geoffrey removes

his helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture,

produces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off the cork with a flourish.

22	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    LATE DAY.

The party is in the shade of the tents.  Almasy joins the group.  Madox

nods over to the Clifton plane.

23	INT.  THE PATIENT'S ROOM.  THE MONASTERY.  MORNING.

The morning floods into the room.  The Patient lies, lost in the

desert.  Then a sudden CLATTERING NOISE disturbs him.

24	INT.   STAIRS, THE MONASTERY.   DAY.

Hana is dropping armfuls of books into the cavities of the damaged

stairs, and with others, she is improvising new steps.  The heavy

volumes are perfect for treading on.

25	INT.   LIBRARY.   DAY.

Hana comes in, gathers up another armful of books and carries them out

to continue her stair repairs.

26*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana enters.

Hana shrugs.  She's attending to him, pulling back the sheets, plumping

up the pillows.  He's short of breath.

Hana picks up the book and hands it to him.  Then she starts rummaging

in her pockets.

She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.

His mouth works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping

from the mouth.  Hana mops it up.

A noise, GURGLING sound, disturbs them.

27	INT/EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

Hana comes through the Cloisters into the garden as the gurgling

increases.  She's in time to catch the TORTOISE arriving once again in

the WATER TROUGH just as it starts to gush with water.  She shouts up

to The Patient's open window.

28	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Close on the HERODOTUS.  The Patient opens its cover, held together by

leather ties.  Loose PAPERS, PHOTOGRAPHS, HAND-DRAWN MAPS AND SKETCHES

are all collected between the pages.  He claws at some water-colors

which appear to be based on CAVE PAINTINGS - figures, dark-skinned

warriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with

plumes in their hair - arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like

those of Matisse.  Some appear to be swimming, another is diving.  Then

the Patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel SPILLS to

the floor with a crack.

29	INT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

A SHOT RINGS OUT, disturbing the evening meal.  Almasy and others go

outside.  Silhouetted on a ridge, a group of men sit astride camels.

One of them holds his rifle aloft, clearly pointing towards the sky -

means friend.  Fouad peers at the horizon.

30	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

ALMASY AND MADOX WALK OUT TO INTERCEPT THE ARRIVALS as the first Arab

dismounts, the procession of camels splaying out as if in collapse.

Almasy speaks in Arabic, exchanging the ritual greetings.

DURING THIS, FENELON-BARNES, sole European in this expedition, has

finally persuaded his camel to sit, and dismounts irritably, slapping

the animal in disgust.

approaching Madox)

31	INT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

The arrivals come inside.  Madox handles the introductions.

He takes a long drink from a bowl of frothing camel milk.

32	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    NIGHT.

Almasy, standing outside his tent, watches the merriment from a

distance.

D'Ag is nearing the end of a passionate rendition of  Puccini's E

Lucevan Le Stelle.  He sits down to much applause from the others and

SPINS AN EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE on the sand.  It comes to rest pointing

at Clifton who gets up, grinning, and plunges into Yes! We Have No

Bananas with great gusto.  His version involves CHANGING LANGUAGE

during each line of the chorus - prompted by Oui!  or Ja!  or Si!  from

the others.  Song finished, much bowing and guying, he spins the bottle

and it arrives equidistant between Fenelon-Barnes and Katharine - until

with a little NUDGE from the husband it settles on his wife.  Katharine

gets up, awkward.

Almasy looks uncomfortable.

The men all encourage her to continue her story.

33*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

- and Hana's voice CONTINUES THE STORY as she reads to the Patient who

listens, eyes closed, still in the desert.

She stumbles over the word.

34*.	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    NIGHT.

Almasy stares at her, framed by the velvet black sky.  Katharine turns

to looks at him.

Clifton makes a face of outrage.  For Katherine the story has

collapsed.  She wants it to be finished.

Almasy shrinks away from the fire, disappears into black.

35	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana looks up from the Herodotus, sees the Patient's eyes closed.

Gently touches his face and whispers.

And Hana closes the book, gets up, and blows out the lamp.

36	INT.   FENELON-BARNES TENT.   POTTERY HILL.   NIGHT.

PITCH BLACK and then A TORCH flickers on as Almasy enters Fenelon-

Barnes' tent.  He pulls apart his luggage, quickly and methodically.

He finds what he is looking for inside a trunk:  A LARGE FOSSILIZED

BRANCH; a collection of stone leaves, wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin.

Then he's distracted by a noise from Fenelon-Barnes' bed.  Almasy

stiffens, turns to investigate.  There's A LUMP in the cot.  A dog?

Almasy eases back the blanket to reveal a YOUNG GIRL, no more than

fourteen, bound hand and foot.  He holds the torch to her face.

37	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    MORNING.

The next morning.  Almasy and Madox prepare to take off.  As they talk

Clifton's Rupert Bear taxis past them, a wave from Clifton and

Katharine.  Madox is very disturbed by what Almasy is telling him.

He walks away to the nose of the plane.

He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.

38	EXT.    GILF KEBIR PLATEAU.    MORNING.

Both planes are scouting the Gilf Kebir region.  Geoffrey flies up

alongside Madox and wiggles his wings.  Madox waves.

They're flying over a distinctive group of GRANITE MASSIFS, Crater-

shaped hills.  The broken towers of the Gilf Kebir.  Almasy is

distracted by them.  He turns to Madox and points down, indicating they

should explore them.

Madox gestures to the Cliftons to PHOTOGRAPH the Massifs.  A THUMBS UP

from Geoffrey.

39*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.

Hana gives the Patient his injection, now she begins to change the

sheet.  The light streams in from the open window.  She looks up at the

green hills rolling away from the Monastery, the village in the

distance.

An awkward moment as she rolls him on to his back.  He grunts with the

pain.  She washes him very tenderly.

40	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDENS.    NOON.

The TORTOISE heads towards the trough, to the gurgling accompaniment.

It reaches the shade only to be greeted by the obstacle of some tennis

shoes, a frock.  It clambers over as the water begins to belch out.

Hana, naked, kneeling in the trough, receives the shower with a great

YELP of shivering joy.

41*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    NIGHT.

It's dark, but something is going on here.  Hana is caught by the stray

shafts of moonlight.  She is SCRATCHING something on the flagstones.

Her skirt is bunched up around her thighs.  She throws something in the

air.  It's a SPILE, used to tap into the maple tree for syrup.  It

lands with a crack.  Suddenly she is flying across the space, a hop, a

skip, a jump.  Then turns at the other end, dips for the stone, then

back again, in this blindman's version of HOPSCOTCH.

42*.	INT.    TRAIN.    ITALY 1944.    BEFORE DAWN.

AS HANA HOPS AND JUMPS IN THE SHADOWS SHE IS SUDDENLY ON A TRAIN IN

1944.  A HOSPITAL TRAIN ploughs through the night carrying the wounded

back to Naples.

Hana walks through a long carriage.  HER HAIR IS LONG.  She could be

ten years younger than the Hana at the Monastery.  And easy.  She stops

at the bunk of A NEW PATIENT.  Hana bends to the boy.  He's had

shrapnel in his legs and cheek.  She speaks softly to him.

She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.

He closes his eyes.  Is almost instantly asleep.  Hana smiles,

continues along the compartment.  VOICES CALL OUT.

away their joke)

She gets into a corridor.  Mary is coming the other way.  She carries a

blood-soaked bundle.  Hana questions her appalled expression.

43	INT.    RAILWAY STATION.    DAY.

The train is arriving.  Hana hangs out of a window, scouring the crowds

to find her sweetheart, STUART McGANN, a young Canadian Captain, who

seeing her runs up to her window.

She jumps out of the moving door and into his arms.

The Station is full of desperate people trying to make do.  the couple

hurry through, oblivious to anyone except each other.

44	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana lies alone in her bed covered by a curtain.  There's a sharp

NOISE.  She's very frightened.  She has her pistol under her pillow and

pulls it out, listens, holding her breath.  Another BANG.  She listens.

45	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S GARDEN.    DAY.

Hana has been reviving a vegetable patch.  She comes to garden.  CROWS

are feasting.  She's furious, shouts, runs at them.  Nature, wildness,

insisting on invading her peace.

46*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    GRAVEYARD.    MORNING.

Hana appears from the Cemetery, dragging A METAL CRUCIFIX.  It's bigger

than she is, and she drags it, as if approaching Calvary.  A MAN

WATCHER HER FROM A BICYCLE.  He's approaching fifty, grizzled and

attractive, and could be Italian.  His hands are bandaged.  Hana aims

the cross at the soil, but is not quite bit or strong enough.  The man,

CARAVAGGIO, chooses this moment to introduce himself.  He drops the

bicycle on the ground with a clatter.

Hana turns, startled and suspicious.

He goes to her and - putting a bandaged hand behind her ear - PRODUCES

AN EGG.  He beams, as does Hana.

During this he attempts the same thing with his other hand to Hana's

other ear.  THE EGG DROPS TO THE GROUND.  Cursing, he gets on his knees

and starts to scoop it up, preserving it.

47*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    KITCHEN.    DAY.

Hana has taken his eggs and put them into a bowl.  She beats them with

a knife picking out the bits of shell.  Caravaggio watches, takes in

how little food there is otherwise.  The table seems useful more as a

sewing area than for cooking - it's STREWN WITH ALTAR CLOTHS being sewn

into drapes.  On a tray on the table are TWO PHIALS OF MORPHINE from

the Patient's room.  As Hana turns to the stove, he's moved and covered

them with his bandaged hands, a second later and he's juggled them into

his pockets with the slightest clink.  Hana looks at him.  He shrugs,

nods at the eggs.

48	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana carries in a tray.  There's OMELETTE on the plate.

into tiny pieces)

The Patient says nothing.  She puts a spoonful of the omelette into his

mouth.  He grunts.

49	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    STAIRS.    DAY.

50	EXT.    CAIRO MARKET.    1938.    DAY.

A STREET MARKET in full sway, a locals-only affair, blazing with noise

and bustle and barter.  Emerging from a thicket of women and begging

children, KATHARINE CLIFTON carries her purchase of an exotic-looking

RUG.  From nowhere she is joined by Almasy.

He stands as she continues, pushing past him, shrugging off the

children, boiling.

51	INT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    CAIRO.    EVENING.

THE LONG BAR.  The Exploration Team are drinking at a table.  They are

not entirely off-duty - Almasy and Madox as ever ponder the maps.

Geoffrey Clifton appears, arms waving.

He sits down.   Madox hails the waiter.

bewildered expressions)

52	EXT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL TERRACE.    NIGHT.

Katharine appears with Geoffrey to join the arriving Explorers.  She

looks exquisite in her evening clothes.  Madox brings her to her seat.

There is dancing inside, and couples walk to and from their tables.

Katharine manages to produce a dazzling smile which includes everyone

except Almasy.

and then nodding at Almasy

before greeting the others)

He nods at Almasy.  Clifton appears tremendously relieved.

53	INT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    NIGHT.

THE BALLROOM.  A dance finishes.  Almasy takes over from D'Agostino to

partner Katharine.  They dance beautifully.  The others remain on the

terrace in deep conversation.

The dance finishes.  They walk back to their table, where Almasy leads

Katharine back to her seat next to Clifton.

54*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana, having already replaced the bedlinen, is standing on a stepladder

trying to hang home-made drapes around the bed as Caravaggio knocks

tentatively, then comes in.

And she exits.  The men consider her.

55*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S ROOM.    DAY.

As Hana walks up her stairs she finds herself overhearing their

conversation as it threads up through the hole in the ceiling.  She

strips her own bed of the curtain she uses for a sheet.

56*.	EXT.    BEACH CABIN.    ITALY.    DAY.    1944.

HANA IS STILL LISTENING BUT NOW SHE'S OUTSIDE A CABIN.  She's in her

uniform, clearing things away.  The Cabin door is ajar.  An OFFICER

moves around, then sits to make notes.

THIS CONVALESCENCE HOSPITAL HAS BEEN FASHIONED FROM A LONG ROW OF

BATHING CABINS ON THE COAST, complete with Campari Umbrellas and metal

tables, at which are seated the bandaged and the dying and the

comatose, staring out to sea or in slow, muted conversation.  Hana

walks up to the Patient's cabin.  He is propped up with a view of the

sea, which is interrupted by the pacing Officer.  Hana has a blanket

and a chart for the Patient's bed.  She busies herself.

Hana pours him a glass of water.  He notices her.

his fingers)

Hana leaves, smiling at the Patient's irascibility, sharing this with

the Officer, who frowns.  The interview continues.

57	EXT.    BEACH CABIN.    DAY.

Hana walks between the cabins.  STUART steps out of the shade.  He is

drawn, older than last seen.

Hana frowns, helpless.  As if to emphasize this, a Staff Nurse comes

by, carrying a bowl and a withering look.

58*.	INT.    BEACH CABIN.    DAY.

She hurries out, returns with Stuart.  They stand awkwardly.

And with that he bursts into a raucous, coughing version of Yes! We

Have No Bananas.  He changes language each verse.  The couple stand,

formal, then edge round to the back of the bed.

They EMBRACE, fiercely, hardly making a sound, or moving.  THE PATIENT

ROARS THE SONG.

59*.	EXT.   THE MONASTERY.   HANA'S GARDEN.   MORNING.

A battered open backed TRUCK comes into the Monastery.  An ITALIAN

PARTISAN sits in the back, a SHOTGUN resting on his knees.  The truck

stops, and Caravaggio emerges from the passenger door.  He collects

some packages from the PARTISAN, including a dead RABBIT, and then

exchanges a few words with the driver.  Hana, who's watching all of

this from her garden, sees that the driver is a WOMAN.  The woman's

name is GIOIA, and Caravaggio leans into the window to make his goodbye

to her.

Caravaggio approaches the Vegetable Garden as Hana comes to greet him.

He throws her the rabbit, and hurries up the stairs without pausing,

clutching the other boxes.

Hana calls after him.

Hana looks at the rabbit.  She's angry.  Caravaggio hasn't been around

for a week.

60*.	INT.  THE MONASTERY.  DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR.  DAY.

Hana heads up for the kitchen, then stops as there's a faint CRASH from

upstairs.

61*.	INT.   THE MONASTERY.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR.   DAY.

Hana, the rabbit still in her hands, comes along the corridor to find

Caravaggio SLUMPED on the floor, retching.  The discarded NEEDLE lies

beside him, the new package of MORPHINE CAPSULES ripped open.  He looks

up at Hanna, glazed.

She bends, starts clearing up, putting the morphine phials back into

the box.

He pulls out more phials from his jacket.

62*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana comes in, carrying a batch of the new morphine.  She's wearing a

different FROCK.  It's not new, and it's faded, but the change of color

is startling.

63*.	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.

Almasy squats with an ANCIENT ARAB outside his rudimentary house, while

he draws on the sand, talking in some arcane dialect, scratching out a

possible location for the lost oasis.  The man stops speaking and

scours the sky a beat or two before we or Almasy hear the faint noise

of a PLANE.  It's Clifton's Steerman, Rupert Bear, coming in to land.

Almasy doesn't look up.

The Arab continues to talk.  The newly-arrived Katharine has scrambled

up the hill to speak to Almasy.

She makes to leave but Almasy puts up a hand to keep Katharine there,

but quiet.

The Arab shrugs.

The Guide speaks, amplifying something, picking at his robe.

He shrugs.  The Arab has more to say.  Almasy doesn't respond, quieting

him with a dismissive gesture.

The Arab speaks again.  Almasy speaks without looking at her.

64*.	INT.    TENT.   BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.   NIGHT.

Katharine comes in.  Then, a beat, and Almasy.  Clifton is holding up

the champagne.

They toast the Cliftons.

65*.	EXT.     BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    MORNING.

As Clifton prepares to leave in the Steerman, Almasy approaches.

He settles into the controls.  Almasy watches the plane taxi away.

Doesn't move at all.  Katharine waves from the tent as the Steerman

takes off.

65a*.	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.

The THREE FORD CARS leave the campsite, loaded for a scouting

expedition.  The rest of the party, Bedouin, tents, camels and Tiger

Moth is left behind.  Madox shouts last-minute instructions from the

window of his car.

66*.	EXT.    DESERT EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

FENELON-BARNES sits astride his camel, and wipes away the sweat.  The

desert stretches for miles, shimmering, the sun baking the sand.  His

GUIDES wind their headcloths tighter.  Nobody speaks.  Then one of them

looks round, raises a hand.  A BUZZING noise.  They all turn.  A SMALL

CLOUD OF DUST EMERGES OVER A RIDGE.  Locusts?  A sandstorm?

A CARAVAN OF CARS, the Almasy/Madox expedition, bumps along,

suspensions threatened by the constant dips and ridges.  On each car

there are three in the passenger cabin, the open backs crammed with

drums of gasoline and water and equipment.  On the front vehicle, the

tenth member of the party, KAMAL, acts as a navigator and sits on a

CAMEL SADDLE, a rodeo cowboy, on the roof of the leading car, driven by

Madox.  As they spot FENELON-BARNES they sound their horns and wave

good-naturedly.  F-B scowls, watches them roar by, stealing his

thunder.

66a*.	EXT.  DESERT EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   DAY.

ONE OF THE CARS IS HOPELESSLY BOGGED DOWN IN HEAVY SAND.  It's contents

have been unloaded, and a rope ladder is being inserted under the

tires.  The entire company huff and puff and argue about the best means

of extricating the vehicle.

67*.	INT.    CAR EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

LATER - Almasy drives the second car, accompanied by Katharine and Al

Auf.  Katharine breaks the long silence.

Almasy doesn't answer.  Katharine, who has looked at him for an answer,

looks away.  There's another long silence.

Point made, they lapse again into silence.  Katharine boils.

Almasy asks Al Auf in Arabic.  He laughs, nods.

Al Auf nods and grins furiously, joins in, impersonating Almasy.

Almasy grunts in irritation.

68*.	EXT.  NEAR THE BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.  DUSK.

The group is investigating a cleft in the rocky massif.  They climb

slowly.  Below them, A NEW AND TEMPORARY BASE CAMP.

The group winds around the rock.  Almasy turns to offer a hand to

Katharine behind him, pulling her up to the next rock slab.  She smiles

at him.  He smiles back curtly, continues.

The group stops at a level plateau.  The Arabs stand apart and SING

THEIR PRAYERS AT DUSK.  Al Auf leads the incantations.

The westerners wait respectfully.  As the sun sets in glory, Almasy

looks over at the range of rocks.  One particular range seems to look

exactly like A WOMAN'S BACK.  He squints at the rock.  Almasy

discreetly pulls out his COMPASS.

69*.	EXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DUSK.

Almasy clambers up the rocks, coming through a narrow crevice to find A

NATURAL SHELF.  He scrambles up this path, reaching up, only to notice

that his hand almost perfectly covers A PAINTED HAND on the rock, and

as he digests this he realizes he has climbed past what is THE MOUTH OF

A CAVE.  He disappears inside.

70	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.

A FLASHLIGHT squirts into the cave.  Almasy treads cautiously along the

narrow winding passage.  He comes to an open cavern and takes his

flashlight up to a wall.  PAINTINGS EMERGE, figures, animals,  ancient

pictures.  A giraffe.  Cattle.  Fish.  Men with bows and arrows.

Almasy is astonished by what he sees.

71*.	EXT.    NEAR THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    EVENING.

The others watch as a flashlight bobs and jerks among the rocks as

Almasy comes scrambling down, transformed into an excited teenager.

He slithers in a heap in front of the astonished expedition party.

Doesn't care.

72	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.

Almasy has led the whole party into the heart of the cave.  Now Madox

comes alongside him at the wall, his flashlight joining Almasy's and

increasing the visibility of the paintings.  A dark-skinned figure,

apparently in the process of DIVING into water, comes clearly into

view.  Then others supine, arms outstretched.

The others crowd round.  FIVE EXCITED FACES IN THE GREEN GLOOM OF THE

CAVE.

73*.	EXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

A hive of activity.  The team has set up TRESTLES to catalogue the

finds as the Bedouin come out with baskets of detritus, which they

empty onto a growing heap as the Cave is cleared out.  Entering the

cave, Almasy passes with camera equipment, just as D'Ag emerges

carrying the corpse of a perfectly preserved DESERT FOX.  D'Ag gestures

to Almasy with his customary enthusiasm, holding up the body of the

fox.

74	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Inside, Bermann is setting up LAMPS, running wires from a car BATTERY.

Kamal is helping him.  And as Almasy arrives he catches a tiny moment

of tenderness between them.  Bermann, seeing him, quickly disengages

and busies himself with the lights.  At another wall, Katharine is

catching.

75	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

The CARS are heading back to Basecamp.  They bounce over the sand.

76*.	INT.    BERMANN'S CAR.    DAY.

Bermann is driving the lead CAR along some STEEP DUNES.  Almasy beside

him.  Bermann is peeling AN ORANGE, a segment of which he holds out of

the window.  Kamal, riding shotgun, leans down and collects it, his

head dipping in to grin at Bermann.  Bermann looks uneasily as Almasy.

He wants to tell him of his passion, of his absolute love for Kamal,

but he daren't.

Bermann holds out another segment of the orange, and watches the slim

brown hand collect it.  A MOMENTARY DISTRACTION IS ALL IT TAKES FOR HIM

TO MISJUDGE THE LINE AND SUDDENLY THE DUNE COLLAPSES UNDER THE TIRE AND

THE CAR LURCHES SIDEWAYS AND TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE.  D'Ag - following,

Fouad beside him - brakes sharply, but can't stop his own car from

being caught in the avalanche of sand, and IT PLUNGES DOWN THE DUNE AND

INTO BERMANN'S UPTURNED CAR WITH AN OMINOUS CRUNCH, the radiator

exploding.  Only Madox, Katharine beside him, and a little way behind,

manages to stay clear of the trouble.  He jumps out of the vehicle and

slides down the dune to find pandemonium as the passengers stumble out

of the cars, sand flying, smoke pouring from the upright vehicle, the

wheels of the overturned car spinning wildly in the air, a puddle of

oil spreading ominously.

77*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

LATER and the group have cleaned up as best as possible.  D'Ag,

Bermann, and Fouad are a little worse for wear.  Fouad's arm is in a

sling, and D'Ag is sporting a bloody head-bandage.  Bermann has broken

a finger and is being attended to by Madox.  The luggage, water and

petrol have been stacked up and the men are loading up the remaining

car.  Almasy is working at the crumpled end of the vehicle.  He's

having no success.

78*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

Almasy, Kamal and two of the other young Bedouin stand around the mess

of the two broken vehicles.  The ONE WORKING CAR is loaded with men and

provisions.  Katharine sits inside, next to Madox, Almasy comes over to

her window, to speak past her to Madox.

to the wrecked vehicles)

This is Bermann's cue to take leave of Kamal who is staying behind.

Kamal makes a little bow.

Bermann nods and hurries away, squeezing into the car which jolts off,

bouncing over the track.

THE VEHICLE GETS ABOUT TWENTY YARDS, ALMASY WATCHING, BEFORE IT SINKS

FORLORNLY INTO THE SOFT SAND.  IT'S HOPELESSLY OVERLOADED WITH PEOPLE.

THEY ALL GET OUT.

It's hard to argue with this logic.  Almasy shrugs.

LATER - THE MADOX CAR makes a more effective departure.  And Almasy and

Katharine are left alone.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER as if realizing this

for the first time.  Almasy immediately returns to the two damaged

vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent

TO FASHION A MAKESHIFT SHELTER BETWEEN THE TWO CARS.  Katharine goes to

join them.  There is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles

of undulating dunes.

79	INT.    SHELTER.    DAY.

Almasy sits alone, writing into HIS HERODOTUS, a map folded in front of

him, from which he makes notes.  Katherine comes across with a clutch

of her SKETCHES from the Cave wall.  Hands them to him.  They're

beautiful.

She's already turning, walking as far from him as the cramped shelter

permits.  He continues with his maps.

80	EXT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.

Katharine sits alone on top of the Dune, smoking, surveying the

landscape.  Below her the makeshift camp - a fresh wind flicking at the

tarpaulin, THE DEEP TRACKS OF MADOX'S CAR STRETCHING OFF TOWARDS

CIVILIZATION.  Almasy emerges from the tent and, locating Katharine,

heads towards her.

Katharine turns, scans the horizon.

He offers a hand.  A little reluctantly she takes it.

81	EXT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.

The team hurries around the improvised tent, weighing it down with

packing cases, gasoline drums, water cans, bringing anything loose or

light inside the tarpaulin.  THE WIND is whipping up, the air busy with

sand.  Almasy pushes everyone under cover.

82	INT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.

THE SAND SEEMS TO BE SCOURING THE TARPAULIN.  Kamal and Almasy try to

secure one vulnerable area, but suddenly there are leaks everywhere and

the sand swarms inside.

It's noisy, too, and Almasy has to shout to make himself understood,

indicating to the Bedouin to grab water and blankets and food, all the

valuables, and get out.  He himself finds blankets and water and shouts

at Katharine to do the same.  One side of the canvas suddenly RIPS

apart like paper. Chaos as figures struggle in ever-worsening

conditions, sand blizzarding the air.

83	EXT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.

THE SHELTER FLIES INTO THE AIR, stranding the figures, their heads

wrapped in blankets, flashlights useless.  They seek safety in two

groups, the tribesmen to the cabin of the overturned car, Katharine and

Almasy to the upright one.

84	INT.    CAR.    NIGHT.

Inside the cabin, the sand swirling around them, Katharine and Almasy

sit without speaking.  Dawn is trying to break through.  He pours a

little water into a mug so that they can wash out their eyes and noses

and mouths.  She takes her silk scarf and first dries her eyes with it,

then dries his.

85	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAWN.

The sand is piling up against the two cars, the tent is swept from its

moorings, the water cans are hurled up too, and then plunge ominously

into sand drifts as if going under an ocean.

And we hear Katharine's laugh.

86	INT.    CAR.    DAWN.

Almasy sits alongside Katharine, whose head is against his shoulder.

He continues his story of winds.

Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.

87*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

MORNING.  The sand has almost COMPLETELY ENGULFED the car on the

exposed side, covering the windshield like snow, and encroaching onto

the door of the protected flank.

88*.	INT.    CAR.    DAY.

Almasy is woken by sound of A DISTANT ENGINE.  He jerks up, waking

Katharine in the process, and heaves against the door.  He can't open

it, and has to lean his feet against the passenger door, lying across

Katharine, kicking it open.

89*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

By the time Almasy emerges from the car, the sand pouring into the

cabin, MADOX'S CAR IS ROARING ALONG THE HORIZON.  Almasy waves, shouts,

and then runs back into the car, finds his flare-gun, and SENDS A FLARE

high into the sky.  Katharine is with him now, and they watch,

helplessly, as the car bounces away from them, Madox a man on a

mission.  Katharine panics, THE SAND HAS ERASED ALL TRACES OF THEM.

She speaks quietly, shocked.

Almasy is preoccupied.  He's gone back to their vehicle and returns

with a shovel, STARTS TO DIG FRANTICALLY.

She kneels with him and helps to shovel away the sand WHICH HAS

COMPLETELY ENGULFED THE OTHER VEHICLE containing the three Bedouin.

the boys, egging himself on)

They hear NOISES, scrabbling, faint thumps.  Almasy scrapes at the sand

and they find the glass of the car.  The angle of the cab, tilted up to

the sky, has made it impossible for the trapped boys to lever it open.

Their oxygen is rapidly deteriorating.  Almasy pulls the door and it

cranks open.

90*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

Katharine sits in the car, putting her pictures into the Herodotus.

It's full of ALMASY'S HANDWRITING, PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME PRESSED FLOWERS.

She deciphers a page of his words and drawings.  It's almost

exclusively about her, the lines studded with K.s.  She reads,

astonished, then looks at him as he and two of the three Bedouin circle

the area of the cars in ever-widening circles, like water-diviners,

like Kip searches for mines.  Kamal is slumped against the front of the

car.  He's sick.  Almasy suddenly drops to his knees and begins to

shovel into the sand.  He pulls out A CAN OF WATER.  Turns to Katharine

and holds it triumphantly in the air.

91*.	INT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.

There's a small, weak fire.  The group crouch around it.  The boys talk

noisily to Almasy.  Kamal is wrapped in a blanket and shivering.

Almasy gives him water, speaks to Katherine.

He gets up and loads the flare with what is clearly the last charge.

This time the effect is dramatic with A RED UMBRELLA OF LIGHT.

Katharine comes up beside him.  They wait, hope fading with the flare.

There's a beat.  Katharine has a hundred answers.

The light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the dark.

Suddenly on the far horizon, behind their heads, AN ANSWERING FLARE

fireworks into the sky.

There's excited shouting from the two fit boys.  They leap up and run

towards the couple, who meanwhile have realized that the flare has not

come from Madox, but from an approaching CAMEL CARAVAN.  Almasy shouts

to the boys for some identification.

The Caravan slowly comes into focus.  IT'S FENELON-BARNES.  Katharine

touches Almasy's arm - an almost imperceptible gesture.

Almasy turns to her.  He runs the blade of his arm across her neck -

the sweat leaving a clear stripe.

Fenelon-Barnes approaches, dismounts from his camel, and addresses

Almasy.

A goatskin bag of water is offered to Katharine.  She drinks and hands

it to Almasy.

92	EXT.    CAIRO.    DAY.

ANOTHER WORLD as a honking TAXI containing Almasy and Katharine

negotiates the incredible bustle of Cairo.

93	EXT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    DAY.

Almasy, still in the same clothes, and evidently weary, emerges from

the cab, and pulls Katharine's belongings from the trunk, then holds

open the door for her.  As she walks towards the hotel, he hands her

bag to a porter.  Katharine is stung.

Katharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him, then

disappears.

94	INT.    ALMASY'S ROOM.    DAY.

Almasy lying on a camp bed, face down.  The walls are covered with

maps, enlargements of photographs.  A fan whirs over his kit which is

spread, unraveled but ordered, on the stone floor.  An ineffably male

room, the shutters closed, just the thinnest shaft of light piercing

the gloom.  Almasy hasn't even removed his clothes, his boots kicked

off below his jutting feet.

There's A KNOCK at the door.  Almasy sleeps.  Another.  A third.  He's

roused from the dead.  Stumbles to his feet, opens the door as the

knocking continues.

It's Katharine.  She's bathed, luminous, stands back-lit by the

afternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress.  She walks past him into

the room.  He closes the door.  She turns.  He KNEELS before her, head

at her thighs.  She's crying, her face expressionless as her hands go

to his head.

She starts to BEAT on his head and shoulders, violently.  He pulls

back, to look at her, the tears streaming down her face.  She kneels

and covers his face with kisses.  He pulls blindly at her dress and it

RIPS across her breasts.

95*.	INT.    BATHROOM.    DAY.

Almasy is in the bath.  Katharine, wearing his dressing gown, pours in

a jug of steaming water.  Almasy leans over the rim of the bath.  He's

sewing, carefully repairing the torn dress.

She pushes the sewing from his hands, then pours water over his head,

then begins to shampoo his hair.

Almasy is in heaven.  The biggest smile we have seen from him.  She

continues to massage his scalp.

She rinses his scalp, then slips off the robe and CLIMBS IN BESIDE HIM,

covering his neck and shoulders in kisses.

She freezes, pulls herself away, out of the bath, looks at him, then

SLAPS HIM VERY HARD across the face.

She picks up her dress, the thread and needle dangling from it, and

walks, dripping, out of the room.

96*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

To the Patient it's as if Katharine is walking out of his wall.  He

sighs with pain, then looks away to where Hana has fallen asleep on the

bed, almost on top of him.  He touches her.   He speaks as if each word

burns him.

97*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.

Hana comes to the table, carrying a jug of water and a bowl.   She's

still sad.  She unbuttons her dress, pulling it off her shoulder,

begins to pour the water to cool herself against the night's pressing

heat.

98*.	EXT.    EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.   1944.    LATE DAY.

The EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL is a cluster of tents practically ahead of

the Front Line SPORADIC GUN FIRE, LIGHT AND HEAVY, SOUNDS THROUGHOUT.

Mary walks by on her way to the Nurse's tent.  It's 1944 and the war in

Italy is still intense.

99	INT.    EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL TENT.    LATE DAY.

JAN is washing out of her HELMET, and stands naked in her socks.  Hana

is using a flannel to wash Jan's back.  A couple of other girls like,

exhausted, on their cots.  The mud is everywhere.  Another nurse is

making tea out of an adapted plasma can on their tiny primus.

MARY comes in and flops down.  She's GIVEN BLOOD and is pale and

enervated.

100	INT.  TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.  NIGHT.

Hana walks through the main TRIAGE TENT.  It's packed with the ruined

bodies of the injured, swaddled in bloody bandages.  Hana stops at a

couple of beds, shares a word or two with the patients.  She stops at

another bed, leans over its occupant.  His bandaged face is bloated and

yellow.  He's not breathing.  She bends over him, his open eyes fixed

in a glassy stare.  No pulse.  She snaps the triangular cardboard ID

from his bed to indicate HE'S DIED.  Then tenderly closes his eyes.

THEY SUDDENLY SNAP OPEN.  HE REARS UP, GRABBING HER.

He slaps her hand away.  Slaps at the tubes going into his arm.  Hana

is absolutely shocked.  But just as suddenly he's sunk back into semi-

consciousness.

Shaken, she sits by him and takes his hand, he pulls it away, she takes

it again.  He is in terrible pain.  His face creased with anger.  Now

his hand is clutching at hers.  She tries to soothe him.

HIS FACE STILLS.  HIS HAND LOOSENS.  Now he has gone.  As Hana inspects

him, a shell seems to land close by.  THE LIGHTS FLICKER.  She ducks,

along with everyone else.

Below the bed, on slatboards, above the mud, are the now dead soldier's

possessions.  They include A PAIR OF TENNIS SHOES.

101	INT.  TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.  EVENING.

HANA, WEARING THE TENNIS SHOES, IS GIVING BLOOD.  She lies in a cot,

next to JAN.  The shelling sounds closer.

OLIVER, the Doctor, is working on the most recent patient, a young

CANADIAN Boy who is critically ill - the tubes hanging above him, of

plasma and of blood.  The curtain drawn around him is pulled back, to

reveal the two nurses in the background.  The Soldier can just see

them.  He's going to die any minute.

Hana can only really hear Oliver's end of this conversation, but the

mention of Canada chills her, and she knows, now, not later, that

Stuart is dead.

The boy nods.

Oliver leans over, then turns to Hana.

The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.

The shells are getting closer.

A SHELL SUDDENLY LANDS ON TOP OF THE SITE, PERHAPS FIFTY YARDS FROM THE

TENT.  THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  THEN ANOTHER LANDS.

Everybody is on the floor, struggling to get on a helmet.

Hana lies down, the blood still leaving her, her helmet on.  Oliver is

next to her in the mud.  Her heart is breaking.

The shells pound them, incredibly loud, drowning out her grief, but

each explosion illuminates it for a moment.

102	INT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.

Caravaggio comes into the kitchen.  Hana is slumped at the table, her

back naked.  The jug of water in front of her.  She's sobbing, her

shoulders heaving.  Caravaggio approaches tentatively.

She reaches for her blouse, wraps it around herself.  Her face is read

with weeping.

103*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana sits reading from the Herodotus.  She shows the Patient the page

where a CHRISTMAS CRACKER WRAPPER covered in handwriting has been glued

in.

104	EXT.  AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, DECEMBER 1938.  DAY.

A CHRISTMAS PARTY FOR THE TROOPS.  The incongruous attempts to create a

traditional Christmas in the dusty heat of Cairo.

The Party is in the courtyard of the Moorish Palace which serves as the

private residence of the British Ambassador, SIR RONNIE HAMPTON.  Lots

of Wives, including LADY HAMPTON and Katharine help serve tea and cake

to the SOLDIERS who sit at rudimentary tables with paper plates and

paper hats.  A man dressed as SANTA CLAUS is giving out presents -

PENGUIN PAPERBACKS, CHOCOLATE.  Music blares out from a loudspeaker.

Officers and Civilians walk the parameter.  One of these, arriving, is

Almasy.  He sits in the shade, catches Katharine's attention.

Katharine brings him over a cup of tea and a plate with Christmas cake

on it.

Lady Hampton calls impatiently.

pushes a trolley with teapots)

Almasy sits watching the party.  The Santa Claus is dragged outside by

some excited Children.  Almasy picks at his cake removing the thick

marzipan icing.  He's writing on A CHRISTMAS CRACKER WRAPPER, smoothing

it out - December 22nd.  Betrayals in war are childlike compared with

out betrayals du...

Katharine, attending to a raucous table, suddenly sags at the knees,

and SWOONS.  People rush to her.

They pass Almasy, who doesn't look up from his book.

105	INT.  STORE ROOM.  AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.  DAY.

A small STOREROOM inside the Palace - Brooms, Mops, Cleaning Equipment.

Outside, the party is visible as opaque shadows through the beveled

glass of the ornate window.  The sound of carols sung by the enlisted

men gives way to a version of SILENT NIGHT played on a solitary

bagpipe.  Inside, ALMASY AND KATHARINE MAKE LOVE IN THE DARKNESS.

Everything is too fast, desperate, standing up, grabbing, hoisting

clothes.

106	INT.    CORRIDORS.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    DAY.

A CORRIDOR.  Almasy appears and almost immediately collides with the

man dressed as SANTA CLAUS.  He moves to one side.

Geoffrey continues scouting the warren of tiny rooms that run off the

central courtyard.  He finds Katharine sitting in one, smoking,

surrounded by oppressive and elaborate tiling.  Clifton wonders briefly

how Almasy had missed Katharine.

107*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

The Patient lies alone in his room.  CLIFTON'S FACE stares back at him

from among the frescoes.  Then something distracts him.

A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.

Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.

Caravaggio comes close, scrutinizing the face, trying to repair the

features.  Exasperated.

108	INT.    MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.

Hana stands at the PIANO.  It's still lop-sided, propped against the

wall.  She tries but can't move it.  So she pulls off the dust-sheet

and, with the instrument still on a tilt, begins to play the Aria from

Bach's Goldberg Variations.

109	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

HANA'S PIANO CONTINUES.  Upstairs, Caravaggio chats with the Patient

while working his arms to RAISE A VEIN, a boot-lace tied around it,

preparing an injection for himself, tapping the syringe.  During this:

110*.	INT.    MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.

Hana plays.  GUN SHOTS punctuates the music.  She's totally engrossed

and only hears the second or third shot.  Her hands falter, she looks

up to see A SIKH SOLDIER RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD WAVING HIS ARMS, his

REVOLVER held aloft.  He approaches the door, his face creased with

anxiety, and raps on the shattered frame.  It's KIP.

She gets up and walks past Kip standing at the door, and continues the

seven or eight feet to the right and out into the garden VIA THE HOLE

RIPPED OUT OF THE WALL.

Kip is looking around the piano.  Hana giggles.

Hana bends to see what Kip's looking at under the piano.  Wires run

from the wall to the instrument onto which is taped an EXPLOSIVE

CHARGE.   If Hana had succeeded in moving the piano she would have

triggered the charge.  Kip looks at Hana who conceals her dismay with a

shrug.

110a*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DUSK.

Across from the terrace, HARDY AND KIP ARE PUTTING UP THEIR TENTS.

Caravaggio stands, chatting amiably to them, holding a haversack,

smoking a cigarette.

111*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DUSK.

Hana looks down from the Patient's room, watching the tents go up.

Kip glances up at the window.  Hana, suddenly shy, backs away.

She goes over to the Patient's bed.

112*.	INT.    OFFICE, BRITISH HQ.    CAIRO.    DAY.

A SMALL OFFICE, shared by two men, and a mountain of filing cabinets

and paper.  There are AERIAL MAPS all over the walls.  Clifton is on

the telephone, while his colleague, RUPERT DOUGLAS, works at the desk.

Rupert makes a face at his friend's sentimentality.  Clifton beams.

113	EXT.    CAIRO STREET.   O/S  SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    DAY.

The approach to the Shepheard's Hotel.  Geoffrey Clifton in a TAXI,

champagne between his knees.

The car ahead of them SCREECHES TO A HALT as a WOMAN hurries across the

street.  The driver honks his horn angrily.  The woman puts up a hand

in apology as she skips across the street to another taxi.  IT'S

KATHARINE - she's dressed for a date, carries flowers, an overnight

bag.

Geoffrey, at first excited, is troubled by the accouterments.  Then he

sees Katharine skip and his whole being punctures.

Katharine's cab roars off.  His own car jerks forward.

Geoffrey sits in the cab.  Fifty yards short of the hotel.  The world

rushes by.  He finds a cigarette.

114	INT.    ALMASY'S ROOMS.    LATE DAY.

Katharine is in bed.  Almasy has just put A RECORD on.  It's the folk

song heard at the beginning of the film.  He slips back under the

covers.  Their clothes are scattered around the room.  He lies over a

happy Katharine.  She listens.

Katharine had thought for a few seconds he was serious, then she

catches on and starts to beat him.

They embrace, he lies over her, considering her naked back.

He turns her over, kisses her throat, then traces the hollow

indentation.

The luxury of this makes them both sad.  The duplicity.  Almasy rolls

away on to his back.

115	INT. CAB.  CAIRO STREET.  O/S SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.  NIGHT.

The CAB DRIVER is asleep. A loud POP! jerks him awake.  In the back of

the car Geoffrey has opened the champagne.  He lets it overflow, then

takes a swig.  He notices the startled driver and puts up an apologetic

arm.

Two or three CHILDREN knock on the window, begging.  Geoffrey knocks

back, violently.  They disappear.

And he throws a silencing wad of money onto the seat by the Cabbie.

116	EXT.    ALMASY'S HOUSE.    OLD CAIRO.    DAWN.

Almasy and Katharine wander out of his building and into the early

morning streets, hand in hand.

117	EXT.    SPICE MARKET.    CAIRO.    DAWN.

The MORNING PRAYERS rise out from the city's three Minarets.  Almasy

stops at a stall, which is just preparing to open for the day.  He

picks up a SILVER THIMBLE, points at it to the merchant who gives him a

price.  Without comment, Almasy produces the money and, beaming, hands

the thimble to Katharine.

118	EXT.    CAIRO STREET.    DAWN.

Katharine takes leave of Almasy on the street corner away from the

hotel entrance.  They don't kiss, there's no demonstration of feeling.

He turns immediately away and disappears.

119	INT.  CAB.  CAIRO STREET.  O/S SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.  DAY.

Geoffrey, unshaven, watches as Katharine crosses the street and heads

towards the hotel.  His expression is terrible, trying to smile, his

face collapsed.

120	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.

Cheek to Cheek leaks into the room from a GRAMOPHONE that Caravaggio

stands over proudly.  The Patient opens his eyes - is confused,

dislocated - stares blankly at Caravaggio.

Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.

She goes over to the Patient and kisses him gently.

She goes to the window, looks over to where the tents are pitched, sees

Hardy shaving, Kip IN THE PROCESS OF WASHING HIS HAIR, his turban

HANGING LIKE A RIBBON between two trees to dry.  He's perched a bowl on

the sundial and is dipping his long coal-black hair into it.  As Hana

watches Kip, Caravaggio changes the record.  The Patient identifies it

immediately.

121*.	EXT.    MONASTERY GARDEN.     MORNING.

Hana walks past the tent, and passes Hardy.  She's carrying a small

cup, which she's a little furtive about.  He's carrying a whole armada

of OIL LIGHTS.  He nods upstairs.

She goes on, and tentatively approaches Kip, who's still working at his

hair.  Kip hears her and puts out an inquiring arm, moving towards her

like a blink man through the curtain of hair.  He touches her.

Kip shrugs.

He continues to wash.  She holds up the cup of oil.

She stands for a second, then walks away.  Kip examines the oil, calls

after her.

122	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S GARDEN.    DAY.

HANA IS GARDENING, close to the crucifix, which is now a full-fledged

Scarecrow.  Broken bottles, fragments of stained glass and shards from

a mirror are hung from the crossbar, syringes too, all jangling and

tinkling and catching the sunlight.

Kip and Hardy drive off to work on their motorcycles.  She watches

them, catching Kip's careless wave to her.  She looks briefly at

herself in A PIECE OF MIRROR dangling from the Scarecrow.

123	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    UPSTAIRS LANDING.    DAY.

Hana walks along the landing with a tray.  There's a message on several

doors in the corridor from Kip: SAFE, then a couple with the warning:

DANGER.  She hears noise from the Patient's room.  Listens for a second

before going in.

124	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

During this, Hana comes through with the tray, finds Kip perched on the

window, relishing his skirmish with the Patient, who has condensed milk

dribbling down his neck.

Hana and the Patient are alone.

Kip comes bounding in with a fresh can.

125	DELETED.

126.				INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.   MORNING.

Caravaggio and the Patient are singing - an Arab song which they both

know from Cairo days.  THUNDER accompanies them.  It's pouring.

Suddenly the door is flung open and HANA, KIP and HARDY appear.  They

have the stretcher with them.

127*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    MORNING.

A whoop precedes THE HEADLONG RUSH OF KIP, HARDLY and CARAVAGGIO as

they cart the Patient across the Cloisters like manic stretcher-

bearers.  Hana is with them, holding an umbrella over the Patient who

bounces uncomfortably.  He is nervous, a little giddy.  The rain

buckets down.

127a*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    MORNING.

The storm tour includes a trip around the pond.  The Patient pushes

away the umbrella, lets the rain drench him.   He grins at Hana.

128*.	INT.  LIBRARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EGYPTOLOGY.  DAY.

Madox and Almasy are camped in one corner of THE LIBRARY, hunched over

their maps and papers and journals and clashing furiously over the site

of the next part of the expedition.

Almasy is surprised by Madox' anger.

the map, recites its message)

129	INT.   CAIRO STREET.   DAY.

Almasy and Madox walk down this busy and rather narrow street without

pavements.  Both of them somber.

Almasy hesitates at a junction, clearly about to take leave of Madox.

Madox looks at him.

130	INT.    OPEN-AIR CINEMA.    CAIRO.    EVENING.

The OPEN-AIR CINEMA is just beginning its evening programme.

PATHE NEWS BEGINS and we date the event to April 1939.  Stories of

imminent war jostle with images of Merrie England.  Village greens,

sporting victories, Cruft's Dog Show.  Alone among the necking couples

- mostly soldiers with their Egyptian girlfriends - in an otherwise

empty block, is Katharine.  She's waiting for Almasy.  A SOLDIER comes

over to Katharine's row and settles a couple of seats away from her.

Katharine lights his cigarette and returns to the screen.  An item

about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and TOP HAT.  The stars do their

stuff.  The soldier moves a seat nearer.

The Soldier slinks off, muttering.  Katharine is wretched.  She sits

head down, not watching the screen, marooned in her despair about

duplicity, sordid assignations.

Almasy arrives, slides in beside Katharine, his shadow momentarily

large across the screen.

They watch the screen.  Katharine is weeping.  Almasy doesn't

understand.  He puts his arm around her.

131*.	EXT.    GROPPI PARK.    CAIRO.    EVENING.

A man walks round with A HAND BELL - announcing that the Park is

closing.  He turns off the gaslights which illuminate the animal cages.

Almasy and Katharine sit stiffly on a bench.  They don't speak.  Almasy

puts his hands to his head, he rubs his shoulders.  The lights are

gradually being extinguished around them.

They stand, awkward.  Katharine rehearses her position.  The bell

clangs.

He takes her hands, lays his cheeks into them, then releases them, gets

up, walks away.  She walks towards the gate.  He calls after her.

She nods, can't find this funny.

Then she turns sharply from him and catches her head against the

gatepost, staggers at the shock of it, then hurries away.

132*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.

Hana sits with the English Patient - the room shuttered against the

morning light.  His breathing is noticeably worsening, a shudder of a

breath, the shallow rise and fall of his chest perceptible.  Hana

frets, touches his wrist, feeling for the pulse.

She squeezes his hand, suddenly overwhelmed.

There's some kind of noise from the garden.  Muffled shouts.

Hana goes to the window, opens the shutters.  The day pours in.

132A*.	EXT.    MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES.    DAY.

Hana sees Kip - barely visible - standing at the far perimeter of the

garden in the olive groves, HIS HANDS RAISED ABOVE HIM, HIS LEG HELD

OUT STRANGELY.  WIRES run from his foot in all directions as if he'd

trodden in some elaborate steel cobweb.

133	EXT.    MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES.    DAY.

Hana appears at the edge of the Olive groves and hurries towards Kip,

who hasn't moved.  He shouts warning her.

Hana stops, hoists up her skirt and circles left, tentative in the long

grass.  He shouts, doesn't want her close.

She keeps coming, can see that he needs her.

She kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web.

She follows one wire back to the closest mine, and traces another back

to Kip's foot.  Then she finds another one leading off to a second mine

some thirty metres away.

She turns and tiptoes RIGHT THROUGH THE DANGER AREA, straight to what

had seized her attention.  Kip is appalled.

Heedless, she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as THE

TORTOISE clambers onto a clump of rock, which is, in fact, ANOTHER

CONCRETE-COVERED MINE.

Hana snatches him up as he ambles towards the metal.  She turns,

holding the protesting animal in triumph.  HER FOOT SNAGS ON A WIRE.

She has to ease it off, in arabesque, still clutching the tortoise.

She goes sideways to the safe zone - setting down the animal.  Then

she's back with Kip.  He's seething.  She is strangely elated.

and hands them to him)

He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.

But he hands them over.

Hana checks, lies down.  He bends as close to the ground as he dares

AND KISSES HER, THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY CUTS.

134	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    CONTINUOUS.

The Patient lies in bed.  He's agitated by the silence.  SUDDENLY

THERE'S AN EXPLOSION.  He tries to shout, a croak which quickly reduces

him to coughing and breathlessness.

He tries to move.  He can't.  He's frantic.

FOOTSTEPS, as someone hurtles up the stairs.  It's Hana.  She's ashamed

to have forgotten him.  She rushes to him.

She calms him.  He's exhausted.  His eyes shine.

135	EXT.    MOUNTAIN ROAD.    ITALY.    LATE DAY.

Hana clings onto Kip as the TRIUMPH MOTORCYCLE hares along the circling

road.  She has her arms around his waist.  His head turns to her for a

second and she smiles.

136	EXT.    ROAD BLOCK.    TUSCANY.    DUSK.

Kip and Hana have been detained at a ROAD BLOCK.  Kip is being

questioned at a sentry post, his papers over-thoroughly inspected and

accompanied by several meaningful glances at Hana, who waits, standing

by the motorcycle.  One of the SOLDIERS saunters over and returns her

papers.

The Soldier isn't sure what to make of this.  He signals to his

companion who returns Kip's papers.  Kip walks back to the motorcycles.

He says nothing.  He kicks the starter.  Hana gets on, slides her arms

lovingly around him.

137	EXT.    BRIDGE.    ITALY.    DUSK.

IT'S GETTING DARK.  The bike, headlights on, crosses a bridge.  Kip has

strapped on his crimson emergency light as they sail along the winding

crest of mountain ridge that is a spine down Italy.

138	EXT.    AREZZO.   DUSK.

They dismount and Kip starts to unbuckle his bulging satchel and unload

the panniers.  Hana still doesn't know what's in store and looks

questioningly at Kip as he walks up to the door of the CHURCH.

139	INT.    CHURCH.    DUSK.

They enter the Church.  It's in almost total darkness.  THEN A FLARE

SUDDENLY ILLUMINATES THE INTERIOR.  It's magnificent.  Kip holds the

flare, crimson on one arm, green pouring up from the other.  Hana walks

behind him, still perplexed.  There is PROTECTIVE SCAFFOLDING

EVERYWHERE, AND SANDBAGS PILED UP HIGH AROUND THE ALTARS, AND THE

STATUES.

A SECOND FLARE.  Kip has appeared through A SECRET DOOR high in the

church, literally emerging from one of the frescoes which are

momentarily visible.  He flings a rope over the rafters.

Now Kip circles Hana with the rope, MAKING A SLING across her waist and

shoulder.  He lights a smaller flair and hands it to her before

disappearing.

Hana stands holding the flare.  She can't see Kip, can only hear him

scrambling.

He runs up the sandbags, right up into the rafters.  He collects the

other end of the rope which is attached to Hana.  Holding onto it, he

just STEPS OFF INTO THE DARKNESS.

SIMULTANEOUSLY HANA IS SWUNG UP INTO THE AIR, her startled yelp echoing

around the Church.  Kip touches ground, while Hana swings through

space, coming to rest about three feet from the FRESCOED WALLS, painted

by Piero Della Francesca.  Hana's flare makes a halo around her head.

Now Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward and

causes Hana to SWING to the right.  She lets out a giddy laugh,

exhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating - en passant -

faces, bodies, angels.  Kip guides the rope as if they were making

love, which in a way they are.

Hana arrives, hovering, in front of THE QUEEN OF SHEBA TALKING TO

SOLOMON. She's overwhelmed.  She reaches out to touch the giant neck of

the sad Queen.

Kip slowly lets her down, paying out the length of the rope.  Hana's

face is full of tears.  He smiles, holds her.

140	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Caravaggio is with the Patient.  He sits in the window.  Fiddles with

the bandages of his hands.

Caravaggio goes to him, holding out his hands, the bandage ends

trailing.

The Patient holds them.  Caravaggio walks backwards, the bandages

unraveling and unraveling.

141*.	INT.  TOBRUK.  BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.  JUNE 1942.  DAY.

Caravaggio, thumbs intact and wearing a crumpled linen suit, walks

through the mangled corridors of British HQ.  Smoke is rising from

buildings, the ominous scream of Stuka dive-bombers in the distance as

the harbor is pounded, the steady thud of explosions.  TOBRUK IS UNDER

SIEGE.  BHQ is a place in the throws of dismantling itself.

SECRETARIES are visiting braziers manned by ARAB BOYS who stoke the

fires as boxes of papers are fed into them.  ASHES hover in the air.

142*.	INT.   BHQ.    TOBRUK.    DAY.

Caravaggio walks through a large room crowded with desks.  From one of

them, a young woman, AICHA, kisses him, frowning at the chaos and the

shelling.

Some doors are open, revealing men and women in uniform urgently

SHREDDING DOCUMENTS.  Caravaggio knocks at an office whose door is ajar

and where the incumbent, FENELON-BARNES, is stripping the room of his

personal possessions-  photographs, stone branches, a cricket bat.

142a*.	INT.   FENELON-BARNES OFFICE.   BHQ.   TOBRUK.   DAY.

Caravaggio enters.

A BIG BOMB lands nearby.  The building shudders and plaster dust drops

from the ceiling.  Almost oblivious, the two men head out of the

office.  Fenelon-Barnes lugs the TRUNK last glimpsed in his tent by

Almasy, until Caravaggio takes over.

143*.	INT. CORRIDOR OF BRITISH HEADQUARTERS. TOBRUK. DAY.

Fenelon-Barnes and Caravaggio make their way down the stairs and to the

entrance.

AICHA is at the bottom of the stairs.  She falls into step.

Caravaggio opens the door, Fenelon-Barnes goes through.

144*.	EXT.    BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.    TOBRUK.    DAY.

The Fenelon-Barnes trunk is taken from Caravaggio and joins the pile of

luggage and artifacts, which wait to be shipped out.

145	DELETED.

146*.	EXT.    TOBRUK DOCKSIDE.    DAY.

A GERMAN TROOP CARRIER rumbles forward passing a line of BEDRAGGLED

BRITISH POWS as they're marched along the side of harbor.

146a*. EXT.    TOBRUK RUINED QUARTER.    DAY.

A HILL OF SALVAGED ARMY BOOTS is being explored by a couple of GERMAN

SOLDIERS in search of better footwear.  Below them the POWS trudge by,

one of them barefoot.  ONE OF THE GERMANS tosses down a pair of boots

then continues his own perusal.

146b*. EXT.    TOBRUK SQUARE.    DAY.

A crowd of Tobruk CIVILIANS - French and Italians among the MOSTLY ARAB

FACES.  Their papers are being thoroughly checked by officers sitting

at open desks. IN A LINE, WEARING HIS SHABBY SUIT, IS CARAVAGGIO.  AN

ARAB WOMAN in front of him is arguing over the identity of her

ominously CAUCASIAN-LOOKING CHILD.  An INTERPRETER mediates.  The

OFFICER doesn't believe the woman.  She's getting frantic at the

possibility of losing her child.

Suddenly there's a disturbance as a WOMAN is dragged along the line by

her hair.  She's bloodied, and has been tortured, and it's hard to

recognize her as the pretty AICHA.  She touches a couple of people in

the line.  They're horrified.  Soldiers pull them away.  Caravaggio

doesn't look, stares straight ahead.  An officer watches him AS HE

TURNS BRIEFLY AND HELPLESSLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR HER.  THEIR EYES CATCH

FOR AN INSTANT AND THE OFFICER SEES IT.

CARAVAGGIO RUNS, bolts for cover, vaulting the rubble which blocks one

corner of the square.  The CONGREGATION throws itself to the ground

until the square has only standing soldiers and a running man.

146c*. EXT.   TOBRUK.   INTERIOR OF RUINED BUILDING.   DAY.

Shots pursue Caravaggio as he disappears behind the rubble, then bobs

up again as he darts inside a blasted building.  He clambers up some

ruined stairs, heaves over the wall.

146d*. EXT.   TOBRUK.   FACADE OF RUINED BUILDING.   DAY.

CARAVAGGIO grabs a metal bar on the facade of the building, from which

he hangs, looking for the next foothold.  Soldiers appear along the top

of the building, shouting, rifles ready.  AN OFFICER arrives and stops

the soldiers firing, and the others begin to laugh as Caravaggio hangs

from the bar fifteen feet above a balcony, slowly losing his strength.

Another SOLDIER waits for him in the balcony below.  Now he starts to

laugh.  Caravaggio hangs.

147*.	INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. TOBRUK. NOVEMBER 13,1942. DAY.

Caravaggio is slumped at a table, HIS HANDS MANACLED TO ITS THICK

WOODEN LEGS.  There's A TELEPHONE at another table in the corner of the

room attended by a CLERK with A STENOGRAPHER working next to him.  The

room has stone walls which appear damp, and no windows.  SOLDIERS stand

guard at the door.  It's a horrible room.  Caravaggio is trying to

sleep, he's unshaven, and pasty-looking.  His interrogator, Muller,

seems incredibly tired and aggravated.  He's on the phone.

He slams down the phone and comes back to the table.

Muller doesn't even pay attention, he's going through a file.  Pulls

out some photographs, starts spreading them out.

THE PHONE rings again, is answered.  The Clerk calls to Muller who gets

up, irritably.  Caravaggio addresses the room.

there's blood in his mouth)

Nobody responds.  Muller is irascible on the phone, checking his watch,

negotiating time.  The call finishes.

Muller nods at the Clerk, who instantly gets up.  Just then the

telephone rings again.  He hesitates.

The Clerk exits.  The phone rings.  The Stenographer is plagued by

flies.  Suddenly he slaps at one.

The NURSE comes in.  She is Arab and her head is covered.

There's silence.  Muller turns to Caravaggio.

Now the phone starts again.  The CLERK picks it up, there's a terse

exchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the moment to

interrupt Muller.

No response.  Muller opens his palms to Caravaggio.

Muller walks over, takes the receiver and slams it down.  an AIR RAID

SIREN is going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is

also discernible, but all muffled in this room with the steady clack-

clack of the STENOGRAPHER.  At that moment, Muller suddenly becomes

aware of what is happening.  He turns on the Stenographer.

DURING THIS Muller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer and

produced A CUT-THROAT RAZOR.  He hands it to the nurse, makes a line

across his own left thumb and jerks his head towards Caravaggio.  The

nurse is extremely reluctant.  Muller claps his hands, pushes her

towards Caravaggio.

Caravaggio is in terror.

The guards come away from the door and press down on Caravaggio's

shoulders to prevent him from moving.  The nurse, grim-faced,

approaches, kneels at the table.

And then he SCREAMS AND SCREAMS and jerks up, carrying the guards and

the table with him, all heaving off the ground, the nurse thrown off

balance.  He falls to the floor, ROARING WITH PAIN, blood everywhere,

the table on top of him.  The AIR RAID is continuing outside, the PHONE

IS RINGING, the nurse stands, pale, blood all over her uniform.

He stabs at his own right thumb.

The nurse, horrified, shakes her head.  Muller snatches the razor from

her and heads towards the prostate Caravaggio.

One Guard has got to his feet and grips Caravaggio around the neck in

half-nelson, others holding his legs, while Muller approaches.

Caravaggio can't move.  He's gurgling as the Guard almost strangles

him.  His eyes are streaming with tears.

Now Muller is at his other hand, and the ROAR of pain again lifts

Caravaggio to his feet, THE WHOLE TABLE RISING IN THE AIR, his

mutilated hands slipping from the handcuffs lie Houdini, the drawers of

the table SPILLING their contents everywhere, before he sinks to his

knees like a gored bull and BLACKS OUT.

148	INT.    INTERROGATION ROOM.    TOBRUK.    DAY.

LATER, and Caravaggio comes round.  His eyes open and then his face

spasms with pain.  He looks down at his ruined hands, then realizes

he's alone on the floor of the room, the papers still scattered, the

table on its side.  He gets up and staggers out of the open door and up

the stairs.

149*.	INT.  STAIRS FROM INTERROGATION ROOM.  TOBRUK.   DAY.

The corridor is deserted, but the body of a GERMAN SOLDIER sprawls on

the stairs leading up to daylight.  Outside Caravaggio can hear

fighting.

150*.	EXT.    ROOF.    INTERROGATION BUILDING.    DAY.

Caravaggio walks unsteadily along the roof of the building.  Grey and

yellow gusts of smoke and the rat-ta-tat-tat of machine gun fire

accompany him, and there's the sound of vehicles screeching and people

shouting nearby, but no visual clues as to what's happening.

SUDDENLY A PARACHUTE FLOATS DOWN BY HIM.  THEN ANOTHER.  THEN ANOTHER.

HE'S SURROUNDED BY PARACHUTES.  THE BRITISH ARE RECLAIMING TOBRUK.  A

PARATROOPER LANDS ON THE ROOF, AND GESTURES TO CARAVAGGIO TO RAISE HIS

HANDS.  HE SLOWLY DOES SO.

151*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Caravaggio stands in front of the bed, holding up his NAKED HANDS to

the Patient, like a man surrendering - two flaps like gills where his

thumbs were.  The Patient reaches out to take his hands and gently

lowers them.  Caravaggio finds his bandages, start to wrap them back

round his fists.

The LIGHTS FROM THE MOTORBIKE approaching the Monastery, its growl.

Caravaggio goes to the window and watches as Kip and Hana arrive.

152	INT.   AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.   CAIRO, 1939.   NIGHT.

Last seen at the Troops Christmas party, the INNER COURTYARD has been

transformed into an elegant outdoor banquet, with band. The

Almasy/Madox team is assembled for A FAREWELL DINNER.  They are waiting

for Almasy to arrive, his seat conspicuously empty.  He is very late.

And then he's there, dangerous drunk, terribly dashing.  He practically

dances to his chair, which he drags violently away from its position

opposite Katharine.  He bows to Lady Hampton.

The others drink, trying to ignore his mood.

Ronnie Hampton shrugs.  They're all very uncomfortable.  Almasy glares

at Clifton.

The Band is now playing Manhattan - Almasy, without missing a beat,

begins to sing, replacing the words with alternatives he knows.  He

lurches around.  Katharine can't look at him.

Madox gets up and pulls Almasy into his chair, taking charge.

153*.	EXT.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    NIGHT.

Later, now MOST OF THE GROUP ARE DANCING.  We see Katharine dancing

with Rupert Douglas, enjoying herself.  Bermann is there and even Madox

jogging and grinning foolishly.  Clifton looks at Katharine who, as the

dance ends, excuses herself to go to the cloakroom.  Almasy hovers in

the shadows, unseen.

154*.	INT.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    NIGHT.

Katharine comes along the familiar warren of rooms and corridors and is

suddenly confronted by Almasy, tortured and out of control.

He tries to hold her.  She resists

Some women, flushed with dancing, turn the corner on the way to the

Ladies Room.  They collect Katharine in their train and leave Almasy to

fall back into the shadows.

155	INT.    THE PATIENTS' ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana sits with the Patient.  His eyes are full of tears.  He opens

them, sees her, watching over him.  He's embarrassed.

He nods.  She gets up, touches his hand, then leaves.

156*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY, LANDING AND STAIRS.    NIGHT.

Hana leaves the room, then turns and sees A TINY LAMP on the floor,

it's made from a SNAIL SHELL and oil.  She bends to it curiously, then

sees a second lamp half-way down the stairs, then a third further down.

She smiles in the light, then follows the trail.

157	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    NIGHT.

In the Cloisters THE TRAIL OF SHELL LAMPS CONTINUES, like tiny cat's

eyes.  As they reach the hopscotch chalk marks, they outline the

squares.  Hana HOPSCOTCHES and then follows the light, disappearing

round a corner.

158	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    NIGHT.

Hana comes through into the stables.  The lamps lead her, then they

stop.  She peers into the shadows.

She turns to the voice.  He steps out of the darkness.

And he goes to her.

159	EXT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    EARLY MORNING.

Hardy knocks cautiously on the door of the stables.  Eventually Hana

opens the door.

She closes the door, then reappears.

Kip comes to the door, winding his turban.

Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.

And he's ready, Hardy having wheeled out their motorcycles.  He gets on

his, and they're away, Hana hardly able to look.

160	EXT.    A VIADUCT NORTH OF THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

KIP IS LOWERED BY A PULLEY INTO THE SHAFT THE SAPPERS HAVE MADE AROUND

THE BOMB.  Hardy supervises.  The bombs huge - 2, 000 lbs, and

protrudes ostrich-like from the pit, its nose sunk into a pool of

sludge at the base of the viaduct.

Kip steps off and sinks knee deep in mud, grunting in disgust.

Warily, he touches his huge opponent, feeling the condition of the

case.  He wipes the metal.  Reveals a serial number, calls it out to

Hardy, who's perched on the bank.

He's hypnotized by the number: KK-1P: a bomb with his name on it.

161	EXT.    ROAD APPROACHING VIADUCT.   DAY.

Hana cycles along on Caravaggio's bicycle.  A TANK comes roaring up

behind her, then a second and a third, loaded up with people, citizens

and soldiers, and children, waving flags and gesticulating.  She lets

the metal circus go by.

162	INT.    BOMB SHAFT.    DAY.

Back in the shaft, Kip works away, his fingers shaking with the cold

from the oxygen he's using to freeze the fuse.  Suddenly there's a

VIOLENT TREMOR.  The ground is SHUDDERING, and the bomb slips horribly.

Kip GRABS AT IT helplessly as if trying to stop a man from falling,

instead it falls on him pushing him into the sludge.

163	EXT.    VIADUCT.    DAY.

The TANKS are rumbling towards the Viaduct.  HORNS start sounding.

HARDY, below, bellows at his men above for explanation.

Three Sappers run across the bridge towards the oncoming procession.

They wave their orange flags, the tanks wave back wit their flags -

Stars and Stripes, Union Jacks.  Now SHOTS are ringing out.  In the

shaft, oblivious, Kip slides out from under the bomb, the oxygen

spurting everywhere, all over his clothes, hissing on the surface of

the water.  Hardy bends into the shaft, heedless of his own safety.

He rubs his hands to warm them up, locates his needle pliers and slips

them through the tiny gap.  His hand touches the casing and the freeze

BURNS his hand.  He jerks back, DROPPING THE PLIERS into the sludge,

cursing.

Now he's on his hands and knees in the sludge, trying frantically to

find the pliers.  Hardy looks at his watch, he can't help.  The seconds

run out as Kip grovels in the mud.  Totally submerged, he suddenly

comes out with the pliers, goes straight to the fuse, no finesse, and

cuts.  There's a snip.  Then nothing.  Then Kip laughs at Hardy.

Hardy is already at the winch, hauling it up.  Kip can hardly clip on

the halter - his hands numb and burned.  As the pulley jerks he just

clings on, rising from the grip of the mud like an ancient corpse out

of a bog.

The other sappers have gathered around the edge of the site.  Great

elation on their faces.

Kip shakes his hand.  Kip shakes Hardy's hand.

And now they're all shaking hands, and slapping backs and the SOLDIERS

FROM THE TANKS are there and the victory  celebrations begin.  Kip's

blank, drained, not taking anything in, as Dade wraps a blanket around

his shoulders.

HANA'S ON TOP OF THE VIADUCT, watching as Kip is wrapped in his

blanket, the men celebrating.  She shouts with relief from the top of

the bridge.

164	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

The gramophone plays Frank Sinatra.  Kip sits in the window, the

shutters open, the village lit up behind his head, nodding to the

music, sucking out of his condensed milk.  Elsewhere there is an open

bottle of cognac, some wine.  The Patient has a beaker of wine.

Caravaggio is dancing with Hana.

Caravaggio swirls past the Patient - nodding at the cognac.

165	EXT.    VILLAGE SQUARE.    NIGHT.

A tiny PIAZZA where the Sappers and the Villagers are having their own,

more raucous, Victory Feste.  There are accordions, there's dancing,

and there's HARDY, stripped to some exotic underpants, a large tattoo:

DORIS inside a heart, clambering up the EQUESTRIAN STATUE IN THE MIDDLE

OF THE FOUNTAIN.  He's astride the horse and now straining to get up to

the tip of the outstretched sword, so that he can hang the UNION JACK

FLAG he has in his mouth.

BLACKLER, one of the Sappers, is Hardy's assistant.  He's drunk and

slips from his ladder, falling flat on his back into the fountain with

a great splash, to much hilarity.

166	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana and Caravaggio are still dancing.  The music has stopped.

Caravaggio changes the record.  Hana goes to Kip for a second, beaming,

before Caravaggio has snatched her away again.  The Patient taps along

to the music.

There's a muddled thud in the distance, Kip's ears prick up.  He

glances for an instant out of the window.

She is spinning with Caravaggio.  When she comes round again, Kip has

gone.

167	EXT.    VILLAGE SQUARE.    ITALY 1945.    NIGHT.

A MILITARY AMBULANCE IS ALREADY THERE.  Dade and SPALDING are presiding

as the paramedics take two bodies into the rear of the truck.  The

shattered fountain, the sluiced flagstones, shining wet and slick, give

some clues as to what's happened, as do the elderly standing in the

shadows, the distressed girls, arm in arm.  ONE GIRL, young and quite

striking, is particularly inconsolable, her grief sobbed out at the

doors of the ambulance.

SPALDING salutes Kip, who waves his salute away, just wanting to know

what happened.

Kip goes to the ambulance.  Spalding tries to stop him.

Kip steps into the back of the ambulance, bends over both bodies, does

look, then comes out, past the weeping girl.

168	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    APPROACHING DAWN.

Kip has pulled out all of Hardy's gear.  Now he starts on the tent.

Hana comes out into the step.  Kip turns, his eyes brimming, sees her,

sighs, then turns back and kicks at the pegs, collapsing the tent.

Now he's trying to fold a shirt.  Hana takes it from him.  She folds

it.  Then together they start to fold the tent, Kip orchestrating, not

wanting to talk.  Finally, Kip looks at Hana, stiff with emotion.

169*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Caravaggio, reading Dante aloud in Italian, smoking, walks over to the

window, looks out.

169*.	EXT.    KIP'S TENT.    EVENING.

Hana is approaching Kip's tent, carrying a light.  She ducks inside the

tent and the light disappears.

169b*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Caravaggio turns back into the room, towards the Patient, still

reading.

170	INT.    KIP'S TENT.    NIGHT.

Hana lies over Kip, unraveling his turban, slowly, sensual.

But she continues unraveling the turban.

171*.	EXT.   BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.  1939.  DAY.

The Expedition Team is packing up the Basecamp.  Madox and Almasy are

loading things into the plane.  FOUAD, AL AUF and others work at the

cars.

Madox kneels and takes A HANDFUL OF SAND, puts it into his pocket.  He

throws his haversack into the plane then turns.  Almasy puts out a

hand.  This is a moment of great emotional weight for them both,

conducted as if nothing were happening.

They shake hands.

Madox clambers into his plane, then remembers something, jabs at his

throat.

Almasy nods, goes to the propeller.

The plane roars into life.  Almasy watches it taxi away - then heads

back to continue with his packing up.

172*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

MADOX SHOOTS HIMSELF BEHIND THE ALTAR IN THE ROOM.  The Patient's

stertorous breathing, each intake accompanied by a small noise, a note,

suddenly stops.  Then steadies again.  He appears to be alone.

173	EXT.    GARDEN.    NIGHT.

Kip is in the tent, looking out of the flap, waiting for Hana.

174*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.

Kip walks in looking for Hana.

174a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Kip enters, sees Hana is not with the Patient, hears his uneven

breathing, then goes out.  From the shadows of the room, CARAVAGGIO

shifts position.   He's slumped on the floor, staring at the man prone

in the bed.

174b*.	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Into her bedroom, Kip can't find her there either.  He turns to go,

walking down the wooden stairs, until her voice stops him in his

tracks.  She's in the shadows of the eaves.

175*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.     NIGHT.

The Patient's eyes open to see Caravaggio at the morphine.

He delivers the injection.  The Patient sighs.  Caravaggio takes off

his jacket.  A pistol is stuck in his waistband.  The Patient sees it.

using his teeth grip the sleeve)

176*.	EXT.   BASECAMP AT CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   1939.   DAY.

Almasy sits on a ridge transferring map of information from his

Herodotus onto a sheet of paper.  He looks up at the sound of Clifton's

approaching Steerman.  He folds up the map and sticks it inside one of

Clifton's CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES and lodges it between the rocks.

176a*.	INT.    STEERMAN.    DAY.

Clifton is flying the STEERMAN up to Gilf Kebir.  From the air it's

possible to make out Almasy scrambling down from the ridge towards

where the stones indicate a landing area, carrying the last of the

materials from the Cave of Swimmers.  Almasy waves in recognition and

welcome.

177	EXT.   BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   DAY.

Almasy watches as the plane drops towards him, shielding his eyes

against the sun.  the plane bounces along the runway, not quite

landing.  Almasy continues packing the equipment.

Almasy looks up to see the plane swerve, now suddenly HEADING STRAIGHT

TOWARDS HIM.  He's completely vulnerable, nowhere to run.  He dives at

the ground.  THE PLANE SMASHES AGAINST AN INVISIBLE RIDGE AND TURNS

OVER AND OVER, the wings snapping off like twigs as it hurtles past the

prostrate Almasy.  He gets to his feet and starts to run towards the

wreckage.

A blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the plane, but no fire.  Almasy

pulls away the debris to find  GEOFFREY - SLUMPED, NECK BROKEN, BLOODY.

He tries to move him, and in the process reveals, to his ABSOLUTE

horror, KATHARINE, STARING GRIMLY AHEAD, UNABLE TO MOVE.  He's frantic.

Almasy starts to pull at the wreck around her.

DURING THIS -

Almasy inspects Clifton, tries to find a pulse.  The smoke circles

around them.  Katharine looks at her husband.

Almasy puts his arm around Katharine to try and pull her clear.  She

can't stand the pain.

The smoke thickens.  He pulls - hard - the pain from which causes

Katharine to gasp, then pass out.  They slip haphazardly to the ground,

cushioned a little by the sand.  He lifts her gently into his arms and

carries her from the danger of the place, then turns and runs back.

THE PLANE SUDDENLY ERUPTS IN FLAMES.  Almasy dashes into the fire,

disappearing into the smoke before emerging with Clifton over his

shoulder, fireman's-lift style.

178	EXT.    THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

He has WRAPPED KATHARINE IN THE SILK FOLDS OF HER PARACHUTE and emerges

from the near the familiar cleft in the rock, struggling with the

exertion of the climb as they approach the Cave of Swimmers.  He has a

large water bottle slung around his neck and a haversack, and is loaded

like a pack horse.  Katharine opens her eyes.

They stagger on.  He suddenly notices a stain of gold at her neck.

It's saffron, leaking from a silver THIMBLE which hangs from a black

ribbon.

Almasy CRIES as he walks - huge sobs, no words - convulsed with the

pain of it.  They approach the Cave.

179*.	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Almasy comes through in shadows, carrying Katharine, blocking out the

light that pours into the entrance of the cave.  Once inside, he sets

her down incredibly gently, makes a bed of blankets and the parachute.

He turns on his flashlight.

179a*.	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

Almasy returns with the stocks of ACACIA TWIGS the Expedition had

cached.  As he makes the fire, the light sends his shadow flitting

across the walls.

The fire is lit and he comes over to her, kneels beside her.

He kisses her tenderly.  Pulls out his HERODOTUS and lays it beside

her.  Then he puts down the FLASHLIGHT.

He's tearing strips from the parachute with his knife.  As he starts to

bind her wrist he gets her to talk, trying to distract her from the

pain.

180	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

ALMASY BURYING CLIFTON.  He's dug a narrow trench, and now he goes to

the body.  Clifton's face is oil stained, bloody.  Almasy takes his

handkerchief and, pouring his precious water into it, CLEANS GEOFFREY'S

FACE.

181	EXT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.

Alamos's walking.  He slides and collapses as he misjudges a dune, gets

up, stumbles on.

182	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAWN.

He trudges on, his eyes opening and closing.  He's singing to keep

awake.  Darktown Strutter's Ball. - I'll be down to get you in the

taxi, honey...  He does a little shuffle.  Looks behind at the crazy

trail of his footprints.

182a*.	EXT.    THE CHOTT.    DAWN.

A vast flat expanse of dried salt lake.  A remorseless horizon.  Almasy

walks, checking the compass, squinting at the sun.  then he sees a

cloud of dust traveling across the horizon.  It comes closer moving at

great speed, reveals itself.  An OSTRICH.

183	EXT.    WELL.    DAY.

Almasy lowers himself by an old rope down into a gully.  He approaches

a pile of stones and removes them to reveal a brackish pool of filthy

water.  He drinks, pouring water over his head, grimacing at the taste,

but parched too.

184*.	EXT.    APPROACHING EL TAJ.    DAY.

Almasy gets his first sight of the fortress town of EL TAJ and sinks to

his knees, in relief and exhaustion.  Then he gets up and trudges

towards the town.  A CORPORAL with a rifle in his hands appears.

184a*.	INT.    EL TAJ.    DAY.

The Corporal brings Almasy into a square.  A young OFFICER appears from

the shadows of his office.  His JEEP is parked in the shade.

hands it to Almasy)

The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.

Almasy sets on the Officer, hauling him by the lapels, but them

immediately loses his balance.  As he stumbles up he gets the stock of

the Corporal's RIFLE across his head, KNOCKING HIM TO THE GROUND.

185*.	EXT.   EL TAJ STREET.    DAY.

Almasy, head pounding, is in the back of the jeep, chained to the

tailgate.  He's desperate.  The Corporal is driving.

Almasy, berserk, starts to yank at his chains, screaming.

186	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

Katharine has been writing in the Herodotus.  The torchlight FLICKERS.

She shakes the torch.   It FLICKERS again.  Then goes out.  Absolute

BLACKNESS.  The sound of her trembling breath.

187*.	EXT.    A TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

A TRAIN scuttles through the desert.

187a*.	INT.    THE TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

Almasy is HANDCUFFED to the metal grille of the goods compartment.

He's lying down amongst a bunch of other prisoners and their little

bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell - some Arabs, some

Italians.

A SERGEANT pushes a lavatory-bound prisoner along the corridor, leaving

behind A YOUNG PRIVATE who sits on a packing case, with a rifle across

his lap, reading a Penguin edition of Gulliver's Travels.  Almasy is in

complete despair to be on the train.  He tries to move, but he's locked

tight to the grille.  He rattles the cuffs against the metal.

ALMASY CAN'T BEAR THIS NEWS.  The SERGEANT returns.

188	INT.    THE TRAIN CORRIDOR.    THE DESERT.    DAY.

The Soldier pushes Almasy along the corridor.  They arrive outside the

lavatory.  The Soldier is distracted for a split second.  Enough for

Almasy to ELBOW HIM savagely in the stomach, winding him, then he KICKS

HIM REPEATEDLY in the head.  He wraps his cuffs around the Soldier's

neck and - yanking them together and twisting - produces a tiny,

efficient and sickening snap.

He finds the KEY to the handcuffs, unlocks them, grabs the soldier and

drags him into the empty lavatory.

189	INT.    TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    EVENING.

Almasy arrives at the rear of the train, passes the Kitchen carriage,

where Arabs sweat over the boiler.  He pulls open the back door only to

surprise a GUARD, who's lolling casually, enjoying the sunset.  Almasy

SHOOTS HIM with his stole rifle.  He clambers over the guard rail and

leaps off the train - tumbling into the desert sunset.

190	EXT.    RAILWAY TRACK.    THE DESERT.    EVENING.

Almasy, silhouetted against the evening sky, walks back down the track,

THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY from the dying Katharine Clifton, no way now

of saving her.  He is a tiny speck in the vast desert.  His heart

broken.  He sinks to his knees in despair.

191*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

The Patient is exhausted.  He has said aloud what has tortured him.

His failure to save Katharine.  He looks at Caravaggio.

192	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    DAY.

Kip is working at a BLACKSMITH'S FORGE in the Stables.  He is heating

pieces of metal.  He has arranged his material on a bench - a bayonet,

a rifle, a piece of bomb casting.

His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.

She goes to kiss him.   He is over the fire and protests.

193*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Caravagio is injecting the Patient with morphine.

194	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    DAY.

Kip hammers the metal into its new shape.  He stops, distracted by

something he's listening to on his crystal set.  It's new he seems not

to fully understand, about a bomb dropping on Japan.  A NEW KIND OF

BOMB.

THE METAL GLOWS A VIVID RED ON THE ANVIL.

Suddenly Kip slops it into the trough of water, sending a great hissing

column of steam.

195*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Caravaggio sits by the Patient.

Kip storms into the room, walks straight up to the Patient and POINTS A

GUN AT HIM.  Caravaggio is taken by surprise.

He approaches the bed.  Caravaggio tries to intervene.

Kip sings the rifle at him, KNOCKING HIM to the floor.

He pulls of his earphones and rams them around the Patient's head,

dropping the set onto the bed.  The Patient listens, coughing.

Hana runs in, alerted by the commotion, stunned by what she sees.

Kip levels the gun at the Patient.  Then breaks it open, throws it down

on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to

leak, some words audible - Eunola Gay... Hiroshima... and from

different voices - It was beautiful!  just beautiful!  Bang! the

biggest bang you ever saw!

196	EXT.    KIP'S TENT.    LATE DAY.

Hana approaches.  Kip is inside the tent, the flap zipped.  She sees

his shadow move, then freeze as she calls his name.  It's like a

confessional.  The flap between them, the man in shadows, Hana

crouched, forlorn.

The shadow doesn't move.  Hana is at a loss.

197	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

The Patient becomes aware of something in the room, opens his eyes,

squints into the darkness and sees A FIGURE hovering against the wall.

He's in the Cave, he thinks, he's seeing the painted figures moving,

he's seeing the Swimmer.

KIP - bare chested, no turban, hair loose - stands in the shadows at

the foot of the Patient's bed.

198	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Kip comes into the room.  Hana sits in the corner.  She is nervous of

him, his look, his intensity.

She stands, goes to him.

199	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.

Next morning and Kip has attached what he was making in the forge - A

NEW HANDLE - to the pump.  Now he works it, producing a steady stream

of water.  His motorbike is against the wall.  He goes to it.

Caravaggio is watching.  He hugs Kip, wrapping his arms around the boy

like a bear.

199a*.	EXT.    HANA'S VEGETABLE GARDEN.    DAY.

HANA stands by her Vegetable Garden.  Kip stops the motorbike.  She

goes to him, stands, FASTENS THE TOP BUTTON of his coat.  You feel she

might jump on the seat behind him.  But she doesn't.

He nods, winds up the throttle, and is gone.

200	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana comes in carrying FLOWERS and sets them down on the table next to

a clutch of MORPHINE AMPOULES.  She picks up the hypodermic to prepare

his injection.  She takes a phial.  THE PATIENT REACHES OUT AND PUSHES

TWO MORE TOWARDS HER.   THEIR EYES MEET, THEN HE SHOVELS ANOTHER, THEN

ALL OF THEM.  She looks at him.  IT'S A MASSIVE, LETHAL DOSE.

Hana starts to prepare the injection, her eyes filling with tears.  The

Patient nods, smiles, whispers.

She kisses him, gently on the mouth.  He closes his eyes.

201*.	EXT.(NEAR THE) BASECAMP. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. 1942. DAY.

The familiar cleft in the rocks.  A PLANE is coming in to land.

202	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

A flashlight flickers in the cave.  ALMASY APPEARS.

KATHARINE'S CORPSE lies where he left her - a ghost on a bed of silk

and blankets.  The chill of the cave has preserved her.  She could be

asleep.  She clutches the Herodotus.

He sobs, whispering to her.  He's terribly cold, exhausted.  He slips

underneath the covers to be next to her, and closes his eyes.

203*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

The Patient is slipping away.  Hana is reading from the last pages of

the Herodotus where KATHARINE HAS WRITTEN IN THE MARGINS.

The Patient looks across AND WHAT HE SEES IS KATHARINE BESIDE HIM IN

THE BED, SMILING, STROKING HIS HEAD, SPEAKING TO HIM.

204	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.

Katharine is writing.  The FLASHLIGHT is faint.  She shivers.

She passes the flashlight across the wall, the painted figures dancing

in the pale light.

205	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

THE BED IS EMPTY, THE MATTRESS STRIPPED.  Hana stands in the doorway,

then sees THE HERODOTUS on the bedside table.

She picks it up, goes to the page of Katharine's letter, continues to

read.

206*.	EXT.    LANE OUTSIDE THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.

Caravaggio is at the gate to the Monastery.  The TRUCK we saw before is

waiting with him.  The PARTISAN with his head bandana and shotgun

remains the same, but now there are CHILDREN in the back and a WOMAN

sits behind the man, nursing a two-year-old.

He gets up into the BALUSTRADE, tentatively finds his balance, then

starts to walk, heel to toe - slowly, and then with more confidence -

along the long thin line of stone.  The children watch intently.  He

turns and bows.

207*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.

Hana walks across the cloisters, passing the chalked hopscotch squares,

leaving it all behind.  Then she stops, bends, retrieves A SNAIL SHELL,

keeps going.  KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES.

208	INT.    THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.

ALMASY SMUDGES KATHARINE'S PALE FACE WITH COLOR.  OCHRE across her

brow, BLUE on her eyelids, RED on her lips.  He presses his cheek to

hers, smoothes her hair.

209*.	EXT.    THE LANE OUTSIDE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.

KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES.  Hana comes out to the truck, carrying her

small bundle.  Caravaggio effects some introduction, beginning with the

woman driver, Gioia.  She and Caravaggio smile like lovers.

Gioia smiles, shakes her hand.  Then Hana meets the others - Gioia's

brother and wife, their children.   She smiles at them.

And she clambers up, sits down between the children.  They exchange

some small stiff, shy smiles, and then the truck bounces away.  Hana

takes one final look at the Monastery as it disappears around the bend

and then turns and confronts the life insisting noisily in the truck.

210	EXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Almasy comes out of the cave, carrying the bundle of Katharine in his

arms, wrapped in the silks of her parachute.

211	EXT.    TIGER MOTH.    DAY.

THE PLANE growls and complains into the air.

212	INT.    TIGER MOTH.    DAY.

INSIDE THE COCKPIT:  THE COUPLE AS AT THE FRONT OF THE FILM.  Almasy

obliterated by goggles and helmet.  Katharine behind him, slumped

forwards as if sleeping.

Almasy banks across the plateau of the Gilf Kebir and glances down.  In

a ravine is a sudden OASIS OF WHITE ACACIAS.  He is mesmerized.

And then it's gone and he passes into the earth without maps - the

desert - as it stretches out for mile after mile.

Almasy, the English Patient, begins to sing - Szerelem, Szerelem -

until that also fades and is replaced by the woman's tender lament

heard at the beginning of the film, singing for all that has been lost.

The sound of gun fire...
