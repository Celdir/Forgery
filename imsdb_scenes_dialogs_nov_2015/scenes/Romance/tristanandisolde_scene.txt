A year younger than I was for my first.

When can I have a stag?

Oh come on!

Why would they join up against the Irish?

Because someone has to stand up to them.

You?

Me, Marke, all the tribes. We cant

resist alone.

I could.

Oh my little warrior. We have to be

careful.

Come home without something for your

Lady there will be hell to pay.

Can I?

The Angles have arrives my Lord, as

well as the Carrods, our fellow Jutes

and the Saxons.

Good. With Marke, all will be here.

Let us hope so.

Thanks.

We heard the news...

Mother, I made this for you

Friends, look at us.

The tribes of Britain. Divided. Weak.

Just as the Irish like us. But if we

were one land united, we would out number

them two to one. We could defeat them

once and for all. That is why we are

here today, to sign this treaty of unification.

But who would be King?

The strongest among us: Lord Marke.

Look if you are happy sending all of

your gold to Ireland, living as slaves

then by all means do nothing.

If we were happy doing that then we

would never have risked coming here.

Friends. My wife is with child, my heart

tells me it is a boy. I want him to

grow old in a land where all of us,

all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute,

Saxon are at peace. This island has

not known unity since the Romans left.

That is why I sign this treaty.

And why should we follow you?

Perhaps, Wictred, because your last

attempt to form an alliance without

the knowledge of half the Barons in

this room has failed.

My Lord! The Irish are here!

Take all your men. Guard the women!

But you...

Tristan! Hurry! Come this way.

How did they know?

Tristan!

Shes with the Gods now Isolde, youll

see her again someday.

Will I?

What news of the treaty?

Good Morholt, good

Your mother loved you so much Isolde

Why did she die Bragnae? Why?

It was an ill fever that took her. Fever.

No. It was her heart.

Your husband?

Oh sister I am so sorry.

A whole generation of men.

Tristan. Son of Aragon. Were his family

now.

Melot!  Melot, this is Tristan.

What shall we do, my Lord?

Rebuild.

Dont hold back

Tristan wont fight me! Look hes scared!

Still won't fight?

Tristan has the heart of a lion.He just

needs some time.

Why did you take off your helmet? You

going to cry? My father died too, but

you dont see me crying!

Melot!

Run! Find another trapdoor to hide under.

Coward!

Tristan!

Tristan! Tristan! Weve found something!

Come on, this way.

You will love it.

I found a trapdoor!

You found a trapdoor? Alright Simon,

will you tell us all how you found it?!

Where does this lead?

Youll see. I like that vase, I think

I'll have that. I always knew the Castle

was built on Roman foundations but we

didnt think anything was left!

Must be a burial crypt or something.

Here we are: the bottom of the keep.

Who else knows about this?

Nobody.

Good.

The savages have rebuilt the castle

at Cornwall, only now its made of stone.

Of Cornwalls next tribute I want slaves.

Young ones. Their future. If Marke resists

have Morholt crush him.

My King.

Morholt.

I have led your armies to victory far

and near. Iv made you rich and powerful.

Yes you have. You have been most loyal.

When I return from Cornwall, I was hoping...

What would please you?

A wife.

Its dark in an hour.

What do you think is really out there?

Britannia. The old Roman lands. Full

of evil and grief.

I want to see it. Do you know what the

future looks like Bragnae?

I see the life you were meant for. Your

father will speak with you.

Am I just a chattel to be traded at

your pleasure? Do I have no say in my

own life?

You have a duty to your King.

You are my father.

Then obey me, daughter.

Your father has given you the news?

And you welcome it?

I accept it.

You know, we are more alike than you

might guess.

How so?

I too dabble in elixirs.  Poison from

the livers of a puffer fish. Just a

taste paralyses all the senses. So if

the blade doesnt kill...

Rendered safe by thistle and bark.

And you know the antidote for this?

Yohimbine.

Makes a hard man even harder.  The only

cure... wild abandon. Till out wedding

day. Im to Cornwall, to deal with rabbles.

Release them.

Leave her!

Take him there. Get a rope. Any man

foolish enough to interfere in any way

shall suffer the same fate.

No! No! Please No!

If there are any more attacks we shall

put our guests to death and raise this

entire land. Take the horses.

When would you strike?

At once. Throw everything we have at

them.

They are hoping you'll do that. On horse

they outnumber us two to one. You would

lead the men straight to their deaths.

So we do nothing?!

Donnchadh would like that even more.

Me to lose face in front of the other

tribes. No, we must act. We must be

decisive but we cannot act alone.

So. Have the good men of York come to

fight with us? Hm? The Saxons of Wessex?

My men dont want to follow a Pict into

battle. Let alone one leading a pack

of Angles and Celts.

Then why are you here?

I thought Tristan should let me command

his men.

I make it my habit to follow no one.

Except Marke.

Marke delivered me from that place when

I was a boy. You ran. So you can understand

that when I think of Kings I think of

him. When I think of cowards...

They are one day from their boats on

the old Roman road. Now who will ride

out with Tristan to fight them?

What is your plan, Tristan?

We will need our two fastest runners.

Go around!

Morholt, theyre back!

Kill the slaves!

Simon!

I dont want to die.

Tristan!

I cant feel my legs or my hands.

Build a second boat.

Tristan!

He shall have a King's service.

Farewell, Tristan of Aragon. Death of

the Irish.

When the Irish came to Cornwall and

my father surrendered. You spared a

dozen out of a hundred. I am even less

kind. The leader and 3 shall take this

message home. As for the rest...

Victory.

Tristan?

Simon too.

Did I love him like a son or did I misuse

him for my own purposes?

He knew. He knew.

Where are we going?

Away.

You're afflicted child. Speak to me!

Your father will find us and have my

head. You are my charge. Please!

I am no ones charge!

You are. And you will be Morholts Lady!

And live a loveless life like my mam?

Where?

Isolde. Wait! Dont!  Isolde. Dont!

Isolde!

Its a man.

Dead?

Alive! Bragnae help me!

Help me!

Start a fire! Quickly!

His heart falters.

What are you doing?

He needs heat. Now! Get your clothes

off! Quickly!

Hurry! Quickly! Smell that? Smell the

poison? When he warms we will need thistle

and bark.

15 years!

Hello.  You've been sleeping a long

time. You're in Ireland. Did you know

that? Shh... It's alright. You're safe

here. No one knows. Don't be scared.

Just sleep... sleep.

Nooo Nooo Noo!

Its alright, you dont need that! I

forgot to tell him about you...

Ill wait outside with the other beasts.

You said no one else knew.

Sorry... Shes... My maid. Sworn to

silence. Um... lie down please. Please?

Its good you are remembering things.

else? The boat I found you in? How you

got this? Too many questions. Here keep

it dry. Here I found bread, you have

water and fire. The ocean is outside

if you wish a bath. You wont know where

you are going so please dont try to

leave. Just trust me.

Why are you doing this?

Ill be back

This is a dangerous game you are playing.

Hes English, Isolde.

Then weve got him prisoner.

Under no circumstances tell him your

name, you hear me? Not if you wish him

to escape this place. Do you hear me?

Youve been away.

I had noticed. Yes I have a bit.

Where?

Bragnae and I were spying the convent

of Brittes ].

Seeking sanctuary?

Some women need it.

Youll find no refuge in a new religion.

Your place is here, with Morholt.

Any word of my betrothed?

Overdue. But comforted no doubt that

you yearn for him.

What's your name?

Oh, I think it's better if we don't

bother with names.

How can I thank you if I don't have

your name?

You just did. If you insist... my name

is Bragnae. I'm a lady in waiting at

the court. My parents are dead. My mother,

she is the source of the kindness you

find so puzzling. My father would've

left you where you fell.

Tristan of Aragon.

Well Tristan of Aragon, I'd guess about

you too, but I think I've already seen

everything.

Sir! I hope you appreciate the risks

we are taking, and will honour us by

leaving as soon as you are able.

She likes me. Shes right though, you

do risk.

There. What of your parents?

They also died when I was a child.

Of what?

A different type of Irish kindness.

Sorry.

Tomorrow then?

Tomorrow.

There she who bore you brought you forth.

Ridiculous.

I happen to believe what that says.

Dont you think there is more to life?

Than what?

Something more than duty and death!

Why are we capable of feelings if not

to have them? Why long for things if

they are not meant to be ours? Well

dont listen to me. Youre so sure of

things. Youre certainty, its like

armour. I wish I had that.

Why would you need it?

The joy of being a lady? Wanting something

I cant have. A life of my own.

Time for sleep now.

Ill follow you later.

You need to rest. In case your betrothed

should want to see you.

Youre promised?

Yes.

Whats he like?

Dark. Tall. Nearly twice your size.

An absolute gentleman.

I thought... earlier when you spoke

of wanting something you cant have.

I didnt know what I was talking about.

Outside, just past that bluff there

is a boat. Thats how you should go

when you leave. You should go soon.

How do you feel?

I dont know

Tristan! Theyve found your boat. At

this very moment the King himself is

scouring the coast. He will find you.

He finds everyone. The tide is coming

lets go!

Come with me. Come with me!

I cant

Why not? Please!

Tristan, weve both known this cant

be. Weve known this from the start.

That doesnt mean it isnt true. It

is. It just cannot be. I want to know

that you are alive somewhere thinking

of me from time to time. I want to know

that there is more to this life and

I cant know that if they kill you.

Please?

Go!

A Cornish warrior may be ashore. Beware.

We seek him as I speak. Hopefully it

is just his rotted corpse we'll find,

for he has slain your betrothed. Morholt

is dead. Fallen in battle. Isolde? Bragnae,

comfort her.

Shes stunned.

As am I by her grief.

We should assulat the British straight

away. Crush them with maximum force.

Maximum force. Like that of Markes

tribe with the maximum force you speak

of? I will not confront them again until

our numbers are refreshed. Until then,

well have cunning divide them.

Of what nature?

A prize, perhaps.

Whats this about a tournament?

Donnchadh. He has offered his daughter

and the lands of Lyonesse as dowry to

whichever English tribe wins. It is

a clever way of setting us against each

other.

Well, the other barons will see through

that.

As baron of Wessex it is my duty to

fight in this tournament for my people.

For yourself you mean.

And what of the support you promised

Tristan?

Tristan is dead. My people have suffered

enough. They see the wealth of Lyonesse

as more real than any alliance. My mind

is set.

And ours as well.

So be it.

You're weary, let me rally your friends.

Ill lead them against D...

Ah, Melot, Melot, Melot. You are my

blood and you are a noble presence but......

Lord Marke! Hes back! Its Tristan!

It cannot be!

Tristan!

I saw you dead.

I am delivered.

A toast! Tristan! Back from the dead.

Tristan. The Irish King offers his daughter

in tournament to divide the tribes.

For the power and the wealth half the

tribes have sent champions to fight

at the...  Tristan!

God knows what happened to him.

"My face in thine eyes, thine in mine

appears,

What?

It is the only way to keep the alliance

alive.

I fail to see how fighting with our

partners keeps us allies.

Well they are all going to the tournament

anyway. By announcing you will share

the dowry with every Baron that remains

loyal and in turn offering to support

whomever prevails, the others would

be compelled to follow you when you

win.

If we win. If we lose we could end up

following Wictred. Id need an infallible

champion!

Me.

You are not yet healed.

Then this trip will be my tonic. I will

be ready. I know I will.

What is the source of this fervour?

Let me go and win you a wife. She can

make peace without spilling one drop

of blood, and maybe heal a wound from

which you still lack.

Truce. You have safe passage.

How do I look?

How do you look?

Where is this Princess? Whats her name?

Isolde? I want to see what she looks

like.

There. Almost done.

No, not quite. If I am to be a present

I should be fully wrapped.

See how the bees come to the honey.

Tristan of Aragon.

So he lives.

For the moment.

Wictred of Glastonbury.

I fight with no champion in my stead.

Know that.

Why Wictred?

Because the Barons will never unite

behind him.

Do you think shes got the pox?

Since the dawn of time...

... Begin!

Make it for real!

What?

I yield!

You were great!

Allow it!

It was too easy for you Tristan. Not

much for a third draw.

Mace.

One more fight Tristan. Take deep breaths.

Wictred: Lord of Saxonberg. Tristan:

Champion of Cornwall. Warriors: Begin!

Yield!

An impressive victory. Of course the

man who defeats Morholt might be expected

to triumph here.

On behalf of Cornwall, I offer your

daughter a place on our throne. The

throne of England, united behind one

leader.

Isolde! Perhaps it is just that he who

took a husband provides one.

Im yours.

No. Tristan of Aragon has won you on

behalf of Lord Marke of Cornwall.

Lets go.

Let them take her across the sea. After

the wedding I'll disavow Isolde, the

alliance will crumble.

Tristan. Princess wants to speak to

you.

You risked your life to give me to another

man.

You said your name was Bragnae. Why

did you do that?

Oh what have I done? Stop this thing.

Say something.

I can't. I won you in my King's name.

But I am yours. You touched me and I

yielded...

It doesn't matter.

It is the only thing that matters Tristan.

Leave with me, I will go anywhere.

Your marriage will end a hundred years

of bloodshed.

My marriage to another man!

Isolde. You will live with this. We

must.

Don't do this to me.

Tristan, weve made shore.

What if shes a hag? Or maybe she wont

have me!

She will brother. Youre the prize.

My Lord.

Isolde? Welcome.

If things were different. If we lived

in a place without duty... would you

be with me?

That place does not exist.

I'll pretend it's you.

Youre trembling. You are far from home

and I am a stranger still. But you mustnt

fear me. My wish is to make you happy,

as a wife.. as a women and hopefully

one day, the fact that I am not whole

will not offend you.

Thats pretty. Did you make it?

It was a present.

Tristan?

Might I stay here a while?

Of course.

Tristan!

Ive never seen him like this before.

Perhaps someone his own age should speak

with him.

They believe you are distant. They are

worried about you. So am I.

I can tell. Laughing at the market,

holding hands, a caress on the neck

when he pours you wine.

He is my husband. I remember his Kingdom

comes before my life.

Yes well, I must confess I thought you

might find more difficulties in performing

your duty.

Am I not permitted a single moment without

mourning? Living with this Tristan as

you said we must.

I live in torture thinking of these

moments. With every look he gives you

I get sicker and sicker. There is a

burning in me, I feel on fire and guilt

and I can't get rid of either. Does

it make you happy to know that?

The Roman Bridge. I can get to it without

being seen. And I will go there anytime

to be there with you.

Welcome bands of Anglia, Rothgar and

Orick. Wessex: Kaye and Wictred.

As you will be King and his daughter

Queen, does that mean Donnchadh will

be coming to the coronation.

It does. On the next full moon, all

will attend.

A lot can happen in a month

Bearing that in mind, and given the

instabilities of our new land I shall

be naming a second. My sister has raised

one, capable of guiding you if the need

should arise. He is a man of passion,

fierce in battle who has learnt to tame

his heart with his head. I give you

Tristan of Aragon.

For the first time since the Romans,

this country stands united.

I cant be your second. Melot must be.

He is blood. Besides, I wish to journey

north.

You no longer sleep at Dor, and now

you dont want to be my second. Do you

find no comfort in your home? These

stone walls that you helped build?

I find these walls a prison.

Why?

Everything I want seems misplaced.

Ever since you were a boy you sacrificed

everything for me. All for one dream.

is natural that you would feel some

loss. It doesnt matter if you want

to be second. You are. I will only be

king if you are my second. Id put it

more gently if I could.

Then I am your second.

Perhaps it is time that you took a wife!

No!

Cant live alone forever.

I can!

Isolde. I was trying to explain to Tristan

the importance of loving. It seems he

might live without it.

Why?

There are other things to live for.

Duty. Honour.

But they are not life Tristan. They

are the shells of life. And empty ones

and in the end all they hold is days

and days without love. Love is made

by God. Ignore it and you can suffer

as you cannot imagine.

Then I will no longer live without it.

Good. Very good! Come, we will be late!

Late?

The warriors ride out on the full moon.

It is an old ritual. I shall miss you

tonight.

How many did you love before me?

None.

And after me?

None.

Lord Marke! Are you hurt?

Nothing but for my pride.

Tristan, I need to speak with you.

Go ahead.

We havent even had a coronation yet

to mark tradition. But now he breaks

tradition and scares all the barons

by naming you as second.

I tried to convince him you would be

better.

Yes well, peace can be just as treacherous

as war and I feel that Marke doesnt

really...Listen to me!!! Our attention

must be on Cornwall now more than ever.

I am sorry he didnt choose you. I am.

Can I speak to you?

What do you think became of them?

They were lives... just lived.

I find myself imaging things in this

place. I decorate it. Books, a harp

there... a child.

Would it be his or mine?

I would have no way to tell, would I?

He is a kind man Tristan, I cannot hate

him. Yesterday at the market I saw a

couple holding hands, and I realised

we would never do that. Never anything

like it. No picnics or unguarded smiles.

No rings. Just stolen moments that leave

too quickly.

Where is Isolde?

I dont know for sure, she was having

a walk in the garden before and Im

afraid I got tired so I returned. Its

my fault.

Youre going to get caught! Both of

you! Hes looking for you right now,

hell see you! I told you this would

happen!

There is another door here, forgotten.

This comes up in the bottom chamber

of the keep.

I hate this.

Hurry! Go on.

Im tired of this. Im tired of lying

for you. Im sick of it.

Then dont.

There is a servings child, quite ill.

Doing better now.

I didnt ask you were you were. Your

heart is beating so fast.

Is it?

Isolde. Is there anything I can do to

make you happier. I want to make you

happy.

Im fine.

Shes in love with Tristan. Theyre

intimates. If I expose them it will

break Markes heart and his hold on

the other Barons.

How?

With Markes champion in chains, well

take Castle Dor. You can man your armies

unopposed. There will be no one defending

you in the waters.

And your price?

I want Markes throne.

When his throne falls apart, well go

over and pick up the pieces.

Tristan? Can I speak with you? Is it

possible... do you think a man blinded

by love... Is it possible that that

man might not see treachery right in

front of him?

No.

Perhaps you could follow her. I cant

ask anyone else. I know. I know what

you think  Im acting like a child.

Normally I can read faces, but with

hers I feel like... I can't be objective.

Shes so delicate.

You really love her.

Oh... I do...terribly. I didnt know

how empty I was. She sustains me, she

thrills me. And when I see this ring,

it is a ring of thorns.

The ring is nothing. She's loyal to

you. I am sure of it.

... If you say so.

I count nine

If they move they will warn us with

a black flag

You bring an entourage?

I can let myself be alone in my position

Lord Marke. But dont worry, they will

stay offshore.  I miss you.

My nephew, Merlot of Cornwall

And Tristan, slayer of my best general,

winner of Isolde, defender of the alliance.

You are a fortunate man.

Indeed.

Tristan! Seems I worried for nothing.

May I dance with the Queen, or does

Tristan have the next one?

Thats right, you have never danced

with Isolde before!

A new song for Tristan. Slow.

Why did you burn it?

You know.

Meet me there in an hour or Ill die.

I could still teach you a thing or two,

dancing being one of them.

Accuse him now.

No, no, no. Well have more than accusations.

Is something the matter?

Im just feeling a little weary thats

all. I might just go and have a lie

down.

Of course.

Friends, friends hear me! Weve forgotten

the full moon isnt it time to ride

out?

No. Tonight it cause for exception.

But the coronation should uphold tradition,

surely it is not to be neglected already?

We honour it. In half a night. Ride

out! Wheres Tristan?

I miss Ireland

Isolde, this must end.

Thats like asking me to stop breathing.

It cannot be.

Please dont leave me. Please!

Isolde? There is someone...  No.

I see how it is in Cornwall. My money

is good enough, my alliance is good

enough, but my daughter you pass amoung

your lieutenants like a whore!

Its not like that.

I see no relation to me here! I will

see this peace end.

You have brought the allegiance to shame.

Who would fight for this?

Seize him. Seize him.

Behold your hero uncle  I would have

no heroes now.

Theyre ashore.

If a man cant rule his woman, how can

he govern an entire Kingdom?

He cant.

We have suffered peace.

Its all been coming apart. I can feel

it

Youre right.

There is very little time. Fortunately,

Donnchadh has no quarrel with anybody

here. Hes asked me to give you a message.

Whats this?

It is compensation for the men you will

lose attacking Castle Dor with Donnchadh

tomorrow. Lets be honest, our people

need a stronger leader.

And who might that be, Wictred?

Melot. Too long the ablest amoung us

has been denied his rightful place.

I pledge you my legiance and offer him

my services as his second.

I like this plan.

I came to apologise. Ive been selfish

arrogantly thinking that perhaps Id

given enough. At least enough to merit

if not your love then at least your

respect. You have a home. A kingdom.

Why was it not enough? Tell me.  Tell

me! You do not know what you have done!

Everything is destroyed, everything!

All because you did not have enough.

Shes loyal to you I am sure of it.

You bloodsucker. What could it had been

had I not stretched out my hand to save

your life. How I curse that day, how

I curse it. And so be with your defence.

Donnchadh marches on us as we speak.

Shes young. I will not let you harm

her!

How long?

Since you thought he was dead. I found

him wounded on the beach in Ireland.

I hid him from my father and I told

him my name was Bragnae. So when he

came to the tournament at Dunluce to

win Donnchadhs daughter he didnt realise

it was me. All this time my heart has

been his, and I am sorry. He tried harder

than you can possibly imagine because

he loves you.

I will coax him out, make sure Donnchadh

knows this.

Of course, of course. You know as things

moved along I suspected them for some

time.

Tristan and Isolde?

You know what I could never work out?

How it was conducted. How she got in

and out of Dor unseen.

The tunnel.

What?

The Roman Tunnel!

Show me.

What is this?

The will of the King. Farwell.

I told him about Ireland. Hes given

us our freedom. Why does loving you

feel so wrong?

Get in.

Tristan, if I do this.

For all time, they will say it was our

love that brought down a kingdom. Remember

us.

Tristan, dont! Tristan! Tristan! Tristan!

Why?! Tristan!

Get the livestock and fuel undercover.

Put some archers on the ramparts.

All the archers have deserted us as

has half the household.

And you stay?

If you are surprised then they have

won already.

Come on, hurry!

Burn it. Their will is as strong as

milk. The seas will unravel us. Where

is Wictred with his key?

It comes up to the Roman foundations

at the lowest level.

This is a godsend!

What will you say to him?

That he will not make any more mistakes

and that it is time for him to move

ba  whats that?!

Aim for the front of the line

They are waiting.

The Irish are inside!

Follow me!

Bar the door make sure no one gets in!

You.

What happened here?

A reward for idiocy. A dozen Irish have

blazed your way.

Melot, I came to aid Marke.

Everyone lies.

I didnt lead them here.

No, I did.

Why?

I thought someone believed in me.

It will be undone.

TristanIm for the wormsswear to me

that you are true.

As we were brothers.

Build my boat.

Theyre here!

Keep them back.

Wictred.

Hes trying to lower the bridge

Traitor!

Give me your shield, were pinned down!

Tristan!

Him too?

No, hes with us!

Tristan!

Tristan! How did you get here?

Secret. Secrets, in the bowls of the

keep.

In the bowls of the keep.

They have reached the palisades.

Then we must keep hope.

Get back! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

Behold! The head of a traitor!

Will you always be little men, who cannot

see what was and could be again? There

is no middle ground! So slay us  or

slay him!

Oblidge them.  Oblidge them!

Take me out of here. Take me to the

river.

Hurry!

Bring her.

Marke, you must come, the battle needs

you. Well lose everything.

I must heed their call, I am the King.

Weve driven them back as far as we

can but they are holding us at the throat.

Goodbye my friend.

Know that I love you Tristan. And wherever

you go, whatever you see, I will always

be with you.

You were right. I do not know if life

is greater than death, but love was

more than either.

"My face in thine eyes, thine in mine
