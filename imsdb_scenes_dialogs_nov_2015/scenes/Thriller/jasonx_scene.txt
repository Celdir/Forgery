JASON-X

BY TOD FARMER

REVISED ROUGH DRAFT

MAY 24, 1999

FADE IN:

DARKNESS.

A scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO -

MONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images

taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths.

AGAIN, DARKNESS.

The year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a

hazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of

dark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign.

BLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM

below.

Small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work

nearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings

with strange devices.

This is an archeological expedition.

INT.  DARK PLACE

The dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small

object buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch

and slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool

to remove the dirt.

They take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE

female (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely.

CLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom.

Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open

the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

They are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging

storm outside and from the raging lust inside.

BACK INSIDE THE VAN.

STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra.

METAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES!

They fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them.

INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

A rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover

everything. Dead. Lifeless.

Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She

turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder.

SHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.

We PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the

storm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM.

EXT.  BASE CAMP

The digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred

shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly.

FAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of

the shuttle ramp.

YLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil.

EXT. MINI-VAN - DAY

YLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky,

physical; holds out a device and checks the reading.

He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly.

KICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic

military garb -

KICKER moves past the group and into the Van.

The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.

INT. ANCIENT CORRIDOR

YLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls,

graffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the

ceiling states -

CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY.

They all take off the goggles and masks. The rest of the group consists

of DELONGPRE(18) good looking, smart ass; JANESSA(17) sexual, scheming

AZRAEL(17) SMALL, COCKY; KKINSA(16), insecure, problematic;

THORGAN(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.

KAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. She's

gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. Something synthetic.

Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.

KKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - -

A CORPSE! Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled

through the forehead by an iron spike.

KKINSA SCREAMS!

Kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as

JANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams!

KAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.

THORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.

Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some

cds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into

his pack.

Yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. DANGER. STAY OUT.

Yllo glares a Thorgan.

A radio crackles.

Yllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass

another hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE

FLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the

beginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.

S they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING

VOICE sounds.

But the group keeps moving.

A corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a

warning written in ancient blood . . .

HELP ME . . .

Suddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them, screaming like a banshee!

Everyone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get

the corpse off her.

DELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. They hear

hysterical laughter and look up to see -

ADRIENNE and STONEY . . . emerge from the shadows laughing

uncontrollably.

Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.

They turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of

a jumbled mess of jagged metal.

As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and

squeeze together. That can't be a good thing . . .

STONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . .

CRYOGENICS LAB.

Adrienne points to a small window in the door.

With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in

the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -

A SKULL AND CROSSBONES

Yllo pushes his way to the window.

Shocked faces.

INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's

massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled

up into a ball, is a body - female, young.

Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.

Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.

Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.

She points to the skull and crossbones.

They don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door

cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes

with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice

crystals crack and fall to the floor.

EXT.  CRYO CELL

Kay moves into the room ahead of the others.

INT.  CRYO CELL

CLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES

They are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open

up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the

body.

--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the

wound in her shoulder, props the body up.

The other enter the icy chamber.

The RADIO CRACKLES . . .

Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a

flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground.

Kicker grabs Yllo.

Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of

blood and -CRACK-breaks it off.

Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled

body on the stretcher.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -

Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete.

Thorgan yanks the door open.

Gas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.

JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber.

As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a

jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk

of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES

looms forward!

JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground

sending ice shrapnel everywhere!

Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body.

Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason.

OVER HIS SHOULDER - HALL

A pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor.

BACK INSIDE

One of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP.

FZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left

arm falls to the ground!

Kay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She

injects him. The drugs take immediate effect.

CLINK - CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

HALL

The metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our

heroes.

Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.

Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm.

Kay-Em injects him again.

The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges.

He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.

Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl.

At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically.

Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.

KAFOOM!

Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids

follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear

around the bend - towards the exit.

A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -

CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

A dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! Some are old and rusty, other

slump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well.

INT.  LONG CORIDOOR

Kicker is running backwards, BLASTING with his weapon. Lasers FLASHING

all around our group.

A laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice.

Thorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER.

They round a corner . . .

CHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling.

KABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above.

Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting!

Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very

acrobatic move.

Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his

friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall!

Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left.

Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety.

He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker.

Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as

spider's cover the floor below them, then -

A spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's

thigh. He screams.

Boeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the

spiders falling with the pack.

EXT. SURFACE - DAY

The sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman.

Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.

The others dive for the ground as -  -

KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!

Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle.

FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.

Azrael stops in a panic!

She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp.

The door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the

sky.

EXT.  ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE

THE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old

satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc.

INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

Navigating through the debris, FAT LOU grabs a radio mike.

Through the front windshield we see - -

GRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge

torpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old.

INT.  DOCKING BAY

The shuttle doors open revealing SERGEANT BRODSKI and six E-X GRUNTS

standing with weapons at the ready.

As the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two

stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO.

YLLO ignores him, turns to his team.

The E-X Grunts step in front of kids.

The team moves through the Grunts.

Brodski looks down at the stretcher with the young woman's body on it.

Brodski attempts to shove Kay-Em out of his way . . . BUT she stands her

ground . . . grabs his crotch.

Brodski and Yllo look at Thorgan.

The stretcher with JASON moves by them. Brodski looks down.

Reluctantly, Brodski steps aside. As the kids follow, Azrael bumps into

DALLAS, one of the E-X GRUNTS. Azrael glares at him, brandishing the

severed limb.

Dallas slaps Azrael across the back of the head as he passes.

Dallas and the grunts laugh.

INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

FAT LOU and BERNIE, a synthetic pilot existing only from the waist up in

his pilot's chair, set course for home.

INT.  LABS

Dark, quiet, until the lights glare on.

LAB ONE doubles as a Medical Research center and Sick Bay. GLASS JARS

filled with some of the strangest creatures ever seen cover the back

wall.

Yllo and the students bring the girl in. Their movements are hurried and

economical . . .but they're excited.

Thorgan and Delongpre lift the Girl onto the rejuvenation table.

Stoney whispers something to Kkinsa before he exits with Adrienne.

Kkkinsa nods and wheels a huge SCANNING MACHING over to the Girl. She

starts the scan as Delongpree and Thorgan cut the clothes off their

"find".

Delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face.

Thorgan cuts her shirt off.

INT.  LAB TWO

Adrienne and Stoney push Jason into the lab.

LAB TWO is smaller and less high-tech than LAB one. They shove JASON'S

body onto the EXAM TABLE.

She removes chucks of ice from JASON'S FACE.

Stoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason . . . and he is THAWING.

INT.  LAB ONE

Yllo walks around the room, overseeing all the action. He's excited and

cocky.

Azrael sits in a large machine. This is . . .

The NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of

Nano-Technology.

Azrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into

action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm.

Delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his

shoulder.

Delongpre presses a button on the table. The edges of the table RISE UP

to create a clear dome around the table. A hot gel-like substance shoots

out of small tubes. The FROZEN BODY is covered in the NANO-GEL.

Thorgan checks a monitor.

Yllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction.

Adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen.

No hands.

INT.  LAB TWO

Adrienne scans Jason with a machine identical to the one Kkinsa was

using in LAB ONE.

A monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body. The internal organs are

distorted and bloated. She keys into the next lab.

Back to lab one.

Jason's 3-D scan appears on one of the big monitors.

Within Jason's skull is a brain the size of a golf-ball.

Thorgan grabs his crotch.

She eyes Stoney. He smiles knowingly.

KAY-EM 14 presses a series of buttons. A long needle punctures the

GIRL'S NECK. Jason's scan is replaced by the girl's. We see

Nanotechnology going to work replacing her wounds and damaged cells.

Kkinsa and Stoney back out of the room unnoticed.

Yllo exits.

INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

The door swishes open. Stoney enters with Kkinsa close behind. Kkinsa

raises her hand.

Stoney moves back. Kkinsa moves close hand raises above her head.

Kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head.

A bed slides out from the wall, hitting Stoney in the back of the legs,

causing him to fall on the bed. Kkinsa straddles him. Stoney grabs her.

The two fall into a feverish kiss.

INT.  LAB TWO

Adrienne is prepping various medical tools. JASON'S BODY is laying on an

autopsy table. Steam rises from his body as thick ooze drips from his

thawing flesh.

She turns on a computer monitor.

Two metal sinks hiss as liquid nitrogen flows.

She picks up a long, sharp chrome tool and walks over to Jason's body.

INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

Yllo enters and approaches a computer console. The door behind him

opens. Janessa enters.

She drops her shirt to the floor. Yllo retrieves it, hands it back.

He forces her into the hall, closes the door, locks it. He returns to

the console.

EXT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - EST.

A huge cylindrical ship, floats quietly. We hear a BEEPING sound.

INT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - PEREZ QUARTERS

Joshua Perez rolls over, clicks on a light. He fumbles for a button,

presses it. A wall monitor lights up revealing Yllo's face.

INTERCUT AS NEEDED

Yllo inserts a disk into the console.

Yllo smiles.

INT.  LAB TWO

Adrienne leans over JASON'S THAWING body. Oozing goo drips from the

slab.

She is inches away from his steaming mask. She taps it with her tool.

She begins working at the straps of the mask, cutting the overgrown

flesh away.

INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

Yllo studies a monitor. On screen: a document entitled, EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS

OF DISCOVERY. He talks on the secure line.

Yllo's face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune.

INT.  HALL OUTSIDE YLLO'S QUARTERS

Janessa has hooked up a small device to the door. She's heard every

word.

INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

Kkinsa rips off Stoney's shirt. Stoney grab her and rolls on top of her.

INT.  LAB TWO

CLOSE ON JASON'S HAND - it curls, the frozen joints CRACKLE.

Adrienne turns from Jason's mask. A large wad of goo hits the floor. She

turns back to her work. Slicing flesh away from the mask.

INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

Stoney and Kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each other's

pants off.

INT.  LAB TWO

Adrienne tries to pry the Mask off . . . but it holds firm.

She stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole. We hear disgusting

noises as she probes JASON'S EYE SOCKET.

She removes the tool, and on the end is Jason's eye!

Holding it close she looks at it. It is bloated and distorted. She drops

it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station.

INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

Kkinsa rolls on top of Stoney. She holds his arms down as she whispers

in his ear.

Stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her.

INT.  LAB TWO

JASON'S LEG JERKS!

Adrienne turns again, then approaches.

She frowns at the disgusting ooze. A mixture of swamp waters, blood, and

other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body.

She moves back to her work station and picks up JASON'S BLOATED EYE. She

takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye.

The laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out

of the eye. Adrienne stares into a microscope. This is all very

interesting.

INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

Stoney lies on top of Kkinsa.

. . . a moment, then both GASP as he enters her.

INT.  LAB TWO

JASON sits up!

CLOSE on ADRIENNE as she studies the dripping eye. She puts the laser

down and turns to the slab and freezes.

JASON IS GONE!

She spins around only to find Jason standing behind her. He grabs her by

the throat! She can't scream. She kicks wildly as he studies her.

INT.  LAB ONE

Delongpre, Boemen, Kay-Em 14 and Thorgan wait and watch girl in the

NANO-GEL. Thorgan is getting impatient. He can't find something.

INT.  LAB TWO

Adrienne is thrown into a work light. The room goes dark.

INT.  LAB ONE

Thorgan exits.

INT.  LAB TWO'S OBSERVATION ROOM

The lights go. Thorgan looks around. Through the thick glass, where

JASON is killing Adrienne, is blackness.

Thorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass.

ANTE ROOM

Through the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming. But NO SOUND.

All rooms are air tight. Her head is smashed on the glass!

Still screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan

looks over his shoulder.

He exits.

BACK TO JASON

As he - -

DUNKS Adrienne's head INTO ONE OF THE METAL SINKS. Her body goes limp. He

pulls her head up and stares at her frozen head, eyes open, mouth locked

in a scream.

He thumps the head against a wall. IT SHATTERS! Jason drops the body

with a thud then turns to the - -

DISSECTION TOOLS. He chooses a long silver cleaver.

JASON'S BACK!

EXT.  LAB ONE CORRIDOR

Jason walks into the corridor from LAB TWO, steam still rising from his

cold body. He heads away from LAB ONE as soon as he's out of sight, YLLO

appears.

INT.  LAB ONE

Delongpre wakes as Yllo enters.

Boeman grabs a wall mike.

INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

Kkinsa straddles Stoney.

Her back arches in ecstasy.

They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the

door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -

JASON VOORHEES!

Standing in the hall. He swings the silver cleaver.

Stoney sidesteps as Kkinsa SCREAMS. Stoney SLAMS his palm into the door

panel. The door SWISHES to close but Jason's hand reaches out and stops

it.

ENGINES WINE as JASON STRUGGLES to force the door open.

Stoney keeps POUNDING the panel, trying to make the door close but

Jason's too strong!

Jason grabs Stoney by the arm, jerks him into the doorway and releases

the door.

The door closes! Splitting Stoney from forehead to crotch!

Splashed with blood, Kkinsa falls to the floor cowering . . .

mumbling nonsensically.

INT.  LAB ONE

Yllo, Janessa, Thorgan, Boemen and Delongpre anxiously huddle around the

Frozen Girl's body. Probes dangle in the gel.

Kay presses buttons. We hear the whine of something powering up . . .

Brodski enters the lab.

An electrical noise flares THE SCREEN TO WHITE:

INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

OUR VIEW FROM A JERKY POV

Running, freshly killed bodies at our feet. HEAVY BREATHING.

Small fists beat against a door.

The door swishes open revealing the dead bodies of a couple in their

forties.

CLOSE ON THE GIRL

We recognize her as the frozen girl. Her name, RIZZO (18), pretty.

She screams. Turns.

HER POV

Standing at the end of the corridor, back lit and ominous is JASON

VOORHEES! He marches towards her.

She runs. Snatches a headset from a wall mount.

STATIC from the radio. Jason closing.

She reaches down and grabs a shot gun from a dead Security Guard. Chick-

chick. KABLAM!

Jason keeps coming.

She runs.

As she rounds a corner, we  see - -

CRYOGENICS LAB

She opens the door and enters the cold room. Slips on the wet frozen

ground, nearly falls.

ON JASON as he rounds the corner, sees the open door.

INT.   CRYO LAB

Jason enters, his machete held ready. He stares at the Huge Cryo unit.

Door open. Otherwise the room is empty.

Jason turns. Rizzo is standing in the hall, the shotgun ready.

KABLAM! Jason slides backwards on the slick floor.

KABLAM! Further, he nearly falls.

KABLAM! He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit.

Rizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, JASON

INSIDE.

RIZZO tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad.

Steam HISSES, engines hum to life. The Cryo-Unit, Bucks violently.

Slowly the unit goes silent, still. Rizzo stares at it, approaches

slowly, staring at the fogging glass -

KA-CHING!

The MACHETE BURSTS THROUGH THE GLASS, slicing into Rizzo's shoulder!

ALARMS SOUND. The cryo lab's main door SLAMS shut.

She rushes toward the door. It won't budge.

CHSHSHSHSHSH!

Gas filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo-Unit.

Rizzo begins to fade. She stumbles.

Cryo gas rolls along the floor . . .

As blood pours from her wound, she reaches her bloody hand to the glass

window and draws -

A SKULL AND CROSSBONES.

-then passes out.

INT.  LAB ONE

RIZZO'S EYES pop open. She gasps for breath. Coughing and splitting the

Gel-like substance. She's sitting in a foot of gel, naked; Yllo, Brodski

and the kids around her.

Yllo moves close to Rizzo.

WHAM! Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose.

Rizzo's disoriented, confused. Gel slops all around her.

Rizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh.

Delongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself.

Rizzo finally takes a good look at where she is. Something is very wrong

in her world.

Rizzo gasps -- a shocking revelation.

Delongpre frowns at Yllo and moves to Rizzo.

Delongpre helps Rizzo off the table.

INT.  LAB FOUR

Rizzo stands at a small window looking out into space. Cleaned up she is

quite beautiful.

Rizzo is startled. She looks around.

Delongpre comes through the door with a plate of food.

He puts the food on a small table and moves to the window.

She turns back to the window.

Delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit.

She collapses onto the bed.

Rizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years.

Delongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him.

Rizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket

of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a

picture...a picture of her parents. She sits on the bed and starts to cry.

INT.  LAB ONE

As Delongpre enters all eyes turn to him.

Yllo laughs at his own joke.

Theyturn. Rizzo approaches Delongpre and Yllo.

Yllo nods then --

WHAM!

Rizzo punches him again.

She shoves Delongpre out of the way and out the door.

INT.  LAB TWO - MOMENTS LATER

The others enter to find Rizzo leaning over Adrienne's headless body.

Thorgan throws up.

Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage.

INT.   GRID 52

Azrael moves through a maze of walls and pipes. Stea, HISSES lights

STROBE.

He's dressed in full military garb, a huge gun strapped to his hsoulder.

STALKING POV

Something watching Azrael, his back to us. Azrael moves. The stalker

closes in.

Suddenly Azrael hits, rolls and comes up Blasting right at us.

HIS POV

A HUGE ALIEN CREATURE, fangs, claws and so on, leaps at him. THe big

blaster hits home. The alien DISINTERGRATES.

Sitting on the floor, Azrael sighs and wipes his brow.

SUddenly, another alien rises up behind him with a hideos Screech.

There's nothing Azrael can do. He's a goner. Then --

FZZT! A blast from elsewhere DISINTERGRATES THE CREATURE. MOVE TO

REVEAL--

DALLAS, the grunt Azreael had words with earlier.

Dallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it

lunge a half dozen more.  Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet,

take aim, when --

ONE OF THE ALIENS IS CUT IN HALF!

GREEN GOO squirts from its body.

JASON VOORHEES

SLASHES THROUGH another alien, splitting it down the middle.

Then another.

Azrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason.

Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in

unloading on the hulinking terror.

THeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever.

Suddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to

Dallas and Azrael.

Jason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched

whistle.

Why aren't they running.

Jason raises his silver blade high.

SLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his

rib cage. Blood spurts

as his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt,

only pissed.

JASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off.

The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks.

The sound of an ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN.

Jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white,

sterile.

No creatures, no Dallas or Azrael. A both ends of the white garganuan

room we see a small tinted glass.

Azrael's voice booms over a loud speaker.

INT.  BOOTH ONE

Azrael sits before a huge console wearing a virtual reality suit.

INT.  BOOTH TWO

Dallas is in his own suit from the opposite booth.

Jason stares at the tinted glass of Azrael's booth.

INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

INT   LAB TWO

The reaction to the broadcast.

Jason starts to close in on Azrael's pod.

Suddenly, JASON shoves his fist through the glass.

The sounds of Azrael's DEATH broadcast over the lab.

When Jason retrieves his hand, he holds a bloody mass of Azrael's

insides.

IN THE LAB, Brodski takes charge.

DALLAS fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself

into combat mode...BUT...

JASON hears the movement. Turns, flings his silver blade.

It flies across the room, throught the glass and impales Dallas' throat

to his chair.

The blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to

black.

INT.  LAB TWO

As the connection goes to static.

Nothing. Finally...

She gets up and heads for the door.

Yllo who has been losing control takes on the lead again.

EXT.  GAME GRID CORRIDOR

Sven and Kicker approach the door. Casually, weapons slung low. The

doors hiss open, the black maw of the game grid on the other side.

Their combat sense perks up a bit. Something's not right. They turn on

their lights and ready their weapons.

INT.  GAME GRID

WIDE:  Hard beams of light search for anything.

Sven, as his beam hits Azrael's pod.

From inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach. THe blood splattered inside

Kicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his

lunch.

Kicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds

his friend.

INT.  LAB TWO

Everyone is in shock except Brodski...he's a pro.

KICKER IN THE GRID

From behind him a shape materializes. A hand reaches out of the

darkness.

KICKER JUMPS! Spins around with his weapon at the ready!

IT'S SVEN!

INT.  LAB TWO

Brodski is in assault mode.

Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment.

Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin.

Rizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy.

Yllo is getting no response.

Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood.

Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp.

Kkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over

to her with a blanket.

They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do...Rizzo

puts her head in her hands...not again.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Brodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall.

They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM.

The door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one

wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in.

Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind.

INT.  LAB ONE

Yllo enters pissed off. The others are standing around not sure what to

do.

Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her.

Rizzo is very frustrated.

Thorgon looks up from his work.

AN ALARM SOUNDS.

INT. CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

kicker, sven, CONDOR, BRIGGS, and GEKO are locked and loaded. Dressed in

full armor,

packing massive high tech weaponry, they are a sight to see. Jason may

have met his

match.

The boys fidget with excitment. Bout time they see some action.

The men LAUGH and high five.

INT.  LAB ONE

Yllo walks in and sits at a bank of monitors. Through one, we see the

team standing at the cargo doors.

Yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console. He

has his own agenda.

INT.  CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

The doors HISS open.

INT. CARGO BAY

A massive room. Boxes stacked hihg, some to the ceilin,g creating a

maze.

They split up.

INT. LAB ONE

The kids are standing at a schematic of the ship. Several small blips

are entering the cargo area.

Rizzo stands over Thorgan to see the monitor.

For the moment, Rizzo looks distantly hopeful.

INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

Briggs and Geko move side by side. Condor brings up the rear. Suddenly

he is jerked out

of view.

CLOSE ON CONDOR'S FACE, jason's hand around his throat. SNAP. The eyes

go dead, the neck broken.

INT. LAB ONE

Rizzo sees something. Her hopes fade.

DISAPPEARS?

All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips FLICKERS and FADES.

INT.  CARGO BAY - STARBOARD

Sergeant Brodski stops.

INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

Briggs and Geko stare at each other.

BACK TO BRODSKI

INT.  LAB ONE

A BLIP flashes for a second on the screen.

INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

BRIGGS and GEKO split up, moving around a large metallic tank.

BRIGGS INFARED POV

Gun ready, he moves around the crated fuselage slowly.

INT.  LAB ONE

The blip flashes again.

INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

INFARRED POV reveal GEKO moving toward him.

Briggs removes his gogles only to find Jason standing before him,

holding Geko's body...impaled

onto his silver blade.

BRIGGS fires...screams.

INT.  LAB ONE

PAINFUL GURGLES then two more blips disappear.

Rizzo is cowering on the floor, her hands over her ears. She's sweating,

convulsing.

INT. CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE

Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter. Briggs

and Geko lie dEAD

AT THEIR FEET.

INT. LAB TWO

Yllo is talking on  aseparate mike. Unwaakre of the slaughteri n the

next room.

BACK TO YLLO.

Yllo disconnects, and turns to the other console.

INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

GUNFIRE ERUPTS!

INT. LAB ONE

CHEERS from everyone except Rizzo who knows better. She shakes her head.

INT. CARGO BAY - MIDSHIP

Sven is kneeling over Jason's body.

Suddenly, Jason reaches up, grabs the back of Sven's head and SLAMS it

into his mask.

Sven's forehead shatters.

ON BRODSKI

As he races around a crate. Sven's body is within sight. His killer

nowhere to be seen.

Elsewhere we hear GUNFIRE followed closely by a SCREAM!

ELSEWHERE

Kicker crawls across the floor, blood spews from his mouth.

PULL BACK TO RVEAL

He's been split in half at the wait...his entrails dragging behind him..

SHUNK! A machete throught the back of the neck puts him out of his

misery.

INT. LAB ONE

INT. CARGO BAY

Brodski runs. He's spooked. Twisting and turning in every direction.

Brodski races toward the Cargo exit.

INT.  LAB TWO

ON MONITOR

We see Brodski racing towards us. We also see Jason, lying in wait,

hidden by one

of the crates.

Yllo considers then.

On the monitor we see Brodski move forward. He never saw Jason coming.

BRODSKI SCREAMS.  Yllo turns his head.

INT.  LAB ONE

The kids stand in shock, silently staring at one another, listening to

the

static of the dead communications. Boeman reaches over and clicks off

the radio.

Silence.  Rizzo leaps to her feet.

Kkinsa starts t cry.

Rizzo looks at everyone.

A side door HISSES OPEN. Yllo enters.

Rizzo starts for the door but Yllo grabs her arms, holds them behind

her.

Janessa readies a hypo.

Janessa moves behind Rizzo with the sedative.  Suddenly Rizzo throws her

head back, Salmming it into Yllo's nose. He CRIES OUT in pain.

Janessa lunges with the syringe but Rizzo snatches her wrist, grabbing

the hypo, burying it into Janessa's left breast.

Janessa collapses.  Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman

stands, blocks his path.

Thorgan timidly raises his hand.

Rizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall.

Kkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open.

The others stare at her. She's crazy.

She and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them.

But the kids aren't so sure.

INT.  LAB TWO

Yllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console.

A series of beeps.

INT. GRENDEL BRIDGE

Fat Lou and Bernie prepare for course corrections.

EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

She banks slowly to the right.

INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

Suddenly, Bernie is ripped from his chair! Electricity SHOOTS through

the console

as Bernie's DIALOG becomes jibberish.

Fat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop

of her.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

FAT LOU'S upper body has disappeared. In other words, Bernie now has

legs.

Little good they'll do him.

THROUGH WINDSHIELD.

Far in the distance we see a tiny space station -- SPACE LAB.

A monitor reads ...

SPACE LAB ETA 00:35:59 and counting.

INT.  CARGO BAY

Rizzon and Kkinsa enter.

Kkinsa points. They head in that direction. Then Rizzo suddenly stops.

Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates.

Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's

mouth.

Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her.

INT.  LAB ONE

The crew has packed their essentials and now wait to dock with Space

Lab. Yll is standing

before the others holding Jason's machete.

thing.

The kids and Crutch stare at him. Cold hearted.

INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

Rizzo and Kkinsa approach.

Kkinsa punches in a series of buttons. Nothing.

INT.  LAB ONE

Yllo grabs a mike from a console.

STATIC.

STATIC.

Boeman moves to one of the consoles, clicks a few buttons.

ON MONITOR

We see the view from the bridge security camera. Lots of blood and the

mangled combination of Lou and Bernie.

All eyes turn to Yllo, for guidance, his back to the outer door.

Jason is out there. Then --

WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

The outer door bucks and dents! Everyone jumps!

WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

Over the headsets, Rizzo and Kkinsa hear the SCREAMS.

Kkinsa keeps trying the code box. Nothing.

INT.  LAB ONE

WHAM! WHAM!!! But the door is starting to give.

Through the confusion, Crutch moves to one of the consoles. Clicks

away at the keyboard.

INT.   SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

The shuttle hums to life.

INT.   LAB ONE

WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!

Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table. Crutch goes to work on a

ceiling

vent, removing screws.

The top corner of the door bends...Jason peers through.

Our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space.

With that, the door gives!

Boeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself.  Jason

pauses,

staring at Kay-Em --

Jason's heard enough. He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks. Turns and

leaps

through the hole in the celing.

INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

Yllo grips the ledge.

Then Yllo screams. Jason has him from below. Boeman grabs his arms.

DeLongpre grabs hold and pulls. Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their

grasp. They fall onto their backs breathing heavily.

INT.  LAB ONE

Yllo leaps to his feet. Jason looms over him.

Jason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo. It's on the machete

sticking through

Yllo's belt. Jason reaches for it. Yllo backs into a wall.

Jason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it. He

drops

the cleaver to the ground.

INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

The shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset --

Yllo screams.

INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

Yllo's SCREAMS turn to GURGLES. All eyes stare at the opening in the

walkway, then --

YLLO'S HEAD LANDS IN BOEMAN'S LAP!

JASON STICKS HIS HEAD THROUGH.  EVERYONE JUMPS, SCREAMS.

They race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical

wires, Crutch

in the lead.

INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

Kkinsa enters the shuttle, turns to Rizzo.

But, Rizzo hesitates. We can still hear the PANICKED SCREAMS over the

headset.

Rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving

Kkinsa nearly

insane.

INT.  CELING WALK SPACE

Crutch comes to a fork in the walkway.

At the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind

him.

Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan

Racing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping

over and under and through whatever blocks the path.

Jason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him.

Crutch comes to ascreened panel. Boeman kicks it open.

They leap down onto a catwalk crossing the --

INT.  CARGO BAY

They are twenty feet off the ground as --

Rizzo stops, stares straight up.

HER POV

the group races across the catwalk as Json leaps down behind them.

Then Jason grabs Delongpre, who screams.

RIZZO,

spots a gun left by one of the marines. She snatches it, points it

towards

Jason and Delongpre then aims a little high.

FZZZT!

It slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling.

The catwalk jerks. Everyone tumbles. Jason loses his grip on Delongpre.

Suddenly, METAL SCREECHES, as the catwalk gives under the weight. It

RIPS in half,dumping both

heroes and Jason.

RIZZO dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the

ground!

Janessa sits up rubbing her head.

Kay-Em 14 sits up, sings.

He's lying on top of Jason. He scrambles to his feet. But Jason doesn't

move.

The group slowly gathers around. Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan.

Boeman pulls him out of

the way just in time.

Jason starts to stand when RIZZO comes up behind him.

KA-FWAM! She brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of

Jason's head.

He collapses. The surrounded faces look happily suprised.

Boeman takes the gun from Rizzo.

Rizzo gestures at what's left of Geko's body.

They take off running.

Everyone stops, turns --

Rizzo catches up.

The kids look at one another as if this were a stroke of genius.

Crutch again leads them through the maze. Delongpre stops at

another Grunt body, removes a chain gun. THorgan takes a high

tech laser from another.

Jason steps out in front of Crutch, his machete held poised in front of

him.

Crutch runs right up onto the blade.

Alrhoguh he's meat on a stick, Crutch doesn't give up. He SLAMS his

fists into

Jason's torso.

Thorgan turns to fire --Boeman KNOCKS the barrel high.

Boeman tosses his weapon to Janessa and leaps on Jason's back, locking

his arms

around his neck.

Delongpre smashes the back of Jason's knee with the chaingun.

Jason topples on top of Boeman. Crutch is thrown free.

Janessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the

first time in 400 hundred years.

It's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. He leaps to his

feet and races towards her.

BRAAAAAAATTTT!

The chaingun dances Jason backwards. He CRASHES through the side of one

of the

cargo boxes. EVERYONE STOPS.

She jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate.

But the crate is empty.

They spin around, searching.

Carrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay.

INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT

Kkinsa sits in the pilot's seat. She's terrified.

INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

DeLongpre shoves Boeman out of the way.

INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

Kkinsa doesn't move.

INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

Kkinsa considers. She reaches for a button marked SHUTTLE

DOORS...hesitates.

INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

Kay-Em 14 steps forward.

Rizzo backs away -- as Kay-Em nears the mike ...

Rizzo shoves Kay-Em out of the way.

INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

INT.  CARGO BAY SHUTTLE

Jason is standing at the entrance to the Cargo Shuttle Bay.

INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

Kkinsa leans forward and presses --

LAUNCH.

INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

The Shuttle ROARS to life and begins pulling away from the ship.

EXT.   GRENDEL CLASS IV

The shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position.

INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

Rizzo opens fire! Thorgan and Delongpre join in.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire. Smoke rises. It's

impossible

to see where Jason is. RIZZO stops FIRING.

But, they don't let up. Boxes explode, crates collapse until --

Thorgan's gun clicks empty.

Then Delongpre's.

SILENCE.

The smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble.

Suddenly, Jason again steps into the Cargo entrance.

They are trapped. Jason blocks the only exit. He slowly moves towards

them.

But Jason has locked in on Rizzo. He moves towards her.

Rizzo and the others back into a corner. Jason has them. There's nothing

they

can do.

Rizzo holds the gun steady, waiting for point blank range.

INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

SPACE LAB, which was only a dot the last time we saw it, suddenly looms

toward us.

EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

The left side of Grendel SMASHES into the side of Space Lab!

INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

Suddenly everything shifts toward the bridge. Boxes, cargo, kids, and

Jason!

EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

Grendel SLIDES along SPACE LAB, ripping huge chunks of metal from both.

SPARK fly. There are interior EXPLOSIONS on Space Lab, then --

KA-FOOM!

Space Lab EXPLODES!

INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

The entire ship shifts upwards. Cargo, crew, and Jason fly into the air.

ELECTRICAL fires sprout up all over. Cargo boxes SHATTER, contents

SPILLING.

RIZZO loses her gun.

EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

Debris from Space Lab TEARS into the side of the ship and beyond.

EXT.  SHUTTLE

One huge chunk heads right towards the Shuttle.

INT.  SHUTTLE

Kkinsa stares out the window as the huge chunk flies toward her.

EXT.  SHUTTLE

IMPACT! THE SHUTTLE IMPLODES! ONE BRIGHT RED FIREBALL.

INT.  CARGO BAY

Everything piled and in tatters. Our heroes slowly regain their

bearings.

Kay-Em 14's right arm is missing, wires sticking out of the stump.

Janessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble. Boeman helps her to her

feet.

Rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body.

It's battered and twisted all out of place. Boeman falls next to the

body.

Rizzo stares at Boeman.

SUDDENLY a pile of rubble EXPLODES.

Jason rises, his back to them.

But Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he

rushes after them.

INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

INT.  CARGO BAY

Our kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them --

Thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly.

The door won't open.

They turn as Jason looms toward them, then --

EVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT

Cargo and debris. Our heroes. Jason.

The loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum SLAMS him into

the

cargo doors, BREAKING them open and sending him tumbling backwards.

Kay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the

back of the head.

Still holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of

frame.

The force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the

ceiling.

A SEVERED ARM

floats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand.

Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason.

BRAAATTTT...

Jason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun SLAMS

Delongpre into a back wall.

He's knocked unconcious.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck.

Janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious

dELONGPRE'S FOOT.

CARGO - MIDSHIP

Jason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay,

unable to stop himself.

BOEMAN

reaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the

locks of his

hair, pulls himself closer.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a

hanging piece of

busted catwalk.

Crutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his

open gut,

tangling around our heroes.

RIZZO'S POV

Rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa,

Boeman, and Delongpre.

ANOTHER ANGLE

AS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then

pushes off with his feet.

HE ROCKETS toward her!

Rizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED...

and bad. She's gonna miss them.

Boeman flips in the air!

Delongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum

spins the human

chain into a near wall --KAFWAM-- nearly breaking it apart.

Jason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall --

As Thorgan pulls the group out of the Cargo bay.

They watch as Jason grabs a hold of the walkway.

Jason takes aim.

INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

INT.  CARGO BAY

Jason again ROCKETS THROUGH THE AIR -- when

GRAVITY IS RESTORED.

He drops to the cargo floor like a rock! Falling cargo -- huge crates,

gargantuan machines,

a forklift -- buries him.

Our heroes tumble to the ground.

They stand slowly, eyeing the rubble.

INT. SHIP CORRIDORS

Our group makes their way back toward the labs.

ELECTRICAL fires are everywhere. Systems are shorting out all over the

ship.

INT. LAB ONE

Rizzo, in the lead, enters the lab, when the ship BUCKS and QUAKES! A

portion of the hall

collapses behind her.

INT. CORRIDOR

Boeman and the others dive back out of the way.

INT.  LAB ONE

Boeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull.

Rizzo turns, spots the red lever. EMERGENCY PRESSURIZATION STABILIZER.

It's bolted.

Rizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table. BASHES the bolt with it, until

it breaks.

She grabs the lever...then hesitates. Backs away.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Boeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way!

INT.  LAB ONE

Boeman climbs through a hole in the rubble. He grabs the lever.

Boeman yanks the lever.

As the others climb into the lab --

Thorgan rushes over to the big Nano-tech machine. Places his broken arm

on the slab.

The machine quickly goes to work.

A schematic of his arm appears on the wall.

Janessa stares at him.

Delongpre shrugs.

It seems it is.

Janessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their

relationship

went beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from

the ship's

hull.

All heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The

left hull

of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the

various

system failures. Rizzo points to the right hull.

Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls.

They stare at her.

The others stare at her as if she were crazy.

A moment of consideration. Could this actually work?

Obviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices

from under

a cabinet.

Thorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine.

Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him.

They climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear.

INT.  CARGO BAY

Boeman, Janessa, Delongpre, and Rizzo slowly move through the piles of

debris.

Still burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows.

They move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before.

CLOSE on the rubble.

There is an obvious hole dug out from the middle.

INT.  LAB ONE

Thorgan is fooling around in the back of Kay-Em 14's head. The nano-tech

maching is

doing a full diagnostics.

INT. WALKWAY ONE

Boeman enters, throws his pack to the ground and goes to work ttaching a

device to

the wall of the huge glass connector.

INT. WALKWAY TWO

Janessa enters and goes through the same motions.

INT. WALKWAY THREE

Delongpre and Rizzo attach a device to the wall.

SHe does so. Delongpre connects several wires. Rizzo looks nervous.

Delongpre notices.

Silence.

Delongpre looks at her like she's crazy.

fine,

balls

Silence. Neither speaks.

INT.  LAB ONE

Thorgan rips a metallic sink from the wall. It CRASHES to the floor.

INT.  WALKWAY ONE

Boeman attaches another charge. He's sweating. Nervous. Keeps looking

over his shoulder. Standing alone on this long walkway is a creepy

sight.

INT.  WALKWAY TWO

Janessa stops working, listens.

KA-THUMP -- There's anoise in the Cargo Bay.

She covers the mike on her headset and calls out.

No answer. She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of

tranquillizer

and a monster syring.e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive

dosage. Enough to

bring down a Rhino...or Jason maybe?

She starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay.

Surely she's not that stupid.

INT.  WALKWAY THREE

Rizzo is staring at Delongpre as he works on another device.

Then --

Delongpre stares at her. He doesn't want to speak and screw up this

rare moment of sharing.

INT.   CARGO BAY

Janessa enters. Looks around.

The cargo bay is dark and looming. Lights flicker. Emergency lights

strobe. It's hard to make anything out.

We hear Rizzo speaking Off Screen.

Janessa moves through the debris.

ANOTHER POV

We see Janessa come into view.

INT.  WALKWAY THREE

Thorgan interrupts over the headset.

Delongpre frowns.

INT. CARGO BAY

WATCHER'S POV

JANESSA approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried.

Janessa moves the debris around with her foot.

INT. WALKWAY THREE

Rizzo begins to tear up.

She stares at him.

She gives him a  half smile.

Another half smile. It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really

do?

INT. CARGO BAY

JASON'S POV

He watches Janessa from a  distance. Moving slowly and silently toward

her.

She stands and turns as --

SERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her!

She SCREAMS.

He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut.

KA-THUNK!

JASON"S MACHETE THRUSTS though Brodski's gut. Jason spins Brodski around

and tosses him to the floor!

Jason turns on Janessa.

She stands frozen in fear.

Jason raises his machete and --

JANESSA

Lights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino

syringe

into his chest! Jason stumbles...falls hard on his ass and sits there

staring

at her.

Jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside.

Jason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run.

He holds his hand out to her. Then--

KA-FOOM! The SHIP BUCKS!

Janessa runs, leaving the sergeant behind.

INT.  CARGO BAY - OUTSIDE WALKWAY THREE

Delongpre closes the door, then --

He throws a switch!

INT. CARGO BAY - BRIDGE SIDE

Boeman vaults over a pile of rubble.

INT. WALKWAY TWO

Holding hands, Delongpre and Rizzo enter. They stop...stand...stare.

The walkway is empty. Janessa is gone.

Boeman rushes up behind them.

With that Janessa tears into the walkway. She's out of breath. She can

barely speak.

THEIR POV

JASON moves through the debris. He's coming straight for them.

They race down the length of the walkway. Jason right behind them.

Boeman slams the door panel. The door slowly rises.

Jason approaches, stops, stares at his future victims. If he could smile

with anticipation...he would. He raises his Machete --

Then stops. Lowers it.

CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG.

He turns his back on our heroes. They crane their necks to see what has

pulled

his attention.

THORGAN marches down the walkway with KAY-EM 14. The new and imporved

KAY-EM 14.

Where her severed arm had once been, a chain gun is now attached. A

laser cannon is

mounted over her shoulder. Her body has been reinforced with steel from

around the lab.

Sinks, trays, you name it. She's the junk yard man's terminator. Then --

KAY-EM 14 INTERNAL SCAN POV

We see a somewhat computerized image of Jason through Kay-Em's personal

scan.

One the display we see:

SUBJECT: DEAD

CHANCES OF FUNCTION: 100 PERCENT

DOES NOT COMPUTE . . . DESTROY SUBJECT

BRAAAATTTT! The chain gun rings! Jason is SLAMMED into the HULL DOORS.

JASON jumps up and rushes at Kay-Em who catches him and tosses him down

the walkway --

BRAAAATTT! Kay-Em opens up again. Kay-Em's weaponry shoves Jason out

into the cargo

bay witha  blur of bullets.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay. Boeman and

Delongpre go to

work setting the charges.

INT. CARGO BAY

And with that, Kay-Em BLOWS the now standing Jason into another wall

with the laser

cannon.

INT. WALKWAY TWO

Delongpre pulls a trinket from his pack and pitches it to Boeman.

Thorgan is standing at the end of the walkway staring into the cargo

bay.

He looks sad.

INT.  CARGO BAY

Kay-Em 14 marches toward the downed Jason, and starts singing an old Sea

Shanty.

BRATTTT!!!

Kay-Em blows Jason into --

INT. HALL BETWEEN LABS AND CARGO

She kicks him down the long corridor.

INT. WALKWAY TWO

The hull SCREAMS from the exterior pressure. The ship RUMBLES.

INT.  LAB ONE

Jason BURSTS through the debris that had been blocking the Lab!

Kay-Em enters behind him.

JASON rushes KAY-EM 14!

KA-CHING!!!!

His machete bounces off of Kay-Em's new armor.

WHAM!

Kay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room. He crashes into the glass

speciments. Goo and formaldehyde covering him.

INT. WALKWAY TWO

Boeman and Delongpre are finishing up.

Janessa looks around, then --

INT.  LAB ONE

Kay-Em stands over Jason. And for the first time in ten films Jason is

in bad shape.

But still climbs to his feet...slowly.

Of course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother.

Jason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14! They roll into another glass case.

Glass, formaldehyde and specimens

rain down on top of them.

Having lost his machete, Jason BASHES at Kay-Em with his fists. OVER and

OVER. He

catches a rhythm. Kay-Em is trapped below.

INT. WALKWAY TWO

They look at one another -- hopless. Then --

Everyone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame.

He's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his

mid-section.

The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground.

INT. LAB ONE

WHAM...WHAM...WHAM... A RAIN of firststaking on this droid from the

future.

Finally, Jason stops. Straddling KAy-Em 14 he stares at his kill...until

--

Kay-Em 14 places the chaingun over Jason's chest.

BRAAAATTTT!!!!

Jason is blown across the room!

Chaingun and laser cannon UNLEASH A MASSIVE DISPLAY on the fleshly body

of

JASON VOORHEES.

The top portion of Jason's mask shatters!

hIS RIGHT LEG IS TURNED INTO A PILE OF MEAT, then blown clean off for

good measure!

Jason falls on his ass!

He raises his machete arm. A last ditch effort. Could he be that lucky?

To throw a machete and stop this onslaught?

CHA-CHING!

NOPE.

Jason climbs to his one good leg but i t only serves as a better aim

for Kay-Em 14.

KA-FOOM! The laser cannon blows Jason's left arm to hell.

KA-FOOM! KA-FOOM!

Two more blasts send Jason flying through the back wall and sliding

across the floor.

KAY-EM 14'S INTERNAL SCAN POV

This time, Jason's body doesn't move.

SUBJECT: DEAD

CHANCE OF FUNCTION: ZERO PERCENT

MISSION OF OBJECTIVES: COMPLERED

Kay-Em turns and races down the hall.

INT.  WALKWAY TWO

Boeman and Delongpre hustle to set the final charge.

CHA-CHUNG...CHA-CHUNG. Kay-Em steps into the walkway. She's covered in

blood.

Suddenly the ship's hull SCREAMS. The ship BUCKS. Everyone tumbles.

INT.  LAB ONE

Jason's body is propped up against a machine in the same position we saw

it before. This

mass of torn flesh doesn't move.

The ship BUCKS again.

The machine HUMS to life. BUZZING and BEEPING. Suddenly a laser scans

Jason's

body.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Jason is leaned up against the Nano-Tech machine.

INT. WALKWAY TWO

Thorgan runs wire to each device.

INT. LABE ONE - NANO-TECH MACHINE

We see a schematic of Jason's battered body on the monitor. Nano-

technology

is already at work.

Hoses and wires now encircle Jason's body. We follow one of the hoses

until it ends

over --

A WASTE BEND

nside we see pile of bullets. Stuff falls from the hose. Bullets from

the chaingun,

bullets from  every previous Jason movie. A broken machete blade drops

to the pile.

The tip of an arrow. A couple of knives. A pair of pliers. An ink pen.

The skeleton

of a fish.

The scanning lasers move to the stump at Jason's shoulder. We see the

image as a new arm, fuzzy

adn distorted, is being constructed.

On the schematic, we see Jason's internal organs being repaired.

By now  we've figured out ...nothing good can come of this.

INT.  WALKWAY TWO

Kay-Em 14 hits a button. The door begins to slide down slowly.

Delongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway, welder in his hand.

ON OUR HEROES

Suddenly there is a GRINDING SOUND. Engines WHINE from behind them.

The group stops and turns.

The cargo door is starting to smoke. It SQUEALS as it slowly opens.

The door opens and Jason steps into the walkway.

But he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now

SHINY METAL. His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered. His mask is

CHROME.

We can't see them, but we know...his insides are in better shape than

ever.

BRAAAATTTTT!

Kay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as

bullets vounce off of his metal limbs.

Jason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor,

removing a hunk of metal.

Jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS.

One of the wires, connecting two charges severs.

Kay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved

backwards.

Boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues.

IT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic

killer.

SPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but

Jason uses

his machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee.

She stumbles...falls to the ground.

Boeman splices the wires together.

Then turns to see Jason approaching.

But Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman.

ON KAY-EM

As her body separates from her legs mid-thigh. CHCHHHHH!

THRUSTERS IGNITE from her lower thighs.

As Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in --

KA-FWAM! Kay-Em slams into him! Knocking Boeman free.

Jason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again.

CHANG! CLANG! CLUNK! Metal against metal. Kay-Em hovers up the walls,

over Jason's

head...but Jason has come into his own with these new body parts. She's

no match. Finally --

JASON EMBEDS HIS MACHETE IN KAY-EM'S THROAT

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate! his

fist from Kay-Em's

chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat.

Thorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him

down

the hall.

Jason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck. Severing her

head

from her body. It flies down the hallway behind the kids.

JASON

Turns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end.

DELONGPRE

Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees

JASON.

OUR HEROES

Run toward the door. But, Thorgan stops.

Thorgan turns, runs back toward Jason.

Thorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head. It lies between he and

Jason.

He'll never make it!  Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the

head.

BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

Jason raises his machete from his belt and --

JASON TURNS AS --

KA-CHUNG!!!! Rizzo nails him with a metal ar.

Jason stumbles backwards then whirls on Rizzo.

He sure does.

She turnsa dn runs.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As the others race into the engien room they turn to watch.

Rizzo catches up to Thorgan but they have a long way to go

and Jason is gaining.

JANESSA leaps forward and hits the switch. The door begins sliding

slowly shut.

Boeman hits the button again.

ANOTHER ANGLE

JASON

TWENTY PACES BEHIND

INT.  ENGINE ROOM

Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door.

Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force. He

stops with the door

coming down on his lower back.

Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through.

The door closes!

Boeman turns the switch.

INT.  MIDSHIP WALK WAY

The charges BLOW! A FIREBALL rushes toward the running JASON!

INT.  ENGINE ROOM

CLOSE ON DOOR

AS KA-FWAM!!!

JASON'S BODY IMPRINTS IN THE NOW SEALED DOOR.

EXT. GRENDEL

The walkway explodes, severing Grendel into two separate hulls.

The left damaged hull, sinks out of view as the engine side begins

to pull away. Then --

KA-FOOM!!

Grendel's LEFT HULL finallay EXPLODES!! They barely amde it.

INT.  ENGINE ROOM

The right hull BUCKS from the force of the blast. Our heroes are

aireborne for a moment

then crash to the floor.

Boeman climbs to a console.

CHEERS

Thorgan looks into Kay-Em 14's severed head.

Boeman CLICKS on a console keyboard.

CHEERS!

More CHEERS.

Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her.

There's that moment when we think the two might kiss. She takes a step

toward him. Yes, they are going to kiss --

BOOM!

WARNING LIGHTS. WARNING ALARMS. The sound of SUCKING WIND. AS JASON,

still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his

metal hand!

As he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to

hold

on to anything.

The Hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space.

Boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door.

He pulls Sergeant Brodski through the door as --

JASON

Fights his way through the opening in the hull.

The engines BUCK and begin to SMOKE.

Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety.

Janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh.

SERGEANT BRODKSI

Lying in the door's threshold reaches out and snags her hand.

But Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks. She's pulled from the

Sergeant's

grasp.

She flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches. He lets go.

She flies toward the hole, slams into it.

Everything goes quiet for a moment. As he body has sealed the hole then

--

SHHHHHHHHOOOOOK!

She's sucked into space in a most grotesque manner.

ANOTHER ANGLE

INT. REACTOR CORE

Hug cylindrical machines run the length of this enormous room.

They HUM quietly as our group enters.

Everyone stares at Boeman. He's standing at another console.

Thorgan still clutches Kay-Em 14's severed head.

Brodski, still bleeding, pale, struggling to stand --

The kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare.

KA-FWAM! Everyone jumps but this time it's only Rizzo. She broke a metal

stand and has

yanked one of the legs free.

INT. ENGINE ROOM

JASON is pounding on the reactor room door. A difficult act with the

continued pressure

trying to suck him into space.

THEN

Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him.

Jason whirls around and lurches toward her clinging to machinery as he

goes.

INT.  ENGINE ROOM CORRIDOR

Rizzo backs slowly as Jason closes in.

As he reaches the corridor, she turns and runs.

RIZZO

Jason barrels toward her.

She stops at a door, but doesn't attmept ot open it.

Jason comes closer..and closeer...but Rizzo doesn't move --

Jason moves in for the kill, raises his machete, and --

SLASH!

RIZZO'S CHEST IS SPLIT OPEN!

SLASH! Her arm falls to the ground!

Jason shoves his fist, through her chest and into the wall.

INT.  ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The real RIZZO rips off her virtual reality helmet.

Delongpre is punching numbers into the keypad. Both are wearing

headsets.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Jason returns to the engine room, none too pleased at being tricked.

Rizzo jersk Delonpre and both spill into the reactor

corridor. Rizzo slaps the panel. the door closes!

Shutting out Jason's image.

WHAM!

THE ENGINE ROOM door RIPS in half. JASON CLIMBS through.

RIZZO AND DELONGPRE RUN!

They race down the long corridor toward the reactor room.

JASON IN PURSUIT.

INT. DOCKING BAY

Thorgan is typing like mad at small portable keyboard.

Boeman stares out the docking bay window.

HIS POV

There's damage, lots of it.

INT. REACTOR ROOM corridor.

They leap through a door, closing it behind them, then keep running.

BEHIND THEM

KA-FWAM! Jason barrels right through the door.

INT.  REACTOR CORE

Rizzo and Delongpre enter in a  mad rush. Delongpre closes the door.

Little good it'll do.

INT. REACTOR ROOM CORRIDOR

JASON kicks the door with his metallic leg!

KA-FWAM! The door shatters and he stumlbes into --

EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

Forest, cabins, the lake. Everything as we and Jason remember.

But somehow distroted. A strange hue covers everything.

No, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are

strange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something

foreign.

The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a

camp.

But the image will do.

INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

Thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away. Boeman is wearing a space

suit.

He's helping sergeatn Brodski into his.

At the other end of the huge room, Jason wanders ... with confusion.

Rizzo glances out the docking bay window.

THROUGH WINDSHIELD

We see a planet much the same color as Earth, but the continents are

wrong.

Delongpre leads Rizzo to a suit.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Kay-Em 14's head sits on the floor in the center of room.

DOCKING BAY

The others stare at Thorgan...he looks embarrassed to say the least.

ON KAY-EM

She smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jason slowly walks beside Kay-Em 14.

EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

Jason is walking along the lake when he sees --

A CAMPFIRE off in the distance. LAUGHTER, SINGING.

CAMPERS!!!

He takes off toward the campfire, then hears --

SPLASHING.

He turns.

HIS POV

Within the distorted lake, someone is drowning. Could it be a little

boy?

A little Jason from many years ago?

JASON

Moves toward the beach. Steps partly into the water.

HIS POV

THE WOMAN, THE VOICE. IT'S JASON'S MOTHER!

He turns toward the campfire, back to his mother...what to do?! Then --

JASON TEARS INTO THE WATER, TRYING TO REACH HER.

Jason moves closer.

As he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him.

JASON

Pauses staring at the please for help.

He stares into her pleading face. HIS MOTHER! After all these years!

He places his hand over her face, gently, then --

PUSHES HER UNDER!

He holds her there.

INT. REACTOR ROOM

EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

Camp Cyrstal lake begins to jerk and fade.

INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

Everyone is suited up. Delongpre, the last, is adjusting his helmet.

Thorgan grabs the portable keyboard and starts typing away!

EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

Suddenly the image solidifies then a number of the aliens from the game

grid appear. But Jason's seen these guys before. He tears through them.

INT. REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

Boeman hits the door panel to the docking bay. It begins to slowly rise.

EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

Jason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange Conan in space.

The image flickers...he  catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo

the

room. He starts toward them.

Then a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him.

SWISH! The bunny's head is severed. The image distortss. Again we see

our

heroes. Jason is closer.

INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

The door is halway open. Our heroes start ducking under.

Jason is almost on them.

He's clicking away like a mad man.

EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

A ROCK BAND appears playing some futuristic metal. Then CHEERLEADERS in

scantily clad outfits. Then a MIDGIT in a cowboy hat riding by on a

tricycle. We have now entered Thorgan's twisted streams of conciousness.

Jason tears through the aboe. His goal now clear. The distractions no

longer fool him.

A volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around.

A fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo. A huge turtle.

A couple of goats.

Nothing is stopping Jason.

INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

Boeman reaches out and jerks Thorgan into the inner air lock.

EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

The image finally disintergrates.

Jason finds himself staring at our heroes. He lunges for the air lock,

but --

Sergeant Brodski dives, hitting Jason in the chest and knocking him to

the

floor.

SERGEANT BRODSKI, still in Jason's clutches, kicks at the door panel.

The door starts to close as Jason begins hacking with his machete.

Jason hacks and hack, stabbing through the space suit, until finally,

the tough

old leather neck is silent for good.

INT.  AIR LOCK

The door is sealed.

Boemen hits another button, and the outer door begins to open.

EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF THE GRENDEL

AS THE OUTER DOOR OPENS, RIZZO UNCOMFORTABLY FIDGETS WITH HER SUIT.

He points to where her hand hovers over some buttons on her sleeve.

WHAM!

Jason starts pounding from the other side.

Delongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some

walkway door reinforced by a high school kid. This is an air lock

door. Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors.

CHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH.

Our group enters deep space.

EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF GRENDEL

Rizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive

right hull. They thrust slowly into space.

INT. DOCKING BAY

Jason finally gives up with the massive pounding. He steps back.

Turns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at --

THE DOOR PANEL

He preses the button

the ari lock door begins to open. Air is suddenly sucked out of the

room!

Sergeant Brodski's body flies out into space. Everything not tied down

races out

along with him.

ON KAY-EM 14'S HEAD

AS it skitters across the floor --

-- and right out the air lock

JASON

holds onto a machine until the door is open, then lets go!

He shoots out into space.

EXT. GRENDEL

Jason flies out of the air lock.

HIS POV

He's rocketing right toward one of the space suits!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Suddenly Rizzo is SLAMMED from behind. She and Jason go spinning away

from

the others.

RIZZO

grapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG.

Jason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back.

He's

going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her

head,

when --

WHAM!

Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms

sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling.

Delongpre clings to Jason's back.

Jason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until

he's holding Delongpre

around the thoat. He'll pop his helmet like a cork!

ANOTHER ANGLE

AS Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass...

BACK TO JASON

AS he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck. He can't fight back.

RIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear

Delongpre CHOKING over the radio.

The three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II.

Then, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button

on her sleeve.

KA-CHSSHSH!!!

HER AIR TANK BLOWS!

JASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM!

But he's still tangled in Rizzo's hoses. And now she has no air.

Jason turns...grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself

toward Rizzo and Delongpre.

He has them...when --

WHAM!

BRODSKI

Still barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back.

He turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses.

Jason and Brodski tumble towards EARTH II.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rizzo's turning blue. She's about to pass out, when --

Delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank.

CHSHSHSH...

AIR BEGINS TO FLOW.

Rizzo takes a big GASP...coughs.

Suddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them.  The four survivors huddle

together.

They turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by. Thorgan graps at her

and pulls

her head into his arms.

THE GROUP CHEERS.

Those two aren't the only two.

CLOSE ON RIZZO AND DELONGPRE

Their glass face masks are touching. They stare into each other's

eyes.

They laugh and turn to stare toward EARTH II.

EXT.  EARTH II -- ORBIT

Suddenly Jason's body comes into view. It's racing toward Earth II.

Brodski riding it like Slim Pickens.

Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere.

Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good

man...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.

Spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his

descent.

His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up.

It begins to glow. His metallic arm and leg glow.

Flames build as he rockets towards Earth II.

Flesh BUBBLES and OOZES.

His legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his

body!

EXT.  CAMP SIGHT

Four kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion

campfire.

They look up and see a blaze shooting towards Earth II.

It LIGHTS up the night, then --

EXPLODES IN A BRILLIANT FIREWORKS DISPLAY!

From the explosion, one small smoldering chunk falls toward Earth II.

EXT.  CRYSTAL RESERVOIR

OUR POV

As the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing chrome

hockey mask!

IT HITS THE WATER with a SSSSS!!!!

BACK TO KIDS

The others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward what

could be a wonderful new discovery.

A STREAM.

The hockey mask washes down the stream, comes to a halt at a pair of

grusomely charred hands.

THE FINGERS,

TWITCH, curl around the mask, lifting it off camera. AND WE --

FADE OUT, a familiar KI-KI-KI-KI-HA-HA-HA-HA, resonating as we --

ROLL CREDITS

THE END
