FADE IN:

INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT

TITLES OVER:

A padded wall is papered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that date back to

the early 1900s:

"LOCAL FOWLER BROTHERS LOSE $35 TICKETS TO BOARD TITANIC" appears

over "FOWLER BROTHERS KILLED IN COAL MINE MISHAP." Another series of

articles reads, "JEWISH PROFESSOR DENIED ADMITTANCE TO HINDENBURG"

and "PROFESSOR RABINOWITZ KILLED IN AVALANCHE." Etc...

Continuing along the wall, the newspaper articles all focus on the

fates of the original SURVIVORS of the FLIGHT 180 CRASH.

We DISSOLVE between the various headlines depicting the gruesome

deaths of Tod, Terry, Ms. Lewton, Billy Hitchcock, Carter and Alex

Browning.

Also in the mix are various CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of the deaths.

Decapitated torsos, crushed, mangled bodies, the charred remains of

another and the face- down body of Alex Browning.

MAPS line the walls as well, pinpointing the locations of numerous

deaths, perhaps seeking a pattern. Charts that timeline bizarre

deaths, seating charts of downed aircraft, etc...

LATEX -GLOVED HANDS tear out the last article, apply fun- tack to its

corners and place it in the center of all the others:

A REMEMBRANCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF FLIGHT 180

Friday marks one year anniversary.

END TITLES.

FLASH TO BLACK as a HAND ENTERS FRAME, PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

EXT. KIMBERLY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

KIMBERLY BURROUGHS, 19, puts a folded AAA map in her mouth. She opens

the back of a RED NISSAN SUV, and pla ces her duffel bag inside.

That done, she lets the map drop from her mouth, catches it in her

free hand and turns to hug her father, MR. BURROUGHS.

Kimberly and Mr. Burroughs turn to see --

SHAINA, 19, tall leggy brunette. Tan, tight tube top revealing her

pierced navel, Kimberly's best friend. She walks up the driveway with

her bags.

Shaina throws her bags in, shuts the back and climbs in the SUV.

Kimberly hugs her dad, kissing him on the cheek.

Kimberly hugs him tighter. Cutting him off.

Kimberly gives him a quick kiss, jumps behind the wheel, starts the

car and pulls away as Shaina cranks up the stereo.

Mr. Burroughs waves as the girls roar off. As he looks down he spots

an OIL STAIN left by Kimberly's SUV. As he drags his shoe across the

stain, a SLIGHT BREEZE blows past his face.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as a look of concern crosses his face.

EXT. HIGHWAY ON RAMP - DAY

ON OLD WOMAN

As she pushes her supermarket cart up the on ramp. A SQUEAKY WHEEL is

shrill and disturbing.

DRIVERS of several waiting vehicles avoid staring at her weathered

face as she passes. Up ahead waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.

UP AHEAD

Waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.

Kimberly accidentally KISSES the bumper in front of her while

daydreaming. She calls out to the driver in front:

Shaina looks over, concerned. In the backseat, the guys DANO and

FRANKIE laugh hard and some of Frankie's milkshake comes out of his

nose.

Shaina looks at Kimberly as a HAND suddenly hits Kimberly's window.

Kimberly spins around, startled.

Kimberly stares transfixed at the Old Woman, who stares back with

chilling intensity.

The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking freak." The Old Woman's

PLASTIC BAG BREAKS, sending oranges rolling down the on- ramp. The Old

Woman breaks eye contact with Kimberly as she rushes to retrieve

them.

The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.

Kimberly pulls the SU V onto the highway, looking in the side view

mirror to see the Old Woman look up at her in SLOW-MO.

CU ON KIMBERLY

As she looks back from the mirror and reacts to an ominous electronic

road sign that flashes "WARNING: CONSTRUCTION NEXT 180 FEET".

NISSAN SUV

Kimberly merging into traffic, NEARLY COLLIDES with a speeding yellow

mini- bus carrying a high- school football team.

Kimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right, then realizing she's

speeding towards the road construction barrels, she swerves back

left, right behind the mini-bus at the last moment.

CLOSE.

Kimberly pulls around the mini-bus as rowdy football players tackle

each other, yelling:

Kimberly flicks on the radio and we hear HIGHWAY TO HELL by AC/DC at

earsplitting volume. Kimberly and Shaina jump from the shock and

reach to lower the volume.

Kimberly, disturbed by this, hits SEEK -- an oldies station. A GRISLY

CAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.

Kimberly passes a car WEAVING on her right. The driver reaching into

the back seat to quiet a BARKING DOG hanging on its head out the

window.

A CLOUD passes Kimberly's head. She smells it and turns around,

taking her eyes off the road to see Dano smoking a joint.

Dano and Frankie exchange looks, God, what a geek!

Kimberly turns to Shaina, helpless. Shaina spins around, her eyes

wordlessly tell Dano, I know she's a priss, but put it out.

Then Kimberly's CELL PHONE RINGS. She hits the speaker button.

Dano defiantly blows more smoke toward Kimberly, then breaks into an

unexpected coughing fit - looking over to see a HELLS ANGEL laughing

at hi m. The biker's trashy GIRLFRIEND, also laughing, quickly FLASHES

HER TITS at Dano over:

Kimberly passes a STATION WAGON on her right, the DRIVER squinting at

a map while driving. A mattress and some furniture tied to the top

SHIFT as the wagon hits a bump.

Before Kimberly can answer, Dano sees a CHP speeding up behind him.

He lowers the joint at once.

Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding

flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !

A HORN BLASTS. The truck swerves. Then speeds by on the right. A

COILED CHAIN drops down to the highway.

Shaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly.

ON LOG TRUCK

One end of the RUSTY CHAIN holding the logs in place rattles on the

pavement, sparking.

Looking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the COP pulls

in behind her.

Dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window. It

bounces on the windshield of a FORD EXPEDITION to their left.

INSIDE THE EXPEDITION

KAT, 28, very corporate America, wears a navy blue power suit and

speaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette.

Kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her

windshield wipers. A moment later, a small FLAME crackles.

Kat flicks on her WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID, successfully putting out

the joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing

her vision.

Kat turns and looks at --

DANO, dead serious all of a sudden. Staring straight ahead.

Kat sees the tailgating CHP, smiles, then resumes her conversation.

Kat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a

number...

PAN OFF KAT TO OFFICER THOMAS BURKE

Early 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange.

INSIDE THE POLICE CAR

Thomas speaks into his radio.

Thomas tries to sip from a McDonald's coffee cup on the dashboard,

but it's TOO HOT. He places it back on the dash.

The VIBRATIONS of the road make the COFFEE CUP slide closer and

closer to the edge of the dashboard.

BACK TO KIMBERLY'S SUV

Dano nervously looks back.

But Kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard "Check Engine" light

begins flickering.

Kimberly spots a road sign -- Next Service 18 Miles.

Kimberly stops mid-sentence when the WHITE VAN in front of her

suddenly SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES and pulls onto the shoulder for no

reason. Kimberly SCREAMS, swerving around the van just in time to

avoid an accident. Frankie instinctively SHOUTS at the van.

INSIDE THE WHITE VAN

ISABELLA CRUZ, late 20's and VERY PREGNANT, drives a delivery van

full of funeral wreaths, crosses and classic rose urns. Most are

marked: In Memory of Flight 180.

She chokes back sobs into a cell phone as she pulls over.

She pounds the steering wheel, furious.

A CRATE in the back of her van topples over and CRASHES and a flurry

of sunflower petals sails out the window. Isabella jumps in surprise

and, wiping tears from her eyes, rolls up the windows as petals

shower the visor of --

EUGENE, the Harley Rider, who smears the petals (and some squashed

bugs) around his visor and drops back.

INSIDE NISSAN SUV

Kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees

a TRUCK DRIVER guzzling from a flask as it passes the SUV, revealing

its side is an ad for FIRESTONE TIRES.

It finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads,

"DRUNK DRIVING KILLS."

Kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter

from the back seat.

Up ahead, the RUSTY CHAIN seems to have more give to it. LOGS STRAIN

against it.

Suddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 Chevette in front

of them causes everyone to roll up their windows.

OIL DRIPS from its rusty exhaust pipe. The thick exhaust BLINDS

Kimberly.

Kimberly tires to enter the passing lane, but she's blocked by a

SUBURU WAGON. In the front seat, a seven- year old kid is sadistically

SMASHING two toy cars together.

Kimberly passes the Suburu and pulls up to a PACER. The Harley roars

by, startling her.

INSIDE PACER

NORA KESNER, 35, and her son TIM, 15. Tim drums on the dashboard with

two ten-ounce Naya bottles.

Tim frowns and then winces, holding his jaw.

Tim drops the Naya bottles on the seat. One of them quietly falls to

the floor, rolls a bit, finally settling UNDER THE BRAKE PEDAL.

INSIDE NISSAN SUV

Kimberly is still behind the smoke-spewing Chevette. She passes it on

the left. Frankie rolls down his window.

INSIDE CHEVETTE

RORY, 27, leans down to snort a line of coke off a Def Leppard CD

case. S he looks up to see the Patrol Car is now behind him, he

reflexively taps the brakes.

Rory, eyes like saucers, sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and

nonchalantly wipes the CD clean on his pants.

INSIDE NISSAN SUV

She has dropped back behind the Chevette and CHP car and is running

down along side of a BLACK TRANS AM.

Up ahead she sees the Hig hway Patrol Car flick on its LIGHTS and pull

into the shoulder around the Chevette and behind the Semi loaded with

logs.

INSIDE THE COP CAR

As Thomas pulls in behind the log truck, his coffee cup lurches

forward, spilling hot coffee all over his lap and the floor.

INSIDE TRANS AM

Its driver, EVAN SCHAEFFER, 21, flashes a cocky smile at Kimberly,

clearly making Frankie jealous.

Frankie leans out and tosses milkshake on Evan's window.

Evan, pissed off, flips off Frankie. The windshield wipers smear

around the thick milky fluid. The sun blinding him.

Kimberly laughs, then leans in close to Shaina.

Shaina smiles in understanding.

INSIDE POLICE CRUISER

Thomas bends to wipe up the mess. He only glances at the road as he

tries to soak up the coffee.

Suddenly up ahead, THE RUSTY CHAIN SNAPS! The logs roll off the side

of the truck onto the highway.

One bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and

out the back, taking Thomas' head with it.

EUGENE slams on his brakes. His Harley slides out and he is SLAMMED

to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right

in front of the yellow mini-bus.

The MINI- BUS DRIVER brakes to avoid Eugene. The FOOTBALL PLAYERS

tumble forward and hit him in the head. He loses control and slides

off the road onto the grass median.

He blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, ROLLING

several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is HIT by a

MACK TRUCK.

Eugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch.

Only to be HIT and CRUSHED by his sliding motorcycle.

Rory looks up too late and REAR ENDS Thomas' car, EXPLODING the gas

tank and HURLING Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield

where it remains half in/half onto the hood.

KAT, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but SKIDS on oil from

the Chevette.

She swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a

huge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the

Expedition end over end right next to Kimberly.

Kimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a

huge log ahead. She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but

hits it broadside --

Sending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the

road. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag

dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the

side window.

Kimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side. She looks back to her

mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see

NORA'S PACER

Nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen

Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of

Kat's Expedition.

The crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a

huge fireball.

EVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his

Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass.

Kimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF

FIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still

alive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to

release the seatbelt.

Then, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh

the wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it

like a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming.

KIMBERLY'S POV

The semi's grill comes right at her!

CU ON KIMBERLY

She screams and we --

CUT TO:

THE HIGHWAY O N RAMP - NISSAN SUV - 8 MINUTES EARLIER

Sweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her

surroundings...

The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.

The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking Freak!"

Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin.

Kimberly's eyes lower to the bag of oranges --

Which BREAKS, exactly like before, and the Old Woman scurries after

them. The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.

Kimberly hyperventilates in the driver's seat. Freaking. A yellow

mini- bus with football players speeds past.

Dano, confused, rolls a joint.

Dano hums the Twilight Zone theme.

CLOSE UP - KIMBERLY SCREAMS!

AND WE'RE BACK

THE HIGHWAY ON RAMP

Sweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her

surroundings.

The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.

The kids ad-lib "Let's go", "Fucking freak."

Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin.

Kimberly's eyes lower to the bag of oranges, which breaks, exactly

like before and the Old Woman scurries after them.

The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.

Kimberly hyperventilates in the driver's seat. Freaking. A yellow

mini- bus with football players speeds by.

Dano, confused, rolls a joint.

Dano hums the Twilight Zone theme.

HONK! The drivers behind them start leaning on their horns. Kimberly

leans out the window and sees the Chevette, the Pacer, The White Van,

the Trans Am, the Harley...all the familiar vehicles from the pile

up. She turns on the radio, frantically scans the dial.

The opening guitar riff to HIGHWAY TO HELL blares from the speakers.

Kimberly turns to Shaina with a "believe me know?" look, but Shaina's

nowhere near on the same page.

HONKING behind them.

Kimberly, shaking like a leaf, pulls the SUV forwards, turning it

sideways to block off all traffic.

Dano shifts in his seat and sees - a Highway Pat rol Car ominously

cruising up the shoulder of the onramp. He shoves a bag of weed,

along with the joint, down his pants.

Officer Thomas Burke stops the car behind them.

The cop turns on his FLASHERS.

Officer Thomas Burke exits his car and approaches the passenger side

of the SUV, hand on weapon. Thomas taps the window with his knuckle.

Thomas looks to the guys in back who shrug, "we don't know her."

As she does, Thomas discretely unsnaps his holster. RORY nervously

eyes the action. Sneaks a paper bundle into his sock. ISABELLA, the

pregnant woman in the White Van, gets out. She gives Thomas her

friendliest smile, milking the pregnant belly.

Her CELL PHONE RINGS and she leans back inside to answer it.

As she listens, growing agitated, the Harley Rider dismounts and

pulls off his helmet. Revealing EUGENE DIX, 35, a nebbishy school

teacher in cool leathers.

INSIDE PACER

NORA watches the SUV, distressed.

Nora gives Tim a hard stare, then they both break into smiles. Nora

tousles his hair. And doesn't stop.

As he laughs, something pains his jaw and he winces. THOMAS isn't

quite sure what kind of insanity he's dealing with yet. Dano and

Frankie, no help, stare dead ahead.

Kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the LOG TRUCK speed past.

She grabs at Thomas for emphasis.

EVAN impatiently yells out the window of his TRANS AM.

Kimberly looks to Shaina for support, but even Shaina can't meet her

eyes.

Thomas, subtly reaching for his cuffs.

A SERIES OF CRASHES AND EXPLOSIONS ARE HEARD. In the distance. It's

neverending. Horrific. Kimberly's face crumbles. She screams in

horror and collapses against the SUV.

Thomas runs to his patrol car.

The White Delivery Van makes a J- turn out of the line of cars and

SPEEDS down the onramp in reverse, Isabella screaming angrily into

her cell phone.

The other drivers exit their cars, craning their necks to see what's

happened up ahead. Kat takes a deep drag off her smoke.

Thomas barks into the radio handset --

INSIDE THE SUV

Frankie watches the traffic start to back up as a couple of passing

cars BRAKE HARD. Shaina anxiously watches Kimberly pacing behind the

SUV.

Kimberly moves toward Shaina's window. As she leans her head into

Shaina's window, an ominous BREEZE blows back their hair and we hear

the BLARING HORN of a TRUCK.

And Kimberly is unexpectedly yanked backward by Thomas!

From nowhere, a SHRIEK of BRAKES as a JACK-KNIFED TRUCK plow s the SUV

across the frame! CRASH! Flying debris misses Kimberly and Thomas by

inches!

Kimberly cries in horror into Thomas' shoulder as her friends burn up

in the wreckage.

EXT. POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING SHOT

INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

CHAOS. Evan, the driver of the Trans Am, impatiently speaks to

DETECTIVE SUBY, late 40s, professional with an open face that makes

him a great listener.

Officer Thomas Burke passes by, heading into --

INT. A ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kat, Eugene, Nora, Tim, and Rory sit in a large room, waiting to give

statements. Unlike Evan, these witnesses are clearly distraught.

PAN OVER TO REVEAL KIMBERLY. She's still in shock, her mind far away.

Thomas sits close to her, speaking softly.

Something clicks for Thomas, but he forces himself to speak calmly,

like a lawyer leading a friendly witness.

The other drivers stare at Kimberly.

But the others listen intently now. Especially Kat, who spies her

headset buried deep in her purse.

Kimberly sighs and looks down. The room becomes eerily silent, except

for the FLICKER of a florescent light.

Thomas' eyes widen -- then a startling CRASH as Rory, le aning back in

his chair, tips over. Thomas rolls his eyes as Rory grins sheepishly

and picks himself up.

Eugene sees Nora and Tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire

tones.

Everyone tenses up.

Kimberly, affected, looks to Thomas for confirmation.

BANG! Everyone jumps as Detective Suby pounds on the door and opens

it.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The DOOR OPENS. Detective Suby enters, leading Thomas. Through a two -

way mirror, they can see the others chatting anxiously.

Detective Suby's persistent glare makes Thomas uncomfortable.

But Thomas isn't listening. He's glued to Kimberly's words. When

Detective Suby realizes this, he stops and listens.

Detective Suby looks pissed o ff.

At the same time, we watch Evan enter the other room, grab his jacket

and wave goodbye to the others.

INT. A ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Kat, Eugene and Rory now seem affected by what

they've heard.

The fluorescent light above FLICKERS ominously. Nora, disturbed,

stands up in a huff, grabbing Tim's arm.

Eugene and Rory burst out laughin g. Nora shakes her head, disgusted.

Nora pulls a reluctant Tim out of the room. As she opens the door,

the others watch Detective Suby and Thomas appear from nowhere to

calm her down . When the door swings shut, an awkward silence.

Suddenly, the door opens again and Thomas leads Mr. Burroughs inside.

Mr. Burroughs sees Kimberly and chokes back tears.

The sight of her fath er crying is enough to make Kimberly's own dam

burst. She rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest,

sobbing.

Thomas nods.

By now, the fluorescent light flickers out of control. When Rory, Kat

and Eugene stand up, Thomas looks helpless.

As Thomas watches them file out, the fluorescent light POPS. Then

DARKNESS.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Kimberly sits at the table. Mr. Burroughs sets down a cup of tea

before her. Both are shaken.

She picks up the tea, it clatters in her trembling hands.

INT. EVAN'S STAIRWELL - DAY

A dingy singly light bulb illuminates the narrow stairwell. Evan

appears in the darkness, carrying a brand new television with some

packages on top. He's unable to s ee the long rickety stairwell he

climbs.

The stairs are littered with Chinese take out MENUS and a TONKA TRUCK

apparently left by some kids.

As Evan slowly climbs the staircase, a FAT MAN comes down, forcing

Evan to lean against -

THE RAILING - which CREAKS and BENDS. After the FAT MAN passes, Evan

slowly continues up again, TEARING HIS SHIRT on a nail.

A HEATING DUCT CLICKS ON. The air blows a TONKA TRUCK slowly toward

the center of the staircase, directly in Evan's path - but Evan just

misses it!

He continues past MORE TOYS, nearing the top stair -

The Airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward Evan's feet and

he slips on them! He juggles the TV - but ultimately rights himself

and continues down the hallway.

INT. EVAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Dim, cheap, probably roach-infested. As Evan enters, the small

packages fall off the TV box and onto the floor.

Evan places the TV by the door, looks at his torn shirt, but fuck it,

who cares; he's on a natural high. He peels his shirt off, revealing

his PIERCED NIPPLES, flicks on the radio and DANCES his way over to

the fridge and grabs a drink.

In the tiny kitchenette area, a small swarm of flies hovers over a

grease-filled frying pan.

Evan recoils, throws open the window and throws the grease to the

sidewalk five stories below. An ominous BREEZE enters --

And a kitchen cabinet slowly BLOWS OPEN. Some FORKS and KNIVES slide

forward on poorly stacked plates. Daring to fall into the toaster.

Evan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the

frying pan, then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks. Evan puts

the frying pan on the stove and turns it on HIGH.

He then grabs a container of CHINESE FOOD and rests it on the counter

next to the fridge. On the fridge, several colorful MAGNETS spell out

HEY E.

PUSH IN on the H - which mysteriously drops into the Chinese food -

the word EY E remaining. Oblivious, Evan puts the food in the

microwave and turns it on.

ANGLE ON STOVE

The cooki ng oil creeps toward the range... Evan hits PLAY on his

answering machine and rushes across the room to tear open his

packages...

A CLICK, then hold MUZAK: AC/DC's HIGHWAY TO HELL.

ANGLE ON MAGNET in Chinese fo od. SPARKING. It pops and fizzles. And

ugly sound.

As many similar messages continue, Evan unwraps a new ROLEX! He

slides it over his wrist, admiring it.

ANGLE ON KNIFE

Lazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster, protruding about

an inch and a half. Hardly noticeable.

By now, Evan has opened the next package; a gaudy gold and diamond

encrusted horseshoe ring.

He carries the ring into the kitchenette, sees the Chinese food is

FLAMING, and his hands flash out to turn it off -- A SMALL EXPLOSION

from the microwave startles him.

The RING falls into his drain/garbage disposal!

Evan reaches INTO THE DRAIN, his fingers searching for the ring. When

he tries to pull his hand back out, the ROLEX CATCHES.

Another small EXPLOSION from the microwave, this one cracking the

GLASS. A Solo Plastic Cup nearby begins to melt.

Flames sputter around the rim of the frying pan. In moments, the oil

from the pan IGNITES. A small fire.

Evan sees all this and YANKS with all his might. No use. As the FIRE

slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic. He

continues yanking... Stuck.

He sees a bottle of PALMOLIVE on the other end of the counter. His

fingers reach for it.

Slightly out of his grasp. But his fingertips are just long enough to

knock the bottle backwards - where it rests against TWO SWITCHES.

The FIRE ALARM goes off. The PHONE RINGS.

Evan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to edge the

Palmolive over. By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it

threatens to turn on one of the switches.

ANGLE ON FINGERS

In the GARBAGE DISPOSAL. A SWITCH is flipped - but the light goes on.

And the Palmolive lazily falls, resting on the remaining switch.

Evan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the

SWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL!

Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against

the knife in the toaster.

When the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out,

knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor.

The entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the

door. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke.

Evan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He

begins COUGHING in the smoke.

Evan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the

kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire

escape.

He dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears

a creak and looks up just as --

A large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan

jumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire

completely engulfs the kitchen.

He bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape.

He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor.

A LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick

shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest

level, intact.

He tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges

once, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing

and gently drops to the ground.

Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk --

SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his

legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.

The rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming

right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway!

As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly

PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!

INT. POLICE STATION - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

Thomas sits at the computer terminal. He checks to make sure no one's

watching as he enters a SEARCH for Alex Browning.

Ten websites come up, all devoted to the Flight 180 Curse. Thomas

scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of Flight 180

"survivors".

Headlines blare, "Freak Accident?" "Bizarre Coincidence?" describing

the way the victims died. As Thomas begins a localized search of the

word, "PREMONITION" --

SPOOKY HUMMING from behind him.

Thomas whirls around to see Det. Suby looking over his shoulder,

humming the music from an old monster movie. Suby presses one hand to

his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest.

Suby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more. Thomas,

embarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands.

Detective Suby shrugs and walks away, munching the apple. Thomas

looks stunned.

INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT

Kat cradles a phone to her shoulder. She watches television and

crushes Oreos into a bowl of ice- cream.

She hangs up the phone, mesmerized by the report:

FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER shows the pile up wreckage.

INT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nora and Tim watch the same report.

INT. EUGENE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eugene looks up from grading midterm bluebooks to watch.

INT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Burroughs numbly watches the same report. He doesn't see Kimberly

enter behind him from the kitchen.

B/W CAMERA FOOTAGE from Thomas' car shows Thomas tackling Kimberly to

the ground just as a jack -knifed truck plows into the SUV.

A GASP from behind him. Mr. Burroughs spins to see Kimberly fighting

back tears and picks up the remote, prepared to click of the TV --

but she stops him.

Mr. Burroughs reluctantly keeps the newscast on.

INT. RORY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

It's a party. Rory, surrounded by BUDDIES, shakes a triumphant fist

at the television. HE WHOOPS with delight, spilling popcorn

everywhere.

After high-fiving his peeps, he bends to table level and snorts a

freshly chopped line.

Rory looks up to see the DMV photo of Evan. As he takes in the

report, his mood radically shifts. He looks like he's been hit by a

train.

MONTAGE

Of Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Eugene and Kat watching. They all take the

news very hard as the FOOTAGE shows Evan's BODY being carried away by

EMT workers. Eugene, however, shakes his head sadly but goes back to

grading blue books.

TIM'S BEDROOM - LATER

Tim's eyes are glued to the latest Stephen King novel. Nora peers in.

Tim starts at her voice, then reluctantly puts down the book.

Nora swallows, trying to seem brave.

But neither of them are convinced.

Nora kisses his forehead and leaves the room. After she leaves, Tim

opens his nightstand drawer, pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs

it in.

INT. NORA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nora closes her bedroom door. And locks it. She nervously checks the

closet and even lowers the blinds. Finally, she takes out a business

card and dials a number. She hangs up, then dials again.

INT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Burroughs tucks a still-shaken Kimberly into bed. In one of his

hands is a nearly empty glass of scotch.

Mr. Burroughs catches himself being overprotective.

But Mr. Burroughs isn't ready to leave. He finishes his drink.

Kimberly tenses, bracing for the worst.

Mr. Burroughs leans over, kisses her forehead and leaves. Just as

he's out the door, he braces at the distant sound of a CAR SKIDDING

out of control. The ENDLESS SCREECH is nerve shattering. Mr.

Burroughs stands frozen, tensing for the inevitable crunch. But there

is none. And he leaves.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark except for one burning candle. Kimberly tosses and

turns. The wind sends a single branch scraping against her window. A

porch swing SQUEAKS back and forth. Adding to her anxiety.

A BREEZE ENTERS, sputtering out the candle. Kimberly sits upright in

bed and sees the WINDOW IS SHUT. Huh? She lights a match and sees the

candle wax dripped onto her table, forming the gooey shape of

a...180? The match goes out in her hand. The room is dark again.

Headlights fr om passing cars cast eerie shadows on her ceiling.

Shadows resembling PLANES seem to transform into a SKULL.

Kimberly, freaked out, looks around to see the blinking light from

the VCR: it flashes 18:0 a few times, then 12:00.

She can't take it anymore. She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and

flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows. And anxiously

turns on her computer.

EXT. STONEYBROOK HOSPITAL - DAY

Kimberly drives a beat up Hyundai through an eerie morning mist that

surrounds the grounds of the Stoneybrook Hospital.

ANGLE ON

A computer printout in the shotgun seat: MAPQUEST directions to

"Stoneybrook Hospital".

As Kimberly drives through the gate, the mist almost seems to follow

her inside.

A SIGN offers a choice between "Emergency/Medica l Care" or

"Psychiatric Treatment Center." Kimberly drives to the mental ward.

INT. MENTAL WARD - DAY

A PHYSICIAN in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of

a long corridor. The Physician consults a clipboard.

Kimberly watches carefully as the Physician comes to a door and

punches "4514" into the electronic lock. They continue down another

corridor.

Lights flicker,patients cackle and moan in the B.G.

Kimberly nods, hands it over.

They arrive at a door to a padded room. The Physician punches in

another code.

The door hisses open.

INT. CLEAR'S PADDED ROOM - CONTINUOUS

REVEAL CLEAR RIVERS

While still beautiful, this young woman bears few traces of her

former self. Her eyes dart around suspiciously, maddened by chronic

paranoia. Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted. Bordering on

savage. Her movements are fidgety, erratic, always distracted by

something unseen.

Clear looks Kimberly up and down and steps back, allowing her inside

her inner sanctum. A mattress on the floor, a plastic bottle of

water, some paperbacks and a bedpan.

Kimberly's jaw drops when she sees the far wall: a SHRINE to flight

180. The wall is papered with art icles about all the survivors (as

seen in the opening title montage).

The door SLAMS. Kimberly jumps.

Kimberly flinches.

Clear's eyes bore into a terrified Kimberly's.

Clear backs away from Kimberly as if she were lethal, then stops

short.

Kimberly nods, recalling the events.

Clear seems very disturbed by that.

Kimberly reluctantly strains to remember something...

HARD CUT TO:

THE FINAL MOMENTS OF THE PILE UP

Nora's Pacer folds like an accordion, then EXPLODES, followed by Evan

screaming in the Trans Am, which gets CREAMED by the semi!

BACK TO:

Kimberly, shaken, does the math.

Clear is oblivious when Kimberly breaks into silent sobs.

Clear sees Kimberly crying and softens.

For an instant, we see a gentle side of Clear.

Clear suddenly toughens up, an abrupt mood shift.

At once, Clear, enraged, is in her face, speaking through clenched

teeth.

Clear angrily peels a Polaroid off the wall and shows it to Kimberly.

While we don't see the photo, Kimberly's horrified face paints a

gruesome picture on its own.

Clear pounds on the door, apparently done with Kimberly. A GUARD

opens the door. Kimberly, devastated, turns to leave, then summons

her courage and turns back to Clear.

Kimberly leaves, giving Clear something to think about.

EXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY

As Kimberly pulls into her driveway, she's surprised to see a STRANGE

CAR parked there. Then --

THOMAS, wearing street clothes, peers through the front window of the

house. He guiltily backs away as Kimberly gets out.

Thoma s nods and leans against the large glass windows that reflect

the sky behind them.

Thomas hesitates before answering.

Suddenly through the reflection of the window glass, Kimberly sees

hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once!

Like a scene out of THE BIRDS, Kimberly must duck and cover as the

pigeons assault her from every angle.

But when Kimberly turns away from the reflection, toward the actual

pigeons, THEY'RE GONE. ALL IN HER HEAD.

Thomas, concerned for her, saw nothing.

EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - DAY

ANGLE ON

Woman's N ike shoe on a down-moving escalator. Reveal Nora taking her

son Tim to a dentist's office. The SHOELACE snags on a bolt of one of

the steel side panels, untying it...

Tim smiles, then winces from the pain in his mouth.

THE DANGLING SHOELACE heads straight for the escalator grate. IT GETS

SWALLOWED UP. As Tim steps off, Nora TRIPS forward. Her caught

sneaker is pulled tighter into the innards of the metal staircase.

Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker,

fear mounting. Tim also grabs her sneaker and yanks. Finally, the

shoelace SNAPS, and Nora's free again.

Nora puts on a brave face and begins tying one long shoelace to the

stubby one.

Tim nods. The wind picks up as they continue past a --

CONSTRUCTION CREW

Who apply industrial suction cups to large, thick sheets of PLATED

GLASS .

Tim stares in childlike fascination as they pass JACKHAMMERS, a

CEMENT MIXER, and an EXCAVATOR.

INT. CLEAR'S PADDED ROOM - DAY

Clear Rivers applies fun- tack to the back of a newspaper article and

sticks it on the wall devoted to Flight 180.

REVEAL

A photo of Eva, "Lotto Winner Killed By Ladder".

Clear backs away, pausing to look at a group photo of the Survivors

of Flight 180 just before take off. Smiling faces.

Dr. Lees keeps a skeptical smile to himself.

INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The RECEPTIONIST appears next to the fallen fish food with a VACUUM.

She plugs it in an outlet below the fishtank.

A startling GRIND as the vacuum turns on and coughs up a nail. She

vacuums up the fish food around Nora's feet.

The DEAD FISH gets sucked into the water filter in the fishtank which

sputters and stops. The water level RISES, spilling water over the

side of the tank. The water TRICKLES closer to the outlet.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Thomas drives his car into a friendly neighborhood. Kimberly, riding

shotgun, hangs up her cell phone.

Thomas expertly skids into a U-turn.

INT. DENTIST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tim looks petrified as Dr. Lees unveils a tray full of PICS, CARVERS

and EXTRACTING FORCEPS.

The KA-CHUNG of construction outside makes it im possible to

concentrate, but, hands trembling slightly, Dr. Lees picks up a pic

and mirror and starts examining Tim's mouth. CU of PIC gently

prodding Tim's teeth.

Tim groans "uh-uh", then suddenly flinches.

A BANG from the window startles Dr. Lees. His HAND JERKS, but luckily

the pic was removed from Tim's mouth.

Dr. Lees whips around in time to see a PIGEON flutter away from the

window.

Dr. Lees picks up a large SYRINGE and moves it toward Tim's open

mouth.

Tim's eyes radiate fear. The MOUTH OPENS. Reluctantly. Tim nervously

eyes the window as the needle enters...

ANGLE ON

NEEDLE heading toward his gumline --

BANG! Another pigeon takes a header into the reflection. Dr. Lees'

hand jerks, nearly jabbing Tim's tongue. Tim squirms violently. Dr.

Lees looks towards the window angrily.

Tim nods his head ferociously.

INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jean continues vacuuming. The vacuum makes contact with Nora's foot.

INT. DENTIST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

After a minute, Dr. Lees angrily switches on two compressors: Oxygen

and Nitrous Oxide.

By now, the NO mask has been attached around Tim's nose. As Tim

drifts off, Dr. Lees lowers a DRILL into his mouth.

Excruciating SOUNDS of the drill going through enamel.

INTERCUT KIMBERLY AND THOMAS

Racing to the medical complex throughout.

THE WAITING ROOM

The WATER TRICKLES into the outlet. The vacuum sparks and dies just

as --

BACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE

BANG! SFX: BROKEN GLASS - it sounds like a pigeon finally crashed

through the window. In the other room.

Dr. Lees marches out of the room to investigate. Another quick

electrical surge and the OXYGEN COMPRESSOR flutters off. The needle

drops. But the NITROUS flow remains strong.

ANGLE ON FISH MOBILE

Spinning from a new breeze. Suddenly, a small round PUFFER FISH FALLS

directly into Tim's mouth.

Soft, gurgling and choking.

INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nora stares at a pigeon with a broken wing frantically trying to fly

right. Dr. Lees makes a half- hearted attempt to soothe and catch it.

BACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE

SLOW DOLLY up to Tim. Choking, gurgling. His eyes are open, but

rolled up. His hand limply reaches up...then drops.

Sounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we continue

our SLOW DOLLY into Tim's eyes.

They GLAZE OVER...the choking stops. And a HAND reaches into frame

and pulls the puffer fish out of Tim's mouth.

REVEAL JEAN looking petrified at the close call, looking around to

make sure nobody saw...

EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER

Nora and Tim, feeling better now, walk past the CONSTRUCTION CREW. A

CRANE OPERATOR smiles at Tim, who smiles back.

From across the mall, the tiny running figures of Kimberly and Thomas

appear in the dis tance, pointing and screaming.

Just then, Tim and Nora walk into a large cluster of PIGEONS who

suddenly burst into flight, startling the Crane Operator, whose hand

inadvertently jerks a lever -

A METALLIC CHAIN RATTLE fills the air and Tim looks up just as a HUGE

SHEET OF GLASS PLUMMETS downward toward him and CRUSHES him, his

mangled body visible underneath.

As two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk, NORA SCREAMS.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER

Emergency vehicles everywhere. Thomas seems exhausted as he walks

back to Kimberly, who stands by his car. In the BG, EMTs load a

stretcher into an ambulance.

EXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY

Thomas' car turns into the driveway and parks. Kimberly holds up her

hand and watches it tremble.

Thomas kills the engine to listen.

Thomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly.

Kimberly, seeming overwhelmed, pulls her hand back. Thomas senses

he's losing her, and softens her approach.

Kimberly stares straight ahead, the weight of the world sinking in.

BANG! A startling pound on the roof of Thomas' car.

Kimberly jumps, then spins around to see:

CLEAR RIVERS - standing in the driveway. A determined, powerful

presence. Kimberly exits the car. A MOMENT where Kimberly and Clear

stare each other down.

Clear nods absently to Thomas, still focused on Kimberly.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

Thomas' car pulls into a partially filled parking lot. Kimberly,

Thomas and Clear file out and head to the door.

INT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Kimberly, Thomas and Clear open the large wooden doors into a small

chapel, creat ing a loud CREAK. A corpse in an open casket sits at the

front of the chapel, post -wake.

Kimberly, Thomas and Clear are forced to walk around the dead body to

get to a side door.

INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

The three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway.

An ORANGE GLOW flickers from the far room. The unmistakable sounds of

a furnace make it all the more eerie.

As they near the door, they're able to see inside the room; the

shadow of a figure looms against a steel oven.

They edge closer. They peek inside the --

INT. CREMATORIUM

Oddly there is no one there. As they enter, passing the furnace, a

momentary WHOOSH of flames startles them all!

They jump back - bumping right into:

MR. BLUDWORTH, the dark, sinister mortician from FD1, who has

inexplicably appear BEHIND THEM.

The mortician rolls a metal gurney carrying EVAN'S EYELESS BODY

toward the firing oven. Kimberly and Thomas are scared.

Clear, however, seems to expect nothing less.

The Mortician slides a gleaming set of medical pliers into Evan's

mouth. And YANKS out a gold tooth. Kimberly recoils as he discards

the bloody tooth on a metal tray.

The Mortician grins; he likes the new Clear. He crosses the room and

hits a LEVER. KA- CHUNK! The oven begins to blaze.

The Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down

to sniff, no INHALE, a terrified Kimberly's essence.

Kimberly shudders as the Mortician moves back to Evan's body. Clear

has had about enough.

The Mortician now CLAMPS THE PLIERS around Evan's NIPPLE RING.

A sick smile crosses the Mortician's lips. He yanks the nipple ring

OFF! Kimberly looks on both horrified and awed when Clear doesn't

flinch back from the pliers, where a bloody nub dangles.

Clear steps back from him, hate flashing in her eyes.

CREEEAAAK -SLAM! The Mortician rolls Evan's body into the oven.

His words hang in the air. An ominous BREEZE enters.

Thomas looks to Clear; what's he talking about? The Mortician focuses

on Kimberly as if the others had ceased to exist.

Evan's other eye POPS , startling Thomas and Kimberly.

The Mortician grabs Kimberly.

The Mortician finally lets Kimberly go.

The Mortician glances at his watch - Evan's bran d new Rolex.

EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

CLOSE UP - GAS DRIPPING

From the nozzle in Thomas' car. Thomas fills the tank, watching for

signs of danger. Clear's hand is poised over the gas pumps' EMERGENCY

CUT-OFF VALVE

Some SKATE RATS exit the mini -mart with a pack of Camels, followed by

Kimberly, who carries a couple of Red Bulls and hands them out.

Thomas tops off the tank. Some gas spills to the ground. Quick looks

all around -- sure enough, one of the Skate Rats is about to strike a

match.

CLEAR'S HAND SLAPS the kid in the back of the head, stopping him mid -

motion.

The startled Skate Rat shrinks back from Clear's rage.

Thomas chuckles to himself and looks at Kimberly who --

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE - DAY

POV DRIVER. Grease-covered female hands reach out toward a steering

wheel of a white van speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE!

The van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In

moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped.

Drowning. Horrible.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. GAS STATION - DAY

KIMBERLY

Comes to Thomas' arms - GASPING uncontrollably for breath. Terror-

stricken. She begins hyperventilating.

It's so bad, Kimberly can't speak. She coughs and gags as if recently

drowned. Clear scans the perimeter for immediate dangers.

QUICK CUTS:

A POWER REPAIRMAN

On a cherry picker messes with the transformer, a LAWN BOY pull-

starts a WEED WHACKER close to broken glass, a MECHANIC on a tall

ladder changes out the gas price numbers, a female DOG WALKER with

three dogs approaches the ladder.

Clear shakes her head by the shoulders and barks commands like an

angry drill sergeant.

The words slowly take affect. Kimberly becomes centered, getting her

breath back, and speaks without a hitch.

Thomas gently releases her, paces.

INT. A/V ROOM - POLICE STATION - LATER

Thomas works a VCR, scanning BACKWARDS through the video footage from

the patrol car camera. We see the SUV's explosive collision with the

jack- knifed semi. Kimberly is taken by surprise by the sight of the

crash.

Thomas sees Kimberly and quickly flicks off the monitor.

Kimberly notices Clear watching her and toughens up. She forces back

the tears and qui ckly wipes the rest away.

Clear sits beside Kimberly.

Kimberly looks grateful, and a moment passes between them, but she's

already buried the need to cry.

Clear does, watching the cars seemingly pass in reverse.

THE MONITOR

Back, back, back until the Patrol Car slowly creeps backwards down

the onramp.

Thomas hits play and we see footage from the patrol car cruising past

the White Van. A clean shot of the license plate. Jackpot.

As Thomas slides his chair to a data base and types in the plate

number, the pause function dislodges, slowly advancing the tape frame

by frame.

Thomas' computer screen finally fills with information.

They all get up and leave.

Ominously, THE MONITOR shows the NEXT VEHICLE creeping behind Nora's

Pacer - a white van!

INT. CRUZ HOUSE - NIGHT

Thomas pulls up to an upper-middle class house. Thomas, Kimberly and

Clear get out and start up the unlit path. It's dark, hard to see

where they're going, so they negotiate by feeling the bushes aligning

the walkway.

Kimberly nods, ever creeping closer to the front door -- when

AUTOMATIC LIGHTS FLASH from over the garage.

All three freeze for a moment, during which we hear STOMPING emanate

from within the house, and the lights SHUT OFF.

But nothing else happens. No one comes to a door. Thomas sighs, and

as if suddenly remembering his status, he walks fearlessly and

purposefully to the front door.

He makes a fist, is about to knock - when the DOOR FLINGS OPEN and a

ROTTWEILER LUNGES for his throat - only to have its collar snagged at

the last second by its owner -

JORGE CRUZ, late 30's, handsome, cocky. He speaks above Rotty's

BARKING:

Suddenly, with an unexpected fury, Jorge SCREAMS at his dog.

The Rottweiler cowers, and Jorge shoves it to the floor, where it

lands on its feet and fearfully trots away. Jorge's face is once

again pleasant, but it's a thin veneer.

Jorge sees Clear and Kimberly behind Thomas and frowns.

ANGLE ON CLEAR - eyeing what appears to be DROPS OF BLOOD on the tile

floor. She takes in what she can see of --

THE ROOM

As if a tornado had hit it. Wedding photos smashed and torn.

Furniture over-turned.

Jorge's eyes flicker ever -so- involuntarily behind him.

But by now, Thomas has seen everything Clear has and more. He stares

through the house, into a bedroom and sees -

A FEMALE FOOT lying half0buried under the bedspr ead.

Jorge is already closing the door.

Clear rushes the door, shoulders it and expertly wriggles past

Jorge's grasp.

Clear tears into the bedroom, grabs the bedspread and THROWS it to

the floor to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN, naked, trembling with fear, takes

a closer look at Clear.

Meanwhile, Jorge yells at Thomas.

Defensively, Jorge holds up his arm. Freshly cut.

Jorge flinches. It's time to come clean.

He eyes a SHATTERED CELL PHONE on the floor.

Jorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed.

Clear mutters something as they exit the house.

Jorge hisses something at the Rotty, which CHARGES them and SPRINGS!

But Thomas slams the door on the frothing dog just in time.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Rory sits in his Chevette outside an apartment building, staring up

at the address. He quickly snorts some powder off his key and wipes

his nostrils free of crystals. He takes a breath and exits the car.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Rory follows some PEOPLE into the elevator. The elevator doors close

on his shoe -- trapping Rory in an awkward position.

One MAN frantically pushes the DOORS OPEN button to no avail.

Finally, as the elevator rises, Rory YANKS his foot free.

Rory bends down and inspects his shoe.

Rory briefly holds the shoe too close to the Man's face - see? -

before disgustedly slipping it back on.

DING. The doors open. The man hurries out and the elevator DOORS

CLOSE on Rory's smirking face.

HARD CUT TO:

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - LATER

REVEAL - Nora, Rory, and Kat, mortified, sit on a couch. It's obvious

the bomb's been dropped, reality has set in. Clear and Kimberly await

their reactions. Nora raises a trembling hand.

Kat opens her purse and hands her a blue pill.

Nora pops it in her mouth.

Nora chews, her eyes half dead from bereavement. Across the loft,

Thomas paces, phone in hand.

Eugene alone seems unafraid. He uses a GRABBER - a long pole with

movable claw on the end - to OPEN THE SKYLIGHT. When done, he

balances the long pole precariously against the wall.

An OMINOUS BREEZE enters. Clear notices MAGAZINE PAGES blowing over

the desk by the couch.

Kat's hands ball into fists. The hatred is mutual. Clear reaches for

a nearby cardboard box on the desk, noticing MAGAZINE PAGES blowing

over until their weight tips over a PENCIL HOLDER which spills pens

out. She takes the box to Nora.

She reaches into the box and passes out cell phones to Nora and the

others.

Nora's head falls. Kimberly senses her anguish and takes over.

Everyone nods in understanding. Rory fidgets, sniffling, then POUNDS

the table in frustration. Startling Kat.

Clear, very alert, looks at the tipped PENCIL HOLDER. PENS ROLL

toward the end of the desk, toward a large White Pages directory

which hangs precariously off the edge just so.

No one says a word.

They take turns going around the room.

Clear fumes. Rory looks ill and reaches into his wallet.

Rory holds up two Yankee tickets.

INT. CHEAP MOTEL - NIGHT

ANGLE ON ISABELLA'S PREGNANT BELLY.

REVEAL she's lying down, binging on take- out food, while speaking on

the motel phone. A disturbing metallic SQUEAK SCRAPE -SQUEAK can be

heard, nearly drowning out the SCREAMING COUPLE next door.

Isabella hangs up, recoiling at VIOLENT THUMPS against her wall. PULL

BACK AND UP TO REVEAL the source of the unsettling SQUEAK is a

rickety, wobbling CEILING FAN.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kimberly whispers into the phone.

She hangs up, looking guilty for having lied to her father. Clear

keeps her eyes on the pens that ROLL on the slightly canted table

into the about-to -fall White Pages directory.

The pens softly tap the phone book one by one until it lazily tips

over and PLOPS HEAVILY onto a GOOSE-DOWN THROW PILLOW.

Small feathers from the pillow are carried upwards by the breeze.

Everyone in the room watches them rise.

They float across the room, ultimately landing on a MOUSETRAP! SNAP!

The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber

- which tips and slowly slides down the wall.

Clear, in a chair, looks directly above her head at a LARGE SWORDFISH

mounted on the wall.

The Grabber picks up speed, arcs downward and hits the mounted

SWORDFISH. The supporting brackets give, causing the SWORDFISH TO TIP

and SLIDE DOWNWARD!

Clear lurches back in her chair just in time - the razor sharp bill

impales the seat cushion between her legs!

Clear gets up, carefully easing herself around the swordfish. Eugene

isn't quite sure what to make of what he's just seen.

Kimberly looks self-conscious by her outburst. Clear, however, looks

grateful.

MONTAGE - SAFEPROOFING THE APARTMENT

Everyone but Nora and Eugene helps unplug appliances, put out the

fire, take down hanging objects, switch off the gas, put sharp

objects away, affix padding to chart corners...

Kat, placing poisonous cleansers and flammable liquids in a box,

nervously pulls out a pack of smokes. Thomas watches as he takes a

hanging mirror off the wall.

Kat steps towards the front door, then remembers the cell phone and

grabs it just in case. Thomas smiles 'good job' at her.

Kimberly, unscrewing the light bulb, looks up when Nora rises from

the couch in a stupor and struggles to put on her jacket. Kimberly

looks concerned.

Nora fights the sleeve, dazed and defeated.

Kimberly stops pouring liquor down the drain.

Eugene snickers. Nora looks up, anger surfacing.

Nora looks more resolute than ever.

Everyone looks crushed when Nora heads for the door. Except Eugene,

who stands up as well.

As Eugene heads out, Kimberly becomes enraged and grabs him.

Rory presses a cell phone into Eugene's hand on his way out.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Eugene pushes the elevator button a thousand times. Nora nervously

ties her long hair back in a single braid.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment.

RORY, standing on the couch, pulls a POLICE ACADEMY DIPLOMA off the

wall - and slips - stumbling BACKWARDS into the closet.

Staggering, he accidentally knocks some COAT HANGARS and a VOLLEYBALL

TROPHY from the high shelf to the floor.

Thomas whips around and sees that Rory's not hurt. He then lowers his

gaze and sees --

The figurine of a VOLLEYBALL TROPHY is framed by a tangled jumble of

wire COAT HANGARS. Suddenly, STREETLIGHT FLICKERS ON for the evening.

Oddly, it only illuminates the Trophy/Hangar array.

From Rory's vantage point, it looks like a surreal sculpture of a man

with hooks emanating from his body. The sodium vapor lamp casts an

OMINOUS GLOW around the image.

The others look over, trying to see what he does.

Kimberly and Clear stare at the volleyball trophy - the street lamp

ominously FLICKERS OUT AND DIES.

Everyone looks around for a hesitant beat, then Thomas picks up his

cell phone. Clear first walks, then RUNS out the door.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

The elevator finally comes. Eugene and Nora get inside, standing in

front of a gaunt looking man holding a cardboard box full of

PROSTHETIC LIMBS.

MUZAK plays AC/DC's HIGHWAY TO HELL.

The Gaunt Man says nothing. The DOORS CLOSE.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Eugene stares blankly at the CONCAVE MIRROR in the upper corner. He's

disturbed by the WARPED REFLECTION OF:

THE GAUNT MAN leans closer to Nora's hair and as the doors finally

close, he leans over and SMELLS it. Creepy.

Nora bends down to tie her shoelace (the one that snapped). She tries

tying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one as Eugene's cell

phone VIBRATES in his hand. Startled, he drops it to the floor. Then

looks embarrassed.

Nora picks it up. STATIC CRACKLES. It's hard to make out Thomas'

yelling.

A beat of confusion, then she slowly turns to see the clawed hooks

and hands of the Prosthetic limbs. Terror. She freezes.

But Nora's too frightened to speak. Eugene grabs the phone, hearing

unintelligible STATIC.

INTERCUT CLEAR

As she frantically hits the elevator button. When it fails to come,

she runs downstairs.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Nora slowly rises to her feet, feverishly mouthing a prayer... As the

door opens, Nora rushes out - unseen to her, her long braid gets

snagged on one of the PROSTHETIC HOOKS, YANKING her backwards.

The Guant Man's sweet voice and demeanor are a clear contrast to his

outward appearance.

Nora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid. Nora

desperately spins her body around, sticking her head back inside the

elevator.

Kat appears in the lobby, smoking a cigarette.

The elevator DOORS begin to close, and CLAMP around Nora's neck, her

head inside, body outside the elevator.

Eugene pounds on the BUMPERS, but they don't seem to work!

INTERCUT

The UP BUTTON is lit. Clear rushes to the lobby.

The Elevator RISES!

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR, Eugene watches Nora's head drop to floor level -

then he pounds the Emergency Button - which SHORTS OUT!

Nora's body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator floor!

Nora's screams of terror and agony fill the air as the elevator

repeatedly LURCHES UPWARDS.

Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor.

It lurches. And lurches. And lurches. The horror never ends.

Clear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight. She runs

to the elevator doors, trying to pry them apart to no avail.

All Kat can do, crying, is grab hold of Nora's flailing legs and try

to pull her back down.

The elevator lurches a final time. NORA'S HEADLESS BODY fall down

into Kat's arms, knocking her to the floor. Kat freaks, skittering

away as the body convulses.

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

Eugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear. A

bloodcurdling moan escapes him. He stares transfixed as Nora's head,

still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor.

The sight clearly sends Eugene over the edge. He SCREAMS, CLAWS AND

POUNDS, desperate to escape the elevator.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Eugene suddenly bursts through the door, babbling incoherently.

Kimberly, Thomas and Rory look on, bewildered.

Eugene's in another world. He approaches Thomas and lunges for his

GUN - yanking it from the holster!

A twisted insane smile comes to Eugene's face as he jams the

gunbarrel to his temple. The others shrink back in terror.

He PULLS THE TRIGGER. CLICK! Eugene tries again. CLICK!

Thomas looks stunned as Eugene goes through every round, CLICK CLICK

CLICK CLICK CLICK CLI CK...

Kimberly breaths a sigh of relief.

Thomas' eyes disagree. He reaches in and GRABS the gun away from

Eugene, who stands there trembling. Thomas cracks open the cylinder.

Loaded.

Everyone turns to see Clear and Kat, standing in the doorway,

DRENCHED IN BLOOD. Kat trembles uncontrollably.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - DAWN

Flashing lights from rescue vehicles illuminate the living room. In

the newly conformed safe house, Kat and Clear relax as best they can

in Thomas' dry clothes.

Thomas makes another phone call. In the corner, Eugene shivers to

himself. Desperately looking for signs of danger. He looks over to

Clear.

Eugene looks immensely relieved. Rory ambles over to Kimberly, his

typical callousness gone.

Rory nods. He expected as much. He fishes his LICENSE and KEYS out of

his pocket.

Kimberly looks deeply into his eyes, looking for the punchline. When

she doesn't see one, she nods tenderly and takes the keys.

The PHONE RINGS. Rory jumps at the sound, paranoid eyes in scan mode.

Thomas answers, speaks softly, hangs up.

EXT. COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

Kat's Ford Expedition winds its way through rural New York.

A SPORTS CAR speeds past on the left, then as it pulls in front of

the Exped ition, its slipstream sucks over some debris from the

shoulder; a thin metal piece of trim, which bounces in front of Kat's

Expedition's left front tire.

CU KAT'S WHEEL WELL -- the metal trim is shot upward into the wheel

well, where it lodges firmly, its sharp metal edge GRINDING AGAINST

THE RUBBER.

INSIDE THE CAR

Kat drives, Thomas reading directions in the shotgun seat. Kimberly,

Eugene and Rory ride in back. In the CARGO area, Clear scans out the

rear window for danger.

Rory fidgets.

An uncomfortable beat.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

Isabella, pissed, is in a holding tank. Small town deputy STEVE

ADAMS, 30's, CLEANS HIS GUN in her direction.

As she fumes, a rivulet of WATER streaks down her leg.

Steve, at first confused, sees the water and gasps.

He rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell.

As Steve throws on his jacket, we reveal its prominent emblem:

GREENWOOD LAKE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT.

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Small town station. Only one patrol car. In the patrol car, Isabella

buckles up in the sho tgun seat, the belt stretched tightly across her

belly.

Deputy Steve tries the ignition, but the car won't start.

EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - DAY

KAT'S EXPEDITION speeds through a yellow light and continues on.

CLOSE ON EXPEDITION'S LEFT TIRE

Metal sheers away more rubber.

INSIDE THE EXPEDITION

Rory, antsy, rubbing his nostrils, stares at two Yankee tickets.

Everyone nods in that 'life's weird' reverence kind of way.

A chill passes over the group.

INT. WINDING ROADS - DAY

Deputy Steve speeds the White Van up the narrow winding road.

Isabella breathes Lamaze- style through intense pain.

Speeding up the incline, Steve tries to speed around a Volkswagon

Beetle, but cars scream by in the opposite direction.

Steve leans on the horn and stomps the gas, dangerously riding the

shoulder around the Beetle.

Way ahead of the Beetle, on the left side, is a LAKE.

EXT. WINDING ROADS

BRIAN GIBBONS, 15, cheerfully drives a TRACTOR hauling a WHOODCHIPPER

across the high crest of the empty road toward a pile of thick

branches.

The Tractor unexpectedly stalls in the middle of the road. He tries

the ignition, pumps the gas. Nothing...

Only by standing on the tractor can Brian see the White Van speeding

up the hill toward him. He jumps down and frantically tires starting

the tractor. Once, twice, nothing.

EXT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS

CU FRONT TIRE - METAL shreds away more rubber.

INT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS

Rory excitedly makes a connection.

Everyone nods, anticipating...

Clear stops when she sees all the color has drained from Kimberly's

face. Even Eugene looks concerned.

The car becomes completely silent (except for the slight SCRAPING) as

Kimberly prepares to tell her story.

Thomas mouths, "Tod?" to Clear. Clear nods.

Kimberly looks to Clear.

Thomas reaches between the seats and takes Kimberly's hand. As he

looks into her eyes, Kat takes her own eyes off the road to light a

cigarette.

INTERCUT BRIAN

The tractor is safely off the road next to a wood pile. Brian grabs a

cord and starts up the whoodchipper.

INT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS

Eugene nods, slowly getting it.

This chapter of the screenplay contains scene(s) that do not appear

or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the

integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.

CU LEFT TIRE

A thick retread sheers itself onto the pavement.

BRIAN

The wood chipper roar s loudly. Suddenly, some forgotten stray chunk

SHOOTS from the spout --

The airborne chunk of WOOD CRACKS the White Van's windshield. Steve

veers out of control.

Kat sees the White Van ahead swerving into HER LANE. She quickly

jerks the wheel to the right.

Kat's LEFT FRONT TIRE BLOWS! It sends rubber flying and the entire

SUV pulls hard to the left, spinning her out of control into the

oncoming lane of traffic - toward the White Van!

Isabella SCREAMS! Steve jerks the wheel to the left! The White Van

has a close near miss with the Expedition, and goes off the road

toward a LAKE!

The SUV misses the tractor -- but sails off the other side of the

embankment, spinning and rolling towards --

THE GIBBONS' FARM

At the bottom of the hill of a large rural farm, a PROPANE TANK sits

at the edge of the property!

The SUV barrels down the hill - coming right for it!

INSIDE THE SUV

All Kat can do is cover her head with her arms.

THE WHITE VAN

Speeding toward the lake! Isabella SCREAMS, in pain, not fear. The

White Van is ready for splashdown.

Steve finesses the hand brake while tapping the accelerator. He's

able to right the van away from the water without so much as a hard

jerk.

THE PROPANE TANK

It's about to get creamed - but the bouncing Expedition just barely

misses it! It continues, backwards, CRASHING through a temporary

fence and right into --

AN AGRICULTURAL CONSTRUCTION SITE!

The Expedition plows past earth movers, crashing through irrigation

ditches and pipes, shrapnel flying everywhere.

Just as the Expedition comes to a stop, an IRRIGATION PIPE ROCKETS

through the rear window -- miraculously missing Clear and Rory --

coming to a rest just behind Kat's head.

INSIDE THE WHITE VAN

Steve sees the wreckage on the other side of the highway and slows

down. Isabella squeezes his hand white.

Steve looks ill, then sees another car stopping by the crash. He

floors it and speaks into the shoulder mic of his cop radio.

THE EXPEDITION

The dust settles in the silent car. The only sound is a QUIET, WET

WHEEZE. Clear, dazed, looks around carefully, avoiding the METAL

SPIKE that skewers the vehicle.

Rory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed to see it.

Kimberly shakes her hair, spilling glass onto the floor. Kat tries to

open the door, but it won't budge.

A BLOODY HAND SEIZES HIS SHOULDER!

Thomas turns to see

Eugene SPASMING in the back seat! He clutches his ribcage in agony

and wheezes! Blood trickles from his mouth.

Eugene's head tilts forward, unconscious.

EXT. GIBBONS' FARM - DAY

BRIAN GIBBONS jumps off the tractor and sprints down the hill toward

the accident. At the edge of the property is a common farm FENCE made

from wooden posts bridged by two thick wires.

Brian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a DEAD OAK

TREE ten feet inside the fence. In the BG, MR. GIBBONS darts inside a

double-wide construction trailer.

WE FOLLOW BRIAN

To the crash site. Brian's jaw drops as he absorbs the chilling sight

of a guy and a girl dragging a blood- soaked man from the back seat to

perform CPR on him.

Around Brian, voices mesh in a surreal haze.

We STEADICAM around Brian to reveal a woman screaming from the

driver's seat. The sound is surreal.

The color drains from Brian's face as the dying man on the ground

coughs blood and the girl performing CPR recoils.

The moment is still surreal as Brian steps back, further away from

the horrors he can't face. Into the street --

And Rory yanks him back from imminent death as an AMBULANCE SPEEDS

onto the property.

That SNAPS Brian back to reality. Sounds become normal again. Brian

collects himself and SNIFFS the air. He then drops to ground level,

looking under the Expedition for something.

Brian sticks his head in Kat's window and peers down at her trapped

leg. He swipes the broken glass away from the window with this thick

flannel sleeve, reaches in, and tries to YANK the door open with all

his might.

No good, Kat SCREAMS in pain.

Brian steps back as the emergency vehicle speeds over.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GIBBON'S FARM - LATER

Clear watches two EMTS lo ad Eugene into the back of an ambulance. An

oxygen mask has been placed over his mouth.

As Clear continues, the exasperated Paramedics do their best to

ignore her. When she tries to climb inside, she is pushed away.

Again, she's shoved away and steps back, helpless.

Thomas and Kimberly stand by Kat, still trapped in the SUV.

A RESCUE WORKER carries the JAWS of LIFE past Clear towards the

Expedition.

The hydraulic hose that leads back to the Power Unite WRAPS AROUND

CLEAR'S LEG.

As the hose tightens, Clear realizes she's surrounded by shards of

glass and metal. She quickly WRESTLES herself free of the hose and

watches the Paramedics lock Eugene's gurney into place.

The doors slam, revealing the PHELPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL logo. The

ambulance speeds off, spraying gravel at her.

She reaches into her pocket and withdraws a CRUSHED cell phone. Shit.

She runs back over to Thomas.

A NEWS VAN tries to weave through the emergency vehicles to get

closer to teh accident.

ANGLE ON NEWS VAN UNDERCARRIAGE

It sinks into the loose dirt, SCRAPING A LARGE ROCK. The gas tank

PUNCTURES.

EMT'S angrily wave the news van back to the road, where it parks near

the twin wire fence opposite the DEAD OAK TREE.

Immediately, A CAMERA CREW exits the van to catch the action. Rory

steps behind the News Van, making sure he can't be seen, and digs

into his sock, coming up with a bindle. A SMILE...

Rory cringes at his name, pockets his stash, then EXITS FRAME. WE

PUSH IN, the news van gas tank is leaking. A SMALL DRIP...

EXT. GIBBON'S FARM - CONTINUOUS

Thomas, Kimberly, Clear and Rory watch the JAWS OF LIFE being clamped

onto Kat's door.

Thomas runs in the direction of some local POLICE. After he leaves,

Rory drifts away from the pack, hand in pocket.

Kimberly moves back to Kat, who chain -smokes in the front seat of the

Expedition.

The KA-CHUNK of the Jaws of Life next to Kat startles her half to

death.

Brian and Mr. Gibbons approach with a cup of tap water. They hand it

to kat, who frowns but drinks anyway.

CUT TO:

THE DRIP

Of the leaking gas becomes a steady trickle. GAS SLITHERS over packed

dirt, around debris, toward the crash site.

BACK TO:

THOMAS DARK ROOM

Speaks to another COP who clicks off his radio.

KAT

Lights one cigarette off the other KA -CHUCNK! The sound makes her

flinch, dropping the cigarette on the floor.

Kat rescues the glowing cigarette from around her feet and inhales.

KA-CHUNK!!! She jumps again, but maintains her composure.

MEANWHILE

The gasoline purposefully trickles down corrugated steel, through

pipes, closer and closer to the Expedition. At one point, the gas

even disappears into a hole in the ground, only to resurface twenty

feet closer to the site...

KIMBERLY

Looks confused to watch Rory climb between the fence wires and drift

the Dead Oak Tree into the field. Thomas runs down the hill toward

Kimberly.

Rescue Workers pull off a large chunk of door. KA-CHUNK! Kat

Flinches.

Brian hands out drinks to Rescue Workers.

Thomas sees Rory in the field and angrily hops the fence, heading

directly under the dead Oak Tree.

Rory, his back to everyone, finally opens the BINDLE. Enraptured, he

delicately unfolds it...

KIMBERLY

Is put on alert by a fresh BREEZE. Her attention is caught by the

WINDOW of an emergency vehicle. IN THE REFLECTION, Kimberly sees a

man sitting on the Expedition, but when she spins ar ound, there's no

one there.

KA-CHUNG! The door comes off the Expedition, finally freeing Kat!

Everyone applauds!

Mr. Gibbons, applauding with everyone else, chooses that very moment

to sit on the bumper.

DEPLOYING THE AIRBAG!

SLAMMING Kat's head backwards through the spike, HEAD-KABOB.

Kat's dead limp hand drops her last cigarette -- which bounces along

the hard dirt -- toward the oncoming gas. Closer, closer,.. The

BREEZE KICKS UP, aiding the cigarette.

WHOOSH, the gas fuse catches. The blusih flame travels through pipes,

over rocks, racing toward the news VAN.

Kimberly , half-traumatized, watches an ominous BREEZE rustle through

the field, up to the trees, toward Thomas.

The GAS BURNS up an incline, and disappears into the ground... And

pops up twenty feet closer to the News Van.

Kimberly follows the BREEZE to the dead oak tree under which Thomas

stands. And blows a large branch until it snaps! A startled Thomas

sees it fall just in time to DIVE to safety.

Clear, seeing the flame, instinctively runs from the van.

BOOM! The news van's explosion hurls two fence posts just over

Thomas' head, end over end, the two lengths of wire stretched between

them. The flying garrote heads directly for --

Rory, who sorts hard, stands up with a satisfied smile - and is

sliced into three sharp cuts of beef.

The silence from the emergency crew is deafening. Mr. Gibbons starts

crying hysterically.

Kimberly numbly stares at the fallen branch, the one that caused

Thomas to step out of the path of the flying fence.

Kimberly sees the corpses of Kat and Rory, buries the pain, and

approaches Mr. Gibbons.

Mr. Gibbons hands Kimberly the keys.

EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - MOMENTS LATER

Kimberly drives Thomas and Clear in the Gibbons' truck. All are numb.

Kimberly unbuckles her seatbelt and floors it.

The truck speeds into the horizon.

EXT. PHELP'S MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING SHOT

INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

Typical chatter as the staff preps Isabella. Steve paces nervously in

the background.

Isabella breathes Lamaze style in the hospital bed, her feet in

stirrups. A NURSE rocks Isabella's body back and forth, until her

back arches almost unnaturally forward.

In the BG, an OBSTETRICIAN, 50s, sterilizes his hands in a scrub

sink.

A female ANESTHESIOLOGIST hustles over, swabbing a LONG EPIDURAL

NEEDLE. The nurse places a mask over Isabella's face. The

Anesthesiologist lowers the needle to the base of Isabella's spine.

The Nurse SNEEZES.

XCU NEEDLE

Tracing skin between Isabella's constantly moving vertebra.

ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE

It buzzes about the room, darting between the he ads of the doctors

and nurses, hovering above the --

ANESTHESIOLOGIST, who traces the long needle down Isabella's spine,

finding the proper vertebrae.

Everyone freezes. SILENCE. As the tip of the needle presses the skin

down --

The BEE lands on the Anesthesiologist's ear. And STINGS!

FLINCH!

The NEEDLE SINKS IN - a NURSE GASPS. Did something go wrong?

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly speeds the truck down some dangerously twisty roads slick

from wet leaves.

A somber beat. Then Thomas looks over at the speedometer.

Suddenly, Kimberly clutches her throat!

HARD CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

UNKNOWN POV

A NURSE hovers over us in a hospital, WRESTLING us down by the look

of things. There is SCREAMING all around. The image comes at us so

fast, we see only the briefest glimpse of the NAMETAG on her uniform:

KALARJIAN

INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly "comes to" at the wheel -- FLAILING DESPERATELY at the

steering wheel. She even claws at Thomas who tries to control the

neglected steering wheel.

Kimberly looks up as the truck comes around a blind curve, where cars

are backed up at a stop sign. Kimberly screams and SLAMS on the

brakes.

The truck SKIDS on wet leaves, completely out of control, towards a

LANDSCAPING TRUCK parked on the shoulder.

Kimberly's truck hits the loading ramps and launches itself twenty

feet into the air, DUKES OF HAZZARD-style.

And lands miraculously without a scratch! On a parallel road. And

keeps going. Dumb, insane fucking luck.

Kimberly shakes off her premonition and looks out the rear window.

She turns around with a cocky smile.

She rubs her throat and FLOORS IT again to Thomas' horror, more

determined.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

WIPING FRAME, a NURSE enters a room and reads a clipboard on an

unseen patient's bed.

REVEAL EUGENE lying in a hospital bed, wired to the latest medical

hardware. Nearby, a RESPIRATOR plunges up and do wn, the RESPIRATOR

TUBE snaking down Eugene's throat.

The NURSE'S HAND reaches down to Eugene's neck...

Eugene WINCES when the Nurse gives the tube a friendly little SHAKE

to check if it's stable.

Eugene rolls his eyes. Stupid question.

She sticks an electri c thermometer in his ear. Eugene opens his mouth

as if to speak.

Eugene looks ready to cry. The Nurse sits on the bed, jarring Eugene

enough to make him WINCE again.

Eugene looks grat eful to see a humane side to this creature.

EXT. WINDY ROADS - DAY

The pick up truck races to the hospital. As Kimberly speeds past a

billboard, a POLICE CAR pulls in hot pursuit.

At the next intersection, TWO MORE COP CARS APPEAR.

The pick up truck blows by the second pair of cop cars, which

instantly join the high speed chase. Kimberly takes a long look in

the rearview mirror at the TAILGATING COPS. She then inspects the

road ahead.

UP IN THE DISTANCE

A busy six-lane intersection.

Kimberly SPEEDS toward the intersection. She pulls her seatbelt

aside, making sure it offers ZERO protection. Thomas jumps in the

backseat, buckles up...

Kimberly's eyes widen in fear. Her foot hesitates over the brake

pedal as --

The truck blindly blazes through the busy intersection, miraculously

missing every car!

The police are just barely able to fishtail into 90 degree turns,

avoiding the intersection completely.

Kimberly's eyes open and she lets out a victory cry.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

ANGLE ON

Oxygen valve. PAN OVER AND DOWN TO

Eugene tries to watch a news flash of HIS accident on the TV across

the room, but a bulky ORDERLY blocks his view.

As Eugene shudders with dread, the Orderly pushes a huge cart in

front of him, again obscuring his view. Eugene frantically pantomimes

writing.

Eugene tries nodding his thanks, but the tube in his throat hampers

his movement.

Finally, the Orderly pushes the cart away, revealing the TV. An

ANCHOR MAN taps his pages on the desktop.

A WEATHERMAN dressed as a frog points out cloud formations.

Eugene, tormented, stares at the screen as the Orderly begins pushing

the huge cart out of the room.

The sound of a SKIDDING CAR fills the room. It comes from the TV

which shows a PSA featuring CRASH TEST DUMMIES.

The Orderly flicks the thermostat and one by one, VENTS CLOSE just

below the ceiling.

Eugene's eyes fill with terror - he knows something's wrong.

ANGLE ON OXYGEN HOSE -

Bursting. It HISSES softly. We follow the OBLIVIOUS ORDERLY out of

the room.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

A hospital ADMINISTRATOR briskly strides up to the Orderly.

The Orderly smacks his forehead - shit. Totally forgot.

The Orderly, nodding rapidly, is halfway down the hall by now. The

Administrator shakes his head in disgust and walks past.

The HUGE CART. Which now blocks the door on Eugene's room.

EXT. PHELPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly seems to have ditched the cops. She speeds the pick up

through the medical facility.

EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

The pick up skids to a halt in front of the hospital. Kimberly,

Thomas and Clear run outside and into the building.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

The OXYGEN HOSE hisses, but is drowned out by the volume of the TV.

Eugene's eyes dart frantically as a blaring fast food commercial

ends. The n, a NEWS REPORT comes on. The BANNER:

ROUTE 18 TRAGEDY

Footage showing grieving families, wreaths on doors, yellow ribbons,

and emergency crews pulling wreckage apart, dissolve together over:

Suddenly, the FRAYED ELECTRIC CORD of Eugene's TV begins sparking.

The sound DROPS OUT, the picture SPUTTERS.

Eugene goes white with terror. He looks back to --

The broken OXYGEN TUBE. HISSING softly. The BEEPS of the EEG machine

frantically increase. Eugene reaches for the nurse call switch.

Mockingly out of reach by mere millimeters.

INT. NURSES STATION - DAY

Clear, Kimberly and Thomas dash toward the main desk.

The Receptionist eyes her dubiously.

Clear vaults over the counter, straight-arms the Receptionist and

seizes the computer. Thomas and Kimberly look on, stunned.

Kimberly and Thomas hurry to the elevator banks...then reconsider and

enter the stairwell.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eugene scratches the top sheet of the bed, trying to inch the call-

switch closer and closer to him. But it won't budge.

A RAT APPEARS behind Eugene's pillow, CRAWLS over his chest and

disappears by his stomach!

He pounds desperately on the empty food tray, his side rails, looks

toward the door --

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Outside the door, you can't hear a thing in the bustling hallway as

people rush by. Kimberly and Thomas rush past his door, lost.

BACK TO EUGENE

His eyes scream insanely, but he respirator tube prevents any sound

from escaping him. And that's when the RAT appears on the floor and

begins gnawing on the respirator's power cord!

When Eugene sees this, the EEG machine climbs off the charts.

INT. NURSES STATION - CONTINUOUS

Clear takes off down the hallway. The Receptionist, shaken, dials her

phone.

INT. DELIVERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Obstetrician voices concern.

The Obstetrician's hands go to work. Steve looks ill.

INTERCUT KIMBERLY AND THOMAS

Running down the corridor.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

The rat GNAWS away at Eugene's power cord, Eugene looks trapped,

helpless, tortured.

His eyes dart from the sparking TV to the gnawed power cord to the

useless call- switch.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Clear walks up and down the corridor, scanning room numbers as she

passes. A -169, A- 171, A-173...

A HAND suddenly GRABS Clear and shoves her against the wall. REVEAL A

SECURITY GUARD leering at her.

Clear struggles to get away, getting sympathetic looks from an OLD

MAN walking a rolling IV STAND down the corridor.

INT. DELIVERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Isabella is pushing again.

The NURSE takes a pair of SCISSORS off a tray.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Clear plays possum, offering no resistance to the Security Guard as

the Old Man wheels his IV STAND along.

Suddenly, Clear grabs the stand - and WHAMS the heavy wheeled base

into the Guard's BALLS! As the Guard recoils, she thoughtfully hands

the IV back to the Old Man and runs.

INT. DELIVERY ROOM 0 CON

The Nurse is startled when Kimberly and Thomas BURST THROUGH the

door. In the BG, a puzzled Steve peeks inside until Kimberly pulls

the door closed.

Finally we hear the BABY CRY! The Nurse immediately moves in to

swaddle the newborn. Dr. Kalarjian beams at the very groggy looking

Isabella.

To the confusion of everyone around them, Kimberly and Thomas BURST

INTO CHEERS! They jump, dance and hug each other.

It's a magical moment --

EXT. EUGENE'S PRIVATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The RAT stops gnawing. The TV stops sparking. A wave of intense

relief washes over Eugene. He pantomimes reaching into his shirt

pocket and lighting a victory cigar.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Relaxed and invigorated, Kimberly and Thomas giddily exit the

delivery room as Clear runs up to them.

Steve watches, confused, as Clear whoops with delight and HUGS the

others.

Clear laughs with a relief that seems completely foreign to her.

Kimberly laughs with her, then is suddenly rocked by a vision --

HARD CUT TO:

UNKOWN POV

Looking up a the EEG machine. Flatlined!

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - BACK TO PRESENT

Kimberly, on the ground, looks frazzled as she SNAPS out of her

trance. Thomas helps her to her feet.

Her lips blue, Kimberly shivers uncontrollably. Clear sees TWO

SECURITY GUARDS round a distant corner and quickly walks the others

toward an EMERGENCY LOADING ZONE.

Kimberly reluctantly closes her eyes and remembers.

CUT TO:

PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN

Moment of the pile-up premonition. A WHITE VAN in fr ont of Kimberly

suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder.

Kimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an

accident.

BACK TO:

Kimberly, overcome with self- doubt.

Kimberly shuts her eyes, remembering:

EXT. LAKE - DAY

POV DRIVER

Grease-covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van

speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE!

The van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In

moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped.

Drowning. Horrible.

And on the rearview mirror, six floral scented AIR-FRESHNERS.

BACK TO:

Kimberly looks down at her grease -covered hands and looks ill.

Finally everything makes sense to Clear.

Kimberly trembles, refusing to accept what she's hearing.

Clear leaves Kimberly and Thomas together. Kimberly verges on tears

and Thomas consoles her with a hug.

IN THE BACKGROUND

Clear looks at passing room numbers while hurrying down the corridor.

She comes to a room with a HUGE CART parked outside, blocking the

door. She looks up to see - B -187.

Clear leans into it, pushing it out of the way of the door.

EUGENE'S ROOM

Eugene strains to hear through the thick door.

An intense wave of relief washes over Eugene.

BACK TO:

As Kimberly hugs Thomas, she watches Clear push the cart past the

door.

Kimberly spins as Eugene's Orderly passes her; a paper, pen and a

crossword book in one hand, A BIRTHDAY CAKE in the other.

The CAKE reads "Happy Birthday Gregory". The THIRTEEN SPARKLING

CANDLES on top ODDLY FRAME Clear's head.

The Orderly speeds down the corridor toward Clear, whose hand reaches

for Eugene's door handle. She leans into it --

THOMAS AND KIMBERLY

Watch as Clear opens the door, briefly revealing Eugene, a whoosh of

Oxygen --

BOOM!!!

Clear's body is obscenely hurled END OVER END towards the CAMERA,

heading straight for Kimberly and Thomas!

Thomas throws himself and Kimberly around the corner to prevent being

crushed by Clear's lifeless body!

The hospital erupts in total chaos. Just as Kimberly is about to

break down completely, she sees --

A WOMAN hurrying down the hallway in their direction, pushing a crash

cart.

Kimberly sees the nametag: KALARJIAN.

ANGLE ON CART

DEFRIBULATOR PADDLES rest on top. And then Dr. Kalarjian passes them

toward the area of the explosion.

KIMBERLY OMINOUSLY TURNS, the camera following her view, until she

sees a small lake across the street from the hospital.

Just then, an AMBULANCE SKIDS up to the nearest entrance. PARAMEDICS

jump out and run towards the blast site.

But Kimberly isn't listening. She stares through the glass doors at

the --

AMBULANCE

A red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white. Six

floral scented air-fresheners hang from the rearview. The 'van' from

her vision! And it's running!

Kimberly wipes tears from her eyes, kisses Thomas' cheek, then turns

and runs before he can speak.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly heads right for the open ambulance. The driver's door almost

seems to swing open for her as she gets in.

INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Thomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors, which

SPARK and short out. He struggles to pry them apart.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly shifts into gear and speeds off. Thomas squeezes through the

doors and runs after her. An EMT, the driver of the stolen ambulance,

rushes outside.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Thomas chases the ambulance, watching helplessly as it barrels over

curbs, pylons and a fence, ultimately plunging straight into the

lake!

Thomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can - the EMT trailing far

behind.

INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

Kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a

final gasp of air --

ON THE LAKE'S EDGE

Thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle

descends below the surface -- and he dives in!

UNDERWATER

Thomas swims into the dark, murky water. Deeper and deeper, he g ets

to the ambulance and tries to open the door. Stuck. He withdraws his

baton and BANGS on the glass - nothing!

He tries coming up for air, but his pants snag on the jagged metal of

the twisted bumper. He squirms frantically...

And as his exhausted body loses consciousness, everything --

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

BLACKNESS.

The SHOCK of defribulator paddles brings Kimberly back to life.

KIMBERLY'S POV

Looking up at Dr. Kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's

face and a partial nametage reading "Kalarjian".

It would appear as if she's choking Kimberly, but --

An EEG MONITOR turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same

POV as the premonition.

Kimberly turns her head to see

THOMAS

Unconscious, CPR being performed on him by the EMT (who's now soaking

wet). Thomas doesn't respond.

An INTERN opens an eyelid, points a flashlight at his eyes. Shakes

his head, nothing. The sopping wet EMT goes back to performing CPR.

Finally, Thomas coughs up water, chokes, gasps for air, then BOLTS

UPRIGHT.

He turns to see Kimberly reaching out for him. Immeasurably relieved,

he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the

platform. Kimberly's eyes fill with tears.

Outside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood

into the hospital. Its light covers Kimberly and Thomas with an

ethereal glow. There are no more doubts; they've won.

They exchange meek, yet triumphant smiles in the smoky, chaotic

hospital.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PARK - DAY

We are at a summer barbecue. Frisbee, lawn darts, croquet, et.

Everyone's happy.

TITLE CARD: FIVE MONTHS LATER

ANGLE ON

Shish -Kabob entering a mouth.

REVEAL

Kimberly taking a bite, relishing the taste and calmly pulling the

metal skewer from her mouth.

Thomas, out of uniform, takes a bite of his own. As the metal skewer

is deep in his mouth --

A running FRISBEE PLAYER accidentally bumps into Thomas! But no harm.

Thomas gives the guy a friendly pat and goes back to rewrapping his

mouth around the shish-kabob.

Kimberly turns red as Mr. Burroughs appears and takes a seat.

Mr. Gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food. His wife,

MRS. GIBBONS, joins.

It seems by now everyone's familiar with the concept.

Mrs. Gibbons makes a face, finding the discourse distasteful. She

changes the conversation.

A chorus of friendly laughter.

BRIAN enters frame, soaking up fresh laughter. He holds a plate full

of raw chicken fillets and some long, wooden matches.

Mr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera,

SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between

Kimberly and Thomas' heads.

Mr. Gibbons immediately regrets having said that.

Kimberly and Thomas ominously turn their heads around. In the BG,

Brian fidgets in front of the barbecue.

BOOM!!! The PROPANE TANK blows Brian to smithereens. A deafening

silence follows, punctuated when Brian's ARM lands on Mrs. Gibbons'

plate. PLOP.

FADE TO BLACK.

END CREDITS.
