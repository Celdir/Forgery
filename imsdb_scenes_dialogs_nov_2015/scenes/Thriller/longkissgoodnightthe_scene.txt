A WINDOWPANE

Assaulted from without by SNOWFLAKES. Wind tossed.

INSIDE, a bed, dappled with moon shadow. A LITTLE GIRL, fast

asleep. The wind whistles and sighs outside. She DREAMS...

Eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath... then suddenly they

SNAP open. A stifled cry. She thrashes for her STUFFED BEAR,

as a soft voice says:

And there's MOM, kneeling beside her. Vague shape in the

dimness. The full moon throws light across one sparkling

eye.

The mother nods. Passes her left hand gently over the girl's

forehead.

The child subsides, breathing steady. Eyes closed. The mother

rises. Regards her through the dimness. Slowly turns, heads

for the door. Flicks on a Winnie the Pooh NIGHTLIGHT --

Her entire right forearm is slicked with blood. More blood

on her Czech-made MP-5 machine gun.

She staggers just a little... barely noticeable. Passes out

on the light. Into darkness. Sits beside her daughter's bed.

The child sleeps peacefully. Outside snow slithers at the

glass.

FADE OUT. Pause. Blackness.

FADE IN:

It's snowing in southwestern Ohio. Before us, nestled in the

rolling hills: a postcard slice of suburbia. SUPER the legend:

Peaceful. Serene. It's the town in the glass bubble, the one

God shakes to watch it snow...

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

CHILDREN, dozens of them, bursting from houses. Slapping of

screen doors. A HORSE-DRIVEN SLEIGH is rattling down Main

Street. Flanked by kids. Christmas carols, droning from

loudspeakers.

HAPPY, LAUGHING SANTA waves howdy, chortling his "Ho's" in

groups of three, meanwhile he's really a grizzled old fire

marshall named EARL, freezing his nuts off.

Beside him sits MRS. CLAUS, about whom we notice two things:

First, she's the June in this June/December pair -- and

second, she's to kill for, an effortlessly beautiful woman.

For the record, meet SAMANTHA CAINE.

Santa produces a bottle of Seagrams. Starts to open it.

Earl complies, grumbling. Some teenage burnouts howl from a

street corner:

Samantha squirms in her seat, scowling.

Samantha stares at him.

SERIES OF SHOTS:

Throughout the following NARRATION, we watch Sam: 1) Rallying

the varsity CHEERLEADERS; 2) Showing off a GERBIL to her

seventh graders; 3) Kneeling in church with her HUSBAND,

blessing herself; 4) Absently fingering a silver KEY which

she wears round her neck; and finally 5) Probing at a tiny

ridged SCAR under her hairline.

EXT. SNOWY SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON

Samantha walks with her husband HAL. Late thirties. Balding.

Coming out of St. Paul's Episcopal Church.

She hugs him good-naturedly. As they near their house, an

eight year-old GIRL drops from a TREEHOUSE and comes running,

leaps into Mommy's arms --

The kid leaps into her arms, as we HEAR:

The family troops up the driveway to their SUBURBAN HOME.

Chipper little A-frame. Christmas lights abound. Behind the

house, a vast frozen POND. It is idyllic.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

PARTY in progress. Laughter. Mingling. In the corner, CAITLIN

puts pipe cleaner antlers on the gerbil. Samantha shepherds

her home room class past the punchbowl. She is radiant. EARL

surreptitiously nips from a silver flask.

ACROSS THE ROOM -- Her daughter CAITLIN hangs with two young

girls. Shows off a plush TEDDY BEAR, says:

GIRL #1 points, whispers excitedly:

Caitlin nods. Kid #2:

A voice interrupts their reverie:

The girls whirl around, startled -- Samantha is leaning on

the desk behind them. Busted. She smiles amiably:

The girls look at her like she's grown a tail.

A DOOR KICKED OPEN, WHAM-! Splintered. Lock shattered.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - AKRON, OHIO - NIGHT

A NUDE COUPLE on the bed. They look up, startled -- as three

men burst through the door. The LEADER: a haggard-looking

man sporting a soup-stain on his tie, whoops, that's the

design, sorry. MITCH HENESSEY, private investigator and con

man extraordinaire. He flashes a phony badge:

Donleavy looks pale, pasty. He stutters a few words. Loses

interest. Wanders away across the room.

Donleavy plops in a chair. Belches. Grins foolishly. The man

in bed points to him:

THE REMAINING COP is swaying on his feet. Like a tree in a

hurricane. Donleavy pukes all over the floor. We CUT TO:

INT. BARREN GREY OFFICE - NIGHT

THERE'S THE GIRL. The one in bed moments ago. She and Henessey

are dividing a wad of bills.

He indicates an envelope earmarked for him. Labeled in magic

marker: SAMANTHA CAINE.

Henessey opens the envelope. Extracts a black and white HEAD

SHOT of Samantha, says immediately:

Stares, mesmerized. Trin peers over his shoulder:

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

SAMANTHA and HAL bid goodnight to their friends and neighbors.

Hal steers her away from a middle-aged teacher.

She notices EARL sitting in the bushes by the side of the

building. He is speaking intently to the gerbil.

Samantha takes the keys from him. Breathes deeply of the

chill night air. Smiling. Surveys the scene... their friends.

The neighborhood. Sighs:

At which point, young Caitlin says:

ESTABLISHING SHOT - STATE PRISON - OHIO - NIGHTTIME

Switch gears: A grim, grey building. Guarded. Patrolled.

INT. PRISON - TELEVISION VIEWING ROOM - EVENING

A tired TV set drones to an audience of one. Let's call him

ONE-EYED JACK. In fact, let's give him one eye, the other

replaced by a PATCH. He smokes cigarettes, stubs them out on

the chair's armrest. Throws offhand glances at the TV screen.

The happy news chatter continues. Jack isn't listening. Jack

isn't talking or breathing either. He's simply STARING at

the TV screen, jaw slack...

He SCREAMS as we CUT TO:

EXT. WOODLANDS - WITH SAMANTHA - DRIVING

If you had to pick a night to die horribly, you'd be hard

pressed to find a nicer one. A country highway. Bathed in

moonlight. Crusted with snow. Pontiac Sunbird, wending its

way through the wooded slopes.

INT. SUNBIRD - SAME TIME

SAMANTHA drives while Earl (the SANTA we saw earlier)

reclines, still drunk.

He makes a thumb circle. Jabs his finger in and out of it:

He starts playing the Hawaiian nose harp. In Sam's ear, she

can't help it, snorts laughter --

THE ADULT DEER appears perfectly framed in the Sunbird's

headlights. Dead ahead. Sam looks up, face etched in sudden

TERROR. *No time to think*. SWERVES, no dice...! BROADSIDES

the animal --

And it comes THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. All two hundred and

fifteen pounds of it. Fucks up their night altogether.

Actually, it only makes it *halfway* through --

But the damn thing is ALIVE. More than alive. KICKING.

Thrashing. Squawling with pain and rage. A FLAILING HOOF

takes out Earl. Kills him in less than a second. Collapses

his skull.

Sam rides the wheel, screaming. An antler gouges her chest.

Rips. Draws blood. She SWERVES, madly -- Hits the tree doing

50.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sam goes airborne. Explodes through the windshield, outward

bound. Shower of glass, spritz of blood... And then she's

flying. Slow motion, end over end... We lose all SOUND.

Silence as she tumbles. Below and behind her, the Sunbird

noiselessly ERUPTS. Fireball, sky high --

Sam floating. Describes a lazy arc in mid-air... Whoomph-!

Disappears into the snow. Swallows her, leaves a silhouette.

Around her, trees catch fire. Burn. She lies in her impromptu

sarcophagus. Out of sight.

THE FLAMING DEER totters from the wreck, thrashing. Scene

from a nightmare. Nightmare part two: from the snow, from

the human-shaped divot -- arises a woman of blood.

She stumbles from the drift. Toward the wreck. And though

it's clearly Sam Caine under all that crimson, there's

something wrong about her *eyes*.

En route to the car, she kneels beside the suffering deer,

its flesh scorched and torn -- and KILLS it. Puts it away

with a sharp CRACK-!ing blow to the head. Stands, eyes

squirming with madness...

The car's an inferno. Earl is dead. She turns away, wiping

blood from her eyes -- Comes face to face with a SNOWMAN.

A jolly white fellow. Charcoal briquettes for eyes. She

watches, fascinated, as he MELTS in the blast furnace heat --

With warning, she *screams*. Crumples to the ground.

The snowman's eyes fall out. He melts away and away...

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - AKRON, OHIO - TWILIGHT

Elsewhere. Tract housing, late-model cars. MITCH HENESSEY

delivers a Christmas gift to his nine year-old son TODD: not

just any gift, the *Midtown Saturn Orbiting Precinct*, with

action figures. Henessey points to the box, engrossed:

VOICE interrupts them:

An awkward pause. Henessey scowls.

Henessey manages to control his face. Says tightly:

He watches, forlorn, as his son vanishes inside the house.

Christmas lights, blinking feebly. We HEAR, supered:

As he reaches his car, his BEEPER goes off.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - MINUTES LATER

Henessey on the phone. Dials. Waits. We HEAR:

The phone picks up. He says:

INT. SAMANTHA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - TWO DAYS LATER

Samantha, having survived. Laid up now in an austere hospital

room. Listening to silence. Stares out the window at a sunlit

tree. Head bandaged. Frowns:

Outside, snow slithers... Her eyelids, slowly closing. Slides

off the edge of consciousness...

IN THE DREAM: She stands on a windswept cliff, before an

incongruous FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. Staring at her reflection --

it's bleeding from a scalp wound.

She probes her head... frowns. Nothing. Nothing but the tiny

RIDGED SCAR she's had for as long as she can remember.

The reflection eyes her grimly. Haggard. Tired.

Samantha is suddenly holding a cigarette. She raises it to

her lips. Her reflection MIRRORS her precisely. Except

Samantha COUGHS, chokes on the smoke -- While her bloody

reflection takes a long, satisfying drag.

They are now in perfect synchronicity. Sam inhales easily.

The reflection grins. There's blood on its TEETH.

INT. SAMANTHA'S HOME - DAY

Back at home, business as usual, pre-Christmas. A COMMOTION

has arisen: Gingerly, bones still aching, Samantha moves

toward the KITCHEN. HAL and CAITLIN trail behind.

INT. KITCHEN/GARAGE - SAME

Hal worriedly exits to the garage. Plucks a tomato from the

fridge, tosses it to Caitlin, who stands in the door.

Caitlin turns, tosses it to Sam --

Who catches it, plops it on the cutting board and proceeds

to DICE it to SIMTHEREENS. Razor-thin slices. Knife a blur.

Missing her fingers by millimeters, never faltering, like a

mad mumblety-pegger --

Sam catches it. Knife flurries. Pieces, flying up.

And it becomes a bucket brigade. Hal heaves veggies to Caitlin

who spins and relays to Mom who slices, dices, purees, and

even makes curly fries. Veggies, incoming. HAL starts to

lose it, starts lobbing them at Caitlin, one after another,

she giggles, starts throwing them overhand --

And now it's a food fight, PELTING Mom, and the floor is

COVERED with food as Hal stumbles in laughing, scoops up

Caitlin --

Samantha shakes her head, grinning, dices to pieces a last,

lovely radish. Ends with a flourish, TA-DAH-! Doesn't think:

Flips the knife point up on ONE FINGER. Tips it for balance.

Lobs a tomato. Slings the knife without looking, pins it to

the wall, KA-CHUK--!

Everyone goes silent. The knife, quivering. Caitlin and Hal

turn as one, gaping at her. She shrugs numbly. Blinks.

INT. BOILER ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT, IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL

Underground. Water GURGLES through overhead pipes. Furnaces

hum and tick in the sweaty gloom.

A SHIRTLESS MAN is tied to a chair. Weeping. Before him,

what looks like a young GQ model. Blonde. Gorgeous. Impeccably

attired. For the record, TIMOTHY. He looks his captive in

the eye as the guy blubbers:

Timothy stares him full in the face, eyes narrowed... as

though seeing into his brain. He nods, satisfied.

He slams home the knife. We don't see it, but we FEEL the

impact. The FBI man's face contorts in SHOCK. Twisted. Inches

away from Timothy, their eyes lock...

A CELLULAR PHONE BEEPS. Timothy reacts, annoyed. Plucks it

from his belt and flips it open:

He shrugs at his captive. Rolls his eyes. The guy's still

dying, still on the KNIFE.

Timothy is silent.

He clicks off, face troubled. Withdraws the knife. Checks

his clothing. Not one speck of blood.

INT. SUPERMARKET - CHECKOUT STAND - AFTERNOON

A CARTON OF MARLBORO REDS hits the stack of groceries. HAL

looks at his wife, bewildered.

At the next register over, a duo of Canadians throw looks

her way. Confer in rapid-fire French, subtitled for us:

The checker looks up, smiles:

He turns to Samantha -- except Sam isn't there. Her arm shoots

out-! CLAMPS on one of the men. By the throat. Catches him

like a fucking VICE. Her voice a sibilant hiss:

Subtitle: "Gumby's gonna stretch your neck, motherfucker."

Accent flawless. Eyes like steel. The man will go on to start

a profitable construction business with the bricks he shits.

SAMANTHA - ON THE PHONE TO HER SHRINK - INTERCUT

Jubilant, can't contain herself:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Samantha and daughter CAITLIN sing a hearty chorus of "Frere

Jaques." Sam giggles , Caitlin looks nervous; astride her

new two-wheeler BICYCLE while Sam finishes removing the

training wheels. Caitlin points to her stuffed TEDDY BEAR.

Samantha sets her sailing. Laughs excitedly. The bike weaves,

side to side... hits the curb and topples with a CRASH. Spills

Caitlin to the pavement. Now's she's CRYING.

Samantha walks over briskly. Face set in determined lines.

An unpleasant note is edging into her voice. The louder the

kid cries, the more Samantha starts to SIMMER.

She hoists her onto the seat. Caitlin cries and hollers.

*Snap*. Something lets go. Suddenly Samantha's right in her

face:

Eyes cold and lifeless. She is not herself. CUT TO:

INT. SAMANTHA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

CAITLIN huddles on the steps, itching at her brand new WRIST

CAST. Eavesdropping on her parents. In the kitchen a counter-

top TV is on, the Three Stooges. Samantha is on the phone,

saying:

She hangs up as HAL ENTERS behind her... She doesn't turn

around. Samples the topping of a cream pie. Stares at the

linoleum floor. He regards her with angry, vindictive eyes:

Hal takes a breath, composes himself.

Sam surveys her perfect kitchen. Runs her hand over a hanging

pot. Looks sadly at her husband. Whispers:

They stand in tableau. An electric silence... Broken quite

suddenly by the sound of SINGING. CHRISTMAS CAROLERS. Outside

the front door. The sweet strains of "God Rest Ye Merry,

Gentlemen" wafts in through the window.

Except the sweet strains ain't so sweet. These carolers are

TERRIBLE. Missing by a country octave. Sam and Hal look at

each other, what the hell...?

EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR - NIGHT

THE CAROLERS continue their interesting rendition. Snowflakes

fall. All is quiet. All is bright. Especially bright is the

SHOTGUN BARREL pressed to the throat of the lead soprano. HE-

109. Over and under combo. Shotgun on top. HE cannon on

bottom. You'd sing shitty too.

INT. HOUSE - SAME

Samantha hurries to the door. Carrying a bowl of festive

M&M's. Just as she gets to the door, the singing STOPS.

Footfalls running away, that's odd... She opens the door.

Carolers, gone. She's eye to eye with ONE-EYED JACK.

He swings the big GUN. Slams the barrel into her. Glass

shatters, M&M's everywhere. She gapes at him, dumbstruck,

unable to THINK... Hurry it up, lady, we need a decision,

live or *die* --

SHE GRABS THE GUN BARREL. Wrenches the gun...! On the steps

CAITLIN howls, eyes like saucers --

Sam's cry is a veritable shriek. HAL LAUNCHES himself from

the kitchen doorway. Pounces on Jack, snarling -- brave,

useless. For his trouble, gets three broken ribs and a trip

to the fireplace, airborne. Comes down. Catches fire. ROLLS,

over and over on broken ribs --

JACK kicks Samantha in the gut. She collapses onto the stairs.

Splinters the banister. That's when he sees CAITLIN. Top of

the stairs, paralyzed.

Jack is already moving forward. SPIN-COCKS the shotgun, draws

a bead -- Promptly slips on festive M&M's. Goes down. Gun

goes off, WHAM-! A flat concussion. The banister EXPLODES. A

storm of wood chips, as SAMANTHA surges up the stairs, toward

her daughter --

JACK. On the ground. Fires, *wham*--! The wall DISAPPEARS

three inches from Caitlin's head. Blown to shreds, you can

see outdoors. Samantha doesn't miss a beat. Grabs her daughter --

flings her OUTSIDE. Through the hole in the wall. Takes her

by the belt and fucking HURLS her out into space...!

EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - SAME TIME

Two stories up. The kid is ejected, flailing. Floats in SLOW

MOTION. Across a ten foot gap -- INTO THE TREEHOUSE. Sails

head over heels into the place. Hits with a CRASH. Alive and

unhurt.

BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE

Samantha didn't even look. Didn't need to. Here comes JACK.

Up the staircase. Reloading. Samantha launches herself down

the stairs. COLLIDES, head on -- Down they go. Jack, rolls

to his feet. Propels her into the KITCHEN.

INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

She hits, spray of cat food. SKIDS. Across the linoleum,

slams to a stop. Hard. Cupboard pops open, out comes the

IRONING BOARD. Falls into place, SNAP--!

A GUN BLAST disintegrates it. Reveals Sam, cowering behind.

Samantha struggles to her feet. Dazed. Jack abandons the

shotgun. Takes the IRON down from its spot on the shelf --

Slams it against her head.

CLOSE ON TV: Stooge Joe Besser mugs wildly, takes a pie in

the face.

Jack raises his arm for the killing stroke -- Samantha takes

Hal's cream pie from the counter and shatters every bone in

his face.

Comes from nowhere. Back foot planted, body twisting, entire

organism focused into the outstretched arm, WHACK-! We have

never seen anyone move this fast. Samantha RECOILS. Startled

by what she's done --

The glass dish is SPLINTERED into his head. It STICKS there.

He topples. Hits the linoleum. She straddles him, breathing

hard. Winded.

The barking dog "Jingle Bells" plays inanely in the

background. Samantha stares. Trembling. Pokes the body.

Nothing. Pokes it again. Still nothing. She leans forward.

Grips the neck and wrenches, CRACK-! Just making sure.

She out of it. In shock. Glaring at her own hands as if

demanding an excuse for their behavior. There is pie filling

on her fingers. She kneels beside the corpse, catatonic.

Stares. Absent-mindedly licks the bloodied cream.

HAL is standing in the doorway. Wide-eyed. He has seen

Samantha break the man's neck. She looks at him, frowns.

He stares, dumbstruck. She blinks. *Snaps out of it*.

She gets up. We RUN with her to the front door -- she flings

it open and collides with MITCHELL HENESSEY. Private dick.

Runs right into him.

Henessey spins, as FOUR POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Vomit up a

bevy of COPS, swarming toward the house. He spins back to

Samantha -- As she collapses to the floor.

Pause. FADE IN. Super the legend: ONE WEEK LATER.

ESTABLISHING - SAMANTHA'S HOUSE - MORNING

Early morning quiet. HENESSEY and SAMANTHA are throwing

suitcases into the back of his battered Chrysler.

INT. HOUSE - LATER - EVERYTHING'S PACKED

Sam's looked better. Kneels beside Caitlin, says softly:

Caitlin looks at the floor. Doesn't respond. Samantha reaches

in a cupboard. Produces a box of CANDLES. Lights a match,

touches flame to one of them.

She touches Caitlin's wrist cast. Pain in her features. She

grabs a marker pen and writes a TELEPHONE NUMBER on it.

She reaches behind her head. Unhooks the KEY, the one she

wears around her neck.

Slips it over her daughter's head. Looks up at HAL, eyes

brimming. He whispers:

SERIES OF SHOTS: EXT. SUBURBAN TOWN

As it fades behind Henessey's Chrysler. Leaving behind porch-

bound elders, dimestore clerks. Grinning children, hair like

spun straw. All fading... DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HENESSEY'S PLYMOUTH - THE OPEN ROAD - DAY

Henessey sings with the radio. Loudly. He's got the lyrics

wrong: "I'm not talking 'bout the linen... And I don't wanna

change your life..."

Samantha endures as much as she can. Speaks up:

EXT. STORAGE RENTAL PLACE - DAY

As they clamber from the car, Henessey shoves his sunglasses

into his sportcoat. SINGS:

Samantha looks at him like he's sprouted wings.

Samantha smiles thinly. The man's a lunatic.

INT. STORAGE FACILITY - DAY

An old, walrus-mustached IRISHMAN ushers them down a concrete

hallway. The old man hangs back with Henessey. Whispers:

Henessey lights a cigarette, says:

INT. STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Drab, musty. Filled with disused tables, lamps, farm

implements... Jimmy Hoffa watches TV in the corner.

She pauses. Surveys the musty compartment, faraway look in

her eye... says softly:

She hefts a SUITCASE onto a bench. OPENS it -- Draws a sharp

breath:

Clothes to kill for. Smooth velvet. Creamy silk. The finest,

the best. The sexiest. Sam peeks at the tags:

She checks the case for INITIALS -- C.E.B. Who...?

Henessey grunts. In his book, well dressed is clean underwear.

Holds up a small manila envelope.

Meanwhile, her hands, still pawing through the suitcase... A

SHAPE. She feels it. At the bottom of the case. Lifts up the

mound of fabric -- HKM-40 sniper rifle. Disassembled. Sam

looks like she just took a stomach punch.

Up until now, it could've been adrenaline. She could still

be just a schoolteacher. A rifle, that changes everything.

She plunks the clothing back in place. Hides it.

He holds up the envelope: addresses to one *Nathan Windeman*.

Fishes in his coat, brings out Samantha's CHECK. Written to

him, earlier that day... identical handwriting. CUT TO:

INT. COLONIAL STYLE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

NATHAN WINDEMAN is in a bad mood. A frail-looking man, mid-

seventies. Tiredly spooning a bowl of soup. His sister ALICE

watches TV nearby. In her lap, a Pomeranian cleans itself.

Windeman scowls:

Alice stares at him. Uncomprehending.

Theatrical? Nah. The old bat scoops up her pooch and beats

feet for the door. THE PHONE RINGS. Nathan snatches it up:

The voice is soft. Controlled:

Nathan pales. Blinks once. Twice. Manages:

A pause. Then:

He chews his lower lip, mind racing. Jesus, no joke, this is

*her*... He fights to control his voice:

INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - SAME TIME

A MAN in shirtsleeves flips a switch. Speaks into a headset:

INT. HOUSE - BACK WITH NATHAN

She hangs up. Nathan stares, trembling. Turns to ALICE,

standing in the doorway. Swallows hard, says:

INT. RESTAURANT BATHROOM - WITH CHARLY

She hangs up the telephone in the ladies' room. Stands, alone

in the stillness. Hands to her head, mind churning...

Turns, checks to make sure the door is locked. Props her

SUITCASE on the sink and opens it. Flips back the mound of

clothing --

And there it is. The pieces, disassembled, of an M-40 sniper

rifle. Her trembling hands find the parts, seemingly of their

own volition... Hefting them. Gauging their feel. And then,

slowly... terrifyingly...

Knowing how they go together. She SNAPS the barrel in place,

*click*-! The sound breaks her reverie. She drops the thing

like it's alive. Looks down, trembling...

ALSO in the case: a wicked looking HUNTING KNIFE. She picks

it up gingerly. Shiny, brand new. Turns it over in her hand,

fascinated by the play of light off the blade...

Looks up. Her REFLECTION, in the mirror. Staring back. She

frowns -- It frowns. She turns away --

THE REFLECTION DOESN'T. It stays right fucking put, except

now it's *smiling*. Malignant. Deadly. Sam feels something

wrong. Spins back toward the mirror --

Her reflected arm comes through the looking glass. Reaches

into Sam's world and SLICES FOR HER THROAT.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DRIVING - LATE AFTERNOON

Samantha JERKS, comes awake in the passenger seat of

Henessey's Plymouth. Bad dream. Looks over to see if he

noticed -- he's honking his horn at a TRAFFIC JAM. Sea of

taillights, dead ahead.

Just then, THREE POLICE CRUISERS blow by, sirens screaming.

Henessey frowns, puzzled.

He switches on a police band radio. Listens, hears:

EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - CONNEAUT LAKE, PA. - SAME

POLICE FLASHERS, spinning. Cop cars, incoming. SLAMMING to a

halt. Disgorging uniformed cops. THE DINER is rapidly

surrounded. Its a cheery decor, the giant roofbound Santa,

all in stark contrast -- To the SCREAMING we hear, dimly,

from within.

INT. DINER - SAME

Hostage drama, unfolding. The perp's a big ugly meatloaf

with his mitts on a waitress. She's sixteen, she's a baby.

She's sucking the barrel of his shotgun. His finger on the

trigger. From outside, we hear the COPS:

Mr. Shotgun snorts laughter. Does a little dance, yells:

EXT. DINER - SAME TIME

The police are just starting to re-route traffic. A highway

cop signals to HENESSEY, "Turn around, go back."

INT. CAR - SAME TIME

Henessey swears. Swings wide, when suddenly a HAND clutches

his arm. He looks over and suppresses a shiver -- Samantha's

eyes have gone dead and cold. She lights a cigarette, shakes

out the match and says:

Now Henessey shivers. Cranks the wheel as we CUT TO:

EXT. HILLTOP - OVERLOOKING TOWN - NIGHT

SAMANTHA flops on the frozen ground in a stand of pine trees.

No answer. She deftly assembles the SNIPER RIFLE. Rests the

rifle barrel on a dead branch. Flicks on the starlight scope.

She ignores him. Focuses through the scope. POV SAMANTHA:

Framed in spectral GREEN, the diner's interior. Hostages.

Crying mothers. Children, catatonic.

Through a tiny window -- a limited view of the KITCHEN. He's

in there. Girl, eating both barrels. Samantha's jaw tightens.

Mr. Shotgun leans in. WHISPERS something to the waitress.

She steadies the rifle. Takes aim.

She fires. Splintered CRACK-!

INT. DINER

Mr. Shotgun dies on his feet. Outgoing matter. Flung.

Spattered on the grill where it sizzles along with burnt

hamburger. He drops. Screams. Pandemonium.

EXT. HILLTOP - MOMENTS LATER

Samantha slams the trunk of the Chrysler. Gets in the

passenger side without a word. Henessey pulls away.

INT. CAR - DRIVING - SAME

Samantha stares straight ahead. Gives a high, brittle laugh.

She laughs again. Henessey favors her with a look reserved

for people with major deformities. Suddenly she says:

He stops the car. She gets out. Stumbles across the shoulder.

Kneels. Throws up. Henessey watches. Lights a smoke with

trembling hands.

Henessey kneels beside her awkwardly. She clutches his

shoulder. Presses her head to his chest. Cries.

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

Yes, it certainly is. CUT TO:

INT. SITUATION BRIEFING ROOM - SAME TIME

Three stories below the White House proper. THE PRESIDENT is

seated in his robe and slippers. Before him sits a panel of

three: National Security Adviser; Deputy Director of the

CIA; and ANOTHER MAN in his sixties, sporting a distinguished

mane of silver hair. The President addresses him:

The silver-haired man appears unperturbed. And no, by the

way, it didn't escape us that he shares his surname with

Caitlin's TEDDY BEAR, the one Mom named -- He nods, says:

The head of the CIA pipes up:

He directs his baleful gaze at the President. Lights a pipe.

INT. ROADSIDE GAS STATION - NIGHTTIME

Henessey is on the phone to his ex-wife. Glowering.

For a moment her ignorance is so stunning he's speechless.

Then he slams down the phone. Cracks it. Returns to the pumps,

where SAMANTHA leans against his car, still dazed. Looks up

at him, says:

Henessey doesn't look at her. Puts the nozzle back in the

pump. Crosses to the driver side without a word.

He gets into the car. Starts the engine. Samantha reacts,

distraught. Leans in, kills the ignition. Pulls him out of

the car.

She slaps him. HARD. He falls back, stunned.

He serious. Samantha frowns, a little thrown -- Then she

snorts, loses it. They both lean against his Chrysler.

He smiles ruefully. Spits. A pause, then:

Samantha's voice is cool and level:

She blows her nose.

ESTABLISHING - SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - MORNING

A gunmetal grey sky looms overhead. The aforementioned LOUNGE

is a faded old roadhouse, gravel parking lot strewn with mud-

covered trucks. The kind that get a man laid in these parts.

HENESSEY'S PLYMOUTH pulls into the lot, rolls to a halt.

He'll never get any.

INT. SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - DAY

Honky-tonk. SAMANTHA and HENESSEY enter, blinking in the

dimness. Around them, drunk mid-day cowboys. Stringy-haired

girls in their ample laps. SAMANTHA consults her watch:

They sit at the counter. Henessey flags the bartender. Signals

for a beer. Lights a cigarette, blows smoke:

Samantha shoots him a look. ON A TV above the bar, a British-

sounding CNN announcer is saying:

Samantha sits up straight. Draws a sharp breath. He shoots

her a questioning look --

She rubs her eyes. Her voice breaks. She's utterly miserable.

Henessey leans in, says softly:

He pats her arm. Smiles reassuringly. A pause. She stares.

He stands, heads off. Samantha nervously lights a cigarette.

The bartender suddenly puts a BEER in front of her. She

reaches for her purse. He waves it away, points beside her.

She turns...

The assassin called TIMOTHY sits down two stools away.

He reveals a surprisingly WINNING smile, says:

Grimaces:

Still staring in her eyes. Noting absolutely NO RECOGNITION

on her features. She gives him a cursory smile.

Timothy nods slowly.

He takes his own drink and crosses to a back booth. Sits, a

very puzzled look on his face. Adjusts his coat collar,

whispers into a concealed transmitter:

He sits back as TWO SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES suddenly enter, doffing

their stetsons. Cross to the bar. HENESSEY, coming out of

the bathroom. Sees the deputies. Grabs SAMANTHA by the elbow.

Tosses down a fin, steers her toward the door.

EXT. SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - SAME TIME

They emerge into the chill air. Breath pluming from their

mouths. Samantha surveys the parking lot. Grabs Henessey,

points --

A LATE-MODEL CAR pulls into the gravel lot. Stops.

They cross toward the car. She frowns, points to his coat.

As they approach the other car, the engine stops. The door

opens and a middle aged man emerges -- IT AIN'T NATHAN. He

pauses, lighting a cigarette.

She strides right up, Henessey in tow. Flashes a dazzling

smile -- *Slow motion*. The guy DROPS HIS LIGHTER, darts a

hand inside his coat with practiced ease... Pulls out a

SILENCED PISTOL.

*Slow motion*. Samantha tackles Henessey. Hurls them both to

the ground... During their fall, STUFF HAPPENS:

She clutches his sportcoat -- Grips his .38 special THROUGH

THE FABRIC and squeezes... A sharp report, BAM-! Another,

BAM-! The jacket, shredded. HITMAN just caught two in the

chest. He goes over backwards, gun spitting --

Sam and Henessey hit the ground. *Back to regular speed*.

Henessey rolls over, stunned. Samantha's staring at her hand,

wondering how in the hell it just did that.

They scamper to their feet. Running hellbent for leather

toward the Plymouth... They never make it.

ANOTHER HITMAN steps calmly from the trees. Stands at the

shoulder of the highway, full view of the parking lot...

Adopts a two-fisted stance. Draws a bead, locks on target --

Leaves his feet.

Takes to the air as a BLACK LE SABRE swerves off the highway

with no advance warning and DEMOLISHES the bastard, wham--!

The car roars across the lot, NATHAN WINDEMAN at the wheel.

INT. BARROOM - SAME TIME

The snapped-in-two hitman announces Nathan's arrival by FLYING

THROUGH THE WINDOW in an explosion of glass. Caroms off a

table and bounces head over heels. Hits, dead.

TIMOTHY swears. Leaps up and bolts for the door, right behind

the SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES, as

EXT. BUILDING - SAME TIME

The black Le Sabre SLEWS to a stop, showering gravel -- NATHAN

shouts at Sam and Henessey:

They pile into the backseat. Nathan floors it. PEELS OUT,

bouncing  onto the highway -- and meanwhile here comes

TIMOTHY. On the run. Barks into his transmitter:

He begins to run: we have never seen anyone run this fast.

INT. NATHAN'S CAR - DRIVING

NATHAN kicks in the afterburners. Squinting, can't see...

WIPERS, squeaking to and fro. Erasing the hitman's blood.

Henessey is trembling; Samantha comatose. Nathan steals a

look in the rear view mirror. Gets his first good view of

Samantha. Reacts, stunned:

This is not what she expected to hear.

50 yards down the highway. Beside a parked car, a guy with

an ELEPHANT GUN.

The big rifle BUCKS concussively. The car window SPLINTERS...!

Does not break.

Almost as an afterthought, he swerves slightly. CRUNCHES the

gunman against the parked car. Shatters him. His SCREAMING

VISAGE goes by an inch from Samantha, he coughs blood onto

her window...

EXT. FROZEN WOODSCAPE - SAME TIME

Timothy, on the move. RUNS, breakneck through the woods.

Jumps fallen logs. Ducking, swerving. In and out through the

trees, as

INT. NATHAN'S CAR - DRIVING

Scenery whips past. In the backseat, Henessey is trembling;

Samantha comatose. Nathan snaps his fingers sharply:

Samantha reacts, floored.

Henessey is so shocked he's LAUGHING:

EXT. SHEER EMBANKMENT - OVERLOOKING HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

A forty foot embankment, damn near vertical. Plunging to the

road below. Topped by a chain-link FENCE.

Timothy hits the fence at a dead run. Up and over. Pitches

head over heels down the embankment, BOUNCING. Hits bottom

in a shower of dirt, rolls, comes up... .357 AMP in a two-

fisted grip, and *there's Nathan's car*. Blows by, doing 90.

Timothy swivels calmly, BLASTS AN ENTIRE CLIP at the

retreating car. Shot after shot, like a machine --

INT. NATHAN'S CAR - SAME TIME

Sam SCREAMS as the side windows COLLAPSE INWARD. Nathan rides

the wheel, swerving.

BACK WITH TIMOTHY

Watching them go. Oh, well. He tried, right...? Did his best,

tomorrow's another day --

Without missing a beat, Timothy walks out in the middle of

the road. ANOTHER CAR, coming. Sports car. He snaps in a

fresh clip. Raises his fist and PUMPS ONE through the fast-

approaching windshield. Kills the driver.

The car throws a skid. Slewing SIDEWAYS at him. Onrushing

juggernaut, immense...!

He vaults the hood without breaking stride. Catches the drive-

side doorhandle, jerks -- then he's in, and out comes the

corpse and the car *never stops moving*.

Completes an out-of-control 360, showering muddy water...

and then he's stomping the gas. Utterly relentless. Leaving

behind a wet and very surprised-looking corpse.

INT. STOLEN CAR

Timothy GUNS IT, eyes locked dead ahead on the Le Sabre --

Hears a SCREECH. Whips his eyes to the rearview mirror: POLICE

CRUISER. Fishtailing onto the road behind him. Falls in

behind, SIREN wailing. One of the deputies from the bar.

INT. NATHAN'S CAR - DRIVING - SAME TIME

Nathan fishes a gun from his coat. Hands it to Samantha.

Henessey looks out the back windshield, says:

Nathan looks, SWEARS. The chase car's gaining on them.

He accelerates into a curve. Rockets past a connecting road,

as, without warning -- ANOTHER COP CAR skids out of the side

road, after him. The other deputy...

TIMOTHY, boxed. Going too fast, swerves...! PLOWS into the

deputy headlong. BROADSIDES him. Glass flies. The cop car's

TIRES blow out as it's SPUN 180 degrees... Timothy's car

careens into a GULLEY --

BAM-! Hits a dead stop. Hood shears off, goes flying. Back

end sticking up, tires spinning... The horn blares

continuously.

UP ABOVE: The other cop arrives, brakes to a halt -- Door

opens and out he comes. Helps Deputy #2 clamber from his

crippled black-and-white.

Together they leap down into the gulley, guns drawn. Cringing

as the long HOOOOOOOONNNNNK continues unabated. Approaching

the crashed car. Walking up, guns at their sides... TWO SHOTS.

They jitter and twitch. Topple over dead, slide to the bottom

of the gulley.

INSIDE THE CAR, we see that a very annoyed Timothy is also

very conscious. Splayed against the driver's side door.

Holding one hand down on the horn, HOOOOOOOONNK... He releases

it. Horn stops. On the radio Conway Twitty is singing. He

puts a shot through the radio. Silences it.

Climbs from the car and stares off down the road. Of Nathan

and his companions, there is neither whisper nor breath...

EXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

Nathan has pulled over in a grove of pine trees. The car is

covered with branches. He watches through a gap as two police

cars go by on the distant highway.

Charly is overloaded. Trying to keep up, not wanting to:

IN SAMANTHA'S LAP

Her fingers unconsciously fiddle with something. Damp,

crumpled. The ENVELOPE. One address left.

Henessey stares at her. As Nathan reaches for the envelope,

his coat falls open and Samantha GASPS; his left side is

soaked with blood.

EXT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY - DAY

The house is actually an old converted MILL. Beyond it, frozen

landscape stretches to the lakeshore. In the BARNYARD, a

scruffy looking COWBOY TYPE is splitting logs on a tree stump.

Drops the axe. Scoops up an armload of firewood. Comes around

the corner --

Drops the logs, startled. AN UNLIKELY TRIO approaches. NATHAN,

sweating. Pasty. Levels a revolver. Samantha says:

Seeing her, his eyes go wide -- He locks her in a whooping

BEAR HUG, shouts:

Picks her up, SPINS HER around, laughing... Henessey and

Nathan stare. Befuddled.

TIME CUT - MINUTES LATER

The strange man (let's call him LUKE) stands awkwardly in

the dooryard. Shifting from foot to foot. NATHAN watches him

dispassionately from the tree stump. Gun on his knee.

The DOOR bangs open and Samantha comes out of the house.

Carrying bandages. Alcohol. Crosses to the tree stump, kneels

before Nathan. His voice is a harsh rasp:

He bats her away, administers his own first aid. LUKE pipes

up, exasperated:

He chuckles. Looks at her face. Stops chuckling, takes a

sudden interest in the ground. Sam crosses to HENESSEY,

standing nearby. Takes him aside, whispers:

She studies Luke. Frowning. Concentrating.

Just then NATHAN is hit with a dreadful-sounding cough. It

wracks him. Doubles him up. LUKE blurts out:

Nathan grits his teeth:

Nathan presses a bandage to his side.

He pitches forward into Henessey's arms.

EXT. SHADED PORCH - MID-AFTERNOON

Beside the lakeshore LUKE AND SAMANTHA walk side by side.

RACK FOCUS to the porch: NATHAN is laid out on a chaise

lounge. Henessey beside him, applying cold compresses. The

older man stirs, coming awake... Tries to sit up, Henessey

nudges him flat again.

Nathan groans. Henessey presses a cloth to the man's head.

Nathan swallows. Grimaces. Lies back down.

Busted. Nathan coughs. Speaks, eyes faraway:

At which point, Henessey stops. Frowns.

He scuffs his shoe in the porch dust. Eyes narrowed:

His eyes widen:

Points to the lake:

Nathan freezes, thoughts racing... swears violently:

He takes off for the lake at a dead run. Behind him, the

bloodied Nathan DRAGS himself to his feet and lurches off

the porch, stumbling. Weaving. Refusing to go down.

AT THE LAKESIDE -- Luke walks behind Samantha. Talking softly

in her ear, smiling... She hears something. A RATCHETING

noise, drawing closer, hmmm...? Looks up. Wishes she hadn't --

A BELL RANGER HELICOPTER is descending over the lake. Inside,

TIMOTHY shoulders a bolt action rifle, coolly professional.

FIRES, kicks up dirt at Henessey's feet. Stops the fucker

cold. On the shore, LUKE smiles at Samantha, says:

SLUGS HER IN THE FACE. Drops her to the ice like a broken

doll.

Black indeed. Deep. Empty. Out of the darkness, we hear a

NEWS COMMENTATOR. Voice scratchy. Indistinct. Far away or

long ago...

A TELEVISION IMAGE fills the screen. Black and white. Grainy.

The legend: BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND, over footage of a

sidewalk bombing. We're back in time, the year 1971. A crisp-

looking BRIGADIER is speaking to the off-camera reporter:

An ANNOUNCER's face replaces him:

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A battered TV, volume turned low. Snoozing in a chair, a

rumpled older man -- It's the BRIGADIER, the one we just saw

speaking on TV. A CALENDAR on the table identifies the date

as June 23, 1971.

IN THE NEXT ROOM

Girlish decor. Pinups of rock stars. A YOUNG GIRL is awake,

dressed and currently stuffing two pillows under a blanket.

She inspects her handiwork. Human-looking lump. Turns,

satisfied.

One last look at the WOODEN JESUS on the wall -- Creeps from

the room. Past the sleeping Brigadier. To the front door.

She checks over her shoulder, nervous. Taps out five digits.

Shuts off the alarm. Unlocks the door and slips out.

EXT. STREET - BELFAST - NIGHT

The boy's name is GREGORY. Sixteen, with a quick, easy grin.

Huddled beneath a tree with him, the girl is gelatin.

He slides a hand under her sweater. She stiffens, terrified

and exhilarated, as he gently strokes her nipple with a thumb.

He leans in. She leans forward. A jerky, tentative duckling

on the road to swan-dom. Their lips touch.

Across the road, THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT in her father's flat.

She spins, scream caught in her throat -- as ARMED MEN rush

from the house. Through the door, the one she left unlocked.

Stutter of SMALL ARMS FIRE. She whirls on Gregory, realizes

only then that the guy is LAUGHING.

He slaps her full across the face.

He spins and flees.

INT. BRIGADIER'S FLAT - MOMENTS LATER

Girl, moving. Walls racing past, shot to PIECES, run run run

into her bedroom and LURCHES to a stop, screaming:

Propped against the wall. By the bed. He's still alive.

Incredibly. The man has DRAGGED himself in here. He refused

to die, simply couldn't, you see... Not until he reached his

daughter.

ANGLE ON BED

Two pillows, jammed beneath a blanket. The Brigadier just

stares at them. His face slack. White and gastly. Shifts his

gaze to his daughter. Tears running from his dulled eyes.

He raises the pistol to his head.

He fires. On a young girl's dissolve into insanity we FADE

OUT... Sound, echoing away. Blackness, total.

FADE IN:

INT. BASEMENT OF OLD MILL - NIGHT

Waking is slow.

Samantha opens her eyes. Blinks. Hazy, out of focus. Tries

to rub her eyes, can't. Hands. Something's wrong, what the

hell'd she do with her hands...? Ah. They're stretched over

her head. BOUND WITH CORD. Suddenly she's very awake.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The basement of the old converted mill. A drafty, windswept

place full of old, broken timbers. A river runs through it.

A stream, at any rate. The waters are still and frozen now.

Above the stream -- A GREAT WOODEN WHEEL. Smaller corollary

of the wheel outside. Mounted on the same axis.

SAMANTHA is tied to that wheel. Lashed to its SIDE, affixed

to it like a goddess to a Greek sailing ship. Now the bad

news, the ice has been chopped away so the wheel can TURN...

And it will plunge Samantha UNDER THE FREEZING WATER. Beneath

the ice. Bound hand and foot. Strapped to the wheel, wearing

only a nightgown, she is utterly helpless.

THE MAN KNOWN AS DAEDALUS (AKA Luke) stands before her, giving

instructions to the ubiquitous TIMOTHY. He looks up at

Samantha. Seeing her eyelids flutter, he tosses her a cherry

wave. Gone is the gee-whiz country boy schtick; in its place,

a frightening arrogance. He tosses her his cheeriest wave:

Samantha struggles against her bonds. No dice. Subsides.

Takes a look around at her predicament. TIMOTHY stands at

the edge of the ice. Watching her intently. Smiles thinly:

Daedalus shakes his head, frowning:

He crosses toward a large RED BUTTON. Set into a wooden beam.

Samantha thrashes at the bindings. Looks down at the water

where it intercepts the mammoth wheel. Fighting panic:

He hits the button. An electric WHINE -- THE BIG WHEEL TURNS.

Feet first into the water. Struggling. Arms stretched above

her head. She plunges below the surface. A new dimension in

PAIN. Frozen, mind-numbing.

She WRITHES against the wheel. It's like a crushing VICE is

ripping her limb from limb. She opens her eyes, briefly.

Discovers she's not alone -- A mere foot from her face, THE

BLOATED CORPSE of the drowned NATHAN. Staring away and away.

Blue with cyanosis.

Meanwhile, back ON THE SURFACE: Daedalus turns to his right-

hand man, who says:

He turns. Hits the red button again. THE WHEEL reverses

itself. Creaks and moans, turning --

SAMANTHA BREAKS THE SURFACE. Gasping for air. Wheezing.

Choking. The FREEZING WIND plasters the nightgown to her.

Samantha, face twisted. Coughs. Wheezes. TIMOTHY looks her

in the eye... shakes his head:

He exits. Daedalus, alone with his captive. On her features,

unbridled HATRED. He chuckles:

He shakes his head, makes a "tsk tsk" gesture. Smiles grimly

as he turns his attention to the red switch.

Without warning, her head snaps upward -- Eyes cold. Voice,

not her own:

He hits the button. She plunges beneath the surface. Daedalus

walks over to one corner. Sits down. Takes out a pipe. Lights

it. Picks up a book. Reads. And reads.

UNDERWATER -- Sam THRASHES and jerks, to and fro. Dead Nathan,

mocking her. There, under the water, the memories come... In

a flood. Stark and vivid.

MEMORY FLASH - THE YEAR

THE TRUNK OF A CAR opens, revealing a patch of night sky.

Mostly obscured by two familiar individuals --

There's ONE-EYED JACK, remember him? Few years younger. One

eyeball heavier. The other man is TIMOTHY. He looks in the

trunk. Nods.

The lid SLAMS SHUT.

BACK UNDER THE WATER

The world of rushing MADNESS, memories unspooling now, faster

and faster --

MEMORY FLASH: A CLIFF overlooking the ocean. Darkness.

Sheeting rain. Our heroine (for it is unquestionably SAMANTHA)

is lying unconscious atop a rocky bluff. Drenched.

ONE-EYED JACK produces a SYRINGE from a leather case. Rolls

up her sleeve. Starts to administer the injection. Stops. He

can't resist... Can't help LOOSENING the buttons on her shirt.

Her eyes snap open. And before it even registers, she's

grabbed the hypodermic and plunged it deep INTO HIS EYE --

Then she's up and running. Along the cliff, toward the car...

Jack, HOWLING in pain, stumbling... Draws his gun and shoots

her. In the head.

She pitches backward. Tumbles from the cliff...! Rushes

headlong toward the waters below, getting smaller --

INT. BASEMENT OF OLD MILL - THE PRESENT

Here. Now. She breaks the surface. Gasping for breath.

SHRIEKS, a sound ripped from her by the PAIN, the COLD --

By her ruptured sanity. She hangs there. Drenched. Half

frozen.

DAEDALUS can't help it. A chill dances up his spine,

watching... She is not afraid. She is not whimpering. She is

looking directly AT HIM. With a sick smile.

Daedalus struggles to recover his poise.

Charly's eyes bore into his:

Daedalus stabs the red button. THE BIG WHEEL TURNS... Into

the water goes Charly. Going down for the third time.

UNDER THE WATER - HELL - SAME

Here we are again, in the world of silence and blinding PAIN.

Despair and madness but now there's something else -- Now

there's RAGE.

It takes losing most of the FLESH from her right wrist...

But she frees the hand. WRENCHES it loose. The water turns

soupy red around it. GROPES, blindly. Fingers NUMB, so fucking

cold -- Breath, running out. No air. NO TIME.

She darts her right hand forward. Toward the obscenely bobbing

CORPSE of Nathan. Does something grotesque, jams her hand

DOWN THE CORPSE'S PANTS --

Hideaway gun, it's right where he said, right beside Mr.

Wally. PSP-25. Semi-auto, steel jackets. She waits. Rage

inside her. Death in her hands.

MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE SURFACE

The wheel CREAKS. Groans. The terrorist in the western boots

watches her emerge, face first -- She comes up firing.

The first slug takes him in the knee. Blows it to scraps. He

collapses, howling. She shifts aim. THE RED BUTTON. No

hesitation. BLAM-! Hits it DEAD ON. Stops the wheel.

Incredible.

Doesn't blink. Unties her captive hand. BLOWS TO SPLINTERS

the wood surrounding her feet. Leaps to solid ground, as

ANOTHER ANGLE

Daedalus looks up from his prone position. In agony. A vision

from Hell approaches: A fiendish blue-skinned woman in a

sodden nightgown. Blood leaking from one wrist. She has risen,

REBORN, from the icy waters.

She shoots him in the other knee. He HOWLS. Gun, empty. She

tosses it aside. In a nearby crate: ASSAULT RIFLES. Snatches

up a Kalashnikov and clip. Kneels and says:

She fires again.

INT. ROOT CELLAR - WITH HENESSEY

The detective lies naked, bound hand and foot. Beaten.

FREEZING. A single ray of LIGHT through a tiny crack.

He hears a SPLINTERING noise, as if a door's been ripped

from its hinges. Pause -- A FUSILLADE of gunfire. Shouts,

cries. A heavy weight SLAMS to the floorboards above him.

Through a crack comes a tiny stream of BLOOD, dribbling onto

him, as --

EXT. OLD MILL - SAME TIME

TIMOTHY bolts from the house, clutching a bleeding hand.

Running hellbent for leather. Reaches a parked car. Leaps in

and kicks over the engine as, behind him --

MORE MEN come piling out of the house, shouting. Running for

their cars -- never make it. CUT DOWN IN THEIR TRACKS. Wracked

by gunfire, bodies twitching...

And as Timothy PEELS OUT, spraying mud, we pull UP, UP, AND

AWAY... Into the sky, moving ever higher, gunfire fading...

Until now we're WAY UP, we can see Timothy's car... the OLD

MILL, ever so tiny below us...

It blows to pieces. Sends flaming boards flying STRAIGHT UP

AT US.

INT. VICTORIAN BUILDING - CHAPTER HQ - NIGHTTIME

The door bursts open as PERKINS stalks in, shedding his coat.

His aide -- let's call him HARRY -- looks up nervously.

He throws open a door off the passage: THERE'S TIMOTHY.

Perched on the edge of a conference table, tamping a pack of

smokes. Perkins reacts, stunned.

He blows smoke. Trains his eyes on the older man. Piercing.

An agent on the SWITCHBOARD calls out:

Perkins stops dead. Lunges for the phone, nearly drops it:

INTERCUT - OUR HEROINE AT PAY PHONE

We only see her mouth. Set in hard, grim lines. She says:

She clicks off. Perkins darts a look at the techie -- guy

shakes his head, no go on the trace. Perkins swears.

ESTABLISHING SHOT - ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY - NIGHT

There. Thank you, New Jersey, that'll be all. You can go

now. Um, please.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - ATLANTIC CITY - NIGHT

Waking is slow for Mitch Henessey. He swallows dryly. Eyes

creak open, struggle to focus... Hears WATER running. A

shower. Squints at his watch. He's not wearing a watch, he

knew that... In BED, naked. Chest swathed in bandages, what

the hell...? He pokes them. Jerks his head, hissing in pain.

EXT. LIVING ROOM OF SUITE - WITH HENESSEY - NIGHT

Henessey lights a smoke at the bar. Flicks the match in a

trashcan. Starts to go, stops... Reaches into the can. Plucks

out a tiny scrap: PHOTOGRAPH, ripped in two.

A photo of Hal and Caitlin.

He pockets it, disturbed. Crosses to the bathroom door. The

shower has stopped. Raises a tentative hand, starts to

knock... It OPENS. There, in a thin silk robe, is a WOMAN,

swabbing at her hair.

She breezes out of the bathroom all chipper, like nothing's

unusual. Notices Henessey cursorily. Raises a finger: "one

sec." Lowers her head and shakes it like a terrier, spraying

him.

He cannot stop staring. It's Samantha, it *has* to be...

Now she's BLONDE, though. Hair clipped short. Bobbed. Blood-

red fingernails. Red cotton shift, legs for days.

Then, she *smiles* at him -- and it's not her, not Samantha.

Amnesia's over, folks, because we're clearly looking at a

changed woman: This one's name is CHARLY BALTIMORE, and she

hasn't seen the light of day in eight years.

She grabs a washcloth. Frowns, says:

With that, she opens her robe and exposes her breasts.

Henessey perks up considerably -- then SCREAMS as she RIPS

the gauze from his chest. She clinchs the robe again.

INT. CASINO BAR - EVENING

Henessey watches, fascinated. All the little mannerisms, the

differences. Shaking out a match, running a hand through her

hair... And never missing a thing, eyes constantly roving,

scanning. Guard never down. She plucks a drink from a nearby

table, steals it outright.

Henessey grimaces. Clears his throat, says:

She knocks back her drink. No hesitation. Henessey shifts

uncomfortably, lights a smoke.

Henessey squirms, this one's gonna take some time to digest.

Henessey sighs. Next to him a couple get up to dance. He

reaches over and lifts their beers.

He looks at her, confused:

Didn't need to know that. A DANCING SANTA goes by:

He shimmies away. Charly grins at Henessey:

EXT. DANCE CLUB - PAY PHONE - NIGHTTIME

Henessey hunches forward, speaks rapidly into the phone:

He hangs up quickly. Turns -- reveal CHARLY, lounging a foot

away, watching him.

She swipes matches from his pocket. Nods.

EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - NIGHTTIME

CARNIVAL RIDES, dead for the winter. Henessey and Charly

stroll beneath them. He smokes. She eats Chinese.

He takes a good long look at her, still can't fathom it.

She laughs through a swig of beer. MEMORY FLASH: Charly's

bedroom as DAD puts the gun to his head and fires, CRACK...

Henessey huddles, watching her closely.

She nods, gazes out over the icy waters. Speaks, her voice

faraway and gone:

Anger flares in her eye. Like a stirring of mud at the bottom

of a deep, deep, pond.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHTTIME

They enter the suite. She drops her purse, sways toward him.

Presses him against the wall, framed there in the doorway.

Quite suddenly, Charly leans over and kisses him on the lips.

He reacts, startled. Stares at her.

She nibbles his ear. Pulls back, smiling -- and Henessey's

holding the picture of HAL and CAITLIN. The one he found

torn in two. He looks her full in the face:

He pushes her away.

Charly jerks backward. Angry. Henessey heads for the bathroom.

Charly snatches up her purse, eyes burning:

She storms out. CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHTTIME

Charly stalks the city streets. A quartet sings, "God Rest

Ye Merry," ostensibly about joy, oddly the most depressing

tune ever written. On a crowded street, she is alone. Total

misfit. Searches her own haggard features in a shop window.

Swallows hard, whispers:

She bustles down a sidestreet, hands jammed in her pockets.

That's when a tall BEARDED MAN crosses the street and falls

in alongside.

His hand edges out of his windbreaker with a snubnosed .38.

Charly stops walking. Regards him the way you or I might

look at a telephone cord. Groans:

The guy stares, mouth working.

Which is precisely when a much larger Smith and Wesson COCKS

next to his ear:

HENESSEY holds the gun rock steady in his big fist. Charly

spins on him, eyes flashing:

The hitman watches, bewildered. Considers waving to get their

attention. Finally he can't stand it. Blurts out:

Charly snaps her head toward him:

She smiles sweetly.

Takes it off him. Just like that. He stares dumbly at his

empty hand. Half of his trigger finger is missing.

Charly flips the gun into the air. Launches a SPIN KICK.

Shatters his jaw. Catapults him backwards.

Completes her spin, catlike -- Catches the .38 on its way

down. DOESN'T STOP THERE. Arm out, gun cocked -- FIRES.

Straight at Henessey, what...? He dives aside --

BEHIND HIM, a second HITMAN. Blown to tatters. The KNIFE

meant for Henessey arcs through the air...

Imbeds itself in the ground an inch from the prone detective.

He stares at it with shocked eyes. The killer hits, dead.

Twitches. CHARLY. Lowers her arm slowly. Gun barrel smoking.

EXT. ATLANTIC CITY STREET - NIGHTTIME

A BRONCO ROARS UP out of a parking garage. Swerves and plunges

into the maze of streets that inspired the world's most

popular board game.

INT. BRONCO - SAME

Charly drives, possessed. Henessey drinks. Hands shaking.

She throws a shrieking skid. Henessey clutches for the

dashboard, swearing.

Charly reaches over. Yanks the doorhandle.

She kicks him out of the moving car.

EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

He bounces off the highway. Rolls. Over and over, shudders

to a stop. Pause... The wind blows. He groans. Looks up,

spits gravel. Stands. Dusts himself off. Watches the Bronco

go far away.

TIME CUT - EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As Henessey trudges wearily down the highway we HEAR:

A SCREECH of tires, he turns, startled -- here comes the

Bronco. Skids onto the highway and races back toward him.

Pulls up alongside. CHARLY throws open the door, says:

He does. Without a word. Closes the door, they drive off. He

lights a cigarette like nothing happened. Shakes out the

match, speaks without looking at her:

She turns to him, a gleam in her eye. Speaks softly:

Henessey does a spit-take, sprays whiskey.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

The BRONCO races on into the night...

INT. BRONCO - SAME TIME

Late, very late now. Henessey, driving. Beside him, Charly

reclines, lost in reverie. Features bathed in passing

roadlights. Henessey grinds out a butt:

He looks over. She's asleep, hasn't heard a word. Face slack,

lips slightly parted. The toughness banished from her

features. In its place, a lingering sadness. CUT TO:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN BREAKING

The Bronco glides along. Charly in the passenger seat, eyes

roving like a hawk's. THE CAINE HOUSE is peaceful and quiet.

Christmas lights, still burning dimly.

She stuffs a .45 automatic in her waistband. Cradles an MP-5

beneath her coat. Rolls out of the still-moving truck. Makes

her way through back yards. Silent as a cat. She went to

cookouts here. Bridge parties. Now she prowls, a grim

assassin.

Leaps a fence, drops behind a woodpile -- Comes face to face

with RAYMOND, a fifth grade student we saw earlier. Secreted

behind the woodpile, SMOKING. His eyes pop as he spies good

ol' Ms. Caine, sporting blonde hair and an assault weapon.

Charly doesn't miss a beat:

A wet stain appears at his crotch. He hands her the cigarette

with nerveless fingers. Charly accepts it. Takes a long,

satisfying drag. Passes it back.

Moves off through the bushes. Out of sight.

EXT. CAINE BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

Charly kicks aside a pair of abandoned ice skates. Crouches,

face pressed to the glass door. Looking in. The house is

silent and empty. Nobody home. The Christmas tree winks off

and on. The tree she helped decorate. She opens the door and

slips inside. CUT TO:

INT. GOVERNMENT ISSUE SEDAN - DRIVING - SAME TIME

Three GOVERNMENT AGENTS. Faces drawn, haggard. Pit-stained

shirts, day old sandwiches. Carrying photographs of Charly

and Henessey. Agent #1 sighs, examining her figure.

A RADIO MIC on the dash squawks, a voice says:

EXT. CAITLIN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Charly enters. All business. Begins to systematically rifle

the drawers. Her daughter's precious things. Sweeps everything

onto the floor. Utter disregard, it's a bit startling.

Crosses to the bed, throws back the covers -- MR. PERKINS

(the stuffed bear) has the chain around his neck.

We hear it, then. Ghosting on the still air, barely audible,

the sound of SINGING... Children's voices waft across the

frozen pond from St. Paul's Episcopal CHURCH. Charly frowns.

Crosses to the window, lifts the sash.

Pause. Charly chews her lip. Unlimbers the MP-5. Hefts the

wicked-looking thing. Not to fire it... but to use the SCOPE.

Adjusts focus. Practiced movements. Deft. Sure. Sights down

the weapon. Scans though the gunsights...

POV CHARLY: Hal's CHRISTMAS PAGEANT. There's Hal. Cast in

spectral GREEN. Laughing and serving breakfast. On the church

lawn, a NATIVITY scene. Teenage girls as the wise men. Choir

of children, singing... CAITLIN among them.

Charly is sweating. She lowers the scope. Squeezes her eyes

shut. Something in her, threatening to WRENCH LOOSE...

EXT. FRONT OF CAINE HOUSE - SAME TIME

Henessey, slouched behind the wheel. Starts to light a

cigarette. Stops, the match halfway to his face. Eyes riveted

on the rearview mirror as a GOVERNMENT SEDAN turns the corner

behind him...

BACK WITH CHARLY - INSIDE

Watching her family, far away. Fighting emotion. That's when

she hears A HORN HONKING. Her head whips around, toward the

front of the house. The honk is followed by three GUNSHOTS

in rapid succession.

She's up and moving. All else forgotten.

EXT. FRONT OF CAINE HOUSE - SAME TIME

Henessey PEELS OUT, tires smoking. Careens forward, government

SEDAN close behind --

The upstairs window EXPLODES outward. Charly, hurtles through.

Freefalls to the porch roof. Glass, showering down. Hits,

rolls. Surfaces in a combat crouch, FIRES.

Government sedan, KILLS THE PASSENGER. Collapses him over

the doorframe. Gun clatters to the street, car speeds off --

INT. GOVERNMENT SEDAN - DRIVING

The driver looks over, incredulous.

The driver hits a button and up go the windows. All, that

is, except the passenger side window -- Because the dead

guy's bald HEAD blocks it. Becomes WEDGED there. Bald pate

exposed to the world.

BACK WITH CHARLY - FRONT OF HOUSE

Charly watches the two vehicles rocketing away down the

street. Out of range. Lowers the smoking .45. SWEARS. Takes

off around the house at a dead run.

INT. ST. PAUL'S - SAME TIME

Switch scenery: the Christmas Pageant, CAITLIN and fellow

angels traipse into the church vestibule... Caitlin looks up

just in time to see TIMOTHY apply the chloroform.

Two seconds, she's out like a light. Next case. Up and moving,

child tucked neatly under his arm. A NEARBY MOTHER OF THREE

has seen it happen. Opens her mouth to scream -- He palms a

KNIFE. Puts it to her youngest son's kidney:

Freezes her. Petrified.

He exits into the vestibule. Quick. Professional.

MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH:

High speed chase, in progress. The driver dogs Henessey,

jockeys for position. Barks into a radio mic:

The backseat agent hefts an AK-47 assault rifle.

WITH HENESSEY - DRIVING

Henessey checks the rear view mirror -- just in time to see

a circular portion of glass POP from the chase car's window.

Out comes a gun muzzle.

The guy opens up on full auto. Rakes the Bronco, STRAFES it.

Henessey swerves madly -- no go. Death run. He's not coming

home, not this time.

EXT. FROZEN POND - SAME TIME

CHARLY BALTIMORE hurtles forward, SPEED SKATING across the

frozen pond toward the chase vehicles. Long, coltish legs,

to die for.

She goes SIDESLIPPING at superhuman speed. Tacks alongside

the government sedan. Targets the bald guy's head. Raises

the .45 and FIRES. Not to be graphic, but the car's driver

receives the bulk of the mess. SPRAYED.

Across the eyes. He loses control, SKIDS OUT. Catapults off

the road, onto the ice. Slides right toward Charly, *still

doing fifty*...

She doesn't miss a beat. LAUNCHES herself, twisting in

midair... Up OVER THE HOOD of the sedan, it blows by

underneath her as

ANOTHER ANGLE

The incredible part. In slow motion, she does a DOUBLE AXEL

PIRHOUETTE. Above the hood. Mid-spin, she blows THREE SHOTS

through the windshield. Kills everyone. Keeps going. The car

spins twice around. PLOWS to a halt -- Charly hits a picture

perfect landing.

On the shore, HENESSEY watches, thunderstruck. Charly skates

by the icebound sedan. Flashes a grin at the dying driver:

She delivers a blow to the neck. Kills him. CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DRIVING - DAYTIME

Henessey and Charly, driving a new vehicle: late model

Cadillac. Charly driver. Henessey rifles the glove

compartment.

There is a short, CHIRPING sound. Seemingly from nowhere.

They exchange puzzled looks, what the hell...? Charly abruptly

realizes it's coming from her purse. She reaches in, scoops

up the CELLULAR PHONE, the one she told Caitlin to call.

Thumbs the button. Says cautiously:

A voice, then... Clipped tones, TIMOTHY'S voice:

Charly. Hand gripped tight on the phone. Pause, then:

Click.

The detective's mind, racing... suddenly it hits him:

As he rips open the bill we CUT TO:

A neutral background, as Charly's HEAD enters frame, we're

very tight on her FACE... Tense, thin-lipped. A PHONE RINGS,

deafening. Click -- Charly speaks tersely:

CLOSE ON CHARLY: Dead still. Made of glass.

He hangs up. Dead silence. HOLD on Charly's face... until

slowly, ever so slowly, the camera pulls back to REVEAL:

The .45 automatic -- Pointed at the head of an AT&T operator.

THE PHONE COMPANY, they've taken it over. Employees CRINGE

on the floor. Henessey, MP-5 slung on his shoulder, leveled.

Charly points to the switchboard:

EXT. PINE-COVERED MOUNTIANS - UPSTATE NEW YORK - MORNING

Set back from the mountain road, a lonely MOTEL. A neon sign:

*Deer Lick Motel*, No vacancies. The sign sits atop a rusty

pole. Blinks forlornly.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

TIMOTHY hangs up and turns to MR. PERKINS, seated across the

room:

Perkins crosses to the bed. Rubs tired eyes. Gazes down at

Caitlin. Asleep, a syringe on the nightstand beside her.

Next to a brown paper bag.

Perkins follows his gaze: the brown paper bag. Smiles thinly.

He reaches into the paper bag and brings out a BABY DOLL.

Sweet, innocent. Frilly with lace. A bright red bow.

INT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT - NEW YORK STATE - TWILIGHT

Charly and Henessey, eating at HARDEE'S. Seated across from

each other at an orange plastic table, scarfing Christmas

burgers. Outside, a billboard reads: WELCOME TO SANTA CLAUS!

*Where it's Christmas all year long*!

She knows she's shocking him, rubs it in:

The look in her eyes is feral.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHTTIME

Full dark now, the fun begins... A TANKER TRUCK rumbles up

the mountain road. Pulls up before the Deer Lick Motel. MEN

IN SUITS wield flashlights, motioning the truck forward into

a cavernous GARAGE. Inside, men in BLUE JUMPSUITS operate

cranes, maneuver a FILL TANK into place above the truck.

EXT. SURROUNDING MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME

In the distance, as the tanker enters the garage -- CHARLY

BALTIMORE drops into frame. Lands and rolls, cat-quick. Comes

up behind a scrawny pine. Scans through a pair of Zeiss

Nightvision binoculars.

Welcome to the extraction. No more fun and games, tonight

it's a survival-zero operation. HENESSEY appears at her elbow.

Lugging the ordnance bag. He sees Charly lower the binoculars,

head in hands.

INT. BUNKER - SAME TIME

As the tanker snorts to a halt, TIMOTHY pulls up, driving a

bright red Jaguar. Gets out as a blue-suit trots up:

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME

Charly and Henessey. Kneeling. He speaks tersely:

Charly studies the encampment. Armed men. Impossible odds.

Draws a long ragged breath and flops on the ground. Props

her back against a tree. Staring. Lights a cigarette:

She looks up at the sky. Face troubled.

She heaves a sigh. Threads a silencer on a baretta.

Henessey nods. Pause -- she does something unexpected. Leans

over and kisses him hard on the lips. He reacts, startled.

She pulls back, the oddest look on her face.

She kisses him again. Softly. Tenderly. Pulls back, turns

without a word.

She moves off toward the trees. Henessey shifts from foot to

foot, awkwardly. Opens his mouth --

She's gone, like a wraith. CUT TO:

SERIES OF SHOTS: Charly, on the prowl. In and out of the

trees... BURYING C-4 CHARGES. In bushes. In snowdrifts. She

crawls to woods' edge, peers out -- The motel stands solemn

and bedraggled. Draws a sharp breath -- !

There's a LIT CANDLE in the window of 17. CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - SAME TIME

A gray-suited SENTRY. Poised on a wooded slope. He puts a

walkie-talkie to his lips and says:

CHARLY, out of nowhere. Lightning fast. Hand, clamped on

mouth. In goes the knife. Deep. He burbles blood. Drops.

Before he hits, Charly's already switched from knife to gun

and moved on.

EXT. UNIT 17 - SAME TIME

Charly appears from the shadows. Ghosts up to the window of

#17 and peers in. Scans. Misses nothing. Crosses to the door,

taps lightly. Watches the PEEPHOLE, a tiny pinprick of light.

Abruptly darkened by a human eye --

She presses the silenced Beretta to the hole and fires. Sputs

of splinters. From behind the door, a muffled thud. She goes

to work on the lock.

BACK WITH HENESSEY - MINUTES HAVE PASSED

Henessey lies prone, binoculars trained on the motel.

Behind him, a tiny, sharp click--! TIMOTHY has a Skorpion

machine pistol aimed at his head.

The killer speaks into a radio unit, a single word --

POP-! go the Kleig lights. BRILLIANCE, blinding -- CATCHES

CHARLY coming out of 17. Pins her dead to rights. Unconscious

DAUGHTER cradled in her arms. Tiny DOLL cradled in the kid's.

Charly runs, as the ground around her erupts like a

SHELLBURST.

TIMOTHY, MEANWHILE, shouting into his walkie-talkie, saying:

Henessey watches, helpless and PANICKED, as Charly tumbles

BACKWARD. Crashes through a CELLAR ACCESS, it splinters

beneath her...! Plunges into blackness.

INT. CELLAR - PITCH BLACK

She hits, cushions the kid. Grunt of PAIN... THE DARKNESS

EXPLODES into kaleidoscopic FLASHES OF GUNFIRE, Charly strafe

it all. Blows through the clip, hits the lights:

She's killed household items. BRICK WALLS, blasted. Rusty

tools, faded signs -- THREE TEN-GALLON GAS CANS which she's

managed to PERFORATE, good one, Charly... The gas comes

bubbling out on burps and splatters, drenching the floor.

Charly casts about for an escape route. Set into the brick

wall, a huge steel DOOR. She flings it open -- MEAT LOCKER.

Nothing there, no help. Eyes darting. Possessed.

A GRAVELY VOICE wafts down from above, then. Deadly serious:

CHARLY stands in place, mind racing... Caitlin's DOLL. Regards

her dully. Plastic smile like it knows a secret. CUT TO:

INT. MOTEL - 2ND FLOOR - NIGHTTIME

A MATCH FLARES as it descends into the bowl of a pipe... MR.

PERKINS puffs mightily. Turns and favors CHARLY and HENESSEY

with a thoughtful gaze, they're handcuffed to radiator...

TIMOTHY straddles a nearby chair. Smiles and says:

He crosses to the fireplace, flips the match inside.

Pause. Suddenly Charly's eyes go wide. She whispers:

Comprehension, dawning. She looks up in disbelief.

Perkins shrugs philosophically.

Charly and Henessey react, startled...

EXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHTTIME

On the move. Our two heroes, shepherded across the compound.

Timothy's casualness is belied by the presence of two

dyspeptic GUARDS, each keeping a safe distance.

A POCK-FACED AGENT approaches briskly, RIFLE across his

shoulder. Holds out his hand:

Timothy studies it: C-4 CHARGE with remote detonation unit.

The agent rushes off. Timothy looks at Charly reproachfully:

Moves like lightning. WHACK-! Kidney shot. Charly stumbles,

vision going black. Fights for balance. Henessey starts to

react but a GUN MUZZLE stops him. Charly straightens. Grits

her teeth, says:

Timothy and the guards exchange looks. Cracking up, they

can't believe it -- Charly's not laughing. Looks at Timothy

with hooded, lifeless eyes:

Timothy lights a cigarette. Studies Charly.

He casually points to the neighboring valley, where Christmas

lights twinkle.

Pause. Charly summons herself. Her voice a dull rasp:

She shakes her head:

She stares Timothy full in the face.

Dead silence. A pause... Then Timothy brays LAUGHTER.

Hooting out loud. Tears, streaming... He manages to bring

himself under control. Stops, gestures to the CELLAR ACCESS,

the dark awaits...

Charly fights to contain herself.

Charly and Henessey are separated at gunpoint. A look passes

between them. Henessey swallows hard.

Charly goes through the opening.

INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME

The same CELLAR she occupied earlier. Timothy behind her, he

wrinkles his nose in distaste.

Caitlin is sitting in a chair.

Bundled in flannel, clutching her baby doll, the one Perkins

bought for her. She looks up at Charly dully. Sucking her

thumb.

Charly composes herself.

Charly licks her lips. Easy, Charly, keep cool, she mustn't

die afraid...

He points to the STEEL DOOR of the meat freezer. The guard

opens it onto a gleaming silver CHAMBER. Timothy calmly

adjusts the thermostat. Sub zero. The guard reaches for

Caitlin's doll... Charly snatches it back. Face etched in

disgust.

He subsides, unable to meet her gaze. At which point, Timothy

tosses her the WOODEN BOX.

You don't want to ever be on the receiving end of the LOOK

she gives him... Steps into the freezer, holding Caitlin. As

the door starts to swing shut, she says:

She flashes him her most DAZZLING smile -- The whole room

lights up. She can do that. As the door erases her from view,

a chill dances up Timothy's spine... because there was nothing

resembling doubt on her face.

INT. CELLAR MEAT LOCKER - SAME TIME

CHARLY crosses with Caitlin to the far corner.

Moves. Quick. Methodical. Breaks open the BOX: Sure enough,

a hunting knife. Without missing a beat, she crosses to the

STEEL DOOR. Kneels and begins DIGGING at the bottom edge.

CARVING into the brick, what the hell...?

INT. UPSTAIRS INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME

Henessey, by the window. Tied to a chair. Timothy paces before

him, carrying three razor-keen SCALPELS. Pegs one into the

wall with deadly accuracy.

Henessey reacts, startled. Timothy chuckles:

INT. CELLAR MEAT LOCKER - SAME TIME

CHARLY, sweating at sub zero. Brushes hair from her eyes.

Blinks. Still jabbing with the knife, *why the hell is she

digging*? Gonna crawl under the damn door? She's gone loopy.

Lying flat, she appraises her work --

A TINY NOTCH. Poked through to the other side. The actual

penetration to daylight: millimeters. Then, she does two

seemingly nonsensical things: Crosses to Caitlin -- gently

takes the doll from her, then:

Reaches in her mouth. Takes out her RETAINER.

Must be the temperature. Crosses to the door again. Kneels

down. Calmly, with infinite care, takes the retainer...

Inverts it, now it's *trough*-shaped. Holds it flush against

the tiny NOTCH she carved. BABY DOLL, now. Holds it directly

above the retainer. Depresses the KNOB in its back:

It pees gasoline. Gas, trickling down the retainer, through

the brick -- into the other ROOM.

Not much. Enough. She stands. DRAWS A TRAIL with the doll.

Crosses, dribbling, over to Caitlin. Hands the doll back to

her. What next..?

She grabs the hunting knife, that's what. RAISES IT HIGH --

One terrifying moment, is she gonna put it in the kid...?

Hardly. Brings it down on the floor. Slams it down.

Tries again. And again. STRIKING, over and over. Floor RINGS

with the effort --

But in the end, it's just not gonna happen. *Won't work*.

Lets go a GROAN of despair:

She collapses forward. Cradles her head in frustration.

There's a tiny tap in her shoulder.

Charly looks up, face haggard and depleted... Caitlin's eyes,

alive again. No longer dulled. Kid reaches inside her CAST

and brings out a pack of matches.

Charly stares, dumbstruck, at the tiny gift.

The bitterness, the self-hatred, all of it. Under innocent

eyes on Christmas Eve DETONATES, blown sky-high, and she

sweeps up her daughter and cradles her, tears streaming...

Caitlin pulls back, looks flush in her mother's face.

From a dark and cold place, Caitlin has led her home. Charly's

eyes, like steel. A harsh whisper:

She strikes a match.

INT. SECOND STORY INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME

Henessey, straining against his bonds. Sweating.

TIMOTHY across the room, a good forty feet.

Smiling, he raises a scalpel. Eyes dead like a rat's.

INT. CELLAR MEAT LOCKER - SAME TIME

The flame hovers above the gasoline trail.

A tiny nod. Charly calmly touches fire to the fuel. Cradles

Caitlin to her chest, gently strokes her hair...

The flame races across the room. Hits the steel door. And

zip! Vanishes through the NOTCH. A pause...

THE BASEMENT BLOWS SKY-HIGH.

Wooden walls, obliterated. Boards sheared. Atomized. THE

MEAT LOCKER DOOR blows inward like a cannon shot. Holds to

its hinges, buckled like JIFFY POP.

INT. UPSTAIRS INTERROGATION ROOM

TIMOTHY'S THROW is off target, sticks in Henessey's chair.

Between his legs. Inches. Then the assassin LEAVES HIS FEET,

look of comic surprise -- as the walls behind him disintegrate

in FLAME. Henessey cries out, blinded as

EXT. MOTEL BUILDING

He's blown backward OUT THE WINDOW. Chair and all, lofting

across the middle distance... blasts through the MOTEL SIGN.

Blows it to SPLINTERS. Tumbles, and over end... lands, WHAM.

Atop the garage's CORRUGATED ROOF. Chair flies to sticks.

A BLUE SUIT spins, startled. Gun comes up -- Henessey doesn't

miss a beat. Reaches between his legs. Plucks the KNIFE from

the wood and slings it...! Guy takes it in the head, drops.

Some days you get lucky.

He looks up in disbelief. FIREBALL, raging to Heaven.

EXT. BLAST SITE - SAME TIME

TIMOTHY staggers from the smoke. Nicked and bloodied -- ALIVE.

Rushes into the cavernous GARAGE, where blue-suits scuttle

like ants. Points to the tanker, face crazed:

EXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - TRAVELING WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME

Caitlin in tow, SMOKE everywhere. Running flat out across

the compound. Eyes ticking back and forth, missing nothing...

Sees a gun on the ground, scoops it up: promptly DROPS IT,

the fucking thing's red hot.

That's when the POCK-FACED KILLER lurches out of the smoke,

blade arcing for her throat.

She goes under the blade. SLAMS him. Down they go, hit the

dirt -- CAITLIN beats feet, vanishes into the smoke.

Charly, fighting for her life. Manages to KICK FREE. He rears

up. Poised to hurl the KNIFE. Charly, dives, rolls -- scoops

up the gun and SCREAMS as her flesh sizzles and it spurts

three times and blows him down.

Doesn't stop. Rips the AUTOMATIC RIFLE from his shoulder.

Rummages in his coat -- Cube of C-4. Even better. Casts about,

searching the smoke... No sign of her daughter.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHTTIME

CAITLIN darts in and out of the trees. Frightened. In the

background, men rush back and forth. The MOTEL burns merrily.

Then, above the shouts, A RUMBLING noise, she darts a look --

as THE TANKER comes trundling out of the garage.

POV CAITLIN: Attached to the rear of the truck bed, a bright

yellow UTILITY BOX, roughly three by three. As the driver

idles, waiting for the road to clear -- Caitlin BREAKS COVER.

Runs and climbs inside the box, and meanwhile

BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME

Her mother. Crouched behind Timothy's RED JAGUAR. Scans

through the rifle's Starlight Scope. Sweating. Intense. We

see the landscape, cast in ghostly GREEN.

*There*. Bingo. Charly watches through the scope as a TINY

GREEN CAITLIN climbs into the box and shuts the lid.

Unfortunately, a nearby blue-suit has WITNESSED this. He

looks around, stabbing a finger at the box:

A bullet slams him backward in a cut-string sprawl.

WITH CHARLY

She lowers the rifle. Nods grimly:

MEANWHILE, ELSEWHERE ON THE GROUNDS

HENESSEY, on the move. Crouched low. Choking on woodsmoke,

eyes streaming. Up ahead, a splayed CORPSE -- He hunkers

over the poor schmuck, guy's good for a radio. Snatches up

the portable unit. Fumbles with the dial, searching for 26.9

megahertz...

EXT. CLIFFSIDE - HIGH ABOVE MOTEL - SAME TIME

CHARLY slews to a stop in the red Jag. Leaps out. Darts along

the cliff, throws herself flat. Peering down at the grounds,

sniper rifle positioned -- Babysitting the tanker.

HEARS HENESSEY... Calling to her on the radio.

Grabs the unit from her belt:

Henessey draws a sharp breath. Swallows, says:

On her reaction we CUT TO:

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROADSIDE - WITH TANKER AND EN TOURAGE

Beside the tanker, A PANEL TRUCK sits, engine idling. Phony

logo on its side -- *Little Debbie* snack cakes. A RAMP is

lowered, and a CAR begins backing up into the truckbed, facing

outwards.

INSIDE THE TRUCKBED, harried blue-suits hurriedly unwrap the

frost-covered corpse of IMN AL RAHMAN -- and place him behind

the wheel.

MEANWHILE, AT THE BACK OF THE TANKER

A blue-suit puts a PADLOCK on the utility box as he passes.

SNAPS IT SHUT.

BACK WITH HENESSEY - SAME TIME

He hears two flat CRACK-!s on the still air.

Even over the receiver, her desperation's apparent:

Henessey rubs his eyes. Takes several deeps breaths, mind

turning it over. He looks up. Tired. Haunted.

He stuffs a fresh clip in the gun. Wipes away sweat.

Closes his eyes. Gathers himself. Long pause...

He leaps from the roof and makes a death run.

Gun in one hand, radio in the other. Swerving and dodging

like a broken-field runner, CHARLY in his ear screaming:

He spins, BLASTS AWAY, dead guy, pitching forward -- SMOKE,

billowing, making him COUGH...

Stumbling, catching himself. Barreling forward.

He breaks right.

He staggers out of the smoke: TWO MEN, MP-5 machine guns.

Trained on his chest. He struggles to aim, oh, shit -- Two

distant CRACKS. The bad men go away, catapulted backwards.

Henessey shouts into the radio:

UP ABOVE, ON THE HILL

CHARLY fires shot after shot. Every time she squeezes the

trigger, someone dies. No such thing as wounded, we're talking

St. Peter looks up from a magazine and says holy shit, it's

the lunch rush at Kate Mantilini's.

BACK DOWN BELOW

The smoke clears and Mitch sees the tanker. Right there,

thirty yards away. Yellow UTILITY BOX. No one in the way.

He breaks for the truck.

Everybody fires a gun.

MITCH GETS HIT

Takes one high in the chest, SPINS him...!

UP ON THE HILL

CHARLY SPRAYS on full auto, DICES TO TATTERS the combat zone,

extinguishing the gunmen, too little too late because

MITCH IS IN DEEP

BAM--! bullet takes out his right arm, fuck *you*, buddy,

doesn't miss a beat, simply tosses the gun over to the other

hand and KEEPS SHOOTING, blows that fucker down and now he's

staggering into the trees, and collapses, and HITS... And

lies very still and bleeds. As ECHOES of gunfire die slowly,

we HEAR:

UP ON THE HILL

Aftermath... Charly's out of ammo. Flings aside the rifle,

snarling in a helpless rage -- Something else, then. SOUND,

nearby. Building in pitch, reaching a crescendo --

A SCREAMING CHOPPER RISES BEHIND HER.

Crests the cliff and hovers like the SWORD OF DAMOCLES.

INT. CHOPPER - SAME TIME

MARKSMAN, riding shotgun. Scans the cliff below: Thick

evergreens. Charly, somewhere among them. He sights down his

rifle, takes careful aim -- BLOWS OUT TIRES on the Jaguar.

Cripples it. The chopper BANKS, heading away.

BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME

In big trouble. MANY HEADLIGHTS, bouncing uphill toward her.

Cut off, they've cut her off -- The other direction ain't

much better: A 200 FOOT DROP. Straight down. Evergreen trees,

far below. Power lines. Highway.

She hears the PHONE RINGING, then... inside the Jag. Crosses

slowly. Reaches in, lifts the receiver. It's TIMOTHY.

He clicks off. Charly drops the receiver. Turns, looks behind:

They're coming for her.

Woods filled with headlights. Backlit FIGURES. Ducking in

and out of the trees, getting closer... The wind blows. Bitter

cold out here in the dark night of the soul. Nothing left.

No hope. No reason.

Caitlin, dead.

The rage explodes in the form of a kick which SHATTERS the

lock on the trunk. *Dammit*, she needs a fucking miracle.

At that moment, the trunk lid slowly rises, CREAKING...

Revealing all of Timothy's BUNJEE JUMPING EQUIPMENT.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - SAME TIME

The TANKER is rolling. Out onto the road, snorting and

belching. Preceded by the Little Debbie PANEL TRUCK.

INT. UTILITY BOX - ON TANKER - SAME TIME

Poor little Caitlin huddles in the dark. All alone. ROARING

in her ears. Sort of like being underwater.

EXT. TANKER TRUCK - CLOSE ON UNDERBELLY

A silver device attached to the skin of the tank.

WITH TIMOTHY - CROSSING THE SMOKE-FILLED GROUNDS

He consults a tiny, liquid crystal display on his watch. Red

numerals. *178 degrees*.

EXT. CLIFF'S EDGE - WITH CHARLY

She won't quit. Busy now, deftly sticking the wad of C-4

EXPLOSIVE to the bottom of the Jaguar. Straightens. Turns

around --

Stands dead calm as they all come out of the TREES, guns

drawn... Raises her hands, see, boys...? No bang-bang.

Like backlit monsters, they approach, hulking. Matter of

yards, now... She flashes a naughty little smile --

Goes backward off the cliff and rockets earthward.

200 feet of open air, THE BUNJEE Cord pays out, fast...!

Whipsaws out the door of the Jaguar, hooked by carabiner to

the STEERING COLUMN and meanwhile

THE CHAPTER AGENTS

Rush forward, incredulous. Peer OVER THE EDGE: Below them, a

swan diver, BLACKNESS all around. She drops like a stone.

Vanishes into the fog, beautiful as a poem.

INSIDE THE JAGUAR: The cord goes taut -- Now it starts to

stretch outward. DECELERATION kicking in, Charly can FEEL

it, still whistling through space...

Hits a dead stop.

This is it. Cord, stretched as far as it goes.

She's still sixty feet above the highway.

No hesitation whatsoever. She thumbs the DETONATOR in her

right fist --

Blows the car.

UP ABOVE - CLIFF'S EDGE

The Jaguar goes up with a solid CRUMP--! Blown off the edge

of the cliff. Along with a half dozen screaming AGENTS.

BACK WITH CHARLY - FALLING

Lifeline cut. 60 feet above the road, no problem. She does

thirty feet in freefall. Raises her left hand --

Slaps a carabiner on a passing POWER LINE. Hurtles downward

until suddenly, KA-CHUK--! She LURCHES to a stop.

Doesn't miss a beat: Grips a rope and GLIDES the last thirty

feet, touches down lightly. Unhooks herself, turns as AN

ONCOMING CAR throws a fishtail SKID, just misses her. Driver

SWEARS.

She raises her gun. Fires without blinking.

Puts a hole in the passenger side windshield and the DRIVER

ain't sticking around, he's out the door and gone as

CHARLY THE EXTERMINATOR

Crosses to the car, face a stone mask. Behind her the FLAMING

JAGUAR SMASHES to the ground, raining fragments -- Followed

by BURNING CORPSES, smacking the pavement one after another.

She doesn't even look. Gets behind the wheel. Leaves most of

her tires on the road behind her.

EXT. MAIN STREET - TOWN OF SANTA CLAUS - CHRISTMAS EVE

Milling crowds. Music and laughter. SANTA heads up a TEEMING

PARADE down Main Street, atop a horse-drawn sleigh... Replay

of the film's opening, as

EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

The gleaming TANKER roars down a sidestreet. Riding point:

the innocuous PANEL TRUCK.

The temperature gauge continues to RISE: *203 degrees*.

EXT. MAIN STREET - EDGE OF TOWN - SAME TIME

Charly runs a roadblock, doing fifty -- Someone put a PARADE

in front of her. Hits the BRAKES...! Fishtales into a mailbox.

Sends it flying through a plate glass window. Out of the

car, gun held low, and meanwhile --

INT. CAR - DRIVING

TIMOTHY barks orders into a mic:

Racing toward the edge of town and meanwhile

ON THE PARADE ROUTE

SANTA CLAUS himself perches atop his sleigh, feeling like a

rock star and wishing his groupies were legal... when suddenly

he's got company.

The rogue colonel FIRES A SHOT in the air -- THE HORSES bolt.

Plunging off the parade route amid SCREAMS as

INT. PLUSH LIMO - SAME TIME

MR. PERKINS hunkers forward, face slack, as a tinny VOICE

issues from his headset mic:

Perkins stares straight ahead, speechless.

EXT. HIGHWAY - HEADING OUT OF TOWN

SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE TANKER. Horses at full gallop, hooves

in pounding frenzy. Charly tries to JUMP from one to the

other -- no go, the tanker pulls away, widening the distance,

and meanwhile

TWO GOVERNMENT SEDANS

Come whipping out of ALLEYS, fall in behind them. CRACK--!

Gunshots, shattering the stillness.

EXT. TRUCK CHASSIS - SAME TIME

A RICOCHET whines off a hydraulic cable. Spurt of fluid as

the BRAKES start to go, and meanwhile

BACK ON THE SLEIGH

CHARLY throws herself flat next to Santa.

The SEDANS jockey for position, try to pull ABREAST -- Charly

swerves the sleigh back and forth, won't let them through.

She hands the reigns to Santa.

Santa complies. PEELS OFF to the left -- Opens a TWELVE FOOT

chasm between sleigh and tanker. Sure enough, one of the

government cars spurts forward to fill the gap, comes ABREAST

of them. It's what she wanted.

*FIVE SECONDS*:

Charly Baltimore LEAPS from the sleigh, lands atop the

government car. Skips lightly across it, casually BLOWS TWO

SHOTS through the ROOF. Down through the metal. Drilling

into their heads. Driver and passenger, killed instantly --

As Charly hops nimbly from her 50 mile-an-hour STEPPING STONE.

Over to the tanker. Dump-stuffs a new clip, as

THE CORPSE CAR

Fades from the race, driverless. Whipping out of control.

FISHTAILS away behind them -- Takes out the SECOND CHASE

CAR, spray of metal.

Three seconds, and Charly's taken out two pursuers.

INT. CAB OF TANKER TRUCK - SAME TIME

The door files open and the DRIVER sees CHARLY. Bloody.

Demonic. Wisely leaps out, BOUNCES from view -- Charly snags

his hat as he goes by, plops it on her head. SWINGS UP into

the drivers' seat, double-clutches -- pours on the steam.

Five seconds. She owns the tanker.

BLASTS forward into the lead PANEL TRUCK. Slams the truck

from behind, BULLDOZES it -- Sends it THUNDERING into a park

bench. Glass sprays.

She owns the road. On the seat beside her: an MP-5 machine

gun. She's set. Throws a NINETY DEGREE turn onto a sidestreet.

Donates most of her tires to New York.

INT. SPEEDING TANKER TRUCK - SANTA CLAUS - NIGHT

Charly's on fire. Senses heightened. Eyes tick back and forth

like a machine. Heading downhill, out of town...

She hits the brakes. A flash of SPARKS..! A ripping WHINE,

dies away -- The brake pedal is all play. Nothing. She's in

a runaway truck.

Barreling onward. A lunging behemoth.

CHAIN-LINK FENCE, at road's end. Beyond it, a quarter-mile

plunge. Downhill over rocky terrain --

To St. PETER'S SEMINARY. Looming stone structure. Closed

now. Vast empty PARKING LOT.

Tears on her cheeks. Lights a cigarette. Takes a long drag,

exhales:

Blows through the chain-link fence.

SHUDDERS AND LEAPS DOWNHILL. Mud blows skyward. Trees, blasted

to splinters.

CAITLIN

Buffeted inside the UTILITY BOX. Cries out as

IN THE CAB

Charly fights to contain the beast. "Fuck you," slyly retorts

the beast. She BOUNCES and caroms off the sides like a mad

pinball --

THE TRUCK SMASHES DOWN

And all the windows BLOW OUT concussively and the front tires

go with a volcano CRACK-! as the beast goes canting to one

side, ponderous, MASSIVE...

It keels over on its side. Still doing fifty.

TRAVERSES THE PARKING LOT.

Slows itself by TAKING OUT LIGHT POLES, shears them off like

saplings.

Whacks the side of the chapel. IMPACT. Keeps going...

Charly is EJECTED from the cab. Pinwheels through space like

a broken doll, bursts through a STAINED GLASS WINDOW.

INT. CHAPEL

The glass ruptures as she catapults through. Hits on her

stomach, bounces. Slides to a stop, rolls over --

FLINGS herself aside just in time, as a towering ST. PETER

SMASHES to earth an inch from her head, showers marble...!

Concussion dies away. Silence. Echoes.

EXT. SEMINARY GROUNDS - SAME TIME

The tanker slides, DETONATING planters one by one... Comes

to rest in a central COURTYARD. Lies there, a hissing

dinosaur.

TIMOTHY'S TEMPERATURE GAUGE is still affixed to the truck's

underbelly: *280 degrees*.

INT. CHAPEL - WITH CHARLY

Charly, semi-conscious. Rolls onto her back, gasping. Stares

at the gathered saints. Swallows hard. Sucking it up,

preparing. Rolls to one knee, plants her foot...

She's got to make that truck.

On her feet now. Stumbling forward. One arm hugging her guts.

Cross-eyed, so hard to focus... left foot, right foot, get

it done, bitch, yes it's *supposed* to hurt that much, flings

open the door and she's so brave that for a second we think

she might make it.

Timothy kicks her in the head.

Charly flies back. Hits and SLIDES. Fetches up against a

bannister, WHAM--! Timothy calmly shuts the door behind him.

Consults his tiny gauge -- *297 degrees*.

He sheds his coat. Stows his gun. Removes a SWITCHBLADE.

Drapes the coat on the bannister. Flicks open the knife.

He approaches, almost casually. Charly staggers erect. Adopts

a killing stance. Instinct. She can barely stand.

INT. PERKINS' LIMOUSINE - SAME TIME

PERKINS hears a garbled, pained voice over his headset:

He leans back. Stares sightlessly. Loosens his tie, hits the

intercom and says:

He takes out a bottle of Scotch. CUT TO:

INT. CHAPEL - SAME TIME

Charly and Timothy. They circle, two pros.

Never watching the eyes, the eyes are liars, they watch the

HANDS... The gathered saints look on, neutral.

His concentration never falters as he says:

He LUNGES with the knife, she spins away -- He gets hold of

one arm and FLINGS her, up and over...! She SAILS through

space. Twists in mid-air. Lands like a cat. Almost. Staggers

forward. They circle...

Charly LAUNCHES herself. Avoids a stab at her throat, eats

that for breakfast, spins, slams the knuckles of her right

hand into Timothy's ribs. Busts one. He snarls, TRAPS her

wrist: CRACK! Wrist, broken. She HISSES in pain, falls back

GASPING.

Circling again. Charly cannot walk a straight line.

CLOSE ON CHARLY

She looks up at him from sunken eyes shot through with red,

and in those eyes we glimpse it; the DEMON, laughing... as

Charly whispers:

He lunges with the knife...! She ducks, trips on purpose and

HANDS HIM HER SHOULDER, all that's missing is the plate --

And WHAM. In goes the knife, cuts deep and Charly looks him

in the eye and GRINS because sure enough, there's the

bastard's KNEE, wide open...

Boot-strikes, BAM--! Shears the knee, and Timothy HOWLS in

agony. Stumbles backward into the bannister --

Grabs his coat. Brings out the gun, it GOES OFF--!

Charly dives for cover. Rips the knife from her own shoulder

and flings it.

Takes him in the shoulder. Topples him back. BANNISTER. Up

and over, flailing...! Drops from sight.

Charly falls back. Pause. Sucking air. Sits down hard. Legs

splayed. Looks down at herself, oh, God...

There's a hole in her chest.

EXT. SEMINARY - NIGHTTIME

The doors burst open and here she comes. Trauma, severe.

Shock, blood loss -- She makes for the tanker. For her kid.

Hitches. Staggers. Going on sheer guts.

THE HELICOPTER ROARS OVERHEAD

The PILOT brandishes his radio mic:

WITH CHARLY

Left foot, right foot, she's not running, she's falling in a

straight line -- Reaches the tanker. Staggers against the

inverted chassis. UTILITY BOX. Above her.

She raises her gun. Fires. BAM-! Lock springs to pieces.

CAITLIN tumbles to the pavement, dazed and confused. Casts

about --

She springs to her feet. Comes running and flings both arms

around her mother. HUGS HER -- That one puts Charly out for

a few seconds. PAIN, excruciating. Comes to her senses,

swaying like a clothesline in a high wind...

Charly grabs Caitlin's head. Turns it. Facing the TEMPERATURE

GAUGE. Red numerals: *301 degrees*.

Caitlin hovers, torn. Charly summons a gutteral CROAK:

In the end, Caitlin relents. RUNS, toward the surrounding

woods... Charly watches her go. Nods, satisfied -- Collapses.

Hits the tarmac and splays in a heap. Breath wheezing in and

out. Already the pavement is staining red.

WITH CAITLIN

As, within ten seconds of the command, she promptly DISOBEYS

her mother, looks back -- Stops dead.

There's a corpse underneath the truck.

It isn't moving. It isn't breathing. It isn't laughing or

crying...

Or hurting, not anymore.

Bomb forgotten. Danger forgotten. Her tiny arms pumping,

feet slapping pavement -- She returns to her mother. Grabs

one knife-bloodied shoulder, oblivious of the wound. Jerks

back and forth. Frenzied.

CHARLY. Cheek against the pavement. One lifeless eye STARES.

Bloodshot and sightless.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Government vehicles, pulling up now. At the edge of the

parking lot. 100 yards away, give or take. Numerous SEDANS.

The Little Debbie panel truck. AGENTS crouch behind cars.

Weapons trained on the wounded behemoth.

EXT. SEMINARY - SAME TIME

The side door BURSTS OUTWARD and a limping figure emerges,

frantically signaling for the chopper: TIMOTHY'S got murder

in his eye. THE CHOPPER banks, coming in low as he hauls

himself aboard.

He grabs an automatic rifle.

BACK WITH CAITLIN - UNDERNEATH THE TANKER

She adheres to Charly's motionless form. Looking small and

terrified. Whispers in her mother's ear. Soft and low:

Face contorted, she strikes out. Flails. HITS Charly.

Tears coursing in rivulets. Little fists clenched. Then --

It might be a trick of the wind. Tiny aspiration, not enough

breath to fog a mirror...

A solitary tear appears in the wide-open staring eye. One

fingernail, then. Scratches feebly. Toes, shifting. Seeking

purchase. A HAND, planting itself... TEETH BARED, a rictus

of pain... Rising up...

*Standing*. Full height now, flexing one deadly arm. She

hugs her daughter and says:

Overhead, the HOWLING of rotor blades. Charly gasps for

breath. Cracks open the GUN... no bullets. Swell. Scans the

pavement... There. THE MP-5 machine gun lies twenty feet

from her. Twenty miles, same difference. Across the pavement,

even farther away: Timothy's car.

*305 degrees*. Charly swallows hard:

They break cover. Into the open. A WITHERING FIRE ERUPTS.

Right at their feet...! Geysers of asphalt, shot skyward --

TIMOTHY sprays the blacktop from above. Ruthless. Charly

goes insane. Lurches, crazed, to the cab of the truck. Thumbs

the mike and says:

EYES SNAP OPEN IN DARKNESS. We don't know whose they are. We

don't know where we are.

BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME

The temperature gauge: *308 degrees*. She clutches Caitlin.

Shouting into the mic:

EXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT

A sour-looking CHAPTER AGENT stands before a row of cars and

the Little Debbie panel truck. Expressionless beaurocrat.

Lifts the mic to his lips and says:

Behind him, the back of the panel truck EXPLODES. A car

CATAPULTS outward into space -- SMASHES DOWN atop two sedans.

Blows out their windshields. Flings itself to the pavement

and RICOCHETS forward, zero to sixty.

MITCH HENESSEY

At the wheel. Making a suicide run. Face a FRIGHT MASK of

deadly purpose. We have no idea why someone who looks like

him is alive.

INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME

*Distraction*, just enough: The pilot banks toward the CAR.

Timothy grabs the stick -- THAT'S WHEN CHARLY BREAKS COVER.

Does a MAD STAGGER across the blacktop. Goes for the GUN.

TIMOTHY CHANGES DIRECTION. Chopper again, SCREAMING in low

and fast --

CHARLY dives, rolls -- Comes up with the MACHINE GUN and

falls flat on her back, points it skyward:

She fires. Blows the chopper's TAIL ROTOR. The craft pitches

to the side -- Dumps Timothy out the door. Flailing.

Head over heels, he FALLS -- Lands atop the TANKER, right on

the silver tank and *burns*. Actually SIZZLES at 310 degrees

Celsius, steam pouring off him like a vampire in daylight,

SHRIEKING--!

She watches as he slips from sight... off the tanker. SIRENS

now, approaching. Wind, biting cold. Ground black and bloody

in the moonlight...

HERE COMES HENESSEY, powers across the lot, pedal to the

metal. Followed at a distance of fifty yards by half a dozen

squawling GOVERNMENT VEHICLES, flashers turning.

Henessey stomps the brake. SLEWS to a stop, tires cooking...!

KICKS open the passenger door as Charly collapses into the

car, CAITLIN in her arms. The kid says:

He PEELS OUT.

He inadvertently smacks a light pole. SPARKS fly.

EXT. PARKING LOT - BESIDE THE TANKER - SAME TIME

They have to drag Timothy inside the car. The engine ROARS

as it leaps forward, trailing the other FIVE -- Scarred and

hideous, he stares after Charly, screaming:

That's when the helicopter crashes. The pilot does everything

but flap his arms -- Forget it. IT KEELS OVER. Rotor touches

pavement -- Blows to pieces. They ALL go. Snapped off. Blown

like rockets in every direction.

TIMOTHY LOOKS UP as a rotor blade whistles right through the

windshield of his car. Shears off his HEAD. Blows out the

BACK in a shower of glass and hurtles onward, SPINNING out

of control...

Strikes the tanker. Boom.

Imagine God in Monte Carlo. Tossing dice the length of a

craps table. Now, imagine the dice are BURNING CARS.

EXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

Henessey flies out of the parking lot and INTO the WOODS as

the firestorm RAGES TO HEAVEN behind him. Cars, heading his

way -- AIRBORNE. Fights the wheel, swerving through the woods

as all around him, FLAMING CARS crash down. BOUNCING into

and out of the trees, peekaboo...

Some go flying past OVERHEAD. Striking in front like meteors,

GOUGING the earth. Caitlin screams:

Henessey favors her with a foul look. CHARLY looks up and

sees ANGELS flying overhead, trailing concrete...

Then they're OUT OF THE WOODS. Car slingshots onto the highway

and races forward, SAFE. Behind it, the sky is aglow, SNOWING

fiery traces... Bits of earth, trees, pavement.

OVERHEAD VIEW: As they roar out of town, we see burning woods

and a CRATER approximately 150 yards in diameter -- St.

Peter's Seminary no longer exists... CUT TO:

EXT. ROADSIDE - OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHTTIME

Henessey coasts to the side of the road and stops. He lays

his head on the steering wheel, sucking air. Looks at Charly:

Charly offers him that soft, sad little smile.

Henessey starts to fade... breathing labored... Reaches up...

strokes Caitlin's hair. Smiles at her:

Slumps back in the seat. Gazing at Charly. A single tear

runs from one bloodshot eye. He whispers:

Dies.

Charly leans on the dash. Cries for awhile. For herself...

for Henessey... for this Godawful planet, and everything

else. DISSOLVE TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME TIME

A MOTHER SITS in the glow of a Winnie the Pooh nightlight.

Next to her sleeping daughter's bed -- back to the very

beginning of the film, it's been a long kiss goodnight.

An elderly FARMER pokes his head in. She doesn't look up.

The shadowy figure nods... Remains seated. Stays awhile in

the dark. Keeping vigil. Snow slithers against the glass.

EXT. PALATIAL GEORGETOWN ESTATE - EARLY MORNING

MR. PERKINS emerges from a guest cottage, flanked by his

aide Harry.

Harry's FOOT comes down on a circular slab of STONE -- and a

voice from the grave says:

Stops him in his tracks, stops him dead --

As CHARLY BALTIMORE steps from the nearby trees. Stands,

twenty yards downrange. Beretta leveled at both of them.

Two months, you barely notice the limp. She stands there in

sleeveless top and short skirt and looks like a million.

Thumbs a metal box, click-! A red ARMING LIGHT blinks on.

PERKINS steps forward. The gun shifts. Targets him.

She reaches in a pocket. Tosses him a cellular phone -- He

catches it as though it were a live snake.

He swallows hard. Looks to his aide... back to her... DIALS.

Charly takes a deep breath. Scans the flowers, face placid.

It's really quite lovely today. Maybe she'll start a garden.

Perkins clicks off. Look at Charly:

She smiles. Shifts her aim and shoots the other guy.

Perkins' eyes WIDEN in sudden realization. He LUNGES forward,

grabs the aide, holding him up... desperately propping his

dead weight atop the land mine...

EXT. GEORGETOWN AVENUE - DAYTIME

Henessey's CHRYSLER CONVERTIBLE has been restored to a cherry

red. It purrs along the boulevard, Charly at the wheel. Hair

blowing. She talks on the cellular phone:

Behind her a GOUT OF EARTH blows skyward. Showers the road a

ways back.

INTERCUT - PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

He speaks from the oval office, face grave:

EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - AKRON, OHIO - DAY

Henessey's EX-WIFE stands in the open doorway, flanked by

her son TODD. Two uniformed COPS speak solemnly:

He shows her a mug shot of TIMOTHY.

In the eyes of a young boy, Henessey finds redemption.

EXT. HOUSE - EDGE OF WHEATFIELD - TWILIGHT

Sun, passing into mystery. Wheatfield, rippling. Caitlin is

in the yard, chasing a big floppy-eared Labrador.

On the porch, a CRICKET chirps. HAL comes out, sits beside

his wife CHARLY as she finishes eating. Says softly:

Pause. Charly says nothing. The dog parades up to Caitlin

with a stick in its jaws. A farm truck goes by, a faraway

speck.

Charly absent-mindedly rolls a steak knife in her fingers.

Eyes far away.

It never occurs to her what she's done until the chirping

stops.

Ten feet away, the knife quivers.

FADE OUT. ROLL END CREDITS.
