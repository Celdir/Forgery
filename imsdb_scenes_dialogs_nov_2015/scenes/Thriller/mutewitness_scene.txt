Close shot on the radio. The volume of the radio goes up.

FILM SET - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

The camera (and consequently the eyes of the intruder) moves along

the corridor, toward the door of the bathroom. It stops very

shortly to look at the young woman, still taking care of her make-

up, and moves away to look at the open door on the other side of

the corridor.

FILM SET - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

A kitchen. There is no light and the room is very dark. Close shot

on the row of knives hanging on the wall. A man's hand takes one

of the knives.

The young woman opens a small closet, temporarily hiding her face

to the camera. She takes a lipstick and start doing her lips.

Close-up shot on the woman's lips, with the lipstick moving around

them.

Back to the mirror, showing the reflection of the young woman. She

opens the small closet. In the mirror, which covers the door of

the closet, we see a man approaching slowly, with a knife in his

hand.

Close-up shot on the woman's lips.

FILM SET - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

High-angle shot of the corridor, seen from the ceiling.

The woman comes out of the bathroom. She sees something, stops and

walks slightly backward.

She walks to an half-open door and closes the door.

When she closes the door, a corpse, who was hidden by the half-

open door, falls, face down, on the floor. The woman screams.

The corpse on the floor. It is a man with blood on his face. The

woman bends down on the man and shakes him.

She turns him around to look at his face. We see the white shadow

of a man coming out of a room.

FILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

A white telephone in the foreground. The girl runs toward the

telephone. She dials on the phone. We see the mysterious man in

the background, slowly walking into the room, coming from the

corridor. The girl has the telephone handset on her ear, but

apparently, she gets no tone. She frenetically taps on the

telephone hook to make it work. Then she sees the cut wire on the

phone and picks it up. The man is coming closer to her. He has a

black mask on his face, and a white apron covered with blood.

The woman sees the man. She drops the phone and walks back until

she reaches the wall. She moves out of the room to :

FILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

The woman walks back until she reaches the bed. The man, covered

with blood, has his knife raised above his head. The woman falls

backward on the bed. The man raises his knife above the woman's

body. The woman screams. The man stabs repeatedly the woman with

his knife, and then moves away from the bed.

FILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

The man enters the room and takes the mask away from his face.

FILM SET - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

Apparently, the woman is not dead and she walks to the desk.

FILM SET - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY (NIGHT in the film)

The man crosses the room.

The bedroom can be seen through the large open door between the

two rooms. The woman tries to steady herself by holding on the

desk, but she falls down on the floor, and the desk with her.

The man sits himself on a table, and searches the breast pocket of

his shirt for a cigarette.

The woman crawls on the floor toward the dining room. She is

holding her stabbed stomach.

The man rolls a cigarette.

The woman stands up, holding on bookshelves set on the wall

between the two rooms.

The man licks the paper of his cigarette.

The woman still holds on the bookshelves.

The man has put the cigarette in his mouth. A hand moves into the

shot, holding a lit match to his cigarette.

The woman falls on the floor, with the bookshelves falling on top

of her.

The two men, the one who stabbed the girl and Arkadi, the one who

lit the other man's cigarette, they both look at the woman and

laugh.

The woman crawls out from underneath the bookshelves. She stands

up, holding on the table.

Back to the two men. A hand comes into the shot, holding a metal

flask to Arkadi. He doesn't take it and the camera moves on the

right to a third man sitting near the two other ones. He drinks

from the flask.

The camera moves to the right of the shot, and the title of the

film appears in white letters on a dark screen. The camera keeps

on moving from one face to another, apparently the faces of the

members of the film crew. And on those faces, we see :

CREDITS (Part Two)

In the background, we hear the noises of the girl who keeps on

falling down and breaking the furniture.

Close up on a dial. A needle is moving on the dial, on which,

besides numbers, is written Groove Depth and Batteries.

The woman falls down. Since she was holding on the tablecloth, the

tablecloth comes away with her, and everything that was on the

table falls down on the floor.

Arkadi and the murderer are laughing.

Close shot on the face of the sound engineer, with the earphones

on his ears.

By now, we've started to understand that what we have seen up till

now is not real, but is part of the shooting of a film, a strange,

a bit gory film, but still a film.

The sound engineer shushes the two laughing man down, and looks

down at his tape recorder.

Close shot of the tape recorder.

The camera moves to the right, and shows a female hand writing on

a clipboard, then moves up and shows a large stopwatch hanging

from a cord around the neck of the writing girl. The camera keeps

on moving up to show the face of the writing girl. She is Karen

Hughes, the assistant director and girlfriend of the director. She

looks at what is going on around the set and squints her eyes,

apparently not liking it.

The camera moves to the right and shows the face of Billy Hughes,

Karen's sister and FX make-up artist.

Back to the actress playing the part of the stabbed woman. She

holds the corner of a chest of drawer, and makes everything on top

of that piece of furniture fall on the floor, including several

bottles of alcohol.

Back to Karen and Billy. Billy represses a laughter behind her

hand.

Close shot on Lyosha, a young assistant camera operator, looking

at Billy and smiling. Then close shot on Billy's face.

The actress holds the drapes of the nearest window. She falls down

on the floor tearing the drapes and breaking the curtain-rod off

the wall.

Karen and Billy are both laughing silently.

The actress gets slowly out from under the torn drapes.

Lyosha looks at the actress, and then at Billy.

Billy looks at the actress, and then at Lyosha.

Close up shot on Lyosha's face, smiling.

Billy walks behind Karen's back to the other side of Karen. Karen

looks at her, and then looks in the direction into which Billy is

looking.

Lyosha keeps on smiling.

Karen whispers in Billy's ear.

Billy answers in sign language. We understand that Billy cannot

speak, but she isn't deaf.

The actress, half-covered with the drape, drags the curtain-rod

behind her.

Billy is smiling and Karen is looking at the scene with her mouth

half open.

Close shot on a smiling bearded film crew member. The camera then

moves to the right, to an open ring binder, with a hand following

whatever is written on the document. The camera keeps on panning

on the right, showing part of instruments and people's hands,

while we hear some whining noises coming from the actress.

END OF CREDITS

The camera stops on a close shot on Andy Clarke's face. Andy is

the film director.

The actress looks like a ghost with the drape covering her. She

slowly falls down on the floor, among the mess she has created by

breaking and dropping every prop in sight.

Andy looks thunderstruck by what he sees on the set.

Close up shot on the camera. A button just switched off, showing

that there is no more film inside the camera.

Andy looks at the camera and sighs.

He puts his hands on his eyes.

The actress, still lying on the floor under the drape, raises the

drape to look at Andy.

He stands up.

Both Andy and Natasha, the interpreter, walks toward the still

lying actress and squats around her.

Natasha translates in Russian what Andy just said.

Natasha translates.

Natasha translates.

Natasha translates.

The actress tries to understand what Andy tells her through

Natasha.

Natasha translates

Natasha translates.

Natasha translates. Andy turns around to Billy and Karen standing

among the film crew members.

Billy answers in sign language.

The actress, still lying on the floor under the drape, nods her

head.

A man yells some orders in Russian. Billy walks to the actor

playing the murderer, sitting on a prop. She checks his blood

device. She takes the knife and plugs a tube coming from the man's

shirt on the knife's handle. She explains, by signs, how the knife

works, and he nods. Billy fixes something inside his shirt and he

reacts when Billy touches his stomach.

He smiles. Billy squeezes a small bag full of fake blood. She has

just taken that bag from the inside of the man's shirt. The actor

keeps on smiling and Billy doesn't seem to like the man's smile.

She puts the bag back inside the actor's shirt. Then Billy signs

her sister for her to come. Karen joins Billy, who explains to the

actor what he has to do, and Karen translates Billy's sign

language.

Natasha joins the group.

She mimes the squeezing movement while speaking. Natasha

translates in Russian. Karen nods her head. The actor says a few

words in Russian, nodding his head.

Billy looks at Natasha.

Billy smiles.

The actor laughs.

Lyosha, who actually is the assistant operator, is behind the

camera, near the camera operator. Andy sits down on his chair.

His Russian assistant, standing near the camera, with an open ring

binder in his hands, says a few words in Russian. We hear an angry

voice in the background.

On the dining room part of the set, where the young Russian

actress broke everything in sight, two men are trying to fix the

broken furniture. Another one, a tall man with a beard, talks very

angrily in Russian.

Andy, still seated on his chair, looks at his Russian assistant.

The angry bearded man speaks angrily in Russian.

Andy looks and listens at him and then turns toward his Russian

assistant, trying to speak, but is cut off twice by the angry

voice of the man.

The bearded Russian man walks away. Then he comes back and shows

his wristwatch, saying a few more angry words in Russian.

Andy looks up at his Russian assistant.

Andy stands up and slaps his thighs, looking very nervous.

The Russian assistant says a few words in Russian. Andy makes a

sign to the camera operator for him to come closer to him. The

operator joins Andy.

On another part of the set, behind the dining room, Billy kneels

down in front of a big ancient-looking wooden trunk.

On the lid of the trunk is written, in white large capital

letters : KEEP OUT ! BILLY'S BOX. Billy opens the trunk. Inside,

on the inside part of the lid, various props, and in the trunk

itself, a big square plastic bottle and, in a plastic box, plenty

of smaller bottles.

Behind   Billy, who is still kneeling in front of the trunk, we see

Lyosha   walking around. He looks at Billy, who feels she is being

looked   at. She turns around and looks at Lyosha. Natasha walks

toward   Billy.

Natasha kneels down to be at Billy's level.

Billy laughs.

Billy stands up and starts pulling the big heavy square plastic

bottle out of the trunk. Lyosha comes to help Billy pull the

bottle out of the trunk. They both slowly put the bottle down on

the floor. Billy looks up at Lyosha, who is smiling to her. Then

he walks away. Billy, kneeling on the floor, opens the bottle.

Karen walks in from behind the trunk. She leans on the open lid of

the trunk.

Billy is pouring a bag of sugar in the bottle.

Billy smiles.

Billy makes several language signs.

Billy looks at her sister.

Another part of the set, near the entrance of the set. The

building janitor, wearing a more or less official cap, just walked

in. Karen sees the janitor and waves at him. Billy looks in the

janitor's direction.

Billy waves at the janitor, who waves back at the girls. Then he

yells something in Russian. Billy and Karen look at each other.

They seem to understand what he says. Billy shows two finger to

him. The janitor says something in Russian and walks away.

The dining-room set. The young Russian actress is sitting on the

floor among the debris she has created and she is putting lipstick

on her lips, looking at her face in a small pocket mirror. Billy

walks in with a small plastic case in her hands. She sits on the

floor next to the actress and puts the box down beside her. She

takes the lipstick and the mirror away from the actress' hands,

and puts them down on the floor. Then she gives her a little piece

of white cotton to wipe the lipstick out of her lips. The actress

takes it and starts wiping her lips. Then Billy takes some make-up

to put it on the actress' face. A male hand puts a light meter

close to the actress' face.

A strong light starts playing on Billy's face, and we hear a

Russian voice who seems to come from a loudspeaker.

The upper part of the film set. Three big spotlights on a rack. An

electrician is playing with one of them.

Billy puts her hand above her eyes to try to locate who is sending

that strong light on her face.

The electrician says a few words in Russian.

The actress looks up to see who is talking.

Closer shot on the electrician sitting on the spotlight rack. He

is Arkadi, the man who was sitting next to the actor playing the

murderer, and who offered him a light for his cigarette. He speaks

in Russian with a queer smile on his face.

Natasha squats down near Billy and the actress, to speak to Billy.

Billy covers her eyes and looks up at the spotlight rack.

Arkadi smiles and winks to Billy.

Billy closes her plastic case.

The actress eats a piece of cake. She lies down on the floor.

Billy, using a pair of tweezers, puts something, which looks like

a cherry, out of a small bottle and into the actress' mouth.

Billy stands up and walks away.

The camera, and the group of people around it. Andy is sitting on

his director's chair, and Karen is kneeling on the other side of

the camera, writing on a clipboard. A clapperboard girl walks in

front of the camera, says a few words in Russian, claps her

clapperboard and walks away. We hear a loud noise, and most of the

spotlights are suddenly switched off. Andy looks up at the

spotlight racks.

Billy, standing in the half-dark set with her plastic case in

front of her, looks up around her as more spotlights are switched

off with loud noises.

Alex, who must be the assistant producer, walks toward Andy,

tapping his wristwatch.

Billy opens her arms in a gesture of despair.

All the people around Andy start leaving the set.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR EVENING

Night is coming. The sky is grey. In the background, a group of

people is coming out of a building.

Andy and Billy are crossing the parking lot. Cars are driving

around them : the film crew members are leaving the studio. Andy

waves his hand at one of them.

Andy and Billy come to a white car parked near a red car. Karen is

walking on the other side of the white car. She opens the driver's

door. Billy is standing near the red car, and looking for

something in her purse. She can't find it and looks disappointed.

She taps on the roof of her car.

Karen was ready to get inside her car, but, when she hears Billy's

tapping, she looks up. Billy explains something in sign language.

Andy doesn't understand and turns towards Karen

Andy claps his hands.

Billy starts walking away. Andy turns toward Karen.

Billy explains something in sign language.

She opens the door of her car. Andy turns around to face Billy.

Near Andy's car, Alex, the assistant producer we just saw on the

set, is opening the door of his car.

Alex has already opened the door of his car.

Andy sneers.

Andy opens the door, gets inside the car and closes the door.

CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR EVENING

Close up shot on a green hideous mask held with both hands by

Billy.

Around Biily, all the props used for the film she is working on,

or other films. Billy puts the green mask down. She looks around

for something. She throws away various masks she doesn't need.

Billy is kneeling near a large box used as a table. On the box

something is written in large capital Russian letters. Around

Billy, a lot of props are scattered around. Apparently, Billy

can't find what she is looking for, and sits back on her heels in

despair. She hears a loud noise. She sits up when she hears the

noise. She tries to figure out what that noise means. She stands

up and runs toward a window.

The sky is darker. The night is coming soon. Billy looks through

the window.

On the parking lot, seen trough the bars of the window, the

janitor is crossing the yard with his dog.

Billy opens the window and turns around, looking for something to

hit the metal bars of the window. She takes a spear from a suit of

armor. Then she bangs on the bars of the window with the long

handle of the spear.

On the parking lot, seen through the bars of the window, the

janitor keeps on walking around with his dog, apparently not

hearing the noise made by Billy. Then he closes the main door of

the studio parking lot.

Billy drops the spear on the floor and runs away from the window.

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

A large corridor. A door opens and Billy rushes out. She opens a

door at the end of the corridor and runs out.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

The gallery around the top of the set. A door opens and Billy runs

along the gallery.

At ground level, we see Billy coming down the stairs leading to

the gallery. Billy runs across the film set, which seems not to

have been used recently.

Billy reaches a heavy metal door and tries to open it... without

any success. She kicks it.

CINEMA STUDIO - ANOTHER ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The parking lot seen trough the heavy metal bars of a door. It is

darker than before and completely empty. Close-up shot on an big

padlock and a thick chain set across the bars of the door.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

We hear very loud rock music.

Close shot on the gas stove. Ground meat is cooking in a frying

pan. Chopped onions are being poured into another frying pan from

a wooden cutting board.

Andy is spraying some spices on the meat. He is wearing an apron

tied around his waist. He tastes his cuisine from a spoon. He is

bobbing up an down in rhythm with the music. Andy makes the round

spice rack spin around very fast and picks up a jar from the rack.

Then he pours spices from two different jars with both hands, in

rhythm with the music, miming a drummer beating his drums with his

sticks. Then he pours tomato sauce from a can into a saucepan. He

throws the empty can away.

He takes another spice jar. But the lid of the jar comes off, and

all the spices fall down into the meat. He puts the empty jar

down.

He takes the lid off the meat. We hear the phone ringing. Andy

lowers the volume of the music from the radio set hanging on the

wall. The phone is still ringing.

Andy takes the meat frying pan out of the stove to pour the meat

into the onions frying pan.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The kitchen seen from the dark living room. There is no door

between kitchen and living room, just a wide open arch. The phone

is still ringing. Andy turns around.

Andy puts the frying pan back on the stove and runs in the living-

room. He picks up the phone from a table.

CINEMA STUDIO - A ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close dark shot of Billy with the telephone handset to her ear.

She taps on the microphone of the handset. The telephone set is on

a small shelf fixed on the wall.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Even if the volume of the radio has been lowered, it is still loud

enough for Andy not to be able to hear Billy's tapping. A hissing

sound, coming from the kitchen, makes him turn around.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

On the stove, a big stew pot is hissing, and water is leaking

between the lid and the pot.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy takes the telephone set and runs toward the kitchen. But the

cord is a bit too short and is stretched tight just when he

reaches the kitchen. He drops the telephone set on the floor.

He tries to reach the stove control panel while still holding the

telephone handset to his ear.

highways. The camera pans to the right and reaches an high brick

building near the river.

Fade in to :

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

is off. We hear the waiting tone of the telephone.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is seated at the table, holding the telephone handset to her

ear. We still hear the waiting tone. The telephone set is beside

her on the table, where three candles are burning in three

candlesticks.

Full shot of the room, with Karen seated at the table, and Andy in

the kitchen in the background, still fixing dinner.

She shuts the telephone by pressing on the hook, still keeping the

handset to her ear. We ear the long tone of the telephone.

She dials another number.

CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT

There are no light, and the room is completely dark. We hardly see

a huge bear and a bat. The camera pans on the right, tilting

slightly down. The camera comes to Billy, seated behind a desk and

dialing on a telephone set. She puts the handset to her ear, but

only gets a busy tone. She puts the phone down on its hook.

Documents are scattered on the desk. A draught makes one of the

documents fly away. Billy looks surprised by what just happened.

Some more papers fly away. She looks on her right at a door with

frosted small window panes, which closes shut by itself.

On the top of the door, a small bell is ringing.

Billy looks at the door and stands up

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

A long dark corridor. A door opens on the right, ringing the small

bell. It's the door of Billy's workshop. Billy walks out of the

room. In the dark, we only see the dark outline of her figure. She

stops, not sure about where she is going to go next. Eventually,

she starts walking slowly. She stops again when she hears voices

speaking in Russian. Then she starts walking again.

A metal door with a notice hanging from the handle. Zoom on the

notice, on which something is written in Russian. Actually, it is

an elevator door.

CINEMA STUDIO - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy peeks from behind the elevator door to look at what is going

on down below.

High angle shot of the elevator shaft. We hear voices speaking in

Russian and we see some light at the bottom of the shaft, where

the cabin is.

Billy is still peeking into the elevator shaft. A draught is

waving her hair. She moves away.

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy closes the door of the elevator. She walks toward the

staircase, and starts walking downstairs. Through the open door of

the staircase, we see her stopping, because she just heard a faint

sound of a telephone ringing.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is still seated behind the table and listening to a

telephone which keeps on ringing without any answer. Andy walks

slowly toward the table, coming from the kitchen. Karen looks very

nervous. Suddenly we hear a clicking noise in the telephone.

Karen looks up at Andy.

Karen shushes Andy with her hand.

CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is holding the telephone next to her ear. She taps on the

microphone with her finger.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen has the telephone handset squeezed between her head and her

shoulder.

Andy turns around because he just heard a hissing noise in the

kitchen. He runs toward the stove.

In the kitchen, Andy tries to save his cooking.

Andy puts his frying pan down into a large white plastic can full

of water, where it starts hissing.

Karen shushes Andy with her hand.

Andy is getting his frying pan out of the plastic can.

While Karen is trying to understand her sister's message, Andy is

banging the frying pan on the side of the can, to get rid of

everything that was inside it.

She smiles.

In the kitchen, Andy looks at his empty frying pan.

CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy keeps on tapping on the microphone.

Billy taps again.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy throws the frying pan in the can of water, where it hisses

again. Karen looks at Andy, puts the telephone down and makes a

face.

CINEMA STUDIO - STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is running downstairs.

CINEMA STUDIO - A FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

The entrance of a film set. We hear some giggles. The door opens,

Billy enters and closes the door behind her.

In the background, spotlights are switched on above a scenery :

apparently, someone is shooting a film. Billy walks noiselessly

across the empty part of the set. As Billy comes closer to the lit

part of the set, we hear strange noises that sound like a woman

having an orgasm.

With Billy in the background, we see a camera with an operator

behind it.

On a bed, two actors are having sex. The female, a blonde woman,

is naked, the male has his pants down to his ankles and is wearing

a T-shirt and a white mask.

Billy looks slightly embarrassed by what she sees.

Close shot on the face of the camera operator, looking into the

viewfinder of his camera. He is Lyosha, the young man who was

courting Billy.

The blonde naked woman is moaning. She is a slightly plump woman

with hair too blonde to be true. She could be in her forties.

Billy, still looking slightly embarrassed, is also smiling.

The woman is faking a very strong orgasm.

The woman instantly stops faking her orgasm and gets up from the

bed. Lyosha talks in Russian to the woman, who is still lying on

the bed. Her lover, lying on the woman, is answering Lyosha in

Russian.

Lyosha looks back into his viewfinder.

We hear the woman, moaning again. Billy walks around the set.

Close shot on the face of the lover. He is wearing the mask

Billy has been looking for. In the background behind the man, we

see Billy, looking from behind an open window in the scenery.

Lyosha looks up from his viewfinder, then back again into it.

The woman's lover slaps her gently on the face, but keeps on

having sex with her. The man slaps her again but much harder this

time. She screams.

Billy looks surprised by what she sees.

The man holds the woman down on the bed with both hands. He slaps

her very hard several times and then hits her with his fist.

Billy closes her eyes, disgusted by what she sees. We hear the

woman being hit and screaming.

The woman seems very surprised by what is happening to her. The

man keeps on hitting her. She tries to cover her face from the

blows she is getting repeatedly.

Lyosha smiles, looking very happy with what is happening on the

set.

The woman tries to get the man away from her. She grabs his mask

and throws it away. Underneath the mask, the man has another black

very close-fitting fabric mask hiding his face, which could be a

black stocking. He grabs both her hands with one of his hands, and

holds them above her head. Then he takes a black strong ribbon

from under the bed and ties her hands with it. The woman is now

very frightened and tries to get free. The man slaps her very

hard.

Close shot on a pillow being lifted by the hand of the man. Under

the pillow, there is a long very sharp knife.

Billy can't believe what she sees.

The man takes the knife and slowly lifts the knife above his head.

Billy looks more and more frightened. She has tears in her eyes.

She is crying silently with her fist in her mouth.

The man start stabbing the woman. Her blood is splashing on the

wall and the man's T-shirt. The woman is covered with her own

blood.

Billy starts walking away from the window and across the set.

The woman doesn't seem to move anymore, but the man is still

stabbing her.

Billy walks backward across the set and she bumps into a hatstand

which falls down. Everything that was in the open purse hanging on

the hatstand - hairbrush, keys, lighter, make-up things, etc. -

falls on the floor. A plastic diskette-case skids on the floor and

slips under a big wooden wardrobe.

Lyosha, alerted by the noise, stands up from his camera.

Billy is kneeling on the floor near the fallen hatstand.

Lyosha goes back to his camera.

Billy, kneeling on the floor, puts everything back into the purse.

Then she stands up, puts the hatstand back on its legs and walks

away from it. She hides behind the large wooden wardrobe. Lyosha

walks slowly toward the place where Billy is hiding. Billy walks

away and Lyosha stops near the hatstand.

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

The long dark corridor. In the foreground on the left, the

staircase, the only part of the set where there is light

(apparently coming from the windows and the street lights). Billy

is running upstairs. She enters the corridor, where she starts

running, just when Lyosha appears in the staircase, running after

Billy. When he reaches the landing, Lyosha switches on the lights

in the corridor. Just before Lyosha enters the corridor, in the

background, we see Billy hiding in a nook, a small partition, in

the corridor.

Lyosha looks for her. Billy seems suddenly interested by something

up on the wall across from her. It is a sign for an emergency

exit. Billy looks in the direction the sign is pointing at. It is

the emergency exit.

Lyosha is coming toward Billy's hiding. He stops to listen for a

meaningful noise. He opens a door to look into a room. Billy peeks

from behind her hiding nook. She runs toward the emergency exit,

which is located toward the end of the long corridor.

The open door, and just behind it, Lyosha looking into the room.

He switches the light off, just as Billy reaches the emergency

exit. He walks out of the room, and closes slowly the door behind

him. He looks at the far end of the corridor.

He walks a couple of steps and stops. He turns around and says a

few words in Russian.

Billy is hiding behind a big red vending machine at the far end of

the corridor. Lyosha looks around him and Billy looks at the

emergency exit.

Close shot on the handle of the emergency door. Then the camera

pans on the left and stops on the red emergency box, with the door

key inside. Near the key, is posted a long notice in Russian.

Lyosha walks slowly toward Billy. He tries to open a door, but it

is locked. We hear him talking in Russian.

Billy is still hidden behind the red vending machine.

Lyosha keeps on walking slowly toward Billy.

Lyosha is looking at the far end of the corridor. He crosses

toward a door.

He opens the door and walks inside the room.

Billy peeks cautiously from behind the machine, and sees the open

door. She runs toward the emergency exit. She breaks the glass

with her hand and grabs the key.

Billy runs back toward the vending machine, behind which she hides

again.

Lyosha walks out of the room, leaving the door open, and looks at

the far end of the corridor.

Billy is still hidden behind the vending machine. Lyosha is coming

toward her. Billy moves slowly along the wall, keeping her back as

close as possible of the wall. She opens a door and enters a dark

room. She closes the door behind her.

Lyosha reaches the vending machine, and starts running toward the

emergency exit. He stops near the emergency box with its broken

glass. He looks inside the emergency box. His finger comes out of

the box, with the tip covered with Billy's blood. He tries to open

the emergency door, which is locked.

CINEMA STUDIO - STORE ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

A dark store room, with large windows. The door opens and Lyosha

walks in. He runs to the window. He looks outside, but seeing

nothing significant, he turns around and walks a couple of steps

inside the room. He stops and looks around. He starts walking

again across the room. Suddenly something catches his eye.

Close shot on the bottom of a long drape. There is a thin space

between the bottom of the drape and the floor. And on this thin

space, the tip of a shoe is showing. Lyosha walks slowly toward

the drape. He pulls the drape open with a very quick movement.

Several racks of shoes were actually hidden by the drape.

CINEMA STUDIO - BILLY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT

A door opens in the back of the room and Billy walks in the room.

There is some light coming from the door. Billy walks to the main

door of the room and opens it. She raises her arm and grabs the

bell at the top of the door to silence it. She walks out of the

room.

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

The long corridor. The lights are still on. Billy walks out of her

workshop and closes the door. She starts running along the

corridor toward the emergency exit. She suddenly stops, when she

hears a door opening. She runs back toward the staircase and hides

near the entrance of the staircase. In the background, we see

Lyosha coming out of a room. The camera pans toward the staircase

and Billy. A door opens on the floor below, and the large shadow

of a man is projected on the wall of the staircase. Billy runs on

the other side of the landing, while the man starts climbing the

stairs. He is Arkadi, the electrician working on Andy's film, and

the one who was playing with a spotlight on Billy's face. He is

bare-chested, which makes us believe he was the poor actress'

murderer. He reaches the landing and stops.

Billy is still hiding in a dark corner. She sees Arkadi coming on

the landing.

Lyosha is coming to meet Arkadi. They speak in Russian.

Billy looks at the two men, then she moves silently away from

them. She reaches the door of the elevator, which is supposed to

be out of order, and opens it. She puts the key of the emergency

exit door in her mouth, and start climbing down the elevator shaft

emergency ladder.

CINEMA STUDIO - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy climbs down the emergency ladder, trying not to miss the

steps.

Her face is now on the level of the bottom of the door of the

elevator. There is a small gap between the bottom of the door and

the floor, which enables Billy to peek at what is going on in the

corridor.

A shoe appears in the gap between the door and the floor.

Close shot on the small window at the top of the elevator door.

Arkadi's face appears in the window. He looks around inside the

elevator shaft.

Billy is not in front of the gap anymore, but hiding in the dark.

She puts the key in front of the gap.

Arkadi tries to open the door of the elevator. But it is locked.

The blood on his hand proves that Arkadi was actually the poor

actress' murderer. Through the small window, he looks around in

the shaft.

Billy tries not to be seen through the gap.

Arkadi still looks around in the shaft. He turns his head to talk

in Russian to Lyosha.

Billy has got the key back between her teeth. We hear the two men

talking in Russian.

Arkadi's face moves away from the window. Some lights are switched

off, making the window slightly darker.

Billy moves away from the wall of the shaft and falls. She catches

the elevator cables.

Close shot on Billy's face. She is holding the cables. She makes a

face because of the pain. She doesn't have the key in her mouth

anymore.

Close shot on a concrete ledge somewhere along the shaft. The

emergency door key drops on it, then moves away from it.

Billy is trying to climb back up to the door.

We see the elevator cabin at the bottom the shaft, and Billy in

the foreground, trying to climb back up. There is some light in

the cabin. We hear some strange noise in the shaft. Billy looks

down at where the noise is coming from.

Close shot on the key, seen through the chicken wire roof of the

cabin, and resting on the floor of the cabin.

Billy, still holding the cables, starts going slowly down. She

misses a step but holds on the cables. She keeps on going down the

shaft. She eventually reaches the roof of the cabin. We hear

muffled voices talking in Russian.

Billy sits down on the roof of the cabin to rest a little. Through

the chicken wire that covers the roof of the cabin, she sees the

key on the floor of the cabin. She tries to open a panel in the

chicken wire. It is stuck but she eventually succeeds in opening

it. She moves the panel on its hinges and rests it against the

wall. We still hear the muffled voices talking in Russian. Billy

starts climbing down in the opening in the chicken wire.

Billy drops down on the floor of the cabin. The front door of the

cabin is wide open showing the well lit store room in front of the

cabin. But the cabin is not completely at the same level as the

room : it is slightly higher. We hear banging noises in the

background.

Billy looks at the room and is suddenly frightened by something.

She stands up and looks up at the roof of the cabin. She climbs

back toward the roof. We see Lyosha in the room, walking toward

the elevator.

Lyosha is coming closer, carrying a large plastic trash bag on his

shoulder. When he reaches the elevator, he takes the bag down from

his shoulder, and drops it in the gap between the bottom of the

cabin and the floor of the room. The plastic bag drops down to the

bottom of the shaft.

Billy, lying on the roof of the cabin, is looking through the

chicken wire.

Arkadi is walking toward the elevator, carrying a bag on his

shoulder, and pulling another one on the floor.

Close shot on the key, which was not actually on the floor of the

cabin, but on the floor of the room, just outside the cabin. The

plastic bag, pushed by Arkadi under the cabin, pushes the key in

the gap.

Lyosha and Arkadi are standing just outside the cabin. Lyosha is

pushing another bag in the gap. The two men then walk away from

the cabin.

Billy climbs down from the roof of he cabin and stands up on the

cabin floor. Seeing Lyosha, she squats down, but Lyosha walks

away.

Billy climbs out of the cabin. Then she enters the gap and starts

climbing down the shaft, using the emergency ladder.

The bottom of the shaft is full of plastic bags and various

debris. Billy reaches the bottom and steps on the bags. She kneels

down and starts searching for her key. Suddenly, we hear a very

loud noise. Billy, startled by the noise, stands up.

Lyosha is looking through the gap at the bottom of the shaft. He

turns around and talks in Russian to Arkadi.

Billy is hiding among the plastic bags.

Lyosha is still calling Arkadi.

He talks to him in Russian.

Arkadi comes near Lyosha with a powerful flashlight, and, with it,

he looks into the bottom of the shaft. The light from the

flashlight is playing on the bags.

Close shot of Billy's face, hidden among the bags. The light moves

near Billy's face, then moves to a transparent bag, near Billy,

with a head inside. Billy looks up at the bag. She screams

noiselessly. Suddenly she turns around, because she has seen

something else.

Close shot of the emergency door key, lying among the debris,

brightly lit by Arkadi's flashlight.

Arkadi walks away from the elevator, followed by Lyosha. Before

leaving, they close the outside door of the elevator. After the

door has been closed shut, the elevator shaft becomes completely

dark.

Billy slowly comes out of the bags. She takes the key. Then she

slowly stands up, puts the key in the pocket of her sleeveless

jacket and starts climbing the emergency ladder along the wall of

the shaft. She climbs just a few step to reach the first door, the

basement door.

Close shot of the small window on the door of the elevator, seen

from outside the shaft. Billy's face appears in the window. The

basement is completely dark.

Billy tries to open the door, but it is locked. She bangs on it

with her hand. Then she shakes it violently. She looks up, on the

verge of tears. She sighs. Then she hears some steps.

Arkadi is coming carrying a powerful lamp.

Billy looks very frightened. The light from the lamp plays on her

face.

Billy moves away from the door.

CINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT

Arkadi walks away in the basement. Billy slowly comes out of the

elevator door and runs away in the opposite direction from Arkadi.

She hides behind a pillar, because she sees Arkadi's lamp in the

background. Arkadi is coming back, and Billy moves around the

pillar to be hidden from Arkadi's eyes. Arkadi stops near the

elevator. He opens the elevator's door.

Billy runs away. She trips on something and makes a little noise.

She stops.

Arkadi, coming out of the elevator, looks in Billy's direction.

Billy opens a door and walks out.

Arkadi slowly walks away from the elevator door.

The door closes smoothly behind Billy.

CINEMA STUDIO - STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is walking rapidly upstairs.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

The door of the set opens and Billy walks in. She walks slowly

through the set, looking around her. Suddenly, the big spotlights

are switched on one by one.

In the electricians' control cabin, we see Lyosha switching the

lights on. More spotlights are switched on.

Billy is running around on the set, trying to avoid the lights.

She reaches the scenery and jumps out of one of the scenery

windows.

A searchlight, controlled by Lyosha. The searchlight is following

Billy.

Billy tries to avoid the searchlight. She runs away toward the

exit of the set. She meets Arkadi coming back on the set, but she

keeps on running.

Billy starts climbing a ladder, but before climbing, she pushes a

heavy piece of furniture to block the bottom of the ladder. The

piece of furniture falling down makes other props fall down.

Arkadi starts moving the props out of his way. He reaches the

bottom the ladder.

He starts climbing the ladder, turning his head around to yell :

In the electricians' control cabin, hearing his name, Lyosha looks

outside the cabin.

He says a few words in Russian.

A gallery near the ceiling of the set. Billy is running along the

gallery.

The other side of the door, opening on a small gallery leading to

the emergency ladders set along the exterior wall of the building.

The door is been violently pushed open by Lyosha. With Lyosha's

violent push, Billy falls backward, above the balcony of the

gallery and down on the yard below.

Billy falls on her back on a huge pile of used film metal boxes.

Lyosha bends over the balcony and looks down at Billy.

Billy is lying among the boxes and moves her head.

A blurred dark picture with lights dancing around. It is what

Billy's eyes are seeing when she tries to focus after her fall.

She sees the blurred picture of Lyosha running down the emergency

ladder along the wall of the building.

looks up.

Karen appears at the corner of the building, looking around.

Karen runs toward them.

foreground. She bends over her.

Lyosha looks up at the gallery where Billy fell from.

Karen yells in Andy's direction.

Billy is trying to say something to her sister.

Lyosha shrugs his shoulders and makes a face that means he doesn't

know what Billy is talking about.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

This the set where the poor actress was brutally murdered.

Billy is seated between Karen and Andy. She has a disoriented look

on her face, and a blanket is wrapped around her shoulders. Karen

is tenderly stroking Billy's shoulder. We hear some laughing and

people talking in Russian.

Lyosha and Arkadi are talking to an uniformed Russian policeman,

who seems to be in charge of the inquiry. Consequently, he will

be, from now on, mentioned as First Policeman

The other policeman (who shall be mentioned as Second Policeman)

is kneeling down, looking at something on the floor, and the

janitor is standing in a corner with his dog on a leash.

Lyosha, Arkadi and the first policeman are still talking together.

They slowly walk toward the rest of the group. The second

policeman, who was still kneeling down, stands up.

Billy is listening to Lyosha, apparently trying to lip-read and

understand what he says. Lyosha turns toward her.

The two uniformed policemen are listening to Lyosha.

Lyosha and Arkadi both laugh.

The janitor is trying to follow the conversation. We hear a

policeman talking in Russian.

Arkadi answers in Russian.

Arkadi must have said something funny, because the policemen are

laughing.

Lyosha and Arkadi look at Billy.

Billy doesn't look at Arkadi, but Karen does.

Back to Lyosha and Arkadi

Billy taps on Karen's arm. Karen looks up at Arkadi.

The first policeman looks at the paper he is holding in his hand.

Billy stands up and, pointing her finger, shows where she was

during the murder.

showing. The second policeman moves away and the first one looks

at his paper.

He points at Arkadi.

Billy, seated again, points at Arkadi.

Lyosha looks at Arkadi.

Billy, who understands something wrong is going on with Arkadi,

stamps her feet.

Karen gives the film to the first policeman.

Arkadi is walking slowly with something that looks like a knife in

his hand. We hear Billy clapping her hands. Andy turns around to

look at Billy.

Billy points to Arkadi and tries to explain something in sign

language.

Karen looks at Billy.

Arkadi grabs Andy and pushes him against the wall.

Karen screams.

Arkadi stabs Andy in the stomach with his knife. Andy screams. He

has blood on his cheek. Arkadi keeps on stabbing Andy.

The first policeman takes his gun out of his belt.

Both policemen grab Arkadi from behind. They pull him away from

Andy. They have both drown their guns.

Karen rushes toward Andy, whose shirt is covered with blood.

Karadi, still restrained by the two policemen, is yelling in

Russian.

Arkadi drops his knife, and it remains attached to his wrist by a

plastic tube. Actually, it was a fake prop knife.

Andy stutters, trying to explain something to Karen.

Karadi shows the knife to the policemen. He makes the retractable

blade work, to prove it is harmless.

Billy walks to her trunk and notices that the padlock on the lid

has been broken. She opens the trunk. She takes the fake blood can

out of the trunk : it is almost empty.

The policemen taste the fake blood.

Billy stamps her foot. They all turn toward her. She explains

something in sign language.

Billy keeps on talking in sign language. Karen translates.

Billy keeps on talking in sign language. Karen translates.

of them are carrying torches. Billy is still wrapped in the

blanket.

They reach the elevator and Arkadi opens the door. The first

policeman points his torch in the bottom of the elevator shaft.

The dog barks. The janitor tries to calm it down. There are many

plastic trash bags scattered in the bottom of the shaft. The first

policeman talks in Russian to the second one. Apparently, he asks

him to go down to the bottom of the shaft and look at the bags.

The second policeman doesn't look very happy to do it.

But he does go down in the shaft, and starts looking into the

bags. He even pours the content of the first one out of the bag.

But there are only trashes in the bag.

Arkadi and Lyosha look at each other.

The second policeman finds a bloody sheet in a bag.

Lyosha talks to him in Russian. And the first policeman apparently

tells him to do what Lyosha just asked

yard and the parking lot around the building. Arkadi is leading

them.

plastic trash containers where all the trashes from the studio are

dropped off, waiting for the garbage collectors to take them away.

The second policeman raises the lid of a container, while the

first policeman looks inside. Arkadi takes a bag out of another

container and drops it on the ground. The second policeman looks

inside the bag with his flashlight. There seems to be a head

inside the bag. The policeman pours the content of the bag on the

ground. Actually the head was just a mask !

He picks up the mask from the rubbish. He wipes it with his hand.

The first policeman gives his card to both Billy and Karen.

She laughs.

Karen looks at Billy.

A very short flash-back sequence of the murder of the actress.

Another very short flash-back. We understand those short flash-

backs come from Billy's mind reliving what she saw a couple of

hours before.

Karen, looking at Billy, seems to understand what's going on

inside her sister's head, because she says to Andy :

More short flash-backs of the murder, and a close-up shot on

Billy's face. She seems very disturbed.

CINEMA STUDIO - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT

The janitor is patrolling the basement with his dog. He is

carrying an electric torch.

He checks a heavy metal door, which is closed.

While he is checking the door, the dog runs away.

The janitor looks around him.

He is apparently calling his dog, but he gets no answer. He starts

looking around.

He reaches the door of the incinerator. We hear the noise of the

incinerator, and we see its light on the janitor's face. The

janitor seems surprises that the incinerator is working so late in

the night. We hear the dog whining.

The janitor enters the incinerator room. He walks slowly around

until he reaches the incinerator. The incinerator door is slightly

open. He looks inside.

blood.

Arkadi walks toward the janitor.

Arkadi raises something we don't clearly see (a knife ?) above his

head and hit the janitor, still lying on the floor.

A RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up shot of a knife hitting a beefsteak. The directors's idea

was, of course, to give us the impression that it was Arkadi's

knife hitting the poor janitor !

Larger shot of the steak being cut into the plate. We hear some

soft music.

Karen and Andy are seated, side by side, at a table in a

restaurant, with Billy sitting on the other side of the table.

suddenly a bit worried too.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The chimney of the studio seen from the parking lot in a low-angle

shot. A lot of black smoke is coming out of it, certainly from the

incinerator.

Lyosha is smoking on the ramp leading to the basement, and he,

like the chimney, exhales a lot of smoke, but white one !

The door of the basement opens and Arkadi walks out. There seems

to be a lot of smoke in the basement too. He coughs. Lyosha throws

him a pack of cigarettes, which he catches. He spits, takes a

cigarette out of the pack and lights it.

Two cars are coming toward them. The fist one is a large black

limousine.

Lyosha picks up a small plastic bag.

The cars stop near the ramp. Arkadi and Lyosha walk toward them. A

man gets out of the front passenger door of the second car. He is

Wartschuk, the Big Boss' first assistant. He closes the door and

walks toward Lyosha and Arkadi. Lyosha gives him the plastic bag.

The man says a few words in Russian and nods toward the limousine.

He walks away, but Lyosha doesn't move.

A man is sitting in the back of the limousine, his face hidden in

the dark. He is called The Reaper and he is the famous Big

Boss of the whole criminal organization, and consequently of

Arkadi and Lyosha.

Lyosha starts walking slowly toward the car.

The Reaper bends slightly, so his face appears in the light.

The Reaper winds his car window up. Then he sits back in his seat.

sister, who blows one back, and enters her building.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

A long corridor. In the foreground, the two uniformed policemen,

who took care of Billy's case, are sitting on a wooden bench. The

second policeman is asleep. The first policeman stands up when he

sees a group of three people, a woman in white coat (like a nurse)

and two men in suit and tie, coming toward them. The first

policeman wakes up the second policeman, who stands up.

One of the men is Mr. Larsen, a high-rank police officer, the

other one is Mr Lovett, the US ambassador's secretary.

The woman in white shows the two policemen to Larsen, then walks

away. Larsen takes his hat off.

He shakes hands with the two policemen.

Lovett shakes hands with the two policemen.

After Larsen's answer, there is a slight embarrassed silence

between the two men. Fortunately for them, a door opens and a man

in white coat walks out of a room, carrying a film box under his

arm. He talks to Larsen in Russian, and shows him the room where

they have to go. Larsen shows the room to Lovett.

They all follow the technician.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The door of the projection room opens and Lovett enters, followed

by Larsen.

The two policemen enters behind them. Larsen shows a seat to

Lovett. The projection room looks like a small cinema theatre,

with rows of red seats.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up shot on the gas flames of the water heater.

Billy is getting ready to take a bath. She is just wearing a bath

towel wrapped around her body. With her hand, she tests the

temperature of the bath water. She pours some bubble-bath from a

big bottle into the water. We hear the telephone ringing. Billy

turns her head toward the living-room

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The apartment is a bit ancient-looking. It doesn't look like

Billy. One can tell it is only a rented apartment for a short

period. Various clothes are scattered around the room.

Billy walks from the bathroom along the corridor to the living-

room. The telephone keeps on ringing.

The telephone and the special answering machine are set on a small

table. Billy picks up the telephone handset and puts it on the

machine. Then she sits down on a chair and puts a pair of earphone

on her ears. Finally, she presses a button on the machine.

Close up shot on the screen of the machine. It looks a bit like a

computer screen. The machine offers the choice between different

sentences :

Billy chooses the second choice, using a ball-mat. Then she brings

the arrow on an icon to start the machine.

Momentarily, the scene is seen through a binocular, which makes us

realize that Billy is been spied by someone.

Billy, apparently getting no answer but a deep breathing noise,

chooses the first choice.

A shot on the large bay window makes us guess where the spy is

hiding : somewhere across the street.

Billy keeps on trying to get an answer.

But she gets only a disconnection tone. She takes the earphone out

of her ears, and puts them on the table. She looks at the window.

Shot on the window, with a zoom on another window across the

street. Behind that window, we see the figure of a man looking at

Billy with binoculars.

Billy seen through the neighbor's binoculars. She walks to the

window and pull the drapes to hide the window.

The spy sees the drapes being pulled through his binoculars.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The same men are still in the projection room. The first policeman

has taken his cap off. And Larsen is now seated in a seat behind

Lovett.

Lovett looks very disturbed by what Larsen just told him. The

technician knocks on the window between his cabin and the room.

Larsen and Lovett turn around, and Larsen makes a sign to tell the

technician to start the film. Then he takes a cigarette from the

pack he left on his former seat. The room becomes dark and the

projection starts. The four men watch the film which has no sound.

On the screen of the projection room, we see the sequence when the

young actress, pretending she is dying very slowly, breaks the

whole set.

Lovett and Larsen turn their head toward the cabin.

The technician is also watching the film through the window

between the two rooms. When he sees Larsen looking at him, he

shrugs to tell him that he is not responsible for what is shown on

the screen.

POLICE HEADQUARTERS - PROJECTION ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen and Lovett turn back to watch the screen.

On the screen, the sequence when the young actress is pulling the

tablecloth away from the table, and also everything that was on

the table.

The two policemen are smiling because they find what they see on

the screen quite funny.

Lovett and Larsen do not smile, because they are disappointed.

Now, on the screen, the actress is pulling the drapes down from

the windows.

Andy is smiling, but Karen still has a worried look on her face.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

High-angle shot of the room, seen from the ceiling. Billy is lying

in her bathtub, surrounded by foam and bubbles. Her eyes are

closed. She slowly puts her head underwater, and leaves just her

face above water.

One of the faucet is leaking and water is dropping from it.

One of the glass panes is broken and fixed with adhesive tape and

newspaper.

He eyes closed, Billy has her daydreams flashbacks again. She sees

the actress' blood spurting on the wall of the scenery. She sees

her being stabbed. She sees herself running away from Lyosha in

the long dark corridor.

Suddenly, she feels drops of blood on her face. And, opening her

eyes, she sees the bloody actress behind the broken glass pane.

She quickly sits up in her bath. She looks at the window, which is

empty. She hears the phone ringing. She stands up in her bath and

takes her bath towel to dry herself.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The landing, just outside Billy's apartment front door, is dark

and empty.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy, still looking in the peephole, moves her head from right to

left, trying to see further on the landing. She slowly moves away

from the door to a small table by the door.

Close up shot on the table, and a business card lying on it. It is

the first policeman's card. It says : Police Inspector Vladimir

Pekar - Precinct 22 and underneath an address and a telephone

number.

Billy is still standing near the door. She puts the safety chain

on. And then she slowly opens the door. Arkadi appears behind the

door. Billy tries to shut the door, but he puts his foot between

the door and the wall.

Desperately, Billy tries to push the door shut.

Close up on the earphones on the machine keyboard.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

He lies back in the bed.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is trying to push the door shut. Arkadi has a big wire-

cutter in his hand. He brings the cutter near the chain. Billy

takes an umbrella from the stand near the door, and, with it,

tries to prevent Arkadi from cutting the chain. Arkadi cuts the

tip of the umbrella off. With her slippered foot, Billy kicks

Arkadi's foot still jamming the door, but it doesn't move it off.

Then she takes the heavy metal umbrella stand and hits Arkadi's

foot with it. Arkadi removes his foot from the door. Billy can -

at last - slam the door shut. She leans on it, panting.

KAREN AND ANDY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is now very frightened. She yells in the phone.

She puts the phone down and stands up from the bed.

Andy sits up on the bed.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy is still leaning on the door, panting. We hear the noise of

an electric machine. Billy's eyes widen with horror. She rushes to

the telephone, and starts typing frenetically.

Close up shot on the door lock. We can guess that Arkadi is trying

to open the door with a power tool.

Billy puts her earphone on. She hears the disconnection tone. She

presses the disconnection switch on her own telephone.

Close up shot on the door lock. One of the screws holding the lock

pops off and falls on the floor.

Billy is listening to a Russian-speaking female voice in her

earphones. She types on her keyboard.

She sends her message.

A few word in Russian and then, more distinctly :

Billy types Yes.

Getting a Russian answer, she types Da

Billy chooses a pre-recorded message, and sends it.

Close up on the lock : another screw just pops off. The telephone

operator keeps on speaking in Russian, apparently not listening to

Billy's message. We hear the power tool working again on the lock.

Billy takes her earphones off and rushes out of the room.

The operator speaks in Russian, certainly to another operator.

Billy types another message.

Billy takes her earphones off and rushes to the light switch. She

puts all the lights of the room at their maximum lighting

capacity.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM WINDOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT

We see Billy's living room window from the outside. Billy is

pulling the drapes wide open. Then she starts waving her arms to

attract the attention of the peeping-Tom and his binoculars.

Reverse angle shot on the window where the peeping-Tom was

standing when he was watching Billy. There is light coming through

the window and someone is moving in the room behind the curtains,

but the peeping-Tom doesn't seem interested by Billy at the

moment.

Back to Billy's window. She unties her bathrobe and shows her

breasts.

The peeping-Tom is still moving in the room behind the curtains,

but he doesn't come to the window.

Billy is standing in front of the window, with her bathrobe wide

open, revealing her naked body to whomever wants to watch it !

Close up on the lock. Another screw is vibrating and pops off. We

see the drill bit coming through the hole it just made.

Billy hears a male voice coming from her earphones.

Billy picks up the earphones and put them on her ears.

The door burst open and Arkadi walks into the room. Billy picks up

her big kitchen knife and points it to Arkadi.

Arkadi presses the light switch to dim the lights in the room.

Close up shot on the earphones.

Arkadi is walking slowly inside the room. Billy is walking

backward away from him, but still pointing her knife at him.

Arkadi tears the telephone cord off the telephone handset. He

tries to get near Billy, but she is still pointing her knife at

him. He pulls the drapes back on the window.

Walking backward, Billy has reached the wall, in which she bumps.

She takes a white statuette on a chest of drawers and throws it at

Arkadi.

Arkadi bends down and avoid the statuette, which crashes on the

wall behind him. He takes his own knife out of his pocket, a

switchblade knife.

Billy pushes the chest of drawers toward Arkadi. It crashes on the

floor, but Arkadi avoids it. Billy is still pointing her knife at

Arkadi, when we hears some bumping noise.

APARTMENT BELOW BILLY'S - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

In the bedroom just underneath Billy's apartment, a Russian couple

is trying to get some sleep, which, with all the noise in Billy's

apartment, is not very easy.

The woman is still in the bed, but the man is standing up on the

floor, holding a broom with both hands, and hitting the ceiling

with the handle of the broom. Both members of the couple swear in

Russian.

keys.

Billy rushes out of the room, closing the door behind her.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy rushes into the kitchen. She takes various knives hanging

from the wall and throws them at Arkadi, as he tries to enter the

kitchen. One knife gets stuck into a painting on the other side of

the corridor. Arkadi almost catches Billy, but she jumps through a

sort of window set between the kitchen and the living-room.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Billy stands up after her jump through the window, and she slams

the door of the corridor in Arkadi's face. This door being a sort

of French window, with plenty of small glass panes on it, Arkadi

crashes through the door, scattering pieces of glass all over the

floor. He falls on the floor. Billy slips on a piece of glass and

also falls on the floor. Arkadi tries to catch her by the ankles.

She kicks him in the face. He grabs her ankles back. Billy grabs a

big white vase from the floor, she sits up and crashes the vase on

Arkadi's head. Arkadi lets her go, and she rushes to the front

door, but, as she reaches the door, Lyosha comes in. She rushes to

the corridor. Arkadi, still a bit groggy, looks at Lyosha with

blinking eyes.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Same high-angle shot, as before, of the bathroom seen from the

possible escape.

She opens the door of the small cabinet above the sink, and takes

everything out of it

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up shot on the bathroom door. Arkadi has put his knife

inside the lock of the bathroom door to open it.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close up shot on the door. We see the handle of the lock spinning

slowly.

Billy, still looking in the cabinet, sees the handle spinning. She

rushes to the door and spins the handle back into the lock

position. A knife blade comes through the door a few inches from

Billy's face. Billy goes back to the cabinet and starts searching

it again. Eventually she seems to have found what she was looking

for : a small disposable razor.

The door is shaking under Arkadi's blows. Eventually his hand

breaks through the door and tries to find the handle of the door.

Billy picks up the toilet brush (the handle of which is a Donald

Duck), and hits Arkadi's hand with it. But the door starts falling

down under Arkadi's blows. Billy looks through the hole Arkadi has

made in the door with his hand.

Through the hole, we can see Arkadi going to the end of the

corridor, and running back full speed to smash the door.

At the last moment, when Arkadi is going to hit the door, Billy

opens it. Arkadi can't stop himself, he crosses the bathroom and

falls into the full bathtub. Billy hits him on the head with the

Donald Duck toilet brush. Then Billy takes the hair-drier, switch

it on, and throws it in the bathtub. Arkadi is instantly covered

with blue sparks. Then he falls back into the bathtub where he

remains motionless. Billy grabs a bunch of clothes and rushes out

of the bathroom.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Lyosha is looking through Billy's documents scattered on the desk.

When Billy comes rushing through the room, he grabs her. She tries

to fight him but he locks both of her arms behind her back. He

brings her to the desk, and slams her face on the desk. He puts a

knife very close to her face.

He puts a piece of paper and a pen in front of her face. He frees

her right hand for her to be able to write.

Billy takes the pen and starts writing.

Close up shot on the paper. Billy writes : What diskette ?

Lyosha raises Billy's bathrobe above her waist, revealing Billy

naked bottom underneath.

Billy looks very frightened, afraid of what Lyosha can do to a

defenseless naked girl. She takes the pen very firmly in her hand

and brings it violently to Lyosha's leg.

Close up shot of the pen hitting Lyosha's leg.

Lyosha screams. He raises his knife to bring it down on Billy.

Billy is waiting for the worse to happen. She hears the noise of

something - or someone - falling violently on the floor. And

suddenly, she realizes she is free. She raises from the table and

sees Larsen holding Arkadi's big wire-cutter in his hands. He just

hit Lyosha with it. Larsen throws the wire-cutter on the floor and

bends on Billy.

Larsen goes to the window and peeks through the drapes.

Billy rushes to her clothes she had dropped on the floor when

Lyosha grabbed her. She sits down on the floor and starts putting

her socks on.

He is still peeking through the drapes.

He gathers the rest of Billy's clothes, takes her hand to makes

her stand up, and drags her outside the apartment.

STREET IN FRONT OF BILLY'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen and Billy are coming out of the building.

Larsen's car is parked just in front of the building. Larsen opens

the passenger's door for Billy, who climbs inside the car. Then he

walks around the car, open the driver's door and climbs inside. He

starts the engine.

A big black limousine, with two men inside, starts and follows

Larsen's car, which has just started. The driver is Wartschuk,

whom we have seen before with The Reaper, and who is The Reaper's

first assistant.

LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen gives a quick look in the rear-view mirror.

We see the headlights of the other car through the back window of

the car.

Billy resumes her dressing. When she puts her white sweater on,

without a bra, her breasts are showing. Larsen gives a quick

glance toward her, and then turns his head away. Billy looks back

at him, smiles and kisses him on the cheek.

Billy puts her jacket on. Larsen looks in the back-view mirror.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen and Andy enter the apartment and stop when they see the mess

around them. We realize that it was really them and not some

gangsters going up in the elevator.

Karen rushes through the room. Andy remains on the doorstep.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is running through the corridor.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

has been cut.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy is still trying to get a dialing tone

Behind Andy, the front door is closing slowly, revealing Lyosha

standing behind it. He has the big wire-cutter in his hand, and is

ready to hit Andy with it. Andy looks at the cut cord, but doesn't

realize the telephone can't work with a cut cord.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen enters the bathroom

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

We hear Karen screaming. Andy puts the telephone down on the table

and rushes across the room

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is coming out of the bathroom, screaming.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy walks toward the corridor, but Karen meets him at the door.

She doesn't finish her sentence, because she has just seen Lyosha

behind Andy. She grabs Andy and moves him out of the way of

Lyosha's wire-cutter. The wire-cutter smashes what is left of the

door of the corridor.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy and Karen run and enter a room, presumably Billy's bedroom,

and slam the door behind them.

Lyosha looks at the door, and doesn't even bother to smash it. He

slowly walks back to the living room. We hear Karen and Andy's

voices in the room.

Lyosha enters the living-room through what remains of the door.

APARTMENT BELOW BILLY'S - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The man, seated on his bed, stares at the ceiling, through which

we can hear Andy and Karen yelling. His wife has put the sheet

over her head to try not to hear the noise. The man stands up and

throws one of his slippers to the ceiling. Then he sits back,

while his wife stares at him.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Lyosha sits down in an armchair and takes a pack of cigarettes out

of his pocket. But he doesn't take a cigarette. He gives a quick

look at the front door, and closes his eyes, ready to fall asleep.

The front door bursts open, and two uniformed policemen enters the

room, guns in hand. Lyosha looks at them without moving from his

chair, with a sort of look of indifference in his eyes. He shows

them the corridor, where we can still hear Andy and Karen yelling

in the bedroom. From Lyosha's attitude, we can guess that those

policemen are not real ones, but fake ones.

The two fake policemen cross the room.

Lyosha doesn't even look at them. He just smiles. Before going

through the smashed door into the corridor, one of the policeman

nods to his colleague, who takes his gun from his holster, aims,

and sends a bullet through Lyosha's head, whose blood splatters

the wall. The gun is equipped with a silencer, and doesn't make

much noise. Then the policeman goes through the smashed door to

join his colleague.

LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

While driving, Larsen talks to Billy.

Billy nods in approval.

Billy mouth a word we can easily understand.

Billy is trying to think about the lost diskette.

BILLY'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy and Karen are kneeling on the floor, with their hands joined

behind their heads. One of the fake policeman is searching the

room, throwing everything off the shelves on the floor, while the

other one is aiming his gun at Andy and Karen. He is leaning on

the piano, and he throws all the objects, which are on top of the

piano, on the floor. He raises briefly the piano lid, and then

starts looking behind the picture hanging on the wall.

The policeman picks up a diskette he had thrown on the floor and

looks at it.

Karen hits Andy with her elbow. The policeman puts the diskette

into a small white plastic bag he is carrying around. He puts

another diskette in the bag. The other policeman is speaking in

Russian in a walkie-talkie.

the bed. Then another one of the blood splattering the wall. Then

another one of Arkadi stabbing the girl.

Another short flashback of Billy going away from the   set. Then

another one of Billy bumping into the hatstand. Then   another one

of the girl's purse contents scattered on the floor.   Then another

one of the diskette skidding on the floor and hiding   under the

large wooden wardrobe.

Billy grabs Larsen's shoulder.

Billy takes a notepad and starts writing on it. But she is

interrupted by a Russian voice coming from somewhere in the car.

Larsen opens the glove compartment and takes a walkie-talkie out

of it. He talks in Russian in the talkie.

Billy looks at the pair of handcuffs in the glove compartment.

Larsen puts the talkie back in the compartment.

They drive along a police station, but Larsen doesn't stop. Billy

looks a bit worried all of sudden.

One of the fake policeman picks up his talkie from the table

The policeman answers Da, then listen to Wartschuk speaking in

Russian. He says Da again and a few more words. Karen and Andy

look at him, with a worried look on their face. Wartschuk answers

him. Apparently, Andy understood a few words, because he says :

The policeman drops the talkie on the table and talks to his

colleague.

The other policeman walks near Andy and Karen, raising his gun.

The first policeman takes Andy's hands and cuffs them behind his

back.

Karen turns her head and looks at the dead Lyosha.

The policemen don't seem to take any notice of what Andy is

saying. One is still cuffing his hands while the other one is

holding his gun.

The policeman raises Andy to his feet and moves him away from

Karen.

The policeman has seated Andy on an armchair. He bends him down

and puts the barrel of his gun on Andy's neck.

his hands and puts his jacket back on. Karen drops the handcuffs

on a table.

Close shot on the talkie lying on the floor.

Andy and Karen look at the talkie.

Karen picks up the talkie and gives it to Andy.

Of course, he gets an answer in Russian.

He gets another Russian answer, but the word studio is clearly

understandable.

Karen takes the talkie out of his hands and throws it.

The policeman, who had been knocked out by Karen, is slowly waking

up. Karen sees him and yells.

Karen picks up a gun and points it at the policeman. Andy grabs a

wooden armchair and crashes it on the policeman's back. The

armchairs breaks apart. The policeman falls down, unconscious.

The door opens and the next floor neighbor walks in. He yells

something in Russian. Karen turns toward him, with the gun still

pointed in front of her. The man look at the mess, the dead

bodies... and the gun. He raises his arms above his head. Andy

throws away the pieces of armchair he still had in his hands.

Karen puts the gun behind her back.

Karen says a couple of words in Russian. Andy turns toward her.

The man starts talking rapidly in Russian.

The man hasn't stopped talking. Actually, he and Andy have been

talking together. Now he yells something in Russian. Andy turns

toward Karen.

Andy took the gun from Karen and now he is waving it at the man.

The man turns around and runs out of the apartment, yelling in

Russian.

She has a gun in her hand and she gives him another gun. She runs

out of the apartment. Andy takes the handcuffs from the table.

He follows Karen out of the apartment.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Close shot on the entrance of the studio, where a plate says

something in Russian and underneath : Central Film Studio.

Larsen's car enters the studio. It stops near the building.

We see Billy and Larsen through the windshield. Larsen shows his

handcuff to Billy.

Billy tries to get out of the car, but she can't open the back

door.

Billy gets the key out of her pocket and gives it to Larsen, who

unlocks the handcuff.

He gets out of the car and closes the door. He goes around the car

to open Billy's door. As he is doing it, he sees car headlights

coming his way.

They both runs toward the building. He opens a big metal door and

they enter the building.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

This is the unused set, where Billy went, at the beginning of the

story, when she found herself locked in. It has metal doors

opening directly on the parking lot.

Billy pulls the big bolt that locks the door from the inside. Then

Larsen puts a padlock on the bolt.

They both walk away.

MOSCOW - A STREET NEAR RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Karen's car is driving full speed toward The Red Square. When she

takes a turn, the tires are screeching on the macadam and the car

zigzags a little.

KAREN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT.

Through the windshield, we see a small roadblock with lights on

it. It is not permitted to cross Red Square during the night.

MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The car rushes toward the roadblock.

KAREN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT.

When he sees the roadblock coming toward him, Andy slides down

under the dashboard.

MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Without even slowing down, Karen's car smashes through the

roadblock. The debris are flying around. And the car keeps on

driving full speed toward Red Square.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Wartschuk and his passenger are walking on the empty yard, guns in

hand. Voices are coming from their walkie-talkie. Several cars are

entering the parking lot behind them. The cars stop in front of

the building. Men carrying machine guns are coming out of the

cars.

Wartschuk directs the whole operation with his walkie-talkie.

A man tries to open the big metal door, but it's locked. He yells

something in Russian to Wartschuk, who answers him and points at

something. Apparently, he tells him to go around the building,

because the man starts running away.

Just outside the parking lot, Karen's car is coming to a stop near

the entrance. We hear the Russian voices in the parking lot. Karen

and Andy get out of the car. Karen walks to the entrance of the

parking lot and peeks inside. Andy joins her, trying to make his

gun work.

Karen shushes him down. They both peek inside, and they are

surprised to see such a number of big black cars.

Wartschuk is giving orders through his walkie-talkie. A man with a

machine-gun walks away from him.

Back to Karen and Andy, still standing outside the entrance.

They run across the entrance. The men, all looking toward the

building, don't see them.

Wartschuk is still giving orders. All the men with machine-guns

are scattering around the building. Someone is calling Wartschuk

through his talkie. Wartschuk smiles. He walks away from his men.

On the other side of the studio compound, Karen and Andy are

entering the place by climbing over the wall. Karen is already in

the place and she is helping Andy to join her. For the moment, he

is sitting on top of the wall and he throws the two guns to her.

Then he goes down himself. Karen holds his legs.

Andy falls down heavily on the ground.

On a balcony on a near building, a man is watching the yard with a

flashlight. This is the balcony which Billy fell from.

Andy and Karen are crossing the yard, trying to be as discrete as

possible.

Wartschuk is climbing rapidly up an emergency ladder to meet the

man with the flashlight.

Karen and Andy, lying low, are coming slowly toward the building.

Wartschuk has reached the balcony where the man is watching the

yard. They whisper in Russian. Then Wartschuk goes inside,

actually through that same emergency door through which Billy

tried earlier to escape. The watcher closes the door behind him.

Andy and Karen are still crawling slowly toward the building.

On the balcony, the man is smoking a cigarette.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

This is the set where the poor actress was murdered.

Larsen is trying to use a telephone on the wall.

Billy is watching Larsen. Behind her, we see Wartschuk peeking

through the half-open door.

Billy shows him the ancient-looking wardrobe under which the

diskette is hidden. He bends down. Then he raises and takes a

piece of wood from a rack. He slides the piece of wood under the

wardrobe.

Wartschuk enters silently on the set.

Larsen gets the diskette out of its hiding place. Billy picks it

up. Behind her, Wartschuk has got his gun out. Billy stands up

with the diskette in her hand. She smiles. Wartschuk grabs her

from the back. She throws the diskette. Larsen catches it.

Larsen puts discreetly the diskette in Wartschuk's pocket.

He gives his gun to Larsen.

Billy spits in Larsen's face. Then she yells silently, because

Wartschuk is squeezing her a little tighter. Larsen wipes the spit

from his face. Larsen raises his gun, holding it by the barrel.

Billy looks very frightened, because she knows that Larsen is

going to knock her out. But the butt of the gun lands violently...

on Wartschuk's head, who screams and falls heavily on the floor.

Billy looks from Larsen to the falling man, not understanding

clearly what happened.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR

Andy is hiding behind a trash can. He looks up at the watcher on

the balcony. He finally comes out of his hiding place, but bumps

into a beer can lying on the ground. The watcher says something in

Russian and points his flashlight toward Andy.

Karen is slowly going around the pile of empty film boxes on which

Billy fell earlier.

The watcher walks slowly down the ladder. Karen reaches the

ladder, climbs on something we don't see, and catches the

watcher's foot through the steps of the ladder. The man falls and

rolls all the way down the ladder. He is unconscious and Andy ties

his wrist to the ladder with the handcuff. Karen joins him. Andy

seems very happy about the successful operation.

The Reaper's black limousine is entering the parking lot.

Karen, who has started to go up the steps of the ladder, looks at

the limousine.

They reach the balcony and enter the building.

The Reaper's car is driving toward the building, with all the men,

equipped with machine guns, watching his arrival.

CINEMA STUDIO - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen and Andy are running along the long corridor. Andy is still

trying to work out the safety of his gun.

He falls down, dropping all the bullets on the floor.

Andy picks up his bullets, stands up and runs after Karen.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The Reaper's car is still surrounded by all the guards in arms.

We see only the shadow of The Reaper inside his car.

We guess he is talking into a walkie-talkie.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

This is the unused film set, with large metal doors opening on the

parking lot

Karen enters the gallery above the room, followed by Andy. She

bends down, and makes him bend down.

Down below, on the set itself, Billy is walking, with Larsen

behind her, pointing a gun in her back.

On the gallery, Andy is still trying to work his gun.

Andy shoots, misses Larsen, and hits a statue.

Larsen and Billy try to hide from the shooter.

Andy shoots again and misses again.

Karen runs along the gallery, while Andy shoots and misses again.

And once again. Then he realizes that the gun is empty and he

drops it on the floor of the gallery. He runs after Karen.

Down below, Larsen brings Billy near the big metal door opening on

the outside. He unlocks the padlock that he had put earlier on the

bolt of the door.

Karen rushes toward them.

Larsen pulls the bolt open. Billy is very surprised to see her

sister. Larsen points his gun at her and yells something in

Russian.

Karen stops running, but Billy makes large signs to her, signs she

doesn't seem to understand. Karen hides, and then comes out.

Karen throws a piece of metal at Larsen. The piece of metal hits

his hand and he drops his gun.

Billy opens the big metal door. Andy runs in to join Karen. Larsen

picks up his gun, and points it at Billy.

But Billy is already out of the building.

Andy grabs Karen and pulls her out of Larsen's gun.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Billy runs out of the building. An army of men, armed with

machine-guns, is waiting for her. The cars' drivers all switched

their headlights on high beams. With all that light in front of

her, Billy doesn't see anymore where she is going and stops

running.

The Reaper, still in his car, bends down to look at her. He takes

his walkie-talkie.

Larsen walks out of the building, and we hear the end on The

Reaper's sentence coming from his own walkie-talkie.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen and Andy rush to the window, to look at what is happening on

the parking lot.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Billy looks at the men in front of her with a frightened face. She

turns around to look at Larsen pointing his gun at her. Then she

turns back to the men in front of her, and especially The Reaper,

looking at her from his car. Behind her, Larsen aims his gun at

her.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen and Andy are still looking through the window.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen closes one eye before shooting. He shoots seven times. We

see the bullets going through Billy's body from the back, and

coming out through the front, making red bloody spots on her white

sweater. Billy falls down on her stomach, and remains motionless

on the ground with her arms spread apart.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen, still standing behind the window, can't believe what she

just saw.

Through the window, we see Billy's body lying on the ground, with

all the big black cars surrounding her.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Through the half-open door, Larsen shows The Reaper the diskette

he has found on the set.

The Reaper smiles. The big metal door closes as Larsen goes back

inside.

All the men go back inside their cars. The engines start. And the

cars start driving out, The Reaper's car being the first one to

go.

Billy is still lying motionless on the ground, her blood flowing

slowly on the tarmac.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Karen is in Andy's arms, crying.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The last cars are leaving the parking lot.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Andy, with Karen crying on his laps, looks at Larsen coming back

in and closing the door.

She rushes out of Andy's arms and bumps violently into Larsen.

They both fall on the floor, and Larsen's gun flies away from his

hand. Karen hits Larsen very hard with both her fists. Andy picks

up the gun and points it at Larsen. Larsen pushes Karen away from

him. Karen takes the legs of a statue and hits Larsen with it.

Then she grabs Larsen by the ears and throws him on the metal

door. She turns toward Andy.

Karen opens the door and walks out.

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Billy, still lying on the ground, opens one eye and smiles.

Karen runs out of the building and rushes toward her sister, who

stands up when she sees her. Karen stops and looks at her. Karen

sits up and raises her sweatshirt.

Underneath, she is equipped with the special effect system she

uses to pretend people are being shot. Little bags, full of fake

blood, explode one by one, tearing the piece of clothing in front

of them, and pouring the blood through the fabric. For the

spectator, it does looks like bullet going through a body and

blood spurting out.

Karen rushes to Billy and hugs her.

CINEMA STUDIO - FILM SET - INTERIOR NIGHT

Larsen is still kneeling on the floor. Andy is pointing the gun at

him, trying to look mean, which is a bit hard for him.

Larsen is slowly getting up.

He shoots the gun to the ceiling.

He shoots at Larsen, who doesn't react and walks closer to him. He

shoots twice more, walking backward. He bumps into a prop and

falls down on his back... next to Wartschuk, all tied up and with

a large piece of tape across his mouth. Wartschuk moans, Andy

screams and gets quickly up. He rushes out of the building while

Larsen is trying to get over what just happened to him

CINEMA STUDIO - PARKING LOT - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Andy rushes out of the building and sees Karen cleaning Billy's

face.

Billy mouth the words I'm fine and shows him the special effect

device on her stomach. Larsen comes behind her and takes her by

the shoulder, saying a few words in Russian. Billy says something

in sign language to Karen.

Karen pats Larsen's shoulder.

Larsen throws a remote control into Andy's hands.

They all laugh. Larsen pats Andy's shoulder.

Billy starts talking in sign language to Larsen. He turns toward

Karen.

Billy mouthes the word Pleasure and then makes the sign for it,

which is rubbing you stomach. Larsen makes the same sign. Then he

stops and seems to think about something.

The sound of a shot, and a blood bag explodes under Billy's

sweater. Karen screams. Since she was just in front of Billy, her

face is covered with fake blood. Andy looks at them, the remote

control in his hand.

They all look at him. Larsen smiles.

A little later.

Andy drives his car near the entrance of the building. Billy walks

toward the car, looking at Wartschuk, his mouth still gagged,

being forced by Larsen to go inside his car. He moans

incomprehensible words, and seems not to want to get inside the

car.

Andy waves to Larsen.

Andy opens the back door of his own car to let Billy inside. But

she doesn't climb in, still surprised by Wartschuk's attitude.

Finally, Larsen succeeds in putting his prisoner in the back of

his car, where another prisoner, also gagged, is already waiting

(certainly the man that Andy had handcuffed earlier on the

emergency ladder).

Before climbing into the driver's seat, Larsen waves to Billy.

He makes the pleasure sign. Billy waves back to him.

Billy looks at Wartschuk inside the car. She seems worried.

Billy makes several signs. Andy doesn't understand, but he looks

at Larsen. Larsen smiles back to him.

Karen is already seated in the car, and doesn't understand the

reason for the delay.

Close shot on Wartschuk's face, who is trying to tell them

something.

Andy eventually understand what Billy is trying to tell him. It is

the word he learned earlier in the restaurant.

Billy nods Yes. Larsen smiles to her and starts his car. Billy

slams violently on the roof of Andy's car. She seems frightened by

something. She yells silently.

Billy keeps on yelling silently and moving her arms. Andy is

beginning to understand what she means.

Wartschuk looks more and more frightened.

Andy want to rush to Larsen's car, but Billy holds him back.

Watching Billy and Andy, Larsen has suddenly a worried look on his

face. He is beginning to understand that something is wrong. He

gets out of his car, walks a few steps, and then his car explodes

and he falls on the ground.

Andy, Billy and Karen, who is now out of her car, they all look at

the car burning and at the motionless Larsen lying on the ground.

Billy looks very sad.

But, slowly, Larsen begins to move. He sits up and looks at Billy.

Billy is crying and smiling at the same time. We get to understand

she must be in love with Larsen.
