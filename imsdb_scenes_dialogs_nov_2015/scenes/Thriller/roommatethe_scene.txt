INT. COLLEGE DORM ROOM - DAY

Sunlight pours through the window of an empty, silent dorm

room. The room seems alive, somehow. As if it's waiting

patiently for this year's kids.

A long beat. The room darkens for an instant. Just the sun,

right, dipping behind a cloud? Maybe.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

OVER CREDITS, we PAN DOWN a hallway full of COLLEGE KIDS.

They carry boxes, stereo speakers, stand around chatting.

EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

SARA MATTHEWS, 18, gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm.

She's pretty, with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just

above her shoulders. She's dressed casually, but still chic.

No parents.

She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the

other, and a huge suitcase in her hand. And she's staring

through the building's window at...

Newly-minted COLLEGE STUDENTS milling about inside. Their

parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces.

INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY

Sara walks to the registration table. A RESIDENT ASSISTANT

smiles up at her.

Hi. Sara Matthews.

She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple

silver chain around her neck.

R.A.

Des Moines, Iowa. Wow. Flyover

country.

She says it nicely, but it still stings. Sara smiles gamely.

R.A.

You're in room three-sixteen.

Welcome.

She hands Sara a room key. She fingers it, smiling.

2.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN ON Sara as she...

Pushes an ancient, flat-bed cart out of the elevator and down

the hall, struggling to control its wobbly wheels. She bumps

into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off.

Sara stops in front of Room 316.

INT. DORM DOORWAY - DAY

She opens the door and looks in on:

A run-of-the-mill freshman dorm room. Tiny; bathroom down the

hall; twin beds. Heaven.

Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice

here. She drops her stuff on the bed by the window.

She sits down on it. A beat. I'm really here.

First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her

duffle bag and sets it on the dresser. It's a picture of a

YOUNG GIRL, maybe ten. She looks a little like Sara.

Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam DESIGN MANNEQUIN off the cart.

It's full of pin and chalk marks. She sets it by her bed.

Told you we'd make it.

She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off

the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles

off the other cart.

Sorry! Bad driver.

Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair --

clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And

peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl

smiles sheepishly.

In case of emergency.

I'm Tracy.

Sara.

3.

Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands.

EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY

A gorgeous fall day. Sara strolls across the quad, taking it

all in. Kids tossing frisbees... hacky-sacking... sunning on

the grass. Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm

windows.

EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Sara's cell phone buzzes. She answers it.

Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met

this really cool biker? He's taking

me to Mexico this weekend.

Hello?

Hi, Mom. Just tell him I'm kidding.

Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a

work/study ad on the wall.

Everything's great.

No, she's not here yet so I got to

choose my side of the room.

She tears a tab off the flyer.

EXT. COLLEGE DORM - NIGHT

Establishing shot of Carnegie, a solid red-brick dorm.

INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sara's half-settled in now. The wall beside her bed is

peppered with fashion pages ripped out of Vogue and In Style.

She sits in a lounge chair, paging through a Vanity Fair

photo shoot. She spots a cool outfit and tears out the page.

A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Sara walks over. She opens it

expectantly to see...

4.

Tracy, Tracy's roommate KIM, and two other HALLMATES. All

dressed to party.

Psi U.'s throwing a bash. Let's go.

Psi U.?

They're a frat. Beer... guys...

I don't know... I might just hang

and wait for my roommate.

Groans all around. "Come on"... "Lame-O"... Sara bites her

lip, considering. She smiles.

Alright. Just let me change.

The girls cheer.

EXT. PSI U. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

front door. Music blasts out of the windows.

INT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

Sara, Tracy, Kim and the others from the floor are at the

head of the line, stepping into the house. They're met by a

FRAT BOUNCER.

(motions to a crowded keg)

If you want beer, I'll need ID's.

For a frat party?! Seriously?

He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands. Kim

steps around him.

I don't drink anyway.

Tracy looks at her, mouth agape.

5.

There's punch and non-alcoholic

beer over there...

He points to a table with a giant bowl and cups. No one is

around it.

Tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer.

Come on, just us. We won't tell.

The bouncer is tempted but not budging.

Honestly, I'm just a pledge.

They'll kick me out.

She stomps by him.

Wuss.

Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table. Turns back to Sara.

You want something to drink?

What's the point?

Tracy huffs as Sara walks into A SEA OF KIDS. We're talking

extreme fire hazard... extreme moral hazard.

Sara moves through the crowd. Her clothes are low-wattage,

but stylish. She's drawn to the music coming from a large

room.

A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good,

but they don't care. Sara finds a spot along the wall and

watches them. In particular --

THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's

mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed. Really into it. Sara

chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him. He

definitely stands out.

Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in

with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band.

Juice spilling over the brim of her cup. Sara stays by the

wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her.

6.

(yells over the music)

Why aren't you dancing?

To this?

They're not that bad.

Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd. Now all three start

jumping up and down to the music. Sara's getting into it as

Tracy chugs her drink.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER

A DJ rules the room now. Sara and Kim are dancing with

others from the floor. Sara notices a speck of punch on her

shirt. She stops dancing. Wets her fingers and tries to rub

it out.

Crap.

Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around.

Where's Tracy?

She was getting more punch.

Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing

onto the stage next to the DJ's table with a bunch of other

girls already dancing. She starts dancing suggestively,

egging on the crowd.

Uh oh.

Guys yell out. "Show em." Several hands armed with camera

phones stretch out above the crowd.

Tracy.

Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the

stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the

bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd.

7.

Tracy. Don't.

Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who

inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara

gasps.

Damn!

Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd.

Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up.

Oh. Woops.

I have to go clean this up.

She turns.

Looks like my plan backfired.

Sara turns back towards him.

What plan?

To spill beer on you so I can start

a conversation.

You spilled beer on me purposely?

You pissed?

She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's

hard to be mad at him. She then grabs a beer out of a

dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen.

I'll get over it.

He laughs, making her smile.

8.

I'm not sure how she's so wasted.

All she's had is punch.

Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand.

Come on.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - BAR

Stephen, now with a full beer watches as Sara sips some of

the punch.

It's pretty good.

She drinks some more.

It doesn't taste that strong.

Exactly.

He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of

hers.

Stephen. By the way.

Sara.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR: SOME TIME LATER

Stephen and Sara are dancing. She's holding her cup.

Drinking, bumping into a couple of people. Stephen laughs,

grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and TWIRLS her,

bringing her close. She notices, for the first time, that

he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her

other hand.

Hey, why do you get to drink beer?

Twenty-one.

Old man.

9.

Tell me about it. My back is

killing me.

They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against

his chest.

Besides, frat brothers don't have

to wear those ugly wristbands.

Ugh. You're in this frat?

He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people

behind her. Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing,

Holding up a cup of punch.

Did you try the punch? It's pretty

good.

What happened to Tracy?

Kim shrugs.

I'm the worst roommate ever.

Kim goes back to dancing Sara looks a little worried which

Stephen notices.

Do you want to look for your

friend?

Sara looks at him sweetly. Nods.

INT. STAIRCASE

They spot Tracy propped up against the railing at the bottom

of the stairs. Sara rushes over to her. A couple frat boys

stand over her. Not sure what to do with her.

I got her.

10.

She struggles to hold Tracy up -- the girl's heavier than she

looks and Sara's balance is not so great, herself. The frat

boys notice her struggling.

Who's got you?

Tracy nearly brings Sara down to the floor...

But Stephen's there to catch her.

Guess that would be me.

But then he stumbles, nearly dropping them both.

Who's got you?

Stephen looks at Tracy in one arm. The other arm around

Sara's waist.

Apparently God.

Sara rolls her eyes.

INT. CARNEGIE DORM - NIGHT

Sara, Stephen, and Tracy stumble into the dorm lobby. Sara

wears a jacket Stephen gave her for the walk. Kim and

ANOTHER GIRL step forward and grab Tracy.

Thanks Sara.

No problem.

They linger, smiling, checking out Stephen... They step into

the elevator. Holding it for Sara.

You want us to wait?

Sara turns and glares at Kim. An obvious "NO!" Kim lets the

doors close as Sara turns back to Stephen.

11.

You know, I'm going to be pulling

kitchen duty all week for helping

girls leave a frat party. It's

like opposite everything we stand

for.

Sara leans in and gives him a long kiss. Then separates, but

her lips still very close to his.

(low and romantic)

Does that make it worth it?

Honestly, no.

She laughs out loud.

Do you want to come up?

More than I can tell you, but that

wouldn't be fair.

Sara starts to take off Stephen's jacket. He stops her.

Keep it... till next time.

Thanks again. For everything.

And, sorry about kitchen duty.

He smiles... and walks away into the night. Sara looks after

him... and now it's her turn to take a deep breath which

suddenly makes her a little more queasy.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sara heads for her room, holding onto the wall as she goes.

She reaches her door. She takes one more deep breath, then

opens it.

12.

INT. ROOM 316 - NIGHT

Sara closes the door behind her. Almost pitch black; just a

little moonlight through the window. Sara knocks into her

lounge chair.

Ow!

She reaches her bed and plops down on her back. Breathing

hard. Clenching her eyes shut. The room is spinning. She may

puke at any second.

She struggles to sit up. She fumbles for the lamp next to her

bed, almost knocking it over. She hits the switch, revealing:

The other bed.

Sara screams.

Hi.

disorienting Sara.

Who are you?!

Rebecca. Your roommate.

Sara calms, catching on.

What are you doing?

Taking your picture.

Why?

Rebecca shrugs. Sara grabs her stomach.

Oh shit.

Her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door. Rebecca

smiles.

13.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT: LATER

Sara gingerly walks out of the bathroom back to her room,

holding her head. The door is slightly open.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

It's dark. Rebecca's covers are pulled up to her neck. Her

eyes are closed.

Rebecca?

No answer. Sara makes it back to her bed. She falls onto it,

and turns toward the wall.

Rebecca's eyes open. And they stay open. She watches Sara go

to sleep.

EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY

It's the middle of the day and students carry their books

everywhere.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

Sara wakes. Headache; dry mouth; the works. The sun through

the window is way too bright. She slowly turns over to see...

Rebecca, up and about, arranging her side of the room. In the

light of day, we see that she's a knockout.

Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that

flank an awesome stereo system.

Rebecca sees that Sara's awake.

Hey Sara.

Sara stares at her blankly. Who is this girl? What happened

last night? Rebecca smiles.

We met last night.

14.

Right...

(racking her brain)

Starts with a... "T"?

Close. Rebecca.

She hands Sara a glass of water and two aspirin.

Come on. It'll help, trust me.

Sara washes down the aspirin.

Thanks.

Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched.

I didn't throw up on you, did I?

No. You made it to the bathroom.

Sara looks around the room. Her lounge chair has been moved

to her side.

Rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall.. .They're various

self-portraits of Rebecca. Sara looks at one where Rebecca

is staring straight back at us. No smile.

Did you do those?

Rebecca nods.

They're really cool.

I just like capturing my moods.

A beat. Sara closes her eyes. Bits and pieces of the night

before are coming back to her now.

Rebecca -- did you take my picture

last night?

15.

Yeah. It's just something I do. For

my drawings.

C'mon, let's hit the bookstore. The

walk will help your head.

Sara rolls over, groaning.

It's too damn early for me.

It's three in the afternoon.

Sara's eyes bug out.

Holy shit!

INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

Sara walks along the back aisle, weighed down with textbooks.

All look used and worn. Fashion Design. Psychology. Calculus.

She spots the last book she needs and reaches for it just as

another GIRL reaches too. They both pull back, neither sure

who has claim to it.

So what do we do?

Sara looks her over. Checks out her outfit.

Nice bag. Dior?

Yeah.

Sara snatches the book.

I'm on financial aid.

16.

INT. BOOKSTORE - LATER

Sara finds Rebecca by the art supplies, she's picking up the

stuff she needs. Sara scans Rebecca's books. They're all

art books, shiny and new.

Sara's phone rings. She looks at it: "JASON".

She sighs. Her finger hovers over the "talk" button. A beat.

She hits it right before it goes to voicemail.

Jason. What are you doing?

JASON (O.S.)

I just wanted to hear your voice.

I told you not to do this.

JASON (O.S.)

I need to talk to you.

You're just making it harder.

JASON (O.S.)

Sara, listen I... I want to come

out there.

But you didn't come out here,

remember. That's the problem.

She says it too loud. Other students in line are eyeing her.

I've gotta go.

Sara hangs up. She exhales, flustered.

That didn't sound good. Boyfriend?

Ex.

Off Rebecca's confused look.

17.

It's complicated.

A beat. Rebecca's warm smile makes Sara want to open up.

They walk along the stacks of books.

We dated since tenth grade and were

supposed to go to college together.

We both applied to Brown. I got in;

he got wait-listed. I stuck to our

agreement and we both committed

here. Then two weeks ago...a spot

opened up at Brown ...and..

No?! He took it?

(Sara nods glumly)

What an asshole.

Yep.

Do you miss him?

Sometimes I think I do.

It's hard to let go.

Believe me, I know. But, you're in

college now. A girl's gotta move

on.

Sara smiles, glad to find a kindred spirit. She looks at her

phone... and stuffs it into her pocket as they reach the

register.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca sits on her bed, drawing. Sara is putting her books

away on a shelf. As she reaches the end of it, she notices

something out of the corner of her eye.

Oh my God.

What?

18.

Sara walks to the closet. Her modest clothes hang on one

side. But the other side is now taken up by Rebecca's KILLER

COLLECTION.

I am so jealous.

I know... I've got a lot of clothes.

Mind if I put some on your side?

No problem.

Borrow anything you want. Really. I

haven't worn half of them.

Sara reverently fingers through them. Chloe. De La Renta.

Alexander McQueen. Jimmy Choo shoes. A Miu Miu handbag. Some

still carry their price tags.

Jesus, some of these I've only ever

seen in Vogue.

My parents idea of bonding is to

turn me loose in Beverly Hills with

a Platinum card.

Oh, you here?

Pasadena.

Off Sara's confused look.

About 20 minutes away.

That's cool. You can go home on

weekends. Free laundry. Free meals.

Not gonna happen.

Sara gives her a puzzled stare.

19.

It's a long story.. .Let's just say

nothing's free in my house.

She wants to know more... but it's too soon to pry. She nods

at Rebecca's drawing pad.

Can I take a look?

She walks over. Rebecca clutches the pad to her chest.

No.

Sara stops dead in her tracks. Rebecca realizes that came

across pretty harsh.

Not till it's done. Nothing

personal. It's just my... process.

I wouldn't want to show you

anything unless it was perfect.

Sure.

EXT. CAFETERIA - DUSK

Establishing shot of a big college cafeteria.

INT. CAFETERIA - DUSK

Sara and Rebecca have just finished their dinner.

I thought you were a design major.

Why are you taking Calc and

psychology?

The girls get up with their trays.

(with a smirk)

I am. I want to be well-rounded.

(off her look)

And they're requirements.

20.

TRACY (O.S.)

Hey Sara.

Sara sees Tracy sitting by the window with Kim. Sara walks

over, but Rebecca doesn't follow.

Hey. Tracy... Kim... this is my

roommate, Rebecca.

She turns, but Rebecca is standing at a distance. Sara waves

her over.

Rebecca comes, reluctantly. She flashes a small wave.

Hi.

RRRRRREBECCA. How formal. What can

we call you?

How 'bout Reba?

Tracy sticks her finger down her throat. Gag me.

I like Becca.

Tracy's grimace vetoes that one, too.

How 'bout Becky?

Becky's good.

The girls all turn to Rebecca for approval.

I like Rebecca.

Buzzkill.

OOOKAAAY.

Rebecca walks out. Sara shrugs at Tracy and Kim.

21.

EXT. DESIGN BUILDING - DAY

Sara enters the Design building.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Sara peeks in the open door of a classroom. Frustration in

her eyes -- the class she couldn't get into.

She watches PROFESSOR ROBERTS -- long-haired, dashing --

lecture his students.

So... here we are. Design 101. And

each one of you is asking yourself

the same question...

(he taps his own chest)

Who is this guy? Why should I turn

off my Blackberry and pay attention

to him?

Mild laughter from the class.

I'll tell you why -- because I hold

the keys to the kingdom. Think of

your favorite designers. Marc

Jacobs. Vera Wang. Rick Owens.

Magicians, right? I've got news for

you: All of their magic stems from

the same source: the fundamental

principles of design.

I can teach you those principles.

He lets the power of his words sink in.

The journey to the catwalks of New

York... Paris... Tokyo... starts

right here, in this room. And all

you have to do is open your minds.

Man, she wants in.

22.

INT. SAME HALLWAY - LATER

Sara stands by the door, watching the students file out. As

the last one leaves, she screws up her courage and walks in.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Professor Roberts is gathering up his papers.

Professor Roberts?

He flashes a disarming smile.

I'm sorry to bother you, it's

just...

I absolutely must take this class.

I'm afraid we're full. But don't

worry -- Intro Design has three

other sections.

But you're not teaching them. I

want to learn from the best.

He smiles at her.

What's your name?

Sara Matthews.

I brought a request form.

on Sara. Roaming over her.

Tell me, Sara -- why should I sign

your request form when I've turned

down a dozen others? Would that be

fair?

Sara's face falls. A long beat.

23.

No, I guess it wouldn't. Thanks

anyway.

She walks toward the door. Roberts' eyes go to her ass.

But...

Who said life was fair? You happen

to have two things I can't teach...

He walks to her... and hands her the signed form.

Style. And Desire.

He smiles, signs the form and hands it to Sara. Sara clutches

the form to her chest, smiling.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

Sara and Rebecca sit on their respective beds. Rebecca

listens to her Walkman. Sara types on her laptop.

Hey.

Rebecca removes her earbud.

What's your Facebook page? I'll add

you as a friend.

I don't have a Facebook page.

Myspace?

Nope. I don't spend a lot of time

Sara stares at Rebecca. No way.

Come here.

Rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over Sara's

shoulder.

24.

ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Sara's Facebook Page. Her picture in the

corner. Pictures and posts from a dozen friends.

Among them: A STYLISH, ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in her 20s.

Who's she?

Irene. She graduated from the Art

Institute out here last year.

She's an artist?

A design apprentice for Marc

Jacobs. Hey, check out these

posts.

Sara scrolls down Irene's recent posts: "Paris was

amazing"... "Milan in the Fall"... "Off to Barcelona"... etc.

I mean.. .who doesn't have a

Facebook page?!

Rebecca laughs.

Okay, okay. I'll get one.

Tracy knocks on the partially open front door... and marches

right in.

Cancel those library plans. Guess

who made the guest list at Rebar?

You guys in? I trust you have fake

IDs?

Of course.

I don't.

Yes you do. Thanks to my badass

self.

25.

Tracy pulls out a fake ID. She walks to Rebecca and holds it

out to her. A peace offering.

Rebecca stares at Tracy for a beat... then goes back to her

sketchbook.

I'll pass. Clubs really aren't my

scene.

Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the ID in her hand.

INT. CLUB - NIGHT

A posh Los Angeles bar. Loud and packed to the gills with

mostly young students. Sara and Tracy stand at the bar,

getting jostled, looking like... two naive college kids.

As they try to get the bartender's attention, older guys

check them out, smiling and mouthing "Hi." Sara tries to

ignore them, but Tracy's in heaven.

How great is this? No parents. No

curfews.

No shit!

They clink their empty glasses in a toast.

Can I?

She puts her wallet and cell phone into Tracy's purse.

Too bad Rebecca blew us off. Talk

about the life of the party.

Don't be mean.

I'm just saying.

She's just a little hard to get to

know.

Yeah right...

26.

As Tracy rolls her eyes...

The BARTENDER sets two drinks down in front of them. He nods

down the bar at...

TWO MIDDLE-AGED SUITS. Tracy flashes them a smile. Sara's not

so sure about this.

What do you think?

I think...

Tracy raises her shot glass. She and Sara clink and drink.

Tracy waves at the suits again. Thanks guys.

We can do better.

She takes Sara's hand and pulls her out onto the dance floor.

INT. CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - LATER

Sara and Tracy whirl in the hot mix of bodies. Having the

time of their lives. A HANDSOME GUY moves in, his eyes on

Tracy.

Tracy loves it. They dance together as Sara watches, smiling.

Tracy and the handsome guy drift further away from Sara.

Sara is now dancing by herself. A GUY moves in on her, but

she politely dances away. She scans the dance floor for

Tracy. Where'd she go?

She steps off the dance floor and scans the bar -- no sign of

her.

INT. CLUB - BATHROOM

Sara walks into the crowded ladies' room.

Tracy?

27.

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

A bummed Sara walks out of the club alone. She rubs her arms

against the chill. She nervously tugs on her silver chain as

she scans the STRAGGLERS loitering outside.

Tracy.

She takes one last peek into the club doorway, hoping against

hope that Tracy will magically appear. No luck.

She starts walking down the street, away from the club.

Weary and unnerved.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca lies in bed, wide awake in the dark. Her cell phone

rings. She stares at it. Two more rings. She picks it up.

Hello?

OPERATOR (O.S.)

Would you accept a collect call

from... Sara Matthews?

Yes.

She smiles.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

An old school gas station on a barren corner of the city. No

cars in either direction. A lone white 328i BMW with a black

soft top sits next to an ancient pump.

Rebecca, half asleep, climbs out and grabs the nozzle,

sticking it in the fuel tank. Starts pumping.

MAN (0.S.)

Can I help you out?

She turns to see a 20-year-old, good-looking gas station

attendant. His name tag: "Rick".

Rebecca sizes him up.

28.

I'm fine. Just in a hurry.

She keeps pumping. Speeding it up. Rick ambles up to her,

treading beyond appropriate personal space. He points to the

"Full Service" sign.

Just doing my job.

She stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the

gas pump and squeezes. She looks down at his hand on top of

hers. Then lets go of the pump, nudging his hand away.

All done.

She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it

back at the pump. He stops her. Motions to her face.

You have a little something.

No, she doesn't.

He, ever so gently, rubs his index finger and thumb on her

cheek to remove the imaginary smudge until he lurches back.

The hell?

His crotch is wet as gasoline drips from the nozzle.

Sorry.

But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him

head to toe. He scrambles backward out of range.

Sorry again. Rick.

The nozzle's still in her hand, pouring gas in every

direction. She opens her car door, grabbing a lighter.

Rick's pissed. Charges towards her.

You spoiled c---

He spots the lighter in her hand. Dead stop. She

absentmindedly flicks it. It sparks but doesn't light.

29.

The gas is now pouring towards him. The meter on the pump is

still ticking up.

He scrambles again as she casually flips the lighter at him

and drops the still pouring nozzle.

A hint of a grin and a pitying shake of her head as she pulls

out a loose hundred dollar bill. Places it on top of the

pump.

Pussy.

She gets into her car and drives off. Leaving Rick soaked in

gasoline.

INT./EXT. DINER - NIGHT

Sara sits by herself in a booth by the window. Hugging a cup

of hot, sobering coffee.

Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot. The headlights

shine right in Sara's eyes... and now turn off.

Sara's tired eyes light up as she sees Rebecca get out of the

car. She waves. Rebecca doesn't wave back as she heads for

the door.

INT. DINER - NIGHT

Rebecca walks up to Sara's booth.

Nice car.

Thanks.

So, where's Tracy?

No idea, I couldn't find her.

Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table.

As long as I'm here... you hungry?

Starved.

Sara smiles gratefully. Rebecca opens the menu.

30.

I can't believe she ran out on you.

I know. Thanks for coming.

Rebecca looks up from the menu.

Tracy had her shot tonight.

Tomorrow you're all mine. I'll show

you the big city.. .the right way.

And I promise I won't abandon you.

Deal?

Sara smiles.

Deal.

INT. MOCA - DAY

Rebecca leads Sara through the sculpture room.

These are the modern pieces. A

little wilder than the old stuff.

She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't

just walk past pieces -- she studies them. Sara's impressed.

Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: "Jason".

She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She

buries her cell phone in her purse.

Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it.

Okay, I have no idea what this is

supposed to be.

Even I don't get that one. Come

on, I want to show you something.

INT. MOCA - LATER

Rebecca shows Sara into a room full of paintings. In the

background is a banner announcing an upcoming Richard Prince

exhibition.

31.

They stop in front of Richard Prince's "Nurse of

Greenmeadow." It's a portrait of a woman in a nurse's mask.

Her eyes peer directly at the viewer. Blood is smeared on her

smock.

This is my favorite.

Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her.

I love how he captures her

personality through her eyes. It's

like she really wants to help you.

Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants

Sara to like this painting.

Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what

Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is

actually pretty sinister.

Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's

hopeful expression. Sara brightens.

Amazing. I love it.

EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

Sara and Rebecca window shop along a block of thrift stores.

Sara spots a graffiti-laden wall next to a tattoo parlor.

Some first-rate tagging here -- bright colors, funky shapes.

That is so cool.

No graffiti in Des Moines?

Sure. "Bobby loves Jenny. Chrissy

loves Rick." Nothing like this.

Rebecca pulls out her camera.

Hey, smile.

Sara poses... but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in.

Both of us.

32.

They both hold the camera, extended at arm's length. Rebecca

clicks. She looks at the picture. She can see the tattoo

parlor in the background.

Now that's one "art form" I don't

get. Needles into skin? No thanks.

I have a tattoo.

Rebecca smiles. Yeah, right. But she can see in Sara's eyes

that she's serious.

Really?

Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over

her heart, a simple tattoo: "Emily".

My older sister. She died when I

was nine.

Oh, I'm sorry.

(pats her heart)

This keeps her with me.

I always wanted a sister.

Sara smiles and interlocks her arm with Rebecca's as they

walk down the street.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

Sara sits on her bed in sweats, typing on her laptop. Rebecca

sits on her own bed, glancing over at Sara as she draws.

Guess who I'm listing as my

favorite artist on my Facebook

page?

Richard Prince.

Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. She walks over to check

out the rest of Sara's Facebook Favorites. Favorite book,

favorite band, etc.

33.

Your favorite movie is "Coyote

Ugly"?

Don't laugh. It's about a small

town girl making it in the big

city.

Isn't every movie?!

They both laugh.

EXT. CITY STREET - DUSK

Sara, in shorts and warm-up jacket, runs down the sidewalk.

Her head's on a swivel, taking in the city sights.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca takes down a few of her drawings. In their place, she

puts up a big "Coyote Ugly" poster. She straightens it out.

Satisfied.

She checks her watch and walks to the window. She looks out,

anxious for Sara to come home.

She looks over at Sara's side of the room. Curious, she

starts perusing her things. Books... CDs...

She walks to Sara's dresser and picks up the picture of

Emily. She tenderly brushes Emily's face with her thumb.

She spots Sara's silver chain. She picks it up and places it

around her neck. She fingers it carefully and looks at

herself in the mirror. She smiles.

EXT. CARNEGIE DORM - NIGHT

Sara finishes off her run strong, striding out the last ten

yards to the dorm. She catches her breath and hears a kitten.

Sara looks in-between the columns outside the dorm and finds

a STRAY KITTEN. She's cute as they come, a black-and-white

furball.

Hey there.

34.

The kitten purrs.

Look at you.

She kneels and pets it. The kitten purrs.

No collar, baby?

Sara glances around to see if anyone is watching.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Sara quickly walks in and closes the door. Rebecca sits in

her windowsill, drawing. Sara sits down on her own bed. She

notices the "Coyote Ugly" poster.

Wow.

I thought you'd like it.

Rebecca sees the moving bulge under Sara's jacket. She cuts

Sara a look. Sara sighs. Apprehensively, she unzips her

jacket and the kitten pops out. Rebecca sits up. The kitten

jumps over to her bed. She pets it.

Sara...

I know, I know. It's stupid, and

I've just broken about forty

different dorm rules, and I should

just take it to a shelter...

What do you want to name it?

Sara's face lights up. She smiles gratefully.

Really?

35.

It'll be our secret. Just between

us.

Rebecca keeps petting the kitten. Getting more attached.

I named her in the elevator.

Cuddles.

She smiles and scoops her up. Suddenly, her smile vanishes.

Is that my necklace?

Rebecca touches it. She'd forgotten she still had it on.

Sorry. I was just trying it on.

Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly

takes it off. Sara takes it back, annoyed. She rubs it

protectively.

This was my sister's.

Oh.

Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca.

You can borrow anything of mine.

Except for this. Okay? It's the

only thing I kept of hers.

Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her.

I'm really sorry.

It's okay. You didn't know.

Were you two close?

Yeah. You're the first roommate

I've had since she died. So, it

feels a little odd.

36.

In a good way or a bad way?

Sara smiles.

A good way.

EXT. CAMPUS QUADS - MORNING

Establishing of life at the quads.

INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A cool college hangout lined with old wooden tables and comfy

couches. More like a living room than a coffee shop. Lots of

laid-back STUDENTS and...

One stressed-out Sara, dropping drinks off at a table and now

rushing back to the register for the next order. Her CO-

WORKER, clearly stoned, moves in slow motion. Not a care in

his world.

You wanted a mocha smoothie, right?

O.K. Do you know what's in that?

The kid shrugs. Sara hops to the blender and guesses some

ingredients. She starts it up. She takes her hand off the

lid, and...

THE BLENDER EXPLODES, splashing mocha smoothie all over her

apron. She's frozen in shock. The co-worker casually hands

her a towel. She snatches it. She turns to find...

STEPHEN, standing at the front of the line.

This seems like a pattern.

Sara smiles. She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc.

She leans in and speaks quietly.

Just because I kissed you doesn't

mean I'll let you cut in line.

So what does it mean?

37.

She coyly shrugs.

Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon

are reviving a sacred tradition

tonight.

Sara stares at him blankly. He smiles.

We're having another keg party.

I.. dunno. I'm still having

flashbacks from the last one.

Sara laughs.

You know what? How about if I use

you as my excuse not to go.

Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

Sara walks off the elevator, still sky-high. She walks

through the lounge, where Tracy sits on the couch. A

television plays in the background.

Hey.

Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops. Her tone is cold.

Hey.

Psi U. tonight?

So you can ditch me again?

Sara... the guy had a Porsche. And

a hot tub.

That's your apology?

Tracy jumps up and walks over.

38.

What I meant to say is -- I'm sorry

-- I totally screwed up.

Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She

watches Tracy and Sara.

Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs.

I forgive you.

Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder,

she spots Rebecca looking at them. Tracy flashes a big smile.

Relief at making up with Sara. But that's not how Rebecca

takes it.

But you're on your own at Psi U.

Because...

Someone has a date.

Rebecca hears this. She slips back into the room and closes

the door. Sara turns and walks down the hallway.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

Sara walks in to find Rebecca slipping into a black dress.

You look... nice.

Thanks. Richard Prince is having a

showing. I bought two tickets.

Since he's your favorite artist...

Actually, I... sort of have a date?

Oh. Okay.

Major downer. Rebecca goes back to getting dressed. Heavy

silence in the room. Sara watches her. A beat.

You know, I could reschedule.

39.

(being a martyr)

You don't have to.

I want to. On one condition...

Sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on

Rebecca. They both look at Rebecca in the mirror. Wow.

Rebecca smiles.

I love it, who's the designer?

What are you, a label whore?! Who

cares ...I got it at a flea market

and it looks great with the dress.

Rebecca nods in agreement.

It just needs one last touch...

She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her

dresser. She places them in Rebecca's hand.

I'm gonna jump in the shower, then

we'll head out.

She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door.

Rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm. She turns towards the

full-length mirror behind the door. As she leans into the

mirror, we see that her ears aren't pierced.

She takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the

skin of her right lobe. After a moment of hesitation...

SHE PUSHES THE PIN IN HARD. A small pop. She flinches. Blood

trickles down her ear onto her neck. She wipes it off with

her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear.

INT. ART GALLERY - DUSK

Sara and Rebecca at the Richard Prince showing. The paintings

are all similar to the one we saw in the museum. A series of

women, peering at the viewer.

40.

Rebecca wears her hair up, showing off her earrings. Every

guy in the room is checking out these two babes. But

Rebecca's into the art, and Sara is texting Stephen.

ON CELL PHONE: "sorry. next time : ("

Rebecca notices and frowns. Sara puts the phone away and

starts studying the paintings.

EXT. COLLEGE DORM - NIGHT

It's night and there's not a soul in sight.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

We track slowly down the empty hallway, towards the door to

the...

INT. DORM ROOM - LATER

Sara sleeps peacefully. Cuddles lies on top of her, awake.

Her eyes glowing in the dark. Creepy. But not as creepy as...

Rebecca in the other bed. She's staring back at the kitten.

Envy in her eyes. Of Cuddles... or of Sara?

Rebecca removes the covers and quietly gets out of bed. She

walks over to Sara's bed... but not to pet Cuddles. She

stands directly above Sara. Looking down at her. If Sara

would simply open her eyes, she'd see her.

INT. DORM ROOM - BARELY SUNRISE

Tracy is passed out in her bed. She stirs as she wakes. She

reaches around her, slapping her end table.

Water. I need water.

She stumbles to the mini-fridge and looks in: Empty. She

groans. She grabs an empty cup... opens her door...

And lets out a sharp little scream.

INT. DORM - HALLWAY - SAME

Rebecca sits right across from Tracy's door, her back against

the wall. Staring at Tracy.

41.

Rebecca? What are you doing?

Rebecca cocks her head at Tracy, as if she's trying to

comprehend her. A beat. She stands... and walks to her.

Tracy takes a step back, shaken by Rebecca's calm, morose

demeanor. Rebecca stares right into her eyes.

She makes a slight move towards Tracy, who flinches. Rebecca

turns and walks down to her room. At her door, she turns and

smiles. She disappears into her room.

Tracy stands there, spooked.

EXT. QUADS - DAY

AERIAL VIEW of Sara and Rebecca walking to class. Tracy walks

ten yards behind them, waiting until...

Rebecca and Sara wave "goodbye" to each other and head down

different paths. Tracy hurries after Sara and catches up.

Hey. How was the party? Are you

still the beer bong queen?

But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop.

Listen... something is up with your

roommate.

What do you mean?

She was outside my room this

morning.

Doing what?

Waiting for me. I opened my door...

and there she was. Just sitting

there, staring. Like some psycho.

Are you sure?

42.

You don't believe me?

No, it's just... why would she do

that?

Why don't you ask her? I've gotta

go...I'll see ya later.

Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy

turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes

catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building.

Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway.

Tracy leaves in a hurry.

INT. CLASSROOM / STUDIO

Sara sits in her Design class. Professor Roberts stands at

the podium. Three white design mannequins behind him, each

sporting a different fashion style.

Contrary to popular opinion, beauty

is not in the eye of the beholder.

It's in the hands of the designer.

Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes

with a text message. She discreetly takes a look.

Who can tell me the difference

between fashion and style?

FROM IRENE: "4th & ford. be there now." Sara smiles at the

message.

Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and

calls on her.

Miss Matthews?

Without missing a beat, Sara replies.

Fashion's something you can buy,

but style you either have or you

don't.

43.

Exactly. All the money in the

world can't buy you style.

But it can buy you a good stylist.

The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles.

EXT. BUILDING - DAY

Sara comes out of the building, texting on her cell as she

walks. Rebecca is waiting, holding two cups of coffee.

Hey. How'd you know when my class

got out?

Rebecca shrugs, playing it off.

I'm your roommate.

Sara smiles and grabs a cup.

Thanks.

EXT. QUADS - LATER

They walk through the quads. Other students are around, some

strolling leisurely, others rushing to get to class.

Listen... Tracy told me something

kinda weird. She says you... scared

her this morning.

Rebecca stops and looks at Sara. She starts laughing.

What?

Yeah.

44.

It's more like she scared me. She

was racing to the bathroom like she

was gonna hurl. She almost knocked

me over.

A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles.

The girl does like to party.

Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.

Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from

Irene: "where r u?!?!?!"

I gotta go meet Irene.

(raises her cup)

Thanks for the coffee.

Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip.

EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

Sara gets out of a cab. She looks up at a big building.

INT. STUDIO - HALLWAY

Sara walks through a design studio. Models and make-up

artists are rushing around, dragging thousands of dollars

worth of dresses. Sara loves the place's chaotic energy.

She knocks on an open door and sees a YOUNG MODEL being

worked on by a designer who isn't much older. IRENE, 28.

(mouth full of pins)

Finally.

She gets up to hug Sara. Nearly tearing the dress.

INT. STUDIO - BACKSTAGE - LATER

Irene is putting a dress together on a MODEL. Sara watches in

awe. An OLDER DESIGNER walks by... checks on Irene's work...

nods his approval... and leaves.

I so want to be you when I grow up.

45.

Hell, I wanna be me when I grow up.

She's going to be a star.

Irene rolls her eyes.

You know, your dad left me four

messages last week. Making sure I'm

looking out for his baby.

Oh god. I hope you told him I'm

closing down the library every

night.

I told him I haven't seen you. And

that for all I know you're a crack

ho by now.

Even the model laughs.

Perfect.

INT. LIBRARY - DUSK

Sara walks along, looking for a table. She spots Stephen

sitting by himself. Drumming on his leg with a pencil.

Ignoring the open textbook in front of him.

She sits down across from him. They both smile.

I haven't seen you around too much

since you blew me off for dinner.

Sorry again. Actually, how about

dinner tonight?

Hellllo. I'm studying.

She takes his book. He's on page two.

Page two? Busted!

46.

Yeah, but it's really dense.

Off Sara's smile.

Okay. Let's go.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kim exits the bathroom and passes Tracy coming the other way.

How's it goin?

Hey.

Tracy, wearing just a towel, and brushing her teeth as she

walks, steps into the bathroom.

INT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT

She hums to herself as she spits out the toothpaste.

She removes the towel and steps into the shower, pulling the

curtain closed. As she shampoos her hair...

The lights go out.

You have to be kidding me. Hey!

The only light is some distorted moonlight through the

window. Tracy steps out of the shower, grabbing her towel.

Just as she starts to feel her way along the wall...

The lights come back on. She sighs happily... sheds her

towel... and steps back under the steaming water. A beat.

The lights go off again.

Goddammit !

She turns off the shower. A beat of silence, but now... one

of the other showers turns on. What the hell?

Hey, how about turning on the

light?

47.

No response. Yet another shower turns on.

Who's out there?

Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along

the wall again. She turns on the lights.

The curtains are drawn in front of both running showers.

Tracy stares at them. A beat.

I know it's you.

She walks over to the shower. A beat. She rips away one

curtain. Nothing behind it but the running shower. She turns

it off. She stares at the other curtain.

Sara thinks you're weird. She told

me.

She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off

that shower, too. But she can still hear running water.

She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed

again. The sound of running water behind it.

She walks over.

Not funny, Rebecca.

(under her breath)

Bitch.

She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the

curtain open to see...

Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around --

no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the

water. Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower.

Freak.

Just as the warm water starts to relax her...

THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca.

The curtain comes right off the rings.

Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor

hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both.

48.

Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against

the wall. The shower curtain covers her from the neck down.

Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca.

So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me

tell you what I think. I think

you're a little whore, and a bad

influence on her. And I think that

if you tell anyone about... what

I'm about to do... you'll regret

it.

Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other

hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further.

Rebecca finds what she's looking for... gets the grip she

needs... and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain.

A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face.

Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor,

Rebecca looks down at...

The bloody ring in her hand.

Nice belly ring.

She tosses it to Tracy... and walks away.

INT. FRAT HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sara and Stephen are sitting on a couch. His arm around her

shoulder, lightly playing with the ends of her hair.

I'm going to flunk my test

tomorrow, thanks to you.

Then let's make sure it was worth

it.

She gives him a slow, lingering kiss.

Duh, joke's on you. I was going to

flunk anyway.

She smiles.

49.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca sits on her bed, petting Cuddles, blood still on her

fingers, humming the tune that Tracy was humming in the

bathroom. She hears steps and voices in the hallway. She

smiles -- must be Sara.

She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep. But

the steps pass her door and keep going. Not Sara.

She turns on the light. Worry in her eyes. She picks up her

cell phone and dials.

INT. DORM LOUNGE - NIGHT

Sara and Stephen step off the elevator. Time to say goodbye.

Thanks for helping me... not study.

Anytime.

He kisses her. Sweet and tender. Until... Sara sees Rebecca.

Standing just five feet away. Staring at them.

Where were you?

Oh, hi.

I kept calling and calling.

Oh. I turned my cell off at the

library and forgot to turn it back

on.

Rebecca... this is Stephen.

He flashes a smile. Rebecca doesn't even look at him.

I'm going to bed now. I'm glad

you're okay.

She walks out of the lounge. A beat. That was awkward. Sara

bites her lip, as if to say: "What can you do?"

50.

You got a curfew?

Well, she's right...I shoulda

called.

He smiles -- no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the

elevator. They look at each other, waiting for the ancient

doors to close. Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more

kiss. The doors close.

Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door

and sighs.

EXT. QUADS - MORNING

Sara and Rebecca walk in silence, sipping their coffees.

Rebecca looks straight ahead, listening to her Walkman. As

they reach the fork in the path...

I guess I'll see you later.

Sara...

Last night. I was just worried

about you.

You don't need to worry about me.

I can take care of myself. Okay?

Rebecca slowly nods.

Sara. We're good, right?

A beat. Sara nods and smiles.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Sara and Stephen at a table, books spread around them.

Stephen is reading Rolling Stone.

Sara's on her laptop, checking her Facebook page. She gets a

message for adding a new friend... from Rebecca. She clicks

to add her.

51.

INT. LIBRARY

Rebecca sits in a chair on the other side of the library.

Unbeknownst to Sara and Stephen, Rebecca watches them through

the glass.

INT. LIBRARY

Sara clicks onto Rebecca's Facebook page. She's listed only

one friend: Sara. She's posted the picture of her and Sara in

front of the graffiti wall. And some of her drawings. And a

picture of a pretty brunette teenager, captioned "Maria."

Sara looks at Rebecca's interests. Favorite Artist: Richard

Prince. Favorite Passion: Drawing. Favorite movie: Coyote

Ugly. Sara smiles. Best Friend: SARA. Her smile fades.

I'm already her best friend?

That's a little sad.

Stop.

But the look on her face says she agrees.

Maybe she REALLY likes you...if you

know what I mean.

She looks at him quizzically.

I don't.

He just looks at her, raising his eyebrows suggestively.

You... are...a...moron.

He grins.

INT. LIBRARY - PERIODICAL RACKS

Rebecca watches Stephen kiss Sara, her expression is tough to

read. Is she jealous... or entranced? Sara gets up and

leaves. Stephen goes to the stacks.

52.

INT. LIBRARY - STACKS - LATER

Stephen, alone, searches for a book among the remote stacks.

The stacks are massive and endless -- row after row of them.

Stephen thumbs through books, not finding the one he needs.

He drops a book and bends down to pick it up. Over his

shoulder, we see...

REBECCA'S EYES in the space between the shelves. She's in the

next aisle over.

Stephen replaces the book. He walks down the aisle, looking

at the numbers of the books.

Rebecca mimics his pacing as she follows him down her aisle.

Her hands gently brush against the books, her eyes on

Stephen. He turns in her direction and stops in his tracks.

So does Rebecca. She's completely still.

Stephen walks over. He puts his hand on the book that covers

Rebecca. He's about to pull it out and reveal her. But it's

not the right one. He keeps walking.

He reaches the end of his aisle... and Rebecca the end of

hers. She's right around the corner from him. He reads the

markers at the end of the aisle, trying to figure out which

direction to go.

Rebecca's hands are sweaty. She's nervous. Does she want to

get caught? Stephen turns right, away from her, and starts

down the next aisle.

Rebecca softly exhales. And now whispers to herself.

Stephen.

Stephen stops dead. Did he hear something? Guess not. He

keeps going, scanning the book numbers again.

Shit, wrong aisle.

He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle. But it's...

EMPTY. We hear a door close in the distance.

53.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

Stephen and Sara walk on a tree-lined path. Holding hands. He

checks his watch.

Should we head back home?

They walk by a small playground comprised of the slide,

jungle gym, etc.

The question is "whose home?"

Hmmm...

I'll make you a bet. I go back to

your place or you take me home to

my twin bed and roommate.

What's the bet?

She eyes the jungle gym.

EXT. PARK - PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

Sara and Stephen are each hanging from the jungle gym. This

has been going on for a few minutes. Both straining.

Stephen's worse off.

This is kind of a stupid bet.

Why'd you agree?

Apparently, I'm kind of a stupid

guy.

Making me laugh isn't going to help

you.

They stare each other down. She's stifling a laugh, much

more in control as Stephen is straining.

54.

He tries to swing his legs and kick her. She avoids him. He

catches a peek at her bare midriff. Finally, this makes him

fall. She then lets go, victorious.

I was a gymnast until I hit a

growth spurt my freshman year.

Stephen brushes himself off. Dejected that he was "this

close". She walks up to him. Cocky. Gives him a playful

shove.

So I win.

He gives her a playful shove back.

So.

She seductively walks back towards him. Takes his hand.

So...let's go back to your place.

She gives him a seductive grin.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca sketches in her bed. She looks at the clock: 1:00

a.m. And no Sara. History is repeating itself.. .and Rebecca's

pissed. She rips out her sketch page and throws it away.

She starts pacing the floor. She angrily moves Sara's chair

back to her side. She whips out her phone and eyes the dial

button. She starts to dial... but kills the call.

She picks up her sketchpad again. Suddenly:

A BUZZING SOUND from Sara's desk. Rebecca pulls out the desk

drawer and finds Sara's cell phone. On the call screen:

"JASON".

A long beat. She pushes the talk button... but just listens.

Sara?

Mmmm?

55.

she lies down.

I miss you.

She moves her hand across her stomach.

You do?

I want you, Jason.

Rebecca's hand moves toward her panties.

INT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sara and Stephen slam along the walls, in a fever. Kissing

madly, missing each other's mouths. At his door... he cracks

it open and peeks inside.

His room is a disaster. Definitely a new world record for

empty beer cans, pizza boxes, and strewn clothes.

Just give me thirty seconds.

You're kidding.

56.

But he slips into the room and closes the door behind him.

Sara leans back against the wall. Flushed, breathing hard.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - SAME

Stephen is a whirlwind. He tosses everything -- beer cans,

clothes, study papers -- into one big garbage bag.

Almost there.

SARA (O.S.)

(through the door)

I'm going to start taking my

clothes off out here.

Yeah, right.

He's not quite buying it... but he's cleaning faster.

SARA (O.S.)

Oops! There goes my shirt...

She's got his attention now. He speeds up.

You know I don't believe you.

Wait, goddamnit, that's supposed to

be my strip tease.

SARA (O.S.)

There go the jeans.

He's popping breath mints... while clearing off his bed.

I'm just going to put your clothes

back on and make you strip again.

SARA (O.S.)

Hmmm. What's next? Top or bottom?

Stephen stops and stares at the door.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME

Sara stands there, fully dressed. She looks down the empty

hallway.

57.

Who do we have here? Hey guys! Let

me ask you. Bra or panties? Bra?

Okay, okay. Just calm down.

The door swings open. Stephen stands in front of her,

grinning.

I knew you didn't have the guts.

She flicks her bra at his face. He catches it, shocked. He

tosses it aside and yanks her into the room. The door slams

shut behind them.

INT. DORM ROOM - SAME

Rebecca is breathing harder and faster now. Still holding the

phone, from which we hear Jason's moans.

Say my name, Jason. Until I tell

you to stop.

She puts the phone on speaker and lays it on the pillow

beside her. Both her hands ease back under the covers.

JASON (O.S.)

Sara... Sara... Sara...

Rebecca writhes, eyes closed.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM

Sara and Stephen make out in bed, half-naked. He lies on top

of her. Looking into her eyes. Sweet and intimate.

Sara...

INT. DORM ROOM - SAME

Rebecca writhes and moans.

JASON (O.S.)

Sara... Sara...

They moan together. Louder and louder... and now they finish.

A long beat.

58.

JASON (O.S.)

(catching his breath)

Jesus, Sara. That was incredible.

Rebecca smiles.

JASON (O.S.)

I miss you so much.

Her smile dies. She picks up the phone. A cruel gleam in her

eyes.

Don't ever call me again.

She kills the call. And now deletes it from the phone log.

EXT. CARNEGIE DORM - MORNING

Carnegie Dorm on a bright, clear morning.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

Sara, hair mussed up but eyes shining. Sara opens her door

and steps in. She's tentative, expecting Rebecca to jump down

her throat. But Rebecca smiles.

Well, good morning.

Hey. Sorry I didn't call. I forgot

my phone.

No problem.

Sara opens her desk drawer and grabs her phone. She quickly

checks. No calls.

Rebecca looks Sara over and smiles.

Come on...don't I get any details??

A nice girl doesn't kiss and tell.

They laugh. A nice, easy vibe between them.

59.

You want to go get some breakfa--

Before she can finish, Cuddles bolts out the door and down

the hallway.

Oh no.

Sara chases after her as Rebecca gets up from her bed.

INT. HALLWAY

Sara turns the corner to see...

The resident assistant, with Cuddles cradled in her arms.

Sara apprehensively walks up to him.

R.A.

Is this your cat, Sara?

Maybe...

R.A.

She's cute...

She nods as she gingerly takes Cuddles from his arms. She

turns to walk back to the room.

R.A.

And if you keep her, I lose my job.

Do we understand each other?

She stops. Turns. Looks at him.

Yes.

Sara walks back to her room. Rebecca stands in the doorway.

They exchange despondent looks. Screwed.

INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Irene opens the door and Sara walks in.

What took you so long?

I walked.

60.

You didn't!

It's ten bucks for a cab and I'm a

student.

Sara! You can't just walk around

downtown L.A. at night. This is

not Des Moines.

Duh?

Seriously, listen to me. That's

why I own a gun.

Sara's shocked.

What?!

Absolutely! Big cities are

crawling with crazies.

Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She

answers.

Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at

Irene's. I meant to leave you a

note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a

good idea. Let me check, hold on.

Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene.

Do you like cats?

Yeah, why?

We have to get rid of one.

Can't. Travel too much. Poor

thing would starve to death.

61.

You're right.

(back into phone)

No, she can't. Huh? Oh I don't

know... whenever I get there. Bye.

Who was that?

My roommate. More than a little

overprotective.

That's no fun.

So, where is it?

What?

You said you had a surprise for me?

Oh yeah. I went through my

closet. There's nothing here I've

worn in the past six months.

Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes.

You're kidding, all of these?! Oh

no.

What ...what?

We have no closet space at the

dorms. Rebecca's already using

half of mine.

Oh my God, I just had the best

idea.

What?

Why don't you move in here with me?

62.

Seriously?

Yeah, I'm never here. The place is

huge. Ditch the roommate. And,

the building allows pets.

Huh. Let me talk to Rebecca about

it.

Great.

So, how's Jason? I really liked

him.

We broke up.

Yeah ...he sucked.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Sara stuffs her new clothes into her tiny closet. The bags

spill out into the room, taking up floor space.

Rebecca sits on her bed, her laptop open. She's staring at

Irene's Facebook Profile. There are some racy pictures of

Irene and some girlfriends.

Hey. What're those?

Irene gave them to me. She had a

lot more but we don't have the

room.

Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles,

huh?

Well, maybe that's not a problem.

Really?

63.

Yeah. She actually suggested that

I move in with her.

What?

You want to move?

No, of course not. I love living

here... with you.

Sara smiles as she sits down next to Rebecca, trying to put a

bright spin on things.

Look, I'd still technically be

living here. So you wouldn't have

to get a new roommate. Her place is

huge and it's not like you couldn't

use the extra closet space. I'd

just move some of my stuff over,

and spend a few nights a week

there. We'd both have a lot more

space.

I don't want more space. I want...

She checks herself. A beat of awkward silence.

Nothing's set in stone. It's just

something to think about. Plus we'd

be able to keep Cuddles.

As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares

across the room at...

Cuddles.

EXT. QUADS - DAY

As Sara crosses the quads, she spots Tracy up ahead, walking

by herself.

Tracy!

Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking. As if she

didn't hear anything. Sara hurries to catch up with her.

64.

Tracy... hey.

Oh, hey.

Tracy smiles, but weakly. The girl's lost all her sparkle.

Her eyes dart around nervously, like a bird's.

I heard you changed dorms.

Yeah, Conrad Hall. Seemed like a

better vibe.

Well, we should get together. Like

grab a bite or something. Right?

REBECCA (O.S.)

Sara!

Sara turns and waves at Rebecca.

Hi.

Rebecca starts to walk over to Tracy and Sara.

I'll call you.

But she's already walking away.

Tracy?!

What was that about?

I don't know. She just walked

away.

Well, she's always been a flake.

65.

INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Sara whips up a latte for a customer, her cell phone to her

ear. She's really got the hang of this job now. In charge,

moving with a purpose.

She snatches an issue of High Times from her co-worker's hand

and points him toward the sink. He starts washing blenders.

Hey. I do so call, Mom. Geez.

Her latte customer rolls his eyes. Moms. He takes his drink

and walks away.

Well, actually, I was thinking I'd

do Thanksgiving here and see you

guys for Christmas.

She listens, her face telling us that she doesn't like what

she's hearing.

Ya know what, I'm at work, and I'm

really getting slammed...

There isn't another customer in sight.

I'll call you later, okay? Tell

Dad I said hello. Bye.

She hangs up the phone and sighs.

INT. DORM ROOM - DUSK

Rebecca gathers her laundry into a giant duffle bag. As she

carries it toward the door, she passes Cuddles, curled up on

Sara's bed. She scoops her up.

Looks like it's just you and me

tonight.

INT. DORM BASEMENT HALLWAY - DUSK

Rebecca walks downstairs, down the hallway to the laundry

room.

66.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

Rebecca waits for her clothes to finish drying. Cuddles plays

with a sock on top of a nearby washer.

Rebecca checks on her clothes. They're dry, with two minutes

still left on the timer. She stuffs the clothes into her

duffle bag. She walks to the washers and picks up Cuddles.

She pets her gently.

She walks back to the dryer and places Cuddles inside.

See how nice and warm it is in

there?

Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth. Rebecca closes the door

and watches the confused kitten paw at the glass.

She gently pushes the start button, just enough to get the

dryer moving for a sec. Cuddles stumbles, falls over, and

gets back up.

Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time.

Cuddles stumbles. Flips over.

The dryer beeps. OUT OF TIME. Cuddles meows at Rebecca,

wanting out. She reaches into her pocket... and pulls out her

last quarter. She gently places it in the slot.

ON DRYER DISPLAY: 15 MINUTES. Rebecca stares through the

glass at the kitten. She fingers the button.

Before she pushes it --

INT. DORM ROOM - LATER

Sara walks in to find Rebecca sprawled on her bed, crying.

She rushes over.

Hey, what's wrong?

Rebecca looks up at her, eyes red. Ashamed.

Cuddles got out.

67.

Oh no. In the dorm?

Outside.

What?!

I was doing laundry... I took her

with me... She jumped out of the

bag and ran outside. I went after

her, but...

I'm so sorry.

Sara stands, pissed. She wants to really go off on Rebecca...

but the girl's so distraught, so fragile.

Maybe she'll come back.

She won't.

I'm going to go find her.

Do you want me to help?

But Sara's already gone, slamming the door behind her.

INT. CAFETERIA - MORNING

Sara and Rebecca sit alone at a table. Eating quietly.

Maybe it's... just karma or

something. We weren't allowed to

keep her anyway.

You're not mad at me?

It was an accident.

It's just... stress after stress,

you know?

68.

Is something else wrong?

A beat as Sara decides whether to confide.

My parents really want me to come

home for Thanksgiving.

You don't want to go?

It's not exactly the most festive

holiday in the Matthews household.

Emily died two days before

Thanksgiving.

A beat. Rebecca pats Sara's hand.

I know I should be there with them,

but it's like there's a ghost at

the table.

You can come with me.

What?

Rebecca sits up, her excitement growing.

Yeah, spend Thanksgiving at my

house.

Your folks wouldn't mind?

Please. Like they'd even notice.

Okay, we'll see. Thanks.

69.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Professor Roberts stands at the blackboard, wrapping up a

lecture.

Your midterm designs are due

Friday. Remember, class:

Simplicity. Who founded our

industry? Eve -- when she handed

Adam that fig leaf.

Students laugh on their way out the door. As Sara walks past

Roberts...

Sara. Could I see you in my office,

please?

Sure. I've got a class right now.

But I'll come right after it.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Sara knocks on Professor Roberts' open door. She steps into

his office. It's small and intimate, with books stacked along

every wall. Scraps of fabric are pinned to cork boards.

Roberts smiles at her from his chair. He walks to the door

and closes it. He walks back, pulls a chair close to hers,

and sits down. She crosses her legs, her knees accidentally

brushing against his.

I don't think I need to tell you

how impressed I've been with your

work.

Every year I go to Fashion Week in

Paris. It's dazzling. The photo

shoots... the parties... that

incredible runway. When the first

model bursts through the curtain

and hits that catwalk? Sara, a roar

goes up from that crowd that's

like... nothing you've ever heard.

The college allows me to take one

student. All expenses paid.

70.

PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT-D)

Full backstage access. Usually,

it's a senior.

But it doesn't have to be.

Sara's pulse is racing.

I'm not sure I understand. Are you

saying what I think you're saying?

I'm saying you have a shot. You'd

have to earn it, Sara.

Of course. I'll do... anything.

Roberts stands and walks to the window. He looks out at the

quad... and now turns back to Sara.

I'd like to see more danger in your

work. Your designs are always

crisp; they're always clear. But

they're a little... safe.

That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face.

Roberts walks over to her.

Don't be afraid to go to some of

the...

He delicately taps her temple.

PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT'D)

darker places in here.

Okay...

He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks

into her eyes.

The best designers push the

boundaries of what's... acceptable.

They take chances. Do you like to

take chances, Sara?

Sometimes.

71.

So do I.

He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her

chair. She stands in front of him, shaking.

I can't believe you just did that.

I took a chance, that's all. With a

student that I trust.

I better go.

Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door...

Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't

blow the chance of a lifetime.

She hurries out of the office.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Rebecca sits alone at a study table. Sara walks up and drops

down her books. THUD. Students look over from other tables.

Sara doesn't care. She sits down and stares blankly into

space, trying to forget what just happened. Rebecca leans

over, concerned.

What's wrong?

My design professor just kissed me.

Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next

to Sara.

Are you alright?

Sara nods.

Yeah, it just really creeped me

out. And I think the asshole's

married.

72.

Rebecca puts her hand on Sara's.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

Professor Roberts at his desk, set to call it a day. He

tosses some design sheets into his briefcase.

He opens a desk drawer... grabs his wedding ring... and slips

it onto his finger.

He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. The sexy, unmistakable

clicking of a woman's heels. They come closer... and now stop

at his door.

Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock. Nothing. He

walks to it. He can see the silhouette of two feet at the

bottom of the door. He smiles -- Sara, coming back to him.

He opens the door, revealing:

Rebecca. She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black

jeans, and silver stiletto heels. A small purse on her

shoulder.

Roberts swallows his surprise.

Professor Roberts?

That's right.

I'm glad I caught you.

Actually, I was just...

But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels

snapping on the worn hardwood floor.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

Roberts, a little annoyed but also intrigued, follows her

back inside. They face each other.

You're not one of my students.

Not yet. That's why I'm here.

73.

She steps to his desk and leans against it. Her cool manner

is disarming. A beat.

I'm failing Intro Pysch.

And why is that?

Because I'm bored. I thought it

would be all about Freud, and deep

dark secrets. But it's brain

chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay

awake in class.

I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not

sure what I can do to help.

Tomorrow's the last day to drop a

course without penalty. Unless I

can add another one in its place,

I'll fall way behind in credits.

Daddy won't take that very well. He

might even pull the plug. Which

means...

I'm pretty much at your mercy,

Professor.

Roberts smiles. This girl is a trip. Is she for real? She's

Look, I've always made it a policy

not to accept any students this

late in the term.

Do I look like just any student to

you?

She smiles... and eases up onto his desk. Facing him. Pretty

feet dangling, ankles locked. Jesus.

She eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk. She

sees the framed picture of a WOMAN AND TWO KIDS. She picks it

up.

Your wife is very pretty.

74.

Ex-wife .

until he's behind Rebecca.

his wedding ring. He palms it.

A few things I'd need to know.

Ask me anything.

He's circling the desk now. Predator and prey.

Do you have any design experience?

None.

What do you know about clothes?

Only one thing.

And what's that?

I definitely look better out of

them than in them.

What an answer. Roberts stops in front of her. He moves in

Still steady.

I think we might be able to work

something out.

Great. Just tell me and I'll do

anything.

Kiss me.

I'll take it from there.

75.

He kisses her. She opens her lips for a tantalizing second,

and now gently pushes him away. He holds his ground. He's had

a taste -- he wants a lot more.

Suddenly, Rebecca's face hardens.

Ow! You're hurting me! Professor,

stop!...

Roberts stares at her in shock. He's not even touching her.

What's going on? Rebecca smiles again.

This girl is whacked. But damn, Roberts wants her. And her

eyes are inviting him back. As he presses in to kiss her

again...

She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the

floor, gasping for air. He drops his wedding ring, which

rolls away across the floor.

Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open. We can

see the Walkman inside. She takes it out. Smiles at him.

Birthday gift. You should get one,

they're great.

She slips on the earbuds... plays with the Walkman for a few

seconds... and now hits the play button. We hear their prior

conversation, played back.

Great. Just tell me and I'll do

anything.

Kiss me. I'll take it from there.

Owl You're hurting me! Professor,

stop!...

Rage and betrayal in Roberts' eyes.

You bitch tease!

Oh, I'm not teasing.

She starts to circle him now, as he writhes in pain on the

floor.

76.

Do you see enough danger in me now,

Professor? Did I go to a dark

enough place for you?

He recognizes his own words to Sara.

What? How did?... Who are you?

He lunges at her ankle. She steps out of his grasp... and

slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand. He yells

again.

She trusted you.

She walks toward the door.

Please don't do this. Twenty years.

Everything I worked for. I'll pay

for that tape.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM

holding a theory book in her hand.

Stephen watches her from his side of the bed.

Anything wrong?

Sara is taken out of her own world

What?

Are you ok?

Yeah, sure.

77.

She smiles. Stephen smiles back.

Sara looks down in her book again.

EXT. QUADS - DAY

Sara looks up at the building. She sighs before she enters.

INT. HALLWAY

She walks slowly toward the classroom, letting other students

pass her. She steps into the doorway and sees...

INT. CLASSROOM

A WOMAN, standing at Professor Roberts' podium. She gestures

for everyone to come in. Sara, like the rest, is confused.

Welcome. I'm Professor Jacobs. I'll

be taking over the class for the

rest of the semester.

Sara can't believe it. She takes a seat and turns to the

STUDENT next to her.

What happened?

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

Sara walks in with a tray, still a bit dazed. She sees a half-

dozen hallmates milling about and Rebecca sitting by herself

in the corner, drawing. Sara joins her.

Remember what I told you about

Professor Roberts?

Yeah?

He's gone.

What do you mean?

78.

Well, they're calling it a leave of

absence. But what I heard... someone

sent the dean an anonymous

recording of him hitting on another

student.

Oh My God.

I know.

That's called Karma.

INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

Sara serves up two fresh lattes... and now leans against the

counter to watch the band. Stephen's band. He catches her

looking at him. She smiles. Seriously smitten.

INT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Stephen, sweaty, is behind the counter helping Sara clean up.

I've made a decision. You ready?

Lemme hear it.

I'm gonna quit the band.

No. Really? Why?

It's a waste of time-and we suck.

Why would you say that?

Well, let me think about this. The

only places we can get booked is at

my own frat house and at my

girlfriend's coffee shop.

79.

You're right. You guys do suck.

A beat.

Hold it. Did you just say

girlfriend?

You heard me.

So you think it'll be fun to stay

here during Thanksgiving?

Dinner at the frat, the football

games. Don't forget the always

awkward, homoerotic humor.

Sounds like a blast.

Oh. For sure.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

A somber Rebecca stares at herself in the full-length mirror

on the back of the front door. A very strange expression in

her eyes. She looks herself over, makes a fist, and now...

Punches herself on the temple. Hard. She staggers, nearly

knocked out. She straightens. Looks in the mirror. Her skin

is already bruising. She punches herself again. Same spot.

And again, with her other fist this time. And now a shot to

her shoulder. And another. It's painful to watch. But she's

getting more and more numb to the blows.

She inspects herself closely... and now reaches down and

grabs an artist's UTILITY KNIFE. It looks like a large,

retractable box cutter. She extends the blade all the way

out. She pulls up her shirt. Turns to the side a bit. Places

the knife against her skin and...

80.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

Sara opens the door and finds Rebecca curled up in a fetal

position in a corner of the room. Sobbing. Sara drops her

things and runs over to her.

Oh my God. What happened?

She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her

knees. Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms.

Rebecca. It's okay. You're safe

now. Talk to me.

I was looking for Cuddles. A man...

pulled me into an alley. He

tried...

Sara holds her. She can't finish.

It's okay. It's okay. Shhh.

I got away.

You're alright now.

Sara notices a streak of blood against Rebecca's shirt. She

pulls it up and sees a slash. Gasps.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

Rebecca, newly showered, hair still wet, sits on her bed in

her underwear. Sara is tending to her wounds. Ice for the

bruises. Disinfectant for the cut. Rebecca flinches.

It's not deep, thank God. But you

should see a doctor.

No.

Rebecca, you need to. And then the

police.

81.

Rebecca pulls back on her bed, ruining the gauze job.

I don't want to. I can't.

Sara pulls out her cell phone.

You're calling them, or I am.

There's a psycho walking around

this campus.

Please. I didn't see him.

She's so frazzled, she's undoing Sara's nursing efforts.

Okay, okay. I won't call. Just let

me help you.

Rebecca calms down. Let's Sara finish. Watching her intently

as she works.

EXT. STREET - DORM - DAY

Sara's on the sidewalk in front of her dorm with Stephen.

Inside, the lobby is busy with students getting ready to go

home for the holiday.

Sorry about not staying. But,

Rebecca...

I get it.

I'm going to make out with my

pillow and pretend it's you.

Just say you'll miss me.

I'll miss you.

Rebecca pulls up in her car. Sara gets in. Rebecca gives

Stephen an "I win" look as Sara closes the door.

82.

INT. CAR - DRIVING: LATER

Sara looks down at her phone.

I haven't heard from Jason in

weeks. It's weird how he just

stopped calling.

It's what you wanted, right?

Sara nods, reassuring herself.

Yeah. Yeah it is.

Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile.

EXT. GATED MANSION - DUSK

Rebecca's car pulls up to the iron gates of a huge mansion

that could be straight out of Lifestyles of the Rich and

Famous.

EXT. SIDEWALK - DUSK

Rebecca and Sara stand in the driveway, looking up at the

mansion. Sara is in shock.

This is your home?

It's my parents house. It was

never a home.

INT. FOYER - DUSK

Rebecca and Sara walk in. Rebecca's on edge, flinching as

Sara closes the door.

Rebecca's parents rush in from the living room. Her father

gives her an awkward hug.

We didn't think you would make it.

83.

Her mother sees the bruises on her face.

What happened?

Nothing.

Nothing? This isn't nothing.

Leave it alone.

Sara is stunned. But Rebecca's parents cease. Her mom gives

her a tender, protracted embrace. Rebecca endures it, barely

raising her arms.

Hello. And you are?

I'm Sara.

She puts out her hand, but cuts Rebecca a look. You didn't

tell them?

Sara's my roommate.

I'm Jeff.

Rebecca's mother comes over and unexpectedly embraces Sara.

It's so great to meet you, Sara.

I'm Alison.

Rebecca grabs Sara by the arm.

Come on, let me show you my room.

INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - DUSK

Rebecca slams the door behind them, startling Sara.

84.

You didn't tell them we were

coming?

They didn't need to know.

Rebecca plops down on the bed. Sara looks around. It's a

typical teenage girl's bedroom. Except, no posters. Just

drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage

girls -- more precisely, they're different drawings of one

teenage girl. They're odd, but compelling.

These are interesting.

Yeah, some of my high school work.

I haven't gotten around to takin

them down.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Family and guest sit around a very nice, but not too large

dining table. The contents of the house are expensive but

not pretentious.

Rebecca plays with her food, clearly not wanting to engage

her parents, who are undaunted. All smiles and warmth.

Rebecca's a pretty great artist.

Yeah, we think Rebecca is so

talented.

Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery.

She's an awesome roommate, too.

(looks at his daughter,

That's nice to hear and I'm sure

she likes you because she never

brings anyone home before.

Rebecca stares at her father.

85.

Dad!

What? As a parent you worry. You

protect your daughter all her life

and then she goes off to college

and she's on her own. I'm just

relieved she got a good roommate.

Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these

people?

Sara, I'll make up a room for you --

She'll stay in my room.

Sara turns to Rebecca, confused but willing to go along.

INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sara and Rebecca are getting ready to sleep. Sara has made a

makeshift bed in the middle of the floor.

We can share the bed if you want.

Sara looks down at her own "bed" and takes a glance at the

walls. On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the

drawings of Rebecca looking at her.

Sure.

Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back.

Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed.

Thanks for coming.

Next Thanksgiving, you can run

interference with my family.

Done.

Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A

beat. She opens her eyes -- just inches from Sara. She ever

so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair.

86.

Sara opens her eyes for a second. Not sure if she felt

something. She closes them again.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Jeff walks from the stairs into the pitch black kitchen. He's

lived here long enough to know his way in the dark.

Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates

Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father.

Jeff jumps. He recovers, standing by the open fridge.

Becs. You scared me.

Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty

look. We know how much she hates nicknames.

INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sara wakes up alone in bed. She can hear soft voices from

downstairs. She climbs out of bed and walks to the door.

INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Sara stands at the top of the stairs. She walks down them and

to the kitchen doorway. She peeks inside to see...

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Rebecca and her father sitting at the table. Just the

moonlight through the window falling over them. Spooky.

How're you doing?

Fine. My grades are good.

That's not what I meant.

She looks down at the table.

87.

I'm making friends.

Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat.

Rebecca, look at me for a second.

Now she looks at him.

Your mother and I are very fond of

you.

I know.

He doesn't know what else to say.

Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall.

Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the

beach... on the ski slopes... on a cruise ship. They smile

happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture.

I just wanted to make sure. Good

night, I'm heading back to bed.

He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs.

INT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

Sara waits by the front door. Alison walks in.

Hi Sara.

Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some

of her high school hangouts.

Wonderful.

Alison peers up the stairs.

Rebecca seems to be doing well.

Uhhh, yeah. I think she is.

88.

Is she taking her medication?

Medication?

Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs.

Did she hear them? She walks down.

Hey sweetheart.

She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed.

Ready?

Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words.

Medication? She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully.

Have a great time, you two.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

It's an affluent but quaint little town's main street.

Rebecca and Sara stroll down the sidewalk. Sara cuts

discreet, sideways glances at Rebecca.

Is everything okay?

Yeah. It's just...

She wants to ask her about that medication.

Nice to see where you come from.

Come on.

INT. COFFEE SHOP DAY

Sara and Rebecca are in line for their drinks. The TEENAGE

CASHIER takes their money... but keeps staring at Rebecca.

She doesn't pay any attention to him. Sara takes her coffee.

89.

Thanks.

The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out.

What's she doing with Rebecca?

The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep

glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them

a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work.

I used to come here like every day

after school.

The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting.

One BRUNETTE spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks.

Sara recognizes her. It's MARIA, the girl from Rebecca's

Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches.

The chatting girls all fall silent.

You know them?

They went to my high school.

Friends?

Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye

contact with the Brunette.

The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves.

Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance.

As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible.

The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances

at Rebecca as they order their drinks.

Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls.

Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette.

Suddenly, Rebecca gets up.

Let's leave.

Rebecca walks towards the door. Sara, confused, gathers her

things and gets up. Rebecca stops at the Brunette's table.

The Brunette sits there, like a deer caught in headlights.

90.

Hello, Maria.

Hello.

The other girls walk over. Rebecca, unfazed, looks them over,

sending shivers down their spines. They want to back up their

friend, but they look as scared as she does. Sara watches all

this from a few feet away.

Rebecca suddenly turns cheerful.

Oh, I wanted to introduce you to

Sara. My roommate.

Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over. Almost

as if she feels sorry for her.

Hi.

Rebecca keeps eyeing Maria, a superior grin on her face. An

awkward beat. Everyone's tense. Sara clears her throat.

Well, we better go.

Rebecca snaps out of it. Nods. They start to walk out. But as

they open the door...

Rebecca.

Everyone turns to Maria. She looks Rebecca in the eye.

We were never friends.

Rebecca stares at her, grinding her teeth. The tension

building. Maria doesn't back down, though. She needed to say

this. Sara grabs Rebecca's shoulder, gently.

Come on, let's go.

INT. CAR - DAY: DRIVING

Headed back to school. Sara looks out the window. Lost in

thought.

91.

I guess college is a fresh start

for both of us.

Rebecca doesn't look at her. Just a hint of acknowledgement

on her face.

Sara's phone buzzes. This gets Rebecca's attention. Sara

looks at the text message she just received from Irene:

"back in LA. lemme know abt movin in."

Irene's back in town.

Sara types and sends a text back. Rebecca watches her.

EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY

Sara's running through the quad.

EXT./INT. DORM - DAY

Sara, coming in from a run, times it perfectly, sneaking in

the front door as a student walks out. She bypasses the

elevator, heading straight to the stairs.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

She bursts out the door and into the hallway.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

She walks in, still a bit out of breath. Rebecca is packing

her back-pack.

(not looking up)

Good run?

(between deep breaths)

Great. You wanna go get dinner?

I'm going to the art studio.

Oh. Okay. Catch you later then.

92.

Don't wait up, Sara...

I feel inspired.

She's out the door. Sara notices that Rebecca left her

sketchpad behind on her bed. She eyes it for a beat. Looks at

the closed door.

As she steps toward the sketchpad... Rebecca charges back in.

Forgot my pad.

She snags it from her bed and leaves. Sara eyes Rebecca's

dresser. But first... She walks to the door and opens it.

INT. DORM HALLWAY

Sara peeks her head out and looks down both sides of the

empty hallway. She hears the elevator ding.

INT. DORM ROOM

Sara heads straight for Rebecca's dresser. A beat. Is she

really going to do this? Yes. She slides open the top drawer:

Supplies. The second drawer: sketchpads. She leafs through

them: Empty.

She searches the third drawer: Sweaters. She feels around

beneath them. Wait a minute. She pulls out:

Two bottles of prescription medicine. "LITHIUM... For APD."

Both bottles are full of pills. As Sara stares at them...

A HAND TAPS HER SHOULDER.

She leaps out of her socks. But it's just Stephen.

Your door was open.

Oh my God.

Sorry.

Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her

tight and speaks, muffled by her neck.

93.

What are those?

A beat. Should she bring him into this?

That's what I intend to find out.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT

Rebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her

drawing pad in her other hand. Her arm is wrapped around a

pole for balance. She stares out the window. No emotion. She

looks like she's staring at her own reflection. The train

comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around.

Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her

drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper. She looks

up and we see what she's been staring at:

Irene.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Sara and Stephen stand at Sara's desk, over her computer.

Sara googles "Lithium and APD", and clicks on an entry.

APD -- anti-social personality

disorder. Also known as sociopathy.

They look at each other.

Jesus. I thought she was just

weird.

It says lithium can control the

condition.

(nodding at the bottles)

Maybe these are refills. Maybe

she's been taking it all along.

Certainly doesn't seem like she's

been taking them.

He's right and she knows it. A beat.

94.

I think it's time I moved in with

Irene.

INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

A stylish, hip night club. A sophisticated crowd. Irene and

three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic

martinis and watching the dance floor.

And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by

herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around

her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca.

Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds

her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices

Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE

THAN AN INSTANT, IRENE SMILES AND WALKS AWAY. REBECCA CLOCKS

IT, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

INT. NIGHT CLUB - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Irene stands at the mirror, fixing her make-up. The door

opens and closes. She glances over to see Rebecca walking in.

Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene.

She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms.

Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss. Rebecca is watching her

in the mirror, and Irene knows it. She applies the gloss and

smiles at the little kick it gives her. Her eyes find

Rebecca's in the mirror.

I'm sorry to stare, but you are so

beautiful.

Thanks. So are you. Great lips.

What kind is it?

It's cinnamon. Caffeinated. A girl

never knows how late she's gonna

party.

Rebecca smiles. A beat.

95.

Can I try it?

Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and

pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips.

You're right... cinnamon.

Irene smiles.

This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's.

Why don't we get out of here. I'd

invite you to my place, but I have

a roommate.

As luck would have it, I'm only two

blocks away and...no roommate.

What are we waiting for?

INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

An alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to

the world. She grunts and finally opens her eyes. She wipes

the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to

the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent

the night. Irene sits up and turns off the alarm..

Shit.

She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table.

INT. IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Irene get's up with the empty glass in her hand. She

stumbles out into the...

HALLWAY.

She staggers to keep her balance on her way to the kitchen.

We stay in the hallway as Irene enters in the kitchen and

switches on the light.

96.

We can see her shadow in the hallway and hear Irene fill her

glass. It's quiet for a moment. She drinks. She fills the

glass again.

Irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand. She

switches off the light in the kitchen. But as she starts to

go back to her room ...WHAM!!

Rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into Irene.

CLOSE UP: GLASS EXPLODES ON THE FLOOR

EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

Sara is going for a run through the city. She stops at an old

art deco apartment building.

INT. LOBBY - MORNING

Sara spots Irene's name on the buzzer and calls up. No

answer.

EXT. STREET - MORNING

She walks out the door. Looks around. And takes off running

again.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - MORNING

Sara, hands on hips, walks down the hallway and opens the

door.

INT. DORM ROOM - MORNING

She finds Rebecca, sitting on her bed. Drawing. She lights up

when she sees Sara.

Hey!

Hey yourself. Where were you all

night?

97.

Oh, I got inspired. I just lost

track of time.

Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper,

grabbing a towel. She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her

tattoo. Sara grabs a robe.

A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the

"big talk." She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca.

I want a tattoo.

Will you come with me?

Uhhh...

Please. It would mean a lot to me.

I won't be able to do it without

you.

Sara looks into her plaintive eyes. So much want in them.

Um... sure. Okay.

INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY

The girls walk along the wall, checking out the samples.

You can't rush this, Rebecca. We

can always come back.

I know what I want.

Okay. I'm out here if you need me.

Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs.

She looks giddy and nervous. Sara waves. When she's gone,

Sara takes out her phone and texts Irene.

98.

INT. TATTOO PARLOR - LATER

Sara, bored, leafs through a tattoo magazine for the 100th

time. Her phone buzzes. A response from Irene:

"outta town for a gig. will call when back ; )"

Sara's relieved.

Rebecca walks slowly down the stairs. Wincing in pain. Sara

puts the phone back in her pocket and stands up.

Let's see it.

Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just

under her collarbone:

Sara, stunned speechless, starts backing away from her.

Think of me as your sister.

Rebecca is oblivious to the rage building in Sara.

If you want... you can call me

Emily.

Sara clenches her fists. She's shaking with rage. She moves

toward Rebecca, whose grin fades.

What's the matter?

Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out

of her. And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone.

Her eyes search Sara's for an answer.

Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door. Rebecca watches

her leave through the front window. Sara never looks back.

99.

INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY

The elevator doors open. Sara, emotionally exhausted, steps

out, carrying a box of her things. Stephen waits by the door.

This is all you're taking?

I'll get the rest of my things when

Irene comes back to town.

He takes the box. Then notices --

Where's your necklace?

She instinctively rubs the base of her neck.

I can't find it. It's okay.

Sara...

I'm not going back up there.

He hands her the box. Time to man up.

Wait here. I'll go look for it.

She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Sara walks out to the cab. Pauses. She's tempted to look back

at her dorm room window... but she doesn't.

Good thing, too. Rebecca sits on the ledge, looking down.

Her face is blank. Not hurt, not angry -- completely blank.

INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

Rebecca still sits at the window. She holds her camera up,

taking a picture down below. She turns as Stephen enters.

She puts the camera down.

100.

Have you seen Sara's necklace?

Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the

dresser. In the drawers. Flips over Sara's pillow. Rebecca

watches him.

What did I do?

He stops searching. Looks at her.

She just needs to move on.

With you?

He doesn't answer. He keeps searching... but he can feel

Rebecca's eyes on him now. Creepy. He gives up.

If you do find it, can you let me

know?

Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his

picture. Stephen stares at her, unnerved. He finally snaps

out of it and walks out the door.

She watches him go.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - DAY

Sara is cleaning, trying to make a dent in a world-class

mess. She doesn't mind -- a big weight's off her shoulders.

You should call someone. The dean's

office. Or at least your R.A.

She keeps cleaning.

And tell them what? What has she

really done to me? No one can do

anything.

It's the weirdest thing, Stephen.

The girl's own parents are afraid

of her.

101.

Well, she sure scared the shit out

of me.

Sara really wants to change the subject. She holds up two of

his t-shirts.

Are these dirty or clean?

Stephen sniffs the shirts.

Somewhere in between.

She throws the t-shirts at him.

EXT. CAMPUS QUADS - DAY

Sara heads to class, walking faster than usual. Bumping into

people as she looks around, making sure she'll spot Rebecca

before Rebecca spots her.

She makes it to the front door of the building. She looks

back at the quads.

EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

Sara locks the front door and heads back home.

She walks down an empty quad. She slows at the sight of...

Rebecca. Walking directly towards her from the other end of

the quad.

No one else is in sight. Sara thinks about veering off to the

side. No. She can do this. She walks straight ahead. Rebecca

keeps her pace; hooded sweater up, looking down at the

pavement, listening to her Walkman.

Sara takes a deep breath as they get closer to each other,

preparing herself for the confrontation. Ten feet away now.

Five...

But Rebecca passes her without looking. Sara walks a little

further and turns around.

Rebecca keeps walking. Did she even see her?

102.

EXT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

Sara hurries up the stairs to the fraternity house.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Sara reaches Psi U. and closes the door behind her. She looks

around at the messy first floor. At the PACK OF GUYS in the

living room, yelling at the hoops game on TV.

Sara smiles. She's safe.

INT. ART STUDIO - NIGHT

Rebecca is alone, with just a crack of light coming from the

open door to the hallway. She's sketching, still wearing her

Walkman. Hundreds of sheets of paper are scattered around the

floor, but we can't see what she's drawing.

INT. FRAT HOUSE ROOM

Sara is trying to study at a cramped desk but the music from

outside the room is too loud. Stephen is on the bed,

reading. He's used to it. She hears a loud commotion from

the hallway. Frustrated, she gets up.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY

It's a couple of guys playing nerf basketball.

Seriously. Is it a game to be as

loud as you possibly can?

She waves her arms like a crazy person.

How many walls can you possibly

bump into!?

They just return blank stares. She slams the door shut.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - NIGHT

Sara tries to study while the fraternity brothers continue to

shout down the hall. Stephen eyes her warily. Her cellphone

rings. She pulls it out of the purse: Jason.

103.

She hesitates... and now stuffs the phone back in her bag as

she gets up from the table.

Hey, I'm going to hit the library.

I can walk you there.

No, it's okay.

Party starts at ten. Really cool

band...

I hear the drummer's really hot.

He may be, but I'm sleeping with

his girlfriend...

She kisses him.

EXT. DORM - EVENING - NIGHT

JASON, a handsome all-American Midwestern kid, stands in

front of Sara's dorm. He's talking into his cell phone.

Sara. I'm actually... I'm in front

of your dorm. I just flew in. I'm

at the Roosevelt Hotel, room 210.

Call me, okay?

He hangs up. Some students leave the dorm and he grabs the

door before it closes.

INT. DORM ROOM - DUSK

Rebecca kneels down in front of her dresser. Opens the bottom

drawer. Her sweaters. She fishes underneath them. Pulls out

her lithium pills. But just looks at them. Anger in her eyes.

She puts the bottle back.

104.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jason walks through the hallway, checking the numbers on the

doors. He stops in front of Sara's room. Knocks lightly on

the door. No answer. Knocks again.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca sits back into Sara's chair, staring at the door,

ignoring the knocks. Almost catatonic.

Her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest,

shredding it to pieces.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jason writes a note. He folds it and slides it under the

door. He hesitates for a second, hoping this is the right

thing to do, then walks back down the hallway towards the

elevator.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca stares at the note for a moment. She walks to the

door, picks it up and begins to read Jason's note.

I know you won't take my calls, but I'm here and I just want

to see you. I'm at The Roosevelt Hotel, Room 210, until...

however long it takes. Please.

Love,

Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash.

INT. DORM - SHOWER - NIGHT

Rebecca lets the water soak her. Eyes open. She runs her

fingers through her now long dark brown hair. Black water

trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain.

105.

INT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca stands naked in front of the mirror, staring at her

reflection. She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long

pair of shears. Her "Emily" tattoo is starting to heal. She

gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears,

still looking at it in the mirror.

She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter.

Just above her shoulders.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca walks over to Sara's closet. She opens it and thumbs

through some of the clothes that Sara left behind. She pulls

out a dress. Holds it in front of herself as she stands in

front of the mirror. Nice -- but something's missing.

Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain.

Which she caresses in her hand.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Sara's kicked her feet on the table, reading a book.

Enjoying the silence.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

A raucous party in full swing. Stephen's band has just

finished playing and he's walking off the cheap stage. A HOT

GIRL smiles at him.

Help me find the keg?

Sure, I have to go look for my

girlfriend anyway.

She walks away. "Jerk". He grins... and now checks his watch.

Where's Sara?

INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

The elevator door opens, revealing Rebecca. Or is it Sara?

The hair. The dress. The tattoo. Rebecca looks just like her.

106.

As she steps into the hallway, she gently fingers the

necklace. She walks along, looking at the room numbers.

She stops in front of a room. She's about to knock... but she

sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down, in front of an

open room.

She walks to the cart. She peeks inside the room... and now

plucks the master key card off the cart.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Jason, shirtless, sleeps on his stomach in bed.

The front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for

a silhouette of a woman to appear. She closes the door. Jason

barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep.

Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight. She stares

down at Jason. She slips off her dress, which falls to the

floor. She's in just bra and panties now.

She climbs onto the bed beside Jason. He starts awake.

Shhhh.

She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts

kissing the back of his neck.

Sara?

You got my voicemail.

Mm-hmmm.

Kissing his back now, moving lower.

Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good.

She works her way back up to his ear.

Turn over.

107.

Did that sound like Sara? But as Jason turns over, he sees...

The hair. The necklace. That unmistakable "Emily" tattoo.

Close your eyes.

He does. She reaches beneath the blanket, and does what she

needs to. She settles onto him. And now starts to move.

And as she moves we go behind her and see, shining in the low

light, the utility knife beneath her bra strap. Flat against

the skin of her back.

Jason lies still, eyes clenched shut.

I love you, Sara.

She lets him have one, two, three seconds of heaven. Her

hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife.

But she doesn't love you.

Jason's eyes fly open. That wasn't Sara's voice. And those

aren't Sara's eyes boring into his.

Rebecca leans down, her face to his. Jason's eyes widen in

shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the

knife deep into his gut. He gasps.

You hurt her.

She kisses him -- the last thing he'll ever feel. He

shudders, trembles, and lies still, eyes open.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Sara's still reading. A hand touches her shoulder. She jumps,

but it's just the LIBRARIAN.

We're about to close.

Sara can't believe it's so late. She puts her things away.

Grabs her phone to check the time, distracted by the "1 new

voicemail" message. She's about to press the voicemail

button...

But a text comes in from Irene:

108.

"Im back. Get your butt over here, I've got another surprise

for you."

INT. FRATHOUSE - NIGHT

Stephen walks around, beer-less, searching the crowd for

Sara. He checks his watch. Pats his pocket -- no cell phone.

He heads up the stairs and into his room.

INT. FRAT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stephen picks his phone off the dresser. Sees he has a new

voicemail from Sara. He plays the message

SARA (V.0.)

Hi Stephen, it's me. I'm stopping

by Irene's, come on by. I want you

Grand, Apt. 708. Love you.

He groans. A sharp knock, and the bedroom door opens.

All hands on deck -- the keg's

still alive.

EXT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sara comes fast-paced down the sidewalk. She enters Irene's

building.

INT. IRENE'S ELEVATOR

Sara rides up the elevator.

INT. HALLWAY / DOORWAY

Sara walks to the door of Irene's apartment. It's open but

there's not a sound. No music, no cocktail chatter.

She checks the apartment number again. It's the right one.

She knocks lightly. No answer.

Irene?

INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sara steps into the foyer.

109.

She walks down the long entryway into a newly-renovated

living room. Dark and empty. Sara's starting to feel uneasy.

Irene?

There's a bedroom dead ahead. Warm light pours out. She

slowly walks to the open door... looks in... and freezes.

CLOSE ON SARA'S EYES. Horror-stricken by what she sees.

The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above...

Irene. She lies on the bed, each of her wrists cuffed to a

bedpost. A red Hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth.

Sara can't move. She stares at Irene in shock.

Irene.

Irene mumbles, her eyes wide open in terror. As Sara starts

toward Irene...

REBECCA (O.S.)

Some role model she turned out to

be. Couldn't even take care of

herself.

Rebecca steps out of the darkness, a gun in her hand. Sara

drops her phone on the floor.

Rebecca!

Rebecca holds the gun steady on Sara.

Sit down and shut up.

Sara lowers herself into a black chair, her eyes on Irene.

Rebecca picks up Sara's cell phone.

Listen to me. All I ever wanted

was to be your friend.

A beat. Sara knows she has to play this just right.

Rebecca, you are my friend.

110.

No. Shut up. We're not friends.

We're here because you betrayed me.

Rebecca, I'm sorry--

Stop it. Stop saying things you

don't mean. I protected you.

From that whore Tracy and that

nasty little kitten... and That

scumbag of a professor...

Even that loser ex-boyfriend of

yours.

What're you talking about? What'd

you do to them? What'd you do to

Jason?

I got rid of them all. And how do

you repay me? By leaving me.

Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment.

She looks at Irene.

Sara digs deep... lifts up her face... and looks Rebecca in

the eye. She puts everything she has into this.

Rebecca, please forgive me.

A long beat. Rebecca's face lights up.

Now we can start all over again.

Let's make things the way they

were, Sara. That first day. Just

the two of us.

Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands.

Rebecca...

After all... you can only have one

best friend.

No! Don't!

Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head. Irene starts to

buck and thrash. But it doesn't help her...

Lay still bitch.

Please. Don't do this...

Sara stands. She stares at Irene. She can't watch her die.

She walks toward the bed, ignoring Rebecca's gun.

Stop! I mean it.

Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming.

Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara. She cracks Sara across

the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor.

She kneels down beside Sara. Worried... clearing the hair

from Sara's face.

Shh... I'm so sorry.

Sara backhands her, knocking the gun out of her hand. It

skitters across the floor and out the door into the living

room.

Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs

Sara by the neck and rips her off the bed. She puts her in a

chokehold.

Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the

chokehold. She slams her back against the wall. And again.

Sara smashes her elbow into Rebecca's jaw, breaking her grip.

She heads for the door, but Rebecca trips her. As Sara

rises...

Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of

her. As Sara gasps for breath...

Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun.

Sara gets up quickly and slams the door shut and locks it.

Rebecca turns around and goes for the door.

112.

Sara goes to the bed and rips open the garbage bag on Irene's

head.

IRENE'S EYES POP OPEN. Huge relief in Sara's face. But...

Rebecca bangs the door.

REBECCA (O.S.)

Don't do this Sara!

INT. BEDROOM

Sara takes the scarf out of Irene's mouth and pulls against

the steel handcuffs. Useless.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca wipes blood off her lip and leans up to the door.

Don't make me hurt you, Sara. I

just want to be your friend.

INT. BEDROOM

Sara and Irene are frantic.

My phone. My phone.

She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table.

She rushes for it. No good the wire is cut!

Shit!

The window! There's a fire escape.

You can reach it.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Rebecca looks around for the gun. Throwing chairs and

furniture around. She finds it.

Picks the gun off the floor.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sara races to the window and throws it open. There's just an

empty street below. She eyes the fire escape. A nearly

impossible leap away. But Sara's out of options.

113.

EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT

Sara takes a tentative step out onto the slim ledge. Her foot

hits a flowerpot, which plummets ten stories... and smashes

to pieces in the alley. Sara shuts her eyes.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca, back at the bedroom door, raises the gun and fires.

BLAM!

INT. BEDROOM

The door shatters, and the bullet continues straight ahead

and tears a pillow open, just beside Irene's head. Feathers

go flying. Irene screams.

Rebecca kicks the door open and steps in, gun in hand.

I know you're scared, Sara. But I

promise, everything is gonna be

okay.

She stops short at the sight of...Sara on the ledge.

Rebecca turns and stares at Irene. Fresh panic rising in

Irene's eyes.

Sorry, Irene. But she's my friend,

not yours.

She raises the gun at the helpless Irene...

But out of nowhere STEPHEN, RUSHING UP FROM BEHIND, knocks

her arm. The gun fires wildly, one bullet...

EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT

Exploding through the window, shattering it and startling

Sara, who loses her balance and slips off the ledge. She

grabs on by her fingertips, her face hitting the brick wall.

Ohgodohgodohgod.

The more she screams, the more she loses her grip.

114.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca fires another shot, hitting a giant bedroom mirror,

shattering it's reflection of Rebecca's struggle with

Stephen.

Rebecca slams her head into his lip, knocking him backward.

He keeps hold of her, and they hit the floor, the gun flying

out of Rebecca's hand.

Stephen gets on top. He lifts his arm high and balls his fist

before he puts it right in her face full throttle, knocking

her out cold.

He quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he

races for the window.

SARA (O.S.)

Stephen! Help!

Hurry!!

He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her.

EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - SAME

Sara's crying, barely mouthing Stephen's name. He grabs her

arms. Leaning halfway outside, he starts to pull her up.

Part of the way up, he holds her against his chest and lets

her cry. He smiles.

Okay I've got you. Everything is

gonna be okay!

He pulls her halfway in the window...

But a shadow rises behind him.

STEPHEN!!!!

A loud unpleasant sound. THUD! Irene screams.

Then Stephen stiffens, his body straightening in shock.

Something's wrong. And now Sara stares in horror as...

Blood runs down his face. He looks into Sara's eyes... and

lets go of her.

115.

She falls, but manages to hook onto the ledge as Stephen

disappears from the window frame. Using the brick wall for

leverage, she arduously lifts herself up into the window in

time to see...

Stephen, glassy-eyed, backing away from the window. He slumps

to the floor, revealing:

Rebecca. She's a crazed mess, hair and eyes wild.

Rebecca drops the bloody fireplace poker and rushes to the

window. She helps Sara in. They tumble onto the floor.

Sara tosses Rebecca to the side and rushes over to Stephen.

Stephen.

Stephen is out. She sees the gun in his belt. She pulls it

out, spins, and levels it at Rebecca. The gun shakes

violently in her hand.

Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on

the floor.

You won't do it. We're fr--

Sara pulls the trigger. Click. Rebecca stares in shock.

Click. Click. Click. Click. Sara closes her eyes in

frustration. She drops the gun.

Tears stream down Rebecca's face. She can't believe Sara

pulled that trigger. But as if flipping a switch...

Rebecca's sadness turns to rage. She balls her fists, her

knuckles white, and...

CHARGES at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall.

She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room, where...

Sara's head slams the nightstand, knocking the contents of

Rebecca's purse everywhere.

Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes. It hurts her to hurt

Sara.

Friends help each other. They take

care of each other.

Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca.

116.

Rebecca. We were never friends.

That's the last straw. Rebecca comes hard, murder in her

eyes. She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from

the floor, and slams her against the wall.

She starts choking the life out of her. Sara's face turns

red. Redder...

But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock.

Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand. The

utility knife is in her other hand... stuck between Rebecca's

shoulder blades.

Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her. She

won't let go of Sara. As she gasps for air, she sees...

Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt. Sara self-

consciously notices her looking at it. Rebecca reaches out

and grabs Sara's hand.

Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from

around Rebecca's neck.

Irene is trembling in the bed. Too shocked to say anything.

Sara.

She races over to him. He's barely alive.

Stephen. Hold on.

She finds her phone on the floor. She steps back to Stephen

and cradles his head in her lap as she dials 911.

He looks into her eyes and smiles.

She smiles through her tears, love in her eyes.

EXT. BUILDING - DAY

It's a warm, spring day. Sara, melancholy but looking in

much better shape since the last time we saw her, stands in

front of her dorm, looking to restart her college career.

She plays with the silver chain once again around her neck.

117.

She opens the front door and walks in. Students milling about

look at her. Know who she is. We see Kim and Tracy. They

don't say anything. Don't know what to say.

INT. DORM ROOM

Sara opens the door. The simple room is identical to her

previous one. She hesitates at first but then walks in.

There is a box marked "SARA" filled with the things she left

behind in her old dorm. There's a knock on the open door.

STEPHEN (O.S.)

Welcome back.

Hey. How are you feeling?

Stephen enters the room.

Better now. You being here's gonna

help.

Sara smiles.

How's moving in going?

Just got here.

Well let me give you some time to

get settled in.

Actually, I need you right here,

right now.

Stephen grins. He likes where this is headed.

Okay.

INT. DORM HALLWAY

Sara and Stephen push the twin bed into the hallway.

118.

This isn't exactly what I had in

mind.

Sara grins.

Now I can get settled in.

I'll be back to pick you up for

dinner. You gonna be ready?

Absolutely.

Stephen takes off down the hall. Sara follows him with her

eyes before she goes back into her room.

INT. DORM ROOM

Sara sits down on her bed. She watches the empty space where

the other bed used to be. She just stares at it. The camera

slowly tracks sideways until we see the side of the bookshelf

where unseen by Sara, there's a flyer hung with a picture of

Richard Prince's Nurse of Greenmeadow announcing an upcoming

gallery exhibition.

CUT TO BLACK.
