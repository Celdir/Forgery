Applause. She gestures to Rachel who stands, still looking

at Stephan. The table quietens down. Rachel opens the book

at the marked place and hesitates, only now realising what

she is about to read. Then...

Young Rachel stands in the small kitchen. Rain lashes on

the window. She stares out at some FIREWORKS exploding

nearby, then turns away and begins to gather three METAL

SAUCEPANS from the shelves.

We TRACK with her as she walks into the...

And begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the

rainwater which is dripping through various points in the

ceiling.

As she positions the last pot we REVOLVE around her to get

our first view of the far wall. And there, tied to a

radiator, is DIETER VOGEL, now 50. He's bound, his mouth

taped, apparently asleep.

Rachel doesn't, of course, react to this sight. Instead

she begins to clear away some pieces of BROKEN GLASS BOWL

from the floor. We TRACK with her as she walks back down

the short hallway into the kitchen, drops the pieces of

bowl into the bin. From the living room comes the three

distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots.

Vogel hurries along the walkway and sets off DOWN THE

SPIRAL STAIRCASE of the apartment building.

Rachel lies motionless. Then a cough. And another. And

finally she rolls over, holding her gaping cheek with one

hand, and drags herself towards the CHEST OF DRAWERS.

Vogel runs down the spiral staircase.

With difficulty, Rachel pulls out a GUN fitted with a

silencer... and pulls herself towards the door.

Vogel's dwindling figure as he nears the bottom of the

stairs.

Streaming blood from her face, Rachel heaves herself out of

the apartment towards the railings guarding the walkway. We

hear the clatter of Vogel's feet on the stairs below. She

raises the gun to the railings, to take aim....

Bursting from the stairwell, Vogel starts to run across the

courtyard towards the street.

Rachel's aim follows Vogel's lunge for the gateway...

RACHEL'S P.O.V

There is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a

moment we see Vogel lit, about to make it to the gate and

disappear forever...

Rachel FIRES. A single shot. And, improbably, incredibly,

the tiny figure of Vogel drops.

Rachel hangs over the banisters far above us, gun in hand,

staring at us with disbelief.

Rachel finishes reading and puts the book down.

Nobody   moves. The air of bonhomie has been replaced by an

uneasy   silence. Not knowing what else to do, one of the

guests   begins to clap and the others hurriedly join in.

Rachel   doesn't acknowledge the applause.

Stephan is staring at her with a STRANGE INTENSITY.

Stephan and Rachel sit in the back of the car. Behind a

screen the young Mossad Agent we saw earlier sits in the

front next to the Driver. Tel Aviv races by in neon smears.

The air is charged with tension.

Stephan ignores her. She turns to the window, watches as

they streak past another car.

Rachel turns to him, startled.

Something about his intensity unnerves her.

Stephan is still staring at her, reading her.

And then he can't keep it from his face - and she knows.

Something terrible has happened.

Stephan sits in the middle of the squalid living room, lost

in thought.

Rachel walks slowly though the room, taking it all in - the

little islands of occupation, the places where David sat,

read, slept. Piles of newspapers. Used cups. A mound of

laundry...

ON Rachel as she looks about her, looking for something,

some sign from the man she knew. But there's nothing

personal here. These are the rooms of a man who had no real

home.

Rachel walks in and switches on the light. She stares

around the dirty bathroom.

...turning to face us, the beautiful smile...

...as she begins to cry.

Stephan sits listening to her breaking down.

Rachel sits on the couch.

Stephan looks at her, considering.

He takes out a sheet of PRINTED PAPER, hands it to her. She

reads some of the first page, then looks up at him.

And now we see it on her face too. Fear.

The Mossad Agent sits on the stairs, smoking.

As the door behind him opens he stands aside and watches

Rachel SWEEP past him down the stairs, without giving him a

glance.

Rachel is packing, folding clothes neatly, precisely,

silently - all the time a terrible tension in her

movements.

She tries to close a drawer but it sticks, She keeps

trying, then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free

and hurls it across the room.

She stands breathing hard.

The next day. Tables under umbrellas are ranged along the

terrace.

Sarah and her husband are on the beach below, playing with

their son, laughing. As if feeling our gaze, she looks up

at us, shielding her eyes against the sun.

REVERSE

Rachel sits at a table with Stephan, watching her daughter.

Stephan takes out an ENVELOPE and passes it to her.

She opens it and examines the contents - an AIR-PLANE

TICKET and TWO PASSPORTS.

Stephan takes out a small BLACK CASE and slides it across

the table towards her.

She turns to look at it with disgust, KNOWING WHAT IT IS.

Then she takes it and puts it in her handbag.

Rachel turns back to stare at her daughter.

Sarah, playing with her son, glances up once more at her

mother on the patio.

Rachel stands, an elegant woman at breakfast, her dark

glasses, her suit...She raises a hand and waves.

Puzzled, Sarah waves back, then watches as her mother

begins to walk away from her.

PULLING RACHEL

...as she walks from the bright light of the patio into the

relative darkness of the hotel lobby, suitcase in hand,

face set, steely.

We TRACK with her as she emerges from the shadow of the

hotel back into the bright sunshine of the street and

starts to walk along the sidewalk.

After a moment a CAR purrs alongside. She ignores it for a

moment, keeps on walking, the car cruising beside her.

Finally, almost angrily, she stops and gets in. The YOUNG

AGENT sits in the back seat next to her. The car pulls

smoothly away.

Rachel climbs from the car and walks towards the building,

pulling her wheeled suitcase.

The young agent has climbed out and moves swiftly ahead of

her, waiting as she passes into the departure building.

Rachel looks down at her passport. We see her PHOTOGRAPH

and name - RACHEL SINGER. She hardly reacts as the agent

ushers her to the front of the queue.

An Officer takes her passport, and as he checks it, we

see...

PAST

...the passport again. We're now looking at the black and

white image of YOUNG RACHEL. The name beneath it is ELSA

ROGET.

The passport is slid back across the counter and we find

ourselves in...

Rachel takes her passport back from the BORDER GUARD and

walks forward, past the barrier into EAST GERMANY.

RACHEL'S P.O.V

A CROWD of people are waiting beyond the check-point for

their loved ones. They're all looking eagerly at us. Only

one YOUNG MAN has his back to us, turning away to light a

cigarette.

Then he turns - Young David - a fine, sensitive face,

darkly shadowed eyes. This is the SHOT we saw earlier. A

moment when we see how anxious he is to play his part

right. Then he smiles his beautiful smile...

Supered TITLES read "East Berlin, 1965."

Rachel walks up to him and after a fractional hesitation

they embrace.

HIGH ANGLE

David takes her suitcase, and they begin to walk away, hand

in hand, along the BERLIN WALL.

Finally...

Rachel nods, embarrassed.

They have turned into another, quieter street.

David lets go of her hand, and they walk on.

A figure leans over the railing on the crumbling balcony at

the top of the building, smoking a cigarette, watching.

This is YOUNG STEPHAN.

HIGH SHOT - POV

David and Rachel are coming through the iron gate into the

run-down looking courtyard.

A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN - the building's only other occupant -

watches the couple as the pass, David murmuring a greeting.

A brief glimpse of the couple climbing the winding stairs -

a view we have seen before.

The place looks like a squat.

YOUNG Stephan sits playing idly at a battered old upright

piano, a cigarette in his mouth. He looks up as David and

Rachel walk in and stand framed in the doorway, looking

every inch the young married couple. Stephan looks at them

for a beat, then starts to play the first few bars of

Mendelssohn's wedding march.

The other two blush furiously, not amused. Rachel takes her

case from David.

He waits just long enough to enjoy her reaction.

She nods and walks off.

Stephan is smoking. David sits at the table. He is using a

file to create a notch at the bottom of a thin strip of

sprung steel.

Both men can hear the BATH RUNNING in the bathroom, both

very aware of this new female presence in the house they've

been sharing together for the last month.

David frowns at the steel strip, seeming preoccupied.

Stephan watches him, amused.

David shrugs.

He begins to sort his possessions out.

David sighs, blows on the steel strip and holds it up for

Stephan to examine.

We hear the bathroom door open and there is a quick glimpse

of Rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door

heading for her room. The two men watch her pass. Stephan

turns and catches David's expression.

Rachel sits on her bed drying her hair. She stops,

listening to the indistinct murmur of the men's voices from

the room next door. Rachel leans towards the wall, trying

to hear more but the voices fall silent.

David, holding a kitchen knife, MOVES TO STAB Stephan.

Stephan uses a krav magah move to disarm him. The knife

clatters to the floor as he twists David's arm behind his

back.

Stephan is smiling. She realizes he's talking about Mossad.

Stephan looks even more amused.

Rachel feels herself blush a little angrily. Stephan grabs

her from behind and Rachel executes a perfect break,

twisting Stephen's arm. Stephan winces, surprised.

David gives the slightest of smiles.

Rachel lies in bed, restlessly playing with a locket around

her neck.

Giving up on trying to sleep, Rachel rises from the bed,

throws on a robe and pads out of the room...

...and into the living room. She sits down at the table,

stares at a FILE before her. She hesitates then opens it,

forces herself to look at the terrible PHOTOGRAPHS inside -

a pile of severed legs, bodies covered in mustard gas

wounds, phosphorus burns, a naked woman, barely a skeleton,

held up by two Nazi nurses, a row of DEAD BABIES, rulers

laid beside them to indicate dimensions...

Rachel stares at this last image, overwhelmed.

David stands watching her through the half open door. He

makes a small move - perhaps to go to her - then stops

himself and slips back into the darkness.

A tram trundles down the wide Berlin street.

Rachel and David are walking to Vogel's surgery, holding

hands. She's pale, very frightened. David walks, trying,

and failing, to think of anything to say to her.

He suddenly notices an odd sound. It's Rachel, humming

tunelessly to herself, very low. Something about this

pierces him. He gives her hand a squeeze.

The two stand in the doorway, at the foot of the stairs

leading into the clinic, their husband and wife routine.

She nods, trying to smile.

They kiss. She turns to go, looking so young and lost...

David hesitates, staring after her, then walks quickly

away. Rachel walks up the steps towards the entrance.

A large NOTICE BOARD covered with photographs of grateful

smiling MOTHERS holding their NEWBORN BABIES - row upon row

of new life.

Rachel sits staring at the board. She turns her attention

to the frosted glass door to the doctor's surgery.

Indistinct shadows move on the other side.

She turns to look at the other two women sitting looking

through magazines, then back to the door. A shadow darkens

as it approaches the glass, then the door opens and a NURSE

leans out.

(All dialogue at the clinic is in German, subtitled.)

With a smile, the Nurse gestures for Rachel to enter.

Rachel stands behind a SCREEN, trying to control her

nerves. All we can hear is the sound of RUNNING WATER and

Rachel's tense breathing. Finally she takes off her skirt

and unbuttons her blouse with trembling fingers. She puts

on the gown, and slips out of her underpants, stumbling as

she steps out of them.

We TRACK with her as she walks out from behind the screen

into the large brightly lit room. She walks towards the

GYNAECOLOGICAL CHAIR at the centre of the room. On the far

wall, behind a screen, someone stands washing their hands

at a basin.

As she walks, Rachel passes a tray of MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS,

her glance lingering on it.

She reaches the chair and climbs onto it. A pause and then,

tentatively, she lifts her feet into the stirrups, tugging

the gown to cover herself as best she can.

She tries to steady her breathing, focussing on the

ceiling. A bright LIGHT shines down on her.

We hear footsteps approach.

Rachel closes her eyes.

Rachel opens her eyes. Vogel is sitting on a small stool,

taking a speculum from the tray of instruments, his back to

us.

He turns and smiles at us - and he has a wonderful, warm

smile, the air of a gruff but kindly Uncle.

He looks up at her and Rachel instinctively moves her hand

away from the locket. She finds herself nodding.

Vogel looks away again. Rachel bites down on a wave of

panic.

Rachel stares at the light. Beat.

He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile.

Rachel winces.

Rachel nods. He pats her hand.

Rachel walks out and finds David waiting, smoking. He takes

her hand and they walk off without speaking.

The two turn the corner, out of sight of the clinic. David

glances at her. She looks pale, shaken. He feels a wave of

sudden tenderness for her, opens his mouth to say something

then catches himself.

CLOSE on their hands. After a moment David LETS GO. They

walk on.

Stephan sits at a table. Rachel and David appear beside him

and join him. There is an awkward silence for a moment.

Stephan sips his coffee.

She looks at David but he is staring at the table. Like

Stephan he is uncomfortable with the thought of what Rachel

has been through.

She takes his hand. He looks up, surprised, searches her

face...

But then Rachel lets go and walks off towards the toilets.

David looks down at the SILVER LOCKET lying in his palm.

Stephan walks down the street. A SMARTLY DRESSED MAN walks

towards him, absently jingling his CAR KEYS in his hand.

As he nears Stephan, the man fumbles the keys and they

drop. Stephan dips down to pick them up and hands them back

to the man with a smile.

The two continue on their way, and we follow the smartly

dressed man, closing in on his hand, in which he now holds

his keys AND THE LOCKET.

We see him tuck it into his jacket pocket as he walks on.

The FOOTBRIDGE which crosses over a closed RAILWAY STATION

below. On either side of the bridge runs a barbed wire

topped FENCE. A few PEDESTRIANS cross the bridge in the

early evening gloom, intent on getting home.

David and Stephan appear, walking over the bridge towards

us. David's eyes flick to the tracks ahead and below as a

TRAIN begins to thunder by.

Stephan begins to COUNT softly to himself as the train runs

below his feet.

A hand-drawn plan of a RAILWAY STATION is on the table.

David indicates the tracks on the plan.

He raises a lighter to the cigarette in his mouth.

As the train disappears into the gloom and Stephan slows to

light his cigarette. Beside him David's eyes flick to the

STATION PLATFORM in between the tracks below, eerily lit in

the gathering dusk.

DAVID'S P.O.V - several BORDER GUARDS patrol the abandoned

platform.

We're TRACKING PAST the entrance to stairs leading down

from the bridge onto the platform below. We see it's been

sealed off with a locked gate. Another BORDER GUARD stands

on the stairs below, staring up at us as we pass...

AT KITCHEN TABLE

David indicates the point on the plan.

The two men have walked on past the mid-point of the

bridge. David glances at the far track.

DAVID'S P.O.V - the track runs along the far side of the

platform. On the other side of the track is a barbed-wire

topped WIRE FENCE.

Stephan indicates a point on the track.

The two men are at the top of the stairs on the other side

of the bridge now. Stephan glances to his right...

STEPHEN'S P.O.V - TRACKING as we descend the stairs. We can

see that on the other side of that high wire fence is a CAR

PARK and a long, low building...

We see that car park is lined with the yellow VANS of

Deutsche Post. Several FEMALE POSTAL WORKERS in dark skirts

and white blouses stand around the car park on their

breaks, smoking and chatting. As we watch one of the vans

trundles out of the OPEN FACTORY GATE.

David rolls up the plan.

Stephan stubs out his cigarette.

Rachel realises both men are looking at her.

Rachel runs the hem of a partially-made WHITE GARMENT

through a SEWING MACHINE. She finishes and takes it over to

where Stephan stands waiting. It's unfinished, but a fairly

good approximation of a MEDIC'S WHITE COAT.

Stephan puts it on. She tugs at the coat, straightens the

unfinished collar, runs her hands down the front to smooth

it out.

Rachel ignores this, begins to pin the cuff of one of the

sleeves.

Rachel resists a smile, brandishes the pin.

He holds up his hands in surrender.

Rachel and Stephan sit as David serves the dinner. Rachel

examines her dish.

Stephan tastes his.

David lifts his spoon, blows on it.

They laugh a little, settle into eating.

David stares at his bowl, deciding whether or not to say

something. Finally...

They look up at him in surprise.

Tinny music plays.

The place is almost empty. In the back of the bar the three

sit in a corner drinking beer - just young people,

laughing, a little drunk. They could be students.

Rachel is reciting something from memory.

They laugh.

Rachel thinks about it, shrugs.

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   36.

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   37.

Another stroke and then he stops again, stares at the comb

in his hand.

Rachel turns round and stares at him, overcome with

longing. She leans in to KISS HIM. For a moment David

hesitates, but then it's as if something inside him closes

and he pulls back from Rachel, his face cold.

Without a word he gets up and walks out. Rachel sits,

crushed...

Rachel, sits at the piano in her robe, picking out notes.

She's been crying. Stephan stands watching her from the

doorway, holding a drink - something slightly predatory

about him.

He crosses to her, sits down beside her and starts to match

her notes. They work out a nonsense tune between them.

David listens as they play.

Rachel picks up Stephen's drink and takes a sip.

Defiantly Rachel drains the glass, grimaces a little.

Stephan watches her. He continues to play, moving the

melody up in octaves until his hand is beside hers, then

covering hers. Rachel brushes him away. He puts his hand

back and starts to caress her wrist.

He begins to kiss her neck. Rachel stares ahead, pretending

it isn't happening. Then she gives in, turning to him.

Rachel stands at the mirror, dressing in a DARK SKIRT and

WHITE BLOUSE, trying to control all the emotions she is

feeling.

Behind her Stephan lies in the bed watching her. Neither

speaks.

Rachel and David cross the courtyard to the gate. David

holds it open for Rachel.

As they turn into the street, David takes her hand. Both

stare fixedly ahead, only too aware of what happened the

night before.

Rachel is in the chair for what she knows will - whatever

happens - be the last time.

Vogel begins the exam. From beneath her GOWN Rachel slips a

HYPODERMIC NEEDLE.

He turns to his tray of implements.

Rachel reacts to this revelation.

Stephan kneels in a recess of the building, by the open

NETWORK JUNCTION BOX of the clinic. He's wearing

HEADPHONES, alligator-clipped to two cables in the box.

Stephan un-clips the phones and pockets them. He

straightens up, closes the junction box and walks calmly

away, through a gate in the wall, into the next courtyard.

HIGH SHOT

As Stephan races up some steps, along a balcony, and into

the building...

TRACKING

with Stephan through the hallway, out of the door and onto

the street....

An AMBULANCE, sirens wailing, starts out of the dispatch,

and swings onto the street.

Stephan rounds the corner of the street and walks TOWARDS

THE CLINIC. He checks his watch as he turns into an alley

opposite the entrance.

Rachel finishing dressing, looks anxiously at the nurse as

she crouches by her unconscious husband, monitoring his

breathing.

The AMBULANCE speeds on.

Stephan pulls back some rusty doors.

Parked in the small courtyard beyond is the van we saw

before, now decorated with AMBULANCE DECALS and LIGHTS.

David drives the car forward as Stephan climbs into the

passenger side...

Rachel paces outside the door, looking down the corridor.

The nurse wipes away a tear, tense and frightened.

A SIREN approaches and Rachel moves to the door...

The nurse nods gratefully.
