MEMENTO - Shooting Script

FADE IN:

1    INT. DERELICT HOUSE - DAY >	1

A POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH, clasped between finger and thumb: a

crude, crime scene flash picture of a MAN'S BODY lying on a

decaying wooden floor, a BLOODY MESS where his head should

be.

The image in the photo starts to FADE as we SUPER TITLES. The

hand holding the photo suddenly FANS it in a rapid FLAPPING

motion, then holds it still. The image fades more, and again

the picture is FANNED.

As TITLES END the image fades to nothing. The hand holding

the photo FLAPS it again, then places it at the front of a

POLAROID CAMERA.

The camera SUCKS the blank picture up, then the FLASH BURSTS.

The Polaroid camera is lowered, revealing the sweaty, heavy-

breathing face of LEONARD (mid-30's). There are droplets of

blood across his face. Leonard stares, satisfied, at

something on the ground in front of him. There is WET BLOOD

on his BLUE SHIRT and BEIGE SUIT. His hand opens and catches

a HANDGUN which leaps up into his grasp.

Still staring, he crouches down and pulls a BODY off the

floor by the wet hair of its BLOODY HEAD. He slowly inserts

the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth

should be.

Leonard FLINCHES. A DEAFENING ROAR as wet red leaps off his

face and suit and head, with a SPASM, reassembles itself

into the face of TEDDY (40's, moustache) and we-

Close on Leonard's eyes. He rolls them to one side, then

turns his head.

Leonard lifts his head. He is lying on a queen-sized bed.

3    EXT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY >		   3

A late model Jaguar bumps across some railroad tracks and

approaches a large, clearly abandoned DERELICT BUILDING.

Leonard is driving. He wears a BEIGE SUIT and BLUE SHIRT (no

blood). Next to him is TEDDY. Leonard stops the car next to a

PICKUP TRUCK sitting Outside the derelict building. Leonard

kills the engine, staring at the pickup.

Teddy looks from Leonard to the pickup and back.

Leonard gets out of the Jaguar and moves to the pickup. He

inspects it with a methodical, practiced eye. Teddy follows.

Leonard opens the door of the pickup and searches the

interior. On the dirty vinyl of the passenger seat he finds	*

six BULLETS. Leonard picks two of them up and studies them.	*

He drops them onto the dashboard then SHUTS the door.		*

Leonard walks towards the house, patting his jacket pockets.

Teddy leans on the pickup, uneasy, watching Leonard.

4    INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY >			4

Leonard stands in the dimly-lit, decaying former hallway. He

pulls a stack of POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS out of his pocket and

leafs through them as Teddy starts walking towards him.

Leonard finds a photo showing Teddy with a shit-eating grin

standing in front of the pickup truck. On the broad white

strip beneath the photo is handwritten:

"TEDDY GAMMELL TEL. 555 0134"

Leonard flips the photo over. On the white strip on the back,

in the same small handwriting.

"DON'T LISTEN TO HIS LIES"

"HE IS THE ONE"

"KILL HIM"

Leonard stuffs the Polaroids back into his pocket, reaches

around to the back of his waistband and draws a HANDGUN,

keeping it out of Teddy's line of sight. Teddy enters, wary.

Leonard neither replies nor turns around. Teddy, worried,

affects a casual air, shrugging dismissively,

Teddy turns and heads for the door. Leonard LEAPS on him,

pistol-whipping him furiously as he shouts:

Teddy is down. Leonard DRAGS him back, deeper into the dark

house. Leonard is in a frenzy. He dumps Teddy at the end of

the hall and stands over him. Teddy SPITS BLOOD.

Leonard crouches down and grabs Teddy by the lapels.

Teddy gestures towards the basement door, in pain, but

enjoying Leonard's growing anxiety.

Leonard glances fearfully at the door, then looks at Teddy.

He THRUSTS the barrel of his gun into Teddy's mouth and WE

ARE AT THE SHOT FROM THE END OF THE OPENING SEQUENCE. Teddy

panics, shaking his head, trying to talk around the metal,

but GAGS just as Leonard pulls the trigger. A SHOT rings out

as we -

Leonard lies on the queen-sized bed. He lifts his head.

He gets up, surveys the room as if for the first time. He

wears BOXERS and a PLAID WORK SHIRT.

There is a room key on the dresser. The plastic tag

identifies it as the key to ROOM 21. Leonard opens drawers in

the room.

He reaches for the bedside table drawer.

He opens the drawer to find a Gideon Bible.

6    INT. DISCOUNT INN OFFICE - DAY >		 6

E.C.U. of fingers rifling bills in a wallet. Leonard counts

out some money and hands it to the fat, sweaty middle-aged

man behind the counter. (BURT). Burt takes the money,

spotting something over Leonard's shoulder.

Burt TAPS the POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of Teddy which is sitting

on the counter. Leonard picks up the photo and turns to see

Teddy APPROACHING the glass door of the office. Leonard

watches carefully as Teddy shambles up to the office door. A

BELL CHIIIES as Teddy enters and breaks into his shit-eating

grin. Leonard slips the photo into his pocket.

Leonard nods in apparent recognition, wary.

Teddy pretends to think hard.

Teddy grins and holds the door open for Leonard.

Teddy smiles and heads for the BRAND-NEW JAGUAR parked

several cars further down.

8    INT. CAR - DAY >					  8

Leonard drives, Teddy admires the new car' s interior,

reaching down around the seats, exploring the car with his

hands.

Leonard hits his window button. A few fragments of safety

glass rise out of the door, remnants of a broken window.

Teddy looks, curious.

Leonard shrugs.

Leonard, wearing BOXERS and PLAID WORK SHIRT, takes the

GIDEON BIBLE out off the open bedside table drawer.

He leafs through a couple off pages, then DROPS the Bible back

into the drawer and shuts it. He notices a MESSAGE written on

the back off his hand:

"REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS"

Leonard licks his thumb, and rubs at the writing. To

Leonard's surprise, IT DOES NOT EVEN SMUDGE.

He notices his bare legs. There is a NOTE taped to his RIGHT

THIGH with a handwritten message:

Leonard enters, sees a WHITE PAPER BAG on the counter by the

sink. On the bag is a handwritten message:

"SHAVE THIGH"

Leonard looks into the bag, then pulls out a can of SHAVING

FOAM, and a pack of DISPOSABLE RAZORS. He runs the hot water,

steps back and lifts his foot onto the sink. He is awkward

and uncomfortable. He notices an ICE BUCKET by the sink.

16   INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE##	   16

Leonard sits on the bed applying SHAVING FOAM to his thigh.

The ICE BUCKET sits on the bedside table, steaming.

phone, then reaches for the receiver.

17   INT. A RESTAURANT RESTROOM - DAY >	    17

Leonard, in BEIGE SUIT and BLUE SHIRT flushes the urinal,

then moves to the sink and starts washing his hands. He

notices a MESSAGE written on the back of his hand.

"REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS"

He stares at the message for a second, thoughtful, then tries

to scrub the writing off his skin. To his surprise, it is

INDELIBLE. Leonard looks at it, quizzical, then notices some

markings on his wrist, pulling his sleeve back to get a

better look. He can read the start of a message:

"THE FACTS:"

Leonard is about to roll his sleeve up further when the

restroom door opens and a MAN enters. Leonard dries his

hands, then exits the rest room.

18   INT. RESTAURANT - DAY >				18

Leonard emerges .nto the waiting area of a crowded

restaurant. He glances around, lost, then pulls out his

Polaroids, flipping through them. Someone taps him on his

shoulder and he turns to see the smiling face of a waiter.

Leonard looks down. The waiter hands him a BROWN ENVELOPE and

a MOTEL ROOM KEY (DISCOUNT INN, ROOM 304). On the envelope is

a handwritten message:

"FOR LEONARD, FROM NATALIE"

Leonard looks at his Polaroid photograph of the outside of

the Discount Inn motel. There is an address written beneath

it (7254 Lincoln Street).							    *

The Waiter glances at his Polaroid.

Leonard, BROWN ENVELOPE in hand, finds the door to room 304.

21   INT. DISCOUNT INN ROOM 304 - DAY >	    21 *

Leonard enters, looks around as if for the first time. An

anonymous motel room, except that tacked to one wall is a

HAND-DRAWN CHART showing the layout of some streets, and

stuck to the edges of the chart are POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS,

with ARROWS DRAWN from each photograph to a spot on the map.

Leonard inspects the photos. Some are buildings, some are

people. All have the HANDWRITTEN NOTES on the broad white strip

underneath the image.

Leonard gets Polaroids out of his pocket. The first one is of

the Discount Inn. He STICKS it onto an already-squashed lump    *

of blue tack at the end of an ARROW drawn from a location on

the outskirts of town.

The second photo is a blurred shot of a Brunette turning in a

doorway. The name NATALIE is written under the picture.

Leonard flips it over. On the back are two handwritten

messages. The first one has been completely scribbled over,

but the other one reads:

"SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY"

Leonard nods, then sticks the photo to the chart. He steps

back looking over the Polaroids one by one: Natalie, Burt,

Discount Inn, Teddy.							    *

Leonard sits at the desk and opens the BROWN ENVELOPE. He

takes out a photocopy of a CAR REGISTRATION and a DRIVER'S

LICENSE. Both are in the name of JOHN EDWARD GAMMELL, but	  *

when Leonard looks at the picture on the license, he

recognizes the face. Leonard moves back to his wall chart,

finds the Polaroid of Teddy and compares it to the license

photo.

He turns the photo over and examines the white stop on the

back. It says only:

"DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES"

Leonard smiles. He goes to the phone and dials the number on

the Polaroid. A couple of rings, then it's answered.

Leonard hangs up, thinking. He looks at the writing on the

back of his hand, then pulls back his sleeve to reveal the words:

"THE FACTS:"

Leonard removes his jacket, then starts pulling off his shirt.

He has WRITING TATTOOED ALL OVER HIS CHEST, STOMACH AND ARMS.

MESSAGES in different styles of writing, some CRUDE, some

ELABORATE. The messages run in all directions, some UPSIDE-

DOWN, some BACKWARDS. Leonard examines his tattoos,

methodically. From Leonard's POV, the most striking is an

upside-down tattoo on his BELLY which says:

"PHOTOGPAPH: HOUSE, CAR, FRIEND, FOE"

On one FOREARM it says:

"THE FACTS:

FACT 1. MALE

FACT 2. WHITE"

On the other FOREARM:

"FACT 3. FIRST NAME: JOHN OR JAMES

FACT 4. LASTNAME: G-------"

Leonard pulls down his trousers. On his right THIGH, crudely-

lettered:

"FACT 5. DRUG DEALER"

And immediately below this, in elegant, neat lettering:

"FACT 6. CAR LICENSE NUMBER: SG13 7IU"					 *

Leonard takes out the REGISTRATION DOCUMENT and examines it.

Holding the photo of Teddy and the registration document,

Leonard checks off his TATTOOED FACTS:

Leonard looks coldly at Teddy's smiling image.

Leonard turns the photo face down, takes a pen and writes:

"HE IS THE ONE"

Leonard drops the pen. Thinks. He looks at his chest through

the mirror and a backwards tattoo suddenly BECOMES CLEAR:

"JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE"

Leonard buttons his blue shirt, then writes on the back of

Teddy's picture:

"KILL HIM"

Leonard sticks the photo of Teddy BETWEEN HIS TEETH as he

holds his HANDGUN up and checks that it is loaded. He sticks

the GUN in the back of his waistband.

Leonard can see his reflection in the mirror. He studies the

tattoo across his chest:

"JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE".

23   EXT. THE CITY GRILL ON MAIN ST. - DAY >    23

Leonard parks the Jaguar, gets out, stops outside the door to

a restaurant, checking its name against a NOTE, written on a    *

SMALL PAPER BAG FROM A PHARMACY. The note says:			  *

"CITY GRILL, MAIN ST. THURSDAY, 1.OOPM MEET NATALIE FOR INFO"

He sticks the note in his pocket and pulls out his Polaroid

photographs. He flips through them until he finds Natalie's.

Leonard flips the picture over. On the back are two

handwritten messages. The first one has been completely

scribbled over, the second reads:

"SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY"

24   INT. THE CITY GRILL ON MAIN STREET - DAY > 24

Leonard enters, walking slowly down the aisle, looking at all

the customers. He makes eye contact with a WOMAN (brunette,

30's) sitting alone, wearing SUNGLASSES. Her face betrays	  *

nothing. Leonard walks past. She sighs and grabs the back of

his jacket as he passes. Leonard spins around.

Leonard slips into the seat opposite her. Natalie is pretty,

but has bruising around one eye, and a mark on her lip.

Leonard shifts uncomfortably.

Leonard raises his eyebrows, then smiles.

Leonard opens his eyes, naked in bed. He looks around,

confused. With a START, he realizes that someone else is in

the bed: a BRUNETTE with her back to him.

Leonard leans right over her to get a look at her face. It is

NATALIE. The BRUISE on her eye and the MARK on her lip are

worse than before.

She OPENS her eyes and is startled by the sight of Leonard's

hovering face.

Leonard FLOPS down. Natalie wakes up fully and relaxes.

the bureau and opens drawers. Empty. He goes to the closet

and OPENS it.

Inside is a BOUND and GAGGED MAN on the floor, knees against

chest. His mouth is taped up with silver electrical tape,

stained with DRIED BLOOD from his swollen nose. He looks up

at Leonard, blinking in the sudden bright light, TERRIFIED.

first time.

Leonard looks up from the VODKA BOTTLE, sighs, rubs his face,

then stands up. He SNIFFS at his armpit.

He puts the empty bottle on the counter by the sink, then

wearily UNDRESSES.

Leonard, NAKED, looks in the mirror, then RUNS THE SHOWER

then steps under it, shutting the PEBBLED PLASTIC STALL DOOR.

Leonard SHOWERS. He turns the water off, then hears the DOOR

BEING UNLOCKED. Leonard freezes, standing in the SHOWER

STALL, NAKED and DRIPPING. Through the distortion of the

PEBBLED PLASTIC DOOR, Leonard sees a FIGURE enter the

bathroom and start pissing into the toilet. The distorted

Figure turns and approaches the shower stall, becoming

clearer as it gets closer, then YANKS the door open. It is

Dodd (WITHOUT INJURIES). He is SHOCKED to see the naked

Leonard. Leonard BURSTS out of the shower stall, SMASHING

Dodd against the wall.

Dodd STRUGGLES around, grabbing at the SLIPPERY, naked

Leonard. Dodd PUSHES against Leonard, SLASMMING him into the

sink.

Leonard has his arms around Dodd's neck. Leonard SMASHES

Dodd's head sideways into the wall, HARD.

Dodd SLUMPS to the floor. Leonard exhales. Dodd puts a FIST

in Leonard's crotch, then GRABS his neck as he doubles over.

Dodd uses Leonard to pull himself off the floor then PUNCHES

the side of his head and pushes him HARD, Leonard FLAILING

Dodd lies still on the floor, bleeding, his hand still in his

dripping wet, catching his breath.

There is a KNOCK at the door.

The sound of a KEY entering the lock. Leonard LEAPS for the

door and flips the privacy latch.

Leonard listens to the maid withdraw her key. Leonard

SEARCHES Dodd, finding his GUN in his inside pocket. Leonard

examines the weapon, then starts to search the room. Leonard

finds an overnight bag at the bottom of the closet. Inside it

there are some clothes, spare ammunition, a large hunting

knife, and a roll of SILVER ELECTRICAL TAPE.

Leonard WRAPS the electrical tape around Dodd's wrists, then

across his mouth. Leonard finishes taping up Dodd, then sits

him on the edge of the bed. Leonard takes a POLAROID

PHOTOGRAPH of the bloody, taped-up Dodd.

Leonard shoves Dodd into the closet, takes out a NOTE and

consults it, then writes "DODD" on the white strip on the

front of the photograph. He flips the picture over and writes

on the strip on the back, in smaller writing:

"GET RID OF HIM, ASK NATALIE"

Leonard dresses, puts the Polaroid into the inside pocket of

his jacket. He looks again at the note. It says:

"DODD, MOUNTCREST INN ON 5TH STREET, ROOM 6"				*

"PUT HIM ONTO TEDDY OR JUST GET RID OF HIM FOR NATALIE"

Leonard looks down at his NOTE. The room number given is 6.

Leonard looks at the "9" on the door, then down at the

The following is Jonathan Nolan's short story

"Memento Mori", the inspiration for his brother,

Christopher Nolan's, screenplay for the film, MEMENTO:

MEMENTO MORI

by

Jonathan Nolan

What like a bullet can undeceive!"

Your wife always used to say you'd be late for your own funeral.

Remember that? Her little joke because you were such a slob-always

late, always forgetting stuff, even before the incident.

Right about now you're probably wondering if you were late for hers.

You were there, you can be sure of that. That's what the picture's

for-the one tacked to the wall by the door. It's not customary to take

pictures at a funeral, but somebody, your doctors, I guess, knew you

wouldn't remember. They had it blown up nice and big and stuck it

right there, next to the door, so you couldn't help but see it every

time you got up to find out where she was.

The guy in the picture, the one with the flowers? That's you. And what

are you doing? You're reading the headstone, trying to figure out

who's funeral you're at, same as you're reading it now, trying to

figure why someone stuck that picture next to your door. But why

bother reading something that you won't remember?

She's gone, gone for good, and you must be hurting right now, hearing

the news. Believe me, I know how you feel. You're probably a wreck.

But give it five minutes, maybe ten. Maybe you can even go a whole

half hour before you forget.

But you will forget-I guarantee it. A few more minutes and you'll be

heading for the door, looking for her all over again, breaking down

when you find the picture. How many times do you have to hear the news

before some other part of your body, other than that busted brain of

yours, starts to remember?

Never-ending grief, never-ending anger. Useless without direction.

Maybe you can't understand what's happened. Can't say I really

understand, either. Backwards amnesia. That's what the sign says. CRS

disease. Your guess is as good as mine.

Maybe you can't understand what happened to you. But you do remember

what happened to HER, don't you? The doctors don't want to talk about

it. They won't answer my questions. They don't think it's right for a

man in your condition to hear about those things. But you remember

enough, don't you? You remember his face.

This is why I'm writing to you. Futile, maybe. I don't know how many

times you'll have to read this before you listen to me. I don't even

know how long you've been locked up in this room already. Neither do

you. But your advantage in forgetting is that you'll forget to write

yourself off as a lost cause.

Sooner or later you'll want to do something about it. And when you do,

you'll just have to trust me, because I'm the only one who can help

you.

***

EARL OPENS ONE EYE after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles

interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large

enough for him to read from the bed. An alarm clock is ringing

somewhere. He reads the sign, blinks,reads it again, then takes a look

at the room.

It's a white room, overwhelmingly white, from the walls and the

curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread. The alarm

clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white

curtains. At this point Earl probably notices that he is lying on top

of his white comforter. He is already wearing a dressing gown and

slippers.

He lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again. It says,

in crude block capitals, THIS IS YOUR ROOM. THIS IS A ROOM IN A

HOSPITAL. THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE NOW.

Earl rises and takes a look around. The room is large for a

hospital-empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three

directions. Two doors and a window. The view isn't very helpful,

either-a close of trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece

of turf that terminates in a sliver of two-lane blacktop. The trees,

except for the evergreens, are bare-early spring or late fall, one or

the other.

Every inch of the desk is covered with Post-it notes, legal pads,

neatly printed lists, psychological textbooks, framed pictures. On top

of the mess is a half-completed crossword puzzle. The alarm clock is

riding a pile of folded newspapers. Earl slaps the snooze button and

takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing

gown. He pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light. He rifles

the papers on the desk, looks quickly through the drawers. Eventually

he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the

window. Another sign is taped just above the box. It says in loud

yellow letters, CIGARETTE? CHECK FOR LIT ONES FIRST, STUPID.

Earl laughs at the sign, lights his cigarette, and takes a long draw.

Taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf

paper headed YOUR SCHEDULE.

It charts off the hours, every hour, in blocks: 10:00 p.m. to 8:00

a.m. is labeled go BACK TO SLEEP. Earl consults the alarm clock: 8:15.

Given the light outside, it must be morning. He checks his watch:

10:30. He presses the watch to his ear and listens. He gives the watch

a wind or two and sets it to match the alarm clock.

According to the schedule, the entire block from 8:00 to 8:30 has been

labeled BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Earl laughs again and walks over to the

bathroom.

The bathroom window is open. As he flaps his arms to keep warm, he

notices the ashtray on the windowsill. A cigarette is perched on the

ashtray, burning steadily through a long finger of ash. He frowns,

extinguishes the old butt, and replaces it with the new one.

The toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste.

The tap is of the push-button variety-a dose of water with each nudge.

Earl pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth

while he opens the medicine cabinet. The shelves are stocked with

single-serving packages of vitamins, aspirin, antidiuretics. The

mouthwash is also single-serving, about a shot-glass-worth of blue

liquid in a sealed plastic bottle. Only the toothpaste is

regular-sized. Earl spits the paste out of his mouth and replaces it

with the mouthwash. As he lays the toothbrush next to the toothpaste,

he notices a tiny wedge of paper pinched between the glass shelf and

the steel backing of the medicine cabinet. He spits the frothy blue

fluid into the sink and nudges for some more water to rinse it down.

He closes the medicine cabinet and smiles at his reflection in the

mirror.

"Who needs half an hour to brush their teeth?"

The paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the

precision of a sixth-grader's love note. Earl unfolds it and smooths

it against the mirror. It reads-

IF YOU CAN STILL READ THIS, THEN YOU'RE A FUCKING COWARD.

Earl stares blankly at the paper, then reads it again. He turns it

over. On the back it reads-

P.S.: AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS, HIDE IT AGAIN.

Earl reads both sides again, then folds the note back down to its

original size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste.

Maybe then he notices the scar. It begins just beneath the ear, jagged

and thick, and disappears abruptly into his hairline. Earl turns his

head and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scar's

progress. He traces it with a fingertip, then looks back down at the

cigarette burning in the ashtray. A thought seizes him and he spins

out of the bathroom.

He is caught at the door to his room, one hand on the knob. Two

pictures are taped to the wall by the door. Earl's attention is caught

first by the MRI, a shiny black frame for four windows into someone's

skull. In marker, the picture is labeled YOUR BRAIN. Earl stares at

it. Concentric circles in different colors. He can make out the big

orbs of his eyes and, behind these, the twin lobes of his brain.

Smooth wrinkles, circles, semicircles. But right there in the middle

of his head, circled in marker, tunneled in from the back of his neck

like a maggot into an apricot, is something different. Deformed,

broken, but unmistakable. A dark smudge, the shape of a flower, right

there in the middle of his brain.

He bends to look at the other picture. It is a photograph of a man

holding flowers, standing over a fresh grave. The man is bent over,

reading the headstone. For a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors

or the beginnings of a sketch of infinity: the one man bent over,

looking at the smaller man, bent over, reading the headstone. Earl

looks at the picture for a long time. Maybe he begins to cry. Maybe he

just stares silently at the picture. Eventually, he makes his way back

to the bed, flops down, seals his eyes shut, tries to sleep.

The cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom. A circuit in the

alarm clock counts down from ten, and it starts ringing again.

Earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles,

interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large

enough for him to read from the bed.

***

You can't have a normal life anymore. You must know that. How can you

have a girlfriend if you can't remember her name? Can't have kids, not

unless you want them to grow up with a dad who doesn't recognize them.

Sure as hell can't hold down a job. Not too many professions out there

that value forgetfulness. Prostitution, maybe. Politics, of course.

No. Your life is over. You're a dead man.The only thing the doctors

are hoping to do is teach you to be less of a burden to the orderlies.

And they'll probably never let you go home, wherever that would be.

So the question is not "to be or not to be," because you aren't. The

question is whether you want to do something about it. Whether revenge

matters to you.

It does to most people. For a few weeks, they plot, they scheme, they

take measures to get even. But the passage of time is all it takes to

erode that initial impulse. Time is theft, isn't that what they say?

And time eventually convinces most of us that forgiveness is a virtue.

Conveniently, cowardice and forgiveness look identical at a certain

distance. Time steals your nerve.

If time and fear aren't enough to dissuade people from their revenge,

then there's always authority, softly shaking its head and saying, We

understand, but you're the better man for letting it go. For rising

above it. For not sinking to their level. And besides, says authority,

if you try anything stupid, we'll lock you up in a little room.

But they already put you in a little room, didn't they? Only they

don't really lock it or even guard it too carefully because you're a

cripple. A corpse. A vegetable who probably wouldn't remember to eat

or take a shit if someone wasn't there to remind you.

And as for the passage of time, well, that doesn't really apply to you

anymore, does it? Just the same ten minutes, over and over again. So

how can you forgive if you can't remember to forget?

You probably were the type to let it go, weren't you? Before. But

you're not the man you used to be. Not even half. You're a fraction;

you're the ten-minute man.

Of course, weakness is strong. It's the primary impulse. You'd

probably prefer to sit in your little room and cry. Live in your

finite collection of memories, carefully polishing each one. Half a

life set behind glass and pinned to cardboard like a collection of

exotic insects. You'd like to live behind that glass, wouldn't you?

Preserved in aspic.

You'd like to but you can't, can you? You can't because of the last

addition to your collection. The last thing you remember. His face.

His face and your wife, looking to you for help.

And maybe this is where you can retire to when it's over. Your little

collection. They can lock you back up in another little room and you

can live the rest of your life in the past. But only if you've got a

little piece of paper in your hand that says you got him.

You know I'm right. You know there's a lot of work to do. It may seem

impossible, but I'm sure if we all do our part, we'll figure something

out. But you don't have much time. You've only got about ten minutes,

in fact. Then it starts all over again. So do something with the time

you've got.

***

EARL OPENS HIS EYES and blinks into the darkness. The alarm clock is

ringing. It says 3:20, and the moonlight streaming through the window

means it must be  he early morning. Earl fumbles for the lamp, almost

knocking it over in the process. Incandescent light fills the room,

painting the metal furniture yellow, the walls yellow, the bedspread,

too. He lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles

above him, interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling. He

reads the sign two, maybe three times, then blinks at the room around

him.

It is a bare room. Institutional, maybe. There is a desk over by the

window. The desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock. Earl

probably notices, at this point, that he is fully clothed. He even has

his shoes on under the sheets. He extracts himself from the bed and

crosses to the desk. Nothing in the room would suggest that anyone

lived there, or ever had, except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here

and there to the wall. No pictures, no books, nothing. Through the

window, he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass.

Earl slaps the snooze button on the alarm clock and stares a moment at

the two keys taped to the back of his hand. He picks at the tape while

he searches through the empty drawers. In the left pocket of his

jacket, he finds a roll of hundred-dollar bills and a letter sealed in

an envelope. He checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom.

Bits of tape, cigarette butts. Nothing else.

Earl absentmindedly plays with the lump of scar tissue on his neck and

moves back toward the bed. He lies back down and stares up at the

ceiling and the sign taped to it. The sign reads, GET UP, GET OUT

RIGHT NOW. THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU.

Earl closes his eyes.

***

They tried to teach you to make lists in grade school, remember? Back

when your day planner was the back of your hand. And if your

assignments came off in the shower, well, then they didn't get done.

No direction, they said. No discipline. So they tried to get you to

write it all down somewhere more permanent.

Of course, your grade-school teachers would be laughing their pants

wet if they could see you now. Because you've become the exact product

of their organizational lessons. Because you can't even take a piss

without consulting one of your lists.

They were right. Lists are the only way out of this mess.

Here's the truth: People, even regular people, are never just any one

person with one set of attributes. It's not that simple. We're all at

the mercy of the limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through

the brain. Every man is broken into twenty-four-hour fractions, and

then again within those twenty-four hours. It's a daily pantomime, one

man yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks

clamoring for their turn in the spotlight. Every week, every day. The

angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the

sex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist. Every man is a mob,

a chain gang of idiots.

This is the tragedy of life. Because for a few minutes of every day,

every man becomes a genius. Moments of clarity, insight, whatever you

want to call them. The clouds part, the planets get in a neat little

line, and everything becomes obvious. I should quit smoking, maybe, or

here's how I could make a fast million, or such and such is the key to

eternal happiness. That's the miserable truth. For a few moments, the

secrets of the universe are opened to us. Life is a cheap parlor

trick.

But then the genius, the savant, has to hand over the controls to the

next guy down the pike, most likely the guy who just wants to eat

potato chips, and insight and brilliance and salvation are all

entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic.

The only way out of this mess, of course, is to take steps to ensure

that you control the idiots that you become. To take your chain gang,

hand in hand, and lead them. The best way to do this is with a list.

It's like a letter you write to yourself. A master plan, drafted by

the guy who can see the light, made with steps simple enough for the

rest of the idiots to understand. Follow steps one through one

hundred. Repeat as necessary.

Your problem is a little more acute, maybe, but fundamentally the same

thing.

It's like that computer thing, the Chinese room. You remember that?

One guy sits in a little room, laying down cards with letters written

on them in a language he doesn't understand, laying them down one

letter at a time in a sequence according to someone else's

instructions. The cards are supposed to spell out a joke in Chinese.

The guy doesn't speak Chinese, of course. He just follows his

instructions.

There are some obvious differences in your situation, of course: You

broke out of the room they had you in, so the whole enterprise has to

be portable. And the guy giving the instructions-that's you, too, just

an earlier version of you. And the joke you're telling, well, it's got

a punch line. I just don't think anyone's going to find it very funny.

So that's the idea. All you have to do is follow your instructions.

Like climbing a ladder or descending a staircase. One step at a time.

Right down the list. Simple.

And the secret, of course, to any list is to keep it in a place where

you're bound to see it.

HE CAN HEAR THE BUZZING through his eyelids. Insistent. He reaches out

for the alarm clock, but he can't move his arm.

Earl opens his eyes to see a large man bent double over him. The man

looks up at him, annoyed, then resumes his work. Earl looks around

him. Too dark for a doctor's office.

Then the pain floods his brain, blocking out the other questions. He

squirms gain, trying to yank his forearm away,  the one that feels

like it's burning. The arm doesn't move, but the man shoots him

another scowl. Earl adjusts himself in the chair to see over the top

of the man's head.

The noise and the pain are both coming from a gun in the man's hand-a

gun with a needle where the barrel should be. The needle is digging

into the fleshy underside of Earl's forearm, leaving a trail of puffy

letters behind it.

Earl tries to rearrange himself to get a better view, to read the

letters on his arm, but he can't. He lies back and stares at the

ceiling.

Eventually the tattoo artist turns off the noise, wipes Earl's forearm

with a piece of gauze, and wanders over to the back to dig up a

pamphlet describing how to deal with a possible infection. Maybe later

he'll tell his wife about this guy and his little note. Maybe his wife

will convince him to call the police.

Earl looks down at the arm. The letters are rising up from the skin,

weeping a little. They run from just behind the strap of Earl's watch

all the way to the inside of his elbow. Earl blinks at the message and

reads it again. It says, in careful little capitals, I RAPED AND

KILLED YOUR WIFE.

***

It's your birthday today, so I got you a little present. I would have

just bought you a beer, but who knows where that would have ended?

So instead, I got you a bell. I think I may have had to pawn your

watch to buy it, but what the hell did you need a watch for, anyway?

You're probably asking yourself, Why a bell? In fact, I'm guessing

you're going to be asking yourself that question every time you find

it in your pocket. Too many of these letters now. Too many for you to

dig back into every time you want to know the answer to some little

question.

It's a joke, actually. A practical joke. But think of it this way: I'm

not really laughing at you so much as with you.

I'd like to think that every time you take it out of your pocket and

wonder, Why do I have this bell? a little part of you, a little piece

of your broken brain, will remember and laugh, like I'm laughing now.

Besides, you do know the answer. It was something you learned before.

So if you think about it, you'll know.

Back in the old days, people were obsessed with the fear of being

buried alive. You remember now? Medical science not being quite what

it is today, it wasn't uncommon for people to suddenly wake up in a

casket. So rich folks had their coffins outfitted with breathing

tubes. Little tubes running up to the mud above so that if someone

woke up when they weren't supposed to, they wouldn't run out of

oxygen. Now, they must have tested this out and realized that you

could shout yourself hoarse through the tube, but it was too narrow to

carry much noise. Not enough to attract attention, at least. So a

string was run up the tube to a little bell attached to the headstone.

If a dead person came back to life, all he had to do was ring his

little bell till someone came and dug him up again.

I'm laughing now, picturing you on a bus or maybe in a fast-food

restaurant, reaching into your pocket and finding your little bell and

wondering to yourself where it came from, why you have it. Maybe

you'll even ring it.

Happy birthday, buddy.

I don't know who figured out the solution to our mutual problem, so I

don't know whether to congratulate you or me. A bit of a lifestyle

change, admittedly, but an elegant solution, nonetheless.

Look to yourself for the answer.

That sounds like something out of a Hallmark card. I don't know when

you thought it up, but my hat's off to you. Not that you know what the

hell I'm talking about. But, honestly, a real brainstorm. After all,

everybody else needs mirrors to remind themselves who they are. You're

no different.

THE LITTLE MECHANICAL VOICE PAUSES, then repeats itself. It says, "The

time is 8:00 a.m. This is a courtesy call." Earl opens his eyes and

replaces the receiver. The phone is perched on a cheap veneer

headboard that stretches behind the bed, curves to meet the corner,

and ends at the minibar. The TV is still on, blobs of flesh color

nattering away at each other. Earl lies back down and is surprised to

see himself, older now, tanned, the hair pulling away from his head

like solar flares. The mirror on the ceiling is cracked, the silver

fading increases. Earl continues to stare at himself, astonished by

what he sees. He is fully dressed, but the clothes are old, threadbare

in places.

Earl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch, but it's

gone. He looks down from the mirror to his arm. It is bare and the

skin has changed to an even tan, as if he never owned a watch in the

first place. The skin is even in color except for the solid black

arrow on the inside of Earl's wrist, pointing up his shirtsleeve. He

stares at the arrow for a moment. Perhaps he doesn't try to rub it off

anymore. He rolls up his sleeve.

The arrow points to a sentence tattooed along Earl's inner arm. Earl

reads the sentence once, maybe twice. Another arrow picks up at the

beginning of the sentence, points farther up Earl's arm, disappearing

under the rolled-up shirtsleeve. He unbuttons his shirt.

Looking down on his chest, he can make out the shapes but cannot bring

them into focus, so he looks up at the mirror above him.

The arrow leads up Earl's arm, crosses at the shoulder, and descends

onto his upper torso, terminating at a picture of a man's face that

occupies most of his chest. The face is that of a large man, balding,

with a mustache and a goatee. It is a particular face, but like a

police sketch it has a certain unreal quality.

The rest of his upper torso is covered in words, phrases, bits of

information, and instructions, all of them written backward on Earl,

forward in the mirror.

EventuallyEarl sits up, buttons his shirt, and crosses to the desk. He takes out

a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer, sits, and begins

to write.

***

I don't know where you'll be when you read this. I'm not even sure if

you'll bother to read this. I guess you don't need to.

It's a shame, really, that you and I will never meet. But, like the

song says, "By the time you read this note, I'll be gone."

We're so close now. That's the way it feels. So many pieces put

together, spelled out. I guess it's just a matter of time until you

find him.

Who knows what we've done to get here? Must be a hell of a story, if

only you could remember any of it. I guess it's better that you can't.

I had a thought just now. Maybe you'll find it useful.

Everybody is waiting for the end to come, but what if it already

passed us by? What if the final joke of Judgment Day was that it had

already come and gone and we were none the wiser? Apocalypse arrives

quietly; the chosen are herded off to heaven, and the rest of us, the

ones who failed the test,  just keep on going, oblivious. Dead

already,  wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping

score, still optimistic about the future.

I guess if that's true, then it doesn't matter what you do. No

expectations. If you can't find him, then it doesn't matter, because

nothing matters. And if you do find him, then you can kill him without

worrying about the consequences. Because there are no consequences.

That's what I'm thinking about right now, in this scrappy little room.

Framed pictures of ships on the wall. I don't know, obviously, but if

I had to guess, I'd say we're somewhere up the coast. If you're

wondering why your left arm is five shades browner than your right, I

don't know what to tell you. I guess we must have been driving for a

while. And, no, I don't know what happened to your watch.

And all these keys: I have no idea. Not a one that I recognize. Car

keys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks. What have

we been up to?

I wonder if he'll feel stupid when you find him. Tracked down by the

ten-minute man.  Assassinated by a vegetable.

I'll be gone in a moment. I'll put down the pen, close my eyes, and

then you can read this through if you want.

I just wanted you to know that I'm proud of you. No one who matters is

left to say it. No one left is going to want to.

EARL'S EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, staring through the window of the car.

Smiling eyes. Smiling through the window at the crowd gathering across

the street. The crowd gathering around the body in the doorway. The

body emptying slowly across the sidewalk and into the storm drain.

***

A stocky guy, facedown, eyes open. Balding head, goatee. In death, as

in police sketches, faces tend to look the same. This is definitely

somebody in particular. But really, it could be anybody.

Earl is still smiling at the body as the car pulls away from the curb.

The car? Who's to say? Maybe it's a police cruiser. Maybe it's just a

taxi.

As the car is swallowed into traffic, Earl's eyes continue to shine

out into the night, watching the body until it disappears into a

circle of concerned pedestrians. He chuckles to himself as the car

continues to make distance between him and the growing crowd.

Earl's smile fades a little. Something has occurred to him. He begins

to pat down his pockets; leisurely at first, like a man looking for

his keys, then a little more desperately. Maybe his progress is

impeded by a set of handcuffs. He begins to empty the contents of his

pockets out onto the seat next to him. Some money. A bunch of keys.

Scraps of paper.

A round metal lump rolls out of his pocket and slides across the vinyl

seat.  Earl is frantic now. He hammers at the plastic divider between

him and the driver, begging the man for a pen. Perhaps the cabbie

doesn't speak much English. Perhaps the cop isn't in the habit of

talking to suspects. Either way, the divider between the man in front

and the man behind remains closed. A pen is not forthcoming.

The car hits a pothole, and Earl blinks at his reflection in the

rearview mirror. He is calm now. The driver makes another corner, and

the metal lump slides back over to rest against Earl's leg with a

little jingle. He picks it up and looks at it,  curious now. It is a

little bell. A little metal bell. Inscribed on it are his name and a

set of dates. He recognizes the first one: the year in which he was

born. But the second date means nothing to him. Nothing at all.

As he turns the bell over in his hands, he notices the empty space on

his wrist where his watch used to sit. There is a little arrow there,

pointing up his arm. Earl looks at the arrow, then begins to roll up

his sleeve.

***

"You'd be late for your own funeral," she'd say. Remember? The more I

think about it, the more trite that seems. What kind of idiot, after

all, is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his own story?

And how would I know if I were late,  anyway? I don't have a watch

anymore. I don't know what we did with it.

What the hell do you need a watch for,  anyway? It was an antique.

Deadweight tugging at your wrist. Symbol of the old you. The you that

believed in time.

No. Scratch that. It's not so much that you've lost your faith in time

as that time has lost its faith in you. And who needs it,  anyway? Who

wants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future, in

the safety of the moment after the moment in which they felt something

powerful? Living in the next moment, in which they feel nothing.

Crawling down the hands of the clock, away from the people who did

unspeakable things to them. Believing the lie that time will heal all

wounds-which is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us.

But you're different. You're more perfect.  Time is three things for

most people, but for you, for us, just one. A singularity. One moment.

This moment. Like you're the center of the clock, the axis on which

the hands turn. Time moves about you but never moves you. It has lost

its ability to affect you. What is it they say? That time is theft?

But not for you. Close your eyes and you can start all over again.

Conjure up that necessary emotion, fresh as roses.

Time is an absurdity. An abstraction. The only thing that matters is

this moment. This moment a million times over. You have to trust me.

If this moment is repeated enough, if you keep trying-and you have to

keep trying-eventually you will come across the next item on your

list.

End.
