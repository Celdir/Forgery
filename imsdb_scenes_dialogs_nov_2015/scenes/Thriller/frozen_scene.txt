3   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        3

Lynch smiles at Parker.

Just then, JASON (a ski mountain employee) approaches the

front of the line and excuses the employee working the chair.

He grabs a wad of cash out of Lynch's glove and shoves it in

Parker's hand.

4   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                                4

Jason looks up at her.

She flashes an adorable but forced smile and he quickly

obliges with a cigarette.

He lights her cigarette.

He looks around, not all that sure why a cute girl is talking

to him for more than just to get a smoke.

Jason is all ears.

Jason totally sees where this is going.

5   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        5

A beat.

E

They see Parker hand Jason something. He pockets it and she

glides her way back to the end of the line.

She looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and then

excitedly waves. Proud of herself.

7   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                                 7

Dan laughs.

Parker reaches across and playfully taps Lynch.

Parker shoots Dan a look: "Oh, really?"

After a beat he awkwardly reaches out and touches her face.

Nothing sweet or sensitive about it, but he's trying.

E

Parker removes a cigarette and lights it.

E

Dan and Lynch both crack up at this, huge.

Parker blows more smoke out.

He takes her cigarette from her.

The chair suddenly stops and lurches forward slightly.   The

sound of the chair lift cuts out.

A deep silence takes over quickly, like the type of silence

that used to suddenly happen in school when you were taking a

test and the radiator that you never even noticed was on

would suddenly shut off.

Random SKIERS and BOARDERS in the surrounding chairs express

their disgust for the delay.

Parker instinctively grabs Dan's hand.

E

Lynch rocks the chair back and forth.

Parker grabs hold of the safety bar.

Dan motions to Lynch to stop.

Lynch turns around and yells behind him.

Laughter echoes from the chairs behind him.

He yells forward.

E

With a lurch, the chair starts moving forward again and the

whirring sound of the cables above them start up again.

Applause is heard from all of the other chairs.

8   EXT. TOP OF THE CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                8

Off to the side, Lynch spots SHANNON (cute, brunette, 20's)

struggling with her boot strap. She falls down on her ass.

Lynch nonchalantly maneuvers over to her side.

Lynch puts out a hand to help her and pulls her up almost

directly into his face.

Parker and Dan watch from afar as Lynch helps her with her

boot strap.

He has one hand innocently on the back of her knee and he is

fastening the strap with his other.

From their point of view, they watch Lynch helping the girl.

Almost as if on cue, RYAN (an enormous dude, 20's) stomps

over and shoves Lynch down into the snow.

E

Lynch tries to get up.

Instantly, Dan moves over to Lynch's aid. Parker follows

slowly behind him. She's clearly not too good on her board.

She shoves him back. Ryan just shakes his head at her and

shoves off, away from the group. He waits for her down the

hill a few feet.

Dan and Shannon help Lynch to his feet.

He waves to Ryan.   Ryan just looks away.

E

Shannon rolls her eyes.

She takes off after Ryan.

10   INT. SKI LODGE - EARLY EVENING                            10

Parker feels horrible.

Now Lynch feels horrible.

Parker looks to Dan.

Dan tries to help.

E

Parker isn't buying it.   She puts on a smile.

Parker laughs.

Dan looks to Lynch.

Parker laughs.

E

Parker looks to Lynch.

11   EXT. FRONT OF LODGE - MOMENTS LATER, NIGHT                   11

She looks over at Dan and Parker.

She turns and starts walking away.

Lynch walks away. He gets a few steps and then turns back

and jogs after Shannon again.

E

Lynch pats his pockets.

She laughs and shakes her head no.

12   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - MOMENTS LATER                         12

Jason ignores him.

E

Jason struggles. He sighs and looks around.        There are still

plenty of skiers coming down.

Thank you!                           Thank you so much!

Jason sends them up the lift.    He checks to make sure no one

is watching.

Dan spies something.

They look down to see THREE SKIERS hit a huge jump, one after

the other.

The wind blows the chair really hard.

Parker holds on.

E

The guys just laugh.

Parker starts laughing.

B21   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                B21

Parker is starting to shake.

He starts waving around his hands.

E

After a few more moments.

Parker is starting to whimper. In a few more seconds she may

even be teetering on full-on panic.

E

Another few beats.

She made a good point.   But still...

Silence as Dan and Lynch take this in.

Lynch tries to be the voice of reason.

E

Looking below them, it is way too far a drop to be jumping

off of the chair.

She cries into Dan's shoulder.

More moments pass in silence as they survey their situation.

Finally...

They all share an uncomfortable laugh.

Dan moves the safety bar a little.

E

Parker instantly starts freaking out with the bar up.

Dan and Parker glare at him.

Parker takes a deep breath.

Lynch lifts the safety bar up, whips out his business and

starts to pee off the side of the chair into the snow below

them.

E

Lynch finishes his business.

A low thunder clap rolls in across the trees and the chilling

wind picks up.

Silence.

Silence.

More silence.

E

They steal glances at each other.    They are soaked through.

Parker's hair is frozen.

No one acknowledges him.

He sighs and closes his eyes.

Parker starts to cry.   Neither of the guys even try to

console her.

Finally, Dan puts an arm around her.

His voice is getting hoarse.

Parker cries.

Snow starts to lightly fall around them.

They shiver together.

E

Parker chimes in first this time.

Silence.

Parker takes off her glove to light a cigarette.

As she struggles with the lighter, the glove falls out of her

lap and lands on the ground below them.

She keeps struggling with the lighter but eventually gives

up. She throws the cigarette away and puts her exposed hand

back in her pocket.

The snow falls around them.

Dan pushes the safety bar up.

E

Dan takes her face in his hands.    Tenderly.   And probably for

the first time...correctly.

Dan inspects Parker's face. It's tough to see in the dark,

but the tip of her nose and her right cheek (the side facing

into the wind) is discoloring.

Lynch is looking down below them.    It's far.

E

Lynch says nothing.

He positions himself to try and jump off.     Parker grabs his

arm.

Dan drops his snowboard down.

It lands sticking up straight in the snow.

Parker and Lynch look back at him.      They don't know what to

say.

Lynch tries to grab on to Dan's arm.

Dan shrugs free.    He is determined.    Concentrating.

Parker's tears are freezing on her cheeks as the seconds tick

by.

E

Lynch takes a deep breath. When enough time has elapsed to

think Dan's gonna jump, he suddenly looks up at Lynch instead

of jumping.

Lynch stares back at him.

Lynch musters a laugh.      It's forced, but it's a laugh.

They look forwards and backwards.

The chair behind them is not near the pole.

But the one behind that one is.

E

He and Parker just stare at it.

He starts taking deep breaths.    Trying to psyche himself up.

52   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                           52

53   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                53

Parker maneuvers herself to hold Joe's legs..

Joe tries to move into a standing position, but panics.

The gravity of this settles in.

As Lynch gets ready to try and stand again...we hear

something in the surrounds.

They freeze.

E

Again, a sort of "moan" rings in the distance.

They listen again.

Long pause...

They can't believe it...but Dan and Lynch both actually

laugh. It's uncomfortable and forced as hell. But it's a

laugh.

He focuses on the task at hand again.

Slowly he pushes up on the back of the chair again. With one

hand on Parker's shoulder and another on the back post of the

chair, Lynch gets to his feet. Looking down at the drop, he

instantly crouches down again.

E

He psyches himself up again and starts to rise up.

He puts one foot up on the top of the chair back...but it

slips off to the side.

63   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 63

He looks closely at Parker's face. The tip of her nose and

the tops of her cheeks look as if there is black soot on

them.

He motions wiping his face.

Parker follows suit, but winces in pain.

Pieces of her chapped skin are stuck to her icy glove.

Parker looks as closely as she can.

She starts rubbing at her cheek again.

E

Parker is terrified.

Staying warm is absolutely impossible. Parker hides her

exposed hand deeper inside her wet jacket.

Icicles dangle from the bottom of the chair and their

clothing.

Lynch slowly lifts himself up onto the back of the chair,

which bends at an awkward angle.

From above him we can see the long drop down, and as he

slowly starts to maneuver his body up to the top of the chair

arm- the height looks `stomach droppingly' scary.

Silence.

Lynch gets his gloved hands around the top of the cable.    It

is frozen over with a thick layer of ice.

E

The distance to the next chair seems about 10 times as far

now.

Slowly, he wraps his arms around the wire, now with his full

body weight on the back of the chair.

The bolt holding the arm into place on the cabling starts to

creak. It bends slightly, but seems to hold firm.

He starts to pull himself up onto the cable.

With one hand in front of the other, Lynch hoists himself

about two feet off of the chair and into the air.

He slides out a little bit more, his feet dangling high above

the ground.

The cable clangs somewhere to the front and back of Lynch.

The noise is almost refreshing in the silent ice covered

wilderness.

With another deep breath, Lynch moves another two feet out

over the sky. He is straining hard.

Another two feet out.    He looks down for the first time.

He sees something that scares the shit out of him.

E

He starts to pull himself back to the chair, quickly.

Lynch gets his foot on the icy chair back and tries to

balance his weight on it.

He starts to try and sit up on the back of the chair again to

continue his climbing effort.

Lynch turns and looks at her in disbelief.

E

Parker looks at him, uncertain.

Parker feels terrible.    She puts her hand on his shoulder.

Lynch shrugs her hand off of him.

E

Parker begins to sob.

Silence.

Lynch tries to change the subject.

Parker doesn't hear him. As she continues, wet snow starts

to fall around them and the icy wind starts to pick up.

E

He puts an arm around her and huddles closely trying to

shield the wind.

E

70   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - THE NEXT MORNING                           70

Painstakingly slow, she begins to peel her hand off of the

bar.

A sound that resembles `jeans slowly tearing' can be softly

heard as she moves her arm forward and separates her hand

from the skin that is attached to the metal.

After what feels like an eternity, she gives her hand one

last jerk, freeing it from the safety bar.

Her movement startles Lynch awake, and he bolts upright as if

from a `falling nightmare'.

Discombobulated, Lynch turns back and forth frantically

trying to get his bearings.

Parker is crying and holding her bloody hand,

Lynch, bug-eyed, takes in the world around him.

A fresh coat of snow has covered everything in several inches

of peaceful white bliss.

Below them, the snow has completely covered Dan's remains.

There is nothing left to show that there was ever even a

struggle.

Parker hides her bloody hand back inside of her coat, away

from Lynch's eyes.

E

He turns to look at Parker. It takes everything he has to

not jolt back in horror at how bad her face looks.

She starts to touch her face.

Lynch stops her.

He looks around, front to back.   In daylight it's easier to

see the other chairs.

His breath blows out of his body in huge plumes of mist.

E

His voice echoes off of the frozen trees, almost as if

taunting him.

He turns around to look at the chairs behind him.

Parker doesn't speak.

Lynch doesn't respond. The look on his face says that "no

one is coming" but he decides there's no harm in waiting just

a little while longer.

Lynch tries to yell for help again, though his soar throat is

making it almost impossible to scream.

E

Once again...only echoes.

He re-settles in his chair.

E

E

Emotion has fought it's way to the surface again.   Parker and

Lynch share a nervous laugh together.

She turns away from him.

After a few seconds, her laughs turn to tears.

E

Parker laughs.

Parker laughs harder.

E

Parker laughs through her tears.

Lynch is determined.

77   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                              77

As his foot pushes fast on the chair, it swings at an

impossible angle.

TIGHT ON the connecting bolts as one of them SNAPS!

The chair leans hard to the right side, forcing Parker to

slide down into what is now the bottom corner of the chair.

The chair is still in place, but it is now hanging by one

bolt and at a severe angle.

Joe tries to look back over his shoulder, struggling to keep

himself on the cable against his own body weight and wet

clothing.

Another grunt and Lynch makes another big move forward.

The camera booms up above him, shooting straight down at the

distance between his dangling body and the frozen ground.

Tight on his gloved hands as they slowly slide forward on the

metal cable.

Lynch squeezes his eyes shut and takes another reach forward.

Behind him, Parker looks on in agony.      She is holding her

breath and whispering...

E

The metal arm above her groans under the pressure that the

one remaining bolt is under. Looking at the arm in this

state, it is especially eerie to imagine how these metal

chairs even stay attached to the cables in the first place.

Lynch takes another move forward.

Lynch reaches forward again...and his hand slips on the icy

cable. He momentarily hangs by one arm.

He reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning.

Another few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfway

across to the next chair.

From Lynch's point of view we can see his feet floating above

the earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat. His own

pained breathing fills his ears.

It's only now that he sees two of the wolves watching him

from the bushes.

The wind blows hard against him, swaying his body back and

forth as he momentarily rests.

E

Parker looks down, just in time to see one of the wolves duck

back into the bushes.

Her movement makes the chair groan harder. The cable twangs

loudly between Lynch's shaky movements and the twisted metal

that holds the arm in place.

Slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions

himself over the other chair.

He drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading down

into the snow below.

He quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sides

of the chair.

He looks behind him at the next chair. Just a few feet back

from it is the giant green lift pole... and a ladder!

He stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable.   He is

weak.

Very weak.

She can't quite hear him.

E

Parker nods.

She takes Lynch's ski pole and tries to throw it as far as

she can back at him.

The action forces another terrifying metallic groan from the

arm above her, and her chair swings back and forth from the

motion.

The pole lands under the second chair, splitting the distance

between where she is and where the tree is.

He starts to pull himself up again, but turns back to Parker

one more time.

The chair has settled down.

He pulls himself up, straining hard.

This gets the wolves attention.

In the bushes their ears and eyes perk up to the sky,

watching their potential next meal grapple with the high wire

cable.

With reserved strength, Lynch shimmies across the cable as

quickly as he can.

Back at Parker's chair, she eyes the bending metal bolt that

E

is keeping her from plunging to the ground.

Tears stream down her face again.

He stops once to catch his breath, but begins moving as

quickly as possible.

Finally, he reaches the second chair behind them and drops

down into it.

Looking at the lift pole from this position, he can clearly

see that it wasn't as close to the chair as it looked.

But it's possible.

Parker needs to yell to hear him now.

He assesses the situation.

It's going to take a big leap to try and get near the ladder

and he is winded beyond belief.

The two stare at each other from the distance.   Both of their

weather beaten faces are a mess.

Parker is buried in the corner of the chair closest to the

ground, holding on to the back of it to keep herself steady.

Stoically, Lynch turns away from her and takes a deep breath.

He climbs up onto the chair back and looks down.

Parker closes her eyes and prays.

The wolves below do not break their stare.   Their hungry eyes

are willing Lynch to fall from the chair.

It's now or never.

He throws himself off of the chair and towards the ladder!

Parker concentrates and slowly tries to hold up her weight as

she inches her body even lower.

Smoothly, slowly, almost there- SNAP!   The bolt gives way!

The chair lurches down at an even greater angle, sending

Parker off of the side!

WHIRRR! WAP! No longer attached with the safety bolts, the

chair falls several feet and then stops. It is now hanging

only by the one weak thread of cabling that was used to

initially wire it to the main line.

Parker's hands catch at the base of the chair, and she is

dangling fully beneath it.

While it is still a long drop...her feet are now a good 10

feet closer to the ground, if not more.

CREEEEEK! The metal wire will not hold for more than a few

seconds. The chair is going to fall!

Parker closes her eyes.

All sound cuts out except for her quick breathing and her

heartbeat.

The camera shows us how much the last flimsy wire does not

like this movement as it stretches and the chair sways in the

wind.

Slowly she looks down and prepares herself to fall.

E

The camera inches closer in to her face from below.

Her heartbeat and breathing are all we hear until finally...

She let's go.

As her body falls from the chair, the flimsy wire finally

gives way and the rickety metal seat plummets straight down

to the ground after her.

Her eye closes.
