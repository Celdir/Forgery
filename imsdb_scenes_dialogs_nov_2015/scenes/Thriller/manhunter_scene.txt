Manhunter

EXT. MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEACH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY

The highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men

imposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK

CRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington.

His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white

sleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late

thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio-

let shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from

a glass of iced tea. Then:

Crawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at Graham.

2.

Graham flips his cigarette into the surf.

Crawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket. He keeps

them face down. They draw at Will. Crawford knows this.

3.

4.

5.

As he puts an arm around Molly...

EXT. BEACH - KEVIN - TWILIGHT

is working in the sand. Behind him Graham is stapling

chicken wire to two foot-high fence posts.

EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - CRAWFORD + MOLLY - NIGHT

On the porch swing. Beyond them at the water's edge Graham

nothing to each other    the fence. Crawford and Molly say

or a while. Then, finally:

6.

There is a pause between them. Molly lights a cigarette.

Crawford leans forward, resting his thick, pale, forearms

on his knees.

EXT. ATLANTA STREET - WIDE - NIGHT

Small poplars line the curb. It rained. The sidewalks are

wet. They are drying in splotches. The street is deserted.

The front walk vertically bisects the FRAME. An Atlanta

Police department car pulls to the curb and stops. The door

opens, lighting the interior and Will Graham starts out the

passenger side.

7.

8.

WIDER - GRAHAM

moves into the room. The bloodstains are extensive. Half

the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock. The

mirrors are smashed. Taped outlines on the mattress indi-

cate where the bodies had been found. Graham opens the

file he carries containing autopsy, lab and crime reports.

OVERHEAD ANGLE - GRAHAM

standing alone in the middle of the master bedroom. The

crime scene -- the disarray, the big splashes of arterial

blood on the walls, the smashed mirrors, taped outlines or

bodies -- is a testament to a violence that is pornographic.

Graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his

own notes, thumbing through various reports for reference.

9.

ZNT. LEEDS BATHROOM - MEDICINE CABINET - NIGHT

is dark. We see nothing. Light comes on. Graham enters.

He rests his hands on the sides of the sink. He turns on

the water. He pops two pills, cups his hands under the

faucet and drinks. He looks at himself in the mirror. Be

is breathing normally. Over his shoulder he sees...

ZOOM INTO: MRS. LEEDS' PANTYHOSE

still hanging on a towel railing over the bathtub. Graham

is staring at the normal domesticity of a family bathroom.

He doesn't let it unnerve him.

EXT. LEEDS' HOUSE; PORCH ROOF - WIDE - NIGHT

The window opens and Graham climbs onto the porch roof and

sits on the gritty shingles. We're looking for a distressed

reaction. There is none. Graham is clamped down. Beyond

him, the lights of Atlanta and the stars are brilliant...

More brilliant than they ought to be. The Delta Aquirid

meteor shower's at its maximum This is not a normal image.

He takes out his tape recorder again.

HOLD ON Graham.

INT. ATLANTA HYATT HOUSE, ELEVATOR - WIDE - NIGHT

Graham riding up with two half-drunk CONVENTIONEERS with big

"Hi" badges. One Conventioneer is looking over at the lobby

below.

10.

A good-looking woman in a floral dress walks underneath them.

Graham is leaning against the glass.

The other cracks up.

GRAHAM

snaps alert and stares at Conventioneer #2.

CONVENTIONEER #2

sips his gin and tonic, senses Graham's stare. He smiles:

Graham looks away. The elevator stops. The door opens.

Conventioneer #1 drags Conventioneer #2.

Both Conventioneers laugh as they walk down the hall.

Conventioneer #1 wiggles his fat hips and apes a limp wrist

Graham looks away.

ZNT. HOLIDAY ZNN ROOM - VTR MONITOR: LEEDS FAMILY - NIGHT

We are seeing a videotape transfer of the Leeds family home

movie. Mr. Leeds and Mrs. Leeds are behind the table while

the youngest boy is in the center. His brother sits next

to him. The birthday cake has eleven candles on it. All

are mouthing silently: "Happy Birthday to you, happy birth-

day to you..." Mrs. Leeds has her arms crossed underneath

her breasts. She's a young mother, sensual and warm. She's

smiling. The camera must be on a tripod because Mr. Leeds

runs into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his

wife's cheek. He has thinning hair. He's a big man. He

looks like a nice guy. He darts out of the frame back to

the camera. They finish singing. The youngest Leeds boy

blows out the candles. Mr. Leeds holds up for the camera

a large yellow envelope that says: "Follow the ribbon." A

big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope.

11.

The camera pans right as the youngest Leeds boy starts to

follow the ribbon... The image suddenly ours out. Video noise.

GRAHAM

has hit the stop button. He picks up a measured field sketch

of the master bedroom. The bloodstains are represented in

outline. Three are along the left wall. The arterial

splashes from Mr. Leeds are on the right wall. Mr. and Mrs.

Leeds' body positions are indicated on the king-size mat-

tress.

Graham can't go any further. He is frustrated. He picks

up the phone and dials. He waits. Then:

Will hangs up the phone. He reaches over and punches "Play"

on the VTR.

12.

WIDE SHOT: THE ROOM - GRAHAM

VTR backs up, starts to play and we see the image of Mrs.

Leeds again in the home movie: they follow the yellow rib-

bon down the stairs to a bicycle. It's indoors. It's rain-

ing outside. The eleven-year-old Leeds boy is ecstatic.

Mrs. Leeds smiles.

FAST MOVEMENTS: GRAHAM'S HAND

snakes out and hits the "Stop" button on the VTR.

PHONE

is picked up and we MOVE WITH IT to his face. Graham punches

numbers into the phone. He waits. He clamps dawn again.

He is cold, calm.

13.

INT. ATLANTA DETECTIVE BUREAU - MOVING WITH GRAHAM, CRAWFORD

+ SPRINGFIELD -DAY

down the corridor.

14.

Springfield looks at Graham. Springfield needs answers, not

voodoo. Then they enter the squad room. Twenty detectives

sit at desks. Graham and Crawford move to the back of the

class.

DR. DOMINIQUE PRINCI, Chief Medical Examiner for Fulton

County, walks to the front and stands under a drawing of

teeth. He hold's up a dental cast.

The teeth look like teeth from a small bear.

Graham doesn't like talking in public. He stutters and

starts to say something...

Graham walks to the front of the room.

15.

Graham sits down.

They start to rise. Springfield remembers.

Detectives file out. Crawford and Graham remain.

Springfield crosses to them and they wait for all the other

detectives to leave.

Dr. Princi joins them.

16.

Graham doesn't answer.

17.

Crawford starts to move. The PHONE RINGS. Springfield

answers.

Lemme put you on the speaker phone.

Springfield reacts.

Hangs up.

18.

SPRINGFIELD

thought Graham was ridiculous. Now his expression is very

changed.

GRAHAM

senses Springfield's staring at him. Graham's face is blank.

He leaves. Springfield -- shaking Crawford's hand -- watches

Graham all the way to the door.

EXT. ATLANTA POLICE HEADQUARTERS - GRAHAM s CRAWFORD - DAY

coming down the stairs. News media are all over Springfield,

the Commissioner, the Mayor's P.R. Officer in the b.g. No-

body recognizes Crawford and Graham except one short man, who

separates himself from the pack and darts up to them. He is

LOUNDS. He starts chasing behind them.

CLOSE: GRAHAM

walking down the stairs. His face is locked like a steel

trap. He's repressing something powerful.

Graham won't answer him. They are on the sidewalk by now.

Graham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now. Crawford

tries to block Lounds. Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham:

Right now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to

turn him around.

19.

20.

Say we've arrested a good suspect.

You walk in and see him. What

is there about him that doesn't

surprise you?

I don't know, Jack. He's got no

face for me.

You can tell something about him

or we wouldn't have found the finger

print. ..

Don't expect too much from me, Jack,

all right?

We'll get him one way or the other.

What's one way?

We find an event that connects both

families. Same vacation hotel; same

hospital, different times. Then we

check employees and come up with a

male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...

If we find out how he found them,

then we'll find him.

We're running it through the

computers now. So far there's no

event or service that doubles back

into both families. Plus they were

big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing

trips, scuba, videogames, lots of

routine medical and dental. It's

a haystack.

What's the other?

He makes noise going in and the

husband gets to a gun in time.

No other possibilities?

You think I'm gonna spot him 'across

a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza

you're thinking about.

21.

Crawford's cup of coffee stops in front of his mouth:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM - DAY

In the middle of packing. Then the PHONE RINGS.

22.

There is a silence. Graham does not want to tell her that

he is going to see Lecter. Molly stays cool, she doesn't

pursue it.

23.

Molly interrupts:

Graham holds the phone close to him. As if it were a part of

Molly herself.

WIDE SHOT: GRAHAM

slowly hangs up the phone. He sits, round-shouldered, on

the bed. All over the room are clothes out of drawers and

closets, videotapes and files: the mess of being only half-

packed.

INT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR CRIMINALLY INSANE

DR. CHILTON - DAY

24.

25 .

DR. CHILTON

looks at Graham. Dr. Chilton has seen a lot of hostility.

Right now he's seeing some more.

INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY SECTION - DOOR - DAY

We hear three locks opening. The door opens. Graham enters.

An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the

bolts lock again. As Graham is walking towards us, we WIDEN

and TRACK IN. It makes the b.g. disorienting as we get closer

to Graham's face. The CAMERA DROPS as Graham sits in a single

chair. We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at. Now:

GRAHAM'S POV: BARRED CELL

A 6x10 cage. In the center of the bars separating Graham

from the Occupant is a three-foot-square perspex sheet. The

occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him. In

the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer. In the

cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR. HANNIBAL LECKTOR. He

appears to be asleep. His back is to Graham. He has not

stirred. Then:

CLOSE: LECKTOR'S HEAD

turns to us. His small eyes drill into Graham's brain.

Lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if Graham

is the patient.

26.

GRAHAM' S

struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his

emotional reactions.

Lecktor rolls around and examines the term "layman" in his

head. Then:

27.

It's in the transcript. What does

it matter now?

It doesn't matter to me, Will.

I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.

Yes, I thought so.

It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.

Yes .

You read about it, I'm sure.

In the papers. I don't rear out the

articles.

I wouldn't want them to think I was

dwelling on anything morbid. You

want to know how he's choosing them,

don't you?

I thought you would have some ideas.

Why should I tell you?

There are things you don't have.

Research materials... I could speak

to the Chief of Staff...?

Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He

fumbles at your head like a freshman

pulling at a panty girdle.

He actually tries to give me a

Thematic and Apperception test.

Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to

come up. It's a card with a woman

in bed and a man in the foreground.

I was supposed to avoid a sexual

interpretation. I laughed in his

face.

Never mind, it's boring.

28.

Graham does not answer, If anything happens, there is a

tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to

Lecktor.

Another silence. Lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling

into Graham's head, trying to find out things. Trying to

find a way to hurt Graham. He's very threatening. Then

relaxes:

29.

Graham gets up and starts to walk away.

Graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant.

Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding

tray. Lecktor pulls it through.

GRAHAM

sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take

one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:

30.

GRAHAM'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE PAN THROUGH CELL OP

DR. LECKTOR

Toothbrush, mirror, sink, Sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour-

nals, T-shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with-

no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc

All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light.

Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal. The

shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes. It is a high

resolution, highly brilliant sec of images. It feels like a

hyper-perception of reality, a super-realism perceived by the

mind of Graham. It is interrupted when:

GRAHAM

snaps back to the present, looks at Lecktor.

31.

Threat.

Graham bangs on the door. Locks are starting to be unlocked.

Graham can't wait to get out of here. He wants the locks to

get unlocked faster!

The door is now open. Graham fights down the impulse to run

through. As Graham -- controlled -- steps out, what he hears

is :

The DOOR SLAMS shut on Lecktor.

32.

INT. CHESAPEAKE: STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY

INSANE, CORRIDOR - GRAHAM - DAY

walks down the corridor. He's very stiff. He's walking

towards the outside door. The door is a rectangle of white

light that sends daggers of brilliance across the highly

polished institution's floor. Graham walks for the light.

EXT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY

INSANE - ENTRANCE - DAY

The DOOR SLAMS open and Graham comes out into daylight and

air. The air is tactile to him. He can almost feel the

motes of dust and light that swim freely. He breathes.

GRAHAM'S POV: GRASS

is dappled with pointillist points of color: a spectral

breakup. As it returns to a normal green...

TIGHT SHOT: GRAHAM

breathes. He stands in front of the sign on the building:

"CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE." He

leans against the railing and breathes clean air. The image

is flattened in a LONG LENS. We hear a CLICK. It FOCUSES

and DE-FOCUSES.

INT. CXR - FREDDIE LOUNDS - DAY

is photographing Graham with a Nikon and a 500mm Questar

reflector. Be puts the camera to his eye again and hits the

button. The MOTOR DRIVE knocks off three shots.

INT. G:,TEWAY LABS - SCREEN DIVIDED INTO FOUR QUADRANTS - DAV

The quadrants display 4 home movies at six times normal

speed: an old couple, 2 men, a baby and a family. The fam-

ily quadrant slows to normal. We TIGHTEN in on it. We will

come to know these people as the SHERMANS. An 11-year-old boy,

a I4-year-old girl, Mr. Sherman and Mrs. Sherman. A handmade

sign says:   "THE NEW HOUSE - SWIMMING POOL." Mrs. Sherman has

brown hair.  She wears a bikini.   She has a nice body. She's

sensuous and tan in her thirties.  She dives into the pool.

The next shot: water. Out of the water surfaces Mrs.

Sherman. She shakes her head and water sprays off her hair.

33.

A couple drops hit the lens and diffuse a small area of the

image. Mrs. Sherman puts her hands on the side of the pool

and shoves down to hoist herself out. Her breasts are glis-

tening. Her teeth are white. She smiles at the camera.

Whoever controls the console puts Mrs. Sherman in reverse.

It runs forward again. Mrs. Sherman's glistening body coming

our of the water...

REAR SHOT: CONSOLE AND A MAN

Beyond is the screen. The man at the console is FRANCIS

DOLLARHYDE. He has a weightlifter's body. We don't see his

face. Black goggles with red lenses are on the console. He

puts them on and watches Mrs. Sherman...

INT. NEGATIVE PROCESSING ROOM - DOOR - DAY

It slams open. Dollarhyde enters and walks through the dim

green light past the developers in his black goggles with

red lenses. Thousands of feet of negative move through the

tank on rollers. Dollarhyde walks past the baths. We TRACK

WITH him to the door.

INT. LIGHT TRAP-DOOR - DAY

slams open. Dollarhyde enters. As he reaches the next door...

INT. DRYER ROOM - DOLLARHYDE - DAY

enters and we TRACK WITH him past film snaking across pul-

leys and rollers through the drying cabinets. As Dollarhyde

passes the dryers...

INT. CAFETERIA - DOLLARHYDE - DAY

in the brilliant aluminum and peach cafeteria gets coffee.

A newspaper's under his arm. As he waits to pay, EILEEN

approaches. She, too, wears goggles, but on a lanyard around

her neck. She's petite, fragile. Dollarhyde towers over her.

CLOSER - DOLLARHYDE

looks up.

34.

His face bears the scars of a Z-plast procedure to fix a

harelip and cleft palate. Immediately, in characteristic

gesture, he curls his right hand under his nose to hide

his Z-plast scars.

Graciously Dollarhyde lets her go first and then he crosses

to an empty table. He opens his newspaper.

TRACK ACROSS FRANCIS DOLLARHME'S BACK

where the fabric stretches between his shoulder blades and

past his cheap haircut's line at the nape of his neck into

his left shoulder to reveal he's reading the National Tattler.

It's about Will Graham with a Freddie Lounds byline. The

only words we catch are: "FBI Manhunter Consults Fiend Who

Tried To Kill Him, by Freddie Lounds." We also catch: "The

Tooth Fairy - Psychopathic Slayer of Entire Families in

Birmingham and Atlanta..."

CLOSE: FRANCIS DOLLABHYDE

takes off the black goggles with red lenses. His eyes are

white violet. He turns the page.

NATIONAL TATTLER'S OLD PICTURE OF GRAHAEI

It's the one Lounds took after Graham was slashed by Lecktor.

It's a black-and-white square image of a sleeping man with a

myriad of tubes running into his stomach and a temporary

colostomy bag. A black square is imposed over his genitals.

The caption reads: "Federal Manhunter Will Graham Recover-

ing from Near-Fatal Slashing By Hannibal 'the Cannibal'

Lecktor."

35.

36.

There is a pause. Lecktor is waiting.

37.

ON the phone as Lecktor hangs up.

INT. L1011, COACH SECTION - CRAHAM - DAY

Squeezed into a narrow seat. He sits on the aisle. Next to

him is a seven-year-old girl, at the window her mother. He

opens and reads a Telex in yellow envelope: "BIRMINGHAM P.D.

FOUND JACOBI CAT DEAD IN BACK YARD. KIDS MUST HAVE BURIED

IT. HE KILLS THE PETS. REGARDS, CRAWFORD."

STEWARDESS

Clears the trays.

GRAHAM

contorts his body to pull his briefcase from under the seat

in front. He extracts the Leeds and Jacobi files. From each

he takes a snapshot of a happy family picture and paperclips

them to the front of the files. He stands them on the dinner

tray and stares at them.

GRAHAM'S POV: HAPPY FAMILY PORTRAITS

SLOWLY ZOOM IN TO the Jacobi family. As we get CLOSER and

CLOSER TO Mrs. Jacobi in a bikini, her face abstracts into

pointillist dots of color...

EXT. MARATHON BOATYARD - DIESEL ENGINE - DAY

moves down to us...

MOLLY

approaches in SLOW MOTION raising a bag of shrimp and a six-

pack of Dos Equis.

INT. UNFINISHED HULL - GRAHAM

guiding the engine down, wears faded violet shorts and no

shirt. We see a huge circular scar ending in a hook on his

abdomen as the engine lands...

38.

Graham waves to Molly...

GRAHAM

On the dock. The hot sun turns the water a brilliant aqua

and silver. Graham's tan body in the violet shorts on the

silver wood... Molly reaches in the bag for another shrimp.

Graham looks at her...

MOLLY SMILES

as she rips the head off the shrimp. The warm mouth, Her

shiny teeth look like a Pepsodent commercial.

HEAD COMING OFF SHRIMP

Viscera trail. As the shrimp is ripped apart we see:

GRAHAM'S EYES

In horror. And O.S., we hear SCREAMING coming from a differ-

ent place as we...

INT. L1011 - GRAHAM - DAY

snaps awake. The child next to Graham is screaming. People

stare. The mother is shouting at him. Graham is confused,

stunned... He doesn't know what's wrong. He looks around...

The Stewardess is handling things on his tray in front of

him.

TRAY

The file has spilled open. Crime photos of the Leeds and

Jacobi families with mirrors in their eyes and the almost

separated head of Mr. Jacobi glaring at a weird angle -- the

pornography of it all -- are spilled across Graham's tray and

in his lap...

GRAHAM

mumbles apologies, scrambles to collect crime photos. The

mother wants her seat changed.

39.

Graham is excruciatingly embarrassed, clumsily shoving them

back into their files...

INT. JACOBI HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - WIDE ON DOOR - DAY

We MOVE INTO the knob... it starts to turn. Slowly. Sud-

denly: door SLAMS open revealing real estate agent GEEHAN

and Graham,

Geehan leaves. The door closes with a SLAM.

WIDE - GRAHAM

In the empty white living room. Graham walks OUT OF FRAME.

Bare floors and dead air. His footsteps echo in the empty

house.

40.

EXT. JACOBI HOUSE - WIDE - DAY

An image from Bill Owens' "Suburbia." A family house. No

different than any other family house around. But it is

somehow sinister in its vacancy. It ought to be littered

with bicycles and wagons: the signs and symbols of suburban

normalcy. TRACK LEFT to reveal the back of Graham staring at

the house from across the street.

EXT. NEXT DOOR HOUSE - GRAHAM - DAY

In a different position staring at the rear of the house from

a neighbor's bushes. We don't know why Graham is staring at

the Jacobi house from different vantage points.

EXT. SIDEROAD - GRAHAM'S POV: 3/4 VIEW OF JACOBI HOUSE

DAY

Graham looking at the house from the third vantage point.

JACOBI BACKYARD

And turned earth where the cat was found.

REARSHOT: GRAHAM

starts backing up and we MOVE WITH him. He looks over his

shoulder at us and keeps walking backwards. Trees enter the

frame on the left and right.

TRACKING GRAHAM IN PROFILE

He stumbles through underbrush into a dry streambed. He

backs up a slope on the other side and finds himself in some

trees. There are three. Graham looks around.

BRANCHES

now obscure the Jacobi house. Something glints right...

SEARCHING THROUGH GRASS

At the base of one elm tree. A ring tab from a soft drink

can is half-buried in leaves. Graham's fingers move leaves

aside.

41.

GRAHAM

looks slowly up the tree trunk.

RED CREEK MUD

Wedged into the first strong limb, it's from the instep of

a boot.

GRAHAM

hangs his coat on the branch of a neighboring tree and climbs

the far side of the elm. His head and his cheek raise

through limbs. His eye is six inches away when he finds a

soft drink can wedged between limb and trunk.

He photographs its placement with the camera on his belt,

bracketing exposures. Then he tears a small branch and uses

it to put the can in an evidence bag. Graham climbs higher

until his foot is level to where he saw the mud. He looks

to his left. Something he sees stops him cold.

A SYMBOL

is carved in the wood.

GRAHAM

photographs this as well as a branch that's been trimmed by

a cutting tool. Then he looks...

OVER GRAHAM'S SHOULDER: THE JACOBI HOUSE

A perfect view.

GRAHAM

high in the tree, leans back against the trunk. Re seems

frozen. Then:

42.

INT. JACOBI HOUSE - GEEHAN + PROSPECTIVE BUYERS

DAY

Geehan showing some new candidates around the house. It's a

YOUNG COUPLE and they look interested.

Geehan's got a sale. He's at the front door. He opens

it.

EXT. JACOBI HOUSE - DOOR - DAY

The door is opened by Geehan and his big smile, shepherding

his customers-to-be out the front door. The smile falls off

Geehan's face. The young buyers look quizzically.

43.

GEEHAN

has deflated against the doorframe.

GEEHAN'S POV: THREE ATLANTA P.D. CARS, A FORENSICS

TRUCK, + ATLANTA P.D. HELICOPTER

with flashers going are converging onto the scene. Will

Graham is at the nearest police car talking on a cellular

phone .

INT. WASHINGTON, FBI OFTICE - CRAWFORD - DAY

On phone to Graham.

As another line on Crawford's phone rings, we PULL BACK to

his secretary, SARAH's area.

TIGHTEN ON Sarah. We don't hear what's said to her.

44.

She holds the receiver as though it had died in her hand

and crosses into Crawford's office.

EXT. JACOBI HOUSE - GXAHAM - DAY

INT. WASHINGTON FBI OFFICE - CRAWFORD + GRAHAM- LATER

It's now sunset out the window. Both men are tense. On

Crawford's desk are two new telephones and a tape recorder.

Also in the room are Sarah and DR. SIDNEY BLOOM, a forensic

psychologist. Food wrappings and Styrofoam coffee cups

litter his desk. Bloom only ate half his pastrami on rye:

45.

Graham turns to the window. Crawford taps a pencil on

his desk. They wait,

SAME - LATER - NIGHT

Crawford's feet are on his desk. Sarah yawns. Graham leans

against the other wall. Stony silence. RING. They react.

FOUR more RINGS.

She hangs up. Crawford takes Bill's call on the other line.

The rest exhale tension and go back to waiting.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - FAUCET - NIGHT

Runs water.

GRAHAM.

stares at it. He puts his hands under and runs cold water

on his upturned wrists.

46.

INT. CBAWFORD'S OFFICE - CRAWFORD - NIGHT

Looking through reports. He picks up a pencil and starts

to correct a line when:  RING.

RING .

RING .

An assistant runs out. RING. Sarah's anxious.

EXT. CORRIDOR - GRAHAM - NIGHT

Running. He slips on the polished floor, recovers himself

... He darts through Crawford's door.

INT. CXAWFORD'S OFFICE - GRAHAM

tries to catch his breath as Sarah snaps up the phone.

Sarah punches hold. Crawford is counting seconds. He

raises his thumb. Graham grabs the phone.

47.

CRAWFORD

scribbles on a piece of paper.

Crawford holds up the piece of paper. It says: "Chicago

phone booth. Police scrambling."

Graham stares at Crawford. Crawford makes a circular motion

with his hand: string him on.

48.

Graham and us hear a telephone booth door slam open. We hear

a receiver fall with a CLANG. He hear faint voices. The

receiver bangs as it's swung on the cord. Everyone in the

outer office hears it on the speaker phone. They also hear:

Graham drops the phone. Tension floods out of him. In the

outer office people are cheering,

CLOSE ON GRAHAM

His eyes almost start to tear in relief as he turns his back

and looks out the window.

CRAWFORD'S

ecstatic .

Graham grabs the phone.

49.

ZOOM IN ON Graham's face. It locks in rage.

EXT. CHICAGO STREET, PHONE BOOTH - FREDDIE LOUNDS - NIGHT

grabs for the phone.

INT. CHESAPEAKE HOSPITAL, DR. CHILTON'S OFFICE -

DR. CHILTON - NIGHT

There is a KNOCK on his door.

Dr. Chilton reacts.

50.

Guard pulls three sheers of toiler paper with writing on them

out of his pocket. We HOLD ON it.

DR. CHILTON

is already dialling a number.

INT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sarah answers the phone.

In the b.g. all hell is breaking loose. Crawford and Graham

are both hollering into the phone at Freddie Lounds.

51.

Sarah puts Chilton on "Hold." TRACK her INTO the room. She

starts to say something. Crawford holds up a hand...

Graham punches the phone and takes the call. Crawford's

yelling at Lounds.

Graham waves Crawford to the other phone.

Crawford punches into Dr. Chilton's call.

INT. CHESAPEAKE HOSPITAL - DR. CHIITON - NIGHT

52.

CRAWFORD

punches the other line.

53.

INT. FBI BUILDING, HAIR AND FIBER SECTION - BEVERLY KATZ

- NIGHT

is bent over a microscope. She's under it. Behind her

a male assistant brushes a child's bib overalls with a

metal spatula. He is collecting whatever debris comes off

the clothing onto a white paper sheet. BEVERLY KATZ lifts

something with tweezers. She leans away from the micro-

scope .

54.

INT. LATENT PRINTS - JIMMIE PRICE - NIGHT

winces at the sight of the paper. He slips it under the

helium cadmium laser.

THE HELIUM CADMIUM LASER

bombards the toilet paper with light. Growing smudges appear

on the paper.

INT. DOCUMENTS - LLOYD BOWMAN - NIGHT

is underlit by his translucent light box. The note is on

it.

55.

BOWMAN

moves under a rostrum camera setup. There are lights mounted

on a 360-degree rim even with the base of the rostrum Bowman

hits a switch. The top lights go out. The side lights are

very oblique.

MACRO CLOSEUP: NOTE

Under the oblique light the tooth impressions stand out.

We hear a SHUTTER CLICK as they are photographed.

A pane of glass descends on the note and flattens the jagged

edges of the hole.

EVEN CLOSER: THE EDGES

are tattered and smeared with vermillion ink.

LIGHTING PANEL

Bowman's fingers hit it. The room is darkened, except for a

dull glow from the infrared source..

56.

ROSTRUM

Bowman switches to a closed-circuit TV camera.

MONITOR

The image focuses as Bowman focuses the lens. Then:

The ink smear is gone. Fragments of writing appear.

GBAHAM, CRAWFORD + BOWMAN

at the monitor lit by the infrared glow.

As they run out of the room:

INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - WIDE SHOT - NIGHT

Everyone we've seen is assembled: Graham, Crawford, Beverly

Katz, Jimmie Price and Bowman.

57.

The Chicago office is running through

all the personal ads in the Tattler

right now.

When do they go to press?

In thirty-five minutes.

Christ!

After we find Lecktor's response,

we substitute our own. Somewhere

tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will

actually buy Tattler, looking for

Lecktor's message. Here's

what he'll find, Bill.

'Dear Avid Fan: inherit my mantle

and surpass my achievements.

Mementoes for you at Baltimore

Central. Left luggage 72683.

It's a Secret Service letter drop

and stakeout. He shows: we take

him.

Anything from Chicago?

Not yet.

Let's get to the physical.

There was no print. I'm here for

kicks .

One whisker. Scale counts and core

size match Hannibal Lecktor's. So

does color. The color's different

than the Tooth Fairy's taken in

Birmingham and Atlanta. Three blue

grains and some dark flecks went to

Brian's end.

58.

Bowman sets up his photographs on an easel.

The phone RINGS. Graham punches the speaker.

59.

Bowman is already running through the onion-skinned pages of

a Bible he took from a shelf. Nobody talks to him.

Everybody exhibits disciplined surface calm. The tension is

screaming underneath.

BOWMAN

furiously looking through pages of the Bible, suddenly stops.

60.

Bowman's our the door.

61.

Graham has to decide. Long pause. Then he looks up:

INT. ST. LOUIS AIRPORT NEWSSTAND - FLOOR - DAY

The floor is in focus. In the b.g., are busy, out-of-focus

images: newspapers, magazines, people passing. We don't

know why we are HOLDING on the empty floor. Then, a stack

of "Tattlers" hits the floor. The headlines include: "HEAD

TRANSPLANT and ASTRONOMERS GLIMPSE GOD!"

INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL ROOM - WILL GRAHAM - NIGHT

asleep in bed. Sheets are twisted between his legs.

62.

His arms are widespread. The phone RINGS. Will Graham

doesn't hear it. It keeps RINGING. MOVE IN on Graham.

Finally, he stirs, then fights his way up out of sleep.

PROFILE: GRAHAM

sits up. His hand snakes out and grabs the phone to make it

stop ringing.

On the move...

63.

INT. GRAHAM HOUSE, MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEDROOM - MOLLY

NIGHT

She's asleep. Kevin enters.

Kevin looks over her shoulder out the window as if he's

scared of something.

MOLLY

starts and sits up...

INT. GRAHAM HOUSE - HALLWAY & KITCHEN

are empty. Dark shadows play against darkened walls. O.S.

we hear crashing wave. Moonlight makes trees whipped in

the wind throw dappled shadows across the corridor. Molly

enters the frame in CLOSE SHOT. We TRACK WITH her in a

THREE-QUARTER REAR SHOT behind the back of her head. She

feels vulnerable. The dappled leaves whip across her face

in a sudden gust. Molly's head snaps around.

MOLLY'S POV: GLASS PORTICO

with the tree moving in the wind. Beyond is the ocean with

moonlight on the surf. Nothing.

MOLLY

moves into the kitchen. A streetlight hits part of the

kitchen with a dim phosphorescent green.

64.

He catches Molly's eye:

MOLLY'S POV: KITCHEN WINDOW

A silhouette shape moves past the window. The angle of the

streetlight plays its shadow on the wall against Molly.

FRONTAL CLOSEUP: MOLLY

frozen. She hears the outer screen door being opened...

BEHIND MOLLY & OVER HER SHOULDER TO KITCHEN DOOR

The shape is at the door. Molly takes a couple of steps,

and can't go any further.

MOLLY

breathless, opens the door. Fast.

DOOR

reveals Florida State TROOPER.

EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - TROOPER + MOLLY - NIGHT

As Molly comes out of the house, we PULL BACK and CRANE UP

INTO a very HIGH ANGLE WIDE SHOT revealing: Four state

trooper cars parked on Graham's property. On the road are

two roadblocks 100 yards apart on either side of Graham's

house. All their flashers are going. Molly looks around in

confusion. We see her turn to the sea, a coast guard launch

pulls to 100 yards off the beach. Its searchlight plays on

the water's edge then across the property. Molly look; at

all the policemen...

65.

EXT. AIRPORT - GULF STREAM JET - DAY

advances on us, its engine screaming. Its front wheel brakes

to a stop right before CAMERA.

DOOR

opens. Running down the stairs and across the tarmac is

Will Graham in shirtsleeves with a Car-15 assault rifle with

collapsible stock. His eyes scan the perimeter.

FBI MEN

moving fast, follow Graham. Their eyes sweep the terminal area.

One carries an Uzi submachine gun, the other two, handguns.

A CORDON OF FLORIDA STATE TROOPERS

hussle Molly and Kevin between them from their cars towards

Graham. Two carry suitcases.

GRAHAM + MOLLY + KEVIN

inside the protective barrier of men.

HIGH ANGLE: THE AIRPORT

Graham moves Molly and Kevin up into the Gulf Stream. FBI

men follow. The troopers back off. The flashers on their

cars are still turning. PAN RIGHT with the Gulf Stream as

it taxis to the head of the runway. It pauses a moment, then

blasts down the runway and up into the morning sun.

INT. BALTIMORE SAFE HOUSE, FOYER - DOOR - DAY

HOLD. Then it opens. Molly and Kevin, followed by Graham.

Unmarked FBI cars are parked on the front lawn. Molly enters

the foyer, looks around and stops.

HOUSE INTERIOR

Holiday Inn decor.

Molly takes a deep breath. Then lets it out. She's tired.

Graham takes her hand.

66.

She didn't check to see that Kevin is our of earshot.

Graham does.

INT. SUPERMARKET - GRAHAM + KEVIN - DAY

push a basket collecting stuff from the shelves. Other

families are shopping The place is medium-crowded. Mind-

dulling MUZAK comes from the ceiling.

67.

Is there anything I need to know to

see about Mom?

No. You're very well-protected.

No one can find our where you are.

Barry's mom had this newspaper. It

said you killed the guy in

Minnesota and were in a mental

hospital. Is it true?

Yes .

I figured I'd ask you...

I was in the psychiatric wing. It

bothers you,  finding out I was in

there... doesn't it?

I told my dad before he died, I'd

take care of Mom. And I'll do it.

This guy wants to kill you?

We don't know that.

Are you gonna kill him?

No. It's just my job to find him.

I was in the hospital after Garrett

Jacob Hobbs.

How did it happen?

Hobbs was insane. He was attacking

college girls and he killed them.

How?

With a knife.

68.

We get the feeling Graham is leaving out lots of pieces and

gives Kevin only the bare bones of what he needs to know.

69.

Kevin pauses, then asks with 11-year-old innocence:

EXTREMELY CLOSE: GRAHAM

turns and stares at Kevin:

Kevin thinks about this for a long time. He nods. He feels

he understands Graham and is closer to him for it:

Kevin reaches for the coffee and puts it in the basket.

REAR SHOT: KEVIN + GRAHAM

walk down the aisle. Graham puts his hand over Kevin's

shoulder. They look like father and son. As they disappear

around a corner...

EXT. BALTIMORE SAFE HOUSE, BACKYARD - REAR SHOT: GRAHAM +

MOLLY - NIGHT

Beyond is Chesapeake Bay and the nightlights of Baltimore

reflecting across it. The swimming float bobs in the

distance. One yellow light is on it.

FRONTAL: MOLLY + GRAHAM.

The grass looks cold in the moonlight. Holly wears a heavy

cardigan.

70.

Behind them -- with yellow lights -- the house looks like

a motel.

When she said this she was staring out to sea. Now she turns

to look at Graham and puts a hand on his arm. He still stares

out to sea:

Then Graham looks at her and covers her hand with his own.

Molly stares into his eyes.

They stare into each other. There's a pause. They rise.

She puts her arm around Graham's waist. They start towards

the house.

INT. FBI CAFETERIA - CRAWFORD + BLOOM - DAY

71.

What about him?

I need to ask you questions of a

psychological nature.

Remember when you asked for a

study on him, I refused. Same

goes for now.

That was Peterson upstairs.

It was you who did the asking.

He doesn't think you run mind games

on him.

I wouldn't presume to try.

You're never alone in a room with

Graham, are you? You're smooth

about it, but you're never one-on-

one with him. Why's that? Do you

think he's psychic?

He's an eideteker. He has almost

total recall.   But I don't think

he's psychic.   What he has it empathy

and projection  He can assume your

point of view and mine.., and some

other points of view that scare and

sicken him.

Why aren't you ever alone with him?

Because I'm professionally

concerned about him. And he'd

pick up on that. He's fast. He

hates being prodded and poked.

So do I.

What do you want?

His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs.

Could he kill again if he had to save

his life? Or would he hesitate?

72.

Crawford is surprised at Graham's entry. Bloom isn't.

73.

Crawford's embarrassed. Bloom said Graham was fast.

Now Bloom's surprised...

INT. WASHINGTON APARTMENT - GRAHAM + LOUNDS - DAY

Graham leans against a table, his back to a window.

PULL BACK to reveal Bloom, Crawford, a photographer and

assistant. Graham motions for Lounds to turn off his

tape recorder.

Graham motions Lounds to turn the tape recorder on again.

74.

Crawford stifles a laugh...

Graham gestures for Lounds to turn off the tape recorder.

Graham reacts.

STILL PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV THROUGH CAMERA: GRAHAM + LOUNDS

Lounds lays Graham's arm over his own shoulder and mugs :or

the camera. Behind him is the flood-lit Capitol dome and

the sign of a motel across the street.

Lounds barks orders to the still photographer and splits.

The photographer starts breaking down his gear. Crawford

takes Graham aside.

75.

EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. PARKING LOT - GRAHAM, CRAWFORD + SPURGEN

SPURGEN, chief SWAT instructor from Quantico, examines the

parking lot. We've cut in mid-dialogue.

Spurgen hands Graham a glycine envelope containing 25 rounds

of .44 Special ammunition.

GRAHAM EXAMINES ONE ROUND

Instead of a lead bullet, there's a matte-black, blunt-nosed

cylinder .

76.

As they start across the parking lot:

INT. LAMBERT ST. LOUIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - FLOOR

DAY

We've been here before. The floor is empty. In the WIDE

ANGLE -- OUT OF FOCUS -- the NEWSSTAND OPERATOR is squatted

down reading the "Chicago Tribune." In the empty space is

dumped a bundle of "Tattlers" A pair of black zippered boots

enters and stands behind the man.

One black boot kicks the "Tattler" bundle.

77.

A hand and a flash of bright steel rip through the FRAME.

The wire is cut with a POP. A dollar bill is thrown on

the floor. The hand whips a "Tattler" out from the center of

the bundle. RAISE UP WITH the outraged Newsstand Operator.

The retreating man turns to face him. It is Francis

Dollarhyde.

He starts coming back. He rakes off his silver sunglasses

revealing the white violet eyes.

CLOSE: NEWSSTAND OPERATOR

EXT. WASHINGTON APARTMENT, PARKING LOT - GRAHAM'S CAR -

NIGHT

pulls into the prescribed space. It's raining. He kills the

engine and gets out.

HIGH ANGLE: GRAHAM

exiting the car. The image is in GREEN AND BLACK. We are:

EXT. ROOFTOP - SWAT #1

behind the balustrade in a prone firing position sighting

through a heavy-barrelled Heckler and Koch Model 93 with a

Startron scope.

78.

A SECOND HIGH ANGLE: GRAHAM

also in GREEN AND BLACK. Reveal we are:

EXT. SECOND ROOFTOP - SWAT #2

with the same rifle sweeping the parking lot. He reacts to

something to his left.

GRAHAM

... walking along the determined line, fifty yards from the

apartment building.., hears something through the delicate

patter of the rain.

GRAHAM'S POV: CORNER OF BUILDING

A distant "plop-plop-plop" of running feet...

GRAHAM'S

eyes tighten.

CORNER OF BUILDING

HOLD. Then entering around the corner is a running MAN.

He's 6'2". He's heavy and wears a running suit with the

hood up. His face is lost in its shadow.

RUNNER'S RIGHT HAND

is gloved and slips into the pocket of his jacket, grasping

something...

RUNNER'S FEET ACROSS WET BLACK TARMAC

splash through shallow puddles.

GRAHAM'S FACE

in anticipation. The foot beats are getting LOUDER...

GBAHAM'S EYES

like taut wire about to snap.

79.

WIDE PROFILE:  GRAHAM

on the left.   The Runner enters on the right. In SLOW MOTION

as they cross, Graham slams him sideways...

RUNNER

is knocked off balance and slams face forward into the side

of a car. He comes off the car violently, to turn, to

fight ...

.44 BULLDOG

comes up.., pressure on the trigger.

RUNNER'S HEAD

turns INTO CAMERA. He is a black man with a moustache and

scared eyes staring into the .44. His hands shoot into the

air:

Walking away, Graham rips off his jacket: and the Kevlar vest.

Coming off the expectation of contact, Graham is explosive.

The Runner looks at Graham as if he's crazy: Spurgen and two

D.C. cops are running in.

Crawford catches up to Graham:

Graham shoulders past Crawford He throws the Kevlar vest

across the parking lot. He almost killed the man. Meanwhile,

Spurgen is with the Runner.

Runner pissed off -- starts towards Graham. Spurgen stops

him.

80.

HUGE LAUGHTER which is coming from...

INT. "TATTLER" GARAGE - ELEVATOR DOOR - NIGHT

slides open. Lounds and TWO SECRETARIES are cracking up.

He apparently told them the funniest joke they ever heard.

LOUNDS

pleased with himself, walks to his car.

REAR: LOUNDS' HEAD

enters FRAME, unlocking his car door. A hand falls on

Lounds' shoulder and turns him INTO CAMERA: Lounds' self-

satisfied smile still beams. A chloroformed rag jams

into his face. A massive hand holds his head and neck

steady and is nor bothered by his struggles.

INT. DOLLARHYDE HOUSE (ST. LOUIS) - LOUNDS - NIGHT

is unconscious. A hand puts ammonia under his nose.

Lounds regains consciousness. He tries to move. He can't.

There are sanitary napkins covering Lounds' eyes and mouth.

The one on his mouth is removed. We will see ONLY Lounds.

81.

Footsteps are going away.

Lounds reacts.

82.

A kettle WHISTLES.

As if he had any choice. Lounds' face moves; He strains.

His arms are glued to the chair. Dollarhyde's hand comes

back with a cup of tea and a straw. Lounds sips.

The hand rips off the sanitary napkins covering Lounds' eyes.

Lounds jams his eyes shut. The lights brighten. A single

finger taps the top of his head.

A finger taps Lounds on his chest. A touch on his eyelids.

Lounds slowly opens his eyes. His face goes white.

LOUNDS' POV: THE RED DRAGON

Dollarhyde opens and drops the black silk kimono.

83.

His muscular frame bears the full body tattoo of William

Blake's Red Dragon -- the head on Dollarhyde's chest, the

tail snaking down and wrapping around one of Dollarhyde's

legs. His back is to us in a weight-lifter's pose. A

rolled-up stocking covers Dollarhyde's head to just below

his nose. Dollarhyde's teeth are jagged and brown-stained.

And he smiles at Lounds in front of the white screen.

LOUNDS

turns away. The shape of Dollarhyde passes behind his head.

The kimono is on again.

PAST LOUNDS' HEAD: SCREEN

A slide appears. It is Blake's painting.

Next picture: Mrs. Jacobi, eyes wide.

CLICK. Next slide. Mrs. Leeds alive, locked into a silent

scream in her bedroom.

CLICK.

LOUNDS

staring in horror. We will not see the rest of the slider.

84.

REAR OF DOLLARHYDE'S HEAD

Beyond him is the screen and the image of Freddie Lounds with

Graham's arm over his shoulder.

85.

Dollarhyde leaves. Lounds closes his eyes.

DOLLARHME'S HAND

carries a tape recorder. We PAN it across the room to Lounds'

face .

Lounds obeys.

CLOSE: DOLLARHYDE

The stocking mask and teeth -- stained and jagged -- are in

place.

ON LOUNDS

86.

DOLLARHYDE'S HAND

turns off the tape recorder.

DOLLARHYDE

DOLLARHYDE'S FACE,

with the stocking rolled down over his nose, smiles his

dentured smile. And with his kimono open, revealing the

face of the dragon emblazoned in crimson on his muscular

torso; he leans INTO CAMERA...

VERY WIDE ANGLE

The figures seen from the back. We don't know what Dollar-

hyde, leaning over Lounds, is doing, but Lounds screams.

EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - WIDE SHOT - NIGHT

Dollarhyde's van is on the left against the wall. The alley

is empty. Then we see shapes between the van and the wall.

CLOSER: OVER LOUNDS' RIGHT SHOULDER

We do not see his face. We see his shoulder and his lap.

From an unseen facial wound, blood drips onto his pants' leg.

Dollarhyde starts spilling liquid on Lounds. Lounds starts

to moan and rouse from unconsciousness. His head starts to

turn. He knows he's going to die. And he has some courage.

87.

INT. "TATTLER" GARAGE - OVER PARKING ATTENDANT'S RIGHT

SHOULDER ON THE RACING FORM - NIGHT

He pencils some selections. START TRACKING LEFT ACROSS

the back of his neck. Midway we hear the SQUEAK of a wheel-

chair. The parking attendant hears it, too. As the TRACK

CONTINUES OVER his left shoulder he puts down the Racing

form and looks. Nothing. Then he goes back to the Racing

Form.

PARKING ATTENDANT

reads. Now the wheels SQUEAK and ECHO LOUDER. His head

raises again...

OVER PARKING ATTENDANT'S LEFT SHOULDER

He turns INTO CAMERA. There's a loud WOOSH. His eyes go

wide. He explodes out of his chair, SCREAMING.

WHAT HE SEES: LOUNDS IN WHEELCHAIR - A MAN AFLAME

Lounds is a fireball racing TOWARDS US. Just before the

fireball would smash into CAMERA...

INT. BALTIMORE SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - GRAHAM + MOLLY - NIGHT

Graham and Molly are sitting at the kitchen table over cups

of coffee. It's dark. Graham is looking down into the Formica.

He and Molly say nothing for a long time. Then:

Graham gives her one. Molly lights up. She picks a piece or

tobacco from her lips. She's trying to control fear.

88.

There is a long pause. Molly suspects:

Graham says nothing.

She can't finish. There's a pause. Then: She looks at him.

89.

He shakes his head and locks away from her, wondering about

himself:

They are both frozen: in the same room but very separate.

Molly's eyes are moist. She gets up and leaves. Graham

sits at the kitchen table by himself, both hands around

his mug of coffee. Slowly, deliberately, he picks up the

mug to take a sip. Then he sits alone in the kitchen.

INT. BALTIMORE AIRPORT - GRAHAM - DAY

On a pay phone to Dr. Bloom.

90.

Sidney Bloom has no answer.

INT. BALTIMORE AIRPORT, COFFEE SHOP - WINDOW - LATE

AFTERNOON

Outside is gray. Rain stripes the glass. Sheets of rain

whip across the silver planes and yellow utility vehicles.

CLOSE: WINDOW

Graham's hand enters and flattens against his half-reflection

on the cool glass. He hears:

Graham turns. The WAITRESS looks at him strangely.

She leaves. Graham sits. He stares at his handprint and

says :

91.

INT. DARKROOM - DOLLABHYDE - NIGHT

Entering. It is almost totally dark. In the green dullness

we make our the forms of a WOMAN and Dollarhyde.

Put your back against the doer.

We see Dollarhyde's form follow instructions and sit.

Can you give me an idea of the

We see some movements. Then the light comes on.

DOLLARHYDE'S

hand is curled under his nose, hiding his Z-plast scars.

Then he reacts to something. His face lights up in an

uncharacteristically open smile.

92.

He brazenly looks the woman up and down. We don't understand

why he can do this.

REBA McCLAIN

is blind. Her white cane is propped in the corner. She's

thirty with a handsome prairie face.

RALPH DANDRIDGE,

young manager of the department enters, checks watch.

Dandridge leaves. Dollarhyde stares after him. He doesn't

Like him. Then:

Reba walks our of the dark room.

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S VAN, TRAVELLING - OUT OF WINDOW - NIGHT

We pass Reba on the sidewalk. She is walking briskly with

her cane and tapping in front of her. She's very confident.

93.

DOLLARHYDE

Reba stops. She likes Dollarhyde's directness. He gets our

and comes around to help her in. He starts to take her arm.

INT. REBA'S DUPLEX - DOOR - NIGHT

We hear footsteps come up. Reba's key is in the lock.

As the door is starting to open:

INT. REBA'S DUPLEX, KITCHEN - REBA

enters. She momentarily forgets, retraces her steps and

turns on the light. She opens the refrigerator. During

the next pieces of dialogue, we will see Reba being ex-

tremely competent making the drinks.

Reba takes a l0-inch chef's knife and deftly cuts the lime,

guiding it with her thumb.

94.

DOLLARHYDE

reacts to "speech therapy." Characteristically -- his

attention goes to:

KNIFE

in Reba's hand. Its extremely sharp cutting edge glints

in the light. Another slice of lime falls.

Silence. Reba hands him his drink.

Dollarhyde is stunned, at both her perception and frankness.

There's a smile on her face. Now her hand moves up towards

Dollarhyde's mouth with the Z-plast scars where his harelip

and cleft palate were fixed.

REBA' S HAND

Dollarhyde's fist grabs it.

DOLLARHYDE

turns her hand in the light.

95.

There is no smile on Dollarhyde's face.

He still has her hand in his grasp.

He lets go of her hand.

INT. BIRMINGHAM STORAGE ROOM - WILL GRAHAM - DAY

sits among piles of Leeds family possessions. He opens a

child's toy. It's large, pink plastic and heart-shaped.

It's a Mexican fantasy house with puffy white plastic

clouds, strange handles and doors with eyes in them,

REARSHOT: GRAHAM

half and half out of a shaft of yellow light that radiates

motes of dust in the air. Graham merely sits and stares

into all of the debris of this dead family. PULL BACK to

see the vast expanse of the room which is a total disarray

of all the furniture, all the possessions and papers, all

the bits and pieces of matter, that are accumulated in a

life by two adults and three children. Everything from

washing machines to tricycles to sleds. They litter the

vast floor space. While we WIDEN, we hear:

The CAMERA now includes two UNIFORMED SECURITY GUARDS at

the door. They watch Graham, As we WIDEN and PULL BACK

they fall into REAR SHOT. HOLD.

INT. WHITE CORRIDOR - REBA ON DOLLARHYDE'S ARM - NIGHT

Her cane taps the white tile floor. It's antiseptic and

sinister. We worry about where he's taking her.

96.

Her head arcs back as she senses:

INT. ZOO EXAMINATIONTION ROOM - DR. WARFIELD - NIGHT

Dollarhyde reacts with a light smile at the compliment.

We see Reba start to reach out. Then we see what she is about

to touch.

TEN-FOOT LONG BENGAL TIGER

Reba's hand feels the fur slide across her palm.

REBA'S HAND

The fur springs between her fingers.

97.

TIGER'S GREAT PAW

Reba's hand enters down its foreleg. Warfield -- with two

hands -- lifts the great paw and puts it in her hand. Reba's

hand feels the roughness of the pads. She presses and the

claw slides cut. Both her hands go up his leg to the heavy

supple muscles of his shoulder.

TIGER'S HEAD

Reba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands

feel the width of his head.

TIGER'S MOUTH

The hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the

hairs on her forearms.

TIGER'S CHEST

Reba's arms wrap around the huge chest. Slowly her face

lowers and she puts her ear next to the tiger's ribs. Reba's

ecstatic. We hear what she hears: the HEARTBEAT. It fills

us and Reba with its bright thunder.

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S HOUSE - THE GREAT RED DRAGON ARD THE WOMAN

CLOTHED WITH THE SUN - NIGHT

Blake's painting. It's a large reproduction. It's a pre-

psychological evocation of violent sexual impulses. It has

come right after the image of Reba and the tiger. O.S. we

hear WATER RUNNING...

INT. BATHROOM - FAUCET + HANDS

Hands are Reba's. We FOLLOW them up to the wall as they

search for and find a towel. O.S. we hear the hum of a

film PROJECTOR starring. We see the sightless Reba reflected

in the mirror. Feeling her way, she starts out...

INT. LIVING BOOM - PAN

It's dark brown with wing-armed 50's-futuristic furniture. A

Sryrosphere casts scars and constellations throughout the room.

A full-sized mural from JPL of the Mars surface is on one wall.

98.

We MOVE-PAST objects: a recliner lounger, two film projectors,

a black and white fifties clock with golf bails in the arrow

arms, a Magnavox console TV set and a sofa with Dollarhyde and

Reba on it. They're watching a movie.

CLOSER: DOLLARHYDE AND REBA

The film projector hums. We don't see what movie Dollarhyde

is watching.

Dollarhyde looks at Reba. Then he looks at the film. The

two of them are like a tableau of suburban TV-watching.

They're like a married couple sitting on the sofa. Except:

REAR SHOT OVER DOLLARHYDE + REBA TO THE SCBEEN

The movie is Mrs. Jacobi looking up, And Mrs. Leeds looking

up. And Mrs. Sherman's legs scissoring in the water. Then

her breasts swelling and shining above her suit as she pushes

herself our of the pool. Dollarhyde's blase, watching his

horror show. He looks at Reba.

REBA

unknowing, is suffused with a calm equanimity. Her breasts

rise and fall with her breathing. The flickering light from

the screen intermittently illuminates and darkens the planes

of her face.

EXTREMELY CLOSE: REBA'S NECK

The smooth skin and down-like hairs undulate from the bearing

of her living heart.

DOLLARHYDE

is watching her pulse rise and fall under the soft skin and

doesn't see:

99.

REBA'S HAND

moves along the back of the sofa to Dollarhyde.

REBA

moves towards Dollarhyde's face.

ON DOLLARHYDE, AND REBA

ENTERS THE FRAME and kisses Dollarhyde on the mouth.

Dollarhyde's eyes freeze open. He is stunned. Reba's left

hand opens Dollarhyde's shirt and slides down his' chest towards

his pants...

head on the satin comforter. His eyes are wide open... His

reaction to this event is immobility and shock.

Reba's hand with her long, gentle fingers ENTERS THE FRAME

caressing the side of Dollarhyde's face. We will hear Reba's

voice and see little of her. We will see Dollarhyde's face

and the expressions on it: wonder and amazement.

Her hand moves down from his face down his neck and rests on

his chest. It rests on the face of what is tattooed there:

the Great Red Dragon.

Dollarhyde knows what he feels: he is pole-axed. He doesn't

know what he thinks.

SAME - REBA - LATER

is asleep. She holds Dollarhyde in the near dark. His hand

caresses her forehead and brushes light brown hair from her

face .

DOLLARHME

wide awake, eases her away. Then he puts his ear to her

breast and listens to her heart beating. Dollarhyde is re-

lieved. Then Dollarhyde touches her gently, softly in wonder

and amazement. Then Dollarhyde leaves...

REBA

Dollarhyde re-enters FRAME and puts a glass of water next to

her. He covers her. He lays down again next to her. Reba

stirs half awake, murmurs dreamily. Dollarhyde supports the

back of her head and offers her some water.

OVERHEAD ANGLE: DOLLARHYDE + REBA

Dollarhyde's arm moves under her pillow. She snuggles closer

to him. Dollarhyde's eyes are moist.  Reba's hand moves up

his stomach and rests on his chest.   It rests above his heart.

It rests on the face of the crimson dragon. When she is asleep

again, Dollarhyde takes her hand off the great tattoo and puts

it on his face.

Dollarhyde -- cloven in two, accepted by a living Reba -- will

not sleep for a very long time.

SAME - DOLLARHYDE - DAY

It is morning. He snaps awake. he is horror-struck: Reba's

pillow is empty. She's nor there. Dollarhyde races our of

the room.

EXT. DOLLARHYDE HOUSE, BACKYARD - DOOR - DAY

slams open. Dollarhyde stops in the door frame.

101.

REBA

In her cotton dress. The prairie wind blows her hair and

presses the thin cotton against her body in the overgrown

weeds and wildflowers of Dollarhyde's backyard.

DOLLARHYDE

nears her, towers above her. He touches her face. Reba folds

into his arms and lays her head on his hard chest. His heart

is going fast. He doesn't believe this fine thing is happen-

ing to him and that she's okay.

EXT. SERVICE STATION - ATTENDANT - DAY

He's heavy-set and sullen. Dollarhyde's van, with Reba, pulls

in.

102.

Dollarhyde gets out.

Dollarhyde crosses to the men's room. After placing the

nozzle in the gas tank the ATTENDANT bangs open the hood,

draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout

into the can and sticks the spout into the engine. As he

starts to move around the van he sees something in the

interior and stops. A smile dawns on his face. We don't

know what he sees. He starts wiping the windshield. He

wipes and wipes the same spot.

REBA'S

dress is just above her knees. She sits on the high seat.

Her legs are crossed. Her white cane lays between the seats.

From his lower angle at the van window the Attendant can

look up her dress. He bends down a little to see better...

MEN'S ROOM DOOR

Nothing. Then Dollarhyde ENTERS. He crumples a paper rowel

and throws it in the basket. Dollarhyde crosses around the

backside of the van.

DRIVER'S WINDOW

Dollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on

the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing...

ATTENDANT

unaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same

spot in front of Reba.

DOLLARHYDE

is coming around the van. Fast.

103.

Attendant starts away. Dollarhyde catches him and shoves him

into and through a display of STP. The Attendant bounces once

and slams into the station wall. CANS CRASH and roll away...

Dollarhyde does know what he can do about it.

REBA'S FACE

through the windshield. She's trying to find the handle to

roll down the window.

ATTENDANT

is white. There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has

never seen before, anywhere.

DOLLARHYDE

pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He

advances on the frozen Attendant. He looks at the sharp end

of the spout.

ATTENDANT

is wide-eyed. Dollarhyde's big hand ENTERS and flattens the

man into the wall, compressing his thorax.

The Attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk.

Dollarhyde's hand has grabbed his face. He hesitates. Then

he throws money at the Attendant and leaves...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM - NIGHT

With Crawford on the phone.

104.

Graham hangs up the phone. He looks out the window at the

rain. He dials again.

105.

Graham hangs up. He dials again.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.

LECKTOR'S CELL - HANNIBAL LECKTOR - DAY

picks up the phone and takes Graham's call.

106.

Graham laughs. Then he starts to listen closely. There is

something here for him:

Will Graham thinks about this.

107.

Lecktor's voice fades as Will Graham hangs us on him. Graham

sits on the crumpled bed and stares out the window at the rain..

INT. LEEDS HOUSE - GRAHAM - DAY

stands in the kitchen. His raincoat and rainhat drip water

onto the floor. The house no longer is a crime scene. It's

been cleaned up. It is absolutely naked. Shades are drawn.

Slashes of light hit the floor. Graham stands there. Then

he walks forward...

STAIRCASE - GRAHAM'S FEET UP TIIE STAIRS

The toys appear on the stairs as Graham's feet continue

moving up the stairs to the second-floor landing.

GRAHAM'S POV: APPROACHING LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM DOOR

INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM: THE DOOR

It opens. Graham enters.   The room is white. We don't see

the bed. Graham stands there in profile. Beyond Graham OUT

OF FOCUS the wall starts to discolor. Pieces of plaster

start to fall. The room starts to disintegrate around Graham.

We will see what Graham sees in his mind.

GRAHAM'S POV: THE BED

The ceiling and walls decomposing. Nothing falls on the bed.

Mr. Charles Leeds sleeps with his arm under Mrs. Leeds' pillow.

108.

Mrs. Leeds is on her side. Slowly she starts to rise. She

sees the figure in front of her and her mouth opens to scream.

A silent shot shoves her back to the headboard. Red blood

starts to stain her nightgown as she holds the wound. We

FLOAT CLOSER. In SLOW MOTION Mr. Leeds starts to rise.

Something massive and silver flashes through the FRAME. He Is

gone. Mirrors explode. Mrs. Leeds was looking at her hand

covered with blood. Now Mrs. Leeds looks up at us. Her face

turns into a smile. Her eyes are silver. A silver light

emanates from her mouth. She smiles at us. She wants us. She

really wants us. Her hand gestures us closer. As we MOVE

CLOSER we hear:

In the silver mirrors of her eyes, Graham sees reflected

there: himself.

INT. LEEDS LIVING ROOM - WIDE

It is empty. The bare floorboards, a dynamic perspective of

lines, go nowhere. O.S. Graham's scream reverberates in the

empty house.

INT. GATEWAY LABS, MAIN DARKROOM- WIDE FROM THE CEILING

DAY

It is pitch-black. In the green safe light we make our the

rollers and pulleys carrying film through the vats of D76

developer and fixer. It is mechanized. There is no one

to maintain it. Distantly on the floor in a far corner we

perceive the shape of a man and reddish glow. The CAMERA

STARTS MOVING towards the shape on the floor. As we get

closer we realize it's Dollarhyde. Something is wrong with

him. ..

109.

By now we're close to his body curled up on the floor in the

sanctuary of the developing room. The red glow emanates

from beneath Dollarhyde's shirt.

He stands.

He starts throwing bottles of chemicals across the room.

They form a moire pattern of colors on walls. Some splash

on him and make his shirt smoke.

PHONE

Dollarhyde's unsteady hand takes it off the wall. Be pours

sweat. If the acid that makes his shirt smoke burns him,

he doesn't acknowledge it. He punches four numbers.

110.

EXT. REBA'S HOUSE - SLOW TRACK PAST DOLLARHYDE'S VAN -

NIGHT

He sits under the tree with the lights out. He is waiting.

Watching. He looks at his watch. Then he hears a car

approach and looks up.

DOLLARHYDE'S POV: GREEN OLDSMOBILE

pulls into Reba's drive.

INT. VAN - DOLLARHME'S FACE

Excited. He starts to get out. Now he stops.

DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + RALPH DANDRIDGE

exit the Oldsmobile. He helps Reba out of the car. She

makes her own way up the sidewalk to her door. Reba opens

her door with a key. She turns towards Dandridge.

He brushes at a speck of dust on Reba's cheek.

111.

INT. VAN - DOLLARHYDE

stares. Events are threatening Dollarhyde's fragile stabil-

ity. We don't want this to be happening, we don't want

Dandridge to touch her...

DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + DANDRIDGE

We see what Dollarhyde imagines: Dandridge's fingers caress

the soft skin of Reba's face. Reba's expression and mouth

are open and warm to him.

INT. VAN - DOLLARHYDE'S FACE

Blank .

DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + DOLLARHYDE

Reba smiles. Her lips part. His finger brushes between her

lips... His hand goes to her breast...

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S VAN - DOLLARHYDE'S

hand clutches the dash.

PADDED DASH

His fingers pop through the vinyl, gouging deep furrows. We

hear hyperventilating.

EXT. REBA'S HOUSE - REBA + DANDRIDGE

Normal reality. There was no, there is no seduction. No

contact.

Reba walks into her apartment

112.

RALPH DANDRIDGE

walks back to his car. We are TRACKING WITH Dandridge walk-

ing past the hedges. An arm shoots out and turns Dandridge.

Dollarhyde's hand clutches the whole of Dandridge's lower

face from underneath his jaw. He starts crushing Dandridge's

face. THREE soft POPS are from Dollarhyde's nine millimeter.

He shot Dandridge three times in the heart.

INT. REBA'S DUPLEX - REBA - NIGHT

Moving in the dark. The DOORBELL RINGS. She has unbuttoned

her blouse. Now she goes back to answer the door.

She opens the door and smiles.

As he steps towards her...

THE MOON

It's full and very large as it dawns over black water that

seems to ripple and be drawn to it. PULL BACK to reveal

we are:

INT. CHICAGO FBI OFFICE - WINDOW + NIGHT SKY - NIGHT

Next to the window we see the Jacobi family in fishing

scene on a monitor. They are on a pier into a small lake

with poles and bobbers. The kids turn back and wave AT us.

113.

The scene changes to a birthday party. The Jacobis are

sitting around a dining table. They are singing.

GRAHAM + CRAWFORD

Graham is intent on the tape. Then:

114.

Graham's beyond frustration.

Graham doesn't answer. He's totally concentrated on the

film.

TV MONITOR: JACOBI FAMILY

Donald Jacobi, big birthday card to the camera. It says:

"Happy Birthday - Follow the ribbon." Camera follows Donald

Jacobi following the ribbon into the basement and the flood-

lights reveal a ten-speed bicycle.

Crawford stares at him. Then he works his way through a

report with a penlight.

115.

TV MONITOR: JACOBI FAMILY

We are outside in the rain. Donald Jacobi brings the bicycle

out. The camera pans past: the padlock on the basement door.

Graham's hand flashes INTO FRAME and slams on the freeze

button.

Graham rifles through the files and comes up with the autopsy

report on Donald Jacobi.

He freezes the Jacobi tape and loads and plays the Leeds

tape :

116.

MONITOR: LEEDS TAPE

The Leeds' gray Scottie perks up his ears and runs in the

glass kitchen door. The camera pans off the dog to Valerie

Leeds coming in the door: behind her the door is vulnerable

with its big glass pane. Her kids follow her through the

door...

Crawford's surprised.

EXTREMELY CLOSE: GRAHAM

Watching. Then he grabs the phone and punches numbers.

He hangs up on Metcalfe.

VTR MONITORS

Graham's hand freezes the Leeds' rape and plays the Jacobi

tape. The Jacobis' cat moves, jumps on the table.

117.

The Jacobi boy pushes the bicycle out of the basement door

with the padlock.

Next Mrs. 3acobi -- warm, smiling -- watches Donald ride

the bike. Now Graham plays the Leeds' tape, too. The dog

runs to camera...

His tail wagging, his tongue out; he's a friendly dog. Mrs.

Leeds enters and pets him.

Crawford is staring at Graham strangely. This is why

Crawford drafted him. But Crawford doesn't look like he

wants to be alone in the same room with Graham anymore...

The PHONE RINGS. Crawford answers. His attention is riveted

on Graham.

118.

Crawford is very quiet.

Graham pushes aside the videotape sleeve and picks up the

Leeds' home-movie can.

Crawford hears. Then he deflates.

Crawford hears, Graham's watching him.

119.

Graham's already out the door. Crawford races after him.

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - REBA - NIGHT

has been placed on the kitchen table. It is chrome and

pale yellow Formica. Her face is bruised and swollen from

where Dollarhyde hit her. She feels, around on the bed.

She's very frightened. She's trying to control herself...

There's no answer. We don't know if there's anyone else in

the room.

Reba shakes her head.

In a flash Dollarhyde grips her mouth, shutting off the

sound.

120.

His arm exits FRAME.

Reba's hand is gripped by Dollarhyde's. He brings her

fingers up to his face. For the first time in this scene

we are seeing Dollarhyde's face. The fanged dentures are

in his mouth. Dollarhyde makes Reba's hand feel his teeth.

O.S., we hear Reba start whimpering and try to pull away.

Dollarhyde holds her hand there.

INT. GULF STREAM - ELECTRICIAN - NIGHT

finishes patching together cables.

121.

Meanwhile Graham has grabbed the second radio phone.

INT. ST. LOUIS PD OFFICE - LT. FISK - NIGHT

on telephone. Two FBI men are at his desk. Uniformed

patrolmen carrying assault rifles and body armor run

through in the background.

Fisk punches Graham into the speaker phone.

One of the uniformed cops is already punching it into a

computer terminal. Lt. Fisk looks at the monitor...

122.

INT. GULF STREAM - GRAHAM - NIGHT

EXT. SKY - AERIAL SHOT - GULF STREAM - NIGHT

The Gulf Stream approaches and races past us at its cruising

speed of 585 mph. As it leaves the frame, the image we're

left with is the moon. It looms large and white 30 degrees

above the horizon and rising into a starry sky,

INT. ST. LOUIS PD OFFICE - COMPUTER MONITOR - NIGHT

displays the license with picture and driving record of

Dillon, Lincoln. He's a black man.

INT. GULF STREAM FLIGHT DECK - OVER PILOT'S SHOULDERS:

-NIGHT

St. Louis approaches. The flashing strobes of the airport

runway indicator, the cobalt blue runway lights.

INT. GULF STREAM CABIN - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - NIGHT

Crawford buckles up. Graham is hearing.

123.

DATAFAX

starts printing our line by line: a blow-up of a driver's

license with picture. The lines compose hair, forehead,

eyes... coming at us line by line is: Francis Dollarhyde.

Lt. Fisk)

INT. ST. LOUIS AIRPORT - GULF STREAM - NIGHT

Hits the runway. Tires smoke. Its ENGINES SCREAM in

reverse thrust. It taxis away from the terminal to a

security area. Two St. Louis PD squad cars are waiting.

GULF STREAM DOOR

opens. Graham's out followed by Crawford. They run across

the tarmac to the squad cars. Squad cars race out of the

airport.

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S KITCHEN - PANNING - NIGHT

through shadows and highlights in the moonlight. we pass the

sink and countertop and refrigerator and blue-enamelled broom

closet. On the other side of it is Reba. She Is breathing

heavily.

124.

She stands there, squeezing into the corner, trying to make

herself disappear. Then she senses and freezes as a rabbit

who is hunted and at a certain point, freezes...

DOLLARHYDE

stands four feet from her, just staring. Then he walks

from the room.

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S LIVING ROOM - DOLLARHYDE

puts "INNAGADDADAVIDA" by Iron Butterfly from 1967 on the

stereo. It BLASTS through the house. He is expressionless.

Deep in his psychotic episode, his affect is flattened.

INT. DOLLARHYDE BATHROOM - DOLLARHYDE

as a reflection in the medicine cabinet - enters. His fist

smashes. His image SHATTERS with the mirrored glass.

DOLLARHYDE'S

forearm destroys the glass shower door. He rips the metal

frame from the walls. He snaps the mitred framework. The

aluminum frame members have sharp 45 degree points. He

takes them and the shards of mirror and leaves for the

kitchen... Throughout his face has been expressionless.

EXT. MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY 94 - TWO CAR CARAVAN - NIGHT

streaks TOWARDS US down the almost deserted highway.

INT. CAR - GRAHAM - NIGHT

in the back seat. He is distant. His attitude contrasts to

the frantic 110 mph race down the highway and the two uniformed

officers and Crawford. Their anxiety is visible. Next

to them Graham seems zoned-our...

125.

He obeys Graham and floors it. Graham puts his black plastic

briefcase on his lap and extracts the .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.

He starts to load 6 matte-black, blunt-nosed Glaser Safety

Slugs. He fumbles them in the swaying car. The bullets

fall to the floor.

CAR FLOOR

Glaser Safety Slugs roll on the rubber matting. Graham's

fingers enter and pick them up. We FOLLOW the rounds as

they slip into the cylinder.

CRAWFORD

is staring at Graham's blankness.

THEIR POV: DOLLARHYDE'S PROPERTY

The house is set back a half mile from the road. Access to

the drive is blocked by a locked cattle gate.

DOLLARHYDE FARM + ROAD - TWO SQUAD OARS - NIGHT

The first drives off the highway through a shallow ditch and

starts across the soybean field. The second car takes the

ditch at the wrong angle and CRASHES. its windshield stars.

126.

SOYBEAN FIELD + ST. LOUIS PD CAR NUMBER 1

moving across the furrowed rows. The car starts to slow.

We don't know why they are slowing down.

TIRES

spray the gumbo mud out of the furrows. The forward momentum

of the car slows until it completely stops. The tires spin

and dig in.

GRAHAM

spills out and starts running for the house and the orchard

a quarter mile away. Crawford follows.

EXT. DOLLARHYDE ORCHARD - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD

running towards the house through the trees. Branches

slap at them. Ahead, the orchard will parallel the house.

They can get to within 25 yards using the trees as cover.

Graham gestures Crawford to a position with a front 3/4 view

of the house.

As we TRACK with Graham through the trees towards the back,

beyond him we see the side yard and the side windows moving

past. The windows are large. At the back -- like a ramp --

are two storm cellar doors.

127 .

FRONTAL: GRAHAM

in the dark shadows of the trees. He seems to float: through

the branches and slows and settles quietly. Then the ex-

pression on Will Graham's face starts to change...

GRAHAM'S POV: KITCHEN WINDOW

Shadows. A light comes on. Then the figure of Reba is

swung out of a corner past the window...

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S KITCHEN - DOLLARHYDE + REBA - NIGHT

On the right we see Dollarhyde's right arm with the aluminum

shafts... Beyond them, THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Graham has

stepped out from the tree line. He stands on the grass.

He looks helpless. His gun hangs idly at his side.

CLOSE: GRAHAM

It's his worst nightmare. About what he's seeing:

INT. DOLLARHME'S KITCHEN - DOLLARHYDE + BEYOND HIM 007 THE

WINDOW: GRAHAM

We and Graham see Dollarhyde's arm arc back for an uppercutting

thrust into Reba. Dollarhyde's left hand clutching her dress,

raises her two feet up the wall. And now Graham starts running

forward. And his face is distorted and he's shouting:

Dollarhyde turns to the window in time to see:

128.

WINDOW + GRAHAM

-- his arms across his face and his body angled sideways

-- CRASHES through the glass.

DOLLARHYDE

catching Graham's momentum -- throws him across the room.

GRAHAM

CRASHES off the fridge which opens and spills and hits the

floor as...

DOLLARHYDE

ROARS and grabs his 9mm from the kitchen table.

GRAHAM'S FACE

is lacerated from the glass. He sees his own blood on the

floor. He struggles to rise. The first thing up is the

big bore of the .44. It FIRES as if it had its own mind.

DOLLARHYDE'S

left shoulder EXPLODES.

GRAHAM

bleeding, brings the .44 down from the recoil of the first shot.

Now, up on one knee, he FIRES FOUR more rounds into Dollarhyde.

OVERHEAD: THE KITCHEN FLOOR

Graham stands and walks to Dollarhyde. Reba is collapsed in

the corner. Dollarhyde it more exploded from within than

shot. Graham starts to raise the gun...

EXT. DOLLARHYDE HOUSE - THROUGH KITCHEN WINDOW: GRAHAM

As we PULL BACK and see arriving squad car flashers play on

the walls and Crawford runs through the foreground, we see

Graham point the gun down to Dollarhyde's head. As we're

pulling away comes the final FLASH + REPORT and...

129.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - WIDE REAR SHOT ON GRAHAM - DAY

We will only see the rear of Will Graham sitting alone on the

side of the bed in the alienating motel room. His head is

bandaged.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. MONTANA RANCH HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOLLY - DAY

130.

Then no one says anything.

Graham slams down the phone. Still half-immersed in a

psychotic landscape of the mind, Graham's psyche resonates

with echoes of Dollarhyde. Now he gets up and walks out of

the room leaving the door open. Outside is only the deserted

parking lot.

131.

INT. TAXI (TULSA, OKLAHOMA) - PASSENGER'S POV OF DRIVER - NIGHT

It's raining The DRIVER moves slowly down a residential

street looking for an address. He squints...

INT. HOUSE - WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT

It's open plan. The dining area and kitchen are raised.

The Sherman family are engaged in 7:00 PM suburban family

chaos: GEORGE SHERMAN is trying to watch the news. He

hollers up the stairs for his daughter to turn down her

stereo. His 11-year-old son, FRED, at the dining room

table is supposed to be doing homework. Instead he rolls

up balls of paper and does jump shots from his chair into

the wastepaper can,

George Sherman goes back to NBC news. The DOORBELL RINGS.

Thirteen-year-old TINA SHERMAN comes down the stairs.

DOOR

Tina opens it.

TINA

screams.

GEORGE SHEBMAN

runs to the door. In a WIDER SHOT, we see there is a sho-

gun resting inside the door jamb. It's within reach or

Sherman's hand. We see why Tina Sherman screamed:

132.

WILL GRAHAM'S FACE

is pulled down slightly on the left side, making his left

eye moon-shaped. There is a half-healed wound and butter-

fly bandage where Dollarhyde stabbed him. He is standing

in a black raincoat with a black hat.

His wife starts to come forward.

There's a searching look on Graham's face. Totally strange.

Graham shakes his head. He doesn't want to be thanked.

No one knows what to say. Graham looks at them:

133.

SHERMAN FAMILY

standing in awkward places. They ate nothing special. They

are normal human beings living their lives. To Graham they

are very special: they are alive.

Graham stands there as if engraving each one in his memory.

Then he nods. Then he leaves.

GEORGE SHERMAN

closes the door. There's an awkward look on his face. He

didn't get to say what he wanted to say to Graham.

EXT. SHERMAN HOUSE - WIDE FROM DOOR: GRAHAM - NIGHT

-- in the MIDDLE of the FRAME -- walks down the sidewalk

away from us towards the waiting cab. The rain pelts his

black hat and black raincoat. 'Before he reaches the cab...

EXT. BEACH (MARATHON, FLORIDA)- GRAHAM - DAY

sitting with his back to us. Beyond him the sun reflects

off the crashing surf and burns out everything except the

silhouetted image of Graham.

GRAHAM IS WATCHING

the fenced-in area of beach he and Kevin built at the opening

of the film. A baby tortoise crawls over sand mountains and

is swept away by surf into the life-supporting sea.

CLOSE: GRAHAM

drinks a beer.    He senses a presence and starts to turn...

WIDE REAR SHOT:   BEACH + CRAHAM

turns towards us. Molly ENTERS THE FRAME. Her coat is

under her arm. She drops it and her flight Sag in the sand

and continues walking to Graham.

134.

GRAHAM

stands as she comes near him. The aqua highlights of the

water eat into their figures as they look at each other.

Molly touches the wounded side of his face. Then:

Graham takes Molly's hand.

WATER'S EDGE

Molly and Graham walk to the water's edge and look out to sea.

The highlights burn out sections of the two people.

Graham looks at her. He touches the side of her cheek and

her hair. She pushes against his hand with her face to make

closer contact.

REARSHOT: GRAHAM + MOLLY

Graham -- in the sunbleached violet shorts -- lays an arm

across Molly's shoulder. Molly's arm moves around Graham's

waist. They look out to sea. In front of them, the surf

kicks up drops of spray which take light and become brilliant

atoms.
