Devaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or

not. Frank's face betrays nothing. Devaney gestures with

a knife.

Frank doesn't move.

He senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what

he takes to be the first serious talk.

Frank sits up finally and looks at Devaney a long time.

He picks up five throwing knives and stands up.

Frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post.     He

throws one of the knives. It misses the post and

clatters against the fence.

Devaney's face drops.   Frank examines the next knife.

The second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc

and disappears into some bushes about three feet from

Devaney. Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind

Frank.

Frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and

motions Devaney off to the side.

Devaney smiles weakly. Frank lets the third knife go

with one smooth motion.

The knife sinks an inch into the center of the post.     THUMP.

Frank's hand arching again.     Throwing the remaining knives.

Both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical

line with the first one.

19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     19

In one of the chairs, a pretty  woman in her  mid-thirties

(NICKI, the woman we saw at the  premiere) is  knitting.

She glances occasionally at the  dancers. A   man sits next

to a phone busily discussing a  contract with  someone at

the other end of the line.

The music climaxes and abruptly stops. The dancers hold

their dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again.

APPLAUSE. The CLAPPING from the front sofa is loudest.

Then LAUGHTER.

From elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the VIDEO

DIRECTOR.

Rachel's voice comes from the sofa.

The choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from

sight. Sound of kissing, laughter.

The video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather

round it expectantly.

Devaney moves to the front of the room. The PLAYBACK

STARTS behind him. There are several overlapping

conversations going on.

NICKI, responds to Rachel's question.

But Rachel is already replying to the video director.

The brawny man, Tony, shrugs and stands to look at Frank

as he speaks.

The pinned-up girl has been brought forward for Rachel's

approval, elbowing Devaney a little to one side.

Devaney is now facing the unseen Rachel.

Devaney nods in Frank's direction.     Nicki looks at Frank.

RACHEL MARRON finally rises from the sofa.     It's a bit of

a shock to see that she is only about thirty years old.

A young woman. Not beautiful, not ugly. Unique only in

that she is immediately interesting. A Superstar.

Rachel and Frank look across the room at each other.

Frank comes forward.

Rachel offers her hand and they shake.    Rachel looks him

up and down.

Tony nods but makes no move to shake hands.

Rachel dismisses the Dress Designer.

SPECTOR, still on the phone, offers a perfunctory wave.

Nicki goes to the bar. Rachel sits and motions for

Frank to sit opposite her.

Rory gets up, and goes over to his dancers at the big

screen video.

Nicki hands Frank his orange juice.   She looks at Frank as

she speaks.

Spector enters the conversation.

An ASSISTANT hands Rachel a small sheaf of phone messages,

some papers for signature and a pen. Rachel checks

through them and signs as she talks.

Spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in.

Rachel stands and starts to wander over to Rory and

the dancers.

Frank looks at Devaney.   Devaney doesn't like the tone

this is taking.

Rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her,

starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion.

Frank looks at her a long time, glancing up at Devaney

once.

Frank's on his way. Someone brings a silver headpiece on

a stand to Rachel. She ignores it, still looking at Frank.

Rachel looks on coolly as Frank slides open the glass door.

21   EXT. POOL AREA - DAY                                        21

Frank gives up.    He's not going to get out of here.   He

stops.

Frank considers him, then slips out of his sport coat.

He crouches down so that he is eye-level with Fletcher.

Fletcher nods.

Fletcher squints up at him, the sun in his eyes.

Frank is surprised.

22   EXT. PATIO - DAY                                           22

Frank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye. He

sometimes pauses to read one more carefully. A few he

removes from the stack and places in the center of the

table.

Frank sets another letter in the center pile.   He stops,

smiling at it.

He continues to turn until something stops him. Several

letters are paper-clipped together. They are the pasted-

up type we saw being assembled on the desk top.

His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank.

Spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke.

Frank goes back to his letters.   He taps the stack in

the center of the table.

He separates one letter from the others.

Devaney searches Frank's face.

23   INT. ROOM - DAY                                             23

Devaney gently lays the cut-out letter on the bed.

Devaney shakes his head.

While Tony speaks, Frank's eyes dart to the side mirror;

his gaze never leaves it.

FRANK'S POV - BLACK TOYOTA

appears in the rearview mirror.

BACK TO SCENE

Frank speaks while concentrating on the mirror.

Frank shakes his head, he's not sure.   Tony reacts.

FRANK'S POV - TOYOTA IN REARVIEW MIRROR

As the limo turns, the 4 X 4 follows them into the turn.

ANGLE - FRANK

whispers to Henry.

48   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     48

Devaney walks back toward Rachel.

Rory sniggers into the back of Rachel's hair, fighting

off a laugh. Rachel has difficulty keeping a straight

face, too. Spector glares at them as Frank enters from

the sliding door.

Devaney turns to him.

Rachel turns ON the BLENDER, drowning out Nicki's voice.

Frank looks at Rachel coolly. She stares at him

petulantly, then turns OFF the BLENDER.

Devaney looks at Frank imploringly.

Spector looks at him as though he were a Martian.

49    INT. THRIFT SHOP - CLOSE ON CLOTHES HANGER - DAY            49

Frank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of

the shop. Rachel's head bobs up and down above the

curtain as she changes.

Frank says nothing. He gazes outside through the store-

front window and sees Henry and Tony horsing around next

to the limo. A few small boys stand around the car. One

of them is climbing onto the hood.

Frank smiles knowingly.   Rachel notices.

Rachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and

looks at herself in the mirror. Also reflected in the

mirror is Frank.

Rachel turns to Frank.

Frank continues to search the shop and street with his

gaze. Rachel steps closer to him.

Frank turns and looks at her.

It's a stand-off. After a moment, Rachel motions to

an outfit on a rack just behind him.

Frank takes a beat.   Looks out the window.

Fuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself,

whipping the curtain shut behind her.

A smile plays across Frank's face.

53   EXT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  53

Frank and Henry are waiting. Fletcher stands in the

doorway, flanked by uniformed security guards. He waves

at Frank.

Henry shrugs.

Spector starts to climb into the limo.

He disappears inside the limo.

Rachel tugs at Frank's lapels, looks him up and down,

brushing something off his shoulder. Frank's annoyed.

Rachel is about to get in.

He removes something from his pocket, a small enameled

cross.

Rachel looks at it, both flattered and confused.

Tell me what?

There were some letters before,

Rachel... same kind of thing,

threats, oddball stuff...

We didn't want to worry you...

... and somebody got into the

house...

Someone was in my house?

Okay.   Let's not get hysterical...

Let's get her out of here.

Someone was in my house?

It was weeks ago. You were out of

town...

While Fletcher was there?

Listen, Fletcher is okay. The

house is like Fort Knox now.

Right, Frank?

We should get her out of here.

Right now!

There's no way anyone could...

No way anyone could what?

No, wait... look everybody calm

down. Calm down.

Sy.

The suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely. Her

manner, too, has altered; she is charming -- friendly and

very girlish.

Frank shakes his head.

They both smile.

Rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment,

rests a hand on Frank's arm to support herself. She

removes it quickly.

Frank nods and they cut off across the grounds.

They walk in silence for few moments. When Rachel

finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself,

nervous. It's very appealing. And if it's an act, she's

a terrific actress.

A beat.

Frank knows what she's driving at. But he's not at all

happy to relinquish this information.

Frank smiles at that.

Frank is silent, grim.    Rachel looks stricken.

89   INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BASEMENT                               89

Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai

sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall. She

looks at it, peering closely.

Frank smiles.

Frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall.

Rachel looks around at Frank's modest home.

She looks at Frank and then back at the sword.   She

reaches out to touch it.

Frank nods. Rachel takes it off its mount carefully,

unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off.

Rachel slides the scabbard off. The naked blade is

breathtaking. Rachel holds the sword out before her.

She walks toward Frank, then stops and looks over the

blade at him.

He stares at her. She steps closer, so the blade is only

about a foot from his face.

is still in the bed behind him, woken by the noise of his

activity.

Frank keeps moving, looking for his shoes.

Frank finds his shoes.

Rachel sits up.

She lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top

of it.

She stops.

Rachel picks up on the word.

He automatically checks the gun as he slips it into the

holster.

Frank turns and looks at her.    This is hard for him, too.

Spector stiffens, then decides not to take this one on.

Spector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have

been listening. Rachel is silent. With a curt nod of

his head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the

room. Devaney weighs in.

Rachel is watching them both.

Spector considers her for a beat, then looks at the others.

The secretary interrupts from the back of the office.

Spector ignores her, still holding his look at Devaney,

Rachel and Frank.

Rachel nods. Spector, turning to take the call, flashes

her a "little boy" look.

Rachel is stone-faced.   Spector covers by picking up the

phone.

Frank and Rachel look at each other in silence.

Devaney leans to Frank as Spector's conversation continues

in the b.g.

Frank nods.

Frank thinks only for a moment.

Frank turns toward the door.

to get a closer look. Lounges collapse, drink GLASSES are

BROKEN, flower tubs are trampled. A lot of pushing and

shoving starts - too much for the video crew, who abandon

the filming attempt.

Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently

easing a path for her. Schiller scurries behind in

Frank's wake.

Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard

appears in the throng. She eyes him appreciatively.

Schiller nods. Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he

gets the point, and then she's off again. The throng

gets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering

her towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar

chant starts up: "Rachel, Rachel." It's starting to

resemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time,

amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few

bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved

forward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs

and Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach

him. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd

surges again.

Amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause.   Rachel

drinks it all in.

With a final surge, Frank makes it to the door with his

party. The door closes shut behind them. A mass of

distorted faces pushes onto the glass. The party walks

on briskly.

Rachel makes her entrance, and poses self-mocking on the

landing above the crowd, accepting applause. She has

succeeded in under-dressing everyone in the room. She

is a star. Frank nods in her direction... that's his

client.

SCATTERED LAUGHS.

Rachel descends into the crowd, laughing and blowing

kisses.

Frank's look says if you only knew the half of it.

Frank remembers.

A pause.

Portman notices Rachel looking at him, as she makes her

way to them. Rachel takes Frank's orange juice and sips.

Makes a very funny face.

Rachel gives Portman an approving once-over.

142    INT. BASEMENT - SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY                       142

Frank walks along checking the corridor.        At each door-

way, he stops, looks inside.

One room is dark. He flicks on the light. Near the door

is a pile of wooden crates, placed unnaturally out from

the wall.  Frank walks over and looks inside. They are

discarded vegetable crates. Frank goes back to the door

and yells toward the kitchen.

He waits impatiently. No one comes. Two quick steps and

he is back at the CRATES, throwing them violently into

the corner where they CLATTER loudly to the floor. Frank

walks on along the corridor.

He stops, noticing something around the side.

He investigates.

An ENORMOUS CUBAN is sitting on some boxes in the

shadows. He doesn't bat an eye when he sees Frank.

The Enormous Cuban gets slowly up from the boxes.        He

towers over Frank.

Frank has had   enough for one      afternoon. He hits the

Cuban low and   hard. The man       crumples forward, hurt,

but manages to   enfold Frank      in an awesome bear hug. His

weight carries   them backward      in Frank's direction.

The Cuban continues      moving in that direction, but Frank

is no longer in his      grasp. Instead, incredibly, Frank

seems to have passed      through the man's body and flicked

him into the corner      of the stairwell.

The Cuban hits the wall hard. Jarred but not lost, he

comes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a

baseball bat.

Frank steps in and      under the man's long arms and hits him

four times around      the chest and jaw. Each of Frank's

hands lands twice,      their movement is barely visible.

The solid THUDDING      tells the story. Frank strikes both

He senses another presence and looks to his right.

Rachel sits huddled in a balcony chair. The bright  moon-

light illuminates her as she looks out to sea. She  is

wearing one of her spectacular show gowns, her hair has

been brushed, and her stage makeup has been applied.   But

tonight it hasn't come together. It doesn't work.   She

holds a cigarette and the breeze keeps it glowing.  This

is the only time we've seen her smoke.

She takes a long drag on her cigarette.

Her voice cracks.   She stops and tries to compose herself.

Frank looks at her. Tears are destroying her elaborate

stage makeup. She wipes them away with her hand.

This is the first time Frank has ever heard Rachel say

that. He studies her, then looks out at the ocean.

Rachel nods.

She nods again, agreeing.

Frank turns from the window to find Nicki blocking his exit.

She moves close to him and kisses him, her hands on his

shoulders. The kiss ends and they look at each other.

Frank's look affirms it.    Nicki is embarrassed, angry.

She starts to turn away from him, but his hands are on her

now, holding her close, refusing to let her turn away.

Their faces are very close.    It is tight and near here.

Nicki twists in his grip.    He holds her tight.

Frank reaches the end of the dock at a full run and dives

directly at the rear of the moving boat. Frank's body

flies out over the boat. He knocks Fletcher out of his

seat and into the water on the other side of the skiff.

IN WATER

Frank holds the terrified, shaking Fletcher in his arms.

Fletcher begins to cry. Frank paddles with him toward

the dock. The empty boat swerves, then continues out

toward the center of the lake.

DOCK

Henry and Rachel are already    at the end of the dock. Nicki

and Herb are running toward    it. Rachel is livid, hysterical.

Henry peers out at the boat,    which continues to bounce

innocently across the water,    defining a broad curve.

Fletcher, spluttering, is handed up to Rachel by Frank.

Rachel hugs Fletcher to her. Herb bends down to check

he's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket.

Henry helps Frank up out of the water.    Frank sits on

the end of the dock, breathing hard.

Frank and Henry look out toward the boat which has come

to a stop out in the middle of the lake.

Henry looks at Frank.    He feels terrible about not

checking the boat.

Frank goes to her, treats her gently, like a doctor.

She seems on the edge of hysteria. Frank takes her face

in his hands, strokes her hair, brings her back from the

brink.

Nicki nods again, lowering her face into her hands.

Rachel takes this philosophically.     She tugs at the

grass, thinking.

She looks at him and smiles.

They are silent for awhile.     Rachel lies back on the

grass, stares at the sky.

She sits up beside him.

each curtain, corner and recess. He looks above him.

CLOSEUP ON RACHEL'S FACE as she looks around nervously.

HER BODY

is tense on Clive's arm.   Clive pats her arm soothingly.

Skip leads them to a set of temporary stairs behind the

scenery; they lead to the center of the top tier.

Production aides with clipboards and headphones wait up

there.

THE CLOCK - 8:05

They both nod, but Rachel is distracted, tense.

Clive and Rachel climb the stairs. Rachel turns once

more to look anxiously at Frank. She clutches the cross

but he doesn't see.

Frank watches them ascend. He signals Tony to stay

there until Rachel goes on. Frank moves off toward the

stage left wings.

ON TV MONITOR - we see Reardon, acting as Master of

Ceremonies, doing the introductions.

entrances on the TV monitor.

in the audience. As the people move off, Rachel becomes

clearly visible to Frank. Tony is standing next to her,

but another man has his arm around Rachel, comforting her.

Rachel's face is tear-stained and she dabs at it with a

handkerchief. She is recovering fast. Past her fear,

she is now very embarrassed. Her voice is strong.

Frank moves up closer, and exchanges looks with Tony,

who is confused by Rachel's behavior. Rachel turns

toward Frank and, in so doing, brings the man comforting

her around to face Frank. It is Reardon.

Frank barely hears Rachel, so struck is he   by Reardon's

presence. Frank looks around them quickly    for Portman.

Rachel looks at Frank with irritation and   turns back

toward the Green Room. A production aide    signals Reardon.

Rachel walks off toward the Green Room with Tony.

Reardon starts to walk out toward the stage. Frank stops

him. Reardon is irritated.

Reardon walks out on stage. Frank is left standing alone.

All the weariness comes back, all his senses start to hum.

Frank looks around, then moves off toward the Green Room.

Rachel would have to take to the stage, the steps to the

conductor, ready to play theme music.

APPLAUSE. Frank slips through the curtained doorway that

leads to the backstage.

Rachel walks along her row. Hands reach out to her.

Some people stand in their seats around her. A crane-

mounted TV camera swoops down between Frank and his view

of Rachel, obscuring her for a brief instant.

CLOSE ON FRANK'S FACE

Desperately scanning, seeking.   Suddenly his face

freezes.

FRANK'S POV

As Rachel reaches the center aisle and starts to walk

toward the steps, there in the far aisle, his face almost

hidden, is Portman -- the camera, hand-held on his

shoulder, moving level with Rachel, 20 feet behind her.

Frank raises his gun.

AISLE

Rachel walks down the aisle toward the side steps. Tears

in her eyes. Thunderous applause. Security guards in

the side aisles look around in all directions. They

can't see anything.

FRANK'S POV

TIGHT ON Portman, now almost completely obscured behind

the members of the audience, as more and more of them

stand to applaud Rachel.

PORTMAN'S POV

disappearing behind the heads of the audience.

Desperate to get a clear shot at Portman but unable to

fire without hitting a bystander.

Tony fakes a glancing blow to Frank's chin. Over by the

plane, Fletcher spots Frank and tugs at Rachel's dress,

till she turns to look. Fletcher runs up to Frank and

hugs him around the knees. Rachel approaches and Tony

moves back toward the plane.

Devaney waves in Frank's direction, tapping his watch to

indicate they are late. Frank waves and smiles.

Rachel's surprised to see Frank, but clearly happy.

Fletcher is ecstatic.

Frank laughs.    There is a pause.

Rachel nods approvingly.

Fletcher grins.   Rachel starts to cry.

The steps start to fold down out of the plane, but not

fast enough for Rachel.

She jumps the last six feet, staggering slightly as the

plane's jet wash hits her, whipping her clothes and hair.

Without pausing, she runs to Frank who takes her in his

arms. They embrace and kiss. They kiss again and again.

Finally, slowly, Rachel draws back, her eyes are filled

with tears.

Frank tries to break in, but she won't let him interrupt.

Frank tries to speak, she puts her hands to his lips.

She presses something into Frank's hand.

She gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the

plane, her eyes holding Frank's. Frank opens his palm

to reveal the little enamel cross.

ON FRANK

as the engines roar and the plane turns to taxi out.
