MAIN TITLES

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Mr. and Mrs. Ben McKenna at the back of a motor coach

with their seven year old son, HANK. We do not see

much of the background which is receding from us.

THEY are studying the countryside from the windows at

each side of them. The CAMERA PULLS BACK down the

aisle of the bus revealing the other passengers. They

are a surprise, consisting of Arab men and women, with

an occasional civilian and French Army officer. The

CAMERA STOPS at the end of the bus.

EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The French driver and a couple of his companions, Arab.

EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA MOVES BACK TO THE REAR OF THE BUS,

photographing the side windows. At the bottom of the

screen is the destination board. By the time we get

opposite the window out of which the McKennas are

looking, we have been able to read the words "CASABLANCA --

MARRAKESH."

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben and Hank are looking intently out the window.

Jo's interest seems only casual.

INT. BUS (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

Shooting through the McKenna's window at the landscape

moving by. It is semiarid desert. A line of blue-

grey mountains in the distant.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo studies the landscape.

Hank turns, and smiles slightly.

Ben gives his wife a look of exasperation, She smiles

at him.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

Shooting through the McKenna's window. The bus     is

entering a small Arab village, Squat stone and    plaster

building, narrow streets, a few carts, donkeys    and one

camel. A  few pedestrians, mostly Arab men, few    women.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben puts his hand on Hank's shoulder.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

The bus is passing through the center of the town.     We

move past a few shops, everything looking drab and

meager. The sun is strong and hot.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

Hank studies the scene outside.   He shrugs.

Jo and Ban smile at Hank.

Ben runs his tongue across his lips.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

The bus rolls on past the Arab village into the open

desert once again. It looks parched and grim.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Tired of watching the sameness of the desert, Hank

grows, restless. He looks about for something to do.

Ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes.

Jo takes a paper-bound novel out of her bag, finds her

place. Hank decides to wander down the aisle of the

bus and test its possibilities for adventure.

The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK with him as he rather aimlessly

makes for the front of the bus,. Having left the Arab

village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to

bump and sway somewhat. When Hank is a little better

than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a

particularly startling manner, causing Hank to stagger.

In order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to

grab the side of a seat. He misses the seat, and only

succeeds in clutching at the veil of an Arab woman.

Unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

The startled woman, instantly horrified, covers her

face with her hands and gives a sharp cry,

INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

With the bus still bumping and swaying, Hank staggers

a bit without realizing that he still has, hold of the

woman's veil.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The woman still covers her face, but from the seat

next to her, and nearer the window, an Arab rises and

makes a sharp comment in Arabic to Hank. The Arab's

robes are brown, with a turban-like hat combining

twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, The

Arab starts to move past the woman, toward Hank,

repeating his demand.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

People look quickly toward the sound, wondering at the

reason for the trouble.

INT. BUS (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

The bus driver scans his rear vision mirror for the

source of the trouble behind him.

INT. BUS (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Hank looks up at the oncoming Arab, and retreats

uncertainly, not realizing he is still holding the

veil.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

The Arab in the brown robes begins assaulting the boy

in furious Arabic, indicating that he wants the veil.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Two Arabs, and a veiled woman, rise in their seats

apparently disturbed by what the brown-clothed Arab is

saying. They being talking among themselves.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben and his wife, Jo, are straining from their back

seat and looking down the aisle to see what is wrong.

Ben looks at his wife quickly and then back, indicating

that Hank is involved.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Still staring straight at the Arab, both frightened

and fascinated by his verbal attack, Hank retreats.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Except for the French passengers, everyone in the bus

is in a state of disturbance. The Arab continues to

advance on Hank keeping up a steady tirade of Arabic.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Ben rises quickly and advances protectively toward his

son and the oncoming Arab.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Hank retreats and squeezes himself against his mother,

still with the veil in one hand. Ben faces the Arab

who stops, but continues his monologue for Ben's

benefit.

The Arab continues pointing, talking.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

From a nearby seat a young Frenchman in civilian clothes

rises quickly. The CAMERA PANS him to Ben and the

Arab. He pushes in between the pair.

He turns to the Arab, moves him back   a little, sharply

silences his attack, and then begins,   in Arabic, to

explain firmly that the boy meant, no   harm. It was an

accident. The Arab isn't convinced,    points to Hank.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The Frenchman leans toward Hank and takes the veil he

is still unconsciously holding. He hands it to the

Arab with a sharp command to return to his seat. The

Arab turns away carrying the veil. As the CAMERA PANS

him AWAY, we see the spectators resuming their seats,

growing quiet.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Hank and Jo relax. Ben addresses the Frenchman, a

pleasant-looking young man. He is LOUIS BERNARD.

Louis turns pleasantly to Jo.

She returns his smile.

He holds out his hand to Hank, who takes it.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Louis Bernard slides into the seat next to Jo, who

moves over slightly. Ben sits on the other side so

that Hank and Jo are between himself and Louis. In

the rear windows behind them we see the retreating

landscape of French Morocco.

She smiles at Hank, rubs the back of his neck.

Louis looks at the boy with some surprise.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo seems to be studying Bernard, as if puzzled.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben seems happy to talk with somebody new.

Louis laughs a little.   Ben seems uncomfortable.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo his been listening.   She seems annoyed at Louis

Bernard's questioning.   She interrupts.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

He smiles at her.

The background, as seen through the windows of the

bus, indicates that we are in a built-up area.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

It moves through the outskirts of Marrakesh, a somewhat

more populated section, although the streets are narrow

and crowded.

INT. BUS (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

A persists with Louis Bernard.

Even Jo has to laugh at this, and as the bus continues

on into Marrakesh, the three see to be fairly good

friends brought together by the artless charm of a

little boy.

EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

The bus moves slowly through the streets busy with

bicycle riders, Arab women carrying things on their

heads, men on foot leading donkeys, an occasional camel,

carts, horse-drawn carriages carrying elegant Moslem

women, and ancient French automobiles.

EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

The bus circles past the "Medina" of Marrakesh, the

market place with its crowds, vendors, shoppers,

beggars, and the curious. It swings in toward the bus

stop.

EXT. BUS STOP - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

The bus pulls up to a stop, the door opens, and the

passengers begin to file out. The McKennas, together

with Louis Bernard, are the last off the bus. Arab

helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus,

to unload the baggage. The clean-cut airline baggage

of the McKennas is in sharp contrast to the Hessianroped

bundles of the Arabs. There are nearby fiacres to

take the people to their various destinations in the

city, and some small, undersized taxi cabs.

EXT. BUS STOP - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Hank rubs his backside a little.

Jo tries to be casual.

But he has turned his head and speaks something in

Arabic to a porter, who begins to gather the McKenna's

bags, and one belonging to Louis. Louis turns to Ben.

Ben takes her arm, in a warm gesture.

He points out one of the open horse-drawn  carriages.

Louis looks to Ben for confirmation. Ben   nods assent.

Louis turns to the porter, and orders him  in Arabia to

put the McKenna's baggage aboard the first  available

carriage. He picks up his own small bag.

He nods to Ben and Jo, and Pats Hank on the head.

Louis smiles, turns and casually strolls off toward

the center of the market place. Hank watches him for

a moment, while Ben turns to see what is happening to

his bags.

Jo turns from the retreating Louis, and steers Hank

toward Ben, The CAMERA PANS them to the fiacre.

EXT. BUS STOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The McKennas follow their baggage aboard the carriage.

EXT. BUS STOP - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Ben settles the excited Hank into his seat.

Jo looks toward the market place, and something she

sees makes her eyes widen with surprise.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

As seen from Jo's viewpoint, over the side of the

carriage. The Frenchman, Louis Bernard, is talking

wit the Arab in the brown robes and white and green

hat. The same Arab who was assaulting Hank verbally

on the bus. They are talking pleasantly, and smiling.

EXT. BUS STOP - DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo turns to call Ben's attention to it, when there is

a sudden crack of a whip, a shouted command to the

horse, and the carriage starts of with an abrupt jerk.

It throws her head back. Hank screams with delight.

The carriage moves into the street with a rapid pace.

Jo looks again to find Louis Bernard.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

Louis Bernard and the Arab have disappeared.

EXT. THE CARRIAGE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo slumps back into the seat, trying to evaluate whit

she his seen. The market place recedes in the

background. Hank is now standing up, holding on to

the side of the carriage and watching the sights.

Jo shakes her head.

She looks at him briefly without any expression.    Then

she malts into a smile.

The carriage swings into the driveway of the Hotel

Mamounia. It is a rich-looking building, elegantly

landscaped. The CAMERA PANS it to the entrance of the

hotel. Several hotel employees move quickly to meet

it. They help the McKennas descend, and assemble the

baggage.

EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo and Hank look at the hotel.

Ben beckons the porter.

EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

A moderately well-dressed, middle-aged couple emerge

from the hotel. The man is dressed in a dark grey

flannel suit. The woman wears a light-weight, two-

piece sweater and skirt, She catches sight of Jo

McKenna. The man with her beckons to a porter. They

are Mr. and Mrs. DRAYTON.

EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo looks at the couple, then looks quickly away.

EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

With a marked glance at Jo McKenna, the woman whispers

something to the man. He follows her glance.

EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Ben reaches for Hank, and the McKennas move into the

hotel. As they move past the CAMERA, Jo plucks at

Ben's arm.

Ben gives her a look of   affectionate exasperation, and

pushes her ahead of him   into the hotel. THE CAMERA

PANS BACK to the couple   left standing outside. The

woman is still looking   after Jo McKenna.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT

It is now evening, and we are in the double bedroom

and single bedroom of the McKennas in the Hotel

Mamounia. We are able to see through into the single

room where Hank is, brushing his teeth while his mother

supervises his getting ready for bed. Jo is already

dressed for the evening in a smart-looking outfit.

Ben is by the chest of drawers and mirror. He just

lust finished putting on his shirt.

At the far end of the room there is a   balcony over-

looking the hotel gardens. By a small    table stands

Louis Bernard dressed with unobtrusive   good taste. He

is looking into the garden beyond. On    the table are

glasses and a shaker of martinis.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

In the single room occupied by Hank. Jo is putting

his clothes away.  Hank, having brushed his teeth and

rinsed his mouth, emerges from the bathroom. He wears

pajamas, but still has his shoos on.

He hums a note to give her the key.

He tap dances a vamp introduction to the song. He's

quite professional. Then he stops, takes a pose, and

begins singing in a small, but not untalented voice.

Jo takes up the song. Her voice is obviously

professional, but beyond that, quite beautiful.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Louis Bernard looks up with some surprise, fascinated

and delighted with Jo's singing ability.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Ben, who is putting on his tie, pauses, and listens.

There is a slight smile of pleasure and affection on

his face. Hank's voice comes over:

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo does a turn, takes Hank's hand and he does a turn

around her as she sings.

Hank looks up happily to his mother, as she sings to

him with love. Hank whistles a harmony accompaniment

to the next verse.

They sing the chorus in harmony together.

Just before they finish the song, there is a loud

knocking at the outside door. The song trails off.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT

Ben goes to the door, tightening his tie on the way.

He opens it. A waiter is there with a tray of food.

The waiter heads for the single bedroom, as the CAMERA

PANS Ben back to the dresser.

Ben pauses in dressing, speaks almost to himself.

Louis looks at him briefly.    There is a rattle of dishes

from the back bedroom.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT

The waiter comes out of the bedroom, followed by Jo.

The waiter nods politely, goes out the door.

He goes toward the balcony for the drink.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo turns, and gives Ben a meaningful glance.     "The

Frenchman is asking questions again."

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Ben gives her a look of comic disparagement.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Louis comes up, hands her a martini.

THE CAMERA PRECEDES Jo and Louis as they walk to the

balcony. Ben, putting the finishing touches on his

tie, watches them out of the corner of his eye.

Jo takes a seat, and Louis leans against the railing.

Jo takes a sip of her drink, with some, frustration.

She puts down     her drink with some exasperation. As

she does, she     glances back toward Ben. He's getting

his coat, but     pauses to give her a slight smile and a

look that says     "You're wasting your time."

Before he can answer, there is a KNOCK at the door,

and he looks toward it. She gets to her feet, and

starts for the door.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Jo past Ben to the door. He has just

put on his coat, and turns to follow her to the door.

She opens it, and standing in the corridor is a

silhouetted figure. We cannot see the face. Jo

switches on a light, which reveals a rather studious

looking man of medium height standing there.

Jo looks at Ben helplessly, who looks over his shoulder

toward Louis Bernard for help in translating the French.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

As the McKennas turn, the man in the doorway lifts

himself on tiptoe a little and gives a sharp look in

the direction of Louis Bernard.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The man immediately turns his attention back to Ben,

and begins talking in broken English.

As Ben closes the door, we see that Louis Bernard has

been advancing into the room for a better look at the

man in the doorway,

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The McKennas turn back to the room. Louis Bernard's

face his changed slightly to the more serious. Hank's

voice is heard off:

She goes out of the room, glancing briefly at Louis.

Ben gestures that the phone is his. The CAMERA PANS

Louis to the phone, which he picks up, and begins

talking in French asking first for the operator, and a

certain number. Beyond that his conversation is a

mystery, because his face reveals nothing. (Possibly

speaks Arabic.)

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT

As Louis Bernard talks on the phone, Ben goes to   pick

up his drink. He comes back into the room, as JO    enters

once again from the bedroom. She looks at Louis,    then

at Ben who shrugs his shoulders. Louis finishes    his

phone conversation, hangs up.

I had neglected an important matter which now requires

my attention. Perhaps, another night...

He bows briefly and moves towards the door. The

McKenna's look at each other quite bewildered.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. FULL SHOT

The CAMERA is slowly MOVING around the interior of an

Arab restaurant catering to European tourists. It has

a Moorish atmosphere, and the diners are sitting on

cushions or low sofas. Long-robed waiters are padding

in and out from the kitchens, quietly and efficiently

serving food. There are no Arab women to be seen.

The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled

with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes.

Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in

the background. The light is supplied principally

from candles.

As the CAMERA completes its sweep around and COMES TO

REST on the entrance, we see Ben and Jo arriving.

A headwaiter, wearing a fez, comes forward.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The headwaiter bows slightly.

The headwaiter turns and moves into the restaurant,

The McKennas follow him, the CAMERA PANNING them. Ben

is interested in everything he sees. Jo glances at

the diners, and then a look of surprise starts through

her face.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

They are passing a couple who are seated on cushions

eating. The couple look up at Ben and Jo. They are

the same two people we saw come out of the Hotel

Mamounia just as the McKennas entered. The woman had

stared at Jo, and she does it again, nudging the man

next to her with an elbow. The McKennas almost pass

them, then stop. The woman continues half-looking

over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The headwaiter shows them to their seats -- two cushions

directly behind those of the two people who stared at

them.

He bows and departs. Jo seems disturbed, looks around

as if trying to find another seat.

She sits on the far cushion. Her movements are graceful

and easy as she sits tailor fashion. Ben, being tall

and somewhat awkward, has trouble.

First he kneels, and then with much struggle manages

to fold his long legs underneath him.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

He turns to Jo, expecting to find her amused at his

antics, but instead her face is serious, and she has a

secret look about her. She leans close to him.

She gives a quiet, warning nod toward the two people

sitting behind them. Ben cranes his head around, but

all he can see Is the back of a woman's head. He turns

back.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben looks at her, then slowly turns his head to look

behind him at the couple. As he does, the woman behind

him also turns. They are staring directly at each

other.

Hearing her voice, Jo turns, looks, and so does the

man with Mrs. Drayton. The woman then turns half way

around toward Jo.

Jo slides a glance of "see" at Ben.

Jo visibly relaxes and becomes Jo Conway. It's Ben's

turn to give her a triumphant look in return.

Mrs. Drayton turns to the man next to her.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Another angle, featuring the man, and Ben.

Drayton looks at his wife disapprovingly.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

We now find the Draytons and the McKennas are  sitting

in a group, eating dinner together. There is   no back

to back awkwardness. All  are busily tearing  whole

roast chickens apart with their bare fingers.   Drayton

holds a piece of chicken aloft, demonstrating  the proper

Arab method of eating.

Jo is staring at the entrance to the restaurant. Mrs.

Drayton follows her glance. The two men stop talking,

and eating, and also look.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. LONG SHOT

Louis Bernard is standing in the entrance of the

restaurant. On his arm is a rather elegantly dressed

woman. She is also handsome and graceful. As he stands

waiting for the headwaiter, Louis Bernard looks around

the restaurant. His eyes stop when he comes to the

McKennas. He looks directly at them without the

slightest sign of recognition.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo and Ben stare back. There is resentment in Jo's

eyes, and conjecture in Ben's.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT

The headwaiter comes up to Louis Bernard, exchanges a

few words with him which we cannot hear, and then leads

the couple to a set of cushions in the far corner of

the room. As he moves away from the entrance, Louis

Bernard does not look at the McKennas.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

As the couple traverses the restaurant, our four diners

watch them -- the Draytons out of idle curiosity, but

the McKennas with growing astonishment as they realize

that Bernard has no intention of recognizing them, or

speaking to them. Jo turns back to Ben.

Drayton, quietly amused, is listening to Ben and Jo.

But Mrs. Drayton is embarrassed. She makes conversation

at random.

Ben makes as if to rise, but Jo holds him down.

She pushes him down again.

Ben glares in Bernard's direction, and then picks up a

chicken leg.

Ben looks a her slowly, and with some amazement. Then

his eyes lift a little and he sees the headwaiter

standing nearby gesturing to him to please use only

three fingers. Ben looks down at the chicken leg. He

is holding it gripped in his fist. This is too much.

He throws the leg down to his plate in disgust.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Over in the far corner of the restaurant, the lady

with Louis Bernard leans forward and murmurs something

in French. Her gaze is across the room in the direction

of the McKennas.

Louis turns slightly and looks.     He glances back at

her and nods significantly.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - ESTABLISHING SHOT

It is around eleven o'clock in the morning in the    main

market square at Marrakesh. This is usually the     busy

time of the day. There are coaches arriving from     the

countryside with the Arab farmers alighting with    their

baggage, veiled women getting off the coaches and    going

into the markets.

Mr. Drayton is standing by an Arab who has a small

gambling table set up, possibly roulette, There are

others gambling. After  a moment's hesitation, and a

look around to see that he is safe from Mrs. Drayton,

he chances a small bet.  He loses.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

An old man squatting on his heels and surrounded by a

small circle of onlookers is reading from a book. His

voice intones monotonously. The CAMERA PANS to the

RIGHT and we see Hank McKenna standing watching him.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Standing on the fringe of the crowd watching the

acrobats are the McKennas.

Jo starts giggling.   Ben looks it her.

Ben chuckles.

Bill Edwards' tonsils.

They turn in time to see Hank run up to them, followed

by Mrs. Drayton.

Mrs. Drayton ad Hank go out of the picture.

Drayton appears behind them.

Ben takes Jo's arm and they saunter off, leaving Mr.

Drayton to the acrobats. They do it in such a way as

to indicate the group is not hold together by any social

formalities.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA DOLLIES along beside them as they pass down

a line of Arab barbers all busily engaged with shaving

and cutting the hair of their customers.

Her eyes widen a little in surprise, and somewhat hurt,

at his statement.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA PANNING through the market place to a line

of veiled women all working at Singer sewing machines.

Drayton saunters behind them in the distance. Jo holds

out her hand for Ben to shake it.

Ben takes her hand.

Ben can't help chuckling.

They stop short of bumping into Hank and Mrs. Drayton.

The CAMERA PANNING through the market place to a line

of veiled women all working at Singer sewing machines.

Drayton saunters behind them in the distance.

Ben looks at her with some surprise.

They stop short of bumping into Hank and Mrs. Drayton.

Jo laughs appreciatively, and rumples his hair.

At this moment, Mr. Drayton saunters up, and for the

first time the group is all together. Suddenly there

as some shouts in the distance. Everyone's attention

is drawn to the noise. Hank moves quickly, threading

his way through some people for a better look, the

CAMERA PANNING him away.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

From Hank's viewpoint we see police chasing a white-

robed Arab figure. The police consist of a couple of

uniformed French officials and two or three others in

local Arab dress, with rifles slung over their backs.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Hank, fascinated at the drama, dishes away to got a

better view.

Jo and Ben miss Hank.   Then see him moving through the

faster than anyone. She passes both of the McKennas

and overtakes Hank.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton reaches down and takes hold of Hank's

shoulders, and pulls him toward her.

Hank is looking away toward the chase.

Mrs. Drayton looks toward the trouble.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A closer view of the chase brings us back to where the

motor coaches are loading up, and for a moment the

police as lost to view.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A high view of the open air tannery with its circles

of crude stone water tanks becomes the scene of a

further part of the chase. We see the white-robed

Arab leaping between the crude tanks with the police

yelling and running after him in the distance. The

difficulty of the obstacles enables the Arab to get

ahead of them, and we see that he is now able to dodge

through an archway into the grain market.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

As the chase passes through the grain market, it

scatters grain and grain sellers in every direction.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The pursued Arab dashes through an enclosure holding

the donkeys which are used to carry grain to and from

the market. There is quite a stampede, with the donkeys

running, kicking, and braying in fright.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

Through another archway the Arab now dashes down some

of the narrow streets of the Medina. Sapling branches

are laced overhead creating a latticed shadow pattern

on the ground below.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As the Arab moves along the narrow street, with the

police in pursuit, progress is made difficult by the

many shoppers and bicycle riders. One bicycle rider

trying to avoid the oncoming Arab turns and drives

helplessly into a lags pottery store. The sound of

wreckage is enormous.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The Arab turns into another street where the rows of

brilliantly dyed wool yarn hang, from overhead strung

along sapling poles. There is in unfortunate collision

between the fleeing Arab end a workman crossing the

street with a large vat of blue dye on his shoulder.

In a moment the whole narrow streetway is saturated

with blue dye, and everyone is lifting his robe and

hopping around to avoid being stained. The Arab

continues on past. The police dash through the street

trying to avoid the dye themselves.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The Police reach a narrow intersection where the blind

beggars as squatting, begging alms. They pause. There

is no sign of their quarry. Then one of them points

to faint blue footprints dashing away to the left.

They take up the pursuit once again.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A high, overhead shot of the narrow streets showing

that the police have caught sight of their man again.

But there seems to be something strange about the chase

now. Two white-robed Arabs are running. The second

Arab we haven't seen before, but he is faster than the

first man and is gaining on him.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

A closer, level shot, the CAMERA PANNING, shows, the

two breathless men closing in on each other. As they

reach an intersection in the streets, lighted by a

shaft of sunlight, the new Arab comes up behind the

original man being chased and whipping out a knife

from under his robes, plunges it into the back of the

first man. Then he turns and quickly moves away into

a street on his left. The first Arab jerks his head

up and backward with the sharp pain of the stabbing,

Then he staggers into the dark shadows.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A high shot shows that the stabbed man is almost out

of sight for a moment so that the police continue their

chase after the second man, who has swiftly darted

down another side turning.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The CAMERA MOVES IN behind the stabbed Arab. The knife

is still in his back. We get a glimpse of his hands,

vainly groping behind him. The CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM

as he staggers out into the open market place. His

shadow on the ground shows us the silhouette of the

knife handle sticking out from his back. The CAMERA

MOVES IN CLOSE to follow the agony of his head and

shoulders as he attempts to go forward.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The CAMERA seems to pass BEYOND HIM for a moment, and

there, a few yards away, stands Ben McKenna, and his

group.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The Arab hesitates for  a moment, but the attitude of

his head shows us that  he has seen McKenna. He makes

his way desperately and  painfully toward him. He is

finding it difficult to  remain upright and even take

those last few steps.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A closer view  of McKenna shows that those around him,

including his  wife and the Draytons, become frightened.

He spreads his  arms out to move them back protectively,

waiting to see  what is going to happen.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As the Arab reaches McKenna, the knife drops from his

back, and he collapses at Ben's feet. Ben endeavors

to grab him as he falls. He misses his shoulders, and

his hands close in and inadvertently grab the Arab's

cheeks.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

A big close up of Ben's hands as his fingers slide off

the Arab's face. He turns his hands up and we see

they are covered with black grease paint.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

The Arab's head his now dropped to the ground, and we

see streaks of white flesh showing through the dark

makeup which Ben's fingers had scraped off.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben drops to his knees to examine the man better.   The

Arab gasps out something in French.

Ben looks at him puzzled.

Ben is quite surprised.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben glances swiftly at the fallen knife, and then

reaches across Louis Bernard to turn him over and

examine his wound. But the Frenchman reaches up with

one arm and grabs Ben by the coat.

With what strength he has, Louis drags Ben down until

Ben's ear is near to his mouth. With a great effort

Louis whispers to him.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

A big closeup of Ben's ear and Louis' mouth enables us

to hear the whispering, but Louis' voice is fading so

much that we cannot distinguish the words -- at least

enough to make any sense out of what he says.

Presently, the mouth stops speaking.    It remains still

and open.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As Ben backs away, we see the staring eyes, and open

mouth of Louis. Ben quickly puts his hand inside the

robes to feel for Louis' heart, The hand slowly

withdraws. Ben rises.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The Arabs crowd in to see the details. Louis Bernard,

the McKennas and the Draytons are in the center of a

large flat cement section of the market place. The

Police by now have caught up to the event, and dash

quickly into the picture toward Ben and Louis.

Instinctively Ben backs away, as do the Draytons, and

Jo and Hank. However, Ben still stays closer than the

rest. One of the police picks up the knife and examines

it, another bends down to wipe the make-up off Louis

Bernard's face. Ben looks around for his wife.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben beckons to his wife beyond him, to join him. Jo

turns Hank over to Mrs. Drayton. Hank stands close to

the English woman as Jo comes over. As Jo comes up to

Ben, he is feeling in his pocket for something. Takes

out a pen.

She begins looking in her purse.

She   produces a small address book. Ben snatches it

out   of her hand unceremoniously. He opens the book

end   begins writing something down fast. Jo watches

him   with mystified curiosity.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Drayton strolls up, out of curiosity. He has also

seen Ben's hurried writing, but Ben casually puts the

notebook back into his inside pocket, along with the

pen. Before either man can comment on the writing,

the voice of a policeman is heard, speaking in French.

The uniformed French policeman approaches Ben.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The policeman repeats his question as he stops in front

of Ben.

Drayton steps forward to help.   He addresses the police.

The policeman nods.   Drayton turns to Ben.

The policeman watches their faces.

Her gestures, and her comments, although In English,

give the policeman all the information he needs.

He moves away toward the body, which the other policemen

are now covering with a sheet.

He gives them some instructions in French.

Ben looks at Jo in a way that says "Who asked you to

say anything."

The French policeman returns to the group.    He addresses

Drayton.

Drayton nods unhappily, and turns to Ben and Jo.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton comes up to the group, still holding on

to Hank's hand.

Police Two moves across the square with Drayton. Ben

and Jo precede them. Drayton begins conversing in

French with them about the crime, but we cannot

distinguish their words clearly. Jo looks back and

gives a little wave to Hank.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The McKenna's are walking across the square with the

Police and Drayton a few yards behind them. The CAMERA

MOVES with them. Jo moves close to Ben and speaks to

him in a surreptitious manner.

Ben looks at her with some surprise.

Ben looks at his hands.

JO looks away, equally embarrassed.    Ben wipes his

fingers with his handkerchief.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The main hallway and waiting room of the Police Station

in Marrakesh. French and Arab personnel move up and

down the wide hallway from one doorway to another.

There is a babble of voices and the sound of phones

heard off. The McKennas and Drayton are seated on a

long bench, waiting to be called into the inner office

of the Police Inspector. Drayton sits next to Ben.

It is hot. Jo has eyes for everything, but Ben seems

to be somewhat impatient. He looks at his watch for

the third or fourth time in a minute.

INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Drayton notices him studying his watch. He leans to

him, and at the same time wipes off the side of his on

face with a handkerchief.

She gets up and saunters away, looking around the police

station for whatever there is to see. Drayton speaks

to Ben with reassuring geniality.

Ben looks at Drayton, waiting for his to go on.

Before Ben can say any more, a policeman opens the

door leading to the Police Inspector's office. He

calls out.

INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Jo turns around at the sound of the door opening, and

Ben and Drayton start to rise from the bench.

The policeman steps aside, holding the door, as a Police

Inspector comes out of the office from behind him. He

is a short, heavy-built-dark man. He does not smile.

INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The Inspector walks a few steps into the corridor,

stops. Ben, Jo and Drayton approach him. Drayton

speaks first.

The Inspector answers in English.

He stops aside, and wait.

He motions to the McKennas. Jo goes past him first,

into the office, followed by Ben, Drayton returns to

the bench, and watches the trio as the office door

closes on them.

INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

A medium-sized office, saved from plainness of civil

service decor by a few personal decorations of the

Inspector.

He waves the McKenna to chairs, as he goes around behind

his desk and remains standing. Ben and Jo sit down.

The Inspector looks at some papers on his desk, then

holds out his hand.

Ben looks at Jo, who fishes for them in her purse.

She takes them out, hands them to Ben, who hands them

to the Inspector. He scrutinizes them. Uncomfortable,

Ben retreats to a chair and sits down, waiting. The

inspector checks the pictures against the people he

sees sitting in his office, then puts the passports

down on his desk.

The Inspector's eyes study her briefly, as if her

comment was an unnecessary interruption. Then his

eyes return to Ben.

The Inspector begins to let his skepticism be seen.

The door opens suddenly.   The two men look up.

INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

A policeman opens the door and leans in.

As he speaks, the policeman nods in the direction of

Ben.

INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The Inspector impatiently tries to dismiss the officer

with a gesture.

Ben motions to the policeman to stay where he is

The policeman at the door looks at the Inspector

briefly. The Inspector is disconcerted, but doesn't

tell the man what to say, so he turns back to Ben and

nods.

The policeman points over his shoulder to in outside

office.

He goes out the door, closing it behind him. The

Inspector sits down heavily. Then he looks up at Jo.

INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Ban as he follows the policeman down

the outside corridor, past Drayton who is still sitting

on a bench and watching Ben somewhat anxiously, and

into a small plain office.

INT. SMALL OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The policeman enters the small office   first. There is

a desk, more like a table, and a phone   is lying on it

off the hook. The policeman picks it    up, and hands it

to Ben. Ben holds it without speaking    a second, and

waves the policeman out.

The policeman is indifferent.    He leaves.   Ben puts

the phone to his ear.

INT. ROOM - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

A robed Arab is sitting in a chair holding a telephone.

The room is part of a rather elaborate Moorish house.

The Arab speaks in accented English.

INT. SMALL OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As Ben answers, he idly looks through the open doorway

toward Drayton sitting on the bench outside.

INT. ROOM - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

The Arab doesn't bother to identify himself.

The Arab starts to hang up.

INT. SMALL OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

There is an audible click in the receiver held in Ben's

hand.

There is no answer. Ben lowers the phone slightly,

looks at it a minute, then continues on downward with

it, returning the receiver to the phone cradle. He

stands a brief moment in thought, then half turns toward

Drayton sitting in the corridor outside. He motions

to Drayton to join him in the office

The Englishman gets up and comes into the small office.

Ben picks up the phone, hands it to Drayton.

Drayton reacts with surprise, speaks into the Phone.

He speaks French.

Ben slowly hangs up.   Looks at Ben.

Drayton hurries out of the office.     He goes one way,

Ben the other.

INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As Ben enters the office, both Jo and the Inspector

look up him inquiringly.

Ben adopts as casual an air as he can under the

circumstances. He doesn't sit down. He speaks more

to the Inspector than to his wife, avoiding her eyes.

The Inspector has realised that he won't get any more

out of Ben.

Ben gives him a look.

Reluctantly the Inspector reaches for a phone on his

desk. Jo looks at her husband somewhat puzzled.

He gives her a warning glance to be quiet.   She does.

He reaches out, takes her hand.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MARRAKESH STREETS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben and Jo are riding along in an open Victoria, headed

back for the Hotel Mamounia. Ben seems preoccupied

with his thoughts.

She holds out her hand more firmly.

Reluctantly, Ben takes out the notebook, hands it to

her. Ben watches her as she reads the note he has

written.

The notebook page held by Jo on which Ben has scribbled

Louis Bernard's message. It reads: "A MAN...A

STATESMAN...IS TO BE KILLED...ASSASSINATED...IN

LONDON...SOON...VERY SOON...TELL THEM...IN LONDON...TO

TRY AMBROSE CHAPPEL...

EXT. MARRAKESH STREETS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo looks up, soberly.

She closes the notebook. Ben reaches over, takes it

from her and replaces it in his pocket. She stares

ahead, with her own thoughts. Then she speaks.

Ben is uncomfortable, and unhappy, but he tries to

hide it. He leans toward Jo as if he's about to tell

her something important. He reaches out, places his

hand over hers.

EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - MED. LONG SH

The Victoria turns into the Hotel Mamounia, and pulls

up in front of the entrance. The McKennas dismount.

EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SH

Jo straightens out her dress, waits for Ben to accompany

her into the hotel. The head porter is outside

supervising some baggage with the lesser porters. He

touches his cap to the McKennas.

She turns and enters the hotel. Ben takes a bill out

of his pocket, examines it, and hands it to the driver.

The Victoria moves off. Ben turns to the Head Porter.

The head Porter turns to Ben respectfully.

Ben stares at him.

The Head Porter nods in agreement.

EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - CLOSE SH

Ben turns slowly away from the porter, his face filled

with disturbance. He looks up toward the entrance as

he hears Jo's voice off.

He quickly composes his face as best he can. The CAMERA

PANS HIM over to the entrance where Jo is waiting with

the key. He takes her arm and they enter the hotel.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

They enter the room, close the door. Ben goes

immediately to their luggage, specifically to his

medical bag. He opens it, and begins looking for

something. Jo tosses her handbag on the bed, looks

around the suite.

He doesn't answer her.    She shrugs, and starts for the

telephone.

She picks up the receiver.    Ben speaks without turning

around.

She puts the receiver down slowly.    She doesn't like

his manner.

Ben takes two pills out of a small bottle.      Closes the

bottle, and his medical bag.

She reaches for the phone again.    He turns.

She hesitates.   He goes into the bathroom, the CAMERA

PANNING HIM.

She is puzzled with him. Shrugs her shoulders. Slumps

to a sitting position on the bed. She ribs her face

and her eyes with a gesture of fatigue. There is the

sound of running water in the bathroom. When she looks

up again, Ben is standing in front of her. In one

hand he his two capsules, in the other a glass of water.

He holds them out to her. His manner is casual and

pleasant.

She looks at the pills.

She stands up.

Ben takes a deep breath.

He holds out the capsules.

Despite herself she's intrigued.

She reaches out, takes the capsules, pops them into

her mouth. He hands her the water, she drinks some of

it.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben moves away from Jo, puts the glass on a dresser.

She sits down on the edge of the bed like a little

girl waiting to hear a bedtime story.

As he talks he moves about the room first one way,

then the other, watching Jo closely, almost as if he

were trying to lull her into sleep, or hypnotize her.

Jo is beginning to appear a little drowsy.   Ben watches

her closely.

She rubs a hand over her face.   The drug is taking.

She stops talking. He looks at her more closely.

Then he walks over to her and sits down on the bed

next to her. He looks at her intensely.

He prevents her.

She comes awake more, studies him.

She nods dumbly.

She comes suddenly as awake as she can.

She pushes herself to her feet. She is fighting the

drug successfully. She almost shouts at him.

He stands up.

He takes hold of her arms.

She knocks his hands away from her arms in a sudden

violent gesture, and all but screams.

He reaches for her again.    She hits him away.

She is fighting the drug which is beginning to take

over again.

He takes hold of her again. She struggles fiercely,

trying to get away, to hit him, kick him.

He struggles silently with her, trying to push her

down on the bed, and hold her until the drug does its

work.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

He has forced her down on   the bed, pinioning her arms,

even though her legs still   struggle somewhat. She is

having a hard time seeing,   or talking. Her head waves

back and forth. It's hard    work for Ben to hold her.

Her legs grow quiet. Her arm relax somewhat. She is

still straining to move her head, and talk, but all

that comes out are unintelligible sounds and a half

moan of anguish. Then she's gone. Ben looks at her a

moment, relaxes his grip. He lowers his head down

against hers. He seem to be fighting the desire to

cry. He finally gains control of himself. He lifts

his head slightly, gives her a soft and heartfelt kiss

on the cheek.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE MOT

Ben stands up. The weight of unhappiness is heavy on

him. He gets a blanket from the foot of the bed and

covers her up. He brushes back the hair from her

forehead. Then he turns, and the CAMERA PANNING HIM

OVER to the door. He takes one last look at Jo, then

goes out the door, closing it softly behind him.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

As the light of sunset fades into growing darkness,

the muezzin stands atop the minaret, arms raised to

the heavens and giving out his high, sing-song call to

prayer. The call is taken up by another voice somewhere

in the city, and then another, and still another --

until the prayer is a continuous round of chanting

starting close, moving away, almost fading, and then

returning.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The chant of the call to prayer can be heard In the

background. We are in the single bedroom, of Hank

McKenna. There is one lamp burning over the empty

bed, and another on the wall over the dresser. Ben is

despondently carrying Hank's small suits, and other

articles of clothing from the closet to in open suitcase

on the bed. As he crosses with the final armload of

clothes, he looks out of the door into the large

bedroom.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

In the mirror, on the far wall, Ben can see the

reflection of his wife stirring in her bed. He watches

as she drags herself up into-a half-pitting position.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben quickly puts the final items of the boy's clothes

on top of the rest in the suitcase and closes it. He

picks up the suitcase and carries it into the larger

the sedative he gave her.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben puts down Hank's suitcase, and crosses to their

own luggage, the CAMERA PANNING him in such a way as

to keep Jo in the background. He opens the suitcases,

and begins taking clothes out of the dresser drawers

to pack them.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo opens her eyes and looks about   her. She tries to

straighten up her hair a little.    She takes in the

she looks toward the open door of   her missing son's

bedroom.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Ben pauses in his packing a moment to observe her.

The he continues on with his work.

Jo stares at the empty room for a moment longer, then

turns sharply back toward her husband.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

From her viewpoint we see the back view of Ben is he

continues packing. Ben half-glances over his shoulder

now aware that she is fully awake.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

She stares at him apathetically.

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

We now see Ben's face as he packs his suitcases. Beyond

him, past his shoulder, we see his wife staring in his

direction. He continues to talk, although he finds it

difficult to be matter-of-fact, moving back and forth

from the dresser drawers to the suitcases.

Her face shows a slight rise in reaction, mostly

puzzlement.

He pauses, and glances at her to see how she reacts.

She just stares at his her eyes a little dull.

Ben goes to take some of Jo's clothes out of drawer,

and comes up with a play script. He looks at it a

moment, then back to Jo. Her eyes observe it, but she

says nothing. Ben continues on to the suitcase, where

he lays the script in with the clothes.

She looks a little more sharply as if in question. He

notices as he goes to the dresser for more clothes.

He Packs some more clothes away.   Jo doesn't stir, she

just stares at him.

He looks at her for a reaction. She turns her head

away from him as if in disagreement, or perhaps fighting

for control of her emotions. Ben crosses to her, the

CAMERA PANNING him. He sits down on the edge of the

bed, and takes out the small notebook from his coat.

He opens it. In careful, low tones, he reads Louis

Bernard's message.

Jo puts out a weary hand as though to dismiss the piece

of paper, and all that it contains. Again she turns

her head away. Slowly Ben puts the paper back into

pocket. He speaks with a shade more urgency in his

voice.

Ben gets up, and the CAMERA PANS him to  the dresser

and the suitcases. Then he pauses and   looks back at

Jo who is still looking away. Jo turns   back to look

at Ben. She is studying him now as if   she has just

seen him for the first time. Her eyes   are more alert.

Ben turns back to his packing.

Slowly Jo gets off the bed, and comes over to Ben.   He

pauses, articles of clothing in his hands.

For a moment she stands there looking at him, and then

impulsively she throws her arms around him and clings

to him. Her anguish is genuine.

Ben kisses her on the cheek. She buries her head in

his shoulder. Ben stares off into space as if he hopes

to find in answer to her question.

They nod agreement and the official joins the passengers

EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo turns to Ben.

She breaks off.

He indicates fans and newspapermen.

Jo understands that his kind intention has slightly

miscarried. They look off as the yelling of the bobby

sox fans becomes louder.

EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

Fans behind the airport fence, holding out autograph

books and shouting for her autograph. Others try to

break from the barrier, but are restrained by the

As the last of the passengers leaves the plane, Jo and

Ben take a position on the steps for the photographers.

Despite the long trip, her worry, her fatigue, Jo does

her best to act the part her public demands. She smiles

as well as she can, waves a little, turns her head to

the right and to the left to favor the photographers.

EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The sober-faced woman, standing among the fans. She

has a rather grey, pasty face, and stares off at Jo

through horn-rimmed glasses that are encrusted with

dust in the corners of the lenses. After a moment she

pushes her way back through the crowd of fans and moves

out of sight.

EXT. LONDON AIRPORT - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As the photographers continue their work Ben and Jo

come down the remaining steps and are joined by a man

wearing ordinary civilian clothes. He takes  a small

black identification folder out of his pocket and holds

it up for their inspection.

There is immediate alarm in Jo's face, but she then

controls it.

His tone and manner  of asking them leaves little doubt

that his question is  an order. The McKennas glance at

each other briefly.   They realize that this is a further

development of their  involvement.

He and the airlines official lead the McKennas toward

another entrance to the Airport Building. As she

follows, Jo seems tense and a little scared.

INT. PUBLIC PHONE BOOTH - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The be-spectacled, pasty-faced woman who had been

Ben nods to him without speaking.

Mr. Woburn quietly exits, closing the door behind him.

The McKennas stand a moment, wondering what do.

Jo hesitates, then sits down.    Ben doesn't.

Buchanan sits down behind the desk.    He's sophisticated

and intelligent.

EXT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Jo leans forward quickly, eager, hopeful, unable to

Jo, a creature of emotion, is bewildered and upset and

tired of fighting Buchanan. She is ready to give in.

She looks to Ben.

Buchanan turns to Ben.

There is a pause while Buchanan studies Ben.

Ben stands there.   He has no answer.   Jo gets up from

her seat.

Ben turns to Buchanan.

Jo looks at Ben appealingly. Even Ben is uncertain

now, trying to evaluate things quickly,

He is interrupted by a tapping at the door. Buchanan

Buchanan puts out a hand. Woburn places a pen in it,

and slides a pad along the desk under it. We hear

Mrs. Drayton's voice over the filter.

Buchanan pauses, with nothing to write.

INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo shows some relief, but she's still deeply concerned.

She looks towards Ben.

INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SH

Ben moves close to her, trying to pick up a little of

the conversation from the phone. She tips the phone a

little in his direction.

Jo fights sudden tears.

She bursts out crying, unable to hold herself back any

more. Ben takes the phone from her quickly.

There is a sudden click. Ben rattles the receiver.

All he gets is a dial tone. He hangs up, and turns to

Jo who is quietly crying, trying to get over the shock

of hearing Hank. Buchanan enters the office as Ben

takes jo by the shoulders and turns her around to him.

He takes out a handkerchief, hands it to her. She

covers her face for a moment, then dries her tears.

She looks up at Ben.

She starts sobbing soundlessly again, her body shaking.

Ben takes her in his arms to quiet her. She quiets

down slowly. Buchanan standing behind the desk doesn't

look at the pair, but he speaks first.

INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Woburn comes in the office, goes to Buchanan.

He shrugs as if to say "that's the end." Buchanan

nods for Woburn to leave. Woburn does, casting a side

glance of sympathy toward Jo and Ben. He closes the

door quietly behind him.

INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Buchanan looks at the pair, and sighs in a manner that

suggests he recognizes defeat, when he sees it.

Jo now has herself under control. She leaves Ben's

arms, and returns to her seat to gather herself

together, dry her eyes. Ben turns to Buchanan.

He reaches for a pad and pencil.     He scribbles something

on it.

He tears off a page of the paper, and hands it to Ben.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

In a suite at Savoy's Hotel we see the door open and

Ben and Jo McKenna are ushered into the suite by the

frock-coated desk clerk. Behind them are two assistant

porters carrying their bags. In the foreground, through

which we are SHOOTING, are three large baskets of

assorted flowers. They are obviously gift of greeting

to London. The porters move off into the bedroom with

the bags. They lay out the bags, open the drapes and

windows, etc. The desk clerk turns on the lights in

the main room, as the McKennas look about.

Ben takes it. The    porters come out of the  bedroom.

Ben reaches in his   pocket, comes up with a  bill, hands

it to one of them.    The porter touches his  forehead in

sort of a salute.    The porters exit. The   desk clerk

follows, pauses at   the door.

Both Jo and Ben turn to look at him briefly.     He is

smiling, they are not.

The desk clerk goes out the door, carefully closing

it. The McKenna are alone. Jo turns to look at the

basket of flowers, and crosses TOWARD THE CAMERA to

look at them. She takes a card in her hand, attached

to the largest basket, reads the note.

JO stands there a brief moment, takes a breath, and

looks at to otter two cards.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben puts the room key down on a table, and the CAMERA

PANS him over to a smaller desk containing the telephone

and telephone books. He sits down at the desk, and

reaches for the general telephone directory. He begins

flipping through the pages. Jo turns from the flowers

and walks over to him. He pauses, takes out of his

pocket the black notebook on which he wrote Louis

Bernard's message. He tears out the page, hands the

notebook to Jo.

He returns to the telephone book, after looking at the

note and placing it on the desk in front of him.

He finds what is apparently the right page.    His finger

begins to trace down the list of names.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben pauses, notes the place on the Page, and reaches

for some notepaper and a pen from the desk.

He returns his eye to the book, as Jo leans closer to

watch him. He begins writing down the name and address,

and murmurs half-aloud as he writes --

He reaches for the phone, after putting the book to

one side. He lifts the receiver, but Jo reaches out

to stop him. He looks at her with some annoyance.

He picks up the phone.

He waits and at that moment there is a sudden, loud,

but happy pounding on the door. Both Jo and Ben jump

and turn toward the door, almost frightened.

Muffled shouts are heard of "Open up! We know you're

in there! Jo! It's us! We're here!"

She heads for the door, and Ben sits there squirming

with suspense, and annoyance at being interrupted.

Beyond him, Jo opens the door, and immediately four

people pour in. They are Val Parnall and his wife.

Helen, intelligent, sophisticated, and full of life.

The other two are Cindy Fontaine, an American music

hall entertainer, now in England, around forty-five,

more of a character actress than a lead -- and Jan

Peterson, a musical comedy singer nearer Jo's age,

smart-looking, but talkative and slightly

scatterbrained. The women come in first, Helen Parnell

throws her arms around Jo in affectionate greeting.

Val Parnell follows the women in and closes the door

behind him.

Jo has disengaged herself from Helen.     Shakes hands

with Val.

Ben has been watching them anxiously, torn between

hanging up the phone, or waiting for his call to go

through. The call finally comes through.

He looks up at the group.     They notice him for the

first time.

Ben tries to be casual and amiable.

Helen Parnell flops into a chair.

They all fall silent, and watch Ben.    He is

uncomfortable.

He looks at the listening group uncomfortably.

Val Parnell signals silently to her that he can wait

until after the call.

INT. CLARIDGE'S SUITE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Ben hangs up, and turns to the group. He tries to be

as casual as possible. He picks up the note from Louis

Bernard, and the one on which the address of Ambrose

Chappell is written and shoves them into his pocket.

He rises to meet his guests.

Ben volunteers his hand to Val Parnell, while nodding

at Mrs. Parnell.

Everyone laughs, including Ben and Jo.

Laughter again.

All momentary gaiety goes from Jo's face, and Ben has

a hard time appearing nonchalant.

Jo turns away toward the flowers.

He looks around.

Jo turns around to look at him, disturbed, almost to

the point of alarm. A carefree dinner is something

she just couldn't go through.

He starts toward the door, pausing to pat Jo

comfortingly on the shoulder.

Ben starts for the door.

She goes with him to the door.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Ben opens the door, and Jo follows him half-way into

the corridor. The voices of the others are half-heard

over Jo and Ben's sotto voce conversation.

In the background, the four visitors, while not actually

eavesdropping, are somewhat subdued by the attitude of

the McKennas toward each other.

He pats her affectionately on the cheek.

He turns and goes quickly. She watches him briefly,

then turns back into the room. She tries to assume a

more pleasant face...

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

In a quiet street off Camden Town we see Ben, alight

and pay off a London taxi. The taxi does a U-turn and

disappears around a corner. Ben starts to walk TOWARD

THE CAMERA. He glances at the piece of paper from,

his pocket bearing Ambrose Chappell's address. He is

completely alone in a deserted street -- so much so

that his footsteps click on the pavement and create

the feeling of an echo. As he walks he listens to the

echo ind for a moment wonders if it is an echo. He

slows up and comes to a stop close to the CAMERA.

There is complete silence -- only the faint distant

London traffic noises.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

He resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING HIM. The

echo starts again. He slows up again and stops -- but

this time the echo continues. He becomes tense, looks

around in alarm.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The CAMERA PANS the streets from Ben's viewpoint.

There is no sign of anyone.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING  him. He

stops suddenly, as though to trap the echo  -- but the

echo comes on after him. Slightly scared,   he now

resumes his walk with a more hurried pace.   The echo

gets louder. He glances quickly over his   shoulder

again.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

A man is following him, at about the same pace.   He is

rather well dressed, and appears nonchalant.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben continues walking, and after a bit cautiously

glances behind him.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The same man is following behind.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben glances down at the paper in his hand, and looks

up trying to locate the right house number as he walks.

The street has a mixture of houses, yards, an odd dirty-

looking store or two. Ben's expression indicates that

he would like to make his destination before the man

following catches up with him. Then he changes his

mind. He deliberately slows up.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Showing Ben as he walks slowly along, listening to the

man approaching behind him, listening with the back of

his head, and with his whole body. The man walking

behind is aware of Ben. He begins staring at him.

Ben instinctively clenches his right hand into a fist

of preparedness. As the man closes in Ben we see that

he is rather elderly, sixty years old, perhaps. As

the man reaches Ben, and passes him, Ben's follows him

and study him.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben watches the   man go on ahead of him at a faster

pace. Suddenly    the man turns a sharp right into

doorway, and is   gone. Ben glances at the paper in his

hand. He stops    and looks up in astonishment.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The little side doorway in which the elderly man turned.

Above it is an old painted sign reading "AMBROSE

CHAPPELL - TAXIDERMIST."

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben hesitates briefly in thought, puts the piece of

paper into his pocket, then makes up his mind and goes

through the doorway.

EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Ben, rather cautiously, makes his  way  across a small

and somewhat dreary-looking yard,  and  comes to face a

low building at the end of which  is a  kind of small

factory. The door of the factory   is  just closing as

he makes his way across.

EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben pauses at the door to the factory, and looks down

at the pushbutton bell. There is a window next to the

door. Ben bends and peers through the window.

EXT. FACTORY WINDOW - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Staring through the other side of the window is the

snarling, realistic head of a tiger.

EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Startled, Ben recoils instinctively. Then he turns

back to the door, takes a deep breath, braces himself,

and presses the doorbell. The door is soon opened by

a young workman in shirtsleeves and apron.

He opens the door, and Ben enters.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben follows the workman into the shop. It is cluttered

with stuffed animals of every size and shape imaginable.

Lions, tigers, elephant heads, swordfish, crocodiles --

everything. Ben stares around at what he sees. A

number of workmen are busy mounting, stuffing, and

preparing animals for display. The workmen who let

him in calls to someone.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A man, about eighty years old, turns from inspecting a

piece of work, and comes forward to Ben. He is a thin,

gracious, gentle sort of creature.

Ben studies the man briefly. His face shows disbelief

that such a man could be put of an assassination plot.

Chappell stops in front of him, waits a brief moment.

There is a twinkle in the old man's eye.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

From behind a doorway on the   far side a man emerge s

in response to the call. He    is somewhat younger than

the first Ambrose Chappell,   but not by much. He is

the fifty-year-old gentleman   who had been apparently

following Ben on the street.    The CAMERA PANS him over

following to his father, and   Ben.

Ben nods in return, and the elder Chappell returns to

whatever he was doing when Ben entered.

Ben turns his attention back to the son.    He is now a

little more in command of himself.

Chappell Jr. thinks for a moment.    The name obviously

doesn't register.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

A widor angle of the shop. Workmen pause in their

work to look in the direction of Ben with some

curiosity.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Chappell Jr. nods his head, but waits with a deadpan

expression for Ben to continue. After a pause, Ben

does.

Ben's expression shows that he feels Chappell is putting

up a thorough bluff, but he still goes on.

Chappel Jr.'s expression doesn't change, except for a

slightly raised eyebrow.

Ben now has the feeling he's on to the right man.

He seems to be turning the name over in his mind.    Ben

turns to at the workmen around them.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The workmen half-listening, return to their work on

the various animals. They are a bit self-conscious at

being observed eavesdropping.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben turns back to Chappell Jr. He moves in a little

closer, and drops his voice somewhat. Chappell Jr.

watches him warily.

Ambrose Chappell looks over to a man stuffing animal's

corpse.

When Ben begins mentioning a killing, Chappell Jr's

face takes on a look of alarm, almost panic. He moves

back from Ben, watching him like a deadly cobra. Ben,

however, now convinced that he has the right man in

front of him, moves in on him to finish his proposition.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Chappell Jr. now seems thoroughly frightened. He moves

back from Ben, almost stumbling. He turns, goes back

to the door of a small office, in which is now standing

Chappell Sr.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Chappell Sr. leans closer to the open door, as the son

speaks urgently and sotto Voce to him.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Chappell Jr. now turns back toward Ben, trying to assume

a pleasant and casual manner.

Workmen are pausing in their work to look at the pair,

wondering at the mention of money.

He reaches out quickly, grabs Chappell jr. by the label.

The man gives an involuntary cry of fear.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Chappell Sr. is on the phone.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Chappell Jr. struggles to get loose from Ben's grasp.

Ben lets go of Chappell Jr., and turns in confusion.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The workmen drop their tools, and move in on Ben quickly

and threateningly. Even Chappell Sr. comes out of the

office in alarm. Ben backs away toward the door.

But they don't. They come on. Ben looks quickly around

for a weapon, or an exit. He sees the door, and moves

quickly toward it, but the workmen are faster than he

is. Two of them bar the exit. Ben tries to shove

them out of the way and get through the door. The men

grapple with him. Chappell Jr., himself, and another

workman rush in, endeavoring to subdue Ben. A silent,

but furious struggle ensues. It is now a complete

melee between the four men and Ben as they try to hold

him down.

Ben breaks loose temporarily, trying to find another

escape. He realizes that the time for talking is past.

But as fast as he is, the men are on him again. They

twist and struggle through the stuffed and mounted

animals. There is a melange of lion heads, swordfish,

and other partially completed jobs. Sometimes, Ben in

his struggles comes face to face with the angry head

of a bared-teeth lion. Ambrose Chappell Jr. himself

at one point finds the swordfish a very painful object

somewhere about his anatomy. Ben eventually wrenches

himself free.

INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Shooting toward the doorway. The confusion  gives him

a free moment. He makes the door, twists it  open, and

dashes out into the yard. Suddenly he turns  back and

dashes in again. The man retreat in fear.   Ben picks

up his fallen hat and dashes out again.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The five persons in the McKenna suits are sitting

around. All but Jo have drinks in their hands. She

seems to be absorbed in her own thoughts, but Val

Parnell is holding forth, oblivious at first to her

disinterest.

He stops talking, as he looks across at the silent Jo.

Helen and the others, follow his look. They watch her

sympathetically. Jo  seems totally unaware that anyone

else is in the room, staring, into thin air, absorbed

with thoughts of her own.

She doesn't answer, so he goes on.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Slowly Jo's expression begins to chance to one of

interest. We see a flood of thoughts expressed in her

face. She looks across at Val and replies:

She rises from her chair with some excitement.    She

murmurs, almost to herself:

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The others watch Jo, puzzled at her strange performance.

No one dares speak until she finds out what it means.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

With some excitement, Jo addresses Val Parnell.

He crosses to the telephone desk, picks up telephone

directory and opens it.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY)

INSERT of telephone directory - Val's finger lands on

'Ambrose Chapel, 17 Ambrose Street, West Two.'

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

He turns triumphantly to Jo. Without hesitation she

crosses to a table, takes her purse. She hurries to

the door without a word; then turns to them.

She hurries out the door. The others are left standing,

looking at each other. Val and Helen speak almost at

the same time, asking each other the same question.

Val paces thoughtfully, and they watch him.

At that moment the door suddenly opens. Everyone turns

in surprise. Ben is standing in the doorway. He comes

slowly into the room, closing the door. He is very

tired looking, and disheveled. They watch him enter

silently.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Too tired to say anything at first, Ben drops into the

first chair he comes to. Then he looks up.

Val walks over to him, hands him a ready-made drink.

Ben takes it but doesn't have time to drink when Val

speaks.

Immediately Ben puts down the drink.

He stands up.

outside identifies it.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

A non-conformist Chapel. Empty, except for    one figure,

a woman laying out music on the organ rack   in the front

of the Chapel. The CAMERA MOVES IN on her,    and as she

turns on her way to the hymn board, we see   that she is

Mrs. Drayton. At the hymn board, she slips    into it a

series of hymn numbers.

She enters.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Inside of a small, almost bare room, Mrs. Drayton closes

the door behind her and stands with her back to it,

watching. The CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY to reveal the rest

of the room. Sitting at a small table is a listless,

young Hank McKenna. He is playing checkers with the

woman we saw at the airport who was standing with the

autograph hunters, watching Jo McKenna. The one with

the dirty glasses, who made a phone call. Hank has

caught the woman in a checker trap, and with obvious

satisfaction jumps three of her men.

Edna studies the board with a frown.   Mrs. Drayton

smiles and goes out the door.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

In the corridor once again Mrs. Drayton locks the door,

and crosses the hall. The CAMERA PANNING her. She

enters another door.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

She enters a larger, more ornate room. The CAMERA

PANS her in, and we see first Drayton, who is putting

on a surplice -- and then the man who knocked on the

McKennas' door in the Mamounia Hotel, looking for

someone named Montgomery. He is putting on a tie and

tuxedo. He wears a dangerous-looking revolver strapped

underneath his armpit; Mrs. Drayton, without a word,

sits down and lights a cigarette, exhaling with

something close to fatigue. Then she speaks.

Drayton turns, having finished his dressing.

He goes to a desk, and takes something out of a drawer.

It is a small envelope. He turns to the man with the

gun.

He hands them to Rien. Rien takes the envelope, glances

at it briefly, then puts it into his pocket.

He goes to a portable record player, which is open and

has a record on it. He looks down at the phonograph.

He gestured towards the record.

Drayton plays the record.

Drayton plays the record again and claps his hands

together at the cymbal crash.

He looks at his watch.

Drayton laughs.

He turns to his wife.

She exits with the assassin.    Drayton turns to the

obviously under way, the sound of hymn singing coming

across faintly to us.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben takes her hand, squeezes it affectionately.

Together they cross the street, the CAMERA PANNING

them up the steps of the chapel and to the entrance.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM   SHOT

They enter the Chapel from the rear, looking around

cautiously. A hymn is in progress. The Chapel holds

about three hundred people. It is of the non-conformist

type and the congregation consists mostly of middle-

aged and elderly women. Although the McKennas are not

aware of it, we notice that the organist is none other

than Edna, the woman who observed Jo at the airport,

and later took care of Hank.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Carefully the McKennas find their way to a back row

seat. One or two of the women in the back row turn to

look at the new arrivals. Jo wants to whisper something

to Ben, but with a gesture he silences her. Ben picks

up hymnal, hands her one, finds the right page and

begins to sing along with the hymn. But instead of

following the words of the hymn, Ben makes up his own

words to communicate with Jo, as he looks around at

the chapel.

Some of the parishioners turn and listen to Jo's voice

because it has a professional quality that rises above

the rest. Whether they are watching her in suspicion,

or admiration, is hard to tell. Jo turns her attention

to the hymn book, trying to be unnoticed. Ben's eyes

catch something coming down the aisle.

Jo follows his glance, leaning forward a little and to

one side.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Coming up the aisle with a collection basket, collecting

money during the hymn is Mrs. Drayton. She is

approaching the row in which the McKennas are standing.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo looks towards Ben helplessly. Mrs. Drayton is

between the two of them and any possible exit. Ben

immediately eases his way along behind a column which

hides him somewhat from the front, but not from the

side. Jo endeavors to shrink her body behind a tall

woman in front of her, but she is not entirely

successful. We can see Mrs. Drayton getting closer to

them.

Jo looks toward Ben almost panicked. Suddenly Mrs.

Drayton has reached the end of their row. She pushes

forward her collection plate, and as she does so her

face blanches. She instantly identifies the two.

Ben, with little else to do, looks her straight in the

eye and puts some coins into her plate.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As the astonished Mrs. Drayton turns to go back down

the aisle with her plate of coins and bills, we now

see the surpliced Mr. Drayton ascending the pulpit.

He looks down to his wife.

Mr. Drayton, trying to puzzle out her alarm, studies

her face, and then lifts his eyes to look beyond her.

The expression on his face leaves no doubt that he

cannot understand what she's trying to convey. The

hymn has come an end, and the congregation starts

seating itself.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The McKennas take a seat along with the rest, and as

yet they are relatively inconspicuous from the front

of the chapel. Ben takes a piece of paper out of his

pocket, examines it, and satisfied it is the right

one, hands it to his wife. The congregation falls

silent as Drayton is apparently about to begin his

sermon.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Drayton glances down to his Bible, opens it a certain

page, and as he does so, he looks at his wife who is

sitting near the organ. She half-turns to look up at

him. She seems frightened. Drayton fumbles with the

pages of the Bible, apparently trying to make something

out of his wife's attitude. Failing, he looks up and

begins his sermon. He speaks into a microphone.

Strangely enough, it is often the things beyond our

control which help to make us better beings.

Pain and tribulation are the testing ground of   life

and let us be grateful for them. Let us bless    the

disappointments and the frustrations and say a   prayer

for the agony of the moment. Only thus shall    we confirm

and re-confirm our own goodness and therefore   the

essential goodness of all Mankind.

Drayton closes the Bible, and begins to descend from

the pulpit. The congregation comes to life. The

members rise from their seats and begin filing out of

the chapel. Occasionally they cast backward glances

toward the pulpit, as if surprised at what they have

heard.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

When Drayton reaches the two steps of the altar, he

beckons the organist to him. She comes, and he whispers

something to her. He then motions his wife nearer to

him, and also whispers something to her. Mrs. Drayton

goes off through a side door by the altar, while the

organist makes her way down the aisle through the

congregation to stand by the door.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Ben as he threads his way up through

the women who are filing out. Drayton stands at the

front of the chapel, waiting. Finally, after a slow

and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel,

Ben comes face to face with Drayton. Drayton greets

him with bland amiability.

Drayton's eyes stray to the back of the church as he

talks. Ben, noticing Drayton's eye movement, follows

it cautiously. But before he can confirm his

suspicions, there is a loud clang of a door closing

that gives him his answer. He looks around quickly.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

At the other end of the chapel, the woman, Edna, has

just closed the door, and is in the process of locking

the heavy iron lock with a large key. She extracts

the key and puts it into her pocket.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben turns back to Drayton to find that his manner has

changed somewhat. He grabs him quickly by the throat

of his robes.

With a sudden twist, he wrenches himself away from

Ben. He reaches for a button on the altar, presses

it. Instantly the door by the side of the altar opens

and two rather strong men appear. Ben turns alertly

to face them, backing of a little.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

One of the men is obviously the chauffeur type, and

the other one, a handyman type in his shirtsleeves.

Ben takes this in, and notices the open door behind

them. Ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit, and

suddenly dashes for the steps.

He surprises them with his speed, and before anyone

can stop him, he is in the pulpit. He grabs the

microphone previously used by Drayton in his sermon.

He yells into it.

As the sound roars through he chapel the two man dash

for the pulpit, and at that mount we hear, faintly

off, the voice of Hank:

His voice is choked off. Ben jumps down from the pulpit

in an effort to make for the open door, but the two

men throw themselves on top of him.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo speaks into the phone with great urgency.

INT. SPECIAL BRANCH OFFICE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo interrupts him, impatient with his caution.

INT. SPECIAL BRANCH OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Woburn is concerned.

begins making some notes.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Jo is at the frantic point.

INT. SPECIAL BRANCH OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Woburn finishes making his notes. He reaches for

another phone with his left hand, and dials a number

as he talks to Jo.

He turns to the other phone.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

With a feeling of frustration, Jo hangs up the phone

as Woburn clicks off on the other end. She exits to

the phone booth.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The   back door of the chapel opens and Drayton, Hank

and   Mrs. Drayton emerge. Drayton locks chapel door

and   crosses to a waiting car. They all get in and the

car   moves off.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

Jo hurries up the street towards Ambrose Chapel.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo hurries across the street, and up the steps to the

Chapel. She tries the door.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The door locked. She tries it again. It does not

give. She bangs her on the door. No one answers.

Jo's face is puzzled and a frightened.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Jo to the right side of the Chapel.

She looks down the length of it. No sign of anyone.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Jo to the right side of the Chapel.

There is no sign of life down the whole side of it.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo returns to the front door, examines it, tries it

again. Now there is definite panic in her face. There

Is the sudden sound of a car pulling up quickly to the

curb. She turns.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

A police car has pulled up to the curb.   There are

four men in it.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Jo from the front of the Chapel down

to the police car. Three men are getting out, leaving

the driver inside.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo comes up to the three men.   One of them, in charge,

does the talking.

Two of the police move up toward the Chapel.    Patterson

glances at it.

Patterson looks at her carefully.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA PANS the two of them up to the Chapel. The

other police have gone down the sides for an inspection.

Patterson and Jo go to the main door. Patterson tries

it.

They start around the corner to inspect the sides of

the Chapel.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Patterson and Jo peer in the windows.   They apparently

see nothing.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Another policeman is checking the windows on the other

side. Nothing.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The third policeman is checking the alleyway in back

of the Chapel. He sees no sign of anything suspicious.

Patterson and Jo come around the back and try the back

door.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The back door is firmly locked.

He looks at her quizzically.

He starts for the front of the Chapel, and Jo,

unhappily, is forced to follow.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The chapel is deserted inside. In the dim light we

can see a form stretched out on the floor. It is Ben.

He begins to stir a little as if just beginning to

come to after being knocked unconscious.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The policemen are grouped around the patrol car, as

Patterson, the sergeant, talks over a radio telephone.

He hangs up, and gets out of the open car.    He turns

to one of his men.

The other policeman gets into the car, Leaving the

door open for the Sergeant.

Jo is frustrated, and irritated, but she thinks for a

moment and makes a sudden decision.

Patterson looks at her with tolerant surprise.

Jo looks back at the Chapel briefly.

They get into the car, and the CAMERA PANS it, as it

drives away down the long Victoria London street, which

now remains deserted.

EXT. EMBASSY - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The exterior rear of a huge residential building such

as is to be found in Kensington Palace Gardens or

Belgrave Square. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we see a

Humber car driving through the gates at the rear. It

pulls up at the Service entrance. A man sitting beside

the chauffeur gets out of the car. Inside the car are

the Draytons and Hark McKenna. We see the man hurry

to the door of the kitchen and enter.

INT. EMBASSY KITCHEN - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

There is a big staff of kitchen help, chefs, maids of

middle-age, all preparing food for what is obviously a

big party. The man who has entered, calls to them to

get their attention.

The work falls quiet as they become aware of him.

There is a moment of bewilderment and confusion. The

man crosses to someone obviously a butler, and whispers

some words to him. The butler turns to the workers

and starts herding them toward the corridor through a

door in the far corner of the kitchen.

The man goes to the door.

EXT. EMBASSY - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

He leans out the door and beckons the Draytons and

Hank to come in quickly. The three get out of the car

and hurry toward the door.

INT. EMBASSY KITCHEN - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The man moves back into the kitchen, and goes to stand

guard at the doorway through which the workers left.

The door is closed.

INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The servants are packed together at one side of the

corridor. They are talking, grumbling.

INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

While the other servants are grumbling, one is saying

nothing. He rather a Shrewd-looking young footman.

He strains to listen through closed door. Coming from

the kitchen are several sounds. A door opening, the

walking of feet, and finally the slam of a door.

Then the sound of a car leaving outside. The door to

the kitchen opens and the servants, including the young

footman enter again.

INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The young footman, among the first to enter, surveys

the kitchen. There is no sign of anyone having passed

through.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

The street before the chapel is still deserted, and

the light of day is beginning to fade. Suddenly the

silence is broken by the sound of the bell ringing

spasmodically in the chapel belfry. Along the street

a few people begin putting their heads out of windows,

and the one policeman left in charge is seen hurrying

away down the street.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Inside the chapel we can see the cause of the spasmodic

bell ringing. Ben is using  the rope to climb out of

the chapel. He succeeds in  reaching high window. He

holds on to the window, and looks down.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

From his viewpoint. He can see people gathering in

the street, looking up at the chapel.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben decides to swing to the opposite window which will

be away from the street. He swings, grabs, and with

some difficulty manages a foothold. He finally climbs

out through the window.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben moves cautiously out onto the roof of the chapel.

Beyond and below him we can see people on the street.

He manages to lay low and crawl over the roof, the

CAMERA PANNING him. We can now see beyond and below

the patrolman returning with two regular uniformed

policemen. They are crossing toward the chapel looking

up, as we:

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ALBERT HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

Shooting through the Albert Memorial as a foreground

piece we see the activities of the arrivals at a big

concert. Through the archway large limousines are

pulling up, while on the sidewalk level with the main

road odd taxis are pulling in. We see the usual line

of posters which run along the edge of the sidewalk.

EXT. ALBERT HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

The screen is filled with a large poster. It announces

for that evening the commemorative concert. Further

details on the poster indicate that a Cantata will be

sung featuring the London Symphony Orchestra, The Royal

Choral Society, and a name woman as featured mezzo

soprano, and Conductor Bernard Herrmann. Between the

CAMERA and the Poster a taxi pulls up. It is near

enough to the CAMERA so that just the driver and the

door fills the screen, Jo McKenna steps out the far

side and pays off the driver with a Ten Shilling Note.

She hurries away. The driver endeavors to call after

her as he turns the note around in his hand. He looks

at it with satisfaction, and stuffs it into the inner

recesses of his clothes.

EXT. ALBERT HALL - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

We see Jo threading her way across the narrow inner

roadway into which large limousines are creeping and

depositing indifferently dressed aristocrats.

EXT. ALBERT HALL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Jo finds herself going up the few steps the front door

surrounded by a mixture of tattily-dressed, tiaraed

English duchesses, and the more elegantly dressed

members of the Corps Diplomatique men in white tie,

tails and orders, and their more fashionably dressed

South American beauties.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

Shooting down from the stone-stepped, cast-iron

railinged staircase we see the milling people going

off in different directions to their seats. There is

a hubbub of voices through which we can hear the

programme sellers crying out their wares.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Jo patiently awaits her turns as two or three people,

perhaps a couple of Chelsea 'long-hairs', and one other

people, who obviously have not reserved ahead of time

because they had no money, take their turns at the

window. A uniformed attendant, standing beside this

queue, is repeating information for the benefit of the

queue.

Jo moves out of the queue and addresses him.

He resumes his chant.

Jo turns away disconsolately and starts Jo seek these

men out for herself. The CAMERA PANS her over and she

finds herself blocked off by a crowd of four or five

feet deep.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - CLOSE UP

Jo, standing on her toes endeavoring to look beyond

the block of people. Suddenly her face changes as she

sees:

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Shooting over the head of crowd she sees the arrival

of an important personage. He is accompanied by others

who are apparently attendants upon him. A couple of

the individuals behind him are wearing large order

sashes underneath their white waistcoats. The principal

figure of this group is an oldish an around sixty. He

is in white tie and tails, and also wearing a number

of foreign orders. About third is line behind him

comes 'Buchanan'.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - CLOSE UP

Jo immediately recognizes him.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

From her viewpoint we see the men she has been seeking,

possibly the manager of the Albert Hall, his assistant

cow-towing behind him, and alongside of the manager

someone dressed like he might be 'Sir Kenneth Clarke',

the head of the Arts Council, The new-arrival is

greeted. There is an exchange of courtesies, after

which they are led on toward the beginning of the

staircase. As 'Buchanan' comes nearer.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

Jo tries to push her way through towards him. The

people around her resent her efforts. Behind Jo are

two girls in their early twenties. Both are Chelsea

types.

The CAMERA PANS Jo as she does manage to get forward a

little, but she is caught up in the Sudden break-up of

the people who have lined up to see arrival. By the

time she is in the clear the CAMERA PANS her further

and over her shoulder we see the last of 'Buchanan'

and the rest up the staircase, followed by other members

of the audience going up in the same direction.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - CLOSE UP

We see Jo's frustration filling her face. She begins

to turn her head. She looks down with indecision.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

In the foreground are passing people hurrying towards

their seats. There, taking a step forward and staring

in Jo's direction, is Rien, the Assassin. His face

shows considerable alarm at what he sees.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - MEDIUM. SHOT

From his viewpoint Jo is   half-turned in his direction.

Her head is still down.    Slowly she looks up. Her

mouth half-opens when she   sees the man she once saw in

the corridor of the hotel   at Marrakesh.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

Rien, with a quick thought, hurries over to her.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

The two are in SEMI-CLOSEUP.    He says to her quietly:

He turns to go.   Jo clutches him and almost cries out.

Rien does not reply. The CAMERA PANS him away. We

see him join a woman escort and make their way for the

staircase.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we now see that the crowd in

the lobby is thinning out. Jo stands alone, jostled

by a stream of late arrivals. From the hall itself we

can hear the SOUND of the orchestra tuning up, followed

by a burst of applause, with a few shouts which

obviously herald the arrival of the visiting dignitary

in his box.

INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

Jo stares toward the opening into the hall. She seems

drawn to go in. She crosses and the CAMERA FOLLOWS

her to the first entrance to the outer corridor.

INT. CORRIDOR - (DAY) - CLOSEUP

Jo stands for a moment and then slowly crosses the

corridor to the main entrance where the ticket collector

and a programme girl stand. As she approaches the

opening, the ticket collector steps forward.

Jo shakes her heads.

She takes a step or two forward as some new arrivals

take up the attention of the ticket collector. The

programme girl escorts them out of the scene.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP

Jo stares at the vast hall in front of her.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

From her viewpoint she sees the complete hall, the

orchestra and choir assembled, and a round of applause

is heard as the conductor is seen threading his way

toward the instruments and mounts the podium.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Jo steals a glance toward the box which first catches

her eye.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

From her viewpoint she sees the  flag-draped box of the

foreign visitor. It is full of   his entourage and seat

slightly to the left of him in  the second row 'Buchanan'

is sitting. Nearer to her and   in front of 'Buchanan'

on one side of the dignitary is  a be-medalled, blue-

sashed individual who might be  an Ambassador.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP

Jo turns her head away and looks at the other side.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

The CAMERA roves among the boxes. Suddenly it stops

on one as the Assassin takes his seat with his woman

escort like any ordinary couple. They are quite casual

in their behavior.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP

Jo becomes transfixed. A sudden silence returns her

attention to the orchestra.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

From her viewpoint we see the full orchestra, the

conductor with raised baton.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

The Women's choir raise their sheets of music in unison.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - FULL LONG SHOT

From a point high above we see the whole hall, the

audience, and the orchestra. The cantata starts with

a roll on the timpani and a burst of music.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

A nearer view of the orchestra.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

A whole sweep of the orchestra with the choir

predominant.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

A skimming shot over the top of the orchestra with the

strings in the foreground predominant. The SOUND of

these instruments seems to dominate the other music

due to their proximity to the CAMERA.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The cellos -- again their sound dominates the scene.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The woodwinds -- the same sound effect.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Now the brass.   Their notes drown out the rest of the

orchestra.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Now the double brass. As each of these shots follow

in succession, we get more intimate with each group of

instruments and finally:

INT. HALL - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

To the timpani where we just hear the kettle drums

booming away.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

At last one individual, who is seated with legs crossed

and arms folded, on a chair, and beside him on another

chair, the cymbals.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP

The inert cymbals resting on their chair.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Rien in his box is glancing toward the orchestra. He

looks down beside him and slowly picks something up

from a chair.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP

Jo stares up and catches her breath.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

From her viewpoint we see Rien is raising a pair of

small black leather opera glasses which he puts to his

eyes and studies his target.

INT. HALL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP

Jo turns slowly and looks up at the dignitary's box.

He is turning to the man beside him, whom we shall

later know as the Ambassador, and indicates with

gestures how much he is enjoying the concert. He looks

back over his shoulder and gives the same gestures and

comments to 'Buchanan'. Then, turning forward, he

settles back comfortably in his seat to enjoy the music.

INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - LONG SHOT

Through the doors we see a taxi pulling away and

presently a glass door opens and a dishevelled Ben

comes into the lobby. He comes up to the CAMERA and

looks about him.

INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - MEDIUM SHOT

From his viewpoint the lobby appears empty except

perhaps for a solitary uniformed policeman.

INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Ben look the other way and upstairs.

INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From his viewpoint the other direction -- just

emptiness.

INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - CLOSEUP

We see Ben's bewilderment as to what to do and where

to go. We PAN him up to the first corridor entrance

that leads to the main circular corridor. Ben enters.

His face lights up.

INT. CORRIDOR - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From his viewpoint we see through the opening the ticket

collector and the program girl standing at the opening

leading down the main aisle. On the right, standing

with her back to him, is Jo.

INT. HALL - (DUSK) - MEDIUM SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Ben as he hurries forward. He touches

Jo lightly on the shoulder. She turns, startled, and

manages to suppress an exclamation on seeing him. We

do not hear what they are saying but by their pantomime

we see that Jo is telling Ben all about the impending

shooting. Ben argues with her. He indicates he will

tell Buchanan. She frantically restrains him but he

shakes her off and dashes away.

INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

We see Ben ascending the stairs originally taken by

the dignitary and his group.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

Ben comes into the corridor and looks about him. Beyond

him we see a group of men obviously detectives, and

ahead of them a police constable. We see Ben hurry in

his direction.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

Ben comes up to the constable and is about to pass him

when he is stopped. We again do not hear the dialogue,

but the pantomime shows that Ben is trying to get to

Buchanan. The constable doesn't quite know what to

make of Ben's dramatic plea. He indicates that he

must talk to his superior. Ben waits impatiently as

the constable goes over to one of the Inspectors who

is standing in a small group a little way off. From

his viewpoint we see the constable addressing the

Inspector with skeptical nods of his head in Ben's

direction.

INT. HALL - (DUSK) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Jo, looking over her shoulder and then up to the box

of the dignitary. She turns desperately towards the

them unfolds his arms and uncrosses his legs. He leans

forward to glance at his  score.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

Ben is still waiting for the Inspector to discuss

matters with the plainclothesman. He turns and hurries

away, the CAMERA PANNING him.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Jo is almost weeping with the effect of the singing

and the emotional stress she is going through.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

In the orchestra, the cymbal player now places one

hand on the cymbals on the chair.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

In the box the Assassin places his hand for the   first

time inside his coat towards his holster. The    CAMERA

PULLS BACK to show the woman sitting with him,   seeing

this gesture, rising and backing away into the   dark

recesses of the box.

baton vigorously. He swings over a sheet of music.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

The cymbal player turns over his music. He looks at

the music in front of him and for the first time picks

up the cymbals.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

A closer view of Ben shows him trying another door

cautiously and surreptitiously. He looks in and then

softly closes the door. He moves further along and

tries another door with the same cautious movement.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

The Assassin now has his gun out in the darkness of

the rear of the box.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

The cymbal player watching his music, his cymbals held.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - CLOSEUP

From his viewpoint with the cymbals tipping the bottom

of the screen, we see all his music. It is blank.

The CAMERA SWIFTLY MOVES IN to the bottom of the right-

hand page showing the one note he is to strike.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Jo becoming more anxious and desperate. She looks up

towards the Assassin's box with horror as she sees:

lunges forward with a blow.

INT. ASSASSIN'S BOX - (NIGHT) - CLOSEUP

The Assassin staggers back and we hear the clatter of

the gun as it falls to the floor.

The soprano singers in the middle of their note quickly

change it to a unified scream.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

The music trails off as the orchestra rises to its

feet at the startling occurrence.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

The hall is in an uproar.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The people   around the dignitary in his box are backing

up to give   him air. Someone is examining his wound.

He see by   his movements and a shake of his head that

he is not   dead.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Jo is still standing looking up.

INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From her viewpoint she sees Ben leaning over the box

in horror looking down at the dead Assassin below.

The door opens and the uniformed and plainclothes police

dash into The box.

INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - LONG SHOT

There is utter confusion in the lobby, police dashing

upstairs on either side.

INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

We see Ben hurrying down the stairs. Jo rushes into

the lobby and, seeing Ben, dashes towards him.

A few of the people around the lobby begin to look at

Jo and Ben. We see the Assistant Manager hurry over

to them. They are in a group of three, and although

we do not actually hear what he says, due to the hubbub,

he is obviously questioning Ben and being solicitous

to Jo.

INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

We go close just in time to catch the tail-end of the

conversation. Ben is just saying:

Suddenly their attention is drawn to something off-

screen up the stairs. The hubbub increases.

INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From their viewpoint we see the Prime Minister,

obviously not wounded sufficiently to incapacitate,

being escorted down the stairs by his Aide and other

members of the staff, including Woburn of the Special

Branch. The Prime Minister is indicating his arm and

obviously by the way he waves his hands, is deprecating

their concern about his wound. In fact he is rather

over-doing it. Just beyond them at the top of the

stairs we see 'Buchanan' standing with the Ambassador.

INT. LOBBY STAIRS - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

'Buchanan' is reassuring the Ambassador.

INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

The manager is leading Ben and Jo across to the foot

of the stairs. They are reluctant but he insists. As

the CAMERA PANS them over they meet the group at the

bottom at the stairs. The manager calls out to Mr.

Woburn and indicates Ben and Jo.

INT. LOBBY STAIRS - (NIGHT) - CLOSEUP

Woburn is a little non-plussed.  He leans over to one

of the Prime Minister's Aides.  The latter's face lights

up. He leans over and whispers  something to the Prime

Minister. The Prime Minister is  all smiles.

INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Woburn steps down and introduces Ben and Jo to the

Prime Minister's Aide.

The Prime Minister interrupts enthusiastically.

The Prime Minister interrupts again, less

enthusiastically.

There is an awkward pause.  The Prime Minister collects

himself and turns to move on out of the hall, the police

making a passageway for him through the crowd. We see

the Ambassador hurrying into the picture and moving

across the screen quickly to follow the Prime Minister.

INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Ben and Jo stand for a moment not knowing what to do

or where to go next. Woburn standing with Ben and Jo.

They look up and see Buchanan.

INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From their viewpoint a grim 'Buchanan' is standing at

the top of the stairs.

INT. LOBBY STAIRS - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

The CAMERA PANS Ben and Jo up the stairs towards

'Buchanan'. They increase their pace towards him.

INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

When they reach him they have only one thought in their

minds to ask him.

The CAMERA PANS the three across the top landing and

to the doors of the 'Green Room' There are various

police standing about and some of Special Branch men

can be seen inside the room. 'Buchanan' steps aside

too allow Jo to enter. Then he and Ben follow her in.

The door closes behind them.

INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The three of them enter the 'Green Room', generally

used by the principal Artistes appearing at Royal Albert

Hall. Buchanan nods to two Special Branch men who are

standing about in case they are needed. The room is

informal containing arm chairs, a sofa and a number of

small tables. Jo sits down wearily into the nearest

chair. Ben remains standing, Buchanan takes a seat in

a chair near a telephone, he looks up at Ben as if he

expects him to say something. Ben responds to the

look.

The door opens and another member of the Special Branch

enters.

Buchanan nods to him to speak.

The Detective exits as Ben sits down dejectedly in a

chair.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT

A high CAMERA shows us a large hallway and ornate

ballroom.

As yet the room is about quarter filled and various

guests of the Diplomatic Corps and others are gradually

adding to the group. The CAMERA DOLLIES DOWN over

them until it reaches slightly open doorway. Peering

cautiously through we see the face of Drayton.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

On the other side of the doorway is Drayton and his

wife. She is pacing nervously behind him. A footman

comes up to them and announces:

Drayton motions to his wife and the CAMERA PANS them

after the footman across a small hallway. He is the

very same footman we saw among the group of servants

who were herded out of the kitchen. He opens a door

in front of the Draytons -- they enter.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Standing in front of a fireplace, above which is an

oil painting of the Prime Minister, is the Ambassador

whom we saw at the Albert Hall. He is on the telephone.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind the two as Drayton

advances towards the Ambassador with an easy manner,

the CAMERA PANNING him.

Drayton and his wife stare mutely at the Ambassador.

They are staggered at this news.

Drayton still stares, petrified, at the Ambassador.

The Ambassador now begins to get really nasty.

The Ambassador paces a moment, suppressing his rage,

and then he stops and looks at Drayton as if thinking

about something.

The Ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a

manner that she almost shrinks. She tries to say

something, but no words come out of her half-open mouth.

Drayton, however, answers the Ambassador with horrible

servility.

Lucy Drayton looks at her husband with loathing. There

is a polite tap on the door. The Ambassador looks up.

The door opens and a butler enters.

The Ambassador braces himself, his       chest swells out a

little, h assumes a set smile and       strides from the

room. Just at this moment we hear        a String Orchestra

in the distance strike up some gay       waltz music. The

Ambassador goes out of the door.        Mrs. Drayton is

looking down at the floor.

INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Ben is talking.    Buchanan is listening carefully.

At this moment the phone rings. Woburn, who is now re-

placing the two Special Branch men in the room, picks

up the telephone.

He turns the telephone over to Buchanan.

Buchanan listens for a while, his face changing as he

listens with increased interest.

Buchanan hangs up, turns to Woburn, but half speaks in

the direction of the McKenna's.

Ben almost shouts as he gets up from his chair.

Buchanan turns his attention back to Ben.

He breaks off and speaks apologetically as If it were

I parenthesis.

He resumes:

As they are talking Ben is thinking hard, obviously

hatching some scheme in his mind.

Both of the men looking at Ben a moment without

answering and then Woburn speaks first.

Without answering Jo, Ben picks up the 'phone.

Ben looks at the group briefly.   Buchanan looks at Ben

with keen curiosity.

Buchanan looks intrigued and surprised. We hear the

answering click on the other end of the phone.

There is a pause and the distorted sound of a voice

mumbling on the other end of the phone. Ben interrupts

the question.

The voice on the other end of the phone mumbles briefly,

and there is silent. Ben has a satisfied look on his

face, as he hands the receiver to Jo. She seems

frightened.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

In the Ambassador's study underneath the oil painting

of himself, the Prime Minister is escorted to a

telephone by the butler who hands him the instrument.

Having been told who was on the other and of the line

he is all smiles as he greets Jo.

He listens to the other end of the phone, agreeably

making sounds such as "ah ha" "ah" "hum", then he

speaks, with a gracious sweep of his hand and a half

bow to the telephone.

He looks up to admire the painting of himself on the

wall.

INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo hangs up the phone, a little surprised and still

considerably nervous.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A taxi pulls up in the front of the large, old-fashioned

Embassy. The windows are brightly lighted, evidence

of a social occasion. Ben and Jo get out of the taxi.

EXT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben pays the driver, takes Jo's arm, and they start up

the steps of the Embassy. The CAMERA PANS them.

EXT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben presses the doorbell. His grip on Jo's's arm slides

down to her hand. He holds it tightly.

The door opens, and a liveried man ushers them in with

gesture.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

They enter a large hallway. The liveried man closes

the door. Standing in a nearby doorway is a group of

people listening to the music of a string quartet

playing in the room beyond. Included in the group is

the Personal Aide of the Prime Minister. He sees Jo

and Ben enter, hurries over to them, smiling and eager.

The piece that the string quartet is playing ends amid

a round of polite applause. There are people rising

from their chairs and a general movement out into the

hallway.

Following the Aide, Ben and Jo squeeze through the

crowded doorway.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The Aide leads Ben and Jo through the main room, the

CAMERA DOLLIES them. As they move through the room

people begin to notice them, first of all because they

are not dressed for the occasion -- but then the looks

seem to be admiring ones, and there is a smattering of

applause at their passage. Apparently people recognize

them. The Aide takes them to the Prime Minister, who

is just getting up from his seat of honor in the first

row.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The Prime Minister recognizes them immediately, and

comes forward quickly to meet them.

The Ambassador is behind the Prime Minister, and the

Prime Minister turns to him with enthusiasm.

The Ambassador comes forward quickly, all smiles.

They move off to seats -- Jo is led to piano by

Ambassador. Aide crosses to Ben.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Discreetly, Ben moves away from the group, and over

toward a side wall, the CAMERA PANNING HIM. All eyes

are on Jo.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo adjusts herself at the piano. Her face seems

serious. She looks up briefly with her eyes to check

where Ben is.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The people in the hallway, realizing there is to be

more entertainment, move toward the main room.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A tries out the keys of the Piano.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

People are finding their seats. There is coughing,

shuffling of feet, and then a gradual hush.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben watches Jo, and at the same time seems to be lookIng

around the room, particularly toward the various exits.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Having strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays

the introduction to her song. We see the great

tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional

smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but

always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice

seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole

room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place

that she has become so professional in such an intimate

drawing room setting.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - FULL SHOT

Everyone in the ballroom is listening intently, and

with surprise, at her singing.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The hallway, showing people crowded at the door,

listening.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The first landing on the flight of stairs above the

hallway. No one is around. Jo's voice loses some of

its volume.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

A higher stairway landing.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A second floor corridor, deserted.    Jo's voice fading.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A door at the end of the corridor. We now hear the

song floating up clearly, but much diminished.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

In a room on the other side of the door, Hank McKenna

is listening to the music. Hank seems a little puzzled.

Then, his face lights up and he jumps suddenly to his

feet. He runs towards the door and begins trying to

open it.

Mrs. Drayton is quite startled by Hank's performance.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Hank turns around at the doorway, to look at Mrs.

Drayton.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Mrs Drayton's face, still awed by what she has heard.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Hank, a little mystified, has no answer. He walks

slowly back into the room, towards Mrs. Drayton,

listening and thinking about what he hears.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton's face shows a new and dangerous thought

coming into it. She looks down at Hank.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

He looks at her and nods abstractedly.

She kneels down quickly to him.

On Hank's face comes a little understanding. He can

barely believe what she means. Then he understands.

He turns, and deliberately facing the door, starts to

whistle the song. He whistles loud and vigorously.

Mrs. Drayton stands up and moves back to a chair, as

she watches him.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Down in the ballroom, Jo is looking up anxiously as

she sings. She deliberately breaks and pauses for a

moment and softens her accompaniment. Then she hears

it -- a faint whistle coming from above, not enough

for those around to appreciate it, but loud enough for

the straining ears of Jo. She looks across the ballroom

to find Ben, and her eyes go up.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Watching her, Ben understands.   He gives her the

slightest sign of agreement.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo continues her song with almost excitement in her

singing voice. The CAMERA passes around her as it

follows Ben as he walks along the wall slowly.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben makes his way along the wall toward the far doorway,

which leads to the grand staircase Everyone is so intent

on listening to Jo, that his movement attracts no

attention.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

At the bottom of the service stairs in the back of the

Embassy, Drayton is standing with two men who came

with him in the car. One of them holds a short length

of rope in his hand.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben mounts two stairs leading up to the grand staircase.

He looks about him cautiously.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

At the service stairs, Drayton goes up two stairs and

turns back to the men. He looks at his watch.

He starts to move up one step.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Up in the room, Hank is bent in a chair, sobbing, Mrs.

Drayton is kneeling by him, trying to reassure him.

She stops suddenly as she hears footsteps in the

distance. She rises to her feet, and as the footsteps

grow and grow, she looks at the boy desperately, She

goes to the door, hears the steps coming nearer and

nearer. She looks across at the window.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The barred window.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

She looks down at Hank almost protectively, as  the

footsteps get still nearer. She goes to Hank,   kneels

down again and clutches the boy to her as the  footsteps

stop outside the door. She looks at the door,   with

horror.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

The door handle turns quietly, but firmly.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton lets out a piercing scream. Hank's head

jerks up. The door is heard bursting open.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ban stands in the doorway. He instantly rushes toward

Hank, the CAMERA PANNING him. Hank leaps to his feet,

and the two of them come together. No clear words are

spoken, Just muffled sounds of words as they hug each

other. Then they release each other, and turn to look

at Mrs. Drayton. She is standing, staring at the door

with horror. Ben turns quickly to look.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Framed in the doorway is Drayton. Deftly he reaches

into his pocket and produces a small automatic.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

For a moment the group stands there in silence.    Then

Ben speaks.

Drayton looks at him without saying anything, but the

gun doesn't lower.

Mrs. Drayton addresses her husband fiercely.

He moves forward on   the group, gun poised. Hank

clutches his father   in fright, and Ben tenses himself,

prepared for battle   if necessary. Mrs. Drayton stares

at her husband with   some defiance. Drayton addresses

Ben amiably.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Drayton seems unperturbed by Ben's refusal. He leans

down closer to the boy, and addresses him directly.

Hank looks up towards his father.    Drayton looks up.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Drayton's intentions are unmistakable. Ben looks down

at him with a hatred that is almost ready to explode,

but he has sense enough to understand Drayton's meaning.

Drayton straightens up, a slight smile on his face.

He slips the gun into his pocket, but still holds it.

Hank just nods.   He's too frightened to talk.

Ben starts for the door with Hank, and Drayton moves

into the other side of Hank. As they go through the

door, Mrs. Drayton makes an instinctive step forward,

if to attack Drayton from the rear, but the sight of

Hank in danger stops her.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The trio, Hank in the center, slowly strolls down the

corridor toward the main stairway. The sound of Jo

Conway's voice can be heard from below.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

SHOOTING FROM BELOW we see the big staircase empty for

a moment, then the three appear at the top.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A closer view shows the terrified, tear-stained face

of Hank, and the tense features of Ben. Drayton seems

carefully alert. The CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD in front

of them as they descend. The music coming from the

ballroom ceases, as Jo finishes her second song. There

is the sound of great applause. The three are about a

dozen steps from the bottom, when suddenly Ben shoots

out a hard and pushes Drayton forward. Taken by

surprise, he stumbles, and falls down the stairs

clumsily. Clutching for support with his hands, the

gun goes off in his pocket, and he remains in a crumpled

heap at the bottom of the stairs.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The applause having died out, the shot is heard loud,

and people pour out of the ballroom into the hallway.

They rush for the stairway, and Drayton's body, led by

the Ambassador and the Prime Minister.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As people crowd excitedly around the body, Ben is

hurrying Hank away from the scene, the CAMERA PANS

them.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Mrs. Drayton stops half-way down the stairway, and

looks down in shook at the sight of her dead husband.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Inside the ballroom, which is emptying due to the rush

of people to the corridor, Jo has risen from the piano

and is almost afraid to go out and see what has

happened. In a moment, Ben and the boy appear in  the

doorway. Hank rushes across the ballroom to his  mother,

who moves quickly when she sees him.

They embrace.

QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CLARIDGE'S SUITE - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Inside the McKenna's hotel room, the Parnells and the

two woman guests are sprawled out in ungainly attitudes

of sleep. Val is snoring pleasantly. The door of the

room opens and the three McKennas appear. The sound

awakes Val. He peers at them sleepily and struggles

to a sitting position. Ben closes the door.

Ben's voice awakens the other women. They sit up, and

stare with bewilderment at the smiling trio of Ben, Jo

and Hank.

FADE OUT
