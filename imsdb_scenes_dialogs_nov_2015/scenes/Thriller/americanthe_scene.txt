Then, about ten metres inland from the edge of the lake, a

low branch dips and a thick rug of snow falls from the

branch.

JACK grabs INGRID, yanks her towards the cover of the

lakeside trees and pushes her down into the snow.

She grunts, winded. He lies besides her.

We hear the CRACK of a bullet- so quiet it might be a bough

snapping under the weight of winter.

It isn't.

JACK pulls a WALTHER PPK/S semi-automatic handgun from the

pocket of his Parka.

Cocks it.

Waits.

Then bobs up and down once.

There's another CRACK from the trees.

JACK pinpoints the spot from the drift of BLUE SMOKE, almost

invisible in the winter air.

There's someone in the shadows.

He rubs snow into his woollen hat, edges up until he can just

see over the snow and pumps THREE SHOTS into the dusk under

the trees.

We hear a muttering groan and then a sliding sound, as if

JACK has just shot a tobogganist.

More snow slides off the trees.

JACK waits.

INGRID gathers her breath but loses her wits:

JACK keeps his eyes fixed on the trees.

JACK looks at her briefly but makes no reply.

She is busy thinking.

So is he.

He stands up slowly and walks inland towards the corpse that

is just visible now in the shadows beneath the trees.

INGRID follows, frightened.

The MAN is slouched forwards in a drift of snow, his body

cushioned in white softness.

JACK kicks the sole of his boot. He's dead.

JACK grabs his collar and turns him over.

He doesn't recognise him.

JACK fumbles at his buttons and rummages in his clothing.

In his breast pocket he finds a MILITARY IDENTITY PASS.

Swiftly, JACK removes the bolt from the man's rifle and

throws it far into the trees.

INGRID sets off, stumbling up the track they have made

through the snow.

JACK shoots her just once, in the nape of her neck.

She twitches in the snow, her blood staining the white fur of

her coat collar.

From a distance, INGRID looks like a shot Snow-hair.

JACK approaches her.

And steps over her, trying not to look down.

Trying not to look back.

The WAITER slides over and flicks a cloth at the table.

The WAITER disappears.

A beat.

LARRY puts an ENVELOPE on the table.

JACK takes the envelope and puts it in an inside pocket.

LARRY is about to speak but stops.

The WAITER reappears and puts down two cups of coffee.

LARRY puts two cubes of sugar in his cup and starts stirring.

Then speaks low and fast:

JACK smokes.

Not a question. An acknowledgement that LARRY knows exactly

what he's talking about. And JACK is listening.

JACK turns, smiling politely.

The PRIEST smiles back.

He is dressed in an ill-fitting, un-stylish black suit, a

black silk stock and a deep Roman collar fraying at the edge.

His name is FATHER BENEDETTO. He is older than JACK.

This is stated matter-of-factly: like a man practising

English.

Also a statement: this time with touch of triumph.

JACK is disconcerted but doesn't show it.

This much is true- after a fashion. They speak in English

unless otherwise specified:

31   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S HOUSE- MAGIC HOUR                    31

He pronounces warmed "war-med". His English is sophisticated

but quaint, like an out-of-date book.

JACK sniffs his drink before he sips it. Not like a

connoisseur: like a White House taster checking the safety of

a Presidential beverage.

FATHER BENEDETTO grimaces.

FATHER BENEDETTO looks at JACK.

FATHER BENEDETTO looks horrified.

A beat.

Her Italian accent is perfect.

The WOMAN looks at JACK for the first time, studying him,

awaiting his answer as if a great deal depended on it.

The final fail safe.

Now they can introduce themselves:

The identification process over, there is nothing more to do

but get down to business- and conversation becomes suddenly

awkward.

She trails off.

Her HAZEL eyes flick over the crowd in front of the cafe.

She doesn't answer.

JACK clears his throat.

Then says quietly:

She takes a long time to answer. When she does, she does so

over the rim of her half-empty coffee cup, scanning the crowd

like a cheating wife customarily anxious not to be seen by

her husband.

The WAITER delivers the Spremuta and the raspberry ice-cream.

The glass of lemon juice twists in MATHILDE's slender

fingers.

JACK clears his throat.

A beat.

She's not sure if he's joking or not. Neither are we.

JACK scans the crowd.

On the other side of the square he spots a YOUNG MAN in his

mid-thirties with short blonde hair and slight sunburn,

hovering by a stall. Average height, slim, athletic build;

sunglasses, stone-washed designer jeans very neatly pressed

with a sharp crease.

The YOUNG MAN has disappeared into the crowd.

A pause.

JACK's jaw muscles grind.

FATHER BENEDETTO serves each of them with a complete bird and

pours white wine into fresh glasses.

JACK helps himself to vegetables.

FATHER BENEDETTO watches him as he savours his first taste.

JACK licks his lips and sips some cold white wine.

The two men regard one another, the priest awaiting a

verdict.

FATHER BENEDETTO shrugs.

The flash of a smile crosses the priest's face.

JACK hides his unease from the watchful priest.

This, he decides, is the perfect spot. He unrolls a blanket,

kneels, and from his KNAPSACK he produces:

-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a

chilled bottle of Frascati

-a loaf of course bread

-50 gms of pecorino

-100 gms of proscuitto

-a small jar of black olives

-an orange

-and a rolled blanket containing the disassembled parts of

the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.

JACK sets the stopwatch on his weather beaten ROLEX.

It takes approximately thirty-four seconds to assemble the

bastardised SOCIMI- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND

SUPPRESSOR- and a further six seconds to press TEN ROUNDS

into the magazine, slot it into the base of the hand grip,

snuggle the butt to his shoulder and place his eye beside the

rubber cup on the sight.

He's fast.

Carefully he surveys the lake. Settles on a CLUMP OF REEDS.

And with the focus and dexterity of a surgeon, concentrates

until his grip and aim are perfectly tense and still.

A beat...

...as JACK holds his breath. Then squeezes the trigger.

CHOOP!

CHOOP!

CHOOP!

Not the conventional "phut, phut, phut" of a movie silencer,

but the genuine dampened sonic boom of a TAC 65 sound

suppressor.

Through the sight we see the water churn at four o'clock to

the REED CLUMP and four metres off.

From the knapsack, JACK takes a watchmaker's steel-handled

screwdriver and adjusts the sight, then loads another ten

rounds in the magazine.

CHOOP! CHOOP! CHOOP!

JACK hears the sound of an engine.

His hand moves to his pocket.

He watches a black VW SHARON pass. There's a family inside.

79   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                            79

-two clods of mozarella

-150 gms of proscuitto

-100 gms of parma ham

-a large jar of pitted green olives

-a Thermos of sweet black coffee

-and, wrapped in cloth squares, the disassembled parts of the

improved SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.

As MATHILDE starts to assemble the weapon with easy skill,

JACK checks the stopwatch on his ROLEX.

It takes her approximately twenty-eight seconds to assemble

the bastardised gun- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND

SUPPRESSOR- and a further three seconds to slot the empty

magazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggle the butt to

her shoulder and place her eye beside the rubber cup on the

sight.

She's almost ten seconds faster than JACK.

He stares at her: not an alluring young woman with good legs

and nice tits but an extension of the weapon itself and

everything it means.

He reaches into the PICNIC HAMPER.

It's an order: her voice is emotionless.

He hands her the practise ammunition in two small cartridge

boxes: the shells snug in little plastic trays.

She smiles almost imperceptibly.

She puts the gun down butt-first, leaning it against the side

of the car.

She reaches into her BLUE CANVAS SPORTS BAG and removes

several pieces of folded cardboard strengthened with split

bamboo cane.

Without speaking she sets off through the alpine blooms. In

her wake flutter a confetti of butterflies and grass

crickets, honey bees sizzling frantically as her loose summer

skirt sweeps across the flowers.

He keeps his voice down but she hears him nonetheless, waving

with her right hand: the hand holding the AMMUNITION BOXES.

She's no fool.

Neither is he. He has the gun.

At ninety meters distance she stops beside a pile of smooth

stones- a boundary cairn- overgrown with little purple

trumpet blooms.

She unfolds the cardboard. At this distance all we can make

out is a silver-grey shape against the stones.

Returning to the car she picks up the weapon.

Impressed, MATHILDE looks at the marks on the metal where the

serial number has been removed with acid.

No answer.

MATHILDE puts two jacketed rounds into the magazine and

stands with her feet apart, braced. The breeze beneath the

walnut tree ruffles her summer skirt and presses it against

her legs.

CHOOP! CHOOP!

For a moment longer she holds on the target then lowers the

gun, holding it under her arm like a lady on a shire hunt

would hold a 12 bore.

She makes a minute adjustment to the telescopic sight, with

her fingernail. She can't have turned the vertical screw more

than one notch.

Then she fully loads and fires again.

CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!

JACK lifts his binoculars and looks at the target. It's the

unmistakable outline of a BOEING 747-400, about one and a

half metres long. Painted against the cut-out is the upturn

at the end of the wing. The front doorway is shaded in.

Standing in it is the SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. In the centre of

his head are three small HOLES.

With the magazine containing the remaining 28 jacketed

rounds, MATHILDE takes aim again.

CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!

Through his binoculars, JACK can see the empty space where

the target's head used to be, the scarred stones behind and

the little scraps of cardboard floating on the warm air.

MATHILDE says nothing. She fills the magazine with lead

rounds, snaps it in place and hands the weapon to JACK.

He's taken aback.

She looks round for a target.

Slowly, JACK walks down to the stones, turns and looks back.

The CITROEN is well hidden in the deep shade of the walnut

tree. So is MATHILDE. In the poor light all he can see is her

dress and her blouse. He wipes the sweat from his eyes and

shuts them tightly.

This is not just a weapon test... it's a test of trust.

He opens his eyes again.

MATHILDE turns to face him as he shoulders the weapon.

He aims the SOCIMI at the YELLOW FLOWERS right beside her.

Holds his breath.

And pulls the trigger.

CHOOP! CHOOP!

MATHILDE remains untouched.

So do the YELLOW FLOWERS.

Troubled, JACK blinks rapidly and counts to five.

Then he fires again.

CHOOP! CHOOP! CHOOP!

Through the sight, we see two stems of YELLOW BLOSSOM fall

sideways.

Relieved, JACK walks slowly back to the car.

From her sports bag she removes a plain brown MANILLA

ENVELOPE.

She thinks.

MATHILDE hands him the ENVELOPE and disassembles the weapon.

JACK wraps the SOCIMI parts up in their cloth squares and

places them in the bottom of the PICNIC HAMPER.

She has collected up the spent CARTRIDGE CASES.

She walks down to the water and hurls the brass cases in.

FISH rise.

Again, the beauty of the place transfixes her.

By the time she turns back, JACK has laid out the picnic.

She picks up a bottle of wine.

Deftly he uncorks a bottle.

And pours it into the grass.

She freezes.

JACK points slowly.

On her tanned forearm is a BUTTERFLY.

They both stare at the insect, transfixed.

She looks up at him. Like it's a revelation she says:

JACK thinks.

The priest looks at with complete disdain:

FATHER BENEDETTO leans close and whispers:

FATHER BENEDETTO glances shrewdly at JACK, his eyes searching

into him.

JACK glances up and down the aisle.

OLD LADIES are dribbling into church in twos and threes.

The BELL for mass starts ringing.

JACK turns to go.

Ah. This is to be an impromptu English lesson. JACK

acquiesces gracefully.

He indicates two empty chairs.

CLARA moves her chair to sit closer to JACK. Under the table,

her knee presses against his.

ANNA also moves her chair nearer to JACK: but her motive is

to move it out of the sun. She is not flirting.

ANNA seems momentarily confused.

She looks at CLARA.

JACK glances at CLARA.

How much has she told her friend?

The WAITER comes over.

114   EXT. CORSO FREDERICO II, L'AQUILA- DAY                      114

Again: rehearsed. JACK is not expecting this. CLARA looks at

him mischievously. ANNA is listening.

She feigns complete perplexity.

The twinkle in her eye. She's testing him. JACK is the

perfect gentleman.

A beat. JACK spots a restaurant on the opposite side of the

road.

There is no warmth in his suggestion. But CLARA doesn't care.

She looks genuinely delighted.

117   EXT. PARCO DELLA RESISTENZA - JUST BEFORE DAWN              117

He gives a small sideways glance at JACK.

JACK is silent.

FATHER BENEDETTO stops, compelling JACK to stop too- and face

him.

A change of pace.

They stare at one another.

JACK wants to confess. He does not know why.

But he doesn't. He does something we're not expecting:

FATHER BENEDETTO is motionless.

There is a very, very long pause. FATHER BENEDETTO stares up

at JACK with extraordinary intensity.

FATHER BENEDETTO walks. JACK follows. A gust of wind makes

dust swirl from the gravel path. The two men do not speak

again until they reach the next set of Cyprus trees.

118   INT. JACK'S ROOM- EVENING                                  118

120   EXT. LOCANDA GRAPPELLI- NIGHT                                 120

She repeats her order, articulating each word emphatically,

like a teacher to a slow school child:

She isn't upset. It's just her way of letting both men know

that she's in charge.

The WAITER turns to her, deferring to her strength of

character.

He nods with some genuine deference and leaves.

CLARA sighs.

JACK smiles. CLARA smiles back. They have this contempt in

common.

The WAITER reappears and pours a thumbful of wine. It is pale

red in colour and frizzante. At CLARA's insistence, JACK

tastes it. It is dry and has a tar-like aftertaste.

He looks at her and- for a brief moment- he undergoes what is

a unique experience for him: a positive longing to repeat

this brief moment many times in the future.

CLARA catches the glow of his warmth and blossoms.

A beat.

JACK observes a GYPSY selling roses.

The GYPSY approaches, offering CLARA a ROSE. She refuses

firmly.

JACK signals to the GYPSY and buys CLARA a ROSE.

She looks at him and smiles.

Her smile is only a little bit sad.

Still, JACK doesn't know what to say.

They are saved by the appearance of the WAITER.

CLARA orders, full of Italian charm, putting JACK at his

ease. He watches her contentedly: the way she talks and

moves.

121   EXT. CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT                                  121

122   EXT. COFFEE BAR- NIGHT                                       122

CLARA hiccups.

CLARA's CELL PHONE starts to ring. It's on silent, but the

screen is flashing, just visible where it sticks out of her

handbag. CLARA looks down at the phone.

She turns the phone to silent. And looks up at JACK.

He means it.

A beat.

He's put CLARA on the spot.

CLARA takes a deep breath.

She points at her head.

She points at her heart.

136   INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS                                       136

CLARA clings to the door with her right hand, her left hand

dug deep into the fabric of the seat to steady herself.

She laughs tensely.

She snaps her fingers.

She waves her hand in the air.

It's as if the increased danger of the track diminishes her

English.

He strikes the steering wheel hard with the palm of his hand.

She pouts her reply. The TRACK disappears into a WOOD and

runs out altogether, giving way to grass.

JACK stops the car and turns the engines off.

Sudden silence.

CLARA lets go of the seat.

They are surrounded by trees.

She grips the seat again.

He eases his foot off the brake and the car begins to move

forward, the springs squeaking slightly. After 50 metres JACK

twists the steering wheel slightly and applies the brakes.

They roll gradually down to the outer edge of the woods and

come to a stop beneath a familiarly squat but ample WALNUT

TREE.

Beyond them is the LAKE, the MEADOWS and the RUINED HAMLET.

The hidden valley is a riot of colour, the blooms and

blossoms more brilliant than we've ever seen them. By the

edge of the lake stands a HERON, still as fence post.

CLARA gets out of the car, dumbstruck. JACK gets out too. He

watches her... then swiftly checks the ruined hamlet through

his miniature binoculars. Deserted. By the time CLARA turns

towards him, the binoculars are hidden.

She speaks so quietly JACK can barely hear her.

CLARA turns away, unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the

grass. She is wearing no bra. On her back dapple the shadows

and patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut.

She kicks off her shoes, which curve through the air... and

unzips her skirt. It falls to the grass. She bends and steps

daintily from her knickers. Then turns to face JACK.

JACK cannot take his eyes off her. Dizzy, he steps forward

without meaning to.

She is coquettish- and tosses her auburn hair to one side.

She doesn't wait for his reply, but turns and runs through

the grass towards the water.

The HERON flies off, rising from the reeds with an ungainly

flapping.

Quickly, JACK glances inside the CITROEN.

The RED PURSE is nowhere to be seen.

JACK undresses. As he removes his clothes, he stalls for

time, using the cover of undressing to search for the RED

PURSE.

We can see it wedged under the passenger seat.

Due to the design of the car, JACK cannot.

JACK turns to face the lake. He is naked. Yet with the

caution of years he does not remove his shoes until he

reaches the water's edge.

CLARA is standing in the middle.

He obeys her order. He walks out to her and she takes his

hand under the water, holding it out in front of them.

JACK spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake-bed.

Brassy and gleaming. A SPENT SHELL. He covers it with his

foot.

As the ripples of his arrival peter out in the reeds, TINY

FISH appear in a shoal to gather about their hands. They

hover like slivers of glass just under the surface then move

in to nibble at the skin on their fingers.

He looks at her and for a moment he forgets the awful plan in

his head.

She kisses him, pressing herself against him, her skin and

body as pure and warm as the water.

He tries helplessly to pull away.

She places her arms around his neck and raises her feet from

the smooth stones, wrapping her legs around his waist. She

tries to push herself onto him but he resists.

He doesn't know what to say. She looks at him: confused,

searching.

137   EXT. LAKESIDE- DAY                                         137

JACK watches her intently.

She reaches into her purse.

JACK is expressionless.

When CLARA withdraws her right hand she is holding a tube of

SUNTAN LOTION.

A beat.

JACK watches as she commences smoothing it into her skin,

rubbing it around her breasts, pushing them aside, pressing

them upwards. Then she caresses the lotion into her belly and

down her thighs, bending at the waist as she works it into

her shins.

She proffers him the SUNTAN LOTION.

JACK stares at her baking body, transfixed by its terrible

and perfect beauty.

Hidden behind the LID of the picnic hamper...

...his trembling right hand grips tightly to his WALTHER.

A long pause.

He's frozen.

Time seems to stop.

ECU on JACK.

Suddenly, CLARA sits up.

JACK swallows.

When he speaks his mouth his dry.

When he moves towards her, he is holding nothing in his

hands.

138   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                      138

And hands CLARA her shoe.

CLARA shivers with disgust.

JACK looks lost, like a man drained of all resolution.

CLARA looks unhappy.

Silence.

JACK looks away.

As the words leave his lips he thinks how much he wishes he

could.

She's upset but decides not to press her demand.

CLARA kisses him and simply says:

We hear the cafe door open.

And in an instant, MATHILDE is at his table.

She is dressed in a tight black skirt, a simple blue blouse

and a dark blue jacket. Her hair is neatly styled, her make-

up immaculate and heavier than we've seen her wear before.

She looks exactly like the kind of woman who might carry a

Samsonite briefcase.

She speaks quietly: her voice low and attractive.

The WAITRESS comes over with Jack's coffee. MATHILDE orders

another for herself.

She opens the bag and takes out one of the TINS.

She can immediately feel that it's heavier than it should be.

The polite phrase sounds even more polite with her slight

Belgian accent.

The WAITRESS returns with the second espresso and MATHILDE

pays for them both.

JACK watches as she stirs her coffee to cool it. She's

nervous.

For a moment she is pensive.

The slang word belies her. For an instant she has forgotten

her Belgian accent. She sounds American.

She stops beside the FORD.

JACK still has his hands on the Walther.

She definitely sounds American now.

Her RIGHT HAND slips into her pocket.

JACK twists his wrist upwards and thumbs the cocking lever.

She hands JACK an ENVELOPE.

Her American accent shows that she's letting her guard down.

Maybe it's designed to make JACK do the same.

It doesn't.

She leans forward and kisses him lightly and quickly and on

the lips.

JACK doesn't answer. His whole body is tense for the bullet

that he knows his coming. Perhaps there is a second person in

the car.

Just then...

...a COACH pulls into the car park.

It stops with a hydraulic hiss and dozens of TEENAGE KIDS

descend.

Complete silence.

Not even the sound of a siren.

The town square is empty.

Except for FATHER BENEDETTO hiding in the wreckage of the

broken STATUE.

Jack's WALTHER hangs ominously by his side.

FATHER BENEDETTO stands unsteadily.

Like lightening JACK spins, instinctively raising his WALTHER

and zeroing in on FATHER BENEDETTO. His face is devoid of all

emotion. He is a bloody machine looking at a potential

target.

We hear SIRENS.

Across a slew of dead bodies, JACK keeps the gun pointed at

FATHER BENEDETTO.

FATHER BENEDETTO stands stock still, facing JACK.

The SIRENS get louder.

A beat.

FATHER BENEDETTO takes something from inside his Soutane.

And holds it up with a trembling hand.

JACK'S LETTER.

FATHER BENEDETTO smiles sadly.

FATHER BENEDETTO shuts his eyes, muttering a quiet prayer.

The SIRENS get closer.

We hear Carabinieri screeching to a halt and clambering out

of their cars, cocking submachine guns.

When FATHER BENEDETTO opens his eyes again...

...JACK has disappeared.

It seems like night: red stripes, strip lights, shadows.

Vast fans suspended from the ceiling shift the traffic fumes.

A button of light, expanding...

...as we burst into daylight.
