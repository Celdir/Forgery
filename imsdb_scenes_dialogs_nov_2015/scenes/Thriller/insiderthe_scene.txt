FADE IN:

All we can see is black filling the screen...  Black on

black...

INT. A JEEP, LEBANON - DAY

And we're in a speeding SOVIET JEEP...  Two men in front,

shouldering assault rifles.  HEZBOLLAH SOLDIERS...  And there

are three MEN in the back.  A middle-aged Man wearing a tired

suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.  And on either

side of him, two Men, blindfolded.  The man on one side is in

his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled

black-leather jacket...  A stocky man, with the edge of a

J.D. Salinger character, he's seen everything at least once.

But even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here,

turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of Arabic music

that disappears behind him...  He's LOWELL BERGMAN.  On the

other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a

voltmeter around his neck, NORMAN.

EXT. THE BEQA'A VALLEY, BAALBEK, LEBANON - DAY

The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese

village.  It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each

carrying personnel armed with AK's and a few RPG's...  And in

the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening

Lebanese soldiers.  And as the speeding convoy passes a

captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with

Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are

the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah

religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah...  And, suddenly the

convoy skids to a stop...  And blindfolded Lowell and Norman

are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the

cloud of dust without sight...  The lanky cameraman is

stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men

guarding a small stone house, and inside...

INT. A HOUSE IN LEBANON - DAY

A round-faced Man in his mid-forties, with large-framed

glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a

dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table...

It's the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from

walls.  A Gunman cradling an AK-47 sits in an incongruous

purple armchair in a corner.  A torn poster of the Seychelles

is on one wall.  Another Gunman stands by a window.  Lowell

is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table...

The Sheikh smiles.  And the smile passes as quickly as it

came.  A steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse

is put down.

And we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come

here voluntarily.

The Sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying

him.  And Lowell "closes":

The Sheikh thinks it over and then...

It's quiet...too quiet...

Silence.  He hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold...  He

lifts it.  And he sees the Sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone.

The house empty.  Only his Cameraman, the lanky man, left

there, standing by the door still in his blindfold...

The lanky man does and we see the cameraman is Asian-

American.

Norman gives Lowell an ironic look and tests the local

current at an electrical outlet.

Lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding

height.  Baalbek and the Beqa'a Valley below gold-domed

mosques.  A moment of triumph.  He dials his cell phone...

AND WE HEAR PEOPLE LAUGHING AND ENCOURAGING "GO AHEAD...

OPEN IT..."

INT. A LABORATORY, BROWN & WILLIAMSON, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY

- DAY

We're in a SCIENCE LABORATORY...  OUT OF FOCUS LAB

TECHNICIANS, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset Black

woman's birthday...  Half her presents are opened.  Balloons,

incongruous, floating above the lab...  And there's a sense

that somebody is watching...  And from the waist up, a

disembodied figure comes into FOCUS behind a glass partition,

as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless MAN in his

late forties, watching them...

INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S OFFICE - DAY

The office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing,

their lips moving.  His hair not yet settled on grey, his

face is changing, always interesting.  Born in the Bronx,

educated in Upstate New York, he retains little of the accent

and much of the directness.  He's JEFFREY WIGAND.  He turns

to resume gathering things from his desk...some technical

books, a medical text on asthma...putting them in his

briefcase.  And as he leaves the office, the silent party

like a bizarre mime behind him...

INT. LOBBY, BROWN & WILLIAMSON BUILDING - DAY

Briefcase in hand, Jeffrey appears from the elevator from

ABOVE, from WIDE and in FRONT, his eyes, frozen pools...  And

like a bad dream, a broad-shouldered Man, leaning against the

wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable

in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel

microphone after Jeffrey's passed.

INT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUSIVILLE - DAY

Light mottled through trees reflects off the car window...

Jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and

shadow...down this tasteful, suburban Louisville street of

neat houses and manicured lawns...  He pulls into driveway

behind a 3 series BMW.  It's a grey French provincial

replica...

INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY

Jeffrey comes in and a young Girl, six, is watching

television in the den...BARBARA.

He pours himself a drink at a wet bar.

Dutiful, she shuts off the TV, going upstairs.

He looks outside.  A Woman is sitting on the back porch

drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine.

There's something like a Hockney painting about her against

the manicured lawns.  Right now the Woman comes in.  She's

pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to

wear on your arm.  LIANE WIGAND.  She has an odd delay

between a thought and her speech...

He doesn't say anything...

And it all feels suburban, familiar.  Suddenly there's a

shout...

Jeffrey goes quickly up the stairs into...

INT. WIGAND'S HOUSE - DEBORAH'S BEDROOM - DAY

And a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet

leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles

contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her

eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a

sense of suffocation.  DEBORAH WIGAND is having a severe

asthmatic attack...

Jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a

Nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube

into a circular mouthpiece.

The compressor whirs.  Deborah breathes in the medication.

Jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes

perspiration from her forehead as...

Liane rushes in with rolled-up towels, kneels in front of

Deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom

with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot

water.  We don't know why yet...

Deborah's chest heaves.  She's scared.  Jeffrey gets in front

of her and talks to her to arrest her attention.

And the medication's taking effect and she's calmer.

Liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at Deborah.  Now she

takes Deborah's hand and exchanges a look with Jeffrey.

Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver.

INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING

Jeffrey, Liane and the two Girls silently eating dinner,

Deborah in a bathrobe.

He goes into the kitchen, to the stove, seeing...

And Liane going outside...

EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - EVENING

She opens Jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup

holders.  She turns to leave and sees the backseat filled

with two boxes and the books we saw him take...

He looks at her.  There's an unspoken moment when it seems

he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...  But she

doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes...

She's stunned.  He leaves.  And as Liane's completely still,

her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she

wants to ask how

into CAMERA towards him to do that.  But he's driven off down

the street.

INT. ANOTHER HOUSE IN BAALBEK - DAY

The Sheikh, wearing a fresh white robe and skull cap, comes

into the room...

REVERSE:  Norman's camera crew is setting up.  MIKE WALLACE

is there.  A dangerous combination of intelligence,

arrogance, and celebrity, there's a kinetic quality about

him.

Wallace sits across from the Sheikh on a dais of patterned

linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural

of a French formal garden.  A Sound Technician wires the

Sheikh and Mike with microphones.  Norman says something to

Lowell and then goes out.

Mike turns his chair to face and slides it closer to the

Sheikh's chair.  The Head Bodyguard barks something in

Arabic.  The Interpreter says something back in Arabic.  The

Sheikh, absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview,

ignores all of this.

The Bodyguard, bristling at Wallace's tone, barks more

confrontational Arabic.

As Mike leaps forward, moving inches from the Bodyguard's

face with such sudden ferocity, even the Bodyguard flinches.

More armed men start to enter.

The Sheikh looks up from his notes, nods, fixes his chair,

goes back to his notes...

They know each other well.  Lowell smiles.  Wallace sits

down.

They roll camera...  "60 Minutes"...  "Hezbollah"...

The Sheikh didn't expect the Mike Wallace opening shot

between the eyes.  He recovers...

That expression of incredulity...

Mike, tipping his glasses down while the hostile Gunmen,

cradling weapons, watch him through the doorway...

The ballsiness of Wallace, asking

place, is impressive...

EXT. BERKELEY - LATE MORNING

It's still.  A MAIL TRUCK is stopped at an odd angle in the

street outside an older brick house with a bold redwood Big

Sur-like fence on a hillside.  Beyond the truck is a forever

view of the Bay.  A handle turns.  Mail truck door opens.

Mailman, carrying a box, going through the gate.  Doorstep.

Box is deposited there.  It's quiet again.  The BOX sitting

nakedly by the front door...

INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM, BERKELEY - LATE MORNING

Lowell, in sweat pants and an old tee shirt now, is on the

telephone, still in bed...  Newspapers,

The Wall Street Journal, San Francisco Chronicle

all over...home as refuge.  A tray with large cups of coffee

is on a side table.

The other phone on a nightstand rings...  A Woman in her

forties, SHARON TILLER, enters, in a bathrobe, brushing her

teeth.  She answers it...

He takes up the line...listening...

A young Man in his early twenties wanders in...

Lowell waves at JAKE, his son.

Lowell's son sits on the bed looking at part of a newspaper.

And another young Man, in his early twenties, with long hair

comes strolling in, Sharon's son, JOSIAH.

Lowell, still on the phone, waves to him.

Josiah sits on the bed too, reading the back of the sports

section Jake is reading...  Another line rings, Sharon

getting it.  The Boys, used to them, get up, and leave...

EXT. THE BERKELEY HOUSE - MORNING

The Boys coming out of the house together...  And seeing the

BOX by the door...

And they go out the gate, talking, walking off along the

Berkeley street.  The box left waiting by the door.

INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM, BERKELEY - MORNING

Lowell comes with the box back to bed.  He's already

unwrapped it.  Inside are stacks of papers...  He looks at

the box cover.  No return address.  An anonymous sender; not

unusual for him.  He casually looks through the papers.

He gives her some papers.  We see formulas...scientific data

in tables...

As he looks at the papers, Sharon goes into the bathroom...

INT. THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION AGENCY, CAFETERIA,

WASHINGTON - DAY

We see a MAN in his forties, eating a late lunch, getting

paged in a crowded cafeteria.  An old 1930's WPA mural on the

wall...  His pager goes off...

Doug Oliver walks across the cafeteria to a bank of pay

phones and dials.

INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, DEN - BERKELEY - MORNING

The phone rings.  Lowell picks it up...

EXT. A BERKELEY CAFE - CLOSE:  PAY PHONE

There's the sound of a phone ringing.  PULL BACK to reveal

Lowell outside a cafe with dry cleaning he collected over one

shoulder.  A LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE OVER (Deborah's) answers.

"Hello."

There's a whisper..."Someone's calling for Daddy, Mom."

Behind Lowell is a humming Berkeley street.  He gestures

familiarly to a Server, who brings out his two take-out

cappuccinos.  Lowell nods his thanks, pays...

Lowell waits for some moments, and...

INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

EXT./INT. BERKELEY CAFE - DAY

And she hangs up.  Lowell's motionless...  And his interest

piqued, he sets down his cleaning.  He calls back...  The

phone rings and rings...  A MACHINE picks it up...  Jeffrey

Wigand's Voice:  "This is the Wigands'...  If you'd like to

leave a message or send a fax, start now..."

INT. THE WIGAND HOUSE, JEFFREY'S OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

And we see Jeffrey Wigand, sitting at his desk in his office,

working on his computer, hearing Lowell...

He hangs up.  Jeffrey doesn't react, quietly working on his

computer.

INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - DAY

Lowell's restless, waiting...  And not getting a call back,

he tries another tact.  He writes a FAX, "Please call me

at..."  He writes his number down.  He sends the Fax.  He's

still.  It's quiet.  And not getting an answer he gets up,

starting to leave the room.  And suddenly the fax machine

RINGS...  He turns.  He reads a message emerging from the

machine..."I can't talk to you..."  He's quiet.  He writes on

a piece of paper..."Can't talk to me?"  "Won't talk to me?"

"Don't want to talk to me...?"  As he faxes it back...

INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

Wigand reading the return fax from Lowell...

INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - DAY

Lowell, waiting...  The fax machine rings again...  He reads

Jeffrey's answer.  "Can't."  "Won't."  "Don't want to..."

He's quiet, more than just interested, now.  There's

something beyond intriguing here.  He turns.  He looks

through a stack of phone books for something...a nationwide

800 directory.  He looks through it and dials Wigand's phone

number again...

INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

Wigand working on his computer...  Lowell's VOICE on his

answering machine...

Lowell clicks off.  And as Wigand sits at his computer,

giving no indication what he might do...

INT. THE SEELBACH HOTEL LOBBY, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - EARLY

EVENING

An old hotel with faded carpets.  Lowell in the lobby reading

a

time somebody passes, he looks down at people's shoes.  A

pair of black wing tips walking by...  A woman's high

heels...  A pair of men's tasseled loafers.  A lace-up brown.

A pair of tennis shoes.  A cordovan wing tip.  The pair of

tasseled loafers walking by again...  And Lowell looks up...

And the Man in the tasseled loafers, turns away...  It's

Jeffrey Wigand in a suit and a tie with a Fortune 500,

corporate-executive bearing...  Lowell crosses to the

elevators.  Wigand looks around the lobby and follows Lowell

in, and as the doors close...

INT. A HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - EARLY EVENING

Brilliant late afternoon sunlight.  We PULL BACK to see

Jeffrey, standing by a window, silently looking outside to

the left...  Lowell, cool, waiting, hands in his pockets, in

the middle of the large room...

A sudden KNOCK on the door...

Room Service brings in a tray with coffee.  As Lowell signs

the bill, the Room Service Waiter waiting, looks at Wigand...

Their eyes meet...  The Waiter looks away.

And the Waiter leaves...

Lowell gives him his cup of coffee.

Lowell smiles.

Lowell looks at him, he does his homework...

Wigand's quiet, measuring him.

Lowell gives him the box of papers...  Wigand sits down, the

box on his lap, quietly looking through them...flips to a

different heading, consults a chart...

He puts the papers down...

And Lowell knows something else is going on here...

A lot more is going on here...  Lowell nods, a good

reporter...

Wigand nods "Okay."

He turns to leave...  Lowell gets the door for him...  Wigand

momentarily slows...

And he goes out the door...  Lowell's still.  Wigand's job

title resonates.  Lowell turns to the window, casually

looking into the early evening...and he comes face to face

with what Wigand was staring at, The Brown & Williamson

Tobacco Company Headquarters Building, lit up right across

the street...

INT. CBS, A SCREENING ROOM - DAY

TAIL LEADER.  THEN BLACK.  Suddenly lights come on.

Executive Producer DON HEWITT is suddenly on his feet.  A

veritable dervish, in constant motion...

Mike, used to him, ignores him, getting up, turning to leave,

Hewitt on his tail...while...

And Lowell gestures for an olive-skinned Woman in her late

thirties, Lowell's assistant, DEBBIE DELUCA, to join them.

The eye contact on the way out says there's something

important he needs to tell her...

EXT. CBS - DAY

There's a blast of NOISE.  The City.  Lowell, Wallace,

Hewitt, Debbie, enter from the CBS lobby, moving through the

reflections.  Lowell is about to say something to Debbie, but

BILL FELLING, Evening News' Assignment Editor, coming the

other way...

Midstream, fast:

EXT. 53RD STREET, NEW YORK - DAY

Lowell, crossing...

And, now, as they cross Madison...

Hewitt stops to buy a newspaper.  He doesn't have change,

Debbie does.

EXT. 55TH STREET (WESTBOUND), NEW YORK - DAY

And Mike, Lowell and Don bang into Michael's restaurant.  We

SEE them through the glass, being greeted, people shaking

their hands, escorted by the maitre d' to their table as...

INT. THE BROWN & WILLIAMSON BUILDING, MAIN LOBBY,

LOUISVILLE - DAY

Meanwhile, it's static.  Still, frozen.  Jeffrey sits in the

RECEPTION AREA of The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company

headquarters.  Complimentary cigarettes are arranged on

tables.  A dark quiet.  The hush of big business.  Standing

in the background by a wall next to the banks of elevators,

is an ever-present Man, another one, with an earphone and

lapel microphone...

He gets up, crossing to an elevator.

INT. THOMAS SANDEFUR'S OFFICE, BROWN & WILLIAMSON - DAY

THOMAS SANDEFUR is absorbed in spreadsheets of regional sales

figures.  Dark pouches are under his eyes.  He doesn't look

up.  He doesn't look healthy.  We're in a luxurious office

with a view of Louisville.  Jeffrey is waiting in a chair.

Sandefur is Brown & Williamson's CEO.  Two LAWYERS, their

briefcases, like weapons, close at hand, sit on a couch.

Their jackets are off.  They wear expensive shirts.

Surprisingly affable, Sandefur prides himself on his

salesman's sunny manners.  He has a mellifluous Georgia

accent...

Sandefur smiles, used to him.

And there's a warning behind it...

And there's a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room...

And he's acutely aware of the threat behind it...

Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney.  And we see on his

face the true nature of this man.

And with that he gets up, and leaves...  And it's quiet...

EXT. A PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY

Wigand picks up the phone and dials.

INT. THE NEW YORK RESTAURANT - DAY

They've finished lunch.  Wallace and Hewitt are turned to

talk to Sam Cohn and an older writer as suddenly Lowell's

cell phone rings.

EXT. A PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY

INT. THE NEW YORK RESTAURANT - DAY

EXT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY

And he slams down the phone.

INT. THE RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - DAY

Lowell, holding the dead phone in his hand...

EXT. A GOLF DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

We see a brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, the wet

grass under the lights vibrant, emerald green...  A caged

cart, with one big yellow headlight, like some kind of

strange insect, drives across the range, picking up golf

balls.  And we see Jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving one

after another, after another...  His swing is powerful,

angry, a lone golfer, trying to chill out.  He pauses, spent.

Settling down, he exhales.  Then, he looks down the way...

And he slows...  He sees in the far distance, spot-lit, one

other lone golfer, a Stocky Man, incongruously in a suit and

tie, watching him...  And the Man in the suit right then,

with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a

golf ball...  The ball slamming into the steel net.  And the

lights SUDDENLY go out.  The range closing for the night.

The "insect" comes to a stop.  And it's quiet, dark.  Jeffrey

gathers up his clubs.  He crosses, his golf shoes, the metal

cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the PARKING LOT.

And there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind

him.  He turns.  And the stocky Man in the suit, carrying a

golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him.

Jeffrey comes to the parking lot.  It's empty.  Just

Jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car,

purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his.  He crosses

to his car, getting in...

INT. WIGAND'S CAR - NIGHT

He drops the three clubs in the rear seat and settles behind

the wheel.  He turns.  And he sees the Man in the suit has

gotten in the car next to his.  They look at each other.  The

Man, in no hurry, lights a cigarette, relaxes.  It's

malevolent as hell.  And Jeffrey, suddenly, grabbing a golf

club, jumps out of his car...

EXT. THE PARKING LOT, DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

Golf club in hand at the driver side window...

The Man starts his car, and drives off nonplussed.  It's

still.  And as Jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty

parking lot, not knowing what's threatening him, something

real, something imaginary...

EXT. THE WIGAND HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - WIDE SHOT: WIGANDS'

HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

A violent rain's falling.  And we see Jeffrey coming out of

the house holding an umbrella over his little Girls.  They

start towards the car.  There's the sound of a car door

shutting.  Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them...

She slows, seeing someone.  Jeffrey turns:  it's Lowell.

He's surprised.

The Girls climb in the car.  Lowell crosses behind the Audi

around the far side.

Jeff closes the door on his daughters and joins Lowell around

the far side of the car.

It starts to rain harder.  They look at each other.  Jeffrey,

without saying a word, gets in the Car.  He backs out.

Lowell, left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain.

Liane goes back into the house.  And Lowell starts back

across the street to his car.  There's a sound.  He turns.

Jeffrey's car, having gone around the corner, has come back

and stopped in the street.

Lowell hesitates, then gets into the car in the back seat.

INT. WIGAND'S CAR - MORNING

They drive away.  Lowell, incongruously sitting in the back

seat with Barbara.  Jeffrey and Deborah in the front seat.

And it's quiet, just the sound of the wipers on the window.

And as Lowell rides with them...

EXT. A RIVERSIDE PARKING LOT IN LOUISVILLE - WIDE REAR SHOT

- MORNING

We see the Car's parked in a weed-strewn empty lot.  Rain,

pounding on it and the surface of the river beyond...

INT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUISVILLE - REAR TWO SHOT - MORNING

The Girls are gone.  We enter mid-scene.  Lowell's still in

the back seat...

The sound of the rain...

Wigand smiles...as their eyes meet in the rear view mirror.

A subtle connection...  It passes...

INT. WIGAND'S CAR - WIDE FRONTAL - DAY

Jeff's car in the field, the giant Colgate-Palmolive clock

behind.  The rain stopped.  Steam rises from the weed strewn

empty lot.  Lowell's in the front seat.  And we get the

feeling they've been talking for hours...

He looks at Lowell, as if needing validation...

It's quiet.  After some moments...

Jeffrey doesn't say anything.

Lowell's evenhanded...is it

contemplates the edge he's standing on, they're quiet.  Then

Wigand sees the time...

Lowell nods.  Jeffrey starts the car.  The windshield wipers

screech on a dry window.  Their eyes meet.  As they drive

off...we HOLD on the Colgate-Palmolive Clock.

INT. A KITCHEN AREA, CBS OFFICES, NEW YORK - DAY

We've entered mid-scene...  A monitor on a cart plays a 1/2-

inch VCR of a C-SPAN broadcast.  Seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...

in front of a bas relief of the American eagle.  Each in turn

swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesn't know anything

about health risks, they're not sure, maybe, maybe not,

etc....

And, now, we see Lowell, Mike Wallace and Debbie DeLuca with

two staff Lawyers, MARK STERN and JOHN HARRIS, sitting around

a workstation used as an improvised eating area.

Beyond them are the "60 MINUTES" offices, workstations, piles

of material, television monitors hanging from the ceiling,

all tuned to CBS programming...

Lowell's been quiet, thinking about something else...  Now...

Pause.

INT. A HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA, LOUISVILLE - DAY

The aftermath of a high school lunch.  Tables, covered with

litter, as far as the eye can see.  And we see Jeffrey

sitting with a formidable Black Woman in her mid-fifties, the

High School Principal, CYNTHIA WATSON, drinking cups of

coffee...

She's quiet.  She senses this applicant has a lot on his

mind.

She nods, studying him.  They get up.

INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

The house is nearly empty.  Liane, arms folded across her

chest, is quietly standing in the empty living room.  Jeffrey

comes down the stairs...

And it's quiet.  And Liane holds herself, overcome...

And they're quiet.

Liane looks at him, afraid.  And as he moves to hold her.

And instead of this downturn turning them against each other,

it brings them closer together.  And as they stand in the

empty house...

INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - DAY

We see unpacked boxes in the small 1970's kitchen.  Country-

western music is playing on a radio.  And we see Liane busily

putting things away in a cabinet.  And, then, stops and looks

out the window.  She tightens a knob on a cabinet.  There's a

moment of domestic peace for her as she sees...

EXT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, THE BACKYARD - DAY

Jeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in

the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small

tomato trellises.  We see the house, now.  It's a small, one

story.  Deborah sees her mom and waves.  It's an image from

the 1950's post-war boom.  Liane waves back from behind the

pane of glass...

INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Jeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him.

His arm is draped over her, protectively.  There's a sound.

He turns.  And he sees Barbara in her nightgown, standing in

the doorway...

Fast, soundlessly, he's out of bed into old moccasins and

trousers...

INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT

Jeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner

from the furnace, where his "office" is now.  Unpacked boxes

are on the floor.  He fumbles with the combination lock on a

small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun.

Barbara followed him.

He keeps it hidden from Barbara.  He goes up the stairs.

EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT

It's still.  He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark

shrubs and small tree in the corner.

INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT

Meanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water

heater comes on, scaring her.  She goes up the stairs to

follow after her father...

EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT

Meanwhile, Jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back

corners.  Sudden rustling.  He spins, gun ready.  And the

yellow eyes of a RACCOON stare at him.

The raccoon defiantly bares its teeth.

Jeffrey starts to go...but he sees something and stops...

Meanwhile, Barbara has come to the sliding glass door...

Jeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped

on...and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct,

fresh, deep FOOTPRINTS...

Wigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it...

EXTREMELY CLOSE ON JEFFREY, as he covers, trying to keep from

his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions...

He crosses to her, putting his arm, around her, walking her

back inside...

He locks the sliding glass door, takes a last look outside.

INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE IN BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

The Phone suddenly RINGS.  Lowell asleep, alone...  He gets

it...

INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, HALLWAY - LATE AT NIGHT

It's dark, save a light from the living room.  Liane, in bed,

seemingly sleeping.  And we see Jeffrey, just outside their

door in the foyer, sitting on the floor against a curved

wall, a drink at his side on the telephone...  A man with no

one to talk to...

INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

Lowell sits up...

INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT

INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

Lowell knows he isn't...

INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE AT NIGHT

He looks at Liane for beat.  We SEE his POV in medium shot.

Then he moves and sits on the floor in the living room.

And it's quiet again.

INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT

Lowell sitting in bed on the phone, alarmed, sharing Wigand's

fears.

INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT

And Jeffrey's emotions are back in check as...

He takes another drink...

Jeffrey's impressed by Lowell's perceptivity...

He looks at Liane in the next room, asleep.

Jeffrey hesitates, holding the phone, then he hangs up...but

the phone RINGS right away.

But there's thick silence.

They hang up.  And he realizes he's talking to a DIAL TONE.

He hangs up.  And as he sits in the patch of light from a

street lamp, the gun in his hand on his lap, to be up all

night guarding his family...

INT.  THEIR BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

And past Liane's sleeping form down the hall into the living

room is her husband, his back to her, sitting in the

trapezoid of light.  And as we DOLLY along her side, we come

upon her face and discover she's been up all along and her

eyes are pressed shut, her hands over her ears...her reaction

to his raging on the phone.  She's far from "OKAY."

INT. A JAPANESE RESTAURANT, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

And we see Lowell and Wigand sitting in their stocking feet

at a traditional Japanese table in a private screened room...

A traditionally-dressed Japanese Waitress waiting to take

their order...  Wigand conversing with her in Japanese...

The Waitress formally nods, and leaves...

And Wigand drinks some more saki.

And he's begun to consciously or unconsciously "sell"...

Wigand doesn't react.

Lowell is getting very close, in spite of the value of

Wigand, to telling Jeff to take his story and stick it up his

ass.

Wigand abruptly rises...

And turning, he crosses the restaurant.  And that's where it

hangs.

INT. A CBS EDITING SUITE, NEW YORK - DAY

And we see we're watching footage in an on-line editing bay

from what we will learn is Lowell's "N.O.P.D. Blue" on police

corruption in New Orleans.

Lowell, TONY BALDO (his editor), Debbie and an intense YOUNG

MAN wearing glasses, an Intern, looking at the cut.

Lowell is waiting for a call to go through...

INT. A LEAR JET - DAY

And we see the PILOT, a fit-looking, unassuming man, wearing

aviator glasses, in his late forties.  A heavyset Man in his

forties, riding up in the co-pilot's seat we'll come to know

as RON MOTLEY.  The Pilot's on a headset...  He has a

distinctive Southern accent...

INT. A LOUNGE, PRIVATE AVIATION TERMINAL - DAY

Through the window, we see Scruggs' plane being refueled

while Scruggs and Motley in a run-down lounge are talking on

a SPEAKER PHONE with Lowell.  They've taken over the

Secretary's office for privacy.

The phone rings.

Scruggs and Motley exchange a look...  Motley shrugs...

At this moment, these two attorneys are unsold on the

prospect of Jeffrey Wigand.  Scruggs disconnects.

INT. CBS EDITING SUITE, NEW YORK - DAY

TIGHTEN on mounted New Orleans police at crime scene, herding

crowd.

INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, KITCHEN - TWILIGHT

Liane cooking dinner, making pasta.  Ingredients, diced

tomato, basil, are neatly ordered.  She's waiting for water

to boil.  The kids are doing homework on the round table in

the kitchenette.  It's an idle moment.  She's dazed-out

watching them.

And now she hears from the basement the BELL RING on

Jeffrey's computer.  It's a tiny bell, incessant...  She

crosses to the basement stairs.

INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

Liane down the stairs, approaching Jeffrey's computer.  And

she SEES an incoming E-mail icon - a large letter with wings -

flying repetitively across the screen.

The bell RINGING is louder.  She calls-up the E-mail...  On

the screen in large RED letters:

And now Liane is shouting and running up the stairs and...

EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING

Jeffrey, having arrived home from work, pulls the mail out of

the mailbox, now stands, frozen, staring at something...  And

he sees, standing upright in the back of the mail box, like a

monument of threat, a single hollow point .38 CALIBER BULLET.

He freezes...  And simultaneously...

Liane and the Girls are running toward him...like in a bad

fucking dream.  He's looking at them.  Liane is saying

something about E-mail, but his slow-motion attention is

still arrested by the statuesque bullet.  As they close on

him...

EXT. NEW ORLEANS, THE FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT

And we see Lowell lit by FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS.  We're at a

crime scene.  Uniformed cops on horseback.  Just arrived, the

Cameraman's unloading his gear, preparing to shoot B-roll.

Police moving around as Lowell's cell phone RINGS...

INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

INT. WIGAND'S HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

And two older, local FBI AGENTS #1 and #2 are sitting with

Jeffrey in his living room...

Now one of the kids is crying, Liane trying to calm her,

takes her out of the room.

And he gets up...  They follow him into the bedroom.  He

unlocks the side drawer on his night stand, taking out a gun,

giving it to one of the Agents.

And we hear Liane's voice from downstairs...

And we see Liane following FBI Agent #3, coming up the stairs

from the basement, and the Agent is carrying Jeffrey's

computer...

Agent #3 starts out of the house with the computer followed

by #2.  Jeffrey runs out after them.

EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Agent #3 ignores him, putting the computer in the trunk of

their car.  And FBI Agent #1, the .38 bullet in a baggie,

comes out of the house.

His shoes slip on the grass and he falls.  And the FBI are

getting into their car.  And NEIGHBORS have come out,

watching them.  Liane and the girls, standing halfway down

the front lawn, the neighbors looking at them.  She and

Jeffrey look at each other.  Will she go to him or not?  She

goes to him as he rises...

EXT. NEW ORLEANS, THE FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT

And we see a Man in his early forties, a neatly-dressed man

who prides himself on his appearance, at his desk in the

Bureau (FBI).  BILL ROBERTSON.  He's completely distracted,

focused on agent travel orders...

INT. BILL ROBERTSON'S OFFICE, WASHINGTON - NIGHT

He hangs up.

INT. DINING ROOM, THE FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, NEW YORK - NIGHT

And we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto Lowell and

Mike Wallace with Jeffrey and Liane in the Hotel's dining

room, having ordered dinner.

And she laughs...

But she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the

dining room.  And Jeffrey oddly doesn't move.

Jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby Bar.

And Lowell leaves the table.  And as Mike Wallace sits at the

table, looking around, wondering what the fuck he's doing

there.

INT. THE BATHROOM, NEW YORK HOTEL - NIGHT

Liane folds her arms protectively across her chest...

INT. A STUDIO, CBS - MORNING

And we see a small TAPING STUDIO separated by flats and black

curtains from other CBS News sets.  Cameras are set up.

INT. THE STUDIO, CBS - DAY

And we enter mid-scene on Jeffrey in a more formal demeanor,

sitting in a chair, Mike Wallace sitting across from him,

under the lights, taping an interview.  Lowell, off camera.

Lowell's reaction.  Jeffrey's statements are stunning and

powerful revelations...and dangerous ones to make.

INT. THE STUDIO, CBS - LATER

INT. A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS, LOUISVILLE - AFTERNOON

Not too many kids paying attention.  Meanwhile, Jeffrey has

written his name on the blackboard.

Nobody raises their hands.

A couple of laughs...  And we feel Jeffrey, for the first

time is in a milieu that suits him.

INT. SCRUGGS' OFFICE

Scruggs' office is decorated with watercolors of Phantom jets

and A-6s as Scruggs takes off his glasses...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR

Jeffrey Wigand is on a pay phone in the corridor crowded with

students...

INT. SCRUGGS' OFFICE

EXT. WIGAND'S HOUSE #2, LOUISVILLE - TWILIGHT

Jeffrey drives up the block and onto his driveway.  Seeing a

MAN in a suit, an ear piece in his ear, disappearing around

the corner of his house, Jeffrey leaps out of the car.  But

the front door's open.  So instead of chasing after, he runs

inside...

INT. THE WIGAND'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY/TWILIGHT

And he sees another Man is in the living room...

And he sees Lowell enter from the dining room...

Wigand catches his breath.

And Wigand looks at Lowell...  Barbara comes into the living

room and holds onto her father's leg.

She goes over and holds his hand.  And as he holds her hand,

seeing what his life has become, he looks up and his glance

connects with Lowell...

INT. THE KITCHEN, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

We see out the window a Security Guard, incongruous, walking

by.  And we see Liane, finished with the dinner dishes,

silently wiping off the sink.  There's a pall you could cut

with a knife.  A moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen

door from the garden...  He stops to wash his hands in the

sink.

But he ignores her, washing his hands...  And she turns the

water off.  He turns it back on.  He thinks, then turns it

off.  Then

And she turns and leaves the room, coldly, all her anger

repressed.  For Jeffrey, everything else and now this?  The

running faucet.

EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT

The house on the quiet suburban street.  A Security Guard,

incongruous, a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster

is, sitting watch under the porch light on the small front

porch in a metal porch chair.

INT. THE BASEMENT, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

And we see Jeffrey, unable to sleep, sitting at his desk,

alone in the basement, listening to classical music.  He

instinctively turns.  And he sees Liane, in her bathrobe, has

come down to sit on the basement stairs.  He looks over at

her.  And he thinks she's come down to make up.  And all she

really wants him to do is say, "I need you..."  But he

can't...  And like ships that pass in the night, nothing's

said.  It's quiet.  She puts her hands protectively in her

robe pockets.  And she starts to cry...

She goes back up the stairs.  And as Jeffrey sits in the

basement, and the music plays.

INT. THE LOUISVILLE AIRPORT - DAY

We see Jeffrey and his Security Man.  He passes a small

Filipino Woman in a nurse's uniform and a Man in clerical

garb, who hands him a small American Flag, asking for

donations.  And, now, he passes through the metal detector.

He nods thanks and walks towards us, relaxing, looking behind

every so often to see if anybody is following him.  As he

passes Gate 3, he HEARS over his shoulder...

Jeffrey turns and the Man throws a sheaf of SUBPOENAS at his

chest...

And he turns and walks off.  And as Jeffrey looks down at the

subpoenas...

INT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' KITCHEN - 7:00 A.M.

Jeffrey is sitting with Scruggs and Motley in Scruggs'

kitchen around a semi-circular counter.  Coffee and sweet

rolls.  It's casual.  No one's dressed for court.  Scruggs

has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas.  About

Motley, we sense power held in reserve.

Meanwhile, a movie-star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a

tie, a coffee cup in his hand, enters and sits casually on

the arm of a chair.

And Jeffrey fairly turns white, it's never occurred to him he

might go to jail...

He leaves.  And Jeffrey's quiet, frightened.  Having shaken

the departing Moore's hand, he now turns away from Scruggs

and Motley, thinking about consequences.

Jeffrey's skeptical

EXT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

A white, traditional, Southern house, with a veranda and

gables...a large front lawn with weeping willows.  And we see

Lowell, hands in his pockets, not an insider or an outsider,

waiting alone on the expansive lawn.  The front door opens.

A Mississippi State Trooper, putting on his round brimmed hat

comes out and crosses the driveway.  Then Jeffrey coming out

with Motley.  Motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment

and then heads towards his car.  Meanwhile, Jeffrey comes

down over to Lowell on the lawn.

And Jeffrey looks off, across the street from the house, at

the Gulf.  And we see the street is blockaded by Mississippi

State Police cars.  An armed camp.  Other men in suits,

Lawyers and state officials, wait.  Ron Motley gets in his

car and drives away.

And they're quiet, a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their

coats...  He looks out at the water, a cargo container ship

passing by.  He watches its slow progress...

And Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands

in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking...  And

Richard Scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside

Lowell...

EXT. COURTHOUSE, CANTY STREET, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI -

DAY

Motley's car parks, and he and an Assistant are approached by

a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us, crossing

Canty Street to intercept him.  And we SEE the lot is jammed

with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to

the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers.  Some hang out

by their cars, killing time.  It's a tailgate party.  Beyond

them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the

media circus.  They're all here for Jeff's deposition.  The

scale of it dwarfs the plebeian storefront with its sign

"Temporary Jackson County Courthouse"...into which Motley

enters...

EXT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

Jeffrey contemplating.

INT. COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

One TOBACCO LAWYER, an Edward Bennett-type while waiting is

on his cell phone...

JR. LAWYER crosses to Motley.

EXT. SCRUGGS' HOUSE, DOCK - DAY

Jeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea.  Trying to

decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence.  A

moment.  He turns, crossing to Lowell and Scruggs.  Then.

it's the three men, standing on the lawn.  Time seems to

slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally

and historically...

They're quiet.  Jeffrey, getting nowhere.  Lowell offers...

Long pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future.  And

something just got resolved.  He asks Lowell, rhetorically...

Nothing's changed.  Wigand looks at them.  He found his own

answer.

And Dick Scruggs and Lowell look at this normal, somewhat

flawed, very courageous man...

And there's a sudden flurry of activity.  Jeffrey and Scruggs

walk to a Mississippi State Police car.  Lowell gets into his

car and drives away, separately.  Police, State Officials,

run to their cars.  Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's

car pulls into position.

INT. SCRUGGS' CAR - JEFFREY - DAY

in the back seat with Scruggs.  The driver's a State

Policeman.  Jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots, old

buildings, a 1930's Deco school pass by.  It's all

heightened, especially vivid to his eyes somehow.  And he

exhales heavily to calm himself, to focus...

EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

Some of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging

across Canty Street by their cars.  And now they see the

police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards

the courthouse.  The caravan stops.  First, Scruggs gets out.

A moment, then Jeffrey appears.  And the Reporters pounce on

Jeffrey, cameras flashing...Mississippi Police leading him

through the crowd...  Moore appears at courtroom door

(already there).  And as he's whisked away into the

courtroom.

INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

The tobacco lawyers become dead quiet.  Cell phones are hung

up.  Newspapers are put away.  Jackets are donned.  This is

now very serious business.  Motley meets Jeffrey, all eyes on

him.

Motley calmly motions Wigand to take a chair.  He settles in.

He spells it for them...

EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

Lowell, waiting with the other journalists...

INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

Motley still conducting the inquiry...  And the tobacco

lawyers, like a pack of dogs, waiting to pounce...

EXT. THE SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - NIGHT

Lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain.  There's

a slight sound.  He turns.  And Jeffrey's come outside.  He

stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain

and windswept trees.  They're quiet.  They share a look.

They nod to each other.  The smallest nod of accomplishment.

And they're there on the porch, alone, outside the house in

Pascagoula, Mississippi.

INT. CBS EDITING ROOM, NEW YORK - AFTERNOON

We see Lowell, unusually buoyant in the same clothes as

yesterday.  He's working with Tony Baldo on a cut of the

show, the net result of his architecture of events, his

combination of persuasion and integrity...

We see on the Avid monitor a single of Jeffrey...

Widen to include Debbie DeLuca, the Intern, two other

Editors, Felling.  They have gathered behind Lowell in the

doorway.  This is a

among Lowell's co-workers.  And while Baldo cuts, we see...

INT. CBS, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EDITING ROOM - DAY

...the group has spilled out the doorway, watching Lowell's

story come together.  Beyond them, approaching, is Mike

Wallace, coming to work...

People separate as Mike pushes in.  Lowell sees Mike.  While

Tony Baldo is making the edits on the Avid...

Don Hewitt enters from the corridor without jacket.

Baldo now runs Lowell's edit of the above sequence.  And we

SEE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT.

Sandefur in CLOSE-UP states "I believe that nicotine is not

addictive."  Wigand in matching CLOSE-UP states "I believe he

perjured himself."  Then all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco stand

up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of

Congress to tell the truth while Wallace says "...the whole

line of people, the whole line of CEO's up there, all

swearing that."  And Wigand says off-screen with great

emphasis "Part of the reason I'm here is I FELT"...and it

cuts to Wigand for a pause that makes the word "FELT" resound

and, then, he goes on to say on-camera "that their

representation clearly

We're a nicotine delivery business."  We see the combination

of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity

that's stirring and beautiful...

EXT. LOUISVILLE - DUSK

We see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown

Louisville.

INT. THE RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

It's Jeffrey in the front seat, driven by one of his security

men.  He's coming home under the cover of darkness.  They

pass a FLAMING CAR on the freeway shoulder.  Jeffrey turns to

stare at it.  They turn off onto city streets and stop at a

light.  Jeffrey's nervous.  Jeffrey instinctively turns.  A

Police Car stops alongside.  The Policeman looks at him.

Eyes meet.  Jeffrey looks away.  The signal takes forever.

It changes.  And as the Police Car moves off...

EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

The car's stopped at the curb.  Jeffrey gets out.  He starts

up the walk, and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses

the lawn to intercept him...

And Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home...

INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is quiet, dark.  Too quiet.  Too dark.  Something

isn't right.  He crosses to one of the children's rooms...the

master bedroom.  The lights are on.  Both rooms are empty.

He goes into the kitchen and sees a note that's been left for

him...  He opens it.  He sits heavily in a chair, reading the

note.  The Security Guard peers...  And as Jeffrey sits in

the silent house, the hero come home...

INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM, CBS - DAY

We're at a table.  Mike and Lowell laugh at some joke while

HELEN CAPERELLI, CBS GENERAL COUNSEL, enters with the

President of CBS News, ERIC KLUSTER.

Also there is Don Hewitt.  Caperelli is too well put

together, too practiced, too polished.

They nod.  They don't need coffee.

Whatever that means...

And Lowell hears a changed note in Wallace's voice.  After a

beat.

As if on cue, the alarm on Helen Caperelli's watch beeps.

She glances at it.

She gets up, gathering her things.

And taking up her briefcase, she leaves.  Don and Mike rise.

Lowell finds himself angry and alone.  He crosses to the

window and pulls out his cell phone and goes to work.

INT. CBS, HEWITT'S OFFICE - DAY

Hewitt's on an unrelated call.  Lowell crosses to look out

the window, a manila folder (the filing) under his arm with

whatever he found out, like a bomb, feels distant from these

people.  The door opens, and Eric Kluster, the President of

CBS News enters...

Hewitt hangs up the phone.

Lowell's stunned.  He looks like he's been hit with a

hammer...

As they start to leave...

And Lowell takes out...

And there it is.

EXT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - AFTERNOON

We see Sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard...

She turns, seeing him standing behind her...

After a moment.  She knows.

And the phone RINGS...  Sharon goes in the house to get it...

She comes back out...

INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON

INT. A HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

And we see Wigand looking rough, unshaven, sitting on a couch

in a hotel room.  And we see his belongings, clothing, some

boxes, a bottle of vodka, his computer, what's left of his

world, are around the room.

INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON

And Lowell's dead quiet.

INT. THE HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

And we don't know what he means by that...

INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON

The last of the daylight shadows his office.

Lowell's quiet.  And Jeffrey starts to hang up...

And Jeffrey hangs up.

INT. JEFFREY'S HOTEL ROOM, LOUISIANA - (PROCESS) - NIGHT

Jeffrey silently sitting in the chair.  We COME AROUND and

see why he's been purposely sitting there.  Why he's chosen

this room.  Directly across the street is the Brown &

Williamson Building.  The lights are on.  The building lit

up.  And in an upstairs office Brown & Williamson lawyers,

moving around a conference room, talking.  And as Jeffrey

looks out the window...

EXT. A SMALL TOWN, UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY

A peaceful, suburban street.  Small houses.  A PRIVATE

INVESTIGATOR (P.I.) from IGI, in a raincoat, getting out of a

car, going up the walk.  He knocks on the door.  Some

moments.  A Woman in her late forties, handicapped, in an

electric cart answers the door...

INT. JOHN SCANLON'S PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM, A MEDIA ROOM,

NEW YORK - DAY

And on a TELEVISION SCREEN, SUSAN WIGAND, the woman in the

electric cart, giving a taped interview to the P.I....

We PULL BACK to see John Scanlon and his Staff watching the

tape...  His firm's logo, public relations campaigns for some

of his high-profile clients are on the walls.  Scanlon's on

the phone talking with somebody as the tape runs...

He stops, listening to the videotape...

And as we end in a sea of documents, affidavits, court

records, all from Louisville, all about Jeffrey.  We

understand the war has only been begun...

INT. CBS, "60 MINUTES," CORRIDOR, LOWELL'S OFFICE - MORNING

Lowell, in his office, his door open for anyone to see him,

an immovable force, sitting behind his desk.  Hewitt appears

in his doorway...

Hewitt looks at him...

And he gives him a copy of it.

He turns and starts off along the hall.  As he goes...

Lowell watches him walk away.  Debbie enters.

INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, HIGH SCHOOL, LOUISVILLE - DAY

And Wigand is in the phone booth at the High

School...students walking by...

His voice carries, a student looks over...

INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

And he realizes he's said it too loud, a couple of passing

students stop, looking at him...

INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, CBS - DAY

INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Wigand's quiet.  He looks out the phone booth.  After some

moments...

INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY

INT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

And we'll go back and forth...

And we see, unbeknownst to Wigand, the P.I. in the raincoat,

who interviewed his ex-wife, coming out of an administration

office, walking towards us along the hallways...

The P.I. in the raincoat passes Jeffrey, now, and doesn't

even glance at him...

And Wigand's quiet, a deep, dark depression.  The school bell

RING snaps him out of it...

Wigand's quiet.

And he SLAMS the phone down.  And as he stands in the phone

booth, like a man in a glass booth, all alone...

EXT. CBS BUILDING, ROOFTOP - DAY

ON the door to the roof.  It SLAMS open.  An enraged Lowell

enters and walks out into the cold rain.  Like a prize-

fighter, shoulders hunched against the cold, he buries his

hands in his jacket pockets.  He crosses to the edge of the

roof high above the city.  He's pissed off.  He takes out his

cell phone.  He dials...  Lowell hears background NOISE...

INT.

Twenty sub-editors and section heads sit and stand in a clear

area...  One of them, a large man, is CHARLIE PHILLIPS on a

cell phone.

INT. A PHONE BOOTH, NEW YORK - NIGHT

A busy New York street.  Light mist.  And we see Lowell is on

the phone in a phone booth...

INT. A HOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

A townhouse with a commanding view of the Bay.  And we see a

broad-shouldered man in his late forties sitting at a desk on

the phone.  JACK PALLADINO.  His wife, SANDRA SUTHERLAND,

sitting across from him on another phone.  They're Private

Investigators...

Palladinos exchange looks; she nods.

Lowell hangs up and walks towards us to enter...

INT. BAR - NIGHT

CLOSE on Lowell entering, moving through the crowd of sports

writers, feature writers, sub-editors, etc.  He comes upon a

rugged-featured man, JIM COOPER from

sitting next to Charlie.

Lowell looks at Cooper quizzically.

Just then Jim's wife enters.  They exchange greetings.

Cooper and his wife leave.  Charlie and Lowell are

the crowded bar.

That's the way it lays.  In a different, personal tone...

INT. A COFFEE SHOP, LOUISVILLE - DAY

And we see a Policeman sitting at the counter having a cup of

coffee...

He turns as Sandra Sutherland sits at the counter to the left

of him.

INT. COURTROOM, LOUISVILLE - LATE AFTERNOON

An older Man is on the bench.  He's just recessed his court.

As everybody streams out, going against the tide is Jack

Palladino.  He approaches the judge, crossing to a side

door...

INT. A COFFEE SHOP, LOUISVILLE - DAY

INT. EDITING ROOM, CBS - DAY

Lowell's destroying his own work product, taking apart his

creation that we saw earlier to be so impactful.  Tony gets a

call as Hewitt enters.

INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE - EVENING

A suitcase is on the floor.  Lowell, finishing packing up his

things from his office.

And he sees Wallace has stopped at his door...

Wallace waves Lowell's remark aside and exits.  We dwell on

Lowell until he exits...

INT. CBS CORRIDOR - EVENING

...into the hall.  Dan Rather introduced Mike.  As Lowell

exits, we SEE Hewitt, Kluster and Caperelli outside of

Hewitt's office watching...  Lowell, disgusted,

Lowell turns to see Wallace shouting up at the monitors in

disbelief...

Wallace moves in on Kluster...

It was a big mistake.  Now, he turns on her.  Zeroing in,

getting closer...

EXT. THE EAST RIVER - NIGHT

A Range Rover pulls up.  Charlie Phillips gets out.  He

crosses to Lowell who's been waiting by his own taxi.

He hands Charlie a folder with the brown notebook inside that

is the partially complete Palladino/Sutherland/Lowell work

product.

Charlie starts looking through the Palladino/

Sutherland/Lowell work product.  Meanwhile...

INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, KITCHEN - DAY

INT. A BAR, LOUISVILLE - DAY

And we see Jeffrey in a quiet Bar.  The television's on, the

sound low, the midday news.  As Jeffrey looks up and sees his

photograph on TELEVISION.  In his LOCAL WORLD the impact is:

And Jeffrey looks as if something just detonated inside of

him.

WE'RE LOOKING AT MIKE WALLACE SITTING IN FRONT OF A BACKDROP

ON "60 MINUTES," ON A TELEVISION...

INT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

And Jeffrey sitting alone in the hotel, watching the show...

Lowell silently watching the broadcast...

INT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

Jeffrey, watching the show...

And all we can hear is an ELECTRONICALLY-ALTERED VOICE and

the BLANKED-OUT image of a man...

Jeffrey, motionless...  A man, no longer with a

television...

INT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT, LATER

Wallace, hasn't moved, still in his chair.  He stares,

ignoring the CBS programming, on the phone, making a call...

EXT. THE CARIBBEAN BEACH - NIGHT

Lowell, walking up the sand, his cell phone rings.

The look on Wallace's face says he thinks so, too.  It's

obvious.  He hangs up the phone.

EXT. LOWELL'S BUNGALOW, THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

Lowell is on the phone, now.  The moon lights the water, the

empty beach.  He listens as a phone, through STATIC, RINGS

and RINGS and RINGS.

INT. WIGAND'S HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

And we hear the phone RINGING.  We slowly PAN across the

hotel room.  We see on the floor a pair of men's tasseled

loafers...  A discarded sport jacket...  And we see Jeffrey,

barefoot, sitting in a chair in the center of the room.  He's

looking out the window at B&W.  The curtains are blowing...

And he's still...  The sound of the phone RINGING and

RINGING...

EXT. THE BEACH, THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

INT. THE HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

A thin Man answers the phone.

INT.  THE HOTEL CORRIDOR, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

And we see the Hotel Manager, walking along with a Security

Guard, and now

And when there is no response, the Manager nods to the

Security Guard, the Guard using a pass key, unlocking the

door.  But the door stops, the chain-lock drawn.  The Manager

looks in through the chain...and he can see Jeffrey sitting

in the chair...

Jeffrey's still.  The Manager quickly takes a cell phone from

the Security Guard.

EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

Lowell, standing on the beach anxiously waiting.

INT. THE HOTEL CORRIDOR, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

Jeffrey's quiet.

EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

Lowell goes deeper into the water.

INT. WIGAND'S HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

And now the walls behind MORPH into a green daytime garden,

the garden behind his house.  And as we DOLLY AROUND Wigand,

more walls MORPH into the side yard, and, turning slowly, he

sees Barbara and Deborah in the emerald-green grass.  They

stop and smile, then they stare at us, at their father.  And

he looks at his children, at an idyll lost...  The chair, the

man are the only real objects left in the view from inside

his head...

EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - NIGHT

Lowell anxiously moves along the beach, trying to be heard,

the phone chattering with static...

INT. THE HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

And even he's surprised by his language.  And suddenly

Jeffrey gets up, unlatches the door, grabs the phone from the

Hotel Manager.  Wigand in the hotel corridor, Lowell standing

knee-deep in the water...

CLOSE ON JEFFREY:  standing in the room with the blowing

curtains...

And for the first time, Wigand smiles.

And the grave situation passes.

INT. THE CARIBBEAN BUNGALOW - DAY/NIGHT

Sharon's cooking across the room...  And there's just the

sound of the ceiling fan turning.

And as the fan squeaks, turning...  Lowell stares at Sharon.

WE SEE SNOW IS ON THE GROUND.

EXT. LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

Between two curved colonnades of SNOW-covered trees drives a

rental car.  CLOSER, it's Lowell.  His POV spots a dirty SUV

and he pulls into park across from a coffee shop in this out-

of-context mountain town.  His pager beeps.  He looks at it.

He detours from the coffee shop to a pay phone on the corner

of the Moose Lodge.

INT. A COURTROOM + ROTUNDA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

And we see the back of a crowded courtroom.  Richard Scruggs

is standing in the rear amongst bailiffs an witnesses,

talking on his own cell phone.

Waiting media are relaxing as Scruggs continues to Lowell...

Sudden STATIC.  Scruggs now exits the building, past the

metal detector, seeking better reception.

EXT. COURTHOUSE STAIRS, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

And the courthouse doors suddenly burst open, Michael Moore

and his attorneys coming out.  Scruggs comes further down the

steps so he can hear, away from Michael Moore who begins

answering questions from the Press.

EXT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

INT. CAFE, LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

Lowell walks right in and up to a booth and a COUPLE in

hiking pants and hiking boots.  They look up at him...

And we sense something is all wrong here.

Lowell nods.  They look at each other and they both know

there's a lot more than meets the eye.  And as Lowell gets up

and leaves...

EXT. A PAY PHONE, LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

And we see Lowell on the PAY PHONE again.

INT. THE FBI, BILL ROBERTSON'S OFFICE, WASHINGTON - DAY

And we see Bill Robertson's on the phone...

EXT. THE PAY PHONE, LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY

INT. LOWELL'S ROOM, MOTEL, MONTANA - NIGHT

Lowell is in a T-shirt and sweat pants, sitting in an old, re-

upholstered-one-too-many-times chair in a room barely big

enough for a chair, a bed and the TV/VCR combo on the cheap

dresser.  It's playing Lowell's cut of the full Wigand

interview.  He watches the show that will never see the light

of day.

Then it cuts to all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco raising their

hands and taking the oath in front of Congress to tell the

truth while...

And the PAUSE after the word makes "FELT" resound, and as it

CUTS TO Jeffrey ON CAMERA saying...

And Lowell FREEZES after the image...  He gets up, looking

out the window through the curtain with the spill from the

neon motel sign.  Outside are horse trailers.  He goes back

to watching the show...standing there...in touch with his

own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in

this decision-making process that we feel is critical to him.

Turning, he dials the phone and we intercut with...

INT.

Lowell hangs up.  Re-dials.

INT. DEBBIE DELUCA'S APARTMENT - NEW YORK - LATE NIGHT

Debbie answers, intercutting with above...

INT.

Jim Cooper's workstation.  His phone rings.  He grabs it.

INT. MOTEL, LINCOLN, MONTANA - NIGHT

No answer.

MOVING CLOSER into the face of Lowell.  His gaze falters.

His eyes go back to the motel TV mutely frozen on the show.

Whatever he's seeing there, his gaze is steadfast.

EXT. STREET, NEW YORK - 5:30 A.M.

Newspaper box is loaded with

EXT. HOTEL, NEW YORK - 5:30 A.M.

Cab pulls to curb and a raincoated Man emerges.  We SEE he

carries a copy of this morning's

INT. A HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK - DAWN

A suitcase is half-unpacked on the floor...a sleeping

figure...  There's a knock.  Irritated, a sleeping Lowell

gets up to answer it.  He looks through the security peep

hole.  He opens it.  And Mike Wallace, a newspaper under his

arm, is standing in the doorway.

There's an awkward quiet.  Mike enters.  He slows, looks

around.

He trails off.  They look at each other.

And the look on Wallace's face is "It did.  Whether it should

or should not...what difference does that make?  It did."

And we realize only now that he has not come to argue.

And he gives Lowell a copy of

Lowell looks down at the page.  The headline is "'60 MINUTES'

ORDERED TO PULL INTERVIEW IN TOBACCO REPORT."

Turning, he walks out and down the hallway.  Lowell looks at

the newspaper.

INT. THE COMMUTER HELICOPTER - MORNING

The helicopter approaching Manhattan.  John Scanlon sitting

with Hewitt, both of them reading

Wigand article.

INT. COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK - MORNING

Lowell at a table littered with

Daily News

INT. A CITY BUS, NEW YORK - MORNING

Broadway backgrounds streak past Debbie DeLuca's head as she

rides, talking on a cell phone,

her hand.

Debbie hits "call waiting."

INT. COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK - MORNING

EXTREMELY CLOSE Lowell.

EXT. STREET, NEW YORK - MORNING

As Lowell hails a cab in a WIDE ANGLE and runs towards us,

jumping into the cab...

INT. DON HEWITT'S OFFICE - DAY

We PULL BACK and we see that Lowell's with Hewitt in Hewitt's

office...

And Hewitt, looking around.

And Don's taken off stride...

Lowell looks at Wallace.

INT. A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS, LOUISVILLE - AFTERNOON

Jeff is in front of his class, teaching...

INT. LAX - ECU:  LOWELL - NIGHT

Tired, his suitcase at his feet.  We don't know if he's

coming or going.  He's at a pay phone in the more-deserted-

than-not airport.

He hangs up and ambles over to a lounge with a few travellers

sitting in it.

INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S APARTMENT, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

A small apartment.  Jeffrey dishes out second helpings of

pasta primavera into two pasta plates and brings them into

the kitchenette to his girls, Deborah and Barbara.  And now

we SEE AND HEAR the small television on the table playing "60

Minutes" and...

Deborah looks proudly at her father.

Wigand's gotten up and gone out of the kitchenette.  He has

stopped for a moment around the corner in the hallway.  His

kids can't see him.  We can.  And he watches them and his

eyes get shiny and start to tear.  And as he stands there,

watching his girls at the kitchen table witnessing their

father's hard-earned "truth" on television, we realize that

of all the audiences, his girls are the one he cares about

most...

INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE

And Lowell in his moment of victory is watching his "60

Minutes" double segment on a departure lounge television with

his feet resting on his suitcase, next to a Chicano woman

with two kids and her mother and an older man with a beard

and cane.  An airport cleaner stops to watch, too.  Lowell

glances at him...

Unbeknownst to these viewers, arrested by the content on the

television screen, is that the man who made it sits casually

among them, watching his work.

INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, BERKELEY - NIGHT

Sharon sits at the kitchen table.  She watches in a far

corner a small countertop television.  It's "60 Minutes," the

full show entitled "Jeffrey Wigand, Ph.D." and on the top

right, "PRODUCED BY LOWELL BERGMAN."  As Sharon continues

watching the television playing on the counter, the emotional

currents within her remaining unrevealed...

INT. MIKE WALLACE'S STUDY - ON MIKE WALLACE - NIGHT

watching the show.  He sees himself...

Wallace, satisfied, rises to refill his glass, as...

INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE

Lowell watching show in airport.

INT. A SURVEILLANCE VAN, LINCOLN, MONTANA - NIGHT

And we see the FBI Agent, BILL ROBERTSON on the phone.

INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - NIGHT

And he quietly hangs up.  And it's still.  Sharon's laid

down, closing her eyes.  They lie close together.  After some

moments, she opens her eyes and lets us know what she's been

thinking...

This time he isn't droll.

There's an odd look on his face, not the look of a victor.

He shuts off the light.  And as they lie close together in

the dark in each other's arms...

WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FAMILIAR CBS EYE ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.

AND THEN THE WORDS:  "SPECIAL REPORT."

INT. MASTER CONTROL ROOM, CBS - DAY

Lowell, entering through machine rooms, into a state-of-the-

art Master Control Room.  On a wall are fifty or more

monitors, in the humidity-and-temperature-controlled nexus of

CBS operations.  And it's jammed with people, witnessing a

fast-breaking, major news event.  Mike Wallace stands near

Felling.  Lowell crosses past Felling and stands next to Mike

Wallace.

And we see footage of a handcuffed, bearded, barefoot

Man...THEODORE KACZYNSKI, the UNABOMBER, being taken in by

the FBI.  A director counts down.  Dan Rather launches...

Mike motions Lowell out into the corridor so they can be

alone.

INT. CORRIDOR, CBS - DAY

The control room and crowd are seen through the glass wall.

After some moments:

Mike nods...  Lowell puts his hands in his jacket pockets...

After some moments...

Mike's startled.

Lowell shakes his head "no."

They look at each other.  Lowell says to Mike, intimately,

what he knows Mike knows...

Lowell's heartfelt regret.  He starts to leave.  They look at

each other.

And Lowell moves off along the hallway, the monitors all

showing CBS programming.  He doesn't even look back...
