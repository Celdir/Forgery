NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS

AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR

THIS SOFT COPY.

PROLOGUE:  INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. EVENING.

Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film,

sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates

around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING.

Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano.

CREDITS begin.

The song finishes.  Applause.  They're the entertainment at a

cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.

Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A

distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair,

approaches Ripley, offers his hand.

INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an

elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.

Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into

his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley

crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him

his share of their fee.

From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing.

From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets

into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.

EXT. THEATER. EVENING.

Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and

heads for the theater. Music continues.

INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.

themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers

towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and

through him.  Put coins in a bowl.

INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT

The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at

the performances.  A haughty woman in the box turns round and

he closes the curtain.

INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.

An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue

ghostlight.  A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on

the house lights.  Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves

apologetically.

EXT. GREENLEAF SHIPYARDS, BROOKLYN. DAY.

Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks.  A

huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers

preparing the shell of a new liner.  If Central Park is where

the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made.  And a

lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name

over the buildings behind them.

Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a

sober young man, listens attentively.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.

mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides

into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's

Champ

man's face it is

undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.

The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of

the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses

to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.

A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered

table which includes classical sheet music and a paper

keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.

Chet Baker's

packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this

bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows

give onto bars and a wall.

There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He

flinches.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing

himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:

Charlie Parker's

track.

He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's

right, he smiles.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a

Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up

his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment

before closing the door behind him.

EXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.

He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's

chauffeur.

INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY.

Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He

opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.

Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks

and dollars.

EXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY.

The liner leaves New York en route to Italy.  END CREDITS.

INT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS & IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY.

ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.

Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.

Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,

escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been

unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall

under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS

OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks

and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around

them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants

his name.

and joins the crowd around the letter

woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.

Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a

line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith

catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.

Ripley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the

passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse.

They are passed through immigration, head down the long

stairs towards the street.  Meredith catches up with Ripley.

They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs

explain the choices: one way for

other for

different directions.

EXT. COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON.

A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a

cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.

INT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON.

Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a

new town. People get off.

INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on

their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind

down through a square, passing the local church.

EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY.

And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side

there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men

working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the

street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on

their Vespas. The Driver chants -

Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on

its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign.

EXT. MIRAMARE HOTEL/BOAT AT SEA. MORNING.

A SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops

the sail.  A couple dive off and swim towards shore.

ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's

watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony

in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched

on his knees and, during this, he continues his study,

mouthing the Italian words.

Her partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown,

beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat:

"BIRD".

The golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the

water, grins.

He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book.

EXT. MONGIBELLO. DAY.

Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on

the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY

LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys

turn laconically and watch him.

Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels

ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies.

Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes

and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness

of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up

to Dickie.

Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.

He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.  Ripley

stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up.

EXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING.

ANOTHER DAY.  Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in

shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square

on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps.

RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches

all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty,

SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then

climbs on the scooter, behind him.

And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards

the sea.

EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.

Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of

the remnants of lunch.  Dickie's sheepish, showered, late.

As Ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes.

Marge flicks him with a napkin. They start to wrestle,

excluding Tom.

INT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK.

A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring

out of Church for the

in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are

compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.

Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's

scheming.

SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her

fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal

FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise

there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.

Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.

EXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON.

Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front

door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of

which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his

fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom

talking with Dickie.

He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the

seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He

bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps.

Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles.

INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast

out their version of

make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with

friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts

introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.  Dickie is

instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.

An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses

Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for

her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his

cigarette.  Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's

clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to

vuo' fa' L'Americano

for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie

up onto the stage.

Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody

claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.

Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls

him up.  The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's

Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can

sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience

is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.

INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NOON.

Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table,

typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which

he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.

Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis.

INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY.

Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a

comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only

to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.

INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the

Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out

shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,

cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and

walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where

lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of

conversation float up to Ripley.

Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing

the cadences,

until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.

EXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY.

Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and

sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the

coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he

uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his

pants, his rings.

EXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY.

The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a

manoeuvre going on with the sail.  Captain Dickie supervises

his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please

Ripley.  Dickie goes over to help him.

She heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley.

EXT. MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down

the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the

little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.

They've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman

who owns the store greets them.  Silvana, who's her daughter,

is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's

order.

Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns.

At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men

throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a

small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and

two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.

Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce

en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him.

EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. EARLY EVENING.

Dickie and Ripley are leaving.  They're fooling around.

Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the

top of the garden.

EXT. MONGIBELLO SQUARE. EARLY EVENING.

Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's

grocery store.  Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's

tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated.

And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him

then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.

EXT. COASTAL ROAD TO NAPLES. EVENING.

Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where

the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains

speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.

INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of

Valentine

playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous

applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.

INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living

room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a

couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through

his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.

He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines.

Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard.

Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean

them. Dickie looks at him.

Dickie cuffs him.  Ripley looks down at the postcard.

INT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.

Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next

to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the

board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the

water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a

burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.

He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long.

He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But

Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie

turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with

his towel.

INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY.

An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's

not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie

is used to it.

He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case

with his initials prominently embossed.  Ripley watches him

sign and collect a large wad of notes.

Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he

holds up one letter to Dickie.

INT. TRAIN TO ROME. DAY.

Ripley sits reading the LETTER from Herbert Greenleaf.  He

frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window.

Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".

EXT. ARCARI'S CAFE, PIAZZA NAVONA, ROME. DAY.

Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.

Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd.  There are

already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of

Frascati.  Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly

impatient. Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the

duration.

Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A

horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his

open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and

bustles over.  He's a heavy-set American with a reddish

crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at. Dickie is

delighted.

They kiss cheeks, continental-style.

He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.

And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny

checks to work out the bill and pay it.

Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the

street to Freddie's car.

Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He

has to crouch in the rear.

INT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON.

This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and

stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the

stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.  There are two

LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed

into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside

the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,

while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.

He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.

Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the

accordion doors.

Ripley hands him the coats, turns away.

Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the

booth.  Dickie pushes it open.

EXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON.

Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's

looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then

he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This

is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by

antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't

alone.

INT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT.

It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of

the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving

up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his

compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.

INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May I". Very loud.

Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED

AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair,

catches one of Dickie's expressions.  There are clothes

abandoned everywhere.  He's been having a big dressing-up

session. He sings along with Bing.

Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the

doorway.  The music thumps away.

Dickie turns off the record player.

Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with

mortification and shock.  Dickie looks at his feet, shakes

his head.

Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the

dressing-up session, not amused.

EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. DAY.

Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and

Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks

perfectly happy.

EXT. THE OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DAY.

The boat is drifting.  Freddie and Dickie and Marge are

swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley

is sitting alone, reading.

She approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a

red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak.

They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water.

There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.

They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.

EXT. OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DUSK.

LATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in

his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller.

Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie

makes a face at Freddie.

Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the

tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the

water.

From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but

he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering

him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of

flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves,

he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then

Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted

toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely

betrayed.

Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting

before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.

EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY.

The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as

ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting

instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley

looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.

Dickie notices her too.

EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY.

A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.

It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with

flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden,

staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,

wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their

shoulders.

The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual

Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their

fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and

altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from

Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is

carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,

the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is

walking on water.

Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,

about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from

among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.

One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the

direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.

It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the

palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -

wades, swims, splashes towards the body.

PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people

splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,

Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.

EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY.

Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below

them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the

whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,

police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle

A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her

brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls

away.

And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING

THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across

the terrace. Dickie storms inside.

INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.

Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window

overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening

phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,

begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up

empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.

Dickie stops playing.

He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.

Ripley disappears into the kitchen.

And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax,

somehow in thrall to Ripley.

EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, NAPLES. DAY.

Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express

Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case,

Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter

from Herbert Greenleaf -

INT. TRAIN TO SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo. They sit next to

each other. Dickie's asleep.

shoulder

the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs. Then

Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the

reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head

and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's.  Dickie

suddenly catches him staring. Ripley looks away.

EXT. HOTEL TERRACE RESTAURANT, SAN REMO. NIGHT.

Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which

lips out towards the sea. There's a restaurant and palms and

a JAZZ QUINTET playing, American. Very cool. They pass the

band. Dickie's captivated as they head for their table. They

pass some girls at a table. Dickie smiles greedily.

They're shown to a good table. Dickie watches the band while

their glasses are filled with champagne. Ripley looks happy.

He's got Dickie all to himself.

Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert

solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.

He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this

- it's superficiality.

EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY.

The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor

boat.

The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by

the speed.

Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the

motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.

Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of

the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers,

already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.

Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.

Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley.

RIPLEY SMASHES HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH THE OAR. DICKIE SLIPS

OFF THE WOODEN SEAT, HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE.

The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller.  Dickie looks

up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back.

Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat,

catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face,

apparently unmarked, SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN, a line of blood and

then a peeling like a fruit bursting. Ripley's appalled.  A

terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at

Ripley.

Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar,

kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle. The boat is

rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the

tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come

off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death

wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his

own blood, loses his grip.

Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like

a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood

on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,

letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's

let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls

there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.

Nobody's in sight.  The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling

indifferently on the waves.  Ripley lies by Dickie in the

bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.

The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.  The sea

calms.

EXT. A COVE NEAR SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley

clambers onto a rock over the shore.  He's watching the boat

slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he

finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat

disappears under the surface.

EXT. SAN REMO. DUSK.

Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's

jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

Ripley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's not

wearing his glasses.

EXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY.

Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.  He

stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea

what to do.

EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY.

The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very

together.

INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches

Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He

can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.

INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is

busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the

Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read

part of it -

Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write

produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES

DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.

EXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is

working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by

references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her

until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps.

He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume.

EXT. MONGIBELLO, BEACH. EARLY MORNING.

Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty,

forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning.

INT. OFF FROM DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. MORNING.

As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in

the living room. She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox

open for ice. She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks

back into the kitchen area.

She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling

everywhere. Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear

them up.  She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley. He puts

fresh ice into her glass.

Ripley lights a cigarette.  Marge loses confidence.

INT. ALBERGO GOLDONI, ROME. DAY.

RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of

this small hotel. He exchanges his passport at the desk for

his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to

the metal cage elevator. THIS SCENE INTERCUTS WITH:

INT. HOTEL GRAND. DAY.

DICKIE'S ARRAY OF LEATHER LUGGAGE is pulled along on a

baggage trolley by a liveried PORTER.

Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk. A key comes

back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive

rings.  As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the

passport, he looks at the owner.  Ripley wears a terrific

suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses. His

voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl.

INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. DAY.

The PORTER takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks

around the suite. It's large and splendid. Ripley breathes in

its opulence.  He immediately picks up the telephone.

He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly -

Greenleaf

case to reveal Dickie's

specimen. He compares the two signatures, is pleased.

The telephone rings.

INT. RIPLEY'S HOTEL ROOM, GOLDONI. DAY.

A tiny, cell of a room, single bed. Ripley on the phone.

INT. GUCCI STORE, ROME. DAY.

Ripley has bought some more LEATHER GOODS - a briefcase and

overnight bag. He is at the counter, signing checks.

There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!

Shocked, Ripley looks over to find MEREDITH LOGUE outside,

alone and delighted to see him.  He grins and mouths hello.

EXT. ACROSS PIAZZA NAVONA TO ARCARI'S CAFE. DAY.

Ripley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe.

EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head

inside the office.

INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with

him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed

by her presence.  She goes to the window ahead of him.

She takes her money, turns to him.

He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's

signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at

him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber.

INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY.

Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket

for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates

the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against

Ripley.

Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside,

Meredith shows the Tailor out.  As she returns she notices

the open sax case, peers inside.

She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by

him, the romance she feels to be in the air.

INT. THE OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

before the duel with Onegin.

Ripley's in a tuxedo, in a box which includes a glamorous

Meredith and her AUNT AND UNCLE.  He knows what comes next.

Lensky is shot by Onegin. Blood pours from his neck into the

snow.  Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes

over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing,

kneels holding him... Ripley can barely hide his emotion...

Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.

INT. OUTSIDE THE BOXES, OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

The Interval.  Ripley and Meredith exit their box with

Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval

drinks).

They reach the console where Uncle Ted has their drinks.

INT. OPERA HOUSE, FOYER. NIGHT.

Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the

Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured

Englishman.  They greet each other and

beside them.

He fishes out the glasses.

The INTERVAL BELL'S ringing. Peter hands over his card to

Ripley, sees Meredith.

The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return.

INT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.

Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her.

He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading

through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting

dangerously near as they approach their seats.

EXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT.

Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber.

Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge.

EXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME.

They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment

Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go

inside, then looks at him.

He gets back into the carozza. It moves off.

EXT. DINELLI'S CAFE, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. MORNING.

Meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the Spanish

Steps.

among early tourists, watching as

outside table. Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via

Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith.  She

acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her.

Hearing Marge's name Meredith reacts, freezes.

The WAITER has arrived to take orders. Meredith indicates

she's leaving.

Marge is on the edge. Peter lays a hand to comfort her.

Peter gets up. Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of

the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the

crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he

becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. He's

apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his

element, lying and believing in his lie.

INT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY.

Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo

Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley

explores, relishing the decor.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.

There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with

some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's

a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a

glass, pours himself a drink.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON.

Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and

precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops

playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.

RIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint.

Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the

door.

Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING

FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the

kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.

Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.

Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust.

Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.

AND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner

on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back

to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.

INT. LANDING AND STAIRS, RIPLEY'S BUILDING. LATE DAY.

FREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley

can't make out the text but there's some discussion about

Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY.

Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches

in, he launches into his interrogation.

- AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY

SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE

HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE.

Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then

to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating

him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his

balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before

slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.

THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.

EXT. PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

It's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows

towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley

talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He

pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat.

EXT. VIA APPIA ANTICA. NIGHT.

The Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs

punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car,

Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body.

He slows near a clump of trees.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. EVENING.

Someone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it,

finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO

POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING.

Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini

and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.

Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian.

EXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING.

Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his

scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES

AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances

sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images

and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE

WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the

pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along

the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an

Italian, runs up concerned.

EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY.

Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the

street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips

Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.

Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no

mood for pleasantries.

EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. DAY.

Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter. The

entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars.

Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them. Ripley,

startled, drives straight past the entrance.

EXT. ROME STREET, BY THE RIVER. DAY.

Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different

piazza full of book stalls.  Marge is confused.

And he drives off. At the first opportunity HE DOUBLES BACK

and roars towards the Palazzo.

EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. AFTERNOON.

Ripley drives towards the entrance.  As Ripley gets off and

pushes his scooter through the doorway SOME JOURNALISTS,

LOITERING INSIDE A BARBER'S SHOP come running out and swarm

around him with questions about Freddie. One of them gets off

a photograph.  It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away

as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside.

INT. ENTRANCE AND STAIRS, PALAZZO GIOIA. CONTINUOUS.

As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting

more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell. On a

landing is Roverini. Ripley hurries towards him.

He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow.

Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment.

He waits nervously for Roverini. He unlocks the door and can

barely wait for Roverini to catch up.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him.

Ripley is appalled. He smiles.

Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky.

Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out.

Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through

the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the

stairs.

Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then

suddenly a voice shocks him upright.

Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as

they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves

into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type.

INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

CHAOS.  Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes,

dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one

for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates

from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one

shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing

Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks

it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.

He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and

needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's

leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff

links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he

opens to

He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope

marked

next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the

distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses

there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating,

as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.

INT. BASEMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL

BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and

gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush

couch sits on top of a mound of furniture.  He finds some

dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's

saxophone.

Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the

revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns

off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated

fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.

EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA, ROME. NIGHT.

Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the

entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the

police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off

into the darkness.

EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley,

hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it.

EXT. PIAZZALE ROMA, VENICE. DAWN.

Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a

MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith-

Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back.

EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. EARLY MORNING.

Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons

scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful

grey.

INT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY.

Later.  Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,

where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being

processed.  The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a

horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in

conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley

waits.

A door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a

sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.

Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.  A POLICEMAN

introduces him.

Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview

room at the back of the station.  His manner is ominous.

INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM, VENICE. LATE DAY.

This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a

locked area for cells at one wall.  A small, sour window

gives onto a canal.  The main station is glimpsed through

some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through.

Verrecchia sits down.  Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian,

during which Peter translates.

Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and

answers.

They all laugh.

As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently.

Verrecchia hands over a letter. It's opened. Ripley's name on

the outside. Ripley stares at it.

He stands and takes the letter out.  Begins to read. He has

the look of a man whose privacy has been violated.

INT. PETER SMITH-KINGSLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of

performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING. Peter is an

opera repetiteur. Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing

from the score of Vivaldi's

He's setting the table.

Peter's come over, stands behind him over the piano.

He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripley's shoulder.

INT. SANTA MARIA DELLA PIETA, BRIDGE OF SIGHS. DAY.

A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.

A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.  The

orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the

organ.

Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and

listens. Peter sees him, smiles.  Ripley smiles back.

EXT. VENICE, S.LUCIA RAILWAY STATION. DAY.

MARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley

and Peter have come to meet her.

They walk towards the Vaporetto.

Marge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers.

They step onto the Vaporetto.

EXT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

The boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens

the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags.

INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its

grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar.

Ripley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow

raging. Peter turns

EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. DAY.

St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon

sellers - a man playing saxophone. HERBERT GREENLEAF sits out

in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe,

cradling a glass of hot water. He gets up as Marge and Ripley

arrive.

Marge looks at him in contempt.

A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza. Greenleaf

suddenly explodes.

INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

Herbert Greenleaf sits on a chair, Ripley pours him some tea.

INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK.

Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head

full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in

sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY

SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter

and Marge.

She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear,

then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley,

a little concerned.

Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his

pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles.

INT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door.

Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around

his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's

slightly breathless.

He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence.

His towel slips off from his waist.

She goes off obediently, a zombie. He shuts the door.

Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to

kill Marge with. He's got a shoe but it feels too light. He

opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then

picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.

INT. RIPLEY'S SITTING ROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the

bathroom.

A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As

he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently.

His hand goes to his pocket. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.

Marge is shivering. Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.

Marge panics, backed up against the door. She screams and

turns

back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door.

Ripley storms off. His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED

IN BLOOD from the razor. Peter notices, appalled.

INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand.

INT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING.

Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance.

INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY.

Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't

recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the

private investigator.

Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back,

as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE

TABLE.

Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf

heads into his bedroom.

He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS

PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks

out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and

indifferent view.

EXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY.

Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges.

Ripley turns, shocked.

MacCarron gets up.

Ripley's head drops.

Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.

He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES

from Freddie's car.

Ripley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream.

There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.

EXT. EUROPA REGINA MOORING. DAY.

Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the

water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and

then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert

Greenleaf carries the saxophone case.

Marge shakes her head to silence him.

He puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away.

STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that

Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to

restrain her.  Ripley looks at him as if to say:

do, she's hysterical.

boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away.

They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off

towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.

EXT. FERRY FOR ATHENS, NAPLES. DAY.

A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the

ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.  They're

laughing.

INT. PETER'S CABIN. DUSK.

Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his

traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in.

EXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET.

Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.

Then a voice shakes him from his reverie.

He turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie.

Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER

COUPLES are walking around the deck.

And now he's thinking

He kisses her.  Full of future.

INT. PETER'S CABIN. NIGHT.

Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently

engrossed. Ripley knocks and enters. Looks long at Peter.

He sits on the bed, leans against Peter. His eyes are

brimming with tears.  He takes the cord from Peter's robe and

begins twisting it in his hands.

Ripley is pressing against him, moving up his body, kisses

his shoulder, the cord wrapped tight in his hands...

INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. NIGHT.

Ripley returns to his cabin. Sits on the bed, desolate.

The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he

catches his reflection. It swings shut. Open then shut.

Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light

dies. There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the

round glass. Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making.

THE END.

From the silence

from the night

comes a distant lullabye

Cry, remembering that first cry

Your brother standing by

and loved

both loved

beloved sons of mine

sing a lullabye

mother is close by

innocent eyes

such innocent eyes

Envy stole your brother's life

came home murdered peace of mind

left you nightmares on the pillow

sleep now

Soul, surrendering your soul

the heart of you not whole

for love

but love

what toll

Cast into the dark

branded with the mark

of shame

of Cain

From the garden of God's light

to a wilderness of light

sleep now

sleep now.
