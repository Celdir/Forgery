NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS.

THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.

THE SCREEN

Stygean darkness.

Wet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT

reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter

restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the

UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs,

walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of

them.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT. SEWER SYSTEM

Innards of steel. A vast maze of tunnels.

A GROUP OF FIGURES advances through the tunnels with handheld

UV lamps.

The figures are dressed in gray air-tight NEOPRENE SUITS,

their faces hidden by skin tight MASKS and bug-like NIGHT

VISION GOGGLES. In the dense silence, respirator valves HISS-

CLICK at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm.

The scene has a dream-like, choreographed quality.

NIGHT-VISION POV

Eerie, aquatic green.  The horde of insects appear to be some

kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean.

THE TEAM OF FIGURES

From their midst appears another FIGURE, its neoprene suit a

flat WHITE.  Female, clearly the TEAM LEADER.

She carries a stainless steel CONTAINER filled with twenty

small compartments, each bearing a large, heavy-shelled roach

with a different BARCODE on their back.

JUDAS ROACHES.

She kneels and opens the

CASE

TCHK!! A dozen of the Judas roaches are released.  They slide

through into the area.

THE NEARBY ROACHES

react instantaneously.  In a rustle of tiny legs, they begin

to stream toward the Judases.

Jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them.

They even crawl over the Team Leader in an effort to reach

the Judases.  The Team Leader makes no effort to brush them

off.  Patient, almost godlike, she watches the MATING.

LATER

A MANHOLE has been opened above. CHAINS are dropped down and

attached by a Team Member to A 100-GALLON DISPOSAL DRUM.

REVEAL the floor of the tunnel, carpeted with the still forms

of the roaches, now all DEAD.

The Team Members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other

disposal drums.

At their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre:

the bar-coded Judas Roaches.

In a crunch of machinery, the first disposal drum is lifted

by the chains through the manhole to

EXT. A CITY STREET - DAY

MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.  A cacophony of SOUND and LIGHT.

Dirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink

everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped

dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send

the cars on crosstown detours.

Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near

dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked

in a military phalanx.

A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the

middle of the street, "sealing" the area with amber plastic.

Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches

and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS.

The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is

off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28.

An ARM gently drapes over her shoulder.

She looks over at DR. PETER TYLER, 34, bespectacled.  A

HEADSET around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH logo.  He has the look of a man who's

just fought a long battle and come out victorious.

He offers her a bite of a PAY DAY CANDYBAR.  Susan smiles,

shakes her head.  She wearily leans against him.

Peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised

by MECHANICAL ARMS into the waiting maw of the dump truck.

THE SCREEN. DARKNESS.

A voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - FLOATING SHOT

We FLOAT through a long hospital ward.

Past ROWS of illuminated oxygen tents, pulsating softly in

the dark like cocoons of light.

TRACK past tents.  BODIES OF SMALL CHILDREN inside, wrapped

in white sheets, hooked up to IVs or breathing apparatus.

Skeletal hands, parched lips, glazed eyes.

BELLOWS of respirators push in and out, labored, failing.

IMAGE RESOLVES TO A VIDEO ON A SCREEN.

PULL BACK to reveal a number of SCREENS, each with a

different set of images.  We are in a NEWS VAN.   A

TECHNICIAN and DIRECTOR sit watching.

The voice belongs to an ANCHORMAN who's now overimposed.

The Technician manipulates the controls.  On another screen

we see them cut to STOCK NEWS FOOTAGE: regular cockroaches,

crawling on garbage.

EXT. OUTSIDE VAN - CITY HALL - DUSK

The runner exits the News Van.  Other such vehicles parked

nearby.  A CROWD of ONLOOKERS, REPORTERS and a gaggle of

PROTESTERS with handpainted signs.

Gliding past them, we pick up sound bites...

REPORTER 3 is interviewing a Greenpeace PROTESTER who is

holding up a photograph of Susan.

MOVE past them to further inside of the perimeter...

INT. AUDITORIUM - CITY HALL

A NEWS CONFERENCE in progress.  A packed house.  T.V.

monitors spaced ever 10 seats or so. In the audience, the

MAYOR OF NEW YORK and various CITY OFFICIALS, listening to

Peter, speaking at the podium with the ease and enthusiasm of

a public servant still untainted by bureaucracy.

ON A TV MONITOR

While Peter talks, a news title appears at the bottom of the

screen: PETER TYLER. DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

Susan is waiting in the wings. She observes the audience.

She notices that the entire front row is composed of CHILDREN

who have survived Strickler's.  Leg and arm braces, facial

scarring...

He nods at Susan, who takes the podium, adjusting her jacket,

slightly ill at ease in her business suit.  She clears her

throat, speaks softly.

She places a clear container on the podium for all to see.

CU CONTAINER

One of the Judas roaches skitters about in the container.

Cameras FLASH.  MURMURS from the audience.

On the back row she can see some ecological hand-painted

signs being raised in silent protest. She stumbles for a

second, then resumes her speech.

The audience is rapt.

Now Peter takes the mic.

A STANDING OVATION starts and is carried on as we...

INT. TYLER APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SUSAN

in a tub in a dark bathroom. Her business suit crumpled

on the bathroom floor.  SOUND of a TV outside.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Nothing grand.  Peter in his shorts at a TV with shitty

reception.  He adjusts the disgruntled cable box.

He is seen over the TV, giving his address.

Peter sighs. He picks up an open bottle of champagne and

two mis-matched ceramic cups, then heads for the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM

Susan doesn't answer, clearly not in the same high spirits.

He notices her crumpled garment on the floor.  He picks it

up, puts it up on the hanger.

He sits by the tub.

Peter pours some champagne into the cups.

We hear a NEWSREADER on the TV.

He offers one cup to Susan.  She doesn't take it.

He sits closer to her.

Beat.  Susan starts to relax. He kisses her.

She pats the water, beckoning.

Still partially clothed, he steps into the bathtub. Susan

shakes her head, laughs ruefully.

She reaches over, kisses him.

EXT. ALPHABET CITY - NIGHT

The WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE dimly visible through the rain.

ALPHABET CITY STREETS

Empty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking

on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy

layer of rain.

SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO YEARS LATER

A DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made

of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade.

CRANE to see the ROOFTOP.

WHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall,

thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild

with terror.

He looks back down the steps.

Something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex

shadows on the wall.

Too many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person.

The man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home.

Trembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door

shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows...

something inhuman, determined to break through.

The metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges.

On the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to

grow.  Needles of rain stab his flesh.

He searches wildly for a possible escape.

He reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the

sidewalk.

Two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the

surrounding concrete.

WHAM!  The door to the stairs bulges outward as something

SMASHES against it again and again.  Frenzied SCRATCHING.

The man sprints to the other end of the roof. There, on the

adjoining building...

THE CHINESE PREACHER'S POV

Just one floor below on the building across the alley is a

suspended PAINTERS' PLATFORM, crowded with paint cans under a

tarp.  A two-story old EYEWEAR ADVERTISEMENT from the 40's is

being painted over.

THE CHINESE PREACHER

Looks back to the door.  BAM! a tremendous SHATTERING sound.

LIGHT spills from inside. Two bolts fly in the air, a hinge

gives.

He CRIES OUT in terror.

The man gauges the distance between buildings; can he make

it?

He takes a few steps back, a few more...

Panting hard, he closes his eyes, his chest soaked in blood

and rain.

THE DOOR EXPLODES OUTWARD AND SKIDS ACROSS THE SLIPPERY ROOF.

Light from inside projects the shadow of wild, busy things

onto the curtain of rain.

Weeping with fear, the man desperately tries to hurl himself

to the catwalk.

It's too far.

He FALLS...CRASH!  he hits the platform, knocking boards

loose and sending paint cans onto their sides, rolling.  He

bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a

loose board to save himself from falling.

The RAIN blasts down.  The scaffold CREAKS.  He hits the

edge, upsetting the cans of paint there.

He holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push

with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.

BELOW

Cans bounce off the pavement. White pain blasts all over.

CU HANDS

The man's hands slip on the planks, tiring.

FEET

The Chinese Preacher's FEET bicycle in the air, unable to

find a purchase on the wet brick wall-

THE CHINESE PREACHER

is hanging just in front of the painted EYE of the forties'

model.  He looks up above him, sees something-

A SHADOW crosses his face as something looms above him.

Suddenly there is a CRACK and the platform tilts completely

on one end.

HANDS

The Chinese Preacher's fingernails dig in, then slip on the

wet wood.

His hands paw the air.

WIDER

For a moment his body, silhouetted in the rain, seems

suspended in a void. Then he falls backwards.

THE GROUND

Impact. His body cracks the pavement.

Small pools of rain form on his dead, open eyes.

We CRANE to reveal

A WINDOW ON A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET

CHUY, a young Latino boy. He stares out the window at the

Chinese Preacher's body with no discernable emotion.

He works a small WIRE SCULPTURE in his hands.

APARTMENT

It's a small one-bedroom apartment.

An old man sleeps peacefully on a cot: Chuy's grandfather.

MANNY GAVIOLA, mid 60's, white hair haloes his handsome,

benign face.

All around him: SHOES, shoes everywhere you look, on the

table, on the chairs, on the kitchen counter, on the floor.

A small altar is illuminated by votive candles. Next to it,

standing by the window is

CHUY

HIS P.O.V.

We see a blurry vision of The Chinese Preacher's splayed

figure in a swirl of color.

Chuy's attention focuses on the Preacher's shoes.

CHUY

He looks away from the body and goes back to twisting the

wire into shape.

THE PUDDLE OF PAINT

around the preacher, reflects large shadows moving above,

and across the neon sign...

CHUY

hears a strange sound, a rhythmic clicking.

His head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to

change--there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in

his eyes.

ACROSS THE ROOFTOP

We are behind whatever it is that has captured Chuy's

attention.

TICKETY-TACKETY-TOCK...

The strange clicking sound grows louder.  The figure begins

moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps

forward and drops out of frame.

CHUY

His eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow

arc.

Chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get

a better view.

GROUND LEVEL

The Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the

rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake.

CHUY

We isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other

noise FADES AWAY.

Chuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby.

He begins to click them together.

Imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago.

THE CHINESE PREACHER

is being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only

problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through

this hole.

CHUY

watches, still clicking with his spoons.

THE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY

is stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the

thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing

against the wall next to the vent. Impossible.

There is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY

VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body

like a rag doll.

CHUY

His spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear

terrible cracking and scraping sounds.

THE WINDOW

The Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the

hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of

the opening.

CHUY

watches, still fascinated.

He starts a new wire sculpture.

EXT. JOGGING PATH - CENTRAL PARK - DAWN

Peter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the

Central Park reservoir. A beautiful day dawns behind him; the

windows of the Beresford sparkle in the morning sun.

Peter outperforms most of the other RUNNERS in the track, his

steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. Keeping his

stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of OLD NUNS.

Without slowing down, Peter retakes the path and moves past

them.

EXT. JOGGER'S PATH - NEAR FIFTH AVENUE - LATER

Peter finally slows down. He checks his pulse and stops at a

water fountain.

As he drinks, he sees a DERELICT drawing a figure on the

sidewalk.

The derelict spots Peter.  He picks up his chalk, drifts off.

Intrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points

to a manhole cover set among the bushes.

Peter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines.

Then the painted motif finally reveals itself.

GRAFFITI

A talismanic figure of raw, archetypal power. A few jagged

lines form the shape of a MAN IN AN OVERCOAT. His face is

little more than a malignant blotch.

INT. MUSEUM - EXHIBIT ROOM - DAY

A room of half-finished exhibits. A group of SCULPTORS --

most of them undergraduates -- work on a gigantic piece

representing a termite mound.  They're supervised by SIRI, a

punkish young Indian research assistant.

Susan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100-1 scale

clay model of an insect's head.  She gestures to the

model's mandible set.

She grabs the outer mandible set.

Then unfolds a second set...

And a third!!!

The guys nod.

A piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads,

revealing...

...Peter, at the entrance, still dressed in his jogging

sweats. He smiles at Susan.

EXHIBITS

Peter and Susan walk through.  Peter pulls something from a

KNAPSACK.  A bottle of medicine marked: METALLININ.

He gives it to Susan.

Around them, WORKMEN begin unloading crates of display stuff,

as a MAN on a ladder tacks up an "ARCHITECTS OF NATURE"

banner. Susan proceeds behind an exhibit representing a

honeycomb.  Peter follows as she begins to arrange some tools.

She gently touches her belly.

She shakes the bottle.

Peter's cellular RINGS from his knapsack. Susan grabs a

larvae model from a pile on the floor.

Peter takes the call. Susan cuts away the excess plastic on

the lid around the honeycomb moldings. The larvae fits

perfectly inside.

He kisses her and leaves. Susan turns to Siri and the group

working on that sculpture.

EXT. STREET

A Department of Health VAN honks its way through a traffic

jam.

INT. VAN

Peter's right hand man, JOSH MASLOW -- a young, good-natured,

can-do guy -- drives.

In the back, Peter finishes changing out of his jogging

sweats and into his worksuit.

EXT. FLOPHOUSE - DAY

The Department of Health van pulls up outside the flophouse

where the Chinese Preacher died. Peter and Josh get out.

COPS push back a few ONLOOKERS. Josh proudly flashes his DOH

badge.

The cops let them pass.

Two cops -- WOYCHEK and RICE -- approach, in no real hurry.

Peter peeks through a narrow cellar window on the floor.

Through the oily, smeared window, a ghostly array of PALE

FACE AND HANDS appears, startling him.

LATER

PARAMEDIC AMBULANCES rush in. Sirens at full blast.

Stepping out of the building across, Manny walks next to

Chuy, who holds his hand. The old man carries a box full of

shoes.

Chuy looks back at the cop circus, amused.

He gently pulls his grandson's hand and moves briskly away.

JOSH

uses an iron bar, and breaks a padlocked cellar door. A heavy

stench emanates from inside. The cops cover their noses.

INT. CELLAR

Peter and Josh enter a dingy, dungeon-like cellar,

illuminated only by bug zappers and emergency lights. Every

door and window has been nailed shut or sports a heavy-duty

padlock. Peter and Josh walk through the dismal scene.

In sharp contrast with the dirt-smeared walls, we see shiny

metallic SEWING MACHINES and swatches of cloth appliqued with

a FUNNY BUNNY cartoon character.

Josh examines the label stitched into the collar. It reads:

PROUDLY MADE IN USA.

His light hits a group of quivering, skeletal CHINESE

IMMIGRANTS, standing in a tight group against a wall.

INT. STAIRWELL, MUSEUM - DUSK

Carrying boxes full of terrarium material, Susan and Siri

ride an antiquated cage-steel elevator.  No floor buttons,

just an old-fashioned hand-activated lever.

Susan looks at her.

She tries to stop the elevator at the fourth floor, but

it rises just a little too far.

Susan has to jimmy the lever till the elevator falls

level to the floor.

A pair of young boys, RICKY and DAVIS, sit on the floor

outside Susan's lab door.  A crumpled paper bag and a shoe

box sit beside them.

Susan smiles at the boys, who stand when they see her.

Siri chuckles.

Ricky raises and shakes the paper bag.

INT. MOUNTING ROOM - DUSK

SUNLIGHT slants in to illuminate an incredible array of live

and mounted dead INSECTS, trapped in turn-of-the-century

glass fronted cabinets. Davis puts his nose up against one,

fascinated.

She examines the boys' findings, mostly rag-tag specimens

of battered butterflies.

Siri lingers in the background.

He indicates the shoebox-

Siri impatiently points at the wall clock-

Susan holds out two five dollar bills.  The boys can't

resist.  Davis grabs the money-

Ricky gives a last possessive look to the shoe box, then

follows Davis out.

Siri crosses to the window and wrestles to close it.

Susan places all the kid's items -including the shoebox- in

a wastebasket.

Siri hits the window frame with a paperweight, gets it half

way down.

EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM MUSEUM - NIGHTFALL

CRANE TO a nearby alley.

A GAUNT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT stands in the shadows, looking up

at Siri working on the window.

As a streetlamp lights up, he backs up into the shadows.

INT. FLOPHOUSE. LOBBY - NIGHTFALL

Religious slogans and posters are hung everywhere in what

used to be the lobby of a men's hotel.  A hand-lettered sign:

"NO LIQUOR, NO DRUGS, NO PROFANITY"

PARAMEDICS are leading a number of ill CHINESE IMMIGRANTS up

from the cellar door seen earlier.  Many are brought out on

STRETCHERS. DOH staff put tags on their wrists.

Peter examines a PALE OLD MAN on a stretcher while

simultaneously talking to Josh.

Peter flicks on his penlight, examines the Old Man's eyes.

One of them is completely bloodshot. Then he shows Josh

the gums. They're bleeding.

INT. SWEAT SHOP. BASEMENT

Peter pushes back a sheet hung across a doorway.

BASEMENT SHOWERS

A tiled nightmare. Concentration camp-cozy. A pile of old,

rusting sewing machines clutter the floor, spilling

oxide to a central grate.

Josh swats a fly.

An overhead door is opened. Daylight streams in. Peter spots

YANG, an Asian cop, talking to a CHINESE WOMAN lying on a

stretcher which hasn't been moved yet.  She is hollow-eyed,

near death.  Her hand weakly hangs on to the cop as if for

dear life.

Peter kneels next to her, looking at her and nodding while

Yang translates. The woman mutters again, tears of fear in

her eyes.  Yang shakes his head.

They pull the stretcher out through the open overhead door

and into an

ALLEY

The stretcher is rolled into a waiting vehicle, its lights

flashing. Unseen by them, on a brick wall, nearly buried by

graffiti, is a crude DRAWING.

It is of the same, odd figure Peter saw drawn earlier.  The

OVERCOAT MAN.

INT. LAB - NIGHT - MONTAGE

Susan and Siri, both wearing Walkman headsets, deftly mount

BUTTERFLIES and other INSECTS onto display boards for the

exhibit. Rain is blowing in through the half-open window.

Their movements are precise and lyrical, the colors and

designs of the insects are beautiful.

We understand how you can get lost in this world.  Susan

works steadily, a partially-eaten PAY-DAY BAR and the

wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner.

A PAGER goes off in Susan's lab coat.

She takes off her headset; CLASSICAL MUSIC leaks from her

headphones.

On the PAGER's LCD screen the message reads: LATE

TONIGHT. PETE.

Susan puts the pager down. Goes to close the window.

There is a loud, angry BUZZING sound.

Siri pulls her headset off; HEAVY METAL MUSIC leaks from her

headphones.

The BUZZING sound again. We PAN across the various bugs and

mounting implements till we come to rest...

...on the SHOEBOX the boys gave Susan. Something rattles

wildly inside.

Susan crosses to the trash bin, picks the box out. It

vibrates on her hand, then becomes quiet, something moves

inside.

She slowly opens the lid.

The bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded

newspaper. Crumbs of bread and some rice-krispies can be

spotted here and there: a kid's idea of a comfy critter's

nest. She moves her free hand closer.

Suddenly and INSECT big as her hand springs out of the

shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her! Minute

pieces of paper fly through the air!!

Susan slaps the lid back down.

LATER

Siri comes over as Susan grabs steel tongs and a cork

dissecting board.

Siri nods, pins in hand.  Susan opens the lid and grabs the

nymph with the tongs.  The creature goes berserk, flailing

its spindly limbs, BUZZING and CROAKING, a milky substance

FOAMING out of its body.

Susan deposits the insect onto the corkboard.

Siri tries to get a hold of it; but it twists out of the

tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand!! A spider

trapping a sparrow.

SNAP!  It bites her hand between index and forefinger.

Susan pins the insect into the corkboard. It spins furiously,

like a crazy LP record.

Susan gets a grip on it again with the tongs.  Siri uses more

pins to secure it down.

SUSAN

leans to get a closer look at the NYMPH: Deep dark brown,

flat as a pancake, one rear leg broken, lower tail smashed.

It squirms helplessly now, looking pitiful under the harsh

overhead light.

The nymph continues to HISS and FOAM, struggling against the

steel pins. Susan looks closely at the insect's belly.

Susan gestures to look.  Siri stares down at

THE NYMPH'S TORSO

where a SET OF VALVES on its underside click in and out.

SIRI

shakes her head.

Susan touches her scalpel to the nymph's leg.

The nymph CLICKS nervously.

She traps the nymph down and CUTS THE LEG OFF.

A painful, agonized BUZZ echoes around the room.

MONITOR

Susan attaches the insect's leg to a samll holder. It is

frozen in a swirl of dry ice.

The brittle leg is then mounted in a LASER MICROTOME. Bit by

bit, the machine executes MICROSCOPIC WAFER CUTS. Siri is

making slides out of each section.

A series of MICROPHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES flash onto the screen.

In the background we hear the high-pitched BUZZ-

We see the lights from the mounting room through a glass

brick wall.

INT. MOUNTING ROOM - NIGHT

We see the nymph slowly squirming in the FG, then RACK FOCUS

to the rain-spattered WINDOW.

Suddenly the OVERCOAT MAN is standing on the windowsill!

The window is lifted effortlesly from the outside.

SUSAN

prepares a blue solution and places two drops on each smear

slide.

Reflected in the glass brick behind her we see the man moving

across the room.

THE OVERCOAT MAN

seen only through rippled glass and reflections, moves

through the lab.

His body STEAMS lightly from the rain. His movements are

quirky, spastic.

The man observes the imprisoned insects with curiosity.

He comes to the nymph, pinned and mutilated on the worktable.

The nymph CLICKS and CHITTERS excitedly, as if communicating

with the man.

He looks up at the worklight.  It seems to bother him.

WHUMP!!! In a blur of motion, he SMASHES the light bulb.

SUSAN

watches the smear slide.  The blue droplets begin to CHANGE

COLOR once in contact with the leg section...

...slowly turning a deep green.

Then, THREE LARGE BEETLES fly into the room.

Siri looks at Susan. Susan gets up, hesitant, signals for

Siri to stay.

We FOLLOW Susan into the mounting room.

SUSAN'S POV

She walks in, barely able to see her hand in front of her

face.

The window facing the street is wide open, rain blowing in.

Something CRUNCHES under her feet.  She bends down, looks.

She's stepped on the broken glass of the lightbulb.

The floor is alive with various INSECTS -- crawling, hopping,

flying away from their displays, which have been opened.

The nymph is gone from the board!

She looks under the work table the nymph was on.

We LOWER as we TRACK BACK with her.  Something is folded up

in the corner of the ceiling behind her, camouflaged in the

shadows, clinging impossibly to the wall.

THE OVERCOAT MAN.

He lowers himself with silent grace.

Susan whirls.

WHOOSH! A GUST OF WIND! A FLUTTERING SHADOW OFF THE WINDOW!

Silence.

Susan GASPS, startled.  We SHIFT to see Siri at the door.

EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

The last DOH van takes off under the heavy rain.

Across the street, Chuy looks down from his apartment window.

INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - SAME

Chuy sits at the window, twisting wire into a human-like

figure.  MOVING past him, we see a group of other WIRE

FIGURES on the table, backs of chairs, lamps, everywhere.

Manny sits at the kitchen table. He IGNITES a can of shoe

polish with a match, then lights a cigarette off the flame.

He puts the cigarette in his mouth and proceeds to polish a

pair of shoes. A SILLY SHOW plays over the TV.

Manny leans tiredly against the table. He looks fatigued

and in pain. He takes a small pill and places it under

his tongue.

Manny shoots a glance over to his grandson.

Chuy doesn't pay attention, just stares out at the street.

Manny lifts a brightly colored CHILDREN'S BOOK.

Nothing from Chuy.

CHUY'S POV - STREET

The building across the street. Yellow DOH tape at the

entrance.

A FIGURE moves out of the shadows and totters in the rain

toward the entrance.  It is the OVERCOAT MAN, barely visible

in the rain.

CHUY

His face shows a bit of animation.

Manny looks up from the book.

Manny comes over, looks out.

THEIR POV

The figure has disappeared into the dark front of the

boarded-up building.

MANNY AND CHUY

Chuy doesn't respond.  Manny turns the boy's face to his.

Chuy looks at him blankly.  Manny sighs; he knows he doesn't.

He pats the boy on the head, then goes back to work. Chuy

turns back to stare at the street.

EXT. OUTSIDE TYLER APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The D.O.H. Van pulls up in front of a modest Pre-war

building. Josh and Peter climb out.

Peter is reviewing a roster.

Josh hands Peter a plastic bag with his sweat clothes

and running shoes.

Peter hands him the roster.

Peter walks up the front steps.

INT. TYLER APARTMENT - NIGHT

Peter enters the apartment, which has long since been

remodeled with a nicer couch and a bigger TV with slightly

better reception.

No answer.  He notices the dining room table is filled with

yellowed FILES, all marked JUDAS TRADITOR.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

Peter comes in to find Susan sitting in a chair before a

dryer, quietly watching laundry whirl within.

Peter walks over, kisses her.  He notices an open book of

INSECT MORPHOLOGY on her lap. There's a FULL COLOR

PHOTOGRAPH of an OOTHECA -- an insect eggcase.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

Peter folds laundry into his/her piles.  Susan paces.

Peter takes a bedsheet. Susan helps him fold it.

Peter walks backward with his end of the sheet.  The two

begin to fold it together.

As they fold the sheet, they move closer together.

The folding of the sheet has brought them almost face to

face. Susan finishes folding herself.

She has his full attention now.

EXT. ALPHABET CITY - AVENUE B - DAY

A TAXI CAB makes a U turn and cruises on.

INT. CAB

Susan ignores the yakking Armenian DRIVER as she scans

the buildings and empty lots-

The cabbie looks up at a Manhattan street map glued over

his head on the roof of the cab.

The cab cruises past the tenement buildings, nondescript

stores, junked cars and rubble-strewn lots. It stops

before a traffic light.

A LEERING HOMELESS GUY with a greasy rag and greasier

cleaning solution approaches the windshield.

The Homeless guy begins wiping/smudging the windshield

with his dirty rag. The driver sends him away.

The light turns green.  The Driver accelerates, turning

on the windshield wipers to expunge the smears left by

the guy.

Susan sees something.

Susan motions excitedly.  The Driver pulls over. Susan

gets out.

EXT. OUTSIDE CAR

Susan rushes over, removes something from the windshield

wiper.

A BUTTERFLY, its wing pinned under the rubber flapper.

She holds it in her palm, then looks up at Peter.

Susan looks around.  Just ahead is an empty LOT surrounded by

a wooden fence plastered with flyers for rock bands and

performance artists.

An identical BUTTERFLY perches on the edge of a board.

EXT. EMPTY LOT

Susan and Peter walk through waist-high GRASS of a small

urban wilderness.  Dozens of BUTTERFLIES flutter around them

from the weeds.

Peter and Susan look up.  The voice comes from a RAMSHACKLE

CLUBHOUSE, built of wood scraps and cardboard.

Susan walks forward.

Long beat.  The door to the clubhouse swings open.

INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

A BLUR of subway cars goes by with an ear-pulverizing SOUND.

At the end of the platform, Davis untwists a wire around the

busted lock of a locker room door. Peter paces nervously

nearby.

He starts on it himself. Meanwhile, Ricky stares at a

PHOTOGRAPH Susan has given to him:  a ribbed, tortoise-

brown colored EGGCASE.

Davis opens the door with a CLICK.

INT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM

A dark, abandoned LOCKER ROOM once used for transit workers.

Susan and Peter walk in with the boys, nervous in the off-

limits area.

Davis points to a bank of dented metal LOCKERS.

Peter hands Ricky some money. The boy looksdown at it

slyly.

Peter regards the little scam artist dryly.

Peter hands him a couple of dollars more. The two boys

take off.

Peter removes a PENLIGHT from his pocket.

Dust covers everything. A forest of COPPER TUBING and PIPES

where the sinks used to be.

PETER

inspects the floor. It's littered with cheap objects:

chipped combs, used rubbers, soggy newspapers, smeared

heroin syringes.

Something shiny catches his eye. He picks it up.

Something rustles nearby.

He notices an old, rotting poster on the back wall.  It

seems ODDLY TEXTURED somehow.  He walks toward it.

SUSAN

kneeling, pushes aside a dented trash bin. Behind it, there

is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors.

A SUBWAY TRAIN RUMBLES by outside, the sound echoes off

the tile walls.

Susan forces the door back. She peeks through the opening.

Her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror.

She starts pulling something out.

PETER

at the oddly texture wall.  He shines the penlight at it...

...and is met with a FLUTTER OF WINGS.  MOTHS, perfectly

camouflaged against the poster on the wall, whiz past him.

Peter recoils.

He nods.

SUSAN

turns back to her locker.  She withdraws a cheap PLASTIC

NECKLACE from it.  As she removes it, it breaks.  A coulpe of

beads fall away...

...rolls under the locker...

...and BOUNCE -- once, twice, thrice -- each time going

deeper till they comes to a stop.

Susan peers where the beads fell.

Peter comes over, kneels by her. Susan takes a handful of

beads and throws them at the base of the locker.

CAMERA TRACKS to follow one of them. It rolls all the way

under.

A moment later, from some interior space, the sound of it

BOUNCING on cement. He shines his light inside.

INT. HOLE - PETER'S HAND

Very dark. A highlight glints off a shell-like surface.

The light barely touches it.

THE WHOLE SURFACE BACKS AWAY.

Peter drops the penlight.  It gets stuck in a jutting piece

of concrete.

PETER

Peter tries to get his hand in

DEEPER

But he cannot reach the light. It is literally inches from

his fingers...

SUSAN

She kneels and goes for it.

INT. HOLE - SUSAN'S HAND

Her hand reaches for the penlight.

She barely touches it.  The penlight spins around.  Its light

now illuminates...

THE FACE OF A MAN.  Unseen by Susan.  Terrifying in its doll-

like simplicity.  In the darkness, its features seem

indiscernable, inert, almost frozen in a perfectly

symmetrical pattern.

It regards the spiderlike movement of Susan's fingers.

SUSAN'S

face squinches with the effort.

INT. HOLE - SUSAN'S HAND

As Susan's hand moves closer, the strange Face begins to

TREMBLE.

A CLICKING SOUND.

Susan's hand is almost there.

SUSAN

reaches further.

And suddenly A BEAM OF LIGHT cuts through the darkness.

Their vision resolves. The figures of two MTA COPS stand

before them:  ERNEST, 50, burly and bull-necked; and LEONARD

-- African American, 45, more formidable than fat.

INT. HOLE

Susan's hand withdraws.

INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATER

SHH-SHH-SHH.  A felt rag is expertly being pulled across a

set of pristine black shoes.

REVEAL Leonard sitting like a king in a chair, getting his

shoes shined by Manny.  He leans back laconically while

arguing with Peter. Ernest examines the ootheca picture.

Uninterested, Leonard looks over to Susan and Chuy.

ANGLE ON SUSAN

She leans against the wall, inspects her dirty hand. Ernest

gives her his handkerchief.

She looks down at Chuy, who sits nearby, holding a PAIR OF

SPOONS.

She stares down at her shoes.  Gucci flat pumps, all right.

Susan smiles.

Just then, a SUBWAY TRAIN pulls up.  The doors open,

disgorging passengers. Chuy flips into action.  He starts

playing his spoons, CLICKING them together, slapping them

against his knee.

Susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons

to IMITATE the different rhythmical step patterns of the

VARIOUS COMMUTERS: The rolling, comical gait of A FAT MAN,

the lithe haughty step of A PRIM LADY.

Chuy doesn't answer.

Ernest discreetly points to his forehead.

Leonard hands Manny a $5.00 bill for the shine, gets up and

walks past Peter as if he were invisible.

Ernest smiles, pockets the ootheca picture.

Leonard saunters away with Ernest in tow.

Peter shakes his head angrily.  He takes Susan by the arm,

heads off in another direction.

Chuy, without watching, clicks his spoons to the imitation of

their steps.

INT. SUBWAY STAIRS - DAY

Susan and Peter walk up the stairs; Peter still fumes.

Susan spares him an ironic look.

At the top of the stairs they're completely engulfed by

sunlight.

INT. SUBWAY TRACKS - DUSK

A train blurs by.

A FLASHLIGHT BEAM over dirty gravel.  TILT with the beam to

see Ernest walking his beat past TRACKS and GIRDERS.  Hulking

out-of-service SUBWAY CARS surround him. He shines his light

on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls.

A SOUND catches his attention.  A RUSTLING.

He notices something off to a corner, walks over to it.

A SHINY BROWN LUMP in the corner, covered in garbage.

He touches the lump with his shoe.  It STIRS slightly.

He touches it again...

...and a PAIR OF LEGS suddenly LASH OUT, kicking at him

reflexively.

Ernest jumps back.

Another SET OF LEGS emerges...

Oddly enough, Ernest relaxes.

He grabs the surface of the lump, and pulls it.  We see that

it was just a SHINY BROWN TARP.

Underneath, a group of THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE -- emaciated,

toothless -- sleeping intertwined for warmth. In the dim

light, they almost seem like a single organism.

The Homeless People stare back at him mutely.  Ernest starts

getting annoyed.

Ernest looks at her, confused.

The homeless man points.  Ernest turns his light.

Another SILHOUETTE of the OVERCOAT MAN drawn on the wall. An

arrow below it points east.

Ernest hustles them out.  The homeless people glare at him,

pick up their things and head into the gloom.

Ernest watches them go.  He turns back to the graffiti

painting of The Stickman.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - LATER

Ernest walks deeper into the tunnels. Dusklight slants in

weakly from grates above.

He stops as a RUMBLE is heard ahead of him  He ducks into a

recess in the wall.  The RUMBLE grows LOUDER, LOUDER.

A SUBWAY TRAIN curves around the bend up ahead, its

HEADLIGHTS raking the opposite wall to reveal...

A FIGURE crouched over something.

We hear CHOMPING and SWALLOWING sounds.

CU ERNEST

Squinting to see over his flashlight beam.

No answer.  Just the wet sounds of food getting chewed and

ingested.  Ernest is revolted.

The crouching figure lifts its head and looks around in a

unusually quick BLUR OF MOTION.  It's the OVERCOAT MAN.

Another distant RUMBLE. Ernest's clothes flutter in the puff

of hot wind that signals an approaching train.

Ernest pulls a CAN OF MACE from his belt, begins to advance.

The Overcoat Man stands up.

Ernest stops in his tracks.

For he sees that the Overcoat Man is holding a large OBJECT

in his arms. Something wet and shiny with blood.

A dead dog.

The Overcoat Man drops the animal.  It rolls slowly down his

chest...

...and is briefly caught BY ANOTHER SET OF ARMS EXTENDING

FROM HIS TORSO.

The Overcoat Man lets the animal fall to the ground.  He

begins walking toward Ernest.

Ernest backs away.

The Overcoat Man LEAPS on him just as the SUBWAY TRAIN ROARS

PAST!

CRACK! Ernest's body is twisted and crunched by powerful

arms.

Through the strobing windows we see Ernest enveloped by the

dark figure, then raised above, taken away.

TRACK

The can of mace rolls next to the track as the TRAIN CLEARS.

The track is empty again.

INT. EXHIBITION HALL - BANNER

We PAN across the banner:  'ARCHITECTS OF NATURE'.

INT. EXHIBITION FLOOR

EXHIBITS under glass set up throughout the room: Insect

chambers and vaults of great complexity, etc.

An opening night CROWD of affluent MUSEUM PATRONS.  All

tuxedoes and painted smiles.  Some peremptorily peruse the

displays; most just camp out at the buffet table.

Peter enters, dressed in his worksuit.  He scans the

room, sees Siri leaning against a wall by the buffet

table, drinking an orange juice.  He goes over to her.

Siri gestures to the far end of the room.  Susan stands

alone, sipping a chardonnay by an ANT MOUND exhibit.

Peter notices Siri seems unusually weary. She covers one

of her eyes.

She nods for him to go ahead.  Peter leaves.

Siri closes her eyes.  She rubs the bandage around the

insect bite on her hand.

PETER

approaches Susan.  She's staring through thr glass panes

of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons.  In the

refraction, their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem

to blend into one another.

She looks over at the crowd congregated around the

buffet table.

Peter looks at her.

Susan sighs.

Peter looks at her, notices that one of her hands is on

her stomach.

Susan nods.  Peter takes her hand. They sit by the ant

mound.

Susan looks up to see Siri standing on the other side of

the glass case.

One of her eyes is completely bloodshot. Her mouth is

bleeding. She puts her hand on the case to steady

herself.

Her fingers leave a STREAK OF BLOOD on the glass.

Siri collapses.  The exhibit tips over.

Peter pulls Susan out of the way just as the exhibit

FALLS AND SMASHES TO THE GROUND!

The room erupts into COMMOTION.

Susan and Peter run to Siri, who lies unconscious on the

floor.

Peter gently turns her over.

Siri's BLEEDING from the corner of her mouth.  Just like

the Chinese workers in the sweatshop.

Tuxedoed people encircle her next to the insect mounds.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

An ambulance races down the avenue toward a distant

hospital.

INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

Siri is rushed on a gurney toward the Emergency Room.

Peter and Susan walk next to it talking to DR. CHRIS

RAYMOND, a 35-year old ER physician.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM

Raymond, Peter, and several other ER STAFF work on Siri,

now lying on an operating table.

RAYMOND inspects Siri's wounded hand.  The bandage has

been removed.  The bite-wound is infected and

suppurating.  A large red circular RASH around it.

Peter shakes his head.

An ASSISTANT finishes inserting a catheter down her

throat.

Blood and fluid leak up through the clear tube.

ABOVE THE OPERATING THEATER.

Staring down through the circular glass deck, Susan

silently observes the procedures.

INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Salmon-colored LIGHT slants in from sodium vapor streetlight.

PAN through the shadowy room, past Manny's sleeping form to

Chuy, asleep under a tent made of an old Star Wars blanket.

A RHYTHMICAL CLICKING SOUND is heard from outside.

Chuy pops his head out from under the blanket, listening.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

Wearing only his pajama bottoms, Chuy steps out on the fire

escape with his spoons in hand.

The CLICKING RESUMES from the building across the street.

OVERHEAD VIEW

The barefoot little boy crosses the street, steps through the

center of the huge PAINT STAIN on the sidewalk.

The CLICKING sound comes again.

STREET LEVEL

The CLICKING comes again from inside the flophouse.  It

continues a little bit, then stops.

Chuy CLICKS his spoons together, mimicking the sound.

Beat.  A CLICKING from within again; almost an answer.

Chuy ducks under the yellow DOH tape, walks toward the front

of the building.

He comes to the boarded entrance.  There is a hole, narrow,

and low in the doorway.

Chuy squats, begins to wriggle through it.

INT. FLOPHOUSE - LOBBY

Chuy steps into the lobby.

The CLICKING comes again, from further inside.

Chuy moves to find it.

CHAPEL

Bits of STREETLIGHT slant in.  Chuy walks slowly, listening.

He steps into the SHADOW of a LOOMING FIGURE.  He turns...

CHUY'S POV - CRUCIFIX

We start on bleeding, nail-pierced feet, then TILT up the

twisted body to the face of Jesus, looking down.

CHUY

stares without emotion at the plaster figure.

MOVEMENT to his side.  He turns again.

A dimly-lit FIGURE stands before him.

Shapes fold and regroup in the darkness, resolving into the

tall figure of the OVERCOAT MAN.

The Man begins to emit the CLICKING NOISE from under his

chin, his whole head VIBRATING.

Chuy smiles.  He has a beautiful smile.

He plays his spoons, imitating the sound the figure made.

He is answered...but this time, it's from the other side of

the room. We PAN as he turns.

ANOTHER OVERCOAT MAN appears in the shadows.

Chuy GIGGLES, delighted.

INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM

Susan and Peter.

Susan glares at him.  Peter sits down by her.

Susan is silent.

Susan looks up at him. Finally, she nods.

He leans over, kisses her gently.  But Susan seems

hardly reassured.

INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN

The blue hours before dawn. Laconic movement outside.  New

York dragging itself out of bed.

We FIND Manny fixing some melted cheese sandwiches on a hot

plate. He addresses Chuy's tented bed behind him.

Manny cuts the bread in four equal sections and arranges them

in a star-shaped pattern. A breakfast ritual of some kind.

He walks over to Chuy's tent bed. He pulls the sheets aside.

His grandson is gone.

EXT. SEWAGE FILTRATION PLANT - PREDAWN

Sewage water BUBBLES in huge tanks.

A WORKMAN walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the

larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling

hooks.  Shoes, tires, rags...

A GRINDING SOUND is heard.  The Workman YELLS out to a

CONTROL BOOTH above.

SOUND of the pump coming to a halt.

The Workman walks to the filter area.  He sinks his grappling

hook into the polluted waters.

UNDERWATER SHOT

Spooky, silent. The grappling hook moves like a scythe to the

filter...

...past long, soft filaments of RAGGED TISSUE...

...and connects with a LARGER FORM.

ABOVE WATER

The Workman feels the grappling hook connecting.  He gives a

YANK, hooking whatever it is.

He begins pulling it up.

A PALE FORM bubbles to the surface.

The Workman's face goes pale.

A grating VOICE from the control booth is heard over the P.A.

It take the Workman a moment to speak.

The Workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good)

toward the edge of the tank.

He bends down, and now gets his first good look at it.

The Workman SCREAMS.

His grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage.

INT. HOSPITAL - ICU WARD

Susan watches Siri from behind a pane of glass.  Siri is

connected to a respirator, her vital signs monitored by

several machines.

Raymond approaches Susan, two cups of coffee in his

hands.

He smiles, gives her one of the cups.

Susan visibly relaxes.  She looks back at the ICU ward.

Beat.  Raymond shrugs.

INT. HOSPITAL - BATHROOM

At the sink, Susan runs water over her hands, her face,

trying to collect herself.  She looks up in the mirror.

We see that her eyes are swollen, tear-stained.

INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

She walks out of the ladies room, drying her face with a

paper towel.

SOUNDS of a nearby argument catch her attention.

Susan heads in the direction of the voices.

INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY NEAR MORGUE

An ORDERLY (JEREMY) argues with an EMT.  Their point of

contention:  a small FORM lying on a stretcher.

Susan walks toward them, catches sight of the tiny form.

Her eyes go wide.

Jeremy notices her.

Jeremy hesitates.  But if her tone wasn't enough, the

stare she gives him certainly is.

Jeremy backs away, takes off down the hall.

Susan approaches the stretcher.

Susan bends over it.  She covers her mouth and nose at

the stench.

But it's not.  What lies on the stretcher before them

looks more like a demon from a Brueghel painting.

A THREE FOOT INSECT.  It's mephitic, pink-white body is

rotten, falling apart.  The head's intact, with strange,

large jaws thrown wide open. The chitin on one is half

gone.

INT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM

Josh deposits a backpack full of equipment on the floor,

along with a small acrylic cage. Peter trains his FLASHLIGHT

into the bank of lockers.

Leonard, weary and pissed, looks at his watch.

Josh hands him a piece of paper.

Peter braces his legs and tries to push the whole bank of

lockers clear--the locker section tips and falls with an

ENORMOUS BANG, which echoes loudly off the tile walls. Dust

flies everywhere.

When the dust settles and flashlights are focussed on the

area of the wall where the lockers stood, we see a LARGE

HOLE.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Using a steel probe, Susan examines the dead insect.

Raymond lifts one of the wings.  A CLUMP OF WHITE LARVAE

feasts on the flesh underneath.

Susan closes the mandibles and examines them.

INT. SUBWAY TRACKS

Water DRIPPING from overhead, ECHOING footsteps- very

spooky.  Leonard leads Peter and Josh down the tunnel-

Monumental archways give way to naves as big as Notre Dame.

Josh flashes the ultra-violet light over an abandoned

underground encampment, made of cardboard walls, electrical

wiring, elaborate debris kitchens. The walls are completely

taken by layer after layer of hand carved initials and

messages. Everything from "Kilroy was here" to

elaborate quotations from the bible.

Their flashlights shine in a haze of brown dust. The air is

heavy.

They work their way down a steep incline. They're covered in

sweat.

Peter's cellular rings. He picks up -big static-

INTERCUT WITH:

MORGUE

Susan's got the phone up on her shoulder, clamped against her

ear. Raymond's cranking out a bunch of Polaroids. Color shots

of the insect, from every angle.

Jeremy goes to the fridge for a beer.

The fridge light plays over the large insects jaws. It makes

out a few new ridges and valleys. Raymond snaps a couple of

Polaroids.

Susan notices something weird and undefinable about the

contours of the claws... But she can't put her finger on

it.

BACK AT THE TUNNEL

The call is lost. Peter tries to change frequencies, but it's

useless.

Peter replaces the phone in his pocket.  He walks off.

No one notices the OVERCOAT MAN carving on the wall.

INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

On Manny's dining room table, a heap of unpolished shoes has

accumulated. The radio is playing a sad, elegiac Tango.

Looking disheveled and tired, Manny clutches the phone,

listening intently.

He holds a color snapshot of Chuy sitting on a mailbox.

Click. Manny slowly hangs up. He stares at his notepad, at

the number 2873.

He crumples it up, throws it away, crosses to the window,

picks up Chuy's last wire figure-

FIGURE, CLOSER

Another human-looking figure, long and thin, but with

something slightly off about it.

It has six limbs instead of four!

MANNY

frowns, looks down at the dark flophouse across the street.

Distant thunder is heard.

BATHROOM CABINET

Manny takes a STRAIGHT RAZOR from the bathroom cabinet, opens

the blade.

EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Susan arrives at the stairs leading down to the subway

station. A COUPLE passes her on their way up.

A sign over the entrance says "STATION WILL CLOSE FOR REPAIRS

AT 3 PM - TOKENS ONLY". Susan looks around- the area is semi-

deserted, a bit creepy.

She takes a deep breath, descends.

INT. SUBWAY - DAY

Susan pushes through the turnstile, enters the long corridors

of gleaming tile, a somewhat de-humanizing atmosphere,

straight out of a George Tooker painting.

Very creepy.  Susan's footsteps ECHO in the empty tunnel.

She sneaks a nervous glance over her shoulder- nobody is

following her-

PLATFORM "A" DELANCEY

Susan observes the locker room door impatiently. A small crew

of REPAIRMEN are dismantling a row of fluorescent lights.

She sits and waits.

INT. DEEP IN TUNNEL

Peter, Josh and Leonard walk through a darker area. The

floor beneath them suddenly changes, becomes tile.

Peter stops, looks around.

Josh walks to the right, where the smell seems to emanate

from.  At last they come to

INT. VAULTED AREA - CONTINUOUS

Josh LIGHTS a flare, sets it on the ground, walks ahead.  The

ominous RUMBLE of a subway is heard in the distance.

A cracked WATER MAIN above.  Water dribbles to the ground.

Leonard shines his flashlight ahead.

Revealed, quite literally, is a world of shit.

LARGE FECES scattered everywhere:  on the floor, hanging

sausage-like from the ceiling.  One can almost taste the

stench of old ammonia.

Peter puts on a rubber glove, inspects one of the fecal

stalactites.

Josh breaks off a sample, drops it in a jar with a hard

THUNK.  Leonard turns away in distaste.

EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

It's raining like hell. Manny approaches the abandoned

flophouse.

He peeks through the boarded-up front entrance. Right there,

on the dusty lobby floor, clearer than the larger

shoeprints...

...he discovers a trail of tiny, barefoot prints.

He kicks experimentally at the planks, but they're far too

strong.

ALLEY

Manny explores the opposite face of the building, looking for

a way in.

A DOG is BARKING incessantly. Manny turns.

Something moves in the shadows!  Something long and thin,

haloed  by the rain.

It moves again, the streetlight touching it for a fleeting

moment as it totters around to the rear of the building.

It's The Overcoat Man!

The man hurries past. Manny sprints after him.

ALLEYS

Manny comes running around a pile of grocery crates.

There is the OVERCOAT MAN.

CARGO WORKERS mill around a group of vegetable trucks,

unloading produce.

The OVERCOAT MAN attracts no attention. Keeping his head

down, staying near the shadowed buildings. Jumping and

hopping, he skitters into an alley.

FOLLOWING

Manny has to trot to keep up with the mysterious figure. He

pauses to take a pill and place it under his tongue.

Once it takes effect he moves on.

The OVERCOAT MAN has moved past a chainlink fence. How??

It's too high!!!

The old man squeezes through a jagged opening. The metal

fabric cuts his shirt.

On the other side: a dead end. Nowhere to go except

for...

A SEWAGE GRATE

Manny lifts it.

SEWAGE PIPE

Manny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty. He

flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor.

This pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt.

Something moves under a wet newspaper: a thick mass of long-

legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor.

Suddenly...the distant sound of spoons playing.

Manny pulls a rosary from his pocket, wraps it around

his wrist and crosses himself with the razor...

...then begins to move down the pipe.

PLATFORM "A" DELANCEY

Susan examines the Polaroids.  She pulls out a payday bar.

The crew of repairmen are leaving.

She munches on the bar. She stops: one snapshot has caught

her attention.  The fridge light illuminated this photograph.

Susan turns it around... and around... Trying to find

something different in the lines.

A train roars by.

Then she notices it:

THE POLAROID

The closed jaws. They look like A HUMAN FACE.

SUSAN

Gets up nervously and heads for the dor to the locker room.

A whole row of lamps goes off. The rest flickers in and

out.

Then we see, now standing on her platform: THE OVERCOAT MAN!!

He looks at her between a row of columns under the dead neon

lights.

Susan tries the locker room door. It's unlocked.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - SUSAN

carefully crosses the floor to the bank of lockers.

She kneels to examine the hole in the wall.  She nears a

noise.

THE OVERCOAT MAN is moving toward her.

OVERCOAT MAN

The man's face TIPS BACK...

...raising the complex, glittering INSECT HEAD FROM BEHIND

ITS MASK-LIKE FRONT JAWS.

Its multi-parted MOUTH clicks OPEN.

Susan SCREAMS!

The thing charges, its "coat" opening to reveal...SIX

LEATHERY WINGS, fully extended! The wingspan blocks the

whole tunnel, they vibrate rapidly.

Susan tries to run, but the creature -- hereafter known

simply as "The Mimic" -- LEAPS ONTO HER CHEST!

She's dragged screaming into the hole.

Their silhouettes recede rapidly amidst a confusion of legs,

wings and pipes.

INT. VAULTED AREA

Peter and Josh put the fecal samples into the back-pack.

Leonard stands at the other end of the area. He inspects some

OLD SCAFFOLDING set up at an opening which leads to

THE REMAINS OF AN OLD STATION

fifteen feet below.

It's like Grand Central's dead little brother. Tiled mosaic

walls, columns, monumental arches. Spaces for shops. A group

of abandoned turn-of-the-century subway cars on parallel

tracks.

Everything is gray with dust.

Leonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding.

A NYMPH -- big as the one seen earlier -- emerges from a pile

of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound.

Keeping his eyes fixed on the insect, Leonard coolly bends

down, picks up a ROCK.

PETER

putting the last sample boxes into the back-pack, looks up

and sees

LEONARD

step onto the scaffolding, raising the rock to crush the

nymph.

SMASH! Leonard tosses the rock at the insect, crushing it.

Peter rushes to the insect's corpse on the scaffolding.

A CREAK from the scaffolding at their combined weight.

Leonard grabs Peter, tries to pull him from the scaffolding.

CREEEEAAAAAK!

THE ENTIRE SCAFFOLDING GIVES WAY!

Buckling diagonally...

...taking Peter and Leonard with it...

CRASH!  Both Peter and Leonard are thrown to the ground of

the station below.  The scaffolding falls around them.

JOSH

rushes forward.

PETER AND LEONARD

stir in the wreckage.  Peter rises shakily.  He puts his

glasses on. One of the lenses is badly smashed.

He tries to help Leonard up; Leonard knocks his hand away.

Peter looks up at Josh.

Leonard brushes himself off, checks out his walkie-talkie.

It's been broken in the fall, a tangle of plastic and wires.

He curses under his breath.

Peter checks the wall for a handhold.  But there's only

smooth tile and dust.

Leonard removes his badge, tosses it up to Josh.

Leonard's voice echoes off the cavernous walls. Josh

hurriedly writes it down in his notebook.

Josh obeys.

INT. NICHE

We hear a persistent BEEPING...

A concrete ROOM filled with glimmering debris. Cans,

eyeglasses, fake teeth, chrome, foil, glass shards, broken

watches.

Susan lies unconscious, half-sunk in a mulch of decomposing

food, old newspapers, plastic garbage bags.  An inch of brown

WATER burbles past her bloody head.

SOMETHING jostles her, rocking her back and forth.

Her eyelids slowly open.

A HUGE MIMIC IS PERCHED ON HER BODY!

Its WINGCASE is drooped around her like a shroud. The

creature furiously tears at her jacket, trying to get at

Susan's beeper.

The beeper spills from her pocket along with several Pay Day

bars.  The Mimic CRUSHES the machine instantly, then chomps

up all the candy bars with a single move of its mandibles.

Susan watches in terror as the creature steps away.

A SOUND from an adjacent tunnel.  Susan looks...

...and sees ANOTHER MIMIC pulling the REMAINS OF A MAN into

the darkness.

Susan gropes around her in the soggy debris, looking for some

weapon.

SUSAN'S HAND

Her fingers close around a three-foot piece of RUSTY PIPE.

Something dark drips on her hand.

SUSAN

looks up. Above her, a badly decomposing HUMAN FOOT, or what

is left of it.  All part of the excarnated corpse of the

Chinese Preacher.  His gold cross shines boldly in the dark.

Susan GASPS.

THE MIMIC

hears the sound.  It immediately SKITTERS back to her.

SUSAN

jerks herself sideways...

AND STABS THE PIPE into the Mimic's thorax with a wet CRRK!

Susan heaves herself up, pushing the thing onto its back.

The Mimic BUZZES furiously, milky WHITE FOAM pumping from the

wound.  Its legs slash the air as it tries to right itself.

Susan runs for the tunnels, debris falling from her clothing.

JOSH

comes to a t-junction.  He checks his notepad for the

appropriate direction.

He turns, heads left.

INT. TUNNELS

Susan staggers through a dark PASSAGEWAY.  Water drizzles

into her grimy face.  She looks up.

Rain leaks from an overhead grate three stories up.  She can

see the SHOES of PEOPLE walking to and fro above.

EXT. STREET ABOVE - NIGHT

Life as usual on Delancey street.

Pedestrians crisscross the metal grate, hunched under their

umbrellas.  Traffic noise, T.V. displays on street front

stores, boom boxes, car horns...

They drown out the tiny sound of Susan's voice...

SUSAN

hears distant FEET SCURRYING toward her, punctuated by a

metallic CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!

SIDE TUNNEL

CLANG!  The metal pipe, still imbedded in the Mimic, BANGS

the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel.

SUSAN

looks around frantically.  She crosses to a METAL LID on the

floor, lifts it.

A HOLE is below, dropping off into darkness.

The Mimic's CLANGING grows louder.

Susan sits herself on the edge of the hole, grasping the

metal lid by handles on its underside.

The Mimic rushes into the chamber, speeding toward her...

Susan JUMPS into the hole, hanging onto the lid...

WHANG!  The lid SLAMS SHUT over the hole a fraction of a

second before the creature reaches it.

The Mimic touches the lid with its antennae, confused.

INT. HOLE

The TICK-TICKING of the Mimic's antennae scanning the lid.

Susan hangs from the handles on the lid, her arms trembling.

Susan's strength gives out.  She lets go, falls.

PIPE GALLERY

Susan CRASHES onto a juncture between two large PIPES.

She MOANS in pain.

CLOSER - SUSAN

secures her position, looks down.  A seemingly bottomless pit

below, crisscrossed with a FOREST OF PIPES AND DUCTS.

The nearest pipe above her is well beyond reach.

She is trapped.

Then she hears the SOUND of the LID OPENING above.  She holds

her breath.

A faint YELLOW LIGHT of a lighter flickers down at her.

WET SECTION

Josh cautiously enters a vaulted area.  Old pipes have been

ripped from the walls.  WATER gushes over the steel-plated

walls.  He looks around- this doesn't seem familiar.

Josh freezes as he sees something behind a loose metal PLATE

on the wall.

He yanks at the plate- it gives a little bit. He yanks

harder- the plate falls down on one side, hanging

precariously from a loose bolt.

It reveals A HOLE PACKED WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OOTHECAS.

He leans close to examine them- there is a NOISE in the

tunnel behind him-

JOSH'S POV - WATERFALL

A curtain of WATER falls over the side of a pipe onto the

floor.  Behind it, something ENORMOUS crawls into view.

Multiple legs, antennae, an elongated body distorted by the

water and the light of a flare.  It stops-

JOSH

Holding his breath and tiptoeing sideways, never taking his

eyes off the thing, Josh begins to move away.  He sees a

narrow OPENING in the wall- there seems to be dim LIGHT

coming from something beyond it.  He tries to squeeze through

the opening-

MIMIC

The creature is immobile behind the sheet of water, as if

mesmerized by its flow-

PIT - JOSH

With tremendous effort, Josh passes through the opening.

He finds himself inside a bowl-shaped mud hole.  Scattered

around him he sees FUNNY BUNNY PATCHES that were sewn in the

sweatshop.  He trips on a half-buried SEWING MACHINE.  He

looks up-

Above him is a grate.  He's come to the SHOWER ROOM of the

sweatshop!

INT. SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM

Empty now, except for the rusting sewing machines in a

corner.  We TILT to see Josh moving the grate away.  He

jumps- no way he can grab onto the slippery tile-

HIS HANDS SLIDE!!

PIT

Josh puts the old sewing machine upright.

OUTSIDE

Suddenly, the bolt hinging the plate gives way and... the

steel plate hits the ground: KLANGG!!

THE MIMIC

leaps into action!

PIT - JOSH

hears the CLICKING, fairly close.  He shines his light back

down the hole he entered through-

JOSH'S POV - THE MIMIC

moves past the waterfall and takes the wall at full speed.

JOSH

He stands on top of the sewing machine, wobbling, reaches for

the floor above-

SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM

Josh's head and one shoulder are in through the hole.  His

arms tremble. He makes a desperate lunge and manages to grab

the POWER CORD of one of the abandoned sewing machines.

THE MIMIC

rushes through the opening without even slowing down.

JOSH

pulls himself up, up-  WHAM!  The Mimic hits the lower part

of his body, BLOOD spraying up through the hole.  He SCREAMS,

grasps the cord with both hands!

He is brutally YANKED down into the hole, the sewing machine

tipping, then dragged across the tiled floor till it wedges

violently in the hole!

We track over to reveal, one of Chuy's perfectly

executed WIRE SCULPTURES. Sitting atop another sewing

machine.

INT. REMAINS OF THE SUBWAY STATION

A ring of FLARES burns in the darkness like an island.  Peter

lights another one, revealing a space buried in layers of

dust and time.

Cracked MANNEQUIN FACES stares out from an unopened TAILOR

SHOP.  A FLOWER PARLOR decorated with cobwebs.  A yellowed

NEWSPAPER on the floor, its headlines reading:  GERMAN TROOPS

DRIVEN BACK ACROSS RHINE.

Peter looks up to see Leonard approaching from the track.

Peter shines his flare up at a thick cord of cables which HUM

ominously with electricity.

Peter approaches him.

He pushes Peter violently. Their eyes lock and meet.

Inches away from a fistfight.

A SOUND rushing towards them, its echoes increasing by the

second.

Where is it coming from?

Peter looks at Leonard.  Leonard unbuttons his holster clip,

places his hand on his .22

A SHADOW appears outside the archway.

It steps onto the platform.

Leonard frowns.

The old man stumbles out of the darkness, out of breath. A

rusted crowbar in his hand.

Leonard walks over to him solicitously.

A shadow crosses Peter's face.

INT. PIPE GALLERY

OUTSTRETCHED HANDS in the darkness.

REVEAL Peter leaning across the void with one hand while

Manny and Leonard grip his other.

Susan below, balancing precariously on the crisscrossing

pipes. A mess, but still alive.  She reaches up to Peter.

It's too far.

Leonard and Manny pull Peter back into

INT. TUNNELS

Peter undoes his belt.

They obey. Peter buckles them together with his. He then

loops one end around a bannister, the other around his wrist.

Peter takes his word for it.  He uses the belts to lower

himself to the nearest pipe.

Leonard LIGHTS a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery.

Peter works his way down. The web of pipes seem to recede

into Hades.

The lifeline tightens.

Peter gets to the last solid footing, lies down on his

stomach and lets the belts down.

But then, he sees something move below her. Then a hollow

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

Leonard lets the flare drop from his hand.

It falls past them, ricocheting off the maze of pipes,

spinning down to the pitch-black below.

And for a split second the flame illuminates...

THE MIMIC

pipe in its thorax, nimbly CLIMBING THE PIPES TOWARD SUSAN

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

PETER'S

eyes grow huge.

LEONARD

just plain loses it.

SUSAN

knows all too well what's coming for her.

Throwing caution to the wind, Peter reaches the belt down.

Susan at last gets a grip.  Peter pulls with both arms.

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! Getting closer.

Susan struggles for footholds on the slippery pipes,

ascending foot by foot...

Peter pulls her into his arms.

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

Peter bends down.

Susan steps onto his shoulders.  He pushes her up...

And Leonard and Manny yank her out.

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

Peter scrambles up, SLAMS the lid back on the hole.

The four of them run.

HOLD ON the lid.

WHAM! It bursts from the floor, rolls away like a coin.

INT. ABANDONED PLATFORM

The four humans run down the empty platform.  Peter spares a

look back.

Far down the tunnel,

THE MIMIC HAS SPREAD ITS WINGS AND IS FLYING AFTER THEM!!

He points to the open DOOR of an ancient SUBWAY CAR.

They sprint for the car, get to the door.  Manny, Peter,

Leonard, then Susan...

INT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR

...tumble inside a repair car crammed with shelves and empty

crates.

Leonard and Peter both grab its handle, slide it shut...

SPLACK!  The Mimic crashes into it!

KLANGGG!  The door bulges out from the impact, almost

tearing itself off the hinges.

Susan jumps back.  Manny runs to cover her.

The creature is caught, half in, half out, antennae and

forelegs waving wildly!

The abdomen CRASHES through a pane of glass.

Leonard and Peter push harder, barely keeping it pinned.

THE UPPER HALF OF THE MIMIC TEARS ITSELF LOOSE.

WHITE BLOOD SPATTERS everywhere. The Mimic is NOW CUT IN

HALF!

The wings flap wildly, the abdomen shatters the safety

window's outer panels.

But the FRONT SECTION IS STILL ALIVE.  It scrabbles in,

spraying white blood...

...drags itself up on the ceiling, then down onto the floor

and under a row of shelves in a half-circle around the car

till it finally comes to a halt.

Silence.  The only sound is a SKITTERING outside.

Susan looks outside the window.

The Mimic's REAR HALF IS STILL TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH THE

DOOR, its feet blindly dragging along.

LEONARD

Peter says nothing. Leonard grabs him by the shirt.

Leonard releases Peter and, cocking his gun moves closer

to the still thing.

SNAP!  The Mimic POUNCES on him, catching his leg in its

front mandibles.

A sickening CRUNCH as the Mimic's mouth begins to work the

leg like a grinder-blender.

Peter and Manny try to pull the thing off as Leonard falls

and writhes on the floor.

BAM! BAM! BAM! The men flinch away as Leonard empties his

guns on it, until the thing's shell finally CRACKS!

But the thing is still locked onto Leonard's leg.  Peter

tries to work it free from the creature's jaws. No good.

Manny removes a can of shoe polish from his coat, then starts

smearing the stuff onto the Mimic's head and jaws.

He lights a CIGARETTE LIGHTER, goes to touch the flame to the

flammable stuff.

Peter hesitates, but lets him go.  Manny lights the polish.

WHOOSH...the Mimic's head is engulfed in a halo of flame. THE

LEGS LOOSEN THEIR GRIP.

Peter and Manny yank it free from Leonard, who's PASSED OUT

from the pain.  His leg is torn and bloody.

INT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR - LATER

We now see the car is 50's vintage.  A POSTER of Mickey

Mantle above an empty worktable.

Peter sits before Susan.  She's trembling, understandably

shaken from her previous experience.  BLOOD pours from a CUT

on her forehead.

Peter takes a bit of torn cloth, puts it to the wound, then

tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place.

Susan nods silently.  Her hand weakly presses the compress.

He turns to Manny, who sits solicitously next to Leonard.

His wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages. He begins to

stir.

Peter gets up, but Susan's hand is closed tightly around his,

like the jaws of the Mimic.  He kisses her gently, then

slowly manages to release his hand.

He walks to Leonard, inspects his wound. Touches the sole of

his foot.

Peter touches his foot again. Leonard finally nods.

Manny gazes at the Mimic carcass at the end of the car.

Peter looks at Susan.  She remains silent.

Peter looks up at her.

She gets up, finally moving.

OUTSIDE CAR

The subway car sits at the end of the platform, windows dimly

glowing in the dark. The door opens, and Manny and Peter

snatch the lower half and wing pieces back into the car.

INSIDE CAR - A LITTLE LATER

The lower half of the insect has been moved into the car.

Susan is reassembling it.

Susan displays the partly-charred head.

Susan closes the multiple mouth parts into a self-contained

bud shape, then pushes back the "face" mandibles.

She holds it in her hand, like Yorick's skull. The mimic's

head obscenely mirrors her own. She inserts it into the

shoulder cavity.

She stands back.

CAMERA cranes up and reveals that the thing now looks like

THE OVERCOAT MAN.

OUTSIDE OF THE CAR - IN THE TUNNELS

We see four shadows move fast, scuttling on the walls and

ceiling...

...heading towards the car...

INSIDE THE CAR

A SUBWAY MAP on the wall.  Red, blue, and orange lines

branching through the boroughs like veins.

The realization hits the others.

She's interrupted by a CLICKING from the tunnel ahead.

It's answered by CLICKING from the tunnel behind.

A brief glimpse down the car shows too many OTHER DOORS to

close in time.

Manny and Susan help Leonard up.

Peter turns off the flashlights.

Susan and Manny help Leonard to the car's CONTROL BOOTH.

Peter looks

OUTSIDE

where the silhouette of a MIMIC moves to the rear of the car.

CONTROL BOOTH

Leonard opens a box on the side-wall marked MANUAL OVERRIDE.

Inside, there is a large, HEXAGONAL SHAPED HOLE.

OUTSIDE

The Mimic is only yards away.

OTHER SHADOWS emerge from the distant dark.

INSIDE

Manny leaves Leonard and Susan to look for the lever crank.

He runs to help Peter try and shut the doors manually.

But it's useless.  Many of the doors won't budge.

OUTSIDE

The shadows get nearer, their CLICKING louder...

CONTROL BOOTH

Susan looks under the dashboard, finds a HEXAGONAL SHAPED

ROD.  The lever crank.

Susan gives it to Leonard. He JAMS the rod into the hexagonal

shaped hole.  Perfect fit.

Leonard begins CRANKING the thing.  But it's rusty and

slow...

THROUGHOUT SUBWAY CAR

The doors begin to swing shut very slowly.

OUTSIDE - A MIMIC'S POV

sees the moving doors, starts heading for them.

CONTROL BOOTH

Leonard can't crank fast enough.  Susan joins in, putting her

hands over Leonard's.  Both spin the thing as fast as

possible.

SUBWAY CAR

Peter and Manny each pulling on a door, trying to speed up

the closing process.

SHADOWS are seen approaching, now very close.

CONTROL BOOTH

Leonard and Susan put all their effort into turning the crank

one more time...

SUBWAY CAR

A SOFT CLICK as the doors SHUT IN UNISON.

Silence.

All four are stock still, like a submarine crew awaiting the

blast of depth charges.  Their eyes dart to the

WINDOWS

caked with soot, irradiated by the distant glow of one of the

red flares.

THUCK! Something BUMPS against the door.

A machine-gun patter of FOOTSTEPS on the roof.

The car SHAKES.

OUTSIDE

The dark platform is alive with phantom shapes.

INSIDE

SCREEECH!! Something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a

nail over a chalkboard.

THUMP! THUMP!  Impacts on the sides...

An obscene symphony of sounds as Mimics lay siege to the car.

PETER

A BUZZ OF WINGS catches his attention.  He turns.  His face

is reflected in a security window.

CRACK!  The window SPLINTERS, destroying Peter's reflection.

ABOVE MANNY

Claws SCRATCH the ceiling. It begins to dent.

BELOW SUSAN AND LEONARD

Large forms CLICKING underneath, looking for a way in.

Susan stares at the floor, her eyes following the course of

the clicking...

...which leads to Leonard's wounded, bloodstained leg.

KLANGGG!  A Mimic leg PIERCES the ceiling above them!

Susan pulls Leonard out of the way just in time as

IN THE SUBWAY CAR

KLANG!  KLANG! More legs break through the ceiling!

SUSAN AND LEONARD

emerge from the control booth, Leonard's arm over Susan's

shoulder.

But there's not time enough to discuss possible solutions.

Leonard pulls off his jacket. Susan begins wrapping it around

his wound to mask it. Manny helps.

Peter has upended one shelf, jamming it against a broken

window as a barricade.

Despite their efforts, the Mimics are not thrown off the

scent.

The whole car is now shaking and buckling.

She looks over at the severed Mimic corpse nearby.  A

realization...

Manny looks at her blankly. Susan just takes the blade.

The whole car is now shaking and buckling.

She runs to the Mimic's carcass.  For a moment, she

hesitates.  But the pandemonium leaves her little choice.

She SLICES into the Mimic's corpse with the razor...

...sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow...

...and pulls out two fat AMBER SACS the size of

softballs.  She SLICES them open.

Orange GOO leaks out, its stench overpowering.

Peter looks up as Susan slides one of the sacs over to

him.

Holding his breath, against the stench, he smears the

crap on the windows, the doorframe...

MANNY

looks to the roof, listening.

And remarkably, the SOUNDS of the Mimics START

SUBSIDING.

Susan comes over to Leonard, begins dabbing the goop on

Leonard's wound.  Leonard makes a face at the stink.

She smears the floor area behind Leonard. The activity winds

down gradually, and finally comes almost to a halt.

SUBWAY CAR - LATER

Leaning against the dirtied window, Manny creates a streak

for every Mimic he sees.

Peter, Leonard and Susan are hard at work. Leonard has

created a small "model" of the station using pocket debris

and the wall map.

Manny's lighter represents the subway car.

THUMP! An oily, soft abdomen brushes lazily up against

the glass. Manny moves away.

Tense silence. He points at the glands on the floor.

Susan knows they have no other choice.

LATER

Susan is stuffing Leonard's old bloody bandages into the

thorax of the dead Mimic.  She ties a flare to its center.

Manny is spreading the mucus-like liquid of the gland-sac on

himself and Peter as Leonard instructs them-

The two men look into each other's eyes.

Leonard's hard feelings give way to an almost

imperceptible smile.

Using a ballpoint pen, he draws a schematic on the back

of Peter's hand.

SUSAN

approaches Manny, who looks distractedly out the window.

Manny doesn't respond.

READY TO GO

Susan dabs at Peter's face with the last touches of the

scent gland substance.  She doesn't meet his eyes as she

speaks.

Peter barely nods, his nerves clearly on edge.  He

instinctively goes to wipe his forehead.  Susan stops

him.

Leonard turns to Susan and Peter.

Leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.

Susan has her hand on Peter's chest; Peter is taking deep

breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat.  It's

an odd parody of Lamaze exercise.

A final breath.  He's about as calm as he's going to get.

He looks at Susan a long moment. He takes her hand.

A sad, nervous smile appears on Peter's face.

Susan kisses him softly on the lips.

Manny approaches.  Show time.

Susan steps away from Peter. She looks toward the control

booth.

LEONARD

begins turning the lever crank slowly.

SUBWAY DOORS

gradually begin to open, and stop half way.

The darkness outside is alive with CLICKING.

PETER AND MANNY

slowly move between the opening of the door and make their

way to

INT. PLATFORM

They step onto the dusty concrete.  Come to a stop.

SUSAN

watches nervously for the reaction of the Mimics

OUTSIDE

LARGE SHADOWS pass far and near of Peter and Manny; but none

of the Mimics seem to care about them one way or the other.

Peter and Manny exchange looks: a moment of relief.  It's

working.

Peter slowly moves right along the track to the nearby POWER

BOX.

Manny goes left, starts to make a longer journey across the

platform to the SWITCH ROOM.

SUBWAY CAR

Susan moves away from the door, goes over the Mimic carcass,

filled with the bloody bandages.

PLATFORM - BY THE TRACKS

Peter makes his way to the edge of the platform, whispering

to himself.

He lowers himself slowly to the track.

PLATFORM - NEAR THE SWITCHROOM

Manny moves toward the door.  A large WINDOW OF DUSTY GLASS

reflects his image...and the distant ones of the Mimics.

BY THE TRACKS

Peter gets to the track.  He turns

And is met FACE TO FACE WITH A MIMIC!

Its antennae move toward his head, curious.

Its human-mask face plate clicks apart and together.

Peter remains stock still.  He starts breathing deeply...

SUBWAY CAR

Leonard has now fully opened the doors.

SUSAN

pulls the tipcase of the FLARE tied to the dead Mimic's

midsection.  FSST!  The flare SPARKS alive.

The sudden light draws the attention of several Mimics

outside.

Susan pushes the carcass toward an open door at the front of

the car...

...and with a HEAVE, throws it onto the front track.

OUTSIDE

The other Mimics take instant notice.

BY PETER

The Mimic before him suddenly turns.  In a flash of speed,

it's gone, heading toward

THE DEAD MIMIC

stuffed with the bloody rage, the thing sends its fellow

into a feeding frenzy.

The other Mimics begin TEARING into it, ripping their brother

to shreds in cannibalistic orgy.

SUBWAY CAR

Susan watches in disgust.

Leonard turns the lever crank again.  The doors begin to

shut.

PETER

breathes a sigh of relief.

He goes to the powerbox, opens it up.

He shines his flashlight down on the back of his hand.

The simple chart tells him what to wire:  BLUE WIRES TO

THE GREEN WIRES.

He looks back up at the powerbox.  His face falls.

All the wires are a GROSS BROWN, their colored plastic

casings having long ago faded into goo.

INT. SWITCHROOM

Manny enters. The space is even more dusty than the rest of

the station. Spiderwebs strung over old machinery.  White

Doric PILLARS support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1940s

style LAMPS are built into their side.

Manny looks around.  Off to the right, right next to the

rusted track switch board, he heads for the COUPLING SWITCH.

Once there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he

waves back to LEONARD.

He pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. But his hands

are shaking, under enormous tension. Some of the pills

scatter on the floor. He puts the box away and leans

against the wall.

A CLICKING nearby catches his attention, echoing from the

entrance of ANOTHER ROOM.

It is not the sound of the Mimics; but rather, of METAL.

Spoons.

Manny follows the sound.

BY THE TRACK

Peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way.

He wipes off the brown gunk, tries to discern any semblance

of color.

He feels himself start to sweat.  He tries to relax.

Breathes...

INT. ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM

The space is larger than the switchroom.  The walls and

ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency.

Manny heads in further, locates the levers and waits.

Something pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet

away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half-light.

A RUSTLING behind him.  Manny turns around.

He swings the light onto Chuy, sitting on the floor before

the remains of a RUSTY COLUMN.  That beautiful, emotionless

smile on his pale face.

BY THE POWERBOX

Peter has made all the necessary connections.  He turns now

to the fuse-section.

A red throw-switch is there, and two big slots for fuses.

One is still occupied.

The other one empty.

CU - PETER'S FOREHEAD

BEADS OF SWEAT begin to form.

SUBWAY CAR

Susan watches the Mimics at their feast.

All of a sudden, they begin to stop, as if losing interest.

Susan steps back, looks around desperately for a flashlight.

ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM

Manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture

of "come to me".

In the darkness, something that looks like a PALM FROND

floats gracefully down from the ceiling, making see-saw

gestures as it falls through the air.

Manny shines his flashlight on the floor.  It's not a palm

frond.

It's a wing.

Manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls.

The place IS COVERED WITH MIMICS.  They are in the middle of

a vicious mating ritual.  The males tear savagely at the

females wings as they proceed to mount them.  A chaotic

clusterfuck.

Manny is sickened.

CHUY GIGGLES. Manny shines his light ahead. Manny's face

falls.

The WHITE PILLAR BEHIND CHUY IS MOVING...

...unfolding...

...at last revealing...

AN ALBINO MIMIC!  Another leap for evolution...

Its form is different from the other Mimics.  Sleeker, more

supple, almost beautiful.  And while its movements are still

not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to

them that at the very least entrance us.

The thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny

boy.  It stands over him like a king over his court fool.

Chuy giggles happily.  It's all a game to him.

The Albino CLICKS in response -- a long, leisurely sound, as

if trying to communicate with the boy.

Chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a

perfect imitation of the sound.

Manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with

huge, expressionless 'eyes'.  He turns to Chuy-

The Albino CLICKS his jaws, moving in toward Manny.

CHUY

plays his SPOONS in perfect imitation.

MANNY

stands under an archway in a swirl of dust. He raises his

arms, like a prophet. He lets go of hsi razor and kneels.

His vacant eyes, fill with tears, he prays quietly, a strange

serenity invades him.

The Albino's jaws open and charge.

PLATFORM

Some Mimics advance toward Peter's direction.

SUBWAY CAR

Susan desperately waves a flashlight and bangs the window,

trying to attract their attention.

BY THE TRACKS

Peter BREAKS the arm off one of his glasses.  He jams it at

the empty fuse.  It SPARKS.

PLATFORM

THUMP!  The electricity COMES ON...

The lamps on the columns BURST INTO FLAMES from the power

surge.  Fire illuminates the station like a Greek temple.

BY THE TRACKS

Peter climbs up onto the tracks...

...sweat staining his forehead...

Peter wipes it and removes the scent coating.

THE MIMICS

clearly react, sensing the chemical change, like bees

reacting to honey.

SUBWAY CAR

LEONARD

looks at the now lit control panels, tries to decide which

button to press. He begins to press each one in turn.

PETER

hears the sound of spoons playing.

He turns to see Chuy, standing by the outside of the switch

room.  The boy smiles. A flashlight shines behind him.

But the thing holding the flashlight is anything but human:

The ALBINO steps into view, moving eerily like an unstrung

puppet. His claws and jaws are coated in blood. Chuy joyfully

announces the arrival like a little drummer boy.

THE MIMICS

climb over the roof, moving toward the rear of the-

SUBWAY CAR - CONTROL BOOTH

Susan runs in.  SLAMS her hand down on a button.

FSST!

THE SUBWAY CAR

The doors open.

Peter hesitates, takes a step toward Chuy.

Chuy seeks shelter behind the Albino's legs.

The albino charges toward him.

Peter bolts for the car.

THE MIMICS

jump and land

SUBWAY CAR

just as Peter squeezes through one of the doors.

BAM! THUD! The doors dent. Glass cracks.

Susan presses the button. The doors close again.

CONTROL BOOTH

Leonard throws the dead man's switch by the control board.

SUBWAY CAR

JOLTS into action.

OUTSIDE

The train LURCHES forward.

Wheels spark and kick into gear. The mimics scramble and re-

assemble quickly, ready to attack.

THE ALBINO

changes position and charges towards the car.

THE MOVING CAR

reaches a "Y" section.  The car moves to the track to the

right.

INSIDE SUBWAY CAR

Leonard's eyes go wide as he sees

OUTSIDE CAR

It keeps bearing right. Further away from their destination.

...towards an old STORAGE YARD in their path.  Idle cars and

repair equipment on the tracks.

A crash seems inevitable.

INSIDE THE CAR

Leonard pulls

THE BRAKES

but they don't work at all.

From below the car we see the wheels spinning freely,

heading for collision.

INSIDE THE CAR

Susan grabs Leonard from the control booth. To Peter

They rush back against the opposite door.

STORAGE YARD - SUBWAY CAR

CRAAASHH!!  The car BASHES into a parked section of train in

a GRIN of tearing metal...

...flips off the track...

...and onto its side...

The car skids to a stop.  SPARKS fill the air.

INSIDE SUBWAY CAR

All three are hurt.  Leonard's leg wound has reopened. Peter

has badly damaged his right arm.

Peter nods painfully.  Susan to Leonard.

Peter and Susan sling Leonard's arms over their shoulders.

They raise him up.

OUTSIDE SUBWAY CAR

They move unsteadily outside.

They head off over a concrete island in the direction of the

correct track.

FURTHER BACK

The Mimics and the Albino moving closer.

PETER AND SUSAN

try to hurry, but it's no use given Leonard's condition.

Peter and Susan both disregard the order.

Leonard suddenly grabs his POLICE BATON from his belt

clip.  He pushes the two away.

Leonard turns away from them.

Peter goes to get Leonard, but Susan stops him.  This MTA

officer is staying put.

Reluctantly, the two begin down the tunnel.

LEONARD

takes a stand by the third rail, baton in hand.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FURTHER DOWN

Peter and Susan run.

An open CAGE ELEVATOR on a platform nearby.  A sign overhead:

AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

They rush toward it.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNELS - "Y" SECTION

Leonard stands like a guardian to the tunnel mouth.

SOUNDS of the Mimics approaching. He glances at the third

rail beside him, then down the track.

The sound gets louder.

Leonard raises his baton in top MTA form.

THUD!  Several Mimcs slam onto Leonard!

Leonard goes down, HITTING them futilely with his baton.

They begin to tear at his limbs.

Leonard rolls...

...kicks his good leg out...

...and CONNECTS WITH THE THIRD RAIL.

AN ARC of ELECTRICITY lights up the darkness, consuming

Leonard and the Mimics.

INT. BY THE CAGE ELEVATOR

The crackling sound echoes through to Peter and Susan.

Susan hits the elevator button again.

Peter has unbarred the gate.

SUSAN

looks up, into the shaft.

THE ELEVATOR

coming down, but it's taking its own sweet time.

Peter pulls her into the shaft, closes the security gate

behind them.

INT. SHAFT

A skeletal framework on each side.  Just enough for a

handhold.

Peter steadies Susan as she climbs in beside him.  She

balances on the narrow ledge.

Peter SLAMS the cage door shut, latching it.

He shows her the first hand and foothold.  Susan grabs on.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL

The Albino amkes its way forward, flanked by two Mimics.

It stops.

Turns toward the elevator.

INT. SHAFT

Susan hauls herself up the framework, handhold by

handhold. Peter is right below her.

She can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously

with the effort.

Peter grinds his teeth, trying to make the next

handhold.

WHAM!  Something hits the gate below them!

INT. BY THE ELEVATOR GATE

The Mimics are tearing at the metal gate.

The Albino remains still, watching them work.

PETER AND SUSAN

Susan's arm and legs are shaking now.  Her breath starts

catching in her throat with the effort.

Susan tried, but can't.  She tries to pull herself up to the

next level.

Susan pulls herself up.

REVERSE

We look down past them as they climb.  Two of the Mimics and

the Albino have gotten into the shaft!

The Albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against

opposite walls.

SUSAN AND PETER

Susan is crying, barely any strength left.

Peter does his best to stay in control, but in truth is

barely hanging on himself.

LIGHT hits them from the shaft above now, SOUNDS of PEOPLE

TALKING and a muffled P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT filter down.

MIMICS

rushing upward on the shaft wall, higher, higher.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

Peter's hands grab onto the grating of the gate on the next

floor.

KCHUNK! is heard above them.  Peter looks up.

Now the elevator is coming down.

Peter pulls Susan up till she can grab it too, both of them

able to get a foothold on the ledge-

He begins to KICK on the gate, trying to tear it free.  Susan

looks back down.

SUSAN'S POV - SHAFT

The Mimics rush up, closer, closer.  The Albino opens its

mandibles.

SUSAN AND PETER

both KICK at the gate, it gives, Peter pulls Susan through

to the

INT. SUBWAY TRACK

Peter and Susan stumble away.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

The Albino sees the elevator approaching from above.

It gives a few CLICKS to its minions.

The two other Mimics race up the shaft...

...toward the elevator...

...and WEDGE THEMSELVES IN ON EITHER SIDE!

They are CRUSHED instantly.  But the elevator is stopped just

above the open gate.

With just enough room for the Albino to get through to

INT. SUBWAY TRACKS

Susan and Peter run.  There is LIGHT just up the tunnel.  We

hear VOICES.

They go for it.  At last, they make it to

INT. A PLATFORM

Susan and Peter stumble forward.  Light streams down from

overheads. Susan turns.

SUSAN'S POV

The Albino spills out onto the track behind them.

Sleek, streamlined, light glancing beautifully off it.

SUSAN AND PETER

turn back...

HEADLIGHTS hit them as we hear the ROAR of a SUBWAY TRAIN

heading at them from the other side of the platform!

They run.

ALBINO

runs, faster than any other Mimic.

TRAIN

The express train BLOWS its HORN, RUSHING FORWARD.

PLATFORM - COMMUTERS

Weary late-night COMMUTERS stand half-asleep on the tracks.

A sleepy-eyed little girl points, tugging on her mother's

hand.

PETER AND SUSAN

MOTORMAN

The driver sees the battered couple...

He reaches for the brake...

SUSAN AND PETER

They reach the edge of the platform, the HORN deafening as

the train speeds toward them.  Peter pushes Susan up, leaps-

INT. TRAIN - CONDUCTOR

We RUSH toward his horrified face.

THE ALBINO

directly ahead.

The train, still flying, PLOWS INTO IT...

...flattening, grinding, pulverizing...

...until the windshield of the subway car is covered in white

blood.

The motoran leans on the brake, his eyes screwed shut in

primal horror. The train SQUEALS to a stop...

ON THE PLATFORM

Susan and Peter collapse on the cement floor in each others

arms.  Heaving and weeping.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - NIGHT

COMMUTERS turn to stare as Peter and Susan move across

the floor.  Both bruised and bloodied, leaning against

each other, heading for the exit.

Some DERELICTS observe them with curiosity.

A trio of MTA cops start towards them.

But Peter's voice evidences a lack of conviction now,

he's trying to convince both Susan and himself of

something he doesn't fully believe.

He hurries to meet the MTA cops. Susan looks up.

SUSAN'S POV

Commuters move to and fro, moving up and down and in and

out of the illuminated areas of the station.

In the crush of onlookers is one deadpan face-  a MIMIC,

hugging the shadows, waiting for its moment!

We PAN 180 degrees to the other side of the platform-

there, briefly glimpsed is ANOTHER, and ANOTHER.

We TILT down to the throng below.

The electrified VOICE of the train ANNOUNCER suddenly

FADES UP, telling of departures and delays-

We raise above Susan's head-

DOWN ANGLE

-culminating in an OVERHEAD VIEW of the main terminal.

The movement continues. But from here, the people are

dots, their importanec no greater than that of a colony

of ants.
