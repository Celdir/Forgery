-- but she didn't notice the school kids. She's looking in

the other direction, at a trickle of SMOKE wafting up over a

nearby fence.

Doug follows as she walks toward an OLD TEMPLE, nestled

beneath a skyscraper. A collision of the ancient and modern.

The fence surrounds a GRAVEYARD adjacent to the temple.

A JAPANESE MAN stands before an ornate headstone, lighting a

bundle of incense and bowing before the grave.

CLINK. She turns as Doug, grinning, lights a cigarette with

his Zippo, flicking it shut and pocketing it.

Doug's grin softens to a smile. He doesn't respond... but

the way he's looking at Karen makes her curious:

He turns away for a moment, almost shyly, dropping his

cigarette and crushing it. Finally:

She smiles.   A tender moment.   Then... he checks his watch.

Karen checks her own watch, realizing --

She grabs his hand and starts to walk quickly.

Then Karen walks through the doors into a bright, atrium-like

lobby area. She waves "hello" to the RECEPTIONIST.

Leaning against a desk behind Reception is Karen's boss ALEX

(40s, American). He's got a phone to his ear -- it's

ringing. An ANSWERING MACHINE picks up in Japanese.

Alex mutters and hangs up.   Then he notices --

She's started up a STAIRCASE in the center of the lobby.   She

turns and comes back down, walking over to Alex.

Alex smiles, holding out a file.

Karen takes the file and opens it, looking at the first page -

- a picture of an OLDER WOMAN (EMMA) is attached.

Studying the file, Karen squints.

Karen seems unsure.   It's a big step for her.

One of Alex's CO-WORKERS appears in the doorway, motioning to

him. Alex quickly hands Karen a card:

Karen is washing the dirty sheets in a bucket and hanging

them to dry. She finishes, turning to her charge.

He finds his travel mug, wrapped in the sports section of an

American newspaper. Matthew scans it as he fills his mug.

No response from his wife. He turns to see Jennifer looking

down at Emma through the window.

Matthew walks over, puts an arm around her.

She turns to him.

This makes Jennifer feel better.

Matthew looks back down at his feet.      Susan misreads:

Matthew abruptly stands.    Looming over his sister.

He moves forward, right into her. His momentum pushes Susan

back into the foyer. She holds onto his shirt:

Matthew's hands suddenly TIGHTEN ON HER SHOULDERS. His eyes

grow wide, filled with anger, as he whispers fiercely --

Susan watches as he repeats himself, over and over.      Growing

scared, she finally SHAKES HIM.

Matthew slowly looks up.    Malice on his face.

He steps forward.   Susan backs away.

He hands Alex a wedding picture of MATTHEW AND JENNIFER.

Something about this gives Alex pause. Nakagawa speaks

briefly to Igarashi in Japanese, then hands Alex a card.

Nakagawa and Igarashi exchange a look.

Nakagawa heads for the front door as Igarashi continues to

interview Alex.

There's nothing to run away from,

Kat. No one blames you for what

happened.

She trails off, trying to remember.   Doug waits.

Doug sees her frustration, and tenderly brushes a hair from

her face.

She turns away. Doug wraps an arm around her.   Karen leans

into him, and he strokes her hair.

The moment is broken by a soft KNOCK. Detective Nakagawa

stands in the doorway, holding a thick FILE.

Doug stands, intercepting Nakagawa.   He sticks out a hand.

Nakagawa nods. Fixes Doug with a blank stare.   Taking the

hint, Doug turns to Karen.

Reluctantly, Doug kisses her brow, then exits. Nakagawa

pulls a chair up to the bed and sits, putting the file on a

small table.

She notices Nakagawa isn't taking notes. He seems somewhat

uncomfortable, as if he's building to something:

I don't think so. I think it

belonged to a woman.

Nakagawa looks up.   Karen tries to explain:

Nakagawa frowns, scribbles a note.

She thinks, recalling:

Nakagawa immediately tenses. A long beat. He can see how

exhausted Karen is. But something's troubling him:

He slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out THE PHOTO

Karen found, and taped together. He shows it to her.

Karen looks at the picture.

Nakagawa stares down at the picture in his hands.

And Karen notices -- Nakagawa's hands are shaking.

He looks up at her, a faraway look in his eyes.

From the expression on Nakagawa's face, she's onto something.

Nakagawa holds Karen's gaze for a moment. Even in her

exhausted state, it's clear -- she's as frightened as he is.

THE FRONT DOORS. He hits a final light switch and is almost

to the exit, when --

-- he suddenly SLIPS. Almost falls.    Saves himself by

throwing a hand up against the wall.

He looks down.    What the hell did he slip on?

A pool of liquid. Right by the front doors, where the ladder

stood earlier. It's too dark to make out what the fluid is.

Alex looks down at HIS HAND -- it's covered in the liquid.

And there's a dark HANDPRINT where he grabbed the wall.

HIS POV: a trail of FOOTPRINTS lead from the pool of liquid,

around the base of the stairs.

His eyes on his dirtied hand, Alex slowly reaches for the

nearby light switch. The overheads come on --

-- the liquid is deep red.   Blood.

Alex looks across the room. Shaking, he starts to walk

forward, following the footsteps.

He pauses at the bottom of the stairs, seeing --

-- the BLOOD TRAIL has stopped.   Right by the bottom step.

Alex looks up the staircase.   No blood.

After a moment, Alex starts to walk up.    As he reaches the

first landing --

He freezes.   Sensing something behind him.   He turns to see --

YOKO. Head lowered, clothing is torn and bloody. She's

slowly climbing up the steps, but she's MOVING JERKILY, like

a marionette, her limbs making a strange CREAKING as if

tendons and muscles are being pushed to their limits.

And there's BLOOD DRIPPING DOWN, splattering on her shoes.

She keeps moving, straining, climbing... towards him.

The Coroner shakes his head. Nakagawa looks to Igarashi,

then walks up to the second body, pulling back the sheet.

IT'S YOKO.    Still missing her jawbone.

Nakagawa and Igarashi stare down at her in disbelief.

The Coroner walks to the small table, removing the cloth.

Yoko's JAWBONE is underneath it.

The Coroner nods.    Eyes on his shoes.

The Coroner, lost in his imagination, answers quietly:

A beat.   Nakagawa walks to the jawbone.   Stares at it.

The Coroner looks up at him, his face pale.

Doug studies her for a moment.

She watches Doug as he thinks.   Carefully.

Karen gives Doug a skeptical look.

Karen stops walking.   Considering something.

She hesitates, realizing she's said too much.

Karen's eyes never leave his.   Softly, but firmly:

After a moment, Doug pulls her into a hug.

But her eyes speak differently. She covers it well, stepping

back and glancing over at the reception desk:

He kisses her, then exits. He pauses at the front doors to

give her a little wave. She smiles... but the smile droops

as soon as he's out of sight.

After a moment, she turns and walks to the front desk.

Her voice trembles, her fear showing through.

A beat.   Karen's eyes plead with Doug.

Doug looks away, shaking his head.

Karen's face darkens.   Before she can retort --

-- the phone RINGS. As Karen walks across the room to answer

it, Doug starts reading the newspaper article.

She listens.   Her face slowly drops.

She numbly lowers the phone.   Doug turns to her, seeing that

something's very wrong.

Snapping to life, Karen walks to the desk, picking up the

photo of Peter and Maria's condo and a map of Tokyo.

Doug puts a hand on her shoulder.    She finally looks at him.

Doug, surprised, doesn't know what to say.   Karen doesn't

give him a chance to figure it out:

Karen pulls away, making for the door.   Doug follows.

A beat. We see the resolve come over Karen's face.   She

reaches out and touches Doug tenderly.

She leaves.

Doug, troubled, turns back to the desk.

He looks up at the wall, tracing a finger over the photo of

The House. Beneath it, is the address...

Maria turns back to her, sadness on her face.   Then:

Maria reaches for a pack of cigarettes.   Lights one.   Offers

them to Karen. She shakes her head.

Maria takes a drag from her cigarette.    Waiting.

Karen struggles to find the answer.

Karen nods.   Maria's brave face slips.   She turns away.

Maria turns back.   She only looks defensive for a moment.

Maria speaks softly, forming words she's never spoken aloud:

She wipes away the tears in her eyes.

Maria turns away, growing tense.

She turns back to Karen -- to find the young woman sitting

slumped on the edge of a sofa, tears in her eyes.

Maria softens as Karen looks up at her, pleading:

As Karen flips through them, a definite pattern emerges --

-- Kayako is in practically every picture.

And in most, she's not smiling at the camera.    Rather, she's

staring at Peter.

We move to THE GROUP PHOTO. Peter with Maria, surrounded by

classmates. Kayako off to the side, her eyes on Peter.

No answer. She slowly walks to the bedroom and looks inside.

He's not there. This seems to worsen Karen's mood.

Karen looks down at a NOTEPAD. She's written THREE JAPANESE

NAMES. The detectives in charge of the case three years ago.

They all have red lines drawn through them.

Then we PAN UP to see that these are the last names on a

longer list. We recognize the other names: MATTHEW,

JENNIFER, and EMMA WILLIAMS; YOKO and ALEX; NAKAGAWA and

IGARASHI. Everyone who's been in The House.

Everyone who died.   All the names have been CROSSED OUT --

-- except `Nakagawa' and `Igarashi'.    Karen picks up a red

pen and draws a line through them.

Then we see one final name at the bottom:

`Me.'   Now the only one not crossed out.   The only one left.

Karen puts down her pen.    Then she looks up at --

-- THE WALL, where's she's taped all the pictures and

articles in a circle.

Karen realizes something.    She reaches for the lamp, and

turns it closer --

-- the picture in the middle of the "spider's web" is gone.

The photo of The House.

Karen draws a breath. Then, out of the corner of her eye,

she sees something she hadn't noticed before --

-- a faint red FLASHING from a small table by the kitchen.

She slowly stands. Walks over to it. The flashing red light

is barely visible on her face, as she looks down at --

-- HER ANSWERING MACHINE.    The message light is blinking.

`1 MESSAGE'.

She reaches out a shaky finger and presses `PLAY'.

HIS POV: it's a journal Kayako kept. As Peter flips through

it, KAYAKO'S VOICE speaks the words...

...and even though it's mostly Japanese, there's one word we

recognize, that she's written repeatedly --

-- "Peter". It's been written over and over, in both English

and Japanese, as if she couldn't get enough of seeing it.

Past the early pages Karen saw, THE WRITING becomes more

manic, the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl,

KAYAKO'S VOICE becomes more desperate and pleading.

Taped on the final page is A PHOTO: PETER with a group of

his University friends, at a party. Kayako has scribbled

hearts around his head, and SCRATCHED OUT the other faces.

A bloody THUMBPRINT distorts Peter's face.   It's still wet.

Peter slams the book shut and drops it. As he does, a

PHOTOGRAPH falls out from inside, landing right-side up.

THE PHOTO is of PETER at a college party, talking with MARIA.

It's clear they're having a great time with one another...

...but the photo is TORN IN HALF, splitting Maria's face.

And KAYAKO is visible between them, sadly and stoically

watching Peter, strands of hair falling down her face.

Peter and Karen both reach to pick up the photo at the same

time -- and they BUMP SHOULDERS. Karen falls backwards,

against the wall.

In disbelief, Peter looks around wildly. He reaches out a

tentative hand, feeling around... Karen moves out of the way.

She can't understand how this could be happening.

As Peter is about to stand back up, SOMETHING small flutters

down from above, landing on the floor in front of him.

It's KAYAKO'S FACE.   One of the missing pieces from the torn-

out photographs.

Peter slowly looks up to see --

-- ALL THE MISSING KAYAKO FACES have been pinned to the

closet door. Many of the pins go through HER EYES.

And that's when Peter and Karen hear THE FLIES.   Buzzing

anxiously. Sounds like there's a lot of them.

It's coming from THE CLOSET.   Just behind the torn-out faces.

Karen watches, terrified, as Peter reaches out a hand --

-- and slides the door open.

He immediately recoils.    A terrible stench inside.

The BUZZING of the flies is louder.    Coming from above.

Peter pulls a book of matches from his pocket.    Lights one.

And looks up.

HIS POV:   the attic panel is slightly open.

Peter reaches up to open it fully --

-- AND THE UPPER HALF OF KAYAKO swings down.

She's been wrapped in plastic sheeting, mottled splotches of

blood on the inside. Her neck hangs at an odd angle.

130   INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT               130

131                                                               131

As Peter slowly turns to look down, a small PALE HAND slips

into his own. Peter jerks backward in shock as --

A SERIES OF IMAGES, THE ORIGIN OF "THE GRUDGE", FLASH BY:

-- TAKEO, looking down at THE JOURNAL, reading his wife's

words, his face contorted with rage... he turns to see

KAYAKO, home from work, standing in the doorway...

-- KAYAKO running down the steps, TAKEO chasing her, tackling

her before she can reach the door... sitting on top of her,

he wraps his hands around her neck...

-- KAYAKO seeing TOSHIO, her son, watching through the bars

of the second floor railing as...

-- TAKEO snaps Kayako's neck with an audible CRACK...

-- KAYAKO, not dead, but paralyzed, watching as...

-- TAKEO drowns a flailing TOSHIO in the bathroom tub...

-- TAKEO tears apart TOSHIO'S CAT, still alive, in the

bathroom sink...

-- KAYAKO letting out a HORRIBLE CROAKING, the only sound her

broken neck can emit, as TAKEO advances on her with a knife,

his eyes filled with a manic madness...

-- TAKEO in THE ATTIC, stuffing KAYAKO and TOSHIO, both very

dead, wrapped in plastic sheeting, into a corner...

-- KAYAKO suddenly TURNING HER HEAD and GRABBING TAKEO'S

ARM... her lifeless eyes focusing on Takeo's as she CROAKS...

Takeo's eyes go wide with fear... and TOSHIO suddenly reaches

from his plastic grave, grabbing Takeo's other arm...

BACK TO THE PRESENT:

We PAN FROM Peter to THE REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR --

It's not the pale, frightening Kayako anymore. Rather:     a

beautiful, young Kayako with eyes filled with sorrow.

We PAN BACK to see KAREN standing there, instead of Peter.

Karen slumps to the ground in front of the mirror, the

revelation taking everything out of her.

A beat.   Then:

THUMP.

Karen looks up as the sound continues. We PAN OVER towards

the stairs as A DRAGGING sound moves across the ceiling.

Accompanied by a strange SCRAPING, like plastic.

She suddenly freezes, sensing something next to her. We see

it now, as she turns her head, almost hidden in the darkness--

-- a PALE FACE in the darkened hallway, staring up at the

ceiling. Eyes wide and rolled back, mouth yawning open in

abject terror --

-- it's DOUG'S BODY. He lies on his back, his top half

sticking out from a niche by the stairwell. It's been right

next to her all along.

Karen takes Doug into her arms as the SOUNDS continue above,

growing closer. But it's no use -- he's dead.

And now there's a new sound, moving down the stairs. A

familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND, along with a strange

SKITTERING, like the world's biggest cockroach.

Karen turns to the staircase to see --

-- KAYAKO, crawling down the stairs. Still wrapped in the

plastic sheeting, she moves like a wounded animal, neck

hanging limply, struggling to pull herself forward --

-- her eyes locked on Karen, CROAKING horribly --

Karen sorrow turns to abject terror. She tries to lift

Doug's body and pull it to the front door. It's too heavy.

And KAYAKO is getting closer.

Sobbing, Karen drops Doug and falls back against the front

door, bumping into --

THE GAS CANS. The one Nakagawa unscrewed TIPS OVER, spilling

gasoline into the entryway.

As Doug's arm flops to the floor, his outstretched HAND lands

next to Karen. She sees something clenched in his fingers --

-- his ZIPPO LIGHTER.

Realization dawns over Karen as she feels the liquid spilling

onto her hands. The odor is unmistakable.

Karen immediately reaches forward, trying to loosen Doug's

grip on the lighter as --

-- Kayako reaches the bottom of the stairs. Her broken neck

makes a horrific CRACKING as she swivels to face Karen.

Karen finally gets the lighter. She pushes back against the

door with legs too numb to stand. Her eyes drift up to see --

-- TOSHIO, watching from the railing above, as before, his

cold eyes locked on hers.

Karen grabs another can, and spins the lid until it pops off.

She tips it onto the floor, spilling more gas.

ON KAREN, as she is surprised to see...

KAYAKO. Beautiful and meek. She's smiling, walking hand-in-

hand with TAKEO. A happy couple.

As they reach the front door and go inside, Kayako turns back

to the front gate. She smiles and gestures, "come on".

And then TOSHIO walks forward, through the gate.   His

attention is on a tiny BLACK KITTEN in his arms.

At the door, Toshio turns to look back over his shoulder --

-- DIRECTLY AT KAREN. They hold each other's gaze for a

moment, as if he somehow sees her in the ambulance.

Then Kayako gestures to Toshio, and he turns away, entering

The House and closing the door.
