FADE IN:

EXT. PRAGUE - NIGHT

On a hill above the city is an old CATHEDRAL. The night is

spooky, with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones

and medieval walls.

A NERVOUS YOUNG HACKER makes his way down an alley.

There is a DOOR at the end of the alley. MUSIC can be faintly

heard from inside.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

High above the street an INTRUDER DRESSED ALL IN BLACK spies

from the roof. He's watching with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.

He pulls out a CROSSBOW and FIRES.

A BOLT flies, trailing CABLE.

THUNK! It sticks into the alley wall below.

EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT

As he passes by the ominous Cathedral, the Hacker spins,

sure he's heard something.

But there's nothing there. He continues on.

Then the Intruder comes sliding down the ZIP-LINE from above.

WHAM! He kicks the Hacker into the wall, knocking him out.

The Intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled

features of a dashing BRITISH SECRET AGENT. His name is

STERLING.

Sterling searches the Hacker and pulls a SMALL BLACK CASE

from his coat. Inside the case is a DATA CHIP. Sterling tucks

it away.

Sterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp TUXEDO

underneath. He pulls out CAR KEYS. In a quick insert we see

the "ASTON-MARTIN" LOGO.

As he strolls back out the alley, he HEARS something and

flattens against the wall.

A BLACKED OUT SUV screeches to a stop, blocking his exit.

The SUV's HEADLIGHTS illuminate the slumped Hacker.

BAD GUYS get out to investigate, pulling out weapons.

Cornered, Sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in

the shadows. He gets to that DOOR the Hacker was heading

towards.

As he PICKS THE LOCK Sterling can hear MUSIC from inside. He

smooths his hair and prepares to "blend in" with the crowd.

INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

Sterling comes through the door and his face falls. He's

stepped into a loud METAL CONCERT.

We see a GO-GO DANCER in LATEX. Onstage is RAMMSTEIN, a

bizarre German industrial-metal band.

The tattooed YOUNG CROWD slam dances and swings glo-stix

over their heads. Some wear rubber BRAIN SKULLCAPS outfitted

with fiber optic lights. It's a sea of SPIKED HAIR and BONDAGE

OUTFITS.

Sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd.

With his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken

coop.

ON THE BALCONY ABOVE THE CROWD stands a wild haired young

GANGSTER with PIERCED BROWS. With him is a STREET-TOUGH GIRL

with multi-colored hair. They look like a post-Apocalyptic

Bonnie & Clyde. They are YORGI and PETRA.

Yorgi checks his watch. His delivery is late. Then his CELL

PHONE rings. He's getting the news from outside.

He looks down, spots Sterling amidst the moshing crowd. With

that look, that tux, there's no mistaking what he is.

They make EYE CONTACT and Sterling gives a little nod.

Yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone.

Immediately VIKTOR starts moving in Sterling's direction.

Viktor is huge, with a MOHAWK and a six-inch GOATEE.

Sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit, pushing

through the freaky crowd.

EXT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

Sterling's ASTON-MARTIN VANTAGE screeches away from the curb.

INT. ASTON-MARTIN - MOVING - NIGHT

Sterling is at the wheel of his spy car. He plugs the DATA

CHIP into the dash and punches buttons. A computer screen

says "DATA DOWNLOADING".

He sees a BLACKED-OUT SUV racing up behind him.

He accelerates and hits a SWITCH.

ARMORED PLATING slides up over the rear window.

EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT

The SUV is right behind him. Viktor rolls down the passenger

window, readies his PISTOL.

The rear bumper of the spy car opens. SMOKE BOMBS drop out.

They explode in MASSIVE CLOUDS, obscuring the narrow, street.

Sterling skids around a corner.

The blinded bad guys drive straight into a STOREFRONT. Glass

and merchandise flies as the SUV gets stuck.

The Aston-Martin rounds another corner and slides to a stop.

Blocking the road ahead are two more SUV's.

A MOTORCYCLE slides to a stop in front of them. The rider is

ANDERS, a leather clad biker who looks half Viking.

Anders pulls out a SILENCED SUB-MACHINE GUN and starts

BLASTING.

BULLETS SLAM into the Aston-Martin, cracking the bullet-proof

glass, shattering headlights, and BLOWING OUT THE FRONT TIRES!

Sterling jams it into reverse and backs around the corner on

the RIMS.

INT. ASTON-MARTIN - IDLING - NIGHT

Sterling notices an ERROR MESSAGE now flashing on his computer

screen: "TRANSMISSION ERROR: - DATA PARTIALLY SENT".

Sterling looks around desperately. Somehow he's got to get

this data out of here.

Straight ahead is the RIVER. Chugging up the river: a PARTY

BARGE.

PARTYGOERS in formal attire dance to an orchestra. A SWIMMING

POOL is in the middle of the deck for a perfect water landing.

He hits a BUTTON.

EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT

The rear license plate folds down, revealing a ROCKET ENGINE.

Flames spew as he jams down the accelerator.

Sterling is pushed back into his seat by the G-forces.

SPARKS fly from the rims as he skips across the pavement at

ever increasing speed.

Anders FIRES with his gun, but Sterling is getting away!

But then KIRILL steps around the corner. He's academic

looking, a CHAIN SMOKING intellectual with COKE-BOTTLE

GLASSES. He's also a highly proficient and cold-blooded

SNIPER.

Kirill puts his lit cigarette behind his ear and unslings a

SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE LAUNCHER from his shoulder.

The Aston-Martin reaches the riverbank and goes AIRBORNE. It

ROCKETS through the air towards the party barge.

We see the car REFLECTED in Kirill's glasses as he AIMS.

On a little SCREEN we see the missile launcher HOME IN on

the HEAT SOURCE of the jet engine.

The missile locks-in and FIRES...

HEATSEEKER P.O.V. - we see a GREEN CAR with all its hot spots

GLOWING RED. Camera ROARS towards the flying car.

INT. ASTON-MARTIN - FLYING - NIGHT

Sterling sees the missile streaking at him.

EXT. THE RIVER - NIGKT

WHOOMPH! The Aston-Martin EXPLODES in mid-air.

Partygoers shriek as the AXLE and FLAMING RIMS rain down on

the deck.

Kirill takes the cigarette from his ear, PUFFS IT.

Finally, Sterling's flaming BOW TIE flutters down and lands

on a LEAPING SALMON ICE-SCULPTURE above a tantalizing SEAFOOD

BUFFET.

EXT. WASHINGTON D.C.

A STRAFING SHOT over the city. We make a sudden left turn

and SPEED OUT OF TOWN.

We shoot over to the BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS of VIRGINIA. In

the middle of NOWHERE we dive towards a COMPLEX OF BLACK

BUILDINGS.

INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Inside it's modern, cold and high tech. An elevator COUNTS

DOWN to a deep basement level.

The doors open and a TALL MAN man with a PROSTHETIC LEG

strides down the empty hall. AGENT GIBBONS is African-

American, a battle-scarred WARRIOR. Even with a limp he looks

sturdy, confident, deadly.

At the end of the hall is a METAL DOOR.

INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - NIGHT

Gibbons walks into the INFORMATION ROOM of the NATIONAL

SECURITY AGENCY (NSA). There are WORLD MAPS, SATELLITE IMAGES

on COMPUTER SCREENS, TECHIES monitoring everything.

If a nuclear war broke out, you could run the country from

down here.

Gibbons takes an elevator up.

INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The office is expensive yet devoid of personality, reflecting

the shadowy nature of it's owner. One wall is GLASS, looking

down on the information room. SAM TANNICK, grizzled NSA chief,

looks down at the activity below.

Gibbons enters, stands by the desk.

Sam remains in shadow.

Gibbons snaps on the giant FLATSCREEN on Sam's desk. He starts

cycling through PHOTO AFTER PHOTO of TOUGH LOOKING MEN.

Gibbons clicks off the screen.

Sam sighs, stares out at the information room.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

The huge ARCO TOWER rises up towards a moonlit sky.

We see ACCOMPLICE #1 (TRAVIS PASTRANA) sneak up and take

position behind a FOUNTAIN.

ACCOMPLICE #2 (CAREY HART) sneaks across a roof and takes

position overlooking the fountain position of #1.

ACCOMPLICE #3 (DAVE MIRRA) takes up position in the second

story window of a FLOPHOUSE HOTEL down the street.

A MESSENGER (BOB BURNQUIST) skates up to the front of the

skyscraper with a PACKAGE. He gets the attention of the

SECURITY GUARD inside. The Security Guard unlocks the door

and lets him in.

Just then a VAN pulls up and ACCOMPLICES #4 (SHAUN PALMER)

and #5 (MAT HOFFMAN) hop out. They open up the back and a

BICYCLE is rolled out of the back by a MAN IN A HOODED JACKET.

Jacket Man rolls the bike to the skyscraper and enters the

lobby.

INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - NIGHT

The Security Guard is checking his computer.

K The Guard glances up as Jacket Man gets into an ELEVATOR.

The Security Guard rushes to intercept him. The Messenger

kicks his skateboard out, TRIPPING UP the Security Guard.

The Messenger hauls ass out the door. The Security Guard

pulls out his WALKIE-TALKIE.

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

The button for "91 - ROOF ACCESS" is lit up. Jacket Man waits

patiently.

INT. 91ST FLOOR - NIGHT

This fancy office is empty for the night. The STAIRWELL DOOR

opens and a PLATOON of SECURITY GUARDS rushes in. They take

Up position in front of the elevator doors armed with BILLY

CLUBS and TASERS.

DING! The elevator arrives and the door swings open. But

there's NOBODY INSIDE.

One Guard steps forward and suddenly a bicycle SWINGS DOWN

from the ceiling, TAGGING HIM IN THE FACE. He falls back,

TASERING another Guard.

Jacket Man drops down onto his bike and pedals through the

chaos before the Guards know what hit them. There's a CURVY

PIECE OF ART in the room, some kind of modern art statue.

Jacket Man rides up the artwork like a ramp and does a

TABLETOP AERIAL over a DIVIDER. He hits the ground pedalling,

the Guards hot after him.

Jacket Man enters a HUGE OPEN ROOM with a FIELD OF CUBICLES

in the middle. He bunny hops onto a desk and SLIDES TO A

STOP. He tosses back his hood and we get a good look at him

for the first time.

He is XANDER CAGE. He's got a shaved head, bizarre TATTOOS

all over his body and multiple PIERCINGS. He's lean and

heavily cut, even dangerous looking.

The Guards charge at him and he HOPS up onto the top of the

CUBICLE WALL. This thing is maybe FOUR INCHES WIDE and FIVE

FEET TALL.

He pedals across the top of the cubicle wall, the Guards

scrambling after him.

Xander bunny hops over one guy's head onto the next set of

cubicles and pedals hard. The Guards fall all over themselves

trying to catch him.

At the other end Xander catches air and lands on a CONFERENCE

TABLE. He does a WHEELIE across it's length with Guards

closing in.

Xander springs up and does a TAIL WHIP, knocking them back

with his rear wheel. He lands and pedals to the stairwell

untouched.

EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

Xander bursts out of the stairwell to the top of the TALLEST

BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN LA. He climbs on a RAISED PLATFORM.

From here he can drop down onto another level that is strewn

with SATELLITE DISHES and MICROWAVE RELAYS.

Guards rush onto the roof and try to corral him.

Xander tears off his jacket, revealing a BACKPACK on his

back and VIDEO CAMERA on his chest. He pulls out a ROAD FLARE

and SPARKS IT. We see there are SOAKED RAGS tied to his

SPOKES.

He LIGHTS THEM with the flare. Then he TOSSES THE FLARE off

the building.

EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT

The Accomplices see the flare drop. #'s 1, 2 & 3 pull CAMERAS

OUT and start filming.

EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

Xander races around the roof like a trapped animal. He evades

Security Guards, picking up speed.

With Guards right behind, he drops off the TOP PLATFORM and

lands on a massive SATELLITE DISH.

Using the dish as a ramp, Xander LAUNCHES himself OFF THE

TOP OF THE BUILDING. We're talking 90 some stories here.

He spins through the air, his bike on fire. He's doing end

over end backflips. One... Two... Three... Four...

He's looping through space on his bike, a crazy man on a

flaming bike against a backdrop of sleek skyscrapers and

night lights.

The stunt is covered by the various Accomplices and Xander's

own chest camera, in SUPER 8 and DIGITAL VIDEO, from four

different angles.

Xander ditches the bike, kicking it away from him and plummets

towards the ground.

At the last moment he throws out a "bucket" and his PARACHUTE

OPENS.

EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT

The bicycle comes flying down and SMASHES into the pavement.

It bounces a full TWO STORIES back up before coming to rest.

Xander glides down and makes his landing. Accomplices #4 and

#5 rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the

van. SIRENS APPROACH as the van makes it's escape.

As COP CARS screech up to the skyscraper, one of them RUNS

OVER the smoking wreckage of the bike.

TITLE SEQUENCE - HARDCORE MUSIC plays as we see a flowing

TAPESTRY OF FLORID TATTOOS. SILHOUETTED against this backdrop

we see the OUTLINES of NUDE WOMEN riding BMX BIKES in a HALF-

PIPE, BLADING ever obstacles, SKY SURFING and doing street

SKATE TRICKS. It's a collision of outlandish imagery that

tells you one thing: This ain't your daddy's spy movie.

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Xander, now on a MOTORCYCLE, zips through traffic. He's

smiling, leaning it way over on the turns. He's got another

BACKPACK on his back.

EXT. LOFT DISTRICT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

Xander drives his motorcycle into the garage of his building.

INT. XANDER'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT

A FREIGHT ELEVATOR rises up, bringing Xander and his

motorcycle into the loft.

There are EXTREME SPORTS ACTION POSTERS on the walls,

MOTORCYCLE PARTS and BARBELLS on the floor, and everywhere

there's EXTREME SPORTS EQUIPMENT of every description.

There's a NEATLY FOLDED FLAG hanging in a slightly crooked

FRAME on the wall. Xander straightens it as he goes by.

He hears her in the sectioned off "bedroom" and heads back

there.

He comes into the bedroom to find SKY, his long-suffering

girlfriend. She's a wannabe artist type. She's got SUITCASES

and BOXES scattered around and she's PACKING.

He opens up the backpack, revealing WADS OF CASH.

She sorts through the money.

He pulls off his shirt. Pierced through his nipple is a

DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.

She heads towards the front door.

Just then the door BLOWS IN.

CRASH! -- the windows SMASH IN too. Then the LIGHTS GO OUT

as STORMTROOPERS in black body armor rush in, weapons drawn.

It's a blur of FLASHLIGHTS, PISTOLS and JACK BOOTS. It's

scary as hell. A professional take-down.

They slam Xander against the wall.

Just like that it's quiet again. Sky hyperventilates, a gun

in her face.

The Stormtrooper looks at Sky. She nods. The Stormtroopers

take their guns off her.

Sky grabs up here stuff. She looks back at Xander.

She heads out.

The Stormtrooper pulls out a DART GUN and SHOOTS Xander. He

pulls a CHROME DART from his chest, examines it.

Xander slides to the floor.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. PAN'S DINER - DAY

A SIDEWAYS IMAGE: an out of focus COFFEE CREAMER.

Xander wakes up with his head on the counter of a DINER. He

shakes out the cobwebs.

WHIP PAN as a WAITRESS walks by. Xander blinks.

Xander looks around, sees a TRUCKER chewing with his mouth

open. A SALESMAN buried in his NEWSPAPER.

Xander gets up. Where the hell is he? He takes a step towards

the door.

The Waitress pours him coffee. QUICK PUSH TO: her hands are

shaking.

Xander sits. When he swigs his coffee, he notices something

written on his napkin in shaky ballpoint: "S.O.S."

What the hell? He looks at the Trucker. The Trucker's staring

at the waitress. QUICK PUSH TO: The Trucker has a BULGE

underneath his vest... then PUSH TO: The Salesman's eyes

darting about suspiciously, newspaper pulled up to his nose.

Something is going down...

He hears a SLOWED DOWN VOICE and glances back at the Trucker,

who's now fixing him with a DEATH STARE. Xander snaps from

his reverie.

The Trucker and the Salesman look at each other. Suddenly

they jump up.

The Trucker pulls a PISTOL from his vest, the Salesman

brandishes the SHOTGUN he had behind the paper. The Waitress

cringes.

Xander stays strangely calm, his senses now fully focused.

The Waitress let's out a whimper.

She goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses

on the floor. Xander springs into action.

He CHOPS down on the Trucker's arm and ELBOWS him in the

face.

Xander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out

from under him.

The Salesman pumps on his shotgun, but it seems to be jammed.

The Salesman fights with his gun but can't get it to work.

Xander advances on him.

He unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw.

The Salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors.

Xander turns to the terrified Waitress.

She stares at him, unable to speak. He raises the gun.

The front door bell JINGLES. A guy with an impeccably tailored

suit and a cane hobbles in. It's Gibbons. There a problem,

Mr. Cage?

He aims at the Waitress and FIRES! She's startled, but unhurt.

Xander tosses the gun on the counter. Gibbons gives a sly

smile.

Gibbons sits in a booth. Xander sits across from him. In the

background the Waitress helps the Trucker and Salesman up.

There's a POP and Xander clutches his stomach. Gibbons tosses

his DART GUN onto the table. Xander blinks at him.

He pulls another CHROME DART from his gut and examines it.

WHACK! He goes face down on the table.

CLOSE ON - XANDER'S FACE

He comes to, blinking in low RED LIGHT. He's shocked to find

that he's...

INT. AIRPLANE - TWILIGHT

Xander's on the floor of a military aircraft. TWO OTHER TOUGH

GUYS are waking up next to him. One's a greaser named VIRG,

the other is T.J., ex-Navy.

Xander notices as they each pull out CHROME DARTS. They sit

up, looking at each other. Xander chuckles.

The three laugh, realizing they're all in the same boat.

They quiet down as they notice for the first time, THEY ARE

NOT ALONE.

Sitting silently on benches facing them are SOLDIERS DRESSED

IN BLACK. They wear BLACK MASKS over their faces. They are a

nasty looking BLACK OPS TEAM.

The Black Ops Team, just stares.

Virg notices something STRAPPED TO HIS BODY. They all have

them.

Then the red light switches to GREEN.

One of the Soldiers opens the JUMP DOOR. The rest of the

team advances on Xander, Virg and T.J.

They drag Virg to the door and THROW HIM OUT. T.J. goes next,

kicking and fighting.

Then they turn on Xander.

Xander jumps out on his own.

We see him tumbling away from the airplane. Far below his

chute BLOSSOMS OPEN.

EXT. A FIELD - TWILIGHT

We see three chutes coming down. The first two HIT HARD.

We ROCKET IN on the last chute as Xander lands like a pro.

The other guys run up to him. Then they hear SHOUTING in

SPANISH.

They wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as

they TAKE OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

Xander runs low down a culvert. There's SHOUTING all around.

He flattens down and crawls up over the rise. What he sees

stuns him.

We crane up to reveal A FIELD OF POT PLANTS. There's a COCAINE

PROCESSING PLANT along the field's edge. The whole place

looks exactly like a Central American DRUG FARM.

NARCO TERRORISTS run around with AK-47's.

Xander sneaks past EQUIPMENT covered in CAMOUFLAGE NETTING.

A squad of Narcos runs by and Xander makes his move.

He rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the

HEADLIGHTS of a truck.

Narcos hop out and charge forward.

Xander raises his hands.

They grab him and haul him away.

INT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT

We see a RUSTY MEAT HOOK. A CHAIN is wrapped around it.

Attached to the chain, his arms over his head, is Xander.

He's in the middle of a bleak looking room. There are

BLOODSTAINS on the wooden walls, the floor strewn with filthy

HAY.

Behind him against the wall Xander sees T.J. and Virg both

HOG-TIED.

There's a BLOOD STAINED TOWEL COVERING a TABLE near the door.

Then they hear talking outside and the door is UNLOCKED.

A very nasty looking Marco comes in. By his look he's the

LEADER.

Narco Guards bring in one of their PARACHUTES and toss it on

the floor. They exit, closing the door behind them.

Jefe goes to the table throws back the towel. Beneath it are

HIDEOUS, BLOOD ENCRUSTED TORTURE DEVICES: a HACK SAW, a BOLT

CUTTERS, KNIVES, CHISELS, a BLOW TORCH.

T.J. and Virg both crack up. Jefe gives them a withering

look.

Jefe passes his hand over the various tools. He finally

settles on a crude MACHETE. He walks amongst them brandishing

it.

He stops in front of Xander.

He BACKHANDS Xander across the face.

Jefe SLAPS him again.

Xander looks over at T.J. and Virg.

A low THUMPING is heard outside. It's the sound of approaching

HELICOPTERS, lots of them.

Then the night ERUPTS in GUNFIRE. It sounds like a full scale

assault outside.

Jefe goes into a fury. He SWINGS his machete at Xander's

legs.

Xander JUMPS UP, grabbing on to the chain above, and KICKS

Jefe in the chest.

Jefe falls back and Xander climbs up to the roof BEAM.

He grabs onto the beam with his legs and UNHOOKS his chain

from the meat hook.

He drops down, six feet of chain still hanging from his cuffed

wrists, and Jefe comes charging at him.

Xander dodges a few wild swings.

He grabs Jefe's PANT CUFF and dumps him on his ass.

Jefe scrambles to his feet, drawing his PISTOL.

Xander swings his chain and WHIPS the gun out of Jefe's hand.

With another swing he WRAPS the chain around Jefe's neck and

pulls it taught.

Jefe nods, choking, and reaches into his pocket.

Instead Jefe hurls them out the window.

Xander jerks the chain, slamming Jefe head first into the

wall. Jefe drops, knocked out.

Outside it sounds like a full scale FIREFIGHT. Xander gets

the machete and CUTS the ropes holding T.J. and Virg.

Then a HAIL OF BULLETS sprays through the room.

All three guys hit the deck but T.J. gets shot. He clutches

his side, BLOOD all over his hands.

Xander knows this is true.

He checks out T.J.'s wound.

Virg bolts for the door.

EXT. DRUG FARM - NIGHT

Narcos are shouting, running to and fro.

TRACER ROUNDS cut through the air. They are trying to repel

an UNSEEN ASSAULT FORCE.

Overhead SIX MILITARY HELICOPTERS buzz the compound like

Apocalypse Now, their NIGHT SUNS lighting up the place.

Xander comes out of the torture building holding T.J. in a

fireman's carry. His hands are still CUFFED, the length of

chain dragging.

Xander crouches behind some equipment, putting T.J. on the

ground.

Xander moves on, finds cover under the camouflage netting.

He can see Narcos shooting into the trees at the UNSEEN ENEMY.

Looking the other way, he spots Virg running back his way.

He's been corralled by one of the Helicopters.

He's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's Night

Sun.

Xander darts out and GRABS him, pulling him under the

camouflage netting.

The Helicopter lights up the camouflage netting.

They're pinned down.

They squat down in runners stances, the helicopter kicking

up DUST all around them.

They jet off in opposite directions.

Xander books, running for all he's worth. His cuffed hands

and the dangling chain make it difficult.

He's heading straight into the FIELD OF POT PLANTS.

Suddenly the massive SPOTLIGHT picks him out.

The CHOPPER swoops down after him.

Its big GATLING GUNS turn, aiming right at him.

BRAAAAAAAAPPP! The guns cut loose, tearing up the ground

right behind him.

Xander sprints, the chopper after him like Cary Grant in

"North By Northwest", except instead of corn fields, Xander's

running through a field of HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS.

Xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him.

Xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the

plants.

All around him it's a chaos of Helicopters and GUNFIRE.

Two choppers attack the factory building, BLASTING it with

their guns. Narcos run terrified.

Xander notices a FAT PURPLE BUD on the plant right in front

of him. He SNAPS IT OFF.

He tucks it-into his shirt and takes off through the POT

FOREST.

Xander finally spots a vehicle. It's a TRUCK LADEN WITH BAILS

OF COCAINE. He heads for it.

Then the SPOTLIGHT finds him again and the Chopper swings

around. The gatling guns RIP the plants to pieces all around

him.

Xander hauls ass, heading for the truck.

Bullets chew up the dirt all around him.

As the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns RAKE THE TRUCK.

There is a FLASH as the GAS TANK goes up.

WHOOOOPPHH! A SUPERNOVA OF FIRE AND HIGH-GRADE COKE erupts

into the night air.

Xander dives into a DRAINAGE DITCH. He tumbles down into

FILTHY WATER.

A powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white.

Near him is a big DRAINPIPE leeching sewage. Xander crawls

inside.

The Chopper makes another pass overhead.

The big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on.

Xander gives a sigh of relief. He crawls out of the drainpipe.

JEEPS race by on the road right above him as MILITARY MEN

flood the compound. There's no going back.

Xander turns and makes his way along the tree line.

The chopper and gunfire are in the distance now. Things are

quieter here and he starts to relax. Bad idea.

As he goes by, one of the TREES moves.

He takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on

EXPLODES UPWARDS. ARMS reach out, tackling Xander from behind.

Another TEAM of BLACK OPS SOLDIERS bursts from the weeds,

the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape.

They fall on him like a curtain.

XANDER'S P.O.V. - Soldiers hold him down while a BLACK HOOD

is pulled over his head.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - DAY

As the MASSIVE HANGER DOORS CLOSE we can see CHOPPERS taking

off and landing. MEXICAN SOLDIERS load Jefe and his Narcos

onto a FEDERALE BUS. Virg resists and is BEATEN. T.J. can be

seen being loaded into an AMBULANCE.

The hanger doors slide shut with a THUD.

We see Xander's HANDS as the CHAINS are cut away.

Xander sits in a chair with the BLACK HOOD still over his

head. He blinks when the hood is torn off. A Black Ops Soldier

smirks as he walks away.

Xander looks around, sees the Black Ops Team unpacking some

STRANGE GEAR. Two of them are dumping bottles of a CLEAR

LIQUID into a RUSTY CLAWFOOT BATHTUB.

The Black Ops guys grin knowingly.

On the other side, Xander sees a FLIGHT CREW readying a

GULFSTREAM for travel. Gibbons steps up from behind him.

Xander gets up and Gibbons leads him on a stroll around the

As they walk by the Black Ops guys, Xander sees they're

getting busy. One spreads out a plastic DROPCLOTH. Another

plugs in a BONE SAW.

Gibbons grabs a CHICKEN LEG from a guy eating lunch.

He tosses it into the tub. Instantly it starts to SIZZLE and

BUBBLE. The tub is full of ACID.

In seconds the entire leg has been consumed, leaving only a

oily cloud of residue.

Gibbons eyes him coldly, nailing the point home.

Gibbons kicks the back of Xander's leg and dumps him on his

ass. Gibbons was so quick, Xander never saw it coming.

The Black Ops guys clap and cheer, always interested in a

fight.

Xander gets up.

Gibbons lunges and grabs Xander's throat in the vice-like

grip of his thumb and middle finger.

The fingers are so powerful that Xander is paralysed. He

looks over, sees the bone saw start revving.

Gibbons releases his grip.

Then Xander starts walking away.

The Black Ops guys grab weapons, ready to stop him.

Xander climbs up the steps of the Gulfstream.

INT. GULFSTREAM - DAY

Xander sits with Gibbons in big leather chairs. They are

surrounded by NSA AGENTS in suits.

A NERDY AGENT snaps an ANKLET around Xander's ankle.

INT. EMPTY FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - SUNSET

Orange light floods this beautiful airline lounge. There's a

fully stocked bar, a snack table, all unused. That's because

it's been sealed off for NSA use. (NOTE: perfect product

placement opportunity for an AIRLINE).

Xander, Gibbons and his Men are all silhouetted against the

smoked glass windows.

The Nerdy Agent hands Xander a Palm Pilot sized ELECTRONIC

DEVICE.

Gibbons checks his watch. They get up and start walking.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - SUNSET

The phalanx of Agents surrounds Xander and Gibbons as they

walk to the gate. The Nerdy Agent hurries to catch up.

They walk past the gate, down the jet-way, the Agents FLASH

BADGES to the GATE WORKERS.

Xander is the last one to board the plane.

As the door closes, he looks back at Gibbons and his phalanx

of Agents.

The jet's door CLOSES.

INT. COMMERCIAL JET - NIGHT

Xander is in the last row against the bulkhead. He's got a

personal DVD player and headphones and he's reviewing his

mission. The high-tech screen shows photos, maps, cool

graphics.

The KID sitting across the aisle leans over for a look.

The kid moves to the seat next to Xander.

Onscreen see photos of the FIVE BAD GUYS from the opening

sequence. We DIVE IN to the computer as Xander describes

them.

For each of the baddies, we'll see 3-D PHOTOS and VIDEO CLIPS,

all enhanced with COMPUTER GRAPHICS and POP-UP MENUS.

We see ANDERS, the wild-eyed and unclean Swedish biker,

against a backdrop of MOTORCYCLES and MUSCLE CARS.

We see Viktor, with the goatee and belly, doing some hairy

snowboarding.

We see Kirill in UNIFORM with his well used SNIPER RIFLE.

He indicates Petra, the tough gangster chick. With her LEATHER

and TATTOOS she looks like she could mop up the floor with

Lara Croft.

Finally we see YORGI, the unlikely looking Mafiya Don. We

see CRIME SCENE PHOTOS that illustrate his exploits.

Xander clicks on "INVENTORY". He scrolls through a staggering

array of WEAPONS and VEHICLES.

The Kid's mom calls him back to his seat. Xander looks at

the kid, then gets back to his research.

EXT. PRAGUE - DAY

We CRANE UP from the COBBLESTONE STREET as a BEAT-UP CAR

races by. We rise up, revealing PRAGUE in all it's glory.

INT. BEAT-UP CAR - MOVING

Xander sits in the back, wedged between TWO IDENTICAL LOOKING

TOUGH GUYS. If you were to call Central Casting and ask for

a couple of cold war spy types, this is what they'd send.

They're both 6' 4", have sloppily cut hair, square jaws,

wrinkled overcoats.

The two tough guys flash their COP ID's. Xander studies them.

"IVAN PEDGRAG" and "IVAN PODROV".

He looks out the window, sees a GRAND HOTEL. They drive right

on by.

EXT. DIRTY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

It's a crumbling old dump in a nasty part of town. Xander

shakes his head.

Ivan 1 pulls Xander's gear bag from the trunk and throws it

on the sidewalk.

Xander picks it up and carries it into the building.

INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY

Dumpy furniture, roaches, cracked windows. Xander is ushered

in. There's another GUY in a UGLY SUIT waiting. He is

DETECTIVE MILAN SLOVO.

Ivan 1 shoves him into a chair.

Xander lays down on the bed. Slovo stares, burning with

hatred. He heads to the door.

Slovo exits. Ivans 1 & 2 stay, staring at Xander.

EXT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT

A fancy, flashy disco with an extreme sports theme. A big

bouncer in a leather coat works the door. This is a highclass,

expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous.

Xander and Slovo walk up to the place. Xander's wearing a

Tshirt that says "RON JEREMY: AMERICAN LEGEND" complete with

a photo of the Hedgehog.

INT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT

A STRIPPER that looks like a runway model SLIDES across the

stage on SKATEBOARD KNEE-PADS while PATRONS cheer. The disco

is a combination STRIP-CLUB and CONCERT VENUE. All the

STRIPPERS are outfitted in HELMETS, ELBOW PADS, G-STRINGS

and BELLY SHIRTS.

There's a WARPED TOUR BAND playing on a STAGE. On either

side of the stage are two MINI-HALF PIPES that the GIRLS are

cutting back and forth on.

WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN sit in plush booths getting table dances

while the dance floor is packed with sexily dressed YOUNG

HIPSTERS.

Xander gets a beer from a BUXOM COCKTAIL WAITRESS on IN-LINE

SKATES.

Slovo points them out in the far corner. They're surrounded

by straight faced BODYGUARDS.

What ANARCHY 99 is doing in their booth with the STRIPPERS

looks like Led Zeppelin on tour. Booze, broads, good times...

These guys are living like rock stars.

They're all here: Anders the biker, Viktor, Kirill. In the

middle sit Yorgi and Petra. Petra's wearing an "I AM EVIL"

Tshirt.

He looks around but Xander is gone. He heads for the exit,

pushing his way through the crowd. But then he spots him,

not by the door but deeper in the club.

He sees Xander walk right up to the Anarchy 99 booth and

start talking to them.

Slovo can't hear a thing, but they're obviously interested

in what he has to say. Next thing he knows Xander is pointing

at him and waving him over.

Slovo makes his way through the crowd to the booth. Yorgi

looks him up and down.

Xander grabs Slovo and starts searching him.

He slams Slovo up against the wall and pulls out Slovo's

police badge.

The Bodyguards pull out guns and Slovo rushes for the

emergency exit in a panic. In seconds he's out and gone.

Yorgi waves over some strippers.

Yorgi nods and the Bodyguards step in front of Xander.

Xander turns to leave.

That's when Anders notices the "X" tattoo on the back of

Xander's head. He gets excited and alerts Yorgi.

Xander turns. Suddenly their whole demeanor changes. All

five guys get up, awed, and push the Bodyguards out of the

way.

Yorgi signals for more drinks.

Petra elbows Anders.

Petra glances at Yorgi who nods.

Xander looks to Yorgi.

Petra scrawls numbers on a cocktail napkin.

Xander snatches the napkin.

Petra glares at him.

Yorgi claps and a flock of strippers descends on the booth.

Anarchy 99 lifts their glasses. Xander joins in the toast.

INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MORNING

We see the FEET of AGENT POLK sprinting down the hallway.

INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - MORNING

Agent Polk looks around, spots Gibbons. He rushes to him,

waving a COMMUNIQUE.

Gibbons grabs the communique, reads it. He looks up, stunned.

INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY

Xander is having coffee at his window when his communicator

RINGS.

INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN INFORMATION ROOM

Xander hangs up.

INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - DAY

Gibbons stands before Sam's desk. Sam scans over the

communique.

Gibbons smiles.

EXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY

A HELICOPTER comes flying in, a MAN standing out on the strut.

He's a disgruntled GADGET WRANGLER from the NSA. His name is

TOBY LEE SHAVERS.

Slovo and Xander watch from a distance as a series of METAL

CASES is unloaded by CZECH COPS. Slovo lets out a low whistle.

Shavers walks up to them.

Shavers gives him a disapproving look.

Slovo gestures towards the stairs and Shavers marches off,

muttering to himself.

INT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - BASEMENT TRAINING AREA - DAY

Down in the basement there is a SHOOTING RANGE along one

wall. A squad of CZECH COPS is BLASTING AWAY. They become

distracted by the noise in the middle of the room.

One of the metal boxes has been dropped by a Cop. The rest

are spread out in front of Xander, Slovo and Shavers.

Shavers pops open the first metal case. Inside are various

GADGETS laid into the molded carbon fiber lining.

Shavers holds up a small METAL BALL.

The metal ball unrolls into a six legged ROBOT INSECT.

Xander picks it up.

Shavers snatches it back. He puts on a METAL GLOVE, it's

fingers are SHARP TALONS.

He CLAMPS the claw onto the metal case. It holds fast.

He tosses the glove aside, pulls out a DART GUN.

Shavers displays a case of DARTS.

Xander pulls out some SUPER BINOCULARS.

Xander looks through them, starts cycling through the

different modes.

BINOCULAR P.O.V. - we see the various modes as Xander scans

the grounds.

Xander aims at the shooting range.

BINOCULAR P.O.V. - we see through the clothes of the FEMALE

COPS on the shooting range. (PG-13 style, of course). We can

even see the INNER WORKINGS of their GUNS. One of the Female

Cops turns and gives Xander an approving look.

Shavers pulls out a JUMPSUIT.

Shavers just gives him a deadpan look.

As Shavers drones on, Xander hangs his head.

EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DAY

The TEN BLACK MARKET EUROPEAN SPORTS CARS are loaded on two

TRANSPORT TRUCKS. Mafiya BODYGUARDS keep watch.

The Ivans (in Teamster garb) inspect the cars while Xander

supervises. Anders hovers around him.

Sitting in an OFFICE watching are Yorgi, Kirill and Petra.

Petra has a LAPTOP.

Petra checks her computer. ON SCREEN she's monitoring their

BANK ACCOUNT.

Outside the Ivans nod approval and Xander heads to the office.

Yorgi looks to kirill, who puts his hand on his PISTOL.

Xander opens the door.

Just then Petra's computer BEEPS and the MONEY floods into

their account. Xander holds up a CELL PHONE and smiles.

He nods for Kirill to stand down.

OUTSIDE - the two transport trucks are driven off by the

Ivans. As they pull out they reveal ANOTHER CAR under a COVER.

Anders pulls off the cover, revealing a cherry '72 PONTIAC

GTO.

Xander checks out his new ride. Yorgi gets in the passenger

seat.

Xander sits behind the wheel and STARTS IT UP. The big engine

ROARS.

Next door to the warehouse sits an ABANDONED BUILDING. Up on

the sloped roof, Slovo spies down on the transaction. He's

got a camera with a big zoom lens.

Slovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured. To get

a better vantage, he JUMPS DOWN onto a lower part of the

roof.

CRUNCH! His foot BREAKS THROUGH THE SHABBY ROOF TILE.

Down below, Kirill hears the noise.

They all look to the abandoned building.

Through the second floor window they can see Slovo's leg

poking through the ceiling.

Xander is taken aback.

Yorgi turns to Xander, goes for his pistol.

Thinking fast, Xander does the same.

They draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each other's

heads as they sit in the car. Petra, Kirill and Anders draw

as well, all of them covering Xander.

Yorgi stares, finally believes him. He lowers his gun.

By now Slovo is down the fire escape. He hits the ground and

goes running down the street.

The Anarchy 99 crew heads for their cars. Xander SPINS the

cylinder on his REVOLVER.

The GTO peels out.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Slovo is huffing and puffing as fast as he can when Xander

comes skidding around the corner. He looks back and sees the

speeding GTO.

Xander does the only thing he can. He puts the car sideways

and aims out the window as he slides to a stop.

Slovo turns and BLAM! Xander SHOOTS Slovo right in the chest.

IN SLO-MO: a spray of BLOOD erupts from his chest and Slovo

falls backwards, his face frozen in a look of shock and

betrayal.

The smoking shell clatters to the ground.

Slovo blinks up at Xander, gasping for words, then lays still.

Xander hops out, rifles through Slovo's pockets. The other

Anarchy 99 cars pull up, the whole group looking on.

Xander heads back to the GTO and the cars peel out.

INT. GTO - MOVING - DAY

The rest of Anarchy 99 follows behind the GTO.

He pulls out the roll of FILM. Yorgi laughs.

EXT. DEAD END STREET - DAY

The Ivans pull up in their transport trucks. They see all

the blood and rush towards Slovo. But something doesn't look

right.

Ivan 1 TASTES the blood and spits it out.

Ivan 2 pulls a CHROME DART from Slovo's chest. Slovo GROANS.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

It's a crowded basement rave club. Hot and sweaty RAVERS

dance in provocative outfits. The Anarchy 99 group is standing

on the best booth, right on the packed dance floor.

Surrounding them are a handful of MAFIYA BODYGUARDS who stand

at attention like the Secret Service.

Anders swings from a water pipe and then drops onto the table,

smashing glass.

A DRUNK GUY tries to pull Petra onto the dance floor and she

PUNCHES him. The Bodyguards drag the dude out for a proper

thrashing. Yorgi shatters a BOTTLE against the wall.

Xander shows him a TATTOO on his arm. It shows PLANET EARTH

with a giant SCREW through it.

Yorgi rolls up his sleeve, revealing an Anarchy 99 tat (a

circled "A" with "99" underneath).

Yorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor. The

Xed out ravers swat it around like confetti.

Yorgi melts into the dance floor crowd, leaving Xander alone

with Petra. She gets up grumpily and starts dancing. Xander

joins her, but she won't even look at him.

She reluctantly turns around.

She glares at him and walks away. Xander follows.

There's a big line outside the "ladies" and no line at the

"men's". Petra heads into the Men's Room.

Some DUDE whistles at her. She pushes him out of the way and

enters a stall. Xander leans on the sink.

The stall door flies open and Petra marches out.

She shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall.

Xander walks back out, shaking his head and laughing.

Across the room, Viktor shoves the D.J. out of the way and

puts on "ANARCHY BURGER" by the Vandals. The rave dance is

interrupted by the pounding punk beat.

Viktor and Anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent

mosh pit. Xander can't help it, he actually likes these guys.

Yorgi and Xander head outside. A moment later, Kirill hurries

out another door.

EXT. PRAGUE RIVERFRONT - NIGHT

It's late. Yorgi and Xander stroll along the river.

The camera suddenly ZOOMS across the city, flying over streets

and houses until, half a mile away, it finds Kirill in a

window with his SNIPER RIFLE.

P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is in the crosshairs.

The scope pans over to Yorgi, who looks INTO CAMERA and gives

a small signal, calling off the hit.

BACK ON YORGI AND XANDER

Yorgi looks up at a "PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE" banner.

They stroll off and Kirill stands down.

EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - SUNRISE

A flotilla of VEHICLES (Xander's GTO among them) drives

through the gate in a massive, stone wall. It's a big manor

house in the middle of town.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - PRAGUE - SUNRISE

The GTO, sedans, SUV's park in the courtyard. Xander sees a

row of MOTORCYCLES parked here as well.

Xander also sees a Guard hit a switch that LOWERS the HEAVY

WOODEN GATE.

Yorgi corrals a bunch of STRIPPERS he's brought home.

He leads the whole troop inside.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - SUNRISE

As they go down the hall/Xander sees ROOMS FULL OF OFFICE

WORKERS and MAFIYA GOONS.

Xander takes in WORLD MAPS, FAX MACHINES, BANKS OF COMPUTERS.

For all their screwing around, it's clear Anarchy 99 runs a

large operation.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - SUNRISE

With leaded glass windows overlooking the river, this place

is beautiful. Inside it's done up more like the house from

MTV's "Real World", except trashed. There's cool fish tanks,

a pool table, PS2 on a flatscreen and spray paint and holes

all over the walls.

SERVANTS welcome them with food and Yorgi's SECRETARY gives

him important messages.

Anders starts pounding on a drumset. Petra kicks a soccer

ball at him.

Yorgi paws at a Stripper.

Xander points at one of the Strippers. She's wearing a

fashionable FLAK JACKET.

Petra, show him.

The surly Petra opens a door, revealing a hall of doors.

Xander and Flak Jacket follow.

She just gives him a nasty look, walks into her room and

slams the door. Xander scratches his head and picks a room.

The others shuffle off to their beds with their Strippers.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - XANDER'S ROOM - SUNRISE

Flak Jacket is out of sight in the bathroom. Xander talks to

her while he gets undressed.

He trails off as she steps out of the bathroom. She's wearing

just a G-string and the flak jacket.

She just smiles at him sweetly and pulls his shirt off. She

looks at the ENGAGEMENT RING still pierced through his nipple

and gives a puzzled look.

She kisses him and lets the flak jacket fall (PG-13 style).

He gives in and starts making out with her.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - LATER THAT MORNING

Xander sneaks out of his room and down the hail. Behind him,

we can see Flak Jacket asleep amongst the tussled sheets.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - MORNING

Anders is snoring on the floor. Xander skirrs around him and

goes through another door.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY

Xander finds an office and starts going through the desk. He

finds a PALM PILOT and snaps a RECORDING DEVICE to the bottom.

In seconds he's copied everything on it. He moves on to some

drawers.

He turns, sees Petra standing in the doorway with a GUN.

She shuts the door, advances, staring him down.

She SLAPS him, hard.

She SLAPS him again and Xander goes for her gun. Before he

can pry it from her hand, she's pulled another gun from

nowhere and has it jammed against his neck. He lets go.

INT. YORGI'S BEDROOM - DAY

There are THREE STRIPPERS asleep in bed. Yorgi is sitting at

his COMPUTER in his underwear.

He's hacked in to the CZECH POLICE network.

He looks around a bit, doesn't find what he's looking for.

He sits up, getting pissed.

She heads out. Yorgi goes to the bathroom, splashes water on

his face.

Kirill enters, still half asleep.

Kirill studies the screen while Yorgi pulls on clothes.

Kirill looks back at the screen. Nothing there.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY

Petra still has the gun on Xander.

She pulls back the hammer on her gun.

He makes a move and she jabs the gun at him. She reaches

into the pocket for him and pulls out his little data

recorder.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - DAY

Yorgi creeps down the hall, Kirill in tow. They both screw

SILENCERS onto their PISTOLS.

They flatten themselves up against the wall and prepare to

burst into Xander's room.

One...

Two...

THREE! They kick in the door and aim their guns around.

Flak Jacket sits up, terrified.

Yorgi and Kirill lower their guns. Viktor stumbles by in his

underwear.

INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY

This is a beautiful and historic Prague location with WINDOWS

and a nice view. It's rather fancy and PACKED with UPSCALE

PATRONS. Petra and Xander sit in the middle of the room,

sticking out badly in their grungy clothes.

A WAITER takes their order.

Xander shakes his head.

The Waiter takes off. Petra puffs on a cigarette, staring at

Xander.

She thinks on it. Then her cell phone RINGS.

Kirill hangs up. She looks back at Xander, shell shocked.

She studies his eyes, decides to risk it.

EXT. BAKERY ROOF - DAY

Kirill lays on his stomach, peering into the scope of his

SILENCED SNIPER RIFLE.

crowded restaurant. Xander and Petra are making their way

towards the exit.

INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY

They work their way through the lunchtime crowd.

EXT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY

Xander's timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the

door, a BUS passes by.

Kirill keeps focused, waiting for the bus to pass.

through the bus windows.

Kirill's finger tightens on the trigger...

As soon as the bus passes he FIRES!

But Xander's not there, he's ducked down to tie his shoe.

CRASH! The glass door behind him shatters. Feigning surprise,

Xander PUNCHES PETRA IN THE FACE and sprints down the block.

He runs bent low, the parked cars protecting him from the

sniper. Kirill fires anyway, taking out car windows.

At the end of the block is a long staircase with a METAL

RAIL down the middle.

As he runs by an outdoor restaurant Xander snatches the

SERVING TRAY from a startled WAITER, sending food and drink

flying.

He hops on the serving tray like it's a skateboard and does

a RAIL-SLIDE down the length of the stairs. He's moving too

fast for Kirill.

He jumps off at the bottom and the tray POPS UP INTO THE

AIR.

Kirill BLASTS it like a clay pigeon.

By now Xander is out of sight. Kirill pounds his rifle in

frustration.

Petra gets to the top of the stairs. She gives Kirill a "Where

did he go?" look. Her nose is bloody, helping to sell her

performance.

Then she turns and looks off after Xander. She sees his GTO

speeding away.

EXT. NORWEGIAN FJORDS - LATE AFTERNOON

We're looking down at a SHIP moving through the fjord, seen

from high above. It's towing a SMALLER BOAT behind it. An

airplane? No, we're at the top of the Trollveggen, Norway's

legendary "Troll Wall". It's a near 5,000 foot sheer drop to

the ocean.

Six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff. They wear

webbed "squirrel" jumpsuits, helmets and parachutes. On each

thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced

MP-5 sub-machine guns. Together they stare down at the ship.

Petra is among them. She looks down at her watch. It is

precisely 5:59PM. She glances around. The top of the cliff

is rocky and flat. Xander is nowhere to be seen.

FIFTY YARDS AWAY - we see Xander sneaking forward military

style. He's got his "stakeout suit" on and is keeping low.

HE CHECKS HIS WATCH: "6 PM"

The members of Anarchy 99 put on their goggles and, without

saying a word, they leap off the Troll Wall.

Xander runs to the edge and looks down. He sees the group

freefailing down the sheer cliff face.

The six plummet away from him at incredible speed. In a hard

arch, they peak at 120 m.p.h.

Then, using the webbed wings under their arms and between

their legs, they go into aerodynamic "track" positions and

rocket away from the wall.

Like dark angels, they soar out over the water in formation.

ON THE SHIP BELOW --

The ship below is a scientific research vessel. On the deck,

a few SAILORS and SCIENTISTS watch the sun set.

The six dark figures close in rapidly.

At the last moment they pull their chutes and deftly glide

towards the ship.

A sailor looks up and spots them.

Before he can shout, he's SHOT IN THE LEG and goes down.

Seconds later, they're on the deck, tearing off their rigs.

They race across the deck, taking over the ship in a surgical

manner. They herd everyone back heading for the bridge.

Petra hangs back. She looks back at the cliff, up towards

Xander.

XANDER'S P.O.V.

Through his SUPER BINOCULARS we see them storming the bridge.

As they head inside, they disappear from view.

Xander hits a button on the side of the binoculars.

"PENETRATOR" P.O.V.

Now he can see THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE SHIP.

He sees THE CREW, herded into a room and LOCKED IN by Anarchy

99.

INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

Anarchy 99 seals the door, locking the crew away. They slap

five and bump chests, still totally amped up.

EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

ANGLE ON - a LARGE SUBMERSIBLE VEHICLE. It's white and twelve

feet long. There are MOTORS on either side and a PANEL OF

SOLAR CELLS on the top of a periscope-like projection rising

from the back.

This is the AHAB DEVICE. It sits in the WET WELL at the back

of the ship, ready to be launched out the back sea doors.

There is a SMALLER BOAT moored to the back of the ship.

Kirill and Viktor hop onto it's deck. They start to WHISTLE

as they work. Sounds like the "Andy Griffith" theme.

XANDER'S BINOCULARS P.O.V.

He takes DIGITAL PHOTOS of the Ahab device.

BACK ON THE SHIP

The smaller boat is launched and ready to do. Yorgi goes to

the WET WELL CONTROLS and hits a switch.

The aft doors open, letting water into the wet well. In

seconds Ahab starts to float. Anders loosens it from it's

moorings and they TIE AHAB TO THE BACK OF THE SMALLER BOAT.

Yorgi hits another switch, opening the BALLAST DOORS on the

port side of the ship. Air flows out, causing the ship to

list to one side.

Yorgi MACHINE GUNS the wet well control panel.

They climb onto the boat. Petra is the last to board. She

looks up towards Xander and MACHINE GUNS the panel some more,

making sure he notices.

XANDER'S P.O.V.

He sees the smaller boat pulling away, the Ahab device being

towed behind. He pans over and ZOOMS IN on the shot-up control

panel.

He pans over to the wet well and sees it's flooding.

With the ballast open on only one side, the ship starts

LISTING. The thing is going down.

He pans over, clicks into "penetrator" mode, and sees the

Crew pounding on the walls below decks. They're trapped,

their WRISTS AND ANKLES BOUND WITH PLEXI-CUFFS.

EXT. TOP OF TROLL WALL - LATE AFTERNOON

Xander puts down the binoculars and gets up.

He pats his jumpsuit, checking for the buckle.

Xander steels himself, takes a few deep breaths.

Then he sprints to the edge and JUMPS off the cliff...

And that's it. He's gone. One mile, straight down.

Suddenly we're falling with him.

We hear the rush of air as he free-falls a dozen feet from

the craggy rock face.

The force of the wind ripples his cheeks.

He streamlines himself into a track position and jets away

from the cliff like Superman.

Before he gets too low, he RIPS THE BUCKLE.

Immediately his jumpsuit TEARS OFF HIS BODY in MULTIPLE

LAYERS, unfurling into a full sized PARASAIL.

Xander looks up at his parasail, relieved, and glides towards

the ship.

EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON

Petra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep Yorgi

from spotting it. She grabs him suddenly and KISSES him.

Yorgi kisses her again and heads to the cabin below.

EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

Xander comes in for a perfect landing. He lands on the listing

deck and undoes his harness.

He sees several WOUNDED scattered on the deck.

He looks across the water, sees the smaller boat far away.

EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON

Petra looks back one last time, catching sight of Xander on

the deck of the ship. She smiles, relieved.

Then she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the

price.

EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

Xander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in.

With the ship listing like this, the water is pouring below

decks.

INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

Xander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold. Here

is where the entire Crew has been left to drown. They are

struggling to stay above water, their hands and feet bound.

As the far end of the room is another HATCH. Water pours in

from this one and Xander has to get it shut.

He swims through the struggling Crew, spots the CAPTAIN

holding his YOUNG SON above water. The water is rising

rapidly, filling up the compartment.

Xander braces his feet against the bulkhead and PUSHES, but

the force of the water is too much.

He surfaces. He's got to wait until the room floods before

he can close that door.

He watches as the Crew goes into a panic, the water rising

up to the ceiling. They are gasping in the last foot of air

that's available. He sees the Captain's Son, crying and

clutching at his father.

Xander takes a deep breath and dives down. He grabs the hatch

door, braces his feet and PULLS.

His muscles strain as the heavy metal door slowly swings

SHUT.

Xander surfaces and swims to the ladder. He CUTS the Captain's

plastic cuffs.

The Captain takes the knife and swims to free his men.

Xander takes the Captain's Son and climbs up the ladder.

EXT. SHIP'S BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON

Xander scans the controls but has no idea what he's looking

for. The Captain's Son shows him the right switch.

The Son nods and Xander flips the switch. MOTORS start to

HUM.

EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

The bilge pumps spew out water furiously. Crew members come

up from below decks. They are soaked and grateful. They go

about tending to the wounded as Xander slumps down next to

the exhausted Captain.

They both laugh, relieved, as the ship slowly rights itself.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Xander is in a room with the SCIENTISTS from the ship. They

have blueprints of the torpedo spread out. The Captain's Son

is wrapped in BLANKETS, shivering.

Xander is talking to Gibbons on his communicator.

INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN THE ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM

Gibbons jots down the information furiously.

Xander tussles the hair of the Captain's Son.

EXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - DAY

The GTO screeches into the lot. Shavers is on his way out

with his SUITCASE.

INT. POLICE BUILDING BASEMENT - DAY

PAN OVER WEAPONS - they're all laid out on the floor. 50

cal. MACHINE GUNS, MINES, ROCKETS, BELTS OF AMMO.

We finally arrive at Xander leaning on his GTO. He sparks a

BLOWTORCH and lights a CIGAR.

Shavers looks on in shock. He's got a crew of MECHANICS with

him. Xander hands him the blowtorch and walks away.

EXT. PRAGUE OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY

This is a beautiful open air market in a town square

surrounded by old buildings. The place is PACKED.

In the midst of it all, we make out Petra moving through the

crowd. She stops to look at some vegetables when Xander passes

by her.

They keep talking, pretending to shop.

This stings her. She knows well the price she paid.

Then she's off into the crowd.

EXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - NIGHT

The craggy surface of the wall is swathed in shadows. Xander

approaches and flattens himself against it. He's all in BLACK,

packed with weapons and sporting a COMBAT VEST.

He grabs a toehold on the wall and ZOOM! He SPEED CLIMBS up

the side.

He reaches the top in seconds and scopes out the manor house.

VIDEO CAMERAS, PATROLLING GUARDS. It's not gonna be easy.

Xander slips over the wall down to the courtyard below.

EXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Xander places an EXPLOSIVE on a CONTROL BOX.

He waits for a GUARD to stroll by and then slips through a

basement window.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - DARKENED ROOMS - NIGHT

Xander makes his way through a series of rooms. Finally he

finds himself in a study with a window overlooking the

CAVERNOUS BASEMENT of the Manor.

Laid out below he can see the AHAB DEVICE, hanging from

chains. TECHIES are working with the Anarchy 99 crew to

RETROFIT the thing.

They are installing a LAUNCHER RACK of TEN TUBES.

Xander can't hear a thing through the thick glass.

He takes a METAL BALL from his pocket. There's a sink in the

corner and he drops the metal ball down the drain.

INT. DRAIN PIPE

We follow the metal ball as it rolls through the trap and

down into the wall. The pipe zigzags around like a

rollercoaster and then levels off.

The ball rolls past a T-intersection, stops, and unrolls

like a pill bug.

Six metal legs appear and we see it's the ROACH CAM. It

scuttles back up the pipe and makes the turn.

INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

We're close on a sink as the Roach Cam comes up the pipe. It

scurries into hiding just as a HAND reaches in to turn on

the water.

The roach peers out from between items on a workbench and we

PUSH IN on it's VIDEO CAMERA head.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

CLOSE ON - VIDEO MONITOR - ROACH CAM P.O.V.

We see a handheld video image of Viktor.

Viktor pushes a button on Ahab and a VODKA BOTTLE launches

from tube one, SHATTERING against the ceiling.

Pull back to reveal Xander watching the image on his

communicator. Using a joystick he's able to control the roach.

He steers the camera towards Petra, gets a low-angle shot of

her legs in a punked-out CATHOLIC SCHOOL GIRL SKIRT.

He smiles, enjoying himself.

He plugs his earpiece in and listens in.

INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Petra works on a COMPUTER CONTROLLER.

The roach scurries across the floor, circling to get a better

look at Ahab.

Anders pushes a CART holding TEN GLASS CANISTERS OF LIQUID.

Each canister is separated in two, with a BLACK LIQUID on

top and a WHITE LIQUID on the bottom.

He hands the canisters to Viktor one by one.

Viktor laughs and joins in.

Then Kirill looks down and SPOTS THE ROACH CAM.

He STOMPS it with his boot.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

Xander jerks out his earpiece and rubs his ear.

He looks down into the room, sees Kirill bending down to

examine the roach. Time to go.

INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Kirill lifts the dead "roach" and sees its wires.

Yorgi hits an ALARM switch, alerting the guards.

The Anarchy boys grab weapons and start racing through the

house.

INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - VARIOUS - NIGHT

The Anarchy boys move swiftly from room to room in practiced

close combat maneuvers.

Cueing each other with hand signals, they run through each

room, weapons ready.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Xander sprints down the hallway. With the Anarchy 99 boys

and Guards roaming the house, he's having a hard time finding

his way out.

INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

He runs into a darkened dining hall, sprints across only to

find the opposite door locked. He hides behind one of the

many COLUMNS as his pursuers enter the room.

Kirill gives a thumbs up and puts on a pair of NIGHT VISION

GOGGLES. He scans the big room but sees nothing.

Xander, hidden at the opposite end, waits breathlessly.

Kirill advances slowly, his buddies covering him from the

door.

Across the room, Xander sees a small window leading to the

courtyard. He has to run across open ground to reach it. He

calls out to Yorgi.

Xander's voice echoes around the empty hall, making it

impossible to pinpoint.

He pulls out his gun as Kirill creeps ever closer.

Against the far wall Xander spots a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

Kirill is almost on top of him.

Xander sights up and FIRES.

The fire extinguisher EXPLODES, blinding Kirill.

Xander makes a run for it.

Everyone FIRES WILDLY (except for Petra), bullets tearing

tapestries off the walls.

Xander dives and crashes through the window.

EXT. COURTYARD - SUNRISE

Xander tuck and rolls, comes up running.

Guards are running around, unsure just what the hell is going

on.

Xander hops on one of the TRIALS MOTORCYCLES parked nearby

and fires up the engine. He hits a remote switch and BLAM!

The EXPLOSIVE CHARGE he left earlier blows-up.

He points the bike at a set of STONE STAIRS. They form a

"ramp" that he can use to JUMP THE WALL. He GUNS THE ENGINE.

A Guard races across the wall with a rifle, taking aim.

Xander races and JUMPS THE BIKE over the wail. As he goes by

he does a CAN-CAN AERIAL, KICKING THE GUARD OFF THE WALL

before he can shoot.

The Anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go.

Anders fires up the other trials bike, slings a submachine

gun across his back and goes up and over. Petra watches him

go, hoping for the best.

EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAYBREAK

(NOTE: action will be re-choreographed based on actual

locations. Any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated

by a physical reason)

Xander blazes down the street, Anders racing right behind

him. A wrong turn sends him into a dead end.

At the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall.

Xander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of

the truck and onto it's roof. Balancing on the rear wheel,

he hops onto the wall.

The machine gun blasts again. Xander drives off along the

top of the wall. Anders shoulders his gun and follows.

They are riding a 15' high wall that's only a foot wide.

They make several 90 degree turns, racing above a sleeping

neighborhood. Xander sees the end of the wall ahead and takes

a detour.

He hops onto the second floor balcony of a BUILDING UNDER

CONSTRUCTION.

INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MORNING

CONSTRUCTION WORKERS bolt out of the way as the motorcycle

leaps into their building.

Xander pops a wheelie and slams through a BLUEPRINT TABLE.

Anders follows, demolishing their SNACK TABLE.

Xander darts through the building, between beams and 2 x

4's, until he reaches a skeletal STAIRCASE.

More WORKERS appear at the bottom of the stairs so Xander

goes up. He cranks up three flights of stairs and bashes

onto the roof.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MORNING

Xander looks around for a way out. The next building isn't

that far away. He revs up and JUMPS ACROSS.

Anders jams another magazine into his sub-machine gun and

follows Xander.

They jump from roof to roof, down a DESCENDING SERIES OF

ROOFTOPS towards the river. Anders pulls up alongside as

they race towards that last apartment building.

Neck and neck they head for the brink. At the last jump,

Xander pulls up behind Anders.

They hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel. Anders clamps

on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop, Xander right

behind him.

They skid to a stop at the very edge, with Anders balanced

on his front wheel. He looks down, sees street five stories

below.

He glances back at Xander, sweat beading, struggling to keep

his balance. Xander observes him coolly, totally in control.

Anders reaches for his machine gun. Xander pops a wheelie

and RAMS Anders over the edge.

The bike tumbles and PANCAKES into the pavement. Anders tears

through several AWNINGS before slamming into the ground.

Xander turns and rides to the next apartment building.

He hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually

take him to street level.

As he makes his way down, Anders stirs. The guy is a bloody,

broken mess but he gets to his feet. He sees where Xander is

headed and he scurries off to intercept him.

EXT. ALLEY - MORNING

Xander is heading to the far end of a dead end alley. The

only way out is fenced in. But there's a RAMP leading up to

a LOADING DOCK. Xander will have to use that ramp to jump

the fence.

Anders climbs to the second floor of the building. There is

a small crane arm loaded with metal. If he pushes it at the

right time, it will swing out and knock Xander from his bike.

He giggles maniacally, blood dripping.

Xander drops down into the alley and heads towards the jump.

Anders times it perfectly and swings the crane arm out.

IN SLOW MOTION: The bike leaves the ramp and soars up over

the fence.

The crane arm swings out, on a collision course with Xander.

Xander sees it and THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE BIKE, grabbing

onto the back in a SUPERMAN SEAT-GRAB. He passes RIGHT

UNDERNEATH the swinging crane arm.

Anders's face falls when he sees Xander go by, hanging on

with ONE HAND. In his OTHER HAND Xander's got his PISTOL.

BLAP!

Xander pulls himself back onto the bike and lands. He stops,

sees Anders' BLOODY HELMET come bouncing into the alley. He

tucks his pistol away and roars off.

INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY

Xander comes up the stairs and sees LIGHTS ON in his

apartment. He draws his gun and pushes the door open.

Slovo is sitting in the armchair.

Xander holsters his gun, searches around for his communicator.

Xander turns to see Slovo waving the communicator.

Slovo raises his pistol.

Xander does so.

Suddenly GUNFIRE blasts through the closed door.

Bullets shatter a LAMP, a PICTURE, and finally tag Slovo in

a wild salvo.

Slovo crumples, never knowing what hit him.

The door creaks open. It's Petra, her gun still smoking.

She's with the Ivans.

The Ivans go to Slovo's body, kicking the gun from his hands.

One of them SPITS on his corpse in disgust.

She drags him to the door.

EXT. ST. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY

The beautiful and historic St. Charles bridge spans the river.

There are BANNERS hanging in celebration of the coming PRAGUE

PEACE CONFERENCE. Petra leads Xander across it.

Xander grabs her by shoulders.

He's gotten through to her. She nods in agreement.

Xander kisses her.

Together they walk back across the bridge. We crane up,

revealing the PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE banners all over a big

BUILDING on the river.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

We see a craggy, gnarly mountain. The front side is a rock

strewn, near vertical drop.

Then we see Xander come scaling up from the back side. He's

got GEAR strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a

helluva climb.

Xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath. It's

beautiful up here.

He pulls a COLLAPSIBLE SNOWBOARD off his back, hits a switch

and the thing SWITCHBLADES OUT to full size. He clamps it on

his feet.

Xander moves to the edge and peers down. At the bottom of

the mountain he can see the CASTLE, an imposing medieval

fortress in the snow. He leans over the edge and starts down

the mountain. He doesn't get far before he notices something

else. He slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging

to rocks for balance.

On the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a

GUARD OUTPOST. Right now he's in full view and he's been

spotted. He sees GUARDS scrambling out, hopping on

SNOWMOBILES. From up here they look like ants.

EXT. GUARD OUTPOST - DAY

Viktor, the goateed cold weather warrior, strides out of the

Outpost and looks up the mountain. He shouts orders to his

men.

A Guard runs up and brings him his weapon: A FLAME-THROWER.

Viktor straps it on and. climbs onto his SNOWMOBILE.

All around him the Guards are driving into position. They

form a gauntlet of AK-47's. There must be a DOZEN of them.

Viktor rides up twenty yards and waits, his engine idling.

He squints up at the speck that is Xander.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

Xander pulls a CONCUSSION GRENADE from his jacket.

He puts his goggles on and pulls the pin from the grenade.

Then he TOSSES IT OVER HIS SHOULDER.

The grenade lands in the snow above him and starts ROLLING

DOWNHILL TOWARDS HIM. Xander pushes off and starts bombing

down the mountain.

The grenade bounces after him and then WHAM! It goes up with

a tremendous shock.

There is a SHIFT in the snow, a GROAN of shifting weight,

then the ENTIRE CORNICE cracks loose and topples over the

brink.

Xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at

his heels.

From down below it's an awesome sight. The slack-jawed Guards

watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them.

Shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer, they

can see Xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face.

There's a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles and

ride for their lives. A furious Viktor spins around and makes

a run for it as well.

Nobody has a chance. The avalanche is coming like a freight

train, frothing like white water.

Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hits a

JUMP. He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof

of the Outpost.

The avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everything

and everyone in its way.

Guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbling

under the onslaught.

Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over

the Outpost. He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a

stop.

Then it's all quiet.

Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble. There's

nothing moving up there anymore. Xander pulls himself free.

Then he hears a gushing sound and a DEEP BENEATH THE SURFACE,

he sees the WARM ORANGE GLOW OF FLAME. It's Viktor and his

flame thrower. There's another SPURT and the glow fades for

good.

Xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath. He's

right above the Castle now. Then his communicator starts to

BEEP.

INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS ON THE PRIVATE JET WITH A TEAM OF

AGENTS.

Xander looks down on the Castle. There seem to be MAFIYA

HENCHMEN all over the grounds.

Xander hangs up and heads down the hill.

EXT. CASTLE - DAY

A GUARD patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle. He

stops for a smoke when Xander walks right up to him.

WHACK! With two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps

walking. He's a man on a mission.

He runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall. There's

no hand-holds, it's, a perfectly flat climb. A canyon of

ROCKS is below.

Xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the "TERMINATOR"

CLIMBING CLAWS. He pulls on the metal gloves and CLAWS into

the solid rock.

Just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface.

We see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making

this impossible climb.

At the top is an overhang. It's a gnarly transition. As he's

rounding it, his FEET SLIP. His legs dangle over the rocky

chasm below.

Using all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the

way with his climbing claws.

At the top a GUARD leans over, aiming his gun at him. Xander

grabs him and pulls him over the edge.

The Guard FALLS into the chasm.

Xander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted. Then another GUARD

rushes him, grabbing for his rifle.

Xander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun

from his hands. With the other hand he SLASHES, taking the

Guard down.

He pulls off the claws and heads into the Guard Tower.

INT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

Xander exits the Guard Tower at the ground level.

As he crosses the courtyard an EXPLOSION rocks the tower he

just left.

There is shouting as GUARDS race around the parapets, unsure

where the attack is coming from. A GUARD runs up to Xander.

Xander CLOTHESLINES him and catches his AK-47 as he drops.

Up inside the castle he can see Yorgi at a window. Yorgi

appears mildly shocked as they make EYE CONTACT.

Xander takes aim.

POV ON XANDER THRU SNIPER SCOPE

From up above, Kirill has Xander in his sights.

BLAW! The bullet hits Xander's AK, sending it spinning.

Xander rubs his sore hand but stays put. Kirill could have

killed him and he knows it. From a doorway comes Yorgi with

some Guards.

Yorgi walks up and SMASHES Xander in the face.

Yorgi punches him again.

INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

Petra sits at a desk working on a LAPTOP. Yorgi enters with

Xander and Kirill.

Petra looks up. She can barely hide her shock.

Kirill aims his gun at Petra.

Yorgi SLAPS her.

Petra is devastated by this revelation.

He runs this fingers through her hair and moves on to Xander.

Yorgi's eye twitches.

He raises his gun and suddenly BOOOOOM! A massive explosion

rocks the whole castle. Shrapnel shatters the windows,

spraying glass, and Yorgi's shot goes wide.

EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

The front gates have just been blown apart. Through the smoke

and wreckage come Ivans 1 & 2 with a PLATOON OF CRACK CZECH

SECRET POLICE. Their submachine guns rattle in threeshot

bursts, sweeping Guards from the parapets.

INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

Kirill looks down at the carnage below. Xander takes advantage

of the distraction and charges at Yorgi.

Yorgi goes to shoot but his hand won't work. There's a HUGE

SHARD OF GLASS sticking through his forearm.

By the time he pulls it out, Xander is on top of him. He

body checks Yorgi, sending him flying over a desk. Kirill

spins and starts FIRING. Xander ducks for cover.

EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

The Czech Secret Police are having their way. They cross the

courtyard and burst into the main building.

INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

The Police whip through the building like lightening, mowing

down everyone in their path.

One Czech Secret Policeman is wounded and the others retaliate

with a volley of RPG's that evaporates a pocket of resistance.

In the main room upstairs, Kirill is blasting away. Yorgi

starts rounding up the computer gear.

Before Kirill can do so, Cops burst into the room, spraying

bullets everywhere.

Xander and Petra are pinned down, but Yorgi and Kirill manage

to make a fast exit out another door.

The Cops keep shooting.

EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

Ivan 1 is talking on the radio when Yorgi appears behind him

and shoots him in the back.

They step over him and enter a GARAGE.

INT. CASTLE - GARAGE - DAY

The Ahab device is in the back of a flatbed TRUCK. Yorgi and

Kirill start up the truck and jam it into gear.

EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

The truck smashes through the garage doors and rumbles across

the courtyard.

Police open fire, but the truck tears out the gate and starts

heading down the mountain.

INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

Meanwhile, Xander and Petra are still pinned down.

Petra starts calling out in RUSSIAN. Finally the cops stop

shooting.

EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

Xander and Petra are brought outside. They see the Police

working on the wounded Ivan 1. Ivan 2 walks up.

EXT. CASTLE - DAY

A big truck pulls to a stop. Its ramp lowers and Xander's

blown-out '72 GTO comes rolling out.

Xander and Petra both strap on grenades and pistols.

They both climb in and the GTO peels out.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

Xander drives all out, trying hard to catch up.

He passes several of Ivan's Police Jeeps at a furious clip.

Up ahead they see the truck winding it's way down the

mountain.

Xander floors it.

Up ahead, in the flatbed truck, Yorgi drives. He can see the

GTO gaining on them.

Kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab. He

lays down, resting the rifle on the Ahab container.

As the GTO comes into view, he sights up and FIRES, WHACK!

The first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows

the headrest off Xander's seat.

He pulls out an Mp-5 out and hangs it out the window.

Another shot blasts through, taking off the rear-view mirror.

Kirill laughs and takes aim once again. He puts Petra in the

sights.

Xander jerks the steering wheel and BLAM! the shot goes wide.

The GTO veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain.

Xander fights for control as they slide around the turns.

The road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex

up ahead. They cut across a field, heading right for it.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY

The truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex.

Quickly the gates are closed again. Armed GUARDS can be seen

up above.

The GTO comes at the gates at full speed.

Xander opens a DASH PANEL, revealing a ROW OF SWITCHES. He

flips one.

The HEADLIGHTS EJECT, revealing a MINI-GUN IN EACH FENDER.

BRRRAAAAAAPPP!! The mini-guns spin.

The metal doors are getting SHREDDED.

Empty SHELLS spill down the sides of the GTO.

The metal doors come apart, falling in chunks.

The GTO slams through the wreckage without slowing down.

A Guard comes tumbling down and BOUNCES off the trunk as the

GTO zips inside.

EXT. INSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY

The Anarchy 99 guys seem to have a whole other army in here.

Guards spill onto the road, shooting at them from everywhere.

A BELLY PANEL on the GTO opens and ping-pong ball sized

MINIBOMBS dump onto the road. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The bombs

send the Guards scattering.

The GTO sizzles away.

A tactical (a pick-up with a .50 cal machine gun attached)

pulls up behind them and opens fire.

Petra punches another button.

The REAR HUBCAPS pop off. They roll along the road on their

own. Inside they seem to be LINED WITH SPIKES.

As the Tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they BLOW

UP, SPRAYING SPIKES at both sides of the Tactical.

All four wheels BLOW OUT and the Tactical goes out of control.

It crashes through a fence and pitches into the water, the

men going sprawling.

At the riverbank Yorgi and Kirill pull Ahab off the truck

and prepare for launching.

They remove it from it's box and carry it waist deep into

the water. Yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on Ahab's

insides.

Kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off.

He climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building

on a WHARF. From here he can shoot and NOT BE SEEN. He takes

his LIT CIGARETTE and tucks it behind his ear.

When the GTO rounds the corner he FIRES.

The bullet goes through the window and SLAMS into the steering

column.

Xander jams it into reverse. They retreat behind a building.

Petra clutches her arm, wounded.

Kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make

their second approach. The GTO comes roaring out, spinning

in circles wildly. Xander's is just doing donuts as fast as

he can.

Kirill aims, but with all the dust being kicked up he doesn't

have much of a target.

He doesn't notice Petra pop up from behind a fence with a

HEAT SEEKING MISSILE LAUNCHER.

ANGLE ON - the missile launcher's COMPUTER SCREEN. The green

display shows a faint red glow in the upstairs window. Its

the GLOWING POINT of Kirill's lit cigarette.

The Launcher BEEPS as it locks in and she FIRES.

Kirill looks up to see the missile blazing down the wharf at

him.

He gets it immediately. In a panic he fumbles for the

cigarette...

Too late. The missile zeroes in on his head.

WHOOOSH! The entire wooden shack blows apart.

Xander walks up to Petra.

ANGLE ON - Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and let's it go. The

electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the river.

Xander and Petra run to the water's edge in time to see Yorgi

escaping in a MOTORBOAT. In the opposite direction they see

the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards it's destination.

Petra finds the CONTROLLER in the cab of the truck. She

presses buttons desperately.

Xander starts running towards a second moored MOTORBOAT.

EXT. THE RIVER - DAY

Yorgi is motoring away, smiling, when he glances back and

sees Xander and Petra take off after Ahab. He pounds on his

steering wheel and turns around. His bigger boat closes on

them and he reloads his weapons.

Xander drives while Petra checks her controller.

They're heading into downtown Prague now, the riverbank

getting more and more populated. Yorgi is closing fast.

Down below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab beneath

the water.

Petra pulls the pin on a grenade. She tosses it out in front

of Ahab. WHOOMPH! A jet of water goes up, but too far behind.

She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's

boat pulls up alongside. Yorgi aims and FIRES and the bullet

GRAZES Petra's arm.

She loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the

engine compartment.

Xander grabs Petra and jumps. Together they land in Yorgi's

boat. The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge

support and shatters.

They are in the heart of the old city now. We see piazza's

full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing

in front of cathedrals. And on the river Yorgi and

Xander battle it out while Petra steers the boat.

Xander glances down, sees Ahab nearing the surface. Yorgi

clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat. Petra

tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm.

Xander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs

him from behind in a chokehold.

Xander elbow's Yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold. He flips

him and they both topple overboard.

They land on Ahab and both grab on. They punch and pummel

each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding

torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St.

Charles bridge.

On the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF

PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from

the river.

Xander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi

slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in

the torpedo's wake.

Ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open.

Inside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing

Silent Night. The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION.

He pries the first rocket off it's launcher. The thing is

BEEPING menacingly.

IN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his

hands. He looks over at Petra. She's shouting at him, but he

doesn't hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT.

He looks the other direction, to the mass of PEOPLE on the

bridge above him. Total strangers...

The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former

nihilist.

Through the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with

his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact.

Then Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the

water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab

starts to DIVE.

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

With Yorgi hanging on his back, Xander turns the rocket upside

down and stuffs it BACK IN THE LAUNCHER.

Ahab heads down to the bottom of the river, the two men

fighting.

We see one man get THROWN FREE, the other is caught up on

Ahab and continues downstream.

Then the booster rocket FIRES, giving off SPARKS and BUBBLES.

It's all in silhouette now as WHAM! The rocket EXPLODES,

setting off a CHAIN REACTION. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ahab and

it's unfortunate passenger are DISINTEGRATED by the BLASTS.

The chemicals BELCH OUT in harmless clouds.

EXT. THE RIVER - DAY

A FUNNEL OF WATER blasts into the sky. The crowd recoils.

EXT. THE RIVERBANK - DAY

Ivan 2 helps Petra off the motorboat. They look down at the

water, but there's no sign of Xander.

Gibbons and his men push through the cordon of POLICE,

scanning the water. Nothing.

Tears well in Petra's eyes. Even Gibbons looks dejected.

Then Petra let's out a gasp and they look downstream.

There's a boat ramp leading into the water. At first they

see a ripple, then the top of a SHAVED HEAD emerges.

The whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water,

walking up the boat ramp.

His shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered. But there's

a look on his face, a calm, a self-confidence we haven't

seen before. The Phoenix has risen.

Petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him. Xander

shakes Ivan 2's hand and then turns to Gibbons.

He starts walking off with Petra.

Gibbons waves.

Xander and Petra move off through the crowd arm in arm.

ANGLE ON - a big "X" spelled out in SEASHELLS on the sand.

The camera shoots up into the sky, showing a perfect white

beach, a perfect lagoon, a lush green island... BORA BORA...

Then we hear the BUZZING of a TATTOO NEEDLE.

A THIRD "X" BEING TATTOOED ON THE BACK OF XANDER'S HEAD.

INT. HUT - DAY

His ink done, Xander walks out onto the back deck.

EXT. BORA BORA - DAY

Craggy mountain peaks and perfect turquoise blue water.

Xander steps out of a hut built over the water.

We see Petra sprawled out on the deck in a bikini. She's got

a bucket of HINANO BEER chilling down. It's a vision of

heaven.

He lays down next to her, starts pulling her bikini bottom

off.

FROM UNDERWATER - we see the two of them dive into the lagoon

nude. There's too many bubbles to see any real skin, but we

know what they're up to.

Back on the surface we see BUBBLES rising and catch glimpses

of their outlines beneath the water.

The Camera pulls back to the deck, where we see Xander's

COMMUNICATOR on the table next to the beers. We hear them

surface and start SPLASHING off camera.

Then the damn communicator starts to BEEP.

FADE OUT.
