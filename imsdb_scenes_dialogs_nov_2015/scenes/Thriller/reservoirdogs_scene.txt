October 22, 1990

This movie is dedicated to these following sources of

inspiration:

Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a

breakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,

MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,

and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and

are enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a

small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and

involved story about Madonna.

The fellas crack up.

Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.  They

fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

The table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table.

She has the check, and a pot of coffee.

She hands the bill to him.

They all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.

Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White

acts shot.  Joe exits.

Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.

Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.

Everybody laughs.

They all laugh.

They all laugh.

Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.

They all laugh.

Everybody laughs.  Joe's comes back to the table.

The eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White's waist is in

the F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's

carrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,

talking amongst themselves.

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

When the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK:

Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in

agony.

Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING

ASS, through traffic.

Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY

ELSE SAY:

Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:

The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the

backseat.  He's been SHOT in the stomach.  BLOOD covers

both him and the backseat.

Mr. White is the Somebody Else.  He's behind the wheel of

the getaway car.  He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and

out of traffic.  Though he's driving for his life, he

keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

They are the only two in the car.

Mr. Orange doesn't respond.  Mr. White starts pounding on

the steering wheel.

The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse.  Then the

door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of

Mr. Orange inside.

Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl

around the warehouse.

Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.

Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.

Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.

Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He's

still holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his

friend.

Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from

his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.

Pink steps inside.

Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We

move past it, and see down a hall.

At the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door

is partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is

obscured, but Mr. White is in view.

We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on

his face.

Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and

OUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards

us, bent over the sink.  Then he grabs a towels, and dries

his face.  Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of

Chesterfields in his hand.

The two men light up.

Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk.  He has

a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357

MAGNUM in the other.  If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he

just knocks them down.  We DOLLY at the same speed, right

along side of him.

FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.  We DOLLY with

them.

We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates.  ROLLERGIRL

is plugged into a walkman.  We hear the song she's

listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK.  She's twirling and

skating backwards to the beat of the song.

Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink.  The

man and woman CRASH to the ground.

Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car

that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over

him.

The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the

car's driver.  Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,

shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.

The Shocked Woman starts screaming.

Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's

locked.

EXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.

DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.

Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.

The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.

Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at

the Cops.

Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.

Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.

Cops FIRE.

CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it.  SPEEDING down

the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.

Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.

Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White's

expression changes.

They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious.  The

CAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him

first.

Mr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse

on Mr. Orange's neck.

Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a

C.U. of Mr. White.

MR. WHITE'S POV:

C.U. OF MR. PINK.

There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,

then he SCREAMS:

Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.

Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.

White.  Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.

Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.

Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in

the mouth.

END OF POV

Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and

realistic fight.  They go at each other like a couple of

alley cats.

As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:

Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:

The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.

Mr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.

Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it

out.

Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,

and goes for his own weapon.

The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their

guns outstretched, aiming at one another.

Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.

Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:

The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.

Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke

and eating a hot dog.

Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter

and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the

place out.

He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he

just eats his hot dog and sips his coke.

This is making Pink and White nervous as hell.  But Mr.

Pink tries to talk through it.

We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.

Mr. Blonde walks the loft.  Silent.

Silence.

Blonde looks in the bathroom.

Blonde looks out the window.

Blonde walks away from the window.

Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.

Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves

towards them.

Silence takes over the room.  Mr. Blonde stops moving.

After a few beats the silence is broken.

Mr. White turns to leave.

Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards

Mr. Blonde.

Mr. Blonde calmly sits down.  He looks to Mr. Pink.

Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.

Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,

talking about Madonna.

Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.

The other two men just follow him with their eyes.

Mr. Blonde walks out.

Three cars are parked out front.  Mr. Blonde is walking

towards the car he drove.  Mr. White and Mr. Pink are

walking behind.  The Camera is HANDHELD following behind

them.

Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car.  A handcuffed,

uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.

INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. BLONDE".

We're inside the office of Joe Cabot.  Joe's on the phone,

sitting behind his desk.

There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.

One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps

inside.  Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks

towards the man.

Teddy leaves.

He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the

front of the desk.

Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks

in.

Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr.

Blonde.  Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies

style jacket.

Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.

The two men embrace each other.  Teddy leaves, closing the

door behind him.

Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet.  Vic sits in a chair

set in front of Joe's desk.

Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair.

Vic swallows some Remy.

There's a KNOCK at the door.

The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie.

Vic turns around in his seat and sees him.

Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

Eddie bobs his head up and down.

Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other,

wrestle on the floor of Joe's office.

Joe's on his feet yelling at them.

The two men break it up.  They are completely disheveled,

hair a mess, shirttails out.  As they get themselves

together, they continue to taunt one another.

Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it.  So they both

take seats in front of Joe's desk.

Joe looks at Vic.

Vic has no idea what they're talking about.

Toothpick Vic smiles.

So does Nice Guy Eddie.

Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his

portable car phone.  The sounds of the seventies are

coming out of his car radio in the form of "Love Goes

Where My Rosemary Goes" by Edison Lighthouse.

FLASH ON

The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed

behind his back.  Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde

surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him.

"Love Grows .." PLAYS over the soundtrack.

FLASH ON

The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.

Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside

the warehouse.

Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse.  He gets out of

the car, looks at the other cars parked outside.

Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open,

and steps inside the warehouse.

The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still

WAILING on him.

Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.

Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.

Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.

DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.

Meaning Mr. Blonde.

Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.

Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the

store.

Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse

talking amongst themselves.

Mr. Blonde closes the door after them.  He then slowly

turns his head towards the cop.

C.U. COP'S FACE.

He SLAPS the cop's face.

He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.

COP'S POV

Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.

He turns on the radio.

Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS

over the speaker.

NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.

Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop.

He opens a large knife.

He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits

in it.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding

the knife, singing along with the song.

Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.

A SLASH across the face.

The cop/camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing

along with the seventies hit.

Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's/our ear.

The cop/camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see.

Mr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out

of the way.

We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse...

...to his car.  He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can

of gasoline.

He walks back inside the warehouse...

...carrying the can of gas.

Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's

BEGGING him not to do this.

Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.

Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:

He moves the match up to the cop...

...When a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.

The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the

bloody Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.

We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET

HITS and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.

Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.

Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody

trail behind him.

When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.

The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and

the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.

Jeffrey starts to weep.

INSERT: TITLE CARD  "MR. ORANGE & MR. WHITE"

A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a

Malcom X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star

on it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny

bacon, cheese and avocado burger.  He sits in a booth all

alone.  He's waiting for somebody.  As he waits, he

practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his

french fries, not by mistake either--that's just how he

likes it.

We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing

a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop,

spot Holdaway, and head his way.  Holdaway sees Freddy bop

towards him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered

across his face.

CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway.

We fear Freddy OFF SCREEN.

LOW ANGLE

looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table.

CU ON HOLDAWAY

Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then

smiles.

We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide

into the booth across from Holdaway.  Freddy's doing a lot

of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.

FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY

We are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to

Freddy.  We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.

The freeze frame ENDS.  Holdaway comes suddenly up to

speed and says:

From here to end we cut back and forth.

Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.

Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now.  He

motions for Freddy to elaborate.

CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU.

Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous.

Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt.  Freddy

sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket,

looking at pieces of paper stapled together.

Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,

rehearsing the anecdote.  He's reading it pretty good, but

he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a

while he stumbles over his words.

Freddy exits frame

Another empty frame, except obviously outside.  Freddy

enters frame from the same direction he exited in the

previous scene, finishing his sentence.  When we move to a

wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to

Holdaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of

his beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he

performs his story.

Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a

table in a red-lighted smokey bar.  Freddy continues his

story.  The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.

MEDIUM ON FREDDY

He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his

shoulder.  Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks.  We

move into a CU.

FREEZE FRAME

on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County

Sheriffs and one German Shepherd.  All of their eyes are

on Freddy.  Everyone is frozen.

hear the dog barking.

SLOW MOTION

FREEZE FRAME

Back to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in

front of the sheriffs.  It suddenly jerks to life, and

moves to speed.  The dog is barking.  Freddy moves to his

right, out of frame.  We stay on the sheriffs.  One

sheriff yells at the dog.

The dog quiets down.  Sheriff #2 continues with his story.

A couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen,

but as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.

The CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up

against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.

Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past

the sheriffs over to the sink.  The CAMERA PANS with him.

A sheriff is sitting on a sink.  He looks down and watches

Freddy wash his hands.

Freddy finishes washing his hands.  He goes to dry them,

but there's only those hand drying machines.  Freddy turns

on the drying machine.  He can't hear anything the

sheriffs say now.  The sound of the machine dominates the

sound track.

These following shots are SLOW MOTION.

CU OF FREDDY

CU of his HANDS, rubbing each other getting blown dry

Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle.

The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the

apartment getting everything he needs.  He puts on

his jacket and slips on some sneakers.

DOLLY fast toward the front door knob.  Freddy's hand

comes into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go.  We MOVE

UP to his face.

Fear.

He exits FRAME. We stay put and hear the door open and

close OFF SCREEN.

COPS' POV

From inside an unmarked car across the street, the TWO

COPS watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and

up to Eddie's parked car.

Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.

Cop #1 starts the engine and follows.

Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel.  Mr. Pink is

in the passenger seat.  Freddy and Mr. White are in the

backseat together.

The car laughs.

The car reacts to how horrible that would be.

The car reacts badly.

The car laughs.

Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse.

The four men climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside.

The four men enter the building.

At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are

Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.

We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.

Back to Joe.

CU ON JOE

Joe laughs like a crazy man.

We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.

Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.

Joe EXITS C.U.

We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House

scene together again.  Some sit on folding chairs, some

stand.  Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table.

A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to

the right.

We do a 360 around the men.

Joe points a finger at Freddy.

Freddy shits a brick.

Everybody laughs.

Everybody laughs.

CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard

with the layout of the jewelry store on it.

Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty

little league baseball field.

We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.

CUSTOMERS coming and going.  STORE CLERKS waiting on

customers through the windows.

While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.

White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.

Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street

from the jewelry store, staking it out.

It's the moment of the robbery.  The alley is empty.

In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose.  Guns

FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,

glass BREAKING...

A car whips around the corner, into the alley.

The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

Freddy opens the driver's side door.  A bloody SCREAMING

Mr. Brown FALLS out.

Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics.  He RUNS to the

end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.

FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the

patrol car.

Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.

White's ambush in shock.

Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.

By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown

is dead.

Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.

Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.

Freddy, scared.

Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as

he RUNS.

They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.

A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.

Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car.  He points

his jun at her.

Mr. White climbs into the backseat.

Freddy starts to climb in.

The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.

She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the

face.

C.U. ON FREDDY

as he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened

to him and what he's done.  SLOW MOTION.

Mr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car.  He

SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.

Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is

CRYING.

We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the

getaway car.  Except this time, we never leave Freddy.

CUT FROM FREDDY IN THE BACKSEAT TO:

Mr. Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the

passenger seat going through the satchel with the

diamonds.  Mr. White is in the backseat.  The car is

SPEEDING back to the garage.

MEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and

Mr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks.

We see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,

shot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a

bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding

his wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the

shot.

Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.

Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and

the chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him

once more.

Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.

The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.

There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange

has said.  Finally:

Silence.

Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing

in the warehouse doorway.  He walks into the room.

CAMERA does a 360 around the men.

MR. ORANGE'S POV

Looking up from the floor at everybody.

Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.

He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.

Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.

Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of

firearms.

Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.

Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.

Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.

We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.

MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY

Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.

Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange.  Not taking his eyes off

him.

Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to

start firing any minute.

Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.

White.

Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.

Nobody says nothing.

hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.

Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the

chest.

Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.

The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.

Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.

Joe's dead.

Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest

heaving.  The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.

Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,

not moving.

Mr. Pink is standing motionless.  Finally he grabs the

satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.

We hear outside a CAR START.  Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN

yells out:

We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,

MEN RUNNING to the warehouse.

While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand

but FALLS DOWN.  He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange

lies.

He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and

stroking his brow.

Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an

effort:

Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's

brow.

Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.

Orange's eyes.

The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.

The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside.  We don't see

anything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.

Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.

BANG

We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.

Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.
