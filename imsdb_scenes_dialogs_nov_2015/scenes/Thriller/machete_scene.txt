slides down his front, her breasts brushing his eyes, nose,

mouth.

The patrolcar isn't going anywhere.

her body, making her do a spider dance on the floor.

Torrez's boot connects with Machete's face and he goes

backwards onto the floor.

A SECOND MAN enters. This is DRUGLORD.

DRUGLORD draws a Samurai sword and SLICES Machete like

carving meat. We don't see it.

Elektra stops the car.

Machete gets out, approaches Luz's taco truck. Luz looks

beyond him to Elektra in the car.

Machete lays the ten on the counter.

She reaches for the ten and Machete grabs her wrist, sees the

sniper switchblade scar. She pulls away, slips the money

between her breasts.

INT. ELEKTRA'S CAR - DAY

Machete gets back into Elektra's car. Elektra looks across

him at Luz.

In the rear view mirror; A TRUCK SPEEDS towards them.

The truck REAR ENDS them, sending Elektra's car over the

curb. They rattle around inside like ragdolls.

She jumps out, pissed.

The Militia men open fire, her windows shatter.

She ducks back in, peels out. The truck revs up and pursues.

A second TRUCK joins the chase.

They sandwich Elektra's car between them.

Machete chops off the driver's hand of the right-side truck

and the truck veers off, crashing.

They keep up the gunfire. A slug catches Machete's shoulder.

Machete unholsters it and fires at the truck. The handcannon

shatters the engine block and the truck flips.

INT. ELEKTRA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

It's a mess.

Machete chops onions. A pot boils over with thick green

fluid.

He pours the boiling green gunk into a bowl.

He sucks the mixture up with a TURKEY BASTER.

Hands it to her. It smells nasty.

Machete points to the hole in his shoulder.

Machete takes a swig of Tequila.

She takes a swig, pops a pill and stares at the bloody hole.

She holds her arm up ready...

She JAMS the baster in. The fluid squirts in the hole and

SIZZLES.

Elektra watches in awe as dark green fluid dribbles out of

the wound, followed by a thick yellow goo with veins and

lumps of flesh.

It bubbles like a volcano, she peers in and suddenly...

It BURSTS and SPRAYS pus and flesh chunks all over her.

Elektra runs screaming into the bathroom.

Pancho runs in and gobbles them up.

SNIPER and his henchmen open fire with their MACHINE GUNS.

Luz dives back into the taco truck.

everything. She grabs a gun and shoots back through the

windows.

Shrapnel sprays her face, a huge SLIVER of GLASS SINKS into

her eye.

She yanks it out and shoots back.

Luz is shot in the chest, she flies back blood spewing out.

She sees the men reloading through the window.

Luz is bleeding, one eye gouged out, fading fast.

With her last strength Luz opens the gas valves on the stove

and passes out.

EXT. TACO TRUCK

takes the hammer.

A worker tosses burlap sacks at their feet.

out.

Men with guns run up the stairs.

SPANISH.

SQUAD gets there.

He manages to keep Elektra happy as he BLASTS the MASKED

HITMEN coming in.

They crash through the windows and doors as he finishes

everyone off at once.

weaponry in the chop shop, using all kinds of scrap metal.

Machete lays down sketches and blueprints. The men and

vehicles, like something out of a south of the border Road

Warrior.

A steak KNIFE flies in from off screen and skewers his wrist.

He stumbles back gushing blood,and sees...

Luz; alive and well, a red eye patch on. She's wrapped in

white bandages crossing and covering her chest and her arm.

She's a mess but a beautiful one, like a female road warrior.

Band aids on her forehead. The white bandages cover her dark

skin.

They drag Sniper out of the car and into the chop shop.

dressed in a suit and a girl is brushing his hair while

another brightens his cheeks with a little makeup.

McLaughlin looks relieved.

The girl finishes the makeup and hair job, and smiles at

McLaughlin.

McLaughlin stands and exits, Booth right behind them. As they

leave, we focus on the TV set in McLaughlin's room, showing

the front of the hospital and the news crews outside.

Suddenly the ticker shows BREAKING NEWS... SHOOTOUT AT LOCAL

reporters. McLaughlin approaches a makeshift lectern of

anti-immigration signs.

Thuds get louder, then stop.

staunch the flow of projectile vomit.

Then she's taken from behind by Torrez's henchmen.

He edges in.

Militiamen guard the gate.

flag through the throat, coming out his spine at the back of

EXT. SHOWDOWN

ROAD WARRIOR vehicles barrel towards the armory.

They're driving a semitruck --

It crashes through the front gate, then spins as --

The backdoor of the semi trailer rolls up revealing

A TRICKED OUT MOTORCYCLE

--as Machete rides it out.

Machete's army of workers stream out from their road warrior

chop shop rides.

Machete dismounts. His army behind him.

He raises his MACHETE against the sun and his army all raise

theirs.

Big battle sequence as they storm the armory. Knives and

guns... a ballet of bullets and blood.

LUZ arrives in one of the HOT RODS from the chop shop. She

has a MACHETE GUN that shoots out Machete blades like a

Machine gun.

A minuteman grabs her from behind, but..

He is STABBED in the CALF by Pancho! A METAL HARNESS onhis

back holds a sharp KNIFE that he stabs with.

The minuteman falls, Pancho stabs him in the face.

Luz leads a gang of her customers into the battle.

Minutemen and Mexicanos of all walks of life--janitors,

gardeners, laborers, gangbangers, etc.--fight it out at the

armory. Fighting it out with the implements of their trade--

knives hidden in mops, a weedwhacker attack, etc.

A wailing AMBULANCE CRASHES through a gate running down

minutemen. DOC FELIX and his sexy NURSE get out and help a

wounded Mexican. Doc flicks a SCALPEL at an approaching Goon.

Machete unveils a Gatling Gun with a special mount that

affixes to the front of the chopper.

Booth scrambles to arm himself, but he's cornered. He tries

to take cover behind thugs, but--

Machete on the motorcycle with the Gatling Gun mows down

Booth, machine gunning him in half.

Booth looks down at his own white shirt, now stained crimson

and ripped to shreds as he falls to the ground in TWO PIECES.

While the battle between chopshoppers and militia rages on--

TORREZ appears with ELEKTRA--

Machete stops, turns to see Elektra, bound and gagged in

Torrez's control.

INT. WAREHOUSE

Machete skids into the warehouse. Fuel barrels line a far

wall.

Torrez is ready for him.

Machete squints. Flashes back to the earlier scene. The two

images blur into one.

Torrez ATTACKS Machete

The two FIGHT with sword and machete.

Elektra rolls on the ground, dodging Torrez's rain of blows

from the samurai swords.

One sweep slices her bindings and she scrambles to safety.

The distraction is enough for Machete to gain the upper hand

and slash Torrez across the front.

On the edge of death Torrez seems to soften.

Machete impales TORREZ between the eyes.

Blood shoots out his mouth.

Machete pulls out the blade, Torrez falls dead.

EXPLOSIONS and black smoke light up the sky behind Machete.

FADE IN.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Machete drives his Gun Bike south.

COP LIGHTS appear behind him.

He pulls over.

The Officer walks up. His flashlight blinds him.

The Officer just stands there, silent, his flashlight

blinding in Machete's eyes.

Machete reaches for his knife: then he sees the cops shoes;

RED STILETTOS; It's ELEKTRA.

She puts the green card in his hand. Machete looks at it,

then crumbles it and drops it.

Elektra steps into the headlights. She's dressed in hot COP

LINGERIE.

They kiss.

Machete and Elektra drive away on the gun bike.

The cop car abandoned on the side of the road; lights still

flashing.

DESERT - NIGHT.

A family of illegals crossing the border in the desert, see a

WATER STATION up ahead. They make for it, opening it up and

drinking heavily from the water supply. A BULLET brings one

of them down and the others scramble for safety but there's

someone out there, shooting at them.

MOTHER hushes the younger ones.

The younger ones start to pray.

A JEEP patrols the area and we see it's MINUTEMEN taking

potshots at the illegals.

Flicks on a highpowered light by the side mirrors on the

JEEP.

The light is on long enough to illuminate a MACHETE BLADE

coming straight for them.

His words gurgle in his throat as his head is severed from

his body. 2nd MINUTEMAN freaks and makes a run for it.

Stumbles in the dark, in the dust. Scrambles but can't get to

his feet as he sees the outline of a DARK FIGURE above him.

Young illegals' prayers continue as the MACHETE comes down on

2nd MINUTEMAN.

Sounds of struggle, slaughter... then silence.

Young illegal opens eyes...

There's a glass candle in his hands, but no one else around.

Instead of Christ or a Virgin on the candle is a silhouette

of MACHETE...
