entitled "The Great Escape" by Joshuah Bearman;

"The Master of Disguise" by Antonio Mendez.

The familiar logo WARNER BROS. PRESENTS COMES UP.

After a beat, it is consumed by FIRE.

It becomes AN AMERICAN FLAG, BURNING in the street.

1 EXT. U.S. EMBASSY (TEHRAN) - MORNING 1

Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds

chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika! Fists in the

air.

SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979

YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some

with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full

chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of

Ayatollah Khomeini.

PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who

were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime.

Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH -- JUSTICE

FOR MURDER. A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as

bystanders than peacekeepers.

A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH.

An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.

2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2

From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of

the protest. There are three primary buildings on

campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE

AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.

We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled

traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.

3 INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 3

Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.

Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the

gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.

Carnival's bigger today.

MARK LIJEK, 29, a consular officer, joins Anders at the

window.

4 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 4

Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something

simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate

and makes it to the other side.

And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This

isn't archive footage anymore.

We're looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA

station chief here.

5 INT. MARINE GUARD POST - MORNING 5

From a pillbox on the embassy campus, SGT. ROCKY

SICKMANN, a young MARINE, can also see the protestors

break across the lawn.

MARINE SGT. SICKMANN

(into his radio)

... Fort Apache is breached --

please advise --

6 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 6

The PROTEST in front of the gate is getting rowdier --

its energy and numbers swelling.

A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all

bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to

the front of the protest --

WOMEN raise a banner. It's a signal.

As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A

WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from

underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT

-- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gate

When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket

raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed

PISTOL in his clothes.

More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet

to the other side, one after another.

7 INT. MARINE GUARD POST - MORNING 7

MARINE SGT. SICKMANN

THEY'RE COMING OVER THE WALLS --

8 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 8

But a moment later no more climbing is required, because

the GATE CHAIN IS CUT and protestors FLOOD through the

embassy gates, a human dam breaking --

9 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 9

Mounting chaos in here, the nerve center of the embassy.

Everyone on a different phone. It's like an emergency

room where the patient is the whole building.

ANN SWIFT, 31, Deputy Political Officer, has the phone by

her ear -- trying to hear reports from D.C.

There are hundreds of people out

10 IN THE CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 10

Mark Lijek and Bob Anders look out windows, nervous, but

not like the Iranian VISA APPLICANTS who are close to

panic.

Are these supposed to be

bulletproof?

Well, they've never been tested.

11 INT. CHANCERY (MARINE POST ONE) - MORNING 11

Six MARINES watch images from closed-circuit television

cameras on chunky 1970's monitors. Crowds of protestors

from every part of the embassy campus.

AL GOLACINSKI, 30, chief of security for the embassy,

shouts into a radio.

Marines to Number One -- FALL

12 EXT. CHANCERY - MORNING 12

PROTESTORS come running, turning the corner to reach the

building. They use bats and crowbars to smash the

windows of the building.

13 INT. CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 13

(on the phone)

Can we get some fucking police

please?

14 INT. MARINE POST ONE - MORNING 14

One by one, the security monitors are going black -- or

smashed. The Marines stare.

15 EXT. TALEGHANI AVE. - MORNING 15

An IRANIAN POLICE CAPTAIN smokes a cigarette, watching

the mayhem, impassive.

16 INT. MARINE POST ONE - MORNING 16

They need an hour to burn the

classified -- Hold.

(beat, stern)

You shoot one person, they'll kill

every one of us in here.

17 EXT. CONSULATE - MORNING 17

PROTESTORS, now on the embassy grounds, carry banners.

La ilaha ilallah --

A WOMAN IN A CHADOR uses her own radio.

Some of them ring around the building, holding hands and

chanting. Some carry AUTOMATIC WEAPONS openly.

18 INT. MARINE POST ONE - MORNING 18

Tear gas as last resort ONLY -- I

repeat, only if your life is under

threat!

19 INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 19

20 INT. CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 20

-- We're not going out in this --

We are in the only building with

an exit direct to the street. We

need to GO --

The SOUNDS OF MARINES barking at one another over the

radio.

22 INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 22

To reason with them.

Marines open the Chancery door, with a look --

23 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 23

FRED KUPKE, 34, communications officer, is shouting at

staffers who pile up documents for the shredders --

Just everything. Don't sort it --

(on the phone)

-- NONE, there are no police --

24 EXT. CHANCERY - MORNING 24

Al Golacinski steps out onto the steps and immediately

there is shouting, and a protestor puts a GUN to his head

-- blindfolds him -- PUSHING AL'S head to the ground...

25 INT. CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 25

-- Second floor -- anyone who can

hear this -- we need help --

As we MOVE DOWN the line of desks, J STAFFORD is also

on a radio repeating the same in FARSI --

Others PACK things.

26 INT. THE HALLWAY - INTO THE VAULT - MORNING 26

MARINES and STAFFERS -- including TOM AHERN -- RUN down

the hall, pushing a cart of items to secure. They reach

the security locker -- code the door -- and enter the

locker, heading to the INCINERATOR to begin destroying

classified material --

27 EXT. CHANCERY - MORNING 27

Golacinski HELD UP TO THE DOOR -- GUN TO HIS HEAD. He

starts to panic.

Let me in! Jesus Christ! Open

the fucking door!

The Marines OPEN THE CHANCERY DOOR -- PROTESTERS POUR IN.

27A INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 27A

-- Washington on flash -- Get Ops

-- get a line --

We hear --

The POUNDING of footsteps on the roof. They look up.

28 EXT. CONSULATE ROOF - MORNING 28

Protestors RUNNING on the roof of the consulate building.

Several stop to try and RIP off a vent cover using CLUBS

and PIPES.

29 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 29

THOUSANDS are now on the grounds of the embassy and they

continue to swarm through the gates.

The student with the SUPER 8 continues to film it all.

Also filming, a NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER with a 16 mm camera.

Smoking cannisters of TEAR GAS, people hurling them.

A protestor lights a paper on fire to ward off the sting

of the gas --

30 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 30

STAFFERS using pieces of machines to destroy other

machines -- any embassy equipment that might function --

Then... screams. The lights have gone out. The power

has been cut.

31 IN THE VAULT - MORNING 31

AHERN destroys the cryptography keys -- box-sized hard

drives -- while BILL DAUGHERTY, 33, tosses stacks of

papers into an electrical furnace.

Well, Tom. You wanted to see the

world...

The furnace makes a LOUD CHUNK and stops. They both hold

their looks for a beat.

Are you kidding me?

Get the shredder.

32 INT. CHANCERY STAIRWELL LEADING TO 2ND FLOOR - MORNING 32

BROTHER ALI, 20s, one of the student leaders, shouts as

he holds a cloth near his face to protect from tear gas.

33 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 33

34 INT. CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 34

Bob Anders SMASHES AMERICAN VISA PLATES.

The visa-applicant Iranians are now huddled in a group.

A couple of the women are wailing.

Improv resuming the debate over leaving.

Lijek on his walkie, but every channel is now speaking

FARSI.

36 INT. CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 36

Mark gestures for the other six staffers -- and the

twenty IRANIAN VISA SEEKERS in the office -- to head to

the stairwell.

Iranians first.

(as no one moves)

Go! Now!

37 INT. CHANCERY - HALLWAY - MORNING 37

One STUDENT emerges with a large portrait of KHOMEINI

that had been used for dart practice.

Who has made this!!!

Two EMBASSY EMPLOYEES look at the floor.

38 INT. CONSULATE STAIRWELL - MORNING 38

The twenty VISA-SEEKING IRANIANS pass our guys and run

down the stairs out onto the street and disperse outside.

Behind them, the FIVE CONSULATE EMPLOYEES we saw head

down the stairs.

So the group of SIX is: MARK AND CORA LIJEK, J AND

KATHY STAFFORD, and BOB ANDERS. They get to the bottom

of the stairs.

39 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 39

The students, guns drawn, burst into the Chancery Office,

shouting at Ann Swift and the others. The mood among the

staffers is now almost peaceful.

(into the phone)

It's done. They're in.

She puts down the phone.

40 EXT. BIST METRI STREET - MORNING 40

side of the roof and the embassy campus is distant. Just

the empty street.

On the ground: discarded banners from the protest,

fliers and newspapers.

We see something that looks like BLOOD on the street.

They walk west. They're hurrying but taking care not to

run. The five can hear the gunfire and shouting in

Farsi. They walk up the street, away from the sounds of

the protest, instinctively grouping together. Cora looks

back.

41-45 OMITTED 41-45

46 INT. STATE DEPARTMENT HALL - SEVENTH FLOOR - NIGHT 46

Halfway around the world, hell has broken loose here,

too. BATES and MALICK, 30s, State Department mid-level

aides. A cascade of voices and energy -- a reverberation

from the embassy siege -- the building exploding into a

crisis center.

I was told five.

Apparently it's six now.

What happened?

Not clear. We know they escaped

the embassy.

Where are they?

The Canadian Ambassador's house.

Are we attempting rescue?

Hold for the Secretary --

Can we get Ottawa patched? Five

We've got 60 in the embassy with

(coming to the door)

Bani-Sadr's saying it'll be over

Leave the six where they are.

I'll go brief the president.

CUT TO BLACK.

49A EXT. OLD DOMINION DRIVE (VIRGINIA) - AFTERNOON 49A

A LONE ribbon sags in the f.g. -- the CAPITOL BUILDING

Yellow ribbons tied to lampposts. A Catholic church with

a sign on the lawn that says PRAY FOR OUR HOSTAGES. A

dry cleaner with a large American flag in the window and

yellow ribbons drawn by kids around it.

start to pick up TVs as we go by them -- all tuned to

some version of the same story.

He enters the front doors and crosses the famous EMBLEM

on the ground.

He moves past the STARS ON THE WALL, signifying fallen

CIA officers (and there were fewer stars then than now).

He passes the SECURITY GUARD at the desk, holds up his

O'Donnell hands Mendez pages with STAFF PHOTOGRAPHS of

SIX PEOPLE -- the escaped embassy employees -- as he

continues to toss stuff into his folder.

White House?

56A INT. CIA - THE PIT - CONTINUOUS ACTION 56A

They walk through an open floor of cubicles lined with

offices, we get a look at the 1979 CIA headquarters:

nothing sleek or sexy about the interior. An open area

of desks where Woodward and Bernstein might be spilling

coffee on their thick  70s ties. Papers and files

everywhere. Trash emptying happens only once a week.

Cigarette and cigar butts in ashtrays. Everything is

perpetually a mess. And typewriters. The constant

percussive sound of telexes and typing is the metronome

that beats out the day here.

Carter's shitting enough bricks to

build the pyramids. He wants the

six of them out.

Who else knows?

Just the families. Meanwhile,

some genius in the embassy was

keeping a mug book of everybody

who worked there.

Jesus Christ.

56A CONTINUED: 56A

We think it got shredded before

they got in, but the fuckers have

laminated badges and folders with red stripes walk with

purpose.

State's coordinating in-house.

They don't do exfils.

They do now. They want to run it

by us, strictly as consultants.

Off his look.

Engell's saying it's lose-lose.

These people die, they die badly.

Publicly.  State wants the blame,

he'll give it to them.

Then why's he want me?

So he can tell State he ran it by

his best exfil guy.

They stop in front of a conference room. Jack looks at

him.

Tony. This isn't the kind of

meeting where you talk.

58 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 58

They enter to find: ADAM ENGELL, 40s or 50s, Deputy

Chief of Operations, hosting visitors from the State

Department: PENDER and BATES from State. The State guys

Engell.

Other CIA Operations OFFICERS and ANALYSTS sit in

audience.

If he could act he wouldn't be

He smiles and waves at the Minotaur and begins to work on

his prosthetic with a brush and solvent.

89 INT. NEAR CRAFT SERVICES TABLE - DAY 89

Chambers is foraging through  70s SNACKS. At the craft

service table. A guy in his SPACE ARMOR PANTS without

A P.A. approaches, carrying a PHONE on a long cord.

P.A.

Who is it?

Chambers gives the kid a look, takes the phone from him

Hey, Tony.

90 INT. CIA - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 90

Pender and Engell sit at the table; O'Donnell hovers. A

few State Department and CIA ANALYSTS here, including

Malinov and Lamont; and DAVID MARMOR, early 30s, Engell's

Is he coming?

Engell nods for the door to be shut.

Okay. Our N.E. put together a

work-up. David.

They would pose as teachers from

the international school.

We went through all that -- it's

O'Donnell looking at the clock.

Suppose. Suppose Heckle and

Jeckle go over and save them --

The door swings open.

Hi. Sorry. Hi.

O'Donnell approaches, quietly stands behind him, smoking

We want you to go to L.A. If you

can make the movie thing credible,

we'll take it to the Director.

Don't fuck up. The whole

92 INT. T.W.A. FLIGHT - MORNING 92

Mendez sits in an aisle seat. The PASSENGER next to him

Mendez is reading THE FIVE C'S OF CINEMATOGRAPHY.

93 INT. MIDDLE-CLASS TEHRAN HOUSE - NIGHT 93

Six KOMITEH force their way into a house.

SAVAK! SAVAK!

A Komiteh drags away a MAN in his forties while the man's

wife cries. Automatic weapons are aimed at him, point-

From ACROSS THE STREET, an IRANIAN WOMAN, 20s, watches.

95 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - 95

Lee Schatz and Bob Anders play poker in a room decorated

99 INT. CHAMBERS' STUDIO - AFTERNOON 99

Chambers leads Mendez into his makeup studio and starts

to open windows. Around the studio: stunt double-masks,

deformed monster foreheads, dental implants on shelves.

Planet of the Apes prosthetics. Mr. Spock ears on

Styrofoam stands. (Chambers created all these --

really.)

What are you shooting?

A monster movie.

Any good?

The target audience will hate it.

Who's the target audience?

People with eyes. Talk to me.

It's an exfil.

From where?

Worst place you can think of.

Universal City.

Mendez picks up a Newsweek magazine under a can of Tab on

a makeup table: blindfolded Iran hostages on the cover.

Chambers takes it in for a moment -- the gravity of it.

How you getting in the embassy?

Six got away. They're hiding in

the city. I'm going over to get

them.

What am I making?

I need you to help me make a fake

movie.

You've come to the right place.

I need to set up a production

company and build a cover around

making a movie.

That we're not going to make.

No.

You want to go around Hollywood

acting like you're an important

person in the movie business.

That's right.

But you don't want to actually do

anything.

No.

You'll fit right in.

100 INT. SMOKE HOUSE - AFTERNOON 100

A couple of empty highball glasses on the table.

Chambers is looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of the SIX. Mendez is

taking notes. On a photo of Cora Lijek.

This one's got an M.A. in English.

She should be your screenwriter.

Sometimes they go on scouts  cause

they want the free meals.

(re: Bob Anders)

This guy's the director.

Can you teach a guy how to be a

director in a day?

You can teach a rhesus monkey to

be a director in a day. Look, if

you're gonna do it, you've got to

do it. The Khomaniacs are fruit

loops, but they have cousins

selling eight tracks and prayer

rugs on La Brea. You can't build

cover stories around a movie that

dsn't exist. You need a script.

You need a producer.

I'm the producer.

No, you're not.  Associate' at

best. If it's a twenty-million

dollar Star Wars rip-off, you need

somebody who's a somebody to put

his name on it.

Here we see some AUTOGRAPHED  70s CELEBRITY 8X10s hanging

on the wall.

The waiter brings a bill.

Somebody respectable. With

and rabbi. His father sold perfume on the Lower East

Side. Lester is halfway to dressed in a tuxedo.

I only got a couple minutes. I'm

getting a lifetime achievement

award tonight.

Mazel tov, Lester.

Aaah, I'd rather stay home and

Chambers stops at the muted television. More images of

angry crowds.

You ever think, Lester, how it's

all for the cameras?

They're getting the ratings, I'll

Siegel looks at the TV: at that moment, a HOSTAGE TAKER

holding up photos of hostages for CAMERAS in front of

him. He takes a beat.

We're gonna need a script.

A beat of silence. A LOOK from Siegel to Chambers.

CHAMBERS (V.O.)

How  bout The Horses of Achilles?

104 EXT. BY LESTER'S POOL - MORNING 104

Chambers, on hold on the phone, walks to Siegel holding

up The Horses of Achilles script in a William Morris

binder. Stacks of scripts on a table outside. Siegel's

new A.F.I. award is being used as a coaster.

Nobody makes Westerns anymore.

(looking through it)

It's ancient Troy.

If it's got horses in the title,

it's a Western.

Is it the wrong day?

It's always the wrong day.

111 INT. MAX KLEIN'S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 111

We see all kinds of MOVIE POSTERS AND MEMORABILIA ALL

OVER THE OFFICE.

You're gonna get this into

One month.

Who are you again?

Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.

He's the money.

I thought you were retired,

Lester.

-- Till I read the Argo. Look,

how  bout we say fifteen thou and

close on this?

You want me to be honest with you,

Les?

Naah, bullshit me, Max.

Okay. Because I enjoyed your

films, the early ones. I took

this meeting out of respect

because I wanted to tell you  no'

to your face.

Thank you. Very respectful.

You're done, Lester. You've gotta

get your cataracts fixed and read

the trades. MGM just capitalized

for six new films and they're

desperate for Sci-Fi. They've

already offered me four times what

you are.

What can I say? Congratulations.

(shrugs to Mendez)

He's got me.

A beat. Mendez ready to go --

But see -- it worries me, what you

said, and I'll tell you why. A

couple weeks back I was sitting in

Trader Vic's enjoying a Mai Tai

when my pal Warren Beatty came to

wish me well and we had a little

chat. Seems he was attached to

star in Zulu Empire -- which was

gonna anchor that MGM slate -- but

Warren confided in me that the

picture's gone over-budget  cause

the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

They may be cannibals swallowing

each other up but they want health

and dental, so the movie's kaput --

which means that MGM deal ain't

gonna happen and your script ain't

worth the buffalo-shit on a

nickel. So.

Lester takes some documents out of a folder.

The way this looks to me --

through the cataracts, I grant you

-- is that you can either sign

here and take ten thousand for

your toilet-paper script -- or you

can go fuck yourself.

Siegel smiles kindly and holds a pen and the contracts

out to Klein. Klein takes them.

112 EXT. STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER 112

You know Warren Beatty?

I took a leak next to him at the

Golden Globes.

Taco?

114 EXT. WARNER BROS. LOT - LATE DAY 114

Lester and Tony eat tacos at a picnic table on the lot.

You got kids, Lester?

Two daughters.

You see them much?

I talk to them once a year, maybe.

Why's that?

I was a terrible father.

The bullshit business is like coal

mining. You can't wash it off

before you kiss your wife and

kids... You?

A son. Lives with his mother in

Virginia.

You're divorced?

Taking time off.

Chambers leads us into the main room, leading Tony to a

table where JACK KIRBY, 62, comics artist, fusses with

large COMIC PANELS of ARGO CONCEPT DRAWINGS spread over a

table.

Kirby starts to distribute storyboards. Some hold on to

them and an ASSISTANT begins putting them up on the

board.

Mendez looks at them. Impressed. He picks up a drawing

of some futuristic-looking vehicles.

Any way to make the chariots look

Kirby takes out a marker and starts to sketch a

futuristic-looking desert glider.

So the title refers to...

Is it the Argonaut?

Siegel dsn't know what he's talking about.

And finally Lester's had it -- with his mouth full --

It means Argo fuck yourself.

... you think this -- We tried to get the message

-- this is more plausible than

teachers?

One, there are no foreign teachers

in Iran anymore --

-- two, we think everybody knows

Hollywood people. And everybody

thinks they would shoot during

Stalingrad with Pol Pot directing

if it'd sell tickets.

There are only bad options. It's

about finding the best one.

You don't have a better bad idea

than this?

This is the best bad idea we have,

sir. By far.

Vance and Turner exchange looks.

The United States government just

sanctioned your science fiction

movie.

146 INT. MENDEZ'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 146

Mendez is packing to go. He packs a passport with his

photo and the name KEVIN COSTA HARKINS. He takes off his

wedding band and places it with care -- almost with

ceremony -- in a spot on his dresser.

148 INT. O'DONNELL'S CAR - NIGHT 148

O'Donnell is driving, Mendez in the passenger seat. They

just sit there for a moment. In the car.

I'm required to remind you that if

you're detained, the agency will

not claim you.

Barely claim me as it is.

Your  In Case Of's' good?

Just Christine.

They don't need to look at one another. A shared

understanding.

Guess I should have brought some

books to read in prison.

Nah. They'll kill you long before

prison.

Tony gets out of the car, pulls his bags from the back

seat, and slams the door. Headed into the airport.

149 INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - DUSK 149

Siegel is standing in the office watching Jimmy Carter

speak mournfully on TV, Chambers watching from a desk

behind him.

Bad news, bad news, even when it's

good news it's bad news. Christ.

He sits near a mailbox inside the terminal writing on a

postcard with the Washington Monument on it.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE BUDDY-MAN. NO PHONE FOR A WHILE.

JACK WILL CALL. LOVE YOU BOTH. Then he adds: SO MUCH.

He drops the card in the box and heads toward a gate

marked LUFTHANSA.

157 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 157

The Houseguests are gathered around Bob Anders.

Christ's sake. To get some air in

MARK LIJEK J STAFFORD

You know what the rules All it takes is one second

Who saw me go out?

MARK LIJEK CORA LIJEK

It dsn't matter. You did I did, actually. I saw

go out. you.

Miss Hall Monitor. Creeping

around with her notebook --

Don't talk to her that way.

CORA LIJEK BOB ANDERS

(to Mark) Little Laura Ingalls.

I'll defend myself. Okay? Watching every move --

A sound at the door, and they go silent.

Dad's home.

Ken carrying his briefcase, cheerfully oblivious to what

he's walked into.

You're getting a visitor.

159 INT. WEST WING - MORNING 159

to Jordan's office.

160 INT. CHIEF OF STAFF OFFICE - MORNING 160

He finds Jordan sitting on a long table, looking

exhausted, silently watching one of the monitors: The

Today Show on NBC.

A man in Scranton's putting a flag

on his lawn for every day of

captivity.

When he runs out of lawn, Kennedy

wins the primary.

Vance hands him the folder.

The six with the Canadians are

coming out.

Jordan, brought back from Scranton and politics by this,

opens the file and looks at it.

Who signed off on this?

162 EXT. ISTANBUL - PLAZA ON THE WATER - DAY 162

Mendez walks, the BOSPHORUS in the b.g. He reaches the

doors of an OFFICIAL-LOOKING BUILDING and gs inside.

163 INT. IRANIAN CONSULATE (ISTANBUL) - DAY 163

Mendez sits in a reception room with a few VISA

APPLICANTS. Photographs of the Ayatollah Khomeini hang

on the wall. Two REVOLUTIONARY GUARD OFFICIALS in ill-

fitting suits sit at a desk.

164 INT. IRANIAN CONSULATE - VISA OFFICE - DAY 164

The IRANIAN CONSUL OFFICIAL, late 30s, is smoking.

What will be the purpose of your

visit to Iran?

Business. Film production.

The Consul Official looks at his Canadian passport.

Why didn't you get your visa in

Canada?

My boss waited until I was here to

send the telex.

If he had a thought in his head,

it would die of loneliness.

Pointed look from Mendez. The universal condition of

boss hatred almost always works for him, and it ds now.

Consul nods. Stamps the passport. KINGDOM OF IRAN -- He

crosses out KINGDOM and writes by hand: ISLAMIC REPUBLIC

OF.

164A EXT. BLUE MOSQUE - MORNING 164A

Tony walks through the doorway revealing the historic

mosque, we hear the call to prayer echo through the

courtyard. Tony walks through the courtyard. We see

some TOURISTS with  70s Instamatics. Locals are HEADING

IN TO PRAY.

165 INT. HAGIA SOPHIA - UPPER LEVEL - LATER 165

We see the beautiful ceiling of the former cathedral.

PULL BACK to reveal Tony stands looking out over the

second level balcony. A MAN walks up behind him.

MAN (O.S.)

a pre-revolutionary state.' End

quote.

Mendez looks up: a MAN, late 40s-50s with a British

accent, is talking to him. PETER NICHOLLS, an Oxbridge

type and a very good spy.

165A INT. HAGIA SOPHIA - LOWER LEVEL - DAY 165A

FIND Mendez and Nicholls.

Were you metal detecting?

None left to find. Shah escaped

with a 747 so laden with gold bars

it nearly didn't make it off the

runway.

But you kept busy.

Ferrying out the torture apparatus

of our friend's fallen

dictatorship.

Both these men do this work and share an unspoken

understanding. They stop and look up at a MOSAIC on the

wall. An ancient rendition of Christ, fashioned before

the Muslims took the city and converted this church to a

mosque.

Nicholls has WHITE AND YELLOW SLIPS OF PAPER with Farsi

writing on them in hand. He gives them to Tony.

It's getting worse. Everybody who

lands at Mehrabad now fills out

one of these.

(a WHITE one)

That slip makes a copy to this one

underneath.

(a YELLOW one)

Passenger keeps Yellow, Airport

keeps White.

165A CONTINUED: 165A

When you leave the country, they

match them up to verify you came

into the country when you said you

did.

So if they look, they'll know six

people didn't come in with me.

If they look.

Nicholls and Tony turn away from the mosaic,

surreptitious work now done, and meander toward the

middle of the great room.

166 INT. HAGIA SOPHIA - CONTINUOUS ACTION 166

Nicholls and Tony walk towards the inner courtyard.

When you land, you should go

straight to the Ministry of

Culture and Islamic Guidance to

kiss the ring. Get on record as

having applied for a film permit.

If they catch you later, at least

they'll be confused while they're

torturing you... Your biggest

problem may be convincing the six

of them to go with you. They're

foreign service. They're willful.

Nicholls takes a picture.

How's June?

Left.

I'm sorry.

She picked out a ring and gave me

a choice. She's a Chinese

national. If I married her, I'd

have to resign, so. You and

Christine?

Good. Yeah.

166A EXT./INT. PRODUCERS' BUILDING - NIGHT 166A

170 INT. BRITISH AIRWAYS DC-10 - MORNING 170

Mendez sits in a window seat. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT speaks

with a pleasant British accent.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.)

The Captain has informed us that

we have entered Iranian airspace.

Members of our cabin crew will be

coming through to collect any

remaining alcoholic beverages at

this time.

171 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 171

Mendez walks through the terminal of a crowded 1960s-era

airport. Newly-hung portraits of the Ayatollah Khomeini

watch over the duty-free shops.

SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - JANUARY 26

The MOBS OF PEOPLE WITH BOXES OF THEIR WORLDLY BELONGINGS

puts in high relief that Tony is going into a place that

everyone else is desperately fleeing.

172 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT IMMIGRATION - DAY 172

Tony fills out a white form. It makes an impression on a

YELLOW form.

Tony presents his passport to a REVOLUTIONARY GUARD

IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Official looks at it, Tony hears

the sound of a woman screaming in Farsi.

Three lanes away, at the outgoing immigration station, a

Revolutionary Guard is dragging away the woman's HUSBAND.

The Immigration Official stamps Tony's passport -- takes

the white form, gives Tony the yellow one -- and waves

him through.

173 EXT. TEHRAN - DAY 173

Archive footage may be mixed with new footage. Normal

city life mixed with men with automatic weapons. The

contradictions of Tehran at this moment.

173A EXT. TEHRAN - DAY 173A

A Massive HELICOPTER SHOT OF TEHRAN. We TILT DOWN to see

a traffic jam SPRAWLS AROUND THE AZADI MONUMENT. Bikes,

mopeds, pedestrians, peddlers and old, patched together

cars compete for space. No one gets anywhere.

174 INT. TAXI - DAY 174

Mendez sits in the back of a taxi in the Tehran traffic,

some of the worst traffic in the world. We see the AZADI

MONUMENT out his window.

ANGLES OUT HIS WINDOWS

The Ayatollah looks down from everywhere.

A MAN IS HANGING FROM A CRANE. People mill underneath.

Women in chadors at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

An ARMED GANG in the back of pickup truck pulls up near

his taxi.

We see PROPAGANDA painted on a wall/window.

175 INT. TAXI/EXT. MINISTRY - DAY 175

176 INT. MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND ISLAMIC GUIDANCE - DAY 176

MEHDI BEHROUZ, 33, is the newly appointed Deputy Minister

of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Like many of the stars

of the Revolution, he was educated in the U.S. Right now

he's looking at the ARGO script.

This film crew is just yourself?

Six more are joining me today.

They're coming from Canada.

You'd like to film at the bazaar?

The bazaar, maybe the palace.

I see. The exotic Orient. Snake

charmers and flying carpets.

You come to us at a complicated

time. Before the Revolution, 40

percent of the movie theaters in

Tehran were showing pornography.

Our function is purification as

well as promotion of the arts.

I'll review for the Minister.

177 EXT. CANADIAN EMBASSY - DAY 177

A TAXI pulls away.

Mendez, carrying his luggage, stands at a wrought iron

gate with MAPLE LEAVES worked into the iron. Ken Taylor

comes out of the building, opens the gate himself.

Mr. Ambassador.

Ken Taylor.

He shakes Tony's hand and they start to walk to Taylor's

car.

I was expecting more of a G-Man

look.

You're thinking of FBI, sir.

They get into the car.

178 INT. TAYLOR'S CAR - OUTSIDE EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 178

Taylor gives Tony SIX BLANK CANADIAN PASSPORTS.

These are blank, y'know. The

stamps?

I'll take care of that.

How long?

A day to prep them with their

cover stories. Two if they need

it.

And you'll fly out with them?

Tony nods. A distant sound of a crowd outside.

There's something you should know.

We think one of our housekeepers

figured out who they are. We

don't know if we can trust her.

Now the noise outside is louder. Taylor turns to the

window. Tony joins him.

So sooner is better.

They stand listening to the demonstration sounds, echoing

over the rooftops of the city.

179A INT. CIA - O'DONNELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 179A

He got to the embassy.

O'Donnell closes the door. Pender, wearing an undone

tuxedo, as if he's just been pulled from a formal event.

They stay standing.

I can't tell you more than that

(cutting to it)

The Times and A.P. found out

they're with the Canadians.

Somebody in one of the families

talked.

Mother of God.

I just put Vance on a plane to

take the editors to Le Cirque. He

thinks he can get them to sit on

it. For now.

Your guy better get them and get

the hell out.

180 EXT. SHEMIRANAT (TEHRAN) - DAY 180

Ken Taylor drives up to a nice, but not huge, home in the

expat/diplomatic neighborhood of Tehran. Automatic gates

open.

181 EXT./INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY 181

Taylor leads Mendez inside. Pat Taylor waits for them in

the hall. Takes Tony's hand.

182 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE (TEHRAN) - DAY 182

They enter the LIVING ROOM... and here are the SIX

HOUSEGUESTS. They're looking at Mendez like kids waiting

to be told the lesson plan.

183 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - 183

Each Houseguest has a copy of the ARGO script.

It's theater of the absurd.

What are the chances?

The chances are good.

What's the number value of  good'?

30 percent chance of success? 80

percent?

We just --

What was the objection to picking

normal cover identities?

There are no Canadians in the

country for normal reasons.

KATHY STAFFORD MARK LIJEK

We can't stand up to that. We

you. This is what I do.

184 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - 184

He puts the Iranian newspaper in front of Mendez.

You've been here an hour and

you're asking us to trust you with

our lives, Mr. --

Harkins.

Is that your real name?

A beat.

No.

J Stafford nods, as if this has proven a point. He

gs back into the living room, followed by Kathy.

ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH

Airport. Terrified, being led out at gunpoint.

185 EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - VERANDA - NIGHT 185

already there.

We've got orders to close the

embassy and go back. There's

nowhere for them to stay.

BOB ANDERS J STAFFORD

Don't do this, J... ... the part where we say,

might work'? C'mon...

Snitches in banana republics.

They get them over the border

after the coup...

BOB ANDERS J STAFFORD

That's your opinion. ... pay the guards at the

crossing a hundred bucks to

look the other way...

His opinion got us out of the

embassy in the first place.

187 EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - VERANDA - NIGHT 187

Pat and I discussed it. If they

catch you at the airport, they

come here and we go on trial for

harboring the enemy. It's a risk

we took.

(after a moment)

Can you pull this off?

I don't know.

188 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - 188

-- even if they do. They find us

here, we're not lying, we're just

hiding. We go out there with fake

passports, we're spies, period,

execution.

So how long do we stay? A month?

A year?

That man out there, he's got bad

cards, he's gonna lose. If he

loses, it's our lives.

189A INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - 189A

Mendez, now dressed to leave, is handing each Houseguest

an envelope.

What I need you to do is memorize

everything inside. Who you are,

what you are, where you've been.

Cora Lijek looks at a document from inside her envelope.

A union card for the Canadian Writers Guild with her

picture on it.

When we're done, you'll know these

so well that you'll dream as these

people.

Mendez nods at them, and gs. The Houseguests look at

what's inside their envelopes -- all except J Stafford,

whose envelope remains sealed.

190 INT. SHERATON HOTEL - NIGHT 190

192 INT. SHERATON ROOM - NIGHT 192

Tony is PREPPING the CANADIAN PASSPORTS -- expertly

copying Farsi stamps with a small sharpened stick. A

KNOCK on the door. Tony hides the passports. Answers

the door.

Sir, a telex arrived for you.

The BELLHOP hands Tony a piece of paper. He reads it.

193 INT. SHERATON ROOM - NIGHT 193

Mendez takes a small 1978 model radio out of his

suitcase. He unscrews the casing and from inside takes

out what looks like a 6-inch transistor board for the

radio.

On either side of the board: telephone jacks.

He detaches the cords from the hotel phone and plugs them

into the jacks on the transistor board. It's a phone

scrambler.

MENDEZ (V.O.)

Guidance has approved your

location scout.'

194 INT. SHERATON ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 194

Mendez, on the phone --

Khayyam entrance to the Grand

Bazaar tomorrow at 3 PM.'

195 INT. O'DONNELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 195

O'Donnell on the phone.

They called your bluff.

Or maybe they're cooperating.

N.E. says absolutely not. Seven

Americans walking the bazaar,

Never give them multiple shots at

a cover. Are they even ready?

They're getting there.

Terrific. There's no prize for

out?

196 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 196

Mark Lijek is studying pages from the envelope Tony gave

him. J Stafford is sitting near him, having a drink,

watching Iranian State Television footage of the

Ayatollah. J Stafford translates out loud.

looking forward to martyrdom.

Kathy Stafford looks into the room. J stops talking,

looks up.

Mark, looking to J. This is new.

I think we're gonna die here.

197 INT. KOMITEH HEADQUARTERS (AMIR ABAD DISTRICT) - DAY 197

The feeling here is dangerous. Young men carrying

automatic weapons casually.

Behrouz stands next to ALI KHALKALI, 30s, a Revolutionary

Committee security official. There are RECONSTRUCTED

EMBASSY PICTURES ON THE WALL.

We see the FAMOUS PICTURES OF THE HOSTAGES BEING MARCHED

DOWN THE STEPS.

197A INT. KOMITEH HEADQUARTERS STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 197A

A Kafka-esque stairway. We see a YOUNG KOMITEH call up

from the bottom and head up the stairs.

JUMP CUT TO: one flight to go.

Now on the level WITH CAMERA, we carry him INTO the

office as he hands off the ARGO script and STUDIO SIX

BUSINESS CARD. Khalkali has some words in Farsi for the

young man.

198 EXT. SHERATON BALCONY - MORNING 198

Tony looks at one of the Argo storyboards -- one

depicting an EXOTIC SPICE MARKET, a BAZAAR -- in the

light.

CORA LIJEK (V.O.)

199 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KEN'S OFFICE - 199

The Houseguests are gathered in the office. Cora hands

the telefax to Bob Anders. J Stafford, looking on.

You said  a day to learn your

covers then straight to the

airport.' You said that.

They suspect something?

What I know is we need to act like

a movie crew. We go to the bazaar

today, we fly out tomorrow.

Silent assent among the group. Then J Stafford,

sitting with his wife, speaks up --

We won't do it.

He told them there were six of us.

They're expecting six.

You are about to show the only

card we're holding. Which is that

they don't know we're here.

I'm asking you to trust me.

I don't trust you.

(fed up, to J)

What's the alternative? This is

the ball game, J. What world

are you living in?

The one where they're hanging

people from construction cranes,

Bob.

J takes Kathy's hand and gs, leaving Mendez with the

others. After a moment --

So we'll see you at two?

200 INT. CARPET FACTORY - MORNING 200

A KOMITEH BOSS inspects the work of the CARPET WEAVER

KIDS -- whose numbers have grown into the HUNDREDS -- as

they labor quietly.

Some HEADSHOTS are in various stages of repair.

Dozens of documents are now complete, sitting on the

floor in rows. Some pages from the EMBASSY MUG BOOK are

now re-assembled. The boss picks one of the pages up:

meticulously worked so that text and photos are now

intact.

201 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY 201

This one.

She gives Bob Anders a Canadian maple leaf lapel pin,

which he affixes to his shirt. Cora Lijek paints lighter

hair dye onto her hair. The Houseguests are making

subtle efforts to disguise themselves.

(at a mirror, quoting

So don't be recognizable, but look

exactly like your passport

picture.

Not that picture. You won't want

to scare them.

A nervous smile. Trying to deal with anxiety.

J and Kathy Stafford look to each other. Sitting

reading newspapers while the other Houseguests prep for

the scout. The PHONE starts ringing.

(answering the phone)

Hello?

A cloud comes over Pat as she listens.

No, there's no one like that here.

She hangs up the phone fast, as if it were hot to the

touch.

Who was it?

Pat shakes her head.

ON J STAFFORD

listening. Kathy takes his hand.

Somebody knows.

202 INT. SHERATON ROOM - DAY 202

Tony getting dressed. Thinking.

He gets up and leaves, and we start to hear the sound of

a man talking fast in Farsi.

203 EXT. CAR RENTAL - DAY 203

It's a CAR RENTAL MAN, 60s, speaking. Tony is looking at

a MINIVAN on a lot of beaten-up rental cars.

This one, how much? One day, how

much?

204 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY 204

Four of the Houseguests are waiting on the couch, dressed

in their best approximation of the clothes of a movie

scout crew. Cora has the maple leaf flag pin on her

shirt.

They turn when they see Tony come in the door.

205 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY 205

... to find J Stafford sitting at the table. They are

badly shaken.

I promise you that if you will

play along today, I will get you

out tomorrow.

I wish I could believe you, Mr.

Harkins.

My name is Tony Mendez.

Mendez gs back out to the minivan. STAY WITH J and

Kathy.

206 INT. MINIVAN - DAY 206

Mendez, in the driver's seat, looks at the house, then at

his watch. He starts up the van, filled with four of the

Houseguests.

Then he looks in the rearview and sees one of the back

doors open. J and Kathy Stafford board.

207 EXT. TEHRAN - DAY 207

Tony drives the minivan through streets of Tehran. The

Houseguests sit in silence, looking out the windows.

There is a vehement DEMONSTRATION going on -- stars-and-

stripes burning in Molavi Square -- and it's taking place

right in their way.

They stop at the demonstration, then realize people

aren't passing by as much as celebrating in the street.

Tony is forced to nose his way through the crowd --

chanting and yelling -- some SLAPPING THE WINDOWS.

They finally get through and pull away. With the

demonstration receding behind them, Tony tries to regain

their focus.

Tell me who you are.

This recalls attention from the windows.

Mike McEwan, cameraman.

Robert Baker, director.

Timothy Harris, location manager.

Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.

Rachel Dewart, production

designer.

Kathy looks at her husband.

Sean Bissett, associate producer.

Let's make a movie.

208 EXT. STREET NEAR THE BAZAAR - DAY 208

The minivan double-parks on Musavi Street. Taxis, men

loading and unloading rolled-up carpets onto pickup

trucks, chaos.

A YOUNG MAN IN SUIT WITH NO TIE waits. This is REZA, mid-

20s, a low-level administrator in the Ministry of

Guidance.

Mendez gets out and they speak and shake hands. The

image FREEZES. In a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.

They exchange pleasantries and Reza leads them down a

narrow street toward the bazaar.

209 EXT./INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 209

Reza is leading Mendez and the group of Houseguests

through the Tehran Bazaar. A word about the place: the

world's largest bazaar. 10 kilometers of narrow alleys.

Chinese-made Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers,

fabric stores, gold stands. Boys with hand-trucks loaded

down with piles of fabric cut through the crowd. Older

Islamic architecture elbows up against neon signs and

rickety wooden stands with second-story balconies like

Bourbon Street.

Bob Anders walks toward the front.

You are the director?

Yes.

Is this film a foreign bride film?

I'm sorry?

A film where a foreign bride is

brought to Iran, but she dsn't

understand the language and

customs and there are

misunderstandings and laughs.

No.

Mendez walking toward the back of the group. Lee, the

cameraman, is looking through a viewfinder down the alley

of the bazaar.

Mike?

(not looking up)

Yeh.

If I said you were looking through

the wrong end of that viewfinder,

would I be right?

Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it

again.

Yep.

Mendez talking to Lee from a distance. A zoom, a closer

snapshot of LEE. Then of CORA LIJEK, who walks through

the bazaar with an open ARGO SCRIPT in her hand.

The Revolutionary Guard photographer is taking pictures

of each of the Houseguests, picking their portraits off

one by one like a sniper.

210 EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE (TEHRAN) - DAY 210

Two sedans turn onto the property and head up the

driveway.

Ali Khalkali, the revolutionary official, gets out of one

of the cars. He's joined by a couple other OFFICIALS and

by two armed REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS.

Sahar is moving through the garden, she sees the men

approach. She gs to greet them at the gate.

(Farsi, from behind

Yes?

212 INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 212

Reza leads Mendez and the Houseguests deeper into this

city within a city; fundamentalist ground zero. BAZAARIS

stand at their shop doors; puzzled; unfriendly; watching

the visitors.

Kathy Stafford, the production designer on the scout,

takes a Polaroid of a window adorned in gold. The

SHOPKEEPER, a 70-ish bazaari, sees her do so.

He hurries out of his store, speaking in rapid-fire Farsi

at her. The Houseguests stop. Reza speaks to the

Shopkeeper.

He wants the photograph you took.

She's the production designer.

Her job is to take photographs.

SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi.

He says he did not give you

permission to take a photograph of

his store.

Other BAZAARIS and SHOPPERS are starting to gather.

Kathy holds out the Polaroid toward the Shopkeeper.

He can have the photograph. Tell

The Shopkeeper knocks the Polaroid out of her hand.

213 INT./EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE - 213

The guests of the ambassador. How

long have they been in this house?

214 INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 214

People are now starting to surround Mendez and Reza and

the Houseguests. Bazaaris more and more heated. Women

in chadors are screaming and finger-pointing.

America NO!... NO!

Then he speaks in Farsi and makes shooting gestures with

his hand.

(quiet, to Mendez)

He's saying the Shah killed his

son with an American gun.

Cauldron heating up and --

215 INT./EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE - 215

ON Sahar -- her face impassive -- and then --

Two days. They arrived two days

ago.

Khalkali looks to the other Officials.

216 INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - ANGLE ON MORE AND MORE BAZAARIS - 216

A CROWD starts to gather around the group.

Her claustrophobia as the crowd closes in -- an ANGRY

BAZAARI WOMAN sticks her finger in Kathy's face --

(to one of the women)

Canada... Ca-na-da...

She's showing a Canadian flag, Bob Anders' lapel button --

(quiet; to Mendez)

He says we're the CIA taking

photographs to plan the bombing of

the city.

217 INT./EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE - 217

well.

Sister, those who are with him,

Rasool of Allah, we are tender

among ourselves.

But stern against the kuffar.

As god wills it.

But those who sit silently have

sinned.

Ds he know? Ds he not know? Is he trying to trick

her? His opacity makes it impossible to know. He holds

his look to her -- and she holds hers.

218 INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 218

219 INT./EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE - 219

-- and Sahar, so dignified and stony she is almost

shaming these men --

Everyone in this house is a friend

of Iran.

Khalkali makes his decision. He wordlessly turns to go.

220 INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 220

The CROWD heckles the Houseguests as they walk toward the

exit.

221 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - FOYER - DAY 221

Sahar calmly closes the door.

After she ds, she lets the facade go. All of a sudden

scared. Maybe she tears up. Either way, it's clear she

knows the stakes of the game she is playing.

222 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - AFTERNOON 222

The aftermath. The Houseguests, badly shaken, come

inside. Each dealing with shock and adrenaline.

Ken Taylor comes up next to Mendez and, for once,

Taylor's ambassadorial calm is breaking.

They drew you out there to take

your picture.

Nobody broke.

At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor,

holding Sahar's hand, both looking spooked as the

Houseguests come inside.

224A MONTAGE - EXT. TEHRAN - DUSK 224A

The call to prayer echoing as night falls in Tehran. In

an alley where cloaked women hurry past posters of

Khomeini. On a street where a five-year-old boy, in the

care of his eight-year-old brother, watches a pickup

truck of armed komiteh speed past.

224B INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT 224B

Mendez holds a passport and some papers in front of Bob

Anders' face. It feels late. The Houseguests are tired,

sweating, sitting around a dining room. Mendez, sleeves

rolled up, drilling them. The ARGO STORYBOARDS are

scattered around the room.

Where was your passport issued?

Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests.

Vancouver.

Where were you born?

Toronto.

Toronno like piranha. Canadians

don't pronounce the T.

Some border guard's gonna know

that?

If you're held for questioning,

they'll bring in somebody who

knows that.

(to Cora Lijek)

Last three Canadian prime

minsters.

Trudeau, Pearson, Diefenbaker.

224B CONTINUED: 224B

Associate Producer. What's the

name of the last film you worked

on?

Uh... High and Dry.

Who paid for the movie?

C.F.D.C.

What's your middle name?

J Stafford is silent. He looks down to consult the

paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls

the paper.

He's an American spy. Shoot him.

A beat on Stafford, frustrated --

They'll try to break you by

getting you agitated. You need to

know your rAsumA so well that you

don't flinch.

(nearly defeated,

You think your little story will

matter when there's guns to our

heads?

My story's the only thing between

you and the gun to your head.

A beat. Mendez puts the rAsumA back in front of

Stafford. Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't

good at this.

224B CONTINUED: (2) 224B

Let's go again.

224C INT. CIA - THE PIT - AFTERNOON 224C

O'Donnell, walking toward his office. It's the first

time today Malinov has seen him.

They made it through the location

scout.

O'Donnell ignores him. He gs straight to his office.

Looking like he's seen a ghost.

224D EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - VERANDA - NIGHT 224D

Mendez, finishing a cigarette outside. We might hear the

distant sound of a phone ringing.

Ken Taylor emerges. Waits a beat.

Kevin.

224E INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KEN TAYLOR'S 224E

OFFICE - CROSS-CUTTING - NIGHT

Mendez picks up the complicated-looking satellite phone

in Ken Taylor's home office. As soon as he ds --

Go to black on green.

Jack's calling him here, so he knows something's wrong.

What is it?

Go to black on green.

Mendez turns knobs on the satellite phone.

224F INT. O'DONNELL'S OFFICE - CROSS-CUTTING - AFTERNOON 224F

We see Jack is on a GREEN PHONE.

224F CONTINUED: 224F

It all just changed. They called

the game. You've got to come

back.

ON Mendez, not believing what he's hearing.

(quiet, fast, clear)

Joint Chiefs are planning a

military rescue of the hostages in

a month. Delta Force started

training to storm the grounds. So

if the six of them get brought

down there, they won't be held for

long.

I never would have exposed them if

I wasn't authorized to take them

out.

It's over, Tony.

They will be taken. Probably not

LISTEN TO ME. The thinking's

changed. Six Americans get pulled

out of a Canadian diplomat's house

and executed, it's another world

outrage. Six Americans get caught

playing movie make-believe with

the CIA at the airport and

executed, it's a national

embarrassment. They're calling

the operation.

We're responsible for those

people.

What we are is required to follow

orders. I'm sorry.

Mendez hangs up. O'Donnell sits listening to the dial

tone for a moment, then puts the phone on the receiver.

224F CONTINUED: (2) 224F

Then, very suddenly, he looks at an old coffee cup near

him and backhands it off his desk.

TIME CUT TO:

224G INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KEN TAYLOR'S 224G

OFFICE - NIGHT

Maybe only a minute, maybe ten or more have passed.

Mendez sits at Taylor's desk, numb. Cora Lijek knocks

but dsn't get a response. She tentatively opens the

door and sticks her head inside.

We're ready to try again.

(after a beat)

I think the most important thing

you can do to be ready for

tomorrow is rest.

TIME CUT TO:

225 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - 225

Now the mood among the Houseguests is lighter. Bob

Anders, a handful of liquor bottles in his arms, puts

them down on a table. Music plays on a record player.

Scorched earth policy tonight.

Nothing gets left.

Taylor comes in, drink in hand, thoughts heavy, looks at

Tony.

So you know.

ExtAff wants you to burn the

passports before you leave.

Mendez looks at the Houseguests, setting the table.

If we tell them, they'll panic.

It's better if you just don't

show.

It was always a fucked mission.

You came closer than anybody else.

Kathy and Cora are cracking each other up.

No one sees Mendez take a bottle of Macallan from the

table and put it in his bag.

226 INT. CAR - NIGHT 226

Mendez drives through nighttime Tehran, back to the

hotel.

There is a dangling TOTEM from the rearview mirror. It

reflects light.

He passes a VAN ON FIRE.

Ken Taylor watches in the hall.

233 INT. SHERATON ROOM - DAWN 233

Mendez -- who looks like he hasn't slept -- sits at a

table, looking out the window.

234 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAWN 234

Lee Schatz puts his Infant of Prague holy card into an

Argo script. Packs the script.

Cora Lijek is sitting next to her husband.

Kathy Stafford looks at the clock.

(to J Stafford)

He's late.

235 EXT. SHERATON BALCONY - DAWN 235

Tony comes out to the balcony with a hotel ice bucket in

one hand and the Canadian passports in the other. He

puts the passports in the bucket, LIGHTS A MATCH.

He looks down at the match, at the passports. The first

stirring of the morning calls-to-prayer echo in the

distance.

HOLD for a long beat ON Tony. Thinking.

Then, HE BLOWS OUT THE MATCH.

236 INT. O'DONNELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 236

O'Donnell is packing up for the night. Paper towels sit

on top of the coffee spill on his rug.

His phone rings. He picks up.

Yeah.

237 INT. SHERATON ROOM - DAWN 237

Somebody is responsible for things

when things happen, Jack. I am

responsible.

I'm taking them through.

And before Jack can answer, Tony hangs up. Stands. A

duffel bag over his shoulder, Tony turns out the light in

the hotel room. Gs.

238 INT. CIA (LANGLEY) - O'DONNELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 238

O'Donnell, thinking. Looking at the phone. Then, with a

sudden decision, he gets up.

Rushing out of his office, into --

239 INT. CIA - THE PIT - NIGHT 239

-- where he catches ALAN SOSA, 50s, head of the

Directorate of Support -- the CIA's chief financial

officer -- leaving for the night.

We need to confirm those seven

N.E. shut that down.

I'm saying it's back on!

I can't do it. It's backstopped

pending Executive Branch GO.

What the fuck ds that mean?

Carter's got to say yes for us to

get the tickets.

240 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAWN 240

Pat Taylor comes to answer an insistent knocking on her

front door. She opens it.

Pat. In the hall behind him: The Houseguests are

assembled, waiting to go. They look their parts -- or,

much more so than they did on the scout. Cora Lijek has

darker hair. The Staffords look on, fully dressed.

241 INT. OUTSIDE ENGELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 241

Where's Engell?

He's in a meeting.

Pull him out.

(as she hesitates)

PULL HIM OUT!

Pat Taylor is embracing the Houseguests, saying goodbye.

Sahar's on a bus.

Good. And you two leave right

now.

Ken Taylor nods. Mendez shakes his hand.

243 INT./EXT. MINIVAN - DAWN 243

Mendez gets into the driver's seat. Lee Schatz on the

PAKISTANI DRIVER.

Mendez pulls away.

Engell just stares O'Donnell down.

245 INT./EXT. MINIVAN - MORNING 245

The van speeds down the hills of the Shemiran district.

MENDEZ (V.O.)

The first checkpoint is just to

look at your passport.

246 FLASHBACK - INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT 246

Mendez is sitting in the living room instructing the

Houseguests.

Your passports came straight from

fine.

247 INT. CIA (LANGLEY) - THE PIT - NIGHT (A MOMENT LATER) 247

O'Donnell, charging in --

Where's the Director?

He gives out yellow immigration forms to the Houseguests.

The second is immigration. You'll

hand them these. They say you

landed two days ago.

Cora Lijek fingers her yellow immigration form in one

hand, holds Mark's hand with the other.

bothered to second-guess you.

Yes, it's Mr. Murphy calling from

Tony pulls the car to a semi-open place and tries not to

run anyone over.

the stairs again. This time, he's RUNNING.

KHALKALI, the fiery guy who came to the residence, along

with two YOUNG KOMITEH compare (one who delivered the

pictures): on one side, copies of re-assembled

diplomatic photographs of Americans from the embassy --

like the ones of the Houseguests we saw early in the film

-- and, on the other side, the candid photographs from

the bazaar.

another button.

My apologies. They just came

through.

She hits another button and tickets start to print.

260 INT. CIA - THE PIT - NIGHT 260

Swissair says they've picked up

We told them to shut that down!

He RUNS toward a phone --

261 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - FIRST CHECKPOINT - MORNING 261

The PASSPORT OFFICIAL is looking at the Canadian

passports of the six and waving them through. Mendez has

already passed. Everyone except Kathy Stafford.

The Passport Official looks at Kathy, who is doing her

best to look friendly and casual. Then he looks at

Kathy's passport, in which she looks stern and angry.

Kathy Stafford smoothes down her hair, frowns like she

ds in the passport photo. The Passport Official half

smiles and waves her through. They've all cleared the

first checkpoint.

262 INT. KOMITEH HQ - MORNING 262

Khalkali comes upon a diplomatic photograph of a man with

Bob Anders stands in front of a rough-voiced IMMIGRATION

OFFICER. He's holding Bob Anders' YELLOW IMMIGRATION

FORM and leafing through a file of hundreds of WHITE

IMMIGRATION FORMS, the duplicates. Without success.

(in Farsi; to Officer

#1, re: his own

Nothing.

When did you say you arrived in

Iran?

Two days ago.

What was the purpose of your

visit?

We were looking at locations to

make a film. I'm the director.

Immigration Officer pauses and looks up. Looks at the

six other faces. He looks every bit as confrontational

as Tony acted in rehearsal.

We have a letter from the Minister

of Culture ...

The Immigration Officer gestures for the letter. Bob

takes the letter inviting them on their location scout

out of a folder. Tony, barely perceptibly, nods.

266 INT. KOMITEH HQ - MORNING 266

Khalkali is now speaking with MORADI, an older Komiteh

official. They speak Farsi and it's untranslated, but we

get it. He is showing the photograph of Mark Lijek from

the bazaar and comparing it to the U.S. diplomatic

photograph.

Moradi picks up the phone as Khalkali heads out.

267 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - SECOND CHECKPOINT - MORNING 267

Immigration Officer is conferring with Immigration

Officer #2 as they look at the letter from the Minister

The phone in the office rings. No one is there.

Swissair announces general

272 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING 272

Mendez checks in with the Houseguests with his eyes.

They are now in sight of the airport gates. And here are

six Komiteh. Young men -- none more than 33 or so --

holding automatic weapons.

They have created their own checkpoint. It looks recent,

A SCREENED-OFF AREA WITH TABLES.

Passports.

He looks at the Canadian passports and then almost

immediately speaks.

You come.

He directs Mendez and the Houseguests into the screened-

off area. Speaks in Farsi to another Komiteh.

273 INT. CIA - THE PIT - NIGHT 273

Purser's telling Swissair they're

They should have boarded already.

Mark mimes turning the rotor of a movie camera. Komiteh

#1 dsn't understand.

AZIZI (O.S.)

Sit down.

A young man with a beard -- AZIZI, late 20s -- arriving

on the scene, speaking in Farsi to the others and then in

very good American English. He looks at the six and the

face he singles out is J Stafford's.

You. You had no business in Iran.

He motions for J STAFFORD to step forward. Mendez

shifts. A tense moment.

We did. We were preparing to make

a movie here, sir.

You don't have journalist visas.

Not a documentary. A movie.

J Stafford reaches into his pocket and gives Azizi a

copy of the Argo Variety ad.

You see?

(to Mendez; English)

Kevin, where's your briefcase?

A beat on Mendez. Who then opens his accordion folder

and takes from it the ARGO STORYBOARDS. J Stafford

spreads them out on the table.

Three other Komiteh in the room lean forward, their

AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at their sides, and look at the

STORYBOARD DRAWINGS. The Persian Empire futurism of Jack

Kirby's drawings.

These are the villains. Y'see

these guys here? And these are

the hers... in the spice

market...

J Stafford points at the various drawings. He speaks

with an ease and confidence that we didn't know he had.

They know our hero is the Chosen

One, so they kidnap his son in the

spice market ... They have these

chariots... like this one...

Mendez watches. It's a performance. The three young

Komiteh are now wide-eyed, pointing, whispering in Farsi,

like teenagers around a comic book.

Azizi says something to another Komiteh in the room.

(to J Stafford; in

You don't go until we verify.

You can call our office.

Mendez hands Azizi his card. STUDIO SIX FILMS. Kevin

Harkins. A 213 (818 wasn't around yet) phone number.

young Komiteh barely look up from the drawings --

277 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - KOMITEH STATION - MORNING 277

Azizi, who apparently has some authority here, enters,

telling another Komiteh in Farsi to get off the phone.

Azizi looks at the Studio Six business card and picks up

the receiver.

278 EXT. WARNER BROS. STUDIOS - NIGHT 278

I'm sorry, pally. We're just gonna

be in the movie. Call my agent.

Sir. SIR!

Siegel and Chambers walk through the shot toward the Argo

279 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - KOMITEH STATION - MORNING 279

Azizi dials the long international number. And it is a

DIAL, so this takes a long time.

280 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING 280

One of the young Komiteh is loudly debating with another

Komiteh the air-worthiness of a futuristic desert glider

in the storyboards. He's miming the thing crashing.

J Stafford and the Houseguests are silent. Mendez can

see the line of passengers on their Swissair flight

dwindling.

288 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING 288

Azizi comes back into the screened-off area. Looks at

J Stafford, then at Mendez. Then says something in

Farsi to the three Komiteh in the holding area. Then he

leaves.

The three young Komiteh look at the drawings, then at J

Stafford. Silence for a moment.

Our gift to you. From our film.

Komiteh #1, who speaks enough English to understand,

translates to the others. They forget their

revolutionary mission for a second, happy with their

gift. They'd high-five if they could. They're kids.

Komiteh #1 motions for the Houseguests to go.

289 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - FOYER - MORNING 289

Khalkali and a dozen Komiteh, guns drawn, rush into the

looks like breakfast for a group of people.

But the place is empty.

A BUSLOAD of passengers about to be ferried to the

295 INT. RUNWAY TRANSPORT BUS - MORNING 295

The Houseguests sit aboard the bus, headed to a waiting

detached seatbelt preparing to do her safety mime.

PILOT (V.O.)

Ladies and gentlemen, from the

flight-deck. We're looking at a

brief delay --

Passengers groan a bit as they read paperbacks or

International Herald Tribunes. Mark Lijek's arm is

around Cora. Lee Schatz is moving his mouth in what

looks like a prayer. Kathy Stafford's fingers shake as

she holds an arm rest. J Stafford tries to stay her

hand.

Mendez is sitting looking out the window toward the

terminal.

He reaches the METAL BARS outside and can't get past.

He CALLS INTO THE WALKIE.

The Houseguests -- holding their breath --

Mendez -- looking out the window -- scanning the air

around the plane -- behind every cloud --

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.)

Ladies and gentlemen, it is our

pleasure to announce that

alcoholic beverages are now

available, as we have cleared

Iranian airspace.

The Houseguests shout and embrace and celebrate. Bob

Anders high-fives Lee Schatz, then the other Houseguests.

Mark Lijek, crying, embraces Cora.

Kathy Stafford is laughing. She kisses her husband's

hand.

Some of the other passengers look up from their

newspapers, annoyed at this Canadian fuss.

319 INT. CIA (LANGLEY) - THE PIT - NIGHT 319

Siegel throws down a phone and rushes outside... to where

Chambers smokes.

OUUUT! THEY'RE OUT!

them.

321 INT. SWISSAIR DC-10 - MORNING 321

A mini-champagne bottle pops. The Houseguests are

celebrating: New Year's Eve and a Super Bowl victory

party in a DC-10 aisle.

FIND Mendez, sitting alone, apart from the celebration.

Looking out the window. Mendez turns to see that someone

is standing in the aisle next to him. J Stafford.

Tony looks up at J.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)

I'm sorry, sir. You need to sit

down.

But J dsn't pay attention to the Flight Attendant.

J gs back to his seat.

HOLD ON Tony Mendez.

We are the good guys!

Six down, fifty to go. Call the Times, nail it to

the fucking door. The CIA

are the good guys.

The Canadians are the good guys.

-- we're not greedy -- them too --

Only. Canada takes the credit, or

they'll retaliate against the

hostages. Great Satan wasn't

involved. No CIA.

Is that right, Jack?

Involved in what? We're as

surprised as anybody. Thank you,

Canada.

Jack raises a glass of Scotch and takes a drink.

( Homecoming ceremony for Houseguests 2/1980.) Hundreds

are gathered to welcome the six back.

TED KOPPEL (V.O.)

walked away.

Camera flashes, wild cheers. Banners: WELCOME HOME

CORA AND MARK! IDAHO LOVES YOU, LEE! WELCOME HOME,

BOB ANDERS! It's the first moment of national

celebration since the beginning of the crisis.

IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SADEQ GHOTBZADEH speaks angrily

into a microphone.

SADEQ GHOTBZADEH (V.O.)

Sooner or later, here or anywhere

in the world, Canada will pay for

this violation of the sovereignty

of Iran. ( News conference

328 MORE ARCHIVE FOOTAGE ( 1/30/1980) 328

330 EXT. BY LESTER'S POOL - DAY 330

Siegel in a bathrobe, looking out over L.A., holding

The New York Times in front of him: SIX U.S. DIPLOMATS,

HIDDEN BY CANADA, LEAVE IRAN SAFELY. Next to that, an

article about Ken Taylor: DIPLOMAT DIRECTED ESCAPE IN

IRAN. (Front page, NYT 1/30/80.)

She said,  Why couldn't we pull

off something like that?' You

Wha'd you say to her?

332 EXT. BY LESTER'S POOL - DAY 332

I said,  Argo fuck yourself.'

333 INT. CIA ARCHIVES - DAY 333

And suddenly it's dead-quiet. We're in a vault inside a

vault in the basement of the main building.

Mendez's suitcase is laying on a low counter, an ARCHIVES

OFFICER t-tagging and cataloging various items.

Separating Mendez's personal things from material related

to the operation.

Mendez empties his briefcase and the officer puts a

sticker on the VARIETY featuring the ARGO ad. Another on

the ARGO script. He's putting things into a box that

reads: USCIA CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.

Mendez opens his accordion folder -- flips through it --

it's empty -- no. There's something inside.

In one of the compartments is a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO.

One that the Komiteh missed. While the Archives Officer

is turned around, Mendez slips the storyboard back into

the accordion folder and puts it back with his personal

things.

334 EXT. CIA - FRONT PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 334

He wants to fire me himself.

He wants to give you the

Intelligence Star. You're getting

the highest award of merit of the

Clandestine Services of these

United States. Ceremony's two

weeks from today.

Mendez stops walking. A beat.

If they push it a week, I can

bring Ian. That's his winter

break.

The op was classified so the

ceremony's classified. He can't

know about it. Nobody can know

about it.

They're gonna hand me an award,

then they're gonna take it back?

If we wanted applause, we would

have joined the circus.

I thought we did.

O'Donnell claps Tony on the shoulder. Tony walks towards

the entrance and Jack heads to his car.

(yelling to Tony; an

Carter said you were a great

American.

A great American what?

He didn't say.

335 INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - ANGLE ON A POSTER - DAY 335

What happened to your picture?

It's in turnaround.

He turns out the lights.

336 EXT. ROAD UP TO CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 336

Mendez's car heads up the road, past a mailbox. Pulls up

to the house.

337 EXT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 337

Mendez, a duffel bag on his shoulder, knocks on the door.

He waits. After a moment, Christine opens the door.

Hi.

Hi.

They look at each other.

Before she can speak, he's embraced her. Holds tight.

It's something in between romantic and fraternal. Not

reconciliation, necessarily, but warmth. She

reciprocates. It feels right, and good.

WIDEN to HOLD ON them holding each other in the dark hall

of the very American, even Hummel-kitschy house. HOLD

there for a while.

338 INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - IAN'S BEDROOM - ANGLE ON TV - 338

A scene of the Old West on a television.

Ian is watching 1973's sci-fi Western Westworld in the

We can hear the sounds of gunslinging from the movie.

Glow-in-the-dark stars on the wall. A Star Wars X-Wing

that look like they've been chewed by a dog.

CARD #4: ALL OF THE HOUSEGUESTS RETURNED TO THE U.S.

FOREIGN SERVICE AFTER THEIR ORDEAL IN IRAN.

Then FIND, almost unnoticeable among Ian's science

fiction collection, a piece of cardboard behind Captain

Kirk and Han Solo figures.

It's a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO. The one missed by the

Komiteh at the airport.

STAR UNTIL 1997, WHEN THE ARGO OPERATION WAS DECLASSIFIED

BY PRESIDENT CLINTON.

LINGER ON the ARGO STORYBOARD. A MAN in a futuristic

chariot sheltering a KID from what look like laser beams.
