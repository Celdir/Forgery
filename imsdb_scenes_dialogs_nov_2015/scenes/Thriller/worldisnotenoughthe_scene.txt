(BOND 19)

--------------------------------------------------------------

GUN BARREL LOGO OPENS ON

GENEVA SWITZERLAND, an unnaturally clean city that melds old

Europe with new money of both dubious and legitimate source.

INT. HALLWAY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

An engraved brass plaque announcing the name of the "private

banking institute" within.

INT. PENTHOUSE BANK OFFICE - GENEVA - DAY

JAMES BOND, dressed impeccably as ever, is being FRISKED by

three THUGS in Armani suits.  They remove A GUN from inside

his jacket, a well-concealed knife, a metal case, laying them

on the desk that separates Bond and...

LACHAISE...an extremely well-groomed gentleman. Behind him,

three floor-to-ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden.

Lachaise takes the joke a little tight-lipped.  Gestures for

Bond to sit.

A GIRL ENTERS, a gorgeous Swiss bombshell in a pin-striped

suit.  She pushes a cart. On it are a BRIEFCASE and a box of

EXPENSIVE CIGARS, which she offers to Lachaise and Bond.

The efficient Cigar Girl brings the briefcase to Bond,

setting it in his lap and opening it up...inside is a good

deal of CASH in pound sterling.

The CIGAR GIRL offers Bond a RECEIPT...

She steps back. Bond reaches for the metal case on the

desk...the THUGS TENSE...

Lachaise nods.  Bond can have his glasses.

He puts them on, gives a cursory look at the receipt...an odd

number in pound sterling, calculated down to the penny:

3,030,303.03.

Bond folds the receipt, slips it into his WALLET...then, he

removes the glasses, slowly, deliberately, eyeing Lachaise.

He takes a photo from his jacket and lays it on the desk.

He nods.  An Armani thug steps up and takes out a gun...

Bond's mouth edges into a smile.  A flicker of doubt on

Lachaise's face -- as Bond's finger finds a protrusion on the

tiny arm of his glasses and...

KABOOM!  The pistol on the table FLASHES...blinding those

around, they cover their eyes, stagger back...it is a brief

effect, just enough to disorient the thugs and give Bond his

opening...

He KARATE-CHOPS HENCHMAN #1 unconscious, taking his gun.

Kicks HENCHMEN #2 in the face and throws #3 OUT THE WINDOW

just as they're getting their bearings.  Now he nestles the

barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of Lachaise's

cheek.

And he freezes.  The handle of a THROWING KNIFE is sticking

out of his neck.  Bond looks up, catches sight of the CIGAR

GIRL as she vaults out the broken window and onto THE ROOF.

Bond rushes to the window...

EXT. VERANDAH - ROOFS - GENEVA - DAY

She swings on a WIRE across to another roof, quickly

disappearing into shadows.

Bond can hear sirens approaching. He returns to...

THE OFFICE...he grabs the money and moves fast for the door,

casually slipping that cigar into his pocket...

Except Henchman #1 has recovered, blocks his way, gun in

hand.  He starts to squeeze the trigger -- when a RED DOT

appears on his chest...another window SHATTERS as a bullet

zings through and pierces the henchman in the heart.

Bond looks back once at the shattered window, then heads out.

INT. BANK - GENEVA - DAY

Bond appears on the top floor of the grand old building, by

the elevator.  Looks over the balcony, sees figures on the

stairs.  Hears the elevator cage start from below.

Thinking fast, he wrenches open the steel gate, leans into

the lift shaft, watches the elevator COUNTERWEIGHT as it

comes down.  Almost nonchalant, he steps out...

INT. STAIRWELL/ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY

As the cageful of police rises, Bond is now standing on the

counterweight, DESCENDING.

EXT. STREET - GENEVA

Lunchtime.  Faceless business crowds heading for their brief

moment of freedom, among them we spot BOND...one of them,

with a briefcase and a suit and tie...HOLD on his face,

troubled.

INT. HOTEL - GENEVA - DAY

The Cigar Girl enters a huge, high-ceilinged room. Edgy, she

approaches a BIG MAN standing on a balcony overlooking the

city.  Propped against the doorframe, an assassin's RIFLE

with LASER-SIGHT attached. BINOCULARS are on a tripod,

trained on the rooftop below where we can see cops examining

the shattered office windows.

The man turns. Powerful, deadly, with a military haircut.

There is a raised, red scar of an ENTRY WOUND at his temple.

It throbs and shifts with the slightest facial expression,

like an insect living just beneath his skin. One EYE seems

slightly drooping, deadened. The other eye is sharp and black

as anthracite.  It is a frightening face. This is RENARD.

He touches her cheek and moves into the room, pouring two

glasses of wine.

EXT. RIVER THAMES - LONDON - DAY

A SEAPLANE swoops over the Millennium Dome, banks along the

snaking river.

EXT. MI-6 - LONDON - DAY

Tate Gallery in background, the seaplane moors beneath the

vast stepped cake that is MI-6.  Bond exits with the

suitcase.

INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - DAY

CAMERA MOVES with Bond as he enters this secret, hi-tech

world.  He passes through countless security procedures,

watched by an attentive staff.

Bond scoops the money out of the suitcase.  Three million

sterling in tightly bundled hundreds makes quite a sight.  He

flicks his finger through the last wad, tosses it down

wistfully.  A blue light scans it on three axis.

The money is bundled into a clear plastic bag, put on a tray

and wheeled through a series of barred enclosures into the

SECURE ROOM.  Bond hands the suitcase to a STAFF MEMBER.

INT. MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY

Bond appears, hiding something behind his back.  Moneypenny

brightens.

He produces the cigar, now in a large phallic TUBE.  Stands

it end up on the desk.

INT. M'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY

Bond enters.  SIR ROBERT KING is perched on the edge of M's

desk.  Two glasses, a bottle of scotch open.

King moves toward Bond with an easy, patrician smile. Bond

notes a TINY BADGE in his lapel -- like the glass eye of a

stuffed snake.

King looks to M, smiling.

She couldn't resist. King smiles at Bond.  As he goes, he

gives M a respectful kiss on the cheek. The door closes.  M

turns.

M picks up the report from her desk.  Bond notices it is in

Russian, with a SEAL from a Russian military agency in the

corner: MIRATOM.

She pours a scotch for Bond.  He drops some ice in,

thoughtful.

He stops, rubs his thumb and forefinger together -- a strange

SIZZLING where he touched the ice.  Realization sinks in.

M sees the seriousness in his eyes -- stabs at the intercom:

INT. MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

Moneypenny's eyes shoot to the intercom console:

INT. CORRIDORS, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

Sir Robert King and an MI-6 AIDE walk toward SECURITY.

INT. Q DIVISION, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

Q and his men are working on a strange half-built BOAT

suspended over a water tank.

He looks up as Bond runs through...

INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

THE MONEY lies on the tray, wrapped in plastic.

Sir Robert approaches, two rows of security bars between him

and the cash.  An official produces a bag and moves toward

it:

INT. LOWER CORRIDORS/SECURITY AREA, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

Bond shoots around the corner just in time to see Sir Robert

disappearing past the THICK STEEL DOOR of the secure room.

INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

The shout is muffled, Sir Robert's more interested in the

money.

He continues toward camera, that PIN on his lapel emits a

serene HUM and we

CLOSE ON THE METAL STRIP IN ONE NOTE AS IT CRACKLES AND --

KABOOM!  A MASSIVE EXPLOSION.

INT. LOWER CORRIDORS/SECURITY AREA, MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

MAYHEM.  FIRE blasts out of the open doorway just as Bond

reaches it.  The STEEL DOOR flies toward him.  He dives --

EXT. MI-6/RIVER - CONTINUOUS

The building rocks.  SMOKE is pouring from a HOLE that's

appeared in a lower tier. A wall and a section of roof gone.

EXT. MI-6/RIVER - CONTINUOUS

A figure staggers out, shaken.  Catching his breath.  BOND.

ECU CIGAR GIRL

Lining up Bond with her infra-red telescopic sight.

ANGLE ON BOND

In the swirling dust and smoke, he suddenly sees a wand of

red light, pointing at his chest.

All instinct, he dives for cover.  Powerful, high velocity

bullet hits blanket the area.  Bond prepares to return fire,

scanning around for the source. Through the debris he spots

an unusual, hi-tech BOAT on the river -- long and narrow and

low.  A figure on board.  THE CIGAR GIRL.

ANGLE ON CIGAR GIRL

She FIRES OFF A ROUND OF SHOTS, forcing Bond back into cover.

Then she guns the engines and SPEEDS OFF down the Thames.

EXT. MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

Determined, Bond races back into the wreckage...

INT. MI-6 - CONTINUOUS

Bond races through the chaos that is MI-6 and into...

Q DIVISION

Where he leaps into the prototype BOAT.  Q protests...

Bond looks at the mystifying number of buttons and gadgets

...presses something red and...THE BOAT LEAPS OUT, ENGINE

ROARING...

EXT. SLIPWAY - RIVER - DAY

THE 007 THEME KICKS IN AS:

JAMES BOND, in the Q boat, SHOOTS OUT of the MI-6 rubble and

onto the Thames.

EXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY

Bond can see the Cigar Girl up ahead...he is closing the

distance.  She catches sight of him in pursuit...

EXT. CIGAR GIRL - BOAT - DAY

She pushes the boat to its limit, it roars to a new level of

speed...the chase is on.

EXT. THAMES - DAY

Police speedboats, alerted by the commotion, trail Bond.

ON THE EMBANKMENT

Police cars scream alongside, sirens wailing.

ON THE THAMES

Bond is losing ground as he and the Cigar Girl weave through

traffic on the Thames. In a gutsy bid to keep pace, he

corrals the Q boat into a hair-raising SHORT-CUT, shooting

off...

UNDERNEATH A PIER

He maneuvers the boat under the low pier and emerges EVEN

CLOSER to his prey...

EXT. CIGAR GIRL - BOAT - DAY

The Cigar Girl stops her boat, moving to the back, manning

her large, rear-mountain MACHINE GUN and taking aim at

Bond...

EXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY

Bond continues at full speed, fearless in the hail of bullets

ricocheting off the vessel.

THE CIGAR GIRL Remains calm and cool, shooting with

precision.

BOND closes in...

CIGAR GIRL'S eyes widen as...

BOND STEERS HIS BOAT RIGHT OVER THE MACHINE GUN AND TURRET...

Cigar Girl dives out of the way, as her boat becomes a RAMP,

LAUNCHING the Q boat INTO THE AIR before it dives, nose-

first, into the Thames.

EXT. - CIGAR GIRL BOAT - CONTINUOUS

CIGAR GIRL gets up from the deck and sees BOND, turning his

boat to close in for the kill...

She scrambles to the helm and SPEEDS OFF, seeing ahead of

her...

TOWER BRIDGE

Just beginning to open, to allow for passage of a small

tanker.

EXT. CIGAR GIRL BOAT

She streaks toward the bridge, Bond lagging behind...

ON BOND

As he looses her boat in the distance, he makes a DESPERATE

MOVE...he cranks the wheel of his boat and veers off, UP A

SLIPWAY and into...

EXT. FISH MARKET

Where the boat hydroplanes on masses of surface water and

propels him into

EXT. LONDON STREET

The hurtling boat causes mayhem and panic as he wrestles with

the controls, jetting off the street and straight toward...

EXT. RIVERSIDE RESTAURANT

Bond's boat crashes right through it, sending diners LEAPING

in every direction. The Q boat SHOOTS OUT over the balcony

and splashes down once more into...

EXT. THAMES - DAY

Cigar Girl is now clearly in his sights.  She is amazed to

see that Bond has managed to overtake her.

The racing boats dice through an armada of lazy, over-loaded

BARGES, nearly crashing into the much larger vessels.

AT EVEN PACE NOW...Cigar Girl attempts to force her way past

him, but Bond, punching buttons on the console of the Q-boat,

releases a set of catapulting FLAME CANNISTERS which create a

massive WALL OF FIRE ahead of them...

CIGAR GIRL is forced toward the very edge of the river...the

jig is almost up, and then...

HER P.O.V.  She spots the launching of a HOT AIR BALLOON from

the base of the massive MILLENNIUM DOME.

She skids her vessel to a stop at a nearby pier and quickly

scrambles out of her boat.

EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME - DAY

...A crowd around a RICHARD BRANSON-like figure about to

climb into his HOT AIR BALLOON.

The Cigar Girl, brandishing her gun, forces her way through

the crowd and LEAPS INTO THE BALLOON CARRIAGE, just ready to

lift off.  She cranks open the gas nozzles and the balloon

rises with surprising speed.

EXT. BOND'S BOAT - DAY

Bond steers his craft toward a slipway adjacent to the pier

and SHOOTS UP INTO THE AIR...

EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME

An amazing sight...Bond's boat sailing through the air just

beneath the balloon.  With split second precision he reaches

up and GRABS ONE OF THE ROPES dangling down from the balloon.

Bond finds himself being CARRIED THROUGH THE AIR as his boat

falls away from him, hitting the ground and ERUPTING into a

ball of flame.

EXT. HOT AIR BALLOON - CONTINUOUS

As Bond is carried higher and higher, the Cigar Girl begins

FIRING AT HIM over the edge of the carriage.

Bond, with ONE HAND, returns fire.

CIGAR GIRL then leans over the edge of the carriage and

begins to SLICE THE ROPE that Bond is hanging from.

The fibers split and fray away from each other as...

BOND FALLS, heading straight toward...

THE MILLENNIUM DOME, which the balloon has drifted over.

AS HE PLUMMETS DOWNWARD...Bond, never surrendering, still

FIRES HIS WEAPON up at the balloon. A bullet hits the gas

tank...

EXT. BALLOON - DAY

The BALLOON EXPLODES IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL taking the Cigar

Girl with it...

EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME - DAY

Bond lands with a spectacular thudding bounce, the roof of

the Millennium Dome breaking his fall.

EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME ROOF - DAY

He slides uncontrollably down the slope of the Dome as scraps

of burning balloon rain down all around, before he FALLS OFF

THE EDGE of the Dome and lands with a THUD ON...

THE GROUND BELOW

He struggles up, wincing in SEARING PAIN as his hand goes to

his INJURED SHOULDER. He hold it, and looks up, into the sky

as we zero in on the iris of...

HIS EYE

reflecting the massive smoke cloud from the explosion as the

screen transforms into...

THE MAIN TITLES

EXT. COUNTRY ESTATE, LOCH LOMOND - DAY

BAGPIPES.  A chapel atop a green slope overlooking the waters

of Loch Lomond.

A long line of mourners files out at the end of a memorial

service.  They mill about on the lawn, among them,  M, grim-

faced, BILL TANNER, CHIEF OF STAFF and JAMES BOND, his arm in

a black sling.

Bond, ever vigilant, scans the crowd...

HIS P.O.V.  It's like a state funeral.  Rich and powerful

people, government ministers, chief executives from around

the world...and then...

FAR OFF, on a DISTANT RISE, he sees a BIG MAN, not one of the

mourners but an isolated observer, standing alone, wearing

sunglasses and a military haircut.

The man seems to see Bond looking at him...

Bond looks at her for a brief second...when he turns back,

the man is gone, like an APPARITION.

Bond walks off, up the grassy slope, toward the rise.

THE VIEW ACROSS THE VALLEY

Bond stands on the hill, looking below.  He sees nothing but

a green carpet, not a tree to hide behind.

He hears a crunch of leaves...turns...

HIS P.O.V.  A WOMAN, in mourning black, coming up the hill.

Her china doll face is both fragile and proud.

She steps up to the ridge with him.  A breeze blows her hair.

They stare out. The sun's rays have broken the clouds and

strafe the valley.

The sun glints off her bejewelled earlobe.

A voice interrupts them, calling from the estate...

She walks away, the wind pressing her dress against her

delicate figure.  She looks brave and vulnerable as she walks

back toward her father's grand house.

INT. LIMOUSINE - TRAVELING - DAY

M, Bond and Tanner in the rear of a limousine. The vehicle

swoops through the epic countryside of the Scottish

Highlands.

M looks at Bond. Eyes his sling.

Bond gives her a look.

EXT. CASTLE THANE - HIGHLANDS - DAY

The limousine swoops under the portcullis, into a courtyard.

ADJUST ANGLE to reveal huge antennae and satellite dishes

within.

SUPER:  MI-6 REMOTE OPERATIONS CENTRE, SCOTLAND

EXT. CORRIDOR - CASTLE THANE - CONTINUOUS

Bond walks through the corridors.  Just before he enters the

medical room, he removes his sling and casually drapes it on

a suit of armor.

INT. MEDICAL ROOM - CASTLE THANE - DAY

Bond sits on the couch, shirt off, awaits the results of his

medical.

The very attractive DOCTOR GREATREX looks at her notes.

She moves to him, touches the scarred and bruised bone.

His hand comes up, rests on her waist.

And he pulls down the zip on her skirt.  Flicks the clasp and

it drops to the floor.  She shakes her head -- as he starts

undoing the buttons on her shirt.  She's very business-like,

despite what's happening.

And he pulls her toward him, they kiss.

Her shirt drops to the floor.  She pushes him back, lies on

him.  Just wearing knickers now.  Between kisses:

INT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ)- LATER

A huge chandelier dominates the vast stone room. SEVERAL

AGENTS listen to the debriefing.  ROBINSON and M watch TANNER

explain things; he holds a FIFTY POUND NOTE and KING'S LAPEL

PIN (now blackened, fused, melted to expose electronics

beneath).

ANGLE

on BOND as he enters the room.  He hangs back in the shadows,

watches Tanner mime the pin moving to the note:

M steps forward.  Her fury controlled.

Suddenly the chandelier darkens, the floor brightens into a

VAST SCREEN, showing a satellite image of Central Asia and

the Mediterranean.  M and Robinson walk onto the screen.

She causes the desired stir.  Bond steps forward from the

shadows to get a better view.  M sees the sling has gone.

Tanner notices a RED LIGHT start pulsing.  He moves to M:

M nods grimly.  As Robinson distributes sealed envelopes:

They open their envelopes, but Bond received nothing.

She leaves.  Bond is brooding.

INT. RESEARCH ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - NIGHT

An ancient nook chock full of hi-tech equipment.  Bond

concentrates on a screen displaying PHOTOGRAPHS, NEWSPAPER

AND TELEVISION CLIPS -- all to do with King's life and times.

Bond touches the screen on a photo of...ELEKTRA.

INT. SCREEN

One story dominates -- the KIDNAPPING OF ELEKTRA KING. A

Polaroid of Elektra savagely beaten, ear bandaged, holding a

newspaper: beneath the photo is scrawled "$5,000,000."

POLICE VIDEO: Elektra interviewed; bruised, emotional.

Bond touches Elektra's face, freezing her tears.

His eyes wander to the photo with the ransom demand:

$5,000,000.  A thought forms.  He takes out his wallet,

opening it and removing:

THE RECEIPT FROM LACHAISE.

E.C.U. The strange figure, in pounds: 3,030,303.03.

Bond taps some keys. The words EXCHANGE RATE appear on the

screen...pounds to dollars.

He enters '3,030,303.03 POUNDS STERLING' and through

multiplication by the exchange rate this becomes:

INT. PASSAGEWAY - CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - DUSK

Bond paces the flagstones, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - CONTINUOUS

Bond opens the door on M who stands alone by the window,

looking out at the long shadows on the moors.

She turns, her brow furrowing.

He hands her a slip of paper.

M looks at the paper, a long time.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ)- NIGHT

A HUGE, TRANSPARENT 3-D IMAGE OF RENARD'S SKULL floats in the

centre of the room.  Other images of him on wall screens.

She turns to the hologram.

Bond moves toward the ghostly Renard. We now see THE BULLET

INSIDE HIS SKULL.

She presses a button, the hologram turns...

MONEYPENNY ENTERS with a file, which she hands to M.

M looks over the file: his medical report.

Moneypenny disappears out the door. M is all business.

They exchange a look. A look of recognition between two

professionals, who know the terrible price of what they do.

INT. Q'S LAB - NIGHT

A Scot in a kilt plays the bagpipes -- badly.  He spins

round, drops the pipe from his mouth, simultaneously fires

bullets from one pipe and a jet of flame from another.  The

target is a realistic dummy -- now a molten, bullet-ridden

mess.

We're in Q's laboratory.  He's walking Bond through.

In the background, we see a man in a sleek black jacket. The

man PULLS A STRING...the jacket becomes AN AIRBAG...it

envelopes him, he gets impossibly tangled in it.

Q ignores it, handing Bond a new pair of GLASSES.

He presses a button and a section of ceiling lowers to reveal

a BMW Z7.

A MAN in a white coat is loading A MISSILE into one of the

headlamps, then steps off the platform.  Q gestures to him.

"R" pats the fender, he's pretty damned fond of his machine.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

A hot day. CAMERA soars over tall trees. We can just make out

the sleek muscular car, beetle-black and far below, bouncing

over rough terrain.  Bond "taking care" of his new BMW Z7.

INT. BOND'S CAR - NR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

We join Bond at the wheel, driving hard, loving it, pushing

up extreme inclines, smashing through overhanging limbs.

EXT. PERIMETER FENCE, CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS

MOUNTAINS - DAY

Bond reaches a PERIMETER FENCE, manned by a GUARD.  The guard

examines Bond's PASS and waves him through.

EXT. AIRSTRIP AREA NEAR CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS

MOUNTAINS - DAY (OLD SC. 69)

As Bond drives on he passes an area where HELICOPTERS

trailing GIANT SAWS are trimming back trees.  Felled trees

are being dragged away, being replaced by huge metal sheets.

An incredibly fast and well-oiled operation -- but why?

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

Bond pulls up at the CONSTRUCTION SITE, teeming with ultra-

modern robotic construction machines and vehicles.

He gets out, and is immediately surrounded by men with guns.

A man in a suit steps forward.  DAVIDOV is tall, blonde, with

a dangerous charm Bond instantly recognizes as ex-KGB.

He turns Bond around, hands on the car.  Pats him down.

Pulls out an ID, checks it:

Bond stares ahead, watches a PRIVATE JET swoops past...

OMITTED

EXT. AIRSTRIP AREA NEAR CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS

MOUNTAINS - DAY

The jet lands on a runway of the metal sheets Bond saw being

laid as he passed...

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY

Davidov pulls out Bond's gun.

Davidov ignores him, looking the gun over.

Bond turns to watch a LIFTING HELICOPTER swoop in and drop

down an air-conditioned office.  Military precision.

Davidov's radio crackles out a message and he tosses the gun

back to Bond.  They start walking:

Bond eyes him, but is distracted by a jet coming to a halt

ahead of them.

Stairs swing down and out steps ELEKTRA KING.  Beautiful,

elegant.  So out of place in this world of men.  She surveys

the worksite.

Impressed, Bond takes his ID back from Davidov.

INT. OFFICE, CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

Bond and Davidov step into a fully functioning office.

Everything Elektra requires is here. Computer, phones, drinks

cabinet. She is in the middle of a group of workmen and

secretaries, looking at plans, talking, pouring herself a cup

of coffee.

She looks up...a brief moment of RECOGNITION...then back to

business.

She signs some documents and the men file out. She gets up,

turning her back to Bond, hands on her hips.

Davidov nods and leaves. Elektra still keeps her back turned,

but he can see her physically change, her shoulders sag, her

arms cross in front of her. When she finds her voice, it has

a gravelly sound of emotion.

Her muscleman BODY GUARD appears, says briefly:

Gabor glares at Bond before he leaves.

Bond takes something out of his pocket, he opens his palm,

shows it to her.

She swallows back emotion. Looks in his eyes, with a sad half-

smile that unsettles him.

She starts to walk out.  He follows her...

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

EXT. JEEP, TRAVELING - OILFIELDS - DAY

Elektra drives the all-terrain jeep with casual assurance.

Bond is beside her, cold-weather gear in the back.  They're

following a huge pipeline, passing a blighted petrified

forest of twisted iron:  derelict oil derricks.

Elektra gestures at the oil fields they're now leaving

behind.  Receding into the distance, a DELTA OF ROADWAYS

perched on rusting stilts juts out into the sea.

OMITTED 75-

EXT. POV FROM HELICOPTER - DAY

Bond and Elektra travel beside the vast pipe through

dramatic, beautiful, scenery...

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Davidov and Gabor, in the helicopter, watch the jeep below.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION CAMP, FOOTHILLS OF THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS

(CAPPADOCIA, THE VILLAGE OF ZELVE) - DAY

The jeep reaches a break in the pipe: a SURVEY CAMP, flags,

strings.  The SURVEY CREW cower behind a 4WD, local tribesman

are stoning them from a village carved into the rock.  A lot

of SHOUTING.

Before Bond can stop her, Elektra gets out, moves toward the

tribesmen.  The stoning ceases. They know who she is.  She

begins to speak quietly -- in their own tongue.

INT. CHAPEL, ZELVE - DAY

A stunning pre-Byzantine chapel hewn from the rock.  Flames

illuminate beautiful mosaics and paintings on the cavern

wall.  A COPTIC PRIEST proudly shows Elektra about, jabbering

in his mother tongue.  She answers in his language.

Bond watches her, impressed.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION CAMP - DISTORTED ELECTRONIC POV, FROM

ABOVE:

We hear the click of high-powered electronic binoculars,

zeroing in on Bond and Elektra as they return to the survey

team.  This can't be Davidov's view, as the helicopter has

settled down below.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION CAMP, FOOTHILLS OF MOUNTAINS - DAY

Bond is edgy.  Someone is out there.  He's sure of it.  He

sees Davidov and Gabor scanning the area as well.  Elektra

speaks to the foreman.

The first time Elektra has asserted her own authority. The

foreman is surprised, angry. But he doesn't question her.

She moves toward the helicopter, says to Bond:

She shrugs, mischief in her eyes.

Bond just smiles.

INT/EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY

The chopper swoops over SNOWY WASTES.  It reaches a mountain

peak, hovers.  The wind is strong, buffeting.

Elektra and Bond are both now in ski suits, Bond wearing a

sleek black jacket.

She steps into her skis, opens the door.  Wind rushes in.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

Without a moment's hesitation, Elektra leaps out of the

chopper and falls fifteen feet, landing on the move.

INT/EXT.  HELICOPTER - DAY

Unbelieving, Bond quickly dons skis and leaps after her.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

Below him on the mountain, she is already a way ahead.  Her

skiing is fearless.  Bond likes a challenge...

They wind down the slope, competitive, testing one another,

enjoying it.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

After an exhilarating run, she stops on the edge of a huge

drop.  Bond joins her.  They look down at the snowy valley

below.  A line of survey FLAGS visible through the middle.

Bond and Elektra stand on the mountainside, feeling like the

only two people in the world, when they hear: THE DISTANT HUM

OF A PLANE.

EXT. SKY - DAY

They see FOUR OBJECTS falling out the back of the aircraft.

As the objects plummet silently toward the earth, they POP

PARACHUTES, their fall slows and then, as Bond and Elektra

watch in disbelief...

GUNFIRE echoes out from the black shapes, now visible as

PARASKIS, low-flying, sleek, deadly snow vehicles.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

Bond turns to Elektra, he has to yell over the sound of the

approaching machines.

He points her off to one side, where a shallow gully offers

cover...she skis off to shelter and he skis OUT...INTO THE

OPEN...where the paraskis trail after him...

He streaks toward the trees as the vehicles gain on him,

firing...

EXT. FOREST

He makes it to the woods, finding cover in the trees,

whipping in and out of sight as PARASKI #1 tries to follow,

sinking lower and lower until...

HIS SKIDS catch on some over hanging branches...the Paraski

is CATAPULTED into a tree and EXPLODES...

EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Coming in to pick up the pursuit of Bond is Paraski #2,

firing down at Bond, dropping bombs which explode just behind

him in the snow.  The other two paraskis LAND and eject their

chutes, now RACING THROUGH THE WOODS on the ground.

Bond looks behind him, sees them gaining...he zigzags through

the trees and suckers Paraski #3 to glance off one tree, hit

another and wipe out behind.

But the remaining predator on the ground, Paraski #4, is

gaining on him...Bond bursts out of the trees and finds

himself heading toward...

THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE...

He cranks himself right, narrowly avoiding a tumble over the

edge.  Paraski #4 isn't so lucky and SAILS OFF THE CLIFF to a

hundred and fifty foot drop.

But the smile is wiped off his face as...AN EMERGENCY

PARACHUTE deploys from the back...

The Paraski does a climbing turn and heads straight back for

him...

Bond skis for his life, away from Paraski #4 when PARASKI #2

One ahead and one behind, Bond turns back...he has nowhere to

go but...

OVER THE EDGE

He sails through the air and lands on the Paraski #4,

slashing the parachute with his ski pole before bouncing off

and doing an amazing tumbling hundred foot fall to the snow,

where he lands on his skis... Paraski four, the chute

tangling in the rotors of its propeller, struggles to

maintain control, his vehicle inexorably hurtling toward

PARASKI #2: both of them having set their course for Bond,

they are now on a collision course with EACH OTHER...

IN THE GULLY BELOW

Bond meets up with Elektra as above them...

The two Paraskis collide, crashing into the snowy hill above

and tumbling down, end over end.

Bond and Elektra huddle together as shards and debris rain

down on them.

Then...silence.  An eerie silence.

Bond nods, ripping from his pole a PIECE OF THE PARACHUTE he

slashed and wiping his face with it...he looks at the piece

of fabric in his hand.  He sees:

CYRILLIC LETTERS...undecipherable to us...but there is a look

on his face, a look of recognition as...

AN EARTH RATTLING RUMBLE grows above them.

Bond stuffs the parachute fragment in his ski-suit as he

turns...

The exploding Paraskis have triggered AN AVALANCHE on the

slope above.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/AVALANCHE AREA - DAY

They try to outrun it -- riding the sliding hill -- but they

haven't a hope... the rest of the snow is catching them,

they're going to get swallowed.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/AVALANCHE AREA - DAY

The ground shudders, the THUNDER CLOSING...  Their ankles are

soon covered, Elektra falls.  Bond stops, pulls her up.

They're about to die.  He pulls her to him.

She's confused and frightened but does as she's told.

They hold one another tight as -- here it comes -- the white

fury hurtles over them, burying them...  At the last moment,

just as their heads vanish from view...

CLOSE ON BOND PULLING THE Q GADGET ON THE JACKET.

The AIRBAG slams open.  The snow covers it and them.  More

and more snow slides over...

INT. SNOW HOLE - MOMENTS LATER

Darkness.  The RUMBLING CEASES...

Light emanates from Bond's watch.  In the shadows he pulls a

knife, punctures the air bag. It deflates, leaving them

cocooned in an icy tomb.  Elektra looks around, staring,

unbelieving.

But her breath is coming in short, irregular bursts.

Bond takes a knife from a sheath around his ankle.  Flicks

open the small blade.  He starts to cut a hole in the snow

above their heads. She stops him.

The snow CREAKS eerily, she gasps, terror mounting.

Bond grabs her, holds her tight.  She resists, bucks.

Finally, arrested by the strength in his eyes, she calms...

EXT. MOUNTAINS - MOMENTS LATER

A beautiful expanse of smooth virgin snow.  All is quiet.

CLOSER

Bond's fist PUNCHES through the white.  He pulls the snow

away, climbs out.  Leans in, lifts Elektra out.

Bond and Elektra stand, lone figures in the perfect white.

They hear a sound...HELICOPTER ROTORS.  Rescue on its way.

EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - DAY

An establishing shot of Bond's BMW parked outside the ornate

villa on the shore of the golden Caspian.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - DAY

Palatial.  Hallway dominated by a LARGE PAINTING of a bearded

man in traditional Turkish garb, sitting proudly on a horse.

Davidov, Gabor, waiting, pacing.

Bond is sits in a chair, ON EDGE, writing something over and

over on a small pad of paper...THE CYRILLIC LETTERS on the

parachute fragment.

A DOCTOR comes down the grand staircase. The men stand.

INT. ELEKTRA'S BEDROOM - SUNSET

Bond enters. Elektra is standing by the window watching the

golden ball of the sun sink into the sea. She wears nothing

but a silk embroidered robe; the sun shows through it,

outlining her naked body in soft, shadowy curves.

He nods.  He is wound tight, she senses it.

A moment.

He waits.

Bond looks at her; vulnerable, fragile, trying to be strong.

He cannot tell her the truth.

She stares at him, sensing he is withholding something. She

turns back to the window.

He approaches behind her.

She looks out at the fading sun.

She turns to him.

She looks up at him, into his eyes; they are so close. All

she has to do is tilt her mouth upward...she kisses him.  His

hands come up across her back, pressing her toward him, her

body melting into his, and then...

He pulls back. Has to physically step away from her.

That was exactly the wrong thing to say. He sees the

rebellion flair in her eyes.

He starts toward the door.

He stops, his back up...then heads out the door.

IN THE HALLWAY

He passes Gabor, standing faithfully outside.

EST. SHOT - EXT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT

Elegant, mysterious.  A modern day Casablanca.

INT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT

Bond in evening dress in the sumptuous casino. He takes out

the Q glasses, slips them on, surveys the room --

HIS X-RAY POV

He can see all the WEAPONS carried by the players.  All sizes

of pistol, even the odd grenade.  The obvious side-effect of

this view -- he can see through clothes.

His eyes alight on two girls walking away from him.  One of

them turns to look back, unaware that she is on display.  She

returns Bond's smile.  Her friend turns to look.  Bond's

smile grows:  she has a small pistol concealed over one

breast.

INT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT

He looks over the lenses -- and spies someone on the fringes.

His old adversary, ex-KGB, VALENTIN ZUKOVSKY, talking to some

suspicious types. Zukovsky looks across. Bond walks toward

him.

He turns to a suspicious-looking Heavy.

The Boa is completely bald, muscular; huge, deadly hands.

The Boa leaves, glaring all the while.

Bond takes from his pocket the fragment of the PARACHUTE.

Zukovsky examines the letters.

Zukovsky shakes his head. Sighs.

He notices Bond watching THE HOSTESS BAR...a dark alcove of

the casino, where slinky HOOKERS flatter the guests.

This hits Zukovsky. He closes down. A chill between them.

Bond's eyes catch something, someone entering the casino.

HIS POV:  ELEKTRA...more vibrant than we have ever seen her,

living up to her name. She is impossibly glamorous in a

sparkling dress that fits like second skin.  Her hair is full

and tumbling, her eyes are fiery and wild.

Bond starts toward her, but she tosses her head, defiant, and

turns away, making her way to the Roulette tables.

Bond follows her across the casino. They are like two cats,

moving through this neon jungle, their energy dangerous and

sexy, all eyes on them. He takes note as she passes...MINIMUM

$100, then $500, $1000...

She finally stops at the 'No limit' table.  Crowded with the

nastiest and richest of the high rollers, Armenians, Turks,

South Americans, a computer nerd American and a Russian

industrialist's wife, heavy with jewelry and drink.

ZUKOVSKY is suddenly there, pulling out a seat for her in the

center.

He gestures to the Dealer, who pushes ten towering stacks of

CHIPS toward her. A WAITRESS is right there to take her

order.

He leans in, smiling his charming smile as he says:

She points to a SHOW GIRL in a feather headdress and pasties.

She pushes half her chips back onto the table, letting them

stand on her bet.  The whole table exhales. Then, it starts:

bets are placed, gamblers energized by her arrival.

Bond scans the room, vigilant, nervous...

HIS P.O.V.  He zeroes in on Davidov, sidling off, away from

the table, trying to look nonchalant, his eyes shifting this

way and that...he looks suspicious as hell.

Bond watches, his blood running, and then...

Davidov slips into the HOSTESS BAR.  A HOOKER is soon

wrapping herself around him. After a few words, she leads him

off toward the back.

Bond returns to the game, shaking his head.  He watches as

THE DEALER DEALS FROM THE SHOE.

INT. SALON PRIV - NIGHT

A small room.  Lit by sconces that sport LIVE FLAMES.  Tacky-

luxurious, a refracted Eastern reflection on an old west

whore house.

Davidov undresses in the little bathroom alcove.  He faces a

small ornate mirror over the sink, in which he can see THE

HOOKER behind him, on the bed.

She slowly pulls a pair of SILK ROPES out from her bra and

DANGLES THEM.

Davidov smiles, struggling with his belt.  He looks down,

gets it, looks up...his heart stops...it is not the hooker in

the mirror but...

RENARD'S FRIGHTENING FACE.

Davidov spins.

HIS P.O.V.  Renard's henchman stands by the door, an

automatic rifle cocked at Davidov.

INT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE

Elektra with black king showing. A seven beneath.

And with a smile she scratches her cards on the table for a

hit.  The Dealer gives her an eight.  She reveals her cards.

He rakes in her chips. But Elektra is undeterred.  She pushes

another pile forward as the next deal commences.

INT. SALON PRIVE

The HENCHMAN holds Davidov against the wall with his huge

fist around his neck.  Near his head, the live flame of a

SCONCE hisses, burning blue and yellow, drawing their fuel

from the glass basin of hot oil attached beneath it.

The HOOKER, obviously one of Renard's gang, has finished

donning her khaki pants and combat boots and straps a gun

onto her shoulder.

Renard looks distastefully at the room.

He approaches close to him, stopping at the flaming SCONCE

near his head.

Davidov starts to sweat.

Renard touches the glass well of oil.

Renard uses his knife and POPS the seal from the lamp,

removing the well of oil...a DROP of the hot oil FALLS ON HIS

HAND and SINGES IT BLACK in an instant...

Renard does not even flinch.  Davidov starts talking, trying

to placate...

Renard raises the container of oil over Davidov's head:

Renard stops, the oil tilted, just ready to pour...

His dead eye...has it drooped further since we last saw

him?...seems to glitter in the light...

Renard lets a TRICKLE OF OIL drop onto Davidov's head...

HE SCREAMS as his hair smokes and singes...

Renard makes a motion, the THUG releases Davidov, who falls

to the floor, clutching his head.

INT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE

Another deal. ZUKOVSKY and others watch, as Elektra stakes

even more.  People move closer for a view.  The Dealer shows

a five. Elektra shows Bond her cards.

Elektra is holding two eights. Dealer's up-card is a six.

She smiles. He holds her gaze.

They eye one another a long while -- sex firmly in the air.

She smiles.  She moves ALL HER CHIPS forward.

Bond catches a look between the Dealer and Zukovsky:

General kerfuffle.  Bond looks back toward THE HOSTESS

BAR...no sign of Davidov's return...

The Dealer scoops a card from the shoe.  Tension.  Everyone

holds their breath...as he turns over...  -- a six.  Bust.

The audience inhale as one AS THE DEALER TAKES ALL HER CHIPS

AWAY.

Elektra stands.  She has dignity in defeat. She turns to

Bond, holding out a hand.

EXT. CASINO - NIGHT

Bond, Elektra, Gabor outside, Davidov soon joining them,

trying to look like he hasn't been through hell.  Bond

notices the burn on his head. Davidov touches it self-

consciously.

Davidov scowls at him. Bond leads Elektra away...

A DISTANT P.O.V. FROM HIGH ABOVE.

Someone watches Bond and Elektra move toward his BMW.

EXT. CASINO ROOF

RENARD and his henchmen, watching. Renard seems mesmerized by

the sight of Bond's HAND on the small of Elektra's back,

their easy sensuality as they both get into the car.

EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT

Bond and Elektra emerge from the BMW.  Behind them, Gabor and

Davidov get out of her car. Bond watches as Davidov slams his

door and marches off, angry, toward the SECURITY QUARTERS at

the side of the house.

Bond and Elektra walk to the front door, anticipation thick

in the air.  Gabor opens the door. Elektra sweeps through...

INT. ENTRANCE HALL, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT

Bond pauses just inside the open doorway.

HIS P.O.V.  Two figures in the cavernous entrance hall,

Elektra having a brief word with Gabor, before he turns and

exits, leaving only...

ELEKTRA AND BOND.

She starts upstairs, Bond's eyes locked on her body, and

then:

SHE LOOKS BACK...just once.  But it says everything. She

continues upward.

Bond taps the front door closed with his foot.

INT. BEDROOM, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - NIGHT

Half-light.  They're entwined between the sheets.  This is

something slow, languorous, not to be rushed.  We can't make

out the mechanics, but they're beaded with sweat.

Her fingers trace the contours of his torso.  Linger on his

bruised collar-bone.

Her hand dips in an ice bucket beside the bed.  She rubs a

slither of ice down her chest, shudders with pleasure.  It's

a move Bond hasn't seen before.

Now she brings the ice to his shoulder.

She kisses his purple flesh.  Licks.

She slides her tongue back and fore along the groove above

the tendon.  And he pulls the ice from her hand:

Tosses it across the room as passion takes over...

INT. BEDROOM, ELEKTRA'S VILLA - LATER

A puddle of water where the ice fell.

Post-sex on the bed. He traces a hand down her naked back.

The sweat glistens off the curve of her spine.  She turns.

The light glints off her jewelled earlobe...he touches it.

Elektra looks at him.

She reaches to the large, diamond-encrusted earring and

gently plucks it away. Pulls her lush hair back...

The lower half of her ear is gone, reduced to a misshapen

clump of scar tissue. It is the only mark on her perfect

body. A physical reminder of her ordeal. It breaks his heart.

They are looking at each other, both suddenly feeling

something dangerously close to real connection.  It is not

what Bond expected.

He holds her gaze for a long time before he looks away.

She frowns, slightly.  Settles into his chest.

He holds her, eyes full of conflict, staring into the dark.

EXT. VILLA - NIGHT - LATER

The lights of a car pulling up at the security office by the

perimeter wall of the property.

EXT. SECURITY QUARTERS - SAME

Bond's car, several of Elektra's vehicles, all parked around

the security office.  They have been joined by:

A WHITE ECONOMY CAR, a Russian make, with a familiar SEAL

painted on the door...we've seen it before, the seal on top

of the stolen report at the beginning...Miratom.

Out of the driver's seat steps...DAVIDOV.  He carries a

briefcase from the car to the front door of the security

office. He looks around furtively before he disappears

inside.

The parking area is dark and silent and then:

JAMES BOND sits up in the driver's seat of his BMW.

INT. BMW - SAME

Bond sticks his key in the ignition and activates the car's

various systems.

HIS P.O.V.  Davidov is a shadow in the office window.

Bond flicks a switch.  A NEEDLE-THIN BEAM is directed from

the BMW to the window of the office.  He can HEAR a synthesis

of Davidov's voice...

Bond hears the click of a phone hanging up.  He flicks

another switch in his car, an infra-red tracking system

activates in his WINDSCREEN...

He can now see Davidov perfectly as he comes out of the

security quarters, carrying a briefcase and a large DUFFLE

BAG which he carries to the car and loads into the TRUNK.

He goes back inside.

BOND gets out of the BMW.  He moves stealthily to the Russian

vehicle and, using the laser beam on his watch, opens the

lock on the trunk.  It pops open.

Bond sees the briefcase, and the dufflebag, and...SOMETHING

ELSE...something beneath them...he moves the objects aside:

A MAN is folded into the back of the trunk, his head slumped

forward, dark hair on the back of his head slightly wet

...blood? Bond tips the head back, revealing GLASSY DEAD

EYES.

Bond leans in and plucks a BADGE from his white shirt pocket.

It has a photo of the dead man and reads, in English and

Cyrillic: LEONID TASHKA - FIELD INSPECTOR.  On the corner of

the badge...THE RUSSIAN SEAL...Miratom. The one from the

report.  Bond touches it with his thumb, recognizing it.

AT THE OFFICE

Davidov is coming out...

Bond LOWERS THE TRUNK DOOR and crouches behind the car.

AT THE OFFICE ENTRANCE

Davidov pauses to lock the door. He walks toward the Russian

car...he is actually WHISTLING a happy tune and then...

HE STOPS. He has heard something. He draws his gun. He walks

AROUND the entire car.  When he gets to the rear...

THE TRUNK IS CLOSED.  Bond is not there.  No evidence he ever

was.

Davidov gets in the driver's seat and starts the car.

EXT. AIR STRIP - NIGHT

The Russian car drives onto the grounds of a small, deserted

AIRPORT consisting of one outbuilding and a crudely cleared

airstrip.

INT. CAR

Davidov pulls off the road and parks his car in a wooded

area.

EXT. CAR

Davidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and

opens the trunk.

He removes the briefcase.  Then the duffle bag.  He looks

down at the dead body,  head slumped forward, as before...but

something is different, the clothes not quite right and then:

THE DEAD BODY MOVES, the head turns, Davidov gasps...

It IS JAMES BOND.

Davidov pulls his HAND GUN from inside his coat, but Bond is

quicker.  With a silenced pistol he shoots Davidov in the

head. One little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes

go wide and he crumbles, dead.

Bond climbs out of the trunk.  Crouches to examine Davidov.

He straightens.  Picks up the briefcase.  It is locked.  He

searches Davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket.  He

opens the lock.

INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE:  FOUR STACKS OF MONEY.  Documents

headed with the official crest of Miratom.  A new security

tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has Davidov's

name and picture...some hologrammed (blank) security tags --

and a polaroid-type camera.

He picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the

camera.  Points at himself, takes a shot.  Punches in

'Davidov' on the KEYPAD.  Out comes a brand new pass.

Bond goes to look in the dufflebag but...

A PLANE is approaching...HE LOOKS UP.

HIS P.O.V.  A Russian military jet appears over the trees,

flying low, its red landing lights blinking.

EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT

A door opens on the sinister-looking plane.  A hydraulic step

unit folds out of it.  A BIG SOLDIER with a machine gun waits

in the doorway.

BOND, standing at the edge of the runway, clips on his badge

and picks up the briefcase.  He has NO IDEA what he's walking

into.

He hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to

the plane.  He starts up the steps:

THE SOLDIER POINTS HIS GUN DOWN AT HIM. Says something to him

IN RUSSIAN.

Bond pauses.  And then, thinking, says:

The soldier looks at him, then lowers his weapon.

INT. PLANE

Four soldiers. The first guy and a moustachioed PILOT and two

young men, a nasty-looking private, cadaverously thin, and a

big, thick-necked tough.

They all look at Bond, expectantly, waiting for him to say or

do...what? He decides to take the lead. He opens the

briefcase and hands over the STACKS OF MONEY.

The Pilot passes it out. But that isn't the end. They still

stare at him.  The Pilot says something IN RUSSIAN that

sounds like..."where's the rest?"

Bond swallows.  Thinks, without showing it.  He decides to

OPEN THE DUFFLE BAG.  He looks inside. Pauses, then reaches

in and takes out...A BOX OF NIKE SHOES.

The thin soldier smiles. That's the ticket. Bond hands out

shoes to the rest of the guys.

EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN

A red dawn.  Dominating the landscape, a valley of weirdly-

shaped rocks. To one side, an airstrip.  The plane

approaching.

INT. PLANE - LANDING

The three soldiers wear their new shoes and smoke and chat

amongst themselves.

Bond sits in the rear of the plane, which is dominated by

heavily buffered receptacles, clearly awaiting some deadly

cargo. There is Russian writing everywhere, and one symbol he

clearly recognizes:  DANGER - RADIOACTIVE.

Bond looks out of the window.  Beneath a huge MESA, a huddle

of low buildings.

They come to a stop near the end of the runway.  A SMALL JEEP

is driving out to them.

One of the soldiers throws something to Bond. An ORANGE

JUMPSUIT that says Miratom on the breast.  He catches it.

EXT. AIRSTRIP/VALLEY/TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN

Bond, in the orange overalls and wearing his ID tag, is

driving with a Russian soldier through the weird rock valley -

-

KABOOM!

A cloud of dust from a detonation rises up on the other side

of the hill.

EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY

They turn the corner and see trucks marked IDA, several

Kazakhstan army personal carriers, soldiers dotted around,

IDA (International Decommissioning Agency) scientists and

personnel quietly going about their business.  A vast

protective 'bubble' is inflated at the front of the building.

INT. 'BUBBLE' - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY

(CHRISTMAS JONES') POV:

The sound of breathing LOUD, we're looking from inside the

visor of a protective suit.  It's hard to tell what's going

on, but our hands are removing a sphere of cobalt blue

plutonium from inside a corroding WARHEAD...

EXT. FACILITY - SAME

An officer eyes Bond's pass.

Bond shows him the case.  Akakievich examines the documents.

He points toward the "bubble."

Inside the transparent bubble, a protective-suited FIGURE

finishes placing a blue PLUTONIUM CORE into a box.

As Bond and the Colonel walks toward the bubble, the FIGURE

steps out, still enveloped in the white protective suit.

Moving fast, off comes the helmet to reveal a BEAUTIFUL

AMERICAN GIRL.  CHRISTMAS JONES is mid-twenties, shortish

hair, hot right now.  In one movement she unzips and steps

out of the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut-off

shorts, heavy duty boots.  A nasty-looking hunting knife

strapped around her hips.  She has a deep tan and an

incredible figure.

She grabs a bottle of water, guzzles.

Bond tosses an arched brow to Akakievich, who nods bitterly,

also unable to take his eyes off her.  He spits on the floor

and speaks in ENGLISH, so Christmas can hear.

Akakievich isn't exactly what you'd call a looker.  Bond

offers a disappointed tut as Akakievich walks away.

Christmas approaches.  He notices her IDA tag -- and an

incongruous PEACE TATTOO just above her hip. She's checking

him out as well.

She is wary.  It's been a long time since a man this

attractive stepped onto her beat. They walk toward the

building.

Bond looks at the ominous radiation WARNING SIGNS.

She squints at him, taken aback.

Bond turns to go, knowing he misstepped.  Christmas then

speaks to him, asking a question, IN RUSSIAN.

Bond turns, answers IN PERFECT RUSSIAN.

She nods. Watches him disappear into the building.

INT. TEST CHAMBER MAIN ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Bond descends, going down deep.

INT. TEST CHAMBER ELEVATOR/CORRIDOR - LATER

The elevator creaks to a halt.  He slides the elevator doors

OPEN revealing...

TWO SOLDIERS waiting for the elevator. Bond shows them his

ID.

The soldiers get into the elevator and disappear, leaving

Bond completely ALONE.

Dead silence in the shadows.  Bond's in his element, that

alert glint in his eye as he takes in his surroundings.

HIS P.O.V.  A long, dark corridor...leading off to a more

open circle in the distance, lights and an ominous humming

there.

Bond starts down the passageway.

INT. TEST CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Ahead of Bond, like a deadly spider at the centre of a web, a

NUCLEAR BOMB suspended over a pit.

Blast openings range around to channel its fury to measuring

equipment.

Bond is alone with the bomb. An eerie moment. Then, he comes

to notice a figure, across the expanse of the pit, on the

opposite side of the catwalk, a man, with his back to him, in

Russian Army fatigues.

The man turns...

IT IS RENARD.

He smiles.

Renard starts toward him.  Bond draws his gun.

He and Bond face off, the malevolent bomb between them, a

ROBOT DEVICE beginning to lower it into the pit.

Renard gestures into the pit.

BOND'S P.O.V.  TWO OF RENARD'S MEN in the pit, unaware of

what is happening above, working directly with the bomb. One

of them is using a manual...IT IS JUST LIKE THE STOLEN

REPORT, the Miratom seal in the corner.

Bond aims his gun at Renard's head.

Renard resumes walking, around the catwalk at the edge of the

pit, toward Bond, slowly, surely, totally fearless.

Bond, out of the corner of his eye, sees Renard's man remove

a SMALL DEVICE from inside the bomb.  It is the size and

shape of a credit card, black, with shiny transistors on

it...the man slips it into his pocket.

Bond cocks the pistol.

Bond's eyes flare in fury.  He shoves Renard into the wall

and presses the gun to his temple.

Bond strikes him across the temple with his pistol.  Renard

drops to his knees.  He touches his temple, looks at the

blood curiously, feeling no pain.

As Bond screws a silencer onto the muzzle of his gun:

Bond knows that, he's heard it somewhere before...IT FREEZES

HIM, just a beat, but it is enough...

SUDDENLY, the noise of footsteps -- CHRISTMAS JONES, with

COLONEL AKAKIEVICH and two armed soldiers.

We're with them as they turn the corner of the passageway and

see Bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling Renard --

classic execution stance:

The soldiers' guns are trained on Bond.

Christmas is listening, but Akakievich cocks his rifle.

And he means business.  Bond delays ... but has no choice.

He pulls the clip from his gun, tosses it down.

Colonel Akakievich looks suitably stung.  But Renard is

looking past him now, as with a quiet WHIRR, the BOMB raises

into view on a trolley.  Renard's team is ready to move.

And Renard jams his hand onto Bond's shoulder, squeezing his

collar-bone hard...  Pain jolts through Bond, he drops to his

knees in agony. He shoves Bond down.  Bond's hand goes to his

shoulder, his mind now racing -- how did he know to hurt him

there?

Renard's men start to maneuver the bomb toward the curving

passageway.  It's all too much for Colonel Akakievich:

Renard stops and turns.  Bond sees him nod to two of his men:

one quietly slopes off down the tunnel.  The other innocently

opens a container...

INT. CONTAINER

Camera shows the INSIDE of the container's lid; the man

releases a false lining to reveal several MACHINE GUNS...

INT. TEST CHAMBER - DAY

One of Colonel Akakievich's men gestures with his gun that

Bond should get up.  Knowing it's now or never, Bond PUSHES

him away, yanks a PISTOL from his holster, GRABS Christmas,

LEAPS down into the bomb PIT just as

RENARD'S MEN open fire...  Akakievich dies straight away.  So

do two of his men.  The gunfire RICOCHETS around the chamber

and ceases.

Renard hangs back.  His radio crackles a message:

THE GUY ON THE OTHER END OF THE RADIO

Right next to the ELEVATOR.  He turns a switch that activates

two sets of red buttons and two sets of green.

He punches one green button...

INSIDE TEST CHAMBER

Heavy doors close all exits but that to the tunnel.

INT. THE PIT

Bond and Christmas know they are being sealed in.

Bond peers over the edge -- sees Renard and his men working

the nuclear device into THE PASSAGEWAY.

INT. THE PIT

If Bond doesn't get through now, they're trapped forever.  He

points his wrist watch toward the cat walk above and presses

a button...THE TINY GRAPPLING HOOK shoots out, Q's super

filament wire that can hold up to 800 pounds is

attached...Bond uses the rope to RAPPEL UP THE SIDES OF THE

PIT and into

INT. TEST CHAMBER

Where he LEAPS ON TOP OF Renard's last man.  They fall

THROUGH THE IRIS, it SHUTS behind them.  The man swings his

machine gun at Bond -- it hits the wall next to him, breaks

apart.  Bond grabs a broken section and kills him with one

strike.

He pauses at his dead body and reaches into his jacket,

retrieving...THE CARD-LIKE DEVICE.

INT. PIT

Christmas looks around, desperate to help.  Using Bond's

wire, she climbs up to the CLOSED IRIS DOOR.  She pries open

a panel next to it and reveals complex WIRING...

INT. PASSAGEWAY

Up ahead of Bond, the bomb disappears down the passageway. He

can see it is attached to A PULLEY above, helping the men to

move quickly, Renard, pulling, the two men pushing

Renard signals one of them to drop back to cut off Bond...

Machine-gun fire turns the wall next to Bond to dust -- Bond

dives to a recess.  An overhead LIGHT SHATTERS.  His section

of the tunnel darkens.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - BOND'S END

Bond looks up at the broken LIGHT.  Takes careful aim at the

next one along.  BLAM.  It disintegrates.  Again...

INT. PASSAGEWAY - RENARD'S END

The other guy answers with another spray of bullets.  Watches

uneasily as Bond takes out light after light.  A funnel of

darkness coming to swallow him -- concealing Bond's approach.

Nervous, he fires, muzzle flash and sparks illuminating the

void.  To keep it lit, he keeps firing...

INT. PASSAGEWAY

WITH BOND as the bullets cease with a loud CLICK...  What

Bond was waiting for.  He moves.  The gunman frozen in the

light, grappling to fit another clip --

BLAM!  He goes down.  Bond not wasting bullets.

INT. OTHER END OF PASSAGEWAY

Renard is loading the bomb it into the ELEVATOR. He flicks a

switch on the panel by the elevator.  The IRIS starts closing

on Bond...

INT. PASSAGEWAY

Bond rushes for the door -- but he's shocked as the man he

shot lunges.  Clings to him.

Bond hits him away, he LEAPS for the cart blocking his way

and SHOVES IT INTO THE IRIS DOOR just as it almost closes...

Bond squeezes through...

INT. OTHER SIDE OF IRIS

Renard is getting in the ELEVATOR.  Sees Bond made it, fires.

Bond rolls into a corner.

And he machine-guns some barrels.  Rocket fuel spills out.

He digs a finger into one of the holes, effortlessly rips the

metal so more fuel cascades out.

INT. CATWALK ABOVE PIT

Christmas cuts some wires together and with a hum, her IRIS

DOOR OPENS...

AT THE ELEVATOR

Bond fires at Renard, hitting his shin...

WITH RENARD

looking down at his shin, noticing the blood.  Inconvenienced

but not in pain.  He shuts the cage doors.  Pauses only to

fire off half a clip at the SWITCH PANEL.  Shreds it.

Bond leaps to his feet, racing forward, firing -- gets to the

elevator as Renard disappears upwards with a smile. He POINTS

DOWN...underneath him...

Bond looks down.

HIS P.O.V.  BENEATH THE ELEVATOR...A makeshift explosive

device...sticks of dynamite wrapped around a detonator, set

to explode

Eyes wide, Bond looks back to the doors -- then to the switch

panel -- now just a chaos of sparking wires.

INT. LIFT SHAFT

The pipe bomb ticking...

INT. PASSAGEWAY BY ELEVATOR

Bond is trapped.  He looks up...

THE PULLEY HOOK HANGS DOWN...

He jumps up, grabbing it, just as...

KABOOM!

The bomb ignites the spilled oil, A FIREBALL shoots along,

scorching after Bond, who is SAILING THROUGH THE PASSAGE WAY,

the force of the blast sending him hurling down the

passageway ON THE PULLEY...heading straight for:

A CLOSED IRIS DOOR which miraculously begins to OPEN as he

SHOOTS THROUGH...

Ahead, the next door is OPEN as well. He sees CHRISTMAS on

the other side...

HER P.O.V.  Bond hurtling toward her, ahead of a MASSIVE

FIREBALL...

But before she can, two of the FUEL BARRELS HURTLE through

the closing iris, clattering into the pit, starting a fire

below.

Flames licking up the sides of the pit toward them.

Bond looks up, sees the ARM OF THE ROBOT LIFTER, stretching

upward toward an old SHAFT t the top of the ceiling...

He and Christmas scramble up the robot arm, walk along the

spider-like web that supported the bomb and find...

AN OLD ELEVATOR...powered by a hydraulic system...

They get in...hear the rumbling of the fire below...the old

elevator moves slowly...the rumbling grows louder...

Bond FIRES HIS GUN at the hissing hydraulic pulleys and...

THE ELEVATOR shoots through the shaft at breakneck speed as

BELOW THEM...THE PIT EXPLODES...

INT. ELEVATOR

Fire shoots up. Bond lunges to cover Christmas. As the smoke

clears:

EXT. MESA - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - CONTINUOUS

Christmas and Bond climb out of the duct.  Through a cloud of

dust he can see people running about, panicked.  There's been

some shooting -- fresh corpses litter the ground.

Bond looks past them to a plane coming this way.  The plane.

It roars past, level with them.  He follows it with his eyes,

helpless as it gets smaller and smaller...

Bond removes the locator card from his jacket and shows it to

her.  It flashes in the sun.

Christmas shakes her head, disgusted.

OMITTED 170 - 172

INT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - DAY

Busy.  Analysts huddle over monitors showing satellite

images, trying to track the plane.

Moneypenny enters...

M is surprised.

The face of ELEKTRA materializes on a large WALL MONITOR.

M exchanges a look with Tanner.

M leans on the console in front of her.

M looks up.

ELEKTRA, on the monitor, looks about as lost as she ever has.

M stares at the girl's face, her whole sordid history written

there.  M turns away from the screen and says to Tanner...

OMITTED:174 - 201

EXT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA, BAKU - STORM APPROACHING

Elektra's villa against blue-black storm clouds, the Caspian

choppy, wind blowing.

INT. ELEKTRA'S VILLA - BAKU - DAY

Elektra works in her father's STUDY, illuminated by a halo of

light from a single desk lamp. Pictures of her grandfather

and father stare down at her from the walls. The wind BLOWS A

WINDOW open.

She gets up, crosses the room, shutting the window.  She

stands there, listening to the silence and then...

SHE HEARS A THUD. A strange, unsettling thud.

She listens, a long time, to the silence.

She goes to the door, opens it...it whines on its hinges.

She steps into...

INT. LIBRARY

A big room lined with books. Three french doors lead out to a

balcony.  She walks a few paces in...

THE DOOR SHUTS BEHIND HER, she whirls...

GABOR, propped up behind the door, stares, wide-eyed, before

he FALLS TO THE FLOOR.

Elektra gasps, she turns again...

A DARK FIGURE LOOMS, a shadow against the windows.  He moves

forward, his face becoming visible...IT'S BOND.

She stares at him, shocked, hesitant.

She moves to Gabor, gets down to help him.  He stirs, he is

alive, but unconscious. Elektra looks up at Bond.

Elektra stands...she begins to tremble.

He walks toward her, threatening...

At the word "love," Elektra explodes.  She SLAPS an

unsuspecting Bond hard across the face.

He has no answer.  He can't deny what she says.

The phone rings, cuts through the tension.  Bond and Elektra

staring at one another.  She lets it ring...  Then picks up.

Listens, looks to Bond.

He moves toward her.

EXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - DAY

The MI-6 chopper lands.  We can see M through the window.

Face set hard.

EXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - MOMENTS LATER

SCIENTIFIC, MILITARY and TURKISH POLICE VEHICLES parked

around a medium-sized industrial plant.

Bond accompanies M and Tanner toward a clutch of offices.

All around, SOLDIERS, IDA personnel, POLICE scour the area.

He is moving fast, talking fast -- a sense of urgency.

They step out of the bright sunlight and into

EXT.\INT. CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS

FIVE BODY BAGS are being carried out by soldiers.  M surveys

the scene; in an unlit corridor CHRISTMAS JONES and several

men sweep the area with CLICKING Geiger counters.

ELEKTRA is a distance away, listening to a Turkish policeman

explain what's happening.  She nods acknowledgement to M.

Tanner senses that Bond wants to talk to M alone:

They watch him go.  M turns to Bond:

He draws her away, to a small alcove.  Takes something out of

his jacket...THE LOCATOR CARD.

NOW THE LIGHTS POWER UP, disrupt the intimacy and intensity

of their exchange.  The room is lined with MONITORS and a

huge SATELLITE MAP of the pipeline's meandering path.

But before he can speak, ELEKTRA calls out, gesturing to A

DIM LIGHT flashing on a console in front of her.

A Technician comes over.  Tanner too, followed by Bond and M.

The Technician flicks two switches.  The light continues to

flash.  Confused, he tries others.  No change.

Harried, the Technician activates the wall schematic of the

pipeline.  A pulse of light travels along the line. And with

it, a sense of horror descends...

The man gets on the phone...

He punches buttons. Christmas has come, stands next to Bond.

The Technician checks his records, looks up, nods.

Decisive, Christmas heads for the door, turns to her team:

Her IDA colleagues look sheepish.  Bond moves to her.

For just a moment, Christmas looks wary:

She almost smiles.

M nods to Tanner to follow them.  Bond doesn't look at

Elektra.  But she watches him go...

EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY

The MI-6 helicopter swoops along the pipeline...

Tanner is beside the pilot.  Bond and Christmas in the back.

They look at one another, the danger ahead melting the frost

between them.

INT. PIPELINE - LATER

Bond and Christmas climb through an access hatch down onto

the electric RIG.  Its lights blaze fifty yards into the

tunnel.  Then darkness.

Christmas takes the driver's spot, Bond the rear, nearest to

the approaching BOMB.  Tanner leans in:

Bonds nods, checks his watch.  Christmas looks nervously down

the pipe.

And she starts the machine off...

INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING)

It quickly picks up speed, its lights flooding the seemingly

endless pipe before them.

Christmas looks behind, apprehensive.  Waiting for the lights

of the explosive rig.

It's tense.  They travel along, expectant...

His lightness relaxes her, she appreciates it.

INT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS

Elektra, M, and others. The room is crowded with concerned

personnel.  M watches the two blips on the schematic getting

closer together. One of her MEN approaches, a radio in his

ear.

M looks at her, then nods, impressed by her courage.

INT. PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY

Bond and Christmas waiting expectantly.  Tense silence.

Finally, a WHOOSHING NOISE, GETTING LOUDER.  Lights appear

behind, reflecting on a bend, then... here it comes, the rig

tearing through the pipe.

Bond looks over his shoulder at Christmas'

speedometer...she's only at fifty...

Christmas presses forward...Bond turns, his feet OUT toward

the approaching rig...the lights getting closer... closer...

Bond's rig jolts as the other makes contact.  He cushions the

blow with his feet.  Both rigs moving together now, he CLIMBS

ONTO THE BOMB RIG...Puts out a hand, helps Christmas across.

The bomb sits there, daunting, deadly.

They look at one another, then set straight to work.

INT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS

The room is quiet, tense.  M and her two men, Elektra, Gabor,

the King TECHNICIAN and three armed security guards at the

doors. They are the only ones left.  Going down with the

ship...if it goes.  M and Elektra watch the two lights now

together on the console.  A tense silence.  Everyone's edgy.

Elektra perhaps a little more than the rest.  She exchanges a

glance with Gabor.

INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY

CLOSE INSIDE THE BOMB:  the timer.  1:45 MINUTES.

Bond's face betrays the difficulty of what they're

attempting.  The digital clock ticks down... 1:30, 1:29...

OMITTED 217-218

INT. PIPELINE - DAY

The rigs speed through the tunnel. Nothing to see.  But

WHOOSH!  As the rigs hurtle past...

INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY

The pipe suddenly dips.  They cling on as the machine bucks

like a rollercoaster.  Back on a straight...

Her brow furrows.

Bond's mind races in the ghostly light of the tunnel.

He stares at the timer:  0:44, 0:43...  Makes a decision.

Christmas shoots a look, astonished.

Taking her arm...

She can't believe what he's saying. His eyes shoot to an

INSPECTION HATCH the lights illuminate up ahead.

He grabs her, wrenches her away from the bomb.

INT. PIPELINE - DAY

The rig zooms past the exit hatch -- Bond leaps off, taking

her with him.  They tumble along the pipe.  Agile, Bond

springs to his feet, pulls her up.  They run like hell for

the hatch, into the darkness...

EXT. PIPELINE - DAY

The pipeline.  A long beat, then...

KABOOM!!  A section of the pipe explodes, debris rocketing in

every direction.

As the smoke clears we see a fifty yard section of pipe has

been destroyed.

OMIT 223

INT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER - SAME

On the consoles, red concentric circles pulse outward from

the point of impact, emitting one, monotone BEEP....

The watchers are frozen, stunned, shocked. Gabor, a radio

earpiece in his ear, reports information.

An agonizing beat. The alarm beep sputters and dies.

M and Elektra share a look.

M can't answer.  She shakes her head.

M shifts. The hi-tech room is eerily lit by the pulsing red

lights on every screen, showing the explosion.

M feels uneasy.

She hands M a small box.  M unties the ribbon.

M opens the box.  It is THE EYE OF THE GLENS...the heirloom

pin, the original.

M looks up, horrified, when:

GABOR AND ANOTHER SECURITY MAN SHOOT M'S TWO GUARDS IN THE

HEAD...point blank, cold blood.  The men fall.

M looks back at Elektra, a blood-curdling glare.

EXT. PIPELINE - DAY

From on high we follow the snaking pipeline ... until it

disappears in a VAST, SMOULDERING BOMB CRATER.  Beyond, the

pipeline continues unperturbed.

Two TINY FIGURES on the banks of the crater.

CLOSE ON THEM

Bond and Christmas, very much alive.  She's angry.

Christmas stares at him.  Wheels turning.

They're both chilled by the thought.

She starts fiddling with the radio. Suddenly there's a

CRACKLE.

Bond grabs the radio.

It impacts on Bond.  His eyes harden.

He looks out at the long stretch of pipeline, like a deadly

snake with the world for its bed.

EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - ISTANBUL - TWILIGHT

A boat puts in at an ancient tower in the middle of a vast

body of water (in fact, the Bosphorus).

Renard disembarks with several of his retinue, heavily laden

with bags and cases.  They enter the tower...

INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - CONTINUOUS

A fantastic space:  stained glass windows cast myriad

patterns over elaborate tile and marble surfaces.  Pillars,

iron lattices, velvet drapes and flowers embroider the huge

room.

As they enter, Elektra swoops across the floor and into

Renard's arms.  He holds her.  She pushes him away.

He senses something different between them.  She tries to

hide it.

He smiles, grabs a case off one of his men, opens it up,

pulls out a sphere of cobalt blue metal.

She looks at it with wary fascination.

She traces a finger along the metal.  A flicker of wonder:

She's sensitive to his buried frustration:

INT. ROOM - MAIDEN'S TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

Elektra opens a heavy door, she and Renard past through to...

A SMALL ROOM...a window set in the stone on one side.  The

other side is divided off by a WALL OF BARS, creating a cell

which now contains: M

The cell is bare, except for a camp bed in the corner. M

betrays no fear.  A quiet defiance burns in her.

Renard steps forward.  Bars separate him from M.

Elektra leaves.  Renard is left alone with M.

He crosses close to the bars.

He shakes his head, amused by her pluck.

He takes something out of his pocket.  A small TRAVEL CLOCK.

He sets it.

He places the clock on a tall stool, just out of reach

through her bars.  He leaves.  We hold on the clock:

Eight p.m.

EXT. CITY OF WALKWAYS - BAKU - DUSK (OLD SC. 174)

Valentin Zukovsky in the back of his chauffeured Rolls

Royce...  We PULL BACK, to take in an amazing sight:  the car

is on a network of raised walkways and platforms that extends

as far as the eye can see.  A decaying legacy of the Soviet

years.

EXT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS - DUSK (OLD SC.175)

Zukovsky limps purposefully away from his Rolls along a

walkway leading to a Beluga fishery built over the water.

INT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS - DUSK (OLD SC.176)

Nailed on the battered old door, the lid of a caviar jar, a

label illustrated with a LINE DRAWING OF ZUKOVSKY. Zukovsky

opens the door and finds himself...

Staring straight down Bond's pistol.  Bond and Christmas are

silhouetted by the gold dusk light.  At their feet lies one

of Zukovsky's workers.

Hands held clear of his body, Zukovsky enters, his evening

dress decidedly out of place here.

Bond SLAMS Zukovsky hard against a vat of caviar.  Wood

splits, roe spills onto the floor.  Zukovsky is appalled.

Christmas moves in, intense but firm:

A subtle change in Zukovsky's countenance.

But it may be already:

The SOUND OF A HELICOPTER.  Zukovsky frowns, the SOUND

GETTING LOUDER --

Bond is the first to move as --

INT. CAVIAR FISHERY - NIGHT (OLD SC. 177)

-- wood suddenly splinters everywhere -- the wall and roof

tear open behind them - GIANT VERTICALLY-SUSPENDED SAWS RIP

THROUGH, just missing them.

THE SPINNING TEETH (OLD SC. 178)

The blades churn through the corrugated roof, spraying CAVIAR

everywhere.

EXT. CAVIAR FISHERY - CITY OF WALKWAYS (OLD SC. 179)

Bond BURSTS OUT OF THE BUILDING...Zukovsky and his guards and

even the chauffeur are firing at the chopper...

EXT. RAMP TO LOWER WALKWAY (OLD SC. 180)

Bond makes for his BMW, running down a flight of steps, onto

a lower walkway when...THE SECTION AHEAD OF HIM

EXPLODES...the second chopper above hitting its mark with a

thrown grenade.  Bond is trapped by the fire and smoke, the

only way out is ALONG THE PIPELINES...he runs along a narrow

section of pipe and then JUMPS DOWN to another walkway.  The

PIPES are now above him...the chopper's relentless saws CUT

THROUGH THE PIPE...GAS JETS OUT...Bond HURLS HIMSELF up a

stairway.

INT. CAVIAR FISHERY

Zukovsky and Christmas watch in horror as Chopper One blades

away more roof above them.

EXT. LOWER WALKWAY

Bond takes something out of his pocket, a remote control

device...he presses some buttons...HIS CAR COMES TO

LIFE...lights on, it drives toward him.

He rushes to meet it. Chopper Two follows behind Bond,

slicing up the walkway just behind him.  Bond gets to the car

and JUMPS IN as the chopper veers away.

INT. CAR

Bond activates his missile device as he watches Chopper Two

pass behind the factory.  Suddenly there's a huge roar behind

him as the blades from Chopper One RIP THROUGH THE ROOF,

SLICING HIS CAR IN HALF.

But Bond is undeterred.  He sets off the missile toward the

disappearing Chopper One.

EXT. CHOPPER

A DIRECT HIT. Chopper One explodes and falls onto the walkway

setting the scene ablaze.

EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME

Zukovsky and Christmas see the explosion, then see Chopper

Two dropped FOUR ARMED MEN onto a nearby walkway.  The men

make their way toward the factory, firing at the guards.

Zukovsky and Christmas are forced inside.

ANGLE ON BOND

Who sees the danger to the others and runs off along the

walkways back to the factory.  The Chopper follows him,

shooting.

Bond outruns it, until, ahead of him A GRENADE EXPLODES,

destroying the walkway and hurling Bond into the water.

EXT. FACTORY

The gunfight continues as the armed men take out Zukovsky's

guards. Then, two of the assailants follow ZUKOVSKY and

CHRISTMAS into...

INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

The chauffeur is shot and killed.  The gunmen then turn their

attention to Zukovsky and Christmas, when suddenly BOND

APPEARS through a trap door in the floor boards.

Bond shoots one of the gunmen, then fires on the other...

Zukovsky grabs Christmas and they make their escape  Bond

sees a third gunman firing from the basement and takes him

out.

EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME

Zukovsky and Christmas make a dash for Zukovsky's Rolls.

They dive in...Zukovsky rams the car into reverse...behind

him, A CHOPPER SLICES the walkway to smithereens...Zukovsky

can't stop it as the car leaps backward and into THE WATER

BELOW....

INT. FACTORY

Bond finishes off the remaining two armed men in a furious

gunfight and exits.

EXT. WALKWAYS - SAME

Bond sees Zukovsky and Christmas swimming to safety.  The

chopper bears down on him.  He leaps back to what's left of

the building, picks up a flare gun.  He jumps down to a

walkway at water level and cranks open a rusted GAS JET...he

then waits for the Chopper to line up over it as it

approaches Bond for the kill....

Bond fires the flare gun...

THE GAS EXPLODES!

The Chopper tries to pull away, but it's too late.  The

flames engulf it, igniting a fireball.

IN THE WATER

Zukovsky pulls himself back onto a walkway and heads for the

factory, but speeding at him are to FREE-FLYING SAW BLADES

from the chopper that has just exploded!

OMITTED 231S to 231Z

EXT. WALKWAY

Zukovsky dives away -- into a CAVIAR PIT.  The saws embed in

the cabin behind him.

The caviar pit is like sinking sand, deep -- he's going

under.  Flounders, trying to cling to a crate blown in there

by the explosion.  Then he looks in horror:

EXT. SIDE OF CAVIAR PIT (OLD SC. 199)

POV ZUKOVSKY:

Bond appearing at the edge of the caviar pit, dragging

himself up, soaking wet.  He's holding another harpoon gun.

Points it directly at Zukovsky.  This time he really means

business.

EXT. CAVIAR PIT/SIDE (OLD SC. 200)

Zukovsky, on the point of being swallowed by the caviar,

clawing at the crate.  Bond, steely eyed, cold:

Zukovsky is sinking.

Zukovsky sees Christmas appear beside Bond:

She looks to Bond -- sees he's serious.

Zukovsky sinks alarmingly -- he talks rapidly, staccato:

But he looks more worried than ever as Bond takes aim with

the harpoon gun -- squeezes the trigger.

Bond fires.  Zukovsky YELLS as the HARPOON SHOOTS TOWARD HIM.

It takes him a moment to realize he hasn't been hit -- the

harpoon splintering the crate, just missing him.  He clings

to the crate, exhausted, as Bond and Christmas drag him to

safety.

He just looks at her.

Zukovsky scowls, wet, angry, looking from his ruined suit to

the devastation that was once his caviar factory as, behind

him, walkways CREAK, teeter, and CRASH into the sea.

INT/EXT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - NIGHT

Beyond iron balustrades we see one of the most fabulous views

in the world -- on one side the still waters of the Golden

Horn, on the other, the dancing waves of the unsheltered

Bosphorus -- and in between, the tumbling roofs, soaring

minarets and crouching mosques of the Pera district.

RENARD scans the water with night-vision binoculars.

EXT. BOSPHORUS - NIGHT - HIS GREEN POV:

A SUPERTANKER churns along...

ADJUST ANGLE

The CAMERA SINKS BENEATH THE WAVES, steals through the gloom -

- eventually comes upon something sitting just beneath the

belly of the tanker.  The silhouette of a SUBMARINE, hugging

the tanker's shadow, creeping undetected into the

Bosphorus...

INT. M'S CELL - NIGHT

M paces her cell.  Looks out, at the clock:

It is MIDNIGHT.  Twelve hours to go.

She crosses her arms.  Returns to pacing.  Puts her hands in

her coat pockets:

She feels something.  Takes it out.

THE LOCATOR CARD.  Black and shiny, with two copper terminals

on one end.

M taps it on her hand. She looks back out.  TO THE CLOCK.

INT. BEDROOM - MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - NIGHT

Renard and Elektra.  She is on the bed, Renard stroking her,

worshipping her skin.

It stings him. Elektra sits up, pulling a robe around her.

Renard gets up.  Paces the floor.

Renard leans against her desk, closing his eyes, squeezing

out the images.  After a moment, he SMASHES HIS FIST through

the hand-painted wood.  Elektra looks up.

HER P.O.V.  A huge splinter of wood juts out of Renard's

hand.

Renard looks at it, curious, unfazed.

Elektra comes to him. Leads him to the bed.  Sits. Gently

removes the splinter.  Then, she takes an icecube from the

bucket.  Runs it along his wound.

And she runs the ice down his cheek.  He shakes his head.

Tormented.

Now she runs the ice down her neck...

...her fingers becoming wet, she runs the ice down between

her breasts, leaving a trail.  Teasing...

She's moving the ice lower on herself... We see her lips

open, enjoying the sensation.  A beat, then his smile slowly

grows.  As she does something else.

INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DEAD OF NIGHT

Eerily quiet.  The calm before the storm, except:

INT. M'S CELL - SAME

M is at the door of her cell.  Her arm is stretched out

through the bars.  She is using her high-heeled shoe to try

to HOOK the leg of the stool and drag it toward her.  She can

only jut tap the leg with the tip of the heel.  She swipes

out at the little three-legged stool, tapping it, tapping

it...

It scoots toward her a little...she taps it again, gets her

shoe HOOKED on the leg of the stool and starts to drag it

when...

The rickety stool hits a bump on the ancient stone floor and

SPILLS OVER...the clock HITS THE GROUND and SKIDS across the

stones, coming to rest ACROSS THE ROOM, on the floor near the

window.

M leans against the bars. SHE HEARS HER THE OUTER DOOR

CLANKING OPEN...

She hurries to her cot and lies down.

GABOR ENTERS...a burly shadow in the light from the hall.  He

walks in.  Looks at M.  Picks up the clock and sets it ON THE

WINDOW SILL.

He leaves, shutting the door behind him.

M sits up. Looks out to the clock, glowing in the dark.

IT READS TWO A.M.

She drops her head back on the wall.  She will not sleep

out their wares.  We hold on a BUILDING.

INT. DYE FACTORY - SAME

A multi-levelled, rickety old building full of colourful

fabrics drying high overhead; the light shafts through them

casting pools of different coloured light.

It is a working factory, bolts of fabric and vats of dye, but

it is also:

AN OLD KGB SURVEILLANCE CENTER

Pushed to one end of the large room are stacks of radio

equipment, old consoles, audio equipment and radar screens.

Once a high-tech surveillance center, it has gone to seed.

There are men and women here, smoking, using the equipment,

slightly dissolute, very sinister, where the only membership

card is an old KGB ID.  Zukovsky is here, leaning behind a

RADIO OPERATOR.

He moves to CHRISTMAS AND BOND, pouring over a large MAP OF

ISTANBUL spread out on a table.

Bond notices THE BOA in the corner with some others.

Zukovsky nods to his old friend.

Zukovsky looks at the map.

INT. SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - ISTANBUL - DAY

The ancient arched underbelly of a waterside building.

Something is disturbing a large expanse of water.  A black

shadow looms beneath the waves.  A SUBMARINE SURFACES.

INT. SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - ISTANBUL - DAY

Waiting at the newly excavated quay:  Renard and his men.

The submarine's hatch opens.  A YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN EMERGES,

vaguely resembling his uncle, Zukovsky.

One of his men comes forward with several bottles of brandy

and other food.

The Captain nods, pleased.

INT. DYE FACTORY

Bond and Christmas and Zukovsky watch as the radio operators

scan the airwaves.

Bond stares hard at him.  A long beat.

INT. SUBMARINE - DAY

Eerie, dark, the lights inside green and sickly.

CLOSE ON

A half-eaten sandwich. An empty glass of brandy on the floor,

just near the hand it fell from...

PULL BACK TO SEE

The dead face of Yevgeny, poisoned.  Others of his crew

around, also dead.

Renard and his men tour the grisly scene.

As they drag Yevgeny away, his HAT falls on the ground.

Renard picks it up and PUTS IT ON HIS HEAD.

A man appears holding a heavy lead box containing the

plutonium.  Renard takes the box as if it weighs nothing.

Stronger then ever.

INT. CELL - MAIDEN'S TOWER - MORNING

Elektra stands at the door looking in at M.

Elektra walks to the window.  She looks out.

M watches her, her heart beating.

Elektra picks up the little clock. Walks over to the cell

bars.

And she reaches through the bars and HANDS M THE CLOCK.

The two women's eyes meet.

She turns, sees RENARD in the doorway.  She crosses to him

and SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT behind her.

INT. OUTSIDE DOOR - MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY

Their eyes lock.

He lays the Captain's hat down. Tries to mask his sorrow.

Forces himself to leave, heads down the stairs.

INT. M'S CELL - SAME

M works quickly.  She pops open the back of the clock and

takes out the batteries.  She pries off the tops with a key

and connects the wires to the LOCATOR CARD...

INT. DYE FACTORY - SAME

The Radio Operator touches his earpiece...

He writes the coordinates down.  Bond picks them up.

He takes the coordinates over to the map and DRAWS A

CORRESPONDING LINE across it.

Christmas reads them out as the Operator writes them down

Bond draws another line across the map. At the point at which

the intersect...a small island in the Bosphorus.

Suddenly Bond's instinct are aroused.  Out of the corner of

his eye, he sees THE BOA set something on the ground and move

slowly UP THE STAIRS.

Bond looks at the pack he left on the ground...

He grabs Christmas and HURLS HER TO THE FLOOR.

KABOOM!

A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rips the place apart.  In half a second

the air is thick with coloured dust and drifting clumps of

burning silk.

Bond stands.  Christmas is stunned, but okay.  He looks

around at the others - few dead, all out for the count, among

them, Zukovsky.

Bond heads for the door after the Boa.

Bond runs out, into

EXT. STREET - DAY

Teeming with people, his eyes scanning, he spots...THE BOA

climbing a ladder alongside a building to A ROOF.

Bond chases after him, clambering up, but when he gets to the

top of the roof...

Boa has now been joined by THREE THUGS.  One attacks Bond as

the Boa and the others move away...

Bond fights with the thug, they stumble across the roof,

gripping each other, until Bond gets the upper hand and

THROWS HIM DOWN through a thatched roof where he falls...

EXT. BAZAAR

Into the market below.

Christmas, just coming into the square, sees the body

falling...she runs to the thug, thinking it might be Bond...

But the thug raises up, smiling at her, blood on his teeth.

She turns and runs...the thug gives chase...

ON THE ROOFS ABOVE

Bond is following Boa and the other two men as they LEAP from

roof to roof. He sees them jump off onto the roof of...

EXT. MOVING BUS

Motoring rapidly away from him.  He makes a spectacular leap

to a wobbly FLAG POLE that swings him toward the bus,

dropping him on the roof before it SNAPS BACK, into the

overhead TRAM WIRES ABOVE and setting off sparks.

ON THE BUS

Bond barely gets to his feet before Thug #2 is upon him.

They grapple, struggling to maintain their footing as the bus

speeds through the rickety old streets. He throws the guy

over...

The thug desperately CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF THE BUS...

Bond now takes on the third thug, unaware that number two has

climbed back on and is about to WHACK HIM ON THE HEAD with

his gun when...

THE BUS TURNS onto a new street...THE WIRES AGAIN...Thug

Two's gun is caught up in them...he is instantly

ELECTROCUTED.

Thug three watches his friend's horrible death, giving Bond

time to slug him hard across the face and THROW HIM FROM THE

BUS...

EXT. STREET

Thug two's body goes SLAMMING INTO THE WINDSHIELD of a fast

moving van...BURSTS OUT through the back doors of said van

and tumbles out onto the street where it is HIT BY A CAR.

ON THE BUS

Bond turns back toward...BOA. Now it is just the two of them.

The bus is hissing to a stop.

The Boa leaps on to the bed of a passing truck.  Bond rushes

forward and leaps on to the top of a passing taxi.  The taxi

jams on his breaks and Bond rolls across the bonnet and on to

the street.  He springs to his feet.

Fifty yards ahead the truck carrying the Boa has stopped for

traffic.  The Boa jumps out and darts into an alley.

EXT. ISTANBUL - ALLEY - DAY

The Alley leads into a small CAFE where PATRONS smoke water

pipes and drink coffee.  The Boa is nowhere to be seen.

Bond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his

leg so as not to alarm the civilians.  He steps into the

cafe.

EXT. ISTANBUL - CAFE - DAY

Bond makes his way through the tables to the doorway in the

back.  He looks inside - just a few children  at play.  Bond

is suddenly blind-sided by a vicious kidney punch which

brings him to his knees.  He struggles to bring up his gun -

but the Boa knocks it out of his hand.

The Boa locks Bond's head in an unbreakable choke hold from

behind.  Bond pulls on the massive arms - but to no avail.

He glances down to his right - HIS GUN - just out of reach.

Bond reaches out for it - his fingers just graze it.

Suddenly the Boa's foot kicks out, knocking the gun across

the room.  He tighten his grip and speaks in Bond's ear.

Bond can't breathe, his eyes start to dim.  He slumps

forward, his left hand touches something hot.  It's the iron

basket of coals used to keep the water pipes lite.  Bond's

fingers touch the wire handle that arches across the top.  He

grabs it and with his last reserves -

Swings it at the back of his head hitting the Boa on the side

of the head with the SOUND OF RAW BACON HITTING A HOT

SKILLET.

The Boa drops Bond and leaps to his feet holding the side of

his face.  Bond falls forward fighting for breath and trying

to clear his head.

The Boa runs out the back door.  Bond finds his gun, holsters

it and follows.

EXT. ISTANBUL - SIDE STREET - DAY

Bond comes out into a side street crowded with VENDERS AND

SHOPPERS.  Bond sees the Boa pushing his way through the

crowd to...

EXT. ISTANBUL - FERRY TERMINAL - DAY

RUSSIAN TRAMP STEAMER taking on cargo.  Bond enters square in

time to see the Boa making a Bee line for the Russian

steamer.

As the Boa, much the worse-for-ware, starts up the gangway to

the top deck of the steamer, Bond hitches a ride on a cargo

net that is being hoisted aboard by the ship's boom.

EXT. RUSSIAN STEAMER - DAY

Boa, breathing hard gets to the deck.  He lumbers across it

but before he can reach the other side he is tripped up by

Bond who has been waiting for him by the side of the deck

house.  The Boa goes sprawling.  As Bond comes for him he

scrambles to his feet, grabs a nearby bailing hook, and

swings at Bond.  But Bond is ready for him.  He wards off the

blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate.  He

traps the Boa's arm and gives him two quick devastating kicks

in the solar plexus.  He Boa stages back to the railing.  A

final kick from Bond sends him over the side...

THE BOA FALLS, LANDING ON HIS BACK ON THE DECK BELOW WITH A

SICKENING THUD.

Bond looks down, sees the Boa's body at a horrible angle, his

neck broken.

Bond sighs, turns...

GABOR is there. Gun trained on him.

BOND'S P.O.V.  A thug steps into sight below, holding

CHRISTMAS hostage as well.

EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY

A magnificent ornate tower in the centre of the Bosphorus.

An innocent-looking launch coasts up to it.  A tarp is raised

and Bond and Christmas are revealed, hands bound.  They are

helped out, led inside by a number of henchmen.

INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY

Elektra crosses the hallway as the doors open.  Kisses Bond

on the cheek as she eyes Christmas.

Christmas eyes Bond anew as Elektra leads him to an ornately

carved chair, covered in silk.

Bond and Christmas exchange a look as the guards start her

towards some steps.

Elektra indicates for him to sit.  Behind him, the whole of

Istanbul is visible through a large curved window.

Bond ignores her.

This cuts. She casually reaches behind his neck, flips up a

wooden arm to which is attached a metal collar.  A GAROTTE.

Bond recoils as she fastens the collar...  She steps back.

Bond keeps his cool:

She moves to the back of the chair, twists the screw ONE

NOTCH.  The effect on Bond is instantaneous as a bolt jolts

into the back of his neck, tilts his head back.

She pulls the jewel from her ear, reveals the ugly scar:

She turns the screw again.

A flicker of emotion.  Bond is getting to her.

Her eyes are shining.  She moves toward the view, gazing out

at this spectacular cradle of civilization.  Bond works his

wristbinds feverishly.

She eyes him, impressed that he's worked out her plan.

Tightens the screw again.  Her confidence amazing.

Tightening the screw again:

Now she straddles him.  She puts the jewel back on her ear.

All the time, he's working that wristbind.

She smiles, twists the screw again.  A nasty, grinding sound.

Sweat trickles from his brow.  She licks it away.

She pushes her hips into his.  Turns the screw.  The bolt is

jammed right into the back of his neck.  His face is angled

upwards.  Breathing is difficult.  He glares up:

She fingers the bolt.  Prepares to turn it the last

time...His hand strains at its binding...

She begins to turn the screw...

... when SEVERAL GUNSHOTS are heard outside.

Bond is on the edge of consciousness.

Elektra freezes.  Gets off him.  Moves to a window.

EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

HER POV:

Big, battered and bloody, Valentin Zukovsky is leaving a

boat, moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of

his men.  Two bodies in his trail.  He's on course for

Elektra and nothing is going to stop him, even as his

henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire.

INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

Elektra moves to her gun.  Just then, Gabor crashes through a

stained glass window, neck broken.

TWO ELEKTRA HENCHMEN appear from below stairs as the doors

burst open.  Zukovsky stands there.  A bloody giant.

They open up with machine guns, but two shots from Zukovsky

take them out, though he takes one in the shoulder.  Right

now, he's unstoppable.

A shocked silence after the shooting.  He eyes Bond in the

chair.  To the room:

Then his eye falls on the HAT Renard had brought up from

below.  He knows at once what it means.

She picks it up, walks to him (surreptitiously sliding a gun

beneath it).  She proffers the hat...

BLAM BLAM BLAM -- she fires through the hat.

He staggers back.  Stares.  Slumps down.  Lowers his head to

the ground.

She walks over, puts her heel on his gun arm, presses down,

smiling a half-psychotic smile.  The gun is pinned.

Zukovsky is dying.

But he dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun

a millimetre off the ground, his outstretched arm already

pointing at Bond. Elektra looks surprised, then amused as

Zukovsky's finger begins to squeeze the trigger:  he's going

to shoot Bond!

Bond stares back.  Zukovsky's eye narrows -- trying for

extreme accuracy...

BLAM! The SHOT hits the binding at Bond's wrist.  Splinters

the wood there.

ELEKTRA stares at Zukovsky.  She didn't see where the bullet

went, just that it missed Bond.  She watches his head slump

further, staring at Bond...

A look passes between the two men.  Comrades in arms.  The

merest of smiles.  Then the light fades from his eyes.  Dead.

ELEKTRA

turns back to Bond.  Smiles.

She picks up a walkie-talkie, speaks into it:

Lost for a moment, she breathes heavily.  She glances at

Zukovsky's corpse.  Slightly puzzled, to Bond:

And she kisses him -- reaches behind to deliver the killer

twist...

One super-fast movement:

Bond's hand breaks free, grabs her throat, tight.  He holds

her, their faces close together, disdain in his eyes -- hurls

her backwards, her hand scratching at his face.

Ripping the collar from his neck, he gets to his feet.  Moves

to Zukovsky, checks his pulse, takes the bloody gun from his

fingers.

Turns back, to see Elektra disappearing upstairs.  A moment's

dilemma:  should he race below to the sub -- or up to

Elektra?

He takes off after Elektra, grabs the radio handset.

EXT. SUBMARINE - SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - DAY

The submarine's engines roar to life.

INT. TOWER - CONTINUOUS

ELEKTRA rises up one of the triple spiral stairways leading

to the various balconies of the minaret tower.

INT. TOWER/M'S CELL - DAY

Bond stalks up after her.  THEIR VOICES ECHO through the

intertwined stairs:

But Bond isn't wavering.  Clutches Zukovsky's bloody wet gun.

He heads up in the semi-darkness -- and suddenly swings to

his right, at an unexpected but familiar Voice:

Bond kicks open a door and enters...

M'S PRISON ROOM

He fires at the lock on her cell door and frees her. Turns to

go, heading upward, after Elektra.

INT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

Elektra has reached a balcony.  It affords a spectacular view

of Istanbul.  Bond appears, has her cornered.

He holds the walkie-talkie to her mouth.

She looks at him seriously.  He's giving her a last chance,

willing her to save herself and the city.

Bond waits...

And her face breaks into a perverted grin and --

BLAM!  Bond shoots her.

She staggers back, shocked at her own mortality.

He looks out:

EXT. BOSPHORUS - DAY

Sees the nose of the sub heading into the Bosphorus, half

submerged.  The hatch is still open.

INT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

He stares at her dead body a beat. And then, he crouches. He

touches her cheek, just once, before he goes.

Behind him, unbeknownst, M has seen it all.

EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY

He moves to the ledge. Composes himself -- and

DIVES ONE HUNDRED FEET to the water.  Amazing.

EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - DAY

He surfaces close to the exiting sub.  Grabs a ladder, pulls

himself up.

The hatch is closing...  He splashes through the water

flooding over the sub, appears in front of the amazed sailor

shutting the hatch.  WHACKS him with the hatch.  Gets inside.

Closes it.  Milliseconds before the hatch slides under the

water.

INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

Bond down below. Renard's crew are spread throughout the sub.

He creeps through...

Approaches one man working some levers, smoking.  Bond holds

his gun to his head.

INT. CABIN, SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER

A few SOLID BANGS on the metal of Christmas' door.  It opens

and Bond lets the now unconscious man hit the deck.  That was

his head banging.

He takes her by the hand, they move through the shadows of

the sub.

INT. SUBMARINE - MOMENTS LATER

A man is operating the tanks.  Through the intercom:

The man does as told.  When he's finished -- Bond knocks him

out with the butt of his gun.

INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Several men occupy the central control room, Renard at their

centre.  Beyond, on the other side, the outer chamber of the

reactor.

INT. OTHER END OF CONTROL ROOM - SUBMARINE - DAY

From the other end of the control room, Bond and Christmas,

so near and yet so far -- they can't get to the reactor

because there are so many men in there.

Keeping behind cover:

INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE LOWER DECK - MOMENTS LATER

Bond and Christmas get attacked.  A vicious, silent fight...

Then the radio set sparks into life --

Bond is throttling the man with the cable.  Speaks into the

handset.

But the man has stretched his hand to a fire alarm:

The KLAXON RESOUNDS.

INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Renard looks up.

He flicks a switch;

INTERCUT:

BOND ON AN INTERCOM:

His voice fills the control room.

Renard responds, into the microphone.

Renard's face screws up in pain more searing than any he

could feel in his skin...he SCREAMS...

INT. SUBMARINE...

The scream, like a wounded animal, echoes throughout the

doomed craft.

BACK ON RENARD, gasping, spent.

He strides through to the

INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

Jams shut the hatch behind him.  Now moves through to the

INT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR

Where he picks up the PLUTONIUM. Moves back into the

INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

Sealing the other door behind him.  And now he opens up the

cover of the glaring REACTOR...

INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

Christmas sees a panel light up:

Bond reads off more lights...

Thinking fast, Bond moves to some controls.  Hits switches.

INT. AIR TANKS, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

The air tanks immediately filling with water.

INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

Christmas and Bond shift to the side.  Everything not screwed

down starts sliding...

EXT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS - LONG SHOT

The submarine is tilting, further and further, the nose

dropping down and down...

Pretty soon we have the strange and incredible sight of a

submarine hanging vertically, nose down.

INT. REACTOR CHAMBER, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

Renard hangs on, swings, until he can get a footing on the

nearest wall.

INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

Bond and Christmas hang on too, get a grip.  He helps her up.

INT. REACTOR CHAMBER, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

Renard is disturbed by the sub's position, but only

momentarily.

He moves to an intercom:

INT. TORPEDO ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bond hears a creak, turns to see the tubes open -- water

gushes up toward them at an incredible rate.

He pulls Christmas up and they ascend to the next level.  No

chance to seal the chamber though, the water is already

through the hatch.

INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Renard now struggles back up to the reactor, stares into the

violet blue heat...

He hits a button.  A ROD slowly rises out of the reactor.

INT. LOWER SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

Bond and Christmas are ahead of the water.  They have reached

a level where various systems are operated from.

He punches buttons.

EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - CONTINUOUS

High up on the sub, a hatch opens.  Water floods into an

escape hatch.  An inner door stops it getting into the

submarine itself.

INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Renard slowly inserts the plutonium rod.  Immediately the

light around him becomes a deeper blue, a horrible

luminescence.  The staccato click of a distant Geiger counter

intensifies.

INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

As Bond opens the inner door of an ESCAPE HATCH, he points

out a cabinet on the wall to Christmas.

She opens the box to find the RE-BREATHERS are ripped to

shreds.  No-one was ever meant to get off the sub.  She shows

Bond.

He climbs into the escape chamber.

She moves over and seals the door, wrenches a lever which

immediately floods the chamber with water.

INT. ESCAPE HATCH - CONTINUOUS

Inside the chamber, Bond holds his breath as water seeps in.

The most claustrophobic thing you've ever seen.

INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

A green light comes on and Christmas punches a button...

EXT. SUBMARINE, ESCAPE HATCH - CONTINUOUS

The OUTER DOOR opens...  Bond burst out and starts the long

swim up the OUTSIDE OF THE SUBMARINE...

INT. SUBMARINE - SAME

Christmas is counting.

EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER

It's dark out here.  It would be very easy for Bond to get

disoriented.

He peers around, trying to get his bearings against the vast

vertical whale he's swimming up.

Passes the conning tower.

INT. SUBMARINE

EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER

Bond is running out of air...

And then he sees it -- the open hatch of the rear escape

door.

He gets inside, yanks it closed...

INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

Christmas, shivering in the rising water.

She presses a button...

INT. CHAMBER BEYOND (NOW ABOVE) REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

The hatch opens and Bond collapses out in a gush of water.

The hatch closes.

The whole world is at a crazy angle here. Bond looks down at

the sealed door of the reactor chamber, curses.

INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Bathed in the horrible light of the over-heating reactor,

Renard looks upwards, aware of sounds on the other side of

the door...

KER-BLAM!  A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.

The door shoots off its hinge, blasted by Bond.

Bond drops down into the chamber, takes one look at Renard,

now a crumpled heap in the corner.

Bond moves down to the next door, opens it:

And there she is, struggling, the water level way below still

rising...

He lowers an arm, pulls her up.

They clamber up to the reactor:

INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

BOND'S POV: in the intense glow inside -- the overheating

rod, protruding slightly.

INT. REACTOR CHAMBER

Bond looks at the gauges from behind a thick GLASS SHIELD.

Christmas comes up level with him:

THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE READS 4500 AND RISING...

He starts toward the reactor when suddenly

RENARD IS BEHIND BOND, THROTTLING HIM.

CHRISTMAS grabs at him, is flung back, nearly falls through

the hatch but manages to grab a pipe, hangs on for dear life.

THE GAUGE HITS 4700

BOND AND RENARD

struggle...  Both slamming into switches and buttons.

OMITTED 314-316

INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS

THE GAUGE IS PASSING 4900, EDGING TOWARDS THE NO-WAY-BACK

5000 MARK.  Meltdown imminent...

He looks down the sub -- more water racing upward...

Back to the pile.  Scans the scene, searching for an idea.

Sees a HOSE, compressed air escaping from a fissure.  Thinks

fast.  Grabs the hose, snaps it free...

RENARD

is recovering, has found a FLARE GUN near him.  Raises it to

Bond...

BOND'S POV

in the reflection of the gauge (which is millimeters from

5000), we see Renard approaching from behind us...

BOND jams the hose into the reactor, ducks down -- as the air

blows the rod out - narrowly missing him as it shoots past --

impales Renard in the heart, just before he could shoot.

Renard stares at Bond in horror.  Bond calmly takes the flare

gun off him.

And he lets him fall past Christmas, through consecutive open

hatches of the sub, crashing into the rising water.

Christmas looks down at the floating corpse.

Bond watches the gauge -- as it edges DOWN from 5000.

The nuclear disaster looks like it's averted.  But suddenly

water is gushing in from above, through splits in the sub's

shell; it's going to sink.

But she won't come.  As water courses over them:

She moves to the reactor, closing the cover.  Bond uses his

strength to push the heavy locking mechanism into place.

Bond climbs upwards, dragging Christmas with him.

INT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

They clamber into the next chamber up...

EXT. SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - CONTINUOUS

The submarine is slowly sinking, nose down.  Air is escaping

from the many seams that are creeping apart.  We can hear the

metallic GROANS through the water.

INT. TORPEDO ROOM

Bond and Christmas crawl into TORPEDO CHAMBERS...

Bond reaches out, setting a timer to FIRE...

The clock ticks down...

EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER BOSPHORUS - DAY

The Torpedo doors open and Bond and Christmas are SHOT OUT

INTO THE WATER, streaking through, as behind them...

THE SUBMARINE EXPLODES in spectacular fashion.

EXT. SURFACE, BOSPHORUS - DAY

Bond and Christmas reach the surface...  Look around them.

No boats coming to the rescue.  They wave to a tourist boat

passing.

The boat heads over to pick them up...

OMIT 324

EST. SHOT - MI-6 - NIGHT

The damaged wing is being repaired.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME

Tanner overseeing things, and then...

M walks in.  Efficient and steely as ever.  All eyes turn to

her.  She looks at everyone...makes the briefest of nods.

That is all the sentiment allowed as business resumes.

She scans the machines:

EXT. ROOF, ISTANBUL - NIGHT

A magnificent rooftop garden looking out over Istanbul.

Christmas and Bond alone with some Bollinger.

FIREWORKS explode above. They clink glasses.  He looks out at

the cityscape.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

Tanner and Q look at a SATELLITE THERMAL IMAGE OF ISTANBUL.

The satellite image zooms in one particular car parked in a

side street.  We can just make out Bond's ASTON MARTIN.

M comes over.

The image moves from the car, closes on the garden rooftop.

The thermal image is multi-coloured, difficult to decipher.

And he points to ONE orange figure lying on the rooftop.

They all look back to the image.  The figure is turning RED,

almost glowing.

Tanner, Q and M realize as one that this is an image of two

people, one atop the other.  And getting hotter.

Q switches the screen off, clears his throat.

EXT. ROOF, ISTANBUL - CONTINUOUS

It's dark, we can't really see them.

THE END
