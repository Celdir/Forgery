The kids all lean forward and squirm as they try and get

closer to the pictures. MISS ROSS, the pretty twenty five

year old teacher watches from the side.

Pretty much all the kids get in on this now. Everyone wants

to see Fleury's gun. Fleury makes eyes at Miss Ross. She's

giving him a `no fucking way' hard eye.

This silences the class. Miss Ross keeps things moving,

pointing to a photo.

Mick's hand goes back up.

A beat. Lyla and Ron look down at Kevin, stalled...

We hear Fran's voice as though we're on the line with him:

raspy-ragged, like he's been crying.

Fleury's demeanor shifts to HARD immediately.

Fleury looks at the kids eating and laughing.

Fleury smiles best he can at his Son. Into the phone:

Fleury hangs up, walks to Kevin, kneels down - oblivious to

everyone watching.

Kisses his boy's forehead hard.

JANET MAYES, 29 years-old, stifles a sob in the front row.

Fleury steps from behind the podium, puts a hand gently on

Janet's shoulder, leans in and whispers something no one but

Janet hears. Whatever his words, they give back her

composure. She nods.

Fleury lets the news absorb as he steps back to the podium.

No one says a thing. Fleury lifts his eyes again, real

trouble maintaining control...

GRANT SYKES. 50 years-old. Virginia State Trooper before

joining the FBI. Law-and-order formidable: sharp-smart

Charlottesville accent. Studies the images for a beat...

ADAM LEAVITT. 34 years-old, sought-after Investigator.

There's a constant, intense grind to this guy, a mind and

mouth incapable of quiet. He paces around the room, then

eagle-eyes the bomb images... starts surge-scrawling crude

diagrams of the blast site on a piece of loose leaf. Feels

more like nervous doodling than work. Not looking up from his

drawing:

Fleury circles Leavitt's name on the roster. Leavitt never

stops drawing.

Another great question. Fleury looks over to AGENT #1 on his

immediate right, an egg-head type with a big binder in front

of him. Everyone's eyes follow. Agent #1 flips quickly

through the binder, back-and-forth, searching. Fleury crosses

his name off of his roster. Then:

Everyone smells it: that's big -- more proof these attacks

are being carried out by one, very skilled Terror Cell.

Fleury circles Mayes' name on the ERT roster.

Fleury checks from his notes.

Al-Ghazi interrupts.

Another nod, another crack. Al-Ghazi, flinching, becomes more

alert.

General Malik in Haytham's face:

Janet stares at Young, looking mildly in over her head.

Grace sits, nods to Fleury: you're up...

Young just stares at Fleury kind of odd like a kid staring at

a mushroom flavored Popsicle.

Fleury continues:

Stoic nods from each. Ellis Leach raises his hand, a tone

that's worlds away from Young's.

Gideon Young remembers, nods along solemnly.

Motions to Maricella: the floor is yours.

Young stands: we're done. Fleury's look: that's it? Young's

already collecting his briefcase, jacket-

Meeting seems over. Not quite. Fleury can't keep his mouth

shut.

Young, eyes on a Republican-gold Rolex, instantly perturbed

the meeting isn't ending.

Eyes migrate to Fleury --

Fleury looks to Mayes. She clears her throat. Delivers the

following with utter precision.

Fleury studies Janet with solid respect. He gives Janet a

subtle nod: "Nice work."

38   EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY                                  38

Fleury digesting Grace's words: moments pass. Then he looks

down next to them.

The three turn as Fleury approaches. Walking fast, clear

sense of purpose.

His left hand hand wrapped around the stock of an Mp-5

machine gun. Fleury takes in a deep breath: let's see who

this guy is.

Small laughs.

Fleury nods to Sykes, giving him the go to start in with the

Bad Cop. Throughout the following exchange, we stay TIGHT ON

FLEURY: in control, using Sykes to ask the questions he

"diplomatically" does not want to ask.

Janet looks to Leavitt, then Fleury: `what did he say?'

Fleury looks to Sykes, `Keep going...'

Fleury is about to step in when-

A truck 200 yards ahead in the middle of an abrupt U-turn.

Over the median. Dust cloud. Heading back our way. Something

big in the truck's bed. Our vehicle shimmies as Al-Ghazi

flinches, drops his prayer beads. Mp-5 up to the Colonel's

sight-line, muzzle tracking the truck. Leavitt leans away

from his window as the vehicles pass: streetlights show two

farmers, a camel sitting in the bed. Missed their left turn.

A long, nearly comical moment.

Fleury cycling through different angles. Continues:

Al-Ghazi getting tired of the questions: exhausted himself.

No answer.

Young finally makes eye contact: expecting something like

fear, remorse, back-pedalling...

Young's face flashes red, seething:

Young apoplectic now: ready to end the Director right there,

when Grace leans in, lets the vague threat of physical

contact manifest.

Janet's area made obvious with a floral partition. She

immediately folds it, puts it into a corner. Haytham watches

her undo his work.

Al-Ghazi and Haytham leave. The doors close behind them, then

the sound of a key turning in a lock. The Americans look on,

half-disbelief, half-comedy: locking us in.

Silence as the crew digests this odd little verbal outage.

Everyone hits their own bags first.

Fleury pulls out his laptop, wakes it up from sleep mode.

Eyes a photo of Kevin on his desktop, picks up the phone.

A BEAT as Lyla passes the phone to Kevin.

A Beat...

68   EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - 4:30 AM                    68

Fleury stares at this freak show. Schmidt sticks out a paw.

PRINCE BIN KHALED and his INNER-CIRCLE exit a Suburban and

approach: All in traditional dress. The Prince locks eyes

with Fleury.

IN THE BG, forklifts rumble-hiss to life, placing Jersey

barriers around the community center.

One of the inner-circle, without a word, takes off the FBI-

emblazoned windbreaker worn by Leavitt and places it on a

short-sleeved Janet. Careful not to touch skin.

Only then does Prince Bin Khaled approach. A lone

PHOTOGRAPHER follows: snapping pictures. Different

definitions of personal space: four inches separation as Bin

Khaled greets each Team member in accented English. Janet

last: the pictures suddenly stop. The Prince gives a little

curtsy, no words, steps back to Fleury: the pictures re-

start. Bin Khaled holds Fleury's hand sixth-grade boyfriend-

style.

Motions to the Americans. No more unflattering a portrait:

pre-coffee, post-twelve hour flight, hours unpacking...

As the cameras start flashing. Angle on Al-Ghazi and Haytham

placed to stand next to the Americans. Haytham clearly not

comfortable with this kind of attention.

The Prince turns back to the convoy. Entire entourage

follows. One of the Security Contractors catches the jacket

Janet hurls back at him, tosses it to Leavitt. Convoy gone.

The team turns: 100 glares again. Fleury blinks out the

camera flashes, takes in all the eyeballs.

Fleury looks up at a retreating Damon Schmidt.

Dead eyes from Fleury. He's clearly not amused.

He points a finger gun at Fleury.

SCHMIDT takes off. Sykes by Fleury.

Haytham walks off by himself, shaking off the shady Royal

photo vibe, looking back at the Americans. From behind him:

Haytham turns. An older POLICE OFFICER stands with a GROUP of

SANG twenty feet behind him, eyeing Haytham.

Back to Fleury: he looks to Al-Ghazi.

Fleury tries to remain cool.

Al-Ghazi ignores Fleury.

Leavitt looks around at the Security as Al-Ghazi hustles off:

The Team slowly realizes they're not going anywhere yet, dump

their bags in a pile, already disgusted.

In the distance, the group of SANG stare back at our team.

Sykes looks over to Fleury. Crooked smile.

Al-Ghazi ignores Sykes.

Al-Ghazi motions to 50 MEN in uniforms different than his:

SANG troops digging, bagging evidence, marking the scene with

red-flags.

The Team: so we're on Tour. Fleury still silent.

Fleury finally speaks, asking the most important question:

Al-Ghazi points to a Man we've seen before, General Abdul-

Malik. Haytham's Interrogator. He pours over a table 20 feet

away: maps, blueprints, utility schematics spread before him.

Starting to get heated.

Beat. As Al-Ghazi stabilizes...

A stand off. Fleury eyes Al-Ghazi. Trying to figure this guy

out.

Sees something that looks like a flash of embarrassment in Al-

Ghazi's eyes: unable to perform his profession, relegated to

Tour Guide. Leavitt begins taking notes. Haytham sees his

notebook, snaps his fingers at Al-Ghazi who looks, nods: let

him.

A moment as Earl and Janine get a bit defensive:

Al-Ghazi sees Janine smile, squeeze Earl's hand tighter.

Earl's mother Maddy looks at Fleury, pets the cat.

73   EXT. JACKSON HOME - SAME MOMENT                            73

Al-Ghazi quietly backs away, walks away. Fleury looks after

him, turns back to Mr. Jackson who stares after Al-Ghazi:

hate. Fleury unsure what to do next.

Jackson remembers the warning he just spoke...

Fresh tears re-animate his face:

77   EXT. DESERTED STREET, AL-RAHMAH - MOMENTS LATER            77

Fleury is moving around the scene, restaging the shoot out.

Instantly lining up the angles.

Leavitt's taking digital snaps of the shattered Land Cruiser.

Through the viewfinder: the caved-in door. Two snaps.

A SANG passes Adam, his gun aimed a touch high.

So Sergeant Haytham speaks English...

Fleury's thinking, looking into the car. Searching the

horizon, he spots a distant apartment building providing a

view of the crime scene.

On Fleury: he looks back at the homes, then up and around: He

locks on the OBSERVATION BUILDING in the distance.

Fleury points to one particular building.

Al-Ghazi looks up to the building. Back to Fleury.

-Officer reaches down from nowhere and hammers Al-Ghazi open-

handed as Al-Ghazi tries to step past. Collective shock.

In that breath, Haytham punishes the Officer with a left-

cross: knees buckle before he comprehends what hit him.

Haytham's kick follows, catches the Officer in the sternum as

he hits ground.

Al-Ghazi shakes it out, trades blows with the SANG second in-

command.

Leavitt moves, catches a rifle butt to the shoulder after two

steps. Fleury aims, drills the Soldier that butted Leavitt:

instant night-night. Another SANG steps up. Fleury throats

him, knee caps him, and grabs his weapon before the dude hits

the ground.

Fleury can obviously fight... all the above happens in four

seconds.

Then, a `knock-it-off' gunshot aimed at the sky pops one-foot

from Janet's head. We hear what she hears: one half-second of

the shot, then the big ring. On her knees immediately, hand

over her ear. In response: heavy-caliber gunfire flies: group

flinch-n-crouch. The warning shots from a .50-caliber mounted

on a Humvee racing this way from Al-Rahmah: dust plumes from

the speed. Members of the security detail and the Special

Forces go Mexican stand-off.

82   EXT. ROOF TOP - CONTINUOUS                                    82

Fleury's studying the housing compound through a video

camera, comparing the images on his camera with what he saw

posted on the internet.

Al-Ghazi takes the camera from Fleury. He lines up the same

shots we saw posted on Leavitt's computer: clearly a match.

This is where they shot the video

Another long moment. Al-Ghazi looks at the table, discarded

trash: the Capri Sun containers, the candy wrappers.

Al-Ghazi quiet for a long while. Then he reciprocates:

Fleury looks over to the two dozen LOCALS peering out with

suspicion at them on the rooftop.

Fleury smiles small at whatever just passed between them. Al-

Ghazi stays stoic, then looks straight at Fleury:

Al-Ghazi pauses.

Al-Ghazi stands still, silent. Fleury reaches into his

pocket. Reveals the detonator to Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi reaches

to take it. Fleury holds it for a BEAT...

He hands the detonator to Al-Ghazi.    Al-Ghazi now pockets it.

A BEAT...

Fleury just nods back.

Fleury looks over to Janet. Hurt, yet extremely defiant, she

looks ready to attack anything that comes near her.

When I bull-rush our hosts you'll know it: In his quiet, calm-

amidst-the-bullets tone:

Pin-drop silence in response to Fleury murdering the Prince's

"lite subjects," his attempt to extend the gilded circle-jerk

by offering tours. Bin Khaled's face sinks to gray again

after the excited pink of talking about his Falcons. His hand

slowly moves back over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. As

Fleury speaks, people unconsciously put their tea-cups down,

look up at him with wide-eyes.

The Prince stares at Fleury, cataloguing everything Fleury

just said. Stands. In Arabic:

As the Prince walks out with Al-Ghazi, he signals another

corps of servants to serve another round of cups: coffee.

Dinner over. A servant takes the Falcon from Leavitt just as

he was starting to smile at it.

Fleury sips his coffee. Schmidt and Sykes approach.

Fleury opens his mouth to interrupt.

That's dead on accurate. Very

impressive. That's why they're

making it hard on us, and that's

why he wants to help `em turn the

screws.

They can have every shred of credit-

-you see the slums on the way in?

Yeah.

See that even though their homes

are falling down, they had

satellite dishes bolted on?

Yeah...

Everyone already knows you're here.

Credit? If the Saudis cracked this

Cell while these servants were

pouring coffee, Al-Jazeera still

leads the story with your Team.

Have you been to the crime-scene?

No-

-if you had, you'd see the evil

work of real Talent. The kind that

doesn't stop until it's forced.

And the path to Hell is paved with

good intentions.

You having fun?

Beats hell outta visa-stamping.

Fleury puts the three photographs down on the dining room

table: not pretty pictures. Earl and Janine study the photos.

A few moments, then:

Fleury thinks a minute. Looks outside.

Pause: Fleury slow nods, then...

TIME CUT:

Maddy up at the dinning room table, looking down at the

photos.

Maddy thinking...

Aaron Jackson begins shaking his head yes. Tears flow free:

sorrow and gratitude. He hangs on to Fleury's hand for a very

long time. Silent apologies.

Fleury quiet.

Fleury turns his head: Al-Ghazi approaches on the next lawn

down with three JUNIOR OFFICERS. Fleury nods goodbye to

Jackson.

Fleury approaches Al-Ghazi, holds up the Shooter's photo.

Fleury - a slight nod of satisfaction.

SERIES OF SHOTS:

A two car convoy drives deep into the city.

The Convoy is forced to stop across the street from a gas

station as a construction crane backs into a drive way.

Al-Ghazi and Fleury stare across the street as a large gas

truck fills up the heavy tanks of a Saudi gas station.

Al-Ghazi smiles.

Fleury stares out as the oil spills out overflowing from the

station tank.

Subdued laughter. Then Talal becomes quiet, grave. Al-Ghazi

continues the translation:

Talal looks at Fleury now, speaking directly to him through

Al-Ghazi:

Colonel Al-Ghazi hesitates, then relays Fleury's question.

Talal stares: eyes touched by war-blood-atrocities committed.

Someone who believes he's going to Hell.

Two TEENAGERS stick their heads into the office. They're mad

about the sharing of a computer. Talal puts a fast stop to

it. It's obvious he's good with these young boys. He smiles

as he speaks to Al-Ghazi.

Al-Ghazi translates to Fleury.

Al-Ghazi shows Talal the detonator. The old man studies it.

Al-Ghazi and Talal speak in Arabic about the detonator.

Al-Ghazi looks to Fleury, translates.

Al-Ghazi asks Talal.

He thinks for a moment, then speaks. The boys chuckle as Al-

Ghazi continues translating:

Fleury looks at Al-Ghazi, doesn't quite get it...

Talal slowly stands, Al-Ghazi helping him up, moves to

Fleury. Reaches his hand out to him, quietly:

Al-Ghazi begins tossing the room, motions to Fleury: help.

Fleury moves to him.

Al-Ghazi dumps desk drawers: pictures of government-looking

buildings, walled-compounds. Lays them out in rows, studying

each. Leavitt appears, focuses on the C-4 immediately.

Everybody looks at the Colonel, pointing at the pictures:

Leavitt steps, scans the pictures, picks up two in

particular: buildings with scaffolding and heavy equipment.

Janet pops her head in:

Al-Ghazi's face: fear.

112   INT. TARGETED HOUSE - NEXT MOMENT                             112

Janet's voice causes Schmidt to immediately force composure.

Pissed, reproachful head-shakes.

The phone rings that instant. Leavitt hands it up to Fleury.

Schmidt holds his hand up to Janet: high-five -- she gives it

up slowly, warily, semi-charmed:

113   INT. SUBURBAN - LATER                                       113

In the back, Al-Ghazi can't help a small smile either.

Fleury's not into it. All business, pissed, clearly does not

want Pabst.

Fleury looks at Al-Ghazi. He knows the win is small. Also

knows that's all she wrote, for now.

The POLICE BAND suddenly squelches loud with excited Arabic.

Everyone perks, leans up to listen to the urgency.

A small collective smirk, sigh of relief. Fleury turns in his

seat.

121   EXT. HIGHWAY ATTACK AFTERMATH - NEXT MOMENT                 121

Fleury begins sawing Grant's seat-belt with a jagged piece of

metal.

Sykes still does, ugly. Fleury and Janet rip him free of the

Suburban.

Haytham's pulling shotguns, handguns, ammo from the flipped

vehicle. Haytham pointing ahead, to the fading roster-tail.

In Arabic:

Desperate, Fleury looks in the direction of the fleeing

Suburban: the rooster-tail it leaves getting smaller. Al-

Ghazi nods, swings his head to thesnarled/wrecked highway

traffic. PEOPLE hesitantly step toward uniforms they trust on

instinct. Haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the Team's

feet, re-loads his 9MM. Janet ties a half-assed tourniquet

around Sykes' reminder of an arm.

Al-Ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd: they see his

state, his gun, and turn back: panic starts to infect the

larger mass, then the topper-

-AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from somewhere. Glass-dirt-metal bursts

around us: this attack is still going.

Fleury looks up: just the roof of an old Mercedes on the

median, dirt kicked up behind them, running behind lines of

stopped-wrecked traffic now. The barrel of a rifle held high

out the window like a taunt. Accelerating for another opening

to finish the job.

Scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists. Many have

abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert, the rest

go smash-'em-up derby-folly: 50 panicked drivers aiming for

the same spots. Fleury snatches an M4A1 from the stack

dropped by Haytham, up to his shoulder, hustling toward the

next break in traffic. The Mercedes is approaching at 80 MPH.

Al-Ghazi starts screaming in Arabic, motioning frantically to

the CITIZENS who have turned back, running toward them, in

Arabic:

Fleury's view blocked by fleeing Saudis: just intermittent

flashes of the Mercedes braking hard, massive dust cloud

behind them, sliding toward the opening Fleury pre-sighted.

Intermittent wild shots fired from the SUV, vaguely in our

direction.

Fleury flips a switch on the left side of the rifle, just

forward of the handle: full-auto. Takes a deep, measured

Sniper's breath, eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his

right eye, and without hesitation lets loose the entire clip

perfectly: one heartbeat before the Mercedes hits the gap.

The right side of the Mercedes shreds just as it appears.

Fleury's clip gone in a flash, yet more rounds still hit the

Mercedes: Al-Ghazi four feet away, firing his own salvo from

a knee. Something bright red pops against the driver's side

window now, the Mercedes rip-slides to a stop. Commotion

inside. Wild, half-aimed shots back at us.

Then it starts up again. Al-Ghazi bolts toward the line of

stopped traffic. Searching for something big, empty, still

running. Fleury right on his heels.

Early 90's Land Rover. Desert tough. Driver long-gone,

exhaust plumes pumping out. Al-Ghazi dives into the Driver's

seat, Fleury shotgun. Guns it to the rest of the Survivors,

an eye on the rooster-tail of the Mercedes he and Fleury just

shredded, heading the same direction as Leavitt's kidnappers.

Al-Ghazi jumps out, ushers Haytham into the Driver's seat. In

Arabic:

Fleury helps Sykes into the rear. Janet loads the weapons.

Jump in.

The Land Rover spits it's own tell-tale plume as it sprints

away down the median, dodging traffic, in desperate pursuit.

Startling silence comes sudden now as the fight moves

elsewhere. Receding engines. Petering screams/shouts.

Little One trembles. One of the women in the corner calls to

her in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her

little bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a

gift for you.

Janet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a

marble...

Al-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things.

Immediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER

staring right back at him. We now see the old man clearly. Al-

Ghazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out...

The old man nods a `no.'

Al-Ghazi rips Grandfather up now. The family screams. Al-

Ghazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing

fingers. Bends at the knees to look the Old Man right in his

eyes, lifts his chin with his hand.

The old man looks up at Al-Ghazi: rage and defiance.

ABU HAMZA stares, hatred burning into Al-Ghazi.

Al-Ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15

year-old Grandson, firing a cheap, nickel-plated 9MM.

Everybody drops. The family huddles that much closer to the

floor. Al-Ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling Grandfather

with him.

Father and son throwing the ball back and forth.

Fleury stops, just staring at his little son. Tosses back the

ball.

Fleury catches the ball, stares at his son.

TIGHT ON FLEURY: He reaches and pulls his son close, holding

him for what might just be forever... (alt: He hands Kevin Al-

Ghazi's prayer beads.)

Kevin smiles up at his dad.   For the first time in a long

while, Fleury smiles back.

BLACK.
