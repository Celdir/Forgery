EXT. WHEAT FIELD - MORNING

SAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer

sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly,

looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless

wheat field.

Sam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her

shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite

golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in

the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful...

She smiles, and starts walking.

EXT. ARKANSAS HIGHWAY 40 - MORNING

She emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in

Arkansas. Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the

deserted lanes, is a TRUCK STOP.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING

Amongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot is a

white, late-80s model CHEVROLET CELEBRITY. Sam makes her way

across the asphalt toward the vehicle...

INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - MORNING

COREY RICHARDSON (18) is asleep, curled up in the reclined

driver's seat of the car. She awakens when Sam gets in on the

passenger side and slams the door shut.

Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair,

piercings, a little grungy. She rubs the sleep from her eyes,

greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She

finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one.

Corey adjusts her seat. She takes a long drag and chokes,

then spits out the window. She starts the car...

I/E. COREY'S CHEVROLET/HIGHWAY 40, VARIOUS - DAY

Corey's car cruises along the flat, open road. She cranks up

the VOLUME on the car's CASSETTE DECK, nodding her head to

early-90s ALT. ROCK (suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)...

Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery: FARMERS at

work in the fields; a BILLBOARD advertising a local

restaurant; ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash...

She fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane. It

contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and

three SIBLINGS, one of them being a YOUNGSTER. The Youngster

makes a face at Sam as they pass by...

INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - LATER - DAY

Corey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine

start to RATTLE. She sees that the TEMPERATURE GAUGE has hit

the red and her CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is on.

EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/COREY'S CHEVROLET - DAY

By the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway,

steam billows out from under the hood. Sam gets out of the

car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel.

Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the

steam. It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the

inside of the engine with a hammer.

Corey does so.

Sam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward

them. Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down...

The pick-up pulls over ahead of them. CHRIS HOLT (24), a

brawny, attractive young man, gets out. When Corey sees him

she gets out too.

As Chris pokes around under the hood, Sam and Corey exchange

looks. Chris pops opens the COOLANT CAP and burns his hand on

the steam explosion.

I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/EL RENO, VARIOUS - DAY

All three crammed into the cab of the pick-up, they drive

through the center of El Reno, Oklahoma (population 16,000)

and see some of the locals out and about [MUSIC MONTAGE

fueled by early- to mid-90s era GRUNGE ROCK (suggestion: Come

As You Are, by Nirvana) -- reminiscent of the `Middlesex

Middle School Montage' in DONNIE DARKO]:

AGATHA DOWDY (54), an employee of the local DINER, sits on a

bench in front of the establishment smoking a cigarette. The

manager, TED MONCTON (50), calls her back inside...

RANDY EVANS (21), RUTH GIBBENS (18) and JEFF (21) and MIKE

JIMENEZ (20) loiter in the parking lot of a LIQUOR STORE...

TRUDY POTTER (39) flirts with FATHER HOMEIJER (54), a

Catholic priest, outside the BANK. A BANK SIGN shows the TIME

-- 12:00 PM -- then flashes to the DATE -- JUNE 18, 1995...

OFFICER RYAN O'DELL (31) has pulled over a PRETTY LADY and

uses his uniform to impress more than intimidate...

They come up on VIETNAM TOM (48), who ambles along the side

of the road against traffic, and he waves to them as they

pass. He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi-

colored SKI MASK over his head and face...

[END MONTAGE]

Sam swivels her head to watch Tom. ANOTHER CAR passes and he

waves to it as well. Chris picks up on her curiosity.

Sam continues to stare until he disappears out of sight...

PAN DOWN to a PUDDLE by the side of the road. As a CAR TIRE

splashes through it, PAN UP TO FIND:

I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Dusty's auto repair shop, which is nothing more than a big

garage attached to his old two-story house. Corey's car has

been towed there, and DUSTY GIBBENS (37; father of Ruth

Gibbens), the lone mechanic, tinkers around under the hood.

Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting,

bored as hell. A PIT BULL laps at a nameless treat wedged

into a crack in the walkway. The girls are forced to get up

when Ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door.

Sam and Corey move so that she can exit the house. Ruth's

look is hardened, rough around the edges -- she appears older

than her 18 years.

The girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father.

She whispers something in his ear, and Dusty hands her some

CASH, which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek. After

this, Dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes

outside to address Corey and Sam.

INT. MOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON

Phil Coulter (48), the proprietor of a dingy little roadside

motel, looks up from a hardcover copy of Stephen King's

GERALD'S GAME when the girls enter. They each have a SMALL

SUITCASE and a BACKPACK in tow.

He gets out a notebook and lays it out on the counter. Corey

finds a pen and starts to fill out a registration form... A

NEWS BULLETIN about the O.J. SIMPSON TRIAL plays at a LOW

VOLUME on a TELEVISION in the b.g.

He takes the KEY to ROOM 15 off the rack.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Sam and Corey arrive at the liquor store, which is down the

street from the motel. Ruth, Randy Evans, and Jeff and Mike

Jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar fashion

to how they were earlier in the day.

Randy seems surprised that Ruth has already made their

acquaintance. He wastes no time in introducing himself.

They shake, and Corey seems at ease mingling with the

strangers. Sam hangs back a little.

Corey looks to Sam, who produces some cash. Randy takes the

money and heads for the store.

After he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence

in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously. Ruth

stares at them in a different way. She seems somewhat

resentful of their presence.

Corey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment. Another

beat of uncomfortable silence.

Ruth snickers.

Randy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag. He

passes it off to Corey, along with some change.

Corey looks like she's considering it, but --

She takes Sam's signal.

EXT. BANK - LATER - NIGHT

The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to --

JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown

to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29

MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...

INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT

Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the

blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over

and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.

TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the

nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed.

There's a digital CLOCK/RADIO that reads 3:30 AM.

The TV is on, and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE

FOREMAN GRILL plays. Sam stares at the screen as the images

WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly

loud, rumbling TREMOR from outside...

In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the

television. She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND, about to

touch it... A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:

EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHT

Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from

the building. She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS, and her

RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.

There's a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple,

with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded

under the skin and protruding from the wound.

She is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and

fluid. A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance...

SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELD

A glimpse of the field through Sam's eyes shows a

phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which

objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions,

and move according to a framework of set paths.

A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic

life-gel to its burrow... COSMIC ENERGY burns around a

CLUSTER OF STONES... Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF

INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sam's

field of vision...

It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She

has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is

cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL.

EXT. WINDMILL - NIGHT

Sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower. A giant WATER

TANK squats beside it. Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees

Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30

feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of

his ski mask...

ANGLE: WINDMILL PLATFORM

Tom peers over the edge of the small platform, the surface of

which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE,

CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. He cradles a RIFLE in his

arms...

His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to

what is sitting right beside him --

REVEAL Sam. Her legs dangle over the side of the platform,

and she stares off into distance.

Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at

her. Sam turns to meet his gaze...

SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - VIETNAM TOM

Sam sees through to the core of his physical being, the

DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent

circle around his chest.

Magnified NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN send ELECTRIC IMPULSES that

release NEUROTRANSMITTERS, which excite OTHER NEURONS...

Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam, but an invisible FORCE

FIELD makes contact impossible. RIPPLES swell throughout the

clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it, and his

hand remains glued to the spot.

Sam extends her bandaged right hand, and presses it to

Vietnam Tom's as if she were touching a mirrored image of

herself.

The contact generates more RIPPLES, and as TREMORS begin to

shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout the

COSMOS:

A CYLINDRICAL PORTAL opens up below them, gaping and swirling

like God's eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado. As Sam and

Tom stand in unison to peer into it, a HEXAGONAL PLATE OF

WHITE LIGHT emanates from within --

EXT. BELOW WINDMILL - NIGHT

They appear near the foot of the windmill, sprinting away

from it together. Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the

sky as he runs...

...there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening

THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION --

EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING

Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her. She struggles to

peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that

stands over her. Her eyes adjust to discover that it's a

policeman -- Officer O'Dell.

Sam sits up and realizes she's on a bench at a bus stop near

the side of the road. O'Dell's tone is innocuous, and when

she looks up at him again she sees that he's grinning.

Sam manages to find her voice.

She takes his hand and rises.

I/E. O'DELL'S CRUISER/MOTEL - MORNING

O'Dell's cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot, which is

uncharacteristically full. A FIRE TRUCK is parked by the side

of the road. Just then, a call comes in on the POLICE RADIO:

EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING

Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER

about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits

of wood and metal strewn everywhere. GROUND WATER spurts from

the broken WELL SEAL...

And a cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the

crater.

Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as Sam

and O'Dell arrive on the scene. Corey is already there

looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into

town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local CITIZENS.

FRANK HALEY (54), the farmer who owns the land, is fuming.

The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.

Officer O'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite

with his boot.

Sam looks down at a CAN OF FOOD on the ground amidst some

scorched CLOTHING. O'Dell takes note of some other CANNED

GOODS and SCRAPS OF TARP.

Everyone scans the ground for signs of human remains until

Phil pipes up:

Sam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK. It's marred by BURN

MARKS and DENTS from the explosion. As she tilts her head and

looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the

damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin...

...in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT

MONSTER BUNNY.

EXT. MOTEL - MORNING

Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when

they turn and see that Chris has followed them.

Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment.

Sam and Corey shrug.

He's distracted when a brand new `95 BMW pulls up and parks

nearby. JEREMY FRAME (25), a thin, pale young man hops out

and hustles into the field toward the crash site.

Chris regains his train of thought:

He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over

at Corey, as if just remembering she was there.

Sam looks as though she's about to say something but Corey

overpowers her.

Chris makes eye contact with Sam again. She maintains it for

a moment and then looks away.

EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

Vietnam Tom explores a cluttered junkyard, gathering

materials. He scours amongst the PILES OF REFUSE, RUSTY

MACHINES and crumbling STORAGE SHACKS.

He bends to pick up a SCRAP OF METAL and adds it to a

collection he's making in a worn SATCHEL...

EXT. DINER - DAY

As Sam and Corey are about to enter the diner, Trudy Potter,

a bank teller, is on her way out.

The girls move to the side so she can exit, and take notice

of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY

MOORCROFT'S (10) dark, empty eyes stare at them from the

BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.

Trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders.

INT. DINER - DAY

The girls sit at a booth, sipping Cokes.

Corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw.

Sam is impressed, but something about her subdued reaction

exhibits reservations... Just then, Agatha Dowdy arrives with

plates of BURGERS AND FRIES.

She calls to Ted Moncton, who is busy behind the counter.

Neither Sam nor Corey give much of a hint as to a yes or no.

Okay.                           Thank you.

Agatha moves off, and Sam and Corey start to dig into their

food...

Momentarily, someone else enters and takes a seat at the

counter by their booth. It's Jeremy Frame, the driver of the

BMW. He raises a finger to alert Ted of his presence.

Ted nods and pours him a cup... After he receives his coffee,

Jeremy turns and stares at the girls. They both notice him

doing it, but Corey is the first to speak.

Corey rolls her eyes at being corrected. Sam smirks and

munches on a french fry -- she's enjoying their conversation.

Corey focuses on her lunch, ignoring him, but Jeremy goes on.

Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or

embarrassed by Corey's snub. But he's not. He's smiling at

her, and she can't help but smile back.

EXT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE/CHURCH - AFTERNOON

Each licking an ICE CREAM CONE, Corey and Sam walk past the

home of Father Homeijer. The priest is outside working in his

flower garden, wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR. An old CATHOLIC

CHURCH rests on the same lot as his house, looming behind it.

When Father Homeijer sees the girls walking by, he rises from

his work, takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his

forehead. Sam and Corey both notice him eyeballing them.

Corey waves to him in a sarcastic, exaggerated manner... The

priest doesn't wave back, but continues to gawk at them until

they go around the corner.

EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON

Vietnam Tom crouches in a decrepit SHACK covered by a piece

of CORRUGATED ROOFING. He works with great focus, arranging

VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE...

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON

Having finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor

store on the way back to the motel. They find Randy, Ruth,

Jeff and Mike at their usual post.

Randy takes a pack from his pocket and offers her one.

Sam and Corey look at each other, considering.

EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT

The party at Randy's teems with LOCALS, ages ranging from

early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER

and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL,

and a few people swim in the greenish water.

Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so

Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam

hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer.

Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition.

Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam

appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her

cup for some liquid courage.

Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer

O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth

notices him first.

Randy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his

pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE

GIRLS... But Ruth is still not satisfied.

They're all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into

the pool and splashes them.

Fuck!                            Bastard!

Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. Ruth

watches her, smirking.

Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool --

ANGLE: BENEATH THE WATER

She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION. All SOUNDS are

DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached.

Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS

glimmering beyond the surface of the water... TRANSITION TO:

INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The SPOT LIGHTS are blinding from the perspective of the

STAGE. Through the WHITE BLUR an auditorium full of PEOPLE

can been seen...

In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11)

and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their

dance performance... BACK TO:

EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT

A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls

her up --

She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath --

back to reality. She sees that Randy is the one responsible

for pulling her out.

He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.

Sam is lost in thought, struck by her vision...

She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and

jump into the pool beside her. Many of the PARTYGOERS hoot in

approval, and Randy, Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in

right behind her.

Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps

are, and fewer people. When she arrives there, she's

surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel.

As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide SCAR on the

inside of Sam's RIGHT WRIST... but doesn't mention it. Sam

wraps the towel around her sopping wet body.

Corey looks over and sees her getting out...

EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, PORCH - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.

The question takes Sam by surprise.

Sam decides to open up a little.

Sam takes a big sip of her beer, showing signs of tipsiness.

Sam stops herself.

Sam is self-conscious after admitting this.

Chris glances over to the pool where Corey is topless,

splashing and goofing around with some BOYS.

Sam takes offense, getting drunk and sensitive.

She takes her beer and storms away from him.

EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Sam finds a STOOP at the side of the house where she can be

alone. She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard, but

no one else is in sight.

Still soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts

to pound the rest of her drink...

A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF RANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A

lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an

orange glow.

She is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and

JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right

hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her

forehead...

A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing

her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front

of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.

SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS

Two DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex,

phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR

SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements

as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON,

and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE.

Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam

whatsoever. ANOTHER CAR speeds by, again nearly crushing her,

but she doesn't flinch...

She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side

of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone

who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a

DITCH near a CULVERT --

ANGLE: CULVERT

Sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch. Tom stares at

her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask.

From one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight

through to the other side...

A PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the

circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the

phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong

enough to make them falter.

On the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT

flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of

FATHER HOMEIJER'S CHURCH --

EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

Tom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over

them. Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS

and approach the great WOOD DOORS...

INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS. Tom strides past

her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT...

Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of

Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall.

Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right,

where two walls and the ceiling meet...

SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT

The three planes come together at an irregular angle, with

the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILING

SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD.

PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines,

with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture.

A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he

stands below it, reaching higher and higher...

As Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the

BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes

start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity --

ANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLS

Sam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and

outer walls. Claustrophobic, dusty and obscure.

Dilapidated WIRING snakes around them, and Tom barely has

enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger...

COSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE. A SPARK. A BLUE

FLAME...

Heat and pressure build. The old dry wood begins to CREAK and

SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE.

OVER WHITE...

The SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away... then become present

again. Louder now, and different. A BANGING...

INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - THE NEXT DAY

Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face.

She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the

beds.

She's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES

are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing...

BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR...

I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Having thrown on some wrinkled clothes, Sam opens the door to

find Phil, the motel owner. He does not look pleased.

EXT. BANK - DAY

Sam approaches the bank, and when she sees the tall SIGN with

the digital clock, she stops and stares up at it. It strikes

a chord but she doesn't know why...

The sign reads 12:48 PM -- and then -- JUNE 20, 1995. It

changes to the FIREWORKS COUNTDOWN: 14 DAYS, 8 HOURS, 11

MINUTES, 22 SECONDS... 21 SECONDS...

INT. BANK - DAY

Sam enters the small bank, and as she approaches the counter

she sees that Trudy Potter is in tears. Some of her FEMALE CO-

WORKERS are consoling her.

Trudy looks up and sees Sam waiting uncomfortably.

Trudy leans in to talk quietly to Sam.

She places her hand on top of Sam's.

Sam tries to redirect her focus.

Disappointed, Sam turns to leave...

ANGLE: NEAR EXIT

As she's on her way out, she notices a BULLETIN BOARD with

another MISSING PERSONS SIGN for BILLY MOORCROFT.

She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's

dark, empty eyes. Though it's just a low quality black &

white photo, Billy's face emotes profound hopelessness and

despair.

EXT. BANK - DAY

As Sam comes out of the bank Jeremy rolls up in his BMW and

parks in the lot. He gets out and approaches her.

They shake, and Jeremy holds her hand for a little longer

than what is generally comfortable.

Sam starts to walk away from him.

Sam turns to leave.

I/E. RANDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON

Corey rides shotgun in Randy's car, chewing on some greasy

FAST FOOD, looking quite content. Randy is behind the wheel

with a BEER in his hand, and Mike, Jeff and Ruth are packed

into the back, passing around a JOINT.

Mike passes the joint up to Corey and she takes a big hit,

chases it with some beer...

Everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when

they turn a corner and see what's left of the church.

Whoa!                           Jesus Christ...

POV FROM THE CAR - THE CHURCH RUINS

POLICE and FIREMEN swarm. Father Homeijer stands with Officer

O'Dell, gazing at the soggy ruins. The only things standing

amid the charred mess are the THREE BARE CROSSES of Mount

Calvary. But they aren't completely intact --

EXT. CHURCH RUINS - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - DEFORMED CROSSES

All three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward

the murky ground...

Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside

himself with bitterness and sorrow.

Rolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to

grieve for his church in private.

EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON

Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but

progress has been made...

It has begun to take on a recognizable form: a GROTESQUE

COUNTENANCE with TWO LONG EARS, BULGING EYES and a devilish,

TOOTHY GRIN...

EXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE -

AFTERNOON

Sam is walking in front of a DEPARTMENT STORE when Randy's

car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the

passenger side window.

Awww...                         Poor tummy...

Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers.

Corey sighs, debating weather or not to get out. Before she

can reach a decision, something in the department store's

parking lot catches her eye: a LITTLE BOY with dark hair,

wearing a BIRTHDAY HAT...

But she blinks and he's gone, having disappeared between two

parked vehicles.

Confused, Corey rubs her eyes and gets out of the car.

Corey gets out and shuts the door. Randy speeds off toward an

intersection about 20 yards ahead...

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department

store...

He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK

OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke

break.

EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

Sam and Corey meander toward the intersection where Randy's

car is stopped at a red light.

They're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming

up on Randy's car. Jeff, Mike and Ruth stare out at them from

the backseat, smelling the drama.

The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the

intersection, making a left...

Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming

straight across. Corey starts to follow... but something

stops her in her tracks: BILLY MOORCROFT.

He stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the

trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesn't see him.

Billy wears a BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He

looks pale and weak, and is covered with BRUISES. He stares

right back at Corey, as transfixed as she is... TIME SLOWS

DOWN. [Note: Sam's position is in the middle of the road.

Randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of

the intersection.]

Bewildered, Corey tries to step out into the street but

something blocks her -- an invisible FORCE FIELD makes

forward progress impossible.

RIPPLES swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit

it. She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and

watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into

infinite space.

She reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier

once again... Just as she touches it... REAL TIME RESUMES --

KA-BOOM!

FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT

RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the JALOPY hits on the

front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --

Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...

Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR

smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle

plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.

The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet --

-- AND STRIKES SAM RIGHT IN THE HEAD!

The world goes SILENT.

CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...

WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT

USED TO BE...

SAM'S BODY IS CRUMPLED IN THE STREET, MOTIONLESS...

BILLY MOORCROFT IS GONE. THE FORCE FIELD IS GONE. COREY

STANDS FROZEN, HORRIFIED... IN UTTER SHOCK.

INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

Corey signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, the

expression of shock still glued to her face. O'Dell sits

facing her.

He takes the statement from her.

Corey nods, taking this in.

Corey doesn't respond. O'Dell leans in to speak to her in

confidence.

Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject:

O'Dell shifts in his chair.

He sees how troubled Corey is.

Corey nods and gets up to leave. As she's on her way out,

O'Dell's voice stops her.

Corey's expression is blank.

EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a

secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-

depressants.

She is frightened when she notices a PAIR OF EYES staring at

her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's

wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle.

Corey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her... She's

about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the

police station behind her.

Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris.

Tom shuffles away.

Corey takes a breath, recovering from her scare.

I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING

Chris and Corey pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've

gotten Corey's prescription filled, and she has the BOTTLE OF

PILLS in her hand.

Corey nods.

Corey gets out of the car and walks toward the motel room.

INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING

Corey swallows two of her PILLS with some liquor from a

plastic cup. She sits down on one of the full-size beds where

Sam's belongings are spread out.

She opens Sam's backpack and discovers THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME

TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow...

As Corey studies the cover, her image is reflected by the

CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS. The angle of the mirrors creates double

image reflections for other objects in the room. Strangely,

Corey's reflection is only present in one of the panes.

The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...

There are PICTURES of Sam's family tucked away inside the

book, between the pages: Sam with her mother and father, ROSE

and EDDIE DARKO; YOUNG SAM with ELIZABETH and DONNIE; an old

photo of the whole Darko family together -- Young Sam holds

ARIEL, a STUFFED TOY UNICORN.

Corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand...

She then looks down and notices that the book is open to:

CHAPTER THREE - THE FRAGMENTARY UNIVERSE.

She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric

of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes

corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary

Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than

several days... FADE TO BLACK.

INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - LATER - NIGHT

Corey awakens to the sound of a little boy CRYING. She sits

up in bed. The clock/radio reads 3:30 AM. The CRYING is faint

but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming

from outside...

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

Corey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING

MACHINES on the side of the building...

...until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them. Corey

freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the BIRTHDAY

HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He is pale and bruised.

Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from

elsewhere in the cosmos, far away. The WAILS taper off to a

faint, DISTORTED WHISPER as Billy speaks:

Corey stares at him in disbelief.

Corey stands before him in awe, transfixed.

Corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him. Where

the prices should be, NUMBERS flash in a rhythm that seems to

coincide with the ululations of the distant CRYING: 2...

10... 16... 44... -end-... 2... 10... 16... 44... -end-...

Corey is about to respond when the sound of a DOOR OPENING

stops her. The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go

back to normal PRICES, the CRYING SOUND CEASES, and Billy

disappears.

Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes,

having come out of a room near the lobby. She's dumbstruck.

Phil goes back inside, leaving her alone.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Corey wanders through the aisles of the department store,

looking peaked and jittery. She comes upon Chris stocking

some shelves near the back of the store.

EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON

Corey waits on the cement steps by the loading dock. She

shoots up when Chris comes out the back entrance with a

PLASTIC BAG...

Corey takes it from him and looks inside: CANDY BARS, a BAG

OF CHIPS, some PEANUTS, a pack of CIGARETTES.

She tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up

one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking.

Corey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance:

Chris lets it go.

EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

Corey and Chris stroll together along a quiet street.

Corey reflects for a beat.

Chris doesn't respond.

INT. LIBRARY, MICROFICHE RESEARCH BOOTH - AFTERNOON

Corey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth

near the back of the library. They stare at a MICROFILM

ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH.

On the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many

PEOPLE gathered in front of it. A JET ENGINE is being lifted

away by a CRANE.

Chris thinks on this.

Corey doesn't answer. She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE, one that

chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no

known origin...

A THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED BY

A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the

air...

Chris is horrified. Corey is totally engrossed.

She brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY

who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky. A

PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the

Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in

Munchkinland.

Corey thinks, trying to figure out the right way to express

something...

Corey sighs and turns back to the screen.

INT. LIBRARY, FRONT DESK - AFTERNOON

As Chris and Corey are on the way out, they notice Jeremy

Frame at the counter checking out a STACK OF BOOKS.

In putting them down, he accidentally drops half of them onto

the floor. He looks frazzled as he begins to pick them up,

and he scratches compulsively at his LEFT FOREARM...

I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Chris and Corey pull up to Dusty's auto repair shop in Chris'

truck.

They get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're

cut off by the unchained PIT BULL -- it's growling and

barking in a frenzy --

The dog heels at the sound of the voice, and Ruth bolts out

of the house and takes her by the collar. She's got a bandage

over a cut on her forehead.

Hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into

the garage... COREY'S CHEVROLET is parked in the same spot it

was when she left it the other day. The hood is propped open.

She gets right up in his face with such intensity that Chris

retreats a step or two.

Corey steps in:

Chris gives her a look.

Ruth turns and goes into the house through a GARAGE ENTRANCE.

The door slams shut behind her, and Corey and Chris glance at

each other...

Momentarily, Dusty comes out, a partially eaten SANDWICH in

hand.

He walks them over to the car, finishing off his sandwich and

wiping his hands on his greasy jeans.

Corey's face drops.

Dusty is perturbed.

Corey glares at him, furious, but Chris takes her by the arm.

I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - AFTERNOON

Chris' truck pulls up in front of the motel and parks. At the

same time, Father Homeijer and Trudy come out of the FRONT

OFFICE carrying a COLLECTIONS JAR.

As they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the

window.

Father Homeijer and Trudy look over to Corey in the passenger

seat but she just stares back at them.

They turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up.

Corey nods, but still doesn't believe him.

She gets out, and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room.

INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT

Corey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in The

Philosophy of Time Travel book. The TELEVISION is on in the

b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILL

INFOMERCIAL...

Suddenly, there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE

runs over the TV screen.

Corey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the

television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMAN'S VOICE, HULK HOGAN

is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL...

Just then, there is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up to

answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught.

Randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted.

Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The

Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand.

Randy nods. Corey tosses the book onto the bed.

I/E. RANDY'S DAD'S CAR/LOOKOUT - NIGHT

RANDY'S DAD'S CAR navigates a DIRT ROAD up a WOODED HILL to a

VANTAGE POINT where the whole of El Reno can be seen. SPARSE

LIGHTS flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization.

There are a few OTHER VEHICLES parked at the lookout, most

containing COUPLES with MUSIC playing low.

Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the

other cars but still with a nice view.

Randy pushes in a TAPE (suggestion: River of Deceit, by Mad

Season), then takes a JOINT from his pocket and sparks it up.

Randy passes the joint to Corey and she hits it.

Randy takes another hit and holds it in.

Randy exhales and looks over at her, perplexed.

He passes her the joint.

Corey blows out a hit, captivated...

Corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the

car's ashtray.

Randy finds an INHALER in his pocket and takes a puff.

Corey turns and looks into his eyes. Randy leans forward...

They're about to kiss, when --

A DARK SHAPE scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the

forest where there's a TARP, some WATER BOTTLES, CANS OF FOOD

and a RIFLE...

It's Vietnam Tom, and he's brought some supplies to his NEW

SQUATTING GROUND.

Randy and Corey both laugh, relieving the tension. But Tom's

proximity has spoiled the mood.

INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Mike, Jeff and Ruth sit on a ratty couch in Randy's living

room, watching BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD on MTV. Some EMPTY BEER

CANS and a HOMEADE BONG litter a coffee table. When the FRONT

DOOR OPENS and Corey and Randy enter, none of them budge.

As Corey and Randy walk to Randy's bedroom, Ruth follows them

with her eyes...

INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy shuts the door to his messy room. A TAPESTRY hangs from

the ceiling. Corey is drawn to a DESK next to the bed. Above

it is a DEATH SHRINE to KURT COBAIN -- MAGAZINE CUTOUTS,

POSTERS and TICKET STUBS arranged decoratively.

A large BLACK & WHITE POSTER showing a CLOSE   UP of COBAIN'S

FACE is the centerpiece, and a sloppy BULLET   HOLE drawn in

RED MARKER marks the center of his forehead.   The words `I'M

NOT AFRAID OF DYING' are scrawled across the   bottom of the

poster in the same BRIGHT RED.

Randy puts his hands on her hips, running them up her torso.

Corey turns to face him...

They kiss...

...and fall back onto the bed...

INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT

A DIGITAL CLOCK on Randy's DESK shows 3:30 AM. There's a

SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to

01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30.

Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks

around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep

by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside

the bed and grabs her shirt...

...after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes --

because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his

BIRTHDAY HAT, staring at her.

Corey turns and looks down to Randy. He's still fast asleep.

As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery,

liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest.

Billy is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room,

elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe...

INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Her SPEAR leads her through the living room, and past the

sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path

leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by...

Corey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as

she treads out the door...

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Corey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road

about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is

guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side.

The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in

space-time materializes.

There's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF

THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive,

swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter-

dimensional realm of darkest night.

The VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL

RAINS are visible within...

Corey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE

AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM --

INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - NIGHT

In contrast to the street, all is nearly SILENT in Dusty's

garage. Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter

WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS.

Her CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already

been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on

the floor.

Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the

corner...

Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The

pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up

from the sink drain, also in the shower...

Billy stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually

morose expression transforms into a smile.

The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares

into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE --

POV OF TELEKINETIC ENERGY - INSIDE THE PIPE

We travel through meters and meters of DANK PIPING until we

hit the WATER MAIN. There's a sound like a TIDAL WAVE

CRASHING --

EXT. STREET/DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAWN

-- WATER POURS out from under the garage door down to the

street. PULL BACK TO REVEAL --

The entire driveway and the street in front of the house are

covered with water. FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE

are gathered in front of the property.

ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET

Ruth runs toward her house. When she turns a corner and it

comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks. Her face shows

sheer terror --

Because her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into

the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another

policeman, OFFICER HINES...

...the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and

barking frantically.

...and Billy Moorcroft, half-naked, soaking wet and

shivering, is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by

PARAMEDICS.

Ruth keeps to the shadows and slinks toward a BACK DOOR...

INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, FOOT OF THE STAIRS - DAWN

She sloshes through four inches of water and skips up the

stairs...

INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAWN

Without turning on the lights, Ruth desperately rifles

through her closet until she finds a SHOEBOX.

Inside it are several PLASTIC BAGS -- some filled with

MARIJUANA, others with COCAINE...

INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAWN

Hands shaking, Ruth dumps a bag of coke into the toilet and

flushes it. The WHITE POWDER disappears down the swirling

SPIRAL OF CLOUDY LIQUID...

But the bowl doesn't refill.

She begins to stuff the other bags down her pants...

EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAWN

Having deposited Dusty in the back of the cruiser and shut

the door, O'Dell's attention turns to an upstairs window of

the house when he sees MOVEMENT.

INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING

Randy rolls over in bed, opening his eyes to the new day. He

looks around for Corey, disappointed to find her gone.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Corey walks down an aisle of the department store. She finds

Chris assisting a CUSTOMER.

The Customer moves off and Chris turns to find Corey standing

beside him.

EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Corey waits behind the store until Chris comes out. She

eagerly accepts TWO PACKS.

Corey is floored.

Corey can't help it... A grin spreads across her face.

Corey cuts him off, and Chris looks at her strangely.

INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT

Corey lays on her stomach in bed, studying The Philosophy of

Time Travel. The book is open to: CHAPTER SIX - THE LIVING

RECEIVER... The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the

Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary

Universe. No one knows how or why a Receiver will be

chosen...

She flips through the onion skin pages to: CHAPTER TEN - THE

MANIPULATED DEAD... The Manipulated Dead are more powerful

than the Living Receiver. If a person dies within the Tangent

Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver

through the Fourth Dimensional Construct...

Corey glances over at the CLOSET MIRROR and sees Billy's

image reflected. She flips over and finds him standing at the

foot of the bed, clad in the same garb as all her visions.

He points to the CLOSET MIRROR... She stares into her own

reflection as BILLY'S DISAPPEARS.

HER IMAGE starts to FADE as well, and then the SURFACE OF THE

MIRROR TRANSFORMS into a three-dimensional vision of a PARK.

The focus is a SWING SET... and one of the SWINGS in

particular, which rocks slowly back and forth. Empty. Void of

life.

INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM/DEN - DAY

Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a

small gathering to celebrate his return. STREAMERS hang over

a table supporting a partially eaten CAKE. A BANNER that

reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway

connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN.

BILLY'S MOTHER (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair,

is an older female version of Billy himself.

As she brings a POT OF COFFEE and a STACK OF CUPS into

BILLY'S FATHER (35), BILLY'S AUNT and UNCLE, and a CHILD

PSYCHOLOGIST who is moderating (50s; male) in the den, she

looks as though she's barely keeping it together.

Billy's Mother interrupts as she sets the coffee down.

The Psychologist accepts a cup.

Billy's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a

long, painful moment of eye contact.

INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - MOMENTS LATER -

DAY

Billy sits at a table in the sunny, HEXAGONAL ROOM. He wears

the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT.

He appears clean and groomed, but his face and neck are

marred by BRUISES and other ABRASIONS. Before him is a packet

of COLORED PENCILS and some sheets of PAPER.

His Mother walks up behind him, and peeks over his shoulder

at the DRAWING that he's working on.

Billy nods. His mother caresses his head as she watches him

color. After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and

tries to get his attention.

Before she can go on, she's interrupted by the DOORBELL.

Billy never looks up.

I/E. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY

Billy's Father answers the door and finds Corey.

Billy's Mother hovers behind her husband, curious about and

wary of the stranger.

Billy's Father stares her down until she turns to leave

uncomfortably. Billy's Mother starts to cry... CUT BACK TO:

INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY

...the breakfast nook. Billy is gone.

Left on the table is his completed DRAWING. It's a neatly

executed rendition of a SWING SET -- identical to the one

from Corey's vision in the closet door mirror.

EXT. PARK - DAY

Billy walks through the empty park, still wearing his

birthday hat. He makes his way past a SAND PIT with a JUNGLE

GYM.

Balanced on one of the jungle gym's bars is a PRESCRIPTION

BOTTLE...

Billy picks it up. The name on the prescription is COREY

RICHARDSON. JUMP CUT TO:

The SWING SET. Billy leans back as far as he can as momentum

propels his body forward and back through space. He looks up

to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming...

He swings back and forth... back and forth...

ANGLE: PARK BENCH

Corey sits nearby on a park bench, watching Billy. He looks

back at her, showing no signs of recognition... JUMP CUT TO:

The SWING. No longer a little boy sitting in it. It dangles

erratically from the ropes, still gripped by inertia...

PAN DOWN to the sandy ground below -- FIND the bottle of

pills, now empty. Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND...

EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/EL RENO EXIT - AFTERNOON

A TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK gets off the highway and heads into

El Reno. It's load is a batch of beat up, OLD CARS.

The JALOPY is on the TOP RACK, CLOSEST TO THE END...

EXT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - AFTERNOON

Randy peeks in the window of Corey's motel room but sees

nothing. He pounds on the door and calls for her:

EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

Corey arrives near the intersection where the accident took

place. The BLACK CLOUDS overhead have become more vast and

oppressive. A cold WIND blows...

The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK breaches the crest of a hill and

comes into view, descending on the intersection.

Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of

an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the

earth...

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

Chris comes outside and gazes up at the foreboding sky...

EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

As the TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK approaches the intersection,

Corey fixates on the JALOPY on the back...

CLOSE ANGLE: JALOPY

The CHAINS that hold the junker in place SHAKE and RATTLE...

EXT. THE ETHER - AFTERNOON - POV INSIDE PORTAL

We plunge through the PORTAL as it twists through the

ether...

EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

The WORMHOLE extends down to the JALOPY. Gracefully. Like an

eel moving through water, confidently pursuing it's prey...

mouth widening to swallow...

Corey is riveted.

As it passes through the intersection, the TRACTOR-TRAILER

hits a POTHOLE -- CUT TO:

KEY SCENES IN REVERSE

PILLS COME OUT OF BILLY'S MOUTH AND INTO HIS HAND --

HIS DRAWING OF THE SWING SET STARTS TO DECONSTRUCT --

RUTH'S COCAINE FLIES OUT OF THE SWIRLING TOILET WATER --

DUSTY STEPS BACKWARDS OUT OF THE POLICE CRUISER --

RUTH'S EYE CLOSES BEFORE COREY'S FOOT STEPS OFF OF HERS --

COREY STEPS AWAY FROM THE KURT COBAIN POSTER WITH `I'M NOT

AFRAID OF DYING' SCRAWLED ON IT --

MICROFILM PAGES FLIP BACKWARDS --

PICTURES OF THE DARKO FAMILY ARE PUT BACK INTO THE PHILOSOPHY

OF TIME TRAVEL BOOK -- TRANSITION TO:

EXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE -

AFTERNOON

Sam is walking in front of the department store when Randy's

car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the

passenger side window.

Awww...                           Poor tummy...

Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers.

She annunciates every word like a true bitch.

Giggles from the peanut gallery in the car.

Everyone cracks up, including Corey. Sam is humiliated. She

backs away from the car, anger burning in her eyes. Randy

revs the engine, expressing his will to take off.

Sam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward

the intersection. She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot

where she's standing.

As Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades...

INT. RANDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Corey turns to face the approaching intersection. Resolute.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department

store...

He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK

OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke

break.

EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

Randy's car is stopped at the red light. Sam strolls toward

it ever so slowly. Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the

backseat.

She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting

herself to any more of their mockery...

The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the

intersection, making a left. Sam's still 10 or 15 feet away

from stepping into the street...

She quickens her pace, almost there when --

KA-BOOM!

FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT

RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the

front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --

Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...

Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR

smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle

plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.

The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and

skitters harmlessly across the intersection --

The world goes SILENT.

CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...

WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT

USED TO BE...

THE JALOPY IS FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE...

SAM STANDS PEERING AT THE WRECKAGE... THE AREA OF THE CAR

WHERE COREY WAS SITTING IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SHE DROPS

TO HER KNEES.

INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

Sam signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, her eyes

red and puffy from crying. O'Dell sits facing her.

Sam shakes her head no, and he takes the statement from her.

Sam nods in acknowledgement. O'Dell sees how much this has

traumatized her.

EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Sam walks out of the police station and finds herself in the

secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-

depressants...

A pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's

Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his

rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him.

Sam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom

watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go

to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door.

Sam is still too choked up to speak. Tom sneaks away

unnoticed...

INT. CHRIS' TRUCK - AFTERNOON

Sam sits in the passenger side of Chris' truck and cries and

cries. Major emotional release.

Chris looks like he wants to say something, but doesn't have

the words.

I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING

Chris and Sam pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've

gone to get her prescription filled, and Sam has the BOTTLE

OF PILLS in her hand.

She doesn't respond.

Sam's benumbed expression doesn't change, but her tone is

caustic.

Chris doesn't try anymore. Sam immediately feels bad.

She gets out of the car and slogs toward her room.

INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING

Sam swallows her PILLS with some water, and sits down on one

of the full-size beds by her BACKPACK...

She reaches inside and pulls out THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME

TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow. As she studies the cover,

her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS.

The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for

other objects in the room... and Sam's reflection is present

in both of the panes.

The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...

She looks at the PICTURES OF HER FAMILY tucked away inside

the book: Sam with her mother and father; Sam as a child with

her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole Darko

family together...

Tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie,

and she puts them all down. She touches the SCAR on the inner

part of her right wrist...

She then glances down and notices that the book is open to:

CHAPTER NINE - REMNANTS.

A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the

Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or

Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred

from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all

corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes...

EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

Sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED

SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped

around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the

GASH by her temple.

SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE JUNKYARD

She sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent DESTINY PLANE.

DEAD CARS, MACHINERY and piles of SCRAP METAL glow as

stationary objects within the complex grid. A PAIR OF RATS

follow their VECTOR SPEARS as they shimmy up the side of a

RUSTY TRACTOR...

Sam treads effortlessly through the darkness, past the heaps

of junk toward the decrepit STORAGE SHACK marked by the

CORRUGATED ROOFING...

ANGLE: STORAGE SHACK

She stands before the shack, having discovered Vietnam Tom.

He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and

looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask --

He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which

has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.

Tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as Sam

runs her fingers down one of the LONG, METALLIC EARS, down to

one of the SHARPENED INCISORS of the EVIL-LOOKING GRIN...

As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes

transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen

sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING

NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...

A PORTAL forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder,

enclosing them. Tom rises, afraid... Sam takes his hand...

The PORTAL shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend

inward, then begin to CREAK and RUMBLE --

EXT. BENEATH OVERPASS - THE NEXT MORNING

Sam awakens to a fierce RUMBLING overhead.

It happens again, and when she looks around she realizes that

she's underneath a highway overpass in BOXER SHORTS and a T-

SHIRT, barefoot, lying on a FLAT AREA atop the CEMENT SLOPE

that leads down to the road below.

Alarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current

position, she shifts her body and starts to slide down the

SLOPE...

Once on even ground, she notices a brand new `95 BMW coming

toward her.

Jeremy pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.

Jeremy gets out of the car and puts his hand on her shoulder.

She allows herself to be led to the passenger side...

INT. JEREMY'S BMW - MORNING

Sam leans her head back against the headrest as Jeremy

drives.

EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING

Some WORKERS are in the process of   rebuilding the WINDMILL. A

MAN WITH A HOSE sprays the side of   the WATER TANK in an

attempt to wash off the burn marks   resembling the nearly

imperceptible image of the MONSTER   BUNNY'S FACE...

I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/MOTEL - MORNING

Jeremy pulls into the motel parking lot. Sam hesitates for a

moment before getting out.

Sam doesn't say anything, so he goes on.

A beat.

Sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face, still not

wanting to go inside the motel room.

Jeremy thinks on this for a moment.

While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches

nervously at his left forearm. It draws Sam's attention away

from what he's saying.

Jeremy stops scratching. A small area on the inner part of

his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER.

Sam starts to get out of the car.

He offers her a wad of cash. Sam hesitates.

She accepts the money.

INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

Sam shoves a load of her wet clothes into an industrial

DRYER. She plugs in some quarters, presses the button, and

sits back in a chair in front of the machine.

As she stares into the whirling cylinder, her eyes defocus

and she goes into a daze... TRANSITION TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE UP - TOY UNICORN

ARIEL, the STUFFED TOY UNICORN spins on a ROTATING CHAIR...

The SOUND of CRINKLING PAPER.

The chair is re-spun by an O.S. hand... and the UNICORN

topples off onto the floor. BACK TO:

INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

Sam snaps out of her vision when she hears Trudy and Father

Homeijer going around, asking for change.

They hover over a FAT MAN, holding out the COLLECTIONS JAR.

As they move down the line and approach Sam, she tenses up.

Trudy is about to go into her spiel when she recognizes her.

She smiles at Sam politely, trying not to be too awkward. It

doesn't work.

Aware of Sam's financial situation, she gives Father Homeijer

the hint to move on. He follows her lead.

Sam watches as they move on to the next person, suddenly

filled with sadness...

EXT. PAYPHONE OUTSIDE BUILDING - AFTERNOON

Sam stands outside at a payphone, listening to it RING...

Someone on the other end finally picks up:

When Sam HEARS her MOTHER'S VOICE, it brings tears to her

eyes. As if feeling her emotion over the phone line, Rose can

be HEARD starting to WHIMPER.

Although it looks like she wants to, Sam doesn't speak.

EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT

Vietnam Tom sits at his new squatting ground, looking out

over all of El Reno. He peers at the twinkling lights through

his scrap metal BUNNY MASK, and cradles his RIFLE in his arms

like a soldier at rest.

He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to

him, facing the landscape. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT,

JEANS and the BANDAGE. The SHARD OF METAL is lodged in her

forehead.

Tom shakes his head no.

She looks at Tom.

Tom aims his gun at her face...

He realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them,

because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier

bends and becomes slightly opaque.

Sam is expressionless. Tom's finger trembles as he places it

on the trigger.

He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE,

and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate

system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRAL

QUADRANT...

Tom pulls the trigger. TIME SLOWS DOWN.

A liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel.

Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it...

The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when

the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to

accommodate the penetrating force...

The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but

then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same

spot, centimeters from her face --

I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - DAY

A HAND bangs on the door to room 15...

After a beat, Sam opens it. She's got some makeup on, and has

spent more time on her hair than usual.

Chris lingers in front of the door, looking slightly

uncomfortable.

Chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness.

He trails off when he HEARS a CAR pull up and park by his

truck. He turns and sees that it's Jeremy in his BMW.

He steps out of the way so Sam can shut and lock the door.

Chris stares down Jeremy as Sam gets into his car and they

drive off together.

INT. LAB - DAY

Jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab.

There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISION

ROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT.

As he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain

his excitement. Sam follows, taking note of a LARGE RABBIT in

an extremely SMALL CAGE...

He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and

retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid-

like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.

He takes it over to an SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE and turns

it on. He places the meteorite slice in the microscope's

VACUUM COLUMN through an AIRTIGHT DOOR.

A BLACK & WHITE IMAGE appears on the microscope's MONITOR --

it's a geometric collage of all shapes and shades.

He waits for Sam to take the bait.

He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor. Their

shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding

them.

Jeremy is practically beaming.

Jeremy's tone becomes serious, and he starts to scratch at

his left forearm as he talks.

As Jeremy gets more worked up, he scratches harder...

Sam stares at him for a long beat, as if examining him.

Sam gazes at the cluster of white shapes on the monitor.

Sam doesn't agree or disagree. She's become tense, because

Jeremy's face is now in close proximity to hers.

He goes in for a kiss, but Sam gently pushes him away.

Jeremy retreats, shielding his left arm. Sam looks down and

sees that the red, raw area has turned into a much bigger

RASH, covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto

his forearm.

He looks pathetic, and Sam feels sorry for him.

Jeremy manages a smile, and Sam smiles back.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department

store...

He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK

OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke

break.

EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK carrying the JALOPY breaches the

crest of the hill, descending on the intersection...

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS

Chris lights up a cigarette...

CHRIS' POV - TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK

He watches as the TRACTOR-TRAILER hits the pothole, but

passes safely through the intersection, making a right.

Something about the sight of this strikes Chris so much that

his cigarette falls out of his mouth.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Father Homeijer and Trudy stroll down a quiet street with

their COLLECTIONS JAR, and arrive at a fork in the road.

Without warning, Trudy kisses him on the cheek.

Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a

friendly manner. They move off in separate directions...

EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAY

Father Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house. No answer.

INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

The priest lets himself into the garage, which is open but

deserted. He notices COREY'S CHEVROLET. He steps up to the

GARAGE ENTRANCE and knocks...

No one comes to the door, but he notices that it's slightly

ajar.

He can hear COUNTRY MUSIC playing low within.

He lets himself inside...

INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Father Homeijer walks into the dingy kitchen. The SINK is

full of DIRTY DISHES. A coating of GRIME over everything.

INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, LIVING - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - PIT BULL

The sleeping PIT BULL stirs...

INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO

that sits on the kitchen counter.

The COUNTRY SONG comes to a close, and the tape runs out.

With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound

-- soft, distant CRYING.

He looks curiously toward the CELLAR DOOR... [Note: The

CRYING SOUND should be identical to the one that drew Corey

out of the motel room.]

INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, BASEMENT - DAY

Father Homeijer slowly descends the rickety BASEMENT STEPS.

At the bottom, he finds a STRING that connects to a bare

overhead BULB...

He creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old

WASHER/DRYER, continuing toward the source of the CRYING,

which has become more pronounced. He wrinkles his nose at a

foul smell...

He rounds a corner, and when he sees Billy Moorcroft he's

nearly frozen in shock --

The boy is locked inside a large, METAL DOG'S CAGE. He sits

on the floor of the cage, rocking back and forth.

He is pale, bruised and slick with sweat, clothed only in a

pair of SOILED BRIEFS. Beside him is an aluminum WATER BOWL

and some scraps of WHITE BREAD. The floor beneath him is

soaked with URINE and scattered FECES.

Father Homeijer makes the sign of the cross.

EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAY

Dusty's place is surrounded by FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and

an AMBULANCE. Billy Moorcroft is wrapped in a blanket and

being tended to by PARAMEDICS.

Father Homeijer stands near the boy, being interviewed by a

DETECTIVE.

Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a

cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER

HINES (28).

Dusty says nothing as O'Dell shoves him in and slams the

door...

The two officers turn when they see RANDY'S DAD'S CAR pull up

next to the property. Randy is in the driver's seat, looking

confused. Ruth hops out of the passenger seat and darts

toward the house --

-- but she is cut off and grabbed by a POLICEMAN. ANOTHER

OFFICER goes to talk to Randy in the car.

Wheels turning, O'Dell addresses Hines:

INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAY

O'Dell lets himself into Ruth's bedroom. It's a mess -- her

CLOTHES are all over the floor, and crinkled ROCK POSTERS

litter the walls.

Next to her bed is a FRAMED PICTURE of she and Randy. O'Dell

starts to rifle through her desk drawers, one after another --

He tosses the closet, throwing out clothes and shoes... until

he finds the SHOEBOX. He opens it up, satisfied...

ANGLE: OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM DOOR

Officer Hines stands by the door, looking in at O'Dell

covertly.

INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MORNING

Sam lies in bed in front of the television. A NEWS BULLETIN

comes on about Billy's Moorcroft's rescue:

Sam stares at the television, dumbfounded. The news cuts to

the scene of the rescue, where Father Homeijer is being

INTERVIEWED:

EXT. MOTEL - MORNING

As Sam's walking away from the motel, she looks up to the sky

at a PASSING JET...

INT. DINER - MORNING

Sam sits at the booth where she and Corey sat before, and

Agatha sets down a glass of ORANGE JUICE.

Ted pipes up from behind the counter:

Chris enters the diner and catches the end of Ted's rant.

As Agatha moves off, Chris sees Sam and approaches her table.

Agatha notices that Chris has sat down with Sam.

He refocuses his attention back on Sam.

Agatha is there with his coffee just in time to hear this

last part. She gives Chris and Sam each an odd look before

setting the coffee down and leaving.

Sam waits for him to go on.

Sam looks shocked and a little disgusted.

Sam's had enough.

Chris hangs his head, frustrated.

INT. JAIL CELL - AFTERNOON

O'Dell stands at the bars of Dusty's jail cell. Dusty lies on

his cot and stares up at the ceiling.

O'Dell chuckles, enjoying this immensely.

EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - EVENING

O'Dell, now dressed in plainclothes, is on the way to his CAR

in the far corner of the back lot. He HEARS someone come out

the door behind him, but doesn't turn until he HEARS his

VOICE.

Hines catches up with him and they walk and talk.

O'Dell's face grows cold but he doesn't slow his pace.

Hines grabs his shoulder to stop him. O'Dell eyes his hand.

O'Dell keeps cool, but resents being muscled.

Hines extends his hand and smiles. O'Dell shakes it.

Grudgingly...

After Hines turns on him and jogs back to the station house,

O'Dell kicks the ground angrily.

When he looks up, he's startled by a pair of eyes that peer

from the bushes nearby. Upon closer inspection, he sees that

it's Vietnam Tom in his SKI MASK.

Nervous about how much he's heard, O'Dell takes an aggressive

stance.

He becomes tense when Tom emerges, because he sees that he's

got his RIFLE.

O'Dell realizes that he's not holding it in a threatening

manner, but cradling it in his arms.

Tom steps toward him ever so slowly. O'Dell reaches out and

Tom hands him the gun, stock first.

Tom looks at the ground, hunched over meekly.

O'Dell looks around as Tom shuffles off, making sure no one

witnessed the transaction.

EXT. LOOKOUT - SUNSET

Sam trudges up the wooded hill to the vantage point, carrying

The Philosophy of Time Travel book. It's quiet and peaceful,

and everything's bathed in golden light.

EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - SUNSET

She comes upon Tom's new squatting ground in a secluded area

near the lookout, and looks around before approaching.

When she sees the handmade BUNNY MASK lying among his things,

she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it

up.

She runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and

jagged teeth...

She doesn't realize that Tom is standing close behind her.

When she senses his presence she's startled.

She sets the BUNNY MASK down where she found it. Tom says

nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her

there. He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view.

After a long beat, Sam sits down beside him. To her surprise,

Tom begins to speak:

Sam listens to him intently.

Tom turns and looks at her strangely.

Sam peers into Tom's pale blue eyes through his ski mask.

Without knowing why, she reaches out and touches the mask...

When she starts to pull it off Tom grabs her hand, stopping

her -- not too rough, but forceful.

Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go. His eyes

drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.

Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him.

When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with

emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand.

Tom says nothing.

Again, Tom does not speak. After a beat, Sam gets up slowly

and walks away, leaving Tom with the book.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Jeremy is at the department store in the FIRST AID SECTION,

picking out some GAUZE and DISINFECTANT. When he looks down

the aisle and sees Sam, he moves toward her quickly...

He disturbs her while she's looking at some FEMININE HYGIENE

PRODUCTS.

When he sees the items that she's shopping for, he seems much

more embarrassed than she does.

Sam finds his manner a bit odd.

Sam's face darkens, and Jeremy picks up on it.

Jeremy is furious.

Sam backs away from him. He's getting louder and out of

control.

Suddenly, a hand comes down on Jeremy's shoulder. He turns

and finds Chris standing behind him.

Sam is relieved. Jeremy glares at Chris.

Jeremy brushes past Sam as he leaves, and she and Chris are

left alone. There's a definite "I told you so" aura.

Sam starts to walk away, at first forgetting the products she

needed. She comes back to get them, slightly flustered. Chris

turns and leaves her in peace.

INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Father Homeijer and Trudy are sitting on the couch in the

living room of his quaint house, sharing a BOTTLE OF

CHAMPAGNE.

They sip their champagne. Trudy glows.

Trudy grabs the bottle and tries to refill his glass, but the

priest puts his hand over it.

I/E. O'DELL'S CAR/ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

O'DELL'S CAR pulls up to an old warehouse and parks.

Hines is nervous. He lights a cigarette.

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT

Tom wears his metal BUNNY MASK. Sam wears her HOODED

SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, and her right hand is BANDAGED. The

METAL SHARD is embedded under the skin of her forehead...

They move slowly and methodically until they reach the center

of the empty lot. There are lights on in the closed

department store, but the parking lot is mostly dark.

TOM'S VOICE is MUFFLED behind his mask.

Tom cocks his head, unsure of the answer.

They both turn toward an area in the lot where the SHOPPING

CARTS are stored. The METAL STORAGE RACK starts to tremble

and burn with COSMIC ENERGY...

INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Father Homeijer finishes his glass of champagne. Trudy is

already done with hers, and she takes his glass and sets it

on the coffee table. She moves closer to him on the couch...

She puts her hand on his leg.

She moves in closer... He looks uncomfortable.

She's about to kiss him, but Father Homeijer stops her.

He takes her by the hand, reminding her of the WEDDING BAND

on her finger.

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT

SHOPPING CARTS start to roll out of the RACK by themselves,

following their own liquid VECTOR SPEARS.

Tom stands staring at them. He is flanked by Sam...

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Officer Hines walks to the edge of the woods beside the

warehouse and unzips his pants...

ANGLE: O'DELL'S CAR

With GLOVED HANDS, O'Dell grabs VIETNAM TOM'S RIFLE out of

the trunk...

INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Trudy's head is buried in her hands and she bawls.

Father Homeijer doesn't know what to say.

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Hines finishes relieving himself and comes out into the open

from the side of the building. O'Dell is waiting for him.

BOOM!

O'Dell shoots him in the chest. He is cool and calm. He

throws the rifle down on the ground...

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT

The SHOPPING CARTS whirl in an circle of ever-increasing

speed around Vietnam Tom and Sam. The RUBBER WHEELS squeal on

the cement until they start to melt...

The VECTOR SPEARS lead the carts in a spiral that hones in

closer and closer to the two of them. Sam is stoic. Tom is in

awe...

EXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT - POV INSIDE PORTAL

We travel at breath-taking speed through a PORTAL as it

weaves through millions of STARS, then an ATMOSPHERIC

BARRIER...

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT

When it looks like they'll be crushed by the scudding metal,

or combusted by the cosmic energy, the WORM-LIKE PORTAL from

the sky reaches down and encloses Tom and Sam like a vacuum.

There's a brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT -- TRANSITION TO:

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THE NEXT MORNING

CHRIS' TRUCK pulls into the lot early in the morning, and he

gets out wearing his work uniform. Still groggy, he's about

to walk into the store when something catches his eye...

CRANE UP to FIND a STRUCTURE made of all the SHOPPING CARTS,

as chilling and impressive as a crop circle, in the shape of

an immense FIBONACCI SPIRAL. The metal of the carts has been

fused together, and they're stacked in an ascending manner

that reaches an apex in the center, like a cone.

Chris is mystified... CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

Two POLICE CRUISERS speed down a street in town...

EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

COPS, including Officer O'Dell, converge on Vietnam Tom in

the park, where he sits on the SWING in his ski mask...

Tom looks up at them calmly, without fear.

He obeys them and two Cops jump on him and put him in cuffs.

One of them pulls up his head and rips off his ski mask --

Tom's face is a mass of SCARS. Both his cheeks, forehead and

chin are marred by scar tissue born from long, deep gashes.

O'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes...

INT. POLICE STATION, VARIOUS - AFTERNOON

Tom is slammed against a table. An OFFICER takes his hand

roughly and sticks his fingers into some ink to take his

prints -- JUMP CUT TO:

Tom stands for his booking photos -- JUMP CUT TO:

The POLICEMAN stands over Vietnam Tom, who sits defeated in a

chair. A YOUNG OFFICER approaches.

He passes the Policeman a set of DOG TAGS on a CHAIN. The

name on the tags is: THOMAS WARD SPARROW.

EXT. MOTEL - EVENING

Sam walks toward the motel, wearing JEANS and a T-SHIRT...

When she sees JEREMY'S BMW parked in the lot she stops short.

But it's too late -- he's already seen her and is getting out

of the car. He's got a bouquet of FLOWERS.

He passes her the flowers.

Jeremy is awkward and shy.

Sam still isn't sure.

Jeremy beams.

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

Chris is in the department store parking lot with a crew of

EMPLOYEES. They work together to pry apart the numerous

SHOPPING CARTS with CROWBARS. They've made some progress, but

still a long way to go.

Chris is distracted by JEREMY'S BMW as it cruises through the

nearby intersection...

After it passes, Chris looks up at some OMINOUS CLOUDS

congregating in the darkening sky.

From the CLOUDS above the store -- PAN DOWN TO FIND:

EXT. LOOKOUT - EVENING

The lookout, and Jeremy's car riding up the hill. There are

OTHER CARS parked to watch the upcoming display, but Jeremy

drives to a more SECLUDED AREA... (Music suggestion: 4th of

July, by Soundgarden.)

EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - EVENING

Jeremy spreads a blanket on the ground of a private grove. He

wears a LIGHT JACKET, and sets down a GROCERY BAG. Sam has

her HOODED SWEATSHIRT tied around her waist.

He points to an area near the tops of the trees.

Sam sits down on the blanket and checks her watch. Jeremy

pokes around in the grocery bag.

Sam takes her HOODED SWEATSHIRT from around her waist and

puts it on to fight the cold...

Sam spots a METEOR as it streaks across the sky --

EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - LATER - NIGHT

JEREMY'S HAND holds a flaring ROMAN CANDLE --

A SPARKLING GREEN BALL shoots out of the stick into the air.

Sam looks up at it and smiles. Jeremy shoots off colorful

ball after ball, aiming in different directions.

After his stick fizzles out:

Sam shrugs... He grabs another out of the grocery bag, and

Sam gets up slowly. He passes her the ROMAN CANDLE, and she

accepts it with her RIGHT HAND...

Sam holds it and Jeremy flicks his LIGHTER. The WICK

catches...

Sam smiles and holds the stick as far away from her face as

possible. She closes her eyes...

But the wick burns down extremely fast. The FIRST BALL gets

stuck at the top and implodes, causing the whole thing to

catch fire.

He runs over and stamps it out as quickly as he can...

Sam nurses her burned hand.

Jeremy inspects her hand -- there's a large BLISTER.

Jeremy takes off his jacket. He then removes his T-shirt and

starts to tear off a piece.

EXT. BANK - NIGHT

The bank sign shows 8:59 PM. The display flashes to: JULY 4,

1995... It changes to the countdown: 00 DAYS, 00 HOURS, 00

MINUTES, 03 SECONDS... 02 SECONDS... 01 SECONDS...

EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - NIGHT

Jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around

Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.

The FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the

grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights. Sporadic

METEORS rain down at the same time. It's magnificent.

After a beat, Sam looks over at Jeremy...

The fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to

see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the

greater part of it.

Jeremy looks down as if he'd forgotten, then quickly picks up

his jacket and puts it back on.

He zips up his jacket tight.

The question takes Sam by surprise.

Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a

forceful kiss...

Sam shoves him away sharply.

He tries to grab her, but Sam turns and runs --

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Sam tears through the woods, Jeremy close behind her. The

FIREWORKS CRACK and POP in the sky above...

Sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark... Jeremy hits it

dead on with his shins and goes head over heels --

He picks himself up and charges even faster --

INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT

Tom sits alone in his jail cell, morose, staring at the

floor. He looks up when he senses someone approaching...

EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT

Sam sprints by the area of Vietnam Tom's squatting ground.

FIREWORKS continue to EXPLODE and shower overhead, and some

PEOPLE can be HEARD LAUGHING and SHOUTING from the main

parking area, not far away...

Sam runs toward the VOICES --

But Jeremy grabs her from behind and spins her around!

She struggles against his grip. The EXPLOSIONS and the RUCKUS

from CROWD mask their noise.

Sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin. He

starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her

across the face --

Sam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and

shoves her hard --

Sam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the

metal BUNNY MASK. She rolls over onto her back, REVEALING the

SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple...

She struggles no more.

INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT

Tom stands in his cell to meet the entity that approaches...

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT

Chris and the other Employees stop working and look up at the

sky, now roiling with sinister, SUPERNATURAL CLOUDS...

EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT

Jeremy slowly creeps to where Sam lies... Her eyes are open

and she is completely still.

Jeremy crouches beside her, and when he puts two fingers to

her neck to feel for a pulse, he starts to tremble...

The raining METEORS and FIREWORKS illuminate the SMOKE and

the BLACK CLOUDS overhead...

INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT

Vietnam Tom walks up to the CELL BARS...

He comes face to face with Sam.

She stares back at him through the bars from the other side.

She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and the BANDAGE. Light glints

off the METAL lodged in her HEAD WOUND.

I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/LOOKOUT - NIGHT

Jeremy speeds frantically down the hill, away from the

parking area and the continuing fireworks display. Tears

stream down his cheeks...

He cuts the wheel when a pair of HEADLIGHTS blind him and a

vehicle cuts him off. His car skids out, and he sees it's

CHRIS' TRUCK that has almost hit him.

Chris jumps out, yanks open Jeremy's door and grabs him by

the shirt collar. He yells over the FIREWORKS:

Jeremy stomps on the gas pedal, and Chris is forced to unhand

him as his BMW navigates around the truck and barrels down

the hill...

EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - LATER - NIGHT

As Chris approaches Vietnam Tom's squatting ground, the

FIREWORKS DISPLAY is in the midst of the GRANDE FINALE.

Showers of light BURST and CRACKLE in steady succession.

PEOPLE SCREAM in approval from the parking area nearby...

Chris comes upon Sam's lifeless form.

He stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body

close...

As he does this, Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him.

Chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding Sam.

The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them...

Tom looks down at the two of them for a moment, then reaches

down and picks up his BUNNY MASK. The EVIL GRIN is red with

SAM'S BLOOD, and one of the teeth is missing...

The last of the fireworks display occurs, leaving the night

full of SMOKE, HELLISH CLOUDS and an increasing number of

bright-tailed METEORS -- the APOCALYPSE.

Amongst the churning clouds, a tornado-like PORTAL cuts

through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town. It's

swirling and vast, stretching down from limitless space...

Tom puts on the BUNNY MASK...

45 minutes... 6 seconds...      45 minutes... 6 seconds...

And focuses on a single METEOR that plummets toward the

yawning VORTEX, using telekinetic power to guide it...

EXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT - POV INSIDE PORTAL

The METEOR blazes through the WORMHOLE --

EXT. BANK - NIGHT

The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to --

JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown

to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29

MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...

INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT

Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the

blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over

and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.

TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the

nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. The

CLOCK/RADIO reads 3:30 AM.

EXT. WINDMILL PLATFORM - NIGHT

Vietnam Tom sits atop the platform, more than 30 feet up,

wearing his ski mask and holding his rifle. The surface of

the platform is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER

BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP.

Relaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky. As

a TREMOR starts to build, he takes off his ski mask and gazes

out over his town...

He smiles.

Suddenly, there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT --

deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- CUT TO:

CHARACTER MONTAGE

Dusty sits and stares at his CELLAR DOOR... Trudy holds a

PICTURE OF FATHER HOMEIJER and cries... Ruth snorts some COKE

in her room... Jeremy scratches his LEFT FOREARM in his

sleep... Billy Moorcroft shivers from the chill in his

CAGE... Officer O'Dell sits alone in his patrol car,

fingering the trigger of his PISTOL... TRANSITION TO:

EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING

Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER

about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits

of wood and metal strewn everywhere. Ground water spurts from

the broken well seal.

A cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the

crater...

Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite as Sam and O'Dell arrive

on the scene. There are PARAMEDICS, a CORONER and other

POLICEMEN there as well, and a large area has been cordoned

off with POLICE TAPE.

Corey is there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, Phil

Coulter, and other local CITIZENS. TOM'S REMAINS are carried

off in a BLACK BAG...

Sam moves to stand by Corey. The overall mood is grim, and

Frank stands peering at the wreckage with a long face.

The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.

Officer O'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite

with his boot.

Sam looks down on the ground and sees Tom's multi-colored SKI

MASK...

She picks it up.

As she caresses the fibers with her fingers, she is filled

with unwarranted emotion...

EXT. MOTEL - MORNING

Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when

they turn and see that Chris has followed them.

Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment.

Sam and Corey shrug.

He's distracted when JEREMY'S BMW pulls up and parks. He hops

out and hustles across the field toward the crash site...

Chris regains his train of thought:

He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over

at Corey, as if just remembering that she were there.

Corey turns and goes inside the room.

Sam looks back to Chris, who is uncomfortable for causing the

conflict.

INT. FRANK'S BARN - DAY

The METEORITE sits in a dark corner of the barn, collecting

dust...

INT. CHRIS' TRUCK - DAY

Sam leans her head against the window of Chris' truck as they

cruise along the highway...

She gazes up at the bright, open sky.

THE END
