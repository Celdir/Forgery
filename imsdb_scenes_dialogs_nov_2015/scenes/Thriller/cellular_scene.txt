J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress

TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND.

We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the

distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the

Downtown Los Angeles skyline.

In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal

the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.

HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a

gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the

landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet.

CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent

Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to

admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the

driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical

placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE

KEYHOLE into the foyer.

INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING

We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an

athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as

she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her

side.

We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the

kitchen, unable to see her face.

Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently

straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she

talks.

As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her

HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket.

They give each other a silent wave.

She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME

AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but

ready for the day ahead.

Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY.

In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads

for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.

And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips--

SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN

storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of

quick cuts, noise and confusion.

Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is

stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark.

Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --

-- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He

blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on

Jessica.

Jessica cringes.

The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the

face, knocking Jessica cold.

Then he turns to his men.

And as the answering machine fills the silence:

The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness

of his masked face.

EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY

The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us.

We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through:

An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They

bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--

ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its

destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is

dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could

scream for a week and no one would hear a thing.

As the van stops--

INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE

A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing

the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the

room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she

frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--

THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER

Standing in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid.

Imposing.

Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her.

Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze...

Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room.

Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her

throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT.

Grim as death, he stalks toward her --

And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --

SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above

Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that

hung there.

As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns

and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking

Jessica in the darkness.

Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to

show through. Trembling, tears running down her face,

Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--

The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.

THE OCEAN

Skimming along the water.

And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern

California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA

PIER.

EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING

It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are

preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier.

VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead.

BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE

MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design.

HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand.

FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.

INT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING

ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN.

The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer

generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed.

Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is:

RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the

beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal

reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi

Master of the game.

Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the

screen.

CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING

CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces

on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone.

Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes

on the shoulder.

He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD."

Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.

The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.

Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down

the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.

Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the

cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND".

S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad

wipes it dry on his pants.

Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over.

THE OCEAN

As seen looking over the rail of the pier.      The tide is in,

but it's still a forty foot drop.

RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate

contemplating his last meal.

His left hand holds his WALLET.

Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips

a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.

But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left

leg starts trembling like crazy.

Chad lowers the phone, irritated.

Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts

snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to

the deck.

But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare.   His eyes are

glued to something else--

CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can

pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS

carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the

"Heal The Bay" rally.

Ryan walks over like he owns the place.

Chloe opens the box.    Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet.

Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.

His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.

An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder,

pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so

Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.

He offers his hand.

She takes it.

The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and

they both smile at each other. Chad splits.

Ryan stops posturing, gets real.

He's managed to win her back.

There's a moment...     Then --

Ryan makes a graceful exit.       Turns back.

Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:

EXT. VENICE - DAY

A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice

neighborhood.

Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn

across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now

sits on the shotgun seat.

Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush.

He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing.

Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa,

and grabs the cellphone.

Ryan stops at a red light.

Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.   It's deafening.

Ryan lays on the horn.   When the light changes, Ryan peels

away angrily.

The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan

drives under an OVERPASS.

Suddenly --

The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan

notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car

skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before

hitting the other car's bumper.

He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED

WITH STATIC.

And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.

EXT. HIGHWAY OVERPASS - MOMENTS LATER                           10

As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass--

ID                                                                   iu

A silent beat.   A calculated look in her eyes...

RYAN pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang

up...when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold.

On the other end, Jessica begins to CRY.

But Ryan won't be manipulated.

Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in

her voice before it gives her away. She glances anxiously at

the attic door, then continues, more in control.

Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this.

That catches Ryan off-guard.   He stalls, not wanting to make

this personal.
