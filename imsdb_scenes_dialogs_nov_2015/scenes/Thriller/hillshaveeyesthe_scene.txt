EXT. DESERT HILLS - DAY

Open on a GEIGER COUNTER scanning over a rocky terrain.

A SAND STORM blows over the landscape. We are lost somewhere

in the middle of the New Mexico desert.

According to the instrument, the area contains high levels of

radiation...

THREE MEN WEARING FULL ANTI-RADIATION SUITS have left their

jeep behind to collect samples of contaminated rocks.

Not at all worried or bothered by the dust storm or high

winds, they walk towards the hills.

The man holding the counter stops in his tracks -

(loudly through the

ALRIGHT, GUESS.

I'D SAY 43.9?

IT'S OVER 124.5!

IT'S GOT TO BE OFF.

THAT'S THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE

FALLOUT IN CHERNOBYL...

(following his colleague)

YEAH. PROBABLY NEEDS SOME

ADJUSTMENT.

...CAN'T TRUST THE DIGITAL ONES...

No...It's something else... It's

like the radioactivity is moving

around us.

The numbers on the dial continue to fluctuate. Where is this

intensity coming from?

2.

He turns around, seeing nothing but sand and rock through his

mask.

Suddenly, for no apparent reason, THE GEIGER COUNTER GETS

LOUDER AS THE NUMBERS SKYROCKET.

In confusion, he taps on the instrument attempting to

stabilize it, but the radioactivity continues to climb...

He looks up to the horizon obscured by the sand storm - still

nothing in sight.

He sighs. His colleague is probably right, the Geiger counter

simply needs an adjustment...

He turns it off when A MAN COVERED WITH BLOOD, HALF NAKED,

comes out of nowhere and jumps at his face-

HELP ME... HELP ME, PLEASE HELP ME!

Scared to death, the scientist pushes him away and backs off.

The man covered by blood falls on the ground and starts

crying, begging for help. The scientist doesn't have time to

THE RUSTY POINT OF A PICKAXE COMES THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS

MASK AND OUT OF HIS FOREHEAD!

Terrified, the man covered with blood watches the scientist's

dead body-fall to the ground revealing, for a quick second, A

DARK SHAPE FLASHING IN THE SUN.

In the distance, the other scientists continue their work,

oblivious to the attack. Kneeling behind a rock, they make a

What the hell is it?

With his hand, one of the scientists removes the dust around

some SKELETAL REMAINS.

They look human...

The strange shape of the bones and skull makes it impossible

to tell whether they are human or animal.

A SHADOW appears above them-

(without turning around)

Look what we found. Have you...

THE PICKAXE SWINGS THROUGH HIS BACK.

IMPALED LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT, HIS BODY IS SWEPT INTO THE AIR

ONLY TO BE SLAMMED AGAINST THE ROCKS...

Blood splatters on the third man, who steps back suffocating

with fear behind his mask.

The shadowy figure continues the assault on Man 2, finishing

him off. Powerless to stop'the massacre, the last scientist

runs away in a panic.

At the top of the hill, he appears, out of breath. He doesn't

have time to climb the rocks as he is pulled down, screaming

in his mask.

The scientists' Jeep takes off dragging behind it the three

bodies in their radiation suits and the dead body of the

other man...

2 OPENING CREDITS ON 2

A thick, juicy steak lands on a hot skillet.

WE ARE IN A 1950'S COMMERCIAL FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY-

While preparing dinner, the perfect housewife presents the

kitchen of tomorrow by praising all the benefits of nuclear

energy.

She is joined by her husband, their children, and their dog.

The entire family sits at the table with big smiles.

The frame freezes on this naive image of prosperity and well

being. A slogan appears:

"NUCLEAR ENERGY, TRY IT...WE DID!"

CLASSIFIED STOCK FOOTAGE replaces the commercial-

These new images are of nuclear tests performed by the US

Army in the New Mexico desert during the same period-

4.

Old mining towns are evacuated by soldiers. Their inhabitants

are rounded up like cattle and loaded into trucks.

Somewhere else, prefabricated towns filled with test dummies

are eradicated by atmospheric explosions...

Caged animals used for experiments are carbonized by nuclear

waves.

Scientists study the evolution of certain radiated species...

In a split second, gigantic craters are formed in the middle

of the desert.

Explosions destroy everything in their path leaving behind

only a giant nuclear mushroom, beautiful and terrifying...

FADE TO BLACK.

3 EXT. DESERT HILLS - SUNRISE 3

SUPER: NEW MEXICO - TODAY

The sharp outline of the hills appears with the first morning

light.

The sun begins to rise revealing-

A long deserted horizon stretching out endlessly.

Nothing lives in this and wilderness.

4 EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 4

A road curves through the desert terrain.

On the side of the road, at the bottom of a hill, a gas

station has survived years of wind and dust.

Around the main building, a tool shed, three gas pumps, a

dilapidated well, a water tower, and gutted carcasses of cars

from the 1950's accentuate the desolate feeling which

prevails in this place.

A sign reads "LAST STOP FOR 200 MILES".

A few tumbleweeds roll across the road.

5 INT. GAS STATION ROOM - DAY 5

Beams of light slice through the shutters.

5.

KRIIINK KRONK - a metal grinding noise is heard outside.

KRIIINK KRONK - the noise becomes regular.

In the darkness we discover a room hardly furnished. The

withered and yellowed wallpaper flaps slowly in the draft.

On the dresser, dozens of empty liquor bottles.

KRIIINK KRONK - On the bed, THE OLD GAS STATION ATTENDANT

lays with his back to the window.

KRIIINK KRONK - The noise outside continues steadily without

disturbing his sleep.

KRIIINK KRONK - Suddenly, the old man wakes up short of

breath and looks around trying to locate the noise.

KRIIINK KRONK - He looks through the shutters, then quickly

puts on the top of his gas station overalls. He grabs a

SHOTGUN, loading it swiftly.

6 INT. GAS STATION - DAY 6

KRIIINK KRONK - The metal grinding noise increases as we move

towards the gas station door.

The door opens and the old man walks out holding his gun.

Nobody. Silence has returned. The metal grinding is gone.

The lever from the water well still moves. IT'S JUST BEEN

USED!

Hidden behind the house someone or something observes the old

station attendant walking slowly to the well.

DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...- water falls on the palm of his hand.

Worried, the old man scans the surroundings.

HE IS NOT ALONE.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

Ruby? Is that you?! Ruby?

The sun is already high above, the heat waves shimmering over

the desert.

The old gas station attendant moves away from the road

towards the hills.

6.

He stops by a broken fence which is bent halfway to the

ground. On a rusty sign next to an atomic symbol, we can

MILITARY ZONE - NO TRESPASSING - RISK OF RADIATION

OLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D)

(towards the hills)

RUBY! RU-BY!

On the side of the hill,-THE ENTRANCE TO A CONDEMNED

NINETEENTH CENTURY MINE.

He approaches the mine and looks through the wooden planks

barring its entrance.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D)

RUBY?

His echo is the only sound that can be heard from the

depths...

He aims the shotgun, ready to open fire.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D)

IF THAT'S YOU JUPITER, I GOT A

BUCKSHOT FOR YA... YOU HEAR ME?!

Behind the gas station, someone observes the old man coming

back to the house.

AN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG was placed in front of his door

during his absence.

The old man looks-around terrified.

Diligently, he enters the house leaving the bag on the

ground.

On second thought, the door reopens and the bag is dragged

inside.

7 INT. GAS STATION - DAY 7

The shutters are all closed leaving the station in darkness.

The old man throws the leather bag on the dining table and

sets down the shotgun.

He takes a cigar from an ashtray and lights it. He grabs a

whisky bottle.

7.

After a solid gulp, he turns on a bare light-bulb hanging

over the table, and stares at the bag in silence. One more

swig for courage, and the old man empties the bag on the

Jewels, a Swiss watch, a DV Cam, glasses, several cell

phones, a pager, loose cash, credit cards, a wallet...

.A FEW GOLD TEETH, AND AN EAR ON WHICH HANG GOLD EARRINGS.

He grabs the wallet and pulls out a photo already sticking

out.

On the bent picture, we see a young couple kissing. The young

woman wears the same earrings found on the severed ear...

The old man heaves a sigh before putting the wad of cash in

his pocket. Outside, a voice is heard.

MAN (O.S.)

SOMEONE THERE?!

The voice is followed by a car horn.

The old man quickly gathers the objects from the table

returning them to the bag.

8 EXT. GAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 8

A 1988 AIRSTREAM TRAILER HOME hitched to A CHEVROLET SUV is

parked in front of the gas station.

BIG BOB CARTER, an imposing man in his late fifties, stands

outside the vehicle still honking the horn.

The trailer home and SUV with the AMERICAN FLAG waving on the

side, completes the image - Big Bob is an obvious cliche of

the middle class Republican father with a touch of John

Wayne.

where the hell is everybody? I'm

gonna...

Before he can finish his sentence, the old gas station man

appears.

BIG BOB (CONT'D)

Ah, there you are. Fill it up and

check the fluids my friend.

9.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

California? Sure didn't take the

fastest road!

My crazy husband absolutely had to

see the desert.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

Nothing to see in the desert.

Big Bob glares at the old man who fills up the tank while

still chewing on his cigar.

You know, it's illegal to smoke

around a gas station.

The old man bursts out in laughter revealing rotten teeth.

9 INT. TRAILER - DAY 9

tries to fix the broken A/C.

His glasses and white oxford shirt drenched in sweat, Doug is

totally out of his element. This is a guy who has never been

out of the city.

Using a Phillips screwdriver, he forcibly removes the front

grill to access the mechanism.

The heat and incessant BARKING wear on Doug's nerves.

Piece of shit! Why couldn't we fly

like normal people?

Relax Doug, please. It's their

silver anniversary and they're so

happy you're here.

Please, your parents can't stand

me.

You're wrong. They love you.

10.

We could have taken them on a

cruise.

Yeah, that's a great idea. Why

didn't you plan it?

What's that supposed to mean?

Never mind.

Lynn grabs the milk bottle from its heater.

Maybe I shouldn't have even come.

Doug, please stop. I never ask you

for anything, OK?

(she looks at the baby)

Well see how happy you are when

Catherine comes along on our 25th

anniversary.

She walks out.

It won't be in a shitty trailer

home-that's for sure.

LYNN (O.S.)

I heard that...

10 INT. SUV - DAY 10

Lynn knocks on the window, interrupting his little game.

11.

If you want to use the restroom,

it's now or never.

Bobby removes his headphones and pushes Brenda.

Wake up, lard ass.

11 EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 11

tied to a rope.

Bobby, come look at this.

Bobby joins her.

(holding the animal)

Oh my god! Poor thing.

You two make a perfect pair.

Bobby turns to a rusty car and unzips to urinate.

Don't pee there...

Why not?

(pointing to a small

Hello?

God, what do you care?

Bobby re-zips and heads towards the small wooden outhouse

while Brenda plays with the baby pig.

Piggy, piggy, piggy...

SOMEONE OBSERVES HER FROM THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE.

12.

12 EXT. CAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 12

In front of the gas station, Lynn leans on the car giving

Catherine a bottle.

Big Bob opens the hood while the old man continues to fill

the tank.

At the same time, Doug comes out of the trailer holding his

cell phone.

(to the old man)

Excuse me sir, do you have a phone

I can use? I can't get a signal

around here and...

Big Bob interrupts.

Give. the phone a rest, Bukowski!

Sorry Bob, "duty calls"...

Honey, you haven't put that phone

down since we left.

This is why I don't go on vacation.

They're lost without me.

Stop being at everyone's beck and

call, Bukowski. You're the boss,

remember?

.I'm sure all that important

business can wait till next week.

Doug gives up. He kisses Lynn and takes the baby from her.

Are you wearing sunblock? The sun's

so strong.

13.

13 INT. SUV - DAY 13

While they are talking outside, a DEFORMED HAND slides into

the back window of the SUV.

A HAND WITH ONLY THREE STRANGELY PROPORTIONED FINGERS.

It moves slowly, snatching BOBBY'S HOODED SWEATER from the

back seat.

SMALL VOICE (O.S.)

.Annnnaaaaau...

Under the car the visitor's feet walk way. They are bare,

dirty and covered with dust.

14 INT. / EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAY 14

Rays of light pass through the wooden planks.

The outhouse is so dirty that Bobby is forced to hold his

breath...

An EYE peeks between the wooden planks!

What the hell Brenda!

The eye goes away...

He re-zips looking outside. Nobody.

When he exits, Brenda appears on the other side.

Freak.

She looks at him slightly confused...

What?

15 EXT. GAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 15

Doug sits on the porch giving the baby her bottle.

The old gas station attendant checks the oil and the water.

,Ethel joins him, holding a road map.

14.

How far are we from 1-88?

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

You're at least six or seven hours

away'from there.

Ethel gives her husband a dirty look.

I told you we should have gone

through Santa Fe. You never listen

to me.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

This is the only southbound road

that goes to 1-88. From there you

can take the 231 West to

California. But you'll never make

it before sundown...

Doesn't bother me. I had night

patrol for almost fifteen years...

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

You a cop?

Detective...

(with a smile)

Not anymore. Thank God!

I'm starting a private security

firm...

The old man turns to Doug-

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

You a cop too?

Who me? No way. I'm in

telecommunications.

A beat.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

Huh...Make money in that?

15.

Everybody's gotta have a cell

phone...

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

Well you won't find any customers

around here.

No kidding...

As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns-

KRIIINK KRONK - KRIIINK KRONK - KRIIINK KRONK

He leans over and catches Bobby and Brenda in the distance,

playing with the well. Brenda is about to drink from her

hands.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

(shouting to them)

DON'T DRINK THAT WATER, MISS. IT

AIN'T NO GOOD.

She'll get sick.

YOU HEAR THAT BRENDA? DON'T DRINK

THE WATER!

Big Bob walks to the old man.

What do -I owe you?

The old man looks at the gas pump.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

36 dollars...

Let me pay, Bob.

Keep your money Bukowski, I can

still afford.the gas!

That's not what I meant...

17.

There is another room behind the counter, and the beaded

curtain which separates the two rooms is still moving.

Beauty? Come on, sweetie...

No answer.

Cautiously, Lynn moves through the store to the beaded

curtains. Above the cash register, an old sepia photograph of

a miner stares at her.

Beauty?

Lynn goes into the other room.

In the darkness, among the old empty bottles, she finds

Beauty standing with her front legs on a window sill and

barking to the backyard.

Lynn looks outside- Nobody. Only the desert and hills.

Inside the room, THE HALF OPEN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG laying

alone on the table awakens her curiosity.

As she goes to inspect it, she hears the SUV starting and

Doug calling out-

DOUG (O.S.)

Honey!? We're leaving...

Lynn grabs the dog by the collar.

Come on, Beauty. There's nothing

here...

She turns around and runs into-

THE OLD GAS STATION ATTENDANT, STARING AT HER.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

May I help you miss?

Sorry, our dog got out...She won't

stay put...

A car horn breaks the silence.

DOUG (0.S.)

Honey? What are you doing?!

I'M COMING!

The old man lets her pass with the dog, watching her WITH

SUSPICION- Has she seen the contents of the bag?

17 EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 17

Through the gas station window, we see Lynn leaving with the

dog.

Outside, next to the rusty abandoned cars, THE PIGLET HAS

DISAPPEARED. Only the rope remains.

A MURMUR IS HEARD AS A SHADOW PASSES SLYLY ON THE FLOOR.

18 EXT. GAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 18

Lynn puts the dog in the trailer where Doug and Bobby are.

She enters the SUV. Behind the wheel, Big Bob turns around

one last time before driving off-

Let's go!

KNOCK KNOCK The old man knocks on the window. Big Bob opens-

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

Isn't it illegal to have people in

a trailer while you're driving, "my

friend"?

He's right, Bob.

I'm fully aware of the driving

laws.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

Have a safe trip.

Big Bob smiles back and starts the engine.

Everyone ready?

19.

The old man stops him-

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

You know, it's not on the map, but

if you take a right at the road a

couple miles from here, it'll lead

you through the hills. Probably

save you three or four hours.

Thanks for the tip.

The trailer drives off in the distance leaving the attendant

in a cloud of dust.

The old man looks to the hills, taking a deep breath...

19 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - DAY 19

THE WIND BLOWS OVER THE ROCKY HILLS WHILE WE MOVE TOWARDS THE

ENTRANCE OF THE OLD ABANDONED MINE.

The camera passes through the wooden planks blocking the

entrance and moves into the depths. DARKNESS.

20 EXT. HILLS - DAY 20

POV through binoculars from the hilltops.

The binoculars pan across the deserted terrain before

stopping on the Carter vehicle, a tiny dot at the end of the

road. The car and trailer approach.

Off screen, we hear ANIMALISTIC BREATHING behind the

binoculars.

The SUV turns off the main road onto a dirt trail. We see

Brenda lifting the gate and allowing the vehicles to access

the path, unaware of the danger lurking about.

Brenda gets back in the SUV. It pulls the trailer on the dirt

road towards the hills.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

..Lizard?!...Lizard?! Dinner's on

the way...

20.

GOGGLE, the man behind the binoculars, talks into a WALKIE-

TALKIE. His voice is rough and deep. His pronunciation is

poor and we cannot understand everything he says...

GOGGLE (O.S.)

(in the walkie)

Just got on the road... A Chevy and

a trailer...

21 INT. TRAILER - DAY 21

We see the scenery through the window blinds.

On a wall, photographs of other Carter vacations are

reminders of the good times spent in the trailer home.

The thermometer reads above 100 degrees. Sweating, Doug hangs

on while the camper bounces over the rough road.

Bobby works on the A/C. He has removed the face plate and

tries to fix the motor with the screwdriver.

(cleaning his glasses)

I tried for an hour but I couldn't

get it cold in here.

CLICK- the light turns on and the A/C starts.

There!

A breeze of cool air circulates through the trailer. On the

table, TWO PARAKEETS fly about their strapped-down cage.

It was nothing... The thermostat

was disconnected.

He turns to Doug.

How do you know all this stuff?

I don't know.

Well, at least we can breathe now.

21.

Bobby sets down the screwdriver under the sleeper and sits

next to the dogs. Doug grabs a cigarette.

I thought you stopped smoking?

Does my sister know?

(lighting it with a

Fuck her!

Big Bob would kill you if he knew

you were smoking in his "88

Airstream"...

Fuck him too. You want one?

Doug extends the pack. Bobby hesitates before reaching for

one, but Doug pulls the pack away at the last moment.

Yeah right, if you start smoking

your sister would cut my nuts off.

(after a pause)

It's cool that you came with us.

It's a drag when it's just us and

our parents...

Hey, I like seeing your parents...

Bobby is surprised.

.in pictures!

22 EXT. SW/ HILL ROAD - DAY 22

Under a "too perfect" blue sky, the Carter vehicles pass

through the barren landscape, lifting a cloud of dust.

ETHEL (O.S.)

I think we're somewhere on this

blue road...

22.

LYNN (O.S.)

Mom, we're not on the blue road or

any other road. He said it wasn't

on the map, remember?

In the distance, A LIZARD moves through some rocks before

heading across the road unconcerned by the approaching car.

BRENDA (O.S.)

Dad, you shouldn't have listened to

that guy. We're lost.

BIG BOB (O.S.)

Look how beautiful it is here

girls... The hills, the colors...

It's amazing. Imagine the first

people who crossed this desert.

They had no idea where they were

going.

Neither do we, Dad.

On the road, the Lizard continues carving a dusty path.

23 INT. SUV - DAY / INTERCUT WITH THE LIZARD 23

Close up on the radio dial moving back and forth

unsuccessfully in search of air waves...

In the back seat, Brenda, annoyed, sits staring at the

passing scenery.

Don't drive so fast Bob, you might

lose the camper...

.this is fucked...

Hey... Watch your mouth, young

lady.

(to her husband)

Will you please back me up here?

(calming things down)

Relax, Mom. We're all just tired.

23.

You grew up in the 60's. How can

you be so uptight?!

Still driving, Big Bob turns to his daughters-

She wasn't like that before... You

should've seen her when she was

your age.

(to his wife)

Do you remember honey?

Oh, stop it...

She remembers...

24 EXT. HILL ROAD - DAY 24

The lizard has almost crossed the road when-

SHLING!- RAZOR SHARP METAL SPIRES come out of the ground

slicing the lizard in two.

A trap has been set: a long chain of retractable spikes have

emerged across the road.

A few seconds later, the SW drives over them at full speed.

INSTANTLY, THE TIRES EXPLODE.

Big Bob loses control of the vehicle.

The car rolls on the rims causing the trailer to almost flip

over.

Inside, Doug loses his grip and is thrown against the side of

the trailer.

On the road, the spikes retract, disappearing into the

ground.

THE SW AND THE TRAILER HOME ZIGZAG ON THE DIRT ROAD BEFORE

CRASHING AGAINST SOME ROCKS.

Silence.

The chain of spikes slithers away in the dust like a snake.

24.

NO TRACE REMAINS OF WHAT CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.

The dead lizard, sliced neatly in half, bakes in the hot sun.

25 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 25

The dust slowly settles revealing the broken down vehicles.

Lynn jumps out of the car and runs to the trailer.

Doug? Bobby? Are you alright?

Bobby opens the door releasing the barking dogs.

Don't worry, we're fine.

What the hell happened?! Where's

Catherine?

She's fine. Mom has her.

I knew this wasn't gonna be safe

for the baby.

The heat must have caused a blow

out.

Are you all right?

I think so... Just a little shaken

up.

Bobby walks around the car evaluating the damage-

The SUV tires are shredded - the rims buried into the ground.

Holy shit!

I hope they have triple A out

here...

25.

On the other side of the trailer, Brenda has gotten out and

regained her senses. She takes a few steps, taking in the

land surrounding them...

The lunar terrain of sand and rocks extends beyond the

horizon. In the distance, only the jagged hills are cut out

against the sky. Something OMINOUS AND INDESCRIBABLE lives in

this place...

Behind the trailer, Doug walks off with his cell phone.

97% nationwide coverage, and we

have to find ourselves in that

3%...

He searches desperately for a signal, extending his arm

forward. Lynn grabs him tenderly by the waist.

(staring to the lifeless

Your father wanted to see the

desert...

Doug...

I hope he's enjoying himself.

On his knees, by the SUV tires, Big Bob inspects under the

vehicle... Not only are the tires flattened, but the front

axel has buckled from hitting the rocks.

How am I supposed to drive with you

talking my ear off? I'm pulling a

trailer on a dirt road and it's 200

degrees out here!

Behind him, Ethel walks with the baby who has stopped crying.

Oh, so now it's my fault?

Doug joins them.

So what's the damage, General?

26.

The damn axel is broken...

Can we fix it?

With what? The frame is completely

twisted... Give me your phone, I'm

gonna call a tow truck...

I already tried. I'm not getting a

signal.

Can we use the C/B?

That old thing? Give it a try, but

this is mining country. Whatever

metal is left in those hills will

probably scramble the signal...

What are we going to do?

Without answering, Big Bob gets back on his feet, wipes his

hands and grabs a bottle of water from the car. After a long

We're going to walk, that's what...

Walk?! But we're miles from

(cutting him off)

So we wait here for someone to

drive by? Have you seen a car in

the last three hours?!

26 EXT. BOULDERS - DAY 26

A hundred yards away, Bobby has come to retrieve the dogs.

Beauty and Beast have stopped below a boulder extending

twenty feet high. They bark and growl towards the top.

28.

I bet this desert is full of

rattlesnakes...

I saw a documentary on The

Discovery channel about desert

snakes. If you get bit, you'll die

in twenty minutes.

Big Bob reaches into the glove compartment pulling out a 9mm

and an extra clip. He hands it to his son.

.or was it five?

Bobby grabs the firearm pointing it to the desert.

Big Bob grabs another gun from the car, A 44 CHROME PLATED

MAGNUM.

(with a big smile)

I'd like to see how they stack up

against this...

Ethel brings her husband's jacket and helps him put it on.

Some things never change...

(loading his weapon)

I'll take my bullets over your

prayers any day.

You think we'll see scorpions and

coyotes?

Big.Bob grabs his son by the shoulders, proud. They look like

two kids getting ready to play Cowboys and Indians.

Bobby calls out to Doug, offering the gun-

Hey Doug, wanna try?

29.

Oh no! No thanks buddy...

Come on, just one shot, it makes

you feel kinda powerful.

Big Bob answers for Doug-

Leave him alone son. Doug is a

liberal, he wouldn't touch a gun...

Obviously, the two men disagree.

Behind the trailer, Brenda sits on a lounge chair in her bra

revealing a sexy body. She applies suntan lotion ready to

kill some time. Behind her sunglasses, she observes the

silent desert looking like Paris Hilton.

Lynn exits the trailer and joins her.

Catherine just fell asleep. How are

you holding up?

Thrilled to be here!

Yeah, this is a total drag,

especially with a baby.

I don't care what they say, next

year, I'm going to Cancun with my

friends. No more "family trips" for

me...

We're not going to have many more

trips like this together... As for

Cancun, you're gonna have to find a

job.

C'mon, with all the money your

husband makes, you could at least

buy me a plane ticket.

30.

Don't you think? Please, for your

poor little sister...

Doug's voice interrupts.

DOUG (O.S.)

Lynn, can you bring me my jacket

honey?

Lynn gets up and returns to the trailer.

(imitating her sister)

"Right away, honey..."

Without turning around, Lynn gives her sister the finger.

Brenda smiles with satisfaction.

30 INT. TRAILER - DAY 30

Lynn finds her husband's jacket and stops when she sees a

cigarette butt in the sink. She's pissed. She picks it up and

throws it away.

A FLASH OF LIGHT catches her attention outside. She looks

through the kitchen blinds and spots the quick reflection of

light coming from the top of the hills when-

BOBBY JUMPS UP AT THE WINDOW SCREAMING!

Lynn falls back against.the kitchen table scared to death.

Bobby laughs, pleased with himself. Annoyed, Lynn shuts the

blinds in his face.

31 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 31

Outside, Doug and Big Bob look at the road map laid out on

the ground.

I'll keep walking north. This

road's gotta lead somewhere.

Lynn comes around with the jacket and sees Big Bob and Bobby

both holding guns.

What are you going to do with

those?

It's always good to be prepared.

Right?

Are you taking a gun too?

Big Bob answers for him.

We've only got two and it's better

if you guys have one here. You

never know.

Are you sure you're going to be

alright?

Lynn puts a fisherman's hat on Doug to protect him from the

sun and kisses him tenderly.

If you don't find any help in six

or seven miles come back. I'll go

to the gas station...

It's almost 3, you'll never be back

before sunset.

It's only about ten miles from

here. I'll borrow that crazy old

man's truck and use his phone if he

has one... Don't worry... I'll be

back with a tow truck before

nightfall.

Can I go with Doug?

No. Stay here with your mother and

sisters.

And you, don't tease your brother,

he's in charge now.

Holding the gun, Bobby winks at his sister who continues to

sunbathe.

Yeah, right.

Ethel remains silent and worried.

32.

We should pray before you go-

Oh please!

Is it really too much to ask?

(turning to her husband)

Bob?

Bob finally agrees, and like a good family man, he gathers

them around.

Brenda slips on her shirt and joins them.

Thank God nobody's watching us.

In a lowered voice, Ethel recites a prayer. Even though only

Ethel takes it seriously, in that precise moment the arguing

stops and the family seems united and strong.

But seen from the surrounding summit, through Goggle's

binoculars, the family looks small and vulnerable...

Behind them the sun begins to descend.

DOUG HEADS NORTHBOUND ON THE DIRT ROAD, WHILE BIG BOB BEGINS

HIS JOURNEY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

32 INT. TRAILER - LATER 32

Catherine wakes up crying in her crib.

Hey, little princess. Who doesn't

want to sleep anymore?

The baby looks at her mother, appeased.

Are you hungry, my angel?

Lynn picks her up and exits the trailer.

33 EXT. HILLS - DAY 33

33.

GOGGLE (O.S)

Papa Jupe... Papa Jupe... Coast is

clear.

PAPA JUPE'S VOICE (O.S)

Wait 'til it gets dark...

On the radio, Papa Jupe's voice is deep and distorted.

Devilish.

Goggle's binoculars POV on Lynn-

She sits down with Ethel, unbuttons her blouse and

breastfeeds.

34 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 34

A table and fold out chairs are set up in front of the

camper. Lynn continues to feed Catherine.

You shouldn't go from the bottle to

the breast. At her age she should

get used to one or the other.

Mom, thanks for the advice, but

she's my baby.

Vexed, Ethel remains quiet.

It's starting to get cold out here,

isn't it?

(trying to be nice)

I can't believe you're spending

your anniversary stranded in the

middle of nowhere.

I can already see the headlines:

"Family found dead in New Mexico

desert."

This place isn't so bad. At least

the air is fresh.

I think it stinks.

34.

Better than Cleveland...

Anything's better than Cleveland!

(after a beat)

Maybe it was my fault we had this

accident...

Please, Mom. Nothing can stop Dad

when he thinks he's found a

shortcut. Remember when we ran out

of gas on the "shortcut" to the

Great Lakes? How old was I? 12, 13?

This family has certainly seen its

share of adventures.

If we had just stayed on the main

road we'd already be in

California...

Yeah-what I'd do for a shower and

a margarita...

The beach...

A real bed...

Bobby sits down at the table.

Has anybody seen my grey

sweatshirt? It was in the car. I've

looked everywhere.

I didn't touch your smelly

sweatshirt.

Beast has been pulling on his chain nonstop, while Beauty

cries softly from inside the trailer.

35.

Why are the dogs so excited?

Probably some rattlesnakes not far

away.

You know how Freud would've

interpreted your obsession with

rattlesnakes Mom?

Ethel throws her kitchen towel at him. They laugh. A beat,

then Ethel becomes sentimental.

Brenda's going off to college. And

then, next year, it's Bobby's

turn... The house is going to feel

so empty...

Lynn grabs her mother's hand-

I'm really happy that we're all

together on this trip.

Brenda moves to the trailer. Beauty is still barking inside.

That makes one of us.

They glare at her as she opens the door.

Brenda, the dogs!

Too late. Beauty runs out in the direction of the hills

Bobby drops his plate and gives chase.

DamAnit, Brenda! Beauty!

Worried, Ethel watches her son distance himself from the

camper.

Bobby, come back!

36.

35 EXT. HILLS - DAY 35

Beauty escapes to the hills.

Bobby runs as fast as he can but cannot keep up. The dog gets

further and further away, climbing up the side of the

mountain.

Beauty moves through the first series of rocks. Bobby loses

sight of her and stops. Out of breath, he hesitates-

Ahead, the rocky horizon shows no indication of a definite

path.

He spots Beauty climbing between some rocks and continues his

chase.

BEAUTY!

At the bottom of the hill, the rocks are too jagged for him

to continue running. He slows down and begins moving past the

first set of rocks.

With much more agility, Beauty climbs quickly towards the

top, disappearing behind some rocks.

BEAUTY? BEAUTY?

Nothing. Only sharp rocks stand before him.

SUDDENLY, A HIGH PITCHED HOWLING SOUND TEARS THROUGH THE

SILENCE AND ECHOES IN THE VALLEY.

Bobby freezes.

No doubt about it - Beauty found what she was looking for,

and it was much stronger...

In the distance, Bobby hears his mother calling.

36 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 36

A few feet from the trailer-

BOB-BY?! BOB-BY!?

Overcome with worry, she turns to her two daughters.

37.

You think he can hear me?

I don't know, Mom.

She couldn't have gone that far.

Brenda notices the revolver on the table. Bobby is unarmed.

(back to the hills)

BOB-BY?!

37 EXT. HILLS - DAY 37

Back on a threatening mound of rocks.

Bobby must decide-

Return to his family waiting by the trailer or continue his

search for Beauty?

Bobby hesitates, then gathers his courage and decides to

confront the hills.

Jagged rock after jagged rock, Bobby slowly climbs towards

the summit.

38 EXT. ROCKY LABYRINTH - DAY 38

He appears between two big stones reaching an intermediate

zone before the top-

A type of NATURAL LABYRINTH formed in the rocks by years of

erosion.

Beauty? Beauty?

Bobby moves cautiously.

He picks up a big stone for protection-

A dangerous animal could be hiding behind any corner.

A SHADOW PASSES BEHIND HIM.. Bobby doesn't notice.

Anaaaaaau - A swift sound of breathing breaks the silence.

Bobby spins around, ready to strike.

38.

No one. Just the labyrinth formed in the mountain.

Beauty?

Bobby is ready to give up when something attracts his

A THIN SHADOW ON THE GROUND. Someone or something is hiding

behind a rock.

Bobby freezes. He stares at the shadow. Who will make the

first move?

He makes the decision, creeping towards the shadow. Squeezing

the stone, he lifts his hand to strike but stops when he

A YOUNG GIRL, ABOUT 14, WEARING HIS STOLEN SWEATSHIRT. She is

about five feet tall and frail.

The hood covers her head, partly hiding her face. She is

rather pretty, even with her ABNORMALLY LARGE EYES...

She trembles, frightened and intrigued by Bobby. What is this

girl doing in a place like this?

Don't... Don't be scared. I won't

hurt you... What are you doing

here?

The girl keeps silent. Bobby drops the stone to the ground

but the young girl remains suspicious.

So you're the one who took my

sweatshirt? Where did you find it?

The young girl smiles shyly. The ice is broken.

What's your name?

The young girl hesitates and murmurs in a frail voice.

Ru... Ruby... Ruby...

39.

What are you doing here Ruby? Where

are your parents? My family needs

help. We had an accident.

Ruby repeats her name mechanically as if she doesn't

understand the questions.

(in a low voice)

Ru... Ruby... Ruby...

Bobby gets closer.

I heard you, Ruby... Are you here

alone?

Ruby won't answer.

Ruby... I'm looking for my dog...

Do you understand? My dog... her

name is Beauty... She's a German

Shepherd, about this high...

Beauty...

That's right, have you seen her?

Ruby.. _Ruby is Beauty...

The last sentence makes her laugh. A STRANGE AGONIZING

LAUGHTER.

Have you seen her?

Ruby looks down. She knows something.

Look at me, Ruby... Look at me...

Where did you see my dog?

Ruby keeps looking to the ground. Bobby reaches under her

chin to raise her head.

Instinctively, Ruby SCREAMS as she backs off, lifting her

hands to protect herself.

40.

HER HANDS LOOK LIKE CLAWS. DEFORMED AND MISSING FINGERS, THEY

ARE NO LONGER HUMAN.

Frightened, Bobby takes a step back. The girl murmurs softly.

What? I can't understand. What are

you saying?

He comes closer trying to make eye contact as she continues

to murmur the same thing. She too is terrified-

The hills... The hills have

eyes...The hills have eyes...The

hills have eyes...

Behind him, a small rock slide grabs his attention. He turns

his head. When he turns back to Ruby, she is gone.

Ruby, come back!

Once more, Bobby is alone in the labyrinth.

On the other side, he finds a trail of blood as if a body had

been dragged on the rocks.

The bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another

set of rocks a few feet away.

Bobby hesitates, unsure of what he might find...

As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side

Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks.

Before him, on the ground, is Beauty.

Dead. Disemboweled.

Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning

white. He touches the animal's head as if to convince himself

that this nightmare can't be possible at all. Beauty's face

is locked in a grimace of horrible pain and shock. And... the

animal is missing its front right leg.

DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... DROPS OF BLOOD fall on Bobby's hand -

ABOVE HIM, PERCHED ON A ROCK, A FIGURE OBSERVES HIM. A man

with an impressive build crouches like a monkey. He wears old

clothes covered with dust, and a DERBY HAT on his head.

Binoculars hang around his neck.

41.

IT'S GOGGLE.

Goggle has no face, as if it were totally covered with wax.

He has two little holes for nostrils and no ears. His mouth

is like an opened wound sliced in his skin. His eyes are the

only features which give him any human resemblance at all.

Using his hand, Goggle devours something ferociously-

BEAUTY'S LEG!

Terrified, Bobby runs away.

Goggle laughs from his rock.

Bobby jumps down the hill.

From the summit, Goggle continues feasting. A few yards away,

Ruby's slender silhouette slides between the rocks. Goggle

stops eating, sees Ruby, and throws her the remains. Ruby

looks at the half-eaten leg in disgust, and pushes it away.

GOGGLE (O.S.)

(rough and deep)

What's the matter Ruby.. .You don't

like dog anymore?

39 EXT. HILLS - DAY 39

Moving at top speed, Bobby descends from the hills,

occasionally glancing behind him.

He jumps from one rock to the next. Anything to get out of

this hellhole.

He turns around one too many times and fails to see the sharp

precipice ahead. He tries to stop, but it's too late.

Bobby slides down a few feet before grabbing hold of a

protruding rock. The rock tears his skin.

Bobby tries to climb back up, losing his grip. He falls.

His head hits the bottom. He loses consciousness.

Behind him a RATTLESNAKE slithers rattling its tail.

The snake zips its tongue around his face when -

A WOODEN STICK WITH FORKED END, TRAPS THE SNARE'S HEAD TO THE

GROUND SAVING BOBBY FROM A CERTAIN BITE.

42.

With the hood of the sweatshirt still over her head, RUBY

WATCHES THE WOUNDED BOY TENDERLY with her big, abnormal eyes.

40 EXT. ROAD - END OF THE DAY 40

Close on THE RED SUN on the horizon.

We hear Doug, singing "California Dreaming" a capella.

"...All the leaves are brown and the

sky is gray. I've been for a walk

on a winter's day. I'd be safe and

warm if I was in L.A... California

dreamin..."

After hours of walking down this road, his face shows signs

of fatigue.

I was in LA._ California

Dreamin..."

The lyrics resonate throughout the desert. Suddenly, he stops

singing.

What the hell?!

IN FRONT OF HIM, ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD, THE ROAD ENDS-

A mound of earth blocks the road like a wall, extending

hundreds of yards on either side.

Confused, Doug approaches the wall and starts climbing.

Reaching the top, he takes off his sun clips from his glasses

and tries to grasp what's on the other side-

A HUGE ATOMIC CRATER, three hundred yards in. diameter.

THE CRATER HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A GRAVEYARD FOR CARS, TRUCKS,

TRAILER HOMES, MOTORCYCLES...

Doug climbs down and wanders between the rusted vehicles.

Doug lights a cigarette before continuing his inspection.

43.

In the reflection of a shattered rear view mirror, we see him

approaching another car.

Dust completely covers the windows. Doug wipes one down to

He notices a baby seat still strapped to the back.

The cars all seem to be in good condition, as if they were

simply pushed into the crater.

He leans down towards another car-

Barbed wire is rolled around the flattened tires...

As Doug looks around in confusion, trying to figure out what

this place might be, THE CAMERA CRANES UP TO A WIDE AERIAL

SHOT - revealing five or six others craters.

41 EXT. TRAILER - MAGIC HOUR 41

It's getting colder.

Lynn warms her hands at a fire in front of the trailer.

A few feet away, Brenda collects firewood while calling out

her brother's name...

BOBBY! BOB-BY!

Inside the camper, Ethel watches the sun set in the horizon.

She cradles the baby in her arms.

Brenda joins Lynn and throws some firewood into the flames.

(looking at the hills)

We should've gone looking for him

when it was still light out. I'm

nervous.

Keep it together Brenda, Mom is

already worried enough... The fire

will help Bobby find his way back.

What if he doesn't come back? Maybe

he's hurt. Maybe there was an

accident...

44.

He and Beauty will find their way

back together.

Lynn hugs her sister.

I never thought it could be so cold

in the desert...

Bobby was only wearing a t-shirt

when he left.

I know...

42 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 42

Clouds pass, revealing an almost full moon. Wind blows around

the dark gas station.

Between the broken-down cars, we see Big Bob approaching on

the road.

A rusty tea pot sits on a pile of trash and whistles in the

wind. By placing his hand on the spout, Big Bob stops the

whistling and silence returns.

Whistling. Silence. Whistling.

Big Bob walks to the porch.

HELLO! ANYONE HERE?!

No answer. He knocks on the door.

BIG BOB (CONT'D)

It's Bob Carter, I got some gas

from you a couple of hours ago.

Still nothing. Big Bob draws his gun and opens the door when-

SILENCE.

From the other side of the house, the whistling has stopped.

BIG BOB (CONT'D)

Anybody there? Answer me!

After a few seconds, the whistling returns.

45.

Big Bob shrugs it off and enters.

43 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 43

Holding his gun, Big Bob steps into the empty gas station

store. A faint light comes from the back room. The wind blows

dust through the broken windows...

Vigilantly, he moves through the empty shelves, behind the

counter and past the beaded curtain separating the two rooms.

The light bulb above the dining table is on.

Somebody home? Hello?

Big Bob pushes the last door leading to the back room.

His hand feels for the light switch.

CLICK - an old lamp comes on in the corner.

He finds a wall mounted phone and picks up the receiver.

No tone.

BIG BOB (CONT'D)

Dammit...

Through the window, Big Bob sees a pick-up truck.

He starts searching for the keys.

Going through the different rooms, he discovers a drawer full

of money, jewels, watches, credit cards... A REAL FORTUNE.

He spots a key chain hanging from a nail next to the desk. He

reaches for the keys when something else grabs his attention-

Partially hidden in the dark, he discovers a few family

photos and a few newspaper clippings from the 1950s pinned to

the wallpaper.

Big Bob lights the desk lamp and turns it towards the wall-

His face goes cold-

On the aged photos, we recognize the old gas station

attendant in his younger days, next to his wife and his

46.

ABNORMAL CHILDREN GRUESOME AND DEFORMED BY NATURE...

Cleft lips, tumors, uneven extremities, malformations, skin

diseases, and gangrene of the face...

THEY ARE ALL AFFECTED BY GENETIC ABNORMALITIES.

On a more recent polaroid, we can recognize Ruby at 6 years

old. Besides her three fingers and big eyes, half of her

skull is missing or caved in.

Another polaroid - in a wheelchair, a little boy has

difficulty holding up his hugely disproportionate head.

The headline from the clippings makes Big Bob understand the

origins of these horrors-

"New Mexico- Nuclear enters a new age."

".. .Miner town evacuated"

"Miners refuse to abandon their lands by hiding in

"Military destroys miner's town."

The old man's family was. one of those families whose genetic

lineage was forever changed by the nuclear fallout.

Big Bob is shocked, never believing such a thing was

possible.

A COUPLE OF MORE RECENT ARTICLES MENTION PEOPLE DISAPPEARING

IN THE REGION.

BIG BOB (CONT'D)

You son of a bitch...

Worried for his own family, he grabs the keys and walks out.

From the bedroom window, we see him running to the pick-up

truck.

44 INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 44

Big Bob slams the door, starts the engine and turns on the

headlights.

The headlights shine on the outhouse.

The wooden outhouse door slams back and forth in the wind.

Something blocks it from shutting completely-

47.

A FOOT STICKS OUT...

Big Bob exits the vehicle holding his gun and approaches.

A voice comes to him. A MAN SOBBING-

MAN (O.S.)

(through his tears)

JUPITER! I GOT BUCKSHOT... YOU

HEAR?

IS THAT YOU MISTER?

Big Bob kicks open the door revealing-

THE OLD GAS STATION ATTENDANT, IN TEARS, HOLDING HIS SHOTGUN

TIGHTLY, READY TO SHOOT AT ANYTHING... HE'S OBVIOUSLY DRUNK.

BIG BOB (CONT'D)

(aiming his gun at him)

PUT THAT WEAPON DOWN RIGHT NOW

MISTER!

The old man seems mad.

BIG BOB (CONT'D)

I SAID PUT THAT WEAPON DOWN!

OLD GAS ATTENDANT

(lifting his eyes to Big

My wife... She didn't want to

leave ...she wouldn't move to town

even when the state police ordered

us to. The kids grew up in the

mines... Like animals...

(smiling through his

What kind of place is that for

children?

In a split second, the old man sets the shotgun under his

FREEZE!

BANG! - THE OLD MAN'S BRAINS SPLATTER IN THE OUTHOUSE...

48.

Suddenly, VOICES coming from different directions echo around

him.

Daddy... Daddy...Daaaddyyy...Daddy..

THE VOICES ARE HORRIFIC AND TERRIFYING. Big Bob backs up

pointing his gun in their direction.

Daaaaddyyy...Dad-dy...Dad-dy...

Who's there?

Dad-dy...Dad-dy...Daddy...Dad-dy...

Big Bob can't contain his fear and shoots blindly into the

darkness.

Who's there? Show yourself!

The voices become louder and louder, omnipresent.

Dad-dy...Dad-dy...Daaaddyyy...

Daddy.. Daddy...

Big Bob walks backwards to the truck, and trips on the

ground.

Wide eyed, he stands and throws himself on the car door.

45 INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 45

Panicked, he enters the vehicle and turns the ignition.

As the engine turns over-

A DEEP VOICE RIGHT BEHIND HIM-

..Daddy...

In a split second, Big Bob sees, in his rear view mirror, A

DARK HAIRY FIGURE WITH EVIL EYES IN THE BACKSEAT-

It's PAPA JUPITER.

49.

46 EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 46

BIG BOB'S FACE SLAMS REPEATEDLY INTO THE WINDSHIELD!

The truck shakes as Big Bob is attacked inside. Blood

splatters on the windows.

47 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 47

Bloodied and screaming, Big Bob is dragged out of the car in

the dirt to the entrance of the old mine behind the gas

station. Big Bob disappears inside. The night is once again

calm and silent.

FADE TO BLACK.

49 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 49

Miles away, inside the trailer, Ethel washes dishes while

dinner cooks on the stove.

SUDDENLY THE RED LIGHT ON THE C/B TURNS ON AND THE RADIO

SQUAWKS TO LIFE, DISRUPTING THE SILENCE.

She wipes her hands on her apron and site down next to the

radio.

(into the mic)

Hello...Hello... Can somebody hear

me? Please answer if you hear me.

Hello?

No answer. The radio goes silent. Lynn joins her, holding the

baby.

How's it going?

I heard something.

She fiddles with the radio.

I'm not even sure I know how to use

this thing.

Lynn hands her Catherine, and sits in front of the C/B.

50.

(in the mic)

Mayday ...mayday... This is a

distress call... Do you copy?

Still nothing.

50 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 50

Lynn's distress call is heard from the trailer isolated in

the middle of the desert.

51 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 51

Mayday. . .We're stranded in the

desert, we need help...mayday...

Suddenly, the light on the C/B turns green and static can be

heard. Ethel grabs her daughter's hand, hopeful that someone

may have heard them.

A second later, HEAVY BREATHING is heard over the radio.

The light turns off. The two women look at each other in

confusion.

What was that?

It sounded like an animal...

Lynn stands up worried.

If animals start answering our

radio calls, we're really fucked!

Watch your language!

Give it a rest, Mom. We have more

important things to worry about.

She walks out.

Lynn, wait.

Ethel stays alone with the baby.

51.

52 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 52

Still tied to the trailer, Beast growls and pulls on his

chain.

Lynn raises the collar of her jacket to protect herself from

the wind and moves closer to the fire.

Brenda?

No answer.

BRENDA?!

In the distance, we see Brenda looking for her brother.

BOBBY? BOBBY?

With a flashlight in one hand, the gun in the other, and a

blanket over her shoulders, Brenda moves through the night.

BOBBY? BOB-BY?

She hears her older sister calling.

LYNN (O.S.)

Brenda? Brenda?

I'm here! I'll be back in a minute.

The flashlight partially lights the desert as she disappears

into the night.

BOBBY? BOB-BY?

53 EXT. HILLS - NIGHT 53

We fly over the hills before stopping over Bobby's

unconscious body laid out between two rocks.

Ruby is still at his side, observing him silently.

She hears Brenda's calls and runs away.

52.

Bobby slowly opens an eye, regaining his senses. Blood has

coagulated on his face. He turns his head in the direction of

his sister's voice, realizing that it's night. How long has

he been unconscious?

54 EXT. TRAILER - MIGHT 54

The sky is so clear that you can see the milky way above the

Carters' trailer home.

Beast strains on his chain, a low growl of rage coming from

his chest.

55 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 55

Inside the trailer-

The first aid kit is open on the table. Even with a blanket

around his shoulders, Bobby shivers.

Ethel soaks cotton in alcohol using it to clean his wounds.

You're lucky Brenda found you.

Imagine if you had to spend the

whole night out there in the cold.

Bobby winces from the pain.

Don't worry, Beauty will come back

when she's hungry...

Bobby doesn't answer. He keeps the truth to himself, not

wanting to worry his family.

Have you tried the radio?

It doesn't work...

We heard something. Some sort of

breathing...

Bobby lifts his head.

What do you mean?

53.

It was really weird, right mom?

(minimizing the incident)

I'm sure it was just static.

Mom, it sounded like a perverted

crank call.

Only Mom would get an obscene phone

call out here!

Suddenly,a muted sound echoes outside.

Bobby jumps up, grabs the gun and crouches behind the door.

(to the others)

Ssshhhh...

His mother and two sisters are surprised by his agitated

behavior.

What's wrong with you?

Footsteps. Someone approaches.

(stern but soft)

I want you guys to stay in here.

Brenda?! You hear me?

Gun in hand, he opens the door-

Bobby is about to shoot when a figure emerges from the dark.

IT'S DOUG, holding as much as he could carry from the car

graveyard.

What the fuck are you doing? Don't

point that thing at me.

Bobby lowers the weapon.

I didn't know it was you.

54.

Who else would it be?!

Bobby is interrupted by Brenda who sees Doug from the window.

Doug's back!

Hey girls!

Quickly, Lynn exits the trailer and jumps into her husband's

arms. They kiss.

Doug sets down all of his findings.

Look what I found.

Various tools, a fishing pole...

With all of this, we can find a way

to fix the car, right Bobby?

Bobby doesn't answer.

I found this really huge crater at

the end of the road! I've never

seen anything like it! People must

use it as a dump site. It was full

of all this garbage...

(pointing to the fishing

Look at this, it's brand new!

What are you going to do with a

fishing pole in the desert? You

didn't you find anybody?

No. The road just stops there. I

hope your dad has better luck.

Is there anything to eat? I'm

starving.

Let's go, it's freezing out here.

Doug follows Lynn inside the trailer.

55.

too calm.

He looks around-

57 EXT. ROCKY LABYRINTH - NIGHT 57

At the top of the hill, Beast has found what's left of

Beauty's mutilated body and whines as he licks her face.

58 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 58

From outside we see Doug and Lynn finishing dinner while

Brenda clears the table.

Doug holds Catherine on his knees.

Outside, Bobby stands guard with the gun. His mother comes

out.

Looks like we're camping out

tonight. How's your head?

Bobby doesn't answer.

Bobby? What's going on?

A beat.

Nothing, Mom.

Are you sure?

I'll feel a lot better when dad

gets back.

Me too, honey. Come inside. You've

already spent enough time in the

cold for one day, don't you think?

56.

Bobby agrees to follow his mother, abandoning the fire.

The flames dance with the desert wind in the night.

59 INT. TRAILER.- NIGHT 59

Bobby double bolts the lock on the door. Behind him, Lynn

comes out of the bathroom, while Doug has just changed

Catherine.

Don't close the door, we're leaving

in a second!

Where are you going? You don't want

to wait until Dad comes back?

I'm tired, I really need to rest

for an hour or so...

We can squeeze in here. You'll be

more comfortable.

You want us to sleep on the floor?!

her to bed.

Bobby takes him aside.

I need to talk to you...

What?

Bobby hesitates to talk.

So, what Bobby?

Lynn walks by-

I'm almost ready...

57.

Listen... I'm sure your dad will be

back soon. He's "Big Bob". It's

gonna take more than a few snakes

in the dark to stop him, right?

Are you coming, honey?

Lynn, holding a blanket and pillows, joins him. They exit

together hand in hand.

If he's not back by midnight, we'll

go get him. Deal?

Bobby hates himself for not saying anything. He bolts the

door shut and stands facing it.

Behind him, Brenda sets the baby in her crib and starts a

FISHER PRICE MOBILE hanging above, setting off the music and

rocking the baby to sleep.

She disappears in the bathroom for a moment and comes out in

t-shirt and panties. She turns to her brother-

Can I listen to your iPod?

Bobby is still focused on the door.

What?

Can I borrow your iPod?

Whatever...

Brenda grabs it and cranks the volume. she starts swaying to

the music, unaware of the dangers lurking about.

Next to her, Catherine sleeps quietly in her crib.

On the other side of the trailer, Ethel works on a crossword

puzzle.

INSERT- " family, revenge, homicide..." are some of the words

in the puzzle...

58.

WIDER- Bobby joins her and sits.

60 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 60

In between some bushes, we see the Carter trailer home

isolated in the desert under the starlit sky. Backlit in the

window, Brenda dances...

Next to the trailer home, the SUV-

61 INT. SUV - NIGHT 61

In a makeshift bed in the back, Doug is laying on his back

and Lynn rubs his legs.

Ow, Ow... Yeah right there.

Perfect. God, I feel like I crossed

New Mexico on foot.

Amused, Lynn squeezes his legs a bit harder. She moves up to

his love handles.

A little work out can't be all that

bad for these guys, right?

Doug laughs and giggles.

Stop! Stop, you're tickling me!

Lynn continues with more fervor.

Oh, so you want to play?

He turns around and starts tickling her as well. They laugh

together before kissing passionately.

I love you...

I love you too...

They start making out.

62 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 62

At the same time A HAND opens the gas tank and unscrews the

cover.

59.

In total silence, the hand slips a rubber hose into the tank

and starts siphoning gas. We follow the hose up to the

monstrous mouth of-

PLUTO - The deformed bald giant with a child's face. But a

child with a thick, primal cruelty snapping in his

asymmetrical, protruding eyes.

Silently, Pluto siphons some of the Carter's gas into a gas

can.

Lynn's hand presses against the window, as she and her

husband continue, unaware.

Pluto laughs stupidly, excited by the situation. His large

smile reveals POINTY SHARK-LIKE TEETH.

Once the gas can is full, he waves at somebody hidden in the

dark.

63 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 63

Brenda rests on her bed. Exhausted, she turns off the bed

lamp,. and slides under the sheets. She falls asleep listening

to the music.

In the other room of the trailer, Bobby's watch reads

11:45pm. Bobby is restless. He doesn't know what to do.

A few feet away, Ethel sleeps on the couch.

Suddenly, Bobby hears barking in the distance.

Beast?!

He grabs the gun and exits the trailer, leaving the door

open.

64 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 64

Bobby moves into the night. Beast is still barking somewhere

in the dark.

As he passes the SUV, he overhears the moaning and heavy

breathing coming from inside.

His flashlight moves over the desert terrain and the

occasional bush. He calls out to his dog, trying not to wake

anyone.

60.

Beast? Come on, boy. You hear me!

Come on now.

Bobby moves further from the trailer towards the barking.

HIS FLASHLIGHT PASSES QUICKLY OVER A SHAPE HIDING IN THE

BUSHES!

Bobby shines the light on the bush and approaches-

Nothing. It must have been his imagination.

The barking becomes a ferocious growl.

Beast? Beast? Its me. Come on...

All of a sudden the growling becomes a "mooing" cow.

Then a goat. Then a chicken.

Terrified, Bobby turns around and runs back toward the SUV.

65 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 65

In the living room, Ethel sleeps.

At the other end, Brenda turns under the sheets. The muted

bass coming from the iPod drums on in the background.

A GNARLED HAND ENTERS FRAME AND BRUSHES A STRAND OF HAIR FROM

BRENDA'S FACE SO STEALTHILY THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN STIR.

IT'S PLUTO. THE DIVERSION OUTSIDE HAS ALLOWED HIM TO ENTER.

He stands above Brenda watching her sleep, an innocent smile

on his face. His hand softly grazes her hair as if she was a

kitten, then pulls on the sheets to expose her body.

Pluto covers her mouth, silencing her. BRENDA'S EYES OPEN

WIDE.

66 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 66

Panting and panicked, Bobby knocks on the SUV's tailgate

window, interrupting Lynn and Doug.

Doug! Doug!

Caught red-handed, Lynn dresses and Doug pulls up his pants.

61.

Damanit! What is it now?

(through the window)

What do you want, Bobby?

Come on, open up!

Lynn opens the back window giving him a dirty look.

This had better be important.

Bobby is too scared to keep the truth hidden. He regains his

calm before talking.

Something's going on around here.

We're not alone.

Exasperated, Lynn takes a deep breath, not taking him

seriously.

I know this sounds weird, but there

are people living in those hills.

Bobby... We're in the middle of

nowhere. Believe me, no one could

survive out here!

I saw them. And Beauty...

Beauty what?

They cut out her insides.

What are you talking about?

Her guts were all over the place...

He struggles to talk.

62.

I...I didn't want to scare you so I

didn't say anything, but

something's going on... You even

said you heard some breathing on

the radio didn't you?

Lynn nods.

We're not alone, I'm telling you...

Doug exits the car. Obviously, Bobby is not kidding.

Calm down Bobby, OK? Let's go check

it out together. Lynn, stay right

here.

67 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 67

From the window, we can see Bobby and Doug walking to the

trailer.

In the back room, Pluto hears them, grabs his walkie-talkie

Noaowww!

68 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 68

AT THAT MOMENT, an explosion takes place a few hundred yards

away from the trailer.

The flames climb into the air lighting the surrounding rocky

desert.

SOMEONE SCREAMS. Doug and Bobby turn around.

IT'S BIG BOB!

He has been crucified to a Joshua tree and transformed into a

HUMAN TORCH...

The explosion and the screaming has awakened Ethel who comes

out of the trailer in her nightgown. Recognizing his screams,

she runs to her burning husband.

IT'S BOB! IT'S BOB!

63.

Doug tries to hold her back, but she is determined to get to

him.

69 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 69

Doug runs into the trailer grabbing a fire extinguisher and

some blankets. In the panic, he fails to see Brenda

restrained by Pluto.

Brenda, stay with Catherine!

He jumps out without waiting for an answer.

Pluto gives Brenda a satisfied smile- NO ONE WILL BOTHER THEM

NOW.

70 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 70

Doug runs out leaving the door wide open.

Someone jumps from the roof and, on all fours, lands in front

of the door. He stands and, for the first time, we see the

face of -

LIZARD - Pluto's cousin.

Lizard is as thin as Pluto is imposing. Extremely pale, his

face is disfigured by A CLEFT LIP WHICH EXPOSES HIS DEFORMED

JAW. A SAVAGE WITH NO SENSE OF PITY, LIZARD IS, AFTER PAPA

JUPITER, THE MOST VIOLENT INHABITANT OF THE HILLS.

Lizard has Big Bob's Magnum. He enters the trailer and closes

the door behind him.

71 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71

Big Bob screams as the flames devour his naked flesh.

His fingers tighten. His bloodied face distorts with pain.

Even his eyes are burnt. Considering the condition of his

body, it's a miracle he's still alive...

Doug arrives with the extinguisher and begins putting out the

fire under Ethel's horrified, watchful eye.

72 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 72

Back inside the trailer.

64.

With a wicked smile on his face, Lizard puts on Ethel's apron

and places her flowery sun hat on his head. This disturbed

mind takes pleasure in dressing up in "Mama's clothes"...

Then, famished, he eats everything he can find in the

trailer.

Raw meat, fruit, potato chips... He washes it all down with

milk, orange juice...

His eyes stop on the bird cage. He smiles.

Lizard moves closer, opens the cage and grabs one of the

parrakeets.

The small bird looks around in confusion.

HE TEARS OFF ITS HEAD AND SQUEEZES THE BLOOD INTO HIS MOUTH!

Blood drips on his chin.

Brenda's muted screams attract his attention.

Lizard walks across the trailer. HE WANTS HIS SHARE.

He pushes Pluto violently to the ground.

Move!

(with a smile)

You gotta be a man to do that...

Pluto is outraged and tries to stand up. He wants to talk but

no words come out. JUST GRUNTS AND GROWLS.

Lizard savagely hits him several times.

Behind them, terrified, Brenda watches helplessly as they

fight.

Lizard puts his foot on Pluto's face, pinning him to the

ground, and then points the gun to his head.

I told ya to move!

Pluto moves away and, in a fit of rage, breaks everything in

the trailer. Dishes, chairs, table... everything.

Lizard laughs like a goon. He grabs Brenda by her feet and

pulls her to him.

65.

Excited and amused at the same time, he stares at Brenda's

appetizing calf muscle. He smells it, licks it, and then,

without hesitation, plunges his teeth into her leg.

73 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 73

Brenda's muted screams are heard from inside the trailer.

74 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 74

The flames have been replaced by white smoke.

Doug unties Big Bob. His body falls motionless to the ground.

COMPLETELY CARBONIZED, HE HAS STOPPED BREATHING.

Smoke comes out of his mouth.

Doug uses the blanket to extinguish the last flames.

Behind Doug, Ethel looks at her husband refusing to accept

the truth.

No..No.. It's not possible. That's

not Bob. That's not my Bob.

She grabs Doug by his shirt trying to convince him.

Doug.. It's not him. Tell me it's

not him. It's not my Bob!

The poor woman has lost her mind. Ethel erupts in laughter

pointing to her dead husband.

That is not my Bob! That is not my

Bob! That's not him!

Lynn and Bobby are paralyzed. Doug turns to his wife.

Take your mother away from here!

With her eyes fixed on her father, Lynn walks her mother

away.

In Bobby's eyes, sadness has been replaced by hatred. Full of

rage, the youngster grabs the gun and walks away.

66.

Where are you going? Bobby?

I'm gonna take care of the

motherfuckers!

Come back here, Bobby!

Bobby disappears into the night.

Doug covers Big Bob's face with a blanket.

75 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 75

Returning to the trailer, Lynn struggles to restrain Ethel.

Ethel finally realizes it's too late for her husband and

collapses into her daughter's arms.

Just then, a muffled scream from Brenda pierces the night.

Oh my god!

Lynn runs inside leaving her mother alone.

76 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 76

Bursting into the trailer, Lynn stops on a dime when she sees

Lizard, in Ethel's clothes, holding the baby.

Behind him, Pluto restrains Brenda.

Lizard walks up with the baby.

Big fat baby good.., you fat... Fat

and juicy!

Lynn is paralyzed with fear.

Lizard imitates a mother cradling her baby.

Baby... Baby...

Instinctively, Lynn grabs the closest thing, a FRYING PAN,

and hits Lizard brutally in the face.

67.

Stunned, he falls to the ground and drops the baby, who

begins to wail.

when he lifts his head, Lynn strikes again-

He blocks her arm and twists it, bringing her to her knees.

Lynn tries to fight him off, but he is too strong.

Still restrained, Brenda spots the PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER under

the sleeper. The one Bobby had used to fix the A/C.

At the other end of the trailer, Lizard has immobilized Lynn

and POINTS THE GUN AT THE BABY!

Lynn stops.

No...No...Please... Please don't...

Without a word, Lizard tears off Lynn's shirt and bra.

The gun stays pointed at the baby as-

Lizard removes Ethel's sun hat and hovers over Lynn's

breast...

Seen from behind her shoulder, we can't figure out exactly

what this mental case is doing... Is he nursing from her

breast?

Lynn trembles, but can only think of her baby and her sister,

who are still threatened.

Excited by what his brother is doing, Pluto fondles Brenda.

Suddenly, Ethel jumps into the trailer with a broom and

starts batting away at Lizard.

For once, her adrenaline kicks in as she fights for the most

important thing in her life - Her family.

The broom has little effect and is almost comical...

BANG! - Lizard shoots Ethel in her chest, throwing her back.

77 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 77

From far away, Bobby hears the gunshot. He quickly turns

around to help his family.

68.

78 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 78

In the trailer home, Brenda takes advantage of the confusion

to get away from Pluto and grabs the Phillips screwdriver

from beneath the sleeper.

Brenda slides the screwdriver to Lynn who raises it and is

about to strike when-

BANG! - Lynn is shot in the chest.

Lizard turns to Brenda and aims at her head.

He is about to shoot when Lynn, with her last breath-

PLANTS THE PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER IN HIS THIGH. IT STARTS

TEARING THROUGH HIS FLESH!

Lizard screams in pain and turns the gun back to Lynn-

BANG! - He blows off part of her skull.

Blood splatters throughout the cabin.

79 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 79

Alarmed by the gunfire, Doug gets up and looks at the trailer

in the distance. He doesn't know what to do.

Bobby appears behind him-

Come on Doug! They're in the

trailer-!

They both take off running.

80 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 80

Witness to the slaughter, Brenda is petrified with fear.

Lizard pulls out the screwdriver and stands with difficulty.

He picks up the baby and hands it to Pluto.

Take it.

Pluto obeys. Lizard grabs Brenda by the hair and pulls her

out of the trailer.

69.

Come on bitch...

She screams and resists by grabbing at furniture and pulling

off the curtains...

Her nails scratch against the paneling.

BEFORE LEAVING, LIZARD RIPS THE JEWELRY FROM ETHEL AND LYNN'S

BODY...

81 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 81

Brenda is pulled out by Lizard.

When he sees Bobby and Doug approaching, Lizard changes his

HE INSERTS THE BARREL OF HIS GUN INTO BRENDA'S MOUTH...

Brenda is wide eyed. Without hesitating, Lizard pulls the

CLICK! - no more bullets.

Lizard drops Brenda.

I'll come back for ya...

Lizard disappears into the night.

Brenda lays on the ground trembling and crying.

Doug arrives at the trailer, while Bobby aims the 9mm at the

assassins.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

It's too late. They're gone.

Bobby runs to his traumatized sister laying on the ground. He

holds her in his arms, trying to calm her down.

Doug approaches the open door. He notices bloody hand prints

along the side of the trailer home- One of the attackers has

been hurt...

82 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 82

Doug enters the trailer unable to imagine the tragedy.

70.

Horrified, he discovers Ethel on the couch, not quite dead,

but short of breath and in pain.

Doug is stone faced-

ON THE GROUND, LYNN'S BODY, HIS OWN WIFE, SOAKS IN HER BLOOD!

His eyes fill with tears. He tries to keep from crying but

his sadness is too deep.

His hand approaches her face. His fingers graze her hair.

SUDDENLY, LYNN'S BODY SUFFERS A LAST MUSCLE SPASM, LIKE A

CIRCUIT SHORTING OUT.

Doug tries to breathe life back into her body, but death has

overtaken her open eyes. He closes them and starts weeping.

The music from the Fisher Price mobile is the only other

sound...

Doug turns around. THE CRIB IS EMPTY...

No...No...

He squeezes his fist with rage.

83 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 83

At the foot of the burnt tree, Big Bob's body is laid out on

some rocks, the blanket over his face.

A few figures emerge out of the darkness and gather around

the body like a pack of hyenas.

BIG BOB IS DRAGGED AWAY THROUGH THE DUST...

84 EXT. HILLS - NIGHT 84

Backlit by the moon, at the top of the hill, we find Goggle

and his binoculars.

Reflecting in the lenses, we see the carters' trailer glowing

in the night.

A rustling noise attracts his attention.

71.

Before Goggle can turn around, a wild animal jumps at his

face- IT'S BEAST.

The German shepherd tears at Goggle's face and locks deep

into his throat. Goggle tries to fight it off, but the animal

is determined to kill.

Goggle grabs AN OLD RAZOR out of his pocket and tries to cut

the animal.

The dog bites down tightening its grip. BONES CRACK.

He drops the razor. Goggle's derby hat falls between some

rocks.

BEAST AVENGES BEAUTY IN A BLOODFEST!

Someone calls him on the on walkie-talkie-

RADIO (O.S.)

"Goggle? Goggle..."

Goggle will not answer anymore...

85 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 85

Laid out on the couch, Ethel agonizes between life and death.

Brenda stares into space, saying nothing. Doug touches her

head as he passes. Instinctively, she backs off terrified.

Across the trailer, Bobby paces back and forth.

What are we going to do Doug? What

are we going to do if they come

back?

Completely defeated, Doug comes back and goes to Ethel's

side.

Doug!

Doug does not answer and takes Ethel's hand. She opens her

eyes and looks at him as if nothing happened.

This camper's so small. No matter

how much you clean, it's always a

mess.

72.

Doug nods in silence.

Is Big Bob home?

Not yet.

Did everyone go to bed?

Yes, Brenda is here and Bobby is in

the kitchen.

At the other end, Bobby turns away, crying. Brenda looks away

as well.

(short of breath)

Is Lynn sleeping?

Doug holds back the tears.

Yes..

(after a beat)

Do you need anything?

Ethel finds it more and more difficult to talk.

Look in the closet Doug, I'm sure I

have another blanket. I'm so cold.

Doug tucks one of the blankets around her.

There's one here. Nice and warm.

You've always been so sweet. I

understand why Lynn loves you so

much.

She raises her arm to caress his face.

Her hand falls on the bed. Lifeless.

Brenda screams, bursting into tears.

73.

At the same time Bobby pounds his fist against a wall. His

eyes full of hate, he joins Doug.

Come on! I'm not going to take this

shit...

Doug gets mad as well.

DON'T BE STUPID! WE'RE NOT GOING

ANYWHERE, DO YOU HEAR ME?

Fine. You stay here. I'm going

after them.

Doug gets between Bobby and the door, preventing the kid from

leaving.

Let me go!

You want to die, too?

I don't care.

Doug drags him in front of his mother's body.

Look! Look at what they did to your

mother. Look at what they did to

your sister.

He slams Bobby against the door.

You're not a fucking child,

alright? Think before you do

something stupid. You won't make it

three feet! We need a plan, OK? We

need to think...

Think about what? They have

Catherine, Doug...

Doug remains silent...

74.

THEY HAVE CATHERINE... You know what

they could to do to her, and you're

not going to stop them?! You're

just a coward...

Doug jumps back on Bobby grabbing him by the collar.

STOP IT! SHUT UP! JUST SHUT YOUR

FUCKING MOUTH!

A MUFFLED SOUND COMES FROM OUTSIDE!

They all freeze.

Doug releases Bobby and immediately turns off the light.

Plunged in darkness, Brenda panics again-

No.. No... don't turn it off!

He swore he'd come back to get me.

He swore it. Don't let him take me,

Bobby!

Outside, another noise, AND A SHADOW PASSES BACKLIT BY THE

CAMPFIRE!

THEY'RE HERE... THEY'RE BACK... I

DON'T WANT TO DIE BOBBY...I DON'T

WANT TO DIE...DO SOMETHING...

Bobby picks up the gun-

BANG! BANG! BANG! - With no hesitation, he shoots through the

door.

Brenda throws herself into Doug's arms.

Bobby stares at the bullet holes in the trailer door.

Suddenly, the sound of a radio is heard-

RADIO (O.S.)

"Goggle, you copy? Goggle..."

Bobby and Doug look at each other confused.

75.

RADIO (O.S.) (CONT'D)

"Goggle?"

Doug silently moves closer to the door.

From outside we can see Doug's eye through one of the bullet

holes. Nobody, everything seems quiet.

Get ready Bobby..

Doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight.

From beneath the trailer, someone observes him...

Doug bends down and discovers-

GOGGLE'S SEVERED ARM. In its hand, the walkie-talkie still

works.

RADIO (O.S.)

"Goggle? Goggle?"

Doug grabs the radio. It's dripping with blood.

Bobby is about to join him when Doug signals-

THERE'S SOMEONE HIDING UNDER THE TRAILER.

Without a sound, Bobby aims the gun at the kitchen floor.

Outside, Doug backs up to see who is hiding.

Behind the step ladder, he sees an inert shape in the

shadows.

BANG! - Bobby shoots through the floor. Immediately, the

shadowy figure jumps out into the light-

Beast!

The dog jumps into Doug's arms and begins licking his face.

Bobby can't believe it, his dog has returned.

Radio static comes back on the walkie. Bobby picks it up-

RADIO (O.S.)

"Papa Jupe... Goggle is dead. I

found him in the rocks..."

"Dead?"

76.

"They got him. He's all torn

up..."

Bobby is proud of Beast. Still in the trailer, Brenda looks

at them, not as hopeful.

Good boy.. That's a good dog.

PAPA DUPE/RADIO (O.S.)

"I'm gonna take care of those

bastards myself"...

Bobby exchanges a worried glance with Doug. Even though

neither of the two has yet met Papa Jupe, something in his

voice tells them that it's only going to get worse.

Doug grabs the radio-

(in the radio)

WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT? WHY ARE

YOU DOING THIS TO US?!

No answer. Just static.

ANSWER ME! WHY US?!

Give me back my little girl... Give

her back to me...

More static...

DO YOU HEAR ME?!

Silence. Suddenly we hear-

CATHERINE'S CRIES ON THE RADIO!

Doug drops the radio, scared speechless...

How much ammo do you have left?

I don't know, half a clip?

77.

86 INT. DARK PLACE - NIGHT 86

On a dimly lit wooden table, Catherine lays, wrapped in a

blanket.

A butcher's knife is planted next to her...

Asthmatic breathing, and the sound of running water punctuate

the silence.

Ruby steps out of the darkness and moves towards the baby.

She watches through her abnormally large eyes and extends her

stringy fingers to touch the baby.

A large screen splits the room in two.

A strangely shaped shadow moves behind the screen: A

HANDICAPPED BODY washed by A LARGE WOMAN...

An empty wheel chair rests in a corner.

Amused, Ruby looks at the baby who smiles back. She carefully

takes Catherine in her arms when the invalid's voice

LARGE WOMAN (O.S.)

Put that down Ruby... You know

better than to play with your

food...

Ruby takes a step back, hugging the baby tighter.

Mama, pleaaase...

HANDICAPPED (O.S.)

(weak asthmatic voice)

Listen to your mother Ruby and put

that baby down... Now!

Frightened, Ruby obeys and quickly runs out of the room.

The baby starts crying...

87 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 87

Brenda sits by the C/B and retries the SOS calls.

78.

Mayday... Mayday... We need help

..Mayday... Mayday... can anybody

hear me?

Something has gone off in her eyes. She is absent, no longer

living, just surviving.

Doug is about to leave, taking with him anything from the

trailer which might be useful.

BASEBALL BAT, FLASHLIGHT, PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER...

Let me go with you.

No, you stay here with your sister

and stay by the radio. Somebody's

bound to hear us.

Brenda continues her distress call.

Mayday...mayday... Can anybody hear

me?

The sun'll be up soon. One of them

is hurt, I'm going to follow his

trail through the hills.

Bobby pulls out the 9mm gun and hands it to him.

No. You keep it in case they come

back.

What about you?

Don't worry about me, I'll take

Beast.

Beast sits at his feet ready to go. Doug straps the walkie-

talkie over his shoulder.

Doug?

79.

Yes?

I... I didn't mean what I said...

Doug hugs him like a brother.

Before walking out, he bends down to Lynn's body and kisses

her one last time on the mouth.

I'm going to find.our baby my

love...I promise.

88 EXT. HILLS - SUNRISE 88

The first sign of dawn lights the distant horizon.

The vultures perched on a dead Joshua Tree swivel their heads

around, to see a distant, running FIGURE -

DOUG AND BEAST, moving steadily among the rocks.

89 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - DAY 89

Doug and Beast arrive at the old mine's entrance on the side

of the hill. The trail of blood leads inside.

Doug hides behind a rock. Sweating, he catches his breath.

Beast breathes heavily as well. Doug remembers what his wife

always used to say-

(to the dog)

I told you to stop smoking.

Doug sets a different frequency on his radio-

(Into the walkie)

Bobby? Bobby? You read me?

BOBBY (O.S.)

Yeah, Doug...

I followed the blood, I'm in front

of a mine!

80.

I'm not sure if I'll get a signal

from inside. If you don't hear from

me in a half an hour, you're on

your own.

Bobby?

Yeah... Good luck, Doug.

He puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight.

You ready big guy? I hope you're

not afraid of the dark.

He pets the dog one final time and stands up.

90 INT. MINE - DAY 90

With the light from the entrance behind him, shadow enters

the mine.

The beam from his flashlight follows the trail of blood on

the ground.

The wooden pylons which have held up the walls for a hundred

years threaten to crumble at any second.

Only static on the radio. Doug turns it off.

He moves further into the darkness, probing with his

flashlight into the inky pit.

Doug arrives at a fork splitting the tunnel off in two

different directions.

Doug lights each tunnel with the flashlight until he finds

the one with-the blood trail, then continues on into that

one. Tracking.

Suddenly he stops.

The beam of the flashlight has revealed TWO DOZEN PICKAXES

that have been planted in the ground over mounds. That look

very much like graves. The pickaxes look eerily like crosses,

given the whole place the feel of A SUBTERRANEAN GRAVEYARD.

Hanging from the graves, dates and portraits of all the

miners who have died here, including women and children...

The flashlight dims. Doug taps it to no avail.

81.

Scratch! - He lights a match.

Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until

he arrives at another fork. He can no longer see the blood

trail.

A SHAPE SLIDES SWIFTLY BEHIND HIM!

(to Beast, meaning

Just stay calm, boy...

A gust of air kills the match.

He immediately lights another-

Again, THE DRAFT SNUFFS IT OUT.

He turns around, looking for the source of the air, and

notices a reflection of light at the end of the tunnel.

He moves towards the reflection.

91 EST. MINE EXIT - DAY 91

On the other side of the hill, the collapsed wooden beams and

stones block part of the mine's exit.

Doug emerges with Beast. His eyes takes a moment to adapt to

the bright sunlight.

He. cannot believe what he sees. At the bottom of a hill, A

SMALL TOWN - A CLASSIC ONE-STREET TOWN BUILT BACK IN THE

50'S.

Doug turns the walkie on.

.Bobby, Bobby, it's Doug... I

can't believe it! I found a street

and some houses. Maybe somebody

does live here...

The radio remains silent.

82.

Bobby, do you hear me? Bobby?

Still nothing. Doug turns around and looks up-

A wall of rock towers behind him.

He tries one last time, but the signal won't go through.

92 INT. TRAILER - DAY 92

Close up on the C/B radio in the trailer-

Only static comes from the speakers.

93 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 93

Whoosh! - a match sets it on fire creating a thick, black,

smoke signal.

Brenda joins her brother who is busy planting wooden stakes

in a circle fifty meters around the trailer.

Maybe somebody heard our calls..

Nobody's going to find us Brenda,

even with that smoke...Nobody's

coming._.. You heard what Doug

said-We're alone now, just you

and me. Let them come, I'm waiting

for them.

Now, Bobby stretches the nylon wire from the fishing pole

around each stake. He sets the fishing pole next to the

trailer, rigging to it one of Catherine's TOY SHAKERS-

An improvised alarm system.

94 EXT. HILLS - DAY 94

At the summit, somebody observes the trailer and the thick

cloud of smoke rising to the air.

83.

95 EXT. TOWN - DAY 95

Doug runs down the hills towards the town. Behind him, from

the mouth of the mine, someone observes between the rocks-

it's Ruby.

Doug slows his pace as he enters Main Street. The town is

deserted. No sign of life anywhere. All the houses and cars

are covered with a thick layer of dust.

Taking a closer look, he realizes all the parked cars are

from the 50's.

Uncertain, Doug walks through the ghost town, with Beast at

his side...

No movement besides the wind blowing and lifting an

occasional cloud of dust. Doug walks up to a house and knocks

on the front door.

No one to open the door. Doug wipes one of the windows-

It's too dark inside to see anything. The door is unlocked,

Doug pushes it.

It squeaks open. He hesitates before entering.

96 INT. FIRST HOUSE - DAY 96

Sunlight passes through the dusty windows revealing a

living/dining room decorated from the 50's.

Doug can't believe his eyes-

Through the kitchen door, he can see a woman doing dishes.

A man sits in the living room reading a newspaper.

Children play in front of the blank TV set...

THESE ARE NOT REAL PEOPLE BUT MANNEQUINS!

They have been dressed and placed into real life situations.

THE ATOMIC SYMBOL CAN BE FOUND ON EACH OF THEIR FOREHEADS.

Doug spots a telephone behind the staircase and checks for a

dial tone.

Nothing. He picks up the phone casing.

EMPTY. JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE HOUSE, IT'S FARE.

84.

97 EXT. TOWN - DAY 97

Doug quickly crosses Main Street to visit another house.

98 INT. SECOND HOUSE - DAY 98

New interior- New surreal setting.

Around a table, a family of test dummies eat dinner.

99 EXT. TOWN - DAY 99

Stupefied, Doug enters yet another house.

The door remains open as we see another family of dummies

living a perfect little life. A LIFE WHICH STOPPED IN THE

LATE 50'S...

Around the corner of a house, a little girl dummy is sitting

on a swing, her face half broken.

A second later, Doug thinks he hears CHILDREN LAUGHING. He

Nothing but the wind blowing through the houses.

Doug takes Catherine's bib from his pocket and lets Beast get

its scent.

Find her, Beast, find Catherine...

With his nose to the ground, the dog pulls Doug straight

ahead.

Doug walks away through the streets, pulled by the dog.

On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the

sand. On it, an old metallic sign reads-

TEST SITE 3B - MILITARY ZONE - HIGH RADIATION RISK

The scent leads Doug into an alley off the main street.

He sees an old generator on full throttle. A thick smoke

pours from the exhaust.

SOMEONE LIVES HERE!

His daughter could be there...

85.

Doug tries to see into the windows, but they are caked in

filth. He decides to go around when-

A MAN WALKS INTO VIEW WITHOUT SEEING HIM!

Immediately, Doug backs away.

The man drags a cadaver by its feet. Half of the dead body

is missing, having apparently been torn off.

Beast GROWLS.

The man turns around, revealing his horrible face-

A METALLIC BRACE is screwed on four sides of his head helping

him stand straight. ENORMOUS CYSTS DISFIGURE HIM AND COVER

EVERY VISIBLE PART OF HIS BODY. Let's call him "CYST".

Cyst traces back his steps, trying to find what caused the

noise. He holds the gas station attendant's shotgun!

The alley is empty. The generators are still motoring.

All seems normal. Cyst turns back towards main street.

Cyst passes an old'parked car without seeing Doug and the dog

hidden inside.

Doug breathes a sigh of relief. Close call.

Quietly, Doug gets out of the car. He hesitates as to whether

he should bring Beast with him or to leave him in the car.

The dog could be his best weapon but, on the other hand, he

also represents a_bigger risk to be spotted.

You wait here Beast! Come on,

sit!... Good boy. I'm gonna find

Catherine...

The dog is confused and whines through the half-opened

window.

Shhhh... Quiet Beast... Don't move!

I'll be back...

He closes the car door and starts down the alley, lowering

his head.

86.

From inside the car, Beast watches Doug getting further

away...

Doug sneaks along the side of the building towards the front

door.

He hesitates, unsure of what awaits him inside-

102 INT. HOUSE - DAY 102

Doug crosses a doorway without making a sound. He enters the

front hall squeezing the bat in his hands.

Something in the air, A DISGUSTING SMELL, catches his

attention. Doug moves slowly and discovers, in the dining

room, sitting amongst the dummies-

BIG BOB'S CHARRED BODY!

His father-in-law's arms have been torn off and devoured. THE

AMERICAN FLAG that used to adorn his SUV is planted THROUGH

HIS FOREHEAD!

Doug approaches terrified.

BEHIND HIM A WEAK AND ASTHMATIC VOICE BEGINS TO SING THE

VOICE (O.S.)

"Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's

early light,

What so proudly we hailed at the

twilight's last gleaming?"

Doug jumps and quickly lifts the baseball bat, ready to

swing.

Nobody. Just the fake living room filled with inert dummies.

No trace of his baby. An electrical fan turns in a corner,

close to a shelve full of old books...

Doug moves forward, gripping the bat tightly.

VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

(feeble and asthmatic)

"...Whose broad stripes and bright

stars, through the perilous

fight..."

He can hear his own heart beat as he searches through the

house. In another room, close to the window and in the

shadows, he sees someone sitting in a wheelchair.

87.

VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

"...And the rockets' red glare, the

bombs bursting in air..."

Doug gets closer-

A ray of light shines on the skull of whoever sits in the

wheel chair.

The wheel chair moves forward revealing a most horrific sight-

BIG BRAIN - We recognize the handicapped man whom we have

seen before, bathing behind the screen. Big Brain's body is

skeletal. He was born with a genetic disease giving him a

head ten times bigger than his face. A head so heavy, he is

unable to hold it up. It rests back on his chair, forcing him

to stretch his eyes to see from side to side.

Big Brain is maybe the most representative character of the

damage done by nuclear fallout in this area.

Doug threatens him with the baseball bat-

Where's my baby! Where's

Catherine?!

Big Brain does not answer.

What did you do with her?

..Nothing..

Doug is beyond his breaking point -

Where is she then? ANSWER ME!

He raises the bat.

(weak and asthmatic)

.I don't know where she is. I

never leave this place...

Big Brain moves away from the window wheeling himself to the

couch. His hands are thin and pale, like a child's.

88.

BIG BRAIN (CONT'D)

..You should've read the signs

before taking that road...

What signs?!

Boom. .. Boom... Boom

What the hell are you saying?!

(weak and asthmatic)

You people settled on our lands,

you destroyed our homes, destroyed

our silver mines. . .You 'ye made us

what we've become!

One day my father went into town

begging for your help, and you know

what the doctors did? They

sterilized him like a dog!

You thought that in the desert no

one would see anything, or say

anything, but the hills... The

hills never forget...

BOOM...BOOM...B000M!

I don't know what you're talking

about. All I want is my daughter.

Please...

Big Brain remains silent.

What do you want? Money? I can give

you money... WHAT DO YOU WANT?

Maybe a trailer? Yeah, a pretty

trailer, just like yours.

Where are the others? Where is my

baby?

Big brain starts laughing a high pitched sound.

89.

What? What's so funny?

IT'S BREAKFAST TIME!

At the same moment-

CRASH - PLUTO, THE DEFORMED BALD GIANT, PULVERIZES THE DOOR

WITH AN AXE AND SMASHES INTO THE HOUSE!

Like a wild animal, Pluto charges Doug, destroying everything

in his path.

Doug retreats in the living room, throwing the dummies at his

assailant.

The giant comes closer and closer.

Dummies are chopped into pieces.

Doug dodges away and tries to escape, using the stairs in the

hallway but the giant grabs him by the feet and pulls him

down...

The axe swings through the air missing him by a hair each

time.

103 INT. 1950 CAR - DAY 103

Sensing his master is in trouble, Beast jumps around inside

the car trying to find an exit...

The passenger window opening is too small for him to break

out...

104 INT. HOUSE - DAY 104

Doug runs into another room, escaping from Pluto and his axe.

Instinctively, he uses the first piece of furniture he can

find, A CHEST, to block the door behind him. He looks

desperately for an exit. No way out.

The axe penetrates through the door. The chest won't be

enough to hold back Pluto.

Second axe blow- This time the axe tears up the boards of the

door, allowing Pluto to stick his gruesome face inside.

Seeing Doug trapped in the room, the bald giant begins to

laugh stupidly before turning around and walking away.

90.

CRASH! - PLUTO EXPLODES THROUGH THE WALL, LANDING ON TOP OF

DOUG!

Doug loses his bat but slides away before the axe comes

swinging down.

Desperate, he picks up the bat and uses it as a shield. The

axe splits it in half.

Doug throws himself at Pluto plunging the splintered bat into

his abdomen.

The sharp piece of wood enters Pluto's stomach.

Completely out of his mind, Pluto removes the piece of wood

from his abdomen and beats Doug in the face with it, sending

him across the room.

Pluto lowers his head, charging Doug like a bull. Doug

crashes into one of the walls.

He can't even take a breath before the giant grabs him by the

leg like a rag doll and throws him through a wall.

Doug falls to the ground in the living room. Wounded and

exhausted, he is also defenseless. He has lost his glasses.

Not far away, Big Brain savors the spectacle.

The giant walks to him spinning the axe in his hand like a

baton.

His foot crushes Doug's glasses on the floor.

The axe swings through the air. Doug jumps out of the way.

THE AXE STRIKES INTO HIS LEFT HAND, CUTTING OFF SOME FINGERS!

Doug stares wide eyed at his amputated fingers and screams

with pain.

Blood is everywhere.

In an act of self preservation, Doug crawls under the table.

91.

Pluto destroys it with the axe and advances to finish him

off.

His asymmetrical eyes stare coldly-

Doug is at his mercy.

Pluto slowly caresses the axe's blade on his victims throat

and face.

The sharp blade moves dangerously across Doug's skin. Pluto

stops when he sees Doug holding his PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER!

Pluto laughs like a dumb child at the feeble weapon. Behind

him, Big Brain joins in on the laughter-

Disfigured by his wounds, Doug is frozen with the screwdriver

pointed at the giant. He looks ridiculous and starts sobbing

like a terrorized child.

Please, I'm begging you... Don't

kill me...

(making fun of him)

Loook at-t hiiis fa-ace... Loook at-

at hiiis fa-ace...

Even the frozen faces of the test dummies seem to mock him.

Doug stops crying_instantly, it was a trick!

He turns the screwdriver around and slams it into Pluto's

foot.

The screwdriver goes through the shoe nailing Pluto to the

floor. Pluto screams in pain.

Doug rises and moves behind him. In a swift movement, Doug

takes the American flag from Big Bob's forehead, stabbing

Pluto in the back of the neck!

OLD GLORY'S STAFF COMES THROUGH HIS THROAT ON THE OTHER SIDE.

Pluto screams again, dropping the axe.

Outraged, Pluto tears the flag from his neck and turns to

Doug.

92.

DOUG IS HOLDING THE AXE.

The blade swings through the air and slams into Pluto's

skull!

Pluto's eyes freeze and his body falls to the ground, his

skull half open. DOUG JUMPS ON TOP OF HIM. FULL OF RAGE, HE

MUTILATES PLUTO WITH THE AXE TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION.

Big Brain watches Pluto die without showing any emotion.

Silence returns to the destroyed house.

Doug tears off a piece of Pluto's shirt and uses it as a

BANDAGE for his hand...

He picks up his half broken shattered glasses on the floor

and put them back.

SLING! - Doug removes the bloody axe from the corpse. He

turns to Big Brain, who backs off-

The baby... the baby is in the last

house on the left...

105 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 105

The back door to the SUV opens, revealing Bobby and Brenda

carrying Lynn's body inside where Ethel's body has been

moved.

Not far from the car and above the fishing pole, Catherine's

shaker remains still and silent...

106 EXT. TOWN - DAY 106

Still imprisoned in the car, Beast barks, desperate to find a

way out.

A hundred yards away-

Cyst crosses Main Street toward Big Brain's house still

holding the shotgun.

Through the broken door, Cyst spots Pluto in a pool of blood.

Hatred fills his eyes as he loads the shotgun and prepares to

shoot.

93.

He looks for Doug but sees no one.

Cyst moves in between a few cars, failing to see Doug hiding

behind one of them.

Doug hits the man in his knee with the axe.

HE SEVERS HALF OF HIS RIGHT LEG. Cyst screams in agony.

In one swift move, Doug removes the axe from Cyst's kneecap

swinging it into his back.

Cyst falls on the ground.

The fall pushes the axe further into his back. Cyst reaches

for the shotgun lost in his fall.

Doug steps on his chest and pushes slowly-

Crack - The axe finally hits the spine, killing him

instantly.

Doug picks up the shotgun.

107 INT. HOUSE - DAY 107

From the broken window, Big Brain watches Doug walk away

down Main Street. He picks up a walkie-talkie hidden in his

Lizard... Kill the baby...

108 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 108

Lizard enters the house holding a MACHETE. The wound Lynn had

given him before she died still bleeds through his improvised

bandage.

He moves to the kitchen with a limp. There, he comes face to

face with Ruby. Behind her, the baby is wrapped inside a

blanket on the table.

The kitchen walls are covered with dry blood. Severed human

remains are scattered about and hanging like slabs of meat.

Ruby blocks his way-

Get out of the way Ruby...

94.

Ruby refuses to let him pass. Lizard lifts the machete

threatening his little sister.

I TOLD YOU TO MOVE. NOW MOVE!

Scared, Ruby obeys and runs out the kitchen door. Lizard

approaches the baby, who moves inside the blanket.

109 INT. LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT- DAY 109

At the same time, Doug arrives at the last house on the

street.

He looks for his baby in every part of the house.

Nothing but dummies.

Doug enters a room and sees a crib.

Catherine?!

He goes to the crib and discovers a plastic doll...

BIG BRAIN LIED!

You want to play with us mister?

Doug turns around and sees two children playing in the

shadows. They smile at him kindly-

THEIR FACES AND LITTLE BODIES ARE MONSTROUSLY DEGENERATED!

Doug backs away terrified.

110 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 110

Lizard is about to butcher the baby on the table.

Catherine is calm and moves slowly under the blanket.

111 EXT. TOWN - DAY 111

In a panic, Doug runs out of the last house screaming.

CATHERINE!

95.

112 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 112

Lizard lifts the machete and removes the blanket-

THE BABY HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE PIGLET STOLEN FROM THE GAS

STATION!

Ruby made the swap before Lizard entered the kitchen.

The piglet runs off oinking...

RUUUBY!

Enraged, Lizard sticks the machete into the table.

113 EXT. HILLS - DAY 113

Outside, with the baby in her arms, Ruby runs as fast as she

can.

114 EXT. TOWN - DAY 114

Desperate, Doug runs through the test town looking for his

daughter.

In an upstairs window, he sees Ruby's mother, THE OBESE

WOMAN, swinging on a rocking chair staring back.

Suddenly, coming from the hills, Doug hears the sound of a

baby crying. In the distance, he spots Ruby running through

the rocks. He runs with the shotgun in hand.

Catherine!

115 EXT./INT. 1950 CAR - DAY 115

Under the fake car, in between the seats, Beast finds a hole

big enough to fit his nose.

The animal forces his way through, scratching at the floor

until he finally fits his body through the hole and out of

the car.

The dog runs down Main Street...

116 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 116

Back on the trailer-

96.

Sweating, Bobby joins his sister hidden behind the SW. With

the 9mm in hand, staring at the horizon, he is ready to face

the enemy.

Above the fishing pole, Catherine's shaker is still.

Gust of wind blow on the eerily silent plains.

Suddenly, in a flash, the fishing line tightens and THE

SHAKER MOVES AROUND, MAKING NOISE.

Then, quiet returns as if nothing had ever happened.

Brenda is terrified. Maybe someone has crossed their zone of

security.

Bobby Lifts his head and looks a full 360A-

NOTHING.

Bobby and Brenda exchange worried glances when-

THE FISHING POLE MOVES, SHAKING CATHERINE'S SHAKER

FRENETICALLY.

The fishing reel quickly unwinds...

This time there is little room for doubt, even if all seems

clear around the camper.

I don't.see anybody... What's

happening?

Bobby and Brenda leave their hiding place. They move, back to

back, cautious...

answer me, why isn't anyone there?

I'm scared...

Stay close Brenda.

From inside the SW, we see the two adolescents getting

further away when-

A DARK FIGURE JUMPS IN THE FOREGROUND, IN FRONT OF THE

WINDOW!

97.

It's PAPA JUPITER. His long hair and thick beard cover

everything except his determined and PSYCHOPATHIC EYES.

Bobby and Brenda have arrived at the end of their security

zone...

Look!

Further ahead, on the ground, a tumbleweed is stuck on the

fishing wire, moving it in the wind.

Let's go back...

Not convinced, Bobby agrees, but his face freezes when he

turns back to see- THE BACK DOOR OF THE SUV, WIDE OPEN.

At a loss, Bobby and Brenda return.

THEIR MOTHER'S BODY HAS BEEN REMOVED!

What happened? What happened Bobby?

Where's mom?

A trail of blood leads from the trailer to somewhere behind

some rocks.

He's over there. Get the trailer

ready.._

The new "visitor" has brought the nightmare back to life in

Brenda's eyes. She's paralyzed.

Brenda? Come on?

Brenda remains still.

BRENDA?!

Terrorized, Brenda backs up to the trailer, while her

brother, with a determined look on his face, walks to the

hills.

98.

117 INT. TRAILER - DAY 117

Brenda returns to the trailer where two propane tanks have

been brought out from under the sink.

Through the window, she watches her brother get further out.

118 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 118

What Bobby discovers behind the rocks is beyond horrific-

Kneeling next to his mother's corpse, Papa Jupiter devours

her heart, tearing into it with his teeth. FEELING BOBBY'S

PRESENCE, HE TURNS AROUND AND STARES AT THE YOUNG MAN WITH A

SADISTIC SMILE. BLOOD DRIPS DOWN HIS BEARD.

Bobby points his gun at him.

Papa Jupiter stands and, in a fit of rage, charges at Bobby.

Keeping his cool, Bobby fires-

BANG! BANG! BANG! The bullets only slow him down.

CLICK! The gun is empty.

119 INT. TRAILER - DAY 119

Brenda opens the valves to the gas tanks.

120 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 120

.Outside, Bobby throws the gun and runs to the trailer as fast

as he can. _

Papa Jupiter is right behind him.

He takes a SMALL PICKAXE from his belt and throws it at

Bobby.

THE PICKAXE STICKS INTO THE TRAILER INCHES FROM BOBBY'S FACE!

121 INT. TRAILER - DAY 121

Bobby enters the trailer, closing the door behind him. He

quickly tapes matches at the bottom of the door, right above

the striking part of the matchbox on the floor.

Next to him, the propane flows freely.

99.

122 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 122

Behind the trailer, Brenda helps her brother squeeze out of

the back window.

They both run and hide behind a rock.

At the same time, Papa Jupiter stands in front of the trailer

door, relishing the idea that his victims are inside.

He opens the door. The matches strike-

PAPA JUPITER IS ENGULFED IN THE FLAMES.

THE TRAILER HOME EXPLODES!

Protected by the rocks, Bobby and Brenda watch as the

explosion climbs to the sky. They did it...

127 EXT. HILLS EDGE - DAY 127

With Catherine held tightly in her arms, Ruby runs on the

edge of the mountain.

Seventy yards behind, Lizard gives chase with a limp and the

chain of spikes in tow.

Ruby...Ruby! You come back here

right now. You hear me, you little

bitch?

The road on the edge comes to a dead end.

Ruby is stuck, the only way out is to climb. Without using

her hands, she attempts to ascend. It's close to impossible.

SUDDENLY, LIZARD GRABS HER ANKLE!

She tries to fight him off, but he is too strong.

Ruby kicks him in the jaw enraging him more. He pulls her

down swiftly when-

BEAST APPEARS BEHIND RUBY!

The animal shows his teeth, advancing towards Lizard who

backs off.

100.

Lizard is amused and almost excited with this last

confrontation... Discreetly, he grabs the chain of spikes

while keeping his eyes on the barking German Shepherd.

THE RUSTY, RETRACTABLE SPIKES ARE RELEASED ALONG THE CHAIN!

Beast sees the weapon and leaps towards Lizard.

Too late. The chain strikes the dog in the air, sending him

over the edge.

BEAST WHINES AS HE LANDS ON A PROTRUDING SECTION OF THE

RAVINE A FEW FEET FURTHER DOWN...

Ruby refuses to hand over the baby, holding it tightly to her

chest.

Give me that baby, Ruby!

With no time to react, Lizard is brutally struck in the face

with the shotgun butt-

DOUG IS BACK!

Taking no chances and screaming like a wild beast, Doug beats

Lizard repeatedly pushing him away from the baby.

With a bloodied face, Lizard can hardly stand.

Doug turns the weapon around and-

BANG! - He shoots Lizard in the chest.

Lizard is thrown back with the force.

Doug reloads still screaming-

BANG! Lizard is hit in the throat and falls.to his knees.

Blood sprays everywhere.

Doug reloads again-

BANG! - hit in the shoulder, Lizard falls back in the dirt.

His face slams into the dust.

Exhausted, Doug walks over to his adversary.

He is dead.

Disfigured with wounds, Doug turns to Ruby, who extends the

baby.

Doug can barely comprehend it - the nightmare is finally

over!

He. drops the smoking gun and opens his arms to embrace his

baby. He cries tears of joy as he holds Catherine close to

him.

My baby ...My little princess... It's

me, it's daddy...

He kisses the baby and hugs her tightly, elated. Ruby is

moved. She smiles when suddenly her face freezes-

LIZARD STANDS FIFTEEN FEET BEHIND, HOLDING THE SHOTGUN!

Trembling, he lifts the weapon towards Doug and the baby.

Instinctively, Ruby moves to stop him.

KA-CHUNK! - Lizard reloads.

His finger squeezes the trigger.

BANG!

At the last second, Ruby jumps on Lizard changing the

direction of the blast.

They both fall off the mountain into the emptiness. Their

bodies plunge a hundred feet down, splattering on the rocks

below.

RUBY HAS SACRIFICED HER OWN LIFE TO SAVE DOUG AND THE BABY.

130 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 130

One of the FAMILY PHOTOS of the carters posing with their

dogs is slowly burning away in the flames.

Pieces of the trailer still burn in the middle of the desert.

Surrounded by debris, Papa Jupiter's body is impaled.on a

darkened metal siding. Still alive but entirely burnt, his

skin is raw and unrecognizable. With every breath, blood

spits from his mouth...

Facing this post atomic creature, Bobby hesitates to take it

out of its misery. Brenda comes to his side-

102.

Come on, Bobby. Let's get out of

here...

Bobby's face has changed. He is no longer the innocent kid of

just a few hours ago. His eyes are now filled with rage and a

determination to survive and succeed no matter what.

Brenda and Bobby walk away from the burning trailer. On the

other side of the smoke, they see-

DOUG WALKING BACK WITH THE BABY, BEAST LIMPING AT HIS SIDE.

Exhausted, wounded, disfigured, but still alive.

131 EXT. HILLS - DAY 131

From a distance, next to the fiery trailer, we see Doug,

Brenda, and Bobby gathered around the baby. Reunited again.

FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE HILLS, SOMEONE OBSERVES THEM WITH

BINOCULARS.
