EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL INTERPLANETARY SPACE

A vast field of stars. The gas giant Neptune slowly spins

into view. Brilliant and blue and cold against the void.

EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL A BLACK SILHOUETTE

stands out against the planet, tiny against Neptune's scale.

EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL DRIFT CLOSER

to discern the hard angles of a man-made craft. A ship. No

longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges:

a vast labyrinth of steel.

Its shadow swallows all in darkness.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

Shafts of Neptune's blue light enter through windows,

illuminate debris suspended in the zero-gravity environment:

shards of metal and glass.

MOVE from the Corridor into:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

A cockpit for three. Neptune's blue light fills the chamber,

reflects off immobile particles in the air. Thick quartz

windows look down at Neptune. The cockpit lights are dark

but for one blinking red light.

An emergency beacon. Under-floor lights go on.

The strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the

helm, slowly spinning. He is dead, perfectly preserved in

the cold vacuum of space. His eyes are empty black pits and

his mouth hangs open in a scream: DR. WILLIAM WEIR.

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

Weir opens his eyes, waking from dream. Sweat beads his

ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist.

He turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment.

Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count

photographs. His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful

woman.

Weir reaches to the stand. Picks up...

RECENT, UNFRAMED PHOTO

The woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave

smile.

Weir lies back on the bed. Looks at the photo. Presses it to

his forehead and closes his eyes. Trying to be with her,

just one more time.

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

Weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a

straight-razor. The mirror reveals the bathtub just behind

him. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP...

Weir turns to stare at the bathtub. Water wells up at the

mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls...

DRIP.

Weir turns back to his shaving.

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

Weir stands in the kitchenette, staring at the microwave as

it cooks his breakfast.

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

Weir stands before his window, chewing his oatmeal

mechanically, forcing himself to swallow. He reaches out to

open the blinds...

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT REVERSE ANGLE

as the blinds pull aside, revealing Weir, upside-down.

ROTATE AND PULL BACK...

EXT. DAYLIGHT STATION - MODEL TO REVEAL DAYLIGHT STATION

Weir's window is just one of many in a space station, a

delicate combination of cylindrical habitats and solar panels.

The structure hangs above the Earth in low orbit.

TITLE CARD: DAYLIGHT SPACE STATION 08.23.2046

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT (BLINDS OPEN)

A videophone RINGS OS...

INT. DAYLIGHT - OFFICE

A military office, United States Aerospace Command seal

blazoned on the door. Views of the Earth. Admiral HOLLIS

sits behind his desk, a gruff career officer and a good man.

Weir enters, escorted by Hollis' adjutant, LYLE.

INT. HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system. A

box magnifies the eighth planet, Neptune, revealing a flashing

red dot in its orbit.

INT. DAYLIGHT OFFICE

Lyle hands Weir a stack of hardcopy data. Weir reads the

data with growing excitement.

Hollis answers drily.

Lyle looks at Weir, stunned by the request.

Lyle presses a button on Hollis' desk. An unholy GARBLE rips

from office speakers: STATIC and NOISE and INHUMAN VOICES.

Alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck. Together,

they are unbearable.

The sound mercifully cuts off to STATIC. Lyle stops the tape.

Weir sits there, stunned.

Hollis stares at Weir, judging the man with his eyes.

Weir leaves. The door closes behind him.

Beat.

EXT. DAYLIGHT STATION/EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK

The Lewis and Clark pulls away from Daylight station, turns

towards the depths of space. It is a tough-looking spacecraft,

all engine.

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

MOVE IN on thick quartz windows near the ship's nose: the

bridge...

Split level. Above: avionics, navigation, flight control.

STARCK (female, Navigator, sharp mind, sharp tongue) checks

the navigation data on her screen as SMITH (male, Pilot,

wrapped too tight) punches in the course.

The captain's chair drops from above, swivels to reveal MILLER

(male, Captain, intense).

Below: the bridge's "war-room" -- ship's systems and mission

stations. JUSTIN (male, Engineer, young hot-shot).

Miller slides down a ladder into the war-room. The others

follow into...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

Bulky EVA (extra-vehicular activity) suits line the walls.

MUSIC blares from a JAMBOX, built into a storage locker.

An Emergency Tech stows safety lines: COOPER -- male, the

resident pain-in-the-ass. He SINGS along with the music.

Cooper reaches up, turns off the box.

Cooper falls in as the crew continues into...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

Evidence of long term habitation. Personalized lockers. Fold-

down bunks, chairs, tables; currently stowed for docking. A

modular galley.

PETERS (female, Emergency Technician, the crew's denmother)

and DJ (male, Doctor, a cold perfectionist) load CO2 scrubbers

into a bin in the floor.

Weir stands to the side like a fifth wheel.

Weir hesitates, then follows the crew into Medical. Miller

hangs back.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL

A high tech operating room. Modular equipment. Vertical tanks

line the walls, each large enough to hold a human being:

gravity couches.

The crew stands before the gravity couches, almost nude, no

room for modesty.

Starck catches Cooper looking at her ass as she strips to

her undergarments. Cooper grins. She flips him off, not

bothering to turn around.

Miller disrobes. Two service tags hang around his neck. He

does not remove them. Weir approaches him.

Weir nods, moves to an empty couch bearing his name, written

on a piece of tape. Peters watches him.

She checks Weir's couch, helps him climb in. Weir keeps one

eye on Miller.

DJ swathes one of Weir's arms with alcohol.

Weir shakes his head.

DJ injects Weir. The scientist winces.

The overhead lights change to red.

DJ hands him the breathing mask.

Weir does. DJ checks the fit.

DJ closes the tank. It begins to fill with green gel. Weir's

eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits. His

eyes close. His body draws into a fetal position.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

THE ION ENGINE at the aft of the ship begins to glow a deep

red.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL

The crew hang inert in the gravity couches.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

SILENCE. The engine flares white hot. The Lewis and Clark

lances forward.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - INTERPLANETARY SPACE - MODEL

The Lewis and Clark races SILENTLY past. The engine at its

aft holds a sustained fusion reaction like the sun.

GRAPHIC: U.S.S. Lewis and Clark. 56 days out.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL CLOSE ON WEIR

immobile in the grav tank. He might be sleeping. He might be

dead. A distant SOUND echoes though the ship, the unholy

garble of human and inhuman voices -- it is the Event Horizon,

calling to him -- the sound refines into a WOMAN'S VOICE, no

more than a WHISPER:

Weir opens his eyes.

Weir's grav tank opens.

WIDER TO REVEAL

the seven bodies of the crew, suspended inert in the gel.

A sound: DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...

Weir slowly walks to the Bridge.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

A naked WOMAN sits at the helm, her back to us. Completely

still. Her skin is very pale. Water pools around her chair.

Weir stands behind her.

She does not answer. She does not move. Weir reaches out to

touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid.

He reaches out again. He touches her hair. She doesn't move.

Weir catches her reflection in the computer monitors.

Something wrong with her face... He starts to spin her around.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL

Weir awakes with a jolt, in his grav couch. His mask has

slipped. His tank has filled with blood. He is drowning.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL

Reality. Weir's eyes open. He presses against the glass of

the tank, trying to force it open, panicked. The others are

already stepping from open tanks.

Weir's tank opens with a HISS. He tumbles to the floor,

gasping, fluid streaming from his mouth.

Peters rushes to him.

Weir catches his breath. He looks up. The crew surrounds

him, concerned.

DJ helps him to his feet.

Weir nods.

Cooper, still butt-naked and proud of it, grabs a metal

cylinder from the wall and pours a mug for himself.

Starck gives him a cool once over.

Miller zips up.

EXT. INTERPLANETARY SPACE - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

SILENCE. The Lewis and Clark drifts towards Neptune.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

The crew has secured the quarters from flight status. Bunks

have been folded down, each alcove personalized with

photographs and pin-ups.

DJ moves around the cabin, checking the crew's radiation

badges.

Cooper and Justin sit on their bunks, tossing a handball

across the cabin.

Peters holds a "Watchman" video unit, watching a "video

letter"...

EXT. PETERS HOME - GARDEN (DENNY'S PARTY)

...from DENNY, her four-year-old son, a paraplegic, grinning

widely in his new wheelchair:

IN THE VIDEO, Peters enters shot, scoops her child from the

chair.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARKE - QUARTERS

Weir sits huddled in a blanket. Miller takes a seat next to

him.

Starck and Smith enter. Starck sits next to Miller.

Justin catches the ball, holds onto it.

Miller and the crew look at Weir, waiting. Weir clears his

throat.

The crew look at each other: they haven't heard that in a

mission briefing before.

STUNNED SILENCE. Then everyone talks at once:

In the quiet that follows:

The crew stares at Weir: he has just dropped another bomb on

them.

Weir thinks of another way to explain it. He rips a pin-up

from Smith's locker.

The crew stares at him. Starck decides to play.

Weir folds the paper, lining up point A over point B... then

THRUSTING his pen through both, skewering the pin-up.

Even Cooper is impressed.

EXT. INTERPLANETARY SPACE - MODEL

The Lewis and Clark flashes silently past, heading deeper

and deeper into space.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

The crew assembled.

Weir punches a button on a console. The transmission BLARES

from the bridge's speakers, STATIC and NOISE and, underneath

all, INHUMAN VOICES.

The crew listen, look at one another. The recording ends

abruptly.

He activates a different file. The resulting WAIL is more

human but no less terrifying, a cry of despair. The last

message from a drowning man...

Weir plays the HELLISH INCANTATION for a third time.

EXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

The Lewis and Clark closes in on the blue planet.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

The flight crew assembled. Data flashes across the main

monitors on the bridge.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - NEPTUNE ORBIT - MODEL

RCS thrusters pivot and fire as the ship enters Neptune orbit,

dropping lower and lower into the dense blue clouds...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

The ship begins to rock as it encounters atmosphere, a growing

vibration.

GRAPHICS flash across the main window's HUD. Neptune's dark

shadow fills the screen.

Miller grins grimly.

Weir sticks his head into the bridge.

Weir climbs up the ladder to the flight deck.

Suddenly, the ship SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY.

Weir braces himself in the doorway, staring out the forward

window into the roiling azure clouds.

Smith grimaces, his knuckles white at the controls.

Only turbid clouds of methane ice whirl past the Lewis and

Clark's windows.

A red warning light begins to flash in time with a shrill

BEEP.

She looks up, trails off...

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AGAINST NEPTUNE - MODEL STARCK'S POV

...the clouds break, revealing...

THE EVENT HORIZON, right in front of them. A black

labyrinthine blasphemy against Neptune's arctic blue. Cloud

banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye of a hurricane.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARKE - BRIDGE

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - DWARFED BY EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

The Event Horizon looms enormous as the Lewis and Clark hangs

off the port stern, dwarfed by the giant ship.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

The turbulence subsides. The bridge crew stares at the massive

craft. The only sound, the PROXIMITY WARNING. Finally:

Miller reaches over Smith's shoulder, turns off the proximity

warning. Smith snaps back to business.

EXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

The Lewis and Clark maneuvers in close to the Event Horizon,

dwarfed by the dark ship.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Smith keeps a tight hand on the controls. The crew stare out

the viewport at the abandoned craft.

Weir explains the view out the cockpit window.

Smith grimaces. His hands move carefully over the controls.

EXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

The Lewis and Clark moves even closer. Vanishing into the

shadow of the Event Horizon.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

The crew stares at the ship rushing past the viewport. A

huge spherical structure looms eerily ahead.

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

The Lewis and Clark carefully maneuvers in close to the Event

Horizon's airlock.

A mechanical boom-arm extends from the smaller ship to latch

onto the Event Horizon. Its clawed hand grabs the antennae

cluster. The cluster buckles under the stress.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

A scan of the Event Horizon appears across Starck's screen.

Starck frowns at her display.

Weir starts to follow Justin from the bridge.

Weir exhales.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

The docking collar umbilicus extends to the Event Horizon's

airlock.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

Miller, Peters, Justin and Cooper in EVA; Cooper and Justin,

without headgear.

Miller nods to Peters.

The inner airlock door opens: CH-THUNK. Miller, Peters and

Justin enter the airlock. Justin attaches his safety line.

Miller and Peters do not.

Cooper puts Justin's helmet on. It seals tight.

Cooper backs out, allowing the inner airlock door to shut,

ECHOING through the ship.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS

Miller, Peters and Justin float down the brightly lit

umbilicus into the Event Horizon, all in EVA suits. Justin's

safety line trails out behind him.

The OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR of the Event Horizon waits for them.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Weir has taken over Justin's station. He watches the POV

monitors like a kid watching Christmas. Smith and Starck

keep tabs over his shoulder.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS

Peters attaches a thumper -- a device using sound waves to

measure pressure -- to the inner airlock door.

Peters inserts a zero-G drill into the panel beside the door.

The door slowly opens...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

The immense corridor stretches away into darkness in both

directions. Distantly spaced windows manifest as remote pools

of blue light amidst endless black, adding to the vast sense

of scale.

The light from their dual spotlights on the team's helmets

reflects off tiny ice crystals of frozen atmosphere. They

are ants in a tomb built for giants.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

The group separates. Justin kicks off from the wall, shoots

down the corridor at immense speed.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

Miller and Peters move in the opposite direction. They use

magnetic plates on their boots and gloves to cling to the

walls as they slowly make their way down the dark shaft.

Their journey seems endless. The darkness almost seems a

living thing as it surrounds them.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

Miller spots something at a coupling, where two sections of

the corridor join...

Miller indicates a box nestled against the coupling. The

universal symbol for explosives is on the cover.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

Peters and Miller keep moving.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

Miller and Peters unconsciously look around. Sweat beads

their faces.

She starts to wave her searchlight around wildly.

She nods as he reaches for the hatch...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

The hatch opens, allowing Peters and Miller entrance into

the forward decks. These areas were intended for human

habitation, and seem similar in design to the Lewis and Clark,

only larger.

Gravity couches line both walls, eighteen in all. Empty.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Weir peers eagerly at the monitors.

Hope drains from Weir's face.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

Miller and Peters split up, each taking a separate exit from

the chamber.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Weir looks at Justin's POV screen: a grainy image of the

First Containment Seal.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR (BY FIRST SEAL)

Justin stands before a thick pressure door. Justin checks

the door with his thumper, his boots are now on.

Justin touches a panel beside the door. It opens. He enters...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

...a long corridor shaped like a tube. It rotates like a

turbine, causing vertigo. Justin's BREATH echoes in his helmet

as he moves forward...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

Cooper stares at Justin's safety line in the airlock.

THE SAFETY LINE

counts off silently, passing 150 meters...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

The corridor ends at a pressure door.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Miller, moving through a deserted lab. Empty operating tables.

Stainless steel surgical instruments float in zero-G. A glove

floats up behind him, brushes his shoulder. He wheels... the

glove is empty. It spins away.

He finds a computer console.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

Peters opens the door.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

Peters enters. Looks around: a small antechamber for crew

briefings, with chairs and a display table. Red crystals

float in a crimson mist around her.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Weir peers at the monitors, trying to make out the red haze.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

Peters takes a sample container from her belt. Carefully

tries to capture a suspended crystal...

CLOSE UP OF THE BLOOD CRYSTAL

and the Container; Peters' brow furrowed with concentration.

WIDER AS A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES THE ROOM,

REVEALING...

...THE WALL BEHIND PETERS, CASED IN A FROZEN EXPLOSION OF

BLOOD AND TISSUE. Someone died here in a violent and terrible

way.

Peters starts to look up but the flash dies away. She never

saw the horror behind her.

Peters turns her attention back to her tiny crystal. She

traps the it, returns the container to her belt.

She moves from the antechamber into...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Her helmet lights sweep the room. Every surface a control

panel.

Peters examines the other consoles -- most are dark but for

a few dim lights.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Weir stares at Peters' monitor.

On her monitor, Peters' POV shifts as she complies.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Peters reaches towards a small video deck. Touches the eject

button. Nothing happens.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

Justin's light bounces off an even larger pressure door,

built like a bank vault. The Second Seal.

Justin opens the seal. It releases SLOWLY, inching open.

Justin squeezes through.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Peters takes a small probe from her belt, inserts it into

the video deck.

A small laser disc emerges partway from the deck. Peters

pulls on it. It doesn't move.

A shadow crosses the window behind her. Someone -- something --

is in there with her...

Peters pulls harder. Nothing. Another effort. The disc pulls

free. Peters spins in the zero-gravity, spinning into...

...A BODY floating at the helm, the face illuminated by

Peters' helmet lights. His swollen tongue clogs his gaping,

screaming mouth. His cracked and crystallized skin is crossed

by a network of bloated veins. He has no eyes. Just like

Weir's dream.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Peters' monitor shows the CORPSE'S face, its mouth open in

mute agony. Weir GASPS.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Peters pushes free of the body.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

The dead man's face leers from Peters' monitor.

Weir just stares at the ruined face, rapt. Starck notices.

Weir nods, not taking his eyes from the screen.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

Cooper, on station. He keys his radio.

No reply.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Miller looks up from the workstation, concerned.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

Cooper stares out at Justin's safety line slowly counting

off past 175 meters.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

The Second Seal is open. Justin's safety line snakes into

darkness.

FOLLOW the safety line into the dark...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

An alcove, opening into a vast chamber. Once pristine, all

the surfaces have been coated in a dark gray slick. Globules

of fluid hang motionless, sticking to Justin's suit, leeching

away his light and swallowing him in darkness.

A lighted console blocks Justin's view of the chamber beyond.

He drifts over to it, wipes the console clear of coolant,

revealing dim lights: the station has power.

TIGHT ON JUSTIN'S FACE AS THE LIGHTS COME ON

His expressions changes as he looks past the console and

sees... something.

JUSTIN'S POV - THE CORE

A massive sphere, 10 meters in diameter, dominates the center

of the second containment. Intricate machinery surrounds the

sphere but the globe itself is featureless, smooth; a

enigmatic monolith. Black ice encrusts it, giving it the

seeming of a living thing.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

They stare at Justin's monitor.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Justin examines the outer wall of the Core, looking for any

cracks or ruptured seams.

Justin turns to the Core...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Justin's monitor fills with static.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Justin reaches towards the Core with his pressure sensor.

His helmet light flickers. He hesitates...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Miller's helmet light flickers...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Peter's helmet light winks out...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Suddenly, the bio-scan lights up, from green to red as signals

race across the display.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Justin places the pressure sensor against the Core. Touching

it.

The Core turns deepest black. A darkness that light cannot

penetrate. For a second, Justin's white suit is captured

against the hungry void...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT (TANK)

THEN THE VOID SUCKS HIM IN AND JUSTIN IS GONE...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

Cooper stares in shock as Justin's safety line as it reels

out at an incredible rate -- 250 meters, 300 meters...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT A WAVE

surges out of the Core, bending light like a ripple on a

pond, pushing coolant and debris before it...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

The gravity wave surges forward, blowing out emergency lights

as it comes, flotsam and jetsam swirling in its wake...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Data floods Miller's workstation, flashing across the screen

too fast for comprehension...

INT. BLACKNESS OF CORE

FOLLOWED BY A FACE -- JUSTIN...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

A DEEP ROAR fills the ship. Miller rises to investigate...

The door BLOWS APART as THE WAVE HITS, ripples through the

Medical Bay towards Miller...

Debris swirls around him... the wave sweeps him up... SLAMS

him into a bulkhead...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE JUSTIN'S POV SCREEN

the briefest suggestion of a SCREAMING FACE, obscured by

STATIC and ROLL before the screen CUTS to static entirely.

The rest of the crew's POV screens go dead as...

...the wave hits them, threatening to tear the Lewis and

Clark apart. The ship shudders violently. Consoles EXPLODE

with sparks. Weir and the others hold on for dear life.

An equipment rack IGNITES. Smith grabs an extinguisher, fights

the blaze...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

Cooper and DJ, bracing against the bulkhead. Cooper hits the

intercom.

Cooper peers out the airlock window.

JUSTIN'S SAFETY LINE

passes 350 meters and accelerating...

Cooper grabs his helmet. DJ helps him lock the helmet into

place with a HISS.

The inner airlock door opens. As Cooper enters the airlock,

Justin's safety reel stops, the line jerking taut at 500

meters.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Miller tries to get his bearings in the dark.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Peters' light, too, remains dark, but Neptune's blue light

fills the Bridge. The frozen corpse floats before her. No

longer a man.

A young boy, maybe five years old. His legs are withered,

useless things. The skin remains a crystallized surface, but

the eyes look straight at her, alive.

Peters reaches out to touch the body. It falls away from

her. No longer her son, but the body of the astronaut. It

hits the door and shatters.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

A MAN'S VOICE, in agony, CRACKLES over Miller's radio:

Miller trails off as RED LIGHT flickers across his visor. He

turns...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE (BURNING MAN) POV

MILLER

A BURNING MAN stands in Medical/Science, a human body wreathed

in flame. The eyes are like sunspots. As the Burning Man

moves, bones and black flesh poke through the fire. He raises

one hand to point at Miller in accusation...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Miller's BREATH stops in his throat. His mouth works but

nothing comes out. He BLINKS...

...and the VISION is gone. Miller is alone, BREATHING hard.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

Cooper enters at full speed, shooting through in a controlled

fall...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

...into the Second Containment. He catches himself at the

console. Cooper sees Justin's safety line, cut off abruptly

by the darkness of the Core.

The darkness of the Core ripples...

Justin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure

riding a wave of impenetrable blackness.

Cooper catches him, holds him tight as the wave carries them

towards the wall. Cooper sees a control rod -- a long metal

spike -- coming at them. He twists his body so that they

miss -- barely -- before slamming into the wall.

Cooper pulls Justin close. Justin's head lolls to one side.

Unconscious.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Weir, Starck and Smith continue to hold on tightly as the

vibration builds... and builds...

The second wave hits. Sparks fly as consoles EXPLODE. Deep

in the ship metal SCREAMS, followed by the SHRIEK of escaping

atmosphere. An emergency klaxon RINGS out: PRESSURE WARNING.

Starck checks Justin's station:

The Bridge pressure door begins to close...and then stop.

Starck pushes Weir ahead of her, Smith follows hard as they

run the length of the ship for the airlock bay.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

The vibration subsides.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Her voice cracks as she says it. She looks anything but.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Miller moves down the central corridor towards his wounded

ship.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Beat. Miller closes his eyes, desperately trying to think of

a solution.

PAN across the faces of the astronauts. No hope. Except for

Weir:

The others turn to stare at Weir.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Peters at the life support console.

Peters flips a series of circuit-breakers. Reaches for the

final switch.

Everything floating in the bridge CRASHES to the floor.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Justin and Cooper collapse to the deck, coolant splashing

down all around them...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

Miller meets the crew as they evacuate the Lewis and Clark.

Weir leads the way, eager; Smith hangs back.

Miller reaches for the catch on his own helmet.

Miller pulls his helmet off with a HISS. He breathes deep.

Starck does the same, coughs.

EXT. NEPTUNE ORBIT - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON

The Lewis and Clark and the Event Horizon, locked together

in Neptune orbit. Lights shine from the Horizon as power is

restored. No longer cloaked in darkness, it is revealed in

all its hideous glory, a nightmare etched in steel.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Weir moves from station to station, restoring power to each.

Starck sits at the communications workstation. Miller watches

over her shoulder.

Weir just stares at the bloodstained wall.

Miller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in

blood...

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW

PULL BACK from the bridge windows TO REVEAL...

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

...the Event Horizon in all its horrific glory, hanging skew

in the center of the hurricane like a mote in God's eye.

The Lewis and Clark clings to the giant craft, as

insignificant as a tick. An even smaller figure clings to

the hull of the Lewis and Clark...

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

It's Smith, EVA in full protective gear. His magnetic boots

hold him to the Lewis and Clark's hull. He kneels over a

hole in the hull, where the metal has buckled and torn. Vapor

still leaks from the hole into space.

Smith uses a foam applicator to fill the hole. The gel freezes

in place. Smith reaches to his belt, pulls out a ZERO-G

NAILGUN. Presses it to the patch and begins to rivet it into

place.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Justin lies unmoving on a table. His eyes are open, staring

at a smear of blood on the ceiling.

A needle slides into the skin below his eye. He doesn't

respond.

DJ removes the needle. It glistens with blood. He looks up

at Miller and Peters.

DJ shakes his head. Miller eyes the bloodstain above them.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Gravity has scattered debris and freeze-dried blood about

the room. The crew (Justin and Smith excepted) tries to relax

on the chairs of dead men. Their faces are wan and haggard.

Weir relaxes at the table. Unlike the others, he seems almost

at ease. DJ remains forever stoic; Starck, animated and

nervous. Cooper bounces the handball on the floor, a reflex

action.

Miller stares at a video monitor, watching Smith repair the

Lewis and Clark. He turns from the window.

Grim smiles all around.

Weir starts shaking his head.

Cooper throws the ball at him, hard. Weir ducks. It bounces

wildly around the room. Miller catches it.

Cooper sits down.

Beat.

Beat. Here comes another bomb...

The crew stares at him, stunned.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Miller, Starck and Weir stand before the Core. Dark ominous

structures loom around them, glistening with coolant. The

PULSE of the ship is loud here, a deep THRUM that steals

their breath. Weir's voice is a reverent WHISPER:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - 3RD SEAL

They stare at the Core, the surrounding machinery moving in

a slow giant's dance. A trick of the eye, or does the Core

stare back at them?

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

MOVE IN ON THE CORE

until its darkness fills the screen...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Peters sits before the computer workstation, running the

ship's log, forwarding through hours of boring footage. Rubs

her eyes.

The lights flicker.

Peters hears something RUSTLING behind her. She turns...

Justin lies unmoving on the nearest examination table.

Comatose. Peters reaches out and picks up a scalpel.

Peters hears the sound again, FINGERNAILS ON PLASTIC. She

moves past Justin...

...past several empty tables, covered with clear plastic...

...to the last table. She stares in shock.

THERE'S SOMETHING UNDERNEATH THE PLASTIC COVER

She slowly reaches out. Lifts the cover.

Her son DENNY looks at her and GIGGLES. She GASPS. The scalpel

drops to the floor at her feet.

Denny reaches up to her, to be picked up...

...but the plastic that still covers his withered legs squirms

like a bag full of snakes...

Peters drops the plastic and backs away.

She turns. DJ stands in the doorway, holding blood samples.

Peters turns back, but her son is gone.

DJ reads her expression.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 2

The Airlock light turns red -- a warning. The Inner Airlock

door control flashes: "LOCKED." The Outer Airlock door opens.

Smith enters. He closes the Outer Airlock door. Atmosphere

HISSES into the chamber. The Inner Airlock door flashes:

"PRESSURIZED."

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 2

Cooper in EVA, getting ready to go outside. The Inner Airlock

door opens. Smith enters. Takes off his helmet.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Starck programs the sensor workstation. She glances over at

Weir: sitting at a computer terminal, his face rapt as data

flashes by. His lips move, muttering to himself.

Weir keeps his attention focused on the screen.

He fingers fly across the keyboard, double-checking the data.

Miller leans over Weir's shoulder.

The INTERCOM interrupts them:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Peters sits at the workstation. Miller, DJ and Weir stand

behind her, watching.

A VIDEO SCREEN

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY (FOR VIDEO)

A jumpy, handheld camera view of:

Gravity couch bay. Two crewmen checking electronics modules.

The ship is well-lit, clean, no sign of debris. The narrator's

voice is excited and nervous.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT (FOR VIDEO)

Second Containment. A lone engineer finishes his check of

the Core. He turns to the camera and gives a self-conscious

"thumbs-up."

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR (FOR VIDEO)

Corridor. The entire original crew assembled, playing catch

with the stuffed dog

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE (FOR VIDEO)

Bridge. KILPACK addresses the camera. His face is flushed

with excitement.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

A BURST of static...

...followed by an inhuman HOWL of FEEDBACK, like screaming

hyaenas, almost alive. Through the swirl of static, the

suggestion of movement.

Miller freezes the frame. He squints at the screen...

POV MILLER

Obscured by static, the image is blurred beyond comprehension.

Suddenly, the lights fade out. Dim emergency lighting snaps

on...

Weir heads for the door.

But Weir has vanished into the corridor.

Miller follows after Weir.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

The Second Containment Seal opens. Weir is about to enter

when Miller stops him. He checks a Geiger counter. It is

silent.

Weir crosses to a console. Frowns.

Miller assists Weir in removing bolts from an access panel.

The panel falls away, revealing a cramped duct leading into

the ship's circuitry.

Weir climbs into the duct. Miller hands him a flashlight and

a toolkit.

Weir begins to crawl into the depths of the ship.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

Weir's breath ECHOES in the cramped shaft. He counts off

circuit panels as he goes:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Miller slogs through the coolant to the Core. Stares at it.

It remains metallic, mundane.

He pulls out a Geiger counter and crosses to the reactor

shell. Examines a gleaming weld. The Geiger counter CLICKS

slowly: no leak.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

A yellow light starts flashing on the engineering board.

Starck's eyes widen: the engineering sections flash

yellow...and green...

STARCK'S POV

as the bio-scan goes wild.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Justin shakes on the bed in an epileptic fit. DJ rushes to

him.

Justin's eyes remain unfocused, unseeing as he tries to speak.

DJ leans in close, trying to hear him speak...

Justin arches in agony and the words come in a strangled,

tortured voice:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

Weir stops before module E-12. Hears a faint HISSING and

POPPING.

He uses a screwdriver to open up the module. Reveals a series

of circuit boards. One SPARKS. Weir plucks the damaged chips

and starts running a by-pass.

His flashlight flickers. He bangs it against the duct wall.

It grows dimmer. Goes out.

A single DRIP of water in the darkness...

Another DRIP, then a woman's VOICE like a distant echo:

Weir starts at the sound. He recognizes the voice.

She speaks again, no longer far away, but a close WHISPER in

his ear:

Weir's eyes open wide in hope and fear.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Even the emergency lights go out. Total darkness.

Miller's voice trails off as he looks towards the Core. A

red glow reflects across his eyes. He takes a few steps away

from the reactor. He stares...

...at the BURNING MAN, standing before the Core. The deep

ROAR of its conflagration fills the containment.

It slowly turns and raises its arm and points at Miller in

accusation.

Miller stares as the Burning Man turns and vanishes into a

bulkhead, leaving the wall blackened and burned with his

passing.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

Total darkness. Weir's breath ECHOES in the cramped metal

space.

Weir bangs his flashlight. Again. Again...

The flashlight flickers...

Claire's face is inches from Weir's.

His flashlight flickers again, snaps on...

She is gone. Weir lets his head fall to the floor of the

deck, breathing in ragged SOBS.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

The crew, except for Cooper. DJ whets a scalpel against the

leg of his jumpsuit, an unconscious gesture. FLICK. FLICK.

FLICK.

All heads turn to her.

She falls silent, unwilling to say more.

Smith, leaning against the doorway:

Weir's face is stone.

DJ lays one hand on Smith's shoulder to calm him...

Smith reacts violently, turning on DJ, shoving him back. DJ

uses Smith's momentum to spin the pilot into the wall. He

presses his scalpel just below Smith's ear...

DJ freezes. The scalpel falls from his hands. He releases

Smith.

Smith goes for Weir.

Miller heads him off, grabs him.

Smith calms.

Smith leaves.

Miller exits. Starck follows.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

STARCK TRAILS MILLER:

Miller stops.

Miller starts walking again.

She rushes to follow.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 2

Miller and Starck enter the Airlock Bay:

She grabs him by the arm.

Beat. Miller allows himself to relax.

Miller pulls an EVA suit from the wall, starts putting it

on.

She nods. He locks his helmet into place.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Peters has fallen asleep in her chair.

On the threshold of hearing, a distant POUNDING. Not a

heartbeat. Metal on metal. Something trying to get out.

Something trying to get in.

Peters wakes with a start.

She turns. Justin lies on the floor in a heap, completely

covered by his sheet. She crosses to him. Pulls back the

sheet...

Revealing empty nitrogen tanks.

She looks up, eyes widening, as...

The IV bottles fill with blood. Blood fills the X-ray

lightboxes, it surges up from gutters in the floor...

And the pounding grows louder... LOUDER... almost to

Medical...

The spell breaks and she RUNS...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

Peters sprints, the SOUND BOOMING after her, almost on her

heels...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

Peters darts into the Bridge Antechamber. She SLAMS the

pressure door shut behind her, CUTTING OFF the sound.

She turns. Weir, DJ, Starck look up from their work, staring

at her.

Beat. Peters starts to LAUGH, part hysteria, part relief.

DJ crosses to Peters, concerned.

As he reaches out to touch her...

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. POUNDING ON THE DOOR ITSELF

Peters SCREAMS. DJ clutches her to him, backs away from the

door.

The POUNDING grows louder. LOUDER. The door vibrates with

each blow Starck puts her hands over her ears. Peters SCREAMS

at the door.

But the POUNDING intensifies, metal GROANING under incredible

pressure.

Weir slowly walks to the door.

He reaches for the door.

Starck grabs him. He tries to shake her off, but she traps

his arm in a wrist-lock. He turns on her, his face furious...

...and the POUNDING stops. They remain frozen for a moment.

Afraid to breathe.

Weir shakes the trance.

In the distance, the POUNDING begins again. Moving away from

them.

The ship systems station BEEPS. A warning light flashes on

the console.

Peters, Starck and DJ rush from the Bridge, leaving Weir

behind.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR NO. 2 - WITH

AIRLOCKS

Peters leads Starck and DJ down the corridor towards the

Forward Airlock bay. They round a corner in time to see a

figure moving in the Airlock.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

They race into the bay even as Justin steps into the Airlock.

He is naked.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

Justin turns and stares through them with cold eyes. He

reaches out to the airlock control.

The pressure door shuts with a HISS.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

Miller, Smith and Cooper cling to the Lewis and Clark's hull.

They carefully remove an access panel, revealing scorched

wiring.

Starck's VOICE breaks in:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

Starck at the intercom. The others huddle by the door.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

Miller swings his body around, heads across the umbilicus to

the Event Horizon. He moves in great leaps, using the magnetic

plates in his gloves and boots to keep from drifting off

into Neptune's thin atmosphere.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

Starck works the airlock control panel without success.

She opens the Airlock access panel.

DJ nods, runs off. Peters bangs on the Airlock door.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

Peters' voice barely penetrates the pressure door:

Justin turns off the artificial gravity. He begins to float

gently.

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING)

Miller moves like a frantic spider across the surface of the

Event Horizon.

Miller curses under his breath, moves even faster...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

Peters, against the window:

He fixes his gaze upon the outer airlock door. And beyond

it, space. He speaks in a flat monotone:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

They are stunned to hear his voice. Peters answers:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Weir sits alone, listening to the VOICES on the intercom.

A LOW MOAN escapes Weir's lips. He cradles his head in his

hands.

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING)

Miller races across the surface of the Event Horizon, the

only sounds, his LABOURED BREATHING, and Justin's tortured

VOICE, patched through on his radio:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

Peters presses her face against the Airlock window, trying

to calm him:

DJ runs up with his medkit.

Starck's hands fly as she re-wires the circuits. Sweat beads

her face.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

Justin looks at her with dead eyes. He reaches out to gently

touch the glass between them.

Justin's hand moves to the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR control.

Hesitates... then floats to the OUTER AIRLOCK control. Hits

it.

A yellow warning light flashes. A warning klaxon WHOOPS,

deafening.

Justin jerks his hands to his ears, closes his eyes...

Justin opens his eyes as if waking from a dream...

And then he realizes where he is...and what is about to

happen.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING)

Miller moves through the Event Horizon superstructure,

recklessly leaping from one beam to another, trying to build

up speed.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

Miller moves faster and faster, his BREATH echoing in his

helmet. He can see the exterior airlock just beyond a deep

chasm in the ship's superstructure. If he misses this jump,

Justin will not be the only man to die today.

He doesn't hesitate but leaps, soaring across the chasm

towards the airlock.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

Miller's words give Justin hope. He regains some control.

Justin breathes hard and follows Miller's hurried

instructions:

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

Miller lands on the superstructure opposite the exterior

airlock.

INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

Justin goes into a fetal crouch and covers his eyes.

He wheezes out all his air...

EXT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

Miller squats on the girder, ready to push off. He focuses

on the 5 meters of space between him and the airlock...

The outer doors OPEN...

The rush of escaping atmosphere carries Justin's body out...

Miller pushes off... catches Justin's body... sending them

both back towards the open Airlock...

Ice forms on Justin's body. His veins bulge. Blood fountains

from his noise and mouth, forming a red icicle over his face.

Miller pulls him into the Airlock. Five seconds have passed

since the airlock door opened.

INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

Miller closes the Airlock behind them. Air HISSES into the

chamber. Justin's body hits the deck as "normal" gravity

exerts itself.

Miller opens the Inner Door. Peters and DJ rush in.

DJ puts a tube in the Justin's mouth immediately, feeding

him oxygen.

Blood bubbles from Justin's mouth and eyes. He GASPS, then

SCREAMS, spraying blood from his mouth.

Starck helps DJ and Peters carry Justin from the Airlock.

Miller sits there, exhausted. Reaches up and pulls his helmet

off.

INT. EVENT HORIZON -- BRIDGE

Weir listens to

INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY

One of the tanks has been activated. Swaddled in bandages,

Justin floats within, suspended in green gel. The others --

DJ, Starck, Peters, Miller, Weir -- look exhausted.

Peters stands, looking at Justin's ravaged form floating in

the tank.

Peters exits.

Weir glances at Justin...

INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY -- POV OF CLAIRE

But it's not Justin in the tank. It's his wife CLAIRE, naked,

wet, dead. Weir stares at her.

INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY

Weir blinks. Justin floats in the grav couch. Weir turns

back to the others.

Weir exits.

INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GENERIC CORRIDOR

Miller follows Weir out of the Gravity Couch Bay.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

Miller moves through the maze of the ship, heading for the

Bridge.

As he reaches a junction, he hears...

...A DISTANT CRY...

Miller wheels like a cat, staring wildly down the branching

corridors.

Nothing. He is alone. Miller leans against the wall, sinks

to the floor, rests his head in his hands.

EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL

The grotesque ship continues it's orbit as the moon Triton

eclipses the sun. Darkness swallows all.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

DJ enters, checks Justin's display.

DJ turns, surprised. Miller sits, barely visible in the dark.

A grim LAUGH from Miller.

Miller nods, pulls his service medal from beneath his

jumpsuit.

Miller trails off. DJ waits patiently. Finally:

Miller sees something in DJ's expression.

DJ plays the recording again. Stops it abruptly.

Miller stares at him.

He plays the recording again.

DJ looks at Miller. He does not have an answer. The intercom

CRACKLES:

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Miller stands in his EVA suit in the darkened bridge. He

twists a manual valve.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

Cooper looks at Smith.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

A moment later, mist flows from the vents into the bridge,

filling it with atmosphere. Miller watches the pressure rise

on his suit gauge.

Miller removes his helmet. Breathes deep.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Peters sits in front of the screen. The log is still

distorted.

Frustrated, she types in a series of instructions. Get to

her feet.

Behind Peters, the process refines, accelerates... pieces

coming together like a jigsaw...

Peters turns around. Sees the screen. The coffee slips from

her hand to the floor.

Starck turns, sees the screen.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Miller, Starck, DJ watch the video. Peters turns away,

miserable. Unable to watch...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE THE VIDEO SCREEN

still distorted by static and roll, but finally lucid: FOUR

ORIGINAL CREW of the Event Horizon. On the Bridge.

ONE MAN dislocates his shoulder with a WET POPPING sound as

he shoves his arm down his own throat. Blood bubbles from

his nose. With a SHUCKING sound, he pulls his stomach out

his mouth...

Behind him, a MAN and WOMAN fuck, covered with blood. She

bites through his neck. His head lolls to the other side.

She buries her face in the torn flesh as he thrusts into her

again and again...

Presiding over them, KILPACK. His eyes are bloody holes. His

hands reach out in offering. In the palms of his hands, his

eyes.

Kilpack opens his mouth and speaks with an INHUMAN VOICE.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Miller switches off the video. No one says anything.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK

Peters enters, carrying heavy CO2 scrubbers. Smith stops

her.

Smith smiles.

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

Weir follows Miller down the Corridor.

Miller turns to walk away. Weir grabs Miller, wheeling him

around, almost frenzied.

Miller shoves Weir back into the wall. The two stare at each

other. Adversaries...

The lights cut to emergency lighting.

Miller finds the intercom:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Starck peers at the Engineering board:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

Miller and Weir are barely visible in the darkness.

He releases the intercom.

Weir's voice is a WHISPER as he backs into the shadows.

Weir is swallowed by the darkness.

REGULAR LIGHTING snaps on...

Miller looks around. Dr. Weir has vanished.

He slams the intercom:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Starck gathers all the files and disks. Shuts down the

consoles, one by one.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Smith and Peters finish removing CO2 scrubbers from panels

in the walls.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

Peters follows Smith down the First Containment towards the

Main Access Corridor, carrying the last case of scrubbers.

She begins to lag behind.

A GIGGLE echoes down the First Containment.

She turns back to the Second Containment...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT POV PETERS

A SMALL FIGURE dashes through the darkness in the Second

Containment. Denny...?

INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

Peters turns, but Smith is already out of sight. She

hesitates. Moves back towards Second Containment.

Again, Peters hears the GIGGLE of a child. The SCRAPE of

metal on metal. She slowly moves forward...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

...into the darkness of the Second Containment. Peters sees

an open access panel. She looks inside.

PETERS' POV - ACCESS DUCT

A narrow tube, vanishing into darkness. A YOUNG CHILD'S VOICE

echoes from far away:

ducks her head and enters the access duct.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

Miller sits at Justin's engineering position. Flips a series

INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT

Peters moves through the duct. Reaches a junction. Anything

could be with her, there in the dark.

A child's WHISPER, too faint for words. Peters turns...

Behind her, FOREGROUND, a YOUNG CHILD dashes across the

corridor.

Peters turns back. Too late to see. Again, the child's WHISPER

draws her onward.

FAINT LAUGHTER is her only answer. She follows the sound,

now climbing into a vertical shaft that takes her higher and

higher...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT - CATWALK

Peters pulls herself up from the vertical shaft onto a catwalk

that snakes between huge oily machinery, just in time to

see...

A SMALL CHILD running, disappearing into the gloom ahead.

She runs forward into a junction. The lights flicker red.

Her son can barely be seen in the flickering darkness ahead.

He reaches his arms out to her...

Peters steps forward, reaching for her son...

...falling into an open access hatch, hidden in the dark...

INT. DENNY'S DUCT - (VERTICAL TUBE)

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Peters hits hard, lies before the Core, an offering of flesh

Denny peers down from the top of the shaft and GIGGLES. CLAPS

his hands in childlike glee.

Weir wanders into First Containment, brooding.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Weir enters the Second Containment. Freezes as he sees...

Peters body lying twisted and broken before the Core.

He rushes to Peters. Reaches out to touch her but pulls his

hand back. Her eyes are black, eight-ball hemorrhage darkening

the irises. She is dead.

Weir looks up from Peters' corpse.

CLAIRE stands before the Core. She is naked. Her skin is

pale and beautiful and cold and wet. Her hair hangs in her

face, covering her milk-white eyes...

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

Claire stands naked before the bathroom mirror. Behind her,

the tub steams...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - (SEX AND SUICIDE

INTERCUT)

Weir stares at Claire in shock. She walks to him. Slowly.

She stops in front of him. Her arms hang at her sides. He

must reach for her.

He does, putting his hands on her hips. He slides from his

chair to the floor to his knees. He presses his face to her

pale belly and cries. SOBS wrack his body...

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

...and in the bathroom, she clutches Weir's straight-razor...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

She reaches down. Slowly, her arms cradle his head. She slides

down on him. Straddles him.

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

...Claire slips into the steaming water...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

He raises his head to her breasts. His eyes, closed. She

remains unnaturally still, only her hips rocking back and

forth.

Weir's mouth opens, GASPS as he enters her...

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

...and the razor bites her skin...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

She caresses his face. Lifts his face to hers. Her mouth is

slack. Her hair hangs in front of her eyes.

billowing around her head like a halo...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

Weir gazes up at her, transfixed. He takes her hand and raises

it to his face. She caresses his cheek. And reaches for his

eyes...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

A MUFFLED SCREAM rips through the Second Containment Seal.

It begins as a human sound and ends as something else, an

alien CRY of rage.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

The CRY echoes down the Main Corridor.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

DJ packs up blood samples. He raises his head at the sound

of the CRY.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Starck GASPS as the CRY resounds through the bridge.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

Miller turns in the direction of the CRY. He begins to move

down the Corridor, towards the source.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

Cooper examines the weld on the baffle plate. It's solid.

No response.

Smith keys the radio.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

Miller jogs down the Main Corridor. An INTERCOM gets his

attention:

Something SPARKS and SIZZLES in the dim light, catching

Miller's eye. He looks up...

One of the EXPLOSIVE CHARGES has been removed from the its

mounting in the Corridor.

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK

Smith's eyes open wide.

But Smith has already left the airlock...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

...entering the Quarters, tearing through storage lockers.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

Miller races down the corridor towards the airlock, towards

his ship...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

A BEEPING sound catches Smith's attention. He follows the

sound to a storage compartment. Rifles through it.

The BEEPS are coming closer and closer together.

Smith grabs a duffel.

Opens it. He sees the EXPLOSIVE CHARGE from the Event Horizon

even as the BEEPS become a steady TONE. He closes his eyes

and SIGHS...

INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLOSION

WHITE LIGHT. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED

Miller enters the docking bay even as a HUGE BLAST knocks

him back.

Safety doors close, sealing off the airlock and preventing

loss of pressure.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

The SILENT EXPLOSION tears the Lewis and Clark into two

pieces, spiralling away from each other and from the Event

Horizon. Metal shards, like confetti, fill the space between

them.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION

Cooper clings to the forward section, watching the Event

Horizon recede as he tumbles into space. His FRENZIED

BREATHING is the only sound.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED

Miller gets to his feet. Stares out the window upon the

wreckage of his ship, spiralling away. He hits the intercom

with his forearm.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

The door opens behind DJ. The lights go out. DJ turns...

Face to face with Weir...

Blood crusts Weir's cheekbones, his mouth. He has no eyes.

Only clotted, empty sockets.

DJ opens his mouth to SCREAM. Weir grabs DJ by the throat,

cutting him off.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED

DJ does not answer. The CRASH of glass and steel resonates

over the intercom.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

Too dark to see... glimpses of violent motion in the stainless

steel cabinets... the sounds of STRUGGLE continue...

...then something WET... and the struggle stops.

Finally, Weir emerges from the gloom. He searches among the

surgical instruments until his blood caked hands find a

needle... and thread...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED

Peters body lies before the Core. The intercom CRACKLES.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 1 - (TATTERED UMBILICUS)

But it is Weir who answers. His voice sounds thick, choked

with dirt.

Miller yanks open a storage locker full of zero-G tool. Lifts

a nailgun. Chambers a round.

EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION

Cooper watches the Event Horizon fall farther and farther

away.

He checks his oxygen gauge. One tank full, one tank at half.

Cooper twists his backpack around, giving him access to the

oxygen tanks. He seals off his primary hose and disconnects

the full tank. His gauge immediately goes to "Yellow -

Reserve."

Cooper points the full tank away from the Event Horizon and

OPENS IT...

The blast of pressurized air pushes him towards the ship,

leaving the wreckage of the Lewis and Clark behind.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

Miller races through the corridors to Medical...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

...and finds DJ, suspended above the table, neatly dissected.

His organs have been laid out carefully before him on the

steel table.

DJ raises his head.

Miller raises the nailgun with trembling hands. FIRES.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

Miller approaches the door to the Bridge. It is open...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Miller stands in the doorway. A figure sits at the helm.

Miller aims the nailgun.

The figure doesn't move. Miller slowly circles around the

helm...

It's Starck. Bound with wire in a sadomasochistic pose,

unconscious.

Miller kneels in front of her, puts down the nailgun, loosens

the cords. She BREATHES in ragged gasps, opens his eyes...

Then stops. She stares over Miller's shoulder like a deer

caught in the headlights.

Miller looks behind him...

WEIR STANDS THERE, STARING WITH EYES SEWN SHUT.

Miller reaches for the gun...

Weir hits him, sending Miller across the bridge into a

bulkhead. Weir picks up the nailgun, examines it.

Miller slowly gets to his feet.

With his free hand, Weir reaches for the navigation console.

Flips a series of switches with gore caked fingers.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE (ENLARGED CONSOLE)

The display lights up.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Weir grins as he flips the final switch.

Miller lunges for the nailgun. Weir raises the nailgun to

point at Miller's face. Miller slowly backs away.

Miller sees something out of the corner of his eye...

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Cooper. Outside, braced in the viewport bracket.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Weir spins and FIRES at Cooper. The nail lodges in the thick

quartz glass. A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet,

the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.

Weir takes a step towards the window, raises the gun to fire

again.

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

Miller dives for the door. Before Weir can fire,

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW (HANGING SECTION)

the window EXPLODES outward.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

The ship HOWLS as air rushes out, ripping Weir off his feet.

Weir catches himself in the broken window, trying to pull

himself back in...

A monitor tears free, SMASHES into him. HE IS SUCKED OUT.

Miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut.

He is safe...

Miller turns. Starck clings to a console, barely able to

resist the winds that try to suck her into the void.

Miller hesitates, looking from Starck back into the safety

of the ship. The door continues to shut. In seconds, he will

be safe. And she will be dead.

Miller YELLS and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it

in the door to keep it open. He keeps one hand on the door,

reaches the other hand to Starck.

She does. Frost forms on their bodies as the air cools. Their

veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses. He YELLS

with exertion...

...drags her to the door... through the door...

...as the compressor tears free, sucked into space...

...and the door SNAPS shut, missing them by a fraction.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

Starck and Miller collapse against the door. A moment passes

between them. Just happy to be breathing...

...and then the AIRLOCK KLAXON goes off.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

Starck and Miller race towards the Forward Airlock Bay.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - FORWARD AIRLOCK BAY NO. 4

They enter, see a humanoid shape moving in the strobing light

of the airlock.

Miller looks around for a weapon. Pulls a zero-G bolt cutter

from the wall. Wields it like a bat.

The inner airlock door releases with a HISS. Swings open...

Cooper tumbles through, clawing at his helmet.

Starck rushes to him, takes his helmet off.

He SUCKS air in, COUGHS it out.

Starck follows Miller's gaze to a workstations's flashing

display: GRAVITY DRIVE ENGAGED. ACTIVATION 00:06:43:01...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

Cooper nods, heads for the gravity couch bay. Starck follows

Miller to the steel pressure door.

Miller opens the door.

Beat. Starck stares at Miller as if memorizing his face.

Miller smiles wanly. The door slides shut with a dull THUNK.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

Miller runs down the corridor. Stops at a bulkhead coupling.

Kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge,

switch it to MANUAL detonation.

Miller runs to the next coupling. Repeats the process...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

Starck and Cooper check the gravity couches. One by one,

they slide open...

Cooper exits down a ladder. Starck turns to the console,

activates three gravity couches. Behind her, two begin to

fill with blue gel...

...and one begins to fill with blood... the hint of dark

shapes moving within...

Starck doesn't see it, concentrates on the console.

THUMP. THUMP. Starck turns. Sees the bloody tank. Sees

something moving inside it.

She slowly crosses to the tank. Peers at it...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY (TANK)

THUMP. A FACE PRESSES AGAINST THE GLASS, STARING BACK AT

HER. WEIR. Bone and muscle are exposed where the skin hasn't

finished forming.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

Starck SCREAMS and backs away.

The glass BURSTS in an EXPLOSION OF BLOOD...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR BELOW GRAVITY COUCH BAY

A corridor beneath the Gravity Couch Bay. Cooper searches

through circuit panels until he finds the EMERGENCY BEACON

breaker. He runs a by-pass, activating it manually. The lights

begins to STROBE...

DRIP. DRIP. A bloodstain spreads over his shoulder. He follows

the drip to the ceiling...

No response. He slowly moves to peer up the ladder...

...as Starck CRASHES down, bloody but alive.

She shoves him away...

Weir appears at the top of the ladder, crawling down headfirst

like a spider...

Starck gets to her feet, staggers away...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST

CONTAINTMENT

Miller kneels, removing the cover from the last explosive.

Flips a switch.

A small cover pops open. Miller reaches in, removes a RADIO

DETONATOR.

He arms the explosives. Watches the red lights on the

explosives wink on in the darkness.

He reaches for an intercom.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR - (INTERSECTION)

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST

CONTAINMENT

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

A figure seems to coalesce from the shadows behind Miller.

The figure moves forward into the light... Arcane runes etch

Weir's face; his eyes, now restored, blaze with unholy zeal.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST

CONTAINMENT

Miller glances over his shoulder. His jaw drops in surprise

as he sees...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

Weir grinning at him... then SMASHES the intercom with his

fist, cutting off Starck's VOICE.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST

CONTAINMENT

Miller backs away.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

Weir stands between Miller and safety.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST

CONTAINMENT

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

FLAMES SPREAD OVER WEIR'S BODY, TRANSFORMING HIM INTO THE

BURNING MAN.

The Burning Man YELLS and raises his arm in accusation...

...and FIRE RACES OUT FROM BEHIND HIM, flowing over the walls,

the ceiling, the floor, racing for Miller like a rising

tide...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST

CONTAINMENT

Miller runs. Dead ahead, the First Containment...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

Miller runs fast. The fire is faster, flooding in behind

him.

Miller dashes for the Second Seal as IT BEGINS TO CLOSE. The

fire gains on him, surrounding him.

Miller dives through the Second Seal...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

...barely makes it...

...SLAMS into the engineering console. Miller looks back at

the Second Seal. It's still open by a fraction when the fire

hits it...

...SENDING A LANCE OF FLAME stabbing out towards Miller. He

rolls aside as the fire hits the console. The console

EXPLODES.

The Second Seal shuts tight, cutting the fire off. The paint

on the Second Seal begins to bubble and scorch... and then

cools as the fire subsides.

Miller gets to his feet. Almost allows himself to relax.

Then he sees his shadow before him, dancing in the growing

red light. He turns...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

The Second Containment is a holocaust. Fire swarms over the

walls. Burning jelly drips from Control Spikes. The Core

itself is a blazing orb; the gyroscope that holds it glows

red-hot.

Miller stares at the blazing Core.

Miller turns. The Burning Man stands RIGHT BESIDE HIM.

He SMASHES Miller with a backhand that ignites Miller's

clothes and sends him flying. The detonator falls from

Miller's grasp, lost beneath two feet of coolant. Miller

comes up CHOKING and SPLUTTERING.

The Burning Man stalks towards Miller. The coolant STEAMS

and SIZZLES at his feet.

Miller stares at the Burning Man as he approaches. Slowly

rises to his feet.

The Burning Man's flames wane, revealing Weir's misshapen

form.

Miller throws a wicked right. Weir catches Miller's fist.

SQUEEZES until blood wells up between his fingers. Then slings

Miller against a cooling tank with BONE CRACKING force. Miller

collapses into the slime, barely able to raise his head to

breathe.

Weir slowly approaches.

Weir's hands reach down and he grabs Miller by the skull.

Miller GASPS as he sees...

SERIES OF SHOTS

Faster than the eye can see. More than mind can accept...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE (VISIONS FROM HELL)

The ORIGINAL CREW writhe naked and bloody in carnivorous

frenzy...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT (VISIONS FROM HELL)

Peters' bloody grinning child, devouring his mother...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

MILLER writhes in Weir's grip. His hands flail out to the

sides. One hand brushes a long steel cannister sunk in the

muck. A CO2 scrubber...

THE VISIONS CONTINUE:

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE (VISIONS FROM HELL)

DJ's dissected body, except that here, DJ looks up, and

smiles...

EXT. SPACE - MODEL (VISIONS FROM HELL)

AN ALIEN SUN, red and bloated and dying.

EXT. ALIEN TERRAIN - MODEL (VISIONS FROM HELL)

AN ALIEN TERRAIN; a sluggish, oily, black sea. A hand reaches

from the oil...

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT (VISIONS FROM HELL)

CLAIRE floating dead in a bathtub filled with the thick black

fluid...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT (VISIONS FROM HELL)

Justin, Starck and Cooper, crucified upside-down upon the

Third Seal...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

His hand closes on the scrubber and he swings it across Weir's

head. Weir reels back, stunned.

Miller gets to his feet.

He hits Weir again. HARD. Blood gushes from Weir's skull,

filling the runes on his face.

Weir staggers. Miller attacks. Again and again and again...

This time Weir is ready. He catches the scrubber and tears

it from Miller's grasp. SMASHES Miller to the floor with a

single blow. Miller GROANS.

Miller gets to all fours, trying to get up.

Weir kicks Miller savagely. Miller slides through the coolant,

comes to rest beneath a walkway. He attempts to rise,

collapses back into the sludge.

Weir slowly stalks towards him.

Weir's grotesque face is inches from his. He reaches down

and pulls Miller from the dripping ooze...

...as Miller clears the surface, he holds something in his

fist.

Miller stares dead-on into Weir's hellish face...

...and raises his right hand. HE'S HOLDING THE DETONATOR.

MILLER DEPRESSES THE DETONATOR.

EXT. EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

A small, silent EXPLOSION blossoms in the aft section of the

ship...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

...followed frames later by a sequence of DETONATIONS that

rip the Main Access Corridor apart and propel the foredecks

away from the containment section.

INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR (ROLLOVER SET)

The EXPLOSION knocks Starck and Cooper down. They hold on

tightly as...

EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL

Waves of distortion ripple over the Event Horizon's

containment section...

A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as

the gateway opens... A BLACK HOLE...

The black hole begins to shrink, imploding. As it collapses,

it sucks Neptune's blue clouds with it, creating a TITANIC

WHIRLPOOL with the black hole at its center...

The SHRIEKING winds carry the foredecks back towards the

whirlpool, towards the black hole...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR (ROLLOVER SET)

Cooper and Starck slide across the floor as the deck tips at

a terrific angle...

EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL

The foredecks teeter on the edge of oblivion...

The black hole collapses utterly, vanishing to a point. An

enormous SHOCKWAVE rips out from the point of implosion.

The foredecks ride the wave away from the implosion and out

of Neptune's atmosphere to safety...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR WINDOW

The VIBRATIONS subside. Cooper and Starck stagger to their

feet. Look out the window...

EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL COOPER/STARCK POV

Neptune recedes, the ugly hole of the implosion already being

erased by Neptune's violent winds...

INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR WINDOW

Starck's voice is tiny.

SPACE - MODEL

Black planets silhouetted by a dying red giant. The

Engineering Containment of the Event Horizon drifts in the

eddies of gas that swirl and spiral into the bloated star.

MOVE towards the ship until its shadow consumes all...

DELETE SCENE

INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

Starck awakens but the SCREAMS continue as the Event Horizon

calls out to her... she SCREAMS... hands on her body... the

CRIES stop...

Starck looks around uncomprehending at the faces around her.

IT'S A RESCUE TEAM

Cooper pushes them aside. She clings to him, CRYING...

FADE TO BLACK.
