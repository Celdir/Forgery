Shenandoah mountains. A cold dawn. TWO BLACK TOWN CARS

sit side by side, facing a view of a farming valley below.

Two MEN in dark suits and long coats stand near the

cars, casually on the lookout. If we caught a glimpse

underneath the coat of the taller of the two, we'd see

that he was carrying a 9mm. Glock.

In the backseat of the car sit HAMERSLEY and REYNOLDS,

each well-kept and in his early 50's.

REYNOLDS regards HAMERSLEY a moment, then opens the car

door--

HAMERSLEY's car snakes down the twisting mountain road.

HAMERSLEY MAKES VERBAL NOTES concerning the Reynolds

meeting into his memo-recorder as he drives. He picks

up his cellular phone and punches in a number.

The line goes dead.

HAMERSLEY tries again but can't get a dial tone. Then,

in the rear-view mirror, a BROWN SEDAN gains fast.

Whoever the guy is, he's flying. Then a man with a

rifle leans out the sedan's window. Aims.

HAMERSLEY flies into a blind curve. Tires SCREECH as he

rounds the bend to see

A PROPANE TRUCK. Blocking both lanes of the road.

HAMERSLEY's eyes widen. He stomps the brakes, SKIDS and

SLAMS into the truck. The EXPLOSION engulfs everything.

HAMERSLEY and the car are consumed. The pursuing sedan

slows to a stop. The men watch. The car's an inferno.

The MEN pull a 'U' and drive away.

A well-appointed big-city law office filled with

citations of merit and pictures of a wife and child.

ROBERT DEAN, a likable young lawyer, sits behind his

desk with his back to an OLDER MAN. He stares at a

commanding view of Washington, D.C. as he listens to a

tired, smoke and whiskey voice.

DEAN swivels around in his chair and faces L.T.

DEAN gets up and walks a grateful L.T. to the door,

calling to his secretary as they go--

MARTHA appears in the doorway...

DEAN dines in a booth with RACHEL BANKS, 30's. RACHEL

opens her briefcase, removing an 8x10 envelope.

DEAN is reaching inside his jacket pocket. He removes

an envelope marked "BRILL".

DEAN hands her the envelope.

DEAN weaves his BMW through D.C. bumper-to-bumper

traffic as he eyes the photos that Rachel gave him

which are lying on the passenger seat. The photos show

DePINTO sitting in a motel lounge with TWO MOB TYPES.

He's talking on the phone.

INTERCUT WITH:

News helicopters hover over Hamersley's wreck as police

direct traffic around the media circus.

DAN ZAVITZ, looks older than he is, balding with a

weight problem, sweats behind SLAPPING wipers of a

beater car plastered with environmental issue stickers.

NPR drones on the radio as a police car crawls behind

him, SIREN YELPING, lights flashing, trying to get by.

ZAVITZ POV: Wreckage surrounded by squad cars,

ambulances and media circus. Something's happened.

Something big.

A tall ladder leans against a dead oak. ZAVITZ sweats

and climbs to a branch where a platform's been built

supporting a large phony bird's nest. He lifts away the

nest, revealing--

--Two microphones and three motion-activated digital

video cameras and recorders. ZAVITZ checks the cameras'

viewfinders to see--

--TIME-CODED VIEWS - WIDE, MEDIUM AND CLOSE of a

squirrel's nest containing three newborns. The parents

are nowhere to be seen.

ZAVITZ eyes the recorders. The video disks are spent.

He ejects and pockets them, replacing them with fresh ones.

An old building needing rehab. A SIDEWALK VENDOR does

brisk business, we DRIFT to an apartment window above.

ZAVITZ is staring intently at his computer monitor. We

don't know yet what he's looking at, but he's scared to

death as we continue to listen to the NEWS REPORT...

ZAVITZ leans in a little closer to get a better look at

his computer screen, not wanting to believe what he's

seeing...

And now we see what ZAVITZ is staring at on his

computer monitor. The film he shot at SHENANDOAH PARK...

...the meeting between HAMERSLEY and REYNOLDS.

ZAVITZ reaches over, picks up the phone, and punches in

some numbers with one hand. With the other, he punches

some keystrokes on the computer. The screen zooms in on

REYNOLDS, getting out of HAMERSLEY's car.

INTERCUT WITH:

A cluttered office belonging to a radical, fringe

newspaper. ALFONSO, mid-50's, long, graying hair, works

at a computer.

ALFONSO clicks his TV to CNN. The HAMERSLEY re-cap is

still on.

A place with mind-boggling technology and high-tech

recording devices. DAT recorders spin silently.

CLOSE ON REYNOLDS sitting in the back. Well-dressed and

alone, he reviews a bible. His cellular phone RINGS. We

HEAR static as two encrypted lines find digital

compatibility. Finally, a confirmation TONE--

INTERCUT WITH:

Misty forests sweep down a hill to the Chesapeake Bay.

A road leads to a high-voltage security fence and

guard-shack. Beyond are several windowless concrete

structures bristling with microwave antennas and

satellite dishes. A sign reads:

INT. TECH ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The banks of high-tech digital recorders record

incessantly as a TECHNICIAN holds a phone to his ear.

Packed seats around a long conference table. The entire

law firm reviews the proceedings. DIANE SAUNDERS

answers the questions from her senior partner.

Establishing. Apartments on upper floors, businesses on

lower.

Jacket on, ready to leave, ZAVITZ sits at his computer

finishing a transfer. A TONE beeps as a COMPUTER TIME

GRAPH sweeps to 'finished'. The screen reads: TRANSFER

COMPLETE.

There's a KNOCK at the door...

...ZAVITZ looks over.

ZAVITZ disconnects a video digitizer, removes a game-

cartridge containing the digitized video...

...and inserts it into a Gameboy.

He steps to the door and eyes the peep-hole.

ZAVITZ POV: A fish-eye view of a Fed-Ex man, JONES,

looking bored.

ZAVITZ POV: TWO DWP INSTALLERS hovering in a bucket

across the street. Down below, a cargo van with a

multiple roof antenna is double parked near a Fed-Ex

van. Then--

--Through a street window's reflection, ZAVITZ sees his

building's front entrance. SEVERAL TENANTS are being

prevented from entering by TWO MEN, plain clothes, one

with a radio communicator pressed to his ear.

Shit.

ZAVITZ backs from the window, seized by panic. He grabs

his phone...

...dead.

He picks up his fax line. Also dead.

He grabs the GameBoy, goes to a small side window and

opens it. A ledge snakes around the corner. An athlete

he's not but there's no choice. He squeezes out.

PRATT, wearing a Fed-Ex uniform, is laying in wait.

PRATT sprints down the hall, pulling out his pistol, as

JONES kicks in Zavitz's door and rushes in. The

window's open. JONES looks out as the last of ZAVITZ

goes around the corner of the ledge.

It's the rooftop ZAVITZ is heading to. Two MEN crouch

behind a wall, watching ZAVITZ approach.

ZAVITZ inches along, scared breathless. He looks back.

No one.

Maybe he was wrong.

A pigeon suddenly flies by...ZAVITZ loses his balance,

struggles...and falls.

He crashes through an awning and into a sidewalk fruit

stand.

Dazed, ZAVITZ crawls to his feet as passersby watch

speechless.

Things happen fast. The cargo van rips from the curb

but is suddenly blocked by a delivery truck. HORNS BLAST.

HICKS, 30's and athletic, leaps from the van.

Fears confirmed, ZAVITZ starts down the sidewalk,

shakes off pain, and moves to a run.

Except now there's someone in front of him. He's

trapped. Reaching a doorway, ZAVITZ pushes. The door

opens to--

ZAVITZ charges through and kicks open a fire door. An

alarm blasts as he exits to--

A garbage truck screams up the alley. There's no way to

outrun it. There's a fire escape above a dumpster.

Breath rasping, he struggles on the dumpster, pulling

himself up the ladder just as the truck OBLITERATES all

below.

ZAVITZ struggles and climbs. Reaching a landing, he

pauses for breath...

...and sees HICKS and two others just moments behind.

ZAVITZ grabs a fire escape door, tugs, pulls and bangs

it open to--

ZAVITZ hurtles by, trips, get up, runs again, adrenaline

pumping as PURSUING SOUNDS near. He pitches down a

staircase, shoves TWO PEOPLE and rips through--

He flies past the diners and exits into--

HICKS and ANOTHER fly out of the diner, just in time to

see ZAVITZ melting in with Christmas shoppers that are

entering a department store.

We see that the large sign over the entrance to the

store reads: "HARRISON'S".

An upscale store packed with Christmas shoppers.

At a fashion ramp, a small crowd of mostly WOMEN have

gathered to watch leggy models feature a particular

line of lingerie. Mixed in among this group is DEAN, a

shopping bag in each hand, his briefcase tucked under

one arm, trying his best to affect an air of the

studious shopper.

The WOMAN is sales clerk who's been in this situation

before.

The SALES CLERK goes around the counter to the rear

area. DEAN glances at the fashion show when he glimpses--

ZAVITZ, hurrying through the women's dressing area,

desperately looking for an exit. No luck. ZAVITZ moves

toward DEAN, about to break for the front, but HICKS is

there searching. Trapped, ZAVITZ ducks behind a display.

DEAN watches, unaware of ZAVITZ's pursuers. Then it

clicks...

ZAVITZ turns, frightened....

DEAN looks around...

...ZAVITZ is gone.

Out on the street, ZAVITZ shoves into a group of

shoppers waiting for the light. Then he sees HICKS and

his PARTNER. They see him.

Fuck the light.

ZAVITZ runs into the street as--

--a BUS speeds through yellow. ZAVITZ is caught in its

path.

BAM!

Only stunned witnesses remain.

DEAN exits the department store. He sees the commotion

and makes his way over.

SIRENS can be heard in the distance. DEAN eyes the

ground where the body lays. He sees Zavitz's BLOODY

JACKET...

DEAN's BMW drives through a neighborhood of stately

homes, all magnificently decorated for Christmas.

DEAN drives, a little shaken by events. The RADIO plays

an AT&T COMMERCIAL relaying the joys of home tele-

conferencing. DEAN enters the driveway of his picture-

perfect home.

DEAN enters with his shopping bags and briefcase.

Searching for family members, he enters--

DEAN's 8 year old son, ERIC and Eric's friend DYLAN sit

by the big-screen TV, glued to a video game. A NANNY is

nearby, lost in a magazine.

The kitchen is in the midst of a remodel. A wall-

mounted TV is showing "CROSSFIRE", where the two HOSTS

are mediating a battle between TWO SENATORS.

STACY watches the show with one eye, cooks with the other.

DEAN enters...

He kisses her. A good one.

DEAN heads upstairs...

REYNOLDS lectures a class of young CATECHISM STUDENTS.

REYNOLDS cellular phone rings. He opens his briefcase

and takes it out.

REYNOLDS busts out of the room, phone to his ear. Two

MEN IN SUITS wait like pit bulls, ready for anything.

Over the phone, we HEAR CONNECTING HANDSHAKES as the

lines find digital compatibility.

INTERCUT WITH:

The store is now closed.

HICKS holds a cellular phone as PRATT questions the

SALES CLERK. Nearby, a monitor shows a time-coded

surveillance tape of the lingerie section. DEAN and

ZAVITZ are in playback, engaged in their earlier meeting.

Finally, a confirming tone...

Establishing. Fort Meade. A massive complex surrounded

by razor wire and surveillance cameras.

We PUSH IN on one building several blocks long. Its

roof is bristling with antennas, dishes and domes.

TIGHT ON MANILA folder stamped

A SKINNY MAN clutches the folder, walking by endless

cubicles of high-tech industriousness. He stops where

an ANALYST types on a terminal near a retinal scanner.

The ANALYST opens the folder to see a request for a

PRIORITY WRAP on ROBERT DEAN, followed by a Social

Security Number. The ANALYST enters in the number.

CLOSE on COMPUTER SCREENS showing in the harvesting of

DEAN's electrical identity. His phone bills scroll by.

Names, addresses, employment people called--

Months, years flashing by quickly. Other data banks are

probed. Insurance policies, credit histories, video

rentals, library checkouts, school transcripts, ATM

transactions, tax returns...everything. Irregularities

are red-flagged.

A matching ZAVITZ ITEM is found. DEAN's banking info is

red-flagged. He has large cash withdrawals with no

matching purchases. His withdrawal dates match up with

unaccounted-for cash deposits...

...in RACHEL BANKS' savings account.

CLOSE ON PRINTER. Conclusions spill out labeled "RISK".

More probes are recommended into the RACHEL BANKS/ROBERT

DEAN money connection.

CLOSE ON EYE BEING SCANNED - We HEAR a TONE.

PULL BACK to a PREGNANT WOMAN sitting with her head

pressed to the scanner. A second verification TONE

sounds. A poster above her work station reads:

She enters a phone number in her terminal. The computer

DIALS. She waits, snacking on rice cakes. Finally,

another computer ANSWERS. On screen appears: PAC-TEL

TESTING BOARD. The screen fills with choices. She

highlights -

She enters another command. A new prompt reads: ENTER

LINE REQUEST NUMBER.

Eyeing DEAN's folder, she enters the phone number and

commands "ENTER". "RECORD".

The telephone tap is instant.

A VOICE GRAPH appears in-sync with CONVERSATION now

coming over the speakers.

She enters more commands. An Automated-Voice-Transcriber

kicks in. DEAN's CONVERSATION is now transcribed

automatically.

A massive, dark place growing with monitors and tech.

Names of world regions are posted above endless monitor

screens displaying live, digital-image feeds of Earth

coming in from the Keyhole-12 Spy Satellites. Every

populated area of the planet is covered here. ANALYSTS

attend the many feeds.

A poster reads:

On another poster, a man's running shadow in a target

bulls-eye with a caption reading:

Beneath a sign reading

an ANALYST reviews time-coded, digital SAT videos of

Washington, D.C. As seen from space, the Capitol

appears to be nothing more than a greyish mass. The

ANALYST keys commands into his system.

CLOSE ON MONITOR - The overhead SAT view of Washington

moves in closer, soon streets are discernible, then

cars and buses - then an accident in an intersection

with flashing ambulance lights and a bus. A body lies

twisted in the street - it's ZAVITZ.

The ANALYST enters additional commands. The ZAVITZ/bus

accident freezes, then plays in reverse as if recorded

by the eye of God.  The scene continues reversing,

following close on Zavitz as he back-tracks into

Harrison's Department Store.

CLOSE ON ANOTHER ANALYST facing three monitors showing

additional views of ZAVITZ's escape as captured by a

traffic camera, an ATM camera and the security inside

Harrison's.

TWO TECHIES huddle by a monitor overseen by FIEDLER, a

computer expert. The monitor displays the Harrison's

surveillance tape of the ZAVITZ/DEAN meeting.

The TECHIE hits a command. ZAVITZ and DEAN freeze on

screen.

The TECHIE boxes the area to be enhanced. He types

commands. The boxed area increases ten-fold.

The enlarged view shifts to DEAN's gift bags. The

picture's fuzzy. Someone passes by, blocking the view

at a crucial moment.

More keystrokes. The computer takes over, clarifying

the image with passes of resolution.

HICKS leans in closer as the image of the bag inches

forward.

FIEDLER points to another screen displaying a digitally-

enhanced image of the shadowed object and its

approximate shape.

REYNOLDS steps forward. His eyes are red. It's been a

long night.

REYNOLDS heads for the door.

DEAN drives with STACY as ERIC sleeps in the back seat.

Various hats and souvenirs tell us that they've just

come from a Redskins game.

They drive in silence for a moment before...

The RANGE ROVER pulls into the driveway.

The DEAN's enter the doorway. ERIC and STACY are first.

They stop, faces shocked. DEAN hasn't noticed yet. His

hand automatically goes to the alarm key pad.

CLOSE ON THE PAD - The LED reads: ARMED. DEAN punches

the code -

DEAN turns.

The house is ransacked. The ALARM suddenly BLARES,

adding mayhem.

CLOSE-UP ON THE CEILING VENT - The CAMERA PUSHES IN

TIGHT revealing a concealed, fiber-optic video lens the

size of a pin-head.

Several cars and a florist van are parked on the quiet

street.

The van is really an electronic surveillance post

jammed with the latest equipment. A TECHIE with

headphones eyes a monitor.

CLOSE ON THE MONITOR showing the PIN HOLE SURVEILLANCE

VIEW of STACY walking through a disheveled room in a

state of shock while DEAN pulls out his cellular phone

and dials.

A black ball slams against a wall. PULL BACK to DEAN,

who's angry, frustrated and drenched in sweat. He's

embroiled in a hard, fast game with his friend, JERRY.

A busy lobby for a major complex. DEAN, freshly

showered, steps from a door marked: TO PARKING LEVELS.

DEAN turns to see MORELOS, 40's, an obsessive man with

a terminal smile.

MORELOS shows him his badge.

DEAN starts walking--MORELOS follows him.

DEAN stops short and turns to MORELOS. He stares.

DEAN steps into the elevator.

DEAN walks down the hall toward his office. He stops by

PEERS as he enters his office.

DEAN enters his office and turns his computer on. It

BEEPS, BOOTS and loads.

LEVIN approaches the men's room. A MAINTENANCE MAN

cleans up broken glass and water by the door. A sign

reads: CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE. Levin turns and leaves.

Two more MAINTENANCE MEN kneel in a stall adjusting a

portable monitor and oscillator. They aim a directional

antenna using slow, sweeping motions.

CLOSE ON THE MONITOR displaying the intercepted signal.

It's Dean's computer screen with text being typed in.

The words are hard to read due to horizontal drift.

After adjusting the antenna, the signal smooths.

We PUSH CLOSER. The signal shows the current display of

Dean's computer screen. We see Dean's O.S. command pull

up his E-Mail. A prompt asks for a password.

XXXXXXX appears.

A switch is flipped. XXXXXXX becomes PUCCINI. Dean's

"secure" file opens. Entries appear.

Establishing. A large, busy place. LAWYERS and AIDES

bustle in and out of this structure.

A busy morning as ATTORNEYS wait their turn to present

motions before the JUDGE.

DEAN is seated next to LEVIN, making notes.

ANOTHER ATTORNEY sits several rows back, watching the

proceedings, briefcase in his lap.

CLOSE-UP on the ATTORNEY's EAR with a mini-receiver.

From it drift snippets of the DEAN/LEVIN conversation.

A pulled back leather flap on the ATTORNEY's briefcase

reveals the tip of a concealed microphone.

DEAN waits for the garage attendant to bring down his car.

DEAN turns. TWO MEN, PRATT and BINGHAM approach him.

We HEAR a recording of the conversation between DEAN,

PRATT and BINGHAM while we're CLOSE on an INK NEEDLE

measuring Dean's voice stress levels.

HICKS turns off the recorder. Standing with him is

REYNOLDS, the Dean file and voice stress graph laid out

before him.

Establishing. A massive clubhouse surrounded by

expensive cars and tended grounds. We HEAR strains of

Gershwin's "They Can't Take that Away from Me" from inside.

GUESTS mill about. DEAN and STACY are standing by the

reception table where name tags and seating assignments

are laid out. DEAN picks up a card that reads: MR. AND

MRS. ROBERT DEAN - TABLE 122.

JERRY steps over and puts his hand on DEAN's shoulder--

JERRY gently pulls DEAN to a quiet corner...

CLOSE ON and OLD MATRON carefully chewing her food near

a table card declaring: 122. The gala swings everywhere

but here. DEAN and STACY are the only other diners at

the table.

Establishing. A glass and steel high-rise reaching upward.

DEAN sits behind his desk as his secretary MARTHA enters.

DEAN picks up the phone--

INTERCUT WITH:

RACHEL cradles a portable phone to her ear.

Before DEAN can respond, there's a knock at the door.

PEERS sticks his head in--

DEAN sits in the conference room by himself. He waits.

After a moment, SILVERBERG and BLAKE stride in.

DEAN is speechless...

DEAN enters.

JENNY, early 30's, heads him off--

DEAN pushes past her and heads to the back patio--

STACY stares blankly, eyes red. A copy of The Post is

beside her. A picture of DEAN and RACHEL, arm in arm,

accompanies a headline.

DEAN walks in--

STACY whips the paper at him--

STACY grabs another paper and shoves it across the

table. DEAN picks it up.

DEAN'S POV: A black and white surveillance photo of

DEAN and RACHEL on a hotel balcony.

Establishing. Downtown Washington, D.C.

A busy night. DEAN stands at the registration desk

facing a DESK CLERK.

The CLERK runs it through. Same result.

He returns the card, embarrassed for Dean. DEAN turns

to leave...

...and stops dead. He stares at the empty floor by a

pillar.

DEAN walks quickly around the area, looking at

everything and everyone.

DEAN stands at the ATM, waiting for cash. There's a

short line of PEOPLE behind him. His bank card spits

out. The monitor reads:

The waiting PEOPLE back away...

A weathered sign reads:

An O.S. TV DRONES the latest AT&T COMMERCIAL--

CLOSE ON AN OLD COLOR TV. The COMMERCIAL ENDS. A

NEWSCASTER returns to deliver the late-night news.

The newscast cuts to SAM ALBERT, late 60's, standing on

State Capitol Building steps delivering a speech to

community leaders.

PULLING AWAY from the TV, we explore the room. Dimly

lit and cluttered with tired furniture.

Outside the window, a BUZZING NEON SIGN flickers red

and blue. We finally end on DEAN, sitting on a sagging

bed, rubbing his eyes...the newspaper with the

doctored-up photo is sitting next to him.

Establishing. Italian area of Baltimore. A 40's era

box-building. A sign reads:

Thread-bare chairs and a couch. SAL and FRANKIE, both

meaty guys in shiny shirts, sit facing DEAN, who stands

before them.

Establishing. A sign reads:

MEG BURTON sits near an editing machine as two EDITORS

review endless amounts of bird footage. DEAN sits next

to her.

Establishing. The Baltimore water front. A crusty bar

overlooking the bay.

Sunlight slashes blinds revealing a place that is wrong

during the day. JIMMY, a beefy bartender, takes stock

of the liquor while RACHEL sits in a dark booth.

RACHEL looks up...

She looks at DEAN for a moment...

CLOSE ON a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA on a pole, sweeping,

making automatic lens corrections.

We drift down to the harbor walkway, a greenbelt with

quaint hotels and bars on one side, Chesapeake Bay on

the other. DEAN and RACHEL are strolling the walk.

A TECHNICIAN eyes a recorder spin as a monitor shows a

live feed from the park.

DEAN and RACHEL on their stroll--

DEAN smiles...and after a moment, so does RACHEL.

RACHEL is walking to the mailbox. She casually slashes

the box with chalk and drops a letter inside.

Establishing. Wharves, ships, seagulls. A water-bus

chugs dockside as PASSENGERS board for the trip across

the inlet. DEAN stands in a ticket line with the other

PASSENGERS.

DEAN takes a seat. Across the deck is Seat 74. RACHEL

takes the seat and casually slides an envelope behind

it, her actions obscured by a bag she carries. The

ferry BLOWS its departure horn.

The ferry churns water. RACHEL moves to a wind

protected seat, leaving Seat 74 empty. DEAN keeps watch

on the seat as he scans the paper.

A MONTAGE of different people occupying Seat 74.

A middle-aged DRUNK passed out in the seat. A TEEN-AGED

boy with glasses chats with friends.

An OLD LADY reads a book. She sees DEAN eyeing her and

smiles nervously. DEAN returns to his paper.

DEAN's alone now. The ferry docks for the night. The

last passengers, TWO NUNS, disembark. DEAN rises to go.

Brill's a no-show.

DEAN walks down the ramp. It's dark in the empty

terminal. Not the best place at this hour. Up ahead,

TWO MEN stand in the darkness, then kissing. Down

another hall, SOUNDS OF NEARING FOOTSTEPS. DEAN detours

into--

Empty. DEAN stands at a sink, water running. He glances

at the door. He splashes water on his face. Suddenly--

--DEAN's slammed forward, a silenced pistol is shoved

into his ear, pinning his face to the mirror.

Hands frisk DEAN. Up and down the legs, behind the back

and chest. A wallet is removed, ID's looked at - then

returned. DEAN turns to see--

A MAN, early 50's. He sweeps a signal frequency locator

over DEAN's body. The needle reacts at DEAN's foot.

DEAN complies with the strange request as the MAN flips

out a knife.

CLOSE ON DEAN's HEEL - a hollow compartment reveals a

miniature tracking device. The MAN removes it, then

returns the shoe.

The MAN reaches in a trash can, removes a potato-chip

bag, wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down

the toilet.

"BRILL" goes through the window. DEAN eyes the window,

not sure. He eyes the door. Same feeling.

DEAN crawls through the window to a loading dock.

"BRILL" motions him to follow as he moves off into the

shadows.

The sounds of the window OPENING behind them, followed

by FOOTSTEPS. "BRILL" shoves Dean behind a dumpster and

removes his gun as two men run by. The STEPS FADE.

"BRILL" looks. They're gone.

Establishing. A closed farmer's market by the terminal.

Several cars are parked. One's a cab. "BRILL" opens the

driver's door. DEAN grabs the front passenger door.

"BRILL" sits in the driver's seat, eyes flickering to

all views, as DEAN climbs in the back. "BRILL" flips on

the meter and guns into traffic.

"BRILL" eyes the mirror. A BLACK CHEVY appears several

car lengths behind.

"BRILL" starts to weave in and out of traffic. He looks

in the mirror - the Chevy's also weaving several cars

behind.

"BRILL" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating.

The ride from hell gets worse as "BRILL" screeches

another turn. The car ahead stops and "BRILL" screeches

past on two wheels.

"BRILL" takes an impossible left into another alley.

The Chevy follows. "BRILL"'s good. The guy in the

Chevy's better.

The cab is rear-ended hard by the Chevy. Their necks

snap back from the force.

WHAM! They're hit again. "BRILL" pulls out a communicator.

WHACK! "BRILL" back-hands DEAN with his fist, knocking

him silly as WHAM!--the cab's rear-ended again.

Then "BRILL" sees that the alley empties into a busy

street, then a bakery shop.

He slams the brakes. Tires screech smoke but it's no

use. The powerful Chevy pushes the cab, bumper to

bumper, toward the street. "BRILL" grips the wheel.

It's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross

traffic and--

BLAM! They're broad-sided by a delivery truck. The cab

is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire-

hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the

broken main.

DEAN slowly opens his eyes. Water pours in everywhere.

"BRILL" is sticking halfway through a window, not

moving. Seeing "BRILL"'s pistol, DEAN grabs it and

crawls from the wreckage.

DEAN climbs from the wreck as BYSTANDERS approach.

They back away as DEAN gets to his feet and looks

around. Off to the side he sees the Chevy, waiting like

a coiled snake.

DEAN limps into the crowd. He rounds the corner to

ANOTHER STREET and now he's running with all he's got left.

STACY is at the desk looking at the latest edition of

the paper, which now has a photograph of DEAN and

RACHEL walking in the park from the day before.

The phone rings and STACY reaches for it...

INTERCUT WITH:

DEAN stands at a pay phone--

A hand suddenly clicks down the phone hook. DEAN turns

to see a MAN, late 50's, gruff and alert. It's the guy

driving the Chevy.

DEAN does nothing, temporarily frozen. A pistol jabs

him hard.

DEAN replaces the phone. The man removes DEAN's gun.

Nearby, two PEOPLE chat at a restaurant hostess desk,

unaware.

DEAN does but is suddenly redirected through a roof-

access door.

A TECHNICIAN sits in a van jammed with high-tech

surveillance gear. HICKS is next to him, a phone

pressed to his ear.

INTERCUT WITH:

REYNOLDS, dressed in a tux, presses his cellular to his

ear, while behind him MARSHAL and SHAFFER, also in

tuxedos, have a heated discussion.

Eight stories up and deserted. The lit dome of the

Capitol building shines like a beacon in the D.C. skyline.

DEAN suddenly slams against a wall--

BRILL pulls out a disk-shaped object the size of a

walk-man.

A helicopter hovers near the Washington Monument. BRILL

eyes it cautiously.

BRILL turns to leave--

DEAN continues blocking the door, maintaining calm even

as BRILL's pistol is pressed firmly to his forehead.

BRILL looks at the ground. Torn.

And with that, he's gone.

DEAN eyes the gun. He walks to the ledge, looking at

the city.

DEAN'S POV: Several vehicles quietly pull up to the

building. MEN storm out an move inside.

DEAN quickly backs away.

DEAN races for the stairwell two steps at a time. He

hears the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING somewhere below.

DEAN retreats upward, then he hears SOMEONE COMING DOWN.

Trapped. He opens the door on '3' and is about to run

when he sees a security camera directly above.

Grabbing a fire extinguisher, he pulls the pin. Spray

coats the lens. Then he yanks a FIRE ALARM. A HORN BLARES.

DEAN runs for the second stairwell when he sees JONES

stepping out. DEAN looks back at the stairwell he left.

That door's opening as well.

Trapped.

Using the extinguisher, DEAN smashes the glass door to

an office and goes inside. JONES starts to enter when a

shot rips into the wall, convincing him otherwise. He

retreats as the BLARING FIRE ALARM STOPS.

DEAN races through the suite of offices trying locked

door after locked door. Finally, one opens and he

rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself.

No lock.

He sees the MEN and they see him. He slides a desk

against the door, then backs away, pistol ready.

Seeing a phone, DEAN grabs it.

No tone. Just a RECORDING of Nancy Sinatra's song

"These Boots are Made for Walking".

DEAN heaves a coffee table up on the desk.

The door pushes in--

The door keeps pushing.

DEAN FIRES high.

The pushing stops.

Then DEAN hears the distant sound of SIRENS approaching.

DEAN rips off his sweater, takes out a lighter, and

sets the sweater on fire.

He throws it into a garbage can and tosses styrofoam

cups in on top of it.

The pushing starts again, but before DEAN can fire, a

small cylindrical device drops into the room.

A STUN GRENADE.

DEAN ducks as a BLINDING FLASH rocks the room.

The window is blown open. Smoke billows out. DEAN,

temporarily blinded and deaf, struggles to a ledge as

fire engines arrive.

Fire trucks, police cars and an ambulance arrive

beneath DEAN as HICKS watches from his van.

DEAN sits in back with a PARA-MEDIC, covered in soot,

breathing hard through an oxygen mask as the ambulance

WAILS and weaves through traffic. He looks through the

rear window to see--

TWO CARS FOLLOWING, keeping pace. Off to the side, RFK

Stadium is emptying, a Redskins game is over.

DEAN rips off the oxygen mask--

DEAN whips out his pistol and shoves it in the

PARAMEDIC's face--

The ambulance pulls over and the back doors fly open.

DEAN leaps out into the crowd.

The OTHER CARS pull over and PRATT and JONES exit. They

scan the area and see DEAN descending a stairwell

marked: METRO.

DEAN stands at the end of the crowded platform. PRATT

and JONES work through the CROWD as the train pulls in.

DEAN slides on board. The departure HORN sounds. JONES

and PRATT step on.

DEAN huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as PRATT

and JONES move through the cars searching for faces.

DEAN looks for an out. He sees an emergency stop handle.

He YANKS it forward. PASSENGERS yell. The brakes lock

and SCREECH. The train slows. Then stops.

DEAN opens the door.

And jumps. He looks around. Just black curved track in

either direction. He starts running.

Then he hears it.

The horrible SCREECHING of an approaching train.

Trapped.

On one side, the train he left. On the other, a wall.

He runs down the track with all that's left.

PRATT and JONES reach the open door and see the

oncoming train bearing down on DEAN. They duck in as

the train SWISHES by.

DEAN lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing

greasy ground as the train screeches over him.

Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric.

Then it's over. The train's gone. DEAN's alive.

He gets up to see PRATT and JONES leap to the tracks.

Then he sees an "EMERGENCY ACCESS" sign beaming in the

darkness. A God-send. DEAN runs for it.

PRATT and JONES fly out the door and into a park.

It's empty. Quiet.

No Dean anywhere.

The Lincoln Memorial is seen in the distance. REYNOLDS

has broken off PARTY GUESTS and paces in his tux, an

encrypted cellular phone pressed to his ear.

A WAITER with a tray steps out onto the terrace...

The WAITER goes back inside.

REYNOLDS disconnects, breathes deeply, and goes back to

the party.

DEAN watches from the shadows. It seems quiet. He's

about to move for the entrance when he sees--

A cigarette lighter flame-up inside a parked car. TWO

MEN sit inside, watching. DEAN retreats into the shadows.

Quiet. DEAN listens through the door and hears nothing.

He KNOCKS softly.

No reply.

He tries the doorknob. It opens.

DEAN enters. The place is still.

No answer. DEAN drifts through the living room. A lamp

is knocked over on the floor. DEAN keeps moving into

the bedroom. He stops in the doorway - eyes fixed inside.

DEAN'S POV: RACHEL lies on her stomach, naked in bed.

She doesn't respond. He touches her.

Nothing.

He turns her over. Her face is frozen, eyes open, neck

purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation.

DEAN wants to throw up but holds it down.

Then, under a night table, he sees a shirt. He grabs it.

DEAN'S POV: An oxford button-down. The inside collar is

stamped with a dry-cleaner's marker reading: R. DEAN.

Panic overtakes horror as DEAN quickly searches for

anything else of his that may have been planted inside

the apartment.

Under the bed - a cufflink.

In the bathroom - a hairbrush.

On the desk - documents with his name on them.

DEAN shoves everything into a garbage bag. Grabbing a

towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from

everything he touched.

Exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as--

A NEIGHBORS DOOR OPENS. A COUPLE stumbles out, laughing,

kissing...and noticing DEAN leaving Rachel's condo.

JERRY walks alone through the large underground garage

on the way to his car. He pauses, thinking he's heard

something.

Nothing.

He continues walking. He reaches his car. Suddenly

someone comes up behind him fast. JERRY spins--

--it's DEAN.

JERRY looks at the ground for a long moment...

DEAN starts to leave...

Establishing. A quiet street in Dean's neighborhood.

Several REPORTERS are camped in Dean's driveway

entrance, sipping coffees. Farther down the street, a

JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE is parked. The driver waits and

watches.

DEAN sneaks between two large houses, ducking by

windows and scaling a fence. Somewhere a DOG BARKS a

warning as DEAN plows through a large hedge, entering

the backyard to his home.

DEAN quietly unlocks the door and enters. He listens.

The house is quiet. Empty.

INT. DEAN'S FOYER - DAY

KEYS JINGLE in the front lock. The door opens and STACY

enters.

The TV suddenly REMOTES ON - VOLUME LOUD.

She turns as DEAN approaches fast--

DEAN's hand cups her mouth as he pulls her into a

pantry closet.

STACY nods understanding. DEAN slowly removes his hand.

STACY gently touches his forehead where he's been cut...

She grabs him and kisses him. The kiss lasts a good

long time before STACY smacks him on the arm--

She kisses him again.

It dawns on him...everything starts coming together...

The DRIVER continues to watch the area. Then--

DRIVER's POV: THE RANGE ROVER flies out of the driveway,

tires SCREECHING as it speeds through the quiet

neighborhood.

The REPORTERS stare at each other a beat--

--then leap for their cars.

Unmarked cars of various descriptions rapidly appear

from nowhere giving chase.

The RANGE ROVER speeds through the neighborhood.

Suddenly, two cars are out in front, blocking the way.

The Range Rover swerves and breaks as two more cars rip

up behind, boxing it in. An un-marked Trans-Am lags

behind, keeping reporters at bay.

Doors fling open. JONES and THREE MEN, all in plain

clothes, pistols and MAC-10 aimed at the Range Rover.

Nothing happens.

The MEN move closer--

JONES grabs the door and rips it open, revealing Dean's

PISS-FRIGHTENED NANNY behind the wheel in Dean's trench

coat and hat.

JONES YANKS her out, puts her hard to the ground, gun

jammed to her head, as other search the Range Rover for

Dean.

DEAN drives the Nanny's rusted, low-rider Dodge out of

the driveway. He pauses and looks. The streets are empty.

He turns onto the street and calmly drives away.

Establishing. A playground jammed with kids. A kickball

game's in progress. ERIC waits his turn to kick. TRACY,

a college-age teaching assistant comes over.

ERIC looks up...

DEAN stands at the edge of the playground in clean,

casual clothes. ERIC runs over, face glowing.

ERIC hangs his head...busted...then shouts to a GROUP

OF KIDS on the playground...

DYLAN comes trotting over, carrying his backpack...

DYLAN hunts through the backpack as DEAN and ERIC looks

on. All kinds of junk flies out--candy, comics, game-

cartridges--

DEAN eyes the pieces of the GameBoy, knowing that

somewhere in the puzzle of plastic and chips is the key

to his problems.

PEDESTRIANS walk on the sidewalk. A MAN comes along and

drops a few letters in the corner mailbox.

From the other direction comes DEAN. Without stopping,

he casually slashes the mailbox with chalk.

DEAN's asleep. There's a SOFT SHUFFLING SOUND. The

CAMERA EXPLORES for the source, moving by the windows,

flashing neon, a TV and finally, the door.

We PUSH CLOSER as a MULE TOOL snakes under the door.

The tool pops upright against the door's inside. The

strap drapes over the doorknob and tightens. The

doorknob turns and opens.

SOMEONE slips in--

CLOSE ON DEAN asleep. A HAND covers his mouth. DEAN's

eyes go wide.

Then he sees it's BRILL...

Establishing. The 10-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge crosses

the Bay like a serpent worming toward distant Norfolk.

Traffic is thin at this hour.

We PUSH IN on a TOYOTA PICK-UP truck heading south.

BRILL drives with DEAN riding shotgun.

BRILL ejects as cassette from the dashboard and hands

it to DEAN.

BRILL checks the rear-view mirror.

BRILL's POV: Car headlights following in the distance.

BRILL does a bootleggers U-turn. Several cars pass by

in the opposite direction.

BRILL turns off the headlights, does another U-turn,

pulls off on an emergency road and stops.

He turns off the engine, rolls down the window, looks

up into the night sky and listens.

BRILL's POV: A cloudy night. Silent except for the

water and a distant fog-horn. No sounds of aircraft.

BRILL is staring upward...

Re-establishing. A massive, dark place filled with

glowing monitors.

CLOSE ON A MONITOR - displaying a live SAT feed showing

a thermograph image of Brill's truck. The color heat

image of BRILL looking upward is fairly clear. He pops

his head back into the truck and pulls onto the road.

The satellite continues tracking the truck.

BRILL drives along a high fence surrounding acres of

empty warehouses, docks and rust-bitten fences. He's

still on constant alert - looking for sign of their

presence.

DEAN gives him a look that says, "I don't know what

that means".

The pick-up stops by a long two-story warehouse.

BRILL and DEAN enter the 2nd story of a large, empty

structure. DEAN is carrying a crumpled, brown paper bag.

In the center of the cavernous space, a windowless,

cinderblock room built on 5-foot supports.

BRILL opens a side door revealing a mini-generator. He

pushes the start button. The generator HUMS to life.

DEAN tosses the paper bag to BRILL, who empties its

contents (the pieces of the GameBoy) on to the table.

DEAN sits alone, smoking a cigarette, and watching

Norfolk rise from dawn's fog.

In the distance we see BRILL coming down from the

warehouse toward DEAN.

He stands behind DEAN for a moment before...

DEAN gets up and joins BRILL. The two of them start in

the direction of the second warehouse.

JONES and THREE MEN are huddled in a duct.

JONES and the three men start down the corridor, guns

drawn.

DEAN and BRILL are kneeling beside the Chevy, letting

the air out of the tires.

And with that, THE FIRST WAREHOUSE EXPLODES, sending a

fireball of debris in all directions.

BRILL jumps into the Chevy, turns the key and the

engine ignites. DEAN leaps in. BRILL stomps on the gas

and tires screech. The Chevy hurtles through the

warehouse toward a shut garage door. BRILL clicks a

remote. The door rises.

OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - The Chevy roars outward,

screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined

with warehouses.

DEAN looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a

Saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.

They pass an area with no warehouses. The Saturn turns,

heading straight at them.

The Saturn pulls on the road behind them. The MAN in

the Saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle. The

side window by Dean's head shatters.

BRILL one-hands the pistol and checks the load.

The Chevy enters a narrow lane, the Saturn right behind.

With the Chevy's tires flat and flapping, the Saturn

hugs their rear. DEAN looks back again as the RIFLEMAN

FIRES--

The rear window EXPLODES. DEAN pops up and fires three

quick, well-placed rounds.

The Saturn swerves and drops back. BRILL's impressed.

DEAN looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an

iron cross-bar. BRILL, unfazed, pushes the Chevy faster.

Beam or no beam, he's going through.

BRILL and DEAN hit the deck as the Chevy's hood scrapes

just under the beam. The windshield frame takes the

full impact. The beam slices through steel and glass,

decapitating the car. They emerge on the other side

minus roof and windows as--

--the Saturn SCREECH-STOPS inches from the beam and

debris. A MAN leaps out, shoulders his rifle and aims--

--but the Chevy disappears around a building.

A foggy morning. The rural highway's deserted at this

early hour. The Chevy rumbles by...

DEAN and BRILL, windblown but alive, remove shards of

glass. BRILL eyes the road behind him.

Empty.

He stops talking.

He hears ROTOR THUMPS as a black HELICOPTER appears

over a fog-laced hillside, swooping down.

BRILL floors it. The helicopter drops in closer as

BRILL swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70-

plus on flapping tires. A helicopter SHARP-SHOOTER aims

with an M-16.

A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the

Chevy's hood. The engine starts knocking.

The road straightens. Up ahead, a tunnel.

More bullets slice the hood. Radiator fluid starts

hissing. The Chevy starts dying.

BRILL stomps the pedal, squeezing out every last kick

of horsepower.

Rubber flaps. Tires shred. Steam hisses. Bullets fly.

The helicopter swoops in lower and lower for the kill shot.

The SHARP-SHOOTER lines DEAN in his sights.

The PILOT keeps pace, dropping closer. The SHARP-

SHOOTER has the shot.

The Chevy reaches the tunnel's opening on sparking,

screeching wheel rims.

The helicopter pulls up, missing the hill by inches.

But not the power lines. The PILOT sees them too late.

The helicopter flies into a web of cables. The upper

rotor slices neatly off. The helicopter's body rockets

downward to the road where it bounces and skids like a

rock on water until it meets an oncoming semi-truck

head-on.

BLAM!

BRILL tries steering but metal wheels on concrete don't

work. The car shimmies like it's on ice. Sparks fly as

they bash into the tunnel wall, grinding to a stop.

A GRUNGE-DUDE blasts his car-stereo as he enters the

tunnel, unaware of the mayhem behind him.

He slows, seeing a smoking wreck ahead.

Closer, he sees DEAN waving him down. He slows more.

Bad move.

BRILL opens the rear door, leaps in, and points his

pistol at the GRUNGE-DUDE's face.

DEAN leaps in front.

DEAN slides into the driver's seat, drops it in gear

and goes.

The Dodge erupts from the tunnel.

Up ahead, the Saturn and another car approach fast in

the opposite lane, speeding toward the tunnel's opening.

The car's fly by, unaware of DEAN and BRILL passing in

the Dodge.

The Dodge continues on, fading into the fog.

REYNOLDS and HICKS walk down a white hallway three

football fields in length, filled with bustling

employees conservatively dressed.

REYNOLDS walks off leaving HICKS to ponder his fate.

Establishing. Plastic flags and PRICES SLASHED signs

are everywhere. A blue Taurus pulls off the lot...

BRILL drives. DEAN thinks.

The car radio is playing a newscast...

DEAN has started listening to the radio...

BRILL educates DEAN on simple ways to alter one's

appearance.

A large auditorium. Preparations are being made for

Senator Albert's upcoming speech. BRILL and DEAN

casually case the area for vulnerabilities.

Establishing. A five-star hotel overlooking

Massachusetts Bay.

CHRISTA HAWKINS, late 20's, the Senator's advance-

person, stands at registration securing rooms for her

boss and his team.

Next to CHRISTA, looking conservative and

appearance, is DEAN, eavesdropping on the Senator's

room numbers and any other pertinent info.

Establishing. One of those cheesy places in a mini-mall.

BRILL and DEAN go shopping.

The curtains are drawn. Devices cover the table and bed.

DEAN drives while BRILL sits with his open PC lap-top

connect to his cellular phone.

CLOSE ON SCREEN - A street map appears with positions

of the network's relays. Lines appear indicating all

in-progress cellular calls along with their locations.

BRILL punches a number into the cellular and the phone

locks on the signal. Through the lap-top, we hear

RINGING and then an ANSWERING VOICE.

BRILL dials his computer into a new line. TONES and

COMMANDS fly quick as Brill's computer modems into another.

A customized RV zips down the highway.

It's a plush affair befitting the Senator's position.

ALBERT speaks in the cellular phone while an aide,

PATRICK, reviews last minute changes for Albert's

upcoming speech.

CHRISTA stands at the front desk as the CLERK hands her

several faxes.

DEAN, disguised, sits across the lobby reading a paper.

DEAN's POV: CHRISTA exits the hotel to a waiting car.

Numbered doors on each side. BRILL walks down the hall,

hair slicked, mustache, wearing a suit and carrying a

briefcase.

SERIES OF SHOTS:

BRILL entering CHRISTA's room and opening his briefcase

revealing tools and listening bugs.

--BRILL planting devices behind the headboard--

--Inside the telephone--

--Behind the desk--

--Inside the TV--

--BRILL rifling through CHRISTA's personal items,

eyeing paper work, photographing interesting documents.

--BRILL opening a connecting door, picking a second

lock, and entering the adjoining suite.

A clock reads 1:28 AM. The lights are on and the bed

unslept in. Christa's not seen. Then the connecting

door opens--

CHRISTA steps from the Senator's adjoining suite in a

silk robe, nothing underneath. She turns in the doorway,

revealing ALBERT, naked in a towel.

CHRISTA closes the door, climbs in bed and grabs the

remote. She clicks on the TV.

FEEDBACK SCREECHES from the set.

She tries changing channels but the SCREECHING

continues. She tries turning off the set, but it won't

turn off. She grabs the phone and dials.

CHRISTA is noticing that her voice is causing the TV

image to distort in sync.

SENATOR ALBERT dines with an aide as PATRICK approaches,

a grave look on his face. PATRICK takes a seat.

PATRICK reaches in his case and pulls out one of

Brill's listening bugs and hands it to ALBERT who puts

on his eyeglasses.

Seated next to ALBERT's table is DEAN, unnoticed as he

sips coffee, skims news, and eavesdrops on their

MURMURS with a small, concealed parabolic mic and ear-

phone.

A phone distribution box is open, revealing a mass of

circuit boards. BRILL stands at the box holding a

circuit-dialer phone to his ear.

INTERCUT WITH:

DEAN watches PATRICK approach a pay phone.

BRILL connects two alligator clips to a line inside the

box.

BRILL's phone line immediately rings. He waits...then

answers.

CLOSE ON A FREQUENCY COUNTER sweeping a chest of

drawers. The device starts BUZZING, indicating a

transmitter.

BRILL, disguised, is on hands and knees, searching

under a chest where he 'discovers' a bug he planted

earlier.

BRILL shows it to PATRICK, a very embarrassed HOTEL

MANAGER and a very serious HEAD OF HOTEL SECURITY.

BRILL stands in front of SENATOR ALBERT.

BRILL unwraps a towel revealing the grease-covered NSA

tracker he removed from Dean's BMW.

PATRICK escorts BRILL out of the RV.

The SENATOR, fuming, opens a book, looks up a phone

number and punches it into his phone.

A place packed with STUDENTS, computers and TEACHERS.

DEAN sits in a corner reading a magazine, but what he's

really watching is--

A WELL-DRESSED MAN at the counter, his back to DEAN,

ordering a cup of coffee.

The MAN glances at DEAN off the mirror behind the counter.

BRILL walks in and joins DEAN.

BRILL looks over at the WELL-DRESSED MAN.

They're about to start for the front door when an

unmarked police car pulls up in front.

A rowdy group of FRAT BOYS flood in, loud and busy. By

the time they pass, BRILL and DEAN are gone.

The WELL-DRESSED MAN scans the coffee shop and sees the

back door swinging shut.

DEAN and BRILL run down the street, through an alley

and over a fence to another street. They slow as they

approach the parked Taurus. BRILL takes the wheel with

DEAN beside him.

They pull into traffic. Things look good, but then the

UNMARKED CAR and a SQUAD CAR scream up behind, lights

flashing.

BRILL dumps the car into low gear and the Taurus comes

alive.

A COP picks up the radio-mic.

Through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a

one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar

into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront. BRILL's at

his best, putting distance between himself and the cops

at every turn.

Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race

down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end.

BRILL slams into reverse. They screech backward, tires

smoking.

Too late. The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing

them in.

BRILL hits the brakes. He looks back at the dead-end

and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. BRILL

gives it everything. If they can get enough speed and

hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing

wall.

They hit the ramp full speed. The front end bottoms at

the Taurus bounces skyward. Tires clip the wall as the

car flips and smashes into a parked rail-car filled

with coal.

They aren't going anywhere.

Back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop.

A ROOKIE climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his

gun and nears...

Inside the Taurus, the windows are shattered. Steam

hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere.

DEAN shimmies out through a broken side window. He

barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so.

His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal,

which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.

He looks back to see that BRILL is hanging out the

driver's side, bleeding badly and covered in gas.

An unmarked car with red-flashers races up the rail-

yard and stops. The ROOKIE turns as JONES and KRUG hop out.

KRUG draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly

shoots the COP dead.

DEAN is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to

dig himself out of the coal.

KRUG inspects the Taurus interior for anything of

interest. JONES scans the area.

BRILL can only gurgle blood. JONES pops the Taurus's

trunk had looks inside.

KRUG digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for

Dean. Then BRILL sees him--

BRILL's POV: DEAN down off the side of the coal-car,

lodged in the coal pile. He's safe, but not once KRUG

discovers he's not in the car.

BRILL pushes in the cigarette lighter.

JONES dumps everything from the Taurus into the

unmarked car. SIRENS suddenly fade in.

KRUG digs faster, looking for DEAN, as JONES approaches

with his pistol, clambering around for BRILL.

JONES starts to back out, just as the Taurus's

cigarette lighter pops out. BRILL grabs it.

KRUG eyes the glowing lighter. Then he eyes BRILL.

Shit.

BRILL ignites the gas. WA-WOOMFF!! A fireball explodes,

consuming all - the car, BRILL, KRUG. JONES is blown

off his feet from the concussion.

JONES wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and

tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach.

DEAN watches from the shadows as flames incinerate

everything.

MARSHAL and SHAFFER dine with REYNOLDS at a restaurant

overlooking the Potomac.

REYNOLDS rides in the back of the car, a cellular to

his ear.

INTERCUT WITH:

The room is crammed with people as HICKS talks over the

phone.

ORGAN MUSIC can be heard as REYNOLDS snaps his phone shut.

Establishing. A beautiful church in an expensive

neighborhood.

A crowded Catholic mass. The PRIEST delivers a sermon

from an altar decorated with Christmas candles and

evergreen.

REYNOLDS stands in a pew beside his TWO DAUGHTERS and

his WIFE. He turns to those immediately around him,

shaking their hands.

A disguised DEAN takes REYNOLDS hand and shakes it...

REYNOLDS is dumbstruck...

DEAN sits on a bed while talking into a modified

cellular computer. The screen shows his current call

signal re-routing between relay stations.

INTERCUT WITH:

CLOSE ON A SMALL GRAY CONE-SHAPED MICROWAVE ANTENNA

CLOSE ON A MICROWAVE TOWER WITH NINE GRAY CONES

pointing nine directions. The intercepted phone signals

being relayed.

Re-establishing. A concrete building rising from the woods.

CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREENS showing hundreds of phone

numbers scrolling by. A massive vacume cleaner of every

cellular call being made in the state of Maryland. The

computer scans for trigger numbers or words.

A phone number locks on the screen--

The phone on the nightstand begins to RING. REYNOLDS

wakes as his wife rolls to the other side of the bed.

He grabs his scrambler phone and goes into--

REYNOLDS closes the door and waits as scrambled lines

connect. Finally, a confirming tone.

INTERCUT WITH:

HICKS is on the phone.

Establishing. Peaceful street, quaint apartments. THREE

MEN stroll to the entrance of a well-maintained

building. One jimmies the lock and a moment later

they're in.

HICKS, JONES and DAVIS prepare. All have miniature

earphones. DAVIS checks his silenced pistol. HICKS

activates a frequency locator. The needle snaps on. He

looks at DAVIS and JONES.

They're ready.

All hand signals, no words, as the trio ascend the

staircase.

One flight, two. Then HICKS stops. The needle says

they're close.

HICKS motions. Their target's on two. They move down

the hall - silent except for a creaking floor and a TV

SHOW drifting from an apartment.  Someone's up at this

hour.

They move on. HICKS watches the needle as it moves. He

motions DAVIS and JONES to a door. JONES puts a

reverse-viewer against the peep-hole.

JONES's POV: A view of an entryway and living room. A

light bleeds from an O.S. source. Beyond that there's

no sign of life.

HICKS puts a contact-mic against the door and listens

to FAINT CONVERSATION somewhere inside, possibly the

phone call. HICKS nods to JONES who quickly picks the

lock while DAVIS eyes the hall.

After a nervous moment, the door opens and HICKS, JONES

and DAVIS enter.

They spread out, searching the well-decorated condo for

the target.

They near the room with light. Using a mini-mirror,

HICKS looks around the bend to see--

A BEDROOM. There's a briefcase on the bed.

They enter.

From the bathroom they hear sounds of RUNNING WATER.

They slowly approach. Wood again CREAKS beneath them.

DEAN's VOICE is heard through the locked door.

HICKS signals "on three".

He counts, and they SMASH the door open to see--

--a cellular phone taped to a Baby-Monitor. DEAN's

nowhere in sight.

Spinning banks of reporters manned by POLICE DISPATCHERS.

We move to one desk where a phone rings.

An LED immediately displays the caller's name; KRUGER,

JACK, along with his social-security number and date of

birth.

DEAN has the phone circuit box open and is plugged in

with a phone-line. Over the phone's mouthpiece, he

holds an electronic Voice-Mask which alters his voice

into an old man's.

Three TECHNICIANS overhear the police radio call.

HICKS spins and heads for the door. DAVIS hits it first.

He grabs the doorknob and pulls--

--and the knob rips from the door, trailing small wires.

TWO SQUAD CARS come rolling up and FOUR COPS get out

and head into the building.

JONES is trying to pry the door open with his fingers.

No use.

While JONES continues on the door, DAVIS runs to the

window.

Throughout this, HICKS will stand in the middle of the

room and, simply, oddly, stare at the mantle over the

fireplace.

HICKS smiles...and now he starts laughing a little...

HICKS motions to a framed picture over the fireplace.

The framed picture is of Senator SAM ALBERT and CHRISTA

HAWKINS.

DOOR WOOD EXPLODES inward. The TWO COPS roll in

crouched positions, weapons drawn.

HICKS doesn't move, DAVIS freezes like a deer in

headlights, JONES stares with cold, dead eyes.

Two more COPS arrive. JONES and DAVIS drop their guns.

They do so. COPS THREE and FOUR go room to room making

sure no one else is lurking. In the bedroom, they find

the briefcase. Inside the briefcase--

--listening bugs, installation equipment and

compromising photos of the Senator with Christa.

Back in the living room, CHRISTA has walked through the

broken-in apartment door to see JONES, HICKS and DAVIS

lying on the floor at gun point.

CHRISTA backs slowly out of the apartment and into--

CHRISTA holds her hand over her mouth and is shaking. A

VOICE comes from an alcove...

She turns. DEAN steps out from the alcove.

An up-scale neighborhood. Two inexpensive cars that

don't seem to belong there sit in front of a large home.

DEAN sits with a drink in his hand. Across from him are

CHRISTA and PATRICK.

They sit in uncomfortable silence for a moment before

SENATOR ALBERT enters in bathrobe and pajamas.

DEAN tosses the chip to ALBERT.

REYNOLDS is asleep when the PHONE wakes him up. Once

again, he reaches for his scrambled phone heads into

the bathroom.

After waiting for the signal that the line's clear...

The DOORBELL rings. REYNOLDS is alarmed.

Now there's BANGING at the door and DOORBELL RINGS again.

REYNOLDS snaps the phone shut and goes downstairs to

the door.

When he opens the door he sees TWO FBI AGENTS with

their ID's flapped open and six uniformed POLICEMEN

backing them up.

A PAPERBOY tosses a newspaper at the Dean's door.

Stacy has C-SPAN on the TV while she makes breakfast

for ERIC. SENATOR ALBERT is addressing the SENATE.

ERIC and STACY whip around--

STACY and ERIC run to DEAN...

ERIC and DEAN hug.

But ERIC has disappeared up the stairs...

STACY points to the TV and DEAN watches for a moment...

DEAN arrives as STACY takes him by the arm. They head

upstairs as ALBERT continues on...

ALBERT's speech continues as we...

ROLL END CREDITS.
