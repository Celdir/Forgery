CREDITS ROLL OVER

Black and white newsreel footage from the 1930s. Clips from

prize fights featuring two different boxers against various

opponents. One a light heavyweight--pure finesse, a

counterpunches; the other, stouter and stronger, a

headhunting puncher.

The intercutting of the two fighters suggests a possible

showdown at the end of the newsreel. No such luck.

END CREDITS

CLOSE UP ON:

A TRIPLE CARBON LAPD "INCIDENT REPORT" FORM trapped in an old

Corona typewriter. The keys pound letters into the blank

spaces.

INCIDENT: THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTS...JUNE 10, 1943...

REPORTING OFFICER...DWIGHT "BUCKY" BLEICHERT

EXT. BOYLE HEIGHTS - EVERGREEN AND WABASH - DUSK

A WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent

LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The

sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop

for their arrival.

We focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT, 26, (The counterpuncher from

the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier.

Bucky's minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three

pound truncheon.

BUCKY'S POV:

Hundreds of in-uniform GI's use baseball bats and two-by-

fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans.

Most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and

hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol who've chosen

to "restore order" by cheering on their countrymen against

the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters.

Sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows. Darkness falls

quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos.

Suddenly Bucky's RUNNING--

away from the action...

down a side street and onto a

QUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK.

He slows to a jog, trying to gather his thoughts. And then a

voice:

EXT. A BUNGALOW COURTYARD - SAME

A POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE

ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway.

The marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by-

fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet,

dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is.

The terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard,

trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the

marines' blows with his own truncheon.

Bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in,

fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick.

On instinct, Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the

marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft

midsections.

And now Blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows

to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into

a heap.

The marines reduced to rubble, Lee Blanchard turns his

attention to the Zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads

him away. He motions for Bucky to follow.

Lee turns back to the marines:

One of them flips Lee off. The Zooter kicks him in the chest

as Lee pulls him away from them, laughing.

The three men start back toward the riots. Gunshots can be

heard. Palm trees blaze up into the night.

The man shakes his head "no".

Blanchard spies a home with newspapers stacked on the front

porch.

LEE JIMMYING THE FRONT DOOR...

INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER

Tomas Dos Santos cuffed by his ankles to a radiator. The

three men are on their second fifth of Cutty Sark swiped from

the kitchen cupboard.

Dos Santos sings a drunken Spanish version of "The

Chattanooga Choo Choo" before slumping to his side and

passing out.

Bucky covers him with a blanket.

Lee gets up and wanders into the living room. From the

kitchen Bucky watches Lee stare out at the flames.

A CLOSE UP OF TOMAS DOS SANTOS' FACE

screaming in silence.

AS WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Tomas Dos Santos dying in a large Plexiglas GAS CHAMBER.

Bucky stands in the back of the room, forcing himself to

watch. He can't stand it and leaves.

IN THE FRONT ROW

Lee also watches, elbows on knees and chin in hands. He can't

stand it, either. He stays.

IN THE HALLWAY AFTERWARDS

Bucky watches from afar as men in suits shake Lee's hand and

brush imaginary lint off of his BRAND NEW SERGEANT'S STRIPES.

Their eyes meet briefly as Bucky retreats to daylight.

Another TRIPLE CARBON FORM FILLED OUT ON THE CORONA...

Transfer and Promotion...Sergeant Lee Blanchard...

Highland Park Vice to Central Warrants...Effective

10/14/46

EXT. 2ND AND BEAUDRY - DAY

An extremely bored Bucky Bleichert gives a man a speeding

ticket and sends him on his way.

EXT./INT. RADIO PATROL CAR - MOVING

Bucky drives as a ROOKIE COP chatters in the seat next to

him.

INT. THE CENTRAL MUSTER ROOM - DAY

Bucky sits at his desk filling out a form as the rookie cop

prattles on in the background.

AN OLDER OFFICER

walks by the rookie and rolls his eyes. Catching Bucky's

look, the cop throws him a shadow punching one-two. Bucky

smiles thinly. Returns to his paperwork. Then another cop

passes by and breaks into a bob-and-weave. Bucky looks

puzzled and annoyed.

He grabs a third cop walking by (TOM JOSLIN).

Bucky nods.

Bucky takes a surreptitious peek across the room at JOHNNY

VOGEL, fat, slick-hair and bad skin.

Bucky shakes his head, dismissing the whole thing.

INT. THE RADIO PATROL CAR - ANOTHER DAY

Bucky drives on as the rookie talks and talks...

INT. BUCKY'S GARAGE - NIGHT

Bucky hits a speed-bag, building up a sweat.

He hits the bag faster and faster.

INT. THE CENTRAL MUSTER ROOM - DAY

A desk officer hands Bucky a note.

INT. CITY HALL - CHIEF OF DETECTIVES OFFICE - LATER

A secretary leads Bucky into an office with CHIEF OF

DETECTIVES THAD GREEN etched on the pebble glass door.

Inside the office: Lee Blanchard, ASST. D.A. ELLIS LOEW, and

CHIEF THAD GREEN. They all sit in matched leather chairs.

She exits. An awkward silence.

Bucky shakes their hands, nodding to each.  Chief Green

gestures for him to sit.

A glance to Lee...

Blanchard and Green smile; Loew frowns.

Bucky looks to Lee.

Bucky eyes Lee quickly, assessing his larger but slightly

softer physique.

All the remaining eyes are on him.

Back slaps and congratulations all around.

EXT. THE CITY HALL PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATEER

Bucky exits and sees Lee leaning against an unmarked car

talking with a striking woman in an auburn pageboy cut.

Lee waves Bucky over.

Lee puts his arm around her.

He staggers around like a punch-drunk fighter.

A flicker of anger in her eyes.

Bucky shakes his head. Turns to Kay.

Bucky and Lee break into laughter. Bucky sticks out his hand.

Lee takes it.

Bucky tips his hat to Kay and turns to go.

He stops at hearing his real name. But he knows she's waiting

to see his reaction so he keeps walking...

BUCKY'S BOXING MONTAGE

--Bucky hits the heavy bag in the police gym while Lee spars

in the background

--Bucky runs through Elysian Park with two pound weights on

his ankles.

--Bucky spars with a fighter, peppering him with jab after

jab.

--Cops exchange betting markers during roll call...

EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LINCOLN HEIGHTS - DAY

Bucky pulls up in front of a small ugly house in a tired

neighborhood. He exits the car carrying a cardboard box full

of canned goods and old girlie magazines.

ON THE PORCH OF THE HOUSE

a bony old man sits in a broken chair, aiming a BB pistol at

some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard.

ON BUCKY'S FACE

disgust and sadness.

This is DOLPH BLEICHERT, Bucky's father. Bucky approaches,

pulling a chair up next to his father. Up close it's even

worse: white skin stretched tight over blue veins, yellow

rimming his rheumy eyes. Flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy

shirt.

He aims the BB gun and fires at an airplane: the gun's empty.

Bucky enters the house. Half-eaten cans of beans on the

dining room table, an entire legion of broken balsa wood

airplane kits. Alley cats wander in and out of the kitchen,

nosing their faces into open tuna fish cans...

BACK ON THE PORCH

Dolph leans on the porch rail. Bucky returns.

He searches his father's eyes for a response and gets none.

He surveys the house again. Somewhere in the corner of his

eye we see the glint of an idea...

INSIDE THE HOUSE

Bucky on the phone.

INT. THE POLICE BOXING GYM

Bucky leans against a wall watching Lee spar. Studying him.

Mentally fighting the sparring partner's fight.

INT. A BANK - DAY

Bucky sits at a desk with an assistant manager and fills out

forms. The manager counts out approximately $4,500 in cash.

Bucky slides him the forms. The manager slides him the cash.

INT. THE GOOD LUCK BAR - NIGHT

Bucky slides into a booth across from PETE LUKINS.

Bucky pushes an envelope across to Pete. He looks in it.

Pete nods his head, thinking.

Pete sticks out his hand.

Bucky takes his hand.

INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

Bucky takes apart his sparring partner with a series of

lightning quick counterpunches.

EXT. DOLPH BLEICHERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bucky watches from across the street as AN OFF-DUTY NURSE

tries to get Papa Bleichert to eat a sandwich.

INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

Bucky watches Lee spar. His quick eyes spying:

--scar tissue over Lee's right eye

--Lee dropping his left when throwing the right hook

--Lee tucking his elbows too tight and opening up his ribcage

INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

Kay approaches Bucky as he studies Lee.

She waves to Lee between rounds. He blows a kiss back.

A roar from the gym onlookers. Lee's sparring partner hits

the deck, blood spraying from his mouth.

She keeps walking. He just stares...

INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A half-eaten steak and two beers gone. It's six hours later

and Bucky's still thinking about Kay's exit line. Restless.

He grabs his jacket.

INT. HEARST BUILDING - HERALD-EXAMINER MORGUE - NIGHT

Bucky flashes his badge to a late-night clerk who escorts him

into the newspaper's morgue. Pulls a bound stack of newspaper

clippings and gives them to Bucky. He begins poring through

them...

A newspaper photo of a BANK shifts into live action:

A GRAINY NEWSREEL-TYPE FLASHBACK (SLO-MO)

An armored truck idles in front of the Boulevard-Citizens

Bank. Three men dressed in guard uniforms run out of the

front of the bank, an alarm keening in the background.

Three police cars converge on the scene and a gun battle

ensues... Two of the bank robbers are shot as the third man

(the one carrying the money) jumps into the truck. The truck

takes off, able to escape when someone from inside the truck

throws open the doors and pushes the naked and bound

legitimate guards out the back and into the line of

pursuit...

A newspaper clipping headline: "Tip from Ex-boxer cop

breaks B-C Bank Job"

A still photo of Lee which becomes live action as...

INT. A SMALL VENICE BEACH APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A younger Lee and four other cops tear apart a small flat. In

a closet they find BANK GUARD UNIFORMS, BANK BAGS, and a

small stash of MARIJUANA.

FLASHBACK: A HATCHET FACED MAN (DEWITT) LED BY HANDCUFFS

THROUGH A GIANT CROWD...

FLASHBACK: LEE LEADING KAY FROM THE COURTROOM, HAND ON HER

ELBOW...

BACK TO PRESENT: Bucky walks through downtown L.A., hands

stuffed in his pockets like James Dean...

Bucky passes A WHORE on the corner, their eyes meet for a

moment and he walks on.

Bucky turns back to give the whore a second look but she's gone.

A HAMMER HITTING A BELL

and the fight is on.

INSIDE THE PACKED ACADEMY GYM

Cops and mobsters sit shoulder to shoulder, cigar smoke like

L.A. haze as

LEE CHARGES BUCKY, the big man trying to cut of the ring.

Bucky engages, dodging Lee's thundering blows and peppering

back with counterpunches...

**The general fight storyline is this: a very even and brutal

match see-sawing back and forth, Bucky doing all he can to

make it into the middle rounds. Somewhere around the fourth

or fifth round his competitive juices take over and he begins

trying to win at all costs. The two men hurt each other

badly, and in the eighth round it's anybody's fight.

Bucky punches toe-to-toe with Lee, abandoning his strategy.

Lee knocks Bucky out.

INT. BUCKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Bucky lies in bed, radio playing jazz. He looks horrible--

face swollen, lip split, stitches across his nose. He sips

whiskey from a bottle through a straw.

The phone rings and rings. He refuses to answer it...

INT. A REST HOME - ANOTHER DAY

Bucky, bruised but somewhat better, stands in the hallway of

a very nice rest home. He surreptitiously watches his father

as the old man tries to grab at a nurse.

EXT. THE REST HOME - MINUTES LATER

Pete Lukins waits outside on the porch for Bucky.

The scene widens behind the two men and we see the sign on

the facility:

KING DAVID VILLA

Jewish stars adorn the sign.

INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bucky stands in front of his mirror clipping at his stitches

with scissors. He hears a voice outside his window.

Bucky recognizes the voice and goes to the window.

EXT. THE COURTYARD - SAME

Lee Blanchard, his own bruises fading, stands in the yard.

Off Lee's devilish grin:

INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - MORNING

A door marked "DETECTIVE'S MUSTER ROOM". Bucky, wearing his

best SPORTS COAT AND SLACKS, pushes through the door.

INSIDE THE MUSTER ROOM

Full of the LAPD's plainclothes hotshots. All stand and give

Bucky a standing ovation. Lee's there, too, playing to the

crowd.

On the blackboard at the front of the room: 8%!!!

CAPTAIN JACK TIERNEY is at the podium.

Everyone laughs. Tierney raps the podium and speaks again.

Tierney begins the summary as Bucky's eyes wander around the

room, taking in his new surroundings... Older men, coats and

ties... He tunes back in...

FRITZ VOGEL AND BILL KOENIG, both hulking and unpleasant-

looking (Fritzie being the elder version of his son Johnny).

The two men shake their heads "no". Tierney disapproves.

INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER

The meeting's breaking up. A tall, elegant man (RUSS MILLARD)

and a squat disheveled man (HARRY SEARS) approach Bucky.

Bucky smiles a dumb smile, not knowing what to say.

Before Bucky can answer ELLIS LOEW grabs him by the elbow and

leads him away.

When he gets him out of ear shot:

Bucky's about to respond when Lee saves him--

He grabs Bucky and they head out the door.

INT. LEE'S CAR - LATER

Lee cruises them through downtown, rambling about the job

description.

He pulls the car into a parking lot of a Mexican restaurant.

INSIDE THE RESTAURANT

Lee and Bucky slide into a booth on either side of BRUNO

ALBANESE, halfway through plate of huevos rancheros.

Lee slides the Maynard Coleman mug shot to Albanese.

Albanese burps.

Lee sighs. And then grabs Bruno by the back of the neck and

jams his face into the hot cheese and goo of his food.

Bruno's arms flap back and forth as Lee drowns him in his

food.

Finally Lee shrugs and pulls Bruno's face out of his food,

blood from his nose mixing with the grease of the enchiladas.

EXT. THE VERSAILLES APARTMENTS - MINUTES LATER

Lee and Bucky pull up and look for a parking spot just as

MAYNARD COLEMAN trots down the front stairs and gets into a

car.

They ease the car back into traffic and follow Coleman's car

from a safe distance. Bucky picks up the two-way radio. Lee

gestures for him to put it back:

Coleman's pulling into the parking lot of THE POLAR PALACE,

an ICE SKATING RINK. They follow.

Coleman exits his car, eyeing a group of kids carrying ice

skates and heading into the Polar Palace. He follows them

inside...

The two men follow...

INSIDE THE POLAR PALACE

Children skate around on the ice with a giant polar bear

suit. Lee and Bucky scan the area--not an adult in sight. Lee

spots some stairs leading to the restrooms and gestures to

Bucky, who hustles down them.

ON THE STAIRCASE

Maynard Coleman, carrying a stuffed bunny rabbit, walks up

the stairs toward Bucky. Just as the two men pass Bucky PULLS

HIS GUN and puts it to Coleman's head.

Coleman throws his hands in the air; the bunny drops to the

ground. Bucky cuffs Coleman and leads him up the stairs as

Lee comes down from above.

A small voice from below Bucky:

Bucky looks down to see A SMALL BOY pounding on his leg. The

kid's hysterical.

The resemblance is unmistakable. Two generations of Okie

white trash. Bucky continues marching Coleman the elder up

the stairs as Lee snags the kid, both the father and the son

crying like babies.

INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE JAIL - LATER

Lee and Bucky fill out a release form for the desk officer.

Bucky looks up to see BILL KOENIG and FRITZ VOGEL march by

with barely a nod.

INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - LATER

Lee finishes typing up a report on a manual typewriter while

Bucky talks on the phone. He hangs up as Fritz Vogel and Bill

Koenig return.

Bucky's POV: both Koenig and Vogel have small bits of

blood spattered on their white dress shirts.

The two men push by with barely a nod in Bucky's direction.

HARRY SEARS approaches their cubicle. He looks a little

drunk. (And when you get to know him you'll realize that when

he's drunk he doesn't stutter.)

The men nod thanks. Bucky notes the lack of stutter and the

presence of a liquor smell.

Lee bobs his head slightly as Harry moves off. He's disturbed

but covers quickly--

EXT. A BEAUTIFUL DECO HOME - NIGHT

Lee leads Bucky up the walk. Bucky's impressed with the house.

INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A doll's house of Danish Modern furniture, fresh flowers and

polished mahogany wainscoting.

Kay arrives from the kitchen, smiling broadly at Bucky. She

takes his hand.

And holds his hand about two beats than usual...

INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER

Kay brings in the food. Bucky walks around the room, checking

things out.

INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER

The food is finished. So is a bottle of champagne. Kay pops

another one, hitting Lee in the chest with the cork. Everyone

laughs hysterically. They fill the glasses again.

He's referring to all three of them--something which doesn't

escape or displease anyone. They clink glasses and drink.

ANOTHER LAPD TRIPLE CARBON INCIDENT REPORT:

JANUARY 10, 1947...Raymond "Junior" Nash...

INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING

Lee and Bucky enter the Loew's inner sanctum where they are

joined by Russ Millard and Harry Sears. A stack of L.A.

Heralds sit on the desk, the top one folded to the headline:

"Criminal Division's DA to try for Boss's Job in '48

Primary?"

Bucky's look of disgust says it all just as Loew walks into

the room--

Loew smiles thinly and hands over a photo and a rap sheet.

ANGLE ON THE MUG SHOT AND RAP SHEET:

RAYMOND "JUNIOR" NASH:  Statutory raps, armed robbery,

felony mayhem...Texas State Prison...Alcatraz...

The cops are impressed.

As they walk out...

Lee flashes a demon smile.

EXT. CRENSHAW BOULEVARD - DAY - LATER

A montage of shots as Lee and Bucky cruise south on Crenshaw

Boulevard. The beginning of the post-war boom.

On Crenshaw's northern end, once grand and now dilapidated

houses in the process of demolition, their faces replaced by

giant billboards advertising department stores, jumbo

shopping centers and movie theaters.

Southbound, older wooden structures looking more and more

unkempt. Empty lots...

EXT./INT. THE CAR - A FILLING STATION - CONTINUOUS

Lee pulls the car into the parking lot. Jumping out of the

car--

He heads to a payphone and beings pumping coins into it.

BACK IN THE CAR - MINUTES LATER

Lee gets back in the car. He's pale, sweating.

He pulls out.

EXT./INT. THE CAR - HOOVER AVE - MINUTES LATER

Lee and Bucky roll up on four men loitering on a corner.

Three are black and one is white.

As Lee and Bucky exit the car, the four men immediately start

the slow walk to the wall, arms over their heads. The white

guy glances at Lee:

Lee pushes him closer to the wall and starts frisking him.

Bucky starts with one of the other men, pulling out some

marijuana cigarettes.

Out of the corner of his eye, Bucky sees the black man

closest to Lee reaches for something shiny in his belt--

Bucky pulls his .38...

THE WHITE GUY swings around and LEE SHOOTS HIM twice in the

face--

THE FIRST BLACK MAN pulls a SHIV free and BUCKY SHOOTS HIM in

the neck--

ANOTHER OF THE MEN goes for his trousers, fumbling for

something as BUCKY SHOOTS HIM THREE TIMES.

Bucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of Lee and

the last man drawing guns on each other--Lee's three shots

cutting down the man before he can fire his tiny derringer.

Bucky pulls himself to his feet, stumbling past the blood-

covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter.

FROM THE DISTANCE: THE SOUND OF SIRENS.

Bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket.

Behind him, Lee is busy turning the dead men's pockets inside

out--scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from

the blood.

All the while Lee cries like a baby.

INT. THE 77TH ST. DETECTIVES' STATION - LATER

Bucky and a Detective exit a de-briefing room. Bucky looks

worn but composed.

They pass another de-briefing area where Lee sits with

another Detective. Lee looks terrible, muttering and

shivering.

The detective nods sympathetically.

EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Lee and Bucky walk up the front steps where they're met by

Kay. She runs to Lee and embraces him.

She escorts him into the house. Bucky sees a newspaper on the

front porch railing. The evening edition of The Mirror.

"Boxer Cops in Gun Battle. Four Crooks Dead."

Publicity boxing photos accompany a full-page article. Bucky

begins to read it when he hears from inside:

A door slam. Soon after the sound of Lee's motorcycle roaring

off... After a beat Kay comes outside and sits down next to

Bucky.

She nods.

She nods again.

Kay gives him a look: that's what you think. She gets up and

goes inside. Not knowing what to do, Bucky continues reading

the paper.

INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - LATER

Bucky wanders inside, obviously fidgety and not wanting to go

home. He putters around their living room. From the back of

the house Bucky hears the sound of A SHOWER RUNNING.

Bucky walks back to the bathroom, drawn there by the sound of

the drumming water. The bathroom door is open, an invitation.

He stops at the threshold of the bathroom. His POV:

Kay stands in the shower, curtain open for Bucky's benefit.

She faces him and he takes in the view of her nakedness.

Her attitude is not one of seduction, however, her expression

passive and fixed even when their eyes meet. She pirouettes

for him, showing:

A SERIES OF OLD KNIFE SCARS CRISS-CROSSING HER BACK FROM

THIGH TO SPINE.

The history of Bobby DeWitt.

Bucky backs away, retreating as he chokes back tears.

INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Bucky's awakened by the phone ringing. He pulls the receiver

off the cradle but leaves it on the nightstand. From the

receiver he barely hears:

Bucky grabs the phone.

EXT. THE CORNER OF COLISEUM AND NORTON - SOON AFTER

Bucky and Lee pull up to a mangy apartment building.

INT. RAYMOND NASH'S ROOM - SOON AFTER

They push the door open to reveal a filthy little flop

littered with muscatel short dogs and used rubbers.

They poke around for a minute, finding nothing. The smell is

awful. Bucky goes to a window and pulls it open.

HIS POV OUT THE WINDOW:

IN A VACANT LOT ACROSS THE WAY

A cluster of uniformed cops and men in civilian clothes stare

at something in the weeds. A CORONER'S VAN parks next to

three black and whites and two detectives' sedans.

Lee goes to the window.

An LAPD PHOTO VAN pulls up next.

Lee and Bucky sprint out of the room.

EXT. THE VACANT LOT - 39TH AND NORTON - SECONDS LATER

Photo men have already begun fanning out and taking photos.

Bucky sees Harry Sears take a shot from a hip flask in full

view of other officers. Lee and Bucky elbow their way to the

front and see:

The nude, mutilated body of a young woman, cut in half at the

waist. Another wide cut down her center reveal an empty

cavity--her organs have been removed.

Her face has been bashed in and her mouth cut ear to ear in a

leering smile.

Even the experienced cops are rattled by the scene. They

point and whisper and generally begin to fall into disbelief

and disorder when

RUSS MILLARD

whistles harshly with his fingers in his mouth.

The men all nod, coming together as Millard takes control.

Bucky indicates Lee, crouched down by the body taking notes.

Millard and Bucky look dawn the street to see cars swinging

onto Norton, beelining for the commotion. Reporters and

photographers begin pouring out of their cars, quickly coming

up against a line of cops keeping them from the body.

Bucky makes his way over to Lee, unable to stop staring at

the body.

EXT. THE CRIME SCENE - LATER

Too sheet-covered stretchers are shoved into the coroner's

wagon. The doors slam shut and the car pulls away.

RUSS MILLARD DIVIDING A STREET ATLAS INTO FOOTBEATS

as fifteen officers (including Lee and Bucky) wait for their

assignment.

A MONTAGE OF QUESTIONING

Cops ring doorbells throughout Leimert Park:

To all of these questions a big fat "no".

INT. THE OLYMPIC BOXING ARENA - NIGHHT

Bucky watches two Mexican bantamweights beat each other

bloody. An EMPTY SEAT next to him. Irritated, he gets up and

leaves.

ENT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER

Bucky gets out of his car and finds Lee standing inside the

crime scene rope watching lab techs poke around in the weeds.

The entire area is lit up by arclights, illuminating the two

quicklime outlines of the body parts.

Lee points to the body outline. His hand shakes a bit and

maybe for the first time we sense he's wired on something.

Bucky shakes his head and begins walking away.

INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY

Bucky enters a mob scene. One cop holds up a front page

headline: "Hunt Werewolf's Den in Torture Slaying"

Along a bench, five derelict-looking men are manacled to a

bench. A cop walks by, notes Bucky's confusion:

Just then the interrogation room door opens and Bill Koenig

leads a doubled-over fat man out of the door.

A couple officers clap satirically at their desks.

Off Bucky's concerned look we

INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING

Bucky walks in to see Loew holding a press conference, Lee

dressed in a suit and sitting at his side.

ON BUCKY'S FACE

Disbelief. Disgust.

BACK IN THE WARRANTS CUBICLE - LATER

Lee catches up with a pissed off Bucky.

Bucky's face says he's not sold on Lee's reasoning.

Bucky studies Lee's resolve; he relents.

INT. PATHOLOGY ROOM - LATER

Antiseptic white with metallic slab tables. Two objects

covered in sheets lay on the table.

Bucky, Lee, Russ Millard and Harry Sears sit on benches

facing the table. THE CORONER and a STENOGRAPHER NUN stand

over the body. The coroner pulls the sheets off.

The nun scribbles furiously to keep up. The officers are torn

between staring at their shoes and at the body.

The doctor stops to allow the nun time to catch up. Russ

Millard clears his throat.

Both Russ and Harry light up.

The door opens and a police officer enters, handing a sheet

of paper to Millard and speaking to him briefly. Millard

reads the sheet and hands it to Harry, who then hands it to

Lee.

He hands it to Bucky.

The note: "Girl ID'd as Elizabeth Ann Short, DOB

7/29/24, Medford, Mass."

The coroner steps back from the table.

The cops look to each other, hesitant to speak her name.

INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - LATER

Jack Tierney posts mug shots of Elizabeth Short as Russ,

Harry, Lee and Bucky look over his shoulder. (In the

background we can hear the by-now constant droning of Ellis

Loew to reporters, both in person and over the phone)

Russ makes a noise of disgust.

Reveal Loew with Koenig and Fritz Vogel behind him.

Loew flushes and gives Millard a dark look.

Tierney looks to Millard. The second in command shakes his

head ever so slightly. We understand that even though he's

second in command to Jack he's in charge.

EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DUSK

A garage apartment at the rear of a big Victorian house. Lee

and Bucky amble up and ring the buzzer.

A skinny man (CLEO SHORT) in his fifties opens the door,

eyeing them narrowly.

He leads them inside. The apartment resembles its resident,

soiled, worn and ugly.

The two cops sit down, sizing up his hostility.

The cops look around at the squalor.

The old man lets out a hoot.

Lee's about to burst. Bucky motions for him to take a walk.

Lee goes through the den into the bathroom. From his view

Bucky can see Lee chase a couple pills with a glass of

water...

Lee returns to the room.

EXT. CLEO SHORT'S APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER

The two men walk out, disgusted.

INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bucky opens the front door to find Kay reading a book on the

couch. She doesn't even look up.

Bucky appreciates her subtext.

She says this as fact, not judgement. She knows him.

Kay smiles, sweeps her arms around the perfect living room as

if to reinforce to Bucky all Lee's done for her.

The point is not lost on him.

She crosses to him and kisses him softly on the cheek.

INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Bucky sits at their kitchen table, eating a ham sandwich with

a glass of milk and filling out the police reports.

INT. THE HOMICIDE BULLPEN - MORNING

Bucky walks in reading the Herald front page: A picture of

Elizabeth Short in a striking black dress. Underneath:"The

Black Dahlia".

He stops at a room where two detectives are sorting through

a steamer trunk full of letters and assorted personal effects.

Bucky shows him the newspaper.

Millard gestures for him to leave.

EXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - LATER

Bucky and Koenig walk up to the steps of an apartment house.

Bucky checks names on the doorbells against a couple names on

his piece of paper. He stops at "S. Saddon".

INT. THE HALLWAY UPSTAIRS - LATER

Bucky knocks on the door.

A young woman dressed in a metallic Egyptian costume opens

the door.

The woman shuts the door. Seconds later the TOILET FLUSHES.

She returns and opens it again.

She lets him in and sits defiantly.

A CAR HORN HONKS. Bucky walks to the window and looks

outside: A FLATBED TRUCK FULL OF CLEOPATRAS waits.

But she's already gone.

INT. THE CAR - MOVING - HOLLYWOOD - CONTINUOUS

They cruise to the next address.

Bucky just stares at him; the guy's an idiot.

EXT./INT. DELONGPRE APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Two men lounge on the stoop. Koenig gives them the eye as he

passes.

Bucky checks his piece of paper against the doorbells again.

Finds "M. Graham" but no Linda Martin.

Koenig goes running outside. Bucky shakes his head.

INT. A COMMUNAL SITTING ROOM - LATER

Marjorie Graham sits on a couch with a dog-eared back issue

of Photoplay in her hands. She's mild but well-traveled.

Marjorie looks down, fidgeting.

Marjorie nods yes.

Bucky's about to press her for more when Bill Koenig barges

in, all sweaty.

Bucky looks at Marjorie. Back to Koenig.

Bill disappears back to the porch.

INT. LINDA MARTIN'S ROOM - LATER

Bucky pushes open the room and finds it empty. He checks the

closet. Empty.

Bucky runs his hand under the bed. Finds something and pulls

it out. A small red vinyl purse. He opens the purse. Inside

is an ID. He shows it to Marjorie.

EXT. THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - LATER

Bucky emerges. Koenig stands on the stoop with the two men,

both of whom look like they might have seen the wrong end of

Koenig's less-than-subtle interrogation style.

INT. AN ANONYMOUS CASTING OFFICE - DAY

Clapsticks come down in front of the camera: "Elizabeth

Short...Screen Test #1."

Elizabeth Short sits on a tiny chair in a cheap office. She's

dressed for an audition, overly made up and nervous.

She nods, can't relax.

FADE OUT.

INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - LATER

Bucky fills out forms.

EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Bucky pulls up in front of the house. Heads inside...

CLOSE-UPS OF BLACK DAHLIA CRIME SCENE PHOTOS

spread out on Lee and Kay's dining room table.

Bucky stands just inside the door watching Lee study the

photos, Kay a pace or two back, smoking nervously. Neither of

them seem to notice him. Finally Kay sees him:

CLOSE ON: Lee's face, somehow both intense and unfocused...

BACK ON: BUCKY, who turns on his heels and exits, catching

Kay's eye as he goes.

EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - DUSK - LATER

Bucky cruises by the crime scene. Rubberneckers gawk around

the vacant lot while vendors peddle greasy food and cheap

portrait glossies of the Dahlia in a black dress.

INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - BUCKY'S DESK - NIGHT

Bucky sits at his desk staring at RAYMOND NASH'S MUGSHOT.

HIS EYES DRIFT TO:

A WAGER POOL SIGN-UP LIST POSTED ON THE WALL: a crude felt

craps table with various betting spaces: "Solved--2 to 1",

"Random Sex Job--4 to 1", "Uhsolved--Even Money",

"Boyfriend(s)--l to 4"...

Next to it are TWO HALVES OF A BLACK DRESS on separate

hangers...a crude joke.

Bucky opens up his desk drawer and drops the Nash mugshot

inside. He dials the phone:

EXT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - THE VALLEY - NIGHT

Bucky pulls his car up to a low-slung building with a log-

cabin facade and swinging Western doors. He enters.

INT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

A dimly lit LESBIAN BAR. Butch women in GI khakis mix with

soft girls in cashmere skirt suits.

Bucky approaches a bartender. The woman sizes him up and

slides him a whiskey.

Bucky slides her a photo of the Dahlia and Linda Martin's ID.

INT. THE BAR - SOON AFTER

as the photos are passed from patron to patron. Aside from a

few raised eyebrows over the Dahlia, nothing to indicate

anyone knows anything.

INT. A DIFFERENT LESBIAN BAR - LATER

This time an Olde English motif. Bucky sips another free

whiskey as a dozen more women pass the photos around. Bucky

watches their reactions closely but doesn't see anything out

of the ordinary.

He takes another shot of whiskey and heads out the door.

INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEWAY - LATER

A tropical motif. Faux bamboo wrap-around booths shield women

snuggled deep into the dark corners.

A bit buzzed and embarrassed to have to go booth to booth and

break up couples, Bucky slowly makes his way around the bar

with the two photos. More of the same...

He approaches a woman polishing glasses at the bar. Slides

over the photos.

He taps a finger onto Linda Martin's ID.

The bartender picks up the card and squints at it. Bucky sees

a flicker of recognition in her eyes. She hesitates--

He leans over the counter.

The bartender looks again at the ID card.

Out of his peripheral vision Bucky sees another woman just

starting to sit down on a bar stool but at the last minute,

change her mind and make for the door.

A baby spotlight catches her face; a fleeting resemblance to

Elizabeth Short.

Bucky takes a deep breath, counts to ten and then goes out

after the woman.

EXT. THE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

The woman gets into a beautiful snow-white Packard.

SHOTS OF VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

as Bucky tails the white Packard from three car-lengths back.

He follows her all the way from the Valley to Hancock Park.

EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - NIGHT

As the woman parks her car in front of A HUGE TUDOR MANSION,

Bucky cruises by, catching her license plate and writing it

on a pack of matches from LaVerne's.

In his rear view mirror he sees her exit the car, a striking

figure in a sharkskin suit. He watches her walk up the

enormous lawn and into the home.

EXT. A PAY PHONE - MINUTES LATER

Bucky reads the license plate into the phone. He receives

information back and writes it onto the matchbook, as well.

INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bucky lies in his bed, staring at the ceiling. His bedside

light reveals a still life: Elizabeth Short's mug shot photo

tucked underneath the matchbook. The cover is flipped open

and we can see written: "Madeleine Cathcart Sprague".

INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MORNING

Bucky's listening to The Dexter Gordon quartet on the radio

when the tune is interrupted by a feverish voice:

Bucky takes a quick left down another street.

INT. HOLLENBACK STATION JAIL - LATER

Bucky runs into Lee as he enters the station.

INT. OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - CONT.

Seems like every cop in town has jammed themselves into a

small corridor, watching Russ Millard interrogate RED MANLEY

through a one way mirror. Manley is carrot-topped, 25, and

scared shitless.

Millard's soothing voice can be heard through speakers.

All of the cops outside laugh.

Millard straightens up and turns to the one-way mirror. He

tugs at the knot of his tie. Soon after he slips out of the

room and Harry Sears slips in.

Bucky turns to Lee.

INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

Harry circles Red Manley, lightly tapping a metal-studded sap

in his hand.

BACK INSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

Harry leans close to Red, tapping the sap on the table. His

stutter completely gone.

Harry SMASHES the sap onto a glass ashtray, shattering it.

Red bites down on his lip, cutting it.

Harry SMASHES the table again.

Again Harry smashes the table. Red almost topples his chair

backwards out of fear, only Harry's hand an the back slats

keeping it from going over...

Smash!

Harry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls

the whole thing over onto its side.

Red fumbles out of the chair onto his knees. He clasps his

hands together--

He begins to weep. Completely broken.

Harry turns to the one way mirror, looking straight out at

his audience: self-loathing etched into his flabby,

juicehound face.

He gives the thumbs-down sign and walks out of the room.

OUTSIDE IN THE HALLWAY

Russ Millard meets him at the door and leads him away from

the general crowd of officers.

BACK IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM

Bucky watches as Lee and another officer handcuff Red and

take him outside. Lee has his hand on Red's shoulder like a

kindly uncle.

OUTSIDE THE STATION

Bucky stands on the steps, taking fresh air. Russ steps out.

He pats Bucky on the shoulder and walks inside.

BUCKY CANVASSING THE WILSHIRE DISTRICT

Restaurants, bars, juke joints. Bucky interviews every drunk

on Western and Normandie...

Bucky cruises in his car into Lee and Kay's neighborhood.

IN FRONT OF LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bucky pulls up just as Kay storms out the door and down the

steps, hurling an armful of paper onto the lawn. Lee storms

beside her, shouting and waving his arms as they go back

inside.

Bucky walks over and kneels down besides the papers: carbons

of LAPD report forms, tip sheets, evidence tickets, the

autopsy...all with "E. Short" typed at the top.

Kay and Lee come back out again, Kay tossing out more files.

Bucky stops himself short, studying Lee's strained face.

She turns on them both and goes back inside. Before Lee can

make a wisecrack Bucky kicks his way through the LAPD papers

back to his car...

INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT

Bucky sits low in his car, watching THE WHITE PACKARD parked

near the front of LaVerne's. He's been there awhile...

Finally the woman from the night before exits and heads for

her car. He jumps out and walks quickly to intercept her

while she's fumbling for her keys.

She sighs, exasperated.

She pulls a wad of cash out of her purse. Switching to a very

deft imitation of a Scotchman's burr:

She peels off another bill. Hands it to Bucky. He counts it

out. Over a hundred dollars.

He hands the money back.

All of her bravado drops. Bucky sees it immediately. He grabs

her purse and keys and tosses them on the hood of her car.

She opens the door to her car and slides in. Bucky gets in

next to her. By the roof light he can see that her similarity

to the Dahlia is more in her clothes and hair, but the

resemblance is still there nonetheless.

Bucky's charmed by her, but stays focused.

She turns in the seat to face him directly.

She touches his leg.

He knows exactly what she's saying.

He starts to get out of the car.

He pulls the purse off the hood and tosses her the keys. As

he walks away he lets out a deep breath, as if he'd been

holding it the whole time...

INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY

Bucky enters and finds Lee at a desk, manning the tip phones.

Lee dutifully writes down the crank on a routing slip. Bucky

slides into a chair across from him, brushing imaginary dust

off of the phone in front of him.

Lee rings off. Smiles at Bucky.

Lee swings away in his rotating chair, knocking over a

wastepaper basket.

The phone in front of Lee rings. He snatches it--

Lee listens to the call, not saying anything. It goes on for

some time. Finally Bucky catches Lee's eye. Lee makes the

"looney" sign with his finger.

Bucky's phone rings. He picks it up.

The person on the other line starts rambling on. Bucky takes

notes diligently as we

INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - LATER

Bucky's on another call. His pile of tip sheets and routing

slips have grown. Behind him Lee pulls on his jacket and

gives Bucky a two-fingered salute as he saunters out.

A CLOSE UP OF THE BETTING POOL TABLE

as Bucky drops twenty dollars on "Unsolved - pay 2 to 1".

INT. ANOTHER CASTING OFFICE - DAY

Elizabeth Short in another dress, her hair fixed differently.

Clapsticks come in again: "Elizabeth Short...Screen Test

#2"

FADE OUT

EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT

Bucky rings the bell dressed in his Sunday best blazer.

Madeleine answers, a knockout in a skirt and cashmere sweater.

She leads him inside.

INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Thick Persian carpets, tapestries, giant rooms with a men's

club atmosphere.

Next to the fireplace Bucky notices A STUFFED SPANIEL with a

yellowed newspaper rolled into its mouth.

INT. A SMALL SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Sprague family sits in matching easy chairs. No one

stands up.

Emmett Sprague jumps to his feet, pumping Bucky's hand.

Both Martha and Ramona stand up. Martha is 19, plain and

serious, with a tenacious resemblance to Emmett. (Neither of

whom look much like Madeleine.)

Ramona, on the other hand, possesses a pushing-fifty

resemblance to Madeleine combined with the flaccid face and

unfocused features of a booze or drug addict.

INT. THE DINING ROOOM - LATER

A black maid serves large portions of corned beef and cabbage.

Bucky smiles politely and begins eating.

On Emmett's nod Martha pulls out a small sketch pad.

A wince from Martha.

A SCREECH interrupts Emmett's monologue. Bucky looks across

the table to see Ramona trying to corral a potato with her

fork (the source of the sound).

Ramona forks a small bit of food and chews it daintily.

Emmett Sprague SLAMS the table. Plates rattle. Silence. Bucky

stares into his lap as Madeleine grabs his knee tightly.

She struggles to her feet and leaves the room. Her husband

follows.

Martha tears a piece of paper out of her sketch pad. Bucky

takes it as she walks away.

ANGLE ON THE SKETCH:

A caricature of a naked Bucky having sex with Madeleine.

EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

A cinderblock auto court filled with pre-war jalopies. The

camera closes on a dingy door. Room 11.

INT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME

A single yellow light illuminates the dreary flop as Bucky

and Madeleine fuck on the bed.

Bucky grabs her hair--

Focusing, Madeleine pins Bucky with her knees and pulls him

deep into her until they're no longer common policeman and

rich girl slut. They're one.

INT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME

They hold each other, sweaty and spent.

She looks at him earnestly.

He strokes her dark hair.

An awkward silence as she considers her foot in her mouth. He

studies her for a moment. Pulls her close, kisses her

mouth...the arch of her neck...They begin to move together

again...

Another LAPD FORM: "Witness Report: Lorna

Martikova...aka Linda Martin..."

EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MOVING

Bucky weaves fast through traffic. He whips a right turn...

EXT. THE CALEDONIA LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

Bucky's car screeches into the parking lot just as LINDA

MARTIN bursts through the doors and takes off running.

Bucky jumps from the car and sprints after her, the girl

clutching an oversized purse to her chest as she dashes in

and out of busy traffic.

The girl runs like a fucking antelope as Bucky barely misses

being hit by a large BEER TRUCK and gets to the other side of

the street just as Linda stumbles over a curb--sending her

sprawling on the sidewalk.

Bucky jumps on her, grabbing her tiny fists as she kicks and

screams like a hell cat.

He cuffs her and pulls her up, dragging her to where she

spilled her purse.

He picks it up her purse. Surprised by the heft, he opens it

and pulls out A METAL FILM CAN.

Her demeanor changes instantly to fear:

INT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

Russ, Harry and Bucky sit opposite Linda Martin. She's pretty

and small, and about to get smaller...

The girl thinks hard, shakes her head "no".

Her eyes go to the floor, tears begin to drop.

She nods her head silently.

Harry pours her a paper cup of water. She takes a sip.

She takes a large gulp of water.

Her head bowed. Russ and Harry stare at her impassively.

She nods yes.

She raises her head in recognition and nods yes.

She shakes her head "no".

Linda looks sadly at Bucky.

She looks down again. The cops look at each other. Linda's

harder and more desperate than they imagined.

Now its the cops turn to look away.

EXT. THE HALLWAY - AFTER

Russ and Bucky.

INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER

A projector and screen has been set up. All the big-wigs are

present: Ellis Loew, Jack Tierney, Thad Green and Chief of

Police C.B. Horrall. Millard, Harry and Lee.

A clerical assistant threads the projector as Bucky settles

into a seat next to Lee. On Lee's lap is a newspaper with the

headline: "Boulevard-Citizen's Mastermind to be Released

--LA Bound after 8 years of Custody"

Bucky's about to respond when the lights dim and a blurred

image hits the screen. It begins to focus.

A title: "Slave Girls From Hell"

The movie: A big high-ceiling room with Egyptian

hieroglyphics on the walls. Pillars shaped like coiled

serpents are stationed throughout the room; the camera zooms

in for a close-up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each

other's tails. The snakes dissolve into Betty Short, wearing

only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance...

An audible breath in the muster room.

A hand reaches into frame, passing Betty a large cylindrical

object: a dildo, scales covering the shaft, fangs extending

from the circumcised head. Betty puts it in her mouth, sucks

it, eyes wide open and glassy.

An abrupt cut: Linda Martin, naked, lying on a divan. Betty

enters the frame with the dildo; she puts it between Linda's

legs, pushing it inside her. Linda rotates her hips, trying

her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness.

Another cut: Betty mouthing the words "No, please" to the

camera. A hand pushing her head down towards Linda's crotch.

Betty tonguing next to the dildo...

BACK ON THE MUSTER ROOM

The atmosphere is somber, but calm. The film continues...

Suddenly Lee jumps up, standing in front of the screen.

He yanks down the screen with a crash and storms out of the

room. The movie continues on the chalked up blackboard.

INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER

Lee sits on the ground, head in his hands. Bucky enters and

sits on a bench next to him.

Bucky notices Lee's still clutching the De Witt article in

his fist. He pries it loose.

Ellis Loew and Russ Millard enter.

Poison hangs in the air. Ellis turns on his heels.

INT. THE SQUADRON - DAY

Bucky sits in his cubicle searching the Dahlia files. The

clock behind him reads "12:30". Loew approaches.

Loew walks off. Bucky dials the phone.

She hangs up.

INT. RED ARROW MOTEL - ROOM 11 - LATER

They lie naked in the bed. Bucky's lost in thought.

He looks anything but.

Madeleine sits up.

She runs her fingers down his ribcage, teasing his boxing

scars.

He jumps from the bed and pulls on his pants.

He pulls on his shirt, his handcuffs and his .38. Grabs his

jacket--

--and slams the door on the way out.

INT. THE POLICE CRUISER - LATER

Bucky steamed in the car. He flips on the police radio,

looking for distraction. Instead he gets:

EXT. A KOREAN GROCERY - MINUTES LATER

RAYMOND NASH lies dead on the sidewalk. Off to one side, a

short and wiry cop is describing for detectives how it all

went down, pantomiming how he shot an escaping Raymond Nash.

Bucky stands over Nash, staring at his dead features. He

walks inside.

INT. A KOREAN GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

Bucky's POV:

A robbery gone bad. A sixty-year old Korean shopowner lies

dead behind the counter and his teenaged son lies dead in an

aisle. Blood and green linoleum.

INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - SOON AFTER

Bucky bursts into the squad room, seeing red.

A cop walking through the bullpen points to the bathroom.

INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bucky kicks in the door, finding Lee washing his hands in the

sink. He holds his hands up to Bucky, blood oozes from Lee's

knuckles.

Bucky steps into Lee with fists flying, a mad demon. He

smashes him again and again, beating his only friend until

Lee slides senseless to the floor...

INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bucky drinks bourbon straight, his wrist heavily bandaged.

EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NEXT DAY

Bucky walks into the house and finds Kay there. She holds up

a newspaper: The front page includes The Black Dahlia, Junior

Nash, and Bobby De Witt.

Bucky looks ashamed.

He walks to her and she holds him.

She nods. He strokes her hair.

She holds up a hand, waving him off. She knows all this.

She knows him to the core. She steps back, holding his hands.

INT. POLICE STATION - BUCKY'S CUBICLE - LATER

Bucky's on the phone.

He rings off looking very disturbed as Russ and Harry arrive.

Bucky exhales hard.

EXT. TIJUANA - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAWN

Bucky cruises the Tijuana streets: child beggars dig for

breakfast in trash cans, taco venders stir pots of dog-meat

stew, sailors and marines stumble out of whorehouses. Rurales

drive prewar Chevys wearing black uniforms...

Bucky parks at a big pink Art Deco hotel (The Divisidero).

INT. THE DIVISIDERO - CONTINUOUS

Bucky badges the desk clerk and gets a room number. He heads

upstairs.

INT. A DIVISIDERO HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ellis Loew, Fritz Vogel, and Bill Koenig arguing.

Bucky opens the door and the room falls quiet.

Bucky charges the DA but Vogel and Koenig intercept him,

pushing him roughly back out in the hall. Loew retreats to

the other side of the room.

EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS

Bucky and Fritz Vogel drive past beggars swarming tourists,

hookers dispensing front seat blow jobs, zoot suit youths

prowling for drunks to roll...

EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS

The two men park the car in the middle of a car-choked street

and decide to try walking. They're immediately swallowed up

by kid beggars shoving crucifixes in their faces.

Bucky tosses handfuls of coins into the gutters and the

children scatter, squabbling over the coins.

IN THE BACKGROUND

Fritz Vogel approaches a Rurale and talks to him. The Rurale

nods yes, gesturing down an alley to a squat cinderblock

building.

INT. A FILTHY MEXICAN JAIL - SOON AFTER

Vogel and Bucky walk quickly down a corridor lined with empty

cells. A Mexican jailer unlocks the last cell and the two

cops walk in to face

BOBBY DEWITT

the hatchet-faced tough of 1939 now a grizzled and bloated

well-used piece of work. He stands up, full of con bravado.

Vogel kicks in the balls, dropping him to his knees. Vogel

smashes him with a thick backhand across the face.

BUCKY HANDCUFFING BOBBY DEWITT TO A CHAIR

Vogel stands over him.

DeWitt pisses his pants.

Vogel smashes him across the face.

DeWitt's head bobs up and down.

Vogel topples DeWitt with a right hook and then picks him

back up by the neck, squeezing the life out of him.

He lets go of his neck, the color returning to DeWitt's face.

Vogel claps his hands together, gleeful with this bonus bust.

Bucky turns back to De Witt, who's much more relaxed now that

Vogel's left the cell.

IN SLOW MOTION--

Bucky leaps on De Witt, grabbing him around the neck and

choking him. De Witt turns blue, his eyes bulging out--

BEHIND BUCKY, VOICES IN SPANISH

and then hands on his shoulders as Ducky is hurled backwards

into the cell bars. And then

BLACKNESS

which slowly becomes grey, and then back to normal as Bucky

finds himself awakening on the floor of the cell.

Refocusing on the scene:

Two Rurales in jodhpur boots pick their teeth with

matchsticks as Fritz Vogel pulls Bucky to his feet.

A STUDEBAKER PATROL CAR WITH LIGHTS FLASHING

INSIDE THE STUDEBAKER

Vogel, Koenig, a Rurale, and Bucky (holding a piece of ice to

the back of his head).

The car arrives at a horseshoe-shaped auto court. Two Mexican

policeman stand guard outside one of its rooms.

INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER

As the American cops walk in on a cordite-reeking

slaughterhouse. Bobby De Witt and a Mexican man lay dead on

the floor, bullet holes oozing blood all over them.

Bucky notes the bruises on De Witt's neck from where he

choked him. Bucky squints at the men, still a little

disoriented...

INT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - DAY

Kay sits curled into a corner of the couch, defensively.

Bucky sits on a small chair next to Lee's large easy chair.

She nods, mollifying him.

A NEON SIGN: THE EL NIDO MOTEL

CLOSE ON: ROOM 204

as Bucky jimmies the lock and pushes open the door.

INSIDE ROOM 204

Boxes of police falls scattered on the bed and desk. Photos

of Elizabeth Short pinned up all over the walls: glamour

glossies, newspaper photos, enlarged crime scene

grotesquerie.

The amount of manpower represented here is staggering; so

much work over one girl.

Bucky sits down at the desk and buries his head in his hands.

CLOSE ON: A PORTRAIT PHOTO OF ELIZABETH SHORT

FRITZ VOGEL AND BUCKY

interviewing a fortysomething TALENT AGENT in a slick suit.

He sits at a desk with yellowed starlets' headshots behind

him. Vogel leans on the desk, intimidating the man.

ROOM 204 -- THE EL NIDO

Russ Millard and Harry Sears stand goggle-eyed as Bucky shows

them Lee's back-up files...

RUSS MILLARD

meticulously sifting through the material along with Bucky.

A PHOTO OF ELIZABETH SHORT DRESSED IN BLACK

AN AUTOPSY PHOTO OF ELIZABETH SHORT

39TH ANMD NORTON - THE MURDER SCENE

where Bucky stands in the empty lot, alone.

FOOTAGE FROM BETTY AND LINDA'S PORN FILM

as the camera dances across Betty Short's naked body. WE

CLOSE IN on her, the 16mm film becoming finer and finer as

the sex scene transforms into

A LIVE SHOT OF BETTY SHORT, writhing in ecstasy underneath a

man. She and the man fuck harder and harder, faster and

faster.

BUCKY'S FACE

groaning with the ecstasy of ejaculation--

BACK ON BETTY SHORT BENEATH HIM-

but it's not Betty Short. It's Madeleine Sprague, staring up

at Bucky as the two of them come simultaneously.

As soon as it's over, she looks for his eyes. He won't look

at her. She grabs his chin and turns him face to face.

He lower his face to the pillow...

INT. ANOTHER CASTING SESSION - DAY

Another clapstick: "Elizabeth Short...Screen test #3"

Elizabeth Short, looking a bit more worn down, holds a script

up to her face.

She stops, frustrated.

FADE OUT

CLOSE ON:

the "UNSOLVED" sheet at the LAPD betting pool. Handwritten

on the sheet are the constantly dropping odds: "2 to 1"

replaced by "3 to 2" which has been replaced by "Even

Money".

THE CAMERA PANS UP FROM THE BETTING SHEETS:

"TRANSFER NOTICE...As of 2/6/47 these officers

currently assigned to the Elizabeth Short

investigation will return to their regular duties...

WIDE ON THE SCENE

as Bucky reads the list. Unfortunately his name is not on it.

He beelines straight to

RUSS MILLARD'S OFFICE

the quiet man looks up from his desk.

Bucky smiles weakly; Russ knows him.

Russ smiles grimly.

EXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

Bucky rings the doorbell. Fritz Vogel answers.

He claps Bucky on the shoulder and leads him into the house.

INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The interior decorating equivalent of highballs and pretzels,

which is exactly what Vogel, Bucky and Ellis Loew are

consuming. Bucky drinks with the trepidation of the King's

food taster.

Bucky looks impatient and Ellis senses this.

Bucky considers the truth in this. To Loew:

EXT. THE CITY JAIL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

as four manacled men are being loaded into a drunk wagon

while Bucky flips through their rap sheets and mug shots.

INSIDE THE DRUNK WAGON

the four men sit in the back as Bucky drives the truck. The

camera pans their faces. The first, LOREN BIDWELL, pale, old

and palsied.

EXT. AN OLD WAREHOUSE BUILDING

Bucky pulls the drunk wagon up to a building, its street

facade illuminated: "KOUNTY KING LUNCH MEAT--SERVING L.A.

COUNTY WITH INSTITUTIONAL FOOD SINCE 1923"...

THE CAMERA finds the second man, CECIL DURKIN.

AT THE FRONT OF THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING

Fritz Vogel opens the door and leads the men inside.

INT. THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

A huge sawdust-covered roam, meathooks dangling from the

ceiling. Beef dangles over half the hooks. The four men look

terrified.

The camera finds the third man, CHARLIE ISSLER:

And the fourth man, PAUL ORCHARD:

The group reaches a back wall of the warehouse where FOUR

UNUSED MEATHOOKS DANGLE OVER FOUR CHAIRS.

Bucky studies the men's apprehensive faces as Vogel stands

each one on a chair with their manacled hands hooked over

their respective meathooks.

Bucky's gaze drifts back behind a large box where he sees A

SHEET-COVERED TABLE sticking out. Before his curiosity draws

him over Vogel addresses the prisoners.

Bucky takes a deep breath and heads first to old man Bidwell.

The man's palsy has him shaking and Bucky grabs the meathook

above him to steady him.

Bidwell looks at him with beseeching eyes.

Bucky's hand twitches on the meathook.

The man's weakened state makes his argument for him. Bucky

moves on to Cecil Durkin.

Bucky catches Vogel out of the corner of his eye. Measuring...

Bucky one-two's him in the solar plexus. His legs buckle, but

he keeps his feet on the chair.

This shuts Durkin up. Bucky moves to Charlie Issler.

Vogel struts over, putting on brass knuckles.

He kicks Issler's chair out from under him, the pimp

screaming as his wrists snap. Vogel kicks the remaining three

chairs out, punctuating each with a declaration:

The men scream like dying animals as Fritzie zeroes in on

Charlie Issler. He begins punching him in the gut with the

brass knuckles.

He punches him in the crotch.

Vogel ignores him, rabbit punching him, cracking one rib and

then another--

ON BUCKY'S FACE

knowing this is getting out of control. He's mesmerized by A

FIRE ALARM on the wall behind the men...

Issler retches, coughing up blood. Bucky stares at the fire

alarm as Fritz runs through his field of vision, cackling.

Bucky refocuses on the scene as Fritzie returns, wheeling the

sheet-covered table Bucky'd seen before. He whips off the

sheet revealing:

A NAKED FEMALE CORPSE, CUT IN TWO AND MADE UP TO LOOK LIKE

THE DAHLIA.

Vogel grabs Issler by the scruff of the neck and jerks him

down off of the meathook.

Issler bites through his lip as Fritzie pulls out a

switchblade and pops it open.

Bucky takes in the nightmare scene all in slow-motion, the

men with their broken wrists, the pudgy naked corpse, Fritzie

with the knife...

He runs for the fire alarm and pulls the lever, a piercing

bell ringing out as Bucky runs out of the warehouse and jumps

into the drunk wagon, tearing off into the night.

INT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kay answers the door and finds Bucky sitting on the front

porch, sobbing.

She moves to him, touching him on the back of the neck, the

stroke of her finger enough to make him stand and face her.

INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER

Bucky tries to talk but she puts fingers to his mouth. Mouth

to his fingers. She undresses him. Slowly she touches him,

easing him, bringing him back to earth, back to humanity. To

her.

And finally they are joined.

Patrol, Swingwatch. Central Station..."

EXT. SKID ROW - EVENING

Bucky picks his way through passed-out drunks and bums. He's

back in uniform.

DOWN THE STREET

two officers brutally herd winos into a drunk wagon. Bucky

turns and walks the other direction, refusing to help. They

see him and sneer.

He hands a quarter to a drunk as he passes, urging him with

his nightstick to crawl back into a bar.

INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

Russ Millard pores over a file in their private collection.

Bucky sits with his feet up on the bed, flipping through a

folder...

Bucky eyes a Dahlia photo pinned to the wall.

INT. THE RED ARROW MOTEL - NIGHT

Madeleine sits on the bed fully dressed. Bucky stands in the

doorway.

Bucky turns and leaves as we

INT. KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

where Kay and Bucky sleep in bed, locked as spoons. Safe.

INT. THE MEAT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT - A DREAM

Bucky watches Fritz Vogel beats the hell out of Charles

Issler as he hangs off the meathook. In the background, Betty

Short stands and screams:

Bucky turns and stares at her.

CLOSE ON BUCKY'S BLAZING EYES

INT. THE EL NIDO - SAME

as Bucky stares across the room at a picture of the Dahlia.

Millard sits at the small desk, waiting for him to come back.

Bucky finally sees Russ again.

A FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE

As Vogel cracks Issler's ribs.

INT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Harry Sears cradles the phone in his ear as he flips through

a large metal file cabinet. Behind him the glass door reads

in reverse: "ADMINISTRATIVE VICE'.

BACK AT THE EL NIDO - SAME

Bucky and Russ sit in silence, thinking. They know they're

onto something...

Bucky gets to his feet.

But Bucky's already out the door.

EXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bucky stakes out the dark house.

EXT. VOGEL'S SERVICE PORCH - LATER

Bucky slips an oil dipstick into the narrow crack of the back

door and flips the simple hook and eyehole lock. He slides

into the house...

INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

as Bucky creeps through the house until he gets to a closed

door. He opens it, entering

FRITZIE'S STUDY

He stumbles along the wall until he finds a standing

gooseneck lamp and turns it on. The walls are covered with

pictures of Fritzie in uniform, dating back twenty-five

years.

Bucky bends down in front of the small mahogany desk and

begins rifling through its file drawers. What he finds

surprises him:

--carbons of official LAPD intelligence reports, lists of

account balances, financial dealings, payments made--all

cross-referenced to each individual being investigated.

A veritable how-to primer on how to extort from criminals..

Bucky digs deeper into the files and pulls out:

ISSLER'S AD VICE FILE complete with mug shots.

Bucky scans the file, running his finger down the list of

names, looking for something familiar. He stops at one:

"SALLY STINSON". Beside her name a handwritten note:

"Biltmore Hotel".

He writes it down and moves to another list of names: "Known

Associates, no Prostitution Record".

And there it is: "Betty Short".

INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LATER

Bucky bops to jazz on his radio, pumped with adrenaline.

INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

Bucky tears through a file as Russ watches.

A FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE

as Fritz beats on Charlie--

BACK TO THE EL NIDO

Bucky reads through a letter.

INT. KAY'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Bucky lies awake while Kay sleeps.

A FLASHBACK - FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE

Ellis Loew, Fritz Vogel and Bucky drink cocktails and eat

pretzels...

Ellis and Fritz clink glasses...Smile at Bucky.

BACK IN KAY'S BED

Her hand brushes against his cheek. He reaches for it.

OVER THIS SCENE WE HEAR A PHONE RING AND THE FOLLOWING

EXCHANGE.

INT. THE POLICE STATION - SAME

As Bucky hangs up the phone. Trying to look casual he sidles

over to a desk with FRITZ VOGEL on the name plate and snags a

photo of Fritz and Johnny off the desk...

INT. SALLY STINSON'S APARTMENT - DAY

A worn woman in her early thirties (SALLY STINSON) sits on a

stack of luggage, Russ and Bucky in chairs. She wears a cheap

kimono and too much makeup for the middle of the day.

She holds the photo of the Vogels. Shakes out her hair and

closes her kimono a little.

She laughs a little, trying to loosen herself up.

Sally thinks...

Russ and Bucky glance at each other, remembering lashmarks at

the autopsy.

Her face clouds over.

She has a hard time going on.

She lifts her head. Taps her nails on the suitcases

underneath her.

A puzzled look covers her face.

She taps her finger on John Vogel's face.

Off Bucky and Russ' shock we

EXT./INT. RUSS MILLARD'S CAR - LATER

as they cruise the streets of skid row. While Russ talks

Bucky fills a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE with an amber liquid...

Bucky points out the window.

OUTSIDE ON THE SIDEWALK

Johnny Vogel wrestles with two drunks, kicking at them as

they scamper into some trash.

Johnny ambles over to Bucky.

Bucky drills him in the solar plexus, doubling him over. He

grabs Vogel by the hair and slams his head into the roof of

the car as Johnny's lights dIm...

THE BACKSEAT OF THE CAR - SECONDS LATER

as Russ Millard injects the needle into Johnny's arm.

INT. THE EL NIDO - DAY

Johnny Vogel handcuffed to a radiator, his head bobbing back

and forth. His eyes trying to focus on Russ and Bucky.

Johnny's eyes drift to the pictures on the walls.

Russ touches Bucky's arm, urging him to sit back.

Johnny turns the syllable into a long laugh.

Johnny thinks back, his head lolling to and fro...

Johnny jerks back spasmodically.

Johnny's starting to sweat. Russ and Bucky lean in...

Johnny nods yes.

Johnny starts laughing hysterically, shaking his chained hands

like a zoo animal trying to get loose. Russ steps in front of

a red-hot Bucky--

EXT. THE FIRE ESCAPE - LATER

Bucky sits out on the fire escape watching cars drive by.

Russ leans out the window and hands Bucky the statement.

Bucky reads it and slips it into his pocket.

Bucky shakes his head no, climbs back inside the window.

INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Bucky handcuffs Johnny's hands behind his back as the big man

cries...

He squeezes Johnny's handcuffs tighter.

INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - BOOKING - NIGHT

Reporters follow Bucky and Johnny inside, piqued by the sight

of a plainclothes officer escorting a cuffed uniform inside.

He approaches the desk sergeant.

A flashbulb goes off in their faces. Johnny sobs.

He hands over Johnny's signed statement.

Another flashbulb.

EXT. CENTRAL STATION - LATER

Bucky jogs up the steps inside.

INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER

He dresses in his blue uniform, preparing to go back to work.

Bucky brushes imaginary dust off his shirt and grabs his hat.

INT. LIEUTENANT JASTROW'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER

Bucky walks in, saluting like an idealistic rookie. Jastrow

stands, ignoring the salute.

All Bucky can think to do is salute again, rock firm. He

walks outside and crosses into

INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Crammed with blues awaiting roll call. They all stare at

Bucky; he meets the eyes that seek his, making them look

down. Defiant.

As he passes he can hear the hisses: "Traitor". "Bolshevik".

He continues towards the door, almost out when suddenly he

hears applause.

Bucky turns to see,Russ Millard, Harry Sears and Thad Green

clapping good-bye...

INT. THE CASTING OFFICE - DAY

Clapstick: "Elizabeth Short Screen Test #4"

She sits on an ugly brown sofa, sides in her hands. Silence.

She looks up, seeing the camera as if for the first time.

FADE OUT

EXT. THE SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT

Kay and Bucky sit on a bench, looking out at the water.

He looks at her and she knows it's useless.

She takes his hand.

EXT. THE SAN DIEGO FREEWAY - LATE MORNING

as Bucky crosses the border into Mexico.

EXT. TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Bucky hands out pennies and nickels to locals, flashing both

his badge and snapshots of Lee.

BUCKY AND AN ENTOURAGE OF TRAILING LOCALS

as Bucky tries to shake them, pulling out his pockets to show

them he has no more coins.

BUCKY QUESTIONING TIJUANA COPS

graduating from small change to one dollar bills. Same of

them seem to have stories to tell.

EXT - THE COASTAL ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

as Bucky drives South, passing a sign which says "ENSENADA

60 MI."

He passes a cluster of families walking on the side of the

road. They carry suitcases and head North.

EXT. THE COAST ROAD - NEAR ENSENADA

Bucky approaches Ensenada. The trickle of families headed

north has now becoming a roadside migration march. Every

fifth of sixth marcher carries a torch or lantern.

EXT. THE CITY LIMITS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT

Bucky cruises slowly into town and the most blatant shakedown

he's ever seen:

Rurales in brownshirts walk from peasant to peasant in the

northbound migration line, taking money and attaching tags to

their shoulders with staple guns; plainclothes cops sell bags

of beef jerky and dried fruit, putting coins into dispensers

attached to their belts.

Two Rurales pull a man out of line and beat him senseless

with the butts of their sawed-off shotguns.

EXT. THE ENSENADA POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Bucky stands outside a converted church with the word POLICIA

painted in black over religious scenes.

INT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Velvet wall hangings depicting Jesus decorate the entrance

hall. Blackshirts lounge on converted pews, a huge carved

cross on the front desk betrays its altar origins.

Bucky slides the Rurale at the desk his badge and a dollar.

The man saunters off down the hall.

INT. THE POLICE CHIEF'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

as Bucky is escorted in. The man sitting behind the desk

looks up. In flawless English:

Bucky exchanges his badge for a photo of Lee.

Vasquez studies the photo. Bucky senses a twitch...

Vasquez nods, hard to know if he believes Bucky any more than

Bucky believes him.

INT. A FLEABAG MOTEL ROOM - LATER

Bucky squeezes a bit of brown water onto a handkerchief and

wipes his brow off. He kicks his travel bag underneath the

bed and heads out.

EXT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

as Bucky pulls two hairs from his head and spit-glues them to

the door jamb.

EXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT

Garish neon, military personnel. Brownshirts packing serious

weapons keeping the mostly white street crowd in order.

HIS POV: An adobe streetfront with a neon sign: "CLUB BOXEO".

Bucky goes inside.

INT. THE CLUB BOXEO - CONTINUOUS

Bucky finds a brightly lit room filled with sailors and half-

dressed Mexican strippers. He stands on his tip-toes trying

to see over the crowd to find somebody with the air of

proprietor.

Cn a far wall: boxing publicity stills. He wanders over.

CLOSE ON THE WALL OF STILLS:

A row of light-heavies: Gus Lesnevich, Billy Conn, and Bucky.

Three stills over, next to Joe Louis, is Lee's photo. They

all look so young...So good...

An old voice in English breaks his reverie:

Bucky wheels and finds himself face to face with an old man.

The old pug looks him up and down.

INT. CLUB SATAN - LATER

Bucky walks into the biggest sewer you have ever seen. The

bar is a urinal trough where marines and sailors masturbate

while going down on nude women squatting on the bartop. Blow

jobs are being dispensed underneath tables facing the

bandstand.

Up on the stage a man in a Satan costume is fucking a woman

on a mattress. Next to him, a donkey with red velvet horns

pinned to his head eats hay out of a bowl while drunken

servicemen shout "Donkey! Donkey!"

Bucky is accosted by a disgusting old woman.

And grabs him by the arm...

INT. THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

ERNIE, a half-Mexican half-Chinese man, stands next to a huge

vat of stew. Bucky flashes Lee's photo.

Bucky flashes his badge, giving him a glimpse of his gun.

The chef tucks his hands into his aprons, fidgeting.

Ernie casually pulls a switchblade out of his apron and

scratches the back of his neck with it.

EXT. THE CLUB SATAN - LATER

Bucky walks outside and begins weaving his way back through

the crowds. Out of the corner of his eye he catches a couple

Rurales who seem to have taken an interest in him.

He dodges down an alley and cuts down another street,

breaking into a slow jog.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET - SECONDS LATER

Bucky walks backwards, checking the crowd. He's lost them.

INT. THE FLEABAG MOTEL - LATER

Bucky stands in front of his door. He runs his finger up and

down the door jamb. The hairs are gone.

With one swift kick he breaks down the door.

INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER

A white man stands with his hands raised.

Bucky gestures with his gun for the man to hit the wall. He

frisks him, pulling out a wallet and tossing on the bed.

Bucky kicks the man's legs out and pushes his to the floor.

Dolphine pulls himself up.

Bucky eyes the door.

Bucky steps back from Dolphine.

A FLASHBACK - LEE TEARING UP AN ENSENADA BAR

A FLASHBACK - BOBBY DE WITT AND FELIX CASCO BLOWN AWAY...

Bucky tightens his grip on the slats of a wooden chair. This

is hitting him hard.

Bucky's jaw clenches.

Bucky's head begins to reel...

Bucky backhands Dolphine hard, knocking him off the chair.

Bucky has his gun out, leveled at Dolphine.

EXT. THE BACKROADS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT

Dolphine drives his car while Bucky trains his gun on him.

They come over a ridge and find themselves on a big bluff

overlooking the ocean. A HUGE WOODEN BURNING CROSS marks the

spot.

EXT. THE BLUFF - LATER

Bucky scavenges a spare piece of picket fence, wraps it in a

rag and lights a torch off of the cross. Dolphine kicks at a

filthy American flag in the sand.

A SMALL SHOVEL PUSHING INTO THE GROUND

as Dolphine digs at gun point. After a few strokes the crunch

of the shovel hitting bone.

Bucky terrified to look but has to know--

--a white jumper--

Bucky breathes out hard. Unbearable. Dolphine digs on,

pushing the corpse out of the way and digging further into he

sand.

Bucky can't stand the suspense. He tucks his gun into his

waistband and grabs the shovel. After a few more strokes the

thump of something solid.

And suddenly it's there--sunburned pink skin, blond hair and

stitch scars on the eyebrows.

Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard.

And Bucky's in Dolphine's truck while Dolphine's screaming

for him to wait and Bucky slams the truck in reverse,

knocking the burning cross to the ground and grinding out out

of the sand onto the road, heading north and leaving Dolphine

and Lee alone at the grave...Heading north like a refugee...

EXT. KAY'S HOUSE - DAWN

Bucky's car rolls up slowly as he kills the engine, trying

not to make any noise.

The sun comes up, illuminating Bucky's filthy face as he

watches the picture-perfect house, wishing time would stand

still. Or better yet, wishing it would go back...

Finally he gets out of the car and begins a long walk into

the house.

A LAPD CHAPLAIN READING SOLEMNLY FROM A BIBLE

But as the camera PULLS BACK we see Bucky in his dress blues

standing next to Kay in a wedding dress.

EXT. THE BACKYARD OF KAY'S HOUSE

Russ Millard and Harry Sears stand by as the only two guests.

LEE AND KAY DANCING TOGETHER

as Harry and Russ drink from a punch bowl...

ANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER FORM: "Officer Dwight

Bleichert...Reassigned to: Scientific investigation

Detail"

INT. THE LAPD SCIENCE LAB - DAY

Bucky with plastic gloves on typing blood with an eye dropper

and a test tube. Meticulous and boring.

News radio plays in the background...

A Detective pokes his head in:

Bucky pulls a file out of a stack and gives it to him. The

nonchalance of a man whose job has become routine.

Bucky smiles politely and returns to his desk. The radio:

This gets a smile from Bucky as he returns to his test tubes

and beakers.

INT. AN APARTMENT - CRIME SCENE - DAY

Detectives comb through a murder scene as Bucky collects

latent fingerprints off doorknobs. No one pays him any

attention. He's been relegated to the worst kind of

purgatory.

INT. THE KITCHEN - MORNING

Bucky and Kay drink coffee and read the morning paper. She

absently strokes his free hand.

Bucky intently reads the front page.

The headline reads: "CITY COUNCIL INVESTIGATES '20s BOOM

BARONS FOR SHODDY HOME CONSTRUCTION".

Underneath, a picture of Sprague and Mack Sennett posing in

front of the HOLLYWOODLAND sign.

He's startled by Kay tapping her finger on the photo.

Bucky tries to hide his panic.

The phone rings. Bucky answers it.

Bucky writes something on a piece of paper. Hangs up.

EXT. A COLONIAL MANSION - JUNE STREET - MORNING

Bucky rings the bell. He's dressed plainclothes and carries a

technician's canvas bag.

An attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door.

He nods yes. She lets him in and he follows.

He notices for the first time she's dressed for gardening.

INT. THE STUDY - MORNING

Bucky steps over the police rope and into the study. A large

desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE

OUTLINE OF A BODY. Three feet away lies A SHOTGUN.

Behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains

decorates the white wall and crown mouldings.

A SERIES OF SHOTS

as Bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls, scrapes

tissue from the muzzle of the gun, dusts it for latent

prints, etc. At the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag.

INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

as Bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards

the main foyer. He stops short.

ON THE OPPOSING WALL

hangs a disturbing PAINTING: the portrait of a clown, a young

boy done up in court jester's garb. His body is gnarled and

hunched. He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks

like one continuous deep scar.

It is eerily reminiscent of Elizabeth Short's death wound.

Spooked, Bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby

family photos--two young women linked arm in arm.

She arrives next to him, dusty with soil.

The hallway phone rings. Jane moves to answer it.

INT. THE CRIME LAB - LATER

Bucky writes up a report. VIC pokes his head in.

INT. THE GARAGE - EVENING

The garage door is open to the evening air. Bucky's heavy bag

and speed bag hang on hooks. Bucky leans against a stool, a

large box open on the work bench.

INSIDE THE BOX

Bucky brushes aside a clutter of junk and pulls out A PHOTO

ALBUM. He opens it and begins flipping through: articles and

photos concerning Elizabeth Short. MOSTLY PHOTOS.

It's like a man in a mid-life crisis fantasizing about his

high school sweetheart.

OFF ONE OF THE PHOTOS WE DISSOLVE TO:

ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION

"Elizabeth Short...Screen Test #5"

She rambles on, almost oblivious of the camera.

She's lost in thought...we're not sure whether this is a

scene, her real life, or just a sad lie...

THE NOISE OF A CAR APPROACHING

BACK TO SCENE

Bucky drops the album back in the box as Kay's car pulls into

the driveway. He covers it back up.

She points over his shoulder to the hammer hanging in plain

view.

INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER

Bucky kneels on the ground near the closet, toolbox next to

him. He pulls on the floorboard, it flexes and squeaks.

He uses the hammer to pull the board completely off. He

squeezes wood glue around the edges and is about to replace

the board when something under the floor catches his eye.

He reaches into the hole, pulling out STACKS OF HUNDRED

DOLLAR BILLS BOUND WITH RUBBER BANDS.

He spies another scrap of paper in the hole...

INT. THE KITCHEN - SAME

Kay pours two scotches.

She carries the scotches into the bedroom and finds Dwight

sitting on the floor, staring at thousands of dollars in

cash.

He holds a paper money band inscribed: "$100...Boulevard-

Citizens Bank..."

THE BOULEVARD-CITIZENS BANK HEIST - A FLASHBACK

A SHOTGUN BLAST shatters the back window of the armored

truck. In the front seat, LEE BLANCHARD ducks down as the

driver hits the gas...

BACK ON THE SCENE

as Bucky leans back against the bed.

A FLASHBACK - LEE'S CAR

Lee and Bucky, their first day as partners...

BACK ON THE SCENE

as Bucky looks straight up into the ceiling light...

INT. DEWITT'S APARTMENT - A FLASHBACK

as Lee plants the incriminating bank bags in DeWitt's closet...

BACK ON THE SCENE

Bucky staring back into the hole in the floor...

EXT. DEWITT'S TRIAL - FLASHBACK

Lee leads Kay out of the courtroom.

BACK ON THE SCENE

as Kay leans down next to Bucky, gently putting her hand on

his shoulder...

He's in her face now. Okay, pal, you asked for it.

EXT. THE STREET - A FLASHBACK

Three black man and a white man get rousted by Lee and Bucky.

Chaos erupts as Lee executes Baxter Fitch and Bucky kills two

others...

BACK TO THE SCENE

on Bucky's anguished face:

She reaches for his face and he pulls away.

SLO-MO CLOSE-UP...

as the crumpled money drops down into the hole in the floor,

into the blackness...

WE FADE UP TO:

INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT

Bucky, stripped to bare chest, attacks the heavy beg.

He lashes into the heavy bag with a series of brutal left

hooks. Kay stands in the door, watching him. Her eyes red

from crying.

Kay turns around and shuts the door behind her.

EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S GARDEN - DAY

Bucky and Jane drink iced tea. A glorious garden behind them.

Bucky's face betrays his difficulties.

They watch each other, enjoying each other's company. A

strange emotional peace.

Bucky's gut clenches.

Before Bucky can press Jane stands up with the tray of iced

tea. The visit is over.

He follows her back inside.

INT. THE HALLWAY - SAME

As they stop momentarily in front of the scary clown painting.

Jane gives Bucky a warm handshake.

EXT. THE STREET - HANCOCK PARK - SOON AFTER

Bucky pulls out of June Street, and passes Muirfield. He

slows for a moment, squinting down the street, trying to

discern the Sprague mansion. He drives on.

We hang on the sign for Muirfield Avenue as the day turns to

night...

And down Muirfield Road, we see Bucky's car parked in the

shadows. Watching the Sprague house. A voyeur.

INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Bucky sleeps soundly as Kay readies herself for work. She

watches him for a moment, considering whether to wake him.

She decides not to and leaves.

The minute she goes, Bucky opens his eyes...

EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - EVENING

Bucky spies on the Spragues. He digs back into his seat as

Madeleine comes down the walk and puts mail in the mail box.

Just for a second it looks like she sees him...maybe not...

INT. CRIME LAB - DAY

Bucky dozes, his tie almost catching on fire in a Bunsen

burner.

EXT. THE MUIRFIELD ROAD STAKEOUT - EVENING

Bucky leans against the window, propping himself up.

ACROSS THE STREET

Madeleine's Packard pulls out and roars up the street. Bucky

guns his car to follow...

EXT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT

Bucky follows the Packard into a crowded GI bar parking lot.

He parks a distance away. But as he watches Madeleine get out

of her car he is staggered:

It's ELIZABETH SHORT.

Or, more accurately, it's Madeleine dressed up exactly like

the Dahlia in one of her famous portrait photos. Slinky black

dress, upswept hair, down to the yellow barrette. She strides

into the bar...

INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT

Bucky ducks into a smoke-filled GI bar where a commotion is

already taking place.

Madeleine is surrounded by soldiers fawning all over her.

Other men simply point and whisper--her Dahlia act isn't lost

on anybody.

Bucky slides into a booth in the corner to watch. He signals

for a drink.

INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Four bourbons later. Bucky watches as Madeleine settles into

a more intimate conversation with one soldier. Bucky downs

his drink as Madeleine grabs the GI's elbow and escorts him

out of the bar.

EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

Bucky sits in his car in the parking lot watching the soldier

loiter outside of A motel room. Madeleine returns from the

office with the key and lets the two of them in.

He watches as the light goes on; and then off.

INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - LATER

Bucky comes into the bedroom to find Kay waiting up for him.

He moves to her, pulling off his clothes as quickly as he

can.

He's on top of her, his bourbon stained kisses go and down

her neck and her breasts.

She responds, but not quickly enough for him. He rushes into

her before she's ready. Still, she tries to be there for him,

hoping to catch up with his lust.

She doesn't. And they both know it. They embrace, trying to

cover up the hollow awkwardness with familiar affection.

It doesn't work...

INT. THAD GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Bucky sits at Thad Green's desk, penitent.

Bucky nods.

Bucky just sits silent.

ANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER ORDER: "Transfer order...Officer

Bleichert...From SID...to Newton Street Division,

Nightwatch.

EXT. NEWTON STREET - MIDNIGHT

Bucky back in uniform again. This time, the black slums.

Heroin hookers, hard-core dealers, gangs.

INT. A LIQUOR STORE DOORWAY - NIGHT

Bucky and a large black man come tumbling out of the liquor

store throwing vicious punches at each other.

Bucky takes three to land six, eventually knocking the guy

out. He looks across the street to see to cops watching him,

measuring him.

INT. AN ALLEY - NIGHT

As Bucky chases two men towards a chain link fence at the end

of the alley. One of them gets to the fence and scrambles up

it. Bucky yanks the other one off the fence, slamming him to

the ground.

INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

As Kay sleeps alone in the bed.

INT. A JAZZ BAR - EARLY MORNING

Bucky sits in his uniform listening to a jazz quartet.

INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Bucky sleeps on the couch as Kay leaves for work.

EXT. A STREET CORNER - NIGHT

Bucky in his patrol car. The night a hot sweat. He listens to

music on his radio and watches two hookers dance on the

corner, waving at cars.

A SCRAGGLY OLD WINO staggers up to the women, stumbling

around them, dancing with them. They sneer at him, tell him

to beat it.

INSIDE THE PATROL CAR

Bucky flashes his headlights at the bum. The bum ignores him.

Bucky flashes them again, annoyed.

The bum looks into the glare and flips Bucky off.

And suddenly Bucky snaps, jumping from his car. In three big

strides he's on the bum, clobbering him with roundhouse lefts

and rights.

The women are screaming. The drunk is screaming.

Bucky drops him, staggering into a phone booth. He drops a

nickel in the phone. Dials a number. Ring. Ring. Ring...

He hangs up. Dials another. A woman's voice answers.

EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT

Bucky's just onto the porch steps when Madeleine answers the

door. She's dressed like the Dahlia.

He pushes her inside.

INT. AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Sixth graders write in silence. Kay sits at her desk, sadness

in her eyes as she watches the children.

INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING

Bucky stands in the living room, examining family photos. A

photo of two young, proud WWI vets: George Tilden and Emmett

Sprague...A photo of the dark-haired Ramona and the ruddy and

fair-haired Emmett...Photos of Madeleine and Martha, the

brunette and the ruddy blond...Back to the first photo:

George Tilden's dark hair.

Madeleine wanders in, Bucky smiles at her.

She runs her hands over his shoulders.

He scans her for a reaction. If she has one it ripples

through her almost undetectable. Almost.

EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - LATER

As Bucky cruises by, grinning. He salutes the house.

EXT. BUCKY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

as he drives onto his own modest street.

EXT. KAY AND BUCKY'S HOUSE - DAY

A moving van in the driveway and Kay's Plymouth stuffed with

boxes. Bucky double-parks and bolts up the steps.

The van pulls away behind him.

The van driver ignores him; Bucky turns as Kay walks out onto

the porch.

He reaches for her and she backs out of grabbing range.

She spins out of his grasp and makes for her car. She guns

the engine and disappears.

INT. THE HOUSE - SECONDS LATER

Bucky stands in the middle of the living room, cataloguing

the little things. No periodicals on the coffee table, half

the record collection gone, no candlesticks.

He picks up the largest chair (Lee's favorite) and throws it

at the wall. Next, Kay's rocking chair shatters the glass

cabinets. The coffee table goes through the front window.

IN THE BEDROOM

Bucky yanks out all the drawers, turns over the bed.

IN THE BATHROOM

he takes a pipe wrench to the sink, crushes the mirror with

one blow...

In a terrible ten rounder with the ghosts of his past Bucky

demolishes the dream house, pulls his uniforms out of the

closet and bolts out of the house, leaving the door open so

scavengers can pick the place clean...

INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

Bucky sits on the bed, his back pushed up against the wall.

Eyeball to eyeball with Elizabeth Short, Betty, Liz, the

Black Dahlia.

A collage of photos and file folders...

EXT. THE SLUMS - LATE NIGHT

Bucky stands in the worst of slums, his blue uniform a beacon

to anyone who would do him harm.

ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION

No clapsticks this time. Just Betty Short sitting an the

couch. She reaches down and pulls off her pumps. Now she

reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings.

Not sexy. Empty and resigned.

EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER

An apartment complex has been erected at the murder site.

EXT. AN AERIAL VIEW OF LOS ANGELES - DAY

ANGLE ON: THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN. As we watch the sign

changes, the "D" dropping off the end. It now reads

"HOLLYWOODLAN".

EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DAY

Bucky, unshaven and out of uniform, leans against his car on

a working class residential street. He stares across at a

modest Victorian house and the garage behind it. We recognize

it hopefully; we've been here before.

EXT. A GARAGE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

It's Cleo Short's apartment. Or at least it used to be. Bucky

peers in a window and sees it's filled with junk.

He walks back towards the street, intent on heading back to

his car. on a hunch, he walks up onto the porch of the

Victorian house and rings the bell.

EXT. THE PORCH - SAME

Footsteps at the door. It opens to reveal another identical

twin to Elizabeth Short.

Bucky is stunned and can't find his tongue.

She begins to shut the door but someone behind her pulls it

back open.

Cleo Short, Elizabeth's father.

INT. THE SITTING ROOM - LATER

The two men arrange themselves in chairs while the Betty look-

a-alike makes herself busy in the kitchen behind Cleo.

Bucky tries not to stare. He forces himself to focus on Cleo,

who, while five years older, looks much better than last time

Bucky saw him.

Bucky can't deny that.

The young woman brings in two beers for Bucky and Cleo. Bucky

checks her out again. Cleo knows why.

He squeezes her hand affectionately.

She rolls her eyes, picks up a newspaper and heads out on the

porch.

Bucky takes a swig of his beer. Cleo's eyes scour Bucky.

Cleo studies him, knows Bucky's a lost soul. He softens for

the first time. Leans forward, elbows on knees. Almost

looking like a father who'd lost a daughter.

His gaze drifts outside to his youngest daughter.

Bucky shrugs off any talk of his father. Cleo gets it.

Cleo takes a swig of his beer.

INT./EXT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cleo follows Bucky out onto the porch. Christine reads a copy

of Photoplay. The cover touts the current Mack Sennett

Revival in honor of the revised Hollywoodland sign...

He snatches away the Photoplay and slaps it into Bucky's

hands.

The man winks. Bucky takes the magazine and salutes him with

it. He heads back down the walk. Behind him Cleo Short

watches him go.

EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - HOLLYWOOD - DUSK

Bucky sits at a light, staring north. Scaffolding drapes the

Hollywoodland sign. Movie lights have been set up, capturing

the event on film.

His attention turns to Christine's Photoplay on the seat next

to him; the weekly rag is open to an ad for the Mack Sennett

revival:

A reproduction of the Hollywoodland sign across the top of

the page, and below it the words "Keystone Kops at the

Admiral Theater--Air conditioned!"

Below that a still from a Keystone Kops movie, registering

huge and loud and wrong: Three Keystone Kops standing between

pillars shaped like snakes swallowing their own tails; a wall

inset with Egyptian hieroglyphics was behind them.

Unmistakably the background that appeared in the Linda

Martin/Betty Short porn film.

Cars honking behind him. Bucky's transfixed by the image. The

light is green.

He jerks upright and squeals out of the intersection.

EXT. THE ADMIRAL THEATER - SOON AFTER

Bucky buys a ticket underneath a marquee which reads MACK

SENNETT REVIVAL".

INT. THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

A Keystone Kop short in progress. Bucky can barely sit down

to watch...

And there's a shot of the porn set--the Keystone Kops running

around in it like they're solving at crime back in ancient

Egypt.

The short ends with a large pie throwing scene on the porn

set. The credits begin to roll: "Director--Mack Sennett.

Scenarist--Mack Sennett. Assistant Director--Emmett

Sprague"

On Bucky's face as one last piece of information hits him:

"Filmed in Hollywood, USA."

EXT. THE MOVIE THEATER

as Bucky bursts out into the evening, the lights on the

Hollywood hill catching his attention.

INT. A FLASHBACK - THE SPRAGUE HOUSE

Bucky at dinner with the Spragues.

BACK TO THE SCENE

as Bucky stares up at the sign.

INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

Bucky tears through it, pulling out files. The door opens -

it's Russ Millard.

Bucky whirls around, gesturing to the room--

Bucky flops onto the bed, almost frantic.

Bucky meets his eyes: forgive me my sins.

INT. BUCKY'S CAR - NIGHT

Bucky drives with Russ in the car next to him.

INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

On Russ:

INT. BUCKY'S CAR - BEACHWOOD CANYON - NIGHT

as they inch their way up into a huge traffic snarl in

Beachwood Canyon. The sign looms high above them as the "A"

is taken dawn.

EXT. A PARK AREA AT THE NORTH END OF BEACHWOOD DRIVE

A huge area is cordoned off as people watch the sign being

torn down.

Bucky and Russ leave the car there, badge the local blue

doing crowd control, and split off down a dirt side road into

the woods.

EXT. A WOODED AREA - NIGHT

Bucky and Russ play a flashlight over a piece of paper, like

two men consulting a treasure map in the woods.

In the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown

out and the door hanging off its hinges.

They walk on, leaving this particular bungalow behind.

EXT. A STREAM - WOODS - LATER

Bucky shines the light in a running stream as they follow it

deeper into the night...

Bucky and Russ round a bend in the stream and see

THE SKELETON OF A BUNGALOW

teetering on the edge of the stream. Empty window and doors

hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death

leer.

Bucky and Russ feel it, tensing up as they approach. They

pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and

step into the abandoned house.

INT. THE BUNGALOW - SAME

A scattering of trash in the front room, animal shit, a

bicycle tire, rags.

They move through the house, each roam, each closet and

corner creeps with potential violence. Still, nothing.

From the kitchen:

Bucky joins Russ at the back door, the screen rotted off.

Through the empty window they see:

AN ALUMINUM GARDENING SHED, the door wide open.

You know it before they even get there. But as soon as they

step inside...

INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS

They know something bad happened here...

Half the room is taken up by a mattress, its blue ticking

stained dark brown with blood. A gas lantern sits in the

corner, leaning against a stack of blood-spattered books,

including a copy of Gray's Anatomy and Victor Hugo's The Man

Who Laughs along with a clutch of pornographic pictures.

Bucky's already pulling on a pair of rubber gloves from his

SID days. For the first time we notice he's carrying his

forensic kit.

He opens it, revealing the test tubes, fingerprint powder,

tweezers, etc.

Russ grants Bucky his take-charge attitude. He snaps on a

pair of gloves.

A GRUESOME MONTAGE

1. Bucky scrapes blood off a wall and into a test tube.

2. Russ flips through the pornographic material--some of it

very intense.

3. Bucky fills up another test tube with dark hair tweezed

from the caked blood on the mattress.

4. Underneath the mattress, Bucky finds small pieces of

rope...

5. Bucky measures a bloody sole print and traces it onto a

piece of paper.

6. Bucky finger prints the whole fucking place, pulling good

prints from the door jamb, the door, and the wall near the

head of the mattress.

OUTSIDE THE GARDENING SHED

Russ fiddles with the books, making himself busy. Finally he

walks back inside.

INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS

Bucky sits on the floor, his hands shaking as he holds a

fingerprint plate in one hand and a piece of paper in the

other.

Bucky hands him the fresh plate. Russ studies it. Bucky hands

him the piece of paper with a blown-up set of prints on it.

The two sets of prints are identical. Russ sees the name at

the top of the paper: ELIZABETH SHORT.

He exhales deeply.

RUSS MILLARD HACKING A FOUR INCH SECTION OF THE DOOR JAMB OFF

WITH HIS KNIFE AND SLIPPING IT INTO A PLASTIC BAG.

Bucky sits on the ground outside.

EXT. UNDERNEATH THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - LATER

The last of the "LAND" letters has come down and a party has

ensued. A marching band plays "There's No Business Like Show

Business".

Bucky and Russ stumble out of the woods, carrying the

evidence of Betty Short's death in their hands.

INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

Bucky sits on the bed, the evidence spread out around him.

Russ stands in the doorway.

Russ nods.

He closes the door, leaving Bucky alone with Elizabeth.

INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

Bucky lies on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - DAWN

Bucky flips through Gray's Anatomy, killing time.

INT. THE CRIME LAB - MORNING

Bucky transfers the killer's prints from the doorjamb to a

plate.

INT. A LARGE ROOM WITH FILE CABINETS

Bucky pulls a fingerprint card from a cabinet. He shuts the

cabinet. The tab on the outside reads: "City Employees".

EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING

Bucky edges his way along the side of the house. A side

window is open and he pulls himself inside.

INT. THE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Moving boxes fill the front hallway. Bucky hears voices

coming from the main hall. Madeleine and Emmett.

Bucky unholsters his gun; from his pocket he pulls out a

SILENCER and screws it on the muzzle.

Bucky steps into the main room, gun prominent at his side.

He eyes the gun.

On the Spragues, trying to maintain their upper-class cool.

He levels the gun at Madeleine. Rock steady. Madeleine sits

on a divan.

Off Emmett's shocked look:

Bucky points the gun at Madeleine again.

She hesitates. He shoots a MING VASE next to her. She jumps.

Bucky blows away another objet d'art. The two Spragues huddle

on the couch.

Emmett gestures vainly towards the stuffed dog Balto.

Madeleine exhales hate.

Two more shots from the gun destroy another fifty grand worth

of art. Bucky reloads.

She nods yes.

Emmett clears his throat.

Emmett walks to a small desk. He reaches into the drawer--

Bucky puts his gun to Emmett's head--

He pulls out the four passports (not a gun). Bucky takes

them.

Bucky blows a hole in a vase some six inches from her. He

cocks his head at her, as if to say: the next one will be

closer.

The dig crosses through Bucky's mind for a moment before he

shooes it away. To Emmett:

Bucky puts the silenced muzzled half an inch from Sprague's

brain.

EXT. A PAUPER'S CEMETERY - DAY

Bucky stands in front of a plain grave marker: "George

Tilden. 1906 - 1948.  War Hero and Loyal Friend"

INT. THE ROOM WITH THE FILE CABINETS - FLASHBACK

Bucky pulls Tilden's card and we see the close-up: "George

Tilden". Added by hand: "Deceased"

EXT./INT. THE ALUMINUM GARDEN SHED - DAY

Bucky watches as Russ tips the gas lantern over on its side,

the gas leaking out into the tin shed.

Bucky and Russ step outside. Russ lights a match and tosses

it inside. Flames begin to eat away the bloody mattress...

Bucky kicks the tin door shut, sealing the fire inside

Elizabeth Short's private hell.

INT. JANE CHAMBERS HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

Bucky and Jane Chambers drink some iced tea.

They laugh, Jane a bit more than Bucky. She narrows in on him.

He gets up from the table.

INT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Bucky wanders over and stares at the slash-mouthed clown

painting, always transfixed by it.

She wanders into the study and fishes out some papers from

her late husbands desk while Bucky continues to stare at the

clown. She returns, reading from the sale slip.

A FLASHBACK - THE GARDENING SHED

A blood-spattered copy of The Man Who Laughs on the pile of

pornography--

BACK TO SCENE

As the slash-mouthed clown towers over Bucky, his head

buzzing...

Bucky steps back.

He focuses on her.

She hands him the receipt.

ANGLE ON THE RECEIPT:

"Received from Eldridge Chambers, $3500 for the sale

of the F. Yannantuono painting. Ramona Cathcart

Sprague, January 15, 1947."

Speechless.

He's out the door.

EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - SAME

Bucky runs to his car, pulls out his gun. He sprints off down

the street...

EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - SAME

Bucky waits outside, watching from behind a tree. He watches

as the last of the cars, Madeleine's, pulls out of the

driveway.

He crosses the street. He tries the front door, surprised to

find it unlocked. He goes inside.

INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Gun drawn, Bucky cases the downstairs. He hears a noise.

A red wave of sweat washes over him. He walks carefully into

RAMONA'S SITTING ROOM

where the matriarch sits on a tiny sofa, her arms lost in a

silk dressing gown. Her face puffy and her eyes dark, her

gray hair frizzy.

Bucky trains a gun on her.

She smiles. Very slowly she withdraws one of her hands from

the folds of her dressing gown. She holds a tiny ladylike

revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet. When she

speaks, it's with complete control.

She smiles at him again, loving his need.

Bucky eases himself into a chair opposite her.

Her face hardens.

She looks over her nose at him.

She seems to drift.

Her thousand yard stare gradually returns to Bucky.

Bucky's not sure what to say next. She fills the space quite

well.

Ramona's eyes brighten up.

She speaks with such an insanity and calm it frightens him.

And on Bucky's hungry eyes we

BUCKY'S CAR peeling out of Hancock Park.

INT. THE FAIRFAX PRIMARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Kay sits at her desk, grading papers. Bucky bursts in.

INT. THE TIP DESK - POLICE DEPARTMENT - FLASHBACK

Bucky and Lee sit at the tip desk while Lee listens to a very

long call, saying nothing...

BACK TO SCENE

Kay and Bucky stare each other down.

INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT - A FLASHBACK

Lee Blanchard beats the hell out of Emmett Sprague while

Madeleine's looks on.

INT. THE BATHROOM OF THE POLICE STATION - A FLASHBACK

Bucky bursts in on Lee washing his bloody fists.

BACK TO SCENE

Bucky's leaning on the desk...

Kay fingers the edges of an exam. She looks him in the eye.

He absorbs the blow and waits for her to continue.

Kay slams down a book.

The room grinds to a halt.

Bucky looks like he's about to burst. He wants to go to her,

lock her in his arms and forgive. instead, he just backs up

three steps, slowly turns on his heels, and walks out.

INT. A BAR - NIGHT

Bucky sits in the back of the bar, shrouded in smoke and loud

music. He drinks bourbon and watches Madeleine over at the

bar. She's got her hand on a soldier's knee.

EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - NIGHT

Madeleine Sprague and the soldier boy walk from the office

over to the now familiar Room 11. They enter, shutting the

door and flicking on the light to reveal

BUCKY

sitting on the back of a chair with his feet on the seat. He

trains his silenced pistol on them. Flashing his badge, he

points the soldier to the door:

You don't have to tell the soldier twice. He backs out and

shuts the door.

Bucky smiles.

Now she's curious.

Maybe a trace of fear in her eyes...

He cocks the gun.

She steps back against the door as he advances.

He puts the gun to her forehead.

She grins wickedly.

He pulls the gun from her head and shoots her in the kneecap.

EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

Cap cars, flashing lights, an ambulance.

INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

Madeleine is interrogated by Homicide dicks.

EXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

As Madeleine, dressed as a Mexican woman in heavy makeup and

a large hat, tails Lee back to his motel...

EXT. THE COURTHOUSE - DAY

Madeleine led away amongst a flock of photographers. Her

family linked arm-and-arm in the background, crying, only

Martha looking like she might survive...

INT. THE POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Bucky sits at a table, staring into the one-way mirror.

WE PULL OUT and see Bucky's cuffs, badge and gun sitting on

the table in front of him.

THE CAMERA DRIFTS THROUGH THE ONE-WAY MIRROR revealing RUSS

MILLARD standing on the other side.

INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

Bucky standing amongst the Dahlia files. He begins pulling

photos off the walls...

INT. BUCKY AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The destroyed fairy tale house is in mid-repair. Kay is in

work clothes, painting a new trim in the living room.

The front door opens. Bucky stands in the doorway, carrying a

box of Dahlia files. Kay watches as he crosses the room

without a word and dumps the box of files into the fireplace.

He tosses on a match and the box goes up in flames.

She moves to him.

INT. A CASTING OFFICE - DAY

We arrive just as she exits, the outline of her body quickly

disappearing into the blackness beyond the office door...

FADE TO BLACK
