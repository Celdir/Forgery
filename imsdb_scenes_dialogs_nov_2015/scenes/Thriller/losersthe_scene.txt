THE DESERT. Sizzling dunes. Harsh. Unforgiving.

Afghanistan - Three Years Ago

We hear faint SCREAMS. A man BEGGING...

Sand dunes stretch to the horizon. Nowhere to run...

A SHADOW FALLS across the sand. Then a second. One looks

like a Dog's Head. The other like...

HAND PUPPET SHADOWS. LAUGHTER from OTHER MEN. "Godzilla"

pursues "Dog Head", catches him, and begins HUMPING HIM.

WHIP PAN to the Puppeteer and FREEZE-FRAME ON:

Jensen. 20's, Lennon glasses, wild blonde hair, shirt

open. Bald eagle tattoo on his chest. RESUME SPEED:

WHIP PAN to and FREEZE-FRAME ON:

Pooch. Mid 30's, black and solid. Eagle tattoo on right

bicep, his NINE MONTH OLD DAUGHTER'S FACE tattooed on his

left. Currently mock offended. RESUME SPEED:

WHIP PAN and FREEZE FRAME ON:

Cougar. Age unknown. Tan camo cowboy hat pulled low

over his eyes, long hair. Sniper Rock-God. He doesn't

say or move much. Ain't no rattling him. RESUME SPEED:

WHIP PAN as he asks the question and FREEZE FRAME ON:

Roque. 30's. Close cropped black hair. If Lance

Armstrong bred with Darth Vader. Doesn't smile much, but

he's smiling now. The four are in

EXT. HUMVEE -- DAY

Open air, the guys sit in the back. In the middle of the

desert with nothing to do but wait. Roque holds the deck.

The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their

foreheads -- two deuces (Jensen and Roque), a three

(Pooch), and an eight (Cougar). Pitiful cards.

At which point, JENSEN PULLS A KNIFE...

...and tosses it into the center of the circle. HIS BET.

Roque responds by tossing a .357 MAGNUM from his belt in.

He puts in a Desert Eagle. Jensen pulls a second, meaner

looking knife. Twirling it.

Jensen grins and STABS IT down into the pot.

The Silent Man stares at the others. Two deuces and a

three. He shakes his head at them. Before he can bet...

WHIP PAN to

Clay. Mid-30's. Their leader, and you gotta be a bad-

ass to lead this crew. Tired eyes. A weariness to him

already. And hands faster than you can imagine.

EXT. HUMVEE (MOVING) -- DAY

RIPPING ACROSS THE DESERT. Pooch drives, Clay shotgun,

others in the back. Passing a COMPUTER TABLET to Jensen:

He hands the tablet back.

He upshifts a gear as the Humvee drives on...

P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS

A terrorist looking fellow talks with another. We are...

EXT. DESERT BLUFF -- AFTERNOON

Our guys, now in full on Black Ops Special Forces combat

desert fatigues, perched high above what looks like a RUN

DOWN AFGHAN PRISON. Roque with the field glasses:

Pooch fires up the LASER DESIGNATOR and aims it at the

compound. A high pitched whine as he does...

Cougar sights down the LASER SCOPE of his LONG RIFLE.

Just taking in the scenery. Jensen, into a field radio:

EXT. AFGHAN SKY -- DAY

A DESERT HAWK ROARS THROUGH THE SKY, enroute to target.

EXT. DESERT BLUFF -- DAY

And then, for the first time COUGAR SPEAKS. With concern:

Clay immediately looks THROUGH HIS SCOPE --

A GROUP OF CHILD-SLAVES on the ground BY THE PRISON,

being led off a truck. The others look too. Reacting:

STATIC. Seconds tick by...

Clay GRABS THE RADIO from Jensen:

STATIC. A beat. The others stare at Clay.

Cougar takes the butt of his rifle and SMASHES THE LASER

DESIGNATOR TO BITS! Clay, into the radio:

STATIC. Then, a DIFFERENT VOICE:

The voice is even. Distinctly unmilitary. Almost stoned.

Clay blinks - no one uses names on comms.

STATIC. Clay hits the send button to respond - gets a

SQUELCH. Cursing, tossing the radio to Jensen:

His face, stricken. They all are. And then:

Clay hefts his rifle.

The others stare at him. Automatically begin checking

their own weapons. Roque runs it down for them:

EXT. AL GHOZAR FORT -- DAY

WHAM! BAD GUYS firing wildly as our guys' HUMVEE PLOWS

through the GATE!

A SERIES OF SHOTS -- We see just how good these guys are.

Cougar on his knee in the back -- snipes SINGLE SHOT KILLS --

takes out SEVEN MEN. Roque pulls to a halt in the center

of the compound -- Bad Guys, coming out of the woodwork

with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. As the guys hop out:

Clay leads ZONE COVERAGE toward the building -- Roque and

Cougar run middle -- QUICK DEATH STRIKES. Images BLAST

fast and savage as these men KILL THEIR WAY INTO THE FORT.

INT. AL GHOZAR FORT - KHYBER PASS - CONTINUOUS

Roque calmly kicks in the door -- kills FIVE MEN sitting

around a table with TWO YOUNG GIRLS in the middle -- the

terrified girls run to him. The BAD GUYS have no chance --

Fast. Precise. SPECTACULAR. Our crew takes the fort.

MOVING THROUGH a tight hallway, they find the children

locked in a large empty room. They start leading them

out. One LITTLE BOY stops Clay. In PASHTUN:

Clay checks the time. 3 MINUTES TO AIRSTRIKE...

Roque and Cougar hustle the kids toward the exit while

Clay moves DOWNSTAIRS into the darker sublevels...

INT. AL GHOZAR FORT -- DARKER SUBLEVEL -- CONTINUOUS

Clay kicks in a door to find A MAN - Looming over a

SHACKLED BOY. Unbuckling his pants.

The Man pales. Realizing the American understands what

he was about to do, backing away, BEGGING IN PASHTUN:

Omar DOESN'T MOVE. Instead, he eerily raises his hand

and wordlessly POINTS TO A CELL. In the corner. And

Clay hears a MOAN emit from it. VAGUELY HUMAN.

Omar lowers his arm. Goes upstairs, dragging his bear.

Clay turns. Approaches the cell. Looks down into it...

it's clear from Clay's face that it's SOMETHING HORRIFIC.

He torture rasps and spits small chunks of death...

Something Horrific leans forward out of the shadows...

Clay just stares.

Clay's just staring into the burning, crazed eyes of

Something Horrific.

BLAM! A BULLET pierces what used to be left of Something

Horrific's CHEST. Not fired by Clay...

And he dies. Clay turns - COUGAR. Lowers his rifle.

Speaks one word.

Holds up his watch. 40 SECONDS LEFT. Speaks another:

EXT. AL GHOZAR FORT -- DAY

Clay and Cougar BURST from the fort, FIRING and RUNNING

FULL TILT towards the commandeered TRUCK LOADED WITH KIDS.

As they leap into the back, Pooch hits the gas:

As he RUNS OVER two Bad Guys trying to stop them at the

gate. The sound of a JET APPROACHING. Roque to Jensen:

Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet. Shows an

animation mock-up to Roque - huge blast radius. To Pooch:

EXT. SKIES ABOVE AL GHOZAR FORT -- DAY

The Fort and the retreating Truck below us mere specks as

the DESERT HAWK SWOOPS IN and RELEASES ITS PAYLOAD...

A moment of silence as it falls... and then STRIKES below,

an orange FIREBALL BALLOONING OUTWARDS...

EXT. TRUCK (MOVING) -- DAY

Ripping across the dunes, FIREBALL EXPANDING behind them...

As the fireball ENGULFS THEM.

INT. TRUCK (MOVING) -- DAY

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRESTORM: All Pooch can see is

FLAMES through the WINDSHIELD as they plow through the

destruction. Glances in the REAR-VIEW:

Cougar's sleeve, FULLY ABLAZE. He casually rips it off

and tosses it out the back.

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - The fire clears... to reveal a

30 FOOT DROP. The guys scream as they PLUNGE OVER IT...

WHOOMP! The Truck buries itself nose first in the sand.

EXT. AFGHAN DESERT -- DAY

Silence. Smoke rises from a crater that was once the

Fort. The doors of the truck creak open. Most of the

YOUNGSTERS GIGGLE. Fun ride. As the guys help them out:

Sounds of a BLACKHAWK CHOPPER APPROACHING...

Clay doesn't seem to hear him.

A beat. Clay seems to shake off his daze as the BLACKHAWK

sets down. Walking up to the chopper:

Clay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck. A SILVER

CRUCIFIX hangs around it. Clay, softer:

A beat.

The Pilot nods. Our guys begin loading the kids on...

Clay helps Omar on last. The kid looks at him. He knows

perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement.

Clay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and

the CHOPPER ASCENDS. The kids wave goodbye to our guys.

Omar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise. Only broken as

the chopper begins to recede into the distance. The last

Clay sees of him is that ratty little TEDDY BEAR...

As Jensen tunes his radio...

Jensen's tuning into the MIG's frequency. Looking nervous.

TURNS UP THE VOLUME:

Their eyes go wide with understanding....

Clay and Cougar have ALREADY BEGUN RUNNING towards the

receding chopper on the horizon. As the MIG SWINGS IN

BEHIND THE BLACKHAWK....

WOOSH... The MIG FIRES - AIR TO AIR MISSILE... WHOOMP!

The Blackhawk's tail rotor SHEARED OFF, the chopper

spinning and falling but still intact...

Pooch, the pilot, from somewhere SCREAMING:

FROM THE RADIO:

The SECOND MISSILE from the MiG SLAMS INTO THE BLACKHAWK

proper. Burning, spinning... FALLING. Clay and Cougar,

screaming by the time they reach the wreck...

OMAR'S TEDDY BEAR, BLACKENING to a crisp. Clay tries to

dive into the flames, but COUGAR DRAGS HIM BACK. No use,

anyway...

Nothing's alive inside.

INT. PAKISTAN - KARACHI SAFE HOUSE -- DAY

A safe house. A LARGE MAN stands in the shadows, watching

as Roque, Jensen, Pooch, Cougar, and Clay yell back and

forth at FENNEL - a CIA Handler:

The LARGE MAN finally steps out of the shadows. Special

Forces, like our guys. WADE. They know him.

Silence as the guys take this in.

Wade studies him. Finally:

Fennel sighs.

They watch Wade and Fennel leave. Now alone. SILENCE.

After a bit, Pooch looks down. Under a little table...

It hits them all at the same time.

They BOLT for the door. LOCKED. Run to the window.

THREE FLOORS UP and it has BARS ON IT.

Roque and Pooch - SWISS ARMY KNIVES OUT. PHILLIPS HEAD

attachments, slotting them into the SCREWS that hold the

barred WINDOW FRAME in place...

Jensen POPS OPEN the briefcase. Wires and dials aplenty...

First set of screws out, moving onto the second...

Second set out, moving onto the third and final....

Third set out, ripping the frame from the window...

EXT. KARACHI SAFE HOUSE -- SAME

WIDE ON THE CITY BLOCK: As the SAFE HOUSE EXPLODES!

Debris flying far enough to shower the open air bazaar

being held two blocks East. HOLD on the smoldering ruins.

AS WE SLOWLY FADE TO...

EXT. NEW HAMPSHIRE AIRBASE -- NIGHT

A rain slicked tarmac. MARINES carrying FIVE FLAG DRAPED

COFFINS off a troop transport carrier. Our guys' FAMILIES

watching. Clay's mother. Jensen's girlfriend. Pooch's

wife and daughters. Tears in their eyes.

INTERCUT WITH...

INT. CIA BACKROOM -- NIGHT

Somewhere secret. Our guys' PERSONNEL FOLDERS. Each

being opened. Each being stamped "DECEASED". BACK TO...

EXT. NEW HAMPSHIRE AIRBASE -- NIGHT

As the Marines SALUTE the passing coffins. POOCH'S WIFE

lowers her head, weeping. CUT TO:

BLACK SCREEN. OVER IT IN SMALL LETTERS:

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

A nice quiet neighborhood. White picket fences, the whole

nine. WE'RE WATCHING from outside the kitchen window of

a Cape Cod two story. POOCH'S WIFE JOLENE doing dishes.

Older. Hair cropped. Springfield, Massachusetts - NOW.

She dries her hands and heads upstairs. We catch a glimpse

of her in the upstairs hall. Then in her DAUGHTER's

bedroom. 4 YEARS OLD NOW. Mom, putting her down.

In the backyard, by the swingset, a figure watches. POOCH.

Indulging in a nightly ritual...

EXT. CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

Mexico City. CARNIVALE. Day of the Dead. Jesters and

masks. Music. A man with a cowboy hat walks among them.

COUGAR. Sees Mexican Police eyeing him. Walks a little

faster. Hat pulled low as fireworks explode above...

EXT. DESERT STRIP MALL -- NIGHT

Phoenix, Arizona. A late night internet cafe, wedged

between a donut shop and spinning studio. JENSEN sits.

Alone. Playing INTERACTIVE ON-LINE COMBAT...

EXT. HOLLYWOOD, FL - HOLLYWOOD DOG TRACK -- MORNING

Hollywood, Florida. DOGS IN FULL SPRINT. A few thousand

SPECTATORS. Not the Derby, but reasonably enthused.

IN THE CHEAP SEATS -- CLAY and ROQUE. Three years older.

But in no way bolder. They look almost... Broken.

Roque's got his feet up. Sucks lazily on a straw embedded

in what looks like a SODA POP. Clay's got BINOCULARS,

following the action on the track -- Muscle shredded

greyhounds tearing over the dirt. One crosses the FINISH

LINE. Roque checks their ticket. Yawns.

Clay's got the binoculars up, slow-checking the track.

Clay drums his fingers along the binocs as he scans. We

see on his right hand, between his thumb and index finger -

A TATTOO. A TEDDY BEAR. Looks just like Omar's...

Something glint-flashes...catches Clay's eye. He looks

across the track, towards the PARKING LOT.

CLAY SCANS THE LOT -- A YOUNG WOMAN in tight jeans walks

towards a black pick up, carrying a PAIR OF BINOCULARS.

Clay doesn't respond. Watching her. Roque exhales.

Roque takes a pull on his straw.

EXT. FLORIDA -- MCDONALD'S PARKING LOT -- AFTERNOON

Clay and Roque wolf Big Macs in a 1988 Chevy Crew Cab.

FAMILIES eat outside. KIDS play like hamsters in tubes.

Various PEOPLE walk to and from their cars. Clay and

Roque shield their faces from them instinctually.

A Metro Dade POLICE CRUISER rolls into the McDonald's.

Clay watches close as it pulls into a parking spot...

Clay, seeing one of the COPS say something to the other...

Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the

cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street...

EXT. MOTEL SIX -- AFTERNOON

Roque pulls up to their shitbeater Motel. Tension still

between them. He gets out, turning back to his friend:

With that, Roque heads to the Motel. Clay looks down at

his quarter eaten burger. He needs some real food...

INT. BUSTER'S BOOZE & BURGERS

Clay at the bar, eating a steak and drinking alone. Honky-

tonk on the juke, mix of sawdust and blood on the floor.

A YOUNG WOMAN enters - she's hot, feels familiar. Clay

eyes her as she orders a drink, dodges several GUYS.

She catches Clay's eye. Rolls her eyes. Clay's paying

more attention to his T-Bone than the girl. She slides

up next to him. Her name's AISHA.

Clay turns back to his food. Not used to attractive women

instigating conversation. Aisha watches as Clay eats.

She's still watching him. It's getting annoying.

Aisha studies Clay. If we've been paying close attention,

we might ID her as the race track binocular chick. We're

not sure if Clay does.

INT. HOLLYWOOD, FL. - GOLD COAST MOTEL - LATER

Clay and Aisha enter his motel room. Aisha checks out

the sparse accommodations.

Clay points to the bathroom.

INT. HOLLYWOOD, FL - GOLD COAST - BEDROOM / BATHROOM

Aisha checks herself in the mirror. A touch of lip gloss.

Clay IN THE BEDROOM. Leans over - stretching his

hamstrings. Does a few subtle twists - Loosening up.

Shit. Clay looks around. Weakly:

IN THE BATHROOM - Aisha studies herself in the mirror.

Stretching her arms, prepping for some physical activity...

IN THE BEDROOM

Aisha comes back out. Both now stretched and loose.

They study each other. Aisha slowly moves towards Clay.

Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach...

Clay strokes her cheek...

Their lips, inches from touching...

WHAM! Clay DECKS HER. She REELS BACK -- LOADED GLOCK up

and out and -- Clay ducks left -- BACKHANDS HER with his

forearm -- sends her FLYING across the room -- PAUSE.

Both breathing hard. Staring at one another:

He foot-plants, spins, re-attacks and IT IS ON! INSANELY

VISCOUS: tearing the room to utter shreds. Fists

SMASHING. A FACE KICK, plaster SMASHES.

She HURLS a twenty six inch color TELEVISION at him.

This EXPLODES against a wall. Sparks give to flame as

the room starts to burn hot around these two warriors...

They continue to fight like RABID WOLVES. And they're

GRINNING. Enjoying this. THEN FREEZE --

AISHA ON TOP OF CLAY -- Each has a BUCK KNIFE up and tight

against the other's throat. Blades on skin. TIE GAME.

Neither giving. FLAMES AROUND THEM:

Clay spits blood and sucks air.

This clearly has effect on Clay - Substantial Effect.

Clay stares up at Aisha. FLAMES ALL AROUND THEM...

EXT. HOLLYWOOD, FL STREETS -- NIGHT

Clay and Aisha walk away from the BURNING MOTEL.

A FIRE ENGINE screams past them towards the burning hotel,

as if to illustrate her point.

She gives a little smile.

Clay nods.

Aisha just smiles.

He turns. Begins walking away. She calls out after him.

A beat as Clay stares at her, realizing...

Clay stares at her.

He holds up his hand.

He takes it. She hands him some papers along with it.

EXT. MEXICO - BEACH CAMPSITE - NIGHT

COUGAR chilling by a small fire. Working his way through

a bottle of tequila. His blackberry rings...

INT. VIRGINIA MOTEL - NIGHT

POOCH in a Motel 6 Laying in bed alone, watching an old

Jimmy Stewart movie. Blackberry rings...

INT. ARIZONA MOTEL - MOTEL

JENSEN's in bed with TWO GIRLS from his spin class.

Blackberry rings...

TIGHT ON THE THREE BLACKBERRY MESSAGES:

EXT. DELHI, INDIA - MIDDAY

The city midday is UTTERLY PACKED. Overflowing. The

capital of the next great Superpower. Delhi, India.

INT. DELHI, INDIA - OFFICE TOWER

A TOP FLOOR OFFICE SUITE of a high end technology company.

Degrees on the walls. A Bollywood musical BLARES from a

TV loud enough to cover up the SOUNDS OF BEGGING...

THREE INDIAN SCIENTISTS -- A short guy, a tall guy, and a

really fat guy -- On the floor, BOUND, terrified, looking

up at a tough looking bastard standing over them --

WADE. Our burly man from the safe-house. Now he works

for the suit in the brown French club chair. The Big

Man, Master of Disaster, Trouble on a Firestick... MAX.

Max takes a moment. Thinks.

Max nods to himself. He thought so.

Wade hauls him up the FAT SCIENTIST. Without hesitation,

he walks him over to the large glass window looking down

FIFTY THREE STORIES above Delhi and HURLS HIM OUT...

EXPLODING through the glass. As the poor bastard FALLS

AND SCREAMS... The other scientists scream at the sight.

Max turns to Wade, bewildered:

Max looks over at the cowering scientists.

Wade starts for the Short Scientist.

Wade stops.

Max and Wade are up and out...

INT. DELHI, INDIA - OFFICE TOWER CORRIDORS -- DAY

Max and Wade, striding towards the elevators. Passing

cubicles that Indian workers cower under - we realize

Max's heavily armed Henchmen had SEIZED THE ENTIRE FLOOR.

He snaps his fingers and the Henchman follow...

EXT. NEW ORLEANS - WAREHOUSE DISTRICT -- NIGHT

New Orleans. A non-descript warehouse among many.

INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

Large and empty. Clay and Roque take a look around it.

Roque studies Clay long and hard.

INTERRUPTED as a DOOR CREAKS OPEN - Clay and Roque

immediately have their PISTOLS OUT facing down an entering

COUGAR is with him. Clay and Roque lowers their weapons

and go to embrace them... Pooch BEAR-HUGS Roque. Cougar

nods to Clay.

From the SHADOWS:

The guys START as she emerges. All woman.

A beat as she takes this motley bunch in.

Another CREAK - Jensen enters.

The guys admire her form as she leaves. When she's gone:

A moment as this sinks in.

Clay nods. Looks to the others.

A beat. Pooch nodding:

Cougar nods his assent. Only one left. ROQUE. They all

turn to him. A beat.

Jensen smacks his fist on the table, excited:

EXT. FIJI - BLUE ISLAND SKY - DAY

A White Bell AB-139 CHOPPER glides into frame -- FLYING

over a small series of white sanded jungle islands...

LOOKING UP FROM ONE ISLAND:

HOWLER MONKEYS taunt-scream up as the chopper slow-circles

over the beautiful deserted island. Outer Fijian Islands.

INT. BELL AB-139 - SAME

Max wearing a Hawaiian shirt and Raybans. ZINC on his

nose, rubbing suntan lotion on his forearms. To Wade:

CAMERA DROPPING FAST out of the chopper -- SOARING DOWN

low -- TRACKING WITH a howler monkey up a PALM TREE --

Then airborne as the monkey leaps twenty feet to another.

We TRACK WITH our lead monkey up to something very un-

monkey like... Something SINISTER. A metallic, trunk-

like object. Flashing lights and transponder devices...

A half-millisecond breath. Then, UTTER DESTRUCTION!

A MULTI STAGED NUCLEAR SHRED BLAST -- Trees, earth, water

are sucked in then -- HURLED OUTWARDS in a series of SHOCK

WAVES and fire balls.

TSUNAMIS ERUPT, as the chopper shudders from the blast.

When the MUSHROOM CLOUD clears...

THE ENTIRE ISLAND IS GONE.

Stunned silence in the chopper. Then Max whoops like a

10 year old who's just seen the world's best fireworks

show.

Wade, not quite as enthused. Max notices. His face falls.

INT. HANGAR -- DAY

Max and Wade, stepping off the chopper as it powers down.

Max walks towards his office. Wade, calling after him:

Wade raises an eyebrow.

Max puts his hand on Wade's shoulder. Earnestly:

Max stalks away...

EXT. WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, NEW MEXICO - DAY

A US ARMY HUMVEE tears PAST CAMERA, just missing a couple

of freaked out jack rabbits blast-hopping for their lives.

On perimeter patrol at 80MPH down an endless desert road...

INT. BLACKED OUT COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

Jensen. Radio mic. His fingers rapid tap worn keys.

INT. ARMY HUMVEE - CONTINUOUS

Four patrol SOLDIERS. The driver throws a hard right...

EXT. ROUTE 70 - NEW MEXICO - LATER

A Kenworth Heavy pulled off to the side. Pooch works on

the front right tire. Sweating buckets in the desert

bake. The Humvee approaches. TWO SOLDIERS get out.

Pooch looks up from his tire.

EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - SAME

Fifty feet off the road. A brown blanket slowly rising...

REVEAL the long black barrel of a SNIPER RIFLE.

SCOPE POV -- Colors and graphics we've never seen before.

Cougar's got his own thing going on. More Jerry Garcia

than Tom Clancy. Soldier One's THROAT is smack dab in

the middle of it. CLOSE ON COUGAR'S TRIGGER FINGER:

Slight squeeze. Silenced weapon...

EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - BY THE TRUCK - SAME

Soldier One slaps at the burning sting in his neck.

He pulls a two inch TRANQ-DART off his neck.

The three other soldiers see the dart and LEAP out when...

FROM BEHIND THE TRUCK -- ROQUE rises ARMS OUT. Wedged in

each hand -- TWIN JET BLACK .45 CALIBER COLT STUN PISTOLS.

BLASTING AWAY... The soldiers stagger, twist and stumble

before succumbing to the Demerol. LIGHTS OUT.

INT. BLACKED OUT COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The sound of HEAVY IRON RELEASING as the WALLS START TO

SEPARATE, revealing we are INSIDE THE BROKEN-DOWN TRUCK.

Jensen taps into the military emergency band. Takes a

breath, centers himself, then...

Jensen, all smiles, looks up at Clay.

Pooch and Roque have the four drugged soldiers laid out

on the sand. All four are clearly breathing.

Clay steps off the trailer with a heavy duty air hoist.

TIGHT SHOTS of the air ram attached to the undercarriage

of the Humvee. The tires start to lift off the ground...

higher... Four pairs of hands start rocking the truck...

Pooch and Jensen, on one side. Quietly:

Pooch blinks, impressed. Then:

A FINAL PUSH... and the Humvee FLIPS. FROM JENSEN'S RADIO:

Jensen and Roque LIE ON THE GROUND by the flipped Humvee.

Clay leans against the truck. In the distance, the faint

outline of a massive DOUBLE ROTOR TROOP TRANSPORT CHOPPER.

INT. CHOPPER - NEW MEXICO SKY - SAME

Behind the pilot as he moves in on the accident scene...

EXT. CRASH SITE - NEW MEXICO DESERT - CONTINUOUS

Clay waves the chopper in. It lands on the road. TWO

EMTs leap out and race towards the fallen soldiers. The

first EMT kneels by Jensen.

Jensen pulls his COLT, presses it up into the EMT's GUT.

INT. CHOPPER COCKPIT - SAME

The two pilots wait behind full reflective face shields

CLACK-CLACK. The pilots turn as TWO MACHINE GUNS jam up

on them from out of the darkness. Pooch and Cougar.

TRANQ-TRANQ! The Pilots slump. Pooch, to Cougar:

Clay pops his head in:

Pooch reaches in and rips the chopper's TRANSPONDER OFF...

EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - LATER

THE CHOPPER, now UNDER A TARP on the back of the truck

trailer. The TRANSPONDER, strapped to a SMALL ROCKET...

Jensen FIRES THE ROCKET. The transponder takes off...

FROM THE CHOPPER'S RADIO:

Pooch gets up behind the wheel.

The team gets into the big double cab. Pooch fires up

the engine and the heave rig tears out onto the highway...

AFTER THEY'RE GONE -- On one of the drugged soldiers.

Trying to sit up. He looks around. WIDE: Seven soldiers

out cold on the side of the road... Alone.

INT. NEW ORLEANS WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

Our guys are prepping. Pooch and Clay check out maps.

Cougar, in full face mask, spray paints something big.

Aisha sits, watching in silence. Jensen approaches her.

Aisha, never taking her eyes off the chopper:

A beat.

He departs. Aisha stands, walking over to the chopper.

Clay and Pooch look at the new girl.

Roque steps forward.

He PULLS a DESERT EAGLE and LEVELS IT at Aisha's skull.

Aisha just smiles. Clay, more annoyed than worried:

Roque stares at Aisha. Neither backing down.

He thumbs back the hammer... A TENSE MOMENT... And then

Roque lowers the gun.

With that, she turns and walks away into the shadows.

Roque lowers the weapon. A beat. To Clay:

Clay doesn't reply. A pall, cast over the guys. Finally:

Silence, as the guys take this in. Then, from the corner:

EXT. NEW ORLEANS -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

SWOOPING DOWN over the waterways, threading our way between

buildings, past the islands slamming into

EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT, NEW ORLEANS

A G-550, tire chalked. A fork lift removes a large VAULT-

LIKE PACKAGE from the back of the plane -- THE CARGO.

A fifteen ton ATTACK-STABILIZED CASH TRANSPORT RIG idles,

surrounded by TWENTY ASSAULT TROOPERS, loading up. Machine

guns, frag grenades, body armor.

BY THE JET -- WADE and FENNEL, our briefcase bomb friends,

talks with a G. Gordon Liddy wrinkle muscleman.

As the package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG...

Ten rock hard WARRIORS in a beefed up chase van.

EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY

The two truck armored convoy pulls out of the private

airport and passes a parked TOWN CAR...

INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

Clay, Roque, and Jensen watch the armored trucks pass by.

Roque has a silenced long gun out as the second truck

passes. As Roque PULLS THE TRIGGER...

EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

A silenced AIR BLAST -- we TRAVEL FAST with Roque's

ordinance -- SMACKING SILENT onto the rear bumper of the

lead truck. A ballistic, putty-coated recon tracker.

INT. TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS

Jensen's laptop GPS goes hot. Green dot indicates CONVOY.

Clay fires up the Town Car and follows.

AERIAL -- LOOKING DOWN as the armored cars head towards

the city. TILT UP to reveal the CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION --

eight suspended lanes spanning the Mighty Mississippi...

EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION

HIGH ANGLE -- Looking down at the bridge traffic. Sliding

into frame, buckle-harnessed and very armed --

TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND. Lashed into a BRIDGE

SUPPORT. He racks the bolt of his NTW-20 ANTI MATERIAL

RIFLE - a monster of a weapon with a bulky starlight scope.

As the FIRST SWAT TRUCK reaches the center of the BRIDGE --

Cougar FIRES --

And everything begins happening very fast.

The SWAT TRUCK'S nearside front wheel EXPLODES, blown

clear off the axle mount --

The wheel spins away, bounces wild, smashes a windshield --

INT. SWAT TRUCK -- FRONT CAB -- DAY

The Driver, wrestling with the wheel...

The Truck SLEWS sideways -- PLOWS into a car! The Driver

SLAMS the truck in reverse, FLOORS IT --

EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY

Cougar FIRES AGAIN -- the other front wheel DETONATES,

and the truck's nose SLAMS down on the asphalt GRINDING

SPARKS! Going nowhere fast...

THE CHASE VAN

Screeches to a hard stop behind. SECURITY CREW OUT --

WEAPONS RAISED -- taking up DEFENSIVE POSITIONS. Ice

cold professionals.

EXT. TOWN CAR

Now at the entrance to the bridge. Roque smiles as he

hefts an MGL-40 GRENADE LAUNCHER. FIRING...

BY THE CONVOY

THICK TEAR GAS EXPLODES in dark blues, billowing across

traffic. SECURITY MEN CHOKE, lost in the SMOKE...

COUGAR pumps a round into the EMPTY CHASE VAN -- Armor-

glass BLASTING APART, showering the roadway -- Fennel

DIVES for cover, PANICKING -- Lifts the radio to his lips:

ROQUE fires another TEAR GAS GRENADE into the melee --

CIVILIANS running and screaming -- TOTAL PANDEMONIUM --

As the CHASE VAN is BLOWN APART behind them! Fennel trying

to orient through smoke and gas. Then, a NEW SOUND...

DEEP RUMBLING. Thick bass vibrations...

The thick tear gas being blown aside by the thunderous

twin-rotor downwash of a CHINOOK HEAVY LIFT CHOPPER!

It bellies in low, the boarding ramp already lowering...

Wade crouch-runs to the SWAT TRUCK, HAMMERING the rear

The doors BURST OPEN and the SWAT Team CRASH-ROLLS the

precious CARGO CRATE towards the Chinook's boarding ramp --

INT./EXT. CHINOOK HELICOPTER -- DAY

SWAT Guys laying down point cover as their comrades hustle

the crate into the Chinook's WINDOWLESS HOLD. The ramp

RISING as Fennel dives onboard as well...

BY THE CONVOY

Wade makes a "take off" sign to the Chinook pilot who

flips him a salute as THE CHINOOK LIFTS INTO THE AIR...

The ramp closing. The team and cargo safely aboard...

EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- UPPER SUPERSTRUCTURE

Passing Cougar's sniper-harness, which now HANGS EMPTY.

Twisting in the wind.

As we hear the rotors fade into the distance...

EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY

Wade slumps against the burnt out wreckage of the chase

van. Sighing in relief. SILENCE. His radio crackles:

As a HORRIFIED LOOK OF REALIZATION crosses Wade's face

and he stares up into the sky...

INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- DAY

The SWAT Guys pull off their masks and high-five. They

think they kicked ass. Fennel, reaching for the cockpit

door handle... He can't turn it.

INT. CHINOOK COCKPIT -- DAY

We hear the FAINT YELLING of Fennel and the Swat Guys in

the hold. The Chinook Pilot flips up his goggles to reveal --

It's POOCH! AISHA sitting co-pilot. Both grinning as

they hear the protestations from behind them...

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EVENING

The middle of nowhere. A small clearing. Skeeters and

crickets harmonize. Clay waits with Jensen and Roque.

THE CHINOOK crests the tree line. Hovers above...

INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- EVENING

Fennel and the SWAT Guys try to maintain balance and

personal dignity as they stumble and fall all over each

other... The chopper SETS DOWN. The men gather

themselves. Weapons up. Checking clips, safeties off.

EXT. CHINOOK -- EVENING

Aisha clambers onto the Chinook's hull, clutching a RUBBER

HOSE. Screws the end to an inlet valve marked "FIRE

RETARDANT SYSTEM". Looks down at Clay. With a grin:

TIGHT ON a 3-inch turn valve. Hard hands grab and open...

INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- EVENING

Cut off as a CLEAR LIQUID begins to rain down on them

from the SPRINKLER SYSTEM...

Their EYES GO WIDE...

HYDRAULICS WHINE. The RAMP LOWERS. The gas drenched

soldiers BURST OUT, weapons up. Squinting through the

fumes...

CLAY STANDS ALONE. The men fan out around him. Multiple

rifles TRAINED AT HIS HEAD from every direction. Fennel

blinks, surprised to see him alive. Nevertheless:

Clay calmly LIGHTS A CIGARETTE. TIGHT ON THE BURNING

CHERRY: The soldiers, wide eyed...

AS THAT SINKS IN -- Fennel looks like his puppy just died.

GASOLINE DRIPS from the muzzle of his own tooled up H&K

G36 assault rifle... Clay takes a long smooth drag.

A beat... and then the fight just goes out of the SWAT

Team. They DROP THEIR GUNS and RAISE THEIR HANDS...

Clay steps up to him. Near nose to nose.

WHAP! Clay's fist to Fennel's jaw. Knocking him cold.

TIGHT ON FENNEL as he and the Team sit bound and gagged

in the back of the Chinook. As the ramp rises, he shoots

panicked glances to Clay. The ramp closes between them.

Clay turns back to

THE CRATE on the ground in front of our guys. Pooch and

Cougar hydro-pop the locks. OPEN TO REVEAL an interior

crate. Smaller, polished steel. A TEN DIGIT numeric

KEYPAD on top, and a LOGO STAMPED on the side - GOLIATH.

Clay looks to Aisha.

Pooch hefts a tire iron. Smacking it into his palm.

He jacks his laptop into the keypad. A few keystrokes

and HISSSSSSS...

The second crate opens...

Revealing a THERMO-NUCLEAR WARHEAD.

Our guys stand there. COMPLETELY STUNNED. Silence.

The TIMER display BLINKS ON and begins COUNTING BACK --

59, 58, 57...

Jensen blinks. Still in shock...

46, 45, 44...

Pooch, staring at the warhead warily.

Aisha and Pooch with drills POP THE SCREWS. Lifting the

casing off the bomb housing - looking down at the

MULITITUDE OF COLORED WIRES...

25, 24, 23...

He's typing like the damn wind now -- IMAGES on his laptop,

FLYING PAST as he HACKS THE D.O.D...

15, 14, 13...

His screen, FROZEN.

9, 8, 7...

No way. They're fucked.

With no other options POOCH DOES. The clock, STILL GOING:

3, 2, 1...

The end of the wires FIZZLE. Then NOTHING.

SILENCE.

And then Roque PULLS HIS GUN. Levelling it at Aisha:

Clay TURNS SUDDENLY, stalking towards the Chinook...

INT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- NIGHT

The Losers stand around Fennel, who's been CRYING. Urine

stain on his pants. Sniveling, spilling his guts rapidly:

Clay JAMS A GUN to his temple...

BLAM! Clay FIRES - INCHES FROM Fennel's HEAD! Fennel

They stare down at him in disbelief...

A beat as our guys take this in.

Our guys exchange looks...

Fennel goes even paler.

Fennel goes pale when he sees Clay MOVE TOWARD HIM:

Clay plasters DUCT TAPE over Fennel's mouth. Stepping

outside the Chinook. The others, going with him...

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- NIGHT

The Warhead, still sitting there. Nobody speaks for a

bit. Then:

Roque stares at him.

He gestures to the WARHEAD. Clay, shocked.

Roque blinks at Clay's abruptness. Pissed.

WHAP! Clay throws a STRAIGHT RIGHT to Roque's jaw! Roque,

surprised and staggered by the blow... Then he SMILES

through the blood, DRAWING A KNIFE:

This got serious quick. Pooch steps between them.

A really dangerous beat...

Clay and Roque, full on eyefucking one another...

On Aisha - she seems to be DIGGING IT... Broken by:

Cougar nods.

Silence. Roque, ODD MAN OUT. His fingers tighten around

the handle of the knife...

A long beat... and Roque slides the knife back into it's

SCABBARD. Clay, staring at him:

He stalks away. Roque glowers. Heads the other direction.

Cougar grunts in response.

On Aisha. A smile forming...

INT. NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY

The DESK SERGEANT sips a cup of coffee. Doing the Sunday

crossword. Poorly. A quiet afternoon...

A HUB-BUB outside. Rising voices.

The Sergeant rises, and we follow him through the station

towards the front doors. Moving faster and more nervously

as the NOISE OUTSIDE GROWS. Finally stepping out into

EXT. NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY

The street where a CROWD has gathered. Lookie-loos with

camcorders. The Sergeant pushes through them to find

FENNEL. Eyes wide with fear. DUCT TAPED TO THE WARHEAD.

A SIGN hangs around his neck that reads Death to America!

in big cheery letters and has a SMILEY FACE on it...

INT. SMOKED UP ASIAN BAR -- BACK ROOM -- DAY

The image of FENNEL tied to the bomb, broadcast on the

THAI NEWS on a black and white TV. Wade squints at it.

Wade shrugs and slides some PHOTOS across the table to

him. SCREEN-GRABS from TRAFFIC CAMERAS -- CLAY, ROQUE,

and JENSEN in the towncar during the heist. A long beat...

A beat.

Wade heads for the door...

Wade turns back. Max, SMILING:

INT. NORTH DELHI - PRIVATE HANGAR - DAY

Wade waits as FOUR INDIAN MEN climb out of LIMO. The

first we recognize as one of the scientists that Wade did

not throw out the window. The other three: INDIAN TOUGH

GUYS. The scientist got smart, brought some MUSCLE.

Small smile from Wade.

Wade stares at the scientist.

And he smiles...

EXT. HIGHWAY - NORTH OF DELHI - LATER

Wade drives in a Jeep, heading back to the city.

INTERCUT WITH MAX in the SMOKED UP ASIAN BAR:

That's a lot of a paper routes...

Can we swing it?

Not even close.

The Company?

Won't give it to us willingly...

You get that six man team together

like I asked?

Yeah.

Change of plans. Kill them.

Kill them?

Or fire them, whichever's easier.

Honestly? Firing them.

Fine, fine, I'm not a detail guy.

What I need- wait. Did you give

them intel on Clay's people?

Well, yeah.

Aaaand we're back to killing them.

Fine, I'll kill them - what are we

doing instead?

INT. OUTSIDE HOUSTON - BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOF - NIGHT

Clay. Sitting on his bed. Shirt off. Going over

schematics - GOLIATH WORLD HEADQUARTERS. A KNOCK on Clay's

door. He gets up, checks the eye hole. Opens it. AISHA.

She looks at him. Sexual. Predatory.

She steps into the room towards him. Reaching for her:

EXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY -- NIGHT

Clay and Aisha. After. Looking out at the city.

Clay looks over at her. Down at the TEDDY BEAR tattoo...

And shakes his head.

She traces her fingers over it...

Aisha, taken aback by the suddenness of the question.

A beat. She looks at him.

Aisha smiles at this. Shaking her head.

That takes Clay off guard. Looking out at the city.

Aisha, side-stepping the question:

Aisha studies him.

She looks at him.

INT. VAN -- MORNING

Idling. Blacked out windows. Pooch behind the wheel,

Cougar shotgun, Roque in back. Back door slides open and

Clay and Aisha enter. Together. It doesn't go unnoticed.

That's it. Fed up, Pooch SHUTS THE ENGINE like dad in

the family truckster.

Pooch takes the keys out of the ignition and folds his

arms. Clay sighs. Looks over to Roque. A beat. Then:

A longer beat...

EXT DOWNTOWN HOUSTON -- DAY

Houston, Texas. ESTABLISHING: Skyscrapers. One large

one stands out -- The GOLIATH HEADQUARTERS TOWER.

JENSEN heads towards the building. Street bicycle, bike

shorts, messenger bag. He's disguised as a Bike Messenger.

INT. GOLIATH TOWER -- RECEPTION -- DAY

Jensen enters the reception area singing. Moves to the

receptionist desk. A PRETTY RECEPTIONIST answering phones.

He looks down at the Receptionist...

The Receptionist looks up. She's on the phone, distracted:

The Receptionist looks up at Jensen, not particularly

amused. She points towards the elevators.

INT. ELEVATOR -- GOLIATH TOWER -- CONTINUOUS

TIGHT ON JENSEN as the elevator doors close on him.

DOORS CLOSE.

INT. ELEVATOR / HENDERSON'S OFFICE - GOLIATH TOWER

Alone, Jensen opens the messenger bag. REVEAL A SUIT.

Pre-set, ready to slide on over his bike clothes. Dials

a cell phone while he dresses super fast.

INTERCUT WITH HENDERSON'S OFFICE:

A SECRETARY sitting in the outer office.

JENSEN - DRESSING IN THE ELEVATOR:

JENSEN, PANTSLESS, as the elevator STOPS. The 25th FLOOR.

The DOORS OPEN. Two SECRETARIES about to enter the

elevator freeze at the sight of PANTSLESS JENSEN.

The ladies stare at Jensen. He calculates their gazes.

DOORS SHUT before they can protest...

INT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE

HENDERSON, a middle aged mid-level manager reaches for

his phone as the secretary looks on from her desk.

INTERCUT WITH JENSEN IN ELEVATOR

Jensen is just about dressed.

EXT. HALLWAY BY ELEVATORS -- CONTINUOUS

Henderson plods into his elevator. As the DOORS CLOSE on

his elevator, the DOORS OPEN on the SECOND ELEVATOR.

JENSEN, suited and pressed, steps out. Briefcase in hand.

INT. HENDERSON'S OUTER OFFICE

Jensen enters, looking down at Henderson's secretary.

Jensen checks his watch. Big sigh.

Jensen, already moving into HENDERSON'S OFFICE:

INT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE

QUICK TIGHT SHOTS OF JENSEN doing what Jensen does best:

Tearing into Henderson's computer. FROWNING...

Henderson's secretary reaching for her phone...

BACK IN HENDERSON'S OFFICE:

Jensen checking his download. Smiles at the Secretary,

then looks back to he screen. Pressing his RADIO

EARPIECE...

INTERCUT WITH THE VAN: Clay shoots a look at Roque.

FROM BEHIND JENSEN:

Jensen turns. He's face to face with a solid looking

SECURITY OFFICER. He tries a smile:

Jensen stands up, holding his briefcase.

WHAM! Jensen SMASHES his metal briefcase across the

security guard's face! The guard is unconscious before

he hits the ground. Keying his RADIO EARPIECE:

Jensen, heading for it...

Jensen slow turns to find THREE GUNS trained straight at

him. Major security. These guys look extremely competent.

Jensen turns on the big fellah.

Big Security moves in on Jensen with a pair of handcuffs.

Jensen RAISES HIS RIGHT HAND at the guard. Fingers cocked

like a gun aimed at the guard's Kevlar covered vest.

The guard is HIT HARD, BLASTED BACKWARDS off his feet!

Screaming in pain, he goes down. Jensen spins, aims his

left fingers at the SECOND GUARD...

...and the second guard is blown backwards too, KEVLAR

VEST SMOKING. Moaning:

Jensen - Fingers levelled at the THIRD GUARD...

TIGHT ON JENSEN: Full Dirty Harry.

They comply. Jensen looks down at them. Smiles. Then

slowly turns looking out the FLOOR TO CEILING GLASS

WINDOWS. Makes the "OK" sign out the window.

TIGHT ON THE CIRCLE OF JENSEN'S OK FINGER SIGN:

Three tight bullet holes in the glass. SMASH ZOOM out

the window, 500 yards to a neighboring office tower...

INT. NEIGHBORING OFFICE BUILDING - HOUSTON - SAME

Rifle, still smoking. Hat low, the ever vigilant COUGAR.

INT. HANGAR OFFICE -- DAY

Max, on the phone. SPEAKING JAPANESE. Wade pokes his

head in. Hands him a note -- GOLIATH JUST GOT HIT.

Max cups his hand over the receiver, as the voice on the

other end prattles on. To Wade:

There's something in his voice. Max looks at him.

Intrigued. Holds up a finger - let me finish up here.

INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY

The team gathers around as Jensen downloads the Goliath

security specs off his computer.

Aisha's brow furrows at this. Only we notice.

Jensen spins the laptop around to show them GRAPHICS OF

Jensen, typing:

Jensen looks up at them. Softly:

A beat. This clearly means something bad to all of them.

Cougar just glowers.

Silence as they ponder the significance of a Par Sec

security force.

Silence.

INT. BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Clay's room again. Knock at the door again. Aisha again.

She covers his mouth with hers...

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Jensen and Pooch sitting at a table. Both with laptops.

Jensen tapping his keys. Roque enters, carrying a coffee.

Stops short, seeing the others. Surprised.

He slides into a chair.

Pooch shows him the screen of his computer - RECORDED

VIDEO from earlier in the day. An OVERHEAD VIEW of a

Playground - POOCH'S DAUGHTERS PLAYING. They both watch

for a bit. The only sound, Jensen's typing. Then:

A moment between them. Broken by:

HE TRAILS OFF IN SHOCK. Looking to Pooch and Roque:

INT. BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Clay and Aisha, in bed. After. She traces her fingers

along his Teddy Bear tattoo. Clay looks down at her.

She gives him a smile. Mixing just the right amount of

sensitivity and curiosity...

INT. VAN (MOVING) -- NIGHT

As Pooch TEARS through the Texas streets:

INT. BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Clay blinks.

Aisha smiles, trying to recover but --

WHAM! The door SPLINTERS INWARDS and --

Roque and Pooch behind him, GUNS DRAWN. Aisha's hand

dips into her purse and comes up with a GUN faster than

you can spit -- MEXICAN STAND-OFF TIME:

Aisha ADJUSTS, pointing it at his head. As she does, the

bedsheet falls away from her UPPER BODY.

We don't see the goods, but our guys in the doorway do.

Nobody breathes. And then...

Jensen's eyes FLICK DOWNWARD. Just for a millisecond but

Aisha pulls the trigger.

BOOM! Jensen, falls back screaming, HIT IN THE SHOULDER --

Aisha, moving and firing, running for the bathroom nude --

The guys UNLOADING AT HER -- she dives through the doorway --

HOLES PUNCHED IN THE WALL behind Clay's head as she RETURNS

FIRE through the drywall -- Clay, diving to the floor

below the crossfire -- Aisha kicks the BATHROOM DOOR SHUT --

And suddenly EVERYONE'S RELOADING.

Silence as clips are slapped into weapons until...

TAPS HIS EAR. They stop. Listening... CHOPPERS.

Clay pulls on his pants and they run for the door...

EXT. MOTEL -- SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT

...smack into COUGAR who points into the sky -- TWO HEAVILY

ARMED COBRAS, searchlights on, headed for the motel. And

again with that one important word:

The FIRST COBRA OPENS UP with it's AUTOMATIC CANNON. The

BULLETS CHEWING UP the far side of the CHEAP TWO STORY

MOTEL! Our guys VAULT the railing, sprinting to the van...

INT. VAN -- NIGHT

POOCH, sliding behind the wheel as the others pile in...

Pooch hits the gas before his door is even shut. As they

PEEL OUT of the PARKING LOT -- The STRAFING hits the GAS

MAIN -- WHOOMP! Half the motel SWALLOWED in a FIREBALL...

Roque, looking out the back window:

Sure enough, the COBRAS are now tracking the VAN.

Spotlights, swinging towards them...

The asphalt behind them ERUPTS. CANNON-FIRE blowing HUGE

CHUNKS OF ROAD into the sky! SCREAMING over the SOUND:

Cougar HEFTS HIS RIFLE. Setting up shop in the back.

Sighting the choppers through his scope. Jensen, excited,

and a little delirious from blood loss:

THROUGH THE SCOPE -- Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the

chopper on the left... Smiles, PRESSES THE TRIGGER...

And we see how one bullet can bring down two helicopters.

The bullet strikes the tail rotor DEAD CENTER -- it SHORTS

and spins off -- sending the chopper itself into a spin --

COLLIDING with it's TWIN CHOPPER on the right -- they

both twist and hink up -- their ROTORS SLICING INTO EACH

OTHER -- both FINALLY CAREENING ONTO THE FREEWAY BEHIND

Our guys. Driving away from the carnage of two exploding

Cobra Helicopters splattered across the road...

Safe.

EXT. LEAR JET 550 (FLYING) -- DAY

Coming in for LANDING...

INT. LEAR JET 550 -- DAY

As it taxis towards a HANGAR. Max straightens his suit.

Wade on the phone, frowning. Bad news. He flips the

phone shut. To Max:

He claps Wade and the shoulder and heads down the steps...

INT. HANGAR -- DAY

...where the TWO INDIAN SCIENTISTS wait. The Indian THUG

CREW has been beefed-up to about TEN BIZARRE LOOKING,

BLACK SUITED TOUGH GUYS.

Max smiles and spreads his arms...

Max looks over to Wade.

As he turns back to the plane...

A PAUSE as Max contemplates this little twist.

Max looks at Wade.

Wade heads for the jet. Max watches him go. As Wade

boards the jet Max takes a big sigh. For the first time,

looks like a guy who might not be quite as sure of things

as he would like. Max Looks back to the Short Scientist.

The Short Scientist points to a large flatbed pick-up. A

HEAVY TARPED BOMB LIKE PACKAGE strapped to the back.

INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY STORE -- NIGHT

After business hours. A WINDOW SMASHES. Roque climbs

inside. Goes to the front and unlocks it for the others,

who carry a BLEEDING JENSEN in. They lay him on a table.

Cougar nods. Gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a WOODEN

DOWEL. Comes over as Jensen looks at the last one.

Cougar SHOVES IT BETWEEN JENSEN'S TEETH as an answer...

Clay doesn't respond...

His words echo through the room.

JENSEN SCREAMS through the dowel as Cougar sews him up...

This is how low they've sunk. Clay finally looks up.

Clay turns to him.

Silence. Then:

A beat.

He turns, addressing all of them:

He looks Clay dead in the eye.

A long beat. Clay, not breaking his look with Roque:

Roque smiles. Pooch blinks.

Cougar nods. He's in.

He gives a weak thumbs-up. In. All that's left is

Pooch, struggling with the decision...

A beat. Pooch looks up.

EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR -- DAWN

ESTABLISHING. The harbor is enormous. A small TWIN

HURRICANE BOAT cuts through the morning waves. Half mile

from the Goliath docks. At the controls, Clay and Roque.

THROUGH CLAY'S BINOCULARS:

GOLIATH EMPLOYEES going about their business, preparing

for a tanker docking. All seems normal until we look a

bit closer: FOUR-MAN Par Sec security patrols. Bomb

sniffing DOGS. Two Cobra ATTACK CHOPPERS.

A GOLIATH TANKER approaches from behind. Roque looks

back at the tanker. Not answering - he seems to have

something on his mind.

Clay drops the twin throttles and spins the speed boat

towards the APPROACHING TANKER. Several TUGS and SECURITY

LAUNCHES are maneuvering around it...

INT. SECURITY LAUNCH - NEW YORK HARBOR

Clay and Roque approach one of the launches from behind.

Climbing aboard. They take the two SECURITY MEN from

behind with TASERS, then strip off their outer gear,

revealing PAR-SEC UNIFORMS.

EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - PERIMETER STREET

A block off the front gate. A blacked out Chevy van.

Pooch sits behind the wheel. Ready for exfiltration.

EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - SHORELINE

A drainage pipe with a thick security cage covering it.

We PUSH IN HARD, reveal a small opening cut in the cage

it -- THROUGH the opening -- FIRE 70 FEET into the pipe --

through a second opening -- down another long pipe and

SLAM UP HARD ON COUGAR. Crouched BELOW the terminal.

Looking up through a grilled man hole at Par-sec Guards.

EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR

Clay and Roque dock their Launch and hop out. Blending

in perfectly with the Par-Sec Guards.

INT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM - SAME

A huge shipping room with hundreds of crates. We push in

on a LARGE WOODEN CRATE. The side of the crate STARTS TO

FLEX... and SPLINTERS as Jensen breaks out of his box!

INT. / EXT. GOLIATH - SHIPPING ROOM DOOR

Clay and Roque approach. Knock. From the inside, Jensen

leaning up against the door.

Jensen opens the door. Clay and Roque quickly move in.

Jensen nods. Knows how important his job is. Heading

for a ladder. Clay and Roque begin to set CHARGES

throughout the room...

EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - DAY

Cougar avoiding security. SCALING A LARGE OIL TANK, taking

up a sniper position on top of it...

ACROSS THE TERMINAL

Jensen hopping rooftop to rooftop...

Cougar in full sniper fire position. His sights dead on:

A MASTER FIRE ALARM -- 300 yards down. His RADIO CRACKLES:

EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - PERIMETER STREET

Pooch in the van, seeing through BINOCULARS...

And he is. Being given a TOUR by PAR-SEC GUARDS...

INT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM

EXT. GOLIATH ROOFTOPS

Jensen, by a MIRRORED SKYLIGHT (so you can't see down

into the room). Attaching a HARNESS to his waist...

INT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM

Clay, listening through the radio:

FROM OFF CAMERA:

Roque, standing in front of a HUGE CARGO CONTAINER.

Roque's got the doors of the container opened that he's

looking in. Clay approaches...

EXT. ROOFTOP

Jensen, finally ready to hit the computer room, GENUFLECTS

once for luck...

INT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM

Clay and Roque staring...

THE CONTAINER -- Top to bottom, completely loaded with

fresh minted stack BUNDLES OF CASH. More physical money

than we have ever seen. By a lot. Ever. Then:

Clay turns to him as -- WHAM! -- a CROWBAR SMASHES DOWN

on his head! Roque, gripping it, looking down at Clay...

EXT. ROOFTOP

Jensen, leaping through the SKYLIGHT... SMASHING DOWN

through the GLASS...

INT. "COMPUTER ROOM"

...And landing in an EMPTY ROOM.

No computers. No stand-alone drives. No nothing. Except

for PAR-SEC GUARDS with weapons trained at his head...

INT. CHEVY VAN - GOLIATH TERMINAL

Pooch sitting in the van, into the radio:

Does not see the FIVE PAR-SEC SOLDIERS moving in on his

car, long guns up and out...

EXT. GOLIATH OIL TANK - SAME

Cougar flexed and aimed. Scope locked in on the fire

alarm... CLICK! Safety off on a gun pressed to his

temple. Fuck. He LAYS DOWN THE GUN and puts his hands

behind his head. Furious at himself for GETTING CAUGHT...

INT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

From the shadows, WADE ENTERS. Clay looks up at him.

Head wounds bleed bad. The crowbar caused a mother of a

gusher on Clay. He wipes blood from his eyes. Manages:

He begins walking around Clay as he talks.

Wade BEGINS LAUGHING. Clay looks like he's been slapped.

Clay stares at him.

Roque straightens back up, shaking his head:

In the corner, Wade nods at this. Behind him, A LARGE

SEMI pulls up to the CASH CONTAINER. Over the following,

a hydraulic lift hoists the cash container onto the truck:

He nods to the HYDRO-WINCH slowly lowering the CASH

CONTAINER onto the flat bed, with a smile...

Clay stares at daggers at both of them.

Several Par-Sec Guards arrive. Wade points to Clay:

The Guards handcuff Clay and drag him to his feet. Pushing

him towards the door. As he hustled past Roque:

They stop. Roque looks at his old friend.

Clay stares back at him.

The guards hustle Clay out the door...

EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - DAY

PAR-SEC GUARDS lead the Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar towards

the far end of the terminal. Each, bound. Cougar looks

up to see a separate set of Guards leading CLAY the

opposite way. Their eyes connect - both knowing:

They've lost.

Cougar lowers his head, sadly. Clay's pushed into A TRUCK.

Gone.

The Guards take Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar BEHIND A

WAREHOUSE. Looking at each other. Knowing, this is the

end of the line. The Lead Guard RACKS HIS MACHINE GUN.

Pooch SPITS AT HIM. The Lead Guard calmly SHOOTS HIM in

BOTH LEGS!

Pooch SCREAMS. Falls. The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and

Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch

looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:

The Lead Guard smiles. Looks to Cougar, who's shredding

his skin to the bone trying to claw out of the cuffs...

He steps forward to take it, but Cougar is too quick for

the man, MOVING HIS HEAD AWAY. He reaches for Cougar

again. Again, Cougar evades. The guards laugh at their

colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat.

The Lead Guard has had enough of Cougar's antics.

Levelling the rifle at his head...

Cougar's nods past him...

As the Guards turn to see ON TOP OF AN OIL TANK...

As she rises up to standing, A SLANT-K 600 ROCKET HIP

BLASTER locked and loaded. Looking like an Old Testament

style Goddess of Vengeance and Destruction. A moment of

FROZEN SHOCK on the rest of Wade's Hit Crew...

And she pulls the trigger. A HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE as

THE ROCKET STREAKS across the Terminal! Headed straight

for an ENORMOUS FUEL TANK...

KA-BOOM! The explosion ROCKS THE ENTIRE TERMINAL...

INT. TRUCK (MOVING)

The Truck Clay is prisoner in is BLOWN INTO THE AIR by

the SHOCKWAVE... SMASHING down onto it's side, skidding...

EXT. BY THE WAREHOUSE

Cougar and Jensen DESTROY the remaining Par-Secs with

legs. Grabbing cuff keys and freeing themselves.

WHAM! Cougar kicks the Guard in the face, knocking him

cold. Aisha rappels off the Oil Tower in the distance.

VARIOUS PAR-SEC TEAMS fire at her! Cougar scoops up two

rifles and tosses one to Jensen - they give her covering

fire as she comes! As he shoots, to the wounded Pooch:

He empties a full clip into a Par-Sec team and reloads...

AISHA -- Pinned down forty yards away. Almost out of

AMMO. Par-Sec Team, almost on top of her when

A FIGURE emerges from an OVERTURNED TRUCK. GUN in each

hand, BLAZING. The Par-Secs cut down one by one. The

figure lowers his guns. Desert Eagles. Walks up to her.

Underneath the blood, oil, and grime, it's

CLAY. They stare at each other...

Then, incredibly, Aisha RAISES HER WEAPON AT HIM.

Jensen comes running up, interrupting:

Aisha's had enough, thumbing the hammer back:

Clay, about to respond when:

They turn to see our LONG TALL SNIPER standing above them.

And then, incredibly, Cougar lays his rifle at her feet.

SURRENDERING...

Clay and Jensen blink, shocked. Aisha stares at Cougar,

equally surprised. She levels her pistol AT HIS HEAD...

Silence. We CUT WIDE to see...

A GUNSHOT. Muzzle flash from Aisha's gun. COUGAR FALLS...

In close again. Aisha stands over Cougar's body.

The others, stunned... And then Cougar rises. Face

BLOODY. Cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased

his flesh. She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM!

Identical scar on his other cheek. Blood runs down his

face. He doesn't move to wipe it away.

Cougar nods. Leans down, picks up his rifle. Debt paid.

As if on cue, BULLETS kick up DUST around them! A new

Par-Sec team, incoming. Clay, Jensen, Aisha, and Cougar

hightail it back to where Pooch lies.

Clay slings Pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style.

Looks across the Terminal to where Pooch's van is parked.

PUSH IN on Clay's face for:

And they do. Sprinting across the open space IN SLO-MO,

Cougar and Aisha WASTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. A full

on ballet of fully automatic mayhem...

They make it to the van! Piling in! Cougar behind the

wheel GUNS THE ENGINE and they PEEL OUT...

INT. VAN (MOVING) -- NIGHT

Pulling on to the HIGHWAY. Silence sets in. The high of

the firefight, over. Just pain and loss now.

Five people, some terribly wounded, with nowhere to go.

Just the rocking of the van as it heads down the road.

Silence.

Clay looks at him.

Clay doesn't respond. Aisha studies him. Nods. Knows

what has to be done. They all do. From behind the wheel:

Clay looks up at the use of rank...

EXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP -- NIGHT

Wade pulls up in a Corvette. Gets out and walks over as

Roque finishes supervising Par-Sec guards finish loading

the CASH onto a HUGE TRANSPORT PLANE.

Roque nods.

Roque considers. Then:

Wade half smiles at this. Shaking his head.

He begins walking towards HANGAR...

CRACK! As the FENCE by the AIRSTRIP is SMASHED INWARDS

by the Van! Headed straight for him! Clay, WAVING:

BY THE PLANE

Roque turns to the Pilot:

BY THE HANGAR

WADE raises his UZI and FIRES - Taking out the Van's front

tires! THE VAN Flips! Smashing end over end, finally

coming to a rest on it's side! Climbing out, groaning:

Clay looks across the tarmac to see the plane begin to

Taxi. ROQUE stands in they back - loading ramp still

down. FLIPS CLAY A SALUTE...

Aisha is heading off to the fenceline... Clay and Cougar

run for Wade's CORVETTE. Cougar slides behind the wheel

and starts her up, PEELING OUT after the plane...

ON THE RUNWAY

Cougar guns the engine, catching up to the TAXIING

TRANSPORT PLANE. Clay leans out the window, shooting at

Huddled in the plane's CARGO HOLD, RETURNING FIRE. The

PILOT, yelling to him.

He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette!

CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.

IN THE CORVETTE -- SIMULTANEOUSLY, Clay, WEAPON DRY.

He stares through the windshield to look at Roque.

INT. HANGAR -- NIGHT

Jensen enters, carrying a MACHINE GUN.

The ROAR of an engine -- Jensen DIVES out of the way as

Wade WHIPS PAST on a MOTORCYCLE! Heading for the runway!

He trails off. Looking at THE LEAR JET that Wade arrived

in. Sitting in the Hangar's Corner. Keys the radio...

EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY

The Corvette, pulling behind the still lowered REAR RAMP

of the TRANSPORT PLANE! Clay, onto the CORVETTE'S HOOD...

Roque, rising to meet him. Waiting for him...

Clay JUMPS! Landing on the ramp!

IN THE CARGO HOLD - Roque smiles. Pulls a WICKED LOOKING

KNIFE. The two men stand there. Sizing one another up...

They begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless.

Roque LUNGES AT HIM...

But Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT

into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back...

For most men, that would be the end of the fight. But

not these two. Roque gives Clay a bloody grin.

He LUNGES AGAIN! And now it is FULLY ON...

The blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see

Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife

in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque.

Ten seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard...

Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing

it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out,

TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting...

Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt!

Here's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST:

Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand,

which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay

manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's

apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower

him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS

WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM!

And for the first time, Roque SCREAMS.

Which seems to make Clay happy.

So he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too.

Roque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN...

TO REVEAL -- The PILOT. Leaning out of the cockpit, DESERT

EAGLE levelled at Clay.

The Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's

abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards -- FLYING

OUT OF THE PLANE -- And landing on hood of

Clay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield -- Cougar pumps the

brakes and spins the wheel -- desperately trying to keep

Clay from rolling off the hood...

TURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's

final run to get up to speed...

Now driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course

when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay

turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield:

Cougar passes Clay his SNIPER RIFLE and FLOORS IT...

VISUALIZE THIS --

AT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off.

AT THE OPPOSITE END, Wade's motorcycle heading full speed

at the approaching plane. Cougar and Clay, chasing Wade.

And then AISHA steps out INTO THE MIDDLE of the runway.

The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands.

She takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at

lift speed. ROQUE sees her from the cockpit.

She locks eyes with him and GRINS -- FIRING into the

LANDING GEAR of the plane AS...

PULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS

Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE,

causing the bike to

CATAPULT WADE OFF and FORWARD...

...THROUGH THE AIR and into the RIGHT NUMBER TWO JET ENGINE

of the now flying cargo plane. The ENGINE EXPLODES.

Aisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the

escaping plane. Clay looking up. All of them watching...

...as Roque dies very badly.

WHOOMP! The big plane EXPLODES in a MONSTER FIREBALL--VA

DOOOM! Burning gas and iron and cash. FIRE RULES.

ON THE GROUND

Our guys. Bloody, eyes bitterly triumphant. Clay stares

at the sight before him. Only one word for it.

Jensen approaches, supporting Pooch.

From the smashed up bike Wade was driving, WADE'S CELL

PHONE RINGS. Clay gets off the hood of the Vette and

Cougar and Aisha help him hobble over. Answering it:

INT. NORTH INDIA -- HANGAR -- DAY

MAX and the INDIANS. INTERCUT with Clay:

TIGHT ON CLAY realizing who he's talking to.

A beat as it hits Max.

In the distance, SIRENS.

A beat. Then:

He snaps the phone shut and tosses it into the fire.

Turns to the others.

Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar start for the Hangar. Clay

looks to Aisha. A moment between them.

Clay smiles.

A beat. She nods.

She helps him up and we begin to PULL UP AND BACK as they

head for the Hangar. Together.

INT. NORTH INDIA -- HANGAR -- DAY

Max lowers the phone. Looking stunned. The Short

Scientist has run out of patience.

Max looks at the Short Scientist.

But he doesn't look like he's very amused.

Momentary pause. The Short Scientist looks at Max. Slowly

gets up, LEAVES MAX alone in the room with the ten Indians.

Max takes a deep breath, looks up at the DEATH SQUAD.

We think it's the end. But then we hear

WIND. Blowing through trees. Crickets. The soft sound

of evening television. Somewhere suburban...

FADE IN ON:

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

A nice quiet neighborhood. Outside the kitchen window

Pooch's wife JOLENE, doing dishes in the sink again.

A RUSTLING. Jolene looks up this time. She obviously

heard it. She puts down the dishes and goes to the door.

Opens it and looks out to see...

Nothing. Not even by the swingset.

She sighs. About to head back inside when she spies

A GLINT OF LIGHT. By the oak tree in the front. She

steps outside. Walks down until she sees what it is.

Her breath hitches in her chest.

A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree.

And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes. Because she

knows what it means.

Her husband is alive. And he will make it home.

Someday.
