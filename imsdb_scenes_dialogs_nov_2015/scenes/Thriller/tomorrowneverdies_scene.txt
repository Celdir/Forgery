--------------------------------------------------------------

FADE IN ON:

EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN

Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN

We're looking down at what used to be called "The End of the Known

World." A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.

In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.

Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging

over a cliff:

AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.

Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up

the ice. A human figure. This is:

JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.

Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has

an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black

backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to

JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -

CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks

below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He

looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head:

Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until -

ANOTHER ANGLE -

He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a

toehold. But when he slams the second pick in -

THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK -

BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -

And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of

water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached

to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall.

Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and

forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum.

At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other

pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at:

THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -

Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying.

RETURN ON BOND -

Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on

the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN.

ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -

Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally

frayed through.

RETURN ON BOND -

One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls

himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE

ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still,

he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely

holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward.

EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -

Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down -

through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed.

As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he

smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and -

THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -

Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below.

IN THE WATERBED -

A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge,

he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland.

NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND)

Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff:

BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL -

On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled

down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself.

In other words: This was the only way in.

RETURN ON BOND -

007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK

CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the

side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold.

He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond

slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow.

EXT. SNOW-COVERED FOREST - BOND SKIS THROUGH THE PINES -

EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF -

Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below,

amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE -

Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the

bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:

A ROCK OUTCROPPING.

Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He

unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a

HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on:

A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV)

50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen

MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the

ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying

HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES.

Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with

INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side.

BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT.

THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -

He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining

over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.

THE SAME SCENE ON A VIDEO WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM, LONDON.

Watching this display is M, TANNER, and a handful of MILITARY BRASS,

including a RUSSIAN GENERAL, BUKHARIN, and BRITISH ADMIRAL ROEBUCK,

an aging sea-lion with no love for M, or MI-6.

M deals with the humorless Admiral by, well, humoring him:

The general chuckles. Translates:

M turns to Admiral Roebuck:

Tanner points to the video wall with a RED LASER PEN.

THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

Bond adjusts a knob on the scope.

MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

On the video-screen, the picture zooms to a CLOSE UP of one of the

arms traders. Tanner presses a button, and - almost instantly - the

man's bio and vitals appear on another video screen.

Bond shifts his aim, east. (Intercut as necessary) He zeroes in on

another face, and the man's stats appear in London.

Bond complies. Another face, another set of stats:

Moving swiftly, the Admiral has picked up a RED PHONE:

EXT. A BRITISH WARSHIP - STEAMING IN THE GULF OF OMAN -

INT. WEAPONS CONTROL ROOM - BRITISH WARSHIP -

EXT. DECK OF THE WARSHIP -

A launcher rotates, and - BOOM - a Cruise missile blasts off.

INT. WARSHIP WEAPONS CONTROL ROOM -

MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

Tanner hits a button - and a third video screen appears, displaying a

satellite view of the area, detailing the Cruise's path and progress.

THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

Bond has taken his eye from the scope. He's peering at:

THE MIG-29'S - ("MiG-1," AND "MiG-2") -

A FORKLIFT appears from behind the TRUCK blocking the view of "MiG-l"

A TALL BALD MAN is riding the empty fork, with his back to us.

BOND -

Puts his eye back on the scope, shifts the rifle -

MI-6/VIDEO WALL -

Bond's scope view settles on THE BALD MAN. The forklift reaches the

back of the truck. HE STEPS OFF as the fork begins rising to unload

something. And as the man turns, FACING US to scan the area:

Tanner nods. A look passes from M, to Bukharin, to Roebuck.

THE CRUISE MISSILE -

Hugging the surface, crossing from water to land.

MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

Tension. Adrenaline. QUIET PANIC. On the SCREEN, the FORK LIFT has

pulled a RED BOX from the truck, a SHORT ROUND MAN appearing with it.

BUKHARIN

(sheepishly)

... We usually... Transport...

Weapons grade uranium.

Shock sweeps the room. M turns on Tanner:

BOND - SQUINTING THROUGH THE RIFLE AT THE OUTCROPPING -

THE TRUCK/MiG-l, ON THE GROUND/THROUGH THE SCOPE -

THE BALD MAN slaps the back of the truck obscuring MiG-1. THE TRUCK

PULLS AWAY, revealing MiG-l's WING. Hanging from the weapons pod: A

NUCLEAR BOMB.

BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

Mutters a curse.

MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

Bond's headset lies on top of the rock, along with the telescopic

sight - still broadcasting.

Find Bond, crouching BEHIND the rock. Automatic rifle in one hand,

GRENADE in the other. He pulls the pin, hurls it 40 feet away.

Pauses. Waits, counting down time. Then -

BOND SPRINGS. SHOOTS at one of the CRATES. IT BLOWS UP, just as -

THE GRENADE EXPLODES.

There's PANIC ON THE GROUND. Men running everywhere as THE RADAR/

GATLING GUN spins, and SENDS A HAIL OF FIRE at Bond's diversion.

And with this, BOND is off, SPRINTING INTO THE CHAOS.

THE SAME SCENE - VIDEO SCREEN - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM.

Stoned silence. Disbelief. Tanner whispers:

THE CRUISE MISSILE - FLYING THROUGH A MOUNTAIN RAVINE -

God help the rest of us.

THE SECRET AIR BASE -

As various factions shoot at each other (Who's the traitor?) Bond

streaks toward the action. Without breaking stride, he swings his

gun to the right: TWO BURSTS. THREE MEN DIE. Still running, he

swings to the left: ANOTHER BURST. TWO MORE DOWN.

Ahead, Bond sees the FLIGHT CREWS DASHING for the MiG's. He makes a

beeline for MiG-1.

ANGLE ON THE BALD MAN -

Slamming the gate on the RED BOX in a cargo truck. Rushing to the

passenger door. Climbing in. The SHORT ROUND MAN floors the

accelerator, driving them away.

THE CRUISE MISSILE - STARTING ITS DESCENT DOWN A MOUNTAIN

MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - M, WATCHING HELPLESSLY -

WIDE ON MiG-1 -

The pilot climbs the ladder to the cockpit. Running at full tilt,

BOND LEAPS, pulls the man down. They fall to the tarmac, FIGHTING.

Bond SHOVES A KNIFE in the man's ribs, killing him.

Kneeling, Bond takes the pilot's helmet off. He looks up: A MAN is

coming at him with a GUN. In one unbroken move, Bond YANKS THE KNIFE

from the pilot's body and THROWS IT - thwack - into the man's heart.

ANGLE ON MIG-2'S PILOT - WATCHING THIS FROM HIS COCKPIT.

RETURN ON BOND - CLIMBING INTO THE COCKPIT -

Where the COPILOT (having climbed in from the other side,) sees it's

not the right guy. As he fumbles for a weapon, BOND BASHES HIM WITH

THE HELMET. The copilot collapses into his seat, unconscious.

Bond settles into his seat, fires the engines, closes the double

canopy, and begins taxiing out.

THE CRUISE MISSILE - CROSSING OVER THE PERIMETER OF THE AIR BASE

MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - ROEBUCK, TANNER, M, WATCHING, UNABLE TO BREATHE -

HIGH ANGLE - THE RUNWAY -

The CRUISE SKIMS IN DIRECTLY OVER BOND'S PLANE, speeding to takeoff.

(INT. BOND'S MiG) BOND SHOVES THE THROTTLES TO THE FIREBALL AND -

THE VIDEO-WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

KA-BOOM!!!! The scene on the screen erupts in a GIANT EXPLOSION -

then turns to video-snow. Is Bond alive? No one in London knows.

HIGH ANGLE - THE AIR BASE -

The FIREBALL grows and grows, a raging hell. And just when it seems

no one could possibly survive: BOND'S MiG ROCKETS OUT OF THE FLAMES!!

INT. BOND'S MiG -

Bond thinks he's safe. Sound. Until -

MiG-2 FLIES OUT OF THE FIREBALL -

Cannons blazing at 007. A hail of metal and tracers.

INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -

Bond goes into evasive maneuvers - jinks right, jinks left - when,

suddenly, THE COPILOT REVIVES, and starts trying to STRANGLE Bond

with a METAL LANYARD. Struggling, Bond HEARS a THIN HIGH-PITCHED

TONE -

INT./EXT. MIG-2

The pilot has locked onto Bond's MiG. Boom! TWO HEAT-SEEKING

MISSILES roar away.

INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -

Fighting the garrote, Bond KICKS THE THROTTLES forward and PULLS BACK

ON THE YOKE. The MiG goes into a spine crushing climb as -

THE TWO HEAT SEEKING MISSILES FOLLOW HIM, LOOPING UPWARD.

INT. MIG-2 -

Bond's MiG has disappeared from the pilot's view: Not in front. Not

on the left. Not on the right. Where did he go? The pilot looks up:

BOND'S MIG APPEARS, FLYING INVERTED, COCKPIT DOWN, 10 FEET ABOVE MIG-2.

THE PILOT OF MIG-2 IS STUNNED.

INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -

Fighting against the garrote, Bond strains to reach a RED BUTTON on

the panel: COPILOT EJECTOR SEAT.

Bond finally taps it, and - THE BACK HALF OF THE CANOPY BLOWS OFF!

The COPILOT BLASTS OUT OF THE PLANE, DOWNWARD, directly into MIG-2's

cockpit. Bond peels off.

For a second, MiG-2 hangs in the air. Until... BOOM!!! The TWO HEAT

SEEKING MISSILES BLAST IT TO SMITHEREENS.

Back in MiG-1, Bond fiddles with the radio.

MI-6 - SITUATION ROOM -

The situation room erupts in cheers.

RETURN ON BOND IN THE MIG -

EXT. BOND'S MIG -

Goes to AFTERBURNERS. And from the fiery glow of the engine, we

DISSOLVE TO:

THE 007 GUN BARREL. MAIN CREDITS.

After credits, fade in on:

EXT. OXFORD COLLEGE - DAY

All ivy and bricks... And a certain Aston-Martin DB-5, parked.

INT. BOOK LINED OFFICE -

Afterglow: Empty champagne bottle. Rumpled sheets on a sleeper sofa.

Bond is in bed with a smart, IRONIC, (and, yes, stunning,) 30-ish

Chinese woman, JENNY WU. (NOTE: The Chinese here is Mandarin, spelled

phonetically.)

She laughs. His hand goes beneath the sheets.

He moves to roll on top of her, but she pushes him off, teasing:

She hops off the bed, leaving frame. Bond settles back on the

headboard, ready to enjoy the view... When his CELL PHONE RINGS.

INT. M'S ANTEROOM - MI-6.

MONEYPENNY, at her desk.

INT. OFFICE - (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

(Jenny has a leg on the bed, pulling on a full Victoria's Secret

outfit: Nylons, garter/suspenders, bustier, etc.)

(In the background, Jenny insists "I am not little.")

Bond watches with amusement as Jenny Wu slips a Graduation-type gown

over the lingerie. No dress.

ON MONEYPENNY:

Moneypenny hangs up, looks up, and blanches: M is standing there.

INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE JENNY'S OFFICE - OXFORD -

Bond and Jenny Wu emerge from the office. (She's still in the gown.)

They pass a flock of young students:

She gives him a wry glance, opens a door to a lecture hall.

She exits; Bond walks off, passing underneath a WALL MOUNTED TV SET.

ON THE TV SET - The HNN Globe Logo - The Harmsway News Network -

spins into view, followed by:

EXT. MI-6 LONDON - DAY

The DB-5 drives past the guard.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Debriefing: Bond, M, and several others listen as NATO COLONEL

DOMINIQUE EVERHART, (early 30's, Belgian,) refers to video clips from

the Khyber Pass sequence:

There's a pregnant pause in the room.

Another face appears on the screen:

M exits. Bond approaches Dominique. She smiles, warmly. There's a

mutual attraction - but there's something else going on, unspoken.

Bond hands her a PEN. She regards it cautiously.

She gives him a wry look; starts to write. He notes her WEDDING BAND.

For an instant, something crosses Bond's face: Bittersweetness? Re-

morse? Either way, she's scored a subtle victory.

With a Sphinx-like smile, she watches Bond leave.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Where Bond encounters MONEYPENNY, also walking to M's office.

Moneypenny cuts Bond a look - and, in the background, sees Dominique

leave the conference room, and walk down the hall, away from them.

They've come to a security door. She punches in a code -

The door opens. They go into:

INT. M'S ANTEROOM (MONEYPENNY'S AREA) - CONTINUOUS

Bond scowls. Moneypenny smiles wryly, points to the inner door:

INT. M'S OFFICE - DAY

M is behind her desk; MINISTER PETER JOHNSTONE sits across - a high-

handed Teflon-coated politician, with the survival instincts of

plutonium. They've been arguing.

Bond sits in an armchair. M presses a button, and a video/bio of

ELIOT HARMSWAY appears on the wall behind her. Mid-50's, regal.

Bond looks at Johnstone quizzically. Then a very tight-lipped M. He

senses he's about to enter a minefield:

(M has punched a button, and Valentin's video bio has appeared.)

Johnstone is reeling. M continues, to Bond, with aplomb:

She hands Bond a CARNIVAL MASK:

And he exits. M, frowning, hits a button on her intercom:

Bond is silent, chastised. M looks away, then looks back:

M looks up: MALCOLM SAUNDERS, Q's successor, limps in, looking like a

mummy - plaster casts on his left leg, left arm; neck-brace, crutch.

Bond thwacks the crutch against the leg. Saunders GRIMACES IN PAIN.

Saunders flexes his broken arm; ARMORED SPIKES pop out of the it.

Saunders exchanges a beleaguered glance with M. He takes off the cast

and neck-brace, and places a BRIEFCASE on M's desk.

Saunders has opened the briefcase. Bond tries to look inside, but

Saunders repositions it. Saunders continues:

A small flame appears. Bond, unimpressed, reaches for it -

Saunders flips the lighter sideways and - WHOOSH! A burst of flame

shoots across the room.

Bond takes the lighter, begins to play with it...

He takes out a pair of SHOELACES.

Saunders is suddenly stricken. Flustered. He blurts out:

He hands Bond a WEDDING BAND.

Bond turns from Saunder's devious grin to an amused M. Smiles:

He snaps the ring down on her desk.

EXT. VENICE HARBOR/GRAND CANAL - NIGHT

A GLEAMING WHITE YACHT - with two on-board helicopters, and a huge

tarped hold - dominates the harbor. (Harmsway's SEA DOLPHIN II.)

Tonight, however, we find a GONDOLA, gliding through the water...

Arriving at a festively-lit dock, crowded with gaily costumed

partygoers and musicians in medieval garb.

Wearing the mask from M's office, (and a bright blue cape,) Bond

alights the gondola, and plunges into the crowd.

EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - NIGHT

A swirl of colors, noise and music. Pushing his way into the chaotic

celebration, Bond scans the crowd, looking for a face:

NOTHING BUT A SEA OF MASKS. White. Yellow. Red. Blue.

Caught up in the tumult, he turns left, he strains to turn right,

anxiously looking for the contact. Who is it?

THREE MASKED WOMEN appear in front of Bond. They curtsy, and giggle.

He's spun by a MASKED MAN with a bottle.

Bond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction, by a

group of celebrants carrying a long banner.

Suddenly, the CROWD SURGES FORWARD: A PROCESSION, carrying the

EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL is making its way through the square.

Locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd, Bond struggles to look

forward - left, right - when he FEELS A TUG at his cape from behind.

He can only crane his neck to see/hear -

With an effort, Bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing, save

the wisp of a satin costume, disappearing as the crowd closes ranks

behind him.

SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - NIGHT

Five minutes later. Almost deserted. A few stray couples. The

MASKED WOMAN appears, walking tentatively between the shadows and

the moonlight, looking for Bond. Suddenly -

Whomp! - an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove.

Recovering her breath (it was a violent yank,) the woman - PARIS

removes her mask. She shines a sexy, 1000-watt smile at 007:

Bond reacts. He is not happy to see her.

Paris smiles coyly. She LIFTS A HAND to tousle his hair -

She's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness.

She turns away from him, fighting back tears. Bond doesn't care:

BOND SLAPS HER. She's stunned. He waits. She's angered:

She turns away. Bond feels remorse for hitting her. Softens:

Bond reaches out to touch her. She falls into his arms, burying her

face in his shoulder.

Bond thinks for a moment, then gently pushes her away, a foot

backwards, to look in her eyes:

Paris' eyes flicker at something over Bond's shoulder. She swoons:

She pulls Bond to her, kissing him - then HAULS OFF, BELTING him

across the mouth.

She shoves him off, darts away. Bond is bleeding from his mouth -

and not altogether surprised at her behavior. He turns to see -

ANOTHER ANGLE - SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - (BOND'S POV) -

Paris running to FOUR MEN dressed alike in three-corner hats,

enveloped from head-to-foot in BLACK CAPES. Their faces are

completely concealed behind flat, bone-white masks covering all but

their chins. They look like messengers of death.

CLOSER ON PARIS AND THE MEN -

The leader is STAMPER; the others are locals, THUG #1, #2, #3. (THUG

#1 is built like a bank vault.) Stamper looks steadily at Bond

RETURN ON BOND -

He sees STAMPER and the TWO HENCHMEN approaching. He turns and walks

quickly toward -

EXT. RIALTO BRIDGE - FIRST (UP) STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Pushing past carnival-goers, Bond rushes up the central staircase of

the bridge. At the top, looking onto the main span, he sees -

THE EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL PROCESSION, approaching like a tidal wave.

BOND throws a look over his shoulder, and SEES THE THREE MEN, rushing

up the stairs, knocking people out of the way like bowling pins -

completely unaware of the oncoming parade at the top.

BOND turns to face the men... And suddenly THROWS HIS CAPE UP,

dramatically, like Batman - blocking their view of the procession.

STAMPER AND THE TWO THUGS hesitate for a moment -

And BOND PULLS THE CAPE TO HIS BODY, just as the PROCESSION SURGES

PAST HIM, and spills down the stairs, overwhelming Stamper & Co.

Bond disappears into the oncoming crowd.

Stamper and Thug #2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase - but

Thug #1 bulls his way up, shouldering through the crowd.

RIALTO BRIDGE - SECOND (DOWN) STAIRCASE - NIGHT

As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase, he looks back up:

THUG #1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine, tossing

carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls. Spotting Bond, he charges -

But gets caught between TWO MEN CARRYING A SATIN BANNER. He goes

right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare hands,

pulling the men down, after him.

BASE OF THE RIALTO BRIDGE - CANAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT

Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade. He sees:

A GROUP OF TOURISTS, posing for a photo by the bridge -

and just beyond this -

A STREET SELLER hawking souvenirs from a PUSH CART.

BOND approaches the TOURIST with the camera, offering to take the

picture for him.

Bond takes the camera. The tourists pose. And with perfect timing,

Bond turns, and - POP! - sets off the FLASHBULB in THUG #l's face

just as he comes around the corner.

Bond flips the camera back to the tourist -

And heads for the PUSHCART. Wheeling it around, he SHOVES IT at the

thug, who is still stumbling, blinded by the flashbulb.

The CART SLAMS INTO THE MAN, knocking him on his back. The cart

stops on top of him, pinning him down.

BOND takes off, threading through the crowd toward a SIDESTREET.

Meanwhile, THE STREET SELLER rushes to his wrecked cart. It ERUPTS

in the air as Thug #1 jumps to his feet. He's getting really pissed

off. He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him, as -

007 disappears down the sidestreet.

Thug #1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked by TWO

MOTORCYCLISTS, chatting away. Barely stopping, Thug #1 lifts one of

the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and THROWS IT

INTO THE CANAL.

RETURN ON THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE -

Stamper and Thug #2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see Thug

#1 disappear onto the side Street.

Stamper motions for Thug #2 to come with him on a parallel course

along the canals toward -

THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE - NIGHT

Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street. Sticking close

to the buildings, he ducks into an alleyway.

ALLEYWAY - OFF THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE -

Shrinking back into the shadows, Bond peers out into the Plaza.

BOND'S POV - THE PLAZA

Stamper and Thug 2 charge in. Bond watches as they split up and

start looking for him.

RETURN ON BOND - IN THE SHADOWS -

Suddenly, a huge hand grabs 007's shoulder, spinning him around:

THUG #1 has Bond in his grasp, with murder his eyes. In one fast

move, Bond side-steps, ducks, and twists out of the cloak, throwing

it over the Thug's head. And as the Thug struggles to get out from

under it, Bond slams him head-first into a wall, knocking him out.

(He's left sitting upright, slumped against the wall.)

NEW ANGLE -

Bond heads off down the alleyway, away from the Plaza, toward the

courtyard of Il Bovolo.

RETURN ON ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE -

Thug #2 enters, spots the figure in Bond's cloak. Very quietly, he

pulls out his gun, kneels... And as he brings the gun up to the

cloaked figure's head, chambering a round -

The cloak erupts, with Thug #1 viciously biting Thug #2's gun-hand,

hurling him against the opposite wall.

With a frustrated fury, Thug #1 rips off the cloak, and stands.

They charge off.

IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No

way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH

FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard.

THE SPIRAL STAIRS -

Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time.

RETURN ON THE COURTYARD -

The two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR

BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him.

THE BALCONY -

Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the

building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the

courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.

Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape.

Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the

GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and

disappears from sight...

Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase.

FIRST ROOFTOP -

Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are

SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop

to an adjoining building. Bond jumps.

SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -

007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold

on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down:

The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof.

As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof -

RETURN ON THE BALCONY -

Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy

to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below.

FIRST ROOFTOP -

Thug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the

next building. He makes a running leap.

SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -

Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They

grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the

roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond.

AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the

skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment.

007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1

tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO

BOND'S LEGS.

They sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the

two of them fall -

CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: -

VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT.

They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the

Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the

collar, hauling him up on his feet.

Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up

on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond:

With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his

gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just

clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING.

The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA,

and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away.

As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally

(yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR.

With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room.

He's having fun.

AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER -

THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond.

BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out

of the way, like a gnat.

Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from

the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug.

Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE,

and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed "King Arthur" type sword.

With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO.

The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to:

A DISPLAY WALL -

filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD.

(Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks.

Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax.

THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug

#1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax.

NEW ANGLE -

Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond

backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN.

(Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.)

Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the

last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from

killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden.

As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A

studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club)

Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN

TWO... But loses the weapon in the process.

Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the

wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM

THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.  -

In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1

backwards, down onto the floor.

AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX -

THUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR.

BOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL. HE TURNS TO SEE:

THUG #1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM.

And at the very last second, BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX, SLASHES THE

IRON MAIDEN'S LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and -

NEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDEN'S POV -

The iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor.

RETURN TO SCENE -

The Iron Maiden covers all of Thug #1, except for his arm, still

clutching Bond's gun. Bond bends down and retrieves it.

And on this note, we -

EXT. VENICE HARBOR - THE NEXT DAY -

Under a beautiful blue sky, the gleaming white SEA DOLPHIN II sits at

dock, festooned with pennants and banners. There's a crowd onboard.

At the same time, however, 500 feet away...

INT. DOCKSIDE CAFE -

Bond meets with Signore DiGIACOMO, a middle-aged Italian Intelligence

official in shirtsleeves. Two underlings hover in the background.

He looks at a WOMAN who has appeared with a baby in her arms.

She leaves. He turns back Bond:

Bond nods, looks over at the Sea Dolphin II.

Bond stands to leave. DiGiacomo smiles after 007 - as if he's

savoring some private secret. He snaps his fingers to an underling:

THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

As Bond makes his way up the gangplank -

ELLIOT HARMSWAY is holding a press conference near the bow, surround-

ed by dignitaries. He is a man with an EVIL EUPHORIA - showing off

all the charm and charisma that's made him one of the world's most

powerful media tycoons.

Laughter. Bond studies the man. Harmsway continues, pointing to a

LARGE DRILL/BORING OBJECT, the size of a jet engine, attached to a

long flexible hose/tube.

Bond moves through the crowd. He spots a bulkhead, with a door.

He motions to Zukofsky, who nods to the audience...

Big laugh from the assemblage. Harmsway turns to a BEAUTY QUEEN:

SMASH! She cracks a champagne bottle on the tip of the bow. CHEERS!

Laughter. Harmsway points to a reporter:

Amidst more laughter, Bond disappears into the bulkhead door.

INT. SEA DOLPHIN II - BELOW DECKS -

Bond moves cautiously down a STAIRCASE...

And peers along a CORRIDOR. He sees a GUARD, checking doors, making

sure they're locked. Bond withdraws for a moment, looks back: The

guard is at the far end of the hall. He lifts a WALKIE-TALKIE:

The guard exits, down another staircase. Bond moves stealthily down

the corridor, glancing at signs on various doors: FISH HATCHERY,

WEATHER STATION, CREW'S MESS, etc... Until he comes to:

METALLURGY LAB. There's a CARD READER by the door. Bond slips out

his Q-toy, swipes it. Click. He goes inside.

INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II - CONTINUOUS

Bond clocks the lab: Power tools, test benches, a SECOND ENTRY

DOOR... And in the middle of the room -

THE RED BOX.

Quickly, (as the echoes of Harmsway's press conference can be heard

through the portholes,) Bond examines the edges of the box, looking

for tamper-proof seals. Finds none. Gingerly, he opens it:

URANIUM SLUGS. They look like black tennis ball canisters.

BOND presses a button on his watch: THE GEIGER COUNTER CLICKS WILDLY

Bond pauses. Wants to make sure. He spots ANOTHER GEIGER COUNTER on

a bench; he moves its probe over the uranium slugs: Same result.

Bond closes the box. He decides to check out the rest of the room -

examining gadgets, tools, chemicals. HE OPENS A SHALLOW DRAWER -

And finds a set of BLACK ROTARY CUTTING SAWS, WITH ELONGATED TEETH.

(They look almost like a series of sharks' jaws - one oval set inside

another )

Bond lifts one - surprised at its extreme weight. He wonders what it

is used for. Just then -

THERE'S A CLICK AT THE SECOND DOOR. Bond quickly replaces the

cutting saw, moves to the first door -

And as the SECOND DOOR OPENS, Bond slips out the first, into the

CORRIDOR, down the hall, heading for the stairs.

BACK IN THE METALLURGY LAB -

YUNG enters, his hairless head shining under the lights. He looks

around, sensing something is wrong. Glances: Not the red box. Not

the Geiger counter. But then he notices it:

THE DRAWER is sticking out, maybe a sixteenth of an inch.

Yung picks up a telephone.

SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -

Bond emerges from the bulkhead door. The press conference wrapping

up. As Bond makes his way to the RAIL, looking out on the cafe -

Bond stands at the rail, AIMS HIS WATCH at the cafe -

INT. CAFE -

DiGiacomo sees the BLUE LASER. Motions his men to action.

RETURN ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -

Bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars, trying to remain

ac inconspicuous as possible. A hand clasps his shoulder:

Bond spins to see Valentin, surrounded by the usual assortment of

cheaply dressed goons.

The goons chortle. Bond isn't happy with this attention. He clocks

a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ON ONE OF THE MASTS, scanning the deck.

A WOMAN'S SHRILL WHINING VOICE - brings Bond back to Valentin. She

is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos.

Valentin gives a beleaguered shrug, and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF CASH.

Shaking his head, Valentin turns back to Bond:

With Bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera, they move

several steps to the bar.

Bond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his

regular behavior might arouse suspicion.

As the bartender pours:

Valentin spots someone off-camera.

Harmsway appears. Ebullient as ever.

Harmsway greets Bond with a warm smile. Yet his words are ambiguous:

He laughs. Bond decides to pull Harmsway's chain.

A woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat. As

she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond -

There is a terrified look on her face. Harmsway continues, beaming

his most insinuating smile:

There is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks. Then -

POLICE WHISTLES BLOW! SIRENS! SOUND OF TIRES SCREECHING TO A HALT!

The entire party turns to see DiGIACOMO barging his way up the

gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by UZI-

TOTING CARBINIERI, along with his own VIDEO AND STILL CREWS.

A set of frozen glances goes from Bond, to Paris, to Harmsway.

To everyone's surprise, Harmsway guffaws.

And he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door. Bond is

left with Paris. She is white with fear. Bond moves to console her:

Bond wants to help her - and follow Harmsway. He pulls out a key:

Paris looks up at him like a hurt child. She wants some contact; she

wants to hear him say 'I love you.'

She exits; he goes to the bulkhead door... And we pan up to see the

SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, following him.

INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II -

Harmsway holds court near the red box. Bond squeezes in.

He opens the red box. Hoists out a canister.

Bond can't believe what he's seeing. DiGiacomo is mortified.

As the room empties, he calls -

Bond approaches him. They're the only people in the room.

Harmsway glances at his watch. Smiles coldly.

EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II/HARBOR - DAY

Bond rushes down the gangplank, along the dock. Jumps in a gondola.

RETURN ON THE METALLURGY LAB -

Harmsway closes the door. Yung is there.

Harmsway presses a button - and suddenly the red box lifts, and a

second red box appears underneath it, like shuffling a deck of cards.

EXT. THE DANIELLI HOTEL - DAY

Bond jumps out of the gondola, sprints into the lobby.

FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR -

Bond appears, rushing up a staircase. He comes to his doorway. It's

closed, but unlocked.

INT. BOND'S HOTEL ROOM -

Bond enters the room. Looks around, calling out -

He sees the French doors open onto the canal. The curtains billowing

outward. Bond rushes to the window and looks down:

EXT. GRAND CANAL - BOND'S POV

Paris Harmsway is dead, floating in the water.

RETURN ON BOND -

Crushed. Devastated. And to make matters worse:

Bond turns. A flashbulb goes off, capturing Bond and DiGiacomo.

THE SOUTH CHINA SEA - DUSK

The HMS INDOMITABLE - a 3,300 ton British frigate, surges through the

water, heading toward the setting sun.

CLOSER -

BATTLE-DRESSED ROYAL MARINES patrol the deck; GUNNERY CREWS man the

weapons. Whatever is going on here, it's not business as usual.'

INT. BRIDGE - DUSK

Close on A VERTICAL GLASS MAP. An electronic panel display with a

BLINKING YELLOW DOT indicates -

THE CAPTAIN nods. Turns to the GPS OFFICER:

The GPS officer enters keyboard commands on console marked "GLOBAL

POSITIONING SATELLITE." He reads out the data:

The Captain is all business - clipped, sober terse. Turns to his

FIRST OFFICER, hands him a SLIP OF PAPER:

The first officer nods.

The Captain heads for the door.

The officers salute as he exits. With a shrug, the FIRST OFFICER

picks up the INTERCOM MICROPHONE:

INT. CREW'S MESS -

Crowded with CREW MEMBERS eating, waiting on line for food.

CLOSE ON COOK - KITCHEN -

At microwave. His finger hovers over button, then stops. He opens

the door of the microwave and takes out a bowl. Dumps the contents

on the stove.

INT. SHIP'S HEAD -

CREW MEMBER with an ELECTRIC SHAVER.

He stops shaving.

INT. ENGINE ROOM -

The ENGINEER shouts to his crew, over NOISE OF DIESEL ENGINES:

RETURN ON THE BRIDGE -

The First Officer stands next to the Communications Officer.

The First Officer looks over the shoulder of RATING at radar screen.

The First Officer joins the Second Officer at the windows, scanning

the horizon with binoculars.

EXT. MANOR HOUSE - THE COAST OF SCOTLAND - DAY

THE BAGPIPE AND DRUM CORPS of the Royal Highland Regiment (aka the

"Black Watch") is playing a FUNERAL DIRGE outside a vast stone house,

with a HARMSWAY NEWS HELICOPTER on the lawn, and LIMOUSINES, A HEARSE

and a FLOWER CAR in the driveway.

SIX MEN IN FORMAL MOURNING ATTIRE are entering the house.

INT. GRAND ROOM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE -

A SINGLE WHITE ROSE is added to a pile of white roses in PARIS

HARMSWAY'S OPEN CASKET.

REVEAL: We're in mid-procession: The last two (of the six men from

outside) place roses in the casket...

Then turn, nodding sorrowfully to ELLIOT HARMSWAY (sitting in the

front row of a room that's keen turned into a makeshift chapel)...

And follow hand signals of STAMPER, who motions them THROUGH A DOOR,

to an unseen room.

After the last man has paid his respects, HARMSWAY stands, walks to

the bier, and - wiping away a tear - places a single RED ROSE in his

dead wife's casket.

INT. HARMSWAY'S INNER SANCTUM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE - DAY

We're in a room that looks as if it could only exist in, well, a

James Bond movie: Slick, stark, sterile. Steel, glass, chrome.

The SIX men are seated around a giant conference table, looking

absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire.

Elliot Harmsway enters, (passing what appears to be the Liechtenstein

that hangs in the lobby of CAA,) walks to the head of the table,

takes off his gray mourning gloves, slaps them down, and:

The men nod. Harmsway sits, dims the lights from a control panel.

A gap-toothed Californian with bland features stands.

A young guy with glasses gets up, looking remarkably like Bill Gates.

A SHORT MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN stands. Nervous.

A pause. The other men in the room shift uncomfortably.

Harmsway presses a button. Stamper enters. Number Three assumes

this means death. He BEGS FOR HIS LIFE:

Number Three is confused. Does this mean he's going to live?

Harmsway nods, watching him leave:

And the man is gone. Harmsway turns his attention back to the room:

Harmsway presses another button. The room darkens. The CENTER OF

THE TABLE OPENS, and a 3-D MAP OF MALAYSIA rises into view.

EXT. LIMOUSINE - MANOR HOUSE - DAY

Stamper holds the back door open for Number Three. He gets in.

INT. LIMOUSINE -

He seems relieved, until the doors lock, ominously. They drive off.

EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLAND ROADWAY - (INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - MOVING) DAY

Number Three fidgets in the back... And notices Stamper smiling at

him in the REARVIEW MIRROR. He sees Stamper reach INTO HIS JACKET -

and PANICS! Is he going to get shot? Is it over? He winces, as -

STAMPER'S HAND SUDDENLY THRUSTS BACKWARD THROUGH THE PARTITION.

Shaking his head, he pulls out a HANDKERCHIEF to mop the flop sweat.

RETURN ON THE MANOR HOUSE - FAVORING THE HNN HELICOPTER -

Amidst ad-libbed 'good-bye's" from the gang of six (now five,)

Harmsway gets in the waiting HNN chopper. It powers up, takes off.

EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - SCOTLAND -

Stamper's limousine parks near a Gulfstream jet. He opens the back

door for Number Three. At last, the man believes he is safe.

Stamper TUCKS THE PAPER FIRMLY UNDER #3'S ARM - and gives him a

friendly pat on the back, sending him up the stairs.

At the doorway, Number Three looks back. Stamper smiles, waving:

INT. GULFSTREAM JET - DAY

Number Three settles into his seat. The door closes; the engines

wind up for take-off. He sighs: He's safe. He casually picks up the

newspaper, snaps open the front page:

INSERT FRONT PAGE OF HARMSWAY'S "TOMORROW' NEWSPAPER:

Screaming headline: ISRAELI AGENT REVEALED. There's a FULL COLOR

PHOTO OF NUMBER THREE underneath.

Number Three lowers the paper, white as a ghost, and -

TWO ARABIAN GENTLEMEN (in full burnoose) sit down on either side of

him. They smile. And on NUMBER THREE'S BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM, we

THE H.M.S. INDOMITABLE -

Moving through FOG in the STRAIT OF MALACCA, night.

INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

The room is bathed in blue light as the crew monitors the Indomita-

ble's command and control systems.

At the VERTICAL GLASS MAP, the ship's course has been charted from

Hong Kong, south, down around Singapore, then north, where the YELLOW

BLINKING dot indicates it's currently in the Strait of Malacca.

Standing in front of the map, however, THE NAVIGATION OFFICER seems

perplexed. He's comparing what's on the screen to a piece of paper

in his hand. Something is wrong.

THE HELMSMAN looks down at his compass/auto-pilot.

INSERT COMPASS/AUTO-PILOT - moving from West to North - then holding

on a North position.

The two officers share a look. Something is odd, but -

Just then, the FIRST OFFICER ENTERS from the exterior bridge.

He joins the RATING and COMMUNICATION'S OFFICERS at their scopes.

As the First Officer takes this in:

He points down to the compass/auto-pilot, SWINGING WEST...

The compass reaches dead west - then starts to swing back NORTH.

EXT. SPACE -

As the earth turns below, a TINY SILVER DOT appears in the distance:

A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE, spinning slowly on its axis.

It comes closer and closer to camera, until it FILLS THE SCREEN, and

the LOGO on its body ROTATES INTO VIEW:

HNN. THE HARMSWAY NEWS NETWORK.

RETURN ON BRIDGE - INT. H.M.S. INDOMITABLE - NIGHT

THE HELMSMAN finishes fiddling with the auto-pilot.

The First Officer nods... Then HEARS a SHRILL WARNING BEEP.

The First Officer rushes to join him at the screen.

EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

The ship is moving towards a DARK VERTICAL SHAPE - Harmsway's SEA-BED

CORE BORING DRILL (shorthand "THE WORM',) attached to a long flexible

dredging pipe.

CLOSER - THE HEAD OF THE WORM -

Motionless, hanging in the water. Then the monster awakes: A metal

sphere retracts, revealing a wide angle CAMERA LENS.

INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Communications Officer reacts to his monitor with ALARM:

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER

I'm getting an electrical emission,

sir! Extremely close. Bearing 240 -

The First Officer is surprised. All hell is about to break loose:       -

A Junior officer bursts in from the exterior bridge:

EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

Propelled by water-jets in its head, THE WORM STREAKS TOWARD THE

INDOMITABLE, emitting a HIGH PITCHED whine as its drill bit revs up

to speed. The drill's BLACK TEETH glisten in the water.

THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, NIGHT)

Closing in on the hull like a torpedo. It gets closer, picking up

speed, until - on IMPACT -

INT. ENGINE ROOM -

A TORRENT OF WATER engulfs the Engineer and Crewmen when The Worm

bursts/drills through the hull. As they scream, drowning -

A CREWMAN ON THE GANTRY scrambles up, one step ahead of the water,

through a bulkhead, into -

GENERATOR ROOM - (CONTINUOUS)

Where the CREWMAN and TWO OPERATORS struggle to CLOSE THE DOOR

AGAINST THE WATER.

THE BRIDGE -

Alarms sound! Red lights flash!

PASSAGEWAY #1 -

On a phone, outside the ship's GYM, deep in the hull:

He speeds along the passageway, going through a water-tight door,

slamming it behind him. Meanwhile, on -

THE BRIDGE -

As the Second Officer grabs the intercom -

CREW'S MESS -

The crew members look up from their meals -

GENERATOR ROOM -

The men have closed the door, but... HEAR A HIGH-PITCHED WHINING,

GRINDING SOUND from the other side. They exchange a quizzical look;

they don't know what to make of it, when:

BANG! The door explodes inward - and a high-pressured stream of

water blasts in, blowing them back against the walls.

BRIDGE -

The lights go out! Everyone is scrambling:

CREW'S MESS -

In the dim lighting -

The men start to move, but halt at A HUMMING SOUND. They look

around: Where is it coming from?

Suddenly a THREE FOOT SECTION OF THE DECK EXPLODES IN A FOUNTAIN OF

WATER. The men are swept off their feet.

PASSAGEWAY/GANTRY #2 -

As the Captain rushes up the steps, he turns around, reacting to a

GRINDING NOISE -

CAPTAIN'S POV - THE CLOSED WATER-TIGHT DOOR -

BOOM! Water blasts through, like 1000 fire hydrants turned on full.

With terror in his eyes, THE CAPTAIN sprints up the rest of the

stairs, through a water-tight door, into:

PASSAGEWAY #3 -

Where the Captain secures the door behind him, and rushes away.

THE BRIDGE -

A desperate battle continues:

BATTERY ROOM -

A CREWMAN hurriedly flips switches. The lights flicker... And just

as they some to life, brightly -

THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN, and a wall of water and debris blows in,

destroying everything in its wake.

THE BRIDGE -

Lights out! A sense of helplessness is beginning to fill the room:

All eyes are on the First Officer. Will he save them?

THE CAPTAIN (PASSAGEWAY #3) -

Running, the Captain is about to reach the exit door. Hearing the

relentless grinding behind him, he throws a look over his shoulder:

BAM! The entrance door EXPLODES in a thunderball of water.

The Captain clambers through the exit door to:

PASSAGEWAY #4 -

A short hall: He shuts the entrance door, runs to the exit. He

looks hack again:

BAM! The door blasts open - and the torrent of water continues the

chase, as if it's got a personal vendetta against him. He exits to:

PASSAGEWAY #5 -

Slamming the door behind him, the Captain looks ahead, and up:

STAIRS. AN OPEN DOOR AT THE TOP.

He throws a look back:

THE ENTRANCE DOOR IS BEGINNING TO HUM AND VIBRATE.

Sprinting for his life, the Captain rushes up the stairs, two at a

time. The humming behind him grows louder. He glances back:

THE DOOR BLASTS OPEN. WATER SHOOTS IN.

He rushes up the last four steps, just as -

CA-CHUNK! THE EXIT DOOR SLAMS CLOSED IN FRONT OF HIM!

With PANIC IN HIS EYES, the Captain turns to face the oncoming

tsunami! We cut to:

THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY #5)

Moving like a shark... Toward THE CAPTAIN'S LEGS, DEAD AHEAD IN THE

WATER. As it closes in for the kill -

THE BRIDGE -

Shifts, suddenly, to the stern. A confusion of anxious voices:

With all hands still awaiting orders -

THE ROOM LURCHES AS THE BOW RISES! Papers fly! Men slide! The

First Officer has no choice:

INSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN -

The Communications Officer types: "Top Secret. Indian Ocean Naval

Command. H.M.S. Indomitable Sinking."

As he types, the room lurches again, tilting more to the stern.

THE CAPTAIN - (STAIRCASE, PASSAGEWAY #5)

As the passageway shifts, tilting to the stern, the Captain screams

and WHOOSH! - is sucked down into the water - the worm's vortex -

like meat being fed into a Cuisinart: A churning, spinning death.

EXT. THE H.M.S. INDOMITABLE - FOG - NIGHT

Bow rises completely out of the water as the stern goes under.

EXT. DECK -

TWO CREWMAN manage to get a LIFEBOAT away. TWO OTHERS scramble up

from below and leap into the water.

WIDER

The bow is at a forty-five degree angle... And the H.M.S.

Indomitable pauses - for just a moment - before SLIPPING UNDER, STERN

FIRST, throwing up a series of great waves.

EXT. LIFEBOAT -

Rocked by waves from the sinking ship. The Cook, a Marine, and Three

Crewmen hear a splash along side. Two of the Crew pull the SONAR

OFFICER aboard. He takes a minute to catch his breath, then:

One of the CREWMAN SPOTS SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE:

NEW ANGLE - (ROCK OUTCROPPING - STRAIT OF MALACCA - NIGHT)

The SEA DOLPHIN II emerges from a cove, looking like a ghostly white

apparition in the fog.

RETURN ON THE LIFEBOAT -

The men yell and wave and whistle, hoping to be saved.

CLOSER ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - DECK -

Elliot Harmsway removes a pair of binoculars from his face. Turns to

YUNG, standing next to him at the rail:

Yung looks at Harmsway like he's crazy. Oblivious, Harmsway looks at

his WATCH, then looks through the BINOCULARS again - and begins to

WHISTLE the opening notes of My Fair Lady's "WOULDN'T IT BE LOVERLY."

("All I want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air")

THE LIFEBOAT -

As the men cry for help, the Sonar Operator spots something just

below the surface, moving toward the lifeboat at great speed.

He hears the hum. His eyes follow the churning water...

And suddenly - out of nowhere - the Worm hits the lifeboat from

below, smashing it to bits, hurtling the pieces in the air.

THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

Harmsway lowers the binoculars' smiling. Stamper appears, hands

Harmsway a piece of paper.

Harmsway studies it for a moment - smiles.

And with this, Harmsway turns, and walks off, jauntily whistling

"Wouldn't It Be Loverly."

Stamper looks at Yung, re: Harmsway's glee.

NEW ANGLE - SIDE OF THE SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT -

In the water next to the chip, FOUR DIVERS drop the last of their

equipment in a DIVE BOAT. They cast off, motoring into the fog.

EXT. LONDON - RESTAURANT BIBENDUM - NIGHT

The classic Michelin building on Fulham road.

INT. RESTAURANT BIBENDUM -

A YOUNG WOMAN is yammering away at Bond; he's trying to put a good

face on what is obviously a dreadful fix-up first date.

Before Bond can answer, the MAITRE D' interrupts.

Bond excuses himself.

NEW ANGLE - BOND AT PHONE -

007 picks up the receiver, without saying hello:

EXT. THE BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT

Passing a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY TRUCK with an ad for "TOMORROW" ("The

Paper that Never Lies,") Bond's DB-5 roars past the guard.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT

ADMIRAL ROEBUCK glares as MINISTER JOHNSTONE enters to address M,

TANNER, A TREASURY OFFICIAL, and various UNIFORMS and SUITS.

He's distracted by the CLICK OF A DOOR OPENING. All turn to SEE BOND

entering, wearing a FULL NAVAL UNIFORM. M stifles a smile.

Bond sits. M glances at Johnstone as if to say "proceed."

EXT. STRAIT OF MALACCA - FOG - NIGHT

Foreground, empty diving boat. Background, Sea Dolphin II, with the

"flexible hose" hanging over the rail, down into the water.

INT. BRIDGE - SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT

Stamper works "worm" master control with a video joystick.

Harmsway and Yung look over his shoulder at:

INSERT - VIDEO SCREEN -

Through the worm's UNDERWATER camera, FOUR DIVERS with TORCHES and

WELDING TOOLS are about to enter the HOLE in the Indomitable's hull.

(The video screen also contains lots of digital information about the

divers and the worm's functions.)

NEUTRAL POV - UNDERWATER - EXT. INDOMITABLE

The worm follows the Divers into the hull.

WORM POV - INT. ENGINE ROOM -

It trails the Divers past debris and bodies of crewman.

SAME SHOT - VIDEO SCREEN - WORM POV -

The Divers react, and the worm follows them into...

PASSAGEWAY - UNDERWATER - NEUTRAL POV - INT. INDOMITABLE -

The Divers and worm travel to a HATCH COVERED WITH METAL BARS.

Lighting the welding torches, they try to cut through the metal

bars... Unsuccessfully.

VIDEO SCREEN - WORM POV -

One of the Divers turns to the worm's camera. He SPEAKS into his

diving helmet's microphone:

INT. SEA DOLPHIN BRIDGE -

Stamper turns to Harmsway:

NEUTRAL POV - UNDERWATER - PASSAGEWAY -

The worm moves into position to grind through the hatch. A protective

cover slides over the lens, and the grinder whorls into life.

CLOSER ON THE WORM - The grinder stalls for an instant as it

encounters the titanium bars.

STILL CLOSER - One of the URANIUM GRINDING TEETH SNAPS OFF as it hits

the titanium, and starts to grind through.

NEW ANGLE

Once past the bars, the grinder cuts easily through the steel door.

Trapped air bursts out from inside the compartment. The Divers push

the worm to one side; two of them enter the hold with lights. The

worm follows. The two other divers remain behind to feed the worm's

flexible tubing through the door.

INT. BILGE HOLD - UNDERWATER -

The Divers' lights illuminate the hold: STACKS OF GOLD BARS, as far

as the eye can see.

INT. BRIDGE - SEA DOLPHIN II -

Harmsway looks at the video screen.

INT. BILGE HOLD - UNDERWATER -

The worm closes its "eye", revs up its grinders, and attacks the

first pile of gold Bars. It runs through them like butter.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BANK OF ENGLAND - NIGHT

The bloodletting and recriminations have begun. This plays fast:

Roebuck looks at Bond with great surprise. Bond continues:

EXT. SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT

Harmsway walks along the side of the ship, observing the operation:

The WORM'S DREDGING PUMP sucks up the ground-up GOLD AND WATER SLUR-

RY, (through the TUBE hanging over the side,) and dumps it into a

SERIES OF SLUICES. At each stage the gold nuggets fall to the bottom

of the sluice, and excess water flows off the side of the ship.

AT THE STERN HOLD -

where all the water has been drained off, leaving a cascade of gold

nuggets pouring into the ship's hold -

HARMSWAY reaches into the shimmering cascade, and takes a hand-full

of gold. He sees Stamper approaching.

He drops the gold back in the hold.

INT. HALLWAY - BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT -

M and Bond, striding down a hallway to exit the building.

They've come to a door. Pause as he opens it. He explains:

She nods and pushes through the door. He follows.

EXT. BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS -

They've arrived at her car. The door is already open.

She turns, freezes Bond with a look:

Bond reacts to the comeuppance. She continues:

EXT. 'HARMSWAY BUILDING' (HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK) - HONG KONG - DUSK

Super: HONG KONG. Harmsway's helicopter is perched atop the famous

tinker-toy-styled building in the Central district.

INT. PENTHOUSE BOARDROOM - DUSK

A CHINESE CHOP comes down firmly on a legal document. GENERAL LI (of

the People's Revolutionary Army) is seated with a squad of lawyers:

The document is passed across to HARMSWAY, sitting with his own legal

counsel. One of the men is WHISPERING TO HIM, INTENSELY:

Harmsway waves the lawyer off, silencing him. Addresses the General:

Nervous chuckles around the table, but the General is reserved.

He puts the pen to the paper, and BREAKS THE PEN. Alarmed looks.

From behind, Stamper hands him a pen. Harmsway innocently starts to

sign in RED INK -

He takes General Li's pen, and signs his name with a flourish.

EXT. ROOF OF 'HARMSWAY BUILDING' -

Under the whirring blades of the chopper, Harmsway bids farewell to

General Li. He and Stamper get in helicopter.

CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER -

As Harmsway waves good-bye from the window, the helicopter rises,

REVEALING a METAL CABLE attached to the LANDING SKID.

WIDER -

The cable leads to a spool, which runs to the FIFTH METAL VENTILATION

SHAFT Harmsway referred to in the last scene.

INT. HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE -

Harmsway pops open a bottle of champagne.

RETURN ON ROOFTOP HELIPAD -

The General SEES THE CABLE GROW TAUT AROUND THE VENTILATION SHAFT.

He reacts with horror.

INT. HELICOPTER/HARMSWAY ROOFTOP POV -

Harmsway glances down to watch the VENTILATION SHAFT TOPPLE onto the

General and his aides, scattering them like rats.

In the chopper, the pilot cuts the cable, and Harmsway lifts a

champagne glass:

AERIAL - SKIES ABOVE STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

A BRITISH MILITARY C-130 airship is dropping sono-buoys into the

water from a low altitude. me plane veers off, revealing A BRITISH

SEA KING command and control helicopter, hovering above.

INT. SEA KING HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE - DAY

Bond holds a map of the channel. He's standing over several CREWMAN

seated at radar, sonar, and navigation consoles.

They hear a SHARP DINGING SOUND -

The man points at one of the screens, where Bond sees a COMPUTER

GENERATED MAP OF THE SEA FLOOR, with the FAINT OUTLINE of a WARSHIP.

He types in some commands on a keyboard, and a 3-D rendering of a

boat appears on another computer screen. Lots of data:

They look down and see an HNN (Harmsway News Network) boat.

NEW ANGLE - EXT. SEA RING CHOPPER & HNN BOAT -

The chopper hovers above the HNN boat -

EXT. HNN WORLD HEADQUARTERS (PETRONAS TOWERS)- KUALA LUMPUR - DAY

We're looking up at the world's tallest building: The 1500' twin

Petronas Towers. (They look like an architectural collaboration

between Friz Lang and H.G. Wells.) At the 50th floor, there's a sky

bridge connecting the buildings, where -

INT. SKY BRIDGE - (HNN HEADQUARTERS) - DAY

Elliot Harmsway strides out of an elevator (in Tower 1,) into a group

of waiting assistants. Without breaking stride -

His EXECUTIVE SECRETARY rushes to keep up, reading from a pad, as

they cross the sky bridge to HNN's main reception area, in Tower 2:

They've passed from the bridge, through reception, into:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - HNN HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

A glass conference roam, whose PARTIALLY CLOSED BLINDS obscure the

view of the MAMMOTH HNN NEWS CENTER. (We'll see this, in full,

later.) Meanwhile, a DOZEN RAMBUNCTIOUS EDITORS react to:

INT. SEA KING HELICOPTER - AIRBORNE - DAY

Frowning, Bond peers at the Sonar Operator's screen.

The operator shakes his head. The pilot calls back from the cockpit:

EXT. COASTAL INLET - MARSHLAND - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY

The Sea King comes in above several police cars and boats. Bond

jumps the last ten feet, and the chopper peels off.

Bond turns to look: It's JACK WADE.

As Bond moves off, WADE SNIFFS THE AIR, savoring the aroma:

NEW ANGLE -

A POLICEMEN pulls a white sheet from the body. (We don't see it.)

Bond and Wade look down at something gruesome:

Bond shakes his head grimly.

The POLICEMAN has an animated conversation with FISHERMAN. Then:

EXT. 'THE RUNNING DOG' CIGARETTE BOAT - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

Smashing through the water at breakneck speed. Wade and Bond yell

over the engines.

Bond looks at Wade: The man remains, forever deranged.

EXT. PORT KLANG - ESTABLISHING - DAY

The Harbor Master's tower overlooks a small armada of yachts, fishing

boats, etc. A series of long dockways jut out into the harbor.

CIGARETTE BOAT - (PORT KLANG - WATERWAY) - DAY

Wade's boat is moving slowly along the waterway at the end of the

docks. Looking off, Bond spots the Harbor Master's Tower:

Wade turns the boat down one of the dock channels.

NEW ANGLE - WADE/BOND'S POV - DOCKWAY CHANNEL -

A SLEEK LAUNCH is ROARING TOWARDS them, on a dead collision course.

A WOMAN in a baseball cap is at the wheel.

WADE pulls his boat to the right; the LAUNCH ROARS AROUND THEM,

rocking the cigarette boat with its wake.

BOTH BOND and WADE clock the woman - who we will later learn is

SIDNEY WINCH. Wade stares after her:

Wade scowls, setting the boat back on course.

DOCKSIDE - PORT KLANG - DAY -

Bond hops off the boat, securing the lines. Wade joins him.

Finished tying the boat, they walk toward the Harbor Master's office.

INT. HARBOR MASTER OFFICE - PORT KLANG - DAY

The local Malay harbor master puts a stack of charts on the counter.

Bond takes the clipboard -

INSERT CLIPBOARD - read signature: SIDNEY WINCH.

Bond returns the clipboard:

EXT. HARBOR MASTER'S TOWER - DAY

Bond emerges, carrying the charts, along with Wade.

EXT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

Palm trees, torch lights, and Rolls Royces.

INT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

A local band plays on the verandah. We find Wade at a POKER TABLE

with five local Malay Chinese. He CUTS THE CARDS, exuberantly:

And then - moving through a beaded glass curtain - we find Bond, in a

white dinner jacket, sitting with CAPTAIN CHEONG. The Captain is

elegant, mid-5O's, eye patch. (To be put into local dialect.)

NEW ANGLE - THE BAR -

SIDNEY WINCH, about 32, tough, smart, and (here's a surprise,)

beautiful, is ordering a drink when Bond appears:

Very slowly, Sidney turns to Bond. She looks him up and down - as if

deciding whether this specimen is worth her time. Her conclusion: A

definite - though skeptical - maybe. She gives him a sultry smile:

The BARTENDER APPEARS.

She steps back REVEALING a huge SAMOAN, TARO, wearing a dark suit and

tie, sitting on a stool. Taro smiles menacingly at Bond.

Bond analyzes the situation: 1) She's with a thug. 2) She's in marine

salvage. 3) She went to the Harbor Master's office for the charts.

4) She's a smart-ass. He decides to see if he can rattle her:

She exits. Turning his back on Taro, Bond watches her cross the

room. Taro places a huge hand on Bond's shoulder -

And from BOND'S POV - Sidney greets HARMSWAY with a big hug.

Watching this, Bond seethes with memory of Paris and his hatred of

Harmsway. Taro tightens his grip -

But before he finishes, Bond spins, and: 1) slams Taro's head on the

bar, 2) snatches the ice-pick from the bartender, 3) yanks Taro back-

ward by his collar, 4) slams the ice-pick through Taro's tie into the

wooden bar, and 5) kicks the stool out from under the goon.

Taro is now hanging by his tie, from the bar, choking.

Bond takes a moment to straighten his own bow-tie. Wade appears,

jubilant, with a wad of cash:

EXT. A DESERTED MARINA - MORNING -

Bond walks down a long dock towards a lone boat, moored at the end.

EXT./INT. BOAT AT MARINA - MORNING -

Bond looks around furtively, before climbing aboard the sleek ocean-

going craft. On the aft-deck, there's a large covered object.

As Bond reaches for the CABIN DOOR, it opens by itself - and a

succession of THREE YOUNG ENGLISH WOMEN in STRING BIKINIS emerge.

Bond turns from the door to watch the women. He hears:

Q emerges from the cabin in a blazer and an ascot. He's irritated:

Q walks to the large object on the aft-deck. Pulls off a tarp:

Bond nods, and LOOKS AT a distraction from the GIRLS IN BIKINIS.

STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

Clear skies and blue water. The only vessel in sight is a thirty-

five foot SPORT FISHING BOAT underway at full throttle.

EXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT, FLYING BRIDGE - DAY -

Wade at the helm; Bond next to him, near sonar, holding Q's map.

Wade pulls back on the throttle.

AERIAL - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/STRAIT OF MALACCA) - DAY -

The boat starts a wide turn -

NEW ANGLE - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/ROCK OUTCROPPING/STRAIT) - DAY -

And we're back at the outcropping where the Indomitable sank. The

SPORT FISHING BOAT is trolling against a background of sandy beaches

and the lush green hills of Sumatra.

FLYING BRIDGE -

Wade scans the shore; Bond studies the sonar display.

INSERT SONAR SCREEN -

The murky electronic outline of a ship.

BACK TO SCENE -

Bond watches the sonar screen. Wade slows engines, consults charts.

AN ANCHOR BEING PITCHED INTO THE WATER - (BOW OF SPORT FISHING BOAT) -

By Wade. Bond is strapping on his scuba tank.

Bond glances at the air gauge on his tanks.

Bond gathers up FLARES, and sits on the gunwale.

Wade pulls back his shirt to reveal TWO SIX-SHOOTERS.

Bond rolls backward into the water and disappears.

UNDERWATER -

Bond swims to the anchor line, and begins pulling himself downward,

handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom.

UNDERWATER BOTTOM -

Bond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom.

Checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel.

EXT. INDOMITABLE - UNDERWATER -

Ahead, in the dimness, a huge gray shape looms out of the sand.

Bond lights a FLARE, and the scene is suddenly alive with color.

From Bond's position, the hull seems to go on forever before being

lost beyond range of his flare. Bond checks his air gauge.

INSERT GAUGES -

Depth: 283 feet - Air capacity: 3/4 tank remaining.

BACK TO SCENE -

Bond swims to the hole in the side of the Indomitable. He pauses to

study the damage. Then enters.

INT. ENGINE ROOM - UNDERWATER -

Bond sees the damage on the passageway door. Swims through it.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - UNDER WATER -

The flare throws eerie shadows along the corridor; Bond swims to the

busted bilge-hold hatch. Again, he pauses to examine the marks made

by the worm. He drops into the hold.

INT. CARGO HOLD - UNDER WATER -

The gold is gone. Bond swims a few yards in: Nothing. A vast empty

space. Bond's flare sputters and dies. He drops it, lights another.

As he turns to exit, SOMETHING GLINTS on the deck below the hatch.

He moves toward it.

NEW ANGLE - CLOSER -

A half-chewed GOLD BAR is wedged between a brace and the bulkhead.

Bond reaches for it, feeling the worm's drill marks on the gold.

Just as he yanks the bar out, a MORAY EEL lashes out from behind the

brace, baring its teeth.

Still clutching the gold bar, Bond jumps back, and shoots up, into:

PASSAGE WAY -(INT. INDOMITABLE) - UNDER WATER -

where he collides with something floating just below the ceiling.

Dropping the flare on the impact, Bond twists around to see:

THE FACE OF A FLOATING DEAD SAILOR.

BACK TO SCENE -

Throwing wildly gyrating shadows, the flare drops to the deck, roll-

ing under some debris. Regaining his composure, Bond SLIPS THE GOLD

BAR INTO A WEBBED SACK ON HIS BELT, then moves to retrieve the flare.

CLOSE ON HATCH/DECK -

Bond reaches for the flare, under a section of the torn hatch cover.

He notices the BROKEN URANIUM GRINDING TOOTH. He picks it up, stuffs

it into his sack, and swims off.

UNDERWATER BOTTOM - ANCHOR -

Bond swims to the anchor line, grabs hold, and starts up. On the

way, he glances at his gauges:

INSERT GAUGES -

Depth: 160 feet - Air capacity: below RED LINE - empty. The ambient

light level on the gauges suddenly DARKENS.

BOND LOOKS UP TO THE SURFACE -

HIS POV -

A black HULL has blotted out the light... And SOMETHING LARGE AND

HEAVY IS FALLING straight at 007.

BOND -

kicks away from the anchor-line just as a 1000 POUND ANCHOR streaks

by. He looks up again:

THREE DIVERS ARE IN THE WATER.

One carries a strange-looking HARPOON-TYPE GUN; another trails a

CABLE. The divers have fanned out, looking for 007.

BOND -

Realizes his best chance is to take one of the men hostage.

Flashing his KNIFE, Bond cuts the cord to his gold/uranium sack,

STUFFS THE SACK INTO HIS BAGGY SWIM TRUNKS.

Bond rockets up, SLAMMING INTO DIVER #1. A confusion of bubbles.

And just as Bond overcomes the man - spinning him around, holding the

knife to the diver's throat -

DIVER #2 SHOOTS the HARPOON-TYPE GUN, and A DOLPHIN NET explodes out,

ENVELOPING BOND AND THE DIVER in a mesh. (Note: This is a real,

'fish friendly' research tool.)

Diver #3 HOOKS THE CABLE he's been trailing onto the net, and -

EXT. SEA -

The net erupts through the surface, is hauled up into the air, and

deposited on -

THE DECK OF A SELF-PROPELLED SALVAGE BARGE.

(An old scow, with a large crane, two-story deck-house, and a crew

whose idea of 'cruise-wear' runs to tattoos and grotesque scars.

BOND'S POV - THROUGH HIS DIVING MASK -

As the water drains from his mask, Bond sees the mesh being pulled

away, and FIVE GOONS come into focus, training AUTOMATIC WEAPONS on

him. (Bond still has the diver from behind, knife to his throat.)

One of the goons reaches forward, ripping off Bond's mask. 007 sees:

TARO - (EXT. SALVAGE BARGE, DECK) -

Brandishing an UZI at Bond, with a malevolent smile:

Bond sticks the knife into the deck, and releases the hostage.

The men grab Bond roughly, and shove him next to Wade.

Bond and Wade are frog-marched to the bridge, passing under the gaze

of various cutthroat crew members. Wade is completely unfazed.

Bond gives Wade a look.

Bond glances up at a crew member, SHARPENING A MACHETE, smiling.

INT. BRIDGE - SALVAGE BARGE - DAY

We're back in Bond-land: A high-tech control room, with lots of

monitors and white-suited TECHNICIANS. Bond and Wade are pushed

through the-door, followed by Taro and the two goons.

The "Captain" turns from a monitor: IT'S SIDNEY.

There's a flicker of doubt in her eyes. She turns to Taro:

Taro holds up the BOND'S DIVING BELT, indicating 'nothing'. Angrily:

The men look at Bond - wearing only swim trunks. Nobody moves.

Frowning, Sidney moves to Bond. As she REACHES INTO HIS TRUNKS, we

cut to THEIR FACES. THEIR EYES ARE LOCKED ON EACH OTHER:

BOND WINCES. She's goosed him.

Returning to the WIDE SHOT, she opens the sack. SHOWS THE GOLD:

She scowls, takes out the URANIUM TOOTH. Looks at it, blankly, and

holds it out to a TECHNICIAN, who examines it.

Just then, a CREWMAN BURSTS IN:

Taro motions with his Uzi for Bond and Wade to follow...

But BOND hesitates, LOOKING BACK AT THE TECHNICIAN with the URANIUM.

007 wants to get it, but Taro nudges him out with the gun muzzle.

EXT. MALACCA STRAIT - DAY

A BRITISH NAVAL CUTTER is pulling alongside the barge - SEA SIREN

WAILING, crew members in battle gear, FORWARD GATLING GUN manned.

ON THE BARGE - Sidney and Co. stand, weapons ready.

Bond turns to Sidney, who's grabbed a bullhorn of her own.

Bond and Wade exchange an amused/helpless glance - as if they both

know what's coming next. There's a pause, then -

THE CRUISER'S GATLING GUN ERUPTS WITH AN EARDRUM-SHATTERING SALVO.

It's only a warning shot, but -

EVERYONE ON THE BARGE DIVES FOR THE DECK... Except for Bond and

Wade, who might as well be having tea. Bond looks down at Taro,

cowering on the boards.

NEW ANGLE - (CUTTER/BARGE) - DAY

An ARMED BOARDING PARTY is coming across an aluminum bridge that has

extended from the Cutter onto the barge.

Bond and Wade are stunned. The Marines move in. Bond struggles -

As TWO MARINES with automatic rifles take Bond and Wade across the

folding bridge -

Pause. She expects him to ask "And yours?" but he doesn't.

As Sidney yells "NO!" - THE FORWARD GATLING GUN erupts to life. One

short, bone rattling burst CUTS THE CHAIN.

As she floats away, Sidney calls out to the Captain, Bond and Wade:

EXT. DECK - THE CUTTER - DAY -

Bond, Wade and the Captain.

EXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

As Bond and Wade push away from the Naval Cutter:

EXT. COASTAL ROADWAY - MALAYSIA - (BOND CAR) - DAY -

Bond'- car travels through the tropical landscape, turning at a sign

for Kuala Lumpur.

INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - COASTAL ROADWAY - DAY -

As Bond downshifts in anticipation of an upcoming hill, his CAR PHONE

RINGS. Before answering it, he looks down at:

INSERT - DASHBOARD - DIGITAL DISPLAY PANEL -

Displayed on separate lines:, "INCOMING CALL." "ORIGIN: (the display

runs through numbers until it hits on) 763-4733." "NAME: (blinking)

UNKNOWN. "STATUS: (blinking) SECURE."

RETURN ON BOND -

Reacting - the information is curious. Bond picks up the phone.

INT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE -

Harmsway is perched on a desk. In the background, THROUGH HIS OPEN

OFFICE DOOR, we can see Harmsway's EXECUTIVE SECRETARY serving

someone coffee from a SILVER TRAY - but we can't see who it is.

RETURN ON BOND - (INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING) -

INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

Bond hangs up, and drives with renewed determination.

INT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE -

Harmsway hangs up; STAMPER is standing nearby. Harmsway throws a

concerned glance at his office, then turns to Stamper:

EXT. KUALA LUMPUR - ROADWAY -(BOND CAR) - LATE AFTERNOON -

Bond's car approaches the camera, passes it, and heads for HARMSWAY

TOWERS, looming over Kuala Lumpur in the distance.

EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - STREET LEVEL - LATE AFTERNOON -

Bond's car passes the front of the building, and drives down a ramp

into an underground car park.

INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - (HARMSWAY TOWERS) -

Passing NEWSPAPER LOADING DOCKS (with trucks displaying both the

"TOMORROW" and "HNN" logos, and HUM-VEES used by building security,)

Bond pulls into the VALET AREA -

Where a cheerful YOUNG PR WOMAN and VALET wait. Both wear the

colorful BLAZER used by all Harmsway Building service personnel.

She points to a spot near the loading docks. Bond drives off.

INT. BOND'S CAR -

Bond backs into the space, thinking about the (inevitable) quick get-

away. He looks through the windshield, surveying the area.

BOND'S POV - UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -

TWO BURLY SECURITY GUARDS (in Harmsway Blazers,) stand behind a

bulletproof security desk. There's a METAL DETECTOR by the door.

BACK TO SCENE (INT. BOND'S CAR) -

Reaching inside his jacket, Bond REMOVES HIS GUN, and HIDES IT in a

compartment under the dashboard.

INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -

The PR WOMAN joins Bond as he locks the car with the REMOTE CONTROL.

Following her through the metal detector, Bond scans the security

devices at the guard's desk: Lots of cameras, sensors, and alarms.

EXT. PRESSROOM OBSERVATION ARCADE -

Bond and the PR Woman step off an escalator onto an open arcade with

GLASS WINDOWS looking down into a mammoth NEWSPAPER PRINTING PLANT.

INT. PRESSROOM BALCONY -

The NOISE FROM THE PRINTING PRESSES is deafening. Bond and the PR

WOMAN walk down a METAL STAIRCASE to the pressroom floor, where -

Harmsway (wearing a printer's smock and newsprint cap,) is joking

with SEVERAL PRESSMEN - a fresh issue of "Tomorrow" outstretched in

his hands.

INT. DRESSING ALCOVE - OFF THE PRESSROOM -

Harmsway is hanging up his smock in the short hallway that leads from

the press room to an elevator. There's a SINK in the room.

He moves to the sink to wash his hands. Turns on the faucets:

Bond SMILES WRYLY, looking at Harmsway hunched over the sink:

Harmsway smiles to himself, acknowledging the jibe... But decides to

ignore it. He turns off the faucet, dries his hands -

He pulls on his 2000 Saville Row suit-jacket.

Harmsway turns, and presses the ELEVATOR BUTTON. The doors open,

instantly. HE SMILES:

INT. ELEVATOR -

The doors close. Bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling.

Harmsway is about to take great delight in making Bond squirm:

He looks up at the digital readout, going from 40 to 50.

The doors open:

Harmsway motions for Bond to exit. They step out into:

INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY ("ROGUES GALLERY") - LATE AFTERNOON

A short hallway lined with OIL PORTRAITS of Harmsway's ancestors.

Double doors at both ends. (People passing through.) As they walk -

He pushes through a door, into:

INT. HNN NEWS CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON -

A cavernous THREE STORY ROOM bristling with activity. At the center

is the main HNN ANCHOR DESK, (where a news broadcast is in progress,)

surrounded by scores of reporter's desks a la CNN.

Around the perimeter of the room are VARIOUS TV STUDIOS looking out

on Kuala Lumpur. All are broadcasting: A Larry King-type chat show;

MTV; SPORTS; a KITCHEN where a chef is preparing something flambeed.

With its walls of monitors, equipment, and control rooms, the effect

is overwhelming. Harmsway will walk Bond around the perimeter:

He glances at the SATELLITE CONTROL ROOM, with a NASA-type WORLD MAP.

He stops at a VIDEO TERMINAL. Begins to type.

INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S MI-6 COVER -

INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S KGB FILE -

INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S CHINESE FILE -

Bond is not amused. Harmsway is enjoying himself:

As they leave, Bond is frustrated by Harmsway's "I don't care what

you think you know - I can crush you" attitude... And now, Harmsway

plans (and the operative word here is plans,) to use Bond, to tie off

the one other loose thread in his perfect crime:

INT. HARMSWAY'S OFFICE -

The DOOR opens and Harmsway enters, followed by Bond. He calls to

someone we don't see:

REVEAL: SIDNEY is sitting across from his desk.

She freezes in mid-sentence, seeing Bond. Bond is equally surprised.

Harmsway sits, and addresses Bond, matter-of-factly:

Bond isn't enjoying this charade.

Before Bond can answer -

Bond and Harmsway react - with entirely different concerns: Harmsway

wasn't expecting her to have proof; Bond knows that if she shows him

the gold, (or worse, the uranium tooth,) Harmsway will probably kill

both of them to destroy the evidence, and witnesses.

Sidney cuts Bond off, DROPPING THE GOLD BAR on Harmsway's desk.

Alarmed, Bond wants to stop Sidney from reaching into her bag again -

Too late. She drops the uranium tooth on his desk.

Silence. Harmsway and Bond exchange a sober look. Then:

HE PRESSES AN ALARM UNDER HIS DESK. Bond reaches for the DRILL TOOTH.

Harmsway stands, comes around the desk:

He reaches to kiss Sidney - and looks in her eyes a second too long.

Watching them exit, his smile turns hard and bitter.

INT. ELEVATOR HALLWAY - DAY -

As the Executive Secretary escorts them to the elevator, Bond glances

out the PICTURE WINDOW, with its view of the other tower.

BOND'S POV - EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS -

Five floors directly down is the GLASS-ENCLOSED SKY BRIDGE; just

above him, he sees TWO WINDOW WASHERS being pulled up on a TWO MAN

SCAFFOLD.

BACK TO SCENE -

A CHIME SOUNDS; the elevator doors open. Bond and Sidney ad-lib

good-byes to the secretary and get in.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Sidney presses the button for "1". Bond glances at the FLOOR INDI-

CATOR with reads "55" - clocks the SECURITY CAMERA - and starts

looking for an ESCAPE PANEL. Sidney watches out of the corner of her

eye, thinking he's nuts.

He glances up at the escape panel at the rear of the car.

Bond ignores the insult, explaining as he moves under the panel:

He nods to the FLOOR INDICATOR. She looks: 60, 65, 70. IT STOPS.

Bond reaches down to her -

THE DOORS OPEN. She looks at his outstretched hand with disdain:

INT. 70TH FLOOR -- DAY

Sidney comes out onto a floor still under construction. The elevator

doors CLOSE behind her. To the right, she sees STAMPER and a

Harmsway-blazered GUARD, with MACHINE PISTOLS.

On Stamper's reply -

He lunges for her, grabs her, spins her around, overwhelming her.

She struggles, yelling:

Using Sidney as a HUMAN SHIELD, Stamper marches her in front of the

closed elevator doors. The guard follows. THEY POSITION THEMSELVES

FOR A MASSACRE. Reaching around Sidney, Stamper pulls out his RADIO:

A beat. It opens. The men unleash a HAIL OF BULLETS, then realize -

NEW ANGLE - (INT. ELEVATOR) -

The car is empty. Stamper perplexed. Pushing Sidney in front of

him, he enters the elevator, cautiously... When, suddenly:

BOND SWINGS DOWN OUT OF THE ESCAPE PANEL (like an athlete on a high-

bar) FEET FIRST - barely clearing Sidney's head as he KICKS Stamper

and the Guard in their faces. They go flying backwards.

Bond jumps down, grabs Sidney -

And boosts her into the escape panel, following her up.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE THE ELEVATOR - (CONTINUOUS) -

Bond and Sidney rush forward to the front wall as -

STAMPER AND THE GUARD -

Recover, grab their guns, move to the threshold, and START RAKING THE

CEILING WITH GUNFIRE.

ELEVATOR SHAFT -

Bond presses his body against Sidney, on the front wall, trying to

SHIELD HER as BULLETS RIP UP THE FLOOR behind them. With his free

hand, Bond reaches up for the LATCH to open the door above them.

INT. ELEVATOR -

Stamper stops shooting. Moves to the rear of the cab, under the

escape panel. Peers up. Sees nothing. Turns to the Guard:

ELEVATOR SHAFT -

Stamper's head pokes up through the hole just as Bond and Sidney have

disappeared into -

INT. HALLWAY - (ELEVATOR BANK) - 71ST FLOOR.

Squeezing out from between the elevator doors, (which immediately

close behind them,) Bond and Sidney encounter a group of STUNNED

OFFICE WORKERS, waiting for the elevator.

As Bond and Sidney scamper off -

RETURN ON STAMPER - IN THE ELEVATOR -

INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY - ANOTHER PART OF THE BUILDING -

Harmsway is striding towards the SECURITY CENTER, RADIO in hand:

BOND AND SIDNEY - (INT. HALLWAY) -

Moving cautiously toward a CORNER of ANOTHER HALLWAY.

At the corner, Bond STOPS, SEEING A GUARD, farther down the hall (his

back to them) CHECKING DOORS.

Bond frowns, but doesn't have the time to argue. They start doing a

"DUCK AND COVER" in and out of doorways TO SNEAK UP ON HIM.

INT. SECURITY CENTER -

Harmsway bursts in on GUARDS watching a WALL OF SECURITY MONITORS.

INSERT VIDEO MONITOR - (SURVEILLANCE SHOT OF HALLWAY) -

Bond and Sidney have just come into frame, sneaking up on the GUARD.

CLOSE ON THE GUARD - (INT. HALLWAY) -

BAM. BOND DECKS HIM.

Bond kneels, grabs the GUARD'S MACHINE PISTOL, and CLIPS, just as -

TWO GUARDS have entered from a STAIRCASE DOOR, hoisting MAC-10's. In

an instant: (1) Bond lets go a BURST. (2) The Guards SHOOT back,

diving for cover in the staircase door. (3) Bond rolls, (4) Pushes

Sidney into an open DOORWAY, and (5) returns A BURST, from -

INT. SMALL KITCHEN/COPIER ROOM -

Sidney is shaken. As Bond stands in the doorway, guarding them -

Bond glances back at the KITCHEN SUPPLIES. GETS AN IDEA. He sud-

denly TWISTS, SMASHING the BUTT OF HIS GUN down on some GLASSWARE on

the counter, then TWISTS BACK, returning a BURST OF GUNFIRE.

She thinks he's nuts, but squeezes next to him. Handing her the gun:

Sidney scowls - as Bond moves off-camera - when suddenly, BULLET HITS

RIP UP THE DOOR FRAME. She jumps, TERRIFIED.

Bond looks at her from the PHOTO-COPYING MACHINE, where he is YANKING

OUT the TONER CARTRIDGE. He offers a simple piece of advice:

Sidney frowns... Turns... And as she LETS THE GUN RIP, we cut to:

INT. STAIRWELL - (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING) -

Stamper, running up steps with the guard. They exit into:

A SHORT SERVICE HALLWAY - 71ST. FLOOR -

They rush though it, bursting through a door into:

THE ELEVATOR BANK HALLWAY -

Stamper and the Guard start hunting Bond.

RETURN ON SIDNEY (HALLWAY/KITCHEN) -

As she continues to exchange fire with the guards...

BOND, (having broken the toner cartridge open,) is DUMPING THE TONER

in a coffee can. He reaches for a BOX of sugar

And (with GUNFIRE SFX over,) Bond sweeps the BROKEN DISH into the

can, and drops his Q LIGHTER in the mix.

He moves to Sidney, in the doorway. Kneels. In-between shots:

Bond glances at his watch, timing the bomb. The guards shoot; she

shoots back, then explains:

Bond nods, continuing to look at his watch. Glances at her:

Bond reaches forward to toss the coffee can -

He tosses the can, and PULLS HER BACKWARDS, covering her.

NEW ANGLE - THE HALLWAY -

The GUARDS spring from the door, rushing forward to storm Bond's

position - just as the COFFEE CAN rolls towards them, and EXPLODES.

RETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN -

Taking the gun, the two of them start for the door when -

NEW ANGLE - OPPOSITE END OF THE HALLWAY - CORNER -

Stamper and the GUARD have arrived at the corner, BLASTING.

RETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN -

Swiftly, Bond grabs a JUG of CLEANER from under the sink, moves to

the door, and ROLLS IT DOWN THE HALL in Stamper's direction.

STAMPER AND THE GUARD - (HALLWAY CORNER) -

Anticipate a bomb. They move back.

BOND AND SIDNEY (INT. KITCHEN) -

INT. HALLWAY -

Bond and Sidney BREAK for the STAIRCASE DOOR. (Where the first Guards

were shooting at them from.) TWISTING AROUND, Bond lets a BURST go

in Stamper's direction, as he stoops to scoop up one of the dead

guards' MAC-l0's.

INSERT - BOND'S BULLETS RIP UP THE JUG OF CLEANER.

BOND AND SIDNEY ESCAPE FROM THE HALLWAY -

STAMPER -

Cowers, waiting for the jug to blow up... Then realizes:

HARMSWAY, IN THE SECURITY CENTER -

INT. STAIRWELL - LANDING -

Bond leans over the railing. Sees GUARDS coming UP. SHOOTS.

They go up about three stairs, and Sidney sees GUARDS descending.

Bond and Sidney bound up the stairs through a METAL DOOR, just as -

INT. HALLWAY -

Stamper and the Guard bound down the hallway, heading for the door.

INT. SECURITY CENTER -

Harmsway smiles, watching Bond on a monitor:

EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TERRACE SETBACK - TWILIGHT -

It's magic hour as Bond and Sidney rush out onto the setback. Bond

sees a WINDOW WASHER'S RIG. And although Sidney asks -

Bond's first concern is to make sure Stamper can't get them. Amidst

a pile of CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, he spots a PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN. He

grabs it, and -

BANG. BANG. BANG. He fires 3 NAILS through the door into the frame.

Now, Bond moves to the WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - a two-man bucket-like

scaffold ON TRACKS, with TWO LEATHER SAFETY HARNESSES inside, and a

LARGE CABLE SPOOL/MOTOR that stays on the roof.

Approaching it, Bond looks over the side:

BOND'S POV - LOOKING DOWN FROM 72ND FLOOR -

Twenty stories below is the sky bridge. 50 stories below that, the

ground. It's a long, long, way down.

RETURN ON BOND - AT THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - TERRACE SET-BACK -

INT. STAIRWELL -

Darting up the few steps, Stamper and Guards arrive at the door. He

tries to open it. Won't budge.

One of the guards grabs it from inside a FIRE CABINET. He hands the

AX to Stamper, who takes the first SWING AT THE DOOR.

RETURN ON BOND - TERRACE SET-BACK - EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

Bond is positioning the window washer rig. He explains:

As Bond climbs into the bucket, Sidney peers over the side.

BANG! Behind them, Stamper's AX HAS JUST PENETRATED THE DOOR.

Bond yanks her in, flips switches on the control pod, and starts

down, as fast as they can go.

EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - AERIAL -

Bond and Sidney descend. Tiny specs against the sunset.

INT. STAIRCASE -

Stamper gives the last few chops to the door. He kicks it open.

EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR -

Stamper and the guards rush to the ledge.

BOND AND SIDNEY - DESCENDING ON THE RIG - 60TH FLOOR -

Bond, looking up - for Stamper - and down - to check their progress.

Looking upward, Bond SEES STAMPER peering over the rail. BOND FIRES.

EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - TWILIGHT -

Stamper jumps back from the ledge, enraged. Ax in hand, he moves to

the WINDOW WASHING RIG'S MACHINERY -

And takes a roundhouse swing at the UNSPOOLING CABLE - but instead of

cutting it, the ax BOUNCES OFF, and the RIG SLIDES ON ITS TRACKS.

THE RIG - (STILL DESCENDING) -

Swings! Sidney SCREAMS - almost falling out. Bond grabs her. They

are now 5 STORIES DIRECTLY ABOVE THE SKY BRIDGE, swaying like a giant

pendulum - although still descending.

RETURN ON STAMPER - TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

Having failed at the cable, Stamper goes at the PULLEY feeding it.

He swings. Swings again. With each blow, the pulley shaft weakens.

BOND AND SIDNEY - (WINDOW WASHER'S RIG) -

Dropping in VIOLENT SPURTS - just trying to stay in the damn bucket.

STAMPER - WIELDING THE AX -

Finally, the pulley shaft SHATTERS. THE CABLE GRINDS TO A HALT.

BOND AND SIDNEY -

are stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge.

And with this, he turns, and SHOOTS OUT the adjacent WINDOW.

But as he starts to climb out - SIDNEY SCREAMS! THE CABLE SUDDENLY

DROPS THEM 10 FEET LOWER, BELOW THE WINDOW.

THE TERRACE SET-BACK -

Stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum. It's coming loose

from its moorings.

BOND AND SIDNEY -

look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing what

(she thinks) is certain death:

Bond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before Stamper

cuts the cable. HE GRABS HER:

TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

Stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum. With a GREAT CLAT-

TERING SOUND it SNAPS FREE OF THE MOORINGS, smashes into the wall,

and the whole mechanism CAREENS OVER THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING.

THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG -

Bond and Sidney feel the cable give way. They start to free-fall.

BOND - FIRES HIS MACHINE PISTOL at the glass top of the sky bridge.

THE BULLETS SHATTER THE GLASS -

BOND AND SIDNEY CRASH THROUGH, INTO -

INT. 50TH FLOOR SKY BRIDGE -

Landing on the deck of the bridge. Bond rolls to his feet as -

Fifty stories of cable from above is falling onto the deck. Bond

yanks Sidney to the side of the building, just as THE CABLE DRUM,

PULLEY, AND THE REST OF THE MECHANICS CRASH ON THE WALK-WAY.

72ND FLOOR TERRACE SET-BACK -

Looking down, Stamper flips open his radio.

INT. SECURITY CENTER -

INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -

Bond is moving to the window washer rig debris.

He steps to the side of the bridge, and looks at the railings: Four

inch pipe. Bond begins to work feverishly:

Bond picks up the cable and the leather harnesses.

Bond is slipping the cable around the railing pipe. One loop.

He pulls on the loop to test it. Good enough. Makes a second loop.

Bond tests the second loop. He's satisfied. Turns to her:

Just then, GUARDS APPEAR OUT OF FAR ELEVATOR DOOR. Running, THEY

SHOOT. BOND FIRES A BURST BACK as - A NEW ROUND OF BULLET HITS

BEGINS TO RAIN DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE.

BOND LOOKS UP: Stamper has commandeered a second window washer's

rig, and is descending, FIRING AT THEM.

Bond looks at Sidney -

She locks her arms and legs around him, he snaps the leather harness

around her waist, and they roll over the railing Amidst gunfire.

EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - TWILIGHT

Bond and Sidney fall from the bridge - 50 stories up.

They go down,

And down,

And down -

RETURN ON THE RAILING - (INT. SKY BRIDGE) -

The cable looped around the railing is slowing their descent; the

PAINT ON THE RAILING IS BURNING OFF, and the STEEL itself is STARTING

TO SMOKE from the friction.

BOND AND SIDNEY - DROPPING -

Dropping -

And Dropping.

Looking to the ground, Bond sees the PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY

coming up fast from below. It looks like they're going to get

splattered on the tile floor, when -

RETURN ON THE RAILING - SKY BRIDGE -

The cable comes to the end of its run! It DRAGS THE SPOOL, THE

BUCKET, and all the other MECHANICS to the side of the bridge,

SMASHING AGAINST THE WALL, JAMMING AGAINST THE RAILING.

EXT. THE PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY - TWILIGHT -

Bond and Sidney jerk to a halt. They're swinging about five feet

from the balcony. There's a pause...

Bond PULLS THEM OVER TO THE BALCONY.

INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -

Stamper lands on bridge. He unbuckles his harness, runs to railing,

looks down and sees SIDNEY AND BOND climbing out onto the balcony,

going for the PRESS ROOM DOOR.

INT. PRESS ROOM -

Bond and Sidney enter at the top of the metal stairs Bond came down

earlier to meet Harmsway.

The Presses are running full blast; the noise is deafening.

At the "start" end of the presses - where the paper is fed in - Bond

sees a GIANT ROLL OF NEWSPRINT on a CRANE, about to be loaded.

Directly beyond this is the door to the elevator/wash-up room where

Bond and Harmsway exited earlier. -

Coming out of that DOOR, Bond sees THREE GUARDS in Harmsway Blazers

carrying guns.

BOND shoots the HOOK on the CRANE CARRYING THE NEWSPRINT ROLL.

It CRASHES TO THE GROUND, rolling backwards on the guards. As they

start scrambling around it -

Bond and Sidney race down the stairs, turning in the opposite direc-

tion (toward the finishing end of the press, near the garage...)

They encounter a GORILLA-SIZED PRESSMAN, with an oversized crowbar.

Bond and the Pressman square off. Bond tries to get around him. The

man lifts his crowbar to smash Bond with it. Bond tries to block the

descending crowbar with his gun - but the crowbar snaps it in half.

Bond and the Pressman engage in a short, furious fight - throwing

each other against the side of the press...

Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and

pushes the man back, into a pile of INK DRUMS. Momentarily stunned,

Bond forces the man's head into an OPEN INK DRUM -

And as he comes up, COVERED WITH INK, gasping for air, Sidney bops

him on the head with the crowbar.

Now, Bond and Sidney take off, toward the garage/exit -

But one of the Guards (from the crashing roll of newsprint) darts out

from between the banks of the printing press, tripping Bond.

Bond stumbles, face down - then spins over, kicking up at the Guard

as he comes to finish Bond off.

The Guard stumbles backward -

Crashing against a NEWSPAPER BALING MACHINE. (A large machine that

wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery.)

Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP the

BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up. The only problem is that

as Bond turns -

The LAST GUARD has Sidney in a choke-hold; he's aiming a gun at Bond.

Seemingly at once, (1) Sidney bites the Guard's forearm, (2) Bond

ducks, (3) the Guard shoots wildly, (4) the gun drops, and (5) -

Bond rushes the man, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS INTO THE PRINTING PRESS,

pulling Sidney away at the last moment.

The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and...

The pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn BRIGHT RED.

Spotting more Guards coming down the far staircase, Bond grabs Sidney

and the gun, and runs to the NEWSPAPER DELIVERY CHUTE.

They jump into it, sliding down, and around an ALUMINUM CHUTE into:

INT. GARAGE - HARMSWAY TOWERS.

Bond and Sidney come out near a TROLLEY stacked with newspapers.

Hearts pounding - having left the pressroom's deafening noise -

they're ready for almost anything, except what they HEAR:

The SOUND OF ONE MAN APPLAUDING. A polite, almost bored clapping.

Harmsway is standing with TEN GUARDS, shoulder to shoulder, in a

straight line, all HOLDING WEAPONS on Sidney and Bond.

Harmsway can't help his ego:

Bond SLIDES THE GUN several feet in front of him... And THROWS A LOOK

TO HIS CAR, noting THE GUARDS ARE LINED UP DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH.

Bond begins to scheme.

Bond sneaks his hand in his pocket.

Bond has removed the CAR REMOTE CONTROL. He palms it.

Holding the remote control, Bond puts his hands on his head. He's

manipulating the control into the right position to use it.

He finally has the remote control in the right position.

Suddenly, BOND'S CAR ENGINE STARTS WITH A ROAR. The GUARDS TURN, in

shock TOWARDS THE CAR, as:

BOND retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls Sidney behind the

newspaper trolley, while -

THE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE, sending the guards scrambling.

BOND takes his position with Sidney.

007 begins shooting, as -

THE GUARDS START BLASTING THE EMPTY MOVING CAR. They manage to shoot

out the headlights, while -

BOND is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same

time. As bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them -

Bond eyes her for one split second. Points at the guards:

Sidney starts to shoot as -

THE GUARDS continue to blast away at the car... But:

THE WINDOWS DON'T SHATTER.

THE ARMOR-PLATED SIDE-PANELS ONLY DENT WITH BULLET HITS...

THE TIRES DON'T GO FLAT.

There's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as BOND STEERS

THE CAR TO THEIR POSITION, where the door opens automatically.

The two of them make a break for the car, DIVING INSIDE.

INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - GARAGE -

- Bond guns the engine, slams the transmission into gear. Burning

rubber, GUARDS bounce off the front fenders.

THE GUARDS -

Continue to shoot at the car.

OTHER GUARDS -

Run for the HUM-VEES. Hop in and chase.

INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

Bond flips open a hidden control panel. Flips a switch.

EXT. BACK OF BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

The TAIL-LIGHTS DROP DOWN and MACHINE GUNS start to fire.

INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

Bond glances at the REARVIEW MIRROR. Sees the HUM-VEES. Presses

another switch -

CLOSE ON BOND'S EXHAUST PIPE -

Whoosh! A MISSILE blasts out, trailing smoke as it hones in on -

THE FIRST HUM-VEE.

BOOM! It's decimated.

ANGLE ON HARMSWAY - ON HIS RADIO -

INT. GARAGE - FIRST TURN -

As the car screeches around a corner, the overhead lights go out.

INT. BOND'S CAR -

Bond flips down the visor: A THERMAL IMAGING DISPLAY drops down.

INSERT "HEADS UP" IMAGING DISPLAY -

It looks just like the jet fighter videos from the Gulf War.

INT. GARAGE - SECOND TURN - UP RAMP -

Bond's car roars around a second turn, with sparks flying as it

scrapes the walls. AHEAD, a MASSIVE ONE-PIECE DOOR is FOLDING DOWN

FROM THE CEILING. A city street beyond.

INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING -

Bond flips down a control panel from the RADIO. A DIGITAL DISPLAY

begins to run through a set of numbers. Bond explains:

THE CAR APPROACHES THE CLOSING DOOR AT HIGH SPEED -

BOND SEES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. HE PUNCHES THE MISSILE BUTTON.

TWO MISSILES ROAR OUT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR -

THEY EXPLODE AGAINST THE CLOSING DOOR - TO NO EFFECT.

BOND'S CAR GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER -

SIDNEY SCREAMS! BOND BRACES, AND -

BOOM! CRASH! SILENCE. BLACK. After a moment, we HEAR THE SOUND OF

FOOTSTEPS ON CEMENT.

INT. GARAGE -

The lights come on. The car is a twisted wreck, smashed against the

wall. Bond and Sidney are slumped forward, unconscious.

Harmsway KNOCKS TWICE ON THE GARAGE DOOR, to demonstrate:

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR - HONG KONG - MORNING -

It is early morning in this strange harbor - a place where floating

restaurant rise out of the fog; where an old Chinese man wearing an

LA Laker's jersey practices tai-chi on the bow of an ancient junk;

where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks, computer boxes

and women dressed in Chanel 1996, and Beijing 1256... While the

captains of these small water-taxis chatter away on cell-phones.

At the end of the harbor, dominating this scene, the CAMERA FINDS:

THE FIVE SMOKESTACKS OF THE ABERDEEN HARBOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.

Panning down this massive dockside facility, the image changes to:

THE SAME SCENE ON A 5" PORTABLE VIDEO MONITOR -

With one important difference: There's an HNN logo in lower corner.

NEW ANGLE (EXT. POWER PLANT, FRONT ENTRANCE, WATERSIDE) -

Two VIDEO CAMERAMEN are shooting an ASIAN HNN REPORTER interviewing a

middle-aged CHINESE MAN. We don't see the reporter's face; from the

"over the shoulder" news angle, he's WEARING A HAT.

(There's also HNN BELL JETRANGER HELICOPTER on the ground, and a

seemingly empty HNN BOAT moored to a nearby pier.)

He holds out a MICROPHONE to Chin.

He pushes the microphone closer to Chin's face:

Suddenly, A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE EMERGES FROM THE MICROPHONE... And

CHIN COLLAPSES. The HNN reporter TAKES OFF HIS HAT: IT'S YUNG.

At once, the two cameramen turn: One AIMS his shoulder-mounted video

camera at a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA; the other aims at the FRONT DOOR.

BOOM! ROCKETS shoot out from their lenses, destroying both.

As Yung and the cameramen rush forward -

ANGLE ON THE HNN BOAT -

Harmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a box

of equipment. He calls back to TWO MEN who have appeared on deck:

They begin using a hoist to lift one of the "worms" from a hold.

(This one looks like an open-mouthed torpedo, with an antenna on top,

and no flexible tubing attached.)

INT. HALLWAY/RECEPTION - POWER PLANT -

Yung and the cameramen turn a corner to the reception/security area:

The guard stands, and smiles, posing for the video camera... And Yung

pulls a pistol from his pocket and shoots him.

They follow Yung up a set of stairs leading to the reactor control

room. Meanwhile, back at the HNN boat:

INT. CABIN - HNN BOAT

Bond is at the porthole, wearing only shorts, trying to figure a way

out. He hears the door click open, and -

A Guard enters carrying a pile of Bond's clothing with his shoes on

top. Stamper is behind him, holding a gun on Sidney.

The guard cuffs Bond's hands (in the front,) and we cut back to:

INT. POWER PLANT CONTROL ROOM -

Yung and the Cameramen sweep into the control room: Lots of con-

soles, with a window overlooking the REACTOR CORE, and its

surrounding blue COOLING POOL.

The engineers ad-lib replies: "Sure." "Okay." Yung smiles:

The engineers line up against a wall. The cameramen take positions

for a massacre. And at the first sound of gunfire, we cut to:

EXT. ENTRANCEWAY -

Stamper is marching Bond and Sidney through the door in handcuffs.

Bond gives her a look.

RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -

Harmsway and Yung are locking down at the VIDEO SCREEN of a portable

version of the "worm" controller we saw on the SEA DOLPHIN II.

Harmsway looks up, hearing:

Harmsway smiles at Bond and Sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at

gun point,) with Stamper and a guard. Harmsway is charming as ever:

Coming closer, Sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him -

Stamper restrains her, while Bond scans the room for an advantage.

He sees a MACHINE PISTOL on the console.

UNDERWATER - POWER PLANT INTAKE TUNNEL -

The "worm" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the

grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars.

RETURN ON CONTROL ROOM -

Young calls out again, with a hint of urgency. Bond decides to try

rattling Harmsway - so he can move Closer to the gun, unnoticed.

This infuriates Harmsway. Bond moves closer to the gun.

He thrusts an issue of TOMORROW at Bond, holding the top half out as

Bond reads THE HEADLINES, sourly:

Harmsway smiles at Bond:

Stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave -

He turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline:

Stamper moves towards Bond and Sidney. Bond edges closer to the gun.

Bond tenses, ready to spring -

Bond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun!!! Bond frowns.

Fortunately, Bond has a back-up plan. As Stamper hustles them off -

Harmsway considers this for a second. Sidney takes Bond's arm.

Bond looks at her. He's surprised: In the blink of an eye, he

realizes he's developed feelings for her. He knows that if he could

hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "You're a hell of a girl"...

But at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows he's

running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone.

As Stamper pushes Bond into the reactor room airlock, he hears:

INT. AIRLOCK -

The door closes. Bond looks out the small window at:

HARMSWAY AND YUNG IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

As they exit -

INT. AIRLOCK -

Bond has yanked his shoes off. He pulls out the PLASTIQUE EXPLOSIVE

SHOELACES and opens the SECRET COMPARTMENT IN HIS HEEL, revealing a

DETONATOR, and EAR PLUGS.

Moving quickly, Bond BITES OFF a 2-inch piece of shoelace, and wraps

it around the chain-link connecting his handcuffs, while...

INT. CONTROL ROOM -

Yung sits down at the worm control and explains to the guard:

He starts to maneuver the joystick, and -

UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL -

The worm turns a corner. We see -

THE WORM'S POV - (INT. INTAKE TUNNEL MOVING) -

100 feet ahead: An iron gate. Beyond it, the blue lights from the

reactor cooling pool... And beyond that... THE REACTOR CORE, a

shimmering silver target.

Meanwhile, back outside, at -

THE DOCK -

Water sprays violently as the HNN boat thunders out of Aberdeen

harbor with Harmsway at the helm. Junks and sampans are tossed in

his wake, as

INT. AIRLOCK -

Bond finishes pressing the SHOELACES AROUND THE DOOR LOCK... Then

TURNS UP HIS SHIRT COLLAR TO PULL OUT A WIRE that's been hidden

inside.

He connects it between the explosive on the handcuff chain and the

detonator, then steals a glance out the window at:

YUNG -

still guiding the worm with the joy stick. His eyes are focused on:

THE CONTROL PANEL (INCLUDING VIDEO SCREEN, SHOWING WORM'S POV) -

Where Yung sees the gate looming ahead on the video screen. He

presses a nearby button marked "START GRINDERS"... And the video

goes black, replaced by the words "GRINDERS ENGAGED."

UNDERWATER -(INTAKE TUNNEL) -

The worm bares its lethal teeth; and revs up to speed. Meanwhile -

BOND -

Closes his eyes, presses the detonator, and -

YUNG -

HEARS a small BOOM from inside the airlock.

The guard picks up his machine pistol, starts to the door.

INSIDE THE AIRLOCK -

Bond (with his hands now free) is quickly rewiring the detonator to

the plastique explosive around the door handle.

YUNG MANEUVERS THE JOY-STICK, AS -

UNDERWATER (INTAKE TUNNEL)

The worm's teeth are beginning to cut into the steel bars.

THE GUARD APPROACHES THE DOOR.

BOND BRACES HIMSELF INSIDE THE AIRLOCK.

THE GUARD PEERS INTO THE WINDOW -

And suddenly... BOOM! The door blows open with a shattering blast!

NEW ANGLE - THE CONTROL ROOM -

The guard is blasted backward, dead. Bond rolls out, scrambling for

the weapon. Yung slams his hand on a button marked "AUTO-PILOT." A

caption appears on the video screen "TARGET LOCKED," and -

As Bond grabs the gun, bringing it up to shoot, Yung dives on top of

him. They struggle, and the gun skitters across the floor towards

the window overlooking the blue cooling pool.

Breaking free, Bond moves around a console for the gun. Yung takes a

shortcut - leaping on, and then over the console, as -

THE WORM (UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL) -

Chews through the last of the iron bars, and glides through the hole

toward THE SILVERY REACTOR CORE, 35 feet ahead.

BOND AND YUNG -

have squared off in a short, brutal MARTIAL ARTS battle.

(The fight takes place in the space between the consoles and the

reactor core window; the gun, lies on the ground between them.)

They trade punch after punch - and although Bond is holding his own,

Yung is every bit his equal.

Backing off, Bond spins into a crescent kick -

But Yung catches Bond's foot, and shoves Bond backwards, crashing

against a wall near a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

Meanwhile, all through this...

THE WORM IS GETTING CLOSER TO THE CORE.

RETURN ON BOND AND YUNG -

As Yung reaches down for the gun, Bond grabs the fire extinguisher

from the wall. He rushes Yung, blasting him with CO2.

In the white smoke, Yung drops the gun... Then CHARGES at Bond,

headbutting him, twisting, and turning 007... SMASHING BOND

BACKWARDS AGAINST THE GLASS WINDOW.

THE WINDOW SHATTERS. Bond is winded. And as he struggles to stop

himself from falling backwards into the reactor room...

Yung does a FLYING, FEET FIRST KICK to finish the job -

But at the last second, BOND DUCKS, reaches up, and uses Yung's

momentum to send him flying over Bond's head into -

THE REACTOR ROOM.

He sails through the air, heading for the cooling pool 20' below, as -

THE WORM CLOSES IN ON THE SILVER REACTOR CORE.

SCREAMING, YUNG HITS THE WATER FEET FIRST, AND -

UNDERWATER (REACTOR CORE) -

THE WORM BURROWS IN ON HIM.

RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -

Bond races to hit the "EMERGENCY REACTOR SHUT DOWN" button. He pulls

a FIRE ALARM, disconnects the worm, and sets off an "EMERGENCY

DECONTAMINATION" system, spraying the room with a mist of water.

Finally, Bond retrieves the gun, and pauses to look down at:

THE REACTOR POOL (BOND'S POV) -

There's a cloud of RED in the middle of the blue water.

RETURN TO SCENE -

Bond goes to the dead guard. Gets the key, removes his handcuff

bracelets, then hoists the dead guard over his shoulder, and exits.

EXT. HELICOPTER - (EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR POWER PLANT) - DAY

With the sound of fire engines approaching in the background, Bond

straps the dead guard into the passenger seat, and takes off.

EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II - (AERIAL - SOUTH CHINA SEA) - DAY

The HNN boat has pulled alongside the Sea Dolphin II. The gang from

the nuke plant is boarding the larger boat.

(Note: From the air, we should notice that the "gold hold" is now

covered by a steel hatch, and the biggest worm is stored in the open,

hanging from a steel boom.)

THE DECK -

Coming up the ladder first, Harmsway is greeted by the Captain.

Stamper and Sidney have climbed onto the deck.

The cameraman takes her away. Harmsway turns to the captain:

INT. LOWER PASSAGEWAY/STORAGE ROOM - SEA DOLPHIN II -

Near the engine room (indicating we're near the bottom of the boat,)

the cameraman opens a door to a small, cramped room with a bench, and

SCUBA EQUIPMENT. He pushes Sidney inside.

Then locks the door on her.

EXT. BOND'S HNN HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY

Several hundred feet in the air, the helicopter is heading for an

island in the distance.

INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING -

Bond checks the compass, and adjusts his course. The COMPASS SWINGS

DUE SOUTH.

BOND'S POV -

The helicopter clears the island: Bright blue sea ahead. Bond sees

then passes over - the HNN boat, bobbing empty in the water...

Then, further ahead, he spots the stern of Sea Dolphin II, shimmering

in the instance.

REAR DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II -

Looking north, off the back of the boat Stamper and a crewman see the

helicopter - a tiny speck in the air.

Stamper lifts a pair of BINOCULARS for confirmation.

STAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -

He sees two figures in the cockpit.

RETURN TO SCENE -

Stamper picks up his radio:

THE BRIDGE -

The Captain replies:

HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

Harmsway is working at a computer. A chime sounds.

INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY -

Bond is about two miles out from the stern of the Sea Dolphin II.

Maybe 500' in the air.

Taking the machine pistol from the dead guard's lap, he opens the

small pilot's window, and balances it on his knees. Ahead, he sees:

BOND'S POV - DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II -

The crewmen are lining up on either side of the landing pad, near the

ship's railings.

RETURN ON BOND -

Ready for war. He pushes the cyclic pitch lever forward, and the

Bell Jetranger goes into a screaming descent.

THE DECK/HELICOPTER LANDING PAD

Champagne bottles pop. Stamper is with a crewman, who looks up at

the chopper, about 1000' off the stern:

Stamper picks up his binoculars.

STAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -

He sees Bond.

RETURN TO SCENE -

He might have also added "It's too late," as -

NEW ANGLE - REAR DECK OF THE BOAT/HELICOPTER -

Bond SWOOPS IN LOW on the port side of the boat, FIRING HIS GUN from

the pilot's window, and using the CHOPPER'S BLADES to threaten the

men on deck.

About half of them DIVE INTO THE WATER FOR SAFETY, only to be quickly

left behind.

Flying up the port side toward the front of the boat, Bond passes -

INT. HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

The windows rattle as Bond's chopper thunders by. Perplexed,

Harmsway stands, opens the porthole curtains. He cranes his neck,

but sees nothing. He presses an intercom button:

INT. BRIDGE -

The helicopter suddenly appears in front of him. Shooting from the

pilot's window, Bond shatters the glass windows -

And the Captain slumps forward on the wheel, spinning it as he slides

to the deck.

INT. HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

The boat pitches wildly; Harmsway looses his balance, crashing into a

wall.

INT. STORAGE CABIN -

Sidney is thrown from her bench, slamming against scuba tanks.

EXT. MID-SHIP - DECK -

Stamper bounces himself, handing out AUTOMATIC WEAPONS from an arms

cache hidden inside a DINGHY.

The two cameramen take their M-16's and rush forward, jumping up on

some machinery to climb onto -

THE ROOF OF THE BRIDGE -

They rush forward, and assume positions shooting at Bond.

ANGLE ON THE HELICOPTER -

Taking hits. Bond pivots and turns the chopper, heading straight for

them.

BOND'S POV - (INT. HELICOPTER) -

The men turn, and start to run as the chopper chases them -

CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER'S LANDING SKIDS -

BOND HOOKS BOTH OF THEM WITH THE SKIDS, BY THE BACK OF THEIR UNTUCKED

SHIRTS!!!!   The man are flailing like crazy as -

BOND PULLS BACK ON THE CYCLIC PITCH LEVER -

THE HELICOPTER REARS BACKWARDS, AND UP -

And the men burst through their shirt buttons, FALLING, SHIRTLESS,

into the sea.

INT. HELICOPTER -

Bond pushes the cyclic sideways to bank down, and in, on the boat.

But he doesn't see -

WIDE - (BOAT/HELICOPTER)

A SMALL ROCKET STREAKING UPWARD from the boat. Stamper is holding a

shoulder mounted launcher.

THE HELICOPTER -

BOOM! It hits the engine.

INT. HELICOPTER -

The gauges go crazy; the alarms go berserk. The entire cockpit is

chattering as Bond struggles to remain in control.

EXT. LADDER LEADING TO THE BRIDGE -

HARMSWAY is trying to make his way up the ladder as the boat

continues to veer out of control. He pauses to look up at:

THE HELICOPTER, GYRATING WILDLY -

INT. HELICOPTER -

Bond forces the cyclic forward. The helicopter pitches forward -

BOND'S POV - (INT. HELICOPTER)

He's heading straight for the hatch covering the gold hold. Whoever

is left alive is diving off the ship to get out of the way.

INT. BRIDGE -

Struggling with the wheel, Harmsway picks up the radio:

ANGLE ON STAMPER (EXT. MID-SHIP) -

With the worm dangling from a boom in the background, he watches:

EXT. HELICOPTER/SHIP

With the chopper about 15 feet above the gold hold - just barely

under control - Bond opens the door.

He leaps out onto the hatch, and rolls off, disappearing as -

THE CHOPPER CRASHES onto the gold hold, in a GIANT BALL OF FLAME and

twisted metal.

INT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT -

Sidney looks up, hearing and feeling the explosion.

INT. BRIDGE -

Harmsway regains control of the boat; he TAKES A GUN from the dead

captain, and pushes the body out.

EXT. PASSAGEWAY -

With FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him, Bond is stealthily

moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship.

(Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any

threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive.)

Arriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR, Bond checks both directions down the

passageway, then pokes his head inside -

And is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS, OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY, thrown

against a railing.

Bond looks up:

STAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his

head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached

to the boom by a thin metal cable.

Bond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him. The man doesn't flinch.

With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him

against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck.

As Bond recovers, Stamper (still smiling) presses a RED BUTTON on a

wall, and THE WORM comes to life.

Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm.

Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond

against the wall with his free hand as he -

MANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD.

With the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose -

Bond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles. Stamper tumbles

sideways. Bond rolls away from the worm -

But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is

rushing at Bond full force, with the worm.

Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews

into the wall.

Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - (same

action,) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond.

INSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE -

With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in

the cable, on the ground.

RETURN TO SCENE -

Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in

the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain -

And the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE

SIDE OF THE SHIP.

UNDERWATER -

The grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull.

SIDNEY - (INT. STORAGE ROOM) -

Hears a strange vibrating sound from the wall.

HARMSWAY - (INT. BRIDGE) -

EXT. DECK/PASSAGEWAY -

As Stamper straightens up, winded from the groin kick -

BOND rushes to A SMALL PILE OF SLACK CABLE, which is rapidly growing

taught as the worm wends its way underwater.

Stamper rushes Bond -

And in one lightening fast move, Bond wraps the cable twice around

Stamper's neck.

Suddenly THE CABLE TIGHTENS, and -

STAMPER soars 15 in the air, HANGING BY HIS NECK, as -

INT. STORAGE CABIN -

THE WORM BURSTS THROUGH THE WALL! A torrent of water floods in,

pushing Sidney off to one side.

WORM'S POV - INT. STORAGE CABIN -

It's zooming at the door!

INT. PASSAGEWAY -

The door bursts open, sending tons of water into the passageway.

INT. BRIDGE -

The boat shudders violently, sending Harmsway crashing against a

wall, cutting his head.

EXT. THE DECK -

As the boat rocks, Bond steadies himself, then starts for the bridge,

using the same route as the cameramen lifted by the chopper:

First climbing up on some machinery, then up onto the bridge roof.

INT. STORAGE ROOM -

Sidney is thrashing for air, with only a few inches left between the

rising water and the ceiling.

INT. PASSAGEWAY -

3/4 filled with water. Rising fast.

THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY)

The worm is heading for a door. We see the door disintegrate in

front of us, as the worm bursts into -

THE ENGINE ROOM.

With the water cascading over the camera, (as if we were riding

inside an ocean wave,) the worm heads for a tank marked "FUEL."

EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

The boat is sinking. Bond is running across the bridge roof, when:

THE BOAT SUDDENLY LISTS TO THE STARBOARD SIDE.

INT. BRIDGE -

Harmsway is thrown backwards. Gun in hand, he makes his way up the

incline, to the port-side door.

Just when he thinks he's made it -

Bang. Bond appears in the doorway, having jumped down from the roof

on the small exterior walkway. He's seething with rage.

Harmsway looks up at him. Blinks in disbelief.

Harmsway slowly brings up the gun.

Bond smacks the gun out of his hand with contempt. Moves closer.

BOOM! The fuel tanks explode in the distance. The bridge rocks

violently; the room tilts to a greater angle.

With both arms, Bond pushes Harmsway backwards, flinging him downward

against the starboard wall. The water is rising on the bridge.

He grabs Harmsway by the lapels, and throws him against the front

wall, crashing onto the instrument panel head first.

Harmsway laughs maniacally, face down on the gauges:

Boom! There's another explosion in the background! The front of the

boat tilts upward! The water is rushing in!

Bond grabs Harmsway by the shoulder -

And yanks him off the instrument panel, flinging him backwards

against the rear wall of the bridge.

Suddenly, THE BOAT GROANS. The BRIDGE RISES OUT OF THE WATER! AND

BOND loses his balance, FALLING ONTO HARMSWAY -

Harmsway lunges for Bond's throat -

AND THE BRIDGE SLIPS UNDERWATER -

Where Bond breaks Harmsway's grasp in a violent struggle - then

punches him. Air bubbles break from Harmsway's mouth. He

frantically tries to break free for the surface -

But Bond pulls him back down, and holds him down, pushing down on

Harmsway's shoulders.

Harmsway is thrashing about, flailing in all directions, pounding at

Bond in a haze of bubbles...

Then falls still.

With his lungs aching, bursting with fire, Bond rockets up -

UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -

through the bridge windows, up to -

THE SURFACE.

He breaks through the water, gasping for air... And then, almost

instantly, dives down again.

UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -

Bond dives for the boat - down, and down, chasing it, as if he could

just grab it, and stop it from sinking.

He goes deeper, and deeper, as it sinks further and further away,

just beyond his reach.

And just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold his

breath a second longer -

A FIGURE IN SCUBA GEAR (mask and tank) GRABS HIM.

Bond turns in disbelief. Stares into the mask: IT'S SIDNEY. She

puts her regulator in Bond's mouth...

And they share the air as they rise from the depths.

THE SURFACE -

They break through the water. Sidney yanks off her mask. Teases:

She splashes him. Turning away, Bond spots Stamper's 'arms cache'

dinghy floating nearby.

NEW ANGLE - THE DINGHY -

Bond climbs into it, then helps Sidney get in. They collapse in the

bottom of the boat, resting their heads against the gunwale.

After a beat, SIDNEY CLEARS HER THROAT. Bond is already amused:

He laughs. She falls into his arms. They kiss, and we cut to:

TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS -

With the dinghy reflected in the glass. In unison, they are both

lowered, revealing Q and Wade.

A British naval officer appears.

Q and Wade throw a glance back to the sea, then turn, waking off:

CLOSE ON A PICTURE OF HARMSWAY ON A VIDEO SCREEN -

On the wall behind M's DESK. It's night. Moneypenny sits across

from M, with a steno pad.

RETURN ON THE DINGHY -

Bond and Sidney break off a kiss. She lies nestled in his arms.

Bond replies with a wry smile:

And with this, he reaches up over his head, and pulls a tarp over the

two of them...

And the camera pulls back, and up, rising into the air to reveal:

The entire British Navy closing in on them from all points of the

compass.
