laughter from the group.

Against his will, Joe puts on the hat. More laughter from the group.

Three exuberant TOMBOYS play football on the front lawn of a modest

split-level home: TERRY, 13, rebel in a hurry; KERRY, 10, the good

girl; and SHERRY, 8, the baby.

Terry hikes the ball, drops back to throw...

A PASS

spirals up into the air...where it's INTERCEPTED by Joe, who appears

out of nowhere.

Hi s   hands       go back to groping.            She smacks them. ...

She looks at him.    Smile s.        She loves him for who he is,   as

frustrating as that can be.         She embraces, ki sses him.

They kiss again.       And ki ss.   Joe kicks the door to the laundry room

SHUT behind him.

LAUGHTER all around. Lefty steals another look at Donnie as he sits

placidly drinking his coffee.

DESIGNER DRESSES, on hangers. Two cartons of TUNA FISH. Two large

STEREO SPEAKERS. Rummages some more. Finds

in his pocket, produces

A FIVE-CARAT DIAMOND RING

He returns the diamond to Lefty.

The Bartender, SCARED--he knows what Lefty's capable of. Quickly

mixes a SPRITZER.

FUMES. The Bartender slides the spritzer over.
