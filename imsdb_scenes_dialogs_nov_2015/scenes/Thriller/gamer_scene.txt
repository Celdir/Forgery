VROOOOOOSH!!! CHUKUNK, CHUKUNK!! A SNOWPLOW BARRELS THROUGH

THE DESTRUCTION, pushing the bodies and debris out of the way

and clearing a path, one streaked with crimson red and burnt

flesh. It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds.

Down the road, KABLE saves an EAST-INDIAN WOMAN from getting

obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing

truck. As KABLE turns to waste another BLUE, the EAST-INDIAN

WOMAN gets right back up... walking into and getting

obliterated by another TRUCK.   It's creepy - robotic, but

violent and too real - like a programmed suicide.

We sense emotion in KABLE'S cold eyes - then they flicker to

the peripheral.

Tracking along a row of blown out windows a BLUE is taking

aim; we SNAP ZOOM in...

SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE IMAGE:

The transparent GHOST OF A FACE, as though projected on

glass. The LIPS MOVE in sync with:

KABLE spins, TOO LATE -

BUT: from the level directly below the SNIPER - through an

open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT UP

THROUGH THE CEILING! The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS.

The BROWN runs out and hits the curb; CONCRETE AND MEAT

collapse on the spot where she stood... it's SANDRA.

KABLE gives her covering fire as she heads his way. They

bolt for a corner - KABLE reaches protection first. He stops

to let SANDRA catch up, and in that instant -

HER BRAINS GET BLOWN TO JELL-O.          Blood and particles splatter

over KABLE's gear.

Without hesitation KABLE turns and wastes two more BLUES.

Up ahead HE SEES IT: an OCTAGON STEEL SHED with small

GLOWING EMERALD GREEN WINDOWS. He makes for it.

The little FLY following him is picked out of the air by a

stray shot - PLINK!

Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but he's

QUICK...

A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD, almost knocking him off his

feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBLE

BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH.

He scrambles to the octagon's entrance and BAILS IN.

KABLE steps into the middle of the vacant steel room. The

second he breaks the GREEN LASER, FLOOD LIGHTS blast on all

around the BATTLEFIELD. A SUBMARINE ALARM sounds from

loudspeakers everywhere, echoing through the streets, CYCLING

DOWN.

The battle is over - session complete.

KABLE steps out.    The LEDS on his weapon blink off in

sequence...

ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE, rounding up the I-Con's.

[I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row

inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage.

GENERI-CON's (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic that

lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield... they

are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters)... petty

thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by

participating to commute their sentences]

A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE. His

eyes are pure MURDER; SANDRA'S brain matter still drips from

him.

HE WHIPS UP THE WEAPON, POINTS IT AT A GUARD'S HEAD AND PULLS

THE TRIGGER -

NOTHING. The GUARD doesn't even flinch. The WEAPON is DEAD,

dormant; they all knew it.

The GUARDS have a good LAUGH... KABLE is CLUBBED from behind -

we...

Back on the rattling TRAIN, where we started. The SURVIVING

SOLDIERS - both BROWN and BLUE - are shackled to the rail -

wounded, exhausted, hollow eyed.

KABLE only looks to the floor.

The cynical BROWN just shakes his head.

KABLE says nothing.

The CAMERA pushes in on a TATTOO on his forearm: a simple

outline of a black box with the words inside: I AM RIGHT HERE

WITH YOU.

[MUSIC: Aldo Nova, "LIFE IS JUST A FANTASY" kicks in...]

A spartan, underground LAB.

A PLAIN-CLOTHES TECH sits on a stool holding a simple REMOTE;

on the table next to him is a SMALL METAL DISH. In front of

him, floating in the air, is one of the little metallic

FLIES.

He pokes at it - it instantly jukes left; again - it jukes

right... almost faster than the eye can follow. No way he

could ever touch it.

Semi-satisfied, he holds out the metal dish and clicks the

remote. The FLY drops into the dish - CLINK.

CLOSE-UP: the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one

side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air.

There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end.

The TECH picks it up with thumb and forefinger and holds the

lens up to his eyes. Switch to:

POV of the FLY CAM: the TECH'S face, extreme wide angle,

examining. The image flickers, glitches - then CUTS TO:

WHITE NOISE.

A CONSOLE of MONITORS cut from FUZZ to GRAPHICS.         TECH GUYS

and PRODUCERS scramble... it's SHOWTIME.

SWISH PAN and SNAP ZOOM across the room, through an open

door, to the CORRIDOR, where...

[END: "LIFE IS JUST A FANTASY"]

A REPORTER - GINA PARKER SMITH, sexy eager-beaver, focused -

a NEWS EXEC, 40s, and a CHIEF OF STAFF, 60s are walking

briskly along in a heated discussion.

GINA spins on him, looks CHIEF straight in the eyeballs.

The CHIEF OF STAFF bangs open a conference room door with his

fist as they blow by - veers off and disappears. GINA rolls

her eyes in disgust, keeps moving.

FREEZE FRAME on GINA - ZOOM and...

TV GRAPHIC:

GINA'S BURGER-FREAKING face becomes part of an ANIMATED TITLE

SEQUENCE.

In this context it looks like she's freaking serious world

affairs.

NOTE: this telecast will play much faster than the page count

indicates - hyped up, quick cutting, overlapping dialog,

A.D.D. and hyper-caffeinated.

Shots of several dozen young, trendily dressed people (we're

talking trends that haven't yet been invented) wandering

robotically around a BACKLOT-LOOKING CITY STREET,

occasionally bumping into one another... the graphic society

LOGO superimposed.

People are dancing, MAKING OUT on street corners... someone

tries to eat an ICE CREAM CONE, misses his mouth and pokes it

into his eye.

A HOT YOUNG GIRL in a WET T-SHIRT is SLAMMING a BOTTLE of

JAGER.

A MIDDLE-AGED GUY in a shirt and tie is HEADBANGING FURIOUSLY

like an extra in a TWISTED SISTER VIDEO.

SWITCH TO: ROWS OF PEOPLE in front of wall-sized VIDEO

MONITORS, transfixed, doing a kind of sign language with

their hands... JAPANESE lining up around the block...

COLLEGE STUDENTS and OFFICE WORKERS glued to screens...

A FILE-FOOTAGE CLIP of KEN CASTLE - 30s, fresh and boyish,

Southern molasses accent - being interviewed on a news show:

FREEZE on CASTLE... the IMAGE DISTORTS in THREE DIMENSIONS,

offset red and blue channels shifting.

SLAYERS LOGO over a slo-mo shot of BROWN and BLUE soldiers

walking towards CAMERA - BADASS, with BIG MOTHERFUCKING

WEAPONS slung at their sides...

Slick edited COMBAT FOOTAGE from the BATTLEFIELD.

Explosions, flame throwers, bullet hits... DUDES screaming,

unloading MASS ROUNDS...

A QUICK CUT of a BROWN'S ARM BEING BLOWN OFF.

An RPG EXPLODES - CHUNKS smack the lens and OOZE DOWN.

CASTLE is opposite GINA PARKER SMITH, both identified by

translucent animated CHYRONS. CASTLE is older now than in

the earlier clip; early 40s - his body is more solid; hair

cut shorter, conservative. But the eyes still SPARKLE.

CASTLE'S accent is like pure Georgia honey.           He's a rock-

ribbed charmer.

She leans in, playing the role of hard-hitting reporter to a

T.

KEN just smiles, locks in on her eyes.

VIDEO: a montage of slayers "civilians" - the bum shaking a

can in the midst of chaos, a group of pedestrians walking

robotically into a wall of flame, store clerks "air-bagging"

groceries...

VIDEO: the East Indian Female generi-con from the first

battle gets smeared by a truck.

BULLET-CAM IMAGES of a SLAYERS SOLDIER leaping into action

and freezing in MID-AIR, a GRAPHIC SUPERIMPOSED:

THROW TO the LIVE STUDIO BROADCAST -

A 3-D ANIMATED GRAPHIC accompanies his explanation - the

VIRTUAL CAMERA zooms in to the FROZEN SOLDIER'S head - and

then INSIDE, passing thru transparent layers.

We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with a

bold, block letter N. The nano-cell approaches a normal cell

next to it... there is a flash; now the cell next to it has

turned into an exact copy of the nano. This continues,

multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal that

the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells.

The graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands

working a retro ATARI-style joystick... animated waves

indicate a wireless transmission from the joystick to the

Slayer, who unfreezes and flies into action.

CASTLE smiles broadly.

CASTLE waves in his PERSONAL SECURITY:

A half dozen GEEKS in BLACK JEANS, BLACK T-SHIRTS w/ WHITE

SOCKS and SNEAKERS; BACKPACKS... yes, even FANNY PACKS. A

full range of GEEK VARIATIONS: beard/mustache combos, thick

glasses, pony tails, etc.

One GEEK brings out the CUTEST, SOFTEST little SPANIEL PUPPY

in the world and places it in CASTLE'S LAP.

Meanwhile several OTHERS are directing HANDHELD SENSORS at

GINA and thumb-clicking to establish TRACKING POINTS - her

slightest movements are scanned and interpreted as data in

real time.

Somehow, in his sweet southern drawl this rolls off almost

acceptable. The CREW has a laugh off-screen; GINA blushes.

ON the MONITORS:

CASTLE is showing GINA how to make the dog roll over, sit up,

etc. GINA has her hands up, limp in front of her chin, like

a submissive puppy begging, and she is PANTING; she's clearly

getting into it... her every movement is MIRRORED by the

adorable dog.

More COMBAT FOOTAGE, this time focusing on KABLE HIGHLIGHTS.

BACK TO THE STUDIO.

A SUPERNOVA FLARE throws to MUSIC and GRAPHICS:

Back to handheld, non-broadcast REALITY.

KEN has GINA's hand in his hand, beaming. Her demeanor has

changed; she's like a LITTLE GIRL with her DAD at the fair.

The WORLDLINK GRAPHIC GLITCHES OUT, replaced by a BLUE SCREEN

- like an old school COMPUTER CRASH. THEN -

One letter at a time, in retro Apple chicago font,

accompanied by the exaggerated sound of COMPUTER KEYSTROKE

CLICKS:

Then a VOICE - deep, but speaking ARTIFICIALLY QUICKLY - like

in radio commercials, where they use time-compression

software to remove the silences between the words.

Everyone in the STUDIO is speechless, watching the monitors -

including CASTLE; actually, he LOVES it... he's laughing his

ass off.

ON THE SCREEN, the humanz logo dissolves, 8-bit ARCADE STYLE,

replaced by:

Underneath is the CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION showing the

progression from primitive EARLY MAN to the erect MODERN

HUMAN. In a crude ANIMATION the progression CONTINUES:

MODERN MAN bends back over on his hands and knees; in the

final stage he's wearing a DOG COLLAR, getting fucked in the

ass - then fed through a MEAT GRINDER, packaged & sold as

HAMBURGER.

KEN looks over at the PRODUCER.

The screen CUTS TO BLACK, COLOR-BARS blink, then an

advertisement streams in.

KEN stands, holding GINA'S hand, kisses it.

He gives her a ROGUISH WINK.

On the monitors, we transition back into a paid commercial: a

VICTORIA'S SECRET PORN-looking GIRL in HANDCUFFS turns to

CAMERA.

A PRISONER - shirtless, his upper body smeared with WHITE

POWDER, screaming, SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN INTO FACE. Blood

sprays on white.

We see that he is beating down a uniformed GUARD. The GUARD

wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. Other

prisoners, shackled together, stand by watching, forming a

half circle around the fight. They are shirtless, covered in

the same white powder - they look like tribesmen.

One of the prisoners, very distinctive, nods grimly, clearly        *

enjoying the show.

The prison yard is a vast expanse of white - it could be a

chalk mine, or the surface of a strange planet. Distant

towers mark the perimeter.

Other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the

distance, trotting along in lines. Trails of thick magenta

smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind.

The ROGUE PRISONER stomps down on the GUARD'S face one last

time - his shoes are made of cloth. CRUNCH. The GUARD stops

moving.

The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain.

A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners.

They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind

to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive.

In a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses

between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by

an invisible field. Sound? Light? Magnetism? His body

goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes.

Fingers run through white powder, making patterns.

A black shadow crosses the frame, accompanied by a low hum;

some sort of aircraft.

KABLE looks up as the shadow tracks across him; we never see

the craft. He looks out across the yard.

KABLE is sitting in what seems to be a minimal REC AREA cut

out of the white terrain. He sits by himself wearing a white

cloth hoodie, eyes dark, head down, silent. Across the yard

a group of prisoners are playing basketball; EVERY SINGLE

PLAYER is SKYING for dunks.

We focus in on KABLE'S TATTOO: I Am Right Here With You...

In the yard a CRIPPLE, his two legs stiff with braces, walks

ROBOTICALLY along on crutches. KABLE watches him,

expressionless. It triggers a memory...

A LITTLE GIRL, no more than two, walks along on her DADDY'S

feet... giggling, trusting... her hands grip his big

fingers... taking each big ROBOT STEP with him...

A BASKETBALL comes out of nowhere and KNOCKS THE CRUTCH OUT

from under the CRIPPLE, sending him ass-up on the asphalt.

Prisoners JEER.

We see that KABLE has drawn the pattern in his tattoo with

his finger in the white powder; at the sound of the voice he

runs his hand through it, wiping it away.

A wiry, jittery dude of indeterminate age is sitting next to

KABLE. KABLE doesn't even turn to look.

KABLE turns slowly to look him in the eye, says nothing.

KABLE looks away.

KABLE waits a good long beat.

A prisoner sings Metallica off key, but balls to the walls:

KABLE is alone in his cell.

At the base of the single door is a SLIDING COMPARTMENT to

push food through - it opens. But instead of a tray, someone

pushes through a wrinkled photograph.

KABLE picks it up and looks - a WOMAN, just a blur of golden

hair, laughing, and a LITTLE GIRL... the same one in KABLE'S

vision.

KABLE is stunned, silent. He sits on the ground, shoulder

leaning against the heavy door, staring at the girl in the

picture.

Her words are like hammer blows to his guts; he wants to weep

but he's too strong, too internalized. He steels himself.

She pushes through a white NOTECARD and PEN.

KABLE doesn't take it.

This takes KABLE by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pen

and card. He writes something on it and sticks it back

through the slider.

PFFHHT. The WOMAN stabs KABLE'S hand with a LANCET - she

draws out a little blood.

KABLE yanks his hand back out.

At the far end of the solitary block a BUZZER sounds - then

the SLIDE and SLAM of heavy steel.

KABLE jumps up and pulls himself against the door - a

lifeline is slipping away...

He peers through the little window at the top of the door,

but she's GONE...

Instead, a group of PRISONERS are being led down the corridor

to their NEW CELLS. We recognize grim, battered faces from

the yard - these are the men that stood by as the GUARD was

being beaten down.

DISTINCTIVE PRISONER - hands cuffed behind his back, makes                *

eye contact with KABLE as he walks by.                                    *

A desolate white RUNNING TRACK; a guard TOWER overlooks...

the field is empty but for ONE MAN: KABLE.

He's busting ass around the track, pouring sweat. We're

right there with him, CLOSE-UP - profile, full speed... we

hear the HARD BREATHING, the feet pounding dirt, like we're

INSIDE HIS HEAD.

WIDE LOCK OFF - KABLE, 90 feet high, a MURAL painted on the

side of a BUILDING. It's an AD for SLAYERS: KABLE in FULL

COMBAT MODE, cutting loose with a FLAME THROWER.

KABLE, running - we're even CLOSER NOW... he's pushing

himself beyond exhaustion, pure focus...

Different city, same story - KABLE, a towering BILLBOARD

PROJECTION... endless lanes of FREEWAY GRIDLOCK sprawling

beneath...

KABLE, staggering, near collapse, lungs burning...

The ICONIC IMAGE of KABLE on the famous TIMES SQUARE VIDEO

WALL, now even more massive... the STOCK TICKERS reeling off

disaster... he's like GODZILLA frozen amongst the

SKYSCRAPERS...

KABLE finally flames out... he breaks down to a jog, then

doubles over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath.

CUT OUT WIDE: KABLE is ant-size and insignificant on the

long, barren field, under a vast grey sky... ALONE.

Hold for a long beat, and...

MONTAGE of GAMERS' FACES, preparing to GET IT ON... All

shapes, colors and styles, but all RICH AND POWERFUL-looking.

Some are sweating, some calm, some beat red, others have

guitar-playing twitch faces...

SHOCK CUT into the HEAT OF BATTLE.

CHAOS, CONFUSION... KABLE blasts through a cloud of exploding

debris... A BROWN to his left is BLOWN IN HALF - the LEGS

KEEP RUNNING...

TED NUGENT, in BROWN camo, lines up a BLUE SNIPER in a 3rd

story window with a CROSS-BOW. He releases the arrow and

pins the BLUE's HEAD to the window sill.

An UPSIDE-DOWN CAR comes SLIDING down the street on it's hood

and slams into TED NUGENT, VAPORIZING him...

Another five BLUE SOLDIERS are taken out. Their bodies drop

to the ground, gruesome goodness. The FIVE BALL BEARING

CAMERAS quickly flock together and check out each body as a

swarming unit. From a wider shot, they look like flies on

shit... after checking out the recently deleted, they zip off

towards the closest save point...

SCENE 44 DELETED                                                             *

FIFTY beer slamming COLLEGE STUDENTS are going BERSERK...

they've got SLAYERS on a wall-sized screen, pay-per-view...

they're high fiving, SMASHING up the place...                                *

KABLE LEAPS for a drainage trench, makes it, and hustles

around the back of a burnt out building...

Up a stairway - the GHOST FACE on GLASS superimposed on the

image - the face is LAUGHING, GIDDY...

KABLE takes up a spot from a second level vantage point -

from here we see a small group of BLUES moving down the

block, scanning for survivors.

KABLE watches himself SWITCH TURRETS on his WEAPON.   He

brings up a SNIPER SIGHT and locks in on a target.

CLOSE-UP of KABLE'S EAR: just then he hears the SUBTLEST OF

SOUNDS creeping up behind. Whoever's controlling him doesn't

seem to have noticed - he's too focused on the enemies in the

sights.

We can see the tension in KABLE'S FACE - he's helpless,

trying to fight it, willing his player to take notice.

A trickle of sweat runs down into KABLE'S EYE. The SOUND is

more distinct now, CLOSER... he's practically shaking from

the struggle to overcome the control.

POV: someone has reached the top of the stairs... KABLE, seen

from behind, comes into view crouched by the blown out

window.

FINALLY: SNAP ZOOM on a reflection in a shard of HANGING

WINDOW GLASS - the outline of a BLUE, raising his gun...

KABLE SPINS - FAST. The TURRET is ALREADY REVOLVING when he

squeezes the trigger...

The ARMOR-PIERCING SHELL takes SNEAKY BLUE by surprise,

blowing him out the back of the building...

The BLUES in the street take notice. It's a matter of

seconds...

KABLE makes a run for it as the floor starts to DISINTEGRATE

behind him in a shitstorm of bullets. SHRAPNEL drills his

back, absorbed by the BODY ARMOR.

He hits daylight and turns a corner in time to see a group of                *

BROWNS scattering... a live ARTILLERY SHELL skitters across                  *

the pavement, belching smoke.                                                *

BOOM.

KABLE is running... he looks to his right - A FROZEN MOMENT:

The SAVE POINT up ahead on the SPINNING RAILROAD.                            *

The MOMENT passes; KABLE looks back over his shoulder - a

rush of ROARING FLAME is COMING - FAST... at the moment of

IMPACT we -                                                                  *

SOLDIERS are charred, bleeding, wasted.

A BROWN is sobbing uncontrollably.

KABLE watches him, wondering the same damn thing.

MONTAGE, CLOSE UP:

Two fat slices of WHOLE GRAIN BREAD, check.

Big sloppy spoonfuls of lumpy green ORGANIC PISTACHIO BUTTER,

spread on SLICE A, check.

Welch's PURPLE GRAPE JELLY spread on SLICE B, check.

Combine; CONSUME.

SIMON - 18, pale and lanky, unkempt shaggy hair; wearing a

vintage Guns `n' Roses T-shirt from the Appetite For

Destruction Tour - walks down a long, high ceilinged crystal

hall with marble floors, macking on the sandwich... passes

through a glass tunnel running through the interior of a

massive, exotic aquarium - he's alone in what appears to be a

vast, cold mansion.

SIMON'S ROOM is simple - FOUR WALLS and a CEILING, each one a

3-D, corner-to-corner VIDEO SCREEN. The HD level of the

screens is virtually ABSOLUTE - the flesh and blood SIMON

himself is just another element in a HIGH-DOLLAR/HIGH-TECH

SPACE.

The FLOOR is ALL BED. SIMON PADS IN, takes a spinning STUNT

JUMP and ROLLS onto his back in a big ass pile of pillows,

sandwich intact.

The SCREENS are a jumble of floating frames, competing for

prominence in the 3-D space... muted VID CHATS, STOCK

TICKERS, SPORTS SCORES, ultraviolent SLAYERS playback, etc.

Everything dynamic, everything moving.

One whole wall is apparently a REAL TIME monitor of the

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND, with updated statistics... POINTS

LEADER, FRAG COUNT - we notice that KABLE leads these

categories; a video loop of KABLE in action beside his name

illustrates the point.

In the FOREFRONT of SIMON'S attention:

A set of dynamic frames allow him to scroll through a series

of revolving images - WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT, BODY ARMOR.

SIMON interacts with the 3-D environment using HAND GESTURES -

he can SLIDE, SQUEEZE, PULL AND SCROLL the images just by

moving his fingers in the air.

He flips past various TRANSFORMERS-looking SUPER GUNS...

He stops on an animated graphic. A SEXY FEMALE VOICE breaks

it all down for us:

A VIDEO DEMO shows the fired cartridge SPLIT into two-dozen

smaller shells that FLASH OUT like a swarm of bees, wind

around a corner and utterly SHRED a TEST DUMMY.

An ANNOYING GIRL'S VOICE pops in, along with a VID CHAT

SCREEN that takes over the MAIN WALL. She looks about 16 -

skinny, skanky, kind of hot.

Another GIRL - 17, cute, stoned - chimes in.

SIMON casually waves his hand at the frame, like flicking at

a fly; ANNOYING GIRL is wiped away, bringing CUTE STONED GIRL

to the forefront.

SIMON notices a metallic sparkle from the GIRL'S TONGUE.

He reaches out and "pinches" the screen, ZOOMING IN close as

she sticks out her tongue - it fills the wall... a dozen

wicked looking BLACK TONGUE RINGS stud the wet pink flesh,

TEN FEET HIGH.

He quickly unsqueezes, zooming back out. The GIRL'S eyes are

rolled back in her head, euphoric; she's WASTED.

A THIRD GIRL pops in, filling the opposite wall.

This is SIMON'S SISTER, SHELLY, 14.       Frosted up lips, eyes

and hair like a Tokyo hooker.

With a wave of his hand he wipes her image off the screen.

TWO MORE video chats pop up - TWIN 21-YEAR OLD GIRLS,

stupidly hot.

Suddenly all of SIMON's screens are filled with the TWINS.

They lift their shirts, GIRLS GONE WILD style.      Perfect perky

C's with silver-dollar nipples.

When TWIN 2 speaks, it is with a MAN'S VOICE. The accent is

EASTERN EUROPEAN.

SIMON snaps his fingers; all the windows close

simultaneously.

SIMON makes a clicking sound with his tongue in the new

silence. Peace at last.

BY THEMSELVES, the screens come BACK TO LIFE.

The instant chat boxes are gone, replaced by a soundless,

GRAINY VIDEO LOOP - there is something sinister about the lo-

fi image... it looks like the feed from an old SURVEILLANCE

CAM:

Two men are sitting in a room... it's silent, but one of them

seems to be SCREAMING - he lifts a gun...

... waits a beat... and SHOOTS THE OTHER MAN IN THE HEAD.

Black blood pools. This is REAL. The loop repeats.

When the SHOOTER turns his face toward the camera, SIMON

freezes the frame with a gesture and ZOOMS IN.

It's KABLE.

A MESSAGE is typed across the screen one letter at a time -

we may recognize the retro chicago font from the HUMANZ video

prank earlier:

Then, blinking, lo-fi in the lower right corner of the wall:

MUSIC: Bloodhound Gang, The Bad Touch:

Ha-ha, well now, we call this the act of mating

But there are several other very important differences

Between human beings and animals

That you should know about...

You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals

So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel...

PAVEMENT flies by... sun SLAMS rainbow flares into the

lens... ROLLER SKATES break frame, outpacing us...

We're cruising along with a group of YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE,

skating like ROBOTS through a CITY PARK... Roller-Dolly

follows HOT GIRLS in DAISY DUKES, knee socks and tube tops,

belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs...

ATHLETIC DUDES, shirtless, gun racks and six packs...

They SWING THEIR ARMS mechanically, identically... synced

with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face

plastered with an absurd, exaggerated GRIN... let's FUCKING

PARTY!!!

We are in a super-saturated world... NOT virtual/animated,

but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is

heightened, off-kilter.

On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a

WATER BATTLE, blasting and soaking each other with big

plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS...

A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS,

totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings... One of the SKATERS,

out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed... The

SKATER takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare

legs... she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but

STILL GRINNING ecstatically...

A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium

balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of

interest and breaks off SPRINTING FULL SPEED...

People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever... MAKING OUT on

the ground... and in the middle of it all...

CLOSE-UP: a SPARROW is pecking at a hunk of orange and yellow

CANDY CORN.

POP OUT WIDE to reveal that the BIRD is EATING OUT OF A

GIRL'S HAND...

This is ANGIE: 25, BLONDE/black roots... micro mini skirt,

fishnets, boots... green-eyes, haunted, with sadness behind

them; pretty - the clothes don't quite match her; it's like

someone dressed her up as a hooker.... She doesn't seem to

notice the little bird munching away; she stands in the

middle of the PARK, looking around, lost.

She spots a GUY standing by himself near a giant sculpture.

She walks over to him; the BIRD flutters away.

The GUY is young and attractive, dressed in casual business

attire. He is wearing a PLASTIC PIG SNOUT on his face, tied

with an elastic band.

He smiles like a Driver's License photo.

CLOSE-UP of LIPS, profile - by the looks of it, an OVERWEIGHT

MALE... sweat, stubble. The ROOM is DARK - lit by the

AMBIENT GLOW of a VIDEO SCREEN.

ANGIE echoes, practically overlapping.

We will continue to CUT between the two locations.

He WINKS.

ANGIE strikes an exaggeratedly DEMURE, FLIRTATIOUS POSE -

then immediately snaps back to NEUTRALITY.

A CLOSE-UP of LIPS to match GORGE'S, but facing the OPPOSITE

DIRECTION. An extremely butch, masculine FEMALE; trace of a

mustache.

ANGIE laughs, a beat LATE. Across the street a WOMAN has

hiked up her skirt, squatted down and is TAKING A PEE on the

sidewalk.

She strikes the same FLIRTY POSE for the second time.

He WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They

start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LIFTS

UP HER SKIRT with one hand and SQUEEZES A BOOB with the

other.

He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the

base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her;

SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders...

ANGIE just looks straight ahead... her EYES move to a nearby

building - the side is an ANIMATED BILLBOARD that has

switched to a promo for SLAYERS, with KABLE featured

prominently.

She watches KABLE'S face move... she lets out an involuntary

MOAN that is more like a whimper...

A SLAM OF AUDIO WITH THE SHOCK IMAGE OF A BLOODY, DEMONIC

FACE -

(recreating an internet-style video SHOCK PRANK)

... the SCREEN GOES DEAD -

... and another BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH, another MESSAGE:

We get our first wider view of the room. Much more cramped

than SIMON'S ROOM... like SIMON'S, the room is dominated by a

GIANT VIDEO SCREEN, but just the front wall... there are

other - smaller, paper thin - screens mounted in various

spots and leaning against walls; GARBAGE and TECH GEAR all

over the floor.

GORGE - late 30s, MORBIDLY OBESE - is contained by a massive

automated rolling chair, like the Escalade of Rascals.

The HUMANZ message has taken over his screen and he's GOING

FUCKING BALLISTIC, throwing shit at it and gesturing crazily

to the wall-mounted MOTION SENSORS with his hands, trying to

get the image back. It's NOT HAPPENING.

The TV REPORT continues on screen, where a NEWS HOST is

backed by a graphic showing the "society is rape" screen with

footage of exaggeratedly CONFUSED, FRUSTRATED PLAYERS -

they're like the actors in INFOMERCIALS who can't manage to

peel a potato without losing their shit.

A TREE LINED, SUN DAPPLED MOUNTAINSIDE whisks by as feet work

the pedals of a MOUNTAIN-BIKE; we're moving around 20 mph.

SOUND: SLUUURRRRRRRP.

CASTLE is cruising downhill in a 360 degree THREE-DIMENSIONAL

ENVIRONMENT that looks ABSOLUTELY REAL - except that he is on

a STATIONARY BIKE, and the NEWS REPORT is floating in the air

as a 3D WINDOW. He is wearing skintight Tour de France-style

gear and SLURPING A SMOOTHIE, one hand on the handlebar, the

other holding the cup.

CASTLE closes the WINDOW in his FIST.

SLUUURRRRRRP.

The SCREAM would be comical if it weren't so HORRIFIC.

With a dozen CONS looking on: an ASIAN PRISONER is on his

knees, FINGERS DEEP into the back of his own skull.

He rips into his BRAIN STEM with a tiny piece of busted

RAZOR, hoping to pull out a chip, a wire, anything. He pulls

out something, and drops like a sack of potatoes to the floor

- FRIED POTATOES. He lands on a couple of dumbbells, his

head smashing into the weight bench, spinal cord SEVERED.

KABLE looks on, impassive, emotion internalized.       GUARDS push

through.

An old black dude - LIFER - answers.

The GUARDS roll their eyes; drag away the body.

Across the room KABLE notices a NEW GUY - a mean-looking

sunofabitch... in fact, if murder were personified it would

look exactly like HACKMAN.

HACKMAN stares straight at KABLE. There is something in his

ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to

eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least.

FREEK is there.

Now HACKMAN is looking at KABLE dead blank. A GUARD comes up

behind HACKMAN and SHOVES HIM. HACKMAN turns; the GUARD

gestures him to follow.

KABLE turns to look.

KABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a

massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographically

projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Other

PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot.

KABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his

weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGET...

We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of

target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and

several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This

thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out

VICINITIES.

KABLE narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where other

PRISONERS are being briefed and UPGRADED... he spots HACKMAN.

KABLE glances at the GUARD... he struggles - part of him

feels like he's talking too much; but he can't help being

grateful for the human interaction.

KABLE gets a bead for a headshot on HACKMAN.

He pulls the trigger: a meaty CLICK.

KABLE is ALONE, toweling off - privilege of being a TOP

SLAYER.

We see now   the DAMAGE his body has taken - he is covered in

dark, ugly   BRUISES from BULLET HITS the body armor has

absorbed -   including a flinch-inducing cluster of BLACK, BLUE

AND YELLOW   from the most recent session.

From down the row of lockers, a WHISPER:

KABLE turns to look. HACKMAN'S head is POKED OUT sideways

from around the corner; he's maybe 20 feet away.

He brings his HANDS out where KABLE can see them - they are

SLICK WITH FRESH BLOOD.

HACKMAN is almost GIGGLING, high on it.

HACKMAN rubs his SLIPPERY HANDS together, relishing it; he

nods his head toward the area behind the lockers... to call

the situation CREEPY would be a serious understatement.

HACKMAN cracks his neck. Maybe not. KABLE pulls on his

PRISON GREYS quickly, refusing to make EYE CONTACT.

KABLE'S eyes narrow - What?

HACKMAN disappears; he starts to move along an ADJACENT ROW

OF LOCKERS, slamming the doors - SINGING fucking PINOCCHIO:

KABLE tenses up, ready for INSTANT VIOLENCE.

If he didn't have KABLE'S attention before, THIS GOT IT.

KABLE is instantly ALL BUSINESS - he's going to make HACKMAN

disappear RIGHT THE FUCK NOW...

He JAMS around the corner but HACKMAN is NOWHERE TO BE

SEEN... past another row of lockers - NOTHING... another...

another... WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

NOWHERE.

KABLE SLAMS a FIST into a locker, BUSTING it off it's hinges.

The CAMERA ANGLE on HACKMAN begins to switch perspectives and

spin around, as though someone is manipulating it in three

dimensions.

Snap out to reveal CASTLE in a dark lounge; the walls and

ceiling are pure black, making it impossible to tell the

dimensions of the room. Minimalist, expensive looking

furniture is scattered around. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE

ROOM.

CASTLE is standing, bare feet on white shag carpet. He is

manipulating the image of HACKMAN in the air by pulling,

squeezing, twisting with his hands - the interface is similar

to the one in SIMON'S room.

CASTLE is as pumped as a kid on Christmas morning. Then, from

behind him:

We see that a perfect double of CASTLE himself has appeared

in the room behind him.

He changes the angle on HACKMAN'S mug to give a better view -

then turns to face his DOUBLE...

Another CASTLE appears to CASTLE'S left.

CASTLE faces them.

CASTLE pokes a finger at CASTLE 2.

Suddenly the room has gone dead silent. We swing the camera

around to reveal that CASTLE 3 is all alone in the room. He

stares into the void, calm and utterly in control.

The CAMERA moves past his head into PURE BLACK...

The black of the underground tunnel... the TUNNEL LIGHTS

streak past like vanishing stars... TRAIN TRACKS blur by...

KABLE is SPRINTING down the TUNNEL towards DAYLIGHT.          The

VOICE comes from the rear surrounds:

KABLE shakes his head, thinking he's HEARING THINGS.

KABLE knifes through the tunnel EXIT...

We are in the OVER-THE-SHOULDER POV of the FLY CAM as KABLE

breaks daylight and slides down the hillside... superimposed

over the IMAGE: SIMON'S REFLECTED FACE... the CAMERA pans,

centers and FOCUSES IN on the REFLECTION...

SNIPER BULLETS whistle by; KABLE DUCKS, ROLLS... the CAMERA

PULLS BACK... OUT OF THE SCREEN...

... past the flesh and blood SIMON into an OVER-THE-SHOULDER -

SIMON controlling KABLE, PLAYING HIM - as...

KABLE LANDS in the ROCKSTAR POSE. SIMON mirrors him in front

of the GIANT SCREEN - whatever SIMON does, KABLE echoes.

KABLE makes it to cover, HEART SLAMMING.           We hear the distant

THUMPS of MORTARS LAUNCHING.

SIMON POP-LOCKS - the breakdance arm wave.

KABLE finishes the POP-LOCK - it's goofy.

A SHELL impacts the dirt nearby and BLOWS A MASSIVE CRATER in

the firma; KABLE shields himself from the raining DEBRIS and

scrambles for better cover.

They spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of

BUILDINGS; SIMON moves KABLE to join him. Just as KABLE gets

there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAULT

SHOTGUN, shredding the BROWN.

Two more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE,

TRIANGULATING.

KABLE ROLLS - BIG AMMO displacing the air just inches above

his head and BLOWING OUT the windows/tires of an ABANDONED

CAR behind him - switches TURRETS and comes up FIRING...

armor-piercing shells: BOOM. BOOM.

A 180 spin... BOOM.      MINUS three BLUES.

In QUICK CUTS we see SIMON striking BADASS poses; on the 3D

screen KABLE ECHOES THEM - it's like a SYNCHRONIZED DANCE.

KABLE keeps moving - he passes a BLUE, on his knees in the

mud; The BLUE has completely LOST HIS SHIT.

KABLE doesn't bother to shoot him; he's UNARMED. But...

SHHHTUNK. A 50 CALIBER SHELL connects from somewhere distant

and the BLUE is VAPORIZED, a smear on the pavement.

KABLE doesn't even register this. His darting eyes pick up a

familiar face in the chaos: FREEK.

FREEK has apparently volunteered as a generi-con - he is

dressed as a postman, pulling a cart of mail behind him as he

walks across the street.

It all happens too quickly: A BROWN scrambles behind FREEK

and ducks down, using him as a moving human shield; squeezes

off a few shots - FREEK is chopped up by incoming gunfire -

the BROWN keeps running... there's nothing KABLE can do.

An explosion nearby pushes them forward.

An exposed concrete stairwell leads into the bowels of a

collapsed building; it looks like it must've gotten the

OKLAHOMA CITY treatment in the early 2000s.

But there's still juice feeding the dim FLUORESCENTS... KABLE

makes his way DOWN. A distant voyeur's POV - maybe a

sniper's telescopic sight? - observes KABLE disappearing

underground.

He emerges in an UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL. Forty or fifty

cars and SUVs, 2000-2009, lie dormant, covered in dirt,

dust, and debris. KABLE switches on a LIGHT built in to his

weapon.

The FLY CAM scans 360 degrees, independent of KABLE, giving

them two sets of eyes.

KABLE nods toward an EXIT at the opposite end, marked P-4.

They make for it.

LATER

KABLE emerges several blocks from where he started, on a

narrow block that seems distant from the heat of combat.

Buildings shelter the street on either side... several blocks

down a LOW WALL BLOCKS THE ROAD - marked with RED DIAGONAL

STRIPES and a warning: RESTRICTED.

KABLE just grunts; his eyes steal a last look down the block.

They head the other way...

THOOM.

CLOSE RANGE: a big ass armor piercing MORTAR SHELL PASSES IN

FRONT OF KABLE'S FACE...

Time STOPS; KABLE sees the shell moving through the air an

inch from his nose in ULTRA SLO-MO... his cheeks ripple from

the displaced air...

then, REAL TIME - we whip around to follow the mortar as it

whistles into concrete and BLOWS OUT the front of a building.

KABLE is running.

He rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the

direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the impact

still raining down... and then:

From behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of

IRON PIPE. He half crumples, spins - HACKMAN.

HACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN, knocking the WEAPON out of KABLE'S

hand; it skitters across the concrete.

SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no

time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every

move pings a step late...

KABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is

moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control.

HACKMAN slams the    pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, DROPPING

HIM - then tosses    the pipe away... and pulls out a nasty,

high tech-looking    SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and points

the barrel at his    FACE.

He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER...

The SUBMARINE ALARM SOUNDS.       FLOODLIGHTS CRANK UP.

The LEDs on HACKMAN'S gun POWER DOWN with an audible down-

cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and

plops onto KABLE'S FOREHEAD.

A BROWN CON walks slowly, on unsteady legs, out of the

OCTAGONAL SAVE SHACK - profile...

dudes look at him and back away... when he turns toward us we

see why: half his head, shoulder and one arm are blown off...

KABLE seizes the opportunity to jam a foot up into HACKMAN'S

BALLS, buckling him. He twists HACKMAN'S LEGS into a pretzel

and throws him off.

KABLE sees GUARDS appearing and BLUES hurrying away from

ambush positions - including the one who likely fired the

mortar... session complete.

KABLE cups a hand over his mouth, conspiratorially, and

speaks directly into SIMON'S ear:

This is unthinkable, dangerous talk.

A GUARD grabs KABLE and the LINK BREAKS - we...

A drab brownstone apartment.

Shades block out the oppressive nicotine sunlight; the

interior is mute, faded - claustrophobic. KABLE has his cell;

even though ANGIE is on the outside, and free, her

environment seems to parallel his.

A worn-out photo is taped to the fridge: the same little girl

in KABLE'S picture.

She stands in front of a closet mirror in the bedroom,

looking herself over. She's FULLY DRESSED... but not like we

saw her in society. Conservative. Pretty. NORMAL. She

rehearses a friendly smile, but has difficulty not breaking

into tears.

ANIMATED, COLORED LIGHT leaks in from outside through the

dark window blinds behind her - some sort of projected

advertising?

CUT TO: same room, later. ANGIE sits on the unmade bed. She

searches through her purse for a PILL JAR, rattles a few into

her hand... she DRY SWALLOWS them... leans forward, eyes

shut, struggling NOT TO PASS OUT... she has to pull herself

together somehow... the CAMERA pushes past her, toward the

window, where the ANIMATED COLORS play 24-7...

... the CAMERA pulls away, continuing the motion: we are on a

wide view of the outside of the building, a rundown

brownstone on a rundown street - animated advertising covers

half the side of the structure...

An ad for slayers is running - KABLE, in cinematic slo-mo,

and superimposed in wall-height block letters:

And then:

ANGIE sits uncomfortably in a hard plastic chair; the light

is flat, fluorescent... in front of her, behind a desk, is a

no-nonsense Social Services CASEWORKER, late 30s, CUBAN.

ANGIE delivers the smile we saw her rehearse with all the

warmth she can muster; it's not convincing.

The CASEWORKER looks over the paperwork while ANGIE shifts in

her seat... torture.

She makes brief eye contact with ANGIE.

This is not going well. ANGIE holds her tongue with all of

her will, not wanting to make it worse. The CASEWORKER holds

all the cards.

ANGIE nods.

ANGIE is hanging on... be pleasant, be friendly, breathe...

but INSIDE she wants to cry, to scream, to fucking EXPLODE.

The CASEWORKER presses a buzzer, unlocking the door behind

ANGIE.

The words burn into ANGIE like battery acid, but there's not

a thing she can say.

SIMON is lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling - a GIANT

VIDEO SCREEN playing back key moments of that day's Slayers

session in an endless loop. SIMON holds his fingers up in

front of his face, zooming and rewinding the video with

little fluid movements of his hands.

Suddenly the screen GLITCHES OUT, goes dead for a second -

and when it comes back the battle images are replaced by a

GIANT FACE, surrounded by black, STARING DOWN AT HIM:

HUMANZ BROTHER, early 30's; a savvy leader with an

unforgettable presence.

His style is a throwback to another era; like a 70s Black

Panther Soul Brother transplanted into the high tech future.

SIMON puts it all together.

HUMANZ BROTHER just shakes his head.

SIMON can't deal.

HUMANZ BROTHER slowly ZOOMS HIMSELF IN.

SIMON can't help but consider it, mind reeling. It's obvious

KABLE would royally fucking dominate, but... SIMON shakes it

off.

HUMANZ BROTHER leans back - he has him.

[MUSIC: TWISTED SISTER, "I WANNA ROCK" kicks in]

A WINDOW pops up on the screen:

[ "I WANNA ROCK" continues...]

One light... HACKMAN'S FACE, glistening with sweat, is the

only thing partially visible in the inky black... the CAMERA

slowly ZOOMS into his EYES... twin pools of MADNESS... of

MURDER...

CLOSE-UP of the FADED PHOTO... gold hair, innocent

laughter... KABLE runs his thumb across it tenderly,

caressing the lines...

KABLE looks up. It's the SAME VOICE as before - the one that

gave him the photo.

KABLE doesn't answer; he absorbs her words, wondering if he

can believe them... finally:

KABLE stares into the DARK, turning it over in his head, then

looks up at the WINDOW in the door, a simple black rectangle -

and on the other side, his only LIFELINE.

BLACK.

Overhead fluorescents shock and hum to life, revealing a

CLAUSTROPHOBIC ROOM - four walls, metal grating underfoot -

and A LOCKER. KABLE is in his COMBAT BROWN.

He PRINT ACTIVATES the locker. The WEAPON is there... and

something else: a wrinkled BROWN PAPER BAG. What the hell?

He takes it out, trying not to glance too obviously at the

overhead SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

CUT TO the POV from the CAM: KABLE is opening the bag...

BACK in the room. Inside the brown bag is a FIFTH OF VODKA.

KABLE quickly slips it into his side cargo-pocket.

Behind KABLE a DOOR SLIDES OPEN automatically, revealing a

CONCRETE TUNNEL, like the PLAYERS' entrance to a FOOTBALL

STADIUM... the WHITE LIGHT is BLINKING ON and OFF... SOLDIERS

sprint for the daylight, trying to escape the TORTURE... it's

CHAOS.

KABLE grabs the bottle from his pocket, struggling to

maintain as the LIGHT slams into his brain, AGONY.

ALL SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS POINT AT KABLE. KABLE - no choice -

makes the decision, twists the cap, tilts his head back, and

SLAMS THE ENTIRE BOTTLE.

He wails the BOTTLE at one of the CAMERAS, shattering it -

and joins the others rushing into combat.

KABLE breaks the DAYLIGHT - but without a smooth LEAP AND

ROLL, and no ROCKSTAR POSE - instead, he TRIPS and tumbles

ASS OVER END down an embankment, landing in a heap at the

bottom.

KABLE tests his hands, clenching and unclenching - THE KID

WASN'T LYING ... while starting to trip hard on the VODKA,

which is kicking in INSTANTLY...

An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE DIRT just a few feet away, BLINDING,

DEAFENING - and KABLE shifts into ANOTHER WORLD...

He's MOVING FAST... SOUND is just an idea, disconnected from

reality... BODIES AND BULLETS drift by without gravity... his

vision doubles and bleeds...

BLUES. Lots of them.        KABLE starts shooting wildly - HITTING

NOTHING.

KABLE is running erratically at least... hard to HIT... but

definitely HEADED SOMEWHERE.

A SHELL SMACKS KABLE'S shoulder, knocking him off his feet;

the armor absorbs it, but he's out of time... he's shooting

air...

We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER...

KABLE is still firing randomly as the turret shifts - the

SWARMER goes STRAIGHT UP, then locks on BLUE and swerves down

on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss

cheese.

Too close.

He scrambles to his feet and charges for the entrance to the

UNDERGROUND GARAGE.

KABLE slams open a door marked P4 and stumbles into the CAR

GRAVEYARD...

Reality is ROARING, SPINNING... KABLE slams into the side of

a parked car, legs rubber... he looks it over - TIRES FLAT,

NO GOOD... he stumbles to the next, then another...

another... his head hits a passenger side window,

SPIDERWEBBING IT...

FINALLY, the ONE: A FORD F-250 SUPER CHIEF... GUN METAL GREY,

PRISTINE.

Note: the F-250 is a CONCEPT TRUCK - a future design for

FORD'S F-line. In our world this is a 2009 factory model,

which makes it old, but not antique. The truck is about as

BADASS as you could want, with dark, narrow windows, big ass

wheels and a FRONT END that looks like it could PUNCH THROUGH

A BUILDING OR TWO.

KABLE gets to the FUEL CAP DOOR and pries it open... ENGRAVED

under the cap is a prominent WARNING:

KABLE unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat.

Dry heave. He does it again - this time puts his mouth on

the hole and PUKES PURE LIQUID INTO THE TANK.

He stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the

feeling hits him again - and he heaves another fountain down

the hole. A BLUE shows up in the opposite stairwell - KABLE

brings his WEAPON up to hip level and BLOWS HIM AWAY WITHOUT

LOOKING. His head is clearing.

KABLE looks around, unzips his pants and PISSES INTO THE

TANK. SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless.

KABLE shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he's

regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVER'S

SIDE WINDOW, gets in; tears open the steering column - A

BLUE SLAYER shows up in the mirror - fuck! - He CRANKS THE

IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK...

BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole

into the dashboard.

KABLE checks what's left of the mirror.               HACKMAN and six

other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast.

VRUUUUUM, VRUUUM... KABLE hammers on the pedal again,

knocking out the old ghosts - VRROOOOOOMM!!

He SLAMS it into gear and PEELS OUT.

HACKMAN leaps onto the side of the moving truck and points

50mm directly at the side of KABLE'S head. In a split instant

KABLE grabs the nose of the weapon and points it up -

BOOM! A close range shell blows through the roof of the

truck. KABLE slams the brakes, spinning the truck, and

launches HACKMAN into a row of parked cars.

HACKMAN gets in one last shot as KABLE punches it out of the

garage, disintegrating a concrete column.

He slams his head into the windshield of a parked car, caving

it in.

KABLE DRIFTS the F-250 onto the street, sideways, tires

shrieking... wiping out two unlucky BLUES... pops it and

TAKES OFF...

He is headed STRAIGHT INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA.

The FLY CAM is right there, taking the hot turn right on the

truck's tail, giving SIMON the POV of a classic 3D DRIVING

GAME. He activates DYNAMIC CAMERA CONTROL with a gesture -

now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the CAMERA

forward, next to the driver's window...

The CAMERA looks to the side at KABLE, driving like he's on a

mission to HELL. SIMON barks in his head.

KABLE ignores him; he picks up his WEAPON, points it out the

window at the FLY and FIRES... the FLY jukes out of the way,

barely... it spins off OUT OF CONTROL and SMASHES through the

window of a building. Bye, FLY.
