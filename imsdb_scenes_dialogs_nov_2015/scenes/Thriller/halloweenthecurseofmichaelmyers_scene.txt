Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers - by Daniel Farrands

HALLOWEEN 6

THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS

DARKNESS fills the SCREEN.  SUPERIMPOSE:

October 30, 1995

DEAD SILENCE for what seems like an eternity, followed by a

startling, bone-chilling SCREAM as we

FADE IN:

INT. DUNGEON - TUNNELS - NIGHT (DISTORTED)

The agonizing SCREAMS continue as we MOVE rapidly through a

labyrinth of winding underground tunnels.  Glowing torches light

the way.  Blurry, indistinct silhouettes of grim FIGURES wearing

black-cowled robes flash along the dank, craggy walls.

As we BLAST around dark corners, we realize we are looking from

the P.O.V. of a SCREAMING young woman being pushed forward on a

gurney.  Plunging deeper into this hellish maze.

A door is SLAMMED.  Wooden.  Heavy.  Muffling the SCREAMS.

Spurs CLANK on a pair of silver-tipped cowboy boots as a

MYSTERIOUS STRANGER steps into VIEW.  Long black duster.

Widebrimmed fedora.  Lit cigarette dangling between gloved

fingers.

INT. BIRTHING CHAMBER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A rat scampers from a hole, foraging in the muck of a rotted

rack.  A white sheet, saturated with blood, covers the parted legs

of JAMIE LLOYD, now 16, cheeks flushed with perspiration.

MARY, a young midwife, rushes in with a bowl of hot water.  Jamie

lurches, knocking the bowl out of the girl's hands; it SHATTERS on

the floor.

Mary's face is frozen in horror.  Jamie's SCREAMS build to an

unnerving crescendo.  The paiin too much for her to bear.

Lurid SHOCK CUTS from the previous "Halloween" entries -- a

surrealistic blend of IMAGES and VOICES -- as Jamie relives her

terrifying childhood ordeal:

A)   LAURIE STRODE (Jamie Lee Curtis) twists and squirms as she is

B)   Trapped in her bedroom, 10-YEAR-OLD JAMIE (Danielle Harris)

C)   RACHEL (Ellie Cornell) dies in anguish as the Shape plunges a

D)   Jamie sinks to her knees behind the fallen Shape, taking its

E)   BLINDING EXPLOSION rips through cinderblock.  A jail cell blown

Pitiful wails of death.  OFFICERS writhing in pools of blood.  In

the aftermath of this carnage stands YOUNG JAMIE.

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT (SAME)

Jamie struggles against her bonds.  Pushing.  SCREAMING.  Lapsing

in and out of consciousness during the excruciating pangs of

labor.  Haunted by low, moaning VOICES.  CHANTING.

EXT. POLICE STATION - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT (NEW FOOTAGE)

RESUME Jamie, filled with repidation as she staggers through the

smoke-filled cell into a darkened, drizzly alleyway.

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

Beyond the clearing wisps of smoke, THREE FIGURES wearing black

ski masks usher THE SHAPE -- arms and legs shackled in heavy

chains -- into the back of a white van.

BACK TO SCENE

Mutely terrified, Jamie backs away -- into the arms of another

figure, obscured by smokescreen:  the Mysterious Stranger!

Jamie's scream is cut off as the Stranger descends upon her like

the Angel of Death.

A cigarette arcs throug the darkness like a tiny flare.  Crushed

under the boot of the Stranger.

A moment later, Jamie is shoved into the front seat of the van.

Doors SLAM.  Tires SCREECH over wet pavement.

THE ENTIRE PRECINCT EXPLODES IN A HUGE CONFLAGRATION!

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT

A SLAP and the first cry of the newborn BABY.  Jamie sobs

uncontrollably, the straps preventing her from reaching him.

The infant is wrapped in black swaddling.  The wooden door CREAKS

open.  Jamie's eyes fill with horror as the shadow of the Stranger

fills the room.  Standing at the threshold.  Waiting to receive

the child.

The dark sentinels march out in somber procession, ignoring her

desperate pleas.  Torches lighting the way.

Jamie's heartrending SHRIEKS are cut off by the cold sound of the

SLAMMING DOOR.

MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

A diaphanous column rises, a ghostly, slow-motion cylinder of

flame that BURNS through the SCREEN to form the MAIN TITLE:

The OPENING CREDITS are BRANDED against the BLACK SCREEN by an

invisible, kenetic force, interspersed with a SERIES OF CUTS:

Jamie's baby is lain upon a primitive altar.  Ringed by eleven

stones engraved with cryptic markings.

Hooded, faceless figures.  Torches held aloft.  Disembodied

VOICES.  Whispering.  Invoking a dark spell.

MARY, the young midwife, peers around a corner.  Eyes glazed with

horror.  Watching.  Spying.

The newborn SCREAMS.  The flattened blade of a dagger smears a

triangular symbol in blood over the baby's torso.

We MOVE IN on this symbol, capturing it in FREEZE FRAME.  It burns

off into fiery cinders, disintegrating into DARKNESS.

Silence.  Then a startling CLAP OF THUNDER as we

A SIGN POST

standing askew in a matted patch of lawn.  WIND and RAIN.  INTENSE

FLASH of LIGHTNING illuminates:

"For Sale By Strode Realty - SOLD"

EXT/INT. MYERS HOUSE - SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

MOVE along a trail of drowning toys -- baseball, Power Rangers, a

deck of Pogs -- TOWARD a weather-beaten porch.  Leftover gallons

of Sears Best.  Brushes soaking in turpentine.  A dozen or so 2 x

2s l;ined up to replace a row of broken railing slats.

P.O.V. LOOKS UP to the tall, brooding edifice.  Address reads:  45

Lampkin Lane.  Fresh coat of white paint over old clapboard.  New

shutters on the narrow windows.  A jack-o'-lantern grins behind

filmy curtains.  The Myers house.

Despite its recent face-lift, it looks just as foreboding as it

did in "Halloween I."

P.O.V. stalks down the side of the house, around to the back

door.  Opens it and quietly MOVES inside.

P.O.V. MOVES across the darkened kitchen.  A drawer is opened.

LIGHTNING reveals a large butcher knife being withdrawn.

P.O.V. glides past the living room -- a few boxes, furniture to be

arranged -- and MOVES swiftly UP a long flight of stairs.

Down the long, dark hallway ... through a door.  A bedroom.

P.O.V. FINDS 6-year-old DANNY STRODE ... tossing and turning in

the throes of a nightmare.

An ear-splitting THUNDER CRASH causes the boy to bolt upright in

bed, looking right into the P.O.V.  Sweating.  Shaking.

Petrified.

DANNY'S P.O.V.

The THUNDER seems to ROAR from the ferocious jaws of T-REX -- a

24" scale model posing on a shelf among an army of Jurassic

monsters.  Seemingly brought to life by the ELECTRICAL STORM.

FOLLOW DANNY

as he leaps out of bed and pads across polished wooden floors into

the hallway.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  With the next THUNDER CRASH

comes a startling, barely intelligible VOICE.

Danny freezes.  Slowly turns.

DANNY'S POV

An ominous shadow at the end of the hall, illuminated by

LIGHTNING.  Long duster and brimmed hat.  The Stranger!  In his

outstretched hand, the gleaming butcher knife!

BACK TO SCENE

Danny screams!  THUNDER CRASHES HELLISHLY.  Lights flash on.

Doors fly open.  Suddenly Danny is swept up in the protective arms

of his mother, KARA, 22.

The little boy holds onto her for dear life.  Crying

hysterically.  Eyes clenched tightly.

Kara looks in the direction he's pointing.  In the light there's

just an antique coat rack -- "dressed" in a hat, rain jacket and

old silver-tipped umbrella.

Danny dares to look -- but now only cries harder.

Kara carries Danny back to his room, averting the steely-eyed gaze

of her father, JOHN STRODE, staunch, late 40s, wearing boxer

shorts and a well-worn undershirt.

Kara ignores him as her mother, DEBRA, careworn face with

compassionate eyes, tries to lend a hand.

Debra sighs resignedly.  TIM, 18, stocky and streetwise, wearing

torn red sweat pants and "Ice-T" t-shirt, casually replaces his

Walkman headphones and returns to his room.

INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (A FEW MINUTES LATER)

Kara opens the closet and switches on the light.  Satisfying Danny

that it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine.

Danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in.

Kara sighs.  They've been through this one before.

Danny is afraid to tell her.

Kara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead.  Then she

goes to the closet, just about to turn out the light --

Kara adjusts the closet door, causing one of Danny's school

drawings to fly off the wall.  She picks it up on her way out.

Kara softly closes the door.  Danny lies awake, blankets drawn up

to his chin, eyes wide.  Still very much afraid.

INT. KARA'S ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

Kara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting Danny's

drawing on a pile of open books.  Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke

cans.  Telltale signs of a late-night cram session.

Adjusting the dial on her FM/alarm clock, Kara begins to move

about the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the

subtly-seductive voice of a WOMAN comes over the radio:

The woman is cut off by the nasally, steel-trap voice of HARRY

SIMMS, talk radio's most popular man of controversy:

Wearing only her bra and panties, Kara moves to a full-length

mirror and lets down her long, flaxen hair.  Beneath her studious

exterior, she is quite attractive:  delicate features with an

enviable, naturally-toned figure.

A CLICK as the woman is abruptly DISCONNECTED.

Kara suddenly whirls around, startled by a FLASH of something -- a

face -- in the mirror!

Drawn to the window behind her, she rubs off rainy mist and peers

outside.

KARA'S P.O.V.

of the large Victorian frame house directly across the street.

Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the shadow of a man standing in

the uppermost window -- looking right at her!

ANGLE ON KARA

Frightened, her eyes lock on Danny's drawing.  A child's

scribbling in red Crayon:  The triangular symbol of Thorn!

EXT. MYERS HOUSE / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE

Kara draws the priscilla curtains over the window as we PULL BACK

through the pouring RAIN ... toward the house across the street.

An ornate sign on the front door reads:

"Blankenship House - Rooms Available"

CRANE UP toward the window where the shadowy figure stands.  An

insidious CRASH OF THUNDER as we PUSH through the window.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A macabre display of old newspaper headlines, arranged

helterskelter on a wall:  "HALLOWEEN KILLS ESCAPES FROM ASYLUM."

"HORROR IN HADDONFIELD:  MICHAEL MYERS CLAIMS 16 LIVES."  "REIGN

OF TERROR ENDS AS MYERS PERISHES IN VIGILANTE EXPLOSION."

Harry Simms BOOMS over a state-of-the-art HiFi system.  A cassette

tape RECORDS the continuing broadcast.

Staring out the window at the Myers house, TOMMY DOYLE, a

strapping 25-year-old with reddish brown hair and intense eyes,

cradles a cordless phone.

Tommy paces nervously around his sparsely-furnished attic

apartment.  Classic horror movie one-sheets and mint first edition

comic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns,

knives, and survivalist weapons.

Tommy pauses, mesmerized by one of the newspaper clippings.

MOVE IN TIGHT on the headline, frail and yellowed by age:

"November 1, 1978.  TOMMY DOYLE SURVIVES BABYSITTER BLOODBATH."

Directly beneath this:  "November 3, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD FEARED

DEAD IN POLICE STATION MASSACRE."

CLOSE ON a photograph of young Jamie and

INT. DUNGEON - CHAMBER - NIGHT

Jamie remains strapped to the table, wrapped in bloody sheets.

Eyes closed.  Deathly still.  Suddenly an urgent, WHISPERING VOICE

pierces the darkness:

Jamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her

straps.

Jamie can't believe her eyes.  Mary opens a threadbare knapsack --

revealing the baby inside!

A soul-shuddering RUMBLE echoes throughout the cavern.  Jamie

leaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence.

Pulsing with adrenaline, Jamie harnesses the knapsack over her

shoulders and follows Mary out into the tunnels.

TUNNEL GATE

Chains GRIND over rusted pulleys.  A massive iron gate rises,

revealing a pair of filthy work boots.  Legs planted in bold

stance as a tall, ominous shape begins to emerge.

ANOTHER TUNNEL

The terrified midwife leads Jamie with her baby on a breathless

flight through the winding network of tunnels.  Haunted by the

ECHOING SOUNDS of the rising gate.

STALKING P.O.V. - THROUGH TUNNELS

Gliding forward into the hollow catacombs.  Slow by determined.

Sensing the way.

ANOTHER PART OF THE TUNNELS

Reaching a corner, Mary stops and sends Jamie off in the opposite

direction.

Jamie runs, disappearing down the dark tunnel.  Mary quickly

removes her shoes and tears off, now SILENT.

STALKING P.O.V.

surges around a corner.  FINDS Mary.  MOVES IN on her.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mary turns in small circles.  Fear mounting as she falters into

darkness.  Heavy, labored BREATHING fills the tunnel.

A mask -- the pale, neutral features of a man weirdly distorted by

the rubber -- materialized out of the void right behind her.  THE

SHAPE!

Mary turns, about to scream when the Shape lunges out, lifts her

up by the nape of the neck and SLAMS her forehead into a large

metal SPIKE jutting out from the cavern wall!

Leaving her impaled like a fish on a hook, the Shape resumes its

relentless pursuit.  Eerie under the lighted torches.

END OF TUNNEL

Jamie runs frantically.  Methodical, heavy FOOTSTEPS behind her.

She chances a look behind.  The Shape is coming!

Jamie vaults up a dark stairwell.  A trap door above.  It won't

budge.  Jamie frantically POUNDS against the hatch.

The Shape mounts the stairs!

Strength fueled by sheer desperation, Jamie forces the door open.

Tumbles onto muddy ground.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Jamie drags herself out of the hole and half-runs, half-stumbles

with her baby through an ugly, charred forest.  Sharp branches

whip at her face.  RAIN falls.  LIGHTNING streaks across the sky.

As if hell-spawned, the Shape emerges from the underground chamber

and trudges forward, bold and unstoppable.

Jamie tumbles into a gully, nearly dropping the knapsack.  She

picks herself up, hands groping at rain-sopped earth.  The Shape

is right behind her!

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT (SAME)

A slap-happy, overweight MOTORIST sips coffee from a 7-11 cup,

straining to see the road through falling rain and fogged-up

glasses.  Harry Simms keeps him mindlessly occupied.

The Motorisft lets out a hardy GUFFAW, spilling his coffee.

Fingers burning, he searches the glove compartment for a napkin.

The Motorist looks up.  Eyes go wide with panic.  Startled GASP.

P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Jamie stands in the middle of the road, SCREAMING bloody-murder.

EXT. WOODED ROAD / INT. PICKUP TRUCK (SAME)

Tires SCREECH.  The pickup stops on a dime.  The Motorist just

sits there, mouth agape as the shrieking girl throws open the door

and clambers into the passenger seat.

Through his side-view mirror, the unsuspecting Motorist sees the

outline of a quickly-approaching man.  Unrolling his window, he

rubbernecks a look outside.

CRUNCHING BONE and TEARING FLESH as the Shape's hands shoot

through the window, twisting the man's head off his shoulders!

Jamie SCREAMS!  Lunges for the steering wheel.  Slams her foot

down hard on the gas.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The pickup bullets forward, fishtailing up the road, never slowing

down as the driver's door flies open, dumping the motorists's

headless bulk into a muddy ditch.

INT. PICKUP (SAME)

Jamie drives.  Checks to see that her baby is safe.  Then lets out

a PRIMAL SCREAM.  A hysterical release of fear and rage, drowned

out by the squabble of VOICES over the radio:

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

LIGHTNING FLASHES and RAIN pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin.

This is a man's retreat and has been for years.  Dark wood, worn

leather, a few tastefully-chosen antiques.  Floor-to-floor ceiling

shelves containing a myriad of books and an impressive display of

awards and degrees, all bearing the name:  SAMUEL J. LOOMIS, Ph.D.

After a STATION IDENTIFICATION, "The Harry Simms Show" resumes,

tinny-voiced CALLERS blaring over a handsomely-restored 1928

Bremer-Tully.

MOVE IN behind a bald, sharp-featured man, hunched over a can as

he reminisces over a collection of framed photographs -- memories

of his wife and children.

Turning at the mention of his name is DR. LOOMIS himself, wearing

spectacles, a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee.  For

the first time ever, we actually see him smile.  The burn scars on

his face have all but faded away.  Last traces of the horrid past.

Loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper

article.  As he arranges the strips of paper in a leather-bound

scrapbook, a sudden KNOCK at the door gives him a startle.

EXT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

An ominous FIGURE, clad in hat and trench coat, stands beneath the

glowing porch light, silhouetted in the pouring RAIN.

Loomis opens the door, eyes straining in the semi-darkness, trying

to identify his unexpected visitor.

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Shuffling inside, dripping with rain, DR. TERENCE WYNN, a

well-dressed gentleman in his 50s, removes his hat and coat,

quickly making himself at home by the crackling fire.

Wynn heads for the kitchen, rummaging through cabinets and drawers

as Loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail.

Loomis immediately senses that Wynn has an angle.

Wynn returns with a bottle of Irish whiskey and two shot glasses.

Thrusts one in Loomis's hand and begins to pour.

Loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news.

The two old sparring partners drink to the occasion.  But Wynn's

angle soon comes to the helm.

Loomis prepares himself for the bomb.

Loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable

easy chair, amused at the irony of Wynn's speech.

Loomis finally looks over at Wynn, surprised to find him standing

at the desk, looking through his scrap book.

We follow Wynn's gaze down toward the open page.  A blazing

tabloid headline:  "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OR ALIVE?"

EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jamie's getaway truck ROARS around a bend, tearing up a deserted

stretch of highway.  The STORM rages.

INT. PICKUP (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie strains to see as she drives through sheets of RAIN.  Bone

weary, fighting panic, holding one hand steady against the wheel,

the other on the CRYING infant.

Something up ahead.  Jamie's face fills with expectancy.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

A lighted sign appears out of the darkness.  Glowing salvation.

Familiar red-white-and-blue logo.  "GREYHOUND."

EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

The pickup drives into the glow of orange vapor lights.  SKIDS to

a stop in a deserted parking lot.  Jamie staggers out, cradling

the knapsack as she runs toward the old depot.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

Jamie blasts through double glass doors.  But the bus station is

devoid of life.  Empty benches.  Blank ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE

signboard.  The low hum of vending machines.

Jamie moves toward the ticket counter.  A handwritten sign left by

the attendant:  "BACK IN 20."

Shivering, holding her baby, Jamie enters an old-fashioned phone

booth.  Picks up the receiver and immediately dials 911.

Jamie slams the phone down in terrified frustration.  Suddenly she

becomes aware of the radio program.  Piped in over ancient

loudspeakers:

The STATION IDENTIFICATION cuts in.  Jamie picks up the receiver and

frantically dials the number.

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn doesn't give up the sales pitch even as Loomis leads him to the

door.  The radio program still squawking in the b.g.

As Wynn continues to talk, his voice trailing off into nothingness,

Loomis's attention is diverted to the VOICES on the radio.

Loomis's eyes widen; a man possessed.

Loomis staggers.  A lifetime of nightmares coming back to haunt him

all at once.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME)

PRESS IN TIGHT ON TOMMY in bed.  Listening through headphones.

Sitting upright.  Thunderstruck.

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn watches with rapt attention as Loomis unlocks his safe and

withdraws a metal case.  He pops it open, revealing his trusted .357

Magnum and a box of cartridges.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (SAME)

A bus has arrived.  The ATTENDANT returns to his post.  Jamie hangs

up the phone, filled with trepidation as PASSENGERS file inside.  A

strung-out ROCKER.  A pair of stern-faced NUNS.  A PRETTY TEENAGER

greeted in the loving arms of her BOYFRIEND.

Just as she is about to step out of the phone booth, a TALL MAN,

back turned, wearing a hat and black trench coat, moves to stand

outside the booth!  Jamie freezes.

Securing her baby in the knapsack, Jamie throws open the door.

Suddenly the Tall Man steps in her path!

Shaking uncontrollably, Jamie shrinks away.  Backing down a narrow

hall through the door marked "LADIES ROOM."

INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT (SAME)

Water runs into a grimy basin.  Unable to contain her tears, she

washes the newborn.  Takes a roll of paper towels and tries to rub

the triangular blood mark off his chest.

Suddenly the lights go out.  Jamie gasps.  Clutching her baby, she

turns off the faucet and melts into the darkness.

The door CREAKS open.  FOOTSTEPS echo inside.

JAMIE

has locked herself inside one of the stalls.  Heart pounding.  The

FOOTSTEPS grow louder.  Jamie's eyes dart frantically.

STALKING P.O.V.

MOVING methodically past the row of stalls, pushing open each door,

revealing that they are all empty.  A CRASH from the last stall.

P.O.V. moves toward it.  RUSTLING and MOVEMENT inside.

A HAND pushes on the door.  An open window above the toilet.  Jamie

is gone!

EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie trembles off a stack of crates piled beneath the window and

dashes around the side of the depot.

Suddenly the bus ROARS by, sending up a muddy wave as it pulls out,

disappearing down the highway.

Jamie moves swiftly across the parking lot, clutching the knapsack.

She throws open the door of the pickup and jumps into the driver's

seat.

INT. PICKUP - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Slapping down the locks, Jamie thrusts the key into the ignition.

The engine REVS to life.  She guns it, peeling out of the parking

lot.  Back toward the highway.

She drives on, suppressing her tears, stealing glances at the

knapsack bunched up on the passenger's seat.  Then she turns and

looks forward with concentrated attention.

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

A sign looms ahead:  "Haddonfield Memorial Hospital - 10 Mi."

BACK TO SCENE

Jamie sighs with relief, steadying the wheel just as --

HIGHBEAMS flash on right behind her, a juggernaut roaring out of

blackness!  Jamie's eyes flood with terror.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The grill of a familiar white van shoots forward, SLAMMING violently

against the pickup's rear bumper.

JAMIE

is jolted forward in her seat.  Holding on the wheel with a

white-knuckle grip as she's repeatedly hit from behind.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The unseen madman noses forward, veering sharply over the double

yellow line, scraping sides with the truck.

Headlights sear a path through the night, locked in neck-and-neck

profile.  SPARKS flashing at 70-miles-per-hour.

The van forces Jamie onto the shoulder.  It leaves the road, tearing

branches from trees.  Jamie SCREAMING.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - THE CHASE

A quick-cut MONTAGE, events ticking out in fractions of a second

like a nightmare:

The pickup springboards over a gulch and slams down hard, tires

spinning in waves of mud, careening through a vast field.  A

pumpking patch.

The van reappears in a glare of headlights.  Its engine screaming

with fire-breathing rage.

The pickup puts on a furious burst of speed.  Eating up pumpkins and

spinning out chunks of splattering seeds and pulp.

The van bears down hard, slingshotting across the field, whizzing

past the pickup, cutting right in front of it.

INT. PICKUP

Something heavy is thrown from the back of the van right through the

windshield!

Glass EXPLODES!  Jamie SCREAMS, hands going up instinctively to

protect her face.  Swerving wildly out of control.

She looks to see a sprawling, mutilated corpse on top of her.  Wide,

cold, lifeless eyes -- Mary!

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH (CONTINUOUS)

The pickup rockets at breakneck speed toward the edge of the field.

Suddenly --

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

The Shape stands in the field, tall and unmoving, white mask glowing

hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights.

BACK TO SCENE

The truck plows into the Shape, dragging it under, SLAMMING headlong

into the trunk of a huge oak tree.

Everything is abruptly and shockingly silent.  Like a phantom in the

night, the van is gone.  The Shape nowhere to be seen.

Steam billows from the pickup, engine TICKING, a heap of shattered

glass and mangled steel.  Pinned against the base of the tree is a

shape in human form -- a scarecrow!

MOVE IN on Jamie, face-down against the steering wheel.  Coughing on

the noxious fumes, she stirs back to life.  Slowly, painfully, she

shoulders the door.  Falls onto the ground.

A SPARK ignites.  BLINDING FLASH as the gas tank EXPLODES, setting

the truck ablaze.  Jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror.

Debris rains down on her.

Suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field.  The Shape -- wielding

an enormous butcher knife!

Jamie rolls onto her back, SCREAMING.

Suddenly the knife plunges down and lands with a terrible THUD.

INT. PICKUP

The knapsack catches fire ... but inside there is no baby.  Only a

roll of paper towels from the bus depot.

THE SCARECROW

burns; mocking Jamie with its grinning, hand-painted face.

THE SHAPE

looks at us, white mask scintillating against blinding rays of

SUNLIGHT.  Rivulets of blood drip off a large carving knife.

PULLING BACK, we see it is a life-sized, knife-wielding effigy of

Michael Myers, sitting astride the "For Sale by Strode Realty"

sign.  Stage blood spells out the words:  "He's coming!"

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

John Strode looks up with disgust as he inspects the grim monument

that's been left on his front lawn during the night.  Puffing on a

cigarette, wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe, John raises a

large axe.

A group of neighborhood KIDS -- some dressed in Halloween

costumes -- stand a safe distance away.  Gathered on the sidewalk.

Gawking, whispering, tittering.

John angrily swings the axe into the signpost.  The kids jump with a

collective start.

Suddenly the sign crashes down -- and "Michael Myers" with it.  The

kids huddle.  John turns on them, brandishing the axe.

That's all it takes.  The kids scatter, tripping over one another as

they tear off down the black.

Satisfied with himself, John stubs out his cigarette and hauls the

sign and its now-headless rider to the trash.

Then he trudges up the porch steps, dropping the axe as he enters

the house.  Uttering oaths under his breath.

BOOM UP over the surrounding neighborheed.  SUPERIMPOSE:

"Haddonfield, Illinois.  Halloween."

Last night's storm has given way to an incredibly bright and

picturesque morning.  CHILDREN pour out of their homes, bursting

with excitement, dressed in colorful costumes.

Even the Myers house, with its trimmed hedges and fresh coat of

paint, somehow manages to look invite.

A white van slowly rolls up the street.  WKNB logo, streamers and a

large orange banner proclaiming:  "HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE

HARVEST FAIRE '95 - See Harry Simms Live - October 31."  A

now-familiar voice booms over loudspeaker:

EXT. SANITARIUM - MORNING

A car bearing an official state emblem stops outside an imposing

curtain of security gates.  A large sign reads:  "SMITH'S GROVE -

WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

A hand reaches out and waves a plastic key card in front of an

infrared scanner.  Surveillance cameras perched on the walls.

As the gate yawns open and the car drives through, we SEE the asylum

in the distance -- the entire perimeter bounded by woods and barbed

wire fences.

INT. WYNN'S CAR (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn drives.  Loomis in the passenger seat, fueling his own

anxieties.

Wynn stares.  Loomis's words fall on him like a death sentence.

INT. SANITARIUM - RECEPTION AREA (SAME)

Gold insignia on mahogany doors:  "TERENCE WYNN - CHIEF OF STAFF."

Wynn and Loomis stride through a plush reception area.  DAWN, an

attractive, high-energy secretary, keeps pace, taking notes, handing

Wynn his briefcase, phone messages, etc.

Wynn stops abruptly before heading out the door.

Loomis acknowledges Wynn's silent understanding.

CORRIDOR

Wynn and Loomis move along a sterile white corridor.  Wynn uses his

key card to BUZZ them through a series of metal security cages.  A

retinue of DOCTORS and NURSES fall in behind.

They cut down a sub-passageway and out a fire exit.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis and Wynn dash across a windswept field where a Smith's Grove

medical transport helicopter awaits them.  The deafening WHINE of

spinning rotors as a TECHNICIAN refuels.

The doctors step inside.  The doors close and the helicopter lifts

off, rising high above the cluster of the white coats below.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

A blender whips up a revolting concoction of chocolate Yoo-Hoo,

banana yogurt and chewy Gummi-worms as Tim, wearing Levi's baggies

and a "Harry Simms Kicks Ass" T-shirt, raps on the phone.

Tim hangs up, guzzling down his shake as Debra navigates around him,

setting out the breakfast dishes as Kara tries to study.

John, dressed in what might be a respectable business suit if it fit

him better, mutters grumpily as he pours himself a cup of coffee.

Tim lets out a huge BELCH as he finishes drinking his breakfast.

Debra snatches the book out of Kara's hands.

Kara rises, collects her books, trying to avoid a confrontation.

Suddenly Danny runs in, showing off in his dinosaur costume.

ROARING loudly.  Startling John.

Kara immediately seizes Danny's hand and ushers him toward the back

door.

Debra reaches into her purse and hands Kara a couple of dollars.

John explodes, dumping the entire contents of her purse onto the

floor.  Debra recoils.  Kara steps in.  Danny is terrified.

Kara flies at him with Medea-like rage.  John instantly grabs her by

the neck and shoves her violently against the counter.

Danny looks outside.  Frozen in horror.  A VOICE whispers.

Danny moves across the kitchen.  Mesmerized.  Through the screen

door, the Shape can be seen standing in the back yard.

Kara's eyes bulge as John squeezes her throat.  Choking her.

John looks down to see the tip of a butcher knife pointed at his

groin.  Danny is holding it -- his eyes dark, emotionless.  Ever so

slowly, John releases Kara.  Debra and Tim watch in horrified

astonishment.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the back door.  Kara dives toward

Danny.  The knife clatters to the floor as she picks him up, grabs

her book bag and hurtles outside.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BACK YARD (CONTINUOUS)

BETH, 19, very "retro," cute in the waifish sense -- milky white

skin, two-tone hair and a dangling nose ring --is nearly bowled off

the back porch as Kara and Danny fly out the door.

Beth is taken aback when she sees the bruise on Kara's neck.

Suddenly Tim jumps out from behind a clothesline, locking his arms

around Beth, attacking her with kisses.

Beth shoves the clipboard at him, a champion of her cause.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (SAME)

Debra is on the floor, stifling her tears, putting things back in

her purse.  John stares coldly out the window.

Debra rises, facing him scornfully.

Debra storms off.  John bores holes into her with his eyes.

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (SAME)

Tim lifts Danny into the back seat of Beth's convertible VW Bug --

plastered with "Greenpeace" and "This is Your Brain on Drugs" bumper

stickers.  Kara and Beth in front.

Pulling away from the curb, Beth honks at MRS. BLANKENSHIP, at least

80, owner of the student boarding house across the street.

The old woman just stares forward.  A gardem hose in hand as she

waters a garden of long-dead flowers.

Kara shields her eyes, distracted, looking up at the old Victorian

house.

KARA'S P.O.V.

Beth drives down a shady, tree-lined avenue, unaware of the white

van that is following them.

Tim leans forward, ravaging Beth's neck.

Suddenly the van ROARS by and cuts them off.  Beth lays on the

HORN.  Slams on the brakes.  Narrowly avoiding a collision.

Suddenly the van swerves around to face the VW head on.  For a

breathless moment the van and the VW sit at opposite ends of the

intersection.  Idling.  A tense stand-off.

Kara strains to get a look at the van's driver.  A momentary glimpse

of a pale white face behind the wheel.

Danny sits frozen in the back seat.  Suddenly the van shoots

forward, tires SCREAMING.  Startled GASPS.  The van turns off

sharply at the last second, SCREECHING down the next block.

Beth drives on, grimly determined.  Kara looks back at Danny.  He

returns her frightened gaze.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Tommy paces in his cramped apartment.  Dark circles under his eyes.

A remote control in hand, reviewing his recording of last night's

Harry Simms broadcast:

Frustrated, Tommy plays it again.  Adjusts the speed.  Tries to make

out something else in the b.g.  Jamie's voice comes through.  Slow.

Eerie.

Another VOICE, distant and distorted, filters up behind hers.

Tommy quickly stops the tape, throws on his worn leather bomber

jacket and bolts straight out the door.

MOVE IN on a pair of old newspaper clippings left on the floor.

Headlines read:  "November 5, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD STILL MISSING."

"November 19, 1989.  MYERS' NIECE PRESUMED DEAD."

INT. FORD EXPLORER / EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - MORNING

Tommy drives like a bat out of hell.  The "Greyhound" sign looms

ahead.

EXT. BUS DEPOT - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

The Explorer pulls up to the depot.  Tommy makes a beeline for the

entrance, cowboy boots splashing through rain puddles.

INT. BUS DEPOT (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy wades his way through a small crowd up to the ticket booth.  A

cross-eyed ATTENDANT greets him.

The Attendant checks her roster.

The Attendant eyes Tommy suspiciously as he enters the phone booth

in the corner.  Inside, he picks up the receiver and pretends to

dial a number.  Makes a cursory inspection.

TOMMY'S P.O.V. - PHONE BOOTH

On the floor, tiny droplets of what appear to be blood form a dotted

trail out the door.

TOMMY

follows the crimson path around the corner down a dim hallway,

stopping at the door marked "Ladies Room."  Checking first to make

sure the coast is clear, he steps furtively inside.

INT. LADIES' ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy walks past the sink.  Water drips into the filthy basin.  He

touches something inside, rubs it on his fingers -- blood.

Tommy whirls, startled by a sudden NOISE.  Muffled, indistinct.

Like CRYING.  Tommy gathers his courage as he slowly moves past the

long row of empty stalls.  The CRIES grow louder as he reaches the

final stall.  Jamie's escape route -- the window -- still wide open.

A hole in the wall behind the toilet.  Tommy reaches in, his hands

locking onto something.  Shock and amazement overcome him when he

lifts out a baby -- Jamie's baby.

The helpless newborn kicks and CRIES, the triangular symbol of Thorn

still caked in blood over his tiny torso.

SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

Someone partially opens the door, peering in from the hallway as

Tommy removes his jacket and bundles the baby inside.

BACK TO SCENE

A CREAK.  Tommy looks up.  The door slowly closes.

DEPOT HALLWAY

Tommy looks into shadowy stillness.  No one there.  Hiding the baby,

cradling his jacket, he hurries through the crowd and slinks out the

door marked ENTRANCE.

HELICOPTER P.O.V.

The SOUND of THWACKING BLADES as we FLY past a winding rural highway

over a dense grove of oak trees -- massive, ancient guardians of the

sprawling pumpkin patch that lies beyond.

As we circle the field, red-and-blue gum machines -- police cars,

fire engines and ambulances -- can be seen through gauzy veils of

rising BLACK SMOKE, dissipating with the strong WIND.

Charred in the ground, three intersecting lines stretch a hundred

feet across the plan to form a vivid geoglyphic.  The symbol of

Thorn.

INT. HELICOPTER (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis surveys the crash site with morbid fascination.  Wynn,

wearing headphones, shouts over the noise.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

The helicopter lands, windmilling gusts of ashen earth.  Loomis and

Wynn jump out, ducking past the spinning blades.

We FOLLOW them through EMERGENCY CREWS and a few CURIOSITY-SEEKERS

toward the center of attention.  A charred body is lifted from the

eviscerated, flame-blackened pikcup truck.

A few feet away, a team of PARAMEDICS work frantically around

another body, hidden among a cluster of pumpkins.

Loomis surges forward, at once halted by an armed DEPUTY.

Wynn flashes his badge.  The Deputy gives them a vexed glance.

Loomis's eyes flicker with nervous anticipation.  The Deputy

whispers something to SHERIFF JIM HOLDT, a brooding giant of a man

who dons a Stetson, holstered .44 Special and steel-toed boots that

give new meaning to the term "bad ass."

Even Loomis steps back as the sheriff lumbers toward them.

Holdt responds by stubbing out his Marlboro at Loomis's foot.

Holdt towers above him.

As usual, Loomis isn't easily intimidated.

Holdt fumes, ready to boil when --

Holdt and Loomis wade through the crush of paramedics, running

alongside the stretcher being whisked toward an ambulance.

A large knife extruding from a girl's stomach, packed under sterile

gauze.  Skin pasty-white.  Lips blue from shock.

EXT. HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE - PARKING LOT - MORNING

Beth's car pulls into the parking lot of a picturesque, impeccably

landscaped campus, speckled with colorful leaves.  A buzz of

excitement fills the autumn air.

Tim and Beth are surprised to see a small crowd -- camped out in

sleeping bags, holding "We Love to Hate Harry" signs.

Kara is nervously rifling through her enormous book bag.

Armed with her clipboard, Beth is assailed by her COMMITTEE.

Inundating her with QUESTIONS.

Tim and Beth are swept away.  A large sheet of paper falls out of

Kara's bag.  She picks it up, startled by what she sees.

KARA'S P.O.V. - THE DRAWING

Crayola figures of Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle Tim, and Mommy.  Knives

piercing them.  Blood dripping.  Mouths screaming.  A black shadow

figure bearing the word "THORN."

On the flip side, the drawing she found last night.  Danny's

scribbling of the odd triangular symbol.

BACK TO SCENE

The horrifying images send chills up Kara's spine.

Lost in grim reverie, Kara walks on, oblivious to the activity all

around her ...

A banner hangs from the eaves of the library:  "HADDONFIELD JR.

COLLEGE - FIRST ANNUAL HARVEST FAIRE."

Tim and Beth supervise as preparations for tonight's event get

underway.

STUDENT VOLUNTEERS nailing together booths, hanging decorations.  A

half-assembled Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, an ominous-looking

House of Horrors.

Rounding the corner onto the quiet path behind the library, Kara

suddenly finds herself alone.  WIND whips at her hair.  She glances

over her shoulder, as if sensing a presence.

KARA'S P.O.V.

No one is there.  Just the rustling of leaves on the ground.

ANGLE ON KARA

Walking off in the distance.  Suddenly the Shape steps shockingly

into FRAME, watching her disappear around the corner.

INT. HADDONFIELD MEMORIAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

Doors BLAST open.  The stretcher holding Jamie is pushed through,

Loomis right beside her.  Wynn follows, trying to stop him.  A

SHOCK-TRAUMA unit swarms in.  No time to lose.

DR. BONHAM, the ER resident, peels off the sheet, exposing a dark

sea of blood around the enormous knife still jutting from Jamie's

stomach.  Bonham stares, incredulous.

ORDERLIES move in.  Loomis won't release Jamie's hand.

HOSPITAL ENTRANCE / ADMITTANCE DESK

Pneumatic doors fly open.  Tommy bursts through, holding the baby in

his jacket.  PATIENTS and COPS everywhere.  He hones in on the NURSE

behind the admittance desk.

ADJACENT HALLWAY

Wynn and Loomis skirt past a line of SECURITY GUARDS.

The shrill sound of Wynn's beeper.  He clicks it.

Wynn disappears around the corner.  Loomis wanders off alone.

Loomis reacts, taken aback by the frantic young man bounding toward

him.

Loomis suddenly recognizes him.  It's been a very long time.

Loomis pulls Tommy aside into an empty alcove.

Tommy hesitates.  Loomis's eyes are drawn enigmatically to the

infant in Tommy's arms.

Loomis's face flls with horror.  Tommy sees the Admittance Nurse,

flanked by a pair of security guards, walking his way.

Tommy bolts toward the exit.  Loomis tries to stop him.

But he is gone.  A hand taps Loomis's shoulder; he reels.  Wynn.

Darkness fills Loomis's countenance as we

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - DAY

We peer OVER THE SHOULDER of the Shape, standing across the street.

Watching Debra, in jeans and a rumpled sweatshirt, collecting

left-over painting supplies from the front porch.

Debra starts to open the CREAKY screen door when she notices the axe

John had used earlier.  Clumsily picks it up and slides it through

the top of the crate she is holding.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (CONTINUOUS)

Laden with her heavy load, Debra nudges the door shut with her

foot.  Then crosses to another door -- the cellar door.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Debra, silhouetted at the top of the stairs, hits a light switch; a

naked bulb springs to life.  Slowly she descends the rickety

staircase.

The basement, pitch dark save for a spear of sunlight shooting

through an elevated window, is overrun with cobwebs, rusted tools

and broken bicycle parts.  A clunker of a washing machine RATTLES in

the corner.

Debra makes space for the crate in a storage cabinet.  Suddenly the

washing machine stops.  Nonplissed, she moves toward it.  Lifts the

lid.  The bed sheets inside are sopping wet.

Opening the electrical fuse box, she flicks a switch back and forth

a few times -- but the washing machine doesn't respond.

Frustrated, Debra looks down to see a large puddle of water forming

on the floor.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (SAME)

Debra hauls a laundry basket upstairs, filled with wet sheets.  She

turns, startled.  The front door is standing wide open.

Just as she goes to shut it, a man steps out from the living room

behind her.  She gasps, dropping the basket; it's Loomis.

Debra shudders at the sight of the beguiling, wide-eyed man.

Debra steps aside as Loomis walks in right past her.  Holding a

valuminous file bearing the name "MICHAEL AUDREY MYERS."

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND of JANGLING KEYS.  A door UNLOCKING.  Tommy scrambles in,

the baby iin one arm, a bag of groceries under the other.

With a single swipe, he clears away the junk on his futin, then

carefully lays down the CRYING infant.  He digs through the bag:

Baby Wipes.  Diapers.  Formula.  Bottles.

Quickly he scans the directions on the formula.  Pours the liquid

into a bottle, nukes it in the microwave, then returns to the

business at hand.

Tommy grimaces at the mess inside his leather bomber.  The baby

CRIES harder.

Armed with Baby Wipe and a diaper, Tommy goes to work.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)

Mrs. Blankenship traverses the hall outside Tommy's apartment.  The

baby's CRIES; Tommy's GROSSED-OUT GROANS can clearly be heard.  But

the old woman keeps walking, oblivious to it all.

TOMMY'S APARTMENT (SAME)

Tommy finishes securing the diaper.  The baby in his arms, he tests

the formula's temperature and feeds him.  The infant sucks

voraciously.  The crying stops.  Tommy rocks him gently.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM (SAME)

Loomis, setting out the case file on Michael Myers -- gruesome

photographs of the murder scenes -- has Debra's undivided attention.

INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM (SAME)

Kara sits in the front row of a classrooom as a PROFESSOR drones

on.  He looks at Kara, something frightening in his gaze.  Watching

as her pen glides dreamily over her notebook.

KARA'S P.O.V. - NOTEBOOK

An entire page of scribbled triangles.  The mark of Thorn.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND - DAY

A group of KIDS engaged in a game of Pogs -- two opponents facing

off, slamming down the colored discs.  Lunch money on the ground.

High stakes indeed.

IAN, a lunkish 5th grader, is clearly the man to be reckoned with.

The other kids make way as Danny takes the empty spot on the

tetherball court, sitting face-to-face with the inplacable Ian.

Danny says nothign as he places his bet and slams the stack of

Pogs.  Ian glowers.  Easy money.  The showdown begins.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - HALLWAY / KARA'S ROOM

Loomis vivdly reenacts the nightmare as Debra shows him upstairs.

INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY

Dr. Bonham and his team surround Jamie, anesthetized on the

operating table, her condition weak but stable.

Blood flows from the gaping wound in her abdomen.  Slowly,

painstakingly, the knife is extracted.

A NURSE takes a sample of a thick, viscous fluid from beneath

Jamie's gown and holds it up to the light for the doctor.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY (SAME)

Danny wins another round.  His till growing.  More kids gather to

watch.  Ian is losing his cool, determined to save face.

Danny pushes over the stack, nothing incisive in his manner.  Ian

retorts, angrily slamming his Pogs.

Ian trumps Danny's hand and smiles haughtily.  The low, whispering

VOICE which only Danny can hear RUMBLES in his mind.

Danny stares blankly across the playground.

DANNY'S P.O.V.

The white van is parked across the street.  A tall figure in black

stands beside it, watching Danny.  The Stranger!

INT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

Kara sits glued behind a computer monitor, the glow of the screen

reflected in her reading glasses.

KARA'S P.O.V.

A litany of topics scroll up the screen.  Kara punches in one of

them.  Card catalog entry reads:  "Thorn:  The Devil's Rune."

EXT. PLAYGROUND (SAME)

Spellbound, Danny slams down the winning Pog.  Methodically, he

dumps the money in his Halloween bag and begins to walk away.

Ian sees red.  Written across Danny's last Pog:  "DIE, FAT ASS."

Ian goes berserk, leaping out at Danny like an enraged lion.  The

kids cheer him on as a full-fledged playground brawl ensues.

Danny breaks away.  Runs.  With an amazing burst of strength, he

swings a tetherball.  Th ball CRACKS Ian right between his eyes,

laying the bully flat on his ass.

INT. MYERS HOUSE (SAME)

Debra leads Loomis to the front door, her face clouded with fear.

Loomis grips her hand reassuringly, then heads out the door.  Debra

turns the deadbolt, securing it with the chain lock.  She collapses

against the wall, tears of horror in her eyes.

EXT. PLAYGROUND / GATE (SAME)

A TEACHER blows a WHISTLE, wading through the screaming, cheering

kids as Danny pummels Ian brutally with his fist.

The teacher helps Ian out of the fray, eyes warbling, nose and mouth

bleeding.  Danny takes off running toward the gate.

Suddenly he barrels into the outstretched hands of a towering

shape.  Danny looks up in shock at a stone-faced man -- Tommy!

INT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

MOVING with Kara through long rows of books -- a veritable labyrinth

of knowledge.  She comes down a deserted aisle, searching.  Her eyes

spotting what she is looking for.

She pulls out an old, dusty tome and begins flipping through its

pages.

As she reads we SEE the cover:  "Runes and Ancient Black Magic."

EXT. STRODE REALTY - DAY

ESTABLISHING.  A modest, one-story building located in the older

business section of town.  Cheap Halloween decorations hang in the

windows.  An "OPEN" sign on the front door.

MOANS of ecstasy resound along the street, attracting the attention

of the mid-day passerby.

The WKNB station van rolls by; another Harry Simms plug.  Some

people laugh.  Others wince in disgust.

INT. STRODE REALTY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

A sparesely-furnished office screaming for renovation.  Business is

obviously slow.  John rattles a jammed file cabinet, then kicks it

in a fit of angry frustration before answering the incessantly

RINGING phone.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN

Debra on the other end.  Tears reddening her cheeks.

INTERCUT their conversation.

John stiffens, slowly sits down behind his desk.

A CLICK as the line suddenly goes DEAD.

John scowls, opens his lower desk drawer, produces a bottle of JD

and a small glass.  He blows off dust and begins to pour.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - UPSTAIRS (SAME)

CAMERA FOLLOWS Debra in frantic flight from bedroom to bedroom,

throwing open closets and drawers, filling a suitcase with a night's

worth of clothes for her family.  She accidentally knocks a family

portrait off a bureau.  Glass SHATTERS.

FOYER / LIVING ROOM

Debra drags the suitcase downstairs.  Lets out a horrified gasp.

The crate she had previously stored in the cellar is now sitting in

the center of the hallway ...

The axe that had been sticking out of it earlier is now missing!

The telephone RINGS.  Eyes riveted to the crate, Debra backs away

down the hall.  Into the living room.  Picks up the phone.

A startling, intensely whispering VOICE:

Debra slams down the phone.  Terror paralyzing her.

MUFFLED, HEAVY BREATHING fills the room.

Debra races back into the foyer and struggles with the door.  In her

panic, she can't release the chain lock.

She turns to see the Shape standing right behind her!  Debra

SCREAMS.  Breaks for the hall.  Through the kitchen.  Flings open

the back door.

EXT. BACK YARD - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Debra half-runs, half-stumbles through the endless rows of

clotheslines.  White sheets twist around her like ghosts in the

blustering WIND.  She tosses them aside, one after the other.

Approaching the driveway.  Safety up ahead.

Whipping aside the last sheet, Debra finds herself staring into the

Shape's death mask.  Her eyes bug.  Too late to scream.  The missing

axe swings at her like a sledge hammer.  Blood paints the sheets red

as we

EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DUSK

Laden with her book bag, Kara exits the library and heads across the

campus green.  All around her, the sights and sounds of the

impending carnival come to life.

Rides assembled.  Paper witches hang from broomsticks.  Goblins lurk

behind syrofoam gravestones.

Kara waves at Beth in the distance, making last-minute

preparations.  Student volunteers scurrying in every which

direction.  Donning costumes.

A ducking for apples booth.  Homebaked goodies set out on picnic

tables.  Long rows of pumpkins lined up for a jack-o'-lantern

carving contest.

The centerpiece of all this is a huge, magnificently decorated

HALLOWEEN TREE.  Tim and a gaggle of WORKERS stream up ladders,

stringing lights, hoisting up colorful bunting filled with mounds of

candy.

As Kara walks along, her hair being tossed about in the brisk WIND,

she becomes aware of the magical, almost out of time quality that

seems to hang in the air.

EXT. STREET (SAME)

Kara walks past the crows of "Harry-ites" gathered outside the

campus gates, now extending half-way around the block.

The WKNB van rolls by, exhorting the crowd with the voice of the man

they've all come to see:

Kara walks on, smiling to herself as the crowd bursts into gales of

wild, exuberant CHEERS.

EXT. LAMPKIN LANE / MYERS HOUSE - DUSK

The setting sun glows behind the trees, casting long shadows as Kara

rounds the corner onto her street.

KIDS already pouring out of their homes, some accompanied by

PARENTS, others joining groups of friends.

Kara ambles up the walk of the Myers house, shoes clapping up the

porch steps as she digs the keys out of her overstuffed bag.

Unbolting the door, she finds that it's secured with the

chain-lock.  Kara pushes on it, calling inside.

No response.  Puzzled, she steps off the porch and makes her way

around the side of the house, CAMERA FOLLOWING as she peers into the

windows along the way.

BACK YARD (CONTINUOUS)

Kara walks along the billowing clotheslines, passing the blank spot

where the blood-stained sheets were -- and are no longer.

She reaches the back door.  Standing ajar.

Casting one last glance across the yard, she steps inside.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (SAME)

Everything in its proper place.  Kara drops her heavy bag on the

kitchen table and proceeds down the hall.

LIVING ROOM / FOYER - DUSK INTO NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

The room is quickly falling into darkness.  The eeriness almost

palpable.  Kara advances into the living room, eyes roaming.

Nothing.  Kara moves into the foyer.  Her mother's suitcase still

sitting there.  Beyond, the cellar door stands wide open.  Kara

moves toward it, peering into blackness.

A sudden CRASH from upstairs.  Kara jerks the door closed and looks

up the deeply-shadowed staircase.

A muffled ROAR.  Kara mounts the staircase.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Kara reaches the second floor landing and moves slowly toward the

door at the end of the hall.  Danny's room.  An orange glow flickers

around the edges of the closed door.

KARA'S P.O.V.

Her hand grabs the doorknob, turns it.  The door swings open.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Someone sitting on the edge of Danny's bed.  A man.  His back

turned.  Dinosaurs ROAR on Sega Genesis.  Danny squatting on the

floor, engrossed in his game.

Kara stares at the intruder in horrified disbelief.

The man watching over Danny turns toward Kara.  It's Tommy.

Panicked, Kara makes a wall of herself between Tommy and Danny.  The

little boy isn't the least bit fazed.

Tommy backs off a tick, calmly trying to explain.

Danny finally looks up, exasperated.

One look at Danny's black eye and Kara goes ballistic.

Kara starts to drag Danny away by the arm.  He resists angrily.

Kara sees Tommy hunkering down in the corner, lifting something out

of a crate -- a makeship crib.  He turns, his expression very

grave.  Holding the baby.

Kara's face is a melange of wonder and fear as we

INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Jamie lies comatose, ensconced in the dim GLOW of monitors.

Sustained by I.V.s and a breathing apparatus.

MOVE IN on Jamie.  EKG registers rapid heartbeat.  MOVE IN TIGHT on

her eyes, darting beneath closed lids.

INT. CORRIDOR - DISTORTED VISION (DREAM SEQUENCE)

Blood-chilling SCREAMS as we MOVE rapidly through a BLINDING TUNNEL

OF LIGHT.  Blurred, indistinct images.  FIGURES wearing long white

coats flash along sterile walls.

As we BLAST around corners, we realize we are seeing from the P.O.V.

of a girl being pushed forward on a gurney.  It is Jamie.

Her arm injected with a sedative.  Eyes lolling.  Succumbing.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - MOVING (DREAM SEQUENCE)

Even more DISTORTED now, images swirling at random.  Cold, staring

FACES.  Flashing lights on a wall panel:  "3-2-1-B" -- an elevator.

Going down.  Down.  Beneath the basement level.

The doors open.  The gurney SLAMS out into DARKNESS.  VOICES ECHO.

Lighted torches flicker on craggy walls.

SHAPE'S P.O.V.

Pacing back and forth behind iron bars, agitated, disturbed.  SEEING

Jamie strapped to a table.  Surrounded by robed figures.  CHANTING.

Weakly, Jamie reaches out toward the cell.

Suddenly a long SHADOW fills the room.  The P.O.V. becomes more

restless as the Stranger glides toward Jamie and disrobes.  The

figures close the circle.  Jamie SCREAMS in terror.

The Shape's hands SLAM violently against the iron bars, a horrific

SHUDDER of metal as we

INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT (SAME)

Jamie's eyes flash open!  A dark shadow fills the room.  The

Stranger descends on her!

Gloved hand covers Jamie's mouth.  A switchblade FLICKS open.

The glinting blade SLASHES across Jamie's throat, cutting off her

soundless scream!

Then the Stranger flows out of the room.  Spurs CLANKING.  Like a

thief in the night.  The shrill sound of a BEEPER going off as we

EXT. HADDONFIELD STREETS - NIGHT - SERIES OF SHOTS

The dark blanket of night envelops the little town.  The LIGHTS of

the fair twinkle in the distance, bright and beckoning.

Families -- men, women and children alike -- turn out from their

homes wearing COSTUMES, joining a growing procession along the

peaceful streets of Haddonfield.

A large group of PROTESTORS carry PICKET SIGNS in front of the

campus gates.  Rallying against the celebration.

Haddonfield's finest out in full force, squad cars sweeping

alongside a black STRETCH LIMO as it makes its way through town.

Tinted windows make it impossible to see inside.

EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT / HARVEST FAIR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Tim and Beth, standouts as punk versions of Frankenstein and his

bride, stride purposefully toward the fair entrance.  Beth is a

jumble of nerves as she runs down her checklist of events.

The limo crawls into the parking lot.  A stampede of overzealous

FANS surge past them.

Tim and Beth move into the fair, with all its noise and colorful

movement.

ANOTHER ANGLE

KIDS waving signs and T-shirts.  Throwing themselves at the

windows.  Frenzied CLAMORING.  Harry-mania abound.

The WKNB van parks parallel to the steps of the library, adorned

with HAREM GIRLS and a large golden throne.  The side door opens.  A

red carpet is rolled out.

A tall, imposing figure emerges from the van and walks up the

steps.  Spurs CLANKING on black boots.  "Jesse James" style duster.

Hat cocked slightly.

The crowd turns in a mass of confusion.  Standing above them, waving

from a microphone, is HARRY.  Dark sunglasses.  Gaunt, glacial

features and an outrageous mane of black hair.

Suddenly Harry throws open his duster -- flashing them -- revealing

that he has nothing on beneath except his boots and a pair of bright

orange boxer shorts that say "HAPPY HALLOWEEN."

The kids go insane.

ANGLE ON LOOMIS

Making his way through the teeming crowd.  Walkie-talkie in hand.

The helicopter zooms overhead.  Wynn's voice squawks over garbled

RADIO CHATTER.  Conducting a surveillance by air.

Suddenly Loomis is waylaid by a giant wall of a man -- Sheriff

Holdt.  Loomis meets his fiery gaze.

Loomis tears off.  Holdt stares brazenly, throwing down his

cigarette.  Crushes it under his boot and slowly follows him.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY - NIGHT

Carrying the CRYING baby, Tommy leads Kara and Danny into the lobby

of the vintage boarding home.  Polished wood.  Framed old

paintings.  Wall-to-wall Tiffany lamps.

Mrs. Blankenship sits behind the front desk, oblivious to the

GRINDING and SCREAMING on the television as "The Texas Chain Saw

Massacre" reaches its horrific climax on the annual Horrorthon.

As usual, the senile old woman doesn't reply.

Tommy ushers Kara and Danny up the stairs.  Mrs. Blankenship stares

at the boy -- the kind of stare that would send most kids running

for their moms.  But Danny is undaunted.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (CONTINUOUS)

The door opens.  Kara is repulsed by the sight of Tommy's musty,

unkempt apartment.

Tommy adjusts the blinds on the window looking out on the Myers

house.

Kara glares, reminded of last night.

Tommy flashes a newspaper article in front of her.  One we've seen

eariler:  "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OF ALIVE?"

The baby's SCREAMS are verging on overload.  Tommy dashes to the

recessed kitchen area and heats up another bottle.

As Kara reads, Danny tugs at his mother's blouse.

Danny plods off.  Kara hands Tommy a nipple for the bottle.  Their

eyes lock for a beat.  He takes it.

Kara looks on as Tommy attempts to feed the baby.  Despite his

clumsiness, she's undeniably moved.

Behind them, Danny's imagination kicks into high gear as he drives a

Power Ranger over an invisible race track.  On the floor.  Across

the windowsill.  Glancing across the street.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE

Standing below on the front lawn is the Shape, silhouetted under a

moonlit tree.  Looking right at Danny.

BACK TO SCENE

Danny backs away, terrified.  Tommy and Kara are too concerned with

the baby to notice.

Tommy gingerly hands the baby over to her.  Instantaneously, Kyle's

CRIES subside.

For one fleeting moment, Tommy and Kara find themselves smiling at

one another.  Unaware as Danny glides silently out the door.

Tommy's expression darkens once again.  A man possessed.

Tommy opens the baby's quilt, revealing the blood mark smeared over

his torso.  Kara's face registers terrified recognition.

INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM / HALLWAY - NIGHT

POLICE on the scene.  A crying NURSE gives a statement.  A CRIME

SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER snapps photographs as Jamie's bloody corpse is

covered over with a white sheet.

Loomis stands frozen in horror.  Tears in his eyes.

He spins, pouncing on Sheriff Holdt.

Wynn restrains him.  Pulls him away.  The sheriff doesn't budge.

Wynn ushers Loomis out of the room.  Holdt stares apathetically.

HALLWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn tries to calm Loomis down.  Jamie's doctor approaches.

Jamie's covered body is wheeled out past them.  Loomis regards Wynn

with a look of abject fear.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (SAME)

CLOSE ON a chapter heading.  "Thorn - The Devil's Rune."  Beneath

it, a bold depiction of the familiar Thorn triangle.

PULL BACK to REVEAL Tommy poring over the old library book.  Kara

paces, rocking the baby, feeding him with the bottle.

Tommy jumps up, frantically moving around the apartment, collecting

his jacket, his keys -- a gun.

An ominous CLICK as Tommy loads a cartridge into his gun.  He bolts

toward the door.  Finds it standing wide open.  Kara freezes,

noticing for the first time that Danny is missing.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS)

Kara and Tommy barrel downstairs, searching frantically.

They find Mrs. Blankenship and Danny sitting side by side, watching

the Horrorthon.  A bowl of popcorn between them.

Danny looks at her.  A blank, hollow stare.  The old woman's eyes

glitter madly.

Tommy throws on his jacket and opens the front door.

Kara watches fearfully as Tommy heads out the door.  Leaving her

alone with the children.

EXT. HOUSES / STREET - NIGHT

Wind MOANS.  Dead leaves blow across the WINDY lane as Tommy flies

down the path of the Blankenship house and hops into his Explorer.

The Shape suddenly RISES INTO FRAME.  Watching him peel off down the

block.  Taillights disappearing.

A moment later, another car rambles up the street, swerving

erratically into the driveway of the Myers house.

The Shape watches.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

The car parks.  Sits in silence.  Suddenly the driver's side door

opens, emblazoned with the "Strode Realty" emblem.

John spills out, collar unbuttoned, tie dangling.  Picking himself

up, he staggers out of the garage.  Laughing.  Singing.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

FOLLOW John's circuitous route across the front lawn, stumbling over

one of Danny's toys on his way up the porch steps.

John fumbles wth his key, estimates the location of the lock.  He

turns the knob -- but the door's jammed.  Chain-locked.

John slams his weight against the door.  It doesn't budge.

Grumbling, John totters off the porch, trying to hold himself

steady.  Skirting along the side of the house.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS)

John sways in through the back door and flicks on a light.  Strains

for lucidity.  No one in the kitchen.

No answer.  John shrugs and moves to the stove.  Opens the lid on a

pasta cooker.  Nothing inside.

Frustrated, John opens the freezer and removes a frozen dinner.

Tears open the box and pops it in the microwave.  Then he flounders

down the dark alley, knocking picture frames awry.

LIVING ROOM / FOYER

Darkness, save for a glowing jack-o'-lantern.  John stands there,

listing.  Bewildered.

Then he switches on a lamp, kicks off his shoes and crashes onto his

lumpy old recliner.

Still no reply.  John sneers, flicks on the television with the

remote control and settles back into his chair.

INSERT - TELEVISION

A scene from another horror movie.  A boy shreds his pumpkin mask as

a mass of beetles and snakes pour out of his skull.

BACK TO SCENE

Disgusted, he switches channels to the local NEWS.  A shrill BEEP

from the kitchen startles him.  The microwave.

KITCHEN

John waddles to a drawer and removes a set of utensils.  Then he

reaches for the microwave, opens it.  But his dinner is gone.

Spinning around, he sees the piping hot entree already sitting out

on the kitchen table.  John double-takes, mentally retracing his

steps.  Shrugs.

FOLLOW JOHN

as he picks up his tray and plods back down the hall.  Suddenly he

trips over something -- the suitcase Debra had packed earlier,

sitting smack-dead in the center of the hall.

LIVING ROOM

John settles back into his chair and begins to eat ravenously.

SCREAMS from the television.  He reacts.

INSERT - TELEVISION

Someone has switched it back to the horror movie.  A

COMPUTER-GENERATED PUMPKIN causes more masked heads to EXPLODE.

BACK TO SCENE

John shakes the remote.  Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a

shadowy figure darting by in the darkened foyer.

John rises, about to go for him when suddenly the power cuts out --

and the entire house is plunged into blackness.

John pulls a rechargeable flashlight from the wall and goes to the

cellar door.  It stands open.  An invitation to enter.

With that, John steps down into the basement.

INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)

John tentatively descends the stairs.  Barefoot.  The flashlight

beam preceding his every step.  A RUMBLING below.

The cellar is lit only by a shaft of moonlight cutting through the

single dusty window.  John probes around, shining the flashlight

over cobwebs, boxes -- the puddle of water at his feet.  Now

flooding the entire floor.

John SLOSHES through the water toward the washing machine -- which

is running at full tact.

He opens the washer lid and lifts out a water-logged sheet.  It

drips red onto the white appliance -- blood.

John backs away, loses his footing, and slips in the water --

landing right at the Shape's feet.  John SCREAMS as the Shape grabs

him by the neck, lifts him off the floor with one hand, then carries

him across the basement and SLAMS him brutally against the open fuse

box.

The Shape's free hand lifts an enormous butcher knife.  A loud WHAP

as it's driven to the hilt into John's chest, through the fuse box.

Sparks wain from the wall.  Electricity courses through John's

writing body.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE (SAME)

Lights flash on and off in the windows.  Suddenly the entire house

is plunged into darkness.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR (SAME)

John's toes curl.  The skin around where the knife penetrates

FRIES.  The Shape steps back, head tilted, BREATHING steadily,

curiously observing John's hanging, lifeless body.

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT

Tommy grabs the ticket he's just paid for, hands it to an ATTENDANT

and moves through the turnstiles amid a steady stream of REVELLERS.

Loud MUSIC, the aroma of apple cider and pumpkin pie fills the air.

Boots selling food and crafts.  Children carving jack-o'-lanterns.

Parents beaming with pride.

Trendy co-eds playing games.  Ducking for apples.  Shooting

pumpkin-faced balloons with water pistols.

EXT. LIBRARY STEPS

Tim and Beth sit on either side of Harry as he interviews them

during a live BROADCAST.  A large crowd gathered below.

Beth's rousing speech is met by gales of enthusiastic CHEERS.

EXT. HADDONFIELD STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

The distant SOUNDS of the celebration are carried on the wings of

the WIND.  Howling through dark, empty streets.  Rows of deserted

houses.  Not a soul in sight.  Preternatural stillness.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT

Kara looks nervously out a window, then walks into the parlor where

she finds Danny sitting in the dark, glued to the Horrorthon.

Flames CRACKLE in the fireplace, casting weird shadows.

Mrs. Blankenship sits in a wooden rocker, cradling the infant,

humming a lullaby.

If we look closely enough, behind her in the window we can see the

hazy shadow of the Shape looking in.

The old woman doesn't seem to hear her.  Lost in her own world.

Mrs. Blankenship looks up sharply, startling Kara.

Kara stares at her, numbed.  She gazes over at Danny, his eyes

riveted  -- not to the TV screen.  Looking past it.  Across the

street at the Myers house.  The haunting VOICE whispers to him.

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT

Tim and Beth ride high atop the Ferris wheel.  Their smiling faces

aglow in a dizzying whirlwind of LIGHTS.  DARK CLOUDS are gathering

in the sky, covering the moon and stars.  A light RAIN begins to

fall.

ANGLE ON TOMMY

Walking, searching, hunting.  Past a large tent where children are

gathering.  A sign reads:  COSTUME PAGEANT.

Tommy reacts to a terrified SCREAM.  Just a couple of teenage BOYS

pulling an innocuously fightened GIRL onto another ride.

THE STRANGER

walks steadily past the bright lights of the Ferris wheel.

TOMMY

pushes through a dense crowd.  Suddenly he bumps shoulders with the

Stranger.  More people pass.  There was something very sinister

about that man.

Tommy turns to look again, eyes widening in terror.

TOMMY'S P.O.V. - STRANGER'S WRIST

Branded with the mark of Thorn!

TOMMY

removes his gun.  Flows through the crowd like a vengeful wraith.

People see the gun in his hand and back away.  Tommy surges

forward.  The Stranger walks faster.  Gaining ground.  Toward the

Halloween tree.

WORKERS hauling wheelbarrows loaded with jack-o'-lanterns cross his

path.  Tommy stumbles, pumpkins spilling out all around him.

The Stranger is getting away!  Tommy picks himself up, raises the

gun and begins FIRING shots into the air.  People SCREAM, scattering

like insects, ducking for cover.

Tommy races through the horrified crowd.  The Stranger keeps moving,

never once looking back.

Suddenly SIRENS.  Squad cars converge.  Sheriff Holdt and a slew of

OFFICERS surround Tommy.  Weapons trained.

Tommy drops the gun.  Puts his arms up in surrender.  The cops swarm

in, taking him.

ANGLE ON FERRIS WHEEL

Beth and Tim exit the ride and follow the crowd toward the flashing

LIGHTS of the police cruisers.

Beth is stunned to see Tommy being searched spread-eagle over the

sheriff's car.

She brushes against Tim's crotch and saunters away.  Tim glances

back at Tommy, then follows her like a hungry puppy.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kara rushes Danny and the baby inside.  The old spinster close at

her heels.  Releasing her dark secret.

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT (SAME)

The Stranger glides unnoticed among a large crowd gathered for the

lighting of the Halloween tree.  People putting up umbrellas.  A

STORM fast approaching.

Hundreds of anxious kids stand beneath the oak tree with open bags

and pillow cases, waiting for the candy to drop on them.

STALKING P.O.V

MOVING behind the tree where a long-haired figure stands in the

darkness.  Waiting to make a presentation.

HARRY

turns, sensing a presence.  A knife shoots out of the darkness,

jabbing him right between the legs.

TOMMY

is shoved into the back of the squad car.  Suddenly Loomis appears.

Prevailing upon the sheriff.

Tommy looks out, stunned.

HARRY

The knife is lifted straight up, splitting his torso in two, eyes

bugging with shock.  He slumps to the ground in a huge pool of

blood.

TOMMY AND LOOMIS

The sheriff uncuffs Tommy and shoves him out of the car.

Loomis begins to usher Tommy through the gaping crowd.

Tommy is prodded forward by Loomis's .357.

They move swiftly through the gaping crowd.

ANGLE ON TREE

A growing murmur of concern spreads.  "Where's Harry?"  The children are

becoming impatient, and the impending STORM isn't doing much to calm

anyone's nerves.  Harry's people are at a loss to explain their star's

whereabouts.

ANGLE ON LOOMIS AND TOMMY

On the fringes of the crowd.  Walking away.

"Oohs" and "ahhs" as the tree suddenly comes to life with thousands of

orange lights.  From the boughs of the tree, ropes are pulled.  Bunting

tears open, dropping hails of CANDY on the SHRIEKING kids.

Tommy glances back.  His eyes drawn to something.  Grotesque and misshapen.  In the

tree.

ANGLE ON TREE

Kids of all ages scurry around the stage, laughing and screaming as a

rainbow of candy RAINS down on them.  Diving for it.  Fighting over it.

Scooping it up in big handfuls.

ANGLE ON TOMMY AND LOOMIS

Tommy instantly breaks away and tears back through the crowd.

Loomis goes for him.  Sheriff Holdt sees what is happening and

flies toward them in pursuit.

ANGLE ON TREE

A BALLERINA looks down at her white pillow case in horrified

astonishment.  Her hands painted red as she reaches inside.  All

of her candy is covered with blood!

The other kids back away in revulsion -- the entire stage begins

to drip with blood!

The adults don't seem to notice what is happening, more concerned

with the sudden burst of POURING RAIN.

Tommy pushes his way through the crowd, SCREAMING.

Sheriff Holdt tries to intercept Tommy just as he leaps up onto

the stage, pushing kids out of the way.

Parents' faces register shock when they see their children running

toward them, SCREAMING hysterically, soaked with blood.

Loomis sees what Tommy sees.  Words cannot convey the horror in his

eyes.

Just then, a BOLT OF LIGHTNING ignites the tree.  SPARKS flash.

Tiny pumpkin lights EXPLODE in a startling chain reaction.

Tommy helps the last of the kids off the stage when something falls

from the gnarled branches:  a dangling, rotating, wrapped-up thing.

The mutilated remains of Harry Simms!

Horrified, Tommy dashes headlong off the stage.  Runs with Loomis

with the trampling crowd.

Struck dumb with terror, Holdt looks out upon the mass destruction.

The bloody corpse hanging from the tree.  People running, SCREAMING,

carrying their children toward the exits.

EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT (SAME)

Bumper to bumper cars.  Horns BLARING.  Women SCREAMING.  Men SHOUTING.

Children CRYING.  Pandemonium.

Loomis and Tommy appear out of this jumble of confusion.  More people

running along the sidewalks.

A car SCREECHES to a halt as Tommy barrels across the street.  Loomis

right behind him.  Running toward home.

Once again, terror reigns in Haddonfield, Illinois.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kara shivers as she curls up beside Danny on the futon, holding the

sleeping baby close at her bosom.  THUNDER rattles the old house.

Kara stands up and goes to the window, looking out into the

pouring RAIN.

KARA'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE

Dark and foreboding.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Beth's car parked in

front.

ANGLE ON KARA

She stares at the car, puzzled.  Quickly she moves away from the

window, heads out the door.

HALLWAY

She KNOCKS loudly on the door across the hall.  A sign that reads:

"Beth's Place."

She knocks again.  No response.  Another CLAP OF THUNDER.  Kara

shudders, quickly returns to Tommy's apartment and locks the door.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (CONTINUOUS)

Sounds of PASSION as we FOLLOW a trail of hastily-discarded costume

pieces across the darkened foyer.  Tim and Beth are on the stairs,

half-naked, kissing fervently.

Tim nuzzles his face in Beth's chest.  She's feeling apprehensive.

Laughing, they heard up the stairs, kissing, fondling each other.

Slowly we PULL BACK into the foyer.  THUNDER and LIGHTNING CLASH,

revealing the Shape, knife held at ready.  Watching.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (SAME)

She picks up the cordless phone, switches on and dials her home

number.  We HEAR the phone RINGING on the other end.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Beth collapses with Tim onto Kara's bed.  The PHONE RINGS.  Tim

ignores it, consumed by passion.  Beth sits up nervously.

Frustrated, Tim jumps off the bed and stomps into the bathroom,

taking a candle with him.

Tim slams the door.  Beth deliberates her move, then goes to pick

up the phone.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara is frantic.  Looking out the window at the Myers house.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM (SAME)

BATHROOM - SHOWER (CONTINUOUS)

A lighted candle flickers.  Tim waits for the running shower to

warm up as he does a bare-ass jig over to the sink.

Rinsing off his tooth brush, he elbows out a circle of steam from

the mirror.  He gasps.  The Shape is standing right behind him!

Before he can react, Tim's head is yanked backwards.  The chilling

SNAP of his neck is punctuated by a CRASH OF THUNDER.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara can SEE Beth on the phone.  Sitting by the window.

Unnoticed by Kara, Danny rises and crosses the room.  Drawn toward

the door by the irascible voice.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM

Beth shifts nervously, looking out across the way at Kara.

THUNDER drowns out the sound of the bathroom door CREAKING open.  The

Shape advances.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara's mouth suddenly drops open.  Her mind snaps into sensory overload.

She can see the Shape walking up behind Beth!  Raising a gleaming

butcher knife!

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM

Beth drops the phone, eyes bulging as the Shape plunges the knife

into her back.  She falls, CRASHING against the vanity.

Beth SCREAMS unholy terror.  But the Shape isn't through.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara stands frozen in pure horror, hearing and seeing her friend's

vicious murder.

Her eyes shoot down.  A little blond-haired boy is walking steadily

across the street toward the Myers house.

No, it can't be true.  Kara wheels around.  Danny is gone.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW

Danny can be seen below walking toward the house as Beth's

blood-gurgling SCREAMS fill the room.  The knife repeatedly,

mercilessly SLASHING down at her.

EXT. STREET / MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Kara bolts out of the Blankenship house and races across the street,

chasing after Danny through RAIN and LIGHTNING.

KARA'S P.O.V. - FOLLOWING DANNY

He glides up the porch steps and slips through the front door of the

Myers house.  Disappearing inside.

KARA

shoots across the lawn.  Up the porch steps.  Right behind him.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER

Kara dives through the front door.  THUNDER shatters the house.

Everything is frighteningly dark.  Shockingly quiet.

Inch by inch, she makes her way inside.  Eyes wide.  Savage.

Shaking uncontrollably.  A CRASHING SOUND behind her.  She jumps out

of her skin.  Just the door SLAMMING shut in the WIND.

She advances into the hall.  Old floorboards CREAK beneath her feet.

SOUNDS up ahead.  FOOTSTEPS.

Kara looks up.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Danny is nearing the top of the

stairs!

Instinct propels her up the stairs after him.  Then suddenly she stops

dead.  Reason taking over.  And she turns back.

Picks up a fireplace poker sitting in the corner.  Then she heads back

up the stairs.  Mind-blown with horror.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kara reaches the top of the staircase, looking down the dark hallway.

Summoning all of her courage, she moves forward.

Suddenly Danny darts out from the adjacent hall and disappears inside

his bedroom -- a fleeting, ghostly image.  Kara startles.  Follows him

inside.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Danny stands in a corner.  LIGHTNING illuminates his toy dinosaurs.

Kara goes to him, takes his hand.  He resists her.

She picks him up, carries him toward the door.  LUMBERING FOOTSTEPS.

Kara stands paralyzed in the doorway as the Shape stalks down the hall.

Eyes probing.  Walking right past them.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Kara slips silently back into the room, carrying Danny through the

bathroom.  Adjoining on the opposite side into

KARA'S ROOM

LIGHTNING CRACKLES.  The walls are covered with blood.  Kara stumbles

over something on the floor.  Cranes her neck to look down.

Beth's bloody, mangled remains at her feet.

Shock waves send Kara reeling backwards against the open bathroom door.

Hanging on a hook is Tim's naked body, eyes open, staring at her in a

horrified rictus of death.

Kara SCREAMS.  Drops Danny.  Quickly covers her mouth.  Realizing that

she's given them away.

Suddenly the bedroom door tears open, buckling off its hinges.  The

Shape bulldozes in, wielding its huge butcher knife!

Danny ducks into the hall, evading the Shape's lurching hands.

DANNY

careens down the stairs.  THUNDER RAGES.

KARA

brandishes the fireplace poker at the killer.  The Shape moves in,

backing her through the bathroom ... into Danny's room.  Suddenly

she SLAMS the door on the Shape.

Kara tears off into the hallway.  Turns.  Waiting for the Shape to

appear.  It doesn't.

Kara vacillates down the hall.  Jumping at every sound.  Training her

weapon at things unseen.  SLAMMING doors along the way, sealing off

every passageway as she tries to find her way through the impenetrable

dark tunnel.

Suddenly something CRASHES down from above.  Kara's mother, strung up on

a bloody sheet, dangling upside-down from the trap door in the ceiling!

The axe still protruding from her chest.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Kara SCREAMS, shrinking away from the gruesome sight, faltering through

the blackened doorway behind her.  An unbearable moment of tension as we

think the Shape's mask will be there.

Suddenly the Shape shoots up directly in front of her!  Tearing the

dangling corpse from the sheet, dislodging the axe from Debra's chest

with a repulsive SQUISH.

Kara wheels toward the stairs.  The Shape advances.  Swings the axe.

Misses her by inches.  Kara ducks, lurches behind the Shape.  Swings

the fireplace poker with everything she's got.  CRACKING it full-force

over the back of the Shape's head.

The Shape breaks through the banister and plunges off the landing,

SLAMMING hard onto the floor below.

Terrified, Kara chances a look down.  The Shape doesn't move.

EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT (SAME)

Tommy's Explorer skids to a stop outside the boarding house.  Loomis and

Tommy fly up the front path.  Tommy glances back at the blackened Myers

house for a moment, then follows Loomis inside.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)

Kara barrels off the stairs.  Moves cautiously past the Shape.  Sprawled

face-up in the middle of the hall.

LIVING ROOM

Kara searches for Danny, keeping her eyes trained on the Shape.  The

little boy appears in the doorway directly across the hall.

The Shape lying in between them.

Danny shakes his head.  Too frightened to move.

HALLWAY / FOYER

Ever so slowly, Kara moves toward the threshold.  Hefting the fireplace

poker, she steps right over the Shape.

Instantly she snatches Danny up in her arms.  Takes one step forward when

suddenly --

The Shape springs up, twisting Kara's ankle.  She falls, splaying forward.

The Shape claws at her leg.  Kara fights back, kicking herself free of the

vice-like grip.

Scrambling to her feet, Kara rockets Danny through the foyer to the front

door -- desperately trying to escape from this real-life house of horrors

-- only to find that it is locked.

The Shape rises, gleaming butcher knife in hand.

Kara twists the deadbolt, but someone's secured the chain lock!  Too late

to remove it.  The Shape is right behind them.

Only one way to go.  The cellar.  Kara shoves Danny through.

INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)

Kara and Danny clatter down the rickety stairs and SPLASH across the flooded

basement floor.

A soul-shuddering POUNDING on the door above.

Kara ushers Danny toward the elevated window.

The cellar door EXPLODES, the Shape's hand breaking through, splintering

the wood as if it were paper.

Kara HEARS the Shape moving rapidly down the stairs.  Lifts Danny up the

wall toward the window.  But it's not a wall -- it's John's electrocuted

body, propped inside a storage cabinet!

Danny SHRIEKS, staring into John's lifeless eyes.  Kara pushes him up.

Danny reaches for the lock.  Just an inch away.

Kara can't lift him any higher.  The Shape is coming!

Danny hoists himself up just enough to twist the lock.  He pushes the

window open and clambers outside.

Kara scrambles up old pressboard shelves.  They break under her weight;

she topples back to the floor.

The Shape wades toward her.  Reaching up for the window.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BASEMENT WINDOW

Danny watches his mother struggle to climb out of the crypt.

Kara's hand reaches toward him.  Danny makes no movement.

Danny obediently turns and starts to walk away.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR

Kara's foot falls on the handle of the knife jutting from her father's

chest.  Uses it to springboard herself half-way through the window.

Clawing at wet grass.

The Shape's hand shoots out of the darkness below, grabbing at her legs.

Kara writhes, kicking and SCREAMING.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara grabs chunks of mud as she is pulled back through the window.  The

Shape yanks hard.  Kara catches herself on the window frame.  Quickly

losing her grip.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR

The knife swipes downward, swiping her ankle.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara reacts to the searing pain, releasing her grip on the window frame.

Suddenly Danny appears, locking onto her collar, pulling her clear in one

massive heave.

Kara shuffles across the ground and picks herself up.  Grabs Danny's hand

and runs full-tilt around the side of the house.

EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE

CAMERA FOLLOWS their frenzied flight across the street.  Past Tommy's

Explorer.  Kara limping.  Danny surging toward the Blankenship house.  Kara

SCREAMS, pounding frantically on the door.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Tommy and Loomis have turned the apartment upside-down.

Suddenly they HEAR Kara's frantic pleas outside.  Tommy bolts out the door.

Loomis right behind him.

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

Kara POUNDS furiously.

Danny huddles beside her, peering out across the street.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - MYERS HOUSE

The Shape trudges boldly down the porch steps -- knife in hand!

BACK TO SCENE

Kara sees the Shape -- walking slowly and deliberately toward them.  Her

SCREAMS become even more intense.

The Shape closes in.  At the last second, Tommy throws open the door.  Kara

and Danny tumble inside.  Into his arms.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY / PARLOR (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis slams and deadbolts the door.

Kara pounds against Tommy's chest.  Hysterical.

Kara holds Danny close to her side, backing away in horror as Tommy and

Loomis go around the parlor, securing the doors and windows.  THUNDER RIPS

through the darkened room.

Suddenly the window behind Kara EXPLODES.  She SCREAMS, recoiling.  Then

the window in front of her.  HANDS reach through.  Tommy shoves her out of

the way.

ANOTHER HAND shoots through the stained glass window in the front door,

twists open the lock.

Danny races across the lobby and up the stairs.

Robed figures fill the doorways.  Climbing through windows.  Moving inside

the house.  Surrounding Loomis.

The robed figures descend on Loomis.  Drops his .357.  Tommy lurches for it,

to no avail.  Loomis's SCREAM fills the darkness like a fever dream.

Tommy backpedals up the stairs.  Kara pulling him along as the cloaked

figures glow toward them.  Daggers raised.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kara reacts to the SOUND of Danny's VOICE.

Kara rushes through darkness to find him.

Kara trips and falls.  A pair of silver-tipped black boots planted in

bold stance.  Slowly she looks up the long duster, the cigarette in the

gloved hand of the nefarious Stranger -- Dr. Wynn!  Danny stands by his

side, staring dispassionately.

Kara picks herself up, shaking her head in unmitigated fear, staggering

back down the hallway.

She turns to see the black figures overtaking Tommy.  His SCREAMS

swallowed by hollow darkness.

Alone, Kara careens through another doorway into

TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara slams the door, turns in desperate circles.

Stepping out from behind the door is Mrs. Blankenship -- the baby bundled

in her arms!

As Kara reaches for the baby, the old woman raises a dagger.  Her eyes

burning.  Her wrist branded with the mark of Thorn!

Kara SCREAMS.  The old woman opens the door, allowing the figures to

enter the room.  Daggers drawn.  CHANTING a dark invocation.

The coven forces Kara backwards.  Nowhere to run.  Nowhere to hide.

Suddenly Kara makes a decision -- and takes a running leap toward the

window!

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

Defenestrating herself, Kara SCREAMS, tumbling through the air, bouncing

off the porch overhang before plunging to the front lawn below.  A

thousand grass fragments raining down on her.

KARA

lies on her back, eyes close, hands folded over her chest in silent

repose.  She doesn't move.

THE HOUSE

is still.  Unearthly silence fills the cold October night.

KARA'S P.O.V. - DISTORTED - INT. TUNNELS

A ring of faceless figures move in, completely surrounding her.

Suddenly the feeling of RAPID MOVEMENT.  Glowing torchlight flickers

across dank walls.

KARA

is being pushed forward on a gurney.  Strapped down.  SCREAMING for God's

mercy.

TOMMY

is wheeled through another tunnel.  His face a mass of bloody cuts and

bruises.  His eyes glazed over, trying to find focus.  SLAMMING into

darkness.

EXT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT

LIGHTNING illuminates the cold, forbidding asylum.  The white van pulls up

to the security gate.  Headlights illuminate the sign:  "SMITH'S GROVE -

WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

The main gate cranks open.  The van pulls through.

THE VAN

pulls to a stop near the main building.  The door slides open and Danny

steps out, surrounded by Smith's Grove staff wearing white jackets.

Leading him toward the entrance.

LANDING FIELD

The helicopter touches down.  Wynn ducks out, moving in long, even strides

toward the building.

INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

FOLLOW Wynn through the series of security cages, using his key card to

BUZZ through.  White coats bringing up the rear.

Through tall mahogany doors, they cross purposefully into the adjacent wing.

EXECUTIVE RECEPTION AREA

Dawn, Wynn's efficient secretary, rises with a congenial smile.

Wynn picks up his messages, then heads straight into the office.  Dawn

resumes her typing.  Something eerie in her grin.

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn and his staff file inside.  Removing his hat and duster, he walks over

to where Loomis is seated -- shackled to a chair, a bloody slash across

his forehead.

Seeing this, Wynn snaps angrily at two burly GUARDS.

The guards comply.  Loomis rubs his aching wrists, glowering.

Loomis sees his .357 resting atop Wynn's desk -- only inches away.  Wynn's

hand covers it, slips it inside the top drawer.

Loomis shudders, rocked by these revelations.

Loomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office.  Wynn and

his white coats flow out behind him.

INT. CELL - NIGHT

A tight, damp, claustrophobic space.  Tommy is strapped upright to a crude

metal rack, not unlike the one Jamie was bound to the night before.

Feverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge, cutting through

skin, wearing away his bonds.  Breaking through.

INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A group of white coats, led by Wynn, usher Loomis off an old service

elevator, leading him through the dark passageway.  Wynn turns around,

surveying the tunnel.  As he walks on, we SEE something fall from his back

pocket.

As they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly CREAKS open.

Tommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs.  Edging along

the dank, torch-lit walls.  WIND MOANS.  Rats scamper past his feet.

Wynn has dropped his security key card.  Tommy swipes it.

INT. CATWALK (SAME)

Loomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell.

The Shape lies inside.  Dormant.

Wynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession.  Michael Myers.

Wynn demonstrates.  Loomis looks on, spellbound.

Below, the Shape slowly rises.  Wynn takes out his trusted switchblade.

Wynn cuts his hand.  The Shape grabs his own hand in agony.  Wynn smiles,

sucking the bleeding gash.

Suddenly Wynn whirls around, throwing Dawn -- his faithful secretary --

inside the Shape's pit.  Wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified

SCREAMS trail away into blood-gurgling SILENCE.

Loomis closes his eyes in anguish.

Wynn carries on without remorse.  Loomis is brutally shoved forward.

INT. CATACOMBS - STORAGE BUNKER

A metal door BUZZES open.  Tommy makes his way furtively inside,

pocketing the key card.

A storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates.  Tommy pries one of

them open.  Eyes widening in startled disbelief.

A small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside.

Tommy lifts a rifle, awed by its devastating lines, then slams in a

cartridge and bolts out the door.  Back into the tunnels.

INT. CEREMONIAL ROOM - NIGHT

A large, amber-hued chamber.  The CHANTING coven forms a circle around a

primitive stone altar where Kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her

head adorned with a wreath of mistletoe.

A wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of

reverence.

Behind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell.  Waiting.

Loomis is led inside.  Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to

the altar.  Looming over the terrified Kara.

The CHANTING continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe.  At

Wynn's gesture, there is SILENCE.  The worshippers offer an obedient

response, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists.

We recognize many of the faces in the congregation.  Wynn's staff.  Dr.

Bonham.  Mrs. Blankenship.  The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot.

People from all walks of life.

Faces glazed with sadistic rapture.

Jamie's baby is carried forth, CRYING as it is lain inside a baptismal urn

beside Kara.  Ringed by candles and a circle of stones -- eleven in all --

etched with symbolic runes.

INT. TUNNELS

Letting the rifle guide him, Tommy makes his way through the tunnels.

Toward the sound of MUFFLED CHANTING up ahead.

CEREMONIAL ROOM

The coven CHANTS its invocation.  Wynn draws a magic circle around the

infant with blood from a silver chalice.  Then he inscribes a pentagram in

the air with an ornate dagger.

Suddenly Danny is issued forth up to the altar.  His eyes dark, lifeless

pools.  Kara struggles against her bonds.

Loomis lurches forward.  Halted by massive, restraining hands.

CATWALK

Tommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip, looking down upon the

evil ritual.  Startled by the SOUND of rusted chains.  Pulleys CRANKING.

The Shape's cell being opened.

CEREMONIAL ROOM

The Shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward.  Strangely calm.

Hypnotized.  Looming above Kara.  She lets out a SCREAM of unbridled terror

as he raises a gleaming dagger.

Wynn stands behind Danny.  Places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft.

Above the baby.

Danny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the SCREAMING

infant.  Wynn speaks in the ominous WHISPERING VOICE:

Kara cries, appealing to the boy inside of Michael.

The Shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask.  Listening.

Reminded of his mother.

Danny's eyes flash like fire.  The CHANTING is insidious.

Danny turns sharply, seeing his mother.  Suddenly terrified.

Suddenly Danny drops the dagger.  Wynn flies at him, SCREAMING like an

enraged beast.  The Shape raises its dagger and plunges it -- into Wynn!

Wynn's eyes go wide with shock.  The Shape lurches empathetically.  Wynn

staggers, yanks the blade from his stomach.

RAPID-FIRE GUNSHOTS rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage

of bullets from above.  Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering,

retreating into the tunnels.

Loomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the

dagger.

Kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by GUNFIRE.  The

altar decimated.  Candles falling.  Setting the room ablaze.

Wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk.  Wooden girders CRASH

down from the ceiling.  Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle.

The Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet.  Slowly.  Painfully.  Flames

lapping at its back.

Loomis crawls toward the rifle.  Grabs it.  Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny,

a dagger at his throat.  Pulling him away.

Loomis slowly places the rifle down in front of Wynn.  Surrendering himself.

Tommy drags himself toward Kara and the baby.  Paralyzed with horror as they try to

anticipate Wynn's move.

Loomis turns.  Gasps in startled reflex.  The Shape rises up behind him,

swiping the dagger across his chest!

Wynn retreats and flies through a doorway with Danny.

Tommy and Kara race across the flame-engulfed room, reaching the door just

as it SLAMS shut.  Cutting them off.

The Shape, the trail of flames growing on its back, hurls Loomis over the

crushed altar.

Tommy sees Loomis writhing on the floor, about to go for him when --

The Shape turns on them!  Tommy stands in front of Kara and the baby,

backing away, propelling them out into the tunnels.

The Shape walks forward in fevered pursuit, all but consumed by fire.

TUNNELS

Tommy, Kara and Danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze.

LOOMIS

painfully crawls away.

END OF TUNNEL

Tommy, Kara and Danny reach the tunnel end.  Kara pounds frantically on the

elevator panel.  A DEAFENING ROAR -- the SOUND of fire as the Shape sweeps

toward them.

THE SHAPE

glides steadily through the tunnels.  A walking pillar of flame.  Undaunted.

Unstoppable.  Hell-spawned.

END OF TUNNEL

Finally the doors open.  Kara and Tommy barrel inside.  Mashing buttons until

the doors close -- a millisecond before the Shape reaches them.

INT. ELEVATOR

Kara cradles the baby.  Tommy waits anxiously as the old elevator MOANS and

GRINDS toward ground level.  The doors open.

INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR

They barrel off the elevator and race down a long corridor.

Tommy leads her toward an exit sign.  Behind them, the elevator doors close.

The indicator light shows it moving down.

They reach a dead end.  The row of coded security cages.

He reaches into his pocket -- withdrawing Wynn's key card!

Suddenly the elevator doors open.  FIRE GUSTS.  The Shape emerges, totally

engulfed in flame.  The emergency sprinklers are activated.  Dousing the

flames as it walks after them.

Tommy panics, runs the key card.  The gate BUZZES open.  They run through.

The Shape's hands lurch through the bars, missing Kara by inches.

They race toward the next gate.  The gate behind them opens, and the Shape

walks through!

Tommy runs the card again.  The gate BUZZES.  They slam it -- one step

ahead of the Shape.

The third and final gate.  Tommy tries the card.  Nothing!

The Shape moves through the last gate.  Inside the cage with them!

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE (SAME)

Standing behind his computer, observing them on the security monitors, Dr.

Wynn jams the card's access code.  Then he grabs his satchel and strides

quickly out of the office.  Pulling Danny with him.

On the screens, we can SEE the Shape approaching.  Kara's SCREAM can almost

be heard on the silent monitor.

INT. SECURITY CAGE (SAME)

Kara SCREAMS as the Shape rakes Tommy against the cage.  Kara cowers in the

corner, protecting the baby.

EXT. SANITARIUM - FIELD - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn races with Danny across the field toward the waiting helicopter.

Getting ready for take-off as they duck inside.

INT. SECURITY CAGE

The Shape slams Tommy's head against the bars; he slumps to the floor.  Then

turns its murderous attention on Kara and the baby.

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE

A hand reaches into the top desk drawer, removes the .357 and FIRES an entire

round into the security console.  Destroying it.

The man holding the gun is Loomis.

INT. SECURITY CAGE

The door BUZZES open.  Kara drags Tommy and the baby out.  Slamming the door

shut on the Shape.  Trapping it inside.

The Shape lurches against the bars in wild paroxysms.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD

Tommy comes to as he races with Kara and the baby across the windswept field.

Suddenly they stop dead, watching in horror as the helicopter lifts off.

Kara stands paralyzed with shock, looking skyward.  The helicopter disappears

into the gloom-filled night.

Tommy drags Kara in another direction.  A vehicle parked nearby.  The white

van.

INT. VAN (SAME)

Kara lifts the baby inside.  Tommy flops down in the driver's seat.  Face

bruised and bloody.  A key in the ignition.

Kara holds Jamie's baby.  Tears falling.

Tommy's gaze terrifies her.  He starts the engine and tears off toward the

sanitarium gate.

Kara looks down at the baby, then stares numbly forward.

In the back of the van, we can SEE the the Shape's white mask.  Glowing in

the darkness.  Emerging.

Kara and Tommy drive on, unaware.  And that, for now, is how we leave them.
