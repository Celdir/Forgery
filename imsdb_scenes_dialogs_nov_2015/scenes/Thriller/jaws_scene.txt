OVER BLACK

Sounds of the innerspaces rushing forward.

Then a splinter of blue light in the center of the picture.

It breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted

curtain of razor sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside

of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undersea

world at night. HEAR a symphony of underwater sounds:

landslide, metabolic sounds, the rare and secret noises that

certain undersea species share with each other. Also, the

hint of familiar music, twisted and distorted by the depths.

EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  SHARK'S POINT OF VIEW  RISING OUT OF

THE WATER, LOOKING AT

It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June. We

see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low

dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses. Hear a

number of voices singing. It sounds like an eastern

university's alma mater, no longer distorted.

EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  ANOTHER ANGLE

Around a blazing bonfire, a group of young men and women,

beer cans (or maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the bota

Spanish leather wine-bag much in favor by beach and ski-bum

types.

The group is swapping sentimental alma maters, weepily singing

eastern Ivy League anthems - Dartmouth, Cornell, Harvard,

Penn, etc. Two young people break away from the others. They

are Tom Cassidy and Chrissie. Behind them, there is

considerable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie are more

serious.

TOM

Makes a clumsy attempt at snaring Chrissie, cups her from

behind. She squirms playfully out of his grasp. We discover

he's not especially sober.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH  NIGHT

Tom and Chrissie are separated from the others, silhouetted

against the fire, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is

plodding along in the sand, winded.

Chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water,

leaving Tom reeling atop the dune. As she runs, she is

shedding her clothes. Tom is trying to trail her by her

clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods.

But Chrissie is way ahead of him.

She runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly

into the water with a light "Whoops!" as the cold water sweeps

over her.

Behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beery

chorus of alma maters.

Then we see it -- a gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that

passes her a dozen feet away. A pressure wave lifts her up,

then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.

She looks around for him, finds him still on the beach, his

feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped around his

ankles. She starts to swim back in to him.

EXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATER

Her expression freezes. The water-bulge is racing towards

her. The first bump jolts her upright, out of the water to

her hips. She reaches under water to touch her leg. Whatever

she feels makes her open her mouth to scream, but she is

slammed again, hard, whipped into an arc of about eight feet,

up and down, submerging her down to her open mouth, choking

off any scream she might try to make. Another jolt to her

body, driving her under so that only her hair swirls on the

surface. Then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible

jerking motion. HOLD on the eddies and swirls until we're

sure it's all over.

EXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH

In his shorts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned

circles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to

have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from

a tight sleeve. As he turns, we hear the alma maters in the

background, from the fire.

INT. BRODY HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

A shaft of morning sun blasts through the crack between the

bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the

heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. It catches Martin

Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep.

The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on

with local fisherman's report and weather.

Ellen Brody burrows her head under the covers, avoiding

morning for a few precious minutes more.

We hear the scampering toenails of two cocker spaniels

scrabbling around the foot of the bed. Brody swings out of

bed, wearing shorts, socks, and tee shirt.

He leads the dogs out of the bedroom and down to the kitchen.

INT. BRODY KITCHEN - MORNING

Brody enters, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee,

starts to fill kettle to boil water, the cold water rushes

through and out the burnt-out bottom of the kettle.

Ellen Brody, a tall, attractive blonde woman, enters from

upstairs. She's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call

an "Instant-On" person. Mornings are not her best time.

Before Brody can answer, Michael, his oldest boy, enters,

holding his hand. There is bright new blood on it, but he is

sensibly unconcerned. It's a normal childhood scrape.

Michael goes on out and upstairs. Ellen fumbles in her pocket

and produces Brody's new glasses, which she holds out to

him.

Brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss her lightly. Then

more seriously.

He looks out the window to the view beyond, discovering some

new wonder in the fresh sunlit morning.

BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

Sean, the younger child, is happily romping in the summer

air, enjoying the very air he breathes.

The phone rings.

INT. BRODY KITCHEN  DAY

Brody answers one of two phones on the wall.

Michael reenters in bathing trunks, with a towel on his

shoulder, his hand washed, holding a band-aid ready for

application. Ellen takes it, and bandages the finger with

care and affection.

Michael heads toward the beach.

He gets his shirt on with Ellen's help. She flicks imaginary

dust from the badge on his chest.

He gives her a light kiss, starts to go, with his cup.

At the door, he takes a windbreaker off a peg and goes on

out.

We can see the Amity Police shoulder patch as he goes to a

van parked outside.

EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - MORNING

Martin Brody's Country Squire police wagon rushes past, taking

the view to an enormous billboard depicting a typical summer

day in Amity. A beautiful model splashes in the gold surf,

languishing in a Solarcaine sun. AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written

above her flailing arms.

EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

Three small figures in the landscape, walking the beach. The

surf is rough and there is sea-floor debris strewn about

from the receding tide.

CLOSER ANGLE

Deputy Hendricks is searching the shore about one hundred

yards down wind. Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police

attire, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in

last night, walk down the beach. Brody fingers the missing

girl's shoes, purse and clothes. In the daylight, Cassidy

misconducts himself, wavering between inflated maturity and

tear-blown adolescence.

A shrill whistle makes them turn. Hendricks is fifty yards

away, on his knees. He blows again, a feeble report this

time.

Brody runs toward Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows

with:

MASTER ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE

A skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune.

The booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible.

Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet.

Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and

ventures up. Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying

something at the same time. Brody nods understanding and

steps up cautiously and looks down. He adjusts his glasses,

trying to make sense of what he is looking at.

Whatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique.

Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry

horseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil over the

top of the dune and down its slopes.

Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves

him over. He shakes his head. An awkward moment. Then Cassidy

shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet, his eyes

looking everywhere but down. Brody says something else and

Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. Brody puts

his hand gently around the quaking man's shoulder.

Nodding, he starts to look down, an inch at a time. He looks.

He, too, can't make out what it is at first. Then he

understands.

The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected. He falls

backward in a sitting position as though shot. Nods yes --

it's her. Brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling

close. Hear his breathing. He looks around, envisioning the

week ahead of him....

QUICK SHARP CUT

Chrissie's remains, incomplete from the chest down, horribly

bitten. (NOTE: See Hooper's dialog in Sc. 91 for complete

description of corpse.)

INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

Brody walks through the door and enters his office, holding

a fizzing glass of Alka-Seltzer. Polly, his sixty-one year

old secretary follows close on his heels with her shorthand

pad of messages and reminders.

In the outer office, Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chairs,

sipping from fizzing dixie cups.

Brody dips into file drawers for the appropriate forms. He

gently turns on Polly, who is behind him.

Brody slips behind his typewriter, putting paper in the

machine with the effortless ease of years of practice. He's

obviously no stranger to paperwork. He touch types, hardly

ever looking down, checking his notes and listening with one

ear to Polly.

He is affected by what he's seen, but there's work to be

done.

CLOSE - ACCIDENT REPORT

Brody has just typed the girl's name. He skips the space for

Cause-of-Death, and just under it types the Next-of-Kin

information he has collected from her wallet.

The phone rings and Polly picks it up.

Brody nestles the phone between ear and collar, listening,

as he turns to the typewriter.

INSERT - ACCIDENT REPORT

Cause-of-Death line rolls into place. The hammers punch out:

SHARK ATTACK.

BRODY

leans forward, staring at what he just wrote. Polly cocks

her head and removes the phone from his ear.

Brody takes a breath. A new resolve comes over him.

Brody gets up and moves hastily toward the door.

BRODY'S OUTER OFFICE

Cassidy and Hendricks look up as Brody enters.

A local merchant comes through the door.

Brody pushes past him and out the door.

EXT. AMITY MAIN STREET  DAY

In the busy center of a town preparing for the big Fourth of

July weekend, Brody wends his way around sidewalk activity,

purpose and haste in each stride. As he turns a corner a

little man in a white smock emerges from the Funeral Parlor.

This is Carl Santos, Amity's part-time coroner. Santos looks

both ways before crossing Colonial Drive.

Brody passes Keisel's Bicycle Rental, navigating an awkward

course through an odd assortment of Schwinns that line the

sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence. Keisel

intercepts Brody on the run.

Brody nods yes, and starts to move away, but Keisel holds on

to him.

He holds up bicycle. The bicycle's spokes are bent and broken

from some sort of blows.

ANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPER OFFICE - PORCH

Santos emerges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thirties

editor of the Amity Gazette. Together they cut a beeline for

the other side of the street.

ANGLE - AMITY STREET

Past taverns and chowder shacks, past bleacher construction

and July Fourth posters, Brody enters Hardware and Sporting

Goods... so overstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck

chairs, and rainbow beach towels splash a surplus of color

from the display window to the sidewalk.

INT. HARDWARE STORE  DAY

The store proprietor is busy at work on an inventory list

with a mainland delivery man.

EXT. HARDWARE STORE AND STREET - DAY

Brody emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails,

paint, and brushes to close every beach on the island. He

starts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the

street in the patrol jeep. He stops fast enough to call

attention, leans out the window.

EXT. VAUGHN'S REALTY  DAY

Revealing Larry Vaughn, the Mayor of Amity, exchanging

anxieties with Ben Meadows and Coroner Santos and two other

city Selectmen. They come out in a group, reach the sunlight,

and squint down the street as Brody careens around the corner

and out of sight. Deputy Hendricks, laden with his arts and

crafts, passes them on the street front.

Vaughn and group exchange horrified looks, but we get the

impression it is not in response to the shark-attack news.

They all crowd into a Cadillac El Dorado with Vaughn Realty

signs on the doors.

EXT. AVRIL BAY - DAY

A flotilla of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a buoy that

marks the official course. A rowboat with Scoutmaster using

a bullhorn keeps pace, and urges the boys on.

EXT. ON THE BEACH AT AVRIL BAY - DAY

Two older Seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboards,

while some Parents shade their eyes from the sun, watching

their offspring. Brody pulls up in the Amity Police jeep,

and starts toward the people. Behind him, Vaughn's Cadillac

pulls up and skids to a stop. In it are Vaughn, Meadows, the

Doctor, maybe a Selectman, and Hendricks, with his arms still

full of sign material. Vaughn intercepts Brody, the others

circle around him, effectively slowing his progress through

the sand to the scouts.

The men all laugh, ad lib their remembrances of this

foolishness.

Brody looks out to the water where the scouts are rounding

another buoy on the home stretch.

Vaughn indicates the beach where the Scouts are flopping out

onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished.

All ad lib agreement.

The others surround Brody as Vaughn leads the way back to

the cars, ad libbing their problem with the little karate

choppers.

Hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of Vaughn's

Cadillac. Vaughn waves casually to the Scouts and swimmers

who are vigorously toweling off in the background.

EXT. AMITY STREET - DAY

In front of Amity's only Music Store, a battered old pick-up

truck pulls in to the curb. Quint and his mate cross silently

heading into the music store.

INT. AMITY MUSIC STORE - DAY

A gently tinkling bell tolls Quint's entrance. Inside the

store, a ten-year-old boy is being shown a clarinet. He is

playing a mellow low tone, and running "Ode to Joy." Quint

looms past him like Neptune rising from the deep, and lets

his hand drop on the counter with a slap that sounds like a

club on flesh. The Shopkeeper abandons the little boy and

meets Quint.

Without waiting for it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming

wire in his gnarled fist, and drops a bill on the counter.

No answer from Quint, who stops and sings along with the

boy.

The little kid's music degenerates into a series of awkward

squeaks and blurps, as Quint stares at him. Quint continues

out the door, threading his way through the people in the

street like some great fish. As he gets up into the cab of

his pick-up, its door swings open so we can see a crude

stylized shark decorating its side. It slams behind him as

Quint gets in and drives away.

EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

A plump jelly-bowl of a woman plunges into the ocean. There's

enough there to satisfy the most gluttonous shark. Buoyant,

joyful, she splashes away in abandon. From her, we pan off

to reveal other cheerful bathers enjoying that last

uncluttered weekend before the season starts in earnest.

ANGLE ON THE WATERLINE

A Man and his dog are romping at the water's edge. The Man

is throwing a stick out into the surf, the dog, a happy

retriever, is bounding into the waves after it.

TWO YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE BEACH

A Girl and her Boyfriend leave their blanket and run for the

water, playing tag, chasing each other, having a wonderful

time.

ANGLE ON BIRTHDAY PARTY ON THE SAND - MARTIN AND ELLEN BRODY

He is sitting stiffly in a beach chair, scanning the beach

with careful, cautious looks, eyeballing everything that's

going on.

Around their particular blanket and umbrella are a number of

adults and their kids, the youngsters gathered to celebrate

Michael's birthday. Ellen is dishing out ice cream and cake

from a cooler chest to the raucous 10-year-olds. Michael's

hand is still bandaged.

Brody (and we) hear a shrill scream from the water. He

stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening

out there.

BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

The young lady is disappearing under the water, pulled under

the waves by some force. She is shrieking. She pops right up

again riding the shoulders of her boyfriend, who pulled her

under. She's laughing hysterically. Brody is unamused.

THE ADULTS

Ellen captures Sean, and holds him playfully, an example.

Brody rumples his hair and sets him off to play.

ANGLE ON ANOTHER SMALL BOY, PLAYING ALONE

It's Alex Kintner, and his mother, nearby, reading a novel.

Alex is towing a funny rubber raft, and headed for the water.

He holds out his hands.

Alex starts for the ocean. Behind him, Michael and his gang

are also heading for the inviting waves. Brody is watching

them go, his spine rigid with tension.

MAN AND HIS DOG

As Alex and the boys hit the water, we see the man throwing

his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly after

it.

BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

Out beyond the kids and the dog, the Fat Lady is bobbing

around, out way too far, isolated from the other swimmers.

UNDERWATER VIEW - EXT. - DAY

A fish's-eye view of the bathers: lots of little kicking

legs, rafts with tasty arms dangling in the blue, slowing

circling, favoring one raft (little Alex's). The Kintner

boy's legs and arms are kicking and paddling, producing

bizarre underwater vibrations of more than passing interest.

Dog goes by, dog-paddling along.

ON THE BEACH

Brody is half-rising, looking out over the water. The Fat

Lady is not where he remembered her. He scans the water

anxiously.

A Black Object swims across the water. It's the dog, breasting

against the surf.

ANGLE ON THE WATER - BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

It's the Fat Lady, floating, relaxing. A black object swims

up to her. It's not the dog. It rears up out of the water.

It's a man in a black bathing cap. They exchange distant

pleasantries, he strokes away.

ANOTHER ANGLE - WATER

Alex Kintner, paddling around, making boat sounds, tooting,

going "vroom, vroom."

ANGLE ON THE BOY AND GIRL

They kiss, embrace, kiss again. Strong stuff. They sink

beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace.

ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY AND HIS FRIENDS

He's trying to salvage a soggy piece of birthday cake, holding

it above the water, paddling with his other hand. The bandage

has come part way loose, and his cut is trailing in the water.

BRODY AND ELLEN ON THE BEACH

Ellen is rubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing

himself to relax part way. His eyes still nervously scan the

beach in a constant surveillance. Mr. Keisel is coming out

of the water, toweling off vigorously, exclaiming to himself.

ANGLE ON THE GANG PLAYING IN THE WATER

Michael has just been drenched. He splashes back. A big

waterfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the

water, shouting battle cries and karate whoops. Alex is

paddling around near them, but not involved with them.

ALONG THE WATERLINE ON THE BEACH

The Man with the Dog is whistling into the ocean, looking

for his dog.

THE WATERFRONT

A huge splash explodes in the water near the gang, an eruption

of foam and spray that stops everyone cold for a moment.

They stop to see who was responsible.

Before anyone can answer, another kid (P.J.) renews the

battle, whooping a karate cry, and slashing at the water

with his hand like a little kung-fu warrior, advancing through

the waves.

CLOSE ON MATHEW, SPLASHING BACK

He hits the water, which sprays up suspiciously pink. He

stares at it, surprised.

CLOSE ON P.J.

His hands are dripping deep pink, the red matting his hair,

running into his eyes. He looks down. The boys are surrounded

with a deep pink slick, their little bodies ringed by a

spreading stain of blood.

ANGLE ON SHORE, A TOURIST AND HIS WIFE

He's pointing frantically out to sea.

ANGLE ON BRODY

He leaps to his feet, nearly knocking Ellen over, and starts

for the water.

Brody is pelting towards the water. He kicks sand over an

annoyed Mrs. Kintner, who looks up, just in time to hear

Brody's bellow.

His urgency communicates itself to the others. Ellen snatches

Sean up from where he's been playing in the sand. Other

parents are calling their kids, hysteria mounting. People

rush into the water, dragging their children and families

bodily out of the ocean. The first kids coming out of the

surf are frantically trying to wash the sticky blood off

their bodies. The sight of the red sends the beach into a

full panic.

CLOSE ON BRODY

He rushes into the water, up to his ankles, and suddenly

stops, unable to move into deeper water. He is urging Michael

out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging through

the surf towards his dad. He stands there immobilized by the

water, nervously helping people out of it onto the beach.

ANGLE ON MICHAEL

As he emerges from the water, Alex Kintner's raft washes in

behind him, ripped in half, the water pink, the foam spreading

the stain onto the sand as the wave breaks.

ANGLE ON MRS. KINTNER

Her voice rising into panic and hysteria with each unanswered

cry.

EXT - THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE AND COUNTY OFFICES - DAY

We are looking at the closed double white front doors of the

building, through which we can hear a rolling boil of agitated

conversation. After a beat, they open to reveal Mrs. Kintner,

looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of God;

in effect, she has. Her eyes are puffy and swollen from

weeping, her clothing is put on and fastened awkwardly, her

gait is not normal. As she walks toward us, Quint enters

with his back to us, they pass without notice; Mrs. Kintner

moving out of sight, Quint leading us through the doors into

the town hall.

INT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

A crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway,

their voices a babble of confusion. Many of them are gathered

around a roughly lettered notice that has been posted on the

town's official bulletin board. It reads.

"A $3000 BOUNTY TO THE MAN OR MEN WHO CATCH AND KILL THE

SHARK THAT KILLED ALEX M. KINTNER ON SUNDAY, JUNE 29, ON THE

AMITY TOWN BEACH."

Vaughn and Brody are on the outskirts of the crowd, which

includes Meadows, some selectmen, and others.

There is a flurry and a bustle as everyone rearranges

themselves and makes their way into the Amity Selectmen's

Council Chambers.

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

The crowd is thronging into the large room. Already in the

room is a solitary figure, standing all the way in the rear,

watching everyone as they enter. Against the back wall is a

large blackboard used for town business during meetings.

All react.

Pandemonium. A collective nerve has been touched.

Two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides

vociferously, ad libbing assent or dissent depending on the

point of view held forth.

ANGLE ON QUINT, THE MAN IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM

He has just run his large, coarse fingernails over the

blackboard. He is a large, rough man, a professional fisherman

marked by daily physical toil, About 45 or 50, it's hard to

tell where the scars leave off and the wrinkles begin. There

is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killer-

whale.

Crowd reaction.

INT. BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

A riffly blur, color alternating with black and white. The

dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white

rendering of eight species of shark. The banner at the top

of the page reads: THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATERS.

The riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of

scar tissue on six former shark victims. Riffling -- stop.

Photograph of five Ichthyologists posing on wooden stools,

framed by the enormous jaws of a prehistoric shark from the

family Carcharodon charcharias.

BRODY

his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library

books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks. The

door opens and Ellen enters, quietly, in respect for Brody's

mood.

Ellen walks past Brody to the window and looks out the window

which overlooks the south bay. It is the hour of dusk.

Brody gets up, concerned, and joins her at the window.

BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

Michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school

chums are in the water, swimming around it. Brody opens the

window and calls down:

Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying

a reproduction of the famous painting "The Gulf Stream,"

showing a black fisherman in a small dinghy similar to

Michael's being assaulted by the jaws of three man-eating

sharks, circling his boat.

SUNSET ON THE BEACH

Hendricks and another deputy are assisting Brody. Silhouettes

of townspeople look on like mourners at a funeral.

In the background some workmen are taking down the shutters

from a quaint summer cottage. They pause to watch the

declining moments of the day.

Three Selectmen also stand watching. One of them seems to be

whispering bounty news to three youngish men on a nearby

dune.

Sounds: Surf and hammering.

EXT. OCEAN AND PIER - NIGHT

Selectman Denherder and his buddy, Charlie, a professional

angler, row towards a tumble-down jetty that leads fifty

feet out into the black water.

Denherder hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the

wheelbarrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog

chain and a large patched inner tube. Charlie takes out a

monster hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the

rickety pier that is only about five feet across.

The splintered pier sways to and fro as the men reach the

end and start to work. Charlie baits the hook with a massive

chunk of sirloin while Denherder secures the loose end of

chain to a skinny piling. Charlie then fastens the inner

tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.

Denherder tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it

is. Charlie heaves the bait. Splash! The inner tube follows

and both men eagerly watch as it floats seaward, the chain

playing out from the wheelbarrow.

Charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling. He

turns on his transistor radio and loops one end around a

fractured board. Denherder paces, bored to death.

CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW

Suddenly zipping out, faster and faster, as both men

straighten.

Denherder is goggle-eyed.

The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the

wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty. A section of chain

tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into

the air. Both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube, racing

out to sea in a wake of white water, suddenly dips under.

It is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow

pilings.

CLOSE - PILING

A lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings SNAP with a

resounding CRACK.

ANGLE - JETTY

The end of the jetty is yanked loose. Denherder is flipped

like a chip over the side and into the cold night water,

where he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber.

DENHERDER'S POINT OF VIEW

The severed section of jetty, a joined platform of footboards,

is being dragged seaward with Charlie sitting dazed on top

of it, his lit pipe still going.

Charlie rolls into the water, sputters, turns to watch the

flotilla of wood draw away.

CLOSE - CHARLIE

looking seaward.

CHARLIE'S POINT OF VIEW

The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree turn and heads back

in his direction.

Denherder steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out

of the water.

Charlie, inhaling terror, trying to slog to shore. The jetty

is getting closer. Suddenly, an enormous black fin breaks

water like a periscope, making course corrections as it comes

for Charlie.

Denherder jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his

balance on his way to help Charlie. Charlie has reached the

last pylon toward open sea, and his hands clamber for a hold.

But --

INSERT - CHARLIE'S HANDS

The algae is too slippery, and his fingers keep sliding back.

That's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky

and Charlie manages, with Denherder's desperate help, to

make it safely to shore. The remains of the pier float belly-

up in the inlet.

CLOSE ON THE HARBORMASTER OF AMITY - DAY

He is sitting on a little canvas folding chair, eating a

bowl of Cheerios with milk and sugar, watching a panorama of

ineptitude and greed unfold before his old seaman's eyes.

The Amity Pier area is a minor madhouse: out-of-state cars

elbow local vehicles for parking space at the foot of the

dock, and a parade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islanders,

off-islanders, tourist, and others shout and push their way

onto the crowded pier, each carrying some bizarre or

appropriate tool for the real or imagined capture of an

unarmed shark of indeterminate size.

Rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, harpoons,

shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; every fishing supply

store and sporting goods house within a hundred miles has

been cannibalized to equip this weird array.

ANGLE ON BRODY AND HENDRICKS ARRIVING ON THE SCENE

Not having room to bring their police vehicle anywhere near

this mess, they are proceeding on foot into the confusion.

Some of the locals greet Hendricks with occasional nods of

recognition, or an ad libbed "Hi, Lenny," or "Hey, Lenny."

ANGLE ON BOAT RENTAL - PIER

An argument is in progress between and Out-of-Towner and the

Boat Rental Man.

ANGLE LOOKING OUT TO SEA

Making its way through the channel towards the dock is a

sleek, expensive runabout with the name "Fascinatin' Rhythm"

on the stern. It's professionally handled, and rumbles in as

it coasts in towards the dock area. Some other boats clear

the way for it, zig-zagging in the harbor, causing an annoying

chop.

CLOSE ON BOAT

Matt Hooper, a bearded, bespectacled young man with an intent

look, is maneuvering the vessel peering through his windscreen

at the ragtag collection of seafaring loonies all around

him.

BACK TO DOCKSIDE

Hendricks is mediating the argument between the two men, and

we can hear a plaintive "But Lenny," from the local as Brody

sees something that makes him move towards the other side of

the dock. We see him cross to a little boat built for two or

three that is settling low in the water as a seventh man

climbs in with his gear.

BEN GARDNER AND HIS BOAT, FLICKA

Matt Hooper is gliding into the dockside, and Ben throws him

a line to help make fast as he moors. It's a small island of

courtesy in an otherwise discourteous mob. Hooper nods

politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.

He's standing near where Brody is finishing after his

encounter with the chummers.

Brody approaches Ben Gardner.

The Mate nods "Yes" and starts to prepare to get under way.

Ben and his Mate move away from the dock, headed towards the

channel and the open sea leaving Felix and Pratt to scamper

around the dock looking for another ride.

ANOTHER DOCK AREA, CLOSE BY

A particularly awkward moment between a small sailboat and a

couple of powerboats. The sailboat is trying to hoist sail

to make it away from the pier under sail, a real yachtsman's

conceit, since Hornblower himself probably couldn't navigate

through this mess. Brody, a landlubber for sure, is trying

to direct traffic to untangle this new mess.

Amidst all this, we can hear the angry shouts of the entangled

crews.

Brody starts back towards the shore, Hooper is by his side.

Before he can finish, Brody spots something on shore that

moves him to shout to his deputy.

Brody looks, and stops by a boat that's about to cast off.

He holds out his hand.

The man passes Brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sticks.

Brody tucks the dynamite under his arm, and continues down

the pier. Hooper is still with him.

All around them are two distinctly different breeds; the

quiet pros, like Ben Gardner, in well-worn, comfortable

clothes, with efficient, sensible gear, and the amateur

crazies, with all manner of weapons and impractical, silly

tourist clothing.

INT. DOCK SHED - DAY

Brody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get

Hendricks' attention. He throws a handful of washers at the

window.

EXTERIOR - OCEAN - DAY

Ben Gardner's boat is in the lead with Gardner's shouting

derisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. The

armada is spread out and moving in a ragged circle, fifteen

boats in all. One man heaves cherry bombs into the water. A

smaller boat going in the opposite direction offers us

Barwood, forking spaghetti leftovers into the ocean while

his friend pours out a bottle of ketchup.

A speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading

instructions aloud from a book entitled "Sharks - East Coast,

Vol. I."

boatload of impoverished scallop fishermen throw a net

overboard, full of gaps and split ends. The professionals

look professional, but the landlubbers out for the $3000

make it impossible for everybody. Collisions are barely

averted.

THE RUBE GOLDBERG ERROR

The Out-of-Towner in a small boat is bent over in a life and

death struggle, his rod in a tight arc. His buddy leaps across

to lend a hand.

Twenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues.

This time it's the overloaded boat with the poor scallop

fishermen. Shouts of I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! Then a tangle

of tackle springs from the water. They have hooked each other.

Joy turns to swearing.  Arnold Felix stands up to applaud

the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his

Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it

were a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes --

Both the Out-of-Towners and the Scallop Fisherman falls over

backward --

ANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT

Three men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast

arc. A few yards off stern we see a triangular dorsal fin

crossing back and forth, struggling, jerking, the mighty

tail threshing. One man is screaming success, the other two

slapping the angler on the back.

CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX

They spot it and sour.

The owner of Pratt's boat throws it forward and Pratt removes

a .45 automatic from the holster of his belt. He tests it,

firing once in the air. As they near the scene of the

struggle, eleven other boats begin converging, until --

HARRY'S BOAT

Everyone wants to get into the act. They are attacking the

threshing beast with all they've got. Pratt uses his

automatic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun. There

are occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck

from time to time as bullets skip by. Finally, the shark

stops threshing.

FELIX AND PRATT

Their boat has moved close to the shark, closer than Harry's.

One of his party in the over-filled boat grabs a gaff and

leans out to grab the moribund shark. But Harry won't give

up the line, still reeling in.

Pratt nods reluctantly. The man swings, lodges the gaff and

hauls the shark up onto the gunwale. A paroxysm of cheers

from the surrounding boats. Smoke flares are fired into the

air.

It is a ten-foot tiger, and what a mess -- splattered with

bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from several orifices.

But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to

capsize the boat. Pratt panics and fires six times with his

.45. The bullets pierce the shark's head, pass through, and

split the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water

rises. Everybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

The Amity Morgue is also the Amity Funeral Home, a Victorian

house that normally serves as the community's mortuary. The

Coroner, a professional small-town GP, is standing by as

Hooper is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recorder

with a headpiece that leaves his hands free for measurement

with a calibrator or calipers.

With a shrug, the Coroner slides open the drawer.

CLOSE ON HOOPER

He is looking down as the drawer slides past him, still matter-

of-fact, turning on his recorder.

The sheet has just been lifted, and Hooper stares down at

the lump on the slab. He stops, turns off his recorder as

emotions wage war with his senses. Rationality wins, and he

turns on the recorder again.

EXT. DOCK AREA - DAY

We open close on ugly, open shark's jaws, still oozing blood

and gore. As the shark is hoisted up into the air on a gin-

pole hoist dockside, Meadows is seen passing with his

secretary and a photographer from the Amity Gazette. A crowd

of returning fishermen from the Armada and townspeople are

gathering around the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the

classic sports fisherman's trophy shot.

As he and the photographer turn to mob, we see Hooper and

Brody arriving from the morgue. Hooper immediately heads

towards the shark, while Brody pauses and we see a look of

relief and delight cross his features.

Men ad lib "No, I caught it..." "I hooked him," etc.

He continues to call directions and move people out of the

way to set up his shot. Hooper is measuring the shark.

The men (Felix, Pratt, et al) get Brody to join them in the

shot. The whole town and the Armada fishermen all line up in

a classic "high school" graduating class shot with the

victorious fishermen kneeling in front, and the rest of the

Armada and Townspeople arranged behind them. Hendricks hold

up the "Beach Closed" sign in ironic victory.

ANGLE SHOWING VAUGHN APPROACHING THE DOCK

Brody spots the Mayor coming towards the dock, and detaches

himself from the group to join him.

HOOPER AND THE FISHERMEN

The men who landed the monster are in a tight cluster,

debating something with Hooper, who is dwarfed by the big

beer bellies and ham-fisted hands all around him. It's

probable we don't even see him.

The Men ad lib "What kind of shark is this?" "It's a shark

like in the movies they got sharks." "It's a man-eater, for

sure." "I bet it's a record-breaker," etc.

Hooper enters the circle, and picks up where he left off,

measuring the shark's teeth. Others watch him. Charlie and

Denherder walk over to the shark. Charlie punches it.

BRODY AND VAUGHN

They are walking down to the shark together.

Brody and Vaughn are by now near the circle of fishermen,

who are surrounding Hooper, raising their voices at him.

Felix, Pratt and the others ad lib disagreement. "You're not

gonna cut up my trophy," etc.

We see Mrs. Kintner approaching, dressed in black.

MRS. KINTNER JOINS THE GROUP

She seeks out Brody, and stops in front of him.

He nods, she slaps him full across the face. There is an

embarrassed silence. Some people leave, following a trend

that began with the first mention of cutting open the shark.

She stops, unable to continue. Her father takes her arm and

leads her away. Pratt, Harry and the others trail off after

her. During the rest of the scene, the camera tightens in on

Brody to the exclusion of the others.

Before Hooper can finish, Brody's shoulders slump and he

goes slack.

He turns and leaves abruptly, surrendering the dock to Vaughn

and Hooper, who eye each other with mutual dis-admiration.

INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT - DINING ROOM

Brody and Ellen, Sean and Michael, have all finished dinner.

Brody's plate is untouched, a virgin meatloaf. His glass, on

the other hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff

scotch and ice. He is staring across the table at the

youngest, Sean, who makes a face at him. He makes a face

back.

They play this game together for a few minutes.

Sean gives Daddy the kiss. Brody shoos him and Michael off

to bed. Ellen, who is feeling progressively more left out

with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and clears a few

dishes. Brody is not letting her into his world for the

moment, and it shows. There's a knock at the door.

Ellen opens the door for him.

Hooper enters. He's carrying a couple of bottles of wine

which he picked up in town. He sits down near Brody.

He starts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go

ahead."

They exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly

desperate, but shared laughter.

They laugh some more. Ellen is again left out of it.

Brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in a

corkscrew, etc.

Brody has the cork out of the wine. Pop.

Brody takes the fine wine, and pours it into his drink glass

filling the tumbler to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch,

and the wine.

He extends the bottle to Hooper, who politely accepts a token

sip. He takes some for himself, and offers some to Ellen.

Brody digests all this; confirmation of facts he has gleaned

in his newly acquired knowledge of the shark species.

There is a long pause.

He gets up and they both start out. Ellen watches them go.

INT. BOAT SHED - NIGHT

Dark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange

silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding. At one end, the

large, symmetrical bulk of the shark's carcass lies on a

tarp. A single dark figure is bending over the dead shark.

The large double doors at one end of the shed squeak open,

and the Shadowy Figure moves abruptly away from the shark.

The new entrants move into the shed. It is Hooper and Brody

and they are continuing the conversation begun in the car on

the way over.

As the Shadowy Figure moves silently into a vantage point

against one wall, he passes through the light from a window;

it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize

him as he backs against the wall.

They bend over the shape like 18th century graverobbers.

We hear a slurp and a squish as Hooper produces a big knife

and dips into the shark with a major incision.

From his vantage point, Quint watches, unseen by the two

men.

Brody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex,

fascinated by the bizarre ritual.

He kicks the remains around below camera.

EXT. ABOARD HOOPER'S BOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

We see Brody, looking sick and nervous, holding on anxiously

as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at

night. His glasses are already flecked with the white salt

of dried seawater. He is wearing a life-preserver.

Hooper is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, his

eyes scanning the sea restlessly, checking the dials and

gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding

and "fish-finder" gear mounted in the cockpit. A green glow

shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-circuit

TV cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures onto

monitors in the dash.

In the aisle between the seats is a large container filled

with unpleasant-looking bait; Hooper is long-lining for signs

of shark, and chumming.

Brody, bored, tired, and slightly queasy, is trying to

concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. He stares

at the sophisticated electronics displays.

INSERT - ELECTRONICS SCREEN

It's blipping and peeping.

CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN

WIDE ON THE "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM" AS IT SWINGS AROUND

The two men looking very small and vulnerable in the open

sea, the low-hanging mist obscuring their visibility in the

night.

CLOSE ON BRODY

He hears something, his eyes widen. It is the "bump-thump"

of something scraping the hull.

Hooper looks up and cuts the wheel hard, as the same time

dropping the engines into neutral, and then reverse. The

sudden change throws Brody to his knees.

ANGLE FROM HOOPER'S BOAT: GARDNER'S BOAT "FLICKA" AWASH AND

FLOATING DEAD IN THE SEA

It's what they've just run into -- flooded to the gunwales,

loose debris floating around, a tangle of lines and gear

looking like floating garbage in the cockpit. Hooper's light

sweeps across it.

Hooper cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampers out to

the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the Flicka.

INSIDE THE COCKPIT OF HOOPER'S BOAT

The electronic display is showing increased activity, but

only Brody, who is clinging to a support for dear life, can

see the blips and hear the chatter. Hooper is leaning out to

look at the Flicka.

THE TWO BOATS

Hooper is examining the Flicka, tying a towline to it.

INSERT HIS POINT OF VIEW

The light picks its way across the ruined boat. The rail

where a cleat once was is broadly scarred down to the raw

timber, and the heady cleat has been torn bodily out of the

hull, ripped out screws and all.

HOOPER'S BOAT

Something he has seen moves Hooper.

He sticks his head over the side, into the black water.

INSERT, ELECTRONICS DISPLAY

Blip, chatter, blip, chatter.

BRODY AND HOOPER

Hooper moves to get a better look, the boat rocks in the

swell and from his movement, Brody clutches the rail in a

death-grip.

Hooper goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling

on a weighted belt, holding a mask and hot flashlight.

Hooper takes a last few breaths, orients himself, takes a

long, hard look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the

sea.

CLOSE ON BRODY

He is studying the surface, trying to follow Hooper's

movements. Brody is forcing himself to stay at the edge of

the boat by sheer willpower and grim determination. Brody is

fascinated by the sea like a bird facing a cobra. He is very

much alone. He grasps a flashlight or boathook as a fragile

defense against the unknown.

PAST BRODY'S BACK TO THE ELECTRONICS

Beep, chatter, blip.

UNDERWATER SEQUENCE - HOOPER

Hooper descends in a froth of bubbles. Warily he turns a

full circle with his hotlight. At first we see nothing out

of place about the Flicka except that it is lying so low in

the water. But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for

damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thirds of the way

forward.

The hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood

around it has been bashed and splintered. Hooper explores

the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath

and begins to dig at something. Whatever it is comes free in

his hand. As he studies his find, his light wanders upward,

pointing directly into the dark hole. Hooper looks up...

CLOSE - HOLE

Ben Gardner's dead face stares out through the hole in the

Flicka, eyes and mouth gaping in frozen horror, his skin

pinched like a prune.

CLOSE - HOOPER

bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through

escaping bubbles. We hear the gasping shout as a bubbling

roar in the ears. His mask fills with water as he flails for

the surface. Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his

own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with

adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried

loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the

eternity of the ocean bottom. He finally bursts through the

surface.

END OF UNDERWATER SEQUENCE

THE BOAT, HOOPER EMERGING FROM THE WATER

He is gasping for breath, his whole body vibrating with

urgency. The salt water in his lungs combines with the

adrenaline in his blood to deprive him of speech.

Hooper, despite his shock and surprise, is strangely elated,

almost giddy with the wonder of his discovery.

Brody sinks weakly into a chair. Brody huddles in the stern,

Hooper kicks the engine in with a roar, and still a-shiver

with excitement, turns the boat and its grim tow back to

port.

EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - THE BILLBOARD - DAY

Next to the "Amity Welcomes You" billboard is a group of

selectmen, Vaughn, Meadows, Hendricks, and another deputy

standing by with paint and brushes. Brody's wagon is there,

along with a few other cars. Busy late afternoon traffic is

starting to pile up as early weekenders and curiosity seekers

slow down to see what's happening.

Behind the billboard, Brody and Hooper have gotten Vaughn to

one side. They are making a closely reasoned presentation to

him.

He leads Brody around to the front of the billboard, on which

we see that some pranksters have painted a huge shark fin in

the water behind the swimmer, so she looks now like a frantic

bather fleeing a pursuing monster.

INT. FERRY BOAT - DAY

Two cavernous iron doors. Then a crack of vertical light as

six burly crewmen muscle them apart. The Amity ferry landing

is approaching, people in colorful outfits waiting dockside

for the first filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summer season

and --

Bach's Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this

wholly visual montage of disembarkation. The next two minutes

should be treated like a "short film" taking into account

all of the colors, episodes, faces and behavior of a variety

of Americans who colonize Eastern resort communities for the

ninety-day season.

Intercut with this montage is Brody's home, where Ellen,

Hooper and Brody are in sweaty, gritty all-out effort to

enlist some support. Elements in this montage include:

A.  A train of cars trundling down the ramp, bumper to bumper.

B.  Young Beautiful People from Princeton, Yale, NYU, wearing

knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs,

energized children, senior citizens holding hands on the

pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchairs.

C.  Hooper, bent over the phone: "I know it's a long weekend,

could you get me his home phone number?

D.  Sidewalk vendors hawking "Shark Killed" souvenirs, big

photo "Personality Posters" of the dead tiger shark hung on

the dock.

E.  Brody: "You're acting senior officer? Where's Chief Petty

Officer Feldman? Where's the Coast Guard Executive Officer?"

F.  Souvenir stands selling Genuine Sharks Teeth from The

Amity Killer Shark, Captured This Week.

G.  Amity Cab Company, small blue Toyotas lined up with their

college student drivers like a bomber wing.

H.  Hooper:  "Well then, operator, could you try him in the

dining room?"

I.  Brody: "All I get is a recording. Is there some other

number I could try...?"

J.  Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously

to the window. Cadillacs with Rear Admirals at the helm,

their wives with blue hair remembering the way from years

before.

K.  Hooper: "When did he check out? Did he leave another

phone number?"

L.  Brody: "How can I reach him in Chambers if he's not in

Chambers?"

M.  Little Karate Hands breaking picket fences.

N.  Some local delinquents about 10 or 12 years old, towing

behind their bicycles a little dead sand shark with signs:

"Amity Monster Shark." "Killed Here." 5 Cents a Hit." Etc.

Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend

the ramp. They all wear Men's Club Lifeguard patches and

matching collegiate windbreakers. They scour the landing,

looking for someone to save.

The boat is empty. Everybody heading inland, anticipating

the best Fourth of July ever. Already there is debris on the

docks and the cleaning crew works away at it.

INSIDE THE FERRY

As Bach's Little Fugue ends, the six burly crewmen lean their

combined weight against the Cathedral doors, closing out the

light and locking in the trade. The doors latch shut with a

resounding clang!

ANGLE ON BRODY, NERVOUSLY WATCHING THE BEACH

He is studying everything, trying to make sure he has it

covered as well as possible. He almost doesn't hear the

approaching roar of a small helicopter until it settles down

behind him, and a Flying Officer gets out, starched, pressed

fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dark

aviator's sunglasses. The Steve Canyon of Amity. He presents

Brody with a clipboard.

Brody signs. The Officer shakes his head as Brody makes an

error.

Brody complies, shaking his head. The Officer snaps him a

salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copter, buckles in,

and gives Brody a "thumbs up" as he lifts off in a flurry of

sand and ice-cream wrappers.

EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

And this is it -- the Dawn Patrol, the only forces that the

frantic phone calling produced. Hendricks, and the regular

summer extra deputies. The lifeguards. Half a dozen state

troopers. Some deputies from neighboring towns, and a Coast

Guard ensign with a handful of regulars in work dungarees.

Some of Hooper's friends from the institute.

Brody and Hooper, badly in need of sleep, are watching the

crew straggle in. Already the first of the holiday beach-

goers are piling out of their cars in a brightly colored

cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, portable bar-b-

ques, radios, sun visors, reflectors, rafts, balls, tubes,

and newspapers.

Hooper watches one such group: A Family of Ten getting out

of a camper-van. He watches in dismay as the family bumbles

onto the beach for a day of fun in the sun.

Brody addresses his troops, such as they are.

The Men ad lib responses: "Happy to do it," "Any time,"

"When's lunch?" "I hate holidays," etc.

He nods to his men, who head for some Boston Whalers (or

similar boat with surf-riding capability) and push off into

the surf to patrol the swimming areas.

Everyone kind of nods acknowledgment.

EXT. BEACH - AMUSEMENT AREA - CLOSE OF SHARK MACHINE

In a shed near the bandstand, a half-dozen pinball and arcade

machines sucking quarters from holiday beach-goers. A

mechanical shark traverses the screen, is hit with an electric

harpoon and red "blood" blossoms from its side, indicating a

hit.

Sounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun. Meadows is

there writing it all up for the paper. A move away from the

screen of this particular machine reveals the arcade, the

parking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panorama of

the beach that July 4th has created.

EXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOURTH OF JULY

four foot surfer's swell curls and crashes on shore,

riderless. The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summer color

as one thousand vacationers practice fun in the sun, but not

in the water. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors are

everywhere.

ANGLE - LIFEGUARD STATIONS

A half-dozen lookout lofts. As many handsome lifeguards with

Walkie-Talkies strapped to their trunks and loud-hailers at

arm's reach. Bored, two of the hot dogs train their binoculars

on some local color.

ANGLE ON TV MOBILE UNIT

A TV Mobile Unit Van is setting up: cables snaking to cameras,

a camera with a big sports zoom sitting on the platform atop

the truck, a spiffy announcer-type in a blazer with his

station's call letters on the pocket. Inside the darkened

control room, we can see the pale blue squares of monitors

in a mosaic against one wall, facing the switcher.

AT SEA

Hooper is methodically patrolling in his boat. Tactically

flanking a three-hundred-yard apron of black repellent are

four small watch-boats. A tiny pleasure boat darts around

the repellent line. Farther out, crossing back and forth,

are patrol boats. To top it all off, a Coast Guard helicopter

hovers and patrols three hundred feet above.

INT. TELEVISION MOBILE UNIT

At least eight monitors, reflecting the outputs of three

cameras and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and

effects monitors.

MONITOR: CAMERA 1: Holding on a group of happy citizen-bathers

as they unpack their gear, wave to camera, run into the water.

MONITOR: CAMERA 2: The Repellent Line, set in place by Coast

Guardsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping

repellent into the ocean.

MONITOR: CAMERA 3: Close on the Bandstand, where Amity's

band is playing lilting patriotic airs.

After we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's

going on: the preparation of the tape segment for the six

o'clock news.

On the "Tape 1" and "Line" monitors, we see Vaughn being

interviewed by the Announcer in the blazer.

MONITOR: CAMERA 1: As Vaughn speaks to us on the monitors,

the monitor for Camera 1 pans over to show a Sightseeing Bus

pull up in the parking area, and a horde of media vultures

spilling out, carrying cameras with long lenses and tripods,

telescopes, sunshades and parasols, all the equipment of the

curious and none of the equipment of the holiday bather or

swimmer.

TAPE 1 AND LINE MONITORS: Close on the Announcer, Vaughn out

of the picture.

Hooper's voice fades off as someone at the mixer panel dials

his mike off, and brings up the Announcer's lavalier.

The camera pans off him to a happy family headed for the

beach.

MONITOR: CAMERA 3: Zooms in on the puffing face of the tuba

player.

MONITOR: CAMERA 2: Brody and the Announcer.

MONITOR: TAPE 1 and LINE: Back on the Announcer, his lips

moving, but his sound turned off. We hear, instead, the sound

from Monitor Camera 2, Brody and the same Announcer.

MONITORS: CAMERAS 1, 2 and 3: The cameras seek out the

appropriate activity as the Director calls for it.

TAPE 2 - MONITOR:

Starts showing us the assembled interview segment we've just

seen, starting with the Announcer's opening remarks.

His voice is dialed under as the Announcer himself appears

in the control room to watch himself on the monitors.

As Vaughn begins his spiel again, the other monitors show us

the action on the beach.

ANGLE ON THE BEACH

Vaughn is in his shirtsleeves, having slipped out of his

jacket.

He mops his brow, and surveys the beachfront. At this moment,

there's nobody swimming. He approaches a familiar Selectman,

nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.

On an adjoining blanket, a spirited Ruth Gordon type is

sitting, watching brightly as her manservant, a polished

Eric Harrison type, prepares some tea from a thermos.

He puts down the tea service, and leads her towards the water.

At the edge of the sea, she stops, and he walks in.

He ducks his head under for a final look around. His dripping

head rises triumphantly from the surf.

She starts into the water, he takes her parasol, escorting

her the rest of the way into the ocean.

WIDE - ON THE BEACH

Encouraged by the sight of the Woman and Arthur, and Vaughn's

quiet urgings, people begin to wander into the surf, a few

at first, and then a rush, as people plunge in and begin

enjoying the pleasures of ocean bathing. The Selectman goes

in, his family follows, Vaughn watches it all, beaming.

BOAT #7

Hendricks is on the radio while a Coast Guard spotter works

the sonar.

Pan to the water.

UNDERWATER

As before, 400 pairs of enticing, yummy swimmers' legs,

kicking like animated hors d'oeuvres.

INT. HELICOPTER - AERIAL VIEW

A breathtaking view. The copter spotter looks down with naked

eye and binoculars.

CLOSE - HENDRICKS

ANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY

He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the

happy hordes. Meadows nods "hello."

A group of youngsters playing with Michael Brody's dinghy.

They are hauling it toward the surf.

Michael turns as Brody trots toward him.

TV CREW - NEAR WATER

TV cameramen are packing up their gear. For them it's a wrap

REPELLENT LINE - COUNTY POLICEMAN

Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copter Spotter's

voice overloads the speaker.

BOAT #7 - HENDRICKS

Guns are up, heads turning everywhere.

The Coast Guard sonar operator spots it and pales. A slick

black dorsal fin is slicing a wake toward the swimming area.

BEACH - BRODY

Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying

to transmit.

A lifeguard in a loft behind him begins blowing on his

whistle.

CLOSE - BRODY

shouting hysterically.

THE BEACH

Dozens of bathers halfway out of the water, turn to see.

More whistles, and they start toward shore. We hear panicky

voices ad-libbing; "Shark," "Look Out," etc. The loudhailers

sounding more urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one

person after another. Entire groups of people begin pulling

toward shore, some of them obviously trying to control a

growing hysteria in others.

BOATS #6 AND #7

are converging, heading toward the repellent line as if

tracking an underwater shadow. The fin is beyond the repellent

cordons and heading into the crowds.

HOOPER'S BOAT

Caught on the other end of the line, he is wheeling in a

broad, hot-dogger's circle turn, headed back.

THE WATER - BATHERS

People begin screaming. Kids are suddenly separated from

their parents. Others seem to forget how to swim. One myopic

little girl has her glasses bumped off and she begins to cry

in blinded panic. Ellen Brody looks around frantic.

BOATS #2, #3, #4

The riflemen in the boats are trying to get a bead, but too

many civilians create a hazard. The Coast Guardsmen attempt

to sever the repellent cord to gain access to the bathing

area and the heaving fin.

THE WATER - BATHERS

This is a confirmation of our worst dread -- a full-blown

headlong water panic. Screaming vacationers claw their way

over the bodies of the less able. Some literally attempt to

walk over the bobbing heads and glistening backs of others

pulling for dry land.

CLOSEUPS - PANIC

Horrified faces. Some are stunned and wandering in slow,

tentative circles, while others are helped out by friends.

Five people try to mount a rubber raft.

Ugly reminders that each of us is Number One.

Brody enters shot, yelling into his walkie-talkie, someone

charges past him to help an old man out of the water.

EXT. THE BEACH

Dragging the helpless from the surf. Tears well in Brody's

eyes. The screaming is deafening. The TV unit is hopping up

and down in rage and frustration.

One thousand survivors pack the beach, standing absolutely

still. A numbing cold sets in, and people shiver against

each other.

Muted sobs, whimpering, coughing.

The six burly lifeguards huddle together like Cub Scouts.

ANGLE - BATHING AREA

The monstrous black fin turns a slow circle as two Coast

Guardsmen manage to cut their own repellent line. All boats

converge on the dynamic fin. Men raise their guns to fire.

Others adlib nautical commands in a uniquely calculated

fashion.

CLOSE - FIN

It slips sideways, revealing for the first time a tiny blue

snorkel. Then appears the faces of two youngsters whom we

will recall from the coven behind the dune. The fin bobs

back, a beaverboard replica attached to a partially submerged

surfboard. One youngster looks up and is greeted by:

YOUNGSTER'S POINT OF VIEW

Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed directly at him.

Surrounding him on three sides. Some of the policemen start

to lower their guns -- struck dumb.

HOOPER IN HIS BOAT

He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his

eyes still restlessly searching.

CLOSE - YOUNGSTER

his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his

hands in unconditional surrender.

ANGLE - ESTUARY

The narrow estuary leading into the half-mile is rough today.

Two children digging in the sand and unaware of the beach

panic one hundred yards away look up, and the little girl

points.

BLACK DORSAL FIN

is cruising through the narrows and toward the busy pond.

HOOPER IN HIS BOAT AGAIN

He sees it, and jams his throttle forward. He steers with

one hand, fumbling urgently for his walkie-talkie with the

other.

AERIAL VIEW

The circle of boats around the little pranksters, the crowds

huddled on the beach, Hooper's boat suddenly arrowing towards

the estuary, leaving a huge boiling wake.

CLOSE ON VAUGHN

He catches Hooper's boat out of the corner of his eye.

Curious, he follows its progress. It's urgency finally

communicates itself to Vaughn, who begins a shambling trot

across the dunes towards a rise overlooking the estuary.

OVERLOOKING THE ESTUARY

Vaughn gets there just in time to see the disaster. He

watches, helpless, trying to shout, out of breath. Stunned.

ANGLE - POND

Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit.

Kit is admiring the shark's tooth necklace around his own

neck while Michael rubs some water on the scratches left by

it.

The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They are

not yet aware. The fin seems to circle and return. It heads

toward Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets in its

way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of coffee

when he is "bumped." The entire boat is overturned. Michael

sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entire bow

lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side.

Michael and Kit are thrown head first.

Three heads in the water come up sputtering, the fin between

them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes directly

at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could

touch it, but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and

panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That

all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off scream --

the head and upper torso of the novice passing Michael swiftly

as though being carried off -- a current of blood trailing

behind.

A renewed cry of shark!

CLOSE - BRODY

He turns. Oh God! Running through the slogging sand.

CLOSE - ELLEN

A sudden turn. She runs.

CLOSE - HOOPER IN BOAT

He's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

Three boats racing to carry out the orders. The black fin re-

passing the two children, racing to get out. Hooper reaches

the mouth before the others. The fin won't veer off. It smacks

into the little vessel, bumping it aside. The fin is left

racing into open water. Blood leavings. Hooper leaping over

the side, slogging towards Michael.

WIDE ON WATER

Copter roars in buzzing the shark, but too late.

CLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN

They are pulling Michael out of the water as Hooper splashes

up. Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes staring at

nothing.

People gather and Brody snatches beach towels out of their

hands. They cover Michael and carry him off the beach, feet

raised above his head.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Michael is wheeled out in the bed. Brody and Ellen are there.

Sean is sleepy in Brody's arms. Vaughn is waiting in the

hall.

Ellen exits.

Vaughn signs, and Brody takes the paper and exits.

QUINT'S HOUSE - DAY

Brody and Hooper are approaching Quint's house. They enter

through the big wooden doors, into another circle of Hell.

Smoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting over fires

fills the air. Quint and his mate, Herschel, are grinding

pieces of pilot whale into chum. The whale lies bloody on

the floor, its ruined carcass adding to the stench of other

sharks being boiled in the drums, their tails suspended in

the air.

Diesel fumes and decay fill the air, and tools, ropes, broken

bits of iron and engine parts litter the floor. Wall hangings

of rope and floats, and buoys, barrels, tackle and gear all

conspire to frame the killing floor.

Brody and Hooper navigate the obstacle course.

He emerges from the steam and smoke.

Brody tastes.

Herschel interrupts. He's stopped working, and is wiping his

hands on a bloody rag.

Quint wheels to face him.

Quint turns to see this new voice, and starts walking towards

him.

Hooper ties the knot effortlessly.

He takes Hooper's hands in his own big bloody fists, and

feels them as he talks.

EXT. QUINT'S DOCK - MORNING

The Mate is loading. He hands Quint the items on his check

list as Quint takes them aboard.

As he talks, we see Hooper coming down to the dock. Wheeling

a wagon behind him are two long-haired Research Assistants

from the Institute. On the wagon, among other things, is a

big shark cage. At dockside, Hooper checks his list, as he

signs for his issue.

CLOSE - ON HOOPER AND RESEARCH ASSISTANT

Hooper sees his gear approaching.

ANGLE ON DOCK AND ORCA

Quint sees Hooper approaching with the large cage.

Hooper indicates "me."

Hooper nods. Quint sings "Spanish Ladies" half to himself.

ANGLE ON DOCK, BRODY AND ELLEN APPROACHING

She's carrying a little plastic shopping bag, he's wearing

shiny new foul weather gear, bundled up, sweaty,

uncomfortable.

She gives him as good a hug as she can manage under the

circumstances.

She straightens his coat, and gives him a shaving kit to

carry aboard with his toiletries. From the deck, Quint

whistles derisively.

Brody nods, and holds her hand for a wordless moment.

There is a sputter and roar as the Orca's diesels kick on.

They laugh together, and exchange a short, fierce kiss.

Its diesels chugging, the Orca pulls away from the pier.

Ellen has already resolutely turned her back on it, and is

walking off the dock back onto dry land.

ABOARD THE ORCA

Quint has set a course out towards the open sea. He lashes

the wheel, and jumps down to address Hooper and Brody, who

are standing together in the stern.

He laughs at his joke. This is probably something he tells

all his charters.

He starts moving gear around, preparing chum barrels, setting

hooks, Hooper gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way.

EXT. THE OCEAN - NOON

It is quiet as the Orca drifts along in the current, a wide

chum slick spreading behind it. A couple of flag buoys spread

along our perspective show us the miles the boat has gone.

Quint spots something in the water -- a small blue shark

attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece of

bait, and throws it over the side.

The shark takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently

sets the hook, and reels the shark alongside. He hauls it

part way out of the water, and sticks it with a gaff. Hooper

and Brody watch.

INSERT - SHARK WRIGGLING ON HOOK

Tailrope dropping on him. Gaffed and bleeding, the shark is

immobilized by Quint's practiced hands. He takes one of his

big knives and poses for a moment beside the struggling fish.

He slices into the shark's underbelly. We hear the sound of

entrails plopping into the water. Brody is almost retching,

and Hooper is just displeased.

ANGLE ON THE WATER

The gutted shark swimming in circles biting at its own

entrails.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Fins closing in on the wounded shark.

SHARK FRENZY

A boil of water and the flash of fins and teeth as the local

sharks erupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood

spewing, a sudden display of the fury and blind predatory

drive of the fearsome species.

HOOPER AND BRODY REACT AS WE

EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTERNOON

The Orca is drifting in neutral. The ocean is like gelatin,

the sun sucking heat waves from its surface. Brody at the

stern, handkerchief on his head to protect from further

sunburn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt:

the ladling out of chum. There are several empty chum barrels.

A flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, another waits to

be tossed over the side. Brody is reeling with nausea. He

opens his overnight kit and takes out a handkerchief and

some Old Spice after-shave. He pours the after-shave into

the cloth, presses it to his nose. Hooper is also in the

stern.

Quint opens a can of beer and drains it in one long pull,

crushing the empty and throwing it over the side. Hooper

drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his

hand with a silly "plup." He stows the pieces in an empty

chum barrel.

Brody goes to unlash a fresh barrel, but can't figure out

the knots. He finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all

comes loose... barrel, shark cage, and, most important,

Hooper's tanks, clattering and rolling on the deck.

LATER

The men are in different positions on the boat. Hooper on

the flying bridge. Quint in the stern, Brody hanging over

the rail, puking.

Quint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnarled

squid from the garbage pail, and searches for a No. 2 hook

rig. He holds up a strip of whale.

Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up.

Quint sits in the fighting chair. He casts off, murmuring as

the line feeds out.

LATER

Quint at ease in his chair, Brody near him, practicing tying

knots. The line starts to move, a few feet at a time; both

men watch. Then the line whizzes off the reel. Brody jumps

up. Hooper springs to the deck. Quint puts his hand on the

drag and addresses the situation softly.

Quint tightens drag and strikes. The line goes whizzing out.

Brody runs to Quint's side. Hooper springs up to the flying

bridge.

Brody goes to get water, the boat surges, he staggers. Brody

pours water on the screaming reel, nearly unspooled now.

Hooper is turning the boat around and the line changes

direction.

Hooper steers it sharply.

Again the line changes direction, down this time.

Quint reeling in like mad.

He ad libs brief instructions to Brody as the line rushes

out and there is less tension. Quint is horsing up and down,

reeling in.

The line is almost vertical, and Quint shows a hint of

bafflement. He reels in suspiciously.

Hooper is rushing down.

The leaders show above the water line. Brody is wide-eyed,

waiting for that first look.

Hooper snaps the rope onto the leader and holds on.

Before he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily

clutching at the big rod, appalled. Quint skips away for a

flying gaff. He picks one, turns...

That's when the leader lashes free, sending Hooper crashing

backward in a serious fall, and the rod whips at Brody's

forehead, drawing blood. Quint snatches up the rod and reels

in.

The wires have been bitten through.

Hooper shakes off his dizziness and obeys. Brody watches

Quint rig up a new leader, hook up the same bait.

Brody goes inside to inspect his forehead.

ON BRIDGE - HOOPER AND QUINT

Hooper cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down. He stands

stock still on the main deck, motioning Brody to be silent.

Then picking up the newly rigged rod, Quint softshoes it

over to the chair. About to sit down, he freezes.

CLOSE - QUINT

looking hard at something.

CLOSE - BRODY

staring, eyes widening.

CLOSE - HOOPER

moving in, surprised, interested, fascinated.

THEIR COMBINED POINT OF VIEW

We see the shark. First the fin... then the head and upper

jaws, ten or twenty yards off the side of the boat. It finally

submerges, its tail giving a final slap.

ANGLE ON QUINT

He puts his rod away and stares at it. And stares. And stares.

Hooper is the first to break the silence.

Hooper is nearly beside himself with a strange ecstasy. He

leaps toward his gear.

Quint ignores him and moves off into the pilot house, where

he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin

to assemble something inside it. Brody is alone on the deck

with Hooper.

Hooper is contained in his own excitement. He has finally

come up with what he was looking for -- an expensive Nikon

through which he peers intently at the shark alongside. He

is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range finder

and focus.

He is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional

boil.

CLOSE ON QUINT IN THE PILOT HOUSE

He is assembling the Greener harpoon gun, deftly screwing on

the long wooden stock, the heavy steel barrel, and big shaft

with the wicked barbs, the frame all rigged with line. Past

him, on the deck, we can still see Hooper. As Quint is working

with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.

Quint snaps the mouthpiece to his lips.

He snaps off the radio, and, for good measure, pulls the

plug from the power source.

ANGLE FROM DECK

The big shark is slicing through the water just below the

surface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the

teeth gleaming.

ANGLE - INCLUDING FOREDECK

He is positioning Martin frantically, trying to include Brody,

the shark, and the Orca in the same frame. Quint finishes

with the gun, and as a final gesture, snaps an explosive

cartridge into the breech. He empties the box of cartridges

onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them

into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound for the bow

pulpit.

ON DECK

Quint appears with the harpoon gun. He throws one end of the

line to Hooper.

He indicates the barrels on the foredeck.

Quint moves up toward the bow, Brody goes up to the flying

bridge to take the wheel, Hooper starts for the foredeck,

but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear around as he

desperately hunts for something.

ANGLE ON HOOPER

He finds what he's looking for. A small, powerful strobe

unit, waterproofed, a miniature signal beacon. He triggers

it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in

the sun.

Hooper scampers to the foredeck and begins to rig the light

to the first barrel, as the shark begins to surface near the

bow.

He guides Brody with hand signals. Brody tries urgently to

get it right, not to oversteer, to try to hold the big boat

with its throbbing diesels on the course that Quint is

indicating.

Hooper is rigging like crazy.

FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

Brody steering f.g., Hooper on the foredeck with the barrels,

Quint leaning out over the pulpit, the gun at the ready, the

shark crossing inexorably in front of them.

CLOSE ON QUINT

Agonizing over his shot as the shark approaches, glancing

back to see if the line is properly rigged and Hooper is

clear of it.

The shark is in position, Hooper shouts, a moment too late.

Quint fires. The harpoon slams into the shark behind his

head, half-way along the back in front of the big dorsal

fin.

INSERT - COILED ROPE AND BARREL

The rope snaps out in a blur of violent motion, Hooper jumps

back, and the barrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the

line rigged to the harpoon. It bounds forward and into the

sea, past Quint, who is already reloading, mounting another

steel shaft. In the distance, the barrel bobs and skips

violently in the water, dragged by the shark in his merciless

moves.

THE FOREDECK - QUINT

Hooper, furious with himself, runs for the flying bridge to

take the helm from Brody.

THE FLYING BRIDGE, BRODY AND HOOPER

Hooper has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle

forward as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree turn.

His eyes dart about the ocean, looking for the barrel, as he

hot-dogs the ship around in a violent expression of his own

disgust with himself.

He spins the wheel again, trying to make the big boat handle

like a formula speedster. The decks tip and the rigging sways

under the sudden strain. Brody is caught unaware, and tumbles

off his feet, sliding across the deck to fetch up against a

wall. the M1 Rifle is close to his hand. He stares at it.

FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

Hooper is anguished, intense, trying to find the shark,

spinning the wheel, compounding his error, tipping the boat

in rolling turns as he crosses his own wake. Quint has turned

his back to the sea, and is in the pulpit looking up at

Hooper, staring at him, excluding everything else.

As Quint folds his arms and stares at Hooper, we realize the

sun is going down, and it's getting dark.

Hooper throttles back, and the roar of the diesels subsides

and the boat resumes an even keel, slowly circling the ocean.

EXT. ORCA - OPEN SEA - NIGHT

Throttled back to slow ahead, the boat circles the water

endlessly, staying over the shark like an avenging angel.

Its running lights gleam in the night, and a glow lights the

interior of the pilot house. A bright strobe glints on the

water winking once like a firefly.

INT. PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

Brody and Hooper at the table, Quint at the wheel, keeping

his eye on the light.

He corrects course slightly to keep the barrel buoy in sight.

Hooper is sitting at the table, morose. Brody is staring at

a couple of open cans of beans or beef stew, or some other

crappy rations Quint has on board. Dirty spoons stuck in the

open cans show us this has not been a formal dinner. Quint

fumbles on the chart shelf and produces some of his home

brew.

He takes a pull, and hands it to Hooper, who takes a double.

Brody touches the fresh abrasion on his forehead, where the

fishing rod caught him.

Quint bends forward and pulls his hair aside to show something

near the crown.

Brody looks politely. Hooper stirs himself.

Quint is amused. He presents his own formidable forearm.

Brody is fascinated. Quint and Hooper take a long pull from

the bottle.

He hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scar.

He starts rolling up his own dirty pants leg.

Brody is drawn into their boasting comparisons. He secretly

checks his own appendix scar, decides not to enter the

contest.

They toast each other. Brody looks around, sees the strobe

blink once through the darkened window.

He starts lowering his pants to reveal a place on one hip

where the tissue is scarred and irregular.

Hooper is pulling at his shirt, trying to get it off, but

it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone.

Brody lends a hand. The shirt slips part way off.

The two men raise their mugs in a toast.

He drinks, Hooper follows.

Brody is looking at a small white patch on Quint's other

forearm.

Quint remembering.

CLOSE ON QUINT

EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

Quint has just finished his story, and we are looking across

the quiet night sea to the Orca slowly circling in the night,

the warm light in the pilot house barely revealing the figures

of the three men inside, the red and green running lights

winking along the ship's flanks. We hear the distant boom

and drawn-out hoot of a whale.

INT. ORCA PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

There's a brief, eerie pause. Quint breaks the silence by

muttering into song, which he slowly swells.

Gradually, Hooper and Brody join in, and the pilothouse

becomes a warm cozy place.

EXT. OCEAN

The Orca and its song in the night. In the foreground, the

barrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them,

the big dorsal fin surfaces, and glides ominously towards

the ship.

INT. PILOT HOUSE

The song is continuing, and we hear the barest hint of a

scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. Quint's

eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive ears are the first to

hear the abrasion of his ship. Things vibrate on the shelves.

Quint stops singing, Hooper and Brody continue a duet. The

scraping repeats, and Hooper now senses it. He drops out of

the song, leaving Brody singing solo.

As Brody hears this and is about to stop singing, the boat

is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping turns

to a violent assault somewhere on the understructure of the

vessel. Water bubbles up into the hold. Brody starts, and

looks at the radio. He is about to move towards it when

Quint's urgent instructions stop him.

He leaves Brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck,

grabbing his M-1 rifle as he goes. Brody hits a switch and

we hear the pumps starting.

ANGLE ON THE ORCA

Hooper is on the flybridge, starting the engines, but the

diesels sound wrong.

Hooper does.

The boat is assaulted again. Quint fires over the stern,

emptying a clip into the water.

Brody moves cautiously up to the bow.

Hooper stands ready on the bridge, Quint pacing the stern

deck.

He jams a fresh clip into the M-1. The men scan the seas

around them. Quint resumes their song, louder this time,

more defiant.

Hooper and Brody join in from their respective positions.

EXT. OCEAN, WIDE ON THE ORCA

The men in place, singing, the water sparkling towards the

horizon, the stars twinkling above. The sound of a distant

whale in distant counterpoint.

EXT. THE ORCA - DAWN

Brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while Hooper and

Quint have a hatch up on the stern, and are working together

to repair the damaged rudder controls torn loose by the shark.

Hooper is bucking the steel rod, while Quint is hammering

away at the joint, trying to drive a new pin.

The engine is idling. Bits of iron clutter the deck, along

with a few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets.

Brody tries to comply.

Quint hammers again.

And we can. The Orca's diesels are no longer smooth. Brody

suddenly sees something, and points.

BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

The barrel is surfaced directly ahead of them, just off the

port side. They are drifting up to it.

The strobe light winks at them. Quint holds up a hand:

"Quiet!"

Everything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up

on them.

He takes a killing lance from the rack. Hooper gets a

boathook.

Hooper leans out gingerly, snagging the barrel with the hook.

It bobs lightly in the water, an innocent bystander. Hooper

shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in.

Hooper gets the line and starts hauling it up. No resistance.

It comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck.

He and Quint exchange looks.

WATER - ANGLE

Both men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching

the water on the aft side. From the opposite starboard

direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great

White. First the fin, then the conical nose and the upper

border of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the water

in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed

toward the unsuspecting men.

CLOSE - BRODY

His instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquired sense of

direction.

CLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT

They turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them

from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom,

the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed-

off cable. It rolls on its side and looks at them as it

passes.

Past the stern the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope

out of Quint's hands, shearing a huge swath through the paint,

peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze letters

out of "Orca." The shark begins an arc to sea, its fin cutting

the water, and starts circling the boat. Quint notices his

cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing

it.

The diesels start with a terrible grinding.

Hooper slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, clearing

the deck for action once again.

Brody heads for the radio in the pilot house.

QUINT - CLOSE

A perfectly terrible look comes over him. He raises up and

starts after Brody. Brody disappears into the cabin. Quint

pauses outside and sees:

INSERT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTERED BASEBALL BAT

his calloused hand grabs it up fiercely.

INT. RADIO SHACK

Brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on

the complex console.

ANGLE - DOORWAY

Quint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the door,

raising his bat.

CLOSE - BRODY

looking up in horror, covering his face.

CLOSE - QUINT

Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon.

Crash!

Sparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of

metal ricochet all over the cabin as Quint demolishes the

ship-to-shore radio.

Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the

bat.

Brody's adrenaline turns his fear into rage. His glasses are

cracked or broken by flying pieces of radio. He seizes the

bat, and pound the shattered radio for emphasis.

His tirade is interrupted by an urgent bellow from Hooper.

CLOSE - HOOPER

Pointing at the fin.

ANGLE - OVER THE BOW

Hooper pulls the boat into a tight turn and Quint has a shot

at the upward rolling flank. He sinks it with careful

precision.

Brody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard, and

the barrel, changing over, catapults into the air before

plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash.

ON THE FLYBRIDGE

Hooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel. Diving

down. Up again -- Quint prepares another iron. Brody is

digging in his bag. He comes up with his 2" .357 service

revolver.

The engine thuds and knocks.

Suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Orca.

Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

Quint leans to one side, harpoon over his head. The Great

White breaks water and...

He sinks it deep. We hear shots. As the new rope whips out,

Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation

police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands,

firing at the shark's head.

Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the

barrel goes over.

WATER LEVEL ANGLE

He has seen the two barrels pop to the surface.

He yells to Hooper and Brody as he swings behind the controls.

Quint steers "Slow Ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvers

toward the moving barrels. Quint peers down, steering closer

and closer.

Together Brody and Hooper hook a barrel-rope and hold on for

dear life as the shark changes course.

Brody and Hooper pull in with all they are worth as Quint

helps out by wheeling in a circle. He laughs to himself,

enjoying the spectacle.

CLOSE - HOOPER

securing the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang

overboard. Brody ties his now-perfect bowline adjacent cleat.

WIDE ANGLE - ORCA

The boat is jarred violently from side to side as the

underwater force of the Great White jerks and heaves them to

and fro, up and down, side to side...

ANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY

FLYBRIDGE - QUINT

sees the fin ahead. It is pulling the boat.

The shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is

both horrifying and awesome. Its jaws break water, snapping

at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated.

Quint throws the Orca into neutral and shouts down:

With that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting another

shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and

balance. The shark can be seen directly ahead, threshing

closer.

He fires the iron, and the shark veers downward in a gushing

shower of spray.

HOOPER AND BRODY

They are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are

stretched too taut. They jump out of the way, falling flat

on the deck as the ropes sweep over them, knocking over

objects, skeetering across the deck. A tight jerking motion,

and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards. And

much too fast. Water is splashing up over the transom in its

backward wake. The engines groan and complain.

Wrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet.

CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS

A moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength.

The rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintered wood

spraying -- and the barrels fly over the water. They disappear

beneath the turbulent grey surface.

The three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat,

look out at the blank water.

ANGLE - OCEAN

Pop -- pop -- pop. One, two, three, the barrels surface --

ready for more.

Brody looks down at his feet. There is salt water up to their

shoe tops.

The barrels start a wide circle, each cuts through the water,

pushing a wave before it and leaving a wake behind.

Quint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his M-1, and

checks the load.

ANGLE - OCEAN

The barrels approaching the Orca dip below the surface, one --

two -- three.

Brody looks around. Hooper on the flying bridge searching in

all directions. Quint is looking more appalled every second.

Booming thud at the keel. Brody slides on the wet deck and

Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's arms.

WITH HOOPER ON THE FLY BRIDGE

It seems the only place out of reach of the shark. Quint

climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol.

Just then, the barrels pop up ahead, veer left, and duck

under.

BRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW

The barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow

sliding under the Orca, seemingly endless. Violent scraping

sounds.

Quint is grimly silent. Brody senses that Quint is in the

fight of (and for) his life.

The Orca taking evasive action. But the three barrels are

closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying

themselves with every rotation of the damaged shaft.

ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

Hooper is jamming the throttle forward, but the engine is

pounding and knocking wildly. The barrels circle and move

in. Quint has his rifle ready.

He leaps to his gear, trying desperately to get his dart

gun.

Just then, the shark attacks, breaking water and rising over

the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectoral fins, belly,

falling sideways. A vast spray drenches the men. Quint fires

into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.

The Orca shudders from side to side. From Hooper's point of

view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws,

shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to

side, trying to tear a chunk out of the very hull. Quint has

reloaded and is firing into the fish. Brody has a wicked

pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing

and gouging it, trying for the eyes. The killing lust is on

all three men.

The boat surges, the shark gives a final unbalances wrench,

and disengages. The dorsal fin circles off, beginning a wide

loop around the boat.

The engine quivers and dies, the boat without power, rolling

half awash, a wounded victim.

The fin dips, the barrels follow, the shark disappears beneath

the waves. There is complete silence.

THE THREE MEN ON DECK

In the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the

hull, the hoarse panting breathing of the men, the pings and

pops of the cooling, dying engines.

QUINT AND THE TRANSOM

He eyes the stern. Huge cracks and broken timber testify to

the fury of the attack.

ON DECK, LATER

Quint and Hooper are assembling the shark cage, its shiny

bars the only undamaged things on deck. Brody is working

too, bolting the sections together.

The men are speaking in near whispers, quiet in the silence

that surrounds them. Hooper is in his wet suit, adjusting

weights, mask, tanks, etc. The cage is standing in the stern.

Quint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section.

Hooper climbs in though the top.

Brody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and Hooper into the

air. Quint balances the gin pole lines, Hooper crouching in

the cage, examining it for stresses; satisfied, he holds out

his hand. Quint puts the spear gun into it.

CLOSE ON HOOPER IN THE CAGE

He examines his weapon, checking the power load, with the

big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razor

point.

Hooper inside, looking out the bars of the cage, gives Brody

a reassuring smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his

teeth and checks his regulator. Brody steps back, and with

Quint guiding the cage, begins lowering it off the gin pole

boom arm into the sea alongside the boat.

Brody and Hooper stare at each another as their faces pass,

Hooper sliding down into the cold grey ocean.

As Hooper disappears beneath the surface, Quint and Brody

exchange a long look between them.

UNDERWATER - CAGE

HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

Submerging. The sky, horizon, water line, clean fresh sea

air then... the magnificent innerspaces, with bubbles

sparkling in front of us.

ANGLE - HOOPER IN THE CAGE

as he floats to twenty feet Hooper never stops looking around

360 degrees. He removes the rubber guard from the needle and

waits.

EXT. THE SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

Their turning heads tell us that the barrels are still

circling.

Suddenly, both heads stop turning.

THE SEA

The barrels have come to a stop. Delicately, they change

course and meander toward the lowered cage.

UNDERWATER - HOOPER

His back is to us. He is just now completing a visual sweep

and turns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on

something monstrous... and fascinating.

HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in

the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly --

comes the shark. It moves with no apparent effort, sinuous

beyond comparison. As it nears the cage, it turns, and its

ghastly length passes right in front of him: first the snout,

then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

Hooper tentatively reaches out. It is too far for the

strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes,

iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge

the passing currents with pink.

SURFACE

The trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the Orca

above. Brody and Quint leap back.

HOOPER - CLOSE

The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hooper,

expecting the shark to attack out of that same general

direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars,

breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and...

we see that the shark attacking from behind him.

The cage is sent careening. Hooper grabs the bars for dear

life. The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal

jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending

the bars like clothes hangers. Hooper can't turn the pointed

end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the

non-rational attacker as possible.

Hooper is trapped.

The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges

again. The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars,

the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hooper's torso,

the tail thrusting it forward. Hooper drops the strychnine

pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture

depth.

All the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating

Hooper at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hooper

fumbles with the overhead hatch cover, kicking up and out of

the cage. The shark backpedals with its tail, but the broad

head won't shake loose.

Hooper rushes downwards, after the strychnine pole.

ANGLE - SHARK

The shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward after

Hooper.

Hooper nearly recovers the pole. Again it slips from his

frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss.

Hooper turns and looks up.

The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

SURFACE

One of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls

taut.

HOOPER - DEEP

Turning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a

moment by the snarled rope -- now surges forward.

SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

The Orca is listing dangerously aft, the ginpole bent almost

to the breaking point. Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul

up the cage. Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a

hand-winch. The ginpole is splitting.

The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale...

the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca, dragging

it, but Quint won't give up the winch. Brody hauls on the

rope barehanded.

UNDERWATER - HOOPER

maneuvering downward, away from the jaws... Suddenly the

crazed shark veers upward for the surface.

SURFACE - QUINT

The winch is working faster now, Quint demonically winding

it in. The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks

water.

Brody is horrified. The cage is empty!

MASTER ANGLE

The shark breaks water right beside the Orca, rising with a

great whooshing noise. It rises vertically, towering overhead,

blocking out the sun. The pectoral fins seem to reach forward.

The shark, in all of its monstrous glory, falls onto the

stern of the boat with a shattering crash, narrowly missing

Quint and Brody. It drives the stern underwater, the ocean

pours in over the transom. The jaws snap from side to side.

Brody flounders backwards away from it.

CLOSE - BRODY

He is clinging to the mast for dear life, as the ship begins

to tilt to stern, and everything starts to break loose around

him.

NIGHTMARE ANGLE - DECK OF THE ORCA

The giant jaws are snapping irresistibly at everything: great

chunks of wood torn out of the deck and superstructure.

Deck chair, irons, rope, gear, beercans, bottles, Brody's

bag, all are food for the insatiable maw blindly churning

away.

Quint is clinging next to a rack of lances: he is enraged at

this ultimate violation of his territory. He snatches up a

lance and hurls himself at the shark with a wordless bellow.

The great head weaves side to side, the deck is at a

treacherous incline, slippery with blood and seawater. Quint's

footing falters and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of Hell,

the big teeth seize him and snap.

Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is

clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and

legs suddenly contort as the shark's teeth meet across his

torso. Blood gushes onto the deck. The remnants of his body

tumble from the shark's mouth.

Brody sees the horror, hears the screams -- in his

desperation, he tears loose one of Hooper's remaining air

tanks, and hurls it at the monster. It tumbles into the bloody

well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel

blocking the cruel jaws.

The shark's head shakes even more violently, trying to clear

the cold iron, but the tank is in to stay.

DECK OF THE ORCA, LISTING BADLY

To avoid sliding into the jaws, Brody scrambles on the titling

deck, bracing himself in the cabin door to avoid pitching

down into the bloody mouth. He fights his way into the cabin,

already a shambles.

Below him, on the deck, the shark lunges again, shifting

weight so that the boat in now stern down, and listing to

the side. Water from the sea pours into the cabin.

Another lunge by the shark. The huge snout and jaws slam up

against the doorframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.

More seawater. To stay in the cabin is to go down with the

ship.

Brody clambers as far from the shark as he can, against the

forward wall of the pilothouse. He sees the window Hooper

used before. It's blocked by barrels and debris. He breaks

the side window highest above the water, edges out onto the

battered bridge.

The shark rolls around, now half in the water. The ship is

sinking, the sea is not a viable alternative. Brody climbs

up into the flying bridge.

The shark is still lunging and snapping. Brody is forced to

climb higher and higher as the ship slowly sinks beneath

him.

CLOSE - BRODY

He scrambles for his life onto the flying bridge, sees the M-

1 stuck there, seizes it.

OVER BRODY, LOOKING DOWN AT THE STERN

He is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking a bead on

the steel tanks, silver gleaming in the bloody shark's mouth.

He fires. And fires. Bullets shatter the shark's teeth,

punching holes in the dripping snout.

WIDE ON THE ORCA  EXPLOSION

With a muffled boom, the perfect symmetry of the shark is

suddenly blown apart in a geyser of steel and blood as Brody's

shot hits the pressurized tank. A 30-foot cloud of water,

steel, shark and debris covers the sky.

A gigantic convulsion hurls the Great White's mangled body

into the sea. The Orca slowly begins to turn over in its

death roll.

UNDERWATER

The shark's carcass floating down in a cloud of blood and

debris.

A shadow clouds the waters, and the Orca's mass begins to

slip into the frame.

CLOSE - HOOPER

Emerging from beneath the surface, he raises his mask, spits

out his mouthpiece and kicks toward Brody.

SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER

Brody is holding onto a cushion, barely afloat, relieved the

shark is dead, yet stunned to see Hooper is still alive. The

two men share weak laughter, which soon trails off.

SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER - ANOTHER ANGLE

They swim through the debris, using two barrels as floats,

as dozens of seagulls feast on shark remains on the surface.

HIGH SHOT FROM SHORE

The two tiny, miserable heroes swim ashore as the credits

roll.
