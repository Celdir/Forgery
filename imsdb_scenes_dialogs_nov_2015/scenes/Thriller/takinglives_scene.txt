FADE IN:

INT. BUS STATION - DAY

SUPERIMPOSE:     17 YEARS AGO

Small, Canadian, rural. Just the Native American CASHIER

jotting down sports stats from the paper. MARTIN, 16,

enters. Slight, pale and frail, new clothes, a tag still

hangs from his stiff work jacket. Martin stands in front

of the Cashier a beat. Nervously tugs an earlobe.

Martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties

and carefully counts out three. The Cashier gives Martin

his ticket and change. Points at a bus outside. The

DRIVER loading bags.

INT. BUS - DAY

A half dozen PASSENGERS. Martin steps aboard, takes a

seat. DAN SOULSBY, Martin's age, sits next to him,

offers a hand. Martin shakes.

CONTINUED:

Dan produces a couple beers from his pockets.     Offers

Martin one.

They CLINK CANS. The Driver enters the bus. Unlocks the

airbrakes. Puts the bus in reverse, gives it gas.

BOOM! The ENGINE throws a rod. Horrible GRINDING.

Smoke wafts into the windows. The Driver KILLS the

ENGINE. Silence. Martin and Dan trade looks.

Martin sighs, looks out the window.

WHAT MARTIN SEES

A car rental place.

BACK TO SCENE

Martin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket.

INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Dan drives. JOURNEY ON the RADIO. Martin checks out

Dan's guitar. Dan shows Martin his teeth.

CONTINUED:

Dan rubs his close-cropped hair.

Martin tries the guitar, he's not that good.

INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - DAY

The land rolls endlessly. Martin drives.      Dan plays his

guitar. He's really good.

POW! The CAR HITS a BOTTLE. A front tire deflates.

Martin guides the crippled vehicle to the curb.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The middle of nowhere.    Martin flips a coin.    Heads.

Dan hauls the spare from the trunk.      Sets the jack under

the bumper.

A PICKUP TRUCK approaches.      Still a mile away.

Martin watches Dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron.

The pickup gets closer, a big one.      Heavy with bags of

animal feed. Speeding.

Martin looking at Dan's back. Martin shoves Dan hard,

into the highway. In front of:

THE GRILL OF THE PICKUP

WHAM! It plasters Dan. He goes over the hood, SHATTERS

the front WINDSHIELD. Bounces off, spins like a rag doll

into a ditch.

The pickup has lost control, it rolls.      Several times, a

heaving mass of steel.

CRASH! The TRUCK folds itself around a husky tree.         No

survivors, that's clear.

MARTIN

He can't believe what he has just done.       He takes in the

carnage, tugs at his ear.

EXT. MONTREAL - DAY

SUPERIMPOSE:   PRESENT DAY

ESTABLISHING the river-bound city.      Beautiful.

EXT. ST. LAWRENCE RIVER - DAY

A large Ferry plies the unstoppable waters.     Gliding

toward skyscrapers.

EXT. FERRY PIER - DAY

The signs in French. Crowded with PASSENGERS waiting to

board. As more PASSENGERS pour off the just-docked ship.

A WOMAN runs through the crowd. Terror etched in her

face. She knocks aside several PEOPLE. Runs toward a

row of restaurants. Even in her turmoil, she is

patrician, elegant.

EXT. PIER-SIDE CAFE - DAY

Two BEAT COPS eat at an outdoor table.   Laid back.    The

WOMAN approaches them, frantic.

The COPS trade looks.

INT. MONTREAL PD OFFICE - DAY

An INSPECTOR pours the Woman tea. She has calmed down.

He takes his pen, looking at her statement.

A beat.

The Woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye.

There is something formidable about her.

CONTINUED:

He hands her some forms.

The Woman bristles.     Stands, takes the forms.

EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Deep woods. In the mountains. Near a roaring river.        A

log vacation cabin is being erected by CONSTRUCTION

WORKERS.

A BACK HOE digs a trench. The scoop snags something -- a

wetsuit -- worn by a long dead corpse, twirling slowly,

hanging from the bucket's steel teeth. The BACK HOE

OPERATOR jumps off the huge machine, stares at the

headless body he has just dragged from its grave.

Workers gather and gawk.

INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

INSPECTOR LAVAL and INSPECTOR REYNAUD, rock solid French

Canadians, pin photographs of the body we just saw on the

wall. Laval steps back. Takes in the display.

Reynaud shrugs.    Laval tosses him a Newsweek.

The PHONE RINGS.   Laval answers.

Reynaud's CELL RINGS.

CONTINUED:

Reynaud grabs his coat.     Turns to Laval.

DARKNESS

We hear BREATHING and the SOFT RUSH of a RIVER.        Soft,

rhythmic. Then FOOTSTEPS.

Two eyes open, reflect moonlight.      The FOOTSTEPS drawing

closer.

CLICK!     A FLASHLIGHT turns on.   REVEALING:

EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

GRACE VANDERHOLT lies in the grave where the body was

discovered. It has been excavated by criminologists, the

soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. Grace sits up.

Grace holds out her FBI creds, shielding her eyes from

the bright light.

CLICK.     The LIGHT goes off.   REVEALING Laval and Reynaud.

Reynaud and Laval trade looks, walk toward two UNIFORMS

guarding the site.

CONTINUED:

Grace lays back down. Sighs. Concentrates on the

sounds. The RIVER. WIND in the trees. Then: LAUGHTER

(O.S.).

The policemen have gathered in a chummy knot.    Laval

gestures for them to walk down the road.

ON GRACE

She steps out of the grave. Sits by it. Writes some

notes. Everything glistens in the moonlight, alive.

Grace takes it in for a beat.

Then:   HOWLING, the lonely song of a distant WOLF.

Grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar.

Used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit. Grace

sits by the fire pit.

More HOWLING, CLOSER this time.

Grace looks down river, SEES the glowing eyes of a TIMBER

WOLF staring from a clump of trees. The animal stares a

beat, then runs off. Grace has the chills.

Grace walks quietly toward the trees. Grace just a few

feet away. RUSTLING. She cautiously moves aside a

sapling.

EXT. RIVERBANK - GRACE'S FLASHLIGHT - NIGHT

A TIMBER WOLF nestled amidst the trees gnaws on

something; a HUMAN HEAD.

EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT

Grace stands there alone, the wolf is long gone. She

stoops, pushes aside brush. She finds a hollow under

some roots. Grace CLICKS on her FLASHLIGHT.

WHAT SHE SEES

A human skull stares up from the hollow.     Picked clean,

weathered.

EXT. DIRT ROAD IN THE FOREST - NIGHT

Laval and Reynaud, and the two UNIFORMS smoke and joke.

A quiet beat as the WIND picks up. Their cars up the

road in the b.g.

SOMETHING MOVES in the woods.   Inspector Reynaud draws

his Glock. SHUSHES the men.

A beat. MOVEMENT. Laval signals for the men to spread

out. Holsters are UNSNAPPED. Reynaud is all eyes and

ears as he picks his way toward the trees.

GRACE emerges from the trees, a laser-aiming dot on her

forehead. She REACTS to Reynaud, raises her hands.

Reynaud holsters his gun.   The men relax.   Grace takes

Inspector Laval aside.

Laval REACTS.

INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

Gloved hands carefully remove the skull from a box. The

MEDICAL EXAMINER places the skull on an exam table and

begins cleaning it.

Grace walks around the headless body. The wetsuit has

been removed, the body has been autopsied. Headless,

skeletal hands, the legs are surprisingly well-preserved.

DIRECTOR GILLET is tall, heavy, smoking a cigar.    He's a

cop's cop and all-around nice guy.

CONTINUED:

The Medical Examiner finds two small holes in the skull,

waves the PHOTOGRAPHER over.

She simulates fangs with her hands, they match marks on

the skull.

CONTINUED:

The Medical examiner looks at a chewed vertebrate.

The Medical Examiner examines the skull's teeth.

Inspectors Laval and Reynaud enter. Both give Grace wary

nods. Inspector Laval hands the Medical Examiner a paper

bag marked HUMAN REMAINS.

The Medical Examiner opens the bag. Removes a wig. No,

not a wig; someone's ponytail and leathered scalp.

Tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied

to two pieces of broomstick. The Photographer SNAPS some

shots.

The Medical Examiner gingerly untangles the cord.

Grace crosses, grins.      Grace studies the cord, noting the

intricate knots.

CONTINUED:

Laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages.

Gillet looks at Grace, at the cord. Turns to her

quietly.

A beat.

FRENCH at his two-star Inspectors.

Grace writes notes on a yellow pad. Inspectors Laval and

Reynaud cross, Laval shows her an artist's sketch of the

victim.

CONTINUED:

features, long hair.

Laval has declared peace.      Grace smiles.   Reynaud still

keeps his distance.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A very nice bed and breakfast. Grace enters and finds

her luggage waiting. She loves the room. Antiques, art.

Grace finds a bottle of wine and a note from Gillet. She

smiles. Grace checks the mini fridge; bingo. Cracks a

Moosehead. Her CELL RINGS.

CONTINUED:

Grace hangs up. Makes notes on the sketch.       Slips it

into a picture frame.

INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

Grace, Reynaud and Laval look through a haystack of

computer printouts for needles of information. Grace

stretches. Grabs a donut from a box. Offers the box to

Laval.

Laval gives in, takes a plain cake. She offers donuts to

Reynaud. He rubs his eyes, shoves aside papers, quietly

to Laval:

Grace grabs her jacket and an armful of reports.

INT. BISTRO - DAY

Locals only. The Inspector's favorite spot, they are

like family here. Grace, Laval and Reynaud at a table in

back. Covered with reports and plates. Grace stops

reading. Tosses aside a printout.

CONTINUED:

Laval and Reynaud trade looks.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

The lights are still on, Grace has fallen asleep on her

bed, still in her clothes, paperwork everywhere. Case

photos now fill the picture frames, cover the walls, even

on the ceiling. KNOCKING at the door. Grace stirs.

Crosses to the door, groggy. She checks the peephole.

Cracks the door. It's Inspector Laval.

Cop cars everywhere. Crime scene tape. The Coroner's

van. A couple NEWS CAMERAMEN. Grace crossing with

Laval.

Reynaud places a HANDCUFFED MAN in workout gear in the

back of a cop car.

Reynaud SLAPS the cop car, it quickly drives away. Grace

and Laval arrive at a BODY dressed in sweats. A gym bag

nearby. A pair of UNIFORMS stand guard as a CRIMINALIST

processes the body. Thirty-ish, healthy, his generic

looks marred by bulging, bruised eyes. Face bruised.

Grace squats by the body. CLICKS on her Mag-Lite and

inspects the victim. Bruises on his neck.

CONTINUED:

Grace shines her flashlight along the corpse.      A couple

hairs glow in the strong light beam.

The Criminalist takes a lint roller, collects the hairs.

Grace shines her light under a car. A garrote is there,

made of broomsticks and knotted nylon cord.

Grace looks around the garage.      Taking it all in.

Getting a feel for the scene.

She carefully examines the victim's car with her

flashlight. The door has been brushed with black print

dust.

shirt. Looking through a two-way mirror. Grace, Reynaud

forward, looks Inspector Laval in the eye.

Laval exits the room, shutting the door behind them. A

ROOKIE hands Director Gillet a cup of coffee and a new

dress shirt wrapped in plastic.

the latest crime scene. She drops it in her computer

bag.

Grabs a case file.

Grace crosses, opens the door, enters.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

John Costa smiles at Grace as she enters.        Sets her bag

on the floor. The case file on the desk.

They shake.    She slides typing paper and a pencil over to

Costa.

CONTINUED:

Costa about to start drawing.

Costa looking at Grace a beat.

She takes the list of names. She tips over her briefcase

with her foot, the evidence bag spills out. Costa

glances at the garrote, REACTS.

CONTINUED:

Costa looking at Grace, realizes it's a mind game.

Costa is unambiguously sincere. Grace's attitude softens

a bit. She tucks the garrote back in her bag.

Costa draws a simple smiley face.     He shows her.

Grace crosses to the door.     Costa begins drawing in

earnest.

INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT

Grace emerges from the interrogation room. Reynaud hands

her a printout of Costa's school records. Grace checking

A Rookie crosses with a photo, hands it to Laval.

Laval shows Grace the photo.   It is definitely Costa.    A

beat.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Costa has finished the sketch. He holds it up to the

mirror, for those he assumes are watching.

REFLECTED in the two-way mirror is COSTA'S SKETCH.   Cold

piercing eyes, chiseled features.

see a tough-looking PARAMEDIC unwrapping a cotton swab.

watches the candles burn.

Laval startles.

They cross to the victim's car.

Grace pantomimes unlocking the door, drops the keys and

INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY

Grace and Laval get in, Reynaud guns it.       Grace belts in.

Reynaud leans on the HORN, aggressively maneuvering

through traffic.

Grace opens it and finds a compact Glock.       She checks it,

shoves it into her pocket.

Reynaud swerves into the wrong lane. Stops cold in front

of an apartment building. And gets out. Great driving.

A mere two blocks away from the crime scene.       Laval gets

out. Then Grace.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

An upper floor. Grace, Reynaud and the MANAGER cross to

a door. The Manager studies Costa's sketch of the

attacker.

They arrive at a door. Reynaud about to knock.   Grace

stops him, listening at the door.

Then: The SMOKE ALARM inside the apartment BUZZES O.S.

Reynaud and Laval trade looks. Reynaud cocks a leg...

The Manager unlocks the door a beat before Reynaud kicks

it. Laval is no danger junkie, he's a little hesitant to

enter. Grace gets down low, enters carefully, she knows

what she's doing.

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

It's dark, drawn shades. A small studio. Reynaud and

Grace move tactically with drawn guns. Grace enters the

kitchen. Light smoke.

Reynaud approaches the futon, a person-sized shape under

the blankets. Reynaud whips aside the blanket. Just

pillows.

Grace checks under the sink.

Reynaud checks the bathroom and shower.

A coffee pot smokes, SIZZLING sludge on the bottom.

Grace checks around the fridge, now satisfied no one

lurks in there.

Grace turns off the burner. She crosses to a window,

whips aside the curtains, and opens it. Coughing.

CONTINUED:

Grace looks at a glass of orange juice, a half-eaten

plate of food on the table.

Laval has entered, he stares out the window.      Grace looks

out the window, REACTS.

Holiday cards. A CD titled: "Learn Flamenco Guitar."

Hundreds of practice signatures. Forged documents.

Victim's personal effects.

Reynaud SNAPS pictures of the guitar case.

Grace is absorbing everything this little apartment can

tell her. Bonding with the space. She smells a pillow.

the kitchen table.

to be.

Grace's brow furrows.     Martin has been erased.

the door as rusted HINGES SQUEAL.

INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT

Grace moves aside cobwebs with her big flashlight. The

room is tiny. Exposed joists overhead. Grace sits on

the cold concrete. A sleeping bag rolled in the corner.

One wall is just chicken wire. Her flashlight beam stabs

at the yawning darkness beneath the house.

There is a public school desk chair combo. The name

MARTIN neatly carved into it, then scratched out. A

broken light bulb overhead, its wires running to a corner

of the house.

Grace cautiously unrolls the sleeping bag. A pair of

socks, underwear, T-shirt neatly folded inside. She

rolls it back up. Finds a large jar, picks it up. Very

old feces inside, a makeshift toilet. She sets it down.

Grace pulls the door shut.   And turns off her flashlight.

Pitch black. So quiet.

She sits there, in the musty little cage. Listening to

her BREATHING, to her HEART BEAT. So lonely, so

frightening. A tear rolls down her cheek. She SNIFFLES,

wipes away the tear. A beat. Grace hears SCRATCHING.

She clicks on her light.

SOMETHING moves closer.

MARTIN ASHER exits Costa's office. Closes the door.

APPROACHES CAMERA, nonchalant. His face is clear; the

piercing eyes, the sharp features. Asher EXITS FRAME.

crosses to his office with a cup of coffee. The VIDEO

STOPS. It REWINDS. FREEZES ON ASHER.

Ultra-hip. The dance floor THROBS with CLUBGOERS.      THE

DJ THUMPS a EUROBEAT.

Costa sits at the bar. PEOPLE all around him, jostling

to buy drinks. Two busy BARTENDERS sling booze.

Costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve-

wracking. He twirls the ice in his Scotch with a finger.

Staring at the clock. 1:31 AM. He's nervous, sweat

beads his forehead. A big BARTENDER, an undercover cop,

pours Costa a Scotch.

Costa scratches around the neck of the hot BODY ARMOR.

around. Only sees strange faces.

Costa carefully unfolds the note.       It reads:   "MEET ME IN

THE RESTROOM NOW."

Dingy tiles. DRIPPING FAUCET. Several stalls.

The room seems empty. Costa swallows, bends down.

Checks under the stalls. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing...

Then. Something. At the far stall. A pair of men's

shoes. Black. Polished. Facing the stall door.

Waiting...

Costa freezes.     Backs away as...

The stall door slowly swings open. HINGES CREAK.        A

foot, a trouser cuff. A leg stepping out...

bar. Costa exhales.        A bundle of nerves.

Costa eyes him.

order. Steps back. Something isn't right.

The Carpenters looking out the window.

Costa hears a POLICE RADIO. Spins around. Grace and

Reynaud have entered. Costa is apprehensive. What now?

Grace gives him a reassuring smile.

She waves him out of earshot of the Carpenters.     Their

A few minutes later Costa finds Grace at the turntables

looking through the DJ's records.

hair.

SOMEONE BEHIND HIM

Costa looks in the mirror and REACTS.

MARTIN ASHER stares at him from the mirror. No doubt who

it is. Asher is wound tight, not at all happy.

Asher jams a gun in Costa's back.        Costa is very scared.

DANCERS.

FIND GRACE --

She and Reynaud scan the moving bodies for Asher. Grace

GLIMPSES the back of Asher's head. Grace and Reynaud

tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a

bonding moment.

Asher is an arm's length ahead of Grace. She reaches

out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt. Asher

turns...

IT'S NOT ASHER.

Grace shoves him aside and moves on. She SEES a

disturbance up ahead. Grace shoulders her way through

the crowd.

Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance.    They

cleave through ONLOOKERS to reveal...

A FIGHT

Two drunk COLLEGE JOCKS slug it out. Grace looks around;

no Asher. Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the

Jocks, hurls him to the ground. Six UNIFORMS swarm in

Dangerous and cold.     They track Grace as she moves

through the crowd.

Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins making out with

her.

complies.

Spacious, lofty.     Costa and Grace enter.

Cool art, sketches, images all over the walls.

Reminiscent of Grace's hotel room. And a very cool view

of downtown.

Grace taking everything in. Art books, sketch pads.

Piled high on the desk. She looks at the ceiling. SEES

notes and sketches taped up. Grace laughs to herself.

Grace looking at a drawing on the wall.       Costa winces, he

didn't want her to notice it.

giggling.

This is goodbye.     Neither of them feels very good about

it.

stretching for Costa. Driving him nuts.

Grace holds out her hand.      They shake.

Costa leans across her, braces himself against the wall.

A bold move. Now they are eye to eye. Grace kisses

door.

Laval watches the plumber KNOCKING a couple doors down.

Costa and Laval cross to unmarked #1.

The plumber approaches them.     Costa looking at him,

couch. Begins undressing him.

She finds horrible dog-bite scars.

Costa pulls Grace to her feet.

Grace retreating. Step by step across the room. Costa.

Pursuing. Slowly. Determined. The heat. The immediacy

building.

Costa grabs her. Pushing her. Up against the wall.            The

phone CLATTERS to the floor. Grace's eyes widen.

Two mouths. Inches apart. Costa's hand reaches up her

skirt. Exploring. Grace swallows. His hand reaching

into her panties.

Grace's eyes looking away. As she grabs his arm.

Pulling. Pushing. Wanting. Her mouth. Avoiding his.

Their breath mingling. Until. Costa's lips crush down

on hers. The kiss devouring. Knocking pictures off the

walls. Grace's hands pulling him closer.

Costa picks her up. Throws her on the bed. He tears at

her blouse. Her white lace bra. Grace's back arching.

Her legs wrapping around him. As her eyes flutter open.

Looking up at the ceiling, she gasps.

Costa stops. Turns. To see what she's looking at.

Surprised to see pictures of Asher's victims, the crime

scenes. Staring down at them.

Costa has been standing there. Listening. He tries to

read Grace's expression, worry etching his face.

Grace is looking at Costa, her mind racing a million

miles an hour.

Grace's world crumbles as she puts it together.

Costa gasps.        The very thought is painful.

Costa hoping against hope everything is okay.          But it's

not okay. Grace has a calamitous expression.

Costa takes a step toward her. The street cop motions

for Costa to stay back. Costa REACTS.

pistol visible.

INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

Costa takes the gun from her purse, pockets it, along

something much more menacing. The monster Martin Asher.

Grace looks him dead in the eye, more angry than scared.

(NOTE:   Costa will now be called ASHER.)

CONTINUED:

determination. He turns, enters a stairwell and exits

the building. Grace's heart is breaking.

She kicks the wall and gives chase, runs into the

stairwell.

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Asher gets into Grace's unmarked.      And drives away.

Grace exits the building, watches him go.

Grace has no way to follow.     Then...

nutcase. Grace dials her cell phone.

Grace hands the cell phone to the Cop.

Her CELL RINGS. Grace looks at it.        Sees OUT OF AREA on

the caller ID. She answers.

A beat.   Grace grabs the big .45 by her thigh.

There is a strange tension in her voice. She hangs up.

Turns off the TV. She gets off the bed, crosses to a

corner. She sits, settles in for a long vigil.

Wintertime. It's an ice storm. Freezing rain

accumulates on existing snow and ice. Grace loading her

supplies into her truck. It's miserable out and getting

worse.

HONKING. Grace turns to watch a car slowly sliding

helpless across the ice. It stops just short of hitting

a parked car.

Old and falling apart. Overgrown with branches. The

wind picking up. Grace's truck slowly navigating the

The accumulating ice is beautiful but deadly. Grace

drives with extreme caution, picking through the ice in

low gear. She drives around a fallen tree branch.

Grace turns OFF the RADIO.     Turns on the defroster.

SOMETHING MOVING.

WHAM!

Her WINDSHIELD SHATTERS.     Grace REACTS.

A tree branch overburdened with ice has fallen on her

truck.

The truck slides across the ice. Grace fights to regain

control, to keep it out of the ditch.

Grace stops.     Gets out.   Pulls the branch off the hood.

EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

The last remnant of the once-proud Vanderholt holdings.

Assaulted by rain and sleet. She slips on the ice.

INT. OLD FARMHOUSE - DAY

Restored. Filled with family heirlooms.      Another family

that has decayed from glory.

Grace enters. Dripping wet. She turns OFF the ALARM.

Then hangs up her heavy jacket. Bone tired.

Grace crosses to the kitchen.

INT. OLD FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Grace takes a Glock from her pocket and sets it on the

counter. She pours water into a kettle.

CONTINUED:

Puts the kettle on the stove. Turns on the stove.         Grace

notices water on the kitchen floor. Wait. Wet

footprints.

Grace REACTS.     Reaches for the Glock.

A hand lands on top of her hand.      It's MARTIN ASHER.

CLICK!   He snaps a handcuff around Grace's wrist.

Asher has the upper hand, he spins her, pulls her down

into a chair. She throws a punch. Asher blocks it.

Asher yanks on her cuffed arm.       SMACK!   Grace slaps him.

Asher pulls her into a chair. CLICK! Grace is now

cuffed to the chair. She struggles futilely against the

cuffs.

Asher catches his breath.

Grace stop struggling.       Asher looking at her huge belly.

Asher is happy to see her.

Grace looking at him. Still astonished to see him.         Her

arms behind her back, her belly is so vulnerable.

CONTINUED:

Asher takes out a couple passports, a pair of driver's

licenses.

Asher slides a woman's wedding ring across the table.

Already inscribed.

Grace looking at Asher, not sure whether to laugh out

loud or start crying. He seems edgy; he needs her

decision quick.

Grace reacts. She can respect that. Grace looking at

Asher. He's scary, feeding off some fantasy about her.

CONTINUED:

Grace tilts her lips, looking in his eyes. Asher leans

over to kiss her. Slow, delicate. Asher kneels beside

her, the kisses become hungry, desperate.

Grace's eyes are so open, so vulnerable.

Asher leans in to kiss her...

Grace head-butts him.    CRUNCH!   Smashes his nose.

She drives her feet down and her shoulder into his chest.

Asher, already on his knees, falls back.

Grace scrambles over him, gets out of the chair.       She

shoulders over the kitchen table...

There is a holster mounted underneath the table.

Grace turns her back so she can grab the gun from it.

Grace REACTS.     There is no gun in the holster.

Asher looking at her, matter of fact:

Asher stands, reaches for the Glock on the counter.

Grace can't let him get it. She lunges at Asher,

collides into his knees, hurting him.

Asher grabs a large knife from the butcher's block.

THWACK!   Plunges it into Grace's belly.

Grace GASPS, looking at the knife embedded in her stomach.

A beat as Grace and Asher stare at the knife.

Grace uses the pause to kick away from Asher.       She gets

on her feet and runs from the kitchen.

EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Grace exits the kitchen door, running with her hands

cuffed behind her. Running for her life.

She runs for the nearby woods. Her shoes CRUNCHING

through a layer of fresh ice over old snow. Fighting for

balance.

POP-POP-POP! Asher OPENS FIRE on her from the house.

BULLETS HIT the ice around her.

Grace runs into the woods.   Branches sheathed in ice.

Smacking her face.

Asher exits the house, FIRING -- POP-POP-POP-POP!

BULLETS EXPLODE the ice around Grace. She dives to the

ground. She takes the opportunity to move her handcuffs

from behind to in front.

She unties and removes the heavy prosthetic belly she

wears. Grace is not pregnant. She pulls the knife out.

Grace runs deeper into the woods.

Asher running in the woods behind her. The gun in his

hand at the ready. Asher is hunting. He intends to kill

her.

ON GRACE

Running. Batting away ice-covered branches.     Drenched

with sleet. Hypothermic conditions.

EXT. OLD PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT

Grace emerges from the woods. Running along the icy

road. She slips and falls. Cuts her hand on the ice.

Grace stands, and keeps running, her hand bleeding, the

knife getting slippery.

ON ASHER

Gaining on her. Grace slips again, scrabbling on the

ice, trying to keep moving. A slow motion nightmare.

Here comes Asher.   No mercy.   He aims the gun at her

face...

CONTINUED:

Grace raises her hands to protect her face...

POP! Asher FIRES. DING! The BULLET intended for

Grace's forehead hits the knife -- RICOCHETS into the

trees.

A beat.   Grace looking at the now-creased knife.

Asher's gun is out of rounds.     The slide is locked back

on an empty chamber.

SWICK! Grace slices Asher's legs with the knife.          Slices

each shin deeply.

Asher kicks the knife from her hand. Then kicks her in

the face. He tries to kick her again but she grabs his

leg.

WHAM! Asher slips, hits the ice hard. Grace is on top

of him, wraps the handcuffs around his neck. Wraps her

legs around his body.

Grace chokes Asher for all he's worth. His eyes bulge,

his face reddens as he meets the same fate as his

victims. Asher has a seizure as his oxygen depleted

brain dies.

Grace doesn't let go. A long death embrace. Finally,

when she is sure, Grace releases from Martin Asher's

body.

She checks his pulse.    He's dead.    Grace stands.

The rain falling on her. Ice and moonlight. Grace spits

blood, looks around. Looks at Asher's corpse.

Walks back toward the house.      Alone.   Strong.   Whole.
