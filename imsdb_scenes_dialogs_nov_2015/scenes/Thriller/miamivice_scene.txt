FADE IN:

EXT. OCEAN - CLOSE UP:  WATER - MORNING LIGHT

We are at the delicate interface between ocean and

air...liquid and gas...the event horizon where molecules

evaporate.  This interchange is ethereal.  Then, low

frequencies rumble through depths...louder...closer, now...

And the ocean surface is torn by a 46-foot catamaran and the

ROAR of 2,700 horsepower, rocketing at us at 140 knots...

OFFSHORE RACER:  "BORN TO WIN"

in PROFILE.

AERIAL:  "BORN TO WIN"

...has a canopy, low like a B-1 bomber and extends a half

mile.  It launches off two-foot swells, goes airborne, pushes

to 150 knots with another 1,100 RPM left...

INT. RACE BOAT - SONNY CROCKETT

pilots the "Born to Win" in full helmet.  On the throttle and

flaps is RICARDO TUBBS...

EXT. OCEAN - "BORN TO WIN"

leads the frontrunners towards a finish line demarcated by a

couple of $10 million yachts loaded with media.  At the last

moment occurs a small power loss, and "Born to Win" gets

nosed into second place by the 46-foot Skater, "Goddess"...

EXT. MARINA - "BORN TO WIN" - LATER

thunders to the dock, throttled down at low revs.  The canopy

is up.  Crockett and Tubbs' helmets are off.  Dockhands tie

it off.  It's the same crowd you catch at a Grand Prix:  nine-

figure money, tall, Northern Italian women and minor German

princesses with Swiss educations, no bimbos and no questions

about asset origins.  The exception is "Born to Win's"

sponsor, a blonde, dreadlocked, bearded 6'4" SWITEK.  He

looks like a dot-com entrepreneur who got out in time.  Next

to him is a blonde Ukranian lady with high cheekbones.  We'll

see her again.

WINNING CIRCLE - CROCKETT + TUBBS

in second position to the Japanese driver and throttle man of

"Goddess," neither of whom speak English.  The #3 boat,

"Bicardi Silver," was driven by David Scott and throttled by

John Tomlinson...

CROCKETT + TUBBS

leave the winning circle among Asian and Mexican

billionaires.  As the small crowd breaks up...

A DEEPLY-TANNED PLAYER

named NICHOLAS in Vuarnet wraparounds and buzz-cut white hair

glides by...

Whatever Nicholas is soliciting, Crockett and Tubbs don't

want.  (Nicholas brokers "go-fast" runs, moving loads from

offshore into South Florida.  Among guys who pilot offshore

race boats, there are one or two who've never run a load, but

no one's found them yet.)  Meanwhile...

INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - A KITCHEN - NIGHT

A couple-hundred-thousand-dollars worth of granite and steel.

Off-screen a restaurant-grade Sub-Zero opens with a hiss.

Fan starts.  Beyond the kitchen we SEE through a dining room

to a den.  A chair is overturned.  We HEAR muffled sounds.

We SEE feet extend through a door jamb.  Someone's on the

floor.  A television is playing, distantly.

INT. DEN - SEE FAMILY PICTURES

so close they almost come to life.  A Venezuelan family, two

boys and a girl in a pool.  Maria, Alonzo, the two boys at

their sister's baptism.  And we see holding the baby daughter

is Riccardo Tubbs.

A family dinner at a South American restaurant.  Tubbs sits

with the youngest daughter on his lap.  Maria is on the other

side of him.  This is the image that almost comes to life.

We hear the vivacious latin ambience late on a Sunday

afternoon when families take the grandparents and have

dinner.

INT. KITCHEN - SUB ZERO REFRIGERATOR

MOVE from the bright glare of the interior ONTO

the broad neck of a MAN.  A Viking is tattooed there.  The

image morphs into a naked woman presenting her rear to a

muscled biker next to a chopper above a swastika residing

between shoulder blades.  SS lightning bolts are on his neck.

PULL BACK from this MAN, who is bent into the frig because

he's hungry.  His head is shaved and he's naked from the

waist up.  A BLACK HEFTY GARBAGE BAG is tied around his

waist.  Yellow industrial gloves are on his hands.  Something

bad is happening in this house...

INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

It's a Sikorski skimming across the water of Biscayne Bay on

a moonlit night at living-room level past stilt houses.

RICARDO TUBBS

pilots the chopper past the brightly lit windows of high-rise

Collins Avenue condos for the fugitive rich...and heads

towards the MacArthur Causeway.

In the back - her long copper legs stretched out under a

short skirt - is GINA CALABRESE.

Wearing enough of nothing to hide the micro .380, which Gina

checks right now.  There's a round in the chamber.

AERIAL:  THE SIKORSKI crosses past the stacks of $5 million

condos to a landing pad on a roof.  The Miami of the '80's,

that twilight-zone frontier built on coke-fueled cash flow,

is over.  The frontier development stage is passed.  It has

BECOME Casablanca.  Anything goes; everything has a price.

EXT. ROOFTOP LANDING PAD - WIDE

The chopper rockets in, settles.

INT. UTILITY STAIRCASE

Crockett, Tubbs and Gina descend to the 25th-floor penthouse,

the target.  As Crockett and Tubbs continue down to 24, she

looks over her shoulder at Tubbs...

INT. SURVEILLANCE APARTMENT (ONE FLOOR BELOW THE TARGET)

PENTHOUSE - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

enter.  Two surveillance technicians, RICK and FRANK, are

glued to a monitor showing a bedroom in which nothing

happens.  LT. CASTILLO is there, out of a past somewhere

between CIA and the Jesuits...

Referring to the monitor on which there are NO PEOPLE in an

EMPTY BEDROOM.

They are watching air move.

They exit to...

INT. PENTHOUSE CONDO - CROCKETT + TUBBS

are met at the door by security, who recognizes them, and are

welcomed by their host, UGO.  This is the Baccardi Cup After-

Party.  The same players from the marina...

OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS

enter an 8,000-square-foot penthouse...offshore racer types,

players, So Bee models...

Crockett wanders off...

CROCKETT

approaches a bar and female bartender...

She's beautifully bronzed.

Gina's listening on her personal comms.

Gina rolls her eyes as she crosses by Tubbs.

TRUDY JOPLIN is a tall African-American.  She whispers into a

small mic.  If you looked closely, she's ripped...as if steel

cables moved under her smooth skin.  She slides past Tubbs

and Gina...

SWITEK

all white bling, is arguing with his blade-thin, glassy-eyed,

adrenaline junkie partner, ZITO.  Approaching is "Miss

Ukraine."  High cheekbones suggest one of Genghis Khan's

horsemen found her maternal ancestor as attractive as Switek

finds her...

Tubbs clocks three beefy Russians in a corner, one is

unusually fit.

MISS UKRAINE brings Switek his glass of champagne...  She

whispers something in his ear...and is led towards a back

bedroom.  Gina ambles over.

Tubbs opens his Moto as if he's about to make a call...Trudy

looks over his shoulder.  What we see is the feed from the

monitor in the surveillance room downstairs.

CLOSER: TUBBS'S MOTO

Two blonde people starting to get naked.  Switek and Miss

Ukraine.  A second call comes in.  Tubbs ignores it.

THEIR FACES.  They watch.  And...Crockett's cell phone rings.

He separates from the group...

EXT. BALCONY - CROCKETT - NIGHT

enters.  He's come outside to hear better.

In the background Gina shakes her head about Switek.  He blew

it.  Trudy looks at Crockett and sees Crockett's focused,

hearing...

INT. BENTLEY - ALONZO STEVENS - NIGHT

He's cruising at 85.  He's floating in a magnolia leather

interior.  But it's bloodstained from his nose and mouth.

He's been beaten.  His white shirt is torn.  He doesn't

care...

Crockett's alarmed.  He catches Tubbs' eye and waves him

outside...

Tubbs joins Crockett on the balcony.

Crockett's phone goes dead.

Crockett's entering a number while...

Meanwhile Crockett HEARS...

Crockett compels himself to be patient.  Meanwhile, Tubbs has

struck out with Alonzo's home phone.

Meanwhile...

EXT. ABANDONED METAL SHED, INDIAN RIVER - WIDE - NIGHT

Nothing.  Rusting marine parts and corrugated metal fall into

weeds next on a channel of the Indian River.  It cuts through

inner-city Miami.  Distant noise.  But...

INT. METAL SHED - ARYAN BROTHERS

in low light are strapping up.  Kevlar vests go over tattooed

arms and chests.  Glimpses of swastikas.  Handguns in

waistbands.  SMGs (Small Machine Guns) slung from shoulders

over white shirts, business-suit jackets.  Everybody wears

surgical gloves.  Shoes are industrial.

REAR SHOT:  TWO OF THE BROTHERS

are leaving.  One carries a very long rifle with a flash

suppressor.  It is a bolt action .50 caliber Burrows.

NEARBY ON THE RIVER

is a second Aryan Brother sniper team with an identical

weapon aimed at an empty lot a thousand yards away across the

Indian River...

INT. METAL SHED

Two Suburbans and an Escalade pull out...

EXT. INDIAN RIVER - EMPTY LOT

Caribbean freighters seized by US Customs rust at the bank.

MOVE IN.  Two Cadillacs are parked.  Waiting.  A door opens.

An interior light comes on.  MOVE CLOSER.  Two Russian

slickster types.  Patient.  One looks at a watch.  The other

triggers his cell phone.  A meeting is imminent.

INT. FBI OFFICE - RAC JAMES FUJIMA - NIGHT

Empty except for the FBI Agent in a sweatsuit carrying files,

as if he stopped by when Crockett's call came in.  He's on a

computer.  He picks up the phone...

Crockett puts his Nextel on "speaker" so Tubbs can hear, too.

Crockett's impatient.

INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. CHOPPER - SWITEK + ZITO

in the back seat get lucky.  The pilot reacts as the

TECHNICIAN in the copilot seat has picked up a signal from

the FIREFLY...the LOCATOR...on Alonzo's Bentley.

INT. BLACK SIKORSKY CHOPPER - CROCKETT + TUBBS

Tubbs pilots it while Crockett gets the location of Alonzo's

car and repeats it into the headset to Tubbs as the...

EXT. SKY OVER MIAMI - C + T'S SIKORSKY - NIGHT

banks hard left and heads for north 95 towards Lauderdale.

Meanwhile...

EXT. INDIAN RIVER - WIDE:  THE DEAL - NIGHT

Three Aryan Brothers in business suits get out of the rear of

the Escalade and Suburban with a driver in each.  Our two

"Russians" approach from their Cadillac with a backup

Cadillac and one driver on the other side.

CLOSER:  ARYAN BROTHERS.  Friendly.  Hip-hop culture has

invaded White Supremacist gangs.  Buzz cuts.  Goatees.  A

couple of diamond earrings.

The Aryan Brother pops him a couple of vials.

One of the Russians puts his hand on a weapon as the other

opens up a Nike sports bag.

Aryan Brother #1 reaches into the bag at the wrapped stacks

of hundreds.  Flips through a couple, takes one or two at

random.  Russian nods for him to go ahead.

WIDEN.  Everybody goes back to their cars.  As the two

"Russians" get into theirs, Aryan Brother #1 turns from the

running board of the Escalade with his driver's door open.

He looks at his partner and nods, who says something into a

Nextel.

For the Russians in the car, time freezes.  As they start

to react, they're blown up by .50 caliber rounds from the two

sniper positions.  The .50 caliber rounds go right through

car bodies, sheet metal, upholstery, glass, human flesh,

bone, more upholstery and metal and out the other end.

Another round goes through the passenger door, through the

passenger, through the driver, out the driver door and into

the night...

WIDE

The three Aryan Brothers approach the steaming cars with the

chopped-up occupants and take the gym bag full of cash.  The

Escalade driver dons night-vision goggles.  They load up and

drive off as we hear the "thump, thump" of Air Support and

some distant sirens.  Meanwhile...

INT. MIAMI-DADE CHOPPER - SWITEK + ZITO - NIGHT

at 170 knots watching a thermographic image of Alonzo

Stevens' car on a monitor weave through traffic northbound on

the 95...  SEE Tubbs' Sikorsky beyond Switek + Zito as it

swoops from a higher altitude right past the Miami-Dade

chopper, banks and dives for the freeway.

EXT. FREEWAY

Tracking with Stevens' Bentley from the front.

The black Sikorsky is almost on the Bentley's hood.  Tubbs

racks the chopper sideways so that Alonzo can see Crockett in

the copilot seat...

CLOSER:  CROCKETT

has his handgun out and is waving Alonzo over to the

shoulder.  Tubbs keeps the chopper almost blocking Alonzo's

Bentley.  Alonzo pulls over.  Tubbs wheels around and lands

on the shoulder.  They approach...

ALONZO STEVENS

exits the Bentley and walks toward Crockett and Tubbs.  He

holds his hand out to keep them at a distance.

Freeway traffic roars past.  Crockett and Tubbs don't get too

close, heeding Alonzo's warning...

Stevens takes a low-resolution E-mailed image from his pocket

and hands it to Tubbs.  Tubbs looks up, shocked, hands it to

Crockett.  Stevens' head rotates loosely on his

shoulders...his mind's elsewhere...

CROCKETT'S POV:  IMAGE

Alonzo's wife, Francine, is bound - clothes torn - to a chair

in a TV room.  On the floor are two young boys bound with

plastic ties.  Paper bags are over their heads.  Francine's

eyes are as large as saucers.  Around her neck is a necklace

of C-4 explosive connected to a detonator.

INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - TRUDY - NIGHT

and a Miami PD SWAT team crash through the front door.

Another team through the back.  Trudy in a tactical vest is

second in with a 12-gauge.  The house is empty.  Gina and

other detectives hang in the rear.  First SWAT team "clears"

the living room, dining room.  Second clears the kitchen,

maid's quarters...

INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - DOOR TO DEN - NIGHT

...last room to clear...center of the house.  SWAT teams

appear around corners.  Weapons up.  The looks on their faces

tell us nobody is here...nobody alive...and what they see

gives even these veterans pause as blood pools around the

legs of a family and overturned chairs.  Alonzo didn't save

anyone.

EXT. FREEWAY - TUBBS

on police radio listens to a message from Trudy while...

Now Alonzo knows.

Alonzo Stevens has a strange look in his eyes.  He looks at

Crockett and Tubbs, as if to say something.  He doesn't.

Crockett and Tubbs walk towards him, to reach him...to

console him...

BUT ALONZO STEVENS

backs away.  Looks at them sadly.  And before they can stop

him, he steps out onto the freeway, opens his arms, and

embraces the front bumper of a 70 m.p.h. 18-wheeler.

INT. MERCEDES CL-500 - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

Grim, silent, race through Miami traffic to the crime scene

we know is ahead because...

OVER TUBBS' SHOULDER we see all the lights from two dozen

emergency vehicles a quarter mile ahead.  Death is not

procedural or casual, not when it's somebody you know, like

an informant you worked cases with.  Cell phone rings.

INT. PARKING STRUCTURE, TOP FLOOR - ANGRY MEN - 3 A.M.

in a concrete space.  We've entered mid-scene.

Pause.

Fujima boots up his military-spec laptop to view the FLIR

video.  Meanwhile...

Fujima's Dell laptop glows to life.  Two almost

indistinguishable boats and their wakes are SEEN.

Crockett's attention goes to something atypical he spots

about the wake emerging behind each boat.  He exchanges a

look with Tubbs.  But they say nothing.

Fujima splits.  Castillo waits until Fujima's car pulls away.

...and is now compartmentalized in the past.

It's a rhetorical question.

EXT. INDIAN RIVER - THERMAL IMAGE OF TWO DEEP V-HULL GO-FAST

BOATS - NIGHT

They're two feet out of the water on their dry dock, next to

a Marine Shed.

It's an unlikely location because derelict factories, cheap

apartments, weeds and marine scrap metal are the

neighborhood.

EXT. SURVEILLANCE LOCATION - CROCKETT + TUBBS

and a SWAT team in the weeds across the river.  They include

SGT. JEAN-LOUIS BASTIDE, a Haitian in dark sweats.  They all

are in plain clothes.

We don't know what that means, yet.

INT. MARINE SHED - DOOR - NIGHT

Both steel doors EXPLODE as if their molecular structure,

itself, disintegrated from one BLAST of Tubbs M-40 grenade-

launcher firing a canister of ball bearings like a king-size

shotgun on steroids as...

GUARDS

react, but Crockett draws down on one with an AK-47.  Bastide

wounds the second GUARD who had drawn down his H & K.  A

Third Guard begs to live in French Patois.  They own the

place.  And Crockett sees...

800 individually-wrapped bricks of North Valle Colombian

cocaine are on a table.

Suburban crashes through the wreckage of the door and backs

to the table.  Jean-Louis and SWAT #1 start throwing bricks

into the back.  Tubbs with Crockett exit.

EXT. MARINE SHED - DRY DOCK - CROCKETT + TUBBS

approach the two deep V-hull go-fast boats with three engines

off the back.  Tubbs cracks the breech of the grenade

launcher and loads a 40-millimeter shell, while he strolls

down the dock...

CROCKETT

tosses two Willie Peters (white phosphorus grenades) into the

boats.  Tubbs fires the M-40 at a third boat, which explodes

flame, followed by...

TWO CARNATIONS OF WHITE PHOSPHORESCENCE

destroy the smuggler's Strykers, which we saw in Fujima's

video.  Crockett + Tubbs have just put Sal Maguda out of

business.  They walk away and around the side of the shed,

disregarding the curious citizens of Little Haiti, come to

watch the fireworks...

INT. MERCEDES CL 600 ON A MIAMI STREET - CROCKETT + TUBBS -

BRILLIANT DAYLIGHT

drive.  Crockett reaches into a paper bag full of cell phones

and grabs one.  He dials up a number, grabs another and hands

it to Tubbs.

Crockett struck out.  While...

INT. COLLINS AVENUE CONDO - NICHOLAS - DAY

...the guy with the white hair.

EXT. LA PERLA DISTRICT OF SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - TWILIGHT

Corrosion and decay.  People look coldly at us.  Malevolence

and malefaction on every corner.  No one's picked up the

garbage for a month.  Poverty in the Caribbean half-light...

CROCKETT & TUBBS

cross the street to CAMERA from their rental car.  The La

Perla section was a 16th Century haven for pirates.  It's had

little civic improvements in 400 years.

They enter a nightclub - shabby neon.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - CROCKETT + TUBBS - TWILIGHT

There are no customers.  They're cautious.  Men stop them

and frisk them.  They expected that.

They're waved to the rear.  They start towards a back table.

A small group of people wait...

OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS APPROACHING:  JOSE "COCHI LOCO" YERO

He's a former right-wing Colombian paramilitary from the

North Valle near the Pacific coast.  He runs operations,

communications and security.  He has cold eyes and a corpulent

face.  He's notorious for using torture to ferret-out

informants.  Right now he watches these two Americans

approach.  Security people are on either side of him.

As Crockett sits, he notices that at a table a few to the

side is a woman.  This is ISABELLA.  Behind glasses, she

seems immobile, filled with intelligence, well-dressed in

subdued Tom Ford and staring at him.  Reading him.  Crockett

holds the look that extra beat and turns back to business...

He's security, not a fucking waiter.  But Yero nods.

Security fetches coffee, anyway.

Tubbs looks at Crockett.  They thought it was a done deal.

Isabella tilts her head imperceptibly.

Yero's security reacts to the tone and raises weapons.  A few

start up out of their chair as...

ZITO + SWITEK

appear at the door, SMGs from shoulder straps.  Zito flips a

D14 hand grenade which Crockett snatches out of the air,

pulls the pin and slams on the table.  Everyone FREEZES.

Only Crockett's hand pressure restrains the clip.

Tubbs rips open Yero's shirt.

Yero's shirt...open to the waist.  No wire.  Yero's furious.

Yero's people have weapons pointed their way.  They outnumber

Switek and Zito.  Slack's taken up on triggers.  It's on the

edge.  And the edge is overloaded.  Tubbs reads that, warns

Yero...

Yero gestures his security to calm down....one notch.

Crockett and Tubbs still hold the grenades.

Then Crockett opens his shirt.  No wires.  So does Tubbs.

Pause.

Isabella sits, watching this.  She drinks her coffee.

Isabella watches Crockett...

Everything goes from tense to lethal.  Has Yero made them?

Crockett flips the hand grenade and catches it with his left

hand...and he drops it in front of Jose Yero.  It spins on

the table.  He had reinserted the pin.  And they back out.

INT. MIAMI SAFE HOUSE - TUBBS IN THE SHOWER - NIGHT

Contemplative.  Offscreen a door opens.  Entering is Gina

Calabrese.  She's naked.  She washes his back.  She dumps too

much shampoo on his head.  He tries to clear it from his

eyes.  Laughs.  They start to make love under the water, in

the steam, through the misted glass, offscreen we hear an

engine rumble...

CLOSER:  GINA

Somebody's coming.

Tubbs and Gina are not random lovers, they're in love.  The

look in her eyes, the openness is pure femininity behind the

Bronx presentation.  She smiles, touches the side of his

face.

EXT. SAFE HOUSE, ON THE INDIAN RIVER - CROCKETT - NIGHT

ties up a 75' Sun Seeker.  It looks like a 38' deep-V

offshore racer on growth hormones.  Crockett's alone, as dusk

fades over the '60's ranch house on the river.  It's under

tropical trees, with one strip of white neon utility lighting

outlining the flat eave.

INT. SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - CROCKETT

let himself in.  He's at a kitchen stool at the counter when

Tubbs enters in sweats.

Gina enters in a robe...

Crockett pulls out three overly-large cell phones...

Tubbs and Crockett look at the Mac screen as Gina boots it

up.  Gina's fingers tap dance on the keyboard.

INT. LIVING ROOM - BAD 3 AM TELEVISION - LATER

No one's watching it.

INT. BEDROOM - GINA

asleep.  Tubbs' eyes are wide open, staring...

INT. SECOND BEDROOM - ECU:  PAGER

lights up.  Beeps.  Crockett's hand grabs it.  It's the

summons from Jose Yero.

INT. KITCHEN - GINA - PRE-DAWN

He leans over and kisses her.  She holds firmly the back of

his neck and looks into his eyes.

He winks at her in assurance and he's gone.  Her lazy smile

drops off.  "Careful"...she's not so sure he will be...

INT. LEAR 55 JET - TUBBS PILOTS

Crockett in the copilot seat.  Switek and Zito are in the

back, barely awake.  Zito hands out coffee.  Switek's

stashing weapons behind the fuselage upholstery.  Tubbs is

clearing US air space as we...

EXT. SKY - AERIAL:  LEAR JET

rockets through cumulonimbus against a black sky up to 35,000

feet.

EXT. PORT-AU-PRINCE AIRPORT, RUNWAY - LEAR JET - DAWN

touches down, drives towards us...  Turns towards commercial

aviation facility...

CLOSER:  HATCH

opens.  Switek and Zito emerge to rental cars with two car-

rental clerks waiting...

INT. PORT-AU-PRINCE HOTEL ROOM - DOOR - DAY

Crockett and Tubbs make a careful entry.  Hands on weapons,

carrying bags...

We see TRADECRAFT.  They clear the room.  They check for bugs

and external surveillance.  They pull curtains.  Tubbs from a

bag pulls a scanner.  Under the two beds.  Behind the

picture.  The lamp.  The telephone.  Meanwhile...

CROCKETT

"traps" the room to reveal if it had been searched while they

were gone.  He aligns the suitcase perfectly parallel on the

bench.  A matchstick goes against the closed closet door.  A

ballpoint pen is leaned against the telephone.

From his bag Tubbs pulls a Smith & Wesson J-frame hammerless

in .357 Magnum.  He holsters this on his ankle.  A Remington

780 shotgun with pistol grip, sawed-off to a 12-inch barrel

gets slung on a bungee-cord shoulder strap under his right

arm.  .9mm under his shirt in his waistband and two spare

magazines clipped to his belt.

CROCKETT

loads a .45 "race" gun with rounded sights and a magna-ported

barrel, cross-drawn, and a blunt .45 Para-Ordnance in the

small of his back.  They're ready.

INT. CORRIDOR - THEIR DOOR

opens.  Crockett "traps" that door, too, with a small piece

of tape.

CROCKETT + TUBBS

All of it tells us that where they are and where they're

going is a high wire act without a net.  No backup.  Their

badges don't work.  There is no law; there is no order.  They

are in a state of nature where people get killed for their

shoes.

EXT. PORT-AU-PRINCE CEMETERY (HAITI) - CROCKETT + TUBBS -

LATE AFTERNOON

wait.  Shadows on white limestone monuments.  Bird songs.

WHITE MAUSOLEUMS - DUSK

They wait.  And wait.  And nothing happens.

Still apprehensive, concluding they're victims of a "no-

show"...

They split.

INT. HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - CROCKETT + TUBBS -

TWILIGHT

approach their door.  Crockett stops.  The tape "trap" is

torn.  Weapons appear in their hands.  Someone's been here.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CROCKETT + TUBBS

enter stealthily.  Then, they relax.  They need not have

bothered being so careful about detecting a clandestine

surveillance.

OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS

The room is overtly destroyed.  Not one piece of furniture is

unbroken.  Walls have been opened.  Pictures ripped.

Curtains.  Their stuff's strewn all over.  And, then...

DOORS CRASH

in.  HAITIAN PARAMILITARY in soccer jerseys and shorts with

assault rifles...

BEDROOM DOORWAY - FOUR MORE PARAMILITARY

AK's are aimed at Crockett and Tubbs' heads.  Crockett's .45

and his Para-Ordnance are in each hand.  Tubbs' shotgun is

aimed at the front door, his .9mm at the men streaming in the

windows.  Frozen moment.  A woman's voice...

Crockett + Tubbs put down their weapons.

Isabella says something in French.  The Cops ease-up.

Isabella's personal security frisks Crockett + Tubbs and

remain.  Paramilitary leave.

Isabella takes off her glasses.  She's Afro-Cuban.

As she leaves...

INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

in the back seat on a rural road.  Isabella is not with them.

One of her Russians is.  In the front seat, his SMG is ready;

his eyes never leave Crockett and Tubbs.

EXT. ROAD - CARAVAN

A military Hummer in the front carries Isabella with her

security.  Behind is a crew cab with bench seats loaded with

Haitian paramilitary.

INT. MERCEDES - TUBBS

They approach a town.  He nudges Crockett.  A police

roadblock's ahead.

CROCKETT

has seen something else.  He indicates the pager on his

waist.

TUBBS' POV:  PAGER - NO SIGNAL

That's what's surprising.  Tubbs pulls his cell phone.

Meanwhile, they're slowing down for the police roadblock.

Crockett gets tense...

TUBBS

watches.  His cell's SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR steps down to

zero.

EXT. POLICE ROADBLOCK - COPS

stop the caravan.  Is this turning bad?

INT. CAR - CROCKETT

alarmed.

EXT. ROADBLOCK - HAITIAN COPS

check under the vehicles with mirrors.  See all the weapons.

Salute.  Usher the convoy past.

INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS

exchange a look.  Then they get it.  The cops work as

security for the narcotrafficker.  The caravan advances

towards a major intersection.  This one is blocked-off by

Haitian military.

EXT. SECOND CHECKPOINT - CAR DOOR

is snatched open.  Haitian soldiers search Crockett and

Tubbs.  They defer to the Russian-speaking security.

Mercedes pulls forward...

CROCKETT

eyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban

area?  Blocking signal traffic is something the CIA does over

Baghdad.  It's not supposed to be happening in Haiti on a

dope deal.

CROCKETT + TUBBS

SEE a third circle of security approach.

PRIVATE-SECTOR TYPES IN BUSINESS SUITS

carrying automatic weapons, some more casually dressed, some

with night-vision goggles.  The vehicles stop.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE

Crockett and Tubbs are directed to get out.  They're pushed

around and searched.  A working class Glaswegion Scot, a

couple of 5'10" Brits are off to the side with short hair and

shoulders that are too deep and faces like Rugby players (ex-

SAS).  Russians are ex-KGB.  Languages overheard:  smatterings

of Russian, Hebrew and English.  Crockett and Tubbs look at

each other:  they get it.  This is the cream of private

sector security.  And it says top dollar infrastructure.

THEY + WE SEE:  EXT. TOWN SQUARE

Four avenues lead in.  Each avenue is blocked.  The square is

closed down to vehicles and pedestrians.  Locals have

disappeared.  In the center of the square are FOUR MATCHING

BLACK SUBURBANS.

CROCKETT

gestures to Tubbs to look up.  They see...

ROOFTOPS:  TWO-MAN TEAMS - SNIPER + SPOTTER

with night-vision goggles...

CROCKETT + TUBBS

are clean.

CROCKETT, TUBBS + ISABELLA

cross through a no-man's land.  It feels like being in the

open in Kosovo.

TUBBS

checks out the first Suburban's uplink satellite dish on a

hydraulic mast.  The rear's converted into computer equipment

sitting in ruggedized racks...

INT. SECOND SUBURBAN - WIDE

Doors open.  The interior has been converted into a

luxurious, limo-like office with swivel seats.  Isabella

followed by Crockett and Tubbs enter.  It's occupied by

ARCHANGEL DE JESUS MONTOYA-LONDONO.  He's not flashy.  He has

smooth skin, slightly opalescent, black eyes.  His right arm

is normal length, but shriveled.

Crockett notices that Montoya lightly holds her hand.  It's

confident.  And he sees the slight smile on Isabella's face

as she watches he and Tubbs...

Dismissed, they exit.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - EXTREMELY CLOSE:  TUBBS

Subterranean alarms are going off.  Tubbs finds himself in

this small city, occupied by narcotraffickers and their

security in the middle of nowhere.  Urgency agitates Tubbs.

He controls it...

CROCKETT

in the town square, now, too.  But Isabella stayed inside

Montoya's Suburban.  Now, she lowers her window.

ROADBLOCKS

break up.  Montoya's Suburbans pull out.  The security cordon

deforms.  It all disappears around them.  It leaves only the

Mercedes, a driver, and Crockett and Tubbs...

CLOSER:  CROCKETT

looks after the caravan.

CROCKETT'S POV:  ISABELLA'S EYES

in the side-view mirror on the passenger side.  She is

looking at him.

CROCKETT

holds that look.

ISABELLA'S EYES IN THE MIRROR

holds his.

CROCKETT

Sound deadens.  His attention is on the woman in the

mirror...until it's broken by Tubbs' attention to his cell

phone.

TUBBS' CELL PHONE

Signal strength returns.  Tubbs punches in numbers.

He waits.  A phone rings.  It's picked up by Gina.

Tubbs is relieved...

INT. SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - GINA

To Tubbs, that's good news.

EXT. HAITIAN TOWN SQUARE - TUBBS

Pause.

Pause.

A deep chill.

And, now, she gets it.  Gina is in the kitchen.  Alone, in

their secret safe-house location.  She and Tubbs have nothing

to say.  He looks to Crockett.  The message from Montoya-

Londono is clear:  I know you.  I can reach out and locate

you our yours.  Anytime.  YOU ARE NOT SAFE.

INT. KITCHEN - GINA - NIGHT

We sense this is code.  It means get the fuck out of there

right now!

Gina ends the call, drops to the floor to the wall, kills the

lights, holds her Sig .9mm at her side as she moves deeper

into the interior...

INT. CUBAN CAFE ON CALLE OCHO, MIAMI - TUBBS + GINA - 4 AM

Close on their two faces.  He's holding her hand under the

table.  The noise of the surrounding crowd is a ROAR.  That's

the idea.  They want their words buried under noise...

PAST GINA:  CROCKETT

discreetly at the door, watching the street.  Trudy, Switek

and Zito are at adjacent tables.

Gina leans back in her chair.  Their eyes still connect

across the distance between them.  Their hands still touch.

Gina Calabrese shrugs.  Tubbs laughs, and we are...

INT. SAFE HOUSE - BEDROOM - 4 AM

Low music.  Dark shadows.  Half-light washes the walls from

passing headlights.  Tubbs are Gina are naked.  It's the

lovemaking of a man and a woman when they hold precious the

moments they have because they know that in these moments

they are safe.  And that the present is fleeting.  And they

know their time together is about luck.  Because life is

short.  Departure is imminent.  Nothing lives forever.  It's

in their faces and their eyes...

INT. SHACK (GUAJIRA PENINSULA, COLOMBIA) - CROCKETT - DAWN

A lantern lights his face.  The night is soft.  Crockett's

with a couple of campesinos, playing poker and drinking beer.

Whoever's shack this is, is a Tupac Shakur freak.  His image

is on all the walls.  A diesel truck starts and pulls away

outside.

EXT. LANDING STRIP - TUBBS - NIGHT

checking the cargo tie-downs inside an A-500 Adam aircraft.

He's sweating.  His shirt's off.  The cargo is ten black

plastic-wrapped and taped bundles.  Like any good pilot,

Tubbs trusts nobody but himself to tie-down the load.  The

rear seats are removed.  There's a plastic bladder holding a

reserve of 50 gallons of AvGas.

INT. SHACK - CROCKETT

wins.  The girls shriek.  Crockett pushes the money towards

the Campesinos.  They refuse.  Crockett insists.  One will

only accept the money if Crockett accepts his Randall hunting

knife.  He does.  Tubbs is in the doorway.

Crockett kisses the girls, gracious about the gift.  Tubbs

looks out into the night.

They head toward the strange-looking plane.  It's a single

fuselage with two propellers...one at the nose, one at the

tail.  Off the wings are two booms that connect to a rear

wing.  It's a Burt Rutan aircraft design.

There is neither metal nor exposed exhausts for radar or IF

to spot.  It does 200 knots at 22,000 feet.  It'll fly,

forever, 1,000 kilos of flake worth $23 million, and the

total air weight is less than two Bentleys.  It's the

smuggler's dream airplane.

EXT. LANDING STRIP - END OF RUNWAY - A-500 ADAMS

heads for the tree-line.  It will not make it.  At the last

moment, Tubbs pulls back the stick and the plane lofts over

the trees, clipping the tops...

INT. A-500 - CROCKETT

throws a look sideways at Tubbs.

EXT. SKY - A-500

airborne over the Caribbean, heading north...

INT. A-500 - CROCKETT - MUCH LATER

is dozing.  A signal.

Tubbs points up and to the right.  Crockett wakes, looks.  An

Aero Commander Turbo Twin is paralleling the A-500's course.

Now, it slides over them...almost into a collision.  It sits

right over the A-500, separated by only 75 feet.

INT. OPA-LOCKA AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL - TRAFFIC CONTROLLER - DAY

handling a myriad of flights, reacts.  On his radar he sees

next to the image of the Aero Commander, a ghost image....

INT. AERO COMMANDER - SWITEK + ZITO - DAY

Switek is flying and looks down at the A-500 below...

INT. OPA-LOCKA AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL - TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

keys his radio.

INT. US CUSTOMS AWAC - RADAR OFFICER

His FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) picks up Switek and

Zito's Air Commander.  He flips through all the different

modalities of detection, including thermography, for anything

else suspicious in the airspace...

EXT. SKY - SIDE SHOT:  THE AERO COMMANDER LIKE A PANCAKE ON

TOP OF THE A-500 RIGHT BELOW IT

We get the joke.  The A-500 with its stealthiness under the

Aero Commander together like a single footprint.

AERIAL ANGLE:  TWO PLANES

piggybacked, enter US airspace and cross the coastline into

Florida.

From underneath, the Aero Commander sweeps to the right on

approach as Tubbs radically dives for the trees, hugging the

contour at 220 knots at 150 feet...having snuck this plane

and its load into the United States of America.

EXT. CIRCLE 6 MOTEL, PARKING LOT - U-HAUL-IT TRUCK - NIGHT

Alone in the acid-yellow glare of the sodium vapor lights.

We wait.  We don't know why we're here.

PARKING LOT PERIMETER - SAWGRASS

MOVE IN...and we REVEAL staked-out are Crockett, Jean-Louis

and Tubbs...

We don't know who he's talking about.

ESCALADE

Lights off.  Cruises through the parking lot past the U-Haul-

It to the other side and disappears.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  MALIBU SS

cruises the other end of the parking lot.  The Escalade

returns.  All's clear.  Both converge around the U-Haul-It

truck.  Out of the Escalade steps NEPTUNE - 6'4", narrow-

shouldered and bald.  From the Malibu and back of the

Escalade, Four more Haitian ZO POUNDERS with handguns,

shotguns and shades...

NEPTUNE

pops the lock on the U-Haul-It with a crowbar.  He rolls up

the door expecting millions worth of cocaine.  Instead he

comes face to face with the barrel of a 12-gauge...

Trudy whips the butt end of the shotgun around, caving in

Neptune's cheekbone and nose...

WIDER - NEPTUNE

goes down for the count.  Switek - under the truck - rolls

out.  Crockett, Tubbs with shotguns, Jean-Louis and Zito with

CAR-15s emerge from the perimeter with bright lights on

shouting for the Haitians to freeze...

A 250-lb. ZO POUNDER brings up his weapon.  Crockett BLOWS

the guy's legs out from under him.  Zito disarms him.  The

other two are disarmed.

NEPTUNE

is rolled over by Crockett.  He plastic-ties his wrists and

feet.  Others are manhandled...

Zo Pounders, plastic-tied, are thrown into the truck with the

thousand kilos of cocaine.  But not Neptune.  The gate is

rolled down and padlocked.

INT. SAFE HOUSE - CROCKETT - NIGHT

staring at his satellite cell.  Waiting.  He looks out the

window at the passing river.  Soft voices from another

room...probably Tubbs and Gina.  It's five in the morning.

It rings.  He answers.

EXT. OVERTOWN STREET - JOSE YERO IN A TINTED EXCURSION - DAY

cruises storefront churches, chacouteries, Baptist missions,

Haitian restaurants and palm trees.  Men in dark trousers and

white shirts lean in doorways.  The SUV preceding Yero stops

three houses before us.  The Excursion with Yero stops two

houses beyond.  Security - very casually - deploys.  NOW,

Yero approaches...seen through the curtains of the window

we're looking through.  Reveal Tubbs watching.

And, he crosses to the door and opens it as Yero cautiously

enters.

INT. LIVING ROOM - YERO

And his face registers surprise.

DOPE

Carefully stacked in the living room are the PLASTIC-WRAPPED

BRICKS OF COCAINE THAT CROCKETT AND TUBBS STOLE FROM SAL

MAGUDA'S WAREHOUSE WHEN THEY BLEW UP HIS BOATS.

Hog-tied and bleeding all over his clothes, in the corner is

Neptune.  His mouth is taped.  He's shaking his

head...disclaiming, disowning and disavowing...

Yero looks around the corner and sees Switek and Zito in the

dining room, casually at ease with Galil assault

rifles...meaning "don't even think about it"...

INT. AN EMPTY MANSION - JOSE YERO - DAY

The empty mansion is on its own peninsula.  Through the

windows we see a yacht and Crockett's 48' Stryker, its canopy

open but without its racing supergraphics.  The mansion

interior...all Beaumaniers limestone...is devoid of all

furnishing.  They sit on white plastic garden chairs from

Sears.

Yero's certain about their motive.

She holds Crockett's look...as she did before.

Isabella gestures.  Yero kicks across the floor a cardboard

box full of money.  Tubbs glances inside.  Doesn't count it.

Isabella decides.

Yero doesn't like it.  She gestures "do it."

And she starts to leave...and sensing Crockett's gotten up

and follows her.  Meanwhile

And Crockett, close behind Isabella, now...

This is the wife of narcotrafficker Archangel de Jesus

Montoya-Londono.

Isabella pauses.  Crockett may get killed right now.  They're

near the open doors to the patio.

Isabella looks over at Crockett's boat.  Back to Crockett...

Isabella and Crockett head outside towards the dock, Tubbs

overtakes...

They step aside.

And he leaves to help Isabella board.  Switek unties and

pushes off the boat.  Looking out the window at them is Jose

Yero, as perplexed as Tubbs, who covers...

Meanwhile...

INT. STRYKER, CABIN - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

pulling away from the docks at 12 knots, repressing the

thunder of the 2,700-horsepower engines.  Crockett leaves the

canopy slid back.  They're open to the air.  He gives

Isabella headsets so they can talk over the roar.  The wind

starts to move her hair.  She's not sure how to put on the

headset.

Crockett lets the boat rock over the swells while he arranges

her headset around her ears.  His fingers brush her hair,

touch her skin...

It was not intentional.  But the look in Crockett's eyes is

as if a small voltage passed through him.

He plugs her headset into the dash, regains the wheel, shoves

the throttles forward and...

EXT. OPEN OCEAN - "BORN TO WIN"

cuts and then leaps over swells.  In seven seconds they're

doing over 70 knots.  And Crockett holds it there as...

ISABELLA

The wind whips her hair behind her, now.  The two are small

against the smooth 50' long hull.  Crockett hands her

wraparound shades for her eyes.  She doesn't want them...

EXT. OPEN OCEAN - OVERHEAD "BORN TO WIN" - DAY

rockets from one swell to the next, getting airborne.  Wind

and salt electrify Isabella.  She turns to Crockett and

smiles, putting on the glasses, now.  Crockett gestures to

her knees.  She should keep them bent.  Crockett pushes it to

75 knots...

FRONTAL:  CROCKETT + ISABELLA

in strong light, ripped by wind.  Behind them are ocean and

sky and twenty-foot plumes which jet from the props and make

a wake that vectors in diagonals to what each is leaving

behind them...where they've been...and converge to push them

to the new places where they're headed.  Behind, the skies

are leaden.  They're racing a storm.  Sunlight shafts through

a gap in thunderclouds, turning the clouds yellow.  Now, they

turn peach against the darkening open water and the grey sky

behind.  The boat vibrates, the engines scream and...

CROCKETT

waves her over to join him behind the wheel.  He holds out

his left hand to steady her.  He brings her to him.  Both

lean against his high upholstered chair.  He holds her to his

side.  Indicates the wheel...

CROCKETT

stays on the throttle, throttling back when the props are out

of the water so you don't redline the engine and forward

when reentering.  The swells are now four feet.  They launch

off each, get airborne, cut into the next...

Crockett's surprised.  And he doesn't push it.

Crockett looks at her.  Her perspective is that of the '60's

and '70's, the politics of national liberation, the

perspective of Marcuse and Franz Fanon.

Isabella looks at the look on Crockett's face.

She laughs.  She has that combination of intellect, beauty

and youth.  Everything is possible...life will never

end...she can ride this crest eternally.

And Crockett knows that her confidence makes her oblivious to

peril, makes "right now" too real because she believes she

will live forever.

CROCKETT

can't help it.  He looks right at her.  She lifts her face to

the spray.  Some clouds part and light strikes her...

And Crockett wants to possess her; to protect her.  He wants

no one else to have her.  He wants no harm to come to her.

And this is an impulse that takes him over to the core of who

he is.  And, as we MOVE IN CLOSER, Crockett has to turn

away...

ISABELLA

sees this.  She's quizzical.  Crockett looks back at her.

Their eyes connect.

"BORN TO WIN"

leaps...

CROCKETT

his left arm around her shoulder, his right on the wheel.

She rocks back against his body.  They rip across the seas...

INT. "JAZZ" - A HAVANA NIGHTCLUB JAMMED WITH PEOPLE - NIGHT

14-piece Afro-Cuban band.  IN THE PRESS OF dancers at a small

table, Crockett and Isabella...

They move into the crowd under two-story high windows

overlooking Meyer Lansky's Hotel Riviera - freeze-dried 1959

Las Vegas.

CROCKETT + ISABELLA

Whatever we knew about Sonny Crockett, we did not know he

could dance.  Their feet, their knees and thighs, perfectly

matched, they samba, like lightning.

He swings her around and turns her to a close embrace as

their hips and legs parallel each other's, as he turns her

under his arm, stops her, pulls her backwards into his body,

her hips into his, the fast beat, the footwork, and he spins

her back facing him, pressing her closer as it gets faster

and...

INT. BEDROOM - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

fall onto a bed, shedding the last of their clothes, making

love in a house somewhere.  Beyond them is an open window to

the ocean.  The sky turns red and grey but the water stays

molten.

Their eyes are open...because they're locked together the

whole time and their faces are steady and urgently surprised

because this is not language; not a symbol, not a

representation of a thing.  Jesus Montoya is not here.  Miami

is not here.  This is discovery.  This is fact.  They have

discovered each other and have never felt like this about

anyone before in their lives.

INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - CROCKETT - MORNING

His eyes open.  He wakes up.  Light and situation flood in.

He does not know where he is.  He pulls on his pants.

Barefoot, he walks to the window.  The interior is high-

ceilinged with immaculately polished floors.  And Crockett

looks around, a stranger in a stranger place.

EXT. THE BALCONY - CROCKETT

enters.  The paint on the outside of this house is peeling

and patinaed with stain.  The yard is overgrown.  The stucco

fence around the streamline deco facade is crumbling from

weather and time...

CROCKETT WATCHES THE OCEAN

from the balcony of the futuristic villa in Verdado...  A

futurism from 1939, peeling aqua, aging science fiction.

Wherever we are in the world, this place is out of the

stream, outside history.  And Isabella, this woman from a

different world, enters, brings him an oversized cup of

coffee.  In his trousers, Crockett drapes an arm across her

shoulders and they stand in the air.

CROCKETT

hears voices from the interior.

INT. BODEGUITA DEL MEDIO - CROCKETT + ISABELLA - AFTERNOON

in the funky yellow restaurant drinking mojitas.  They've had

lunch served to them at the bar.  Frosted glasses have sugar

on the bottom and are loaded with crushed Cuban herbs.  The

bartender has been there for 40 years.  Crockett and Isabella

look like regulars.  They've served chicken and plantains.

Like any restaurant, the people eating at the bar are the

regulars.  They sit where Hemingway sat in the slow part of

the afternoon.

Isabella smiles.

Isabella looks at Crockett and smiles and puts on her

sunglasses.

Crockett's hand is around her waist and slips down her hip as

he pulls her closer and takes off her glasses and she puts

down her drink and kisses him at the bar and Crockett's eyes

dwell on her and she looks back at him and, now, knowing what

he's thinking...

INT. THE STREAMLINE HOUSE IN VEDADO - LEADEN SKIES - LATE

AFTERNOON

The water is like sheet metal as clouds allow only a sliver

of light to illuminate the sea while rain greys-out most of

it.  Minute crimson is a freighter heading to the stone

harbor.  Fabric billows in the wind.  PULL BACK into the room

to Crockett and Isabella...

TWO NAKED BODIES

...one light skinned, the other brown, intertwine in the

opiated moments after sensuality.  The afternoon half-light

drapes parts of their bodies, making a relief against which

their eyes hold each other's...

INT. SHOWER - CROCKETT - LATER

focused elsewhere.  It's as if he's struggling to record the

event of her in memory so she'll sustain there, because he

compels himself to a different place, now.  Then, the shower

curtain parts.  It startles him...

ISABELLA

enters.  She touches his back.  He turns to her with a smile.

Isabella is not let down by the switch to commerce.  She

merely goes there, too.  After all, this is their subject.

Soft smiles.

Her knowing smile speaks of experience beyond her years.

There's a long pause.  This is business.  This is what is.

And she slides into his arms.  And smiles...

Isabella laughs.  She kisses him under the shower water.  And

it's tough to know who is pushing it further out onto the

edge.

Her breathing is heavier as she buries her head in his neck.

INT. BOAT ON STORMY SEAS - DAY

Crockett is alone.  Black skies mottled with grey.

CROCKETT

Rain and wind rip across his face.  He left Isabella in

Havana.

SATELLITE PHONE

rings.  Crockett picks it up.  It's Tubbs...

Crockett disconnects.  He pushes it.  It launches from one

swell, airborne, and knifes into the next.  It's violent.

Crockett's thoughts and expression are about Isabella.  They

are criminal conspirators, a woman cheating on her

narcotrafficker "husband," an outlaw smuggler who's really an

undercover cop...

OVER CROCKETT:  GOVERNMENT CHANNEL - "BORN TO WIN"

rockets in and then throttles back.

EXT. INDIAN RIVER SAFE HOUSE - TUBBS - DAY

sitting on the U-shaped jetty as we HEAR Crockett kill the

engines, tying it off.  Gina stands halfway up the small lawn

to the early 60's ranch house under tropical palms.  Tubbs'

mood is dark.  As Crockett approaches, he looks blankly at

Tubbs, offering no explanation...

Tubbs goes inside.  Crockett follows.  As he passes Gina...

Crockett looks at her.  He has no answer.

INT. HOUSE - CROCKETT

enters.  While Tubbs is strapping up...

INT. ENGINE ROOM OF A TRAMP FREIGHTER SEIZED BY US CUSTOMS

AND TIED-UP ON THE INDIAN RIVER - FBI RAC JAMES FUJIMA - DAY

We've entered a secret meeting mid-argument.

Fujima is surprised...

Crockett flips him a set of keys.

Fujima looks at Castillo...who is this insubordinate prick?

Everybody shuts up.

We know Tubbs has doubts about Crockett's motives and

methods, nevertheless...

Fujima nods acquiescence.

He leaves.  When he's out of earshot...

EXT. FREIGHTER ON THE INDIAN RIVER - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

step across to a second ship among the dozens tied-up along

the river.  Its crimson paint is peeling and it's been

stripped of everything salvageable.  They're alone.

This is the answer Crockett needed to hear.

And we know that might mean Isabella.

EXT. MONTOYA COMPOUND, GUAJIRA PENINSULA, COLOMBIA - ISABELLA

- NIGHT

We are on a peninsula with palm trees.  A bluff dotted with a

small forest of satellite dishes.  A ribbon of white-sand and

beyond that is silver light off the water.  It is rural and

futuristic at the same time.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM SUITE - ARCHANGEL DE JESUS MONTOYA-

LONDONO

in pajama top and boxer shorts, smoking a cigar.  In a

sweatsuit is Isabella, delivering a financial report.  It's

from memory.  Nothing is written down, in the tradition of

the elite section of Swiss private banking in which clerks

commit portfolios to memory.  There are no documents.

Montoya's referring to Crockett.  Alarm bells go off.

Is he suspicious?  Does he suspect Isabella and Crockett are

lovers?

Her lieson with Crockett is the last thing we expected to

hear from Isabella.

Montoya's thoughtful.

Montoya appreciates her thoughtfulness.

Montoya uses Isabella and her sexual allure to gather insight

into the people he does business with.  That's part of their

deal.

Montoya looks at her very carefully.  She stares right back

at him.

She looks at Montoya squarely.  It hangs in the air.  In his

strange process of decision-making, Montoya reaches a

conclusion...

If Isabella is pleased, she doesn't show it.  Montoya

continues to stare at her unwavering expression, frozen in

stone.  He smiles, then, and starts to take off her clothes.

He reaches for her hand and brings her to him.  She kisses

him and he puts aside his cigar, pulls her face into his

neck, and she runs her hands down him...

EXT. BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA AIRPORT - A G3 - NIGHT

lands.  The door opens.  Isabella emerges.  CLOSER...she

searches, looking for someone as she descends the ramp.

Then...

CROCKETT

emerges from behind an SUV.  He came to meet her plane.

ISABELLA'S

expression changes, but she masks it.

Businesslike, she walks across the tarmac.  There are two

Suburbans.  One for her; one full of security.  Crockett and

her meet.  No show of affection.  Her Secretary, carrying her

briefcase, accompanies her towards the second Suburban.

INT. SECOND SUBURBAN - DOOR - NIGHT

opens.  Crockett and Isabella climb in.  The rear is

customized cream leather, luxurious with three telephones and

a divider.  As Isabella climbs in, followed by Crockett, she

takes the briefcase from the Secretary and indicates he ride

in the front vehicle.  Doors close.  Windows go up.  Air

conditioning comes on.  She raises the divider, blocking the

driver and locks the doors.  They are sealed in the back.

Alone.  And she assaults Crockett with a passion that's

desperate...as if making love to him puts her world back in

balance.  Their clothes come off, Crockett pauses...

He touches the side of her face.

As they continue, we...

INT. BARRANQUILLA NIGHTCLUB - TUBBS + GINA - NIGHT

at the bar.  It's jammed.  "Cochi Loco" Yero and his

permanent bodyguard, El Tiburon, pass, smile.  Tubbs

introduces Yero to Gina, as his wife.

Yero shakes Gina's hand.  He indicates to the bartender that

Tubbs and Gina are to pay for nothing...and he moves towards

an office.  Cobalt blue light illuminates his face, and his

fierce yellow eyes are not filled with hospitality.

EXT. FALS DE IGUAZU AIRPORT (THREE BORDERS AREA) - MONTOYA -

NIGHT

deplaning his G-4 crosses to his armored Suburban.

INT. SUBURBAN - MONTOYA

climbs into the back.  It's also a traveling communications

center, satellite uplink, encryption, the works...

Assistant nods.  Montoya takes the heavy handset...

INT. BARRANQUILLA CLUB, OFFICE - JOSE YERO

Montoya thinks.

Montoya hangs up.  Jose Yero looks at the phone.

INT. CLUB - CROCKETT + ISABELLA - NIGHT

enter.  They join Tubbs and Gina.

GINA

sees Crockett's carriage with this woman.  It's different.

Intuitively, she exchanges a look with Tubbs.  Crockett makes

introductions.  Then, they move away to dance to a fast samba

in perfect synchronicity.  And, they're also SEEN by...

JOSE YERO

He watches them, too.  His yellow eyes are lit by strobes.

His eyes locked onto Isabella...dancing with Crockett, their

bodies close...

And in the way he looks at them, hurt, like a betrayed lover,

which he isn't and never could have been...we know now, the

core of his antagonism.

INT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER, DINING AREA - TUBBS - DAY

It's a 30 year old, well-maintained carribean freighter with

a steel table and u-shaped bench.  In the dark interior,

narrow spots reveal the group hovering over a ruggedized

Workpad with navigational software.

Tubbs hands Jose Yero's assistant, El Tiburon, a pager.

Jose Yero doesn't like it.

Everything Yero tells them feels to him like exposure.

Jose Yero's on the spot.

Yero gets up and leaves the confined dining room.  He exits

onto the walkway outside the bridge.  His path takes him

past...

EXT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER - TRUDY

with Switek and Zito.  Trudy's in a tank top.  Jose looks at

Trudy appreciatively...

TRUDY

returns the look with a stare that says, "Don't fuck with

me".  Jose raises his eyebrow and after noting the two

handguns holstered in the waistband of her hiphuggers...

INT. LONG CARGO SHED - JOSE YERO + EL TIBURON

walk.  Cochi Loco's security leads and tails behind as...

EXT. BARRANQUILLA HARBOR, CARGO SHED - JOSE YERO + EL TIBURON

enter from the cargo shed onto a roadway just as...

YERO POV:  GINA

passes by, driven by Switek.  They're en route to pick up

Tubbs.

EXT. BARRANQUILLA BEACH - CROCKETT + ISABELLA, TUBBS + GINA -

NIGHT

Isabella hands out banana leaves wrapped and tied around

cooked rice and barbecued pork.  Gina and Tubbs walk away

down the beach towards phosphorescent waves.

Crockett and Isabella wander down the beach, hard from the

ebb tide.

The Perseids make the night sky over the water look like the

Fourth of July.

What is Sonny Crockett trying to say to her?

Her eyes say that she listened to his warnings and will

disregard them.  Life is dust.  Meaning is in the moment, and

that's right now.

The intensity is because it's impossible.  Because it's

impossible, they've been free to imagine.  And that's made

the heat of it stronger...

Crockett didn't expect that.

She vouched for him.  She has to stand behind it.  He puts

his arm around her waist.

INT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER, BRIDGE - TRUDY + CROCKETT - DAWN

The Freighter is anchored a half mile offshore.

Magenta breaks the horizon.  Trudy looks at Crockett, looks

away...

Zito joins them.

Tubbs joins them.

Crockett looks at Trudy.  There's a connection between

Crockett and Trudy.  It's filial.  Crockett has a special

regard for her judgment.

EXT. SAFE HOUSE ON THE INDIAN RIVER - GINA - NIGHT

drives up.  Parks.  She approaches along the sidewalk, down

the walkway under the banana trees and birds of paradise.

Motion sensors trigger exterior lights.  Gina cocks her ear,

waiting to hear...  Then, offscreen, Tommy the dog barks.

Reassured, her left hand on her .380, she reaches for her

keys, opens the door...

INT. SAFE HOUSE - GHETTO BLASTER

A finger pushed the stop button.  The dog stops barking.

OVERHEAD:  ENTRY WAY - GINA

enters.

FROM BEHIND HER - WE MOVE CLOSER AS...

a leather sap arcs through the air and descends onto her left

shoulder, paralyzing her arm.  Other arms grab her, push her

head down.  The same sap backhands with massive force across

the back of her neck...

INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - ECU:  GINA - NIGHT

slowly comes to consciousness.  She looks around,

disoriented.  Her eyes roll back in her head and she slips

into dreamland for a moment.  She rouses and opens her eyes

again, blinks, disoriented...

WIDE PAST GINA TO WHICH SHE SEES:  AN EMACIATED WOMAN IN A

PLAID HOUSEDRESS

stares at her from the back corner of the double-wide

trailer.  With her is an overweight autistic Boy of about 11.

He plays in the corner and watches a small TV with a coat

hanger for an antenna.  The Old Woman pays Gina no attention

On her face is zero affect.  There are other sounds in the

room.

WIDER:  GINA

and we see she is tied to a chair that is bolted to the floor.

Her clothes are disheveled and ripped.  She tries to focus.

Then somebody's thick arms are fitting something around her

neck.  A blindfold goes over her eyes.  Around her neck is a

C-4 "necklace" like the one we saw on Stevens' wife in the

beginning of the film.  The arms and back belong to the deep-

chested Aryan Brother we saw from the Stevens' house and

Coleman's double-wide.  MOVE IN ON GINA.  He reaches below

the frame and does something.  Gina writhes away from him in

the chair.  He laughs.  He backs away from her to

camera...and holds something in his hand.

A CAMERA

He takes a digital picture.

EXT. HOMESTEAD FLORIDA TRACT HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY

A tall wall of planting hides the $150,000 house from the

road.  Neighbors are double-wide trailers.  The house has

some sophisticated radio antennas as well as a twelve-foot

satellite dish.  On the driveway are two Escalades and a

Bentley.  Out the back, off the dock is a two-million dollar

sports/fishing boat.  Someone's entering numbers on a cell

phone.

INT. HOMESTEAD FLORIDA TRACT HOUSE - COLEMAN

waits.  The guy working the cell phone is the buzz-cut Aryan

Brother we saw in the Stevens kitchen in the opening.

Coleman's shirt open in the Barcalounger watching ESPN.  His

watch is loaded with ice, and a four-carat diamond in his

ear.  He is all white bling.  Coleman's tattooed up.  Not

with "cool" Celtic symbols...his tats are neo-Nazi, white

supremacist, hard-core prison stuff.

CELL PHONE

in the hands of the deep-chested Aryan Brother.  Three girls

in cutoffs and halters are making sandwiches and laughing in

the b.g..  Then:

Coleman takes the satellite phone, attached to a laptop.  He

enters a number.  A frequency-response graphic displays in

the computer.  His conversation with El Tiburon is encrypted

so the voices are distorted...

Coleman hangs up.

INT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER - FUNKY BRIDGE

In calm seas they're tied up to a Malaysian small container

ship.  On it, Yemenese with AK-47s maintain a watchful eye.

From Crockett's POV as...

OTHER ANGLES:  SWITEK, TRUDY, ZITO

with an assortment of CAR-15s, Galils and two RPGs mount a

similar guard.

EXT. MALAYSIAN CONTAINER SHIP - FUEL BLADDERS

swung by the Honduran freighter's crane cross 10' of open

water onto freighter's deck to join 18 others already there.

It's the last of the transfer.

EXT. MALAYSIAN CONTAINER SHIP - CAPTAIN

EXT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER - TUBBS

EXT. OCEAN - THE TWO FREIGHTERS

separate.

INT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER, BRIDGE - CROCKETT

watches crew stow the cargo.  Then, his satellite phone

blinks red light.  Crockett boots up the computer to

encryption.  Picks up the phone.

Tubbs enters.

Crockett puts him on speaker.

Isabella walks in.  Crockett gestures for her to be quiet.

Tubbs reaches for the phone.  Trudy intercepts him.

Crockett turns it away and goes off the speaker...

Jose Yero does NOT know Isabella's on board.

He hangs up.

Crockett looks at Isabella, who's distracted in calculating

what's really happening.

Isabella punches numbers into a satellite phone.  No results.

Zito enters, makes the situation...

Crockett picks up the phone and dials.  His eyes contact with

Tubbs has Tubbs take Isabella out of the Captain's Bridge.

She pulls her arm away.  As they head down from the

bridge...we see...

EXT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER - DOPE-ON-A-ROPE

lines run from the freighter to two go-fast boats.  The fuel

bladders with crampons slide down the rope into the smaller

"cigarette" boats..."dope-on-a-rope."

WIDER:  ONE STARKEY

loaded, takes off into the night, no lights.  A second one

pulls away as the third boat's being loaded; Switek and Zito

climb into a cigarette.  Meanwhile...

INT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER, BRIDGE - CROCKETT

on the satellite phone.  He waits.

INT. SCARAB - SWITEK, ZITO + TRUDY

rip from one swell to another, airborne, in between their

load.  Trudy's on the comms.  Switek drives with night-vision

gear.

INT. STRYKER - CROCKETT, TUBBS + ISABELLA

Crockett drives.  Tubbs is on the throttles.  Isabella's

between them.  Then, Tubbs is sent a page.  Reads the number.

Picks up the satellite phone.  Crockett takes control of the

throttles, too.

And Tubbs hears..."And weather on the southeast throughout

today and looking into the weekend is broken clouds, humidity

78%, small chance of rain.  And coming up in four minutes at

5:45 is Lou Dobbs with Friday's market previews..."

INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - GINA - NIGHT

The phone is ripped away from her.  It's disconnected.

INT. STRYKER - TUBBS

He puts it together...

Crockett takes the phone, dials Castillo.

Crockett knows the Sophie's choice Castillo may have to make.

And it may cost Gina.  Crockett glances at Tubbs.  Crockett

pushes the throttles forward...

EXT. GOVERNMENT CHANNEL - TWO BOATS:  THE SCARAB + THE

STRYKER

jam over the swells into Government Channel, NOT SLOWING this

time, even though the limit is 15 knots.  Barely missing

sport fishing boats, slower recreational craft.

EXT. AERIAL - PAST HELICOPTER CO-PILOT

over his FLIR monitor scanning trailer parks.  Nothing.  Then

he notes a double-wide with two satellite dishes.

INT. STRYKER - TUBBS

on with Castillo.

INT. SCARAB - SWITEK

slams the Scarab sideways, spewing a huge wake, driving it

through a circle to slough off speed as he pulls into a dock.

Crockett's Stryker does the same.  Tubbs transfers into this

boat with Trudy and Zito.  Switek gets into the Stryker with

Crockett and Isabella.  As they speed up Government Channel.

INT. STRYKER - CROCKETT

SCENES IN WHICH:

(A)  TRUDY + TUBBS DISCOVER + ASSAULT THE PERIMETER SECURITY

OF THE TRAILER IN WHICH GINA IS HOSTAGE.

(B)  CROCKETT, SWITEK, ZITO + ISABELLA AND THE THIRD BOAT

MAKE THE DELIVERY.  DURING IT ISABELLA, FURIOUS THAT THIS

TRAITOROUS SONOFABITCH, COCHI LOCO, IS MAKING HIS OWN MOVE,

RAGES INTO THE MIDDLE GROUND, CALLING DOWN JOSE YERO.

BLOCKED BY AN ARYAN BROTHER, SHE PUSHES, HE SLAPS HER, SHE

SHOOTS HIM IN THE LEG.  ALL SIDES DRAW DOWN IMPENDING CHAOS.

CROCKETT + COLEMAN COOL IT.  COLEMAN WANTS HIS LOAD.  THE

LURE OF EASY MONEY HAS A VERY STRONG APPEAL.

AND ISABELLA IS STILL COMPLETELY UNAWARE CROCKETT + TUBBS ARE

ANYTHING OTHER THAN PLAYERS.

(C)  TUBBS + TRUDY INSERT A FIBER-OPTIC SURVEILLANCE TAP.

EXT. TRAILER PARK, DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - TRUDY - NIGHT

Trudy DOESN'T answer.  She's totally focused on a clamshell

video screen connected to a fiber optic...  FOLLOW THE FIBER

OPTIC...as a SWAT technician feeds it into...

INT. METH LAB, DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - CU:  THE FLOOR - NIGHT

Where it meets the wall, a tiny hole has been drilled and we

see the 4mm diameter lens connected to the flexible fiber

optic poke through.  The camera's on the floor where it meets

the wall.

EXT. TRAILER PARK, DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - OVER TRUDY

And Trudy and we SEE in fish-eye a long-haired Nazi Low-Rider

and the bulked-out Brother with the Hefty garbage-bag apron.

Deeper in the trailer, her clothes torn, blindfolded, is Gina

with the C-4 necklace.  Beyond her, the woman in the house

dress and her large, retarded son.

INT. METH LAB, DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - LONG-HAIRED NLR GUY

reacts to knock on the door.

Laughs, reaches for the door...

Too late.  Door's opened.

EXT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - TUBBS,

holding the bag of Chinese for the Long-Haired NLR.  He

reaches and...

TUBBS

rips Long-Hair through the door, down the stairs, where two

SWAT slam him into the ground.  He struggles.  A baton slams

twice across the back of his neck.  He's out.  Handcuffed,

and Tubbs and Trudy are in the interior...

INT. METH LAB, DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER

Bulked-out Aryan has a handgun in one hand, detonator in the

other.  Eyes wide.  Standoff.  The Old Woman in house dress

is SCREAMING...  Her retarded Son sees Tubbs/Gina as a threat

to his mother...grabs butcher knife...rushes forward

during...

FROZEN.  Aryan doesn't move.  The FARQ-like necklace of C-4

around Gina's neck.

GINA

struggles against plastic ties, to hear, to see, as...

OBESE SON

shouts, surges past bulky Aryan, heading for Tubbs...

TUBBS

prepares for the autistic son, not seeing behind him...

ARYAN BROTHER #3

rising from a bare mattress with an aluminum baseball bat,

coming up behind Tubbs.

WIDE - TUBBS

slips the Autistic Son, rotating his right arm around the

kid's right arm, getting slashed on the back of his forearm,

but grabbing the Son's wrist as the momentum propels him past

Tubbs, who torques the wrist back.  Screaming, Son's ruined

wrist, Tubbs took the knife, and as the Aryan Brother swings

the bat...

LOW ANGLE:  TUBBS

ducks the bat.  It dents the faux-wood paneling.  Tubbs slams

the knife twice into the man's slide, doubling him up, leaving

the AB Brother to crawl, bleeding, with a 10-inch butcher

knife through his kidney into his right lung...  AND Tubbs'

gun in his left hand has never moved off-target of the Aryan

brother with the detonator in his hand the whole time until

right now:  he snaps a ROUND into the wounded Aryan Brother's

head.  And, that fast, Tubbs' gun is back on target.

AND THE FIERCE EYES OF BULKED-OUT BROTHER

A nihilistic smile dawns there.

BLAM.  That's all he gets out.  Trudy does exactly that.

Aryan Brother falls like a felled tree.  Tubbs retrieves the

detonator.  Trudy unties Gina.  Carefully, Tubbs pulls the

sensitive remote detonator from his hands.

TUBBS

puts his coat over Gina.  As she half leaves, turns to the

fallen AB...

She kicks him in the head.  Tubbs grabs her to pull her off.

EXT. INDIAN RIVER - CASTILLO - NIGHT

hears.

EXT. RUSTED FREIGHTER - AB SNIPER #2

with a .50 caliber Burrows is hit about 15 times from MPD

SWAT firing from across the bridge on a down angle towards

him.  MPD helicopters suddenly LIGHT up the sky.

INT. SUBURBAN - YERO

observing from a block south on the bridge sees the police

assault, raises night-vision binoculars.

YERO'S POV:  HE SEES CROCKETT + ISABELLA

behind structures on the jetty.  Crockett fires with the MPD

SWAT.

INT. SUBURBAN - YERO

pushes "send" on his satellite phone...

INT. GUAJIRA PENINSULA COMPOUND, COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

ENCRYPTION

The technicians are eating in the next room.  We hear the

recording...

INT. SUBURBAN - YERO

EXT. STREET + BRIDGE - YERO'S SUBURBAN

pulls out, racing to get away from the firefight.  But

BRIGHT LIGHT freezes it...heavy rounds slam into the engine,

crack the block, stream sprays, it seizes up.  Suburban

crashes into a car at the curb.  Yero bails out.

EXT. SKY - HELICOPTER - TUBBS

half out of his seat, a Galil in full auto on his shoulder,

hovering above Yero and the Suburban.

CLOSE:  YERO

does none of that.  Enraged, he pulls up a 9mm H+K SMG to

fire up at the helicopter

ON TUBBS

aiming down at CAM.  The assault rifle unloads in three-shot

bursts.

OVER TUBBS DOWN TO YERO IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT

The pavement, the car and Yero are cratered by the 7.62mm

rounds.  Yero goes down.  Dead.

EXT. STREET - WIDE:  HELICOPTER

lands.  Tubbs bails, grabbing his duffle bag and the rifle and

turns down the street towards the firefight and Crockett...

EXT. JETTY - CROCKETT

holding Isabella down, FIRES past a Toyota.  It's turned into

a sieve.  He tells Isabella to stay behind the engine block.

Then he ASSAULTS the ambush.

SWITEK

is shot in the calf, spins, goes down, gets up, limps to

cover, keeps firing.

EXT. SCRAP FREIGHTER - COLEMAN

...taking and returning FIRE from Crockett and Zito and from

his left flank from the SWAT team on the bridge...knows every

moment more he's here, more MPD assets are coming in.  He

wants to finish it faster.

LOW + WIDE:  COLEMAN

bails off the freighter onto the dock.  DARK-HAIRED ARYAN

BROTHER with a full auto AK is with him.  They move from

cover to cover, their heavy Kevlar body armor absorbing

rounds.  And they attack Crockett and Zito, who are

outgunned.

CROCKETT + ZITO

run for cover, fire three-shot bursts, run and cover.  But...

ISABELLA

runs from cover into the clear with her handgun firing at the

crazy whites, furious at the betrayal by Yero.  She's shouting

in Spanish.  It's insane.

CROCKETT

sees Isabella, moves.

COLEMAN

sees Isabella, swings his assault rifle onto her as...

CROCKETT RUNS

and sees Coleman because he's turned he's exposed his legs

and Crockett slows and blows Coleman's legs out from under

him.  Coleman's on the ground, scrambling for his rifle to

kill Isabella.  Dark-Haired NLR is pulling the trigger on

Crockett when BOOM...

TUBBS

fires the M40 grenade launcher loaded with shot.  Dark-Haired

NLR is nearly cut in half.

CROCKETT + ZITO

FIRE at the prone Coleman.  Coleman's dead.

WIDER:  THE FREIGHTERS - THE FIREFIGHT

continues as other NLR battle Miami SWAT.  Meanwhile...

CROCKETT

goes to Isabella, pulls her into the shadows away from

dockside, keeping her low, seemingly away from the police.

OK, how will they get out of here?

OVER CROCKETT + ISABELLA:  TUBBS

approaches from the left.  Tubbs and Crockett's eyes connect.

CLOSER:  TUBBS

sees his partner with this woman.  The frozen moment.

Isabella doesn't understand the changed expression on Tubbs'

face.  We do.

CROCKETT EYE TO EYE WITH HIS PARTNER

50 yards away.  All meaning is transmitted.  And Tubbs

nods...and the nod means:  "get her out of here..."

As Tubbs speaks into his radio, his right arm belted where it

was slashed, heading towards the diminished firefight, now

under MPD control, as...

CROCKETT RACES ISABELLA AWAY

through the weeds and scrap, away from the firefight, away

from the freighters, AWAY FROM THE POLICE.  Beyond them, we

hear the gunfight diminishing.

EXT. STREET - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

enter from the rubble-filled industrial lot.  Cars have

stopped, their occupants seeking cover behind them.  Crockett

hesitates not at all.  He grabs a late '80's Mercedes left

with its door open.  Its owner, a middle-aged man at the

curb, starts to object.  Crockett raises his gun.  Owner

demurs.  Crockett steals away in it down the street into the

night, its lights off.

INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

breathing.  She's hyperventilating.  He steadies her.  Then,

Crockett sees something and she does, too.

CROCKETT'S POV:  A ROADBLOCK

appears around the corner.  Rearview mirror:  flashing lights

on his tail.  Nowhere to go.  Crockett stops.

ISABELLA

thinks this is it.  She's dead.  SWAT, shotguns and assault

rifles, approach.

INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT

They do.  Then the SWAT Sergeant stops...

The police relax, turn away.

Crockett nods and drives through the roadblock.  He drives

away into the night.

INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT

does not look at Isabella.  He shoots up the on-ramp onto

I-95.  His eyes at the moment are world-weary and street-

wise.  It's all out.  All is in the open.  Finally, he looks

over his right shoulder at her.

ISABELLA

stares at him.  Incredulous.  For the first time she realizes

he's the police and has been undercover.  And now she hits

him...

EXT. HIGHWAY - MERCEDES

swerves across three lanes, up on two wheels, almost rolls,

cuts off a semi, which barely recovers, and spins out onto

the shoulder, off the shoulder, down into the gravel.  It

comes to a stop and...

INT. MERCEDES - ISABELLA

tries to bring her .380 around.  Crockett overpowers her.

Takes the gun.  She slams him in the face with a closed fist.

He grabs her wrists, spins her around, pushes her at the

door, handcuffs her behind her back.

EXT. HIGHWAY

He floors the Mercedes.  It spins through 270 degrees,

scattering gravel and dust, and pulls back onto the freeway,

driving out of the city, away from Miami, out, into the

night.

INT. MERCEDES - LATER

She won't look at him.  She won't reply.  She's frozen,

immobile, withdrawn deep, darkly into herself.

No reply.  Isabella wonders where he's taking her, what will

happen to her, but she won't ask.

EXT. TWO-LANE BLACKTOP THROUGH CYPRESS - NIGHT

Nothing.  The cypress are silhouettes against a lighter mauve

sky.  Engine sound.  Then, the Mercedes enters and speeds

down the empty two-lane blacktop.  And at the end, the trees

open up and there's the open ocean and, beyond that, the

Florida Keys.  We see a house.

INT. HOUSE IN THE CYPRESS - WIDE:  NIGHT

Door opens.  Crockett leads Isabella in.  He uncuffs her.

She rips away from his hand holding her arm.  She walks to

the other end of the large room with the picture windows

overlooking the water and the jetty and a boat tied up there.

Low furniture.  Sparse, it was built in the '60's.  She walks

to a restroom, slams the door.  Offscreen, a faucet runs.

Suddenly, the door opens.  She comes out, glaring, shouting.

INT. MONTOYA COMPOUND, GUAJIRA PENINSULA - COLOMBIAN MILITARY

+ DEA TYPES - DAY

in stencilled body armor storm in through doors and windows.

It is a police action, an assault.

REVERSE:  EMPTINESS

It's as if no one had ever lived there.  A few papers flutter

in the breeze from the light wind entering through the open

doorways.  White papers against white marble against white

walls.  A profound statement of nobody is home.  Wherever

Montoya is, he is not here.

INT. HOUSE IN THE CYPRESS - CROCKETT - LATE AFTERNOON

staring out the window at the narrow jetty.  Isabella sits,

distantly, alone at the end.

CLOSER:  ISABELLA

Crockett joins her.  She's withdrawn into herself.

Isabella sits there for a moment.  She glances at him, looks

away.  Then...

Meaning, who can tell?  There may be a time for them

somewhere else.

He touches her hand.  And she leans all her weight against

his arm.

INT. CYPRESS HOUSE, BEDROOM - CROCKETT - LATER

asleep.  The moonlight is silver tinged with green.  Someone

else had been in the bed with him, but he is there alone,

now.  Crockett wakes up.  He looks around.  She was there and

now she's gone.

He gets out of the bed and looks out to the ocean and the

jetty.  The boat's gone.  She's gone.  Sonny Crockett looks

out the window.
