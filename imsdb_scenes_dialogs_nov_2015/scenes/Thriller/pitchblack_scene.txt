CUT IN:

INT. MAIN CABIN

A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out...

CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew

lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the

deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:

The world is dying around her.

Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the

next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE

is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But

in the next cryo-locked...

The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief.

Slapping an intercom:

PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT:

blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING

INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS

HISSING in the air.

Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly...

Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry --

but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic:

They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own

identities.

INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

They stumble into nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up

suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens.

Owens activates an exterior view:

EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

The SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons

already disintegrating.

INT. PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK

Heart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to

steady herself. Over a headset:

She doesn't answer.

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- but fumbles a few

times, making mental errors. Finally she gets crash-shutters

open to reveal...

CLOUD STRATA sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights

on a dropping elevator. We're shedding

INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

As Fry runs more switches.

INT. SHIP - DAY

As JETTISON DOORS CLOSE around the ship.

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

As Fry flips up a security-latch -- and thumbs the switch below.

EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

MULTIPLE SHOTS: EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE around the ship's

skin, blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics --

including big deep-space drives. But this last separation puts

the ship into a dangerous roll.

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. Fry throws

actuators...

EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

And airbrakes deploy. She manages to kill the roll. But the

ship's still coming in nose-high.

INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

JETTISON DOORS CLOSE behind Owens, segregating him from the

passenger compartment. It scares him for a

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Fry flips up a new security-latch. INTERCUTTING:

Tortured silence. Fry's thumb moves to the switch that will

jettison the passenger cabin. Jettison 50 people.

INT. MAIN CABIN

SELECTED SHOTS of faces inside cryo-lockers, among them JOHNS.

He's prime-of-life, badge on display, some kind of cop. Shaken

awake, he clears condensation to check the locker directly across

from his, finding...

RIDDICK. Small black goggles hide his eyes. A metal bit wedged

in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace. A read-out admonishes

"LOCK-OUT PROTOCOL IN EFFECT. ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY

RELEASE."

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Owens unbuckles from his chair.

Overcome by guilt, Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction.

But a HUGE JOLT puts the thumb right back.

EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

No bolts fire. Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN

through the clouds.

INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

Now we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Seething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more

speed, more heat. The ship

pounded hellishly. She tries to get a stable view out...

The windscreen. We're breaking through cloud-bottoms. There's

just a glimpse of landscape before...

EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

The windscreen.

impossibly it holds. For now.

Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking

into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression

of the outside world. Now she has to rely on...

A ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping.

INT. CRYO-LOCKER - DAY

INTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he

claws at safety restraints.

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Ground-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in.

Out the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up

into view.

40 meters...30...20...10....

Fry braces.

IMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in.

INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

IMPACT. Chairs rip from their moorings. Strapped into one,

Owens slams into the ceiling.

INT. MAIN CABIN - DAY

IMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he

would've stayed inside, because just beside him...

NIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section of the cabin tears free...

skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us...and

disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it.

40 lives.

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Hammered by WIND, Fry opens her eyes experimentally.

FRY'S POV: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris.

But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing

Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before...

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING,

CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in

Arabic. Soon we find...

Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling his way to...

Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches for his holster.

Gone, torn right off his belt. No prisoner and no weapon --

spooky combination. Nearby he sees...

The light of a cutting torch. Someone's using it to open a

jammed cryo-locker. The plexi is torched away to reveal...

AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.

Johns searches for his pistol.

getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as

a choke-collar. Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...

Riddick. Still in body chains and mouth-bit. Clinging to a

ceiling support. Riding out the baton blows.

Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and

finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support. He keeps hold of

the chained feet so that...

Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST into the deck. Johns lays the baton on

his neck.

INT. FLIGHT DECK - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Darkness. A light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit.

It's packed with dirt, no signs of life. About to search

elsewhere, Johns turns back at...

His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. Johns

crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds

her. Fry. Buried to the gills.

He manages a smile and starts digging her out. Almost dreading

to ask:

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Johns helps Fry through the carnage. She's stunned by it all --

but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be.

Realizing she's in nav-bay, Fry starts digging like a search dog

to uncover...

Owens. Still strapped to his chair. Metal rod piercing his

chest close to the heart. Dead. Fry reaches out to touch him.

She recoils hard.

over. Ten seconds of pure chaos:

Fry grabs the rod.

But there is no more "that end." In exquisite pain, Owens

screams on. REACTION SHOTS of Johns, Audrey. Seldom are human

beings witness to such raw suffering.

The others leave -- except for Audrey, staying behind to watch

in morbid fascination. Johns doubles back and collars her.

Leaving, they pass...

Riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. His eyes, still hidden by

goggles, track Johns and Audrey toward daylight.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

The survivors straggle outside. CAMERA SURVEYS new faces:

ZEKE and SHAZZA. Male-female team of bushwhackers, partners in

life. Shazza has a tough sexiness. Zeke's face shows aboriginal

blood. (30s.)

PARIS. Overfed, overgroomed. A puff pastry of a man. (40s or

50s.)

Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and

THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The

Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam. They

have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab

Muslims.)

WIDE SHOT: All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain.

The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side,

spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are

two suns -- one red, one yellow.

The Chrislams fall to their knees. Confusion as they try to

orient themselves.

North? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open a

compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING

inside the ship finally ends.

INT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

As Fry holds Owens, now dead.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together,

each faces a different compass point.

EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

Fry climbs onto the back of the ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza,

Audrey are already here.

Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship.

One glance confirms that there are no other survivors.

Faces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers.

Others CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders.

HOLD on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their

savior.

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Breaking out pressure suits:

Fry blinks.

others get to work. Fry finds herself staring at

problem. Riddick.

Riddick has his mouth on the hull, virtually licking the metal.

Fry moves closer -- and now sees it sheeting down the hull.

emergency light, climbing wall-rungs...

INT. MACHINE LEVEL - CRASH SHIP - DAY

And crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water

cistern. She opens a crank-hatch -- and finds light invading the

interior. Her face dies.

INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

Oversize DOORS RUMBLE open. Fry, Johns, and Paris climb into

this dark corridor lined with cargo containers. Each container

has an access door.

As Paris unlocks, Johns steadies himself, suddenly light-headed.

Paris opens his container to reveal...

INT. PARIS' CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - DAY

Tiffany chairs stacked 10 high. Bronze eagle lecterns. Oriental

umbrellas. Neo-Egyptian castings.

They open the Wooten desk. Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles

of sherry. Vintage Port. Glenfiddich. Bicardi 151.

She joins Johns for a drink. Entering, the Chrislams watch with

both envy and aversion.

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

START on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. Staring at it

is...

Riddick. With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead,

he can't get near it. Or can he? Near the ceiling, the bulkhead

is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through.

Riddick stands. With a GRUESOME POPPING, he dislocates both

shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through

the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. A

body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint.

Free, he reaches for the cutting torch.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

Pistol in hand, Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping.

Nothing on the horizon. But something lies on the ground nearby.

It's Riddick's mouth-bit.

INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

FAST CLOSEUPS: Hands pillaging storage lockers, pulling out

anything that might qualify as a "weapon." It all gets hauled

back and dumped into...

INT. NAV BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Nav-bay. Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a

pistol, shotgun, baton. Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax,

digging tools, hunting boomerang. Imam shows a ceremonial blade.

Paris straggles in with antique curios.

A beat. They all grab for weapons.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

Johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. He

fixates on...

A blue glow on the horizon.

Zeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing

and ball-floats. The prototype is tested on Audrey. She sucks

on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on

demand rather than in a constant flow.

Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for

travel.

Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks to the yellow sun,

low on the horizon. The red sun seems inclined to follow.

(NOTE: "Imam" is pronounced "el-ee-MAM.")

Fry and the others round the ship to see...

setting.

Johns swings down from the top of the ship.

EXT. PLANET - DAY

Trekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM

THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star. Johns provides

shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder.

Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd,

odd sight.

Already sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi.

Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams. Imam helps.

Fry notices Johns scope-locked on something.

SCOPE POV: Beyond a distant rise, strange branches.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship. He deals with

the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: He fills a reservoir

with liquor, dials up a regulator. Umbrella spars shoot bursts

of cooling alcohol vapor. Paris luxuriates in it.

Zeke appears below. He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp,

cable, pick-ax.

He drags the sled toward the spired hills. Keeping one eye on

Zeke, Paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap,

pours himself a spot of sherry. As he sips,

Paris eases the hunting boomerang away.

EXT. BONEYARD OVERLOOK - DAY

The scouting party approaches a rise. The trees loom just beyond.

The young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an

oasis. But Fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees.

They don't move in the wind.

The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless. Fry,

Johns and Imam catch up to behold...

The "trees" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton,

tinted green by lichen.

it's like Hell overflowed right here.

A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC.

EXT. BONEYARD - DAY

Moving into the boneyard:

Fry touches one of the towering bones. It shows cut-marks --

almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword.

killing field?"

EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing.

Wind hitting the comb makes a LOW HARMONIC MOANING. By

moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can "play" DIRGELIKE

MUSIC. Wanting to show off the trick:

He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. And when he turns

back to the skull --

it's only...

INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Pilgrim #3, inside the skull. Johns enters and chases him out.

About to leave, Johns notices...

Bone-chippings piled on the ground. It could be nothing, but

still...

Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his

shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal...

EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Trailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her

breather.

INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Riddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced

with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons.

Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry.

Alone.

EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Johns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her

some.

They drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against

the combing. It brings her within arm's length of...

INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Riddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled.

Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck...

EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

She steps away.

Fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and

now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND!

Johns blinks, stunned.

INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Trying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly

slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's

all he wanted.

Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle,

left behind. It's still got one good swallow.

EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY

Leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the

hills. Ahead is a canyon.

He jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye.

SCOPE POV: PANNING the boneyard. FINDING the bottle. It's

still got that one swallow.

EXT. BONEYARD - DAY

CLOSER on the bottle. Only

emptied -- and replaced with sand.

EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

Working under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave.

Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps a sight-line on...

The crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back.

EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. Lined with rib

bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast.

Fry squints at the ridgetops. More of those spires are visible

on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels.

they? Just mineral deposits?"

The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant.

Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core.

ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible?

Fry takes the "plant," pushes the "petals" back down over the

core. They all stare.

They look ahead, wondering what awaits them. But Johns is

looking back.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

HIGH ANGLE: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind. Fry,

Johns, and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below.

The GREETING ECHOES through the settlement, built from stacked

shipping containers. Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind. A

rusty bike lies on the ground.

They move around a building -- and pull up short. Before them

looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair.

Old jugs litter the ground.

Fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the

abandoned buildings.

leave so much behind?"

INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

Through a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling

over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK to

include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting...

Refectory table. Place settings out. Years of dust.

Photos on the wall: Settlers working modest gardens. Playing

baseball. Posing with children.

INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY

Fry enters a dark room.

No response to her command. She pats around for old-style wall

switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she

throws them open to reveal...

Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles,

SOMETHING CREAKS behind her.

It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the

planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts

turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight.

EXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY

Fry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the

settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back

inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry

turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the

source of the glint.

Excited hits on her breather.

Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic

bearing. Soon she's running.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

Johns and the Chrislams trade looks.

EXT. SKIFF - DAY

Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch

up. They too marvel at...

plane, part space craft. Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but

the hull looks intact.

EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

CLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points.

A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his

rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on...

A shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a

dirt rampart just climbed by...someone.

No response.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

War-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level. He checks the

perimeter, looks inside the ship. Nobody. Is he being fucked

with? Again? He hopes?

Paris spins. The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where

he expected.

INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

Blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. Paris

enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers,

searching for usable goods.

They all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something

passing outside. Some

No answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye

to a crack there.

HULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He

starts toward the ship.

Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "RIDDICK!"

Paris goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his

frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there,

ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang.

All eyes watch as...

The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach:

We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the

blades shave closer and closer to us.

And Shazza swings hard.

Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER -- burned, half naked, one hand

still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker.

Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.

He lurches toward Shazza, trying to embrace her -- and sees blood

and brain-bits BLAM-BLAMMING against her.

sinks bonelessly to the ground. FAST RACK to reveal Zeke in the

background, pistol leveled. He reads Shazza's horrified face --

and understands what he's done.

He rushes over to check the dead stranger. As he bends down,

FAST RACK AGAIN to reveal

20 paces off, still unseen by the others. His goggle eyes

covet...

Zeke's breather.

EXT. SKIFF - DAY

Fry exits the skiff.

Outside, Johns has an ear cocked to the wind.

EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

START on the drag-sled carrying Corpse #4-- the stranger.

Zeke reaches the grave. The sun-tarp has fallen on one side,

blocking the sight-line between ship and grave. Zeke starts to

unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before:

There's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave.

Zeke hops down into the grave. CAMERA MOVES to reveal Riddick

hidden among the spires. He's been waiting for a chance just

like this.

EXT. GRAVE - DAY

Zeke drops to all fours. Looks into the tunnel. There seems to

be some kind of burrow beyond.

BURROW POV: Staring back at Zeke.

Zeke takes a handlight off his belt, shines it into the burrow.

It's the last thing he ever does.

INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

As MORE GUNSHOTS jar Paris, Audrey, Shazza.

EXT. GRAVE - DAY

FURIOUS CLOSEUPS: Zeke fighting for his life. PISTOL BLASTING.

Something slashing at him. Blood dancing on air.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

Shazza sprints across hard-pack, heading for...

EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

The grave. She slaps aside the tarp to find...

Riddick. Bone-shiv in hand, he just stands on the other side of

the grave. Shazza looks down. And SCREAMS.

EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY

CAMERA PURSUES Riddick as he lopes through the spires, running

from the scene of the crime. He turns a blind corner -- and

SOMETHING NEARLY BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF at close range. He hits

ground. A boot steps on his neck, keeping him there.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

Sucking on their breathers, Fry and the Chrislams make it back to

the ship. They find Johns beating Riddick like a chained dog.

She hauls him off -- only to have Shazza start punching Riddick.

EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

Fry and Johns stand over the grave. It's a gory mess -- but no

sign of Zeke. Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv.

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening

to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside. Fry enters, looks at him hard.

Riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. The eye

beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her.

Fry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as

Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get,

Riddick is going to grab some with both hands.

A head-shaking beat, then:

Again he turns away. She strips the goggles off. He sits with

lids shut tight, anticipating the pain.

Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first

time.

irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a

jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as

those of a starved jaguar.

He CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

Chain looped over one shoulder, Fry heads back to the grave site.

Johns, Imam, Shazza, and Audrey keep pace as...

He shoots Audrey a scowl.

EXT. GRAVE - DAY

Chain hooked to her web belt, Fry drops into the grave. She

peers into the burrow...looks back up at the halo of faces above

her...then slithers out of sight.

INT. BURROW - DAY

Letting her eyes adjust, Fry pats around lightly. Quickly she

finds Zeke's handlight, tries it. Broken.

EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

CLOSE on the chain slithering through hands, playing out as Fry

moves deeper underground.

INT. UPHILL TUNNEL - DAY

Fry makes an uphill turn. Sees a spray of light ahead. Worms

forward to reach...

INT. THE LAIR - DAY

Another chamber, wide and just large enough to stand in. Shafts

of daylight bore down into the room. More old bones litter the

floor. Fry moves into one shaft and looks up at...

An earthen funnel. The inside of a spire.

CLICK-CLICK.

Fry slow-turns toward the sound.

CLICK-CLICK-CLICK.

Something unfolding.

An icy hand grips her heart. Soundlessly, Fry backtracks her

chain, but...

Her hand finds something new. She angles it to the light. It's

one of Zeke's boots --

CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY....

The whole chamber is coming alive around her, shadows unfurling,

skulking the perimeter, circling.

was faster than a lightning-strike.

A paralyzed beat before...

Fry makes her move, rolling back into the shaft of daylight and

springing straight up into...

INT. SPIRE - DAY

The spire. Bracing against the walls, Fry tries to "walk" her

way up -- but her chain goes taut. Did it catch on something?

Or did something catch

EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

They drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave,

listening. Nothing now.

INT. SPIRE - DAY

Something tugs on her chain.

CLOSE on her feet. Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge

out footholds.

A stronger tug. Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to...

The MADLY CLICKING LAIR below.

She tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and

undo the belt. Suddenly...

faces, human faces. They're breaking through the spire with the

pick-ax. Hands reach inside...

EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY

...and birth her into daylight. Overlapping:

The others grab at flailing limbs. It's a tug-of-war now, human

hands on one end, unseen "hands" on the other -- and the humans

are losing. Until...

Imam unsheathes his blade...

And slices through Fry's belt.

INT. SPIRE - DAY

As the chain falls down the spire. Without Fry.

INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

FAST SHOTS: Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the

Koran -- whatever qualifies as "essential" on this planet. Amid

the activity, Audrey pauses to look at...

The spired hills.

INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Fry and Imam pull a power cell from the ship's battery bay,

THUMPING it down on the deck.

INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

At his personal locker, Johns digs out a box of shotgun shells.

He bypasses the blue-metal shells for a red-metal one. There's

something special about it -- though what, we can't be sure.

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

A shadow falls over Riddick. He doesn't look up.

Now their eyes meet. Johns RATCHETS HIS SHOTGUN and points it

at Riddick's head.

The SHOTGUN EXPLODES. CAMERA PANS off of Johns to show

Riddick still alive. The shotgun discharged next to his head and

blew off his wrist chains.

A beat. The future rearranges in Riddick's head.

He offers a hand to help Riddick up, to seal the deal.

A beat. Riddick reaches out for the hand --

is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun.

He pumps shotgun, spitting blue shells over Johns. He drops the

emptied gun and walks away.

EXT. PLANET - DAY

EXTREMELY WIDE: Blue sun setting, yellow and red sun rising.

The survivors trek for the settlement. Fry and Imam lug the

power cell between them, but the real load is shouldered by...

Riddick. Promoted from murderous monster to beast of burden,

he tows a drag-sled heavy with cargo.

Paris drops a wine bottle. Trailing, Riddick collects it.

Instead of returning the bottle, Riddick opens it and drinks.

Paris hurries to catch up to the others.

EXT. THE GAUNTLET - DAY

FRY'S POV: Of spires high above us.

The group falls silent as they transit the canyon, all eyes on

the spires. Fry stops short, hearing...

CLICKITY-CLICK.

Neck hairs rise -- but soon the sound vanishes. The group starts

moving again, faster.

CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICK.

Are they being stalked? Nervously, Fry traces the sound back

to...

Beads dangling from the belt of Pilgrim #1. Whenever he moves,

the STRINGS CLACK together.

EXT. SKIFF - DAY

The survivors have reached the settlement. Fry is trying to get

the power cell aboard the skiff as the others walk its exterior.

Fry looks from Riddick to Johns.

They muscle the power cell aboard. Riddick starts to follow, but

Johns blocks. He doesn't want Riddick inside.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

With religious fervor, the Chrislams are repairing the moisture-

recovery unit -- the machine Allah led them to.

INT. SKIFF - DAY

START on the battery bay. Hands are adapting the power cell to

the skiffs older electrical system. Soon...

Lights wink on throughout the ship.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

He's walking the ghost town, finding dead gardens...upended

chairs and furniture...broken skylights. Behind his back...

Audrey and Pilgrim #3 (the youngest Chrislam) scurry through

FRAME, stalking this curious monster in their midst.

EXT. MOISTURE-RECOVERY UNIT - SETTLEMENT - DAY

CLOSE on the other Chrislams, faces charged with anticipation

while awaiting...

The first drop of water. It appears at the bottom of a pipette.

Tongues fight for it. Another drop forms in its place. Now

another and another. It brings CHEERS.

INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

CLOSE on Paris' hands. Getting ready to celebrate, he unwraps

crystal goblets...dusts off the refectory table...and rehangs an

old Christmas garland. INTERCUT WITH...

EXT. CORING ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

Hands digging in dirt.

Covertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the

entrance of a tall windowless structure.

He excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light...

and a child's tin robot, timeless. Riddick thumbs a solar panel

clean. The robot's language program warbles to life:

Riddick stands and tries the doors. Locked. He peers through a

small filthy window. Is there something moving inside? Nothing

now. Riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign.

"Coring Room."

It's Johns, keeping him on a short leash. Leaving, Riddick kicks

a trash bin. Hard.

He leaves. HOLD on the trash bin a beat.

INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

PILGRIM'S POV: Of Audrey exiting the trash bin and running after

Riddick and Johns.

Pilgrim #3 is at the window of the coring room. He's found a way

inside. By the window's feeble light, he starts exploring. Just

visible at the center of this room is a vertical coring drill.

INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

Pilgrims finish pouring cloudy water into goblets. Riddick gets

the last of it -- the part with sediment. SELECTED CLOSEUPS as

they drink. Nothing ever tasted finer.

Silence. It's a question no one has chosen to deal with yet.

Imam notices one water glass unspoken for.

EXT. CORING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE on the "Coring Room" sign. An attached solar panel begins

moving, orienting toward sunlight. When it catches the full

brunt of the suns' rays...

STORM SHUTTERS unlatch on the roof.

INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

Pilgrim #3 hears SHOOTING LATCHES overhead. That sound brings

another sound: A strange SKITTERING. The pilgrim looks up. Is

there something in the rafters?

INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

Goblets rise.

It's like he just pissed in the punchbowl.

Fry is the only one willing to look at reality -- or at least

glance its way. At the window, Imam scans outside.

INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

Now the storm shutters start yawning open, spreading daylight

over Pilgrim #3 and...

The ceiling rafters. They're encrusted with thick nests of...

something. The SKITTERING grows louder, more agitated.

Sensing trouble, Pilgrim #3 hurries for a sliver of daylight in

a wall -- the breach he entered through. He never gets there:

Sunlight hits the first nest. It EXPLODES WITH LIFE.

INT./EXT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

As Imam hears the SCREAM.

INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

CHAOTIC SHOTS: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual creatures,

winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and

slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into...

A dark supply room. He slams the door, MUMBLES A BLESSING and

waits for the storm to pass. He's been cut -- but at least he's

still alive.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

As the survivors run for the coring room.

INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

As Riddick stays behind to drink their water.

INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

HINGES ARE BLASTED AWAY. The door caves in. Imam shoulders

past Johns to enter and find...

The empty coring room.

A NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to

come out? Imam opens the door...

Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave,

soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft,

SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then...

Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody

kite-tails. There was a nest

Imam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer

down...

The coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons

of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

Against a blue sunrise, the Chrislams hold a prayer service.

Paris and Audrey attend. Riddick watches from afar.

INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

They turn. Riddick enters.

Shazza joins him at the shaft. Gazing on the human remains:

Riddick nods.

Shazza can't deny it. She looks at him differently now, the man

she once beat while in chains. She takes off her breather.

Riddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure O2. Johns

watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of Riddick

being promoted to oxygen-breathing human.

Coring samples line the room, laid out on counters. Fry's been

scrutinizing them.

But now Fry remembers...

INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY

The orrery. The year-counter clicks over to "45" as...

Fry opens the drive box and starts turning the main gear,

accelerating the orbits.

CLOSE on the counter. "56...57...58...59...60."

They all see it: A giant ringed world eclipses the suns and

plunges their planet into darkness. Persistent darkness.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

Crossing the yard in wide strides:

A beat.

INT. SKIFF - DAY

Alone inside the skiff, Johns and Fry continue with more privacy.

A mental shiver.

He challenges her to read his mind.

Fry looks at him with new eyes.

Shaking her head, she looks off.

EXT. SKIFF - SETTLEMENT - DAY

Johns descends the gangway -- and finds Riddick erecting a field

table in the shade of the skiff. He seems out of earshot. Now,

anyway. As they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs

through Johns.

Johns moves on. The Chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of

Vectran (wing-fabric material). They drop it on the table.

Ready to cut bindings, Imam pats his hip for the knife that was

just there.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

As Shazza and Audrey repair the sand-cat.

EXT. SKIFF - DAY

CLOSE on the knife slicing through the Vectran.

Riddick hands the trim to Pilgrim #1. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he

scampers onto the skiff...balance-beams over wing-struts...and

delivers the piece to Imam, who stitches the fabric like an old

Berber rug-weaver. Pilgrim #1 pauses to check on...

The setting blue sun. Nothing unusual. Yet.

INT. SKIFF - DAY

The hatch closes, seals.

CLOSE on a monitor. A "HULL INTEGRITY TEST" is underway. Fry

scans rising pressure gauges.

Fry whirls.

bay. And he has Imam's blade.

She finds the courage to turn her back on him. Riddick moves

closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls. The cabin

pressure builds.

A beat. Does Riddick already know? Is he testing her?

It knocks her off stride, but...

Riddick moves right up behind her.

A monitor chirps the news: "HULL INTEGRITY --100%." EXHALING

GASSES, the hatch opens automatically.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

CLOSEUPS: Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box...

pull the shell open...remove a glass ampule hidden inside...drop

the ampule into a injection syringe. The syringe touches an

eager arm vein.

Shirt off, Johns looks up. She's in the doorway.

She moves closer. Rummages through his stuff brazenly. Finds a

shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules.

He catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing

her into an embrace. We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP

of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.

O.S., we hear the Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC and calling for

"Captain, Captain...."

It cuts deep.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

Fry and Johns move outside. The others have gathered, all eyes

gang-locked on...

They watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two

suns. Shazza shakes out of the trance first.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

MULTIPLE SHOTS: Shazza cranking the sand-cat...hands snatching

up lights, water, ropes...Chrislams piling aboard the sand-cat.

Sand-cat moving...Riddick jumping onto the rear bed....Paris and

Audrey running, catching up.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

Johns doubles back, grabs his shotgun shells, swings out the

door...

EXT. INCINERATOR - SETTLEMENT - DAY

...and catches up to the sand-cat. Riddick reels him aboard.

They turn back to see the rim of a giant planet. It's cresting

over the horizon. The luminous arch is the planet's rings.

EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

The sand-cat storms through the canyon. As it passes through the

massive ribcage...

The ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT some low-bridge bones.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

The sand-cat reaches the crash ship. Bodies leap off. Paris

steals a look at...

The rising planet. It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.

INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the

deck. Riddick yanks a second cell and, carrying it on his

shoulder, passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin. Johns shoulders

his cell and stumbles after.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

Shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it

and the ship.

The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat.

Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second.

They're racing the eclipse

EXT. SKY - DAY TO DUSK

As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DUSK

It's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims. The change in

light brings a GROWING HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.

But Paris can't help himself. He squints to see...

EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DUSK

The spires. THE SOUND seems to come from there.

EXT. SKY - DUSK

As the rings eclipse the red sun.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

A second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop,

beholding...

EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

Something pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light,

it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these

are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their

first nightfall.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully,

the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves

from another -- and does a quick about-face.

They run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see...

Riddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE

descending on them...

Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just

inches overhead.

CLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being

underwater.

CLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a

kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he

eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled

down to nothing.

The hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the

cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try?

Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the

hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her

feet...

...

INT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK

Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a

last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in

the funnel-cloud of hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

Still on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone

about to cross a busy street. Now he gets up, smacks his hands

clean, strolls for the hold. Behind him...

A rising GANG-CLICKING.

CLOSE on Fry. She knows the sound better than anyone.

EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

The spires are crumbling, torn down from within.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

Reaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look.

PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his

jaguar eyes.

RIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult

hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. They're large, mammalian,

hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out the

world they haven't inhabited in 60 years.

RIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch from the hills, gliding,

SOUNDING, searching.

EXT. SKY - DEEP DUSK TO NIGHT

The rim of the planet overtakes both suns. The world goes dark.

INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED.

The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship.

Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their

cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.

Imam is listening at the cargo door. The others pile up

alongside, ears tuned like radar. CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside.

Now MORE CLICKING --

Nothing. Only the door of an open container about halfway down

the tunnel-like hold.

A volley of looks.

More CLICKING. Johns realizes they expect

More CLICKING -- along with the sound of TOPPLING CARGO.

Butching up, Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward...

The open container. Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly

around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases

his head and a light around the door to spot...

Hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.

catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us...

A flash-image of an adult predator. Up close.

In one thin second, Johns is back with the others.

He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.

Fry lunges for him.

INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

Imam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed.

At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a

SCRATCHING.

Johns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts

the gasses to illuminate...

The door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY

BLOWS drive everyone back.

Taking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between

containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the

blades of the predators.

INT. SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

An burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the

escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as...

INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

Predators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING,

sweeping, hunting.

INT. THIRD/FOURTH CONTAINERS - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

SERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch

just as the predators break into the container being vacated,

always entering darkness.

INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

Inside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and

Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the

cargo with their bodies.

Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the

cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind...

...and moves to the front of the container where darkness

prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles.

RIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor.

Sensing energy, Riddick lifts his face.

RIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo,

eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.

Sensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS.

PREDATOR POV: Of Riddick.

(NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression

without detail. We're "seeing" what the predator hears with

echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its

subject in 3-D space.)

Oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey,

Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back.

Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head

caught in a vice-like grip.

RIDDICK'S POV: As a

one reaches down with its scythe blade...

And gently probes the two men. It wants know what they're made

of.

CLOSE on the pilgrim's shoes. Over-running with piss.

One test-slices Riddick's shirt.

INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

In the next container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing through the

escape hatch:

INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

CLOSE on a predator's scythe blade. It test-slices the pilgrim's

skin. Blood wells up. All CLICKING CEASES.

TIGHT on the pilgrim --

stopped. Losing his nerve, he bolts.

RIDDICK'S POV: A

Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the

escape hatch as...

Fry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick

HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit...

beast HOWLS and flails back.

HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it

really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head. Jacked

up, Johns is BLASTING shadows.

They give him a look.

pattern.

Fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass.

Wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams.

VULTURE SOUNDS from the two O.S. adolescents, fighting over the

scraps of the pilgrim.

Riddick nods.

INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

Cargo has been shoved against the door and walls. The survivors

gather around Fry's handlight. Audrey -- tough little Audrey --

has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush.

Now she challenges

Troubled faces. Is it just our imagination? Or is the light on

the floor growing dimmer?

No one knows for sure.

A persuasive thought. Eyes swing back to Audrey.

Two seconds pass.

He makes a move for her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps

the underside of Riddick's chin.

Johns looks down. CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds,

poised for evisceration.

Johns backs off first. The light grows dimmer.

She's pointing, of course, to Riddick.

EXT. PLANET - NIGHT

The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal

light remains, we see clouds forming.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

Cargo doors crack open. Mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is

pushed outside and swept around. Fry appears behind it.

Moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not

to heed the PRIMAL SOUNDS beyond their light. Soon they reach...

The main cabin. Blackness inside.

He lifts his goggles.

RIDDICK'S POV: Checking the cabin. Finding a lot of wreckage

but no life.

Johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first. Just as he stands up

inside...

into the night.

They scramble aboard. Riddick TONGUE-CLICKS behind Johns.

He isn't amused.

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

PREP MONTAGE: We see the survivors powering up cabin lights...

yanking three more cells from the battery bay...threading nylon

cord through Paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs

with high-octane liquor...swapping out O2 canisters.

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

Reloading his shotgun, Johns finds himself shaking again. He

unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a

lover's look. Behind him...

He palms the shell.

INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

As hands yank the last power cell.

INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

Cabin lights die. Still brooding, Johns finishes loading his

shotgun in the dark.

EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

CLOSE on a burning wick. Alcohol mist shoots across the flame to

create...

A FIREBALL. Two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away,

BELCH FIREBALLS into the night. By this light and more, we see...

Imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled. Beside

him, Johns fumbles with a second harness. Hands help him into

the chains. The hands belong to...

Riddick. Both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping

his captor into chains.

Riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light

down his back. A beacon.

CLOSE on Audrey. Overhearing, she goes stone-faced.

It worries Fry.

He walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a

terrible, terrible mistake.

EXT. NIGHT

The drag-sled begins moving.

SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off,

eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like

malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side-

guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position

carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling

along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every

shadow a threat. They are a train of light.

CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles

of booze.

CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.

EXT. NIGHT

Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their

lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND,

the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from

above, awaiting their chance.

EXT. NIGHT

FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished.

The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on

breathers as they muster inside the light.

Paris looks over his shoulder.

CLICKING breaks up the confrontation.

EXT. NIGHT

They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner.

At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING

never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his

torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty.

Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he

refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light.

PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl.

A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam

lunges at the last nanosecond...

And flattens Audrey to the ground. Scythe blades swing...

Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator

is long gone.

He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again.

Broken.

In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark.

The bottle drops.

The blood flows.

The CLICKING STOPS.

Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him...

Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.

RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a

youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't

find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the

youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators

start in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a

pair of predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS

AGAIN to include the object of their desire.

CLOSE on Riddick. Trying to figure it out.

CLOSE on Audrey. Listening to the HORRIFIC FEEDING SOUNDS.

Oblivious to all the attention she's getting.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

As clouds mass.

EXT. NIGHT

Into a rising wind, the survivors range on.

Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS

at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly

well, until...

The cutter sputters and dies. She ditches it and takes the torch

from Audrey.

Good question. They've just been blindly following...

The light on Riddick's back.

Working like a mule, Johns growls to himself.

can do better...."

spotting...

A sled-track. In

Fry hears a SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins to see...

Johns out of his chains. Moving forward. Jamming the shotgun

into the back of Riddick's neck.

Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of

plutonium.

It hits Fry like a two-by-four. She looks at Audrey.

An epic beat. The wind gusts...the FLAMES CHATTER...their ears

fill with CANYON SOUNDS.

Johns brays.

A beat. Eyes turn to Fry. She wants to protest -- but can't.

She rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. He shunts her aside.

He swung below the belt -- and connected. Fry's chin quakes,

her knees fail. The undertow of events finally pulls her down.

Johns snatches a light away from Imam.

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

They trudge on, slower now, building reserves for the canyon-run.

At rear-point, Fry follows like a broken rudder. Pilgrim #1 now

draws the sled with Imam. And up ahead...

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

Johns falls in step with Riddick.

CLICKING nearby. Johns BLASTS the night, driving the sound

away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the Big Gauge.

Riddick stares.

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

Overhearing, Fry looks. It's odd to see Johns and Riddick

walking side by side, like equals. Like partners.

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

Fry spots Riddick's look -- and Johns' non-look.

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

Riddick shrugs.

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

As Fry and the others keep slowing.

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

Riddick stops. Reconsiders.

EXTREMELY TIGHT on both men: In their eyes, we see the new

partnership splintering apart:

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

As the fight erupts:

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

FIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of

illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick

and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE

CLICKING AWAY.

The shotgun goes free. Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it

into the night. And then pulls his shiv.

Johns circles inside the light. Fucking with him, Riddick starts

poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark.

Johns stumbles over something. A bone. A club.

Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two

cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers,

forcing him to drop the bone. Just trying to get away now, Johns

makes a desperate lunge for the light, but...

Riddick shivs open his back.

Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light.

Riddick dogs him.

sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill...

Blackness. Where'd Riddick go?

CLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see...

night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his

head, he whirls again and takes aim on...

Another bull-rushing predator.

Johns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the

shotgun for another try. He's too late.

BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red.

Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark.

RIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator

lifts him off the ground and "stares" with a deceptively gentle

CLICKING-COOING SOUND.

PREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression.

RIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams

forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade,

splitting him in two.

EXT. NIGHT

Fry, Imam, Audrey, Pilgrim #1. They're running, stumbling,

trying to backtrack the sled marks. Checking for pursuit, Fry

looks over her shoulder...

waiting for them.

Conflicted, they all look back. Audrey starts to puddle up.

EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

BLACK SCREEN. We hear the canyon in full cry now -- CLICKING...

BATTLING BONE-BLADES...MATING CRIES...the RENDING OF FLESH

and SNAPPING OF TENDON. Far below, twin flames appear as the

survivors reach the gauntlet. Predators perch in FOREGROUND,

just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim.

EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT

They are but five: Fry, Riddick, Audrey, Imam, and Pilgrim #1.

CLOSE on each face as they listen to the CANYON. There must be

countless predators ahead.

A beat.

She looks at him hard.

EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

START on the power cells. They're been lashed together into one

queue.

Working amid the giant bones, Riddick crafts a new harness from

the old straps. Close behind him, Imam is MUTTERING IN ARABIC.

Riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down.

EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT

The torches. Maxed out. Burning non-stop.

Fry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a

torch.

Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight.

Audrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a

metal carapace.

Riddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will

surround them. There's just one path, anyway: Straight through.

EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

SLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield

fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along

behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already

tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet

somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind,

flank them in fire.

EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

As predators launch from the rim.

EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

First come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces --

then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. Next

come FERAL SOUNDS overhead.

Thin blue liquid spatters them.

More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...

weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND

OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry

eels.

His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry

keeps her eyes down and speed up.

More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping

out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?

Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims

of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly

mess.

Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg,

drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut.

EXT. CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

The passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first.

Ahead,

Steeling themselves, they start climbing.

But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her

And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.

PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10

different predators.

Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...

the metal...

And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.

Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries

to rip free of the shield.

Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.

The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...

Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly,

CLICKS MADLY at him.

PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.

The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with

its skull-blade.

Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...

...yanks his shiv...

...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the

predator falls, disemboweled.

REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.

They regroup. Imam's head swivels back and forth:

unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes

a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone

again before they can even react, jerked out of the light. Out

of existence.

EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

They flail on. And now, finally...finally....

The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven. The

WORST SOUNDS fall behind. We can see it in their sweat-sheened

faces: The faintest hope that maybe they've survived the Seventh

Circle of Hell. But then...

The TORCHES SPIT AND SPUTTER.

Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield.

Blood falls anew.

Imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color. But this

blood has no hue.

EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

RAIN MONTAGE: Water rilling, running, flowing over rocks and

ground.

EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

Caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop. One torch

goes out -- and won't relight.

Riddick sheds goggles to look ahead. We don't know what he

sees -- nor what he's thinking.

HOLD on Fry's anguished face, rendered in dying torchlight.

Somewhere behind, the AWFUL SOUNDS RETURN.

He's found a crevice in the canyon wall.

EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them.

EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his

back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over

to the crevice...

EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

...and slide it over the opening. A black beat.

Fry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them?

EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise.

He stops at the top, peers through the rain.

RIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement.

Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow,

slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail.

EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

Fry checks Imam's face.

wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she

his face.

It's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover

small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few.

CLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life.

INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

Riddick boards the dark craft.

Connects the power cells to the battery bay.

Watches the ship come to life.

EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

CLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms.

They climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their

world.

EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff,

looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision?

Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately...

Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and

closes the hatch behind him.

EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

Something claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's

Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she

spies...

The settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light.

EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

As the skiffs ENGINES WARM UP.

INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

As Riddick dabbles with flight controls.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

As Fry, running, splashes past buildings.

EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: This is

all they could harvest. Presently SCRABBLING SOUNDS on the

shield. Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield. He

can't see much until...

the glow-worm light to see...

More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield. The

light drives them away. For now.

INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights. He's

actually startled by the sight of...

Fry. Standing in the skiffs headbeams. Daring him to run her

over.

Eye-lock.

Riddick opens the hatch.

EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain,

Riddick in the light.

He laughs at that.

Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. With

desperation edging her voice:

He tosses her a light. The broken one.

Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out.

She's bleeding resolve. Riddick can see it -- can smell it --

and he keeps slashing away.

A beat. She takes his hand --

They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck.

In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on

history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely

calm. Curious. Even gentle.

EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

MORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready

to do battle with...

Fry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick.

EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

Protected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four

remaining survivors head out.

EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

They pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL.

He covers her mouth.

RIDDICK'S POV: Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise.

A predator drinks there.

RIDDICK'S POV: Another predator lands to drink. Then another.

Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major

gathering place.

Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare

is far from over.

RIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the

pool. A slim gap appears.

CLOSE on their hands, gripping each other.

RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage.

A gauntlet within a gauntlet.

RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to "stare" over its

shoulder.

PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast.

The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing

through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to

reach...

The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others...

Riddick. He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool. He muscles

her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her

slip-sliding down the other side.

Not waiting for him, Fry and Imam disappear over the rise.

RIDDICK'S POV: Of the predators. Regrouping. Crawling up the

rise at us.

EXT. NIGHT

Fry, Imam, and Audrey run hard, glow-worm lights bouncing wildly.

RIDDICK'S POV: Chasing them.

PREDATOR'S POV: Chasing

EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

Fry, Imam, and Audrey reach the settlement. They spill around a

corner and see...

The light of the skiff.

EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

RIDDICK'S POV: Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and Audrey

vanishing around the corner. BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE, we

follow in their steps, storming around the same corner.

PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick skidding to a stop. He snaps a look

up.

RIDDICK'S POV: Of

building. It SPEED-CLICKS at us.

PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick slowly pulling

himself. Ready to blade it out.

EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

Imam and Audrey stagger aboard. Safe in the light of the

headbeams, Fry turns back, panting, waiting.

Waiting.

He wants her to board the skiff. Fry gives it another beat, eyes

sweeping the dark rain. And just when we think it's over for

Riddick -- TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and predator:

There's a helluva fight going on out there.

Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck...

And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the SOUNDS until...

Riddick. Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to

fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him.

Around them

She gets the light around his neck. Now we see his face

clearly -- and see a very human expression there: Fear. Fry

grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.

He gets his feet under him. Gripping each other, they start

moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the

predators can't fix on Riddick's blood.

Something jolts them. ALL CLICKING STOPS.

EXTREME CLOSEUPS: Searching each other's eyes. Someone just got

slashed from behind, slashed bad. But who?

In an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms. There was no

scream. No cry. No final words. Just...

Blackness.

EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NIGHT

Out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us. It

resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits

escape velocity.

INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

CLOSE on a bloody hand. It toggles through nav-charts, plots a

rendezvous with "Sol-Track 17B" shipping lane.

In the cockpit, Riddick finds Audrey beside him. She stares

hypnotically at the stars ahead.

Interior smiles. Stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes

a course-correction. One very bright star comes into view.

Imam moves forward. Seeing, his face lifts.

As Riddick ponders the possibilities, we CUT TO...

EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NEW DAWN

The first sun flares out from behind the eclipsing planet. Its

light feels cleansing. Renewing. Life-giving.
