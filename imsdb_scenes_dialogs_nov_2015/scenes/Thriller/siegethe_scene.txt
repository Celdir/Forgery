FADE IN:

EXT. TYRE, LEBANON - DAY

A coast road. Date palms. Burnt-out hulks that once were

Russian T-54 TANKS have long ago been left to rust in the

sun. A 4-door MERCEDES hurtles down the ancient road.

A SATELLITE VIEW

Of the same scene. A grainy IMAGE of the car, and some

distance away, a moving cluster of animals. They are:

HERD OF SHEEP

As seen at ground level. Two SHEPHERDS goad them forward. In

the distance, the MERCEDES approaches.

FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)

U.S. Army medics and rescue workers frantically sift through

the rubble of a collapsed barracks.

BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD

The Mercedes barrels down the road, doing at least 80 mph.

THE SATELLITE VIEW

Shows that the car is fast approaching the point where the

herd of sheep are about to cross the road.

FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)

Amidst the rubble, the dead are zipped into body bags.

BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD

The driver of the Mercedes hits his horn but doesn't slow

down. In addition to the driver and a bodyguard, an OLD MAN

WITH A HENNAED BEARD, a turban, and sunglasses sits in back.

THE SATELLITE VIEW

As the Mercedes closes with the sheep:

BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD

As if on command, the Mercedes finally slows as the sheep

move lazily across the road.

FLASH CUT -- NEWS FOOTAGE (STOCK)

President Clinton addresses reporters in the White House.

BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD

Inside the Mercedes, they watch as the Shepherd urinates and

the sheep mill about in the middle of the road. The driver

rolls down his window to scream in Arabic at:

THE POOR SHEPHERD

Who hurries to button his fly. It is only as we look closer

that we see the silenced muzzle of:

COLT COMMANDO RIFLE

Protruding from the sleeve of his jhallabah. And then:

THE HERD OF SHEEP

Fill the frame, blocking our view of the Mercedes, and for a

moment, all we can HEAR is their gentle bleating. But as

they clear frame, we can see that:

THE MERCEDES

Has been turned into an abattoir, its windshield shattered

and bloody. The driver slumps over the steering wheel, the

bodyguard is half out of the window. And in the distance:

WITH A MAGICIAN'S ALACRITY

One Shepherd pulls a BLACK HOOD over the Sheik's head while

the other injects him with a HYPODERMIC. The first Shepherd

activates a SATCHEL CHARGE and swings it into the Mercedes

while the second straps the Sheik into a HARNESS... A BALLOON

self-inflates and hurtles aloft, pulling a cable attached to

the Sheik's harness.

AN MC-130 COMBAT TALON AIRCRAFT

Its "Whiskers" in the nose of the aircraft snag the cable

without slowing and roars off, the Sheik dangling unconscious

beneath -- just as the satchel charges EXPLODE the Mercedes.

THE SATELLITE VIEW

Records impassively for a moment, then breaks up into static.

IN A SAFE HOUSE -- SOMETIME LATER

A pale, diminished Sheik sits at a steelcase table. A STEEL

COT and a STEEL TOILET. Closed-circuit cameras in the corner.

Opposite him: the man, whose voice we have only heard: GENERAL

WILLIAM DEVEREAUX -- and though he wears a civilian suit,

his bearing betrays his pedigree. His considerable charm and

habitual skepticism are as much a product of self-discipline

as his close-order drill.

The SHEIK speaks a few words in Arabic.

INT. MOSQUE - DAWN

A MUEZZIN climbs a spiral staircase, enters a turret-like

room, CLICKS ON a microphone and CHANTS the call to prayer.

HUNDREDS OF BELIEVERS prostrate themselves on prayer rugs.

At the door, hundreds of SHOES are lined up, work boots,

expensive loafers, a range of social classes represented.

ON THE STREET

Shopkeepers pause to kneel and pray. In Arab homes, parents

and children do the same. And as we PULL BACK from:

THE MINARET

Of the Mosque, we DISCOVER not an Arab city, but instead the

unmistakable skyline of:

DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN

The World Trade Ctr, Wall Street, The Federal building.

IN THE FBI SITUATION ROOM

Two AGENTS hurry through the bullpen. TINA OSU, 32, sharp,

and FRANK HADDAD, Lebanese with an insouciant grin.

Sequence omitted from original script.

THE 99 BUS -- SEEN FROM ABOVE

Surrounded by a phalanx of Black-and-Whites.

BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

They have been joined by Anthony Hubbard, the ASAC.

THE 99 BUS

The BOMB SQUAD approaches. We SEE terrified PASSENGERS inside.

BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, EXITING THE FEDERAL BUILDING

BACK TO -- THE 99 BUS

As a police TECHIE inserts a dentist's mirror through a

drilled hole in the bus's door, the L.E.D. begins to BLINK

and the passengers SCREAM and dive for cover. An EXPLOSION.

BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, IN THE CAR

Frank is listening to a cell phone.

BACK TO -- THE 99 BUS

The doors hang off their hinges. As the PASSENGERS tumble

off, we SEE they are covered in BLUE PAINT.

BACK TO -- HUB AND FRANK, IN THE CAR

Frank nods. Hubs closes his eyes in gratitude.

THE JOINT FBI/NYPD TERRORISM TASK FORCE - FEDERAL BLDG

They're listening to a tape-recording, altered by a VO-CORDER:

As the MESSAGE continues, we PAN the faces: MIKE JOHANNSON,

squad supervisor, and DANNY SUSSMAN, representing NYPD.

Sussman shoots him a look. Clearly Haddad enjoys pushing his

buttons. Finally, Hub stands up.

Tina's phone buzzes. She picks it up as Hub keeps going:

Hub deals with Haddad's irreverence by ignoring it.

A young agent, FRED DARIUS, hands Hub a piece of paper:

Only two words are written: "RELEASE HIM."

Off Hub's look, we:

AN OLD WAREHOUSE IN BROOKLYN - DUSK

Hub and Haddad join AGENT FLOYD ROSE, a tall Black man.

THEY OPEN THE DOOR

In the klieg lights -- THE BUS. Men in white coats dust every

inch and generally behave as if investigating a crashed UFO.

In their midst, a young WOMAN, midwestern pretty in a serious

suit. She looks up as Hub enters.

She offers her hand. Hub doesn't take it yet.

Finally, he takes her hand. And doesn't let go.

She tries to take her hand away, but he tightens his grip.

He smiles. She smiles back. Convinced she's charmed him.

OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE

Hub watches as Elise is led away by two AGENTS. Agent Rose

stands nearby.

NICE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

In Frank Haddad's home. The Haddad's are celebrating the day

FRANK JR. has finished reading the Holy Koran.

Frank's TEACHER offers the final benediction. Those who are

Muslim cover their face with their palms.

Later --

The guests mingle, eat pastries and drink sweet tea.

Nearby, Mike and Danny observe them.

Hub, meanwhile, congratulates Frank's wife, NAJIBA.

And then Frank notices Hub's DRIVER standing in the doorway.

Sequence omitted from original script. (ALREADY SHOT)

INT. HUB'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Hub is looking at surveillance photos of Elise. Frank enters.

A SMALL GREEN ROOM -- AS SEEN THROUGH A TWO-WAY MIRROR

Hub and Frank watch a dark-skinned MAN being questioned by a

uniformed OFFICIAL. An INS Supervisor shows them a false-

bottomed suitcase stuffed with money.

IN THE ROOM

The official hopes volume breaks the language barrier.

The dark-skinned man is trying to keep up:

BEHIND THE MIRROR

Small puckered SCARS. The INS guy looks confused.

THE VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY

Hub and Frank in a rental CONTOUR, tail Khalil, in a cab:

ATLANTIC AVENUE - BROOKLYN

The Third World. Teeming, roiling, Kinshasha meets Beirut

meets Tel Aviv meets Moscow. Hand-written shop signs in Arabic

and Hebrew, boom boxes throbbing out "Oum Khatoum," the latest

neo-Palestinian techno-rock.

KHALIL pays the taxi driver and starts off on foot. Hub's

CONTOUR pulls over a safe distance behind and waits. An AGENT

passes by and slips a WALKIE-TALKIE through the open window.

MAN CARRYING GROCERIES

Falls in behind Khalil, who ducks into a storefront, where

WE CAN SEE him buying a Coca Cola and a Baby Ruth bar.

IN THE CONTOUR

A WOMAN WITH A STROLLER replaces the man carrying groceries.

KHALIL is on the move again.

FROM A GREAT DISTANCE

An AGENT with a TELEPHOTO snaps a picture of Khalil, who has

paused to chat with a PALESTINIAN of patrician good-looks.

The walkie-talkie CRACKLES TO LIFE, confirming the photos.

Khalil has a sixth sense from a lifetime on the West Bank.

All of a sudden, he BREAKS INTO A RUN.

He slams the car into gear and PEELS OUT into traffic.

SIX SURVEILLANCE TEAMS

In various guises, break cover and SPRINT after Khalil, who

shifts into overdrive. Cars SCREECH to avoid flattening him.

Hub's CONTOUR pulls into traffic and finds his way blocked

by a narrow passage between double-parked cars. He goes for

it, SCRAPING his way between them.

KHALIL SPRINTS

Into an open-air MARKET, KNOCKING DOWN veiled WOMEN with

bags of fruit and vegetables. He VAULTS over stalls.

The CONTOUR scrapes PARKED CARS as it swerves into an alley,

desperately trying to cut off Khalil's escape route.

A SOCCER BALL bounces into Hub's peripheral vision, followed

by TWO BOYS.

HUB SLAMS THE CONTOUR INTO THE WALL

To avoid killing the two boys. Hub gets out of the car and

continues the pursuit on foot. He's gaining on Khalil, when:

A VAN

Bears down on Khalil, its doors sliding open as TWO PAIRS OF

HANDS reach out and ANOTHER MAN appears out of nowhere and

BODYCHECKS Khalil into the van and jumps in after him.

The van BURNS RUBBER and DISAPPEARS into traffic.

MINUTES LATER --

An impromptu huddle in the alley. AGENTS gather in a circle

as RADIOS SQUELCH and HELICOPTERS circle above.

The Agent who took the pictures pulls a color xerox-type

PHOTO from a digital printer in his car. Hub looks at the

picture of Khalil and the good-looking Palestinian.

Fred hands a cell phone to Hub.

As he listens, the first trace of a smile graces Hub's face.

AN ORDINARY HOUSE

In an ordinary neighborhood. Hub sits in an UNMARKED CAR.

Agent Rose climbs into the front seat.

IN ANOTHER CAR --

Their radio CRACKLES to life. It's Hub.

We HEAR "Unit 1 is good to go," "Unit 2, we're ready to rock."

THE MAN WALKING THE DOG

Is suddenly double-teamed by TWO AGENTS.

A third AGENT throws his jacket over the dog.

TWO UNMARKED CARS

Fishtail across the quiet street, boxing in the Plymouth as

an AGENT from the sidewalk thrusts a 12-gauge Remington Pump

in through the driver's window.

THE DOOR TO THE HOUSE

Is BLOWN-IN by a specially-designed SHOTGUN. Two MEN, eating

take-out are surprised by Frank and Tina, their guns drawn.

Hub continues warily from one empty room to the next. A

stairway leads downstairs. As Hub starts cautiously down,

muted VOICES can be heard. Reaching the bottom, he sees:

KHALIL

Sitting in a chair. Behind him stands one of FREELANCERS

from the warehouse. And opposite him, in a barca-lounger:

ELISE KRAFT -- Somehow amidst the normalcy of the furnished

basement is a palpable feeling of menace.

As Hub shows himself, one of the Freelancers points a Glock

.9 at his head. Hub just stares him down.

The freelancer lowers the gun. Hub looks at Khalil, whose

face is badly bruised.

Khalil averts his eyes from any contact with her.

Still nothing. Hub calls out to his agents.

As the other agents approach Khalil:

As he heads out of the room, he says to a waiting Agent.

HUB'S UNMARKED CAR

Elise sits, handcuffed, alone in the back seat. Up front,

Frank is driving with Hub beside him.

Elise looks at him, utterly unfazed by the threat.

Frank's BEEPER goes off. As they look at one another, we:

ABOUT A MILLION COP CARS

Red lights flashing, have sealed off a Brooklyn Street. On

the rooftops SWAT teams are already deploying.

SHARPSHOOTERS politely insinuate themselves into the

surrounding family APARTMENTS and take up firing POSITIONS.

THE 87 BUS

Stands alone in the middle of the street. Through a Marksman's

SCOPE we SEE the terrified passengers forced to stand, catch

glimpses of the TERRORISTS, obscured by the hostages.

Hub confers with the NYPD officer-in-charge.

This rocks Hub for a moment but he covers it well.

BACK AT THE CAR

Elise leans forward as Hub opens the driver's door.

Hub takes off his jacket, folds it carefully on the seat.

She just looks at him.

He starts away.

A COMMAND POST

Has been hastily improvised behind a SWAT van.

THE FIRST ENG TRUCK

Pulls up and raises its satellite dish.

Frank turns to look at her. She is suddenly pale.

Hub is deep in conversation with the cops. Frank interrupts.

Hub looks up. Frank nods for Elise to repeat what she said.

Hub and Frank look at each other. Can this be true?

They just look at her.

The NYPD officer has been listening:

As the Policeman waits for a response on his radio, two more

NEWS VANS pull up. The MEDIA CIRCUS has come to town:

reporters breathlessly offer their live, on-the-scene reports.

Hub and Elise stare at one another.

Hub can see the dread in Elise's eyes. As the seconds tick

away, TWO NEWS HELICOPTER jockey for position above.

He grabs the phone.

He looks over at Frank, who's listening on another cell.

He waits as Frank translates. Hub covers the mouthpiece.

Still no response.

No response -- then suddenly, the bus doors HISS OPEN

And six bewildered, ashen-faced CHILDREN step out before the

doors HISS closed behind them. As Hub and a couple of the

cops hurry out from behind the barricades to help the children

cross the NO-MAN'S LAND to safety, a smattering of APPLAUSE

breaks out among the cops. Elise tries to hold back tears.

Elise watches as the news cameras zoom in.

Frank shakes his head, don't do this. Hub's look says

translate it. Frank does it. They all wait.

Elise looks at Frank, she can't help but admire his bravery.

Hub looks back at Frank. Still no response.

AND THEN THE BUS DOORS HISS OPEN AGAIN. A few elderly

PASSENGERS start down the steps.

THE EXPLOSION OF THE BUS

Hurls Hub backwards as:

ALL SOUND FADES OUT

To be replaced by a high-end, almost electronic WHITE NOISE.

SHRAPNEL

Imbeds itself into car doors, bus benches, doorways as every

WINDOW in a three-block radius is SHATTERED...

RED BLOOD

Replaces blue paint in a horrific shower.

HUB

Fights for consciousness.

AGENTS

Rush to his side to see if he is alright -- but WE CANNOT

HEAR them. Though their mouths move it is only the WHITE

NOISE that overwhelms us -- as we realize that Hub has been

momentarily DEAFENED by the blast.

When at last Hub manages to speak, his words are MUFFLED and

INDISTINCT -- as if the playback heads of a tape recorder

needed to be cleaned.

Frank Haddad bends down close and we can lip-read him saying,

"Just hang in there, buddy. . ."

And then he leans over to VOMIT in the street.

THE SOUND OF SIRENS

Slowly bleeds in through the white noise -- mercifully for

us, and for Hub, who wipes his mouth and looks up, realizing

that his HEARING is coming back. He reaches for Frank's

outstretched hand and stands, albeit woozily.

But the look in Frank's eyes says it all.

THE DEVASTATION

Is numbing. IMAGES we associate with other countries. And

then he sees Elise. Her face is cut and bleeding, but as

their eyes meet, her look is one of absolute compassion.

MORE THAN A HUNDRED AGENTS

Crowded into the now-overflowing BULLPEN. In absolute denial

of his physical condition, Hub paces like a caged animal.

He picks up a phone and begins requesting Agent transfers.

Now she picks up a phone and adds to the cacophony.

TEN MINUTES LATER - OUTSIDE A HOLDING CELL

Hub and Frank watch Khalil through a VIDEO MONITOR. The

bruises on Khalil's face have deepened.

Hub pockets the pack of cigarettes and walks into:

THE CELL

Frank hangs back in the doorway. Hub pulls up a chair, turns

it backwards, and sits down very close to Khalil.

Frank translates. Khalil pretends not to understand.

Again Frank translates. And again, Khalil looks blank.

Hub reaches into his pocket and casually takes out the pack

of cigarettes. Khalil's eyes widen. Hub smiles at him. At

the SOUND of the match lighting, SWEAT begins to bead on

Khalil's forehead. Hub takes his time LIGHTING the cigarette --

drawing deep so the tip turns bright red. Khalil unconsciously

RECOILS in his chair.

Hub turns back to Khalil, casually gesturing with his

cigarette. Khalil almost jumps out of his skin.

Frank hasn't even begun to translate before Khalil begins

SPEED-RAPPING in Arabic.

Tears stream down Khalil's face. He kneels at Hub's feet.

OUTSIDE THE ROOM -- LATER

Hub hands Tina back the pack of cigarettes.

FLASH CUT -- A SWAT TEAM

Bursts into an empty apartment. On the floor, a fax machine

continuously sending the message: "RELEASE HIM."

BACK TO -- HUB

TWO HOURS LATER --

The room is dark. A TECHNICIAN operates an overhead PROJECTOR.

TWO HOURS LATER --

A COMPUTER TECHIE (WHITNEY) is cross-referencing data. DIGITAL

PICTURES of suspected terrorists scroll past. A surveillance

PHOTO of Ahmed bin Talal. The ruined army barracks.

The techie types in a few commands: IMAGES of destroyed BUSES

file past. Tel Aviv. Jerusalem. Beirut. None a match.

TWO HOURS LATER --

The BOMB SCENE now resembles an archeological dig. Floodlights

on stanchions. Forensic EXPERTS, on their hands and knees,

use BLACK LIGHT and brushes to search for latent prints.

Different color STRING divides the site into a grid.

Nearby, Danny and Mike observe Hub's intensity.

TWO HOURS LATER --

In THE LAB. A FINGERPRINT EXPERT sifts through a plastic bag

of fingertips and teeth. Scans each into a computer.

Sequence omitted from original script.

TWO HOURS LATER --

Hub is STARING AT THE TV SETS which are all REPLAYING the

terrible incident, over and over again.

Finally, he turns away so no one will see. His eyes are hot

with the emotion.

The Fingerprint techie races in, sparing Hub a response.

TWO HOURS LATER --

Hub and Tina address twenty agents.

He projects a PHOTO of the dead Terrorist onto the wall.

A few appreciative CHUCKLES. They're all exhausted. This is

the first good news in a bitch of a day.

She points to where: A TIME-LINE has been created out of

colored strips beneath a bank of silent TV monitors.

TWO HOURS LATER --

The TIME-LINE is progressing. PHONE TECHNICIANS add tie-lines,

dedicated fax lines, wats lines and scrambled lines. Cable

everywhere. Danny and Frank pore over Ali Waziri's I-94.

Hub has been pacing, nearby.

Hub suddenly had to fight off a wave of nausea and dizziness.

Fred Darius, the young agent, appears.

THROUGH A POWERFUL ELECTRON MICROSCOPE

Hub peers through the eyepiece at a MAGNIFIED STRAND of fiber.

He looks at Frank. It's just as Elise said. The real deal.

A HOLDING CELL

Elise sits quietly with the stillness of those who have been

there before. Hub enters.

She just looks at him, entirely neutral.

They look across the professional chasm that divides them.

But there's a hint of some thawing in her tone.

Sequence omitted from original script.

IN A DOWNTOWN DELI

Hub and Elise sit, eating corned beef sandwiches.

She pauses, always gauging how much to reveal. And when.

She looks at him. For one brief moment the mask drops away.

Frank Haddad appears, making his way toward their table.

Sequence omitted from original script.

A CAFE

Where Students sit inside and SMOKE, then SMOKE some more.

They watch as SAMIR gets his bill from the waiter.

In the cafe, Samir counts cash to leave on the table.

Hub looks at Elise. Samir is leaving -- it's now or never.

THREE AGENTS brace Samir politely but firmly, and lead him

to their car. Samir slides into the back seat next to Elise.

In the REARVIEW MIRROR, Hub watches as a look seems to pass

between them. Then again, it may not have happened.

Elise is looking out the window, seemingly oblivious.

Elise tries to keep a smile off her face. Hub clocks this.

Frank BACKHANDS him across the mouth. Samir says something

in Arabic to Frank, who responds in kind.

CTF HEADQUARTERS - LATER

They enter the BULLPEN. It's well past midnight. People are

sacked-out in sleeping bags while others continue working.

Frank leans over Danny Sussman, who has fallen asleep, face

down on his desk, and sings in a lovely brogue:

He leads Frank into another CUBICLE. Perched on nearby desk,

Elise is dialing a phone, she stops to watch them:

Hub waits for him to calm down.

As they walk back, Hub says to Danny:

How should she respond? How thin should she slice it?

Franks shakes his head, ruefully. She's right.

She nods. A deal. For now.

And he's gone. Frank turns to Elise:

She just smiles and walks away.

OUTSIDE THE FEDERAL BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

Not many people around. Hub stands on the corner. A TAXI

cruises up. On duty. Available. He slows long enough to see

that Hub is black and passes right by.

AT A RED LIGHT

The taxi driver stops just long enough for Hub to slam his

SHIELD on the windshield.

IN THE TAXI

Hub sits in back, hurtling into the night. The driver's ID

identifies him as ABDUL HASSAM. Hub shakes his head.

IN THE SHOWER

As the hot SPRAY hits him, he runs his hands through his

hair and feels the BITS OF SHATTERED GLASS. Dried blood runs

off in rivulets from his hands. Not his own. He leans against

the shower wall, closes his eyes.

ELISE -- BRUTALLY SLAPPED ACROSS THE FACE

We are in her apartment. Samir looms over her.

Elise can taste the blood in her mouth -- but it's the price

she's come to accept. In a heartbeat, it's all business.

Something quietly ominous in her tone. He lowers his eyes.

And like a sailboat, Elise changes tack. Strokes his arm.

BACK TO HUB -- WHO AWAKENS IN THE DARKNESS

He's fallen asleep in a chair. In his lap is a pile of visa

applications. His BEEPER goes off. He rouses himself.

BACK TO ELISE -- ROUGHLY TURNED OVER IN BED BY SAMIR

Sex without any shred of tenderness. As Samir kisses the

back of her neck, we SEE in her eyes the thousand-yard stare.

BACK TO HUB -- ON THE STREET

In the doorway of an apartment building, Frank hands Hub a

styrofoam cup of coffee. It's a ritual between them.

BACK TO ELISE -- LYING IN BED AS SAMIR SMOKES

He sits up in bed, reaching for another cigarette.

As he stands up, naked, and goes to the window, we SEE:

THE SAME IMAGE

Seen again, FROM MUCH FARTHER AWAY by Hub who stands on a

ROOFTOP across the way, watching through 1050 BINOCULARS.

Frank stands beside him.

THE FEDERAL BUILDING -- NEXT MORNING

Hub heads for his office, his SECRETARY nods inside. Someone

is waiting. It's Devereaux, in a civilian suit.

Hub is unsure why he's audience to such a command performance.

Hub considers for a moment, then:

Devereaux rises, offers his hand. As they shake, Elise sticks

her head in the door without knocking.

And he's gone. Elise turns to Hub.

She looks at Hub -- and now she knows that he knows. She

brazens it out:

JUDGE'S CHAMBERS -- DOWNTOWN

Judge Frankel, 60, puts down his sandwich and wipes his hands.

Elise sits quietly beside Frank, observing Hub's trials.

Hub catches Elise's eye -- "we're out of here."

THE STAIRCASE OF A TENEMENT

Elise and Hub climb seemingly endless FLIGHTS OF STAIRS.

Finally he stops, turns on her:

They reach the top of the stairs where Frank is waiting. He

dangles a piece of paper -- the warrant -- and grins.

IN THE SAME SQUALID APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER

Hub looks through the surveillance equipment focused on an

apartment across the street -- paper shades drawn. Wearing a

set of HEADPHONES, Elise listens intently to the Arabic

conversation.

Hub, meanwhile is question a Syrian Landlord.

Hub looks over at Frank. They've got a way in.

Sequence omitted from original script.

Sequence omitted from original script.

DARK HALLWAY -- DAY

Mike Johannson, carrying two PIZZAS, knocks on a door.

IN THE SHADOWS BELOW

Hub, Frank, and a small army of AGENTS lock and load.

A YOUNG ARAB

Opens the door to the length of a chain and hands Mike a

twenty-dollar bill.

The Arab motions, leave them on the ground.

Muttering, he sets the pizza down and heads downstairs. After

a moment we HEAR the chain pulled and the door open.

IN THE APARTMENT

The Young Arab sets the pizza on an orange crate. Two other

YOUNG ARABS in the next room barely take their eyes off the

rerun of "Hunter." But as the young Arab opens the box:

A STUN GRENADE

Hidden within, EXPLODES with a blinding FLASH, knocking him

to the ground.

THE APARTMENT DOOR

Is blown in as armed AGENTS rush in, Hub leading the way.

THE TWO OTHER YOUNG ARABS, HOWEVER --

Have not been affected. Not only were they in the next room,

but also their eyes were averted from the FLASH.

THEY COME UP FIRING

But only get off half a clip each before they are CUT DOWN

by a fusillade of FBI return-fire.

ON THE GROUND

The Young Arab, momentarily disoriented, stumbles to his

feet, only to be confronted by six armed agents -- all aiming

at his chest.

The terrorist puts his gun to his mouth and PULLS THE TRIGGER.

A STILLNESS

As the CORDITE drifts lazily toward the ceiling, Hub calls

out from behind the table:

Other Agents scurry in to hover over the inert BODIES.

Hub picks himself up in time to see Elise, kneeling beside

the body of the Young Arab, her hand on his boyish chest.

A few WHOOPS and high-fives as the adrenaline rush of the

firefight abates. Frank opens the remaining box.

Then from across the room, Hub kneels beside an ominous-

looking DEVICE. A claymore mine.

Frank stares at the lethal booby-trap. Hub shakes his head.

A DOWNTOWN BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Where Mike and Tina are dancing their asses off. Around them,

other AGENTS from the takedown laugh and drink.

AT A NEARBY TABLE

Hub and Elise sit, watch them cut loose.

A WAITRESS brings her another drink.

He studies her for a moment.

Frank appears to lean over their table.

She laughs and stands up to dance:

But as he grudgingly stands up, a BALLAD comes on. They stand

there awkwardly. Finally, he takes her into his arms.

Tina watches them. She rolls her eyes at Frank. And then:

THE GROUND SHAKES

A low RUMBLE as the light FLICKERS and the chandelier sways.

But Elise is not too drunk to make her way to the door. Hub

joins her. Already, in the distance, the WAILING OF SIRENS.

IN THE TOWN CAR -- SPEEDING UPTOWN ON MADISON AVE

Blue light FLASHING. Hub, Elise and Frank sit grimly silent.

TRAFFIC

Is snarled and gridlocked at 40th. Finally, they can take it

no longer and step out into a chorus of HONKING HORNS.

THEY BEGIN TO RUN

Past the frustrated drivers. Turning the corner at 41st where:

SMOKE BILLOWS

From the New Victory Theatre -- where a gala benefit is taking

place.

GIRL IN A PRADA GOWN

Walks toward CAMERA. She's stunning. From the jeweled

clutchbag to the tasteful necklace, everything is perfect,

except:

HER RIGHT ARM IS MISSING

And now we SEE:

THE BLACK-AND-WHITES

Haphazardly pulled-up over the steps and the FIRETRUCKS

already unspooling their hoses. Cops, Firemen, EMT's.

Everybody's SCREAMING. Hub and Elise race past.

MAN IN BLACK TIE

Sits, weeping quietly beneath the once proud stone lions.

THE FEW SURVIVORS

Their faces cut and bleeding, stumble around, disoriented.

As Hub and Elise continue toward a SOUND we have never heard

before in this country. A kind of keening.

A NYPD SERGEANT is the senior OFFICER on the scene. Hub shows

his shield to the man who appears a bit shell-shocked.

GLASS crunching underfoot, they can only watch as horribly

disfigured BODIES are carried out. A NEWS REPORTER shoves a

microphone in Hub's face.

Hub ignores the reporter. He sees that Elise is already

tearing off part of her skirt to bandage a SOCIETY MATRON.

He takes off his coat and goes to work beside her.

A DARKENED AIRPLANE

Hub sits alone.

THE HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING SOUND IS HEARD AGAIN

Hub reaches up to his DAMAGED EARS. As anyone who's ever

flown with a sinus problem knows, the pain is excruciating.

But we can only LIP-READ her question. He's sweating now.

Over this, we HEAR:

Sequence omitted from original script.

ON CAPITOL HILL -- LATER THAT DAY

As Hub climbs the steps toward the gleaming dome, the debate

continues within:

IN THE ROTUNDA LIBRARY

A strategy session chaired by General Devereaux. Sleeves

rolled up, silver coffee service. Staff members abound.

The question hangs in the air.

An icebreaker. Everyone laughs.

CLOSE on Devereaux. As he weighs his remarks, we FLASHCUT,

almost imperceptibly to:

AN ANONYMOUS ROOM

As WATER is poured over anonymous hands in a ritualized

manner. O.S. we HEAR the SOUND of chanting.

BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM -- SAME TIME

BACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS ROOM

Where the same anonymous hands lift a cotton shroud. We watch

in SLOW-MOTION as it drifts down a shoulder.

BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

BACK TO -- THE ANONYMOUS HANDS

Turning the key in an ignition. An engine rumbles to life.

BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

A long beat. The Chief of Staff sighs.

BACK TO -- A VAN

Emerges from a dark garage like a beast from a cave.

BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

The Army General speaks up.

Everyone looks over at Hub. Devereaux smiles.

He nods to Hub, who acknowledges the vote of confidence.

He measures his words carefully. Unaccustomed to these kind

of august circumstances.

CLOSE ON -- HUB as, from behind him, comes a familiar VOICE:

Hub looks to the back of the room at Elise, who's no longer

Elise. She looks blithely at Hub as if nothing is amiss.

ANOTHER FLASH CUT -- THE VAN

Crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, keeping well below the speed

limit. In the distance, the glass towers of Manhattan.

BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

FLASH CUT -- THE VAN

Turns up Wall Street. Frank Haddad and Danny exit THE FEDERAL

BUILDING. They pass Mike and Fred, heading back in. Something

about the van causes Frank to take notice.

BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

Everyone looks to Sharon/Elise. Hub looks at her, too.

CLOSE ON -- SHARON/ELISE

The question hangs in the air. She's thinking about something.

What?

ANOTHER FLASH CUT -- THE VAN

JUMPS THE CURB and heads across the plaza on A COLLISION

COURSE with the glass lobby of the FEDERAL BUILDING. Frank

and Danny are rooted to the ground.

BACK TO -- THE SITUATION ROOM

Close on Sharon/Elise. As time elongates. She knows.

Sequence omitted from original script.

WHITE SCREEN (ALL SOUND OUT)

Puffy clouds in a blue sky. As we TILT DOWN into:

THE GUTTED RUIN

Of what was once the Federal Building. RESCUE WORKERS hunt

for SURVIVORS as others carry BODY BAGS toward waiting

AMBULANCES. Hub stands sentinel to the grisly process as

indeed he has stood there all night. Frank is beside him.

A JEEP pulls up and Elise/Sharon gets out.

Their silence speaks volumes. With Sharon is an OFFICER.

Hub walks back toward the rubble. Sharon watches him go.

HUB'S APARTMENT -- THAT NIGHT

Sofas have been pushed against the wall. Hub's apartment now

serves as a temporary command post. Agents huddle together --

poring over the charred or soggy remnants of files.

Frank joins them.

A KNOCK on the door. They look at one another. One of the

agents answers it. Elise/Sharon. She walks over to them.

She nods. Takes from her purse a folder, labeled in Hebrew.

She takes out photos. Neither Hub nor Frank react. She puts

them on the coffee table. No one reaches for them.

They stare at one another. Both are tired and raw.

He just stares at her.

She looks at him, refusing to divulge anything more. Suddenly,

Hub grabs her arm and roughly shoves her into:

THE BATHROOM

She slaps him, hard. Without hesitation he slaps her back.

She claws at his face, but he grabs her wrist and bends her

arm behind her back.

Something in the violence of the moment is more than a little

charged.

VARIOUS SHOTS -- THE SURVEILLANCE OF SHARON AND SAMIR

A dead drop by a hot dog stand. Out for her morning jog. A

series of FREEZE FRAMES as the motordrive CLICKS AND WHIRS.

Sequence omitted from original script.

IN A HAMMAM (BATH-HOUSE)

Samir chats with a couple of older men in the steaming waters.

MORE FREEZE FRAMES:

A TV LOGO: FOX NEWS SPECIAL REPORT: NEW YORK UNDER SIEGE

HUB'S APARTMENT

Hub sits on his sofa, watching the special report. Spread

out before him, the surveillance PHOTOS of Sharon and Samir.

VIDEO CLIPS

A deserted Times Square. Police checking packages of shoppers

in front of a department store. Long lines of security at

bus stops.

EXT. DOWNTOWN - NEXT MORNING

Hub and Frank are walking downtown. At a stoptlight, A BUS

idles beside them, a POLICEMAN onboard.

ANOTHER CAR. TALK RADIO:

THE EXPLOSION

Is only the BUS backfiring. PEDESTRIANS who have thrown

themselves to the ground, screaming, now pick themselves up,

Laughing. Only Hub and Frank are not laughing.

NEWS ANCHOR DESK

VIDEO CLIPS

Jammed freeways; A LOOTED corner deli, its Arab owners,

bloodied: POLICE checking backpacks at an elementary school.

VIDEO CLIPS

Angry people, scared people. Hub, being interviewed about

the coordinated efforts of law enforcement.

INSIDE THE THEATRE (A VIDEO CLIP TURNS BACK TO FILM)

Hub and a few others sit on the stage. Two hundred law

enforcement officials fill the orchestra seats.

Sharon stands at the back, meets Hub's eye, and waves.

EVERYBODY'S talking at once. In frustration, Hub covers a

microphone with his hand. The FEEDBACK silences the room.

An appreciative chuckle. Hub points to A MAN IN A SUIT.

Everyone again begins speaking at once. Hub takes control.

He pauses a moment, searching for the words.

And then two hundred BEEPERS all go off at once. Everyone

looks at one another. Dear God, what now...

A GRAINY BLACK & WHITE VIDEO IMAGE

Kids, huddled in a corner, crying. A dead mom. The legs of

what we imagine is the terrorist. We are in:

AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- AN UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Hub huddles with other agents behind a makeshift blast-

barricade of desks and tables. Sharon kneels beside them.

The probe is a hot-head, "arthroscopic" video camera.

As Hub stares at the horrifying image, the WHITE-NOISE returns

and begins to GROW in his head.

The NOISE in Hub's head continues to grow. And then suddenly

it is compounded by the SOUND of an APPROACHING CHOPPER --

as an NYPD SWAT HELICOPTER lowers itself into view.

In the HELICOPTER -- a Marksman raises a sniper's rifle.

THE WHITE NOISE

Is screaming now in Hub's head. Unimaginable. Unbearable.

The SOUND of the CHOPPER and the WHITE NOISE drown him out.

ON THE VIDEO MONITOR

Children are SCREAMING without sound. Even the chopper is

drowned out by the WHITE NOISE.

IN THE CHOPPER

The MARKSMAN takes careful aim --

IN THE CLASSROOM

The TERRORIST grabs a child as a human shield. Hub closes

his eyes to the imminent nightmare, and then:

SUDDENLY, WITHOUT WARNING --

He takes off, barreling down the hall, toward the locked

door of the classroom.

THE DOOR SPLINTERS

He flies through it, firing, hitting the TERRORIST twice.

AN EXPLOSION

Much like the first one on Bus 99. Hub throws himself over

several SCREAMING CHILDREN. And for a moment we don't know

if they'll live or die, until:

BLUE PAINT covers them all. Agents pour in, followed by

Sharon. There, on the floor, holding as many weeping children

as he can:

HUB

Who, unable to keep up the facade for a single second more,

is also weeping now. Weeping for the victims of the bombings,

weeping for the children who've survived, weeping for himself.

And for a moment, everyone just... stands there, vaguely

embarrassed, and more than a little moved.

INT. HUB'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

Hub sits in his boxers, toweling blue paint from his hair,

listening to the CNN report of the school attack. A KNOCK at

the door. He pulls on his pants. It's Sharon.

She hands Hub another fax: "Last Warning. Release Him." He

looks at it and hands it back to her without a word.

They stand awkwardly in the doorway for a moment.

He walks over and opens a bottle of scotch.

He doesn't respond. Hands her the drink.

She takes a drink. Then another.

They stare at each other.

It's a charged moment. They're two sad and lonely people.

When they embrace, their ferocity and desperation is something

more than comfort and less than love.

Sequence omitted from original script.

THE CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

The Chief of Staff is working late in a cardigan sweater.

Devereaux, in his impeccable suit, stands opposite him. Even

at ease he is smartly erect.

Devereaux frosts him with a look.

He and Devereaux look at each other. It is the moment of

plausible deniability.

The Chief of Staff accepts the answer because it serves him,

for now. And because he has a more pressing agenda.

HUB'S APARTMENT - DAWN

A ringing phone. Hub wakes up in a tangle of sheets. He looks

around and realizes he is alone. Did last night even happen?

He reaches for the remote control, turns on the TV.

A GRINDING OF TREADS ON ASPHALT -- DAWN

as THE FIRST APC enters Brooklyn. Followed by another. And

another. And in a sound bite: General Devereaux, IN FATIGUES

FOR THE FIRST TIME, and looking like grim death.

THE BATTLE OF BROOKLYN HAS BEGUN

Road blocks set up at select intersections. Random stop-and-

frisk. Patrols of young soldiers in the streets. GANG KIDS,

same age, same color, eye them warily.

THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

Is closed. SOLDIERS in full battle-dress stop cars, check

trunks, handbags, briefcases, and id's. THE LINE OF HONKING,

ANGRY MOTORISTS stretches as far as the eye can see.

A SWARTHY TEENAGER is pulled from A CAR by a SERGEANT and

led away to a CAMOUFLAGED TENT set up on the bridge.

A CAR TRUNK is inspected. Two women waved through.

Hub and Sharon stare at the Orwellian tableau.

Hub and Sharon show their ID's to an MP.

He leads him to A CAMOUFLAGED TENT on the service roadway.

IN THE TENT

The swarthy teenager is being interrogated by COL. HARDWICK.

Devereaux sees Hub and strides over to him:

Devereaux suddenly goes ice cold.

ON THE BRIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER

Hub and Sharon exit the command tent.

She gestures at the military leviathan.

She looks at him for a long moment. Considering:

A HALF-OPENED DOOR OF AN APARTMENT

Samir looks and sees Hub, standing beside Sharon.

He tries to SLAM the door, but they force it open. He grabs

A FAT JOINT from an ashtray and hurries into the bathroom.

OUTSIDE, the sound of gunfire. Samir reappears, wild-eyed.

He goes over and peers out the drawn curtains.

Sharon CRACKS him across the face.

Now it's Samir's turn to taste the blood in his mouth.

Hub jumps up, takes Sharon by the arm.

He gives her the BUM'S RUSH out of the apartment, shuts the

door, then turns back to Samir, who sits, ashen-faced.

Samir is trembling. Tears roll down his cheeks.

Hub just sits there. He knows he's got him. Finally:

He gets up and walks into:

THE HALLWAY

Where Sharon waits. As they head for the stairs we HEAR:

But we are HEARING IT along with:

COL. HARDWICK

In a nearby SURVEILLANCE VEHICLE -- where, through the newest

microwave technology (the kind the FBI don't yet have), he

has OVERHEARD the entire conversation.

ON A NOTEPAD

In his lap, the name, "Tariq Husseini."

OUTSIDE SAMIR'S APARTMENT

They are in a housing project. Hub dials his cell phone.

A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up beside them and armed soldiers

hop out. Sharon watches them as Hub continues:

A PSY-OPS VAN passes by, broadcasting through a P.A.

The announcement is then repeated in Arabic.

ROUNDING A CORNER

They come upon several more YELLOW SCHOOL BUSES. From within

the various apartments the SHRILL PROTESTS of mothers and

sisters as YOUNG MEN fitting the "terrorist profile" are

hustled into the BUSES.

Hub hurries on toward his car, passing TEENAGE GIRLS,

defiantly wearing Keffiyahs, who mill about, taunting soldiers

with obscenities in English and Arabic.

AN APC drives past, further inflaming their passions.

Suddenly, A volley ROCKS AND BOTTLES come hurtling out of

nowhere, smashing harmlessly against the armor. The teenagers

laugh.

And then, the sudden CONCUSSION of a small BLAST from UP THE

STREET. The teenagers SCREAM and scatter. Hub SPRINTS toward

A SMOKING CAR, pulling his weapon from his hip.

A SOLDIER IS ROLLING ON THE GROUND, SCREAMING beside a PARKED

CAR. His leg is shredded. ARMORED JEEPS come squealing around

a corner. M-16's are locked, loaded and leveled at Hub.

For a moment, it's touch-and-go as the the terrified RECRUITS,

just weeks out of basic training, decide whether to SHOOT.

On the ground, the injured soldier keeps SCREAMING.

Hub drops the gun and shows his credentials. The young soldier

approaches warily as MEDICS attend to the wounded man.

The RATTLE of small-arms fire is HEARD from up the street.

In the distance, a running FIGURE is chased by three SOLDIERS.

The transformation is complete: Brooklyn as Gaza.

REACHING HIS CAR

Hub climbs in. On a nearby pock-marked wall, a single word,

"Intifada."

EXT. AN OLD WAREHOUSE -- LATER

Hub, who sits in a beat-up old car, a baseball cap worn

backwards on his head. He keys his radio.

AN OLD WAREHOUSE -- RED HOOK

Inside, an AUTO GARAGE. Hoists, compression cylinders,

archwelders. Outside, two WINOS share a bottle by the curb.

A BEAT-UP DODGE drives up. In it, two scruffy-looking Black

MEN. Upon close inspection we realize that one is Hub. The

other is Floyd.

The mechanic looks out from under a car. He's Hispanic.

The mechanic gestures to a partitioned-office in the back.

As Hub heads toward it, he checks out the other workers: a

teenager doing a compression check, another fixes a tire.

IN THE OFFICE

Tariq is on the phone talking in Arabic as Hub enters.

Tariq holds up a finger, hold on. Hub sits opposite him.

Tariq notices that Hub's hands are out of sight beneath the

table. Hub draws back the slide of his the weapon with an

audible CLICK. Tariq mutters a CURSE in Arabic.

As Tariq stands, Hub crosses behind him, kicks out his legs,

pats him down, and cuffs him.

MEANWHILE -- IN THE WAREHOUSE

The two winos have revealed themselves as shotgun-wielding

FBI agents and are now ROUSTING the garage workers.

But before Hub can answer, an AMPLIFIED VOICE is heard.

Hub is as surprised as Tariq.

One of the agents with the shotgun calls out.

As Hub hustles Tariq to his feet, the other agents start to

hustle the workers out of door, when:

THE YOUNG MECHANIC

Reaches into his overalls.

But when the Mechanic pulls his hand out from his overalls,

all he is holding is the pin to a GRENADE.

THE EXPLOSION

Kills both the FBI agents and their prisoners. Hub throws

Tariq to the ground.

FROM AN UPPER WINDOW

An AUTOMATIC WEAPON opens fire on the Army presence.

HIGH ABOVE -- IN A CHOPPER

Devereaux responds with a dispassionate intensity.

His order unleashes an overwhelming display of FIREPOWER.

INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE

Hub and Tariq crawl for cover as windows EXPLODE, walls are

SHREDDED, and incendiary TRACER rounds mix with solvents and

gasoline to start a conflagration. With the vaguely

hallucinatory quality of the S.L.A. shootout, WHITE NOISE

bleeds in and ALL SOUND FADES OUT:

AN M-60 TANK (SILENT)

Races in from around the corner, only to be hit by A ROCKET-

PROPELLED GRENADE fired through the second floor window.

INT. CHOPPER

TWO APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTERS (SILENT)

Appear from their hiding place behind a nearby building. As

they dive into their attack trajectory --

HUB (SILENT)

Crawls, dragging Tariq toward the doors as:

THE CHAIN GUN (SILENT)

Of the Attack helicopter fires 2,000 rounds a minute --

virtually UNZIPPING the warehouse -- softening it for THE

TWO HYDRA ROCKETS that reduce it instantly to a huge FIREBALL.

IN THE CHOPPER -- DEVEREAUX

Watches the awesome display of firepower with calm detachment.

INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE -- TWO SHADOWY FIGURES

Stagger, blinded, out of the inferno. Hub drags a half-

conscious Tariq, where they are pounced on by commandos.

THE STADIUM -- NIGHT

Pac's and Tanks ring the stadium. An anti-terrorist perimeter

has been established -- concrete obstacles, sandbags and

razor-wire. Musco-lights cast their pitiless glow.

OUTSIDE THE PERIMETER

A mob of frightened parents, girlfriends, and furious fathers.

A LAWYER for the ACLU confronts a young Lieutenant.

A gaggle of JOURNALISTS try to force their way in...

Hub shows his ID. Is allowed to enter into:

THE DARK STADIUM TUNNEL

A MUFFLED CRY that might or might not have come from someone

in pain. His footsteps ECHO as he walks out to where:

2,000 DETAINEES

All young men between the ages of sixteen and thirty are

milling about. Squatting, smoking, pacing, some laughing,

most looking terrified. All spread across:

THE HALOGEN-LIT FOOTBALL FIELD

Armed GUARDS backlit in the upper tiers. Enlisted men passing

out blankets and soup. Nearby, Hub sees Tina, standing quite

still -- Finally, she is able to speak.

MOMENTS LATER -- ON THE FIELD

Hub asks for Devereaux, is directed across the field, through

an aisle in the wire cages. FRANK HADDAD looms out of the

shadows. He looks terrible, drawn. Furious.

Nearby, the "Allahuh Akbar," call, to evening PRAYER.

Hub watches as he he walks away. A MUEZZIN chants the call

to evening prayer. Frank drops to his knees and joins the

rest of the prisoners.

THE LOCKER ROOM

Has been transformed in a COMMAND POST.

The two men stare at each other.

Devereaux just looks at him as we CUT TO:

THE TILED SHOWER ROOM

Tariq is strapped, NAKED, into a folding metal chair. His

head lolls on his chest, his eyes are dulled. On a nearby

table, an empty syringe. Two MP'S stand guard.

Sharon is speaking softly to him in Arabic. Suddenly, Tarak

SPITS in her face. She wipes it off as if it is nothing.

Devereaux ignores him. Turns to Sharon.

No one wants to be the first to step into uncharted terrain.

Nobody answers.

Hub stares at Sharon -- as the dark side of her professional

life is revealed.

Another silence. They're teetering on the edge of the abyss.

Hub finally can't take another second. Even in theory.

Gen. Devereaux stares hard at Hub. And then:

Hub looks at Sharon, who looks away.

The two MPs lead Hub out of the room.

Sequence omitted from original script.

OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM -- HOURS LATER

Sharon emerges from the shower room. She is shattered. The

blood drained from her face. As if carrying with her all the

sin that was committed in the next room.

FROM INSIDE THE SHOWER ROOM

The sound of a GUNSHOT. The door opens and Devereaux emerges,

in the torment of a man of honor who is living a lie.

Devereaux turns and walks off down the corridor.

Sequence omitted from original script.

THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL

Glorious, alabaster stone -- floodlit at night. A symbol of

all that is good and free and just. Hub drives a rental car,

staring out at the monuments.

IN GEORGETOWN

Hub pulls up to a lovely TOWNHOUSE. Parked on the street, an

UNMARKED CAR from the Secret Service.

THE CHIEF OF STAFF

Opens the door, wearing a Dartmouth lacrosse team t-shirt.

In the background, we HEAR a three-year-old crying.

IN THE LIVING ROOM - LATER

Tasteful antiques, rag rugs and kids' toys.

His wife appears, holding a squalling baby, looking defeated.

She grits her teeth and goes upstairs.

He looks at Hub, shakes his head.

He hands Hub an ACCORDION FILE.

Hub looks at the file in his hands. Considering.

Hub looks up. Sharon emerges from the hallway.

Sequence omitted from original script.

ON THE STREETS OF GEORGETOWN -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Hub and Sharon sit in silence in Hub's rental car:

Her voice softens just a bit as memory takes over.

She thought telling the story would be easy, but there's an

enormous well of untapped feeling. She fights it back:

She turns away.

She doesn't want to reveal herself this way. Doesn't want to

be vulnerable. Doesn't want to cling to him. For a moment He

puts his arms around her, but it's like holding a beautiful,

dangerous predator.

She senses the hardness in his tone. Looks up at him, and

through tears, puts her game face back on.

The tears are streaming down her face now. Finally, she nods.

The streetlight catches Sharon's face. Her eyes are haunted.

THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- (TO ESTABLISH) -- NEXT MORNING

Sequence omitted from original script.

Sequence omitted from original script.

BOROUGH HALL PARK -- LATER THAT DAY

Hub and Frank are standing outside Hub's car, each on opposite

sides, blocking any opportunity to suveil what is happening

within.

Sharon sits inside with Samir. She uses a SCALPEL to make

the slightest INCISION under Samir's arm. The RADIO plays.

Into the incision she inserts a tiny plastic TRANSMITTER.

She turns off the radio.

OUTSIDE THE CAR

Hub and Frank glance inconspicuously around.

On a piece of paper he has scribbled, "Hit Hardwick. Safe

House. 11:00."

Hub then writes. "Bath-house. 12:00."

Hub looks at him. There's been little time for sentiment.

Sharon steps out of the car. In her hands is a device

resembling a PORTABLE OSCILLOSCOPE. A green dot appears.

He slips Sharon the scribbled notes. As she looks at them:

The car door opens and Samir steps out, buttoning his shirt.

Hub watches as she and Samir walk away.

SHARON AND SAMIR -- CONTINUOUS

They hurry through the park. Samir is extremely agitated,

eyes constantly darting from right to left.

IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

Colonel Hardwick, earphones on, overhearing them:

On Col. Hardwick's computer, a GRID MAP of Brooklyn.

A TRIANGULATED FIELD OF MICROPHONES

On a nearby rooftop, an Army spotter uses a parabolic with a

gunsight. Another mic is in a woman's shopping bag; another

is in a twenty year-old's boom box.

The light turns RED, they race across a crowded street.

THROUGH AN ARAB NEIGHBORHOOD

Where women in chadors carry mesh bags with tonight's meal.

INTO A CLEAN APARTMENT

Nothing but a single bed with a dirty white sheet. Sharon

enters and turns on the TV... loud.

She cuts the stitches under his armpit and begins to dig out

the transponder.

Sharon very deliberately wipes her BLOODY HANDS on the WHITE

SHEETS.

On TV, we SEE the MARCHERS in front of Brooklyn Borough hall.

Samir is staring at the TV.

IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

They appear as SPECTRAL images on Hardwick's microwave screen.

BOROUGH HALL

THE CROWD is getting fired up as the SPEAKER exhorts them.

SOLDIERS watch uneasily, not certain how to respond as the

crowd begins to CHANT, "No Fear! No fear!"

Sequence omitted from original script.

THE APARTMENT

Sharon goes to a closet and takes out some old clothes. She

TURNS OFF THE TV. Then:

IN THE VAN

Hardwick speaks into a handset.

SUDDENLY -- THREE UNMARKED FBI CARS

Seem to materialize out of nowhere -- boxing them in.

IN THE VAN

ON THE STREET

Undercover FEDERAL AGENTS roust Army CID agents. An FBI agent

with a deep drawl, spread-eagles one against a building:

The NYPD under the command of Danny Sussman -- roll up the

rest of the sound garden -- examine the parabolic microphones.

AGENTS WIELDING SHOTGUNS

Blow off the rear door of the surveillance van. Frank enters

and looks around at all the high-tech, microwave technology.

TWO WOMEN

In chadors, faces VEILED, descend a back staircase. Only as

their faces emerge from the shadows and are caught by a dim

bulb do we recognize Sharon and Samir.

Sharon unlocks a metal door to reveal THE HIDDEN COURTYARD

of a neighboring building. She and Samir hurry through a

back alley and out into an adjacent street.

BOROUGH HALL (WAS SHOT AS 194)

Where several APC's suddenly roar up and BLOCK off the square.

Devereaux stands nearby, watching as:

Soldiers in full RIOT GEAR emerge to form a battle line:

images of Selma, 1963; Chicago, 1968; Los Angeles, 1993.

THE MARCHERS LINK ARMS

Arab clerics and Hassidic rabbis, Black civic leaders and

Hispanic gang members -- all continue to CHANT, "No fear!"

"No Fear... No Fear..." Devereaux watches in dread as the

marchers close the gap on the battle-line of anxious soldiers

is this why he became a soldier?

A YOUNG GIRL unselfconsciously approaches a young soldier.

Looks into his eyes. Smiles. And walks past. Another marcher

walks right past a soldier, who does nothing to stop her.

Soon, they are all surging past the riot-line.

DEVEREAUX watches, as something is revealed to him, something

about America that, until this moment, he had forgotten.

IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

Frank is fiddling with the new technology like a kid at

Christmas. But something is wrong. Where once there were TWO

GHOSTLY IMAGES of Samir and Sharon in the apartment -- now

there is NOTHING.

ON HUB'S OSCILLOSCOPE

The RADIO-SIGNAL of Samir's transmitter still registers as

an unmoving, steadily blinking light. Hub is watching the

building. Frank steps out the van, his face pale.

HUB AND FRANK

Pound up the stairs of the building.

THE DOOR TO THE CLEAN APARTMENT

Bursts open. Hub comes in low and fast. Frank comes in hard

on his heels.

In the center of the otherwise empty room, the white sheet,

SMEARED IN BLOOD, is draped over a chair.

Hub stares in dread fascination.

And he's out the door in a heartbeat.

Sequence omitted from original script.

BACK IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

Frank and Hub listen to a playback of Sharon's conversation

with Samir on the digital recorders.

Frank looks up at Hub.

It hits them both at the same time.

Sequence omitted from original script.

EXT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN

Hub and Frank hit the street at a dead run.

BENEATH THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE

Samir opens a padlocked door with a key. He and Sharon

disappear within.

A HAMMAM

An Arab bath-house. Rays of sunlight play off the steaming

waters. Their footsteps ECHO off the tiled mosaic walls.

Sequence omitted from original script.

IN THE BATHOUSE

Samir kneels to touch the steaming water.

He starts taking off his clothes.

He finishes disrobing.

NAKED

He steps into the bath. With a sponge he washes his body.

The DISTANT SOUND of the approaching MARCH echoes off the

tiled walls as Samir steps out of the purifying waters and

takes a towel from a hamper.

From the hamper he takes a Sig-Sauer .9 automatic.

Sharon watches, in dread fascination, as he takes a white

egyptian-cotton FUNERAL SHROUD and drops it over his head.

THE MARCHERS

Are streaming down the street.

Hub and Frank desperately fight their way through a wild,

almost "carnival" feel.

BACK TO -- THE BATHS

Reflected in the purifying waters, Samir is putting civilian

clothes on over the shroud -- still holding the .9 on Sharon.

He turns away from her, opening the hamper.

BELT OF SEMTEX EXPLOSIVES

Comes next. Velcro straps fasten the belt around his chest.

He comes to stand beside her.

A VOICE from the top of the stairs:

Samir looks up, sees Hub aiming his .45. But Sharon is between

them, blocking his shot.

From outside, we HEAR the sound of the marchers' CHANTING,

"No Fear...! No Fear...!" Samir HEARS it, too.

They're all SCREAMING at once. Still Samir keeps inching

toward the stairs. Hub blocks the way.

Samir jams the gun into Sharon's ribs.

Sharon's eyes meet Hubs'.

Samir is edging ever closer. Starting up the stairs. Sharon's

eyes plead with Hub, begging for a kind of unholy redemption.

Hub's finger tightens on the trigger. But then slowly, almost

imperceptibly at first, he lowers his gun.

His left hand moves imperceptibly toward the RIPCORD of the

explosive device.

HIS FIRST SHOT

Rips through Sharon into Samir, blowing them both backwards.

HIS SECOND SHOT

Is to Samir's hand as it reaches for the ripcord.

THE THIRD SHOT

Is a killing headshot. Rolling him into the baths.

CLOUD OF BLOOD

Blooms in the cleansing water. The funeral shroud billows.

THE ECHO OF THE SHOTS

Still rings in the tiled room as Hub kneels beside Sharon.

Hub cradles her head.

FRANK HADDAD

Appears at the top of the steps. Behind him, two PARAMEDICS

race down to kneel beside Sharon. Hub is pushed aside as

they begin triage -- but it doesn't look good as suddenly,

she begins to convulse.

And then she begins to mumble, at first incoherently, and

then more clearly. We realize she's speaking Arabic.

And then Frank is standing above them. Tears in his eyes.

And Hub suddenly understands: she is preparing for her own

death. He holds her as she continues to pray in and out of

her two native tongues. Until, at last:

And she's gone.

OUTSIDE IN THE STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER

A block away, we can see the Marchers pass by. The chant of

"No Fear..." fades into the distance. But Hub has already

turned his back and is hurrying away.

EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

Hub hurries toward the Courthouse.

MOMENTS LATER - IN THE COURTHOUSE

JUDGE FRANKEL opens the door. He is taken aback by the blood

on Hub's clothes.

THE STADIUM COMMAND POST

Where Devereaux is watching coverage of the march.

He looks up to see Hub. He's carrying the ACCORDION FILE

that the Chief of Staff gave him.

Hub hands him the file. Devereaux takes it.

Hub would love to just... clock him. Instead:

He takes his gun from its shoulder holster.

Behind them, a COMMOTION as Frank and several agents force

their way into the room, followed by REPORTERS, who shout

questions as STROBES and VIDEOTAPE record the arrest.

OUTSIDE THE STADIUM

An NYPD car -- Devereaux within, pulls away, lights flashing.

HUNDREDS OF YOUNG ARAB BOYS

Emerge from tunnel and into the waiting arms of their mothers,

the tearful smiles of their wives and children. Hub and Frank

stand there, watching the reunions.

Hub has no answer. No one has the answer.
