The Child is the Father of the Man.

...the theory of black holes was developed before there was

any indication from observations that they actually existed.

I do not know of any other example in science where such a

great extrapolation was successfully made solely on the basis

of thought.  It shows the remarkable power and depth of

Einstein's theory.  There is still much we don't know, such

as what happens to objects and information that fall into a

black hole.  Do the reemerge elsewhere in the Universe, or in

another universe?  And can we warp space and time so much

that one can travel back in time?  Maybe someone will come

back from the future and tell us.

FADE IN:

The legend reads: OCTOBER 10th

EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - PREDAWN - 1969

Darkness.  Headlights bounce off thick sheets of RAIN.  6,500

gallon Esso OIL TRUCK barrels over wet studded pavement,

heading towards Manhattan.  It's going fast.  Too fast.

Up ahead...at the BASE OF THE BRIDGE:

A large reflective sign - lit up by arc lights: MEN AT WORK.

There are TWO WORK CREWS, several hundred feet apart.

THE FIRST CREW is CON ED.  A corrugated vacuum tube feeds

into an open MANHOLE.  A WORKER drops into the hole.

THE SECOND CREW is CONSTRUCTION.  They're at the apron of the

bridge securing lumber supports for the roadbed.

It's late and the men are tired.  A mistake is made.  A FORK

LIFT loaded with LUMBER fails to negotiate a turn...whacks

into an abutment... spilling its load onto the roadway.

Bad timing, because right now that Esso OIL TRUCK hits the

OFF RAMP.  Not a lot of time for the driver to react to a

roadway spewed with lumber.

He does his best.  Slams the brakes, spins the wheel, hits

the horn, but it doesn't matter: 18 wheels skid across the

blacktop - spitting thick smoke and burnt rubber, lifting off

the slick pavement...twisting...flipping...hemorrhaging oil

from its ruptured tanks...grinding its way towards...

MEN AT WORK.  Seconds to react as an 80,000 pound juggernaut

of death plows through parked cars like paper...crushing the

Con Ed equipment...lurching to a halt on top of the MANHOLE.

EXT. FIRE STATION - 9TH BATTALION - CONTINUOUS

TWO FIRE TRUCKS (1000 Gallon Pumper and Mack Tiller Ladder)

pull into the street.

EXT. LADDER TRUCK JUMPER SEATS - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

SIRENS wail, cherry tops spin.

FRANK SULLIVAN, 40, is strapped into an open-air jumper seat.

A real life hard charger, Frank is the kind of iron's man

fire fighters want coming in after them, should they get

caught in harm's way.  Kind-hearted and hard-fisted, he has

the grace and courage of a man living by his convictions.

Across from Frank sits GRAHAM GIBSON, 20.  A good-looking

African-American, "Gib" is a Fire Fighter Fourth Grade, a

tank man... and one nervous probie.

Through a window into the CAB, we SEE LT. BUTCH FOSTER, 50,

on a walkie-talkie.  A beefy old pro who's been through more

fires than he can remember.

A walkie-talkie sits in a cradle between Frank and Gibson.

Butch's voice continues as Frank calmly absorbs the

information, while at the same time.

Gibson taps his wristwatch.

Frank laughs.  Gibson grins, relaxes a bit.  Frank checks his

ROLEX DIVER'S WATCH.  Multiple SIRENS fill the dawn.

Frank's eyes harden.  His game face sets up.

EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

A tableau of impending danger.  Thick black OIL bleeds from

teh truck onto the street...pouring underneath the rig...and

into the MANHOLE.

POLICE urgently cordon off the area, evacuating the workers.

EMERGENCY PERSONNEL deal with the badly injured TRUCK DRIVER.

Firemen wedge sandbags between the hull of the truck and the

three-quarters covered manhole -- trying to divert the oil

away from the underground vault.

FIRE COMMANDER O'CONNELL yells at his men to finish the job

and get the hell away.

The BIG TRUCKS ARRIVE.  PUMPER ENGINE and Frank's LADDER

TRUCK -- rapidly guided into position by men on the ground.

Frank, Gibson, Butch and the rest of the unit are on the

ground instantly and ready for orders.  They are looking at a

nightmare ready to happen.  Frank takes in everything.

FIRE COMMANDER O'CONNELL and a CON ED SUPERVISOR approach.

Frank looks at the tanker over the manhole.  There is now

nobody around it.

Frank has been staring at the capsized rig.

Butch knows what he's thinking.  But it's too late.  Frank is

gone...slogging through the oozing oil to the hull of the

tanker.  He kneels over the three-quarters covered manhole,

using a flashlight to peer into the darkness below.  Sparks

from the loose cables spit off flashes of light as the cables

hiss and slap against the ceiling and walls of the vault.

And Frank is up, heading for his truck, signaling Gibson.

Frank grabs a "halaghan claw tool" and a walkie-talkie.

Gibson nervously picks out two helmet lights...and they are

off and running.

EXT. MANHOLE - CANAL & BOWERY - CONTINUOUS

Frank uses the "adz" to rip open the heavy manhole cover.

INT. MANHOLE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Frank and Gibson descend into the tunnel, strap lights on

their leather helmets to illuminate the damp darkness.  They

race down the subterranean passage.  The stench is thick.

Butch's voice suddenly booms out of the walkie-talkie:

Frank picks up the pace.  Charges ahead.  Guy's got balls.

Frank reaches the rusted 'submarine-like' VAULT DOOR.  Pounds

on the door... a faint response.  He goes to work on it with

the halaghan tool.  Gibson arrives...pretty rattled.  Frank

gives him a wink and a smile.  It's gonna be okay.

Frank digs down, suddenly the DOOR GIVES WAY

Oil and water rush from the VAULT, pouring over Frank and

Gibson, foaming into the tunnel.  But the door is mounted

three feet off the ground.  There is still three feet of oil

and water trapped inside.  And the smell of gas is now

overwhelming...

Frank probes the dark vault with the FLASHLIGHT BLADE.

Through smoke we see TWO MEN huddled in the corner, trapped

by three loose 'HOT' CABLES - WHIPPING AROUND THE TINY VAULT

LIKE AN ELECTRIC HYDRA.  Con Ed Worker #2 shivers, ankle

broken, leaning on older Con Ed Worker #1.

Gibson sprays the room, clearing out most of the smoke.

Frank steps into the vault.

Frank drops to his knees, ducking under the cables, shuffles

to center of the vault.  Places his hands at opposite ends of

the halaghan tool, hoping for the cables to pass directly

over his head.  A hairy beat, then...

Frank jackknifes out of the water, ramming the halaghan into

the ceiling.  It worked.  The teeth on the "claw-end" and the

spike on the "adz-end" are embedded into the concrete --

STAPLING THE CABLES TO THE CEILING.  Make that balls of

steel.

Gibson and Con Ed worker #1 help injured Worker #2 out of the

vault.  Frank checks to make sure they've cleared the vault

and lets go of the tool.

Frank jumps into the tunnel, hoists the injured worker over

his back and races back down the tunnel.

EXT. STREET - OIL TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

O'Connell and the few remaining cops & firemen run for it...

INT./EXT. MANHOLE - CANAL & BOWERY - CONTINUOUS

Frank, Gibson and the Con Ed men scramble towards the

manhole.  Butch and another fireman are waiting up top.  They

help the men -- who are covered in oil and slime -- up onto

the street.  And then they all tear away from the

manhole...around a corner... collapsing on the pavement

against a building.

K-A-B-O-O-M -- A MUFFLED EXPLOSION

The vault ignites, the tunnel "FLASHBACKS" -- a towering

geyser of FLAMES AND DIRT ERUPTING out of the manhole from

which Frank has just escaped.

In the distance, FLAMES erupt out of the other

manhole...engulfing the OIL TRUCK...blowing it into a million

pieces.

Through the INFERNO at the base of the Manhattan Bridge,

Frank can see that no one is hurt.  His eyes glistening with

adrenaline and relief, he sits back against the building and

throws an arm around Gibson.

Frank looks over at the hyperventilating Butch and smiles.

INT./EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - MORNING

Inside the tunnel.  Dark.  Moving fast.  Flashes of LIGHT

bounce off the shiny tile walls.  The deep throated ROAR of a

'67 HARLEY battles with Martha & the Vandellas' HEAT WAVE.

We are with Frank, wearing a leather jacket with the insignia

of his fire-fighting unit emblazoned on it, and a New York

Mets BASEBALL CAP pulled down tight, as he rockets his

chopper through traffic, out of the tunnel, and up into...

EXT. QUEENS - STREETS - CONTINUOUS

CREDIT MONTAGE begins as Frank cruises home.  It has STOPPED

RAINING.  Frank passes by billboards and other evidence of

the approaching METS/BALTIMORE ORIOLES World Series.

He circles a LITTLE LEAGUE ball field waving to some

OLDSTERS.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - QUEENS - CONTINUOUS

Frank glides the Harley alongside his house.  A feisty

DALMATIAN PUPPY ELVIS barks his welcome from behind a fence.

Feeling fatigued, Frank dismounts and enters teh backyard,

playing for a moment with Elvis while he uprights a TRAINING

BICYCLE, tidies up BASEBALL EQUIPMENT, and glances up at a

HAM RADIO ANTENNA secured to the roof, before entering

through a backdoor.  There is a sense of routine to all this.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The kitchen is empty.  Breakfast dishes in the sink.  Frank

flips on the RADIO.  It plays out under the rest of the

MONTAGE as coverage of the oil truck crash blends into other

news stories.

A note on the refrigerator reads: 8:15.  Hey, Bud.  I'm off

to work. Johnny's at school.  Elvis is fed.  I luvs you.

Setting a grapefruit and a slice of toast on the table, Frank

glances at the Daily News.  But his eyes are tired, he stares

off into space...letting go.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

A radio in the bedroom is tuned to sports news.  Frank soaks

in a hot bath.  He looks like he might fall asleep - and

does.

CREDITS END.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

CRASH!  A SOFTBALL BLOWS through the window from the

BACKYARD, landing on the rug next to the bed.  Frank bolts

awake, staring at the busted window.

He checks the clock.  It is 5:15.  He steps to the broken

window.  SEVERAL SMALL BOYS scurry from the yard.  Two

others, JOHNNY SULLIVAN and GORDO HERSCH, both 6, stand

frozen in place.  Elvis tears in circles around them.  All is

very quiet.  Then, from somewhere beyond the bedroom door, we

HEAR The Beatles' BACK IN THE THE USSR...

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

JULIA SULLIVAN, 32, is rockin' out, chopping vegetables.

Adorable, sweet and strong.  Strawberry blonde hair, sapphire

eyes, soft earthy vibe.  A beauty.

Frank, wearing FDNY sweats, moves into the kitchen flipping

the softball from hand to hand.  Julia turns to him and rolls

her eyes at the sight of the ball.  Say no more.

Without breaking stride, he gives her a smack on the lips and

steps to the screen door to the back porch.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Johnny stands nervously outside the door.  Elvis sits at his

side.  Gordo watches from the safety of his own porch next

door.  Frank opens the screen door, casts a stern look down

at his son.

And Frank drops the softball into Johnny's mitt, closes the

screen door and turns back into the kitchen.  Johnny turns

away into the yard.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

With a shrug, and sharing a kids will be kids smile with

Julia, he grabs a cold Rheingold from the refrigerator and

heads into...

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

...past a CONSOLE TELEVISION, to the HI-FI

Julia crosses her eyes, as if she could stop him.  Frank

moves to change records.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN

Suddenly, a PAN of spaghetti sauce bubbles over.

As Elvis' SUSPICIOUS MINDS plays, Frank steps back in, moves

up behind Julia, and takes her in his arms.

And he turns her around and they start to dance as Frank

sings along to Elvis, badly.

We follow the music as it drifts out into the YARD where we

can SEE Johnny and Gordo looking in at the weirdness.

Frank spots Johnny and Gordo staring at them.  He winks at

the boys and swings Julia into a Fred Astaire dip.

With a laugh, Frank drops Julia into another dip.  As the

music fades, we...

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - DUSK

CLOSE ON: BICYCLE TRAINING WHEELS lying on the sidewalk.

Johnny is precariously perched on his fire engine red

BICYCLE.  He wears a police badge and a whistle around his

neck.  Frank stands beside him, holding on to the bike seat.

We're on a quiet side street next to house.  It's the last

light of the day.

Hold on Johnny's eyes...fear.

Johnny takes a gulp of air, doesn't want to disappoint his

father, nods okay.

He starts pedaling.  Slowly moving forward.  Frank holds on

to the seat.  Frank's still hanging on - jogging along side.

Frank let's go.  Johnny's pumping those little six year-old

legs, but he starts to wobble out of control -- CRASH!

Johnny starts to cry, quickly gets up and runs back to the

house.  Julia comes out of the kitchen door.  Johnny runs

into her arms.

Johnny tears himself from Julia's arms, runs inside.

Frustrated, Frank lights up another cigarette.

Frank takes a deep drag on the butt.  Steps onto the YARD and

stares up at the starry night.

ANGLE ON UPSTAIRS WINDOW

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - JOHNNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

JOHNNY'S POV: Frank standing in the yard, wishing on a star.

Johnny looks up at the sky and makes a wish of his own.

PULL BACK & PAN UP TO STAR-STREWN SKY, CAMERA RACING TOWARDS:

EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS

Countless points of light blaze across vast blackness.  A

luminous blue sphere floats peacefully below EARTH.  We are

22,000 miles away in geosynchronous orbit.

MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR PIECE OF HARDWARE drifts into and fills

the frame - 1 1960's COMMUNICATION SATELLITE, NASA & HUGHES

logos affixed to the glistening aluminum hull.

All is still for some moments.  But then a sound disturbs the

quiet of the cosmos.  It's coming from the horizon.  From

something that looks like a hole in the fabric of space.

Bright streaks of starlight swirl around into that hole.

And slowly the satellite begins drifting towards it - pulled

in by some invisible force.

FOLLOW THE SATELLITE AS IT IS SUCKED INTO THE VORTEX.

INT. SPACE ANOMALY - CONTINUOUS

We look through the ripple of warped space-time.  As if

holding a lens to one eye, we glimpse two earths at once --

two identical North Americas.  The two earths turn

slightly...

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - DUSK - 1998

THROUGH the screen door, we are CLOSE ON A MAN'S FACE,

staring out... JOHN F. SULLIVAN, 35.  John's eyes tell us he

needs more than just a shave and a good night's sleep.  This

man has demons.  Right now he is LOOKING OUT AT:

SAMANTHA TAYLOR, 33.  A knockout.  Dark blonde hair, piercing

blue eyes.  Not happy.  She jams a suitcase into the back

seat of her car and starts back for the house.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Samantha strides in past John towards a washer/dryer.

She grabs clothes from teh dryer and exits to...

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

...towards a stairway beyond, John not far behind.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Samantha steps into the bedroom to an open suitcase and

travel bag.  She starts jamming the clean clothes into the

suitcase and then begins to close the case and bag.

Sam can't hold back anymore - she cries openly.

And suddenly Samantha's tears turn to anger.

John has no reply.  All he can do is watch as she takes her

stuff and heads for the door.

John stands immobilized in the middle of the room.  He looks

down and spots a TEDDY BEAR half stuck under a reading chair.

And then to a photo of him and Sam at a CARNIVAL SHOOTING

GALLERY.  Sam's holding the teddy bear.  John turns at the

SOUND of the backdoor slamming.  Looks out a window down to

Samantha getting in her car and driving away.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

John enters, goes straight for a half empty bottle of

BUSHMILLS IRISH WHISKEY.  As he brings the bottle to his

mouth...BRRRRING.  The PHONE.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Swigging Bushmills as he steps to a combination portable

phone/answering machine, John takes off his jacket.  We

notice two things: an NAPPED DETECTIVE SHIELD and a .38

REVOLVER.

BRRIING.  John grabs the phone.

BANG.  Slams down the phone.  And stares around the room.

WE'VE BEEN IN THIS HOUSE BEFORE -- 29 YEARS AGO.  This was

Frank and Julia sullivan's house.  Time has not been good to

it.  Furnishings haven't changed much, but the house is

missing the warmth it had when a family filled it with love.

John's eyes dart to a PHOTOGRAPH next to the desk.  It is a

picture of THE SULLIVAN FAMILY from back then.  Too many

memories.  He grabs his coat, heads out...

EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - QUEENS - EVENING

The field is EMPTY.  Covered in shadows.  John sits alone on

the top row of the BLEACHERS, cradling his bottle of

BUSHMILLS.  He takes a long pull.  As he stares down at the

empty field, his eyes slowly drift over to home plate...

AUDIO FLASHBACK: a VOICE rises up out of the darkness.  The

voice of memory...

We hear the SOUNDS of CHEERING parents.  The CLAPPING,

WHISTLING & SHOUTING is hauntingly juxtaposed against the

empty playing field and bleachers we see on the screen.

CRACK: sound of the bat solidly connecting with the ball.

CAMERA follows invisible runner from home to first base.

John takes a deep breath, glances from first base back to

home plate...then looks off into the distance - a cold

thousand yard stare.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - NIGHT

John shuffles up the pathway.  The SOUND of a TV - X-FILES -

filters out from inside the house.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

John walks in the front door.  GORDY JR., 8, carrying an

overstuffed BLT, whizzes by...

John notices smoke filtering out of his kitchen.

Follow John into the kitchen.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Meet GORDON HERSCH, 35, computer geek, lovable dough boy.

Last seen by us in 1969 as a six-year old.

John glances at a mound of burnt bacon dripping on the stove.

Gordy Jr. scoots into the kitchen.

Gordy Jr. runs out.  O.S. sounds of him rummaging through

hall closet.

John puts the Bushmills bottle down, and grabs two Molsons.

John laughs, hands Gordo a beer, and lights up a cigarette.

John reacts.  Nothing else needs to be said.  A beat, then...

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Gordy Jr. sticks out of the closet, attempting to drag out a

large BLACK STEAMER TRUNK, stenciled with yellow letters.

John thinks about it for a second.  Noting the curious glee

in little Gordy's face, nods OK.

Gordy Jr. pops open the latches, opens the trunk.  Gordo

crouches down beside his son, checks out the dusty contents.

HOLD ON JOHN'S REACTION to what Gordy Jr. finds in the trunk.

Gordy Jr. reaches in and takes out: FDNY HELMET & JACKETS.

Briefly puts on the enormous helmet, then sets it aside.

Reaches back into the trunk and pulls out the disassembled

pieces of a 12 gauge SHOTGUN.

Gordo takes the shotgun from the boy and places it gingerly

inside the closet.

Simultaneously, Gordy Jr. hands off a leather-bound SCRAPBOOK

to John.  Before John can react, Gordy Jr. lifts up an

AMATEUR RADIO TRANSCEIVER.

ANGLE BACK ON JOHN

Powerful memories fill his face.

CLOSE ON

the transceiver and microphone - mint condition 1965 Yaesu FT

101, and a "Silver Eagle" Astatic D-104 microphone.

Gordo looks at John.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Glass doors separate the study from the family room.  The HAM

RADIO is set on a dusty wooden desk.  Scotch-taped to the top

of the radio is a diagram for the radio setup and "QSL"

cards: certificates from around the world acknowledging

"contact" with "WB2YXB" -- FRANK SULLIVAN, BAYSIDE NY.

Gordo hooks up the radio.  Gordy Jr. shuts off the TV.

GORDO TURNS THE RADIO ON.  Shows Gordy how it works.  Gordy

rotates the tuning dial, nothing but "dead bands."  STATIC.

KNOCK.  Front door opens.  John's head turning around.  Meet

ELLEN, 35, Gordo's wife.  The grown-up in the family.

Ellen notices John's weary look but says nothing.  We get the

sense she knows what is wrong.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Gordo and family pour into the yard between the two houses.

John shuffles out behind them.  Gordo and Gordy Jr. quickly

disappear into their house, but Ellen lingers for a moment -

looking back at John standing alone.

Ellen holds her glance for a moment.   John smiles, thinly

masking his sadness.  Ellen nods okay, and she is gone.  John

looks up at the stars, then down to the HAM RADIO ANTENNA on

his roof, now looking raggedy from 29 years of neglect.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - LATER

CLOSE ON

TV: LARRY KING is interviewing STEPHEN HAWKING.

John is back on the Bushmills.  He races clumsily for the

CORDLESS PHONE.  CLOSE ON SPEED DIAL BUTTONS.  John hits #3.

John puts down the phone.  Stares at the FDNY trunk.  He

stumbles to it.  Sits down and opens it up.  It's filled with

his Dad's stuff.  He picks up and leafs through the old

SCRAPBOOK - PHOTOS and CLIPPINGS illustrate FAMILY HISTORY...

A quick glimpse of Dad's high school baseball team; Mom and

Dad's 60's wedding.

CLOSE ON PHOTO:

John at his First Communion pictured with his MOTHER - WE

SENSE LOSS AND SADNESS IN HIS EYES - THIS BOY LOOKS HURT.

A folded newspaper drops out.  John picks it up.  Front page

of the DAILY NEWS.  Top half READS: "October 13, 1969.

AMAZIN'S TAKE GAME 2 - SERIES EVEN."  The lower half READS:

"FIREMAN KILLED IN WAREHOUSE BLAZE"

He shoves the paper back in the scrapbook.  Puts the album

down - he can't deal with those wounds.  He glances up at the

TV:

NOTE:  Larry King's show plays for the duration of this

scene.

John settles in, takes off his work shirt.  Underneath he has

on a T-shirt.  We notice a NICOTINE PATCH on his arm.

Doesn't stop him from burning another Marlboro.

JOHN IS SUDDENLY STARTLED BY A NOISE FROM THE STUDY - A LOUD

BURST OF STATIC.

John gets up, Bushmill bottle in hand, and stumbles into...

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Approaching the desk, John sits down at the radio.  Reaches

out to the mic -- presses down on the red squawk bar.

In the BACKGROUND of FRANK'S VOICE, we barely hear WALTER

CRONKITE interviewing someone.

A pause.

As John releases the squawk bar, the distant sound of Frank's

TV filters out of the HAM.

And then John hears the sound of a door closing.

Despite his mood, John has to smile.

John warms to the topic of his boyhood heroes.

Static crackles out over the radio.  The signal weakens.

More static.

BZZZSSSSHHHH - loud static.  THE SIGNAL IS GONE.

Behind him, on TV, Larry King and Hawking continue talking.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1969

ANOTHER FINGER PRESSING DOWN ON THE RED SQUAWK BAR... FRANK

SULLIVAN.  Seated at the polished wooden desk.

Silence.  The signal is gone.  Frank leans forward, jiggles

the frequency dial, trying to regain the signal.  No luck.

Slightly frustrated, he stands and opens the glass doors to

the family room where Julia is watching TV - a very young

STEPHEN HAWKING is being interviewed by WALTER CRONKITE, 52.

He starts to take a step into the room, and stumbles over

Elvis, sleeping by the door...KNOCKING INTO and CRACKING a

GLASS PANE in one door.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - 1998

John, dog tired and more than a little wasted, gets up from

the desk, inadvertently leaving the Ham Radio ON, and

shuffles for the family room through the glass doors.

CAMERA HOLDS, CLOSE on the GLASS PANE...CRACKED in the exact

same spot where Frank knocked into it 29-YEARS AGO.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Frank unpins the police badge from Johnny's shirt, takes the

whistle from around his neck.  He pulls up the covers and

softly kisses Johnny's forehead.  You can tell he loves this

kid more than anything in the world.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - 1998

John plops down on sofa, half asleep.  The TV drones on.

The LEGEND reads:

OCTOBER 11th - FIRST GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES

Blue sky.  A SOFTBALL soars into view.  It drops down and

into a WILLIE MAYS' style basket catch by Frank Sullivan.

EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - QUEENS - DAY - 1969

The same Little League field that Frank circled on his Harley

yesterday, October 10, 1969.  And the same field at which

John sat in the stands drinking last night, October 10, 1998.

We are in the 9th inning of a friendly SOFTBALL GAME between

the local COPS and FIREMEN.  A lot of NYPD and FDNY T-shirts,

sweats and caps.  Plenty of Mets stuff, too.

Having made the catch, Frank coolly pulls the ball from his

mitt as he starts running toward the infield diamond.

Tagging up at 3rd, sorely tempted to try for home is SATCH

DELEON, 30, NYPD Detective.  Satch feints for the plate,

Frank feints the throw.  For a maddening, gleeful moment,

Frank has Satch caught between 3rd and home.

In the STANDS, Johnny Sullivan, Marge Hersch and the FAMILIES

of the other ballplayers scream for whomever they want to win

this game of chicken.

On the SIDELINES, Johnny, Gordo and the other KIDS serving as

BATBOYS and WATERBOYS, jump around in anticipation.

At HOME, Butch Foster stations himself to take the throw.

Suddenly, Satch fakes to 3rd, then bolts for home.  Frank

pegs it to Butch, who tags the sliding Satch.  Game over.

They square off.  Pretending to fight.  Julia steps between

them.  And they all descend into laughter.

Frank and Satch each wrap an arm around Julia and start off.

Within a step, Johnny slips in under Frank's other arm.

INT/EXT. BUTCH'S HOUSE - DAY - LATER

Close on a TV: PRESIDENT NIXON tosses the first ball to open

the 1969 WORLD SERIES.

REVERSE to see many of the PLAYERS and FAMILIES from teh

softball game are parked around a couple of TVs watching the

game.  BEER flows from a keg.  SOFT DRINKS are passed around.

HAMBURGERS and HOT DOGS are cooking on the BBQ.

Satch sits with Johnny and Gordo and some other kids.

Frank and Julia tend the BBQ.  Butch brings out some beers.

A fun day.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY - 1998

A DETECTIVE'S CAR pulls up next to a couple of BLUE & WHITES

at West 155th St.  The Northern tip of Manhattan Island.

Across construction barricades is a half-torn down GREEK

RESTAURANT.  Several UNIFORMS can be seen beyond it, looking

at something on the ground.

As John exits the car, the passenger door swings open and we

MEET a guy we haven't seen in 29 YEARS - SATCHEL DELEON, 59.

Shaved head, square jaw.  A ram-rod straight, craggy warrior.

Thirty-plus years on the force now endow him with a rare

combination of smarts, guts and sense of humor.

Spotting John and Satch, a UNIFORM approaches them.  They

keep on walking.

The uniform leads John and Satch around some overgrown weeds

to SEE a patch of freshly unearthed dirt...out of which

sticks a HUMAN SKULL and COLLAR BONE.

In the B.G., a CRIME SCENE unit can be seen arriving by van.

As Satch turns to talk to a second UNIFORM and a couple of

SURVEYORS, John notices a man raking leaves in a yard not far

away.  As he starts to him, to Satch:

INT. SHEPARD RESIDENCE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON FRED SHEPARD, 72.  As the scene unfolds, we can SEE

the half torn down diner/crime scene through a window.  Satch

oversees the operation.

MRS. SHEPARD, 70, hands John a cup of coffee.

John looks out the window.

John glances around the room - notes family PHOTOGRAPHS.

There's a picture of Shepard in younger days on a commercial

fishing boat.  Next to it a faded black and white picture of

Mrs. Shepard, 35.  A few pictures of the Shepards and their

YOUNG SON.  And at the end, a color photograph of the same

son, about 20, in DRESS BLUES, graduating from the Police

Academy - CLASS OF '64.

Shepard points to a frame above the fireplace: Distinguished

Service Medal, CARL SHEPARD, awarded posthumously.

Silence.  Mr. and Mrs. Shepard stand very still.  John

discreetly glances at his watch.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER

THUNDER in the distance.  CRIME SCENE personnel have made

some progress in unearthing the skeletal remains.  A couple

of drops of rain tap the ground and the bones.

John stands looking down at the skeleton.  A long beat.  And

then he turns to Satch and they start for the car.  Behind

them, the skeleton is carefully pulled free from the ground.

WE SEE its wrists are BOUND with GLASS TAPE.

INT. JULIA'S APARTMENT - MANHATTAN - EVENING - LATER

CHINESE TAKE-OUT CARTONS are placed in a microwave.

WIDEN TO REVEAL

the woman holding the cartons: JULIA SULLIVAN, 29 YEARS OLDER

than the last time we saw her.  But she looks okay, she looks

happy.

We are in the kitchen of Julia's Upper West Side apartment.

It is raining.  We notice THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE

outside a BAY WINDOW.

Julia hands John a Coke.  Close on her face - she feels her

son's pain.

Beat.

They share a laugh.  And then slowly the laughter dies.

John's expression changes as he quietly lights a cigarette.

Julia knows what he's thinking...

A long beat.

Julia glances at an old photo of Frank, then back to John.

PING.  The microwave timer sounds off.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CLEAR NIGHT - 1969

CLOSE ON

Frank's dog, Elvis.  Poking his nose in a carton of Chinese

take-out on the floor.  An arm drops into frame - scruffs the

puppy's back.  The Rolex diver's watch tells us the arm

belongs to Frank.

WIDEN TO REVEAL:

Frank sitting at his desk.  He fires up an unfiltered LUCKY

STRIKE, pops a Rheingold.  Next to him a Daily News headline -

NASA INVESTIGATES SPACE STORM.

Frank puts his finger on the squawk bar, about to say

something, but just at that moment his son Johnny appears in

the doorway in his pajamas.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - RAINY NIGHT - 1998

John Sullivan's face, thunderstruck.  The camera stays on

John.  He puts down his drink.

John looks up at the photo on the wall: FRANK, JULIA AND SIX

YEAR OLD JOHNNY SULLIVAN (CIRCA 1969).  A beat, then:

CUT TO CLOSE ON

NOW BACK ON

John's POV - top of radio - in FADED PEN, on a piece of

masking tape, is written: "WB2YXB"

The call letters hang in the air.  A breath, then...

Frank dropping his cigarette in the ashtray.  It rolls out

and lies smoldering on the desk.  He doesn't even notice.

BACK ON

Beat.

John reaches out to touch the radio.  But he stops, his hand

hovering just above it.

BACK ON FRANK.

He smells smoke, sees the cigarette burning a hole in the

desk.  Spooked, Smokey the Bear just started a fire.

Frank beats out the flame with the newspaper.

A DISTINCTIVE BURN SCAR GRADUALLY MORPHING ONTO JOHN'S DESK.

John pushes the Bushmills to the side, staring at the scar.

It hits him - hard.

John rubs his fingers over the old burn scar.

Eerie quiet, the only sound is the rain outside John's

window.

BACK ON

ON JOHN

reaching out, touching the radio.

Shockwave.  A long moment of absorption.  INTERCUT Frank and

John.

Frank glances at DAILY NEWS HEADLINE - SPACE STORM.  He says

nothing for a long beat, struggling to understand.

Frank pulls back from the radio...

John's voice has a conviction that Frank cannot deny.

Silence.  Both men trying to wrap their minds around the

reality of the situation.  Slowly accepting.

Beat.

ON FRANK

Johnny gave up baseball?

John takes a sip, the answer caught in his throat.

Quiet beat.  A burst of static crackles the air.

More static.  The signal breaks up, then returns weaker.

Heavy static now.  They can barely hear each other.

Both men frantic.  Their words overlapping...

Final blast of static.  The SIGNAL is GONE.  The BAND is

GONE.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Moonlight casts a glow over the sleeping Johnny.  Frank steps

in and stands looking down at him.

EXT. ROOF OF JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1998

John crawls out a window, through the rain, onto the roof.

JOHN'S POV

Rusted Ham radio antenna, half-fallen over.

John scoots over to it, straightening it.  But he slips,

sliding down the roof, coming to rest against the chimney.

A light pops on from an upstairs window across the street.

Gordo appears in the window.  Does a double take when he sees

John, sitting on the roof, soaked, drunk.

Gordo's heart starts to break.  His best friend has slipped

over the edge.

The LEGEND reads:

OCTOBER 12th - SECOND GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE/BUXTON SEED CO. - AFTERNOON - 1969

BLACK CLOUDS, EARTH SHATTERING THUNDER.  A massive BOLT OF

LIGHTNING rockets out of the menacing sky STRIKING THROUGH A

WINDOW on the 3rd floor of the warehouse.  A FIRE BEGINS.

INT. FIRE HOUSE - 9TH BATTALION/REC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

GAME 2 plays on TV.  Butch, Gibson and the rest of the unit

sit around enjoying the game.  A very distracted Frank stands

watching from the doorway to the kitchen.

We are in the bottom of the 9th with the Baltimore Orioles'

Brooks Robinson coming to the plate.

SUDDENLY THE ALARM SOUNDS, moving the groaning firemen

reluctantly to action, and freezing Frank in surging anxiety.

Gibson is up and passing Frank...who begins to move like he's

in a trance.

A RAPID MONTAGE of Frank, Butch and the others readying to

head out.  Gibson grabs a little TRANSISTOR RADIO.

Frank looks like he's going to throw up.

EXT. MANHATTAN ST. - COP BAR - DUSK - 1998

John, lost in thought, rounds a corner towards the bar.

EXT. STREET - LADDER TRUCK - MOVING - AFTERNOON - 1969

The LADDER & ENGINE trucks barrel out of the firehouse.

As SIRENS SCREAM, Frank and Gibson secure themselves into

position.  Gibson excitedly switches on his radio to the

game.  He notes that Frank is not the least bit into it.

Frank seems not to hear him.

From the RADIO we HEAR the last play of the game as Brooks

Robinson grounds out 3rd to 1st.  METS WIN!  CHEERS are heard

in the streets and from the CABS of the racing fire trucks.

Gibson whoops it up.  Frank barely acknowledges the win.

INT. COP BAR - DUSK - 1998

John moves through the crowd of cops - ad lib greetings -

slides into a booth occupied by Satch and Gordo.

John shoots a look at Gordo, who quickly changes the subject.

EXT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE - DUSK - 1969

Located off the East River in lower Manhattan.  The 9th

Battalion Fire trucks are first on the scene.  A couple of

GREEN & WHITES are already there, uniform cops keeping a few

onlookers at a safe distance.

FLAMES shoot out from the 4th and 5th FLOOR WINDOWS.

Starting to lick their way up to the 6th floor and roof.

SMOKE billows out of the windows on the 3rd and 2nd floors.

Lighter smoke spirals out from the door on the 1st floor.

Frank, Gibson and other firemen under Butch's command take

stock of the situation and start to deploy.

HOSES are run from HYDRANTS to the PUMPER TRUCKS.

The LADDER is swung into position for an assault on the roof.

Frank nods in agreement.  Directly above them, another BOLT

OF LIGHTNING CRACKS through the darkening sky.

A death shudder creeps up Frank's spine.  And for the first

time in his life, Frank Sullivan is SCARED SHITLESS.

Frank stares up at the sky, transfixed.  THUNDER punches the

sky with a huge roar.  RAIN starts to fall.

And in the distance, as if from inside the burning building,

a FAINT SCREAMING is first heard, and growing louder.

Suddenly, out of the building runs a STONED TEENAGE GIRL

screaming and babbling incoherently.

Immediately galvanized, Frank moves to the girl.

She starts to calm down.

Frank looks to Butch.  A beat.  Butch gives him the nod.

Frank and Gibson gear up and go.

INT. COP BAR - DUSK - 1998

Satch and Gordo nod in sympathy.  Gordo raises his glass.

Satch and John follow.  A yearly ritual.

INT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE - DUSK - 1969

Frank and Gibson step into the warehouse.  Butch behind them.

Flames haven't reached this area yet, but the ROAR of the

fire above them is deafening, and smoke billows down THE

STAIRWAY before them.  They sprint towards it and start up.

ONE FLOOR.  TWO FLOORS.  THREE FLOORS, and suddenly they are

face to face with a WALL OF FIRE blocking access to the 4th

floor.

Frank and Gibson stop and stare into the inferno.

And he barrels through the line of fire onto the 4th floor.

Gibson starts to do the same when the 5th floor gives way

above Frank, sending burning timber and debris cascading

around him and cutting off Gibson's route.

Now Frank's only way to go is up the stairs toward the 5th

floor.  He turns to Gibson.  Coming up behind him is Butch.

Across a gulf of flames Frank yells and waves at them to get

the hell out.  And then suddenly, part of the 3rd floor

around Gibson and Butch starts to go.

Frank turns and bolts for the 5th floor as a huge flaming

BEAM CRASHES down onto the stairway behind him, forcing

Gibson and Butch to scramble like hell back down the stairs.

INTERCUT WITH

EXT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Fire fighters are efficiently and expertly hard at it.

Running out lines.  Extending ladders.  Moving a FIRE BOAT

into place - all communicating via walkie-talkies all on teh

same frequency.

The BIG LADDER is now in place.  As it telescopes up, the

ROOF MAN, BILL CAWLEY, begins his climb.

PUMP TRUCKS and THE FIRE BOAT keep pumping water onto the

blaze.  But no matter.  For the moment, this is one OUT OF

CONTROL NIGHTMARE FIRE.

BACK TO

Frank reaching the 5th floor.  It's an inferno.  He keeps

moving, tearing up the stairs for the 6th floor.

EXT. WAREHOUSE BUILDING/LADDER - CONTINUOUS

ROOF MAN edges up the ladder, as it telescopes above him.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

FIRE has torched OPEN a GAPING HOLE IN THE ROOF.

Frank peers around through the smoke and fire and rain.  Then

he sees, huddled in the temporary saftey of the corner of an

OFFICE, but trapped by a fallen CONDUIT, the GIRL, passed out

from smoke inhalation.

INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

A HIPPIE CRASH PAD

Frank dashes into the office and heaves the conduit off the

girl.  He hoists her over his shoulder and heads out.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Butch and Gibson exit the warehouse past the HOSE CREW

already working its way into the building.

They look up to the top of the warehouse where the LADDER is

haltingly inching its way up the side of the building.

INT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE/6TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

The fire on this floor is now a raging inferno.  Flames shoot

up from the stairway below through the open roof.  Surrounded

by fire, Frank, carrying the girl, strides for what looks

like a WINDOW on the south side of the floor.

But apprehension rips across Frank's eyes as he reaches the

window and looks down to see.

EXT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The top end of the ladder FROZEN some 10 FEET BELOW THE

WINDOW.  BETWEEN WALKIE-TALKIES.

INT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

EXT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Butch and Gibson are now by the base of the LADDER TRUCK

which is near the canal side of the building.  Butch screams

at the ladder OPERATOR.

INT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE - 6TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Frank clicks off the walkie-talkie and turns to survey the

hell around him.  The STAIRWAY IS GONE.

To the RIGHT is a DOOR, flames around it, but none coming

from the room beyond it.

To the LEFT, another DOOR, a metal one, this one surrounded

by fire - flames licking out all around it from room beyond.

EASY CHOICE.  Frank turns, heads towards DOOR ON THE RIGHT.

No.  Wait.  HE STOPS.  SOMETHING'S WRONG.  HEART POUNDING,

LUNGS COLLAPSING, EYES & SKIN BURNING, EVERY FUCKING BRAIN

CELL SCREAMING...THINK!

WE HEAR JOHN'S WORDS ECHO IN FRANK'S HEAD:

And for the first time in his life, Frank Sullivan goes

against his instincts and his training as he...

TURNS BACK AROUND AND GOES THE OTHER WAY.

INT. COP BAR - DUSK - 1998

Gordo is in the middle of a story when...

...something happens - TIME STUTTERS AND REPEATS:

The effect is like a phonograph needle stuck in the groove.

It lasts only a second and nobody seems to notice.  Nobody

except John, who looks wildly disoriented.  He grabs hold of

the edge of the table as if to keep his equilibrium.

John breaks into a cold sweat.  His HEART POUNDING AWAY.

INT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE - DUSK - 1969

Franks reaches the door on the LEFT.  White heat and flames

shoot everywhere...A FUCKING FURNACE.  He tires to open it.

IT'S LOCKED!  WHAM!  Frank kicks at it.  WHAM!  WHAM!  The

door blows open and flames leap out, the energy of the blast

tossing Frank and the unconscious girl back onto the floor,

fire surging over their heads.  But then...

He sees something on the other side of the doorway, inside

the room, on the far wall.:

A SMALL METAL SWINGING DOOR.

INT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE/CHUTE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank cradles the girl.  Gets down on his knees, crawling

under the heat.  Reaching the SWINGING DOOR.  Pushes it open,

revealing:

A smooth metal SPIRAL SEED BAG CHUTE.

Frank rips open his jacket and bundles the girl to him.  He

works himself and the girl onto the top of the chute.

The ROOM BEGINS TO SHAKE.  BRICKS TUMBLE OUT OF THE WALL.

The whole GODDAMN BUILDING is going to COLLAPSE.

Frank lurches forward until he and the girl start to move

down the chute.

INT. WAREHOUSE CHUTE - CONTINUOUS

As Frank and the girl plunge through the bowels of the

inferno...large portions of the building begins

disintegrating around them...a giant storm of BRICKS, MORTAR,

METAL AND BURNING WOOD biting their tails...

Gaining speed through each up-rushing floor...5-4-3-2...Frank

and the girl zoom down towards the END OF THE SLIDE only to

find IT'S BOARDED UP.  OH SHIT!

Frank grips the girl tight, raises his BOOTS, bends his

knees, and like a HUMAN BATTERING RAM, SMASHES THROUGH THE

ROTTED PLYWOOD BOARDS

EXT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE/EAST RIVER CANAL - CONTINUOUS

THEY'RE AIRBORNE.  Frank and the girl.  Floating in SLOW

MOTION out over the CANAL and landing in the water between

the WAREHOUSE DOCK and the FIREBOAT.

A YELL snaps Butch's and Gibson's attention to what is

happening.  Gibson starts running for the CANAL, ripping off

his coat and hat before leaping into the water.  But Frank is

getting pulled down by his fire tank and the weight of the

girl.  Finally, Gibson reaches him, taking the girl.  Frank

quickly sheds his jacket and the tank.

Butch stands watching on the dock.  He takes a moment to

close his eyes in thankful prayer.

Hitting the water has shot the girl back to consciousness.  A

look passes between her and Gibson.  A look he won't forget.

SILENCE.  Then the thunderous SOUND of the WAREHOUSE CAVING

IN on itself, sending flames shooting high into the sky.

Frank lies back, floating on the water, the rain pelting

around him, letting the miracle of it all, take him over.

CRASH!  A GLASS OF WHISKEY SHATTERS ON THE TABLE.  WE AR:

INT. COP BAR - DUSK - 1998

It happens again.  Time stutters and repeats.  As if the film

sprockets were caught in the projector.

CRASH!  The GLASS SHATTERS AGAIN!  CRASH...CRASH...

Camera ratchets into the exploding storm of the flying glass,

ice and whiskey.  And then time stops as we hold close on a

frozen shard - in it, the cracked reflection of John's eye.

The camera moves through the reflection and into.

JOHN'S EYE

A burst of light and then...distorted images.  Like looking

at reflections through a smashed mirror.  The cracks gel, and

we are in...

MONTAGE.  A SERIES OF QUICK FLASHING IMAGES.

1969: Frank, Johnny, Butch and Satch at the World Series.

1971: Johnny and Gordo sitting on Frank's lap, at the Ham.

1972: Frank and Johnny, playing catch.

1976: Johnny winning a swimming race at Longbranch Boys Club,

Frank cheering.

1984: Frank, Julia and Satch beaming with pride as John

graduates from the police academy.

These images appear as DISJOINTED FRAGMENTS OF NEW MEMORIES -

A PAST THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE.  A past where Frank Sullivan

didn't die in that fire.

It's like watching random frames from the Sullivan Family's

8mm home movies as John's brain struggles to absorb decades

of NEW MEMORIES in the span of seconds.

JOHN'S POV

Normal vision slowly returning.  The broken glass is rocking

on the table.

INT. COP BAR - CONTINUOUS

John doesn't respond.

Beat.

His hand shaking, John takes a long sip of his beer.  Gordo

and Satch exchange a concerned look.

A loaded silence.  Three guys looking at each other, thinking

very different things.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1969

Nothing but static.  Frank jiggles the frequency dial.

Silence.  And then a voice...

Frank turns.  Johnny, sleepy faced, wrapped in his blankie,

stands just outside the room - he looks a little scared.

Johnny shuffles over, Frank lifts him up on his knee -

brushes the hair out of his face...and gets an idea.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Streetlights flood the tree-lined street.  Frank & Johnny

standing next to the little red bicycle.

CLOSE ON

Johnny's eyes: SHAME & FEAR - doesn't want to disappoint his

father again, but too scared to get on the bike.  Frank

reaches out, holds Johnny's hand.

A long beat.  Johnny takes a deep breath, nods OK, slowly

getting on the bike.  Frank's holding on to the seat.

Johnny takes a gulp of air, starts pedaling.  Slowly moving

forward.  The bike picks up some speed.

Frank's still running alongside, holding on to the seat.

Frank lets go.  Johnny keeps pumping those little six-year

old legs.  A bit wobbly at first, but he's gonna make it.  On

Johnny's eyes: determination & self-confidence.

ON FRANK'S FACE

The proud father.

OVERHEAD SHOT

Johnny blissfully riding around Frank in a big gentle circle.

Frank slowly spins around keeping his eyes on his Little

Chief.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1998

John walks in the front door, takes off his coat...

The house looks different.  Cleaner, furnishings less ragged.

John moves through his home, taking in the subtle changes.

He reaches the study.  And there, beside the desk, is

something that makes him stop:

A PHOTOGRAPH on the wall beside the desk -- FRANK, JULIA &

FOURTEEN YEAR-OLD JOHNNY SULLIVAN.

The picture changed.  John aged from 6 to 14.  Julia's

hairstyle and clothes changed from 60's to 70's.  Frank's

hair receded and grayed.  Jon is staring at evidence of a

history that didn't exist before.

John grabs the old family scrapbook he found in Frank's

trunk.  Opens it, unfolds "FIREMAN KILLED" CLIPPING.

The main headline still reads: "OCTOBER 13, 1969.  AMAZIN'S

TAKE GAME 2.  2-1 LEAD.  SEE SPORTS."

But the sub headline now reads: "FIREMAN RESCUES RUNAWAY FROM

INFERNO"

John turns, stares at the radio questioningly.  He starts to

sit down at the desk when he spots something on the front

edge of it.  WORDS CARVED INTO THE WOOD, 29 YEARS AGO by fire

fighter Frank Sullivan.  The day John saved his father's

life: I'M STILL HERE CHIEF

The last letter is missing.  But then a patch of wood starts

to morph - as if it were being carved by an invisible knife.

A BURST OF STATIC.  RADIO CRACKLES TO LIFE.

CLOSE ON FRANK

One hand on the squawk bar, the other holds the jack-knife he

is using to finish carving the letter F.

INTERCUT FRANK AND JOHN

Frank cuts himself off in mid-sentence.

John hesitates for a moment.  Lights up a smoke.

But John looks troubled.  Something bothering him.  He takes

a hit off his cigarette.

Both men are silent for some moments.  The hum of static.  A

breath, then --

Frank grips the radio mic, stunned.

The static grows.  John leans into the mic

John's voice cracks, choking back the tears.

A blast of static.  The signal is gone.  It is quiet.

John leans back.  Takes a breath.  Reaches out for the phone.

CLOSE ON PHONE'S THREE SPEED DIAL BUTTONS.

John HITS #3.

As John slowly hangs up the phone, something catches his eye.

Something that wasn't there yesterday.

LONGBRANCH BOYS' CLUB SWIMMING TROPHY...A GREAT SUMMER.

INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - LATE NIGHT - 1969

Through several glass windows a CLOCK READS: 11:52 PM.

Julia and other medical personnel are working on a heart

attach victim and they are winning.  She is in charge and she

is impressive.  Cool...efficient...expert.

A sixth sense causes her to look up to see:

FRANK.

Standing behind the windows.  Motionless.  Gazing at his

wife.

Julia holds on him for a split second, concern and surprise

etching across her face.  She turns back to her work, then

says something to another ER nurse, who nods okay.  Satisfied

the patient is out of the woods, she peels off her gloves and

heads for the door.

INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Julia steps through the door as Frank approaches.

He takes her in his arms, snuggling his head against her

neck, losing himself in the scent of her hair.

It's hard to tell, we can't see his face, but it looks like

Frank is crying.

But Frank is silent.  So they just stand there, holding each

other.  And then Julia notices the burn and scrape marks on

Frank's arms and neck.

Frank pulls his head back, looks into his wife's eyes and

kisses her on the mouth.  It's a long kiss.

As they come up for air.

Julia sees something through a glass door that stops her

short.  A YOUNG INTERN is standing over a gurneyed PATIENT.

The YOUNG INTERN is changing the I.V. BAG.

He knows she's back on the job.  Waves "no problem."

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS

Julia interrupts the Young Intern as he hooks up the bag.

Julia quickly shuts off the I.V.

The intern steps back: "Oh shit."  Julia takes charge.

The patient stirs: a SCRAGGLY HIPPIE, looks kind of like

Pacino in SERPICO.  A breathing mask covers his bearded face.

Barely conscious, his eyes focus on Julia.

After a quick double check of the patient, Julia looks up.

Through the glass door she can see Frank watching.

The clock on the wall now reads: 12:01 AM.

And the LEGEND reads:

OCTOBER 13th - WORLD SERIES TRAVEL DAY

INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY - 1969

SURREAL IMAGES.  SOMEONE'S POV...

MEN and WOMEN, standing and sitting, seen only from teh waist

down.  All wearing dark cloths and speaking in hushed voices.

A recognizable VOICE?  The edge of a CASKET?  A NIGHTMARE.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT - 1998

John is bathed in SWEAT.  He twists to CAMERA and his eyes

pop open.  A glazed, confused look pours out of them.

SEE past an empty bottle of BUSHMILLS on the night stand - a

clock READS 12:01 AM.

INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

THE NIGHTMARE REPEATS - like some horrible instant replay.

MEN and WOMEN, standing and sitting, seen only from the waist

down.  All wearing dark clothes and speaking in hushed

voices.  FLASHES OF FACES SWIMMING INTO THE POV...indistinct,

blurring into each other.  Is that UNCLE BUTCH?  SATCH?

GIBSON?

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - BEDROOM / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A terrified and disoriented John stumbles out of bed.  He

moves to the bathroom.  But he stops.  Something is wrong.

The bedroom has changed.  It looks like a DUMP.

John shakes his head, trying to blink away the nightmare.

But the room does not change back.  He goes to teh bathroom.

Splashes his face.  He looks up to the mirror and...

INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

The same horrible instant replay.  Flashes of faces swimming

into the POV...

JOHNNY'S POV

He is CROUCHED UNDER A TABLE.  STARING AT THE CASKET.  Alone.

Bewildered.  Crying.

A MAN, seen only from teh waist down, approaches the table.

As he crouches down his face drops into the frame.  It is

FRANK.  His face etched in a terrible pain.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

The kitchen looks different: dirtier, uncared-for.  John

looks different too: like a guy on the tail end of a lifetime

bender.  He cracks open a Bushmills.  Pours a couple of shots

into his instant coffee.  Several sips to settle his nerves.

He reaches for the cordless phone and HITS SPEED DIAL #3.

Confused, John clicks down the receiver.  His hand is shaking

as he punches the speed dial button for the second time.

On the slam of John's phone, we got to...

INT. JULIA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - MANHATTAN - MORNING

John knocks on the door.  It opens to reveal a Jamaican woman

clutching a crying infant, a toddler hanging off her leg.

Behind them we half recognize Julia's apartment.  We know

it's her apartment because of the BAY WINDOW and the view of

THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.  But everything else is

different.  Different furniture.  Different pain job.

John stands speechless.  The Jamaican woman regards him...

John just stands there, lost, questioning his grip on

reality.  Liquor on his breath, fear in his eyes, he is a

scary sight.  Jamaican woman does the smart thing - she slams

the door.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - DETECTIVE SQUAD - COFFEE ROOM - LATER

ON SATCH, scavenging the fridge while absorbed in some

papers.

Through the open door he SPOTS JOHN across the squad room.

Even at that distance, Satch can see John's unsteady walk and

fucked up demeanor.  Satch's eyes go to stone.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

John leans over the sink, wet paper towels pressed to his

face.  He barely reacts to the SOUND of the door.  He does

react to the silence that follows.  Satch stands in the

doorway...looking him over.

A long silence.

John moves for the door.  But Satch grabs him, slams him

against the wall.  Startled, John freezes.

John shrugs, sagging against the wall.

Satch steps back.  An awkward beat.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - DETECTIVE SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Satch and John approach their adjoining desks.  Satch slides

an 8X10 PHOTO off the top of an OLD YELLOWED POLICE FILE and

hands it to John.  It is a picture of the skeleton discovered

behind the Greek Diner.  But what catches John's attention,

what picks at his subconscious, is the decaying GLASS TAPE

binding the wrists.

John looks from the photo to the file on Satch's desk.  It

reads: NIGHTINGALE MURDERS.  John slowly sinks into his

chair.

John fixes on the file.  Then slowly reaches for it.  It's

filled with police and forensics reports.  And PHOTOS.  Crime

scene shots of 9 DEAD WOMEN.  Linked by TWO gruesome details -

they were all GARROTED, wrists bound with GLASS TAPE.

John turns over the last PHOTO and his heart stops...his

universe crashing down on him.

CLOSE ON THAT PHOTOGRAPH: A MURDER VICTIM.  GARROTED.  GLASS

TAPED WRISTS.  JULIA SULLIVAN.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Julia is at the door watching Frank tuck Johnny in.  Johnny

wears his Mets' cap and cradles his baseball glove.  He's in

that exhausted/excited kid moment before sleep sets in.

Johnny's eyes close.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Marvin Gaye plays from the HI-FI.  Frank grabs a beer, as

Julia comes in -- putting on her coat while taking her keys

from a hook.  She's wearing her nurse's uniform.

Frank takes her in his arms.  Starts to move her to the

music.

They kiss.  And dance.  And kiss.  And dance.  He starts to

slip her coat off.  She laughs and wriggles away from him.

Naughty boy.  And she is out the door.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - NIGHT - 1998

John pulls in past SAMANTHA'S CAR as she comes out the back

door with the Teddy Bear and other stuff she left behind.

John gets out of his car, clutching the 'Nightingale' file.

his eyes are red, swollen by tears and booze.

The answer is no.  He looks terrible, as haunted as any man

could possibly be.  He doesn't mean to, but he snaps --

Samantha jumps, frightened.

John turns, lost and ashamed.  Sam walks to her car and

starts to cry.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

John enters, plunks the Nightingale file on the desk.;  He

stares at the FAMILY PHOTOGRAPH on the wall.

JULIA IS MISSING.   A look of loss in Frank and John's faces.

John fingers the Nightingale file.  A nightmare.

He hits the ANSWERING MACHINE BUTTON to hear Samantha's

halting message.  As that plays...

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

John steps to teh counter and pours himself a stiff

Bushmills.  Turns and steps back into...

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

John collapses in the chair.  Stares at the words carved in

the desk - I'M STILL HERE CHIEF.  He rubs his fingers over

the smooth carving...his eyes going to the radio.

A quiet moment.  John slowly puts his hand on the squawk,

leans into the mic...

A long beat.  The hum of static.  And then...

INTERCUT FRANK AND JOHN.

A dreadful moment of silence.

Silence.

Long beat.  You could hear a fuckin' pin drop.

Eerie silence as John's words hang in the air.

John takes a long sip from the Bushmills.

Frank takes a deep breath, swallows some air.

John grabs the THICK YELLOWED POLICE FILE.  Opens to homicide

report on Karen Reynolds.  CLOSE ON FORENSIC PHOTO

INT./EXT. KOREAN GROCERY - EVENING - 1969

A woman waits to pay for a mini pack of Kleenex and some gum.

KAREN REYNOLDS.  A wool coat over her Nurse's uniform.

Frank's and John's voices continue over the scene.

As Karen moves to the cash register, the CAMERA WIDENS TO

REVEAL FRANK, awkwardly pretending to read a magazine.

Frank readies to follow her when he suddenly trips over a

crate of vegetables and goes down on one knee.

Karen looks in the direction of the accident, and for a split

second, her eyes lock with Frank's.  Embarrassed, Frank looks

away as he rights himself.

Frank edges out of the grocery store as Karen steps into the

street and dodges traffic towards a corner BAR/RESTAURANT at

the end of the block, past a heavily overgrown VACANT LOT.

Frank follows Karen across the street and finds himself, just

as Karen enters the bar, at a point near the murder site

described by John.  He pauses to stare at it.

INT. COZY'S BAR & RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

Frank enters the place.  Sort of a singles atmosphere, but a

comfortable one.  It's HAPPY HOUR.  On the TV, the Mets' Gil

Hodges offers his analysis of Game 3.

Frank looks about, down the bar and into an area with booths

and tables.  A few folks at the bar.  A group of YOUNG WOMEN

laughing in a booth.  But NO KAREN REYNOLDS.  Frank's blood

runs cold in a spasm of panic when...

Frank wheels around just as Karen passes him from teh LADIES

ROOM.  There is the trace of a bump, enough for Karen to take

note of Frank.  Ad lib EXCUSE ME.  She then starts moving

down teh bar towards the booth of young women.

Frank checks out everyone in the bar, not knowing quite what

he's looking for.

Karen slips into the booth with her friends.  Ad lib HELLOS.

Frank orders a beer, but his eyes are fixed on the booth.

Karen and a friend take note of Frank staring at them.

Embarrassed, he turns away, checking his watch: 6:40PM.  And

at just that moment a SCRAGGLY MAN passes by, taking a seat

at the end of the bar.  We have seen this man before.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - DET. SQUAD - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

Satch and a YOUNG DETECTIVE stand at the sinks, washing up.

Satch shrugs a yes.  Wipes his hands and heads out into the

squad.  The Young Detective follows.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - DETECTIVE SQUAD - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON SQUAD ROOM WALL CLOCK: 6:45PM

John's at his desk.  Keeps glancing at the phone, fiddling

with the NIGHTINGALE FILE... A PHOTOGRAPH OF KAREN REYNOLDS.

Satch passes John on his way to the coffee machine.

John shakes his head no.  Young Detective joins Satch at the

coffee machine.  John overhears:

Young Detective nods, impressed.  John is less impressed.

INT. COZY'S BAR & RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 1969

BOTTLE OF RHEINGOLD drops into frame next to half empty one.

Frank glances at the women in the booth.  They're all looking

at him, smiling.  A big one from Karen.

His watch says 7:05.  Taking the new bottle, Frank steps from

the bar, past the Scraggly Man and walks to the booth.

Charmingly shy, Frank is kind of at a loss for words.

And Frank takes a seat, sliding in next to Karen.  An awkward

moment for him as she takes a closer look at his face.

General laughter all around.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - DET. SQUAD - NIGHT - 1998

John has a CORKBOARD set up next to his desk.  On it he has

arrayed several photos of the Nigthingale victims under the

dates of their murders.  He looks over at the photos, then at

the forensics photo of Karen Reynolds on his desk.  BRRING!

John shoots a look at the wall clock.  It reads: 7:45.

Satch is alerted by John's sudden burst of energy.

INT. COZY'S BAR & RESTAURANT - NIGHT - 1969

At the bar, the Scraggly Man stares at Frank and the women.

Franks checks his watch as he tells a story.  It's 7:50.

The women around him are clearly enraptured.

In B.G. - at the bar - the Scraggly Man, looking frustrated,

slides off his stool and strides out of the place.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - NIGHT - 1998/EXT

John hangs up the phone.  Satch looks at him, "Whatta we

got?"

But for some strange reason John has stopped listening to

Satch.  Something else has got his full attention.  It is the

Nightingale file that lays open on his desk.  It is

changing...Karen Reynolds' forensic photo disappears. In fact

everything about her, all evidence of her murder - police

reports, photos, witness reports - is GONE.

John's eyes shoot to the corkboard.  The head shot of Karen

Reynolds and the date of her murder are also GONE.  John

looks between the file and the board.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT - 1969

Frank and Julia stand on the porch, eyes on Johnny - up past

bedtime, proudly riding his bike up and down the street.

Frank doesn't take the bait.

Beat.

It takes her a moment to absorb what he just said.  And then

she gets it... he's talking about a game.

She kisses him on the forehead and heads into the house.

A quiet beat.  And then...

We are now...

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1998 & 1969

INTERCUT FRANK AND JOHN

Frank jots down the info.  Fires up a Lucky.

A soft burst of static.  The signal returns a little fuzzy.

Frank takes a beat, contemplating the cigarette in his hand.

Julia walks into the study.

ON FRANK

realizing something.

Sensing that somehow this is important to her husband, Julia

gives in, willing to play along with his radio game.  She

shares Frank's chair, he puts his arm around her.

Hearing voices, Johnny, Gordo and Elvis wander in from the

family room.  They are in their pj's...a sleepover.  Julia

gives them a smile, turns back to the radio.

Little Gordo reaches for the microphone.

Julia scoops Johnny up, carrying him off to bed.  But little

Gordo does not follow...fascinated by the radio.

Frank laughs, as Gordo climbs up on his lab.

John sits back, marvelling at how young Gordo sounds.  A

thousand childhood memories playing in his head.  And then he

lights up...realizing the opportunity.

Gordo looks at Frank: is this for real?  Frank nods, smiling.

The sound of Julia's voice calling Gordo to bed.  Gordo

scampers out.  Static filters through both radios, then...

BZZZZ-SHHH.  A burst of loud static.  The band goes dead.

John takes a beat to come down.  He gets up, making his way

into the KITCHEN.  There's a half-full bottle of BUSHMILLS on

the counter.  John reaches out to grab but the bottle.  But

then he stops.  It is time to stop.  John turns on the faucet

and dumps the booze down the drain.

The LEGEND reads:

OCTOBER 15th - FOURTH GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES

INT. FINELLI HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - DAY - 1998

CLOSE ON

a white vinyl DIARY with a blue heart shaped padlock held by

a hand.  A page is turned and the name ALAN SILVER comes

clear.

RACK FOCUS TO

an old Catholic High School yearbook on the dresser below the

diary and a PICTURE of DARYL ADAMS, 18 years old.

On SOPHIA FINELLI, 55, a profound sadness sits at her core.

John nods.  A beat.

John pulls a clear plastic BAG from his pocket with a patch

of the partially disintegrated clothing found on Mary

Finellis skeleton.

Mrs. Finelli gasps in recognition, her eyes turning to a

closet door.

John opens the door to reveal MARY's CLOTHES, lined up in

perfect order.  Visible among them is a "Candy Striper"

uniform... a perfect match with the patch John holds.

Silence.  Tears start to run down her cheeks.  John

understands this woman's pain.  He looks around the room at

Mary's possessions.  Faded pictures.  Mary and her family.

Mary and her friends.

John does know.

Silence again.  John nods.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - MEN'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

John and Satch stand at the urinals.

John waits for Satch to finish.   Then, as they head out into

the hallway...

INT. DETECTIVE SQUAD - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The first guy passed away ten years ago.  The second one died

in Vietnam.

The room has a HOLDING PEN opposite the door.  A table is

pushed up against the door wall and a more elaborate layout

of the murder victims, paperwork, and calendar/timeline

graphs sit on the table and are pinned on a cork board.  Mary

Finelli's uniform is there.

John shows Satch a photo in Mary Finelli's year book.

Satch looks, nods, and steps back.  Waits for more.  John

hands him Daryl Adams' rap sheet.

EXT. NEW YORK ST. - PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - EVENING - 1969

SISSY CLARK steps off a BUS.  She crosses the street towards

the club.  The bus moves out and WIPES FRAME, revealing Frank

sitting at the intersection on his Harley.

Sissy enters the club.  Frank guns the Harley into an alley.

INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - EVENING - MOMENTS LATER

Business is light at this hour.  The BARTENDER is setting up.

The Flying Nun plays on a couple TV's over the bar - the

audio drowned out by loud Motown music.

Frank enters and looks around.  No Sissy.  This time he does

not panic.  He sits at the bar.

INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - DUSK - 1998

CLOSE ON

the 47-year old face of Daryl Adams.  A notably unimposing

guy.  He is not a happy camper.

He is one of two PLUMBERS installing fixtures in the kitchen

of a new place.  Several other people are at work getting the

kitchen ready.  So as not to be overheard...

INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - EVENING - 1969

HAWAII FIVE-O plays on the TV's, the ROLLING STONES over it.

Frank sits at the same place we last saw him, watching Sissy

and scanning the crowd, trying to find a face that might give

him pause.

Sissy, looking sixty and terrific in her Go-Go waitress

outfit, moves about doing business.  She steps to the

bartender t0 give her drink orders and pick up prepared

drinks, coming within inches of Frank.

She casts a friendly eye at Frank.

And she's off with the drinks.  He checks his watch.  It

reads: 9:35PM.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

A clock on the wall reads: 9:35PM

The Nightingale murders display has been removed.  Daryl sits

at the table in the middle of the room.  John sits opposite

him.  Satch leans against the two-way mirror wall.

Satch can see this is going nowhere.

INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - EVENING - 1969

The 11 O'clock NEWS is on TV.  A "Super" shows the Mets won

Game 4.  Score 2-1.  Mets lead series: 3-1.

CREEDENCE CLEARWATER PLAYS out of the sound system.

Sissy takes the order from a LONG HAIRED GUY  down the bar,

his back to the camera, and starts towards the cash register

area.  The bartender serves Frank another club soda.  As

Frank drinks the bartender pulls a PACK OF CIGARETTES from

his shirt pocket.  But the pack is empty.

The bartender laughs, as Frank stands and heads for the

bathroom.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

A CLOCK reflected in the two-way mirror.  12:15PM.

Satch stands drinking a cup of coffee behind the mirror.

Before him, through the glass, sits Daryl Adams, with John

pacing like a panther ready to spring.

Suddenly, he slaps down crime scene homicide photos of

several women in front of Daryl, who blanches...

John looks like he's about to hit Daryl, but he glances

towards the two-way mirror, controls himself.

INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - EVENING - 1969

Nilsson's EVERYBODY'S TALKIN' fills the air.

A sexy WOMAN approaches Frank wearing an Emma Peel body suit.

Sissy stands nearby, giving drink orders to the bartender -

she can't help but smile at the following.

The bartender leans into the PA at the bar and announces.

Frank flashes his wedding ring at the sexy woman.  Smiles at

her and shrugs "I'm sorry."

INT. 23RD PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

The clock reads 1:30AM.

John sits at the end of the table, opposite Daryl.  His quiet

masks the dark menace he is barely in control of.  Daryl

stares at him like a deer caught in the headlights.

Satch sets a Coke before Daryl and starts to leave the room.

Daryl shakes his head "no."

INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - EVENING - 1969

End of the night.  The place winds down.  An old movie on the

TV's.  Elvis' SUSPICIOUS MINDS plays softly.

Frank watches as Sissy picks up her last tip and heads to the

back to change into her street clothes.

Frank smiles, checks the time.  2:00AM.  He looks around.

Nobody suspicious about.  He starts up for the bathroom...

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

Satch enters with a fresh cup of coffee, settles back to

watch.

INTERCUT - INTERROGATION AND OBSERVATION ROOMS

With great ceremony John removes his watch, his gun, and

lastly, his badge, and sets them off to one side.

And John starts up from his seat and walks toward Daryl.

SUDDENLY, in the door strides...

John freezes.  Looks towards Satch.

Satch opens the door and steps out.  John collects his watch,

badge and gun and follows.

INT. SQUAD HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Long beat.

John pauses for several seconds, then nods slowly.

INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - MEN'S ROOM - EVENING - 1969

SUSPICIOUS MINDS filters in.  Frank zips up, heads to the

sink.  Bends over to wash his hands, and suddenly.

His face is smashed on the edge of the sink.  He twists to

the floor, fighting to maintain consciousness.

A black Frye boot explodes into Frank's gut.  He rolls over,

looks up at the LONG HAIRED GUY from the bar.  Frank seems to

recognize him.  We know him too - SCRAGGLY MAN.  But we don't

know his name yet.  So we'll call him...

CLOSE ON

Killer's eyes, evil fuckin' black dots.  He lifts Frank to

his knees.  Then rips a fist into Frank's face.

Frank is clearly incapacitated.  Killer lifts him to his feet

so they are eye-to-eye.

A look of absolute shock wipes across the Killer's face.

Caught off guard, Frank is able to slam his knee into

Killer's balls.  Killer goes down like a stone, but Frank is

too battered to take advantage.

He collapses on top of Killer, who pushes him off, scrambles

up, and delivers a massive kick to his head.  Frank is out

cold.

Quickly, Killer rolls Frank over and rifles his pockets

finding his WALLET.  He grabs something from it, then tosses

it aside.  He then takes something out of his pocket, a thin

leather garrote.  He coils it around his hands and snaps it

taut.  He bends down to start the job when suddenly, the

bathroom door opens and...

TWO very stoned MEN stumble in.

And Killer muscles Frank into a toilet stall and puts his

head in the bowl.  He closes the door, quickly leaving.

In the stall, Frank spills onto the floor, his legs sticking

out into the bathroom.  His face flush to the tile, his eyes

trying to focus on something lying just outside the stall...

His WALLET.

EXT. 23RD PRECINCT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - 1998

John gets in his car.  Sits there, staring into the night.

INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - MEN'S ROOM - EVENING - 1969

Frank starts to come around.  He reaches out and grabs his

wallet off the floor.  His money still there.  Credit cards,

too.  But something's missing.  His DRIVER'S LICENSE.

SUDDENLY PANIC SEIZES FRANK.

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE STAIRWELL - LATER

Frank tears up the stairs...

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE CORRIDOR - SISSY'S DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Frank bangs on it.  Scared.  Desperate.

Frank keeps banging on the door.  A NEIGHBOR'S DOOR swings

open a crack.  AN OLD LADY peers out from behind a security

chain.  Frank stops banging.

Old Lady skeptically looking him up & down - noticing Frank's

bruised face.  She quickly closes the door.

Frank reaches inside his jacket pocket, pulls out a small

bent metal wire, homemade LOCKPICK.  He goes to work on

Sissy's lock.  CLICK, CLICK, CLICK - got it.  He opens the

door, steps inside.

INT. SISSY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

It's dark.  And then a sound...scratching and popping, the

sound of a PHONOGRAPH NEEDLE makes when it reaches the end of

the vinyl and is scratching against the label.

The wind catching a curtain allows the shaft of a street

light to beam brightly into the room, and in one swift

moment, Frank is staring at a NIGHTMARE: Sissy Clark's

murdered body.  Her dress hiked above her waist.  Her panties

ripped off.  Paper stuffed into her mouth. Her hands bound

with glass tape.  Frank is transfixed and sickened by Sissy's

twisted face, her eyes frozen open in horrible death.

EXT. SISSY'S APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Frank staggers out of the building towards his Harley.  He

bends over and blows his dinner, then mounts the bike and

kicks the motor over.  As he roars off down the street, WE

SEE in the building window...

THE OLD LADY looking down at him.

The LEGEND reads:

OCTOBER 16th - FIFTH GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - MORNING - 1969 & 1998

INTERCUT FRANK AND JOHN.

ANGLE ON

Frank.  Trembling, overcome by an awful combination of fear,

guilt and shame.

Frank starts to light up a Lucky.  But he stops, stubbing the

cigarette out.

Frank does as John asks.  Taking out his wallet.

Frank fishes around the desk drawer for some electrical

tape...quickly ripping off strips of tape...covering the

wallet.  Then he goes to the window.  Crouches on the floor,

digging his nails around edges of the loose floorboard.

BACK TO JOHN

getting up.

John scrambles to window.  Crouches down on floor, reaching

to find: FRANK'S WALLET COVERED IN ELECTRICAL TAPE!

John goes back to the radio.

And John is up, grabs gun & shield.  Sprints for the door.

INT. POLICE FORENSICS LAB - DAY - 1998

CLOSE ON SPLIT COMPUTER SCREEN:

LEFT SCREEN: A FROZEN IMAGE - A BLOWN UP THUMB PRINT.

RIGHT SCREEN: HUNDREDS OF FINGERPRINTS FLASH ON AND OFF - THE

COMPUTER IS SEARCHING FOR A MATCH.

BINGO.  The right screen freezes.  A THUMB PRINT... A MATCH!

Pull back to reveal John, standing over a forensic computer

technician, HECTOR.  Hector hits a few more keys, a

photograph pops on the screen - it is NOT DARYL ADAMS!

Hector hits another key, the man's name and photo pops up...

CARL SHEPARD

HE'S 30 YEARS OLDER than when he tangled with Frank in the

men's room last night, but this is the killer- Carl Shepard.

Below Shepard's photo, various biographical information:

social security, address, current employment, and a New York

City Police Department Discharge - September 1973.

ON JOHN

A strange look of recognition.

EXT. SHEPARD RESIDENCE - LATER

John exits his car to find Fred Shepard watering his plants.

INT. SHEPARD RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

They enter the living room.  No Mrs. Shepard.  John's eyes

fix on the police academy graduation PHOTO of CARL SHEPARD.

His gaze then shifts to photos of Mrs. Shepard.

John's breath catches.  His look shifts back to the photo of

Carl Shepard.

Mr. Shepard reaches to open an album.  There are several

photographs of the young Mrs. Shepard.  A couple where she is

dressed in a NURSE'S UNIFORM.

John is stunned.  One can only imagine what is now racing

through his mind.

Blown away, John looks out the window to where Mary Finelli's

skeleton was found.

John can only stay inside himself and wonder at the madness

of the world.

INT. BROOKLYN WATERFRONT RESTAURANT - LATER

John walks past the lunchtime crowd, makes his way to the

BAR.  Grabs a stool two...seats away from...Carl Shepard.

John orders a soda, glances over at Shepard.  Their eyes

meet.  John holds his gaze.  A slight nod...

John gets up, slides next to Shepard.

Beat.

John waits again for Shepard's reaction...

Shepard says nothing, but his eyes are burning into John.

John slips something on the bar, next to Shepard.  It is a

crime scene photo of Shepard's murdered mother.  He reels

back, totally losing his veil of composure.  He is freaked.

And with that, John gets up, leaving Shepard stunned.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - DAY - 1969 & 1998

Johnny and Gordo sit cross-legged in front of the TV.  THE

WORLD SERIES is on.  Game 5.  First inning.

Julia is busy bringing in groceries from her car.

INTERCUT FRANK AND JOHN.

In the B.G. of Frank's house a DOORBELL RINGS.  Julia can be

seen going to answer it.  It is Satch.  There are ad lib

greetings that we don't clearly hear.

Satch steps into the study...1969.

Frank's hand lifts off the squawk bar.  He notes Satch's tone

and demeanor.

Frank suddenly spots something through the front window.

Satch's partner, PHIL HAYES, and TWO UNIFORMS out at the

curb.

Half a penny drops.  All his senses go on alert.  And

instinct kicks...he hits the squawk bar.

Frank releases the squawk bar.

Johnny and Gordo remain fixed on the game, oblivious to

anything else.  In the kitchen, we can see Julia moving

around putting away the groceries.

Julia now becomes aware of the tension in the voices in the

other room.  She looks outside and sees Phil and the

uniforms.  She looks at Frank and Satch with confusion.

Frank hits the squawk bar again.  He wants John to hear this.

A long beat.  Frank sees Julia staring at them.  She is now a

bundle of growing anxiety.  Frank stands up.

And then he and Satch walk out the front door.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

...and towards a spot halfway between the house and the cops.

From inside the house, Johnny and Gordo have begun to take in

the activity.

The rest of the penny drops.  Frank stalls, trying to think

And he hands FRANK his missing DRIVER'S LICENSE.  Frank looks

like a truck hit him.

Frank nods.  Takes stock of the cops by the cars and heads

back into the house.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Julia, who has been watching through a front room window with

Johnny, moves to meet Frank.  Behind Frank, Satch signals

Phil and the uniforms that all is okay, giving Frank a couple

of steps on him.

Frank steps into the house and wraps his arms around Julia,

turning so he can see both Satch outside and where he wants

to go inside.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Frank moves Julia toward teh desk, lulling Satch a moment,

then quickly steps to the HAM radio and hits the squawk bar.

Julia stares dumbfounded at Frank.

Satch strides by Julia and reaches to take Frank's elbow.

Frank wheels at the sound of his name and the touch, and he

lurches back from Satch.

-- and the movement yanks the mic cord to the radio tight,

dragging it to the edge of the desk.

Johnny tears into the room and clutches onto his mother.

"Daddy, Daddy!"

And Frank throws his hands up in front of his chest in an "I

give up" gesture.

And the HAM radio CRASHES to the floor in 1969.

1998.  The HAM RADIO TRANSFORMING...a large dent appearing in

its casing before John's eyes...dials cracking.

Dread creeps into John's face as we SMASH CUT TO:

JOHN'S POV

We see what John sees in 1998.  But we also go inside his

mind and glimpse flashes of new childhood memories.  Memories

of seeing his father arrested for murder.  Images that match

JOHNNY'S POV from moments ago in 1969.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY - 1969

Frank sits at a metal table bolted to the floor, Satch sits

across.  Phil stands.  Two cups of coffee on the table.  The

room is very bare.  Cinder block walls.

Padded locks and bars over the windows.  A small metal

cabinet against the far wall.  Satch and Phil smoke.  Frank

does not.

Satch stares at Frank with utter incredulity.  Phil lights a

smoke, tossing the pack and the matchbook on the table.

Satch looks over at Phil.

Phil nods his understanding, steps out of the room.

It's quiet for a moment.  And then a sound filters in under

the door.  The sound of cops cheering.  It's the World

Series.

Frank sits up - takes a beat.

We hear the bolt slide, the knob turns and the door opens.

Satch nods okay to Phil.  He closes the door.

Frank struggles for an answer...but comes up speechless.

Satch looks like his heart is breaking.  Unable to comprehend

how Frank could have slipped this far.  A long beat, then...

Satch snorts, incredulous.  Frank reaches over the table and

takes his hand, deadly serious.

Satch nods okay.  They have an understanding.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SGT'S DESK - MOMENTS LATER

Satch walks down the stairs.  Julia alone on the bench.

She sees Satch approaching, stands up, looking at him for an

answer, for an explanation...for hope.

Julia nods okay.  They exit the precinct house and into...

EXT. 17TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS

...the street.  Around the corner we catch sight of someone

familiar - someone Julia and Satch don't recognize: Shepard.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SGT'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

Shepard approaches the desk, flashes his shield at Sergeant.

Shepard turns, gliding through the lobby like a shark...

INT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

Satch and Julia sit at a booth in the back.  Satch stirs his

coffee, trying to start a very hard conversation.  As he

struggles to begin, the camera notices something in the B.G.

At the counter: a few stray people gathered around watching

the WORLD SERIES on an old TV.

AUDIO COMES UP.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Shepard passes the COFFEE ROOM.  It is packed with

detectives, gathered around a TV...watching the game.  Phil

Hayes is among them.  And as Shepard passes, Phil half

catches a glimpse of him as he glides down the hall and

enters.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank looks up to see Shepard, who quickly closes the door

behind him... and unholsters his gun.  An eerie moment.

Frank waits a beat.  Then very slowly, he stands.

Frank steps back, slowly turning.  Shepard holsters the gun.

Kicks Frank up against the wall as he reaches into his pocket

and takes out the leather garrote we saw in the Peppermint

Lounge Bathroom.  He coils it around his hands.

Frank is trembling.

But Frank turns.

Shepard smiles, unfazed...

Shepard gives Frank a look that would make a Marine Drill

Sergeant shit his pants.  Shepard knows Frank's weakness, the

one thing that would make him submit to death.

Closing his eyes, Frank turns to face the wall...But the door

handle rattles, someone is outside coming in.  Shepard

quickly yanks Frank away from the wall, shoving him in a

chair at the interrogation table.

The door opens.

Shepard just laughs.  Phil scans the room - everything looks

normal, a cop questioning a perp.

Phil shrugs okay.

Shepard and Phil step out - bolting the door behind them.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Shepard and Phil stand outside the door.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank's expression begins to harden.  His eyes search teh

room.  CLOSE ON his EYES.  He looks like John - controlled

rage piercing through that Sullivan thousand yard stare.

He stands, turning around, looking for something, anything

that he can use to get the hell out of there.

His mind's racing, fire fighter training kicking in.  And

then he looks up - just below the ceiling, above the door - a

2'X2' ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR BOX.

Follow Frank's eyes to something else.  An AIR CONDITIONER

MOUNTED IN THE WINDOW.

Frank goes to the window.  Runs his fingers along the air

conditioner's thick electrical cord - thinking.  He unplugs

it.  And then he RIPS cord out of the unit, exposing wire.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

A loud cheer rises out of the coffee room - the game is

heating up.  Shepard and Phil are still standing outside the

interrogation room.  Shepard flashes a smile, having said

something that makes Phil laugh...

INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Julia's crying.  Satch has no words to comfort her, now way

of explaining any of this.  He reaches out across the

table...taking her hand.  And as they sit quietly.

CAMERA tracks towards the counter.  And we hear something

that Satch does not.  The sound of a voice.  TV ANNOUNCER.

THE SERIES...

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank uses the heel of his shoe to rip the plug off the other

end of the electrical cord.  Both ends now have exposed

wires.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - COFFEE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Close on a MATCH.  Pull back to reveal Shepard lighting

Phil's cigarette, then one for himself.  They are inside the

squad's coffee room now.  All eyes on the TV:

Shepard inhales deeply, sneaking a glance down hall at the

closed interrogation room door.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Satch looks past Julia, distracted, curious.

Julia seems bewildered as Satch gets up out of the booth,

making his way through the restaurant and towards the TV.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank, in full throttle, drags a chair against the wall.

Climbs on the chair, uses a dime to unscrew the ELECTRICAL

CONDUCTOR BOX.

He then unscrews the master fuse and SHOVES ONE END OF THE

ELECTRICAL CORD'S EXPOSED WIRE AROUND THE FUSE CYLINDER.

After re-tightening the fuse, and careful not to touch the

other end of the cord, he jumps off the chair.

FOOTSTEPS.  Frank freezes.  Someone's walking down the hall.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Wall to wall cops.  Mesmerized by the game, especially Phil.

The cops erupt.  Cheering.

Shepard gives Phil one last smile, then slips out - casually

heading down the hall...towards the interrogation room.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank, sweating bullets now, takes the two coffee cups off

the table and pours their contents ON THE FLOOR.  The coffee

forms a SMALL PUDDLE which Frank is careful not to let slip

over the door saddle.

He puts the cups down.  Then opens the cabinet, rifling

through, finding a can of LYSOL spray.

Sounds of cops cheering filter in under the door.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Satch is riveted to the TV as Clendenon steps up to the

plate.  Strike on.

Satch jumps - Julia has come up behind him, touching him on

the shoulder.  She looks mad: how the hell can he be watching

the ball game at a time like this?

Beat.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

All eyes on the TV.  Another strike to Clendenon.  0-2 count.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The door knob turns.  The door half-opens.  Shepard sticks

his head in, scanning the room.  He relaxes a bit when he

sees Frank sitting quietly at the table.

Shepard opens the door a little further, takes a half step

into the room...and into the puddle of coffee!

Frank raises his arm.  He's holding the live electrical cord.

Shepard: What the fuck?  Frank flicks the cord...which lands

like a snake at Shepard's feet...in the puddle of coffee.

5,000 volts surge through Shepard's body.

SPARKS AND SMOKE SHOOT OUT OF CONDUCTOR BOX...

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON TV.  Clendenon still up.  1-2 count.  The wind up...

But something is wrong with the TV.  A spark shoots out of

the back of the set.

And then the entire 17th Precinct goes DARK.  Frank has

shorted out the electrical system.

The cops look at each other in a moment of pissed confusion.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Frank lunges over the table, smashing a wooden chair over

Shepard's head.  He's in overdrive.  Kicking the still live

cord out of the coffee puddle, he then drags Shepard's body

into the room, shutting the door.

Frank quickly rips off Shepard's SPORTS JACKET, pocketing

Shepard's WALLET and BADGE.

And then, moving very fast, Frank grabs the LYSOL can and the

matches Phil left on the table.  He LIGHTS A MATCH and holds

it IN FRONT OF THE LYSOL CAN.  He points the can at the

ceiling - at the FIRE ALARM SENSORS.  Hits SPRAY button -

Professional Fire Fighter ingenuity - HOMEADE BLOW TORCH.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

FIRE ALARMS sound off.  SPRINKLER SYSTEM kicks in, water

gushing from the ceiling.  Cops begin to move, investigating.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank cracks open the door and slips out.  As the door

closes, Shepard's eyes pop open.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Sprinklers rain down on Frank as he moves down the hall.

Through the darkness he can see someone coming. It's Phil.

Frank covers his face...searching for a place to disappear.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Nobody breathes.  All eyes on the TV.

The count is now 2-2.  The pitch is a high fastball.

Clendenon takes a massive swing.  He nails it.  HOME RUN!

The coffee shop breaks into cheers.  Everyone screaming their

heads off.  Everyone except Satch, who just stands there, in

complete and utter shock.  Julia looking at him

questioningly.

And they hug.  The weight of the world sliding off Julia's

shoulders.  But someone is trying to get Satch's attention.

It is the counter man, he's holding a phone.

Satch takes the phone, beat, his face goes ashen.

He drops the phone, heading for the door.

And Satch is gone.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Power is still off.  Sprinklers still gushing.  Amidst the

chaos, a bathroom door swings open.  A man steps out.  A cop.

Leather jacket, gold shield.  It's Frank.  He slips through

the madness, heading down the hall and towards the stairs.

EXT. 17TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS

Satch races down the crowded block...dodging celebrating

Mets' fans...bolting up the precinct steps into the house.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Phil runs in.  Scanning the room.  But it is empty.  No

Frank.  No Shepard.  Just a puddle of coffee on the floor.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SGT'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

Satch charges into the lobby.  The lights start to flicker

back on.  Chaos giving way to order.

Satch heads for the stairs.

And there is Frank, wearing Shepard's jacket and shield.  But

in his hurry, Satch has not spotted him.

Frank quickly steps behind a pillar as Satch tears by him and

up the stairs.

Stay with Frank as he turns...calmly walking by the

Sergeant's desk, gliding out the precinct door and...

EXT. 17TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS

...disappearing into the street.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY - 1998

John stalks down an apartment building hallway, gun drawn. He

reaches a door.  Two locks and a bell.  Fuck 'em.  John

smashes his bulk into the door...one...two...three times.  It

bursts off its hinges.  John charges in.

Place is empty.  Like somebody got the hell out in a hurry.

A few odds and ends left behind in the haste...including a

pile of unpaid bills.  CARL SHEPARD.

John's eyes glaze over in rage and fury.  But then he sees

something that makes him stop and think.  There is a

telephone on the floor, in a corner.  John stares at the

phone, wheels spinning.  He reaches in his coat and takes out

his notebook.  Flipping through pages.  Notes on Shepard:

social security, address, DMV registration, and a series of

phone numbers...home, office, cellular.

John runs to the phone.  Punches in the cell number.  Ring.

INTERCUT SHEPARD AND JOHN

Shepard is in his car, over a bridge, on the run...

INT. SHEPARD'S APARTMENT - WEST 74TH ST. - DAY - 1969

CLICK, CLICK -- dead bolt turning...

Front door opens and SHEPARD WALKS IN.  His '69 apartment is

far nicer than the place we just left John in '98.

Shepard runs to the bathroom.  Rips off the toilet's tank

lid, reaches down and pulls out a .357 Magnum Colt Python,

wrapped in clear plastic.

He rips off the plastic, shoves the pistol in his waistband,

heads into the kitchen.

He gropes behind the refrigerator, close on an envelope glass

taped to back of the fridge.  Shepard's hand finds the

envelope...he rips it loose.  And then he opens it -

revealing its contents, souvenirs, POLAROID PHOTOS OF THE

NIGHTINGALE MURDERS, WOMEN'S JEWELRY, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS...

Shepard takes out a match to burn the photos.  But then...

The broom closet door bursts off its hinges.  Frank instantly

on top of Shepard.  The souvenirs go flying in the air.

Frank pummels Shepard's head and back. But Shepard smashes

his elbow in Frank's Adam's apple, lands a solid uppercut

square on Frank's nose.  Frank's eyes watering up, VISION

BLURRING.

CLOSE ON

Frank's hand, groping for the handle of a glass pitcher atop

the kitchen counter.

Shepard reaches for his gun, points the .357 at Frank's head.

Shepard's finger squeezing the trigger. It's over.  But...

FRANK SMASHES THE GLASS PITCHER down on Shepard's skull.

Shepard drops.  CRACK, the gun fires, BLASTING AIR.

FRANK scrambles for the window.  He's outta there, expertly

thundering down fire escape.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND SHEPARD'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Frank hits the pavement, twisting his ankle.  Hears metal

rattling, looks up.  Shepard's clattering down after him.

Shepard tries to get off a shot through the fire escape grid.

BANG!  The shot ricochets wildly.  Frank takes off, limping

and staying close to the building out of the line of fire.

The streets are still empty, the city glued to their TV's.

Frank hits CPW.  He glances left, right, straight ahead.

Central Park.

Frank runs into the park.

INT. SHEPARD'S APARTMENT - W. 74TH ST. - DUSK

The door is kicked open.  Satch and Phil enter, guns drawn.

They take in the damage from the fight.  Following the trail

of blood back to the kitchen. And there, strewn across the

floor are Shepard's photos of his victims, the newspaper

clippings, the jewelry, and the envelope with the glass tape

still on it.

Satch knows.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS

Frank hears pounding footsteps - Shepard is catching up.

Frank's adrenaline kicking in, sprints around a bend in the

path, reaches long wooden bridge spanning Central Park Lake.

The bridge is being restored.  Barricades across the

entrance.

Frank hurdles over the barricades, runs onto the bridge.

Shepard trips in the dirt.  Gets back up, reaches the bridge,

knocks over a barricade, runs to the middle of the bridge.

FRANK'S DISAPPEARED.  Shepard stops, listens - nothing.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - UNDERNEATH - CONTINUOUS

Frank dangles below the bridge, holding onto the steel girder

of substructure - 8 ft. above water.  Not moving a muscle,

not making a sound, barely even breathing.

CLOSE ON SEWER RAT

Crawling on Frank's arm.  Caught off guard, Frank flinches,

sending the rat tumbling.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - TOP OF BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Bridge side railings have been removed for construction.

Shepard hears something hit the water.  Rushes to the side of

the bridge, points his gun at the water.  BANG!

Shepard leans out further aiming the gun at the water.

Shepard's outstretched arm only a few feet from Frank's head.

Frank silently swings his body forward reaching out...

Snags Shepard's arm, pulling him hard, over the side.

SHEPARD FALLS, grabs for something, anything.  Wraps his arms

around Frank's leg, hangs on tight.

Frank struggles, kicks wildly, trying to shake Shepard off.

Shepard hangs on with his left arm.  Pulls out the gun with

his right.  He aims it at Frank's head.  Cocks back the

hammer.

FRANK LETS GO.  KERPLUNK.  They plunge into:

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LAKE - CONTINUOUS

Murky water, thick with dirt and slime, 5' deep.

Frank's hanging on to Shepard's arm, trying to wrestle the

gun free.  But Shepard's using his free hand to gouge Frank's

eyes.  Frank bites down hard on Shepard's wrist.

The gun sinks silently to the muddy lake bottom.

But Shepard gets both hands on Frank's throat.  Shoving his

head into the shallow water.  Shepard's grip is like a vise,

Frank futilely tries to pry Shepard's fingers open.

Frank is blinded by polluted water.  Starting to lose

consciousness.  Desperately, he searches the muddy lake

bottom for the gun.  But he's getting weaker, fading out...

Then he feels something.  A BRICK, fallen off the bridge,

half buried in the mud.  Frank struggles to dig it up.

Summons his last ounces of strength, yanking it back and

forth, it's getting loose.

But Shepard's hands are squeezing tighter.  Frank finally

goes limp.  A few last bubbles float to the surface.  Shepard

smiles.  Catching his breath, slightly loosens grip on

Frank's lifeless neck.

Frank springs off the lake bottom, rises out of the water

like a jack-in-the-box.  Holding the brick with both hands,

he swings.  CONTACT.

The brick smashes against Shepard's head.  Knocking him to

yesterday.  He drops like a rock.

Frank waits for Shepard to come up for air.  Nothing.

Frank crawls out of the water, collapsing onto the

embankment.  He just lies there, heart pounding, chest

heaving.

And suddenly, Frank is startled by a MASSIVE ROAR - the sound

of eight million New Yorkers screaming in unison.  The Mets

have just won the World Series.

Frank laughs, slowly getting to his feet.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST & 65TH - PAY PHONE - DUSK

Frank's dripping blood and filthy lake water.  The streets

have instantly erupted with celebrating Mets' fans.  A giant

party.  Cars whiz by, honking their horns, passengers leaning

out, pumping fists in victory.  Frank has to yell above the

racket.

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - SQUAD ROOM

The Nightingale evidence from Shepard's kitchen floor is

spread all over the squad room.

INTERCUT FRANK.

Frank clicks down the receiver, slides in a dime, dials

another number.  A beat, then...

Frank smiles, and we dissolve to

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LAKE - NIGHT

The area cordoned off.  Detectives and uniforms.  EMS wagon.

An inflatable boat is being placed in the lake.  Two police

frog men are climbing into their gear.

Pan over the scene to find Frank and Satch.  Frank's got a

blanket wrapped around him.  They talk quietly as Satch walks

Frank to a waiting green and white squad car.

Satch sticks out his hand...Frank takes it.  They hold each

other's grip for some moments.  Frank starts to say "thank

you", but Satch silently cuts him off.

Frank climbs in the car.  Satch closes the door, taps on the

roof, Frank is on his way home.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - JOHNNY'S ROOM - LATER

JOHNNY is asleep in bed.  Elvis sleeps at the foot of it.  In

the shadows next to them, Julia sits very still in a rocking

chair, half-asleep, half-awake.  Staring out the window.  Her

eyes are bloodshot.  She has been through hell.

A faint STAIRWAY CREAK.  Elvis stirs.  He looks up to SEE:

FRANK standing in the doorway.  He looks a wreck.

And she is out of the chair.  They meet in a hug.  Over her

shoulder Frank takes a long look at his sleeping son.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - LATER

Relatively cleaned up, but very bruised, Frank is at the

desk, trying to repair the DISASSMBLED RADIO.  Julia comes in

and sets down a cup of coffee.  She kisses him on the top of

his head, casts a wondering eye on the radio, and leaves.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - NIGHT - 1998

John pulls into the driveway and stops.  He stares out the

window, exhausted.  And then something catches his attention.

A SOUND.  Coming from inside the house.  The HAM RADIO?

He bolts from the car, runs to the door, scrambles to get the

backdoor key into the lock, as --

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

John barrels into the kitchen, leaving door ajar, and runs...

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS - 1969 & 1998

John hits the squawk bar on the HAM which...

INTERCUT FRANK AND JOHN.

A short pause, John looks confused.  He sits down.

WHACK!  CLOSE ON FRANK, the back of his skull smashed by the

butt of a .45 wielded by CARL SHEPARD.

FRANK hits the floor with a thud, Shepard looming over him,

reaching for a set of handcuffs.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1998

WHACK!  The butt of a .45 smashes the back of JOHN's skull.

He tumbles to the floor...fighting to stay conscious.

CARL SHEPARD stands over him, the gun pointing at his head.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1969

Shepard stands over Frank.  Frank tires to struggle up.

Shepard forces him back down, tromping a boot into his chest.

And he snaps a handcuff on one of Frank's wrists then

wrenches him to a steel radiator in the family room where he

circles the pipe to the floor with the handcuff chain and

attaches the other cuff to Frank's other wrist.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1998

John is woozy.  He reaches down to his holster - it is empty!

Shepard has got John's 9mm in his left hand.  Holding the .45

to John's head, Shepard pops the clip out of the 9mm and

tosses it aside.  He then snaps a handcuff around John's

wrist, begins dragging him to the radiator.

John's FOOT ERUPTS up into Shepard's groin.  The .45 goes

flying across the room.  For a suspended moment, both men are

riveted to the .45 spinning on the floor.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Frank, struggling to breathe, is slumped by the radiator

staring up at Shepard's groin.  The .45 goes flying across

the room.  For a suspended moment, both men are riveted to

the .45 spinning on the floor.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Frank, struggling to breathe, is slumped by the radiator

staring up at Shepard, who is staring back with pure menace.

The SOUND OF A SHOWER can be heard upstairs.  Shepard looks

up.  Smiles.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Julia luxuriates in a steaming shower.  Singing, softly.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

A BRUTAL STRUGGLE FOR THE GUN between John and Shepard.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Frank desperately tugs at the handcuffs.  Steel bites down on

his wrists.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Julia smiles as she sees a figure through the curtain.

And the shower curtain flies open to reveal SHEPARD.

Julia lets out a bloodcurling scream and plasters herself

against the shower wall.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank reacts to the scream and tears with everything he has

in him to rip away from the radiator.  No way.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - JOHNNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Johnny stirs awake at the sound of the scream...

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

John and Shepard are in a desperate TUG OF WAR over the gun.

They KICK viciously at each other.  Butting heads.  But John

is still woozy from the head wound and Shepard is still very

strong.  BANG!  The gun goes off.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Julia is paralyzed against the wall.  Staring into the dead

as-marble eyes of Shepard.  He looks her up and down.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank's wrists are bleeding.  He can't get out.  But then he

sees something.  Something he can use.  His WATCH.  Frank

struggles to unfasten the watch strap.  He does it.  He

pinches the metal clasp with his thumb and forefinger and

guides it to the keyhole in the left handcuff.  He works it.

Nothing.  Then CLICK.  He's out!

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

John Shepard fight furiously.  But John has managed to get

control of the .45's TRIGGER.  He squeezes it.  BANG.

ANOTHER ONE.  BANG!  BANG!

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Shepard's hands are moving towards Julia's breasts.  SUDDENLY

she lashes out, DIGGING HER NAILS DEEP INTO SHEPARD'S

FACE...TEARING FLESH, DRAWING BLOOD.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

CLOSE ON SHEPARD, struggling with John.  A LARGE SCAR ETCHES

ONTO HIS FACE, in the exact spot where Julia dug her nails in

29-years ago.  BANG!!  BANG!!

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Shepard grabs Julia by the throat.  Slams her against the

wall, knocking her unconscious onto the shower floor.  He

touches the GASH on his face, stares at the blood.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

BANG!  BANG!  John keeps squeezing that trigger.

CLICK.  CLICK.  No more bullets.

Shepard lets go of the gun, heave John over and grabs him by

the neck...strangling him.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - 1969

Shepard is on top of Julia in the shower.  He uncoils the

garrote, snaps it taut, and starts around her neck.

And then a SOUND.  Instantly recognizable.  Beyond adequate

description.  But once you've heard it, you don't forget

it...

CHUUT, CHUUT, CHUUT: THE SOUND OF A 12-GUAGE PUMP-ACTION

SHOTGUN RATCHETING AROUND THE CORNER.

Shepard's head spins about.

FRANK STANDS IN THE DOORWAY, SHOTGUN AIMED AT SHEPARD'S FACE.

He is right.  Frank hesitates.  Shepard LUNGES, grabbing the

shotgun barrel.

BOOM!  Frank FIRES.  BUCKSHOT RIPS THROUGH THE AIR.

SHEPARD'S RIGHT HAND EXPLODES...blood spattering everywhere.

Like a wounded animal, Shepard bolts, blowing past Frank.

Frank gently wraps Julia in a towel.  The fading sound of

Shepard thundering down the stairs.  Out the door.

And then softer footsteps.  Coming closer.  Johnny appears in

the doorway.  Safe and sound.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998

SHEPARD RIGHT HAND GOES LIMP AROUND JOHN'S NECK.  HE STARES

IN SHOCK AS HIS HAND BEGINS TO DISFIGURE.

John starts to choke back to life...

And then something happens.  Some kind of SHOCK-WAVE ripples

through the house -- bending light - bizarrely distorting

everything in its path, including Shepard and John.

The shock-wave is over.  But the house is different.

Changed.

Shepard scans the changed room - disoriented, bewildered.

CRASH!  John pounces.  Pounding blows to Shepard's head.

John is on top of Shepard, hands on his neck.  As John

squeezes the life out of him, Shepard struggles to reach down

his leg with his good hand...

There's something down there.  An ankle holster.  Shepard

strains to get his hand on the gun.  He does.

In a flash, Shepard has the gun to John's temple.

CLICK.  Shepard cocks back the hammer.

Keeping the gun pressed against John's temple, Shepard gets

to his feet.

John closes his eyes.  It's over, he knows he's gonna die.

SILENCE.  Then a sound.  A sound we've heard before.  A sound

you never forget.  Music to our ears.

CHUUT, CHUUT, CLICK: THE SOUND OF A 12-GAUGE PUMP-ACTION

SHOTGUN RATCHETING A ROUND IN THE CHAMBER.

Shepard looks up to see: MAN HOLDING SHOTGUN.

B-O-O-O-M: SHOTGUN BLAST:  Buckshot ripping into Shepard.

Impact lifting him off his feet.  He lands dead on the floor.

CLOSE ON JOHN'S FACE

Opening his eyes.  Looking up at the doorway.  Blinking

through shotgun smoke, trying to focus.  Not believing what

he sees.

FRANK SULLIVAN - AGE SIXTY-NINE

John looks up at his father, speechless.

EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - MORNING - SOME YEARS

LATER

We are soaring high above a baseball diamond.  Clear light

air, you can see for miles.  Float down to the field...

The first taste of Spring and Softball.  Picnic baskets.

Flowers.  Kites flying.  Children running.

The bleachers filled with families and loved ones.

Among them sits SAMANTHA.  She's smiling, she's

glowing...she's pregnant.  PULL BACK to reveal SATCH, GORDO,

ELLEN & GORDY JR.  A dalmation puppy scampers at their feet,

barking in recognition as...

Frank Sullivan steps into the batter's box.

CLOSE ON

Pitcher: 22 year-old African-Amerasian, a muscular beanpole.

Embroidered on the back of the his FDNY jersey is his

nickname: PHIRE POWER.

Quick shot of first baseman.  GRAHAM GIBSON - once a nervous

PROBIE, now a seasoned vet.  And one hell of proud father.

Frank sneers at Gib, then glances up at GIB's WIFE in the

bleachers.  She looks familiar, it's the girl Frank saved in

the warehouse 29-years ago.

PHIRE POWER twirls his arm...

Frank takes a big swing...contact...the ball fouls back

behind the plate.  Towards the parking lot.  Where among the

old Chevys and Fords sits a brand new MERCEDES.  The custom

license plate reads: YAHOO.

CRASH!  Frank's foul ball comes down hard.  As the Mercedes'

windshield spiderwebs we hear an off-camera scream...

It is Gordo, jumping up, running across the field.  From the

parking lot his eyes meet Frank's.  An I'M SORRY shrug, and

Frank turns his attention back to the game.

The next pitch is high and outside.

Frank takes a looping swing...driving the ball to the gap in

right center.  Frank jogs to first.  An easy single.

From first, Frank glances over at the third base coach:

JULIA.  Her hair pinned up under a Mets cap, Julia puts two

fingers in her mouth and belts out a loud whistle as...

The next batter steps out of the dugout.  It is John

Sullivan.

CLOSE ON

John as he makes his way to the plate.

Check out his eyes: they're different, he looks like his

father.  They've got that Frank Sullivan sparkle.

John steps into the batter's box, cocks back to wood.

PHIRE POWER uncorks the fastest softball pitch you've ever

seen.  John jumps on it.  Rips a massive shot to deep center,

way over the fence.

The crew in the stands are on their feet, cheering.

Frank rounds third, John catches up.  A double high-five from

Julia and they jog home together.  The game is over.

Frank puts his arm around John.  Heading for the bleachers.

A little boy totters up to them.  Jumping into John's arms.

His name is Frank Jr.

John gives his son a kiss, glances up at Samantha in the

bleachers.   They share a smile.  And as they step off the

field, his little boy reaches up, takes John's hat off his

head and puts it on his own...

CLOSE ON

John's face.  In his eyes, bliss.

CUE Bruce Springsteen's: TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALLGAME.

END CREDITS ROLL OVER:

Archival film footage.  1969 World Series.  Game Five.  The

last pitch.  Mets win.  Shea stadium erupts.  Fans stream

onto the field.  Lifting the players on their heads.

The madness continues for a while, then slowly fade to Fifth

Ave.  Mets' ticker tape parade.  It's a hell of a party.
