FADE IN:

INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:06PM

Union Station, that gorgeous fifty-year-old monument to Art

Deco/California Mission architecture. Still beautiful. Still

grand.

A sign at one of the departure/arrival gates in the main

concourse-says the "San Diegan", number 2 64, is due at 12:00.

Set above the gates, a big clock - six feet in diameter.

THE TIME -

12:06.

We see the big hand slam into "7".

A loudspeaker - you can just about understand this guy.

EXT. UNION STATION PLATFORM - DAY - 12:06PM

The "San Diegan" pulls into the terminal and comes to a slow,

grinding stop.

Doors are opened. Steps set down. Passengers pour out.

INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:07PM

A MAN and A WOMAN stand with a view of the arrival doors.

He's a blue-collar tough guy, dressed for church. She's his

beefy counterpart.

THE GUY (MR. SMITH) checks his watch.

Then he looks up to the big clock.

12:07.

The minute hand slams into the "8".

He resets his watch as DISEMBARKING PASSENGERS pour out of

the gate. PEOPLE run forward with kisses and hugs.

They stand like a couple of rocks, their eyes scanning the

crowd.

They're talking about a couple in their forties.  She

motormouths her way across the terminal and the husband

follows with the suitcases.

WHOOSH! A couple of TEENAGE BOYS on rollerblades zip by.

EXT. UNION STATION - PLATFORM - DAY - 12:08PM

The train.. A PRETTY SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL (LYNN) , who is holding

a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the

steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within

the train:

GENE WATSON, thirtyish, a regular Joe in appearance and

inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases.

He takes a relieved breath when he sees  her.

As he comes down the steps:

LYNN nods back.

INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:08PM

WHOOSH! A SECURITY GUARD approaches the two ROLLERBLADING

TEENS. They circle him, toss off a few taunts and roll away,

laughing.

MR. SMITH and MS. JONES continue trolling the PASSENGERS as

they come through the gate.

They're talking about a COUPLE IN THEIR SIXTIES, warmly

greeting each other.

MR. SMITH laughs at his joke.

MR. SMITH has spotted someone.

He starts walking towards the exit gate.

INT. UNION STATION -ARRIVAL CONCOURSE - DAY - 12:09PM

GENE has emerged with LYNN. They pause there, getting their

bearings. Next to them, a YOUNG COUPLE is kissing. They can't

keep their hands off each other.

LYNN has seen the YOUNG COUPLE. She secretly points to them,

covers her mouth, and does a "tee, hee, hee" number. GENE

laughs.

They start walking across the concourse, towards MR. SMITH

and MS. JONES.

LYNN suddenly gets very sad. She looks at the ground, slows

down. GENE notices. He stops, crouches down to her level.

MR. SMITH and MS. JONES, nearing them, split apart, move

around them, and keep going.

LYNN nods.

LYNN gives her own hand a little peck of a kiss.

LYNN laughs and throws herself on her dad. He holds her to

him, looks to the sky for help.. He finds himself staring at

the big clock.

12:10.

INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:10PM

MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are making a beeline for their target:

the YOUNG KISSING COUPLE.

WHOOSH! The-ROLLERBLADING TEENS almost collide with them.

MS. JONES wants to do something about it, but MR. SMITH pulls

her along. They have a mission to complete. They close in on

the couple.

The couple are murmuring sweet talk between kisses. The words

themselves are unclear until MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are

only a few feet away. French. They are speaking French. MR.

SMITH makes an instant one-eighty turn. MS. JONES follows.

MR. SMITH looks at the partner he's been saddled with.

INT. UNION STATION - PAY PHONE AREA - DAY - 12:10PM

GENE has found a pay phone. He keeps an eye on LYNN who has

wandered a few yards away.

He reacts to the ROLLERBLADING TEENS who swoop past LYNN,

one on each side, too close for a father's comfort.

She does. He keeps an eye on the TEENS, who, having found a

victim, are circling around, passing MR. SMITH and .MS. JONES.

MR. SMITH has noticed GENE.

GENE at the phone.

The TEENS make their pass, flip him the bird, engage in other

objectionable behavior, begin to circle again. MR. SMITH

watches GENE watch the TEENS, then notice a sturdy, sand-

filled ashtray next to him.

He hangs up. Keeping one eye on the circling TEENS.

He picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to

knock over the ashtray, just as the TEENS approach. The

ashtray spills its Load of sand into their path. When they

hit it, their skates stop, they don't. They sprawl, doing

nasty things to knees and wrists.

He stands over them with LYNN.

ANGLE ON MR. SMITH AND MS. JONES. - 12:11PM

He starts forward.

She follows. They intercept GENE. MR. SMITH flashes a badge.

GENE pulls out his wallet, surprised and confused. MR. SMITH

looks at it.

He pulls open his coat, putting his hands on his hips, not-

so coincidentally revealing the butt of a holstered gun.

MS. JONES swoops LYNN up and heads for the station entrance.

GENE hurries after MS. JONES. MR. SMITH grabs up the

suitcases.

INT. UNION STATION - SOUVENIR SHOP - DAY - 12:11PM

MS. JONES nears a souvenir stand. The OWNER is looking the

other way. Without breaking stride, MS. JONES reaches out,

snatches a child's coloring book and crayons.

And they're out the door, GENE hurrying after. The big hand

on the big clock moves.

12:12.

EXT. UNION STATION PARKING LOT - DAY - 12:12PM

MS. JONES heads for-a van with smoked windows. She gets inside

with LYNN. GENE stops a few feet away.

MR. SMITH prods him in the ribs.

GENE looks desperately around for help. There is none. He

lets MR. SMITH push him toward the van.

INT. VAN -.DAY - 12:13PM

LYNN and MS. JONES are in the back.

LYNN resists.

GENE climbs into the front passenger seat.

MR. SMITH climbs into the driver's seat.

GENE looks down. MR.. SMITH has pulled his gun. He points it

casually so it's aiming through the seat in the general

direction of the little girl.

She puts some ear phones on her. She holds up the plug-in

end.

She plugs the jack in. MS. JONES turns on the radio. LYNN

gets a big smile on her face.

She goes to work, playing with the radio, changing stations,

etc., oblivious to all else.

MS JONES presses PRINT on the Labeller. A strip of plastic

emerges that she begins to apply to a Name Tag.  He looks

back to her. MR. SMITH whacks him on the knee with the gun.

It hurts.

He looks back. She is caressing LYNN's hair.

He makes a move. MR. SMITH whacks his knee again, harder.

GENE looks from MR. SMITH to MS. JONES and back. He's having

a hard time focussing.

She slips the NameTag into a manila envelope beside her MR.

SMITH Do you understand?

He takes the manila envelope from MS JONES, tosses it in

GENE'S lap.

He gestures. GENE looks. The glassy Bonaventure Hotel is

glimpsed surrounded by taller, newer high-rises.

MR. SMITH holds up his hand, snaps his fingers. From the

back, MS. JONES hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle. He puts it

in GENE's hand, shows him what it is: a gun.

It takes a moment for it all to sink into GENE'S brain.

A "snap!" from the back seat. GENE looks. MS. JONES has broken

a carrot stick. She breaks another.

She gives half the carrot stick to LYNN, pops the other half

in her mouth and grinds it to pulp. MR. SMITH is checking

his watch.

He looks in the rear-view mirror to MS. JONES.

He taps the manila envelope.

He indicates the back seat with his head.

GENE looks at his daughter.

MR. SMITH reaches over, puts the gun and manila envelope

into GENE'S pockets.

He reaches across GENE, opens the door and pushes him out,

then follows him. LYNN takes off the ear-phones, tries to

undo her seatbelt.

MS. JONES wraps a big arm around her.

EXT. UNION STATION PARKING'LOT - DAY - 12:18PM

MR. SMITH activates the walkie-talkie, speaks into it.

He holds it up for GENE to hear.

MR. SMITH still has GENE'S wallet. He opens it, pulls out

some cash, puts it in GENE's breast pocket.

He grabs one of GENE's hands.

He dumps six bullet's into GENE's palm from a cloth Chivas

Regal bag.

GENE just stands there, transfixed by the bullets in his

hand. MR. SMITH reaches out, turns him around and gives him

a shove away from the van and into the midst of...

EXT. UNION STATION - PARKING LOT - BUS STOP - DAY - 12:19PM

...a LARGE CROWD OF TOURISTS, that have just exited an

arriving mini-bus. GENE is caught up in the crowd and carried

along like a leaf in a stream.

Amid the chattering CROWD, GENE is pushed along as if in a

trance. He touches the pocket with the gun. He looks at the

Bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. It's

like a splash of cold water. He quickly pockets the bullets,

turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. They resist

him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see...

The van is gone!

ANGLE ON GENE -- 12:19PM

He stands there, a lost man. Fear sweeps over him. He looks

desperately around. He is within himself, oblivious to his

surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions.

He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step.

A LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S

legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds

himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart

plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her.

She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up,

reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching

the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder.

Until a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT

POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station.

It's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He

is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more

confident.

Then, just beyond the COP, MR. SMITH casually slides into

view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. GENE walks right

past the COP heading towards a cab stand. MR. SMITH falls in

behind him speaking in his ear.

GENE grabs at the walkie-talkie like a drowning man.

MR. SMITH clicks off the walkie-talkie.

He pushes GENE on, toward a cab.

GENE looks back at him, full of impotent rage. MR. SMITH

raises the walkie-talkie. GENE reaches the first cab at the

stand.

EXT. UNION STATION - CAB STAND - DAY - 12:21PM

The CABBIE, talking to ANOTHER DRIVER, throws away his

cigarette, ambles over to the Driverside-of the cab.

The CABBIE is disappointed, but he nods and GENE gets into

the cab.

INT. CAB - DAY - 12:21PM

The CABBIE gets in and they take off. GENE stares at the

manila envelope in his hand. He starts to open it, is stopped

by:

They lapse into silence. GENE starts to open the envelope

again.

GENE notices the dashboard clock -

12:22

GENE leans forward.

He hits the horn and swerves to the left.

EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY - 12:22PM

GENE looks out his window and finds himself staring at MR.

SMITH, staring back at him, driving the van, next to him. He

throws himself back in the seat.

INT. CAB - DAY - 12:22PM

The cab pulls into the drive front of the Bonaventure Hotel

and stops.

GENE looks out the back window, watches the van pulls up to

the curb on the other side of the street.

GENE looks back at the CABBIE, waiting for his fare.

GENE digs through his pockets and comes up with one of his

business cards. He hurriedly writes on it: "HELP. VAN KIDNAP

CHILD." He wraps a five around it, pushes it into the CABBIE'S

hand, gives him a meaningful look and gets out of the cab.

EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM

GENE stops a few yards from the cab, watching the CABBIE.

INT. CAB - DAY - 12:23PM

The CABBIE finds the secreted card, but looks at the wrong

side.

A DOORMAN leans down at the window.

The DOORMAN plants a PASSENGER in the cab. As he pulls away,

the CABBIE again glances at the business card, crumples it

up.

EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM

GENE watches the cab leave. As it exits, the CABBIE's arm

snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. GENE knows what

it is. He looks around.

VALETS, BELLMEN, ARRIVALS and DEPARTEES, cars coming and

going. No one pays particular attention to him.

GENE looks at the van across the street. MR. SMITH gets out

and walks across the street towards him. The van drives away.

GENE watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately

hanging onto the last glimpse of it.

MR. SMITH takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. GENE

goes into the hotel.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM

GENE enters. It's like another world. A busy, humming, air-

conditioned planet. PEOPLE hustle around the restaurants,

waterfalls - a definite ant farm ambiance.

HIGH DOWN ANGLE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM

Suddenly we have cut to a VIDEO IMAGE of Gene looking around

this Hotel, complete with scrolling TIME AND DATE. Shot by

someone high above.

CLOSE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM

GENE is bumped and buffeted about by the bustling crowd. He

breaks free to a clear spot, looks up and freezes. Then he

starts tracking all around him, seeing...something.

He desperately fumbles in his pocket.

Facing and above him, some WORKMEN ON LADDERS are securing a

huge, rolled up banner.

GENE finds what he's looking for - the manila envelope. He

rips it open. As he pulls out the photograph that is inside,

the WORKMEN let their banner unfurl. We do a simultaneous

reveal. The woman in the photograph in the envelope is the

same as depicted on the banner. Written across the bottom of

it in your best red, white, and blue:

And an addendum:

It dawns on him. He looks around him again. This time we see

what he sees. Campaign posters and banners everywhere.

On some of them she is posed with a handsome man, several

years her junior. These have the caption, "Governor Grant

and husband Brendan".

His eyes fall on MR. SMITH, standing inside the entrance,

walkie-talkie in hand, watching him.

GENE looks at a poster, at MR. SMITH, who smiles, nods and

gives GENE a move of the head - "Get to it."

GENE shoves the photograph away as if it could incriminate

him, then slides out the itinerary.

The itinerary says "California Educators' Association - 12:00

noon - Emerald Bay Room - Opening Address - Governor Eleanor

Samara Grant".

GENE checks his watch.

12:26.

He looks around him at the confusion and spots a Bellboy,

GUSTINO, who's cleaning out ashtrays.

GUSTINO points up.

GENE turns away without a word, starts to walk, then turns

back.

GUSTINO smiles.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:26PM

GENE mounts a set of stairs that will take him to the third

floor. MR. SMITH follows him as he climbs.

INT. "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:2 6PM

The whole lobby and entrance of the hotel are seen as Gene

ascends.

GENE forces himself not to look at MR. SMITH behind him. His

nerves are rising in anticipation of his destination.

INT. THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 12:26PM

GENE sees the arrow and sign for the Emerald Bay Room.  He

walks that way. MR. SMITH follows.

INT. THIRD FLOOR - SHOP ARCADE AREA - DAY - 12:27PM

GENE and MR. SMITH pass gift shops, snack bars. The walkway

is crowded and GENE is going against the tide of REPORTERS,

POLITICIANS, SUPPORTERS, and just a lot of PEOPLE WITH NAME

TAGS.

GENE plows on through...

...and runs smack into BRENDAN GRANT.

The two men reel back from each other. A SECURITY MAN,

earphones and gray suit, steps immediately between them.

BRENDAN GRANT is a charmingly smooth man.

He continues on, talking to an ATTRACTIVE WCMAN COMPANION.

BRENDAN GRANT What the Governor really admires, Mrs. Wentzel,

and Eleanor has said this to me on more than one occasion,

are pecple like you who take a personal tragedy and turn it

into a positive force.

He slides a familiar hand around her waist.

And he is hustled away. Right past an election poster

featuring him and Governor Grant.

Still stunned by the encounter, GENE turns back and watches

the Governor's husband, but keeps walking.

INT. EMERALD BAY ROOM - DAY - 12:28PM

It is emptying, that's where the crowd came from. GENE comes

in.

A WOMAN is heading for the door with a centerpiece she's

just copped.

But GENE has turned away. The WOMAN gives him a face, grabs

another centerpiece and exits. A CLEAN-UP CREW is starting

to go through the room. GENE leans against a wall, breathing

through a combination of relief and agony.

MR. SMITH is suddenly next to him.

GENE gets out the itinerary. "12:30 - 12:45 - Hors d'oeuvres/

Buffet w/Friends of Eleanor Samara Grant - INVITATION ONLY -

Bona Vista Lounge".

MR SMITH digs  into the manila envelope, comes out with a

handful of security badges, name tags, invites. He plucks

the name tag that MS JONES printed earlier. It has a red

ribbon signifying a Major Donor to the Campaign. He fastens

it to Gene's lapel.

INT. LOBBY ENTRANCE TO THE "RED" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:28PM

GENE approaches. He notices a flurry of movement, a small

GROUP OF PEOPLE moving determinedly through the lobby. It is

GOVERNOR ELEANOR GRANT with a small entourage!  She is a

handsome woman in her fifties. The entourage consists of

KRISTA BROOKS, Eleanor's, late-twenties assistant, a few

assorted POLITICAL AIDES and a couple of PEOPLE WITH NAME

TAGS. GENE is not sure what to do. The group reaches the

elevator. KRISTA pushes the button.

KRISTA turns to an Aide.

The elevator doors open. They crowd in. The doors start to

close.

Gene looks around, where did Mr. Smith go?

GENE springs forward, thrusts his hand between them. The

doors stop, then bounce open. GENE is startled, finding

himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard.

She smiles charmingly, offers her hand to GENE.

GENE steps aboard, shakes her hand.

INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM

The elevator begins to rise.

INSERT FLOOR INDICATOR

We are on the third floor.

The doors have closed and the elevator begins to rise.

It comes out a little louder then he intended. He has turned,

his back to the door. Everyone looks at him. He's committed.

The elevator slows and stops on the next floor above.

INSERT FLOOR INDICATOR

We are on the fourth floor.

Behind GENE, the doors open.

GENE freezes.

She offers her hand to MR. SMITH as he steps on board.

The car begins to rise again. ELEANOR .GRANT turns back to

GENE.

ANGLE ON MR SMITH

Yes???

ANGLE ON GENE

What to do now?

GENE looks at her. She smiles back.

He looks at what she refers to: the manila envelope he holds,

the one MR. SMITH gave him.

He gives it to ELEANOR GRANT. KRISTA hands over the pen.

GENE's eyes flick over to MR. SMITH who is staring at the

envelope.

GENE looks at the Governor, only inches away, back to MR.

SMITH, who raises his eyes, nods, his silent message curt -

do it! GENE pulls his eyes away.

ELEANOR GRANT writes the autograph. MR. SMITH'S eyes drill

into him. GENE looks over. MR. SMITH raises a hand to his

face, pretends to scratch an itch. His other hand taps his

wristwatch. GENE's hand slides toward his jacket pocket.

Sweat beads on his forehead. He's barely aware of KRISTA

talking to him.

He gives her a quick, weak smile. His free hand wipes the

sweat from his face.

He is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops

when he notices MR. SMITH'S hand slide into his jacket, where

his gun is.

He looks at the other MR. SMITH, earphone, crewcut-Security.

There is the hint of a gun on his hip.

GENE's eyes widen, dart to MR. SMITH'S face, his hand sliding

into his coat. His hand hovers over his gun, trembling. Is

the SECURITY MAN staring at him?

ELEANOR GRANT hands over the autograph.

GENE gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away. He takes

his hand out of his pocket. It's shaking. He clenches it to

stop the shakes.

The doors open, startling him.

INT. THIRTY-FIFTH FLOOR - DAY - 12:2 9PM

ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage exit to greetings and

applause.

GENE stays in the elevator, frozen, alone with MR. SMITH.

The doors close and the elevator descends.

INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM

MR. SMITH is fuming, his face red. He explodes.

His fists clench. He seems about to lose control. He backs

GENE into a corner, physically terrified.

He raises a fist. Struggles with the impulse to smash GENE,

controls it. Angrily, he takes the gun from GENE's pocket,

expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket.

He indicates the glass,wall of the elevator with his eyes.

GENE looks out and down.

GENE'S POV

The van. It's moving into a parking spot across from the

Bonaventure, on Flower Street.

INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:29PM

LYNN is coloring a picture in her stolen book. MS. JONES

takes a look.

INT. RED ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:29PM

The elevator continues its descent and the van disappears

from view. GENE strains to see it again, but it's impossible.

MR. SMITH jams the loaded gun into GENE's pocket.

The elevator, doors open into the lobby.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - YELLOW ELEVATOR LOBBY -

DAY - 12:29PM

MR. SMITH walks out. GENE follows. MR. SMITH, suddenly becomes

self-conscious, walks away from GENE. The object of his

shyness: A JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE nearby. The man is taping

his wife with a video camera.

VIEW THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA - 12:31PM

We see what the camera is seeing, the WIFE, smiling. Behind

her, we see GENE, looking confusedly after Mr. Smith.  He

turns, walks out of frame. In the corner of the picture, a

read-out of the TIME:

12:31:00.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:31PM

Back in real life, GENE walks toward a shoeshine stand outside

the Men's Room. "Huey's Polished Act" and below that, hand-

lettered, "Disabled Veteran" where HUEY himself, a fiftyish

black man, reads a "Smithsonian" magazine.

He sees GENE and perks up - a customer.

But GENE goes right past HUEY and into the Men's Room.

HUEY gives up, goes back to his magazine.

INT. MEN'S ROOM. - DAY - 12:31PM

Gene goes- over to one of the sinks, runs the cold water,

splashes his face, looks in the mirror, into his own eyes.

He tries to find an answer, a way out. A pay phone, on the

wall behind him, comes into focus. Then a hand reaches in,

grabs the receiver...and yanks it, snapping the wire.  Gene

spins around.  It is MR. SMITH, of course.

MR. SMITH smiles. GENE doesn't. MR. SMITH leaves.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY

GENE exits the Men's Room and walks back the route he came.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:32PM

HUEY sets down his magazine again.

It's HUEY's usual patter, he's said it a thousand times.

GENE looks around.

MR. SMITH is in the lounge area, facing the Flower Street

entrance, able to keep the Men's Room and GENE in view.

GENE lets HUEY usher him into a chair.

The gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the

chair. A grim reminder. He pulls out the itinerary.

ECU - ITINERARY

12:45  -  Governor Eleanor Samara Grant  -  Pacific Rim

Multi-Cultural Conference  -  Pool Deck  -  Fourth Floor

GENE looks at his watch.

ECU WATCH

12:32.

The minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches.

ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM

He works away at GENE's shoes.

It's more of HUEY's patter, no real substance to the inquiry.

GENE watches MR. SMITH frown and amble toward the shoeshine

stand.

ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:33PM

He takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his

chair.

ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM

The Bellboy GUSTINO walks by, calls out to HUEY.

GUSTINO laughs, waves.

GENE I keep wondering what she would do if she was here.

She'd figure it out. She'd run it down like a column of

numbers. Pro's and cons. That's the way she was: Lists all

over the house.

HUEY's manic shoe-shining slows down: who has he got in his

chair?

HUEY keeps his eyes on his work. He's afraid he's got a live

one.

HUEY gestures for GENE to get down. GENE steps to the floor.

He pays HUEY with a twenty.

GENE is thinking about something.

GENE looks around the lobby, at MR. SMITH, the Flower Street

entrance, the rest of the area, feeling the gun in his pocket.

HUEY nods toward the bar.

GENE walks toward the bar. HUEY shakes his head: time for

the boys in white.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:35PM

GENE looks towards the Flower Street entrance. The van is

still there. A bus pulls up.

GENE walks past MR. SMITH.

He heads up to the bar.

But GENE is long gone.

INT. HOTEL BAR AREA - DAY - 12:3 6PM

GENE walks into the area of the bar. The BARTENDER is just

returning to chat with a customer, a REPORTER who is getting

sloshed. GENE moves slowly along the bar, into an area where

MR. SMITH'S view of him is blocked.

GENE hears this and glances towards them.

GENE sees that MR.SMITH can no longer see him. He scans the

lobby, sees a smaller door that leads onto Flower Street.

The BARTENDER laughs. GENE quickly cuts across the lobby and

out the smaller door onto Flower Street.

EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY - 12:3 6PM

GENE comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving

through the traffic.

Once across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping

low, sneaking up behind it. He crouches by the front door,

one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on

the door handle. He raises his head cautiously and looks

inside the cab.

No MS. JONES up front at least. He takes a breath, braces

himself. With one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks

out the gun.

INT. VAN - DAY - 12:37PM

The first thing he sees, fixates on, is LYNN. She is stretched

out on the seat, eyes closed, mouth open. She appears dead.

MS. JONES is sitting on the seat behind the one LYNN is on.

GENE points the gun at her face. She smiles.

GENE look at Lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand.

He lowers the gun, defeated.

EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY

GENE climbs out of the van, shuts the door, leans there. The

gall of his defeat is hard to swallow. He realizes he's

holding the gun, hurriedly tucks it away.

INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:38PM

MS. JONES puts her gun down, raises a walkie-talkie.

INT. BUFFET AREA - DAY - 12:38PM

MR. SMITH near the entrance, eating some food. He watches

GENE walk past him. Their eyes meet.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:39PM

GENE looks at his watch, then checks the itinerary once more.

ECU - ITINERARY

12:45 -  Governor Eleanor Samara Grant - Pacific Kim Multi-

Cultural Conference - Pool Deck - Fourth Floor

ANGLE ON GENE-NEAR BUFFET AREA - 12:39PM

GENE addresses another Bellboy, HECTOR who is moving luggage

out to the street.

GENE thanks him and moves across the lobby MR. SMITH follows

GENE

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - BAR AREA - DAY - 12:39PM

GENE heads toward the escalators. Ahead of him, he sees

ELEANOR GRANT and BRENDAN GRANT surrounded by AIDES and

SECURITY MEN facing a crowd of PRESS PEOPLE. The Governor

and her husband have an arm around each other. They are

smiling, relaxed, quite the" happy couple. They give each

other a warm kiss. Camera flashes, recording the moment.

GENE, heading toward them, has to thread his way through a

large WEDDING PARTY - tuxedos and bridesmaid gowns. When he

clears them he has neared the impromptu press conference.

ANGLE ON BRENDAN GRANT - 12:3 9PM

He is now alone in front of a campaign poster, fielding

questions from a few remaining REPORTERS.

Farther on, ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage can be seen taking

the escalator up. GENE heads that way, passing BRENDAN GRANT.

A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN walks by. The Governor's husband's eyes

follow her appreciatively as he says:

ANGLE ON GENE - 12:40PM

He nears the escalator. It's crowded and GENE is pulled into

the midst of NEWS PEOPLE, TV, RADIO, PRESS. He joins the

flow and lets it pull him along.

GENE rides the escalator to the Second Floor and follows the

crowd up two flights of the circular stairs.

Down a short tunnel and out onto the Pool Deck.

EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - POOL, DECK - HIGH ANGLE - 12:41PM

About an acre of grass on the Fourth Floor. Skyways connect

the Pool Deck to the office buildings across Flower and

Figueroa. A platform has been set up with chairs and

microphones in front of a podium.

EXT. POOL DECK - CLOSE ANGLE ON GENE - 12:41PM

GENE blinks in the sudden, bright sunshine. When his eyes

adjust, he finds himself in a line that is approaching A

SECURITY MAN with a hand-held metal detector. He panics,

turns, trying to escape, but finds himself bumped along,

trapped. The line shuffles forward. He turns, determined to

make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a

2ND SECURITY MAN, who waves him to one side.

2ND SECURITY MAN Excuse me, sir, You don't have to wait. I

can take you over here.

GENE is dragged forward. He looks around; no way out. He

stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of

his body, is lifted over to the other. Down it slides, toward

the pocket concealing the gun. GENE waits for the alarm -

which doesn't come. The SECURITY MAN operating the gizmo

deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon. GENE is pushed

on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among:

PRESS by the dozens. Eleanor Samara Grant SUPPORTERS by the

hundreds. SECURITY MEN and COPS IN UNIFORM. GENE moves through

them, trying to figure out what just happened. He glances

back to the 2ND SECURITY MAN, and bumps into one particular

POLICE OFFICER, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts

with a quick laugh.

POLICE OFFICER Easy, sir. Got to watch where you're going in

a crowd like this.

He is a handsome, solid-looking guy. You'd trust him. Call

him OFFICER TRUST. OFFICER TRUST seems to be in charge. He

moves off through the crowd, giving LOCAL POLICE orders in

an easy way.

GENE looks around. He can't see MR. SMITH. He edges his way

after OFFICER TRUST, who reaches the wall beyond which is

the drop to the street. He leans there comfortably, scanning

the crowd, GENE reaches the wall a few yards away from him.

He looks out at the city, getting his courage up. Just as he

turns to approach OFFICER TRUST:

GENE freezes! MR. SMITH appears from the crowd, joins him.

He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it.

He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it.

He flips the walkie-talkie. GENE lashes out, smacks the walkie-

talkie. It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the

sidewalk four stories below.

MR. SMITH goes ballistic.

GENE walks away from him - right up to OFFICER TRUST.

OFFICER TRUST looks at MR. SMITH and then at GENE.

And OFFICER TRUST reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie-

Talkie that he tosses to MR. SMITH.

OFFICER TRUST walks away.

MR. SMITH stares at a devastated GENE. He sticks the walkie-

talkie into his pocket, grabs GENE under the arm, drags him

to an isolated corner.

The WAITER offers a tray of hors d'houvres.

GENE shakes his head.

GENE woodenly takes one. The WAITER moves on.

We see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting.

GENE stares at him for a beat.

He moves in on GENE, crowding him. He breathes hard, looks

like one insane piece of work.

A wave of applause catches their attention.

ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT

She and her entourage enter the Pool Deck and walk toward

the platform. ELEANOR GRANT gladhands people on the way.

ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:45PM

He turns' back to GENE.

He grabs GENE and gives him a push. There is a general

movement in the crowd toward the platform. GENE is buffeted

along. MR. SMITH follows him, keeping him in sight, but then

a PACK OF PHOTOGRAPHERS move in, start snapping, lifting

their cameras high to shoot over the crowd. MR. SMITH

instinctively turns away, hiding his face. He moves around

the PHOTOGS and finds himself separated from GENE by the

mob. He searches, trying to spot him.

ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM

In the crowd, GENE is bumped this way and that. His face

displays an inner devastation. His eyes focus desperately on

something ahead:

It is the back of ELEANOR GRANT'S head. She is turning this

way and that, greeting supporters.

GENE's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. He is at

the end of his rope. He is going to do it.

ANGLE ON ROSTRUM

A local POLITICO mounts the platform, taps the microphone.

LOCAL POLITICO Can I have your attention Please! Please

welcome a man who was for 19 years the distinguished Mayor

of Los Angeles.  The honorable Tom Bradley.

The CROWD reacts loudly, yells and whistles. GENE-pushes his

way forward.

ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM

He is now a few yards from ELEANOR GRANT. He comes up against

the SECURITY MAN who gave him the once-over with the metal

detector. The man's eyes slide over him, then he looks away.

He nonchalantly steps aside, moves off through the CROWD.

GENE is close to ELEANOR GRANT. She is just a few bodies

away, visible between them. His hand moves in his pocket. He

swallows. The impulse sweeps over him and...

KRISTA BROOKS, the young woman from the elevator is next to

him, smiling. He looks at her in confusion.

GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT.

GENE turns, scans the crowd - no sign of MR. SMITH.

GENE looks at KRISTA, studies her intensely. She's a bit

unnerved.

Again GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT. She's turning around,

facing the crowd, facing him.

ELEANOR GRANT raises her arms. A perfect target. The CROWD

roars as GENE turns back to KRISTA. He leans into her, speaks.

Krista looks at Gene.

Krista assesses Gene, his desperate tone of voice. Obviously

a nut case. A well-dressed nut case, but a nut case

nevertheless. Krista, nervous, looks around for help.

Gene pulls the gun, holding it in Krista's sight only,

unnoticed by anyone else.

Krista stares wide-eyed at the gun, at Gene.

ANGLE ON THE ROSTRUM

ELEANOR GRANT takes over the microphone from the beaming

LOCAL POLITICO.

ANGLE ON THE CROWD

Gene and Krista are gone.

EXT. BEHIND THE PLATFORM - DAY - 12:47PM

Hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe

of the CROWD, GENE confronts KRISTA, covering her with the

pocketed gun. In the background, ELEANOR GRANT delivers a

ringing speech, accented with applause.

KRISTA tries to edge away.

GENE pulls the gun from his pocket. She recoils, thinking

he's going to shoot her.

KRISTA stares at the gun. She can't deny the fact.

GENE looks at her intently.

GENE offers KRISTA the gun. She is surprised, to say the

least. She takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her

fingers.

She stares at the gun, at the strange man.

She steps closer to the platform/ listens. ELEANOR GRANT'S

voice is heard.

KRISTA checks her watch.

12:48.

She starts to lead him away.

He stops her, points to the gun she still holds.

She pulls out a handkerchief, covers the gun and tucks it

out of sight as she leads him behind the platform and away.

EXT. POOL DECK - DAY - 12:4 9PM

MR. SMITH still roams the crowd, looking for Gene.

He sees OFFICER TRUST who gives him a questioning look. He

ignores it.

MR SMITH notices the JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE we met before.

The man has the video camera pointed at a sharp up angle.

MR. SMITH glances up toward what the man is shooting.

Consternation and anger fill his face.

ANGLE ON RED BONAVENTURE TOWER - 12:4 9PM

What he sees is one of the exterior elevators rising. KRISTA

stands at the glass looking down. Behind her, just glimpsed,

is GENE.

ANGLE ON MR. SMITH

MR. SMITH cuts a wake through the CROWD.

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - DAY - 12:.50PM

The elevator doors open. GENE and KRISTA bolt out and hurry

down the hall.

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - SECURITY TABLE - DAY - 12:50PM

KRISTA leads GENE past the SECURITY GUARD stationed in the

hallway at a small table. GENE tries to keep his face turned

away. The GUARD glances up.

They walk past him. He's a bit curious about GENE, but shrugs

it off.

GENE and KRISTA reach a door and knock.

The door opens. BRENDAN GRANT is framed there.

She grabs GENE and pushes inside.

INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:51PM

Upscale suite. BRENDAN GRANT'S coat is draped on a chair.

KRISTA moves past him, pulling GENE.

There is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent

bathroom. The door opens and A MAN emerges drying his hands

on a hotel towel. He is late-middle-aged, white, mild-looking,

perhaps wearing glasses.

KRISTA gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands

it to him. It lays in the palm of his hand. He unwraps it

awkwardly, examines it.

He looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite.

GENE turns, to see who he is talking to.

ANGLE ON DOORWAY - 12:.53PM

MR. SMITH stands by the open door. Before GENE can speak,

MR. SMITH moves. It is fluid and cohtroled and fast. He

marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the

couch. He takes the gun, shoves" it- into the pillow and

goes face to face with KRISTA. She just has time to wonder

what is going on There is a double muffled gunshot. Shock

fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. GENE can only stand

there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills.

The door opens. OFFICER TRUST slides in quickly.

OFFICER TRUST checks the hall, shuts the door. They begin to

drag her body to the bathroom. The MYSTERY MAN watches.

GENE's eyes follow them. As if rousing from a sleep he comes

to life.

He tries to rush to the bathroom but MR. SMITH is right there,

gripping him. GENE struggles frantically, uselessly, watching

the bathroom door close. MR. SMITH is beyond anger. He grabs

GENE'S throat, muscles down. GENE grips the iron hand that's

cutting off his air.

The MYSTERY MAN grabs MR. SMITH'S arm, tries to pry him loose.

MR. SMITH is beyond reason.

GENE's eyes begin to roll back in his head. Everything begins

fading to black.

The blackness retreats in a rush and GENE finds himself

staring at the butt of MR. SMITH'S gun, visible under his

coat. He reaches for it, yanks it out, fires point-blank

into

MR. SMITH, again, again. MR. SMITH'S shocked face falls away.

GENE heads for the door.

OFFICER TRUST steps between GENE and the door. GENE shoots

him down and is out the door.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

GENE stumbles out in the hall, gun in hand. He hurries down

the hall, looking back to see the MYSTERY MAN and a wounded

OFFICER TRUST spill out of Room 2503. The HALL OFFICER pulls

his weapon MYSTERY MAN Get him!

GENE fires at the HALL OFFICER who goes down. GENE rushes

down the hall. One of the guest room door's opens and a MAN

staggers out. It is a bloody, wounded MR. SMITH! GENE stops

in shock.

And MR. SMITH grabs him by the collar and throws him over a

railing.

INT. THE LOBBY - MID-AIR - DAY

GENE is falling, falling. He passes the ascending elevator

and gets a glimpse of MS. JONES and LYNN, pressed against

the glass, her face a mask of terror. The floor rushes up to

meet GENE and...

INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:5 6PM

...he hits the floor, thrown there by MR. SMITH. His escape

has been a dream. A wrist-watch fills the frame.

12:56.

It is GENE's. We are seeing his P.O.V. He's laying on the

floor, his watch-hand in front of his face.

Lose the P.O.V.

GENE stirs on the floor.

He yanks GENE to his feet.

He pulls GENE over to the bathroom door. Throws it open.

GENE reacts to what he sees within.

MR. SMITH takes GENE out of the suite into the hall.  The

door closes. Brendan, the Mystery Man and Officer Trust are

alone BRENDAN GRANT I don't know if we should go through

with this.

BRENDAN GRANT laughs.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 12:57PM

OFFICER TRUST exits from the room and engages the HALL OFFICER

in conversation down the hall. GENE and MR. SMITH turns the

other way, walk. In an undertone:

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - ELEVATOR FOYER - DAY - 12:58PM

They reach the elevator. MR. SMITH punches the button. GENE

turns on him.

He gets out the walkie-talkie, keys it.

MR. SMITH is getting nothing but static. He angrily keys

off, hisses at GENE:

The elevator doors open. MR. SMITH gestures graciously.

INT. "BLUE" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:58PM

They step into the elevator. Stare at each other. The doors

close. MR. SMITH erupts. He grabs GENE slams him into the

outside window. GENE's face is smashed into the glass by MR.

SMITH'S shoulder. His body presses GENE against the glass

wall and he speaks, his mouth an inch from GENE's ear.

The van can be seen below on Flower Street.

WHAM! He slams GENE's head against the window. He lifts up

the walkie-talkie.

He jabs the walkie-talkie next to GENE's ear.

And then a scream. The horrible sound of a little girl in

terrible pain. It cuts through GENE like a stab in the heart.

He struggles to turn around. MR. SMITH kidney punches him,

hard! GENE goes down on one knee.

The car stops. SOMEONE starts to board it, stops in surprise.

MR. SMITH sticks a badge in their face.

They back off. The doors close, the car continues its descent.

MR. SMITH lifts the walkie-talkie.

Another bone-chilling scream from the walkie-talkie. GENE is

ripped to his soul. MR. SMITH hauls him to his feet, shoves

him against the glass.

MR. SMITH releases GENE, who goes limp. The elevator doors

open onto the lobby.

MR. SMITH gets out, straightening his tie, wiping the sweat

from his face.

INT. THIRD FLOOR "GREEN" ELEVATOR LOBBY - DAY - 12:59PM

GENE gets out of the elevator, almost getting caught in the

closing doors. He can't even fight back at the doors. They

pound him a couple of times before he is able to step clear

of the elevator. GENE stifles a retch, hurries away.

MR. SMITH is standing there. Childish giggles erupt from the

walkie-talkie.

INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:00PM

MS. JONES holds the walkie-talkie for LYNN.

OMIT

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:01PM

GENE staggers over to the row of sinks. Leaning on one sink

with both hands, his body shudders violently. And he throws

up.

A man exits a toilet stall and walks toward the sinks. He

sees GENE retching, turns away in disgust, and leaves quickly.

GENE turns on the faucets.to wash the mess away.

He tries to clean up, but catches his reflection in the

mirror. He has trouble looking himself in the eye.

INT. THIRD FLOOR LOBBY - DAY - 1:01PM

MR. SMITH is fuming. Into the walkie-talkie:

INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:01PM

MS. JONES tries to be private on the walkie-talkie.

LYNN watches her, knowing something's not quite right.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - EXT MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:02PM

GENE comes out of the Men's Room, stands there at a loss.

GENE looks around. HUEY has his nose in his magazine, calling

out his patter for whoever drifts by.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:02PM

GENE walks over, climbs into a chair.

GENE has settled into the chair. HUEY tosses the magazine

aside, swings into action...

...and freezes, staring at the familiar pair of shoes.

GENE looks down at him.

HUEY kneels down, gets his cashbox, starts to open it up.

From behind him:

It spills out of GENE almost without volition. There's a

note of pleading hidden in it. GENE slowly points a thumb at

HUEY's "Disabled Veteran" sign.

MR. SMITH looks at the sign. HUEY stops what he's doing -

"What the fuck?" He almost says it aloud, then:

HUEY's face settles into something cold. What's he going to

do?  He stands, looks at GENE, who stares back at him, then

slowly turns around, looks at MR. SMITH - and breaks into a

jive-ass grin.

MR. SMITH is suspicious but he climbs into the second chair.

HUEY goes to work on his shoes.

Unseen by MR. SMITH, HUEY takes a peek and sees the gun being

transferred to GENE's pocket.

GENE does.

"1:'30 - California Leads the Nation into the 21st Century -

California Ballroom - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant and

Brendan Grant" It is the last entry.

He looks at his watch.

1:04.

MR. SMITH doesn't reply.

They stare at each other for a few beats. Then MR. SMITH

checks HUEY out and gets out the walkie-talkie.

GENE grabs the walkie-talkie.

INT. THE VAN - DAY -1:05PM

MS. JONES holds the walkie-talkie for LYNN.

INT. BONAVENTURE LOBBY - DAY - 1:05PM

MR. SMITH, GENE and HUEY in situ.

He reaches for the walkie-talkie, but GENE stares him down.

Back to the walkie-talkie:

MR. SMITH grabs the walkie-talkie.

He reaches down, snaps his fingers in HUEY's face. HUEY looks

up.

He gives the shoes a final wipe, stands away.

He throws a couple dollars to HUEY. To GENE as he stalks

away:

TO HIS BACK:

HUEY turns back to GENE. They stare at each other.

GENE lowers his head, covers his mouth with a hand. HUEY

pretends to work on his shoes.

HUEY checks his perimeters, then:

He gets out her picture, stares at it.

HUEY takes his wooden brush and whacks GENE on the foot,

snapping him from his downward spiral.

GENE gets down.

He gives HUEY a twenty.

GENE just stands there. HUEY has to give him a little push.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:09PM

GENE turns and walks across the lobby toward the bar. His

mind is racing. As he passes MR. SMITH...

MR. SMITH rises immediately, looks back at HUEY. HUEY gives

him a symbolic tip of the hat. MR. SMITH follows GENE.

INT. HOTEL BAR - DAY - 1:11PM

GENE finds a stool at the empty part of the bar. The place

is half-full, noisy. The television is showing a game show.

The BARTENDER comes over.

MR. SMITH sits -at the other end of the bar. The BARTENDER

gets him a beer. GENE and MR. SMITH lock eyes in the mirror.

Between them, a couple of T.V. NEWS TECHNICIANS are grabbing

a quick beer. A video camera resides on the bar by them.

GENE notices OFFICER TRUST, walking by on a level above,

watching him.

A WAITRESS appears suddenly at GENE's elbow, surprising him.

She puts a basket of pretzels next to him and a coaster next

to his drink.

The WAITRESS is tapping a long fingernail against the bar.

GENE looks down and sees it. A note on the coaster. "Men's

Room - Huey."

The WAITRESS turns the coaster over, and leaves. GENE looks

down the bar at MR. SMITH, drinking, unaware.

GENE looks at his watch.

1:12.

GENE stands.

The T.V. NEWS TECHNICIANS stare at him.

He heads for the open lobby.

GENE jerks a thumb at MR. SMITH and is gone. MR. SMITH starts

to follow him. The BARTENDER is right with him.

MR. SMITH slaps some money on the bar and leaves.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:13PM

MR. SMITH scans the lobby trying to spot Gene. OFFICER TRUST

comes up behind him.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOP ARCADE - DAY - 1:13PM

Elsewhere, GENE circles around the lobby. There seem to be

clocks everywhere.

A. set of four clocks over the registration desk with the

time for Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris.

The souvenir shop has a dozen clocks on display, with the

logos of various LA sports teams.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - RESTAURANT AREA - DAY - 1:14PM

The restaurant, the travel agency, the newsstand, all have

clocks.

1:14 .

Everywhere he turns. GENE has to look at his watch.

1:15! GENE's watch and all the clocks tick over at once.

GENE winces as if he could hear all those minute hands tick

over one number in a thunderous chorus.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:16PM

He's near the Men's Room. HUEY's stand has a sign on the

chair - "Gone to Lunch" and there is a clock face with

moveable hands. "We'll be back at 1:30."

And he enters the Men's Room.

Across the lobby MR. SMITH spots him, heads that way.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM

GENE enters to find HUEY and GUSTINO the Bellboy. HUEY runs

to the door, keeping a lookout.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:16PM

MR. SMITH marching towards the Men's Room.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM

HUEY turns to see GENE and GUSTINO just looking at each other,

uncomfortable, to say the least.

GENE kicks off his shoes, shucks his pants. He trades his

pants and jacket with GUSTINO, who has done the same.

GUSTINO's pants are too big for GENE. His pants are too small

for GUSTINO.

GUSTINO goes into a stall and closes the door.

HUEY comes back from the door.

GUSTINO has taken a seat inside the stall, but with GENE's

pants still up. He drops them.

HUEY leads GENE to another door. "Service Personnel Only".

He taps on it. It is opened by a Latino JANITOR. HUEY and

GENE slip through the door, shut it. The JANITOR begins

mopping the floor as MR. SMITH comes in.

His eyes come to rest on the stall. All he sees are GENE's

shoes and GENE's pants crumpled around the ankles.

MR. SMITH smirks and leaves.

The Janitor raps on GUSTINO's stall with the mop.

INT. SERVICE HALL - DAY - 1:17PM

HUEY and GENE move down a drab service corridor. Boxes stacked

on both sides, floor buffers at rest, shelves with cleaning

supplies. GENE notices for the first time that HUEY has a

pronounced limp.

They come upon IRENE the Cleaning Woman. She joins them moving

down the corridor.

IRENE takes GENE's hand and leads him along at a half-trot.

INT. BONAVENTURE - SERVICE ELEVATOR FOYER - DAY - 1:17PM

They come through a short corridor and onto the service

elevator.

The elevator doors close.

INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAT - 1:17PM

IRENE punches the button for the twenty-fifth floor.

HUEY takes a pillow and a blanket from IRENE'S cart and puts

it into GENE's arms IRENE You don't have to save me. I got

nothin' to do with it. You ain't gettin' no key from me.

The service elevator stops. IRENE pushes her cart out into

the hall signalling them to stay put for a second. She starts

moving out into the hall, the card key falls on the floor.

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:17PM

At the other end of the hall the HALL OFFICER turns when he

hears her approach.

INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY -

GENE and HUEY hover in the door of the service elevator.

Gene reaches down and snags the card key at his feet.

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:17PM

The HALL OFFICER has to move his table aside so Irene can

pass with the cart. As he turns,

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

HUEY pushes GENE across the hall to the door of the Governors

bedroom.

The Service Elevator door closes.

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:18PM

HALL OFFICER turns quickly at the noise.

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

GENE holds totally still in the alcove outside her room.

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:18PM

HALL OFFICER looks suspiciously, and finally sits back down.

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

GENE uses the key to let himself into

INT. ROOM 2510 - 1:18PM

Lit only by a bedside lamp. ELEANOR GRANT is laying on the

bed, dressed, towel across her eyes, bare feet elevated on a

pair of pillows. GENE edges over slowly to her. He stands

over her, not knowing how to begin.

ELEANOR GRANT lifts a hand, moves the towel from her eyes.

She sits upright, reaches for the phone! GENE moves, putting

his hand on top of hers on top of the phone.

They stare at each other for a beat.

She bolts for the door! Gene beats her to it! She backs up

to the bed.

Eleanor Grant is a strong, tough woman, but she's not

fearless.

She studies him.

He slowly pulls out the gun. She takes it in.

She smiles.

Very slowly, she moves to the table, lifts the phone ELEANOR

GRANT My assistant, Krista Brooks, takes care of

constituent...

She freezes, slowly replaces the phone.

She turns to him.

GENE glances at the bedside clock.

1:19.

He looks back to the Governor.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:19PM

An increasingly edgy MR. SMITH is looking at the Men's Room

door. He glances over to OFFICER TRUST who's keeping an eye

on him. He looks at his watch again, then gets up and heads

for the Men's Room.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:19PM

MR. SMITH enters. HECTOR is at the urinal.

MR. SMITH checks out the feet under the stall. He has to

bend over to check properly. GENE''s shoes, GENE' s pants

legs.

HECTOR notices MR. SMITH'S actions.

MR. SMITH is aware that he's been noticed, but he is very

suspicious.

HECTOR flushes the urinal.

MR. SMITH stays by the stall. He is going to look over the

top of the stall. He rises on his tiptoes.

But HECTOR is staring at him like he's a pervert.

MR. SMITH is suddenly embarrassed. He backs away from the

stall.

HECTOR washes his hands, watching MR. SMITH in the mirror.

MR. SMITH leaves.

HECTOR dries his hands. He walks over to the stall and knocks

on the door.

And GUSTINO tosses a Bellboy jacket over the top of the stall.

HECTOR puts it on.

INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:21PM

The clock on the nightstand.

1:21.

ELEANOR GRANT sits against the headboard. GENE sits on the

edge of the bed, the gun all but forgotten, held loosely in

his hand.

Her eyes go inward, reflecting a vague doubt. GENE sees it,

hurries to follow up on this possible chink in her armor.

Excited by it, he gets up, forgets to cover her so closely.

GENE, across the room looks at the gun in his hand. He takes

the plunge.

ELEANOR GRANT'S hand sweeps the lamp off the table, plunging

the room into blackness.

GENE slips out into the hall as the connecting room door

flies open. Light from the other room spills in. FRANCO rushes

in, pulling a gun.

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - SECURITY TABLE - DAY - 1:22PM

The HALL OFFICER jumps from his chair and runs into the suite

INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

GENE quickly moves to the Service Elevator and pushes the

button.

INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:23PM

ELEANOR GRANT stares up at FRANCO, back-lit by the light

coming from the next room. It gleams off the gun he holds in

his hand. She stares from the gun up to his hulking frame.

She hesitates.

INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1:23PM

The service elevator opens and GENE rushes out. He hurries

down the dim service corridor. Suddenly an arm snakes out of

the blackness and grabs him! HUEY steps into the light.

GENE keeps moving fast.  HUEY limps to keep up

HUEY watches him disappear.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:23PM

MR. SMITH sees the T.V. TECHNICIAN and REPORTER leaving the

bar with their equipment.

MR. SMITH looks at the man who has appeared behind him.

He looks at his watch.

1:23.

MR. SMITH scowls and heads for the Men's Room.

INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:24PM

A different watch. The minute hand moves to:

1:24.

It is MS. JONES'. She is in the driver's seat. She looks

back at LYNN who is trying to amuse herself one way or

another. She checks her gun. She pulls out her walkie-talkie,

puts it on the seat beside her. She starts the car.

She pulls the van out into traffic.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:24PM

MR. SMITH bursts into the Men's Room. He goes to the stall

and lifts his fist to pound on the door.

The stall door opens and GENE comes out, zipping up his pants.

He brushes right past MR. SMITH, heads for the door. MR.

SMITH reaches out, grabs him.

He throws him against the sinks. GENE washes his hands. MR.

SMITH leans against the sink next to him In the mirror above

the sink, GENE sees the stall door swings open. GUSTINO Is

huddled in the corner, feet up on the toilet. MR. SMITH

doesn't notice.

GENE steps between MR. SMITH and the open stall door.

And'they exit the Men's Room. GUSTINO slumps with relief.

INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:25PM

Other lights have been turned on. ELEANOR GRANT is fixing

her hair in the mirror. FRANCO is cleaning up the broken

lamp. There is a perfunctory knock on the hall door and it

opens, revealing BRENDAN GRANT. The MYSTERY MAN hovers in

the background.

She turns, locks eyes with the MYSTERY MAN.

She nods, turns back to the mirror.

In the mirror she takes note of BRENDAN GRANT and the MYSTERY

MAN exchange a look.

BRENDAN steps into the room, shuts the door.

Brendan steps behind Eleanor and puts his arms around her

affectionately.

ELEANOR GRANT looks at him, almost sadly. She steps toward

the dressing table to fix her hair

BRENDAN looks at her for a beat, then snaps his fingers like

he just remembered something.

ANGLE ON ELEANOR

It was not what she wanted to hear.

Mr. Smith pushes Gene toward the escalators.

INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:27PM

All sorts of MEDIA PEOPLE hover around, CAMPAIGN WORKERS

wearing political buttons and REGULAR FOLKS round out the

crowd. People are eating, drinking, and talking.

There are a couple of bars, one at each end of the room.

Dessert tables are strategically placed around the room. On

the speaker's platform at one end is a podium with some chairs

arranged behind it.

One of the POLITICO'S takes the podium microphone.

The crowd applauds warmly.

Polite laughter.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 1:27PM

GENE is pushed up to the doorway where he is met by our

friend, the SECURITY MAN with the metal detector. He gives

MR. SMITH a nod over GENE's shoulder and sends GENE to join

the crowd beyond.

INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:28PM

VIEW THROUGH CAMERA

The Video Camera clumsily tracks past the CROWD, and comes

tosettle on GENE who is walking into the room, not quite

sure where he is going.

UP ON THE PODIUM:

GENE is pushing forward into the crowd. He looks back, seems

surprised, begins turning, searching for someone as:

Laughter.

Lose the video camera effect.

ANGLE ON GENE - 1:28PM

GENE, in the midst of the crowd, can't locate MR. SMITH.

Confusion clouds his face.

He finds himself near the T.V.TECHNICIAN from the bar. The

TECHNICIAN is talking into a walkie-talkie.

He gets nothing but static. GENE's eyes move to the back of

the room.

GENE looks up to a spotlight booth set up in the back.

GENE sees the GLINT of something. A gun? His eyes widen. Is

that MR SMITH there? He looks from the spotlight booth to

the stage.

GENE looks away from the stage and locks eyes with OFFICER

TRUST. He's at the front of the ballroom to one side of the

speaker's platform.

OFFICER TRUST stares at GENE like a hungry wolf, clutching

his gun in his pocket. They both hear:

Realization floods GENE'S eyes. He looks back at Mr. Smith

in he booth.

ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - EXTREME CLOSEUP

The camera pans along the barrel of the weapon until it comes

to Mr. Smith who is settling into firing position.

ANGLE ON CROWD

OFFICER TRUST, presses forward, hand in pocket. Gene is his

target.

ANGLE ON PODIUM - 1:29PM

ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT

The crowd erupts in .applause and cheering as ELEANOR GRANT

comes from the rear of the auditorium and begins to work her

way down the center aisle. She waves and nods to all the

lyal supporters who surround her.

Ballons are released above her onto the center of the floor.

ANGLE ON WAITER-GUSTINO

He is pushing a large high cart filled with hundreds of

finished plates back towards the kitchen area.

ANGLE ON GENE - 1:30PM

GENE looks at Mr. Smith and Officer Trust and the impending

disaster. He has to do something...anything...NOW!

GENE begins frantically clawing his way toward the podium.

But it is lost in the uproar.

Fighting to be heard above the noise:

GENE clawing forward, screaming hopelessly. He pulls the gun

out.

ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT

She spots Gene in the crowd, pushing toward her, gun drawn.

Her eyes widen in fear.

BRENDAN GRANT follows her gaze. His eyes widen in something

other than fear.

GENE aims his gun at the ceiling and fires.

BAM! BAM!

Pandemonium.  Total chaos. People scattering.

The Gun in the booth swings from Gene to ELEANOR GRANT.

Mr. Smith fires, but his target is blocked by a panicked

guest who is hit.

From behind her, FRANCO runs to protect ELEANOR GRANT as

more gunfire erupts.

Mr. Smith's aim is clear and he pulls...BAM!  BAM!

FRANCO is hit in the center of the back and in the shoulder.

He falls onto ELEANOR GRANT and they both fall down hard on

the steps. Blood is everywhere.

ANGLE ON GENE

He looks over and sees ELEANOR GRANT, beneath FRANCO, looking

very dead.

He careens toward a door.

ANGLE ON PODIUM

On the dais, BRENDAN GRANT crawls over to where FRANCO lays,

half on top of ELEANOR GRANT. They are both still, eyes

closed. BRENDAN looks down at his wife's face, splattered

with blood.

The Governor suddenly and violently gasps for breath.  Her

eyes snap open and burn into BRENDAN. She has heard her worst

suspicions confirmed.

BRENDAN'S a great liar, but even he can't hide the shock and

fear on his face.

INT. BACK HALLWAY - DAY

GENE bursts through a door. He is followed speedily by OFFICER

TRUST.

His attack is interrupted by a noise from the darkness. The

HUGE DISH PLATE CART, fully loaded, comes flying toward them

pushed by GUSTINO. The cart smashes into OFFICER TRUST,

throwing him against a wall, dishes clatter and smash.

GENE raises a hand to the darkness and takes off.

INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY

The dais. FRANCO takes a shuddering breath. ELEANOR GRANT

pulls herself free, leans over him. She rips opens his shirt

revealing a slightly-used bullet-proof vest with a bullet

hole that missed the vest and hit his upper arm. His eyes

flutter open.

She touches his face, looks over to where her husband stands.

Their eyes lock. It's curtains for BRENDAN.

EXT. HOTEL TAXI STAND - DAY

The van pulls into a waiting area.

INT. LOBBY - NEAR SHOESHINE STAND - DAY

realizes who it could be.

INT. THE LOBBY - DAY - 1:30PM

GENE 'bangs out of a door, comes to a failing and sees:

MR. SMITH has reached the spiral stairway. He starts down

it, two and three steps at a time.

GENE moves along the railing.

MR. SMITH is a whole floor below him. He looks up, sees GENE

and lifts the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

GENE pockets the gun climbs the parapet. And jumps!

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:30PM

GENE lands right on top of MR. SMITH. The walkie-talkie flies

over the railing and into the water of the central fountain.

INT. THE LOBBY - DAY - 1:31PM

MR. SMITH and GENE roll down the steps, fighting. MR. SMITH

basically beats the crap out of him and gets up to continue

on. GENE somehow pulls himself up and tackles MR. SMITH. He

gets in a few lucky shots before MR. SMITH overpowers him,

beats him again finally .sending him flying into the fountain

pool.

INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:31PM

MS JONES looks to the back seat at LYNN.

As they talk MS. JONES screws a silencer on her gun.

MS JONES turns to face LYNN.

LYNN closes her eyes. MS. JONES makes to do the deed.

Suddenly, HUEY appears behind her at the windshield.

With a crumpled up newspaper he begins vigorously rubbing

the window. LYNN's eyes pop open.

LYNN laughs.

He reaches in the passenger's window.

He snatches the walkie-talkie off the seat.

She lunges across. HUEY dangles the walkie-talkie before

her.

She throws open the passenger door, climbs out.

EXT. TAXI STAND - DAY

HUEY backs away, taunting her with the walkie-talkie. She is

caught between the van and HUEY, trying to keep her gun under

wraps.

She loses it, hauls out her cannon.

BAM!

HUEY's leg is shot out from under him. He ends up on his

back. MS. JONES swoops down on him, trying to grab the walkie-

talkie..

HUEY's wounded leg is twisted under him.

INT. THE VAN - DAY

Lynn is terrified by the gunfire and looks for someplace to

go.

EXT. THE VAN - DAY

MS. Jones jumps on the wounded HUEY who is stunned but bravely

clutches the Walkie Talkie under him.

She sticks the gun in HUEY's face. He tries to take it away

from her, but she's really tough...and mad.  The gun fires

wildly, hitting a passing vehicle which careens left causing

a chain reaction of COLLISIONS on the street.

INT. THE VAN - DAY

LYNN tries to open the van door to escape. The van's door

flies open. MR. SMITH stands there, gun in hand.-

He points the gun. Lynn jumps back in terror and clambers

back in the van.  She goes over the seat as he FIRES...

The back window SHATTERS.

MR SMITH steps inside the van a step and aims over the seat.

This time he won't miss.

LYNN has nowhere to hide.

BAM! BAM!

But it isn't his gun firing. He stands, staring surprised,

wide-eyed. He pivots...

EXT. TAXI STAND - DAY

...and stares at GENE, soaking wet, holding the gun. MR.

SMITH'S gun slides from his hand.

He drops to his knees, pauses, then tree-falls onto his face.

ANGLE ON GENE

He rushes forward into the van and reaches over the seat to

pick Lynn up.

ANGLE ON MS JONES AND HUEY

She has heard the gunfire and turns her attention from HUEY

to GENE. She raises her gun and aims at GENE and LYNN inside

the van.

HUEY reaches down, grabs his ankle and pulls his shattered

artificial leg out of the pants-leg and applies it to the

side of her head. She is knocked aside and out.

INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - LATER - 2:26PM

At HUEY's shoe-shine stand, GENE and HUEY sit in the shoe-

shining chairs. They are variously bandaged. LYNN is on GENE'S

lap. She clings to him, .her face buried against him.

They are guarded by COPS.

GENE looks at his wrist, gives an ironic smile.

A hub bub catches their attention.

ANGLE ON LOBBY AREA-BELOW - 2:26PM

A handcuffed BRENDAN GRANT is lead out by STATE POLICE. PRESS

flock around them - shouting questions.

ELEANOR GRANT watches her husband taken out.

The PRESS descends on her like ducks on bread crumbs.

Questions litter the air like confetti.

ELEANOR GRANT finally makes her way toward GENE. COPS keep

the PRESS back.

INT. BONAVENTURE - SHOESHINE STAND - 2:27PM

ELEANOR GRANT looks at GENE for a long moment.

GENE NODS, SMILES.

LYNN lets go of her father with one of her hands, gives a

shy little wave.

The Governor reaches out, strokes the little girl's hair.

LYNN looks up.

She goes back to clinging to her father.  Gene looks like he

might cry he, loves her so much.

LYNN nods. ELEANOR GRANT offers her hand to GENE.

ELEANOR GRANT walks away. The PRESS renews their assault.

HUEY and GENE look at each other. Then:

He gets up wearily, carrying his daughter, grabs his

briefcase, and heads away. LYNN peeks back over his shoulder

at HUEY, shyly waves. HUEY points at her.

LYNN laughs, comes to life.

INT. BONAVENTURE - LOBBY - DAY - 2:30PM

Across the lobby, GENE's watch lays on the ground. The crystal

is smashed, the hands stopped.

1:31.

A shoe steps on the watch, crushing it further. It belongs

to the MYSTERY MAN. He stops, checks his perimeters and walks

slowly toward the exit.
