FINAL DESTINATION

"FINAL DESTINATION"

Originally Called "FLIGHT 180"

By James Wong and Glen Morgan

January 15, 1999

Awaiting......each of us; a cold...dark...lonely place.

Deny its finality. Deride its totality. Dread the inescapable

inevitability......it will arrive.

The BLACK SILENT SCREEN senses this moment before a distant blues harp introduces a contemporary band's cover of Blood, Sweat, and Tears' campy, yet haunting, gospel, "And When I Die."

As the Introduction closes, RESONATES... A FLASH OF LIGHTING!

A CRACK OF THUNDER!

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE - BED

An airline ticket is tossed INTO FRAME beside a suitcase; "EURO-AIR. FLIGHT #180. New York City (JFK) - Paris, Charles de Gaulle (CDG.) Departure: Thursday 13May. 16H25 - Arrival: Friday 14May. 05H40."

"And When I Die" Continues throughout the MAIN TITLES:

AN OLD TABLE FAN

swivels beside and open window. Outside, a humid spring THUNDER STORM drops warm, ominous rain. The figure of a seventeen year old boy, ALEX BROWNING, packing for a trip, passing the fan...

THE BED

A Paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE BOOK as the fan's breezes flip through the pages.

THE TABLE FAN

turns, head swiveling away from the bed.

TIGHTER - THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

stop flipping, REVEALING A GULLOTINE from the Reign of Terror.

As an American passport is dropped beside the guidebook...

THE TABLE FAN

swivels, returning towards the guidebook on the bed.

THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

FLIP. FLIP. FLIP. Alex's faint shadow continues moving about the room. The fan head swivels away, allowing the pages to settle... upon a Louvre masterpiece, Francisco de Zurbarans Lying-in-the State of St. Bonaventura.

CAMERA CREEPS IN, teasingly on the dark faced corpse. The pages begin to turn once again.

TIGHTER, OMINOUS ANGLE - THE DESK FAN

There is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels. The boy's figure passes, blocking the breeze.

THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

stop dead on... Jim Morrison's decorated tomb in the Cemetiere du Pere Lachaise. A pilgrim has spray painted "This is the End." Which in fact, it is... of the MAIN TITLE.

CAMERA ADJUSTS, to fully reveal Alex Browning as he turns toward the bedroom door. Alex is an average kid; handsome. A high school "everyman."

One the wall amongst Yankee and Knicks posters, hangs a pennant;

"Mt. Abraham High School, New York. The Fighting Colonials!"

Alex's mother, BARBARA, 45, walks in, excited and a bit anxious.

Barbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack. Alex's father, KEN BROWNING, 48 appears, leaning against the door threshold, smiling enviously at his son.

Alex nods and buckles it. Barbara reaches in to tear off an airline baggage I.D. ticket attached from the previous flight.

EXTREMELY CLOSE - THE AIRLINE BAGGAGE MARKER

is torn away from the suitcase handle.

RETURN

As Barbara picks up the suitcase to place it on the floor... a dozen old baggage I.D. tickets spill from the outer compartment. She looks at Ken, as if "you?" The guilty party shrugs.

Barbara shakes her head as Alex smiles at his dad.

CAMERA INCHES INTO KEN as he winks at his son...

ALEX

CAMERA CREEPS IN as, oddly, the words strike him portentously...

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - LATER

The storm has ceased. The room is QUIET.

As if itself a presence, CAMERA CREEPS across the dark and motionless room TOWARD Alex, sleeping soundly. CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the level of the bed until Alex is in the f.g. and the room is visible behind him.

On the rear wall, the Fighting Colonials pennant begins to flutter slightly, as if affected by the moving breeze. The path of which is continued toward the bed, rustling the sheets, subtly blowing Alex's hair and continuing OVER CAMERA.

Even in his sleep, Alex shivers from the passing cold. His eyes open surprised to be suddenly awakened. He considers for a beat, then looks toward...

THE WINDOWS

which... are closed.

ALEX

puzzled, checks...

THE TABLE FAN

which is off.

ALEX

perplexed, rolls over toward his digital clock. It's 1:00 a.m., however... the middle digit bar in the first zero faintly flickers so this time appears to read... 1:80.

INT. JOHN F. KENNEDY AIRPORT - MORNING - TELEVISION MONITOR

FLIGHT 180 departs 4:25. Gate 39.

CAMERA ADJUSTS FROM the "Arrival-Departure Schedule" to REVEAL forty high school KIDS, four TEACHERS and several PARENTS are gathered inside the International terminal at J.F.K. Several of the students wear Fighting Colonial leterman's jackets or hats and shirts displaying "Mt. Abraham High, New York."

Alex gathers his bags, as does his best friend TOD WAGGNER and his older brother GEORGE WAGGNER, standing before their father, JERRY WAGGNER. For Alex, any psychic tension from the night before seems forgotten in the fun and excitement of the trip.

MR. MURNAU, the French teacher (any further description necessary?) and leader of the class trip waves his arm.

Tod shrugs, "I guess" as he moves to his father and gives him a warm hug goodbye. Mr. Waggner then gives his older son a hug.

Tod and George gives a wave, as does Alex, who is slapped on the back by Mr. Waggner.

The group begins down the airport toward the check-in counter. In the f.g., before the boys, strides a girl, CLEAR RIVERS, 17, reading the TROPIC OF CANCER. The loner in the group, Clear wears dark colors against the insecerity of her sex appeal. She appears aloof and more wordly then the other students.

Readying his ticket and documents, Tod flips open his passport, checking out his photo.

Mr. Murnau stops the group. Excited, he cups an ear with one hand while raising a finger toward the public address system.

Everyone begrudgingly stops to listen.

CARTER HORTON

is the class dickhead who mix and matches his role models in the most superficial manner. His hand is tucked into his girlfriend, TERRY CHANEY'S, waistband...

Terry, hot now, but with no idea what time will do to her in just five years, smiles obsequiously and mouths "shh."

Mr. Murnau scans the group, his expression looking for an answer. Clear Rivers keeps her head in her book as...

She doesn't react. Her expression remains cool as Murnau leads the

procession forward. The boys continue. Alex sighs...

A hand reaches out to gently detain Alex. He looks up to find a HARE KRISHANA, dressed in everyday clothes, but head shaved and a mark on his nose.

CAMARA PUSHES IN ON ALEX... unsettled by the soft spoken, yet ominous, "Solicitation." The Krishana offers a small book, REALITY BEYOND THE MATTER: VAISHNAVA PHILOSOPHY.

As he hands the book to Alex, a female form ENTERS FRAME between them. The women is MISS VALERIE LEWTON, 30, a feisty English teacher whose figure inspires all the boys' fantasies.

She places a hand on Alex's shoulder, herding him to the group.

Ms. Lewton turns and, while walking backward, flashes a smile...

As she turns her back and continues down the terminal...

INT. CHECK IN DESK - AIRPORT - DAY

Alex's passport and ticket are set INTO FRAME and picked up by a female TICKET CLERK. Alex waits as she busily types into the computer and checks his passport...

O.S., LOUD, EXAGGERATED plastic tiles rapidly CLICK and CLACK.

The CLACKING CONTINUES, demading Alex's attention. His eyes turn forward.

ALEX'S POV - THE FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

Plastic tabs CLACK rapidly, settling on the word... "CANCELLED."

ALEX

CAMARA CREEPS IN on his dawning paranoia...

Alex absently nods. Again, O.S., CLACK CLACK CLACK. His eyes move to...

ALEX'S POV - (TIGHTER) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

The plastic tabs FLIP and CLACK rapidly, stopping on... "DEPARTED."

TICKET DESK

Alex is still considering the "messages..."

Alex quickly runs the day through his head and flashes her the REALITY BEYOND MATTER book. She smiles, then leans over toward the baggage scales. Alex's eyes turn toward...

CLOSE - (MOTION SLOWED)- ALEX'S LUGGAGE

a new airline I.D. marker is attached to his bag.

RETURN

Alex eyes the new tag hoping it's "good luck." As the clerk returns his ticket and passport... CLACK, CLACK, CLACK.

Alex is puzzeled by the comment. He shakes his head if, "pardon me?" CAMERA INCHES INTO the ticket clerk gesturing pleasantly to the passport and ticket...

CLACK. CLACK. CLACK. Alex's eyes flash toward...

ALEX'S POV - (FULL FRAME) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

the title settles upon... "TERMINAL."

INT.  SECURITY AREA - AIRPORT - MONITOR

The ghastly green and reds of the X-ray monitors flash as carry on bags flash through the machine. CAMERA MOVES COUNTER to the direction of the conveyor belt. The pace and excitement of the collective group escalates as departure approaches.

Carter Horton and his girlfriend, Terry, take cuts in line with smug, bullying expressions. Unseen by the chaperones, no student, has the nerve to protest Carter's action. Alex, Tod, George and BILLY HITCHCOCK, heavyset with a New York Rangers jersey watches Carter and Terry with disgust.

Excited, Tod speaks in a convert tone over Alex's shoulder.

Alex looks up ahead of the metal detectors...

ALEX'S POV - TWO GIRLS

Attractive and they know it, CHRISTA MARSH and BLAKE DREYER appear clearly out of Alex and Tod's league.

ALEX AND TOD

The boys dump their change in a plastic bowl.

As Alex and Tod pass through the metal detector, their eyes performing reconnaissance on Christa and Blake, the opening drum BLASTS of Boingo's "No One Lives Forever" OVERLAPS...

INT. AIRLINE GATE - AIRPORT - AFTERNOON - CLOSE - GATE 39

CAMERA ADJUSTS from the sign indicating GATE 39. The class is squirrely and  excited. Mr. Murnau, Ms. Lewton, and the parent chaperones are allowing kids to burn off steam at the gate, hoping for a calm flight.

CAMERA MOVES ALONG the awaiting passengers... Carter and Terry are making out, a step away from heavy petting...

Blake and Christa are flipping through Parisian fashion magizines... Billy Hitchcock lays into a Burrito Supreme...

CAMERA MOVES to an empty seat. Clear Rivers ENTERS FRAME and sits,

struggling with her Walkman, coffee, books, and a cassette box handmarked "Boingo" (a cheat that We hear the song)

As she places her stuff on the unoccupied seat beside her, a Paris guidebook falls on the floor, opened but face down. A passing, unidentified, student reaches down and hands her the book, still open and face down.

The student continues down toward the observation deck. Clear looks at the opened guidebook.

CLEAR'S POV - GUIDEBOOK

Princess Di's Mercedes is totaled in a Paris tunnel. Besides the photo are two portraits of Diana and Dodi Al Fayed.

CLEAR

CAMERA INCHES IN as she shakes off a shiver down her spine. She looks up from the book toward the student who handed it to her, the identity of which is fully REVEALED to be Alex Browning.

He stands at the gate window, looking out at the plane.

ALEX'S POV - 747

It is raining. In the distance, MUFFLED THUNDER RUMBLES.

CAMERA CREEPS AWAY from the plane... huge, seemingly incapable of flight and yet we unquestioningly trust our lives in this machine. Emotionless. Cold. Lifeless, and yet soon full of life.

ALEX

CAMERA inches in on him.

Tod MOVES INTO FRAME beside Alex...

Alex takes a beat to consider...

INT. MEN'S ROOM - AIRPORT - OVERHEAD

CAMERA LOOKS DOWN on two stalls. Alex sits in one, Tod sits in the other. O.S., OVER the airports P.A. SYSTEM John Denver's "Rocky Mountain High" begins...

Upon the mention, CAMERA CRANES DOWN, TURNING, TWISTING UNTIL FINDING ALEX in a straight on CLOSE-UP. He listens, tense...

A P.A. ANNOUNCMENT breaks into the song...

Really for the first time, Alex appears a bit tentative and pale. It is intensified by the return of the song...

INT. BOARDING AREA - GATE 39 - CLOSE - ALEX'S BOARDING PASS

is torn along the perforated edge and handed back.

ALEX

looks down the paasenger ramp.

ALEX'S POV - RAMP TUNNEL

CAMERA CREEPS toward it... lit to cheat a feeling of no return.

O.S., distant THUNDER RUMBLES...

WIDER

There is something more emotionally tense about the moment of boarding than take-off. CAMERA PICKS UP Ms. Lewton searching...

Tod nudges Alex toward the tunnel, the three boys start down the ramp, passing Mr. Murnau who checks his list, counting heads...

PASSENGER RAMP

Alex, Tod, and George catch up to Christa and Blake, excited. As always, everyone becomes bottlenecked just at the point of entering the plane. Alex looks out the ramp's side porthole window toward the back of the plane.

ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PORTHOLE

The enormous engine. The expansive wings. Behind the tail, distant, a bolt of lightning FLASHES!

ALEX

looks away. Just ahead, in the plane, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS greet the

passengers. He is next to enter the plane.

CLOSE - FLOOR

a slice of opening from where the ramp meets the plane provides a sense of how high up one actually stands.

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES INTO HIM as he takes his first step into the plane.

CLOSE - AIRLINE CABIN FLOOR

Alex's Nikes land on the carpet.

INT. 747 - FIRST CLASS CABIN - AFTERNOON - CLOSE - BABY

SCREAMS! Its parents desperately comfort the child.

CAMERA ADJUSTS, LEADING George, Alex and Tod through the aisles. Alex and Tod wince at the screaming child. George, however feels comforted.

INT. ECONOMY CLASS CABIN - 747 - AFTERNOON

In the first row slumps a young man with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. A cannula is set in his nostrils leading to an oxygon tank beside him.

The kids sneak sympathetic yet anxious glances at the man while continuing in their seats. George whispers over his shoulder...

Alex's tension increases as he continues up the aisle.

ALEX'S POV - OVERHEAD COMPARTMENTS

CAMERA INCHES IN ON "Row 25. Seats H, I, and J."

ALEX

climbs into the row, carrying his backpack. He takes his window seat and reaches up to the air flow valve.

CLOSE - AIR FLOW VALVE

turns, HISSING, air streaming full blast.

CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as he takes in deep breaths of the stale air. He presses his face to the window.

ALEX'S POV - THE LEFT WING

Rain falls. GEARS WHIR as the ailerons are tested.

CLOSE - ALEX

CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD HIM, face to the glass; eyes scanning the plane and outside area.

He turns toward the aisle.

ALEX'S POV - CHRISTA AND BLAKE

Man, they look great and they're workin' the sex appeal.

ALEX

sneaks a quick check with Tod.

ALEX'S POV - TOD

shakes his head. "NO! NO! DON'T DO IT."

ALEX AND THE GIRLS

He looks to them and knows he is just plain overmatched. Alex shrugs, "Sure." In front of him Tod throws up his arms, disgusted. Alex climbs out of his seats. The girls are touchy-feely thankful, but only know guys dig that.

Alex crames up into the aisles, making his way to Tod, sitting two rows up in 22 H.

Alex climbs over Tod to take the window seat. Clear Rivers sits in the seat directly behind Alex.

As Alex sits, the tray table falls from its upright position.

He lifts the tray back up, but as he turns the latch, it BREAKS OFF in his hand. He briefly tries to jimmie the tray into postition, then gives up.

CAMERA FOLLOWS ALEX'S HAND as it rises. CAMERA SWEEPS IN EXTREAMLY CLOSE to the ATTENDANT CALL BUTTON. As Alex's finger engages the button, it lights up orange.

ALEX

The jet lurches. He looks...

OUT OF THE WINDOW - ALEX'S POV

The 747 begins rolling out of the gate.

ALEX

As he looks back, searching for the nearst flight attendant...

ALEX'S POV - THROUGH THE SEATS - CLEAR RIVERS

reads her book. Another leans to look out the window.

ALEX

lifts a bit out of his seat, searching for any flight attendant O.S., A PING.

Looking fore in the cabin...

ALEX'S POV - NEAR THE FLIGHT DECK

The flight attendants strap themselves in for take-off.

ALEX

O.S., the ENGINE VOLUME INCREASES in PITCH and INTENSITY as the jet begins to taxi. Alex sits back as the tray over his lap. He looks out the window.

ALEX'S POV - THE RIGHT WING

appears motionless in the f.g. as the tarmac and runway signs roll past the window. THE ENGINE PITCH RISES...

ALEX

The ENGINES WHIR as the jet gathers SPEED. He checks the window.

ALEX'S POV- THE RUNWAY

is a blur. The airport terminals in the b.g. streak past. The wings lift, angled as the jet leaves the ground.

ALEX

O.S., his classmates CHEER and "raise the roof." The trip has begun.

CAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM ALEX, as if reflecting his easing of annoyance with the tray situation. He finally appears to notice the raucous reaction and settles back in his seat, slightly pushed by mild-g force. The upwarding angle increasing...

The cabin buffets, as if passing mild turbulance. Then...

The cabin sharply JOLTS! Everyone tenses, GASPS. CAMERA SWEEPS BACK TO ALEX. And just as he clenches his backpack... the cabin BANGS, ROCKS. THE ENGINES SPOOL TO A STALL. METAL TWISTS under extreme PRESSURE. The cabin dips, angles, sharply to the right.

ALEX'S POV - THE CABIN

Passengers SCREAM! Unrestrained personal belongings fly across the aircraft INTO CAMERA, which BUFFETS and SHAKES...

OXYGEN MASKS

deploy from the overhead compartments. A prerecorded message, like that recorded by the black box of the crash of JAL# 123 August 12, 1985, BLARES over the P.A., with erie calm...

ALEX

his hand trembles as he reaches for the oxygen mask and places it over his face. The ENGINES resuscitate. SCREAMING. WHINING. Alex checks out his window.

ALEX'S POV - OUT OF WINDOW

The plane is on its side, losing altitude. A slow, sick spin.

ALEX

breaths deep into his oxygen cup.

The JET ENGINES GRIND AND WHIR, as if the craft were in the midst of a last-ditch effort to regain stability; the sounds DEAFENING over the PASSENGERS' cruelly hopeless SCREAMS.

Then...

KA-BOOM

A DEVASTATING EXPLOSION ERUPTS across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds.

Dead students sit lifeless in their seats.

Every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. A PARENT and a STUDENT clutch their seat in terror, SCREAMING before they are pulled into the sky.

Wind. Screams. Dying engines, a deafening blare.

ALEX AND TOD

SCREAM, pale, knowing there is no hope, no escape as the ENGINES DIE. The cabin begins to tilt downwards... then straight down. Debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff.

OUTSIDE... the sick familiar SOUND of an aircraft going down.

ALEX is strapped to his seat, upper body facing downward toward the water. FIRE, WIND, AND BLOOD WHIP across him. A BUILDING WHINE CRESCENDOES before a second EXPLOSION RIPS ACROSS FRAME...

CLOSE - ALEX'S TERRIFIED EYES

dilating rapidly, as the shock of what appears to be happening before him washes over his very psyche.

ALEX

Drenched with sweat, trembling in his seat, his eyes dart toward Christa and Blake. They look great and they're workin' the sex appeal.

Alex turns sickeningly disoriented. His eyes dart about, searching for evidnece of the catastrophe. There are none to be found. Alex blots from his seat, startling the two girls. He scrambles toward Tod, who looks at his friend, concerned.

Frenzied, Alex climbs over his friend, on top of the seat. Alex's panic has alerted the other students and a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT who makes his way to the row.

ALEX

grabs the tray table latch before the vacent seat. IT BREAKS OFF, JUST AS BEFORE. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, terrified. He begins to hyperventilate.

Alex's wild eyes and expression convey "no fucking kidding there's a problem." The flight attendant realizes this passenger is experiencing a serious episode.

Directly across the aisle, Carter Horton and Terry look at him with severe expressions.

Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton unfasten their seat belts and rush toward Alex.

Obviously, no one ever wants to ever hear that. The students tense.

THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT

immediately turns to other attendants, signaling for assistance with a quick definite gesture. In the b.g., attendants hustle toward the economy class cabin.

CARTER AND TERRY

ALEX

frenzied, begins moving toward the aisle.

This frightens everyone. Not the "prophecy," but his panicky, irrational behavior.

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER, hearing Alex's declaration.

RETURN

Alex is desperately climbing over Tod, who is trying to calmly restrain his friend. Across the aisle, Carter Horton stands ready to quiet Alex, with force.

The flight attendant restrains Carter with an extended forearm.

Ms. Lewton and Mr. Murnau move to the seats. Flight attendants try

restraining Alex from reaching the aisle.

Carter reaches for Alex, who pushes back, trying to get out. Carter responds aggressivly and now the flight attendant, Tod, and the two teachers are in the midst of the melee.

The Co-Pilot arrives to secure the situation. He grabs Alex and begins forcibly ushering him up the aisle.

A male flight attendant choke holds Carter from the back. Carter struggles but the attendant's postioning has the advantage. He begins removing Carter from the plane as well.

She follows the attendant, hitting him to help her boyfriend.

Just arriving in the cabin, Billy Hitchcock tries to fight past a

STEWARDESS to get to his seat. He is blocked by the mass of combatants as they are escorted out.

Under protest, Billy gets pushed back off the plane. Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton follow the pack of students and airline personnel as they move toward the exit, calling out to seated teachers and parents while hustling up the aisles.

Tod watches, amazed and concerned for his friend. He looks across the cabin to...

TOD'S POV - GEORGE

his brother gestures, mouths... "you should go with him."

TOD

starts off down the aisles. CAMERA COUNTERS... ADJUSTING TO CLEAR RIVERS. Amongst the chaos, she considers for a beat, then grabs her backpack, stands and moves into the aisle to exit the plane.

INT. BOARDING AREA/TUNNEL - GATE 39 - DAY

Alex, the co-pilot, Carter, the attendant, Mr. Murnau, Ms, Lewton, Terry, Tod and Billy proceed down the tunnel. Billy is confused by the chaos.

Arriving SECURITY OFFICERS quickly have control of the situation. Alex is taken to a seat at the gate and dropped there by the co-pilot, who, winded, eyes the officers.

The officers nod. One moves toward Carter as he dropped in a seat away from Alex. Terry sits behind Carter.

The co-pilot and attendants start back toward the plane. Ms. Lewton hustles over to them and an airline representitive.

During these negotiations... CAMERA MOVES PAST Ms. Lewton and the Co-Pilot to the boarding ramp door...

Clear Rivers exits and takes a seat away from the others, aware she is unnoticed in the confusion. CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up toward...

ALEX

CAMERA MATCHES THE MOVE TO HIM AS TOD and Mr. Murnau attempt to calm him down.

Rattled, Alex attempts to compose himself. Ms. Lewton appears, hurriedly pulling aside Mr. Murnau.

Murnau understands this point and takes off toward the boarding ramp door. Pleading his case, Billy follows Murnau.

Hustling toward the door. Mr. Murnau gestures toward Ms. Lewton as if "talk to her." He disappears down the ramp. CAMERA PUSHES IN as airline personnel CLOSE THE DOOR...with an ominous THUD.

EXT. GATE 39 - AFTERNOON - CARTER, TERRY & BILLY'S POV

Flight 180 pulls out of the gate, taxiing toward the runway.

INT. GATE 39 - OBSERVATION WINDOW - AFTERNOON

Carter turns over his shoulder, looking back angrily towards Alex. Terry wraps a calming/restraining arm around Carter's shoulder, but he starts towards Alex, seated with Ms. Lewton.

MENS ROOM ACROSS FROM GATE 39

Tod races out of the bathroom with a dampened paper towel. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he hands it to Ms. Lewton seated next to Alex. The teacher places it on Alex's forehead.

Alex looks at Tod, who nods. His friend's expression is soothing and open. With lowered tense tone, meant for only the two people beside him...

Ms. Lewton and Tod exchange concered glances.

Good point. Alex looks away.

A raw nerve, Alex stands.

Carter scoffs while moving aggressively toward Alex.

Carter makes a quick move and grabs Alex. The two security guards rush in to break it up. Chaos erupts agian as the two boys wrestle in the terminal.

OBSERVATION DECK

CAMERA PUSHES INTO Billy Hitchcock, depressed as he watches the plane take off...

AIRPORT TERMINAL

One guard restrains Alex; another Carter. In the b.g. out of the observation deck window... Flight 180 lifts off the runway.

In the b.g. the 747 head and taillights suddenly, violently, ERUPT into a gigantic fireball of flame.

It takes a few seconds for the CONCUSSION to hit the terminal, but when it does... BOOM! A window SHATTERS! Chairs rock! People are knocked off their feet.

CAMERA SWEEPS INTO ALEX... stunned as he turns to the window...

ALEX'S POV - FLIGHT 180

The unceremonious speed of obliteration of hundreds of lives is cruel as flaming debris plummets from the early evening sky.

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, rattled, afraid, but aware of Alex as she is first to turn her eyes toward him.

GATE 39

Billy Hitchcock walks backward from the window, shocked by shocked step. Ms. Lewton drops to her chair as her legs give out.

O.S., ALARMS BEGIN. The two security guards tear off toward more urgent duties. O.S., OUTSIDE, SIRENS WAIL as emergency vehicles race to the tragedy.

CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE toward ALEX... as Tod's head turns toward him, then Terry's... then Carter's. In the chair, beginning to cry, Ms. Lewton eyes Alex, as if afraid of him.

CAMERA CONTINUES. SIRENS PIERCING. The emergency vehicles' strobing red lights reflect in Alex's eyes, now in TIGHT as he looks out, frozen with shock... upon the doomed FLIGHT 180.

INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT

SILENCE

A pair of Airline REPRESENTATIVES sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock. Everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion. They sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights. Beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe... each feels uneasy by Alex's presance.

The others sit away from Alex and Tod. Alex appears wrought with guilt. He checks the others out of the corner of his eye.

ALEX'S POV - THE ROOM

Ms. Lewton, Carter and Billy glare at Alex. Terry averts her eyes from Alex to bury her face in Carter's shoulder.

ALEX

frightened as anyone over what has happened, tenses, defensive and scared. With softspoken strength...

LEWTON, CARTER, TERRY, AND BILLY

maintain their uncertain expressions. With strained apprehansion, as if not wanting to "dabble in the occult," but needing an immediate answer.

WIDER

Alex is taken aback by the question, yet even his best friend looks at him for an answer.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Alex, relieved and thankful, as he turns to her...

CLEAR RIVERS - ALEX'S POV

CAMERA MATCHES the move INTO HER as she looks up at Alex, not with fear or repulsion... but with knowledge of an unwanted but irrefutable connection.

WIDER

Causing a startle, the DOOR OPENS. Everyone's head whips reflexively toward the entrance. The strange event of the flickering lights is quickly forgotten.

A half dozen MEN and WOMEN enter the room, displaying official badges and passes. All but two are dressed in casual clothing, having been called in from home; the pair being F.B.I. Special Agents WEINE and SCHRECK. HOWARD SEIGEL and DON HAWKS are representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board. EILEEN WHALE and JACK ARNOLD are members of the Euro-Air "Trauma Team."

The officials are sympathetic and calm, exuding the confidence and security trauma victims look for at this time.

Although the words are comforting, being in the position of having to hear them macabre. Ms. Lewton reacts, snapping...

Seigel is calm, yet honest... carefully honest.

He gestures... "and that's all we know." The group slips deeper into despair.

The survivors dread the thought of recounting the horrible experience, yet collectively are ready to co-operate.

The agents, F.B.I. badges displayed in their pockets, turn their eyes, suspicioulsy, toward Alex.

ALEX

reacts, puzzled, as he realizes the Agents are focused on him...

INT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - CLOSE - SCHRECK & WEINE

are direct and professional, with no hidden agenda in searching for the truth. Seigel and Hawks from the NTSB are behind them taking notes...

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he looks up, nervous... not about suspicion toward him, but trying to explain what even he doesn't understand.

Tears well as he grows frustrated trying to convey the unique experience. Being trained, veteran officers, Schreck and Weine obsereve; allow him to talk.

The officers remain quiet, gauging his explanation.

The officers study him, unsure yet carefully...

Alex looks up, stunned. He didn't even recall this until now.

He considers, owing them an explanation. The he realizes...

Weine leans foward...

CAMERA INCHES IN as Alex considers, confused, emotional...

INT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - TOD

CAMERA CONTINUES THE MOVE on Tod... as if just realizing...

INT. A SECOND ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - MS. LEWTON

displaying a similar sickened expression as Tod...

INT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - WEINE

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up. With total resolve...

INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL BUILDING - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT

The surviviors have all returned to the room. They may be a group, but they are alone with their thoughts. The door is opened by Ms. Whale.

Alex's Mother and Father lead by a group of parents into the room. Each moves with grief, yet relief, to their child.

Barbara Browning grabs hold of Alex and holds him tight. The mother begins to cry. Ken Browning, eyes welling with tears, grabs his son's hand and squeezes. Alex does not cry. While holding his mother, he watches the others.

ALEX'S POV - CARTER AND TERRY

Their parents are concerned, but do not demonstratively show affection. Carter appears as if he wants to hug his MOTHER, but he can't bring himself to betray his self-image.

ALEX

his eyes moves toward...

CLEAR RIVERS

alone, hurt that no one has come to take her home.

ALEX

his eyes find...

TOD AND HIS FATHER

JERRY WAGGNER holds his son, both of them releasing anguished tears. Through his grief, however, Jerry stares at Alex with an expression of anger and accusation.

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he holds his mother tightly. OVERLAPPING... A CRACK OF THUNDER!

INT. KEN BROWNING'S CAR - NIGHT

Alex sits in the back against the door, looking out the window at the storm. Clear Rivers is pressed against the other door. Everyone is slient. Outside, the STORM angrily rages.

Alex is unaware that Clear is watching him, searching for some answer that she will not now find. She looks up.

The car pulls over.

She opens the door and flashes one more look at Alex, but he appears unaware. She exits the car and as the door SHUTS...

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is empty, but the CAMERA is SLOWLY MOVING, as if ITSELF a PRESENCE. O.S., FOOTSTEPS move up the stairs. Alex appears, his parents behind him. He clicks on the light, sending a soft, safe, orange glow across the room.

ALEX

stands in the threshold of the doorway. His mother places a comforting hand on his shoulder.

ALEX'S POV - PENNANT

Mt. Abraham High School Fighting Colonials.

ALEX

and now, the tears arrive. He begins crying, SOBBING, as his mother and father hold him. O.S., OUTSIDE... lighting FLASHES... THUNDER RUMBLES...

INT. LIVING ROOM - BROWNING HOUSE - NIGHT - TV

CNN broadcasts video footage of the disaster. Seat cushions and personal belongings float in the harsh floodlights.

LIVING ROOM

It is late and dark. Only the pale light of the TV spills across the living room. Ken and Barbara have fellen asleep, but their son remains awake.

Alex's red eyes are locked on the screen, mortified. O.S., a VICIOUS CRACK of LIGHTNING and immediate THUNDER... as if calling Alex to the window. He remains fixed on the TV.

ALEX'S POV - TV

An image of Hell as jet fuel burns on the ocean. O.S., as if furious at the slight, THUNDER BANGS...

ALEX

He turns, stands... and moves to the picture window, pulling the curtains aside as CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM...

ALEX'S POV - THE STORM

It is as if Nature is angry. Lightning BOLTS spiderweb across the sky. THUNDER BOOMS.

A shard of lightning breaks across the front yard. Oddly, it does not make contact. In the split-second strobe of lightning flash, the bolt abstractly appears as if it were a hand pointing directly at Alex.

ALEX

horrified, lurches away from the window, considering what he has seen. Just felt on the ROAR OF THUNDER...

Over black:

FADE IN:

EXT. MT. ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - CLOSE - ALEX

wearing a dark suit and tie, sits beside his parents on white folded chairs. His head is bowed, guilty and sad...

Alex raises his eyes and looks across the ceremony...

ALEX'S POV - TOD

sits with his mother, LINDA WAGGNER and his father, Jerry. Destraught, Jerry stares off blankly at the minister.

ALEX

guiltily averts his eyes. Ken notes this and wraps a comforting arm around his son.

Alex checks over his shoulder.

ALEX'S POV - OVER HIS SHOULDER - LAST ROW OF SEATS

Special agents Schreck and Weine subtly survey the area, taking notes. Although their eyes are beyond sunglasses, the tilt of their head indicates they are watching Alex.

ALEX

turns away, tense. He looks at the minister.

CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, feeling eyes upon them. He looks up...

ALEX'S POV - CLEAR RIVERS

is actually sexy and a bit scandalous in her black dress. Still, she is off by herself, eyes burning at Alex as if challenging him to challenge the words being spoken.

ALEX

self-consciously turns away, unable to face her, let alone the words being spoken.

WIDER

A student with a guitar and harmonica stands at the microphone. Without introduction, he begins Neil Young's "Long May You Run."

Two other students remove a cloth, unveiling a memorial sculpture etched with the names of the departed. The gathered stand and begin paying their respects to the memorial.

MEMORIAL LINE

Carter and Terry appear IN FRAME. Terry holds a rose. As they move slowly up toward the memorial, Alex gets in line behind them. Carter knows Alex is there, but will not look at him.

Alex winces from Carter's breath...

Carter has an angry reflexive reaction, grabbing Alex threateningly by the forearm. Terry immediately tries to get Carter to release his hold.

Carter and Alex lock eyes, Alex refraining from showing any pain caused by Carter's grip. Terry finally gets him to release.

He moves off. Terry, however, holds a beat, eyes Alex and gently rubs the area of his arm, as if this is the only manner she can extend her gratitiude in Carter's presence. As Alex pats her arm, Terry quickly moves off.

Shaken, Alex considers whether to move foward to the memorial. He steps aside to let the others go ahead as Billy Hitchcock, who has finished paying his respects, spots Alex and heads back up the line.

Alex turns to him, increudlously..

Billy sighs, and moves OUT OF FRAME, only to quickly RE-ENTER...

Alex flashes Billy an angry glare. He gets the message and moves off, for good. Alex returns in line, moving toward the memorial.

Valerie Lewton places a rose at the base of the memorial then studies the engraved names as the students move past behind her. Alex approaches, watching her as she reaches out with a trembling finger, touching the etched names...

CLOSE - MEMORIAL

Linda Krauss... Thomas Lewis... John McConnell.

RETURN

Alex stands near her, sympathetically, understanding her pain....

Her eyes fill with tears and fear. Alex places a comforting hand on her shoulder, but she reacts quickly, pulling away from him, her eyes piercing at him.

Alex is shattered as the teacher moves away. Tod ENTERS and faces the memorial.

Alex notices Tod is in line behind him. Alex looks around for Tod's father. He is not in line...

Tod subtly nods, reaching out to the memorial.

CLOSE - MEMORIAL

Tod's hand moves across his brother's name... GEORGE WAGGNER.

RETURN

As Tod longs for his brother, then looks at his friend.

Tod nods. The two friends stand uncomfortably foar a beat before Tod gestures to the podium.

Tod holds his friend's arm for strength as he passes. Clear Rivers appears in line, holding a rose. She looks at the memorial, before her startling eyes turn to Alex. Even away from these circumstances, Alex would have trouble handling her intense maturity. As he begins to step away, she thrusts the rose to him. He looks up, puzzled.

Alex takes the rose and she walks away. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he eyes... feels... the red flower.

EXT. MT ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - THE PODIUM

Tod nervously stands before the assembly, reading aloud with a sad, yet optimistic resolve. CAMERA PUSHES IN, at an ominous ANGLE and rhythm, to the podium.

As he speaks, the sunlight suddenly turns to shadow.

ALEX

looks up at the sky...

THE SKY - ALEX'S POV

Within the deep blue, a single black cloud blocks the sun.

ALEX

CAMERA INCHES IN as, troubled, he looks back to Tod...

TOD

as he continues to read...

EXT. WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

Storm clouds devour a waxing crescent moon above a modest home set amongst the edge of the woods.

INT. LIVING ROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT

A lone light glows. Jerry Waggner has fallen asleep, perhaps passed out, reclined in "dad's chair." Tod's mother is asleep on the sofa, balls of tissue on the floor. Tod enters the room and stares sadly at his parents...

Tod picks up a glass and swigs the remainder of his father's scotch before moving off and climbing the stairs.

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE - TABLE FAN

swivels as it distributes its breeze.

ALEX

sits at his desk, dark circles beneath his eyes. Swamping the desk are printouts of Internet Web pages and newspaper articles concerning the crash of Flight 180, forensic engineering textbooks, NTSB reports on past airline disasters and... REALITY BEYOND MATTER: Vaishnava Philosophy.

Alex studies his mountain of research, increasingly obsessed.

An O.S. paper FLUTTER draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan. He reaches out and grabs it. Headlines and photos report on the memorial service.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he sighs, troubled...

ALEX'S POV - NEWSPHOTO

Clear Rivers sits in her seat, legs crossed, alluring and sexy and

mysterious.

ALEX

closes the paper, puzzled by his reaction. He shakes it off and throws the paper on the desk. Alex considers for a beat, then pulls open a lower drawer. Digging through the mess inside, he finds his stash... the April 1997 issue of Penthouse.

INT. BATHROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT

Alight CLICKS on REVEALING an old, '20's built bathroom. The toilet is beside the bathtub/shower, with just enough knee space to the counter cabinets when one lifts the toilet seat.

Tod puts the lid down and UNSNAPS his jeans. As he turns, pulls his pants down and sits, CAMERA MOVES to the CURTAINS... still... until a cold soft breeze causes them to billow. CAMERA FOLLOWS the wind as it CONTINUES into the room, rippling across shower curtains.

As the breeze passes Tod, he pauses... as if sensing, but not

understanding... this is more than a wayward autumn breeze. He moves to close the window, however, CAMERA CONTINUES as the air makes ITS way to the door.

The door is softly pushed closed by the breeze.

BACK OF THE TOILET TANK

Tod sits, back to CAMERA, which CRANES DOWN the tank, STOPPING behind the locking nut and water line pipe.

As the toilet FLUSHES O.S., CAMERA NOW MOVES INTO the locking nut, which begins to slightly rattle. Drips of water stream from the tank onto the floor.

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Alex flips the magazine open to a centerfold.

PENTHOUSE PICTORIAL

The model's pose and expression tempt Alex towards the momentary respite form his troubles. The caption beneath the centerfold pictorial reads, "Tymme Has Come Today!"

ALEX

considers the reports on the Flight 180 crash, then returns his attention to the magazine. He unzips his pants, then pauses... his eyes returning hesitantly to the newspaper photo of Clear...

INT. BATHROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT- CLOSE- RAZOR BLADE

waits on the counter. CAMERA PULLS AWAY as Tod picks it up. He looks at his face in the mirror, as if behind him... a black indiscernible form, like a shadow, however, actually a presence incapable of reflecting light.

Tod whips around...

a puddle forms, creeping toward the heel of Tod's stocking feet.

TOD

turns on the faucet and grabs his toothbrush, squeezing paste onto the bristles.

CLOSE - FAUCET

the f.g. running water is out of FOCUS. In the b.g. sits an unplugged radio.

TOD

notes the radio. CAMERA FLLOWS HIS HAND as he grabs the plug.

THE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR

grows closer to his foot...

ELECTRICAL SOCKET

the radio plug is inserted.

TOD

turns on the radio...

spooked, quickly turns it off, unplugs it and pushes it aside.

THE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR

continues to grow...

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - NEWSPHOTO - CLEAR RIVERS

Odd how one can appear so erotic at a funeral.

ALEX

studies the photograph, then notices the rose she gave him. Succumbing to guilt, feeling like the freak all teenagers believe they are, Alex sets the paper back on the desk. He grabs the Penthouse and turns, opening the desk drawer in order to return the magazine, however...

A LOUD BANG turns Alex's head to the window!

ALEX'S POV - WINDOW

An OWL has apparently smashed into the window, awkwardly flapping its large wings, then turns its head toward Alex, large yellow eyes shining like an alien creature.

WIDER

Startled, Alex reflexively throws the Penthouse across the room, pages tearing as it hits the sill. The giant bird flies off.

THE TABLE FAN

swivels, a page catching in the whirling blades.

A PIECE OF PAPER

torn form the magazine flits across the room.

ALEX

CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as the piece of paper ENTERS FRAME, floating and flitting until landing on his knee. He picks it up and turns it over...

ALEX'S POV - PIECE OF PAPER

is torn in such a manner that the only lettlers remaining from the

centerfold's caption are "...Tod..."

INT. BATHROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT - SHOWER CURTAIN

is pulled aside REVEALING two pairs of Linda Waggner's nylons drying on a retractable clothesline.

THE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR

his foot slips...

TOD

falls foward.

THE RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE

retracts! WHIPPING wildly!

THE SOAP DISH

Tod's hand tries to grab anything to hold him. His hand slips, knocking over a bottle of shampoo.

TOD'S NECK

the thin clothesline coils around his neck. The plastic anchor wraps beneath the cord, essentially creating a noose.

PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR

He slips again.

TOD

falls against the back wall of the shower stall, pulled by the retracting wire. He kicks with his feet, desperately trying to gain a footing.

SHOWER HEAD - TOD'S POV

BATHTUB

Tod's feet slip in the slick shampoo and water.

CLOSE - TOD'S EYES

THE BATHROOM DOOR

INT. LIVING ROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT

Tod's parents remain asleep. O.S., a FAINT MUFFLE can be HEARD.

INT. BATHROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE - TOD'S NECK

his hands tear at his flesh, desperately trying to pull the cord from his neck.

TOD'S EYES

dart desperately toward the counter.

ON THE COUNTER

a pair of nose-hair scissors.

TOD

CHOCKING, GASPING, face turning purple, reaches for the counter.

ON THE COUNTER

Tod's hand ENTER FRAME. The scissors, sadistically just out of reach.

TOD'S FACE

FALLS INTO FRAME, suspended by the cord, propped against the back wall of the shower stall, his bluish purple tongue grotesquely juts from his mouth.

TOD'S POV - DEATH

all four edges of FRAME appear to collapse as if by weight of the darkness until forming a myopic center. Then, from within the center... appears Tod's face. Although the expression is serene the pallor is grayish, until... suddnely, shockingly... Tod's face decays, as if ten years of rot in the grave is compressed into 72 FRAMES.

TOD

The moment of realization...

HIS FEET

kick upon the slippery basin. After a beat... they stop.

TOD

As his body settles... dies... CAMERA PULLS AWAY fully revealing his lifeless form. Once behind the toilet tank, CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the floor. The water eerily retreats from the floor, slipping back toward the base of the toilet and like a murderer, slips out of the night.

EXT. WAGGNER HOUSE - LATER - CLOSE - SIREN LIGHTS

whirl and flash INTO CAMERA. CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ADJUSTING to REVEAL a Paramedics vehicle, a Sullivan County, N.Y. Sheriff's patrol car and unmarked sedan.

CAMERA CONTINUES MOVING UNTIL REVEALING Alex Browning racing down the sidewalk. He runs into a CLOSE-UP, sweating, out of breath, expression horrified as he takes in the scene before him.

SPECIAL AGENTS SCHRECK AND WEINE

stand in the front yard. Schreck subtly redirects Weine's attention toward...

ALEX - SPECIAL AGENT'S POV

The boy franically moves to a paramedic.

SCHRECK AND WEINE

hearing this, they turn to one another, with an expression suggesting a deepening suspicion.

ALEX

sees the officers. Assuming they are sympathetic to his concern, he starts toward them, until...

Alex stops, looks around. Behind the tree and in the shadows of the adjacent house, stands Clear Rivers.

CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, stunned, but before he can ask any further questions, a METALLIC CLACKING draws his attention back toward the house.

ALEX'S POV - A COVERED GURNEY

is rolled out of the front door by paramedics and an official with a jacket marked "CORONER," Behind the body follows Tod's father. He pauses in the doorway as he spots Alex in the front yard.

ALEX

is pale, nauseous. His eyes follow his friend's dead body as it is rolled toward the paramedics vehicle. Tod's father approaches Alex, the agents stand nearby.

Mr. Waggner glares at Alex, accusingly.

Alex is stung, guilty. He averts his eyes. Schreck and Weine note this reaction.

Alex remains silent, hurt.

Alex is stunned, defensive.

Mr. Waggner turns toward the paramedics van, as if "there's the proof."

Alex is rocked as if having taken a punch to the face. Mr. Waggner begins to walk toward the peramedics vehicle. Alex eyes the F.B.I. agents, who, after studying for a beat, turn and move toward their vehicle.

The gathered spectators begin whispering to one another, clearly about Alex, causing him to search for, what appears to be, his only ally, Clear Rivers.

ALEX'S POV - ADJACENT YARD

Clear is gone.

FRONT YARD

everyone has moved away from Alex, leaving him very alone. Alex's eyes remained locked on the peramedics' vehicle. As the ambulance doors CLOSE on the body of his best friend...

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE - LEAVES ON TREES

A soft summer breeze passes through the leaves on a tree. A yellow leaf drops from the branch and flutters to the ground. CAMERA FOLLOWS until it falls upon an old cracked sidewalk.

A pair of worn Nikes ENTER FRAME just as the leaf drops before them. The feet and CAMERA HOLD until CRANING UP to REVEAL Alex, staring at the leaf with an expression reminiscent of the torn paper's message about  "...Tod."

Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor.

Alex reads her intention loud and clear. She returns to her artwork. The dog GROWLS softly as Alex appraches the garage.

INT/EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY

Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that.

She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal.

She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal.

Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear...

While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine...

Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf.

Clear turns to Alex. The two couldn't appear more different. She moves to a sculpture, an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center.

Alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess?" but tactfully shakes his head "no."

Remaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable.

Uncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens.

Alex sighs, embarrassed.

Jarred, he eyes her, frightened.

Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. Lowering his tone...

The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear.

Alex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting...

INT. FUNERAL HOME - FOYER - NIGHT

CAMERA is LOW, moving across the paisley carpet. Dim light, spilling through the stained glass windows, falls upon the creepy decor, appearing as if designed by a morose Laura Ashley, floor model coffins and urns. CAMERA CONTINUES, TILTING UP to the CEILING, REVEALING a stained glass skylight. Outside, on the roof, two silhouettes appear...

The skylight hinges CRACK open. Clear leads the way. lifting the frame, then dropping it throught the skylight window.

Alex is not as smooth as his socius criminus. Using his knee to slow his descent, he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet.

CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex and Clear through the unsettling reception area; plastic flowers, gold candelabra, plaster cherubs and angels. A bronze plaque identifies: "MT. ABRAHAM FUNERAL HOME. THE JOURNEY'S END. WILLIAM BLUDWORTH - INTERMEDIARY."

With a hot, mischievous smile, Clear proceeds toward the hallway. Alex anxiously sighs... then follows.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

An elevator with collapsible metal door lowers INTO FRAME. Pushing the door aside, Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile. Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the corridor.

A faint light spills from beneath a doorway. Clear reaches out to the knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand. From a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on.

Alex tries the doorknob. Locked. He looks at her, defeated. Clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart.

From it, Alex produces a thin six inch needle. He inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob. CLACK!

INT. MORGUE - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

A lone desk lamp shines. Across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies Tod. A sheet is pulled up to his shoulders. He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician. Hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red.

As Alex and Clear approach...

Suddenly, Tod jerks; his hand lifting four inches...

Ahhh! fuck! You fucking		 Ohmygod! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD!

asshole. You think this        He's not dead?

is funny, you fucking

dick? Tod, if you're

not dead I'm gonna

fucking kill you!

Both are jolted again with shock, turning toward the voice...

MR. BLUDWORTH

CAMERA PUSHES, LOW ANGLE, INTO WILLAIM BLUDWORTH, an African-American man, early 50's, dressed in dark suit and tie.

He flashes a dry mortician's smile, pleased by his wan pun. Alex and Clear haven't recovered from the corspe's actions to calmly address Bludworth..

Alex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body. Bludworth nods, understanding...

As the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on Alex that they have been busted. He nervously offers an explanation.

The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area.

Clear moves in for a closer look, then calls Alex over to the body. After a beat of reluctance, Alex looks at Tod's neck.

ALEX'S POV - CLOSE - TOD'S NECK

The wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint. At this proximity, however, it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire.

WIDER

Because of the supernatural "message" he recieved, Alex is reluctant to answer. He eyes Mr. Bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation.

CAMERA INCHES TOWARD the mortician. In this environment, lit with Fritz Lang shadows, Bludworth's tone, appearance... he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject.

Bludworth moves to Tod on the draining table, disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals.

Vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table.

The mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. He shrugs then continues his work...

Alex considers as Clear eyes him, conveying "this guys's whacked!" Alex moves toward Bludworth...

Mr. Bludworth looks directly at Alex. CAMERA MOVES IN ON EACH,

INDIVIDUALLY... this between the two of them.

Alex's eyes are locked on Bludworth's chilling, pleasant smile. The mortician yanks on a tube, REVEALING a foot long needle removed from Tod's spinal column. The horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to Alex.

Alex grabs her arm, starting toward the door.

Alex looks at Bludworth...

MR. BLUDWORTH

CAMERA PUSHES INTO the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

BRAKING LOUDLY, startlingly, a public bus PULLS INTO CAMERA and stops. The doors HISS open.

CAMERA ADJUSTS as Alex and Clear step off the bus and onto the street.

Clear starts up the street, but Alex grabs her arm and steps back, assuring the bus moves off... safely. He nods, "it's safe to go." Throughout the following, his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly.

Up ahead, scaffolds rise before a building being restored. O.S., HAMMERING and CONSTRUCTION WORK POUND from above. In the f.g., tools and metal spikes. After a "thumbs up" gesture, the rope is pulled UP AND OUT OF FRAME.

As Clear takes a moment to consider, Alex steers them well around the scaffolds, eyes skyward during the move...

This is a creepy fact. Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way.

Reaching an intersection, Alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button, then steps well away from the curb.

PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL

the halting red hand is lit.

INTERSECTION

Clear sighs, growing impatient with Alex.

PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL

the halting red hand turns to the little white walking man.

INTERSECTION

Clear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street. Alex tugs her back, looking both ways while outraged by her challenge.

VROOM! A car indeed makes a right, TEARING through the intersection. Once past, Alex takes Clear by the arm and hustles them across the street.

CAMERA HOLDS REVEALING an unmarked sedan parked across and down from a Starbucks with outdoor seating. Schreck and Weine sit in the car, eyes coolly locked on Alex and Clear.

DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST

Billy Hitchcock rides toward the Starbucks on his bicycle.

EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

sitting outside, Alex hunches over the table, increasingly anxious. Clear listens; expression skeptical.

She picks up her paper coffee cup.

Alex angrily glares at Clear. Clear drops her tone.

Ms. Lewton appears from around the corner. She starts toward the entrance, but pauses, tensing when she sees Alex.

He cautiously flashes a greeting smile. The teacher, however, averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop. Alex sighs, guiltily. Clear sympathizes with both of them.

Alex studies, appealing to her...

He leans foward, removing a peice of paper from his pocket.

CLOSE - ALEX'S HAND

slides across the table. Opening his hand REVEALS the piece of paper reading, "... Tod..." Clear's hand ENTER'S FRAME to take the paper. CAMERA FOLLOWS AS SHE raises it, her expression obviously puzzled. As she eyes Alex for an explanation, CAMERA CRANES DOWN QUICKLY to the empty paper cups on the table...

... a slight approaching BREEZE knocks them over.

DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST

A somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the Starbucks. Carter Horton is driving. Terry Chaney rides shotgun. Carter looks out the window.

CARTER'S POV - MOVING - ALEX AND CLEAR

She holds the paper as Alex, apparently, explains the story.

CARTER'S CAR

CARTER scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems.

ALEX AND CLEAR

Her eyes turn from the paper to Alex, concerned about him...

Alex nods, feeling she's understanding.

Troubled and deeply concerned, Clear studies Alex.

Clear sets the paper down, looking sadly at Alex.

Alex leans back and sighs, relieved...

Alex is taken aback, hurt and angry.

CARTER'S CAR

His eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight U-Turn.

BILLY HITCHCOCK

rides his bike. He reacts, startled by...

BILLY HITCHCOCK'S POV - CARTER'S CAR

barreling down towards him. The car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the U-Turn.

WIDER

Billy SWERVES to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. The car SWERVES right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. The oncoming car HONKS!

Carter's car pulls up to the curb. Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. Inside the car, Terry sighs...

But her boyfriend continues. She gets out and hustles after him.

ALEX AND CLEAR

Their attention drawn by the commotion, Clear and Alex watch Carter Horton approach them, followed by Terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk.

At that moment, Ms. Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself.

Carter steps before Ms. Lewton, blocking her exit...

She can't wait to leave. While trying to walk around Carter...

Carter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt. He raises the volume of his words to drown out Alex's words and incite conflict.

Lived here her whole life.        This'll be hard to believe.

Ms. Lewton's eyes flash to Alex, afraid of him.

And now she has to move.          Listen to me, we may all

All because of Browning.          be in danger...

The two boys stop their heated exchange.

Head and shoulders remaining angrily in Carter's direction, Terry takes a blind step off the curb and into the crosswalk, WITHOUT A CUT... a bus suddenly speeds INTO FRAME and, THUD! plows directly right into her...

ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND MS. LEWTON

are SPLATTERED with BLOOD before they can even recoil.

INT. BROWNING LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE - ALKA SELTZER

FIZZLES in the glass, while O.S., a PHONE RINGS...

ALEX

has crashed, watching CNN. It's a tense recline. Red circles rim the lids of his eyes. He sips from the glass to settle his stomach. Ken appears from the kitchen, hand over the reciever.

No response from Alex. Ken sighs, then into the phone...

Ken returns to the living room, concerned about his son. Alex averts his eyes, stressed and ashamed. Ken sits nearby.

Alex turns his eyes to the glass.

The father respects this young man's wishes. Ken nods "fair enough." In the silent moment, O.S., from the television...

Alex quickly grabs the remote and turns up the VOLUME...

TELIVISION

A computer graphic illustrations the area of the lower fuselage.

ALEX AND KEN

Alex remains riveted to the screen.

TELEVISION

The graphic ZOOMS into the area in the rear right side, nearly above Tod's seat.

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he listens...

TELEVISION

The high-tech computer image traces the path of the explosion through the plane. A red line representing the fuel line zigs through the body of the plane, making a sharp turn forward to the fuel pump, which explodes. Jagged lines show the direction of the explosion moving backwards toward the rear of the plane.

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DAY - 747 SCHEMATIC

drawn in Alex's hand, and hundreds of steps down from CNN computer image, yet accurate as Alex's finger traces the path, away from the seats marked "ME" and "CLEAR." The path starts over "TOD," then moves to "TERRY." The line moves forward away from "CARTER" toward the fuel pump.

The corresponding jagged picture of the explosion back is reminiscent of the "hand of Death," seen earlier in the lightning. It is a graphic demonsration of the arbitrary nature of Death.

ALEX

is amped, intensely more frightened as he believes...

It instantly, frightfully, occurs to him, he now knows who will be next...

CLOSE - SCHEMATIC

Alex's finger quickly moves along the fuel line. After "TERRY," the seat intersecting the path of the fule line, over the fuel pump, is marked "MS. LEWTON."

INT. VALERIE LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - VALERIE LEWTON

ENTER'S FRAME, on the phone, wearing a t-shirt and sweats.

Moving boxes are stacked in the living room; organized disarray of

relocating. The house is old, been in the family forever. Dust marks the walls where framed photos and artwork were once displayed.

She peeks out of the front curtains and looks sadly upon her front yard. Her expression alters... alarmed...

EXT. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - MS. LEWTON'S POV - FRONT YARD

The figure is Alex Browning.

INT. MS. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ms. Lewton steps away from the curtains.

She immediately hangs up and speed dials.

EXT. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex has moved closer to her house, remaining in the shadows. He checks for any passers-by. Being sure there are none, he creeps toward Ms. Lewton's car. He visually inspects the exterior. As he kicks the tires... an unmarked sedan SCREECHES up. Doors open...

Startled, Alex turns to find...

Special agents Schreck and Weine standing in the street, backlit in the strong headlights of their car.

ALEX

is nervous but determined. He tells the truth...

SPECIAL AGENTS SCHRECK AND WEINE

after a beat of incredulity...

INT. MS. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - VALERIE LEWTON

is watching, peeking out her front curtains. O.S., CAR DOORS CLOSE. The vehicle ROARS OFF. She releases the curtains and moves back, feeling somewhat better, but still rattled.

Then...

The curtains billow as if blown by a breeze. Ms. Lewton appears puzzled as she moves the curtains aside to find the windows closed. As CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, tensing and uneasy...

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Alex sits behind a table in the cinderblock room painted police station green. Sitting across from him, with a good cop tone, is Agent Weine, while Schreck stands with a hard-ass posture.

INT. MS. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ms. Lewton moves to a closet door, opens it and CLICKS on an overhead light.

Kneeling down, she tugs on a heavy box and opens it to check the contents. Her expression warms, as if recalling a far off memory.

She slides a vinyl record album out of the sleeve and moves to the turntable on a shelf, thick with dust.

Valerie places the record on the stereo and sets the needle on the album. CAMERA SWEEPS IN CLOSE TO THE TURNTABLE, although spinning around and around... the bold letters of the center label can be read... JOHN DENVER... the opening acoustic guitar of "Rocky Mountain High" has never sounded so eerie...

Pleased with the feeling of a pleasant memory, Lewton moves off.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Schreck moves closer to Alex.

Alex is insulted by the condescending tone.

Alex takes a nervous breath...

The agents study Alex...

INT. MS. LEWTON'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - SET OF CUTLERY KNIVES

held in a wooden block, sits atop the kitchen counter.

In the b.g., Valerie removes the chrome teapot from the stove and moves it to the sink. JOHN DENVER CONTINUES in the next room. Ms. Lewton turns on the faucet, pours water into the kettle. Some water spills on the side of the kettle. As she wipes the pot with a blue checked hand towel, a dark shadow appears to cross behind her.

Lewton turns. CAMERA FOLLOWS, CIRCLING as she looks about the room only to find she is alone. Unsetteled, she absently tosses the towel on the counter the edge which, catches a knife blade held in the cutery block.

STOVE

Ms. Lewton turns on the gas, adjusts it, however... the flames blow out. She pauses, nerves on edge. Her eyes cautiously move about the room and find nothing. She grabs a pack of nearby matches and strikes one.

CAMERA PUSHES INTO the burner as the flames re-ignite and FILL THE FRAME...

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Weine sits across from Alex, symapthetic, but professional...

Alex tenses, but Weine shakes his head.

Alex sighs, eases.

Weine leans forward toward Alex...

The agents are taken aback by his answer; unnerved by his sincerity. Weine sighs and looks to his partner, who sighs, frustrated and turns away.

Alex stands and, with no urgency, moves off. He exits the room.

Weine considers, yet remains skeptical.

INT. MS. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE - TEAPOT

Whistles.

COFFEE MUG - OVERHEAD

two tea bags are dropped inside, then the steaming hot water.

MS. LEWTON

picks up the cup, raising it toward her lips. She pauses, her expression turning tragic.

On a reflex, she spins toward the sink and throws the hot contents into the drain. She sits the mug down...

A COFFEE MUG

ENTERS FRAME... displaying the logo of the Mt. Abraham Fighting Colonials.

MS. LEWTON

Trembling. She takes a deep breath, getting a hold of herself.

Opening the refrigerator frezzer, she grabs some ice and a bottle of pure Polish Vodka then deliberately turns back toward the same mug...

COFFEE MUG

the ice cubes PLUNK. The cold alchohol pours into the hot mug. CAMERA PUSHES INTO THE MUG as... it slightly CRACKS, Vodka dripping out of the base.

Lewton's hand picks up the mug, oblivious to the crack. She moves off toward the living room, leaving a trail of alcohol.

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Alex exits the police station, walking. He checks over his shoulder to see if he is being watched and increases his pace, legs whipping across FRAME...

INT. MS. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Valerie Lewton tears off a piece of plastic bubble wrap. She stands over her desk, placed against the wall. On the desk is her desktop computer monitor.

She pauses to swig from her cup of vodka.

EXTREMELY CLOSE - COFFEE MUG

alcohol drips from her mug...

EXTREMELY CLOSE - COMPUTER MONITOR VENT

... fluid drips inside the circuitry.

MS. LEWTON

sets the mug out of the way on the back edge of her desk.

CLOSE - COFFEE MUG

The remaining vodka oozes from the crack, pools, then drips off the edge of the desk...

CAMERA CRANES DOWN to REVEAL the moniter cabel inserted into an electrical wall socket. The vodka drip... drip... drips PAST FRAME. Then, Lewton's hand ENTERS and pulls the monitor plug, creating tiny SPARKS at the connection...

ON THE FLOOR

the alcohol ignites...

MS. LEWTON

her back is to the desk, while pouring styrofoam peanuts into the box. In the b.g., FLAMES, nearly supernaturally, leap up the walland toward the computer monitor.

CLOSE - COMPUTER MONITOR - THROUGH THE VENTS

the interior catches fire, causing an electrical POP!

MS. LEWTON

turns, holding her sheet of bubble wrap, shocked by the flames.

THE COMPUTER MONITOR

On the screen, the reflection of the approaching shadow passes before the monitor... EXPLODES!

MS. LEWTON

a large jagged shard from the monitor flies into her throat. Blood squirts from her neck onto the bubble wrap. Her stunned expression is sickeningly numb from shock.

She reaches up to reflexively pull the glass from her throat, creating a flood of spurting blood.

She drops the glass and quickly stumbles toward the kitchen, blindly banging the turntable as she passes. The needle skips, BUMPS... and settles... umercifully at the start of "Rocky Mountain High."

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Alex walks quickly up the street. Smoke wafts before him. He turns to see a man burning leaves in the backyard.

The breeze intensifies, lifting the burning debris. The smoke swirls around him. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX as he senses the Presence. He looks ahead.

ALEX'S POV - TWO DOZEN LEAVES

mystically float past him, each on fire.

ALEX

senses the taunting message and breaks into a full sprint, passing through many of the burning leaves that break up into the bright orange cinders against the black sky.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - THE FLAMES

reach the coffee mug, igniting the trickling stream leading to, and away from, the crack in the cup.

FLOOR

Flames ride the small trickle of vodka back toward the kitchen...

INT. KITCHEN - LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Valerie Lewton races in, desperately pressing her hand to her throat as she GURGLES and CHOKES on the blood from the wound. She leans over the now red sink. She turns pale from the blood loss.

THE STOVE

the flaming stream shoots up the stove, lighting the burners.

MS. LEWTON

behind her, the stove ERUPTS in FLAMES. They jump, leap like a tiger, landing on her shoulders and hair, which catch on fire...

EXT. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex approaches the front of the house. From here, nothing appears to be wrong. As he catches his breath, sweating, visually examining the house.

From INSIDE, a hoarse, macabre SCREAM! CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX, stunned, before he races off toward the house.

INT. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - MS. LEWTON

DROPS INTO FRAME ON HER KITCHEN FLOOR, hair and sweatshirt aflame. She desperately rolls on the floor and manages to extinguish the flames.

On her back, on the floor, she is badly burned. Her open neck wound continues to bleed. Blood pools on the floor. In shock and moving on pure survial instincts, she reaches up...

LEWTON'S POV - (LOOKING UP) - THE HAND TOWEL

the lower third of the towel dangles over the edge of the counter top. Her hand grabs it, and pulls.

COUNTER TOP

the draped edge of the towel pulls over the cutlery block. The knives spill out, entangled with the hand towel.

KITCHEN DOORWAY

Alex rushes across the threshold as Ms. Lewton pulls the knives over the counter.

MS. LEWTON

a half dozen knives, from small, but sharp, cutting blades to large butcher knives, cascade into her body.

Her hand trembling, her expression horrified, Lewton grabs the handle of the largest blade, trying to pull it out. Alex quickly kneels next to her. She looks at him, in shock, her eyes pleading. Alex gathers his courage, places his hand on the handle of the largest blade. As he's about to remove it...

THE STOVE

a gas line ERUPTS, creating a small EXPLOSION.

THE COUNTER TOP

the cutlery block is knocked off of the counter...

MS. LEWTON

the block lands directly on the butcher knife handle, driving the blade further into Ms. Lewton's body.

LEWTON'S POV - THE SHADOW

descends, the FRAME COLLAPSING until her face, eerily peaceful, but lifeless gray, horrifically decays... flesh rotting, worms feeding on muscle until only a skull remains.

MS. LEWTON

as Death arrives, her eyes are macabrely focused above her.

ALEX

Even as blood squirts on him from her open wound, he appears to realize she is "seeing" the moment of death.

Flames leap from the stove to the curtains, which catch fire.

Alex grabs the knife and pulls it out. He quickly removes another and another... yet there is no reaction from the woman.

Knowing she is dead, Alex pauses with guilt. He looks at the knife in his hand, then realizes how incriminating this could appear. In that moment, another small EXPLOSION from the stove brings Alex quickly to his feet. He drops the knife to the floor and races from the house. CAMERA TILTS DOWN to the shoe prints left in the pool of blood.

EXT. LEWTON'S STREET - NIGHT

Alex runs with all his strength away from Valerie Lewton's home. Billy Hitchcock is riding his bicycle in Alex's direction. He stops and gets off his bike.

Alex appears unaware as he simply runs past Billy, who curiously turns his head to watch Alex race up the street. O.S., the CRACKLING OF FIRE. CAMERA MOVES INTO Billy as he turns back, reacting with shock to Ms. Lewton's house.

THE HOUSE

from inside, an intense EXPLOSION propels glass from the windows. Flames engulf the entire house.

ALEX

even down the street, he is knocked to his feet by the blast. In the distance, SIRENS from approaching POLICE AND FIRE trucks are HEARD. He stands, looks to the now suspicious Billy... then opts to run off away from the scene. Escaping into the dark backyards of the neighborhood.

INT./EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY - CLEAR RIVERS

Tense, her eyes look left, then right...

WIDER

Agents Schreck and Weine stand before Clear in her garage.

She studies the men before averting her eyes.

The agents study her. Weine accepts the explanation. Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash. Clear tenses, however...

Schreck hands his card. She takes it and nods. Schreck pauses, once again eyeing the painting before moving out of the garage on their way to their car.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks at the business card.

EXT. MT. ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Flight 180 Memorial, lit for dramatic effect at night, but only achieving an eeriness. Carter Horton and Billy Hitchcock ENTER FRAME, moving toward the monument. Billy is riding his bicycle, wearing a New York Rangers jersey with "Hitchcock" across the back of the shoulders. Nearing the shadows, the two boys stop looking at the monument.

Carter pulls put a heavy pocket knife and starts attempting to cut into the stone.

Clear Rivers appears from the shadows.

Clear is touched by the action.

Clear eyes the two of them. With the memorial standing behind them...

As Carter and Billy feel the chill of their inner fears...

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The muscle car ROARS onto U.S. 17 on ramp. A sign near the road indicates:

"Middletown - 25 mi. New York City - 105 mi."

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Carter checks the rearview mirror. Clear looks out the front passenger window. She shakes her head, as if "no one's following us." Billy leans forward from the backseat...

He sits back, OUT OF FRAME, but quickly darts forward.

Billy sits back, gesturing, "hear ya. Got it." Clear pays no attention to their exchange as she stare out into the darkness, her thoughts a million miles away.

EXT. SEASHORE - JONES BEACH SATE PARK - NIGHT

A posted sign indicates "ACCIDENT SITE. ANY DEBRIS FOUND SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE NTSB (212)555-NTSB." CAMERA FINDS Carter's car pulling up to a stop. Clear opens the passenger door and pauses in the car a while...

Clear closes the door. Carter and Billy drive off. As she looks to the beach.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

CAMERA, FACING the ocean, moves along the shore revealing a lone image sitting on the beach, looking into the Atlantic.

The waves are small bur rhythmic, an enternal metronome. Numb, Alex Browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea.

Behind him, O.S., approaching in the sand, SOFT FOOTSTEPS. He listens, notes them. Yet rather than turn around... he looks up into the sky.

ALEX'S POV - THE SKY

The shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars, breaking through, infinitely above.

WIDER

Clear Rivers approaches, barefoot in the sand. He neddn't turn to know who is behind him.

Clear hasn't met eyes with Alex, but she sits nearby, looking into the sky.

She looks out at the stars. He doesn't eye her, either...

Alex hangs his head...

She has lived this so many times, she is long beyond crying...

The waves continue to shore. Clear looks up at the sky.

He looks at her.

She looks at him...

Alex looks within her, as a soft ocean breeze blows through Clear's hair.

His eyes well with tears. Only as she looks at Alex does Clear become emotional... they move closer, and kiss, the desire for each other, to defy the events around them; darkness; the isolation...

They dive into a deep feverish kiss. Embracing, as if the tighter, the safer. She pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head.

Clear looks down the beach, checking for any sight of Billy and Carter.

Alex looks to Clear, then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death. He pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms. CAMERA CRANES UP as the young man and woman make love in the sand... consciously and defiantly oblivious, to anything around them... including the stars, possibly Flight 180, up above.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Carter drives. Billy rides shotgun. Alex and Clear are in the back. Everyone anxious, looking for cops.

Carter, however, continually glances into the rearview mirror, checking Alex. Finally, hotheaded and unable to withhold it any further...

Alex looks at Clear, her expression asking the same question...

The three others turn quiet, considering what it must be...

Alex eyes them... hesitant to respond.

Billy looks out the window, despondent.

The three are silent.

Carter's expression becomes frightened, but he cannot have this. He counters with an irrational bravado.

Carter bares down on the wheel, hits the GAS...

EXT. AN INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The muscle car ROARS past a stop sign.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

The interior bounces as the car clears a dip past the intersection. Alex, Clear, and Billy tenses...

EXT. ANOTHER INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The car GUNS IT through another stop sign.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Every passenger hangs on as the car BOUNCES from the next dip.

EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Red light. A car approaches with the greenlighted right of way. Carter's car TEARS INTO FRAME, just missing being T-boned in the intersection as the other car HITS THE BRAKES, fishtailing.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

EXT. A SECOND TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Carter barrels through the intersection as a car makes a left turn at the intersection.

TURNING CAR DRIVER'S POV - CARTER'S CAR

flying down the road, appears to be heading straight towards him.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Carter takes his hands off the wheel and raises them in the air, like a terrorized child on a roller coaster...

EXT. A SECOND TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The turning car HONKS, ROARING through the intersection as Carter's car nearly clips the rear end of the turning car.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Cater hooks his elbow on the window and his right arm around the front seat, driving; no hands.

Carter eyes Clear in the rearview mirror.

EXT. BACKSTREET - NIGHT

In the backseat, Alex and Clear ease... just as a railroad crossing arm drops INTO FRAME in the REAR WINDOW. O.S., the CLANG CLANG CLANG of a RAILROAD CROSSING ALARM.

OUT OF THE FRONT WINDOW

The front crossing arm drops INTO FRAME before the car. Carter turns and flashes a "that's why I stopped" smile.

INSIDE THE CAR

Carter turns off the engine, then sits back into his seat and folds his arms, indicating he has no intention of moving.

Scared to death, Billy fumbles with the car door handle. From the front passenger seat, he looks up and to his left...

OUT OF THE DRIVER'S WINDOW - BILLY'S POV

A locomotive headlight arcs across the trees... approaching.

RETURN

Billy collects himself...

CLOSE - BILLY'S DOOR HANDLE

POPS open!

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

The train appears around the blind bend...

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Billy opens the door and pours out. Clear and Alex are quickly behind him. Carter remains in the drivers seat.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

The train WARNING WHISTLE BLOWS as Alex, Clear and Billy hustle away from the car, on the same side of the tracks. They quickly turn around, desperate to convince...

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Arms crossed, Carter remains in the front seat. As the interior fills with light from the headlight of the oncoming train, Carter turns and looks at them with a smart ass smile, pleased that he's shown how brave he truly is. With a beam of cocky definace...

He cooly turns back to the ignition, grabs the key and turns it over... only to be met with the DULL CLACK of a dead engine.

CAMERA SWEEPS INTO HIM AS his EYES FLARE with tension...

CLOSE - IGNITION

he turns it, again and again... nothing.

CARTER

looks up...

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT - CARTER'S POV - THE TRAIN

is moments away.

ALEX, CLEAR AND BILLY

assess the situation...

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

As he turns away from them, Carter sees something in the rearview mirror...

CARTER'S POV - REAR VIEW MIRROR

the passing shadow is darker than any surrounding darkness.

CARTER

as if the image has effected him, he looks to his lap belt and CLACKS the button. He tugs at the restraint, but it will not move. He's strapped in.

He tries to open the door... it won't open. He pulls at the door handle... tugs at the seatbelt... panicked. Horrified, he whips towards the others.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

Alex, Billy and Clear look at one another, equally frightened...

Alex takes off toward...

CARTER'S CAR

Alex hustles around the drivers' side. CAMERA SWEEPS INTO THEM as Alex desperately tries freeing the seatbelt.

THE TRAIN

the WHISTLES SCREAMS!

CLEAR AND BILLY

tense, as the train nears...

ALEX AND CARTER

Alex grabs Carter by the shoulders and strains with all his might to pull the much more muscular kid out of the driver's window.

CLOSE - CARTER'S SEAT BELT

the shadowy presence is reflected by the chrome buckle, however, after it passes... the seat belt begins to TEAR.

ALEX AND CARTER

As CAMERA SWEEPS IN to ALEX and he releases a deep GROAN...

ACROSS THE TRACKS

The train TEARS THROUGH the front end of the muscular car! GLASS and METAL ERUPT as the locomotive THUNDERS THROUGH FRAME.

CLEAR AND BILLY

must turn away from the shower of metal and broken glass.

ALEX AND CARTER

Alex holds Carter by the shirt at the shoulders, dragging him away from the wreckage. The two boys collapse on the road as the trian continues to ROAR PAST...

TRAIN TRACKS

as the heavy train wheels THUNDER and CLACK, a broken two foot long shard of the car's debris BOUNCES upon the tracks, kicked about by the train wheels.

CLEAR AND BILLY

run to the two survivors.

CLEAR

runs and falls into Alex's arms, holding him tight.

ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND BILLY

Carter lies on the road, urine stains around his crotch, hyperventilating and near tears.

Carter looks at the piece of seatbelt.

CLOSE - TRAIN WHEELS

continue to kick around the chunk of twisted metal...

RETURN

The THUNDERING TRAIN intensifies the situation...

Billy begins backing away from the others.

Billy continues backing away, horrified.

CLOSE - TRAIN TRACKS

the debris rattles beneath the wheels...

CARTER AND ALEX

still on the ground...

BILLY

backing away...

TRAIN TRACKS

the debris bounces directly on the track. With great power and force, a train wheel runs over the debris, cutting it in half. It catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile...

BILLY

FWOOP! The metal tears ACROSS FRAME, ripping Billy's head from his

shoulders.

ALEX, CLEAR AND CARTER

The ROAR of the TRAIN seems exaggerated as they are frozen in horrified shock.

EXTREMELY WIDE - ACROSS THE TRACKS

The train CLEARS FRAME and is gone... REVEALING, across the tracks, Alex, Clear and Carter can do nothing but watch Billy's decapitated body macabrely wobbling on its two front feet before falling to the ground.

For a beat, there is SILENCE... until, in the distance, SIRENS can be heard, approaching. As Alex stands and Carter manages to rise on wobbly legs... none of them can remove their eyes from Billy's body.

Alex looks at Clear as if expiriencing an intense epiphany.

Alex considers, mind racing... then realizes...

Clear grabs Clear and touches her face.

Carter turns to them; it's as far as he will go to admit he believes... or will help...

As she moves to Alex, Clear nods her acknowledgement and appreciation to Carter. She takes Alex by the hand and the pair begin running away, off into the woods.

In the DISTANCE, a TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS, eerie, as if Death was punctuating the moment.

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

The windows are boarded. The front steps are worn and dilapidated. In the early evening moonlight, the dwelling appears eerie and ghostly. CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD the house, a pre-storm breeze swaying branches and blowing leaves. In the distance... LIGHTNING...

INT. CABIN - DAY - A SMALL TABLE

A final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges. Even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled. The room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light.

CAMERA FOLLOWS a hand as it carefully picks up a Coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat.

ALEX

finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach.

Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight.

He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can.

Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until... after steadying himself... prepares to swallow... then, carefully does.

Pause... he's alright. He takes the spoon. Scoops some more. And the process begins again.

INT. BATHROOM - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - DAY

A pink circle fills THE ENTIRE FRAME.

EXTREMELY CLOSE - CLEAR'S EYES

look downward, anxious and full of thought.

A HOME PREGNANCY TEST

the results are positive, two pink dots, confirming.

WIDER

Clear sighs, frightened as she tosses the test upon a half dozen other discarded tests. You can never be too sure. Outside, WIND of an approaching storm blows. CAMERA tensely INCHES IN ON Clear...

INT. CABIN - NIGHT - CRACK BENEATH DOOR

The resulting THUNDER RUMBLES. A breeze blows beneath the door, carrying some Autumn leaves. CAMERA FOLLOWS the breeze across the floor to Alex's pant legs which slightly flutter.

CAMERA RISES TO ALEX, sitting in his safe chair. Paranoid and obsessively cautious, his eyes move towards the door, anticipating the consequential events. Following the path of the breeze, Alex turns around...

ALEX'S POV - TRASH BAG

the brown shopping bag tips over. Amongst the trash spread on the floor, a can rolls out and across the floor.

ALEX

tenses. He doesn't look to where the can has been, but where it is going.

ALEX'S POV - CAN

rolls across the floor and gently hits the end of a fishing pole, propped in the corner. The pole teeters and falls over.

FISHING HOOK

falls, hooking a closet door. The door begins to swing open.

ALEX

is quickly out of his safe chair, hustling towards...

THE DOOR

Alex slams the door shut before it can open. Behind the door, a CRASH as something falls. Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition.

Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. He cautiously opens the door, REVEALING an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor.

CLOSET FLOOR

a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor. Alex bends down and examines them.

O.S., a sound. Like a THUMP near the cabin steps. He freezes, like an animal sensing danger. THUNDER RUMBLES. The light around him begins to flicker and sway.

COLEMAN LANTERN

a draft creeps beneath the glass enclosure. The flame, dancing.

INT. BEDROOM - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - DAY

ENTERING FRAME, Clear peeks out the window, careful not to be seen.

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S STREET - DAY - CLEAR'S POV

The unmarked F.B.I. sedan maintains surveillance. Schreck and Weine sit inside.

INT. BEDROOM - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - DAY

Distant... APPROACHING THUNDER RUMBLES as she steps away. The weight of the world on her shoulders, Clear paces, considering her options. She looks to a bookshelf...

CLOSE - AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH

A man, early thirties, holds a six year old girl in his arms, waving at the camera. Both appear happy and alive. They are standing before the cabin surrounded by the thick woods.

The photograph is turned over. On the back is marked in a young girl's handwriting, "me and dad at the cabin. 1986."

CLEAR

As CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER... considering life. Then, now and what is to come.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Weine sits in the passenger seat looking through the pair of binoculars. Schreck is behind the wheel.

A figure steps into the drivers side window, from the rear. The two agents are startled as Clear Rivers leans into FRAME. She pauses, gauging their trustworthiness, then...

The two agents remain respectful...

She considers... and understands.

As she senses the agents' sincerity...

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Distant THUNDER ECHOES. Alex kindles a fire in the fireplace, balling up old newspapers. He begins to crumble the local news... then pauses.

A headline catches his attention. CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM, tense, while THUNDER RUMBLES. As he unrolls the paper, his expression is rocked... anxious... he cocks his head to consider... recalling... as CAMERA PUSHES ALL THE WAY INTO...

HEADLINE - CRUMPLED NEWSPAPER

"PARENTS TO ESTABLISH MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIPS." Besides the headline are two yearbook photos; Christa Marsh and Blake Dreyer.

ALEX

his expression reflects a terrifying revelation...

CAMERA PUSHES into a TIGHT CLOSE UP...

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear paces in her living room. She moves to the curtains and checks out the window. Although it is not raining, LIGHTNING CRACKS across the sky!

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - POWER LINE

The lightning STRIKES the top of the pole, SNAPPING two power lines, which whip in the wind.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The power goes out. The room turns dark. Outside, brilliant bluish white arc lights CRACKLE. Clear moves to the window.

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S POV - POWER LINES

ARC violently striking the ground and each other. Each line whips

unpredictably like an uncontrolled garden hose with the water turned on full. And yet, there's a mean, angry and taunting personality to the two power lines. As if Death were within them.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

She assesses the situation and moves to a pair of candles on the mantle, lightning them with a Bic. O.S., from the backyard, a DOG BARKS. Clear brings the candle through the small house.

INT. KITCHEN - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear moves quickly to the kitchen, holding the candle. Outside, BLUE ARC LIGHT CRACKLES. She looks out the backyard.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S POV

An old circular clothesline turns like a pinwheel in the wind. In the center of the yard is an oblong, tarped above ground pool. In the furthest corner of the yard, her dog is chained to a tree, BARKING AND FREAKED OUT. An old tire swing rocks in the storm. From the manner in which the house is situated and the length of the snapped power lines, one is capable of reaching the backyard.

The power line STRIKES the ground, "closing in on" the dog.

INT. KITCHEN - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear considers the danger of venturing out to get the dog.

Although no window is open, and the power outage has shut off any air conditioning... the candle flame whips, then extinguishes. The blue smoke swirls ominously into the room.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOTHESLINE

Sharp metal edges spin. Glinting blue arc light...

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

Alex charges out the front door, leaping over the steps. O.S., SEVERAL CARS APPROACH, headlights pan across the trees. Alex stops dead in his tracks and runs off into the woods, just as the F.B.I umarked sedan and three Sheriff 4x4s THUNDER up to the cabin, siren lights swirling.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Weine is driving, leading the other vehicles. Schreck points out the passenger window.

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - WEINE'S POV - THROUGH CAR WINDOW

Full sprint, Alex disappears into the dark forest.

WIDER

the cars BRAKE to a stop, SKIDDING in the dirt. Sheriffs leap out of their vehicles. High powered flashlights shoot beams in Alex's direction. The officers take after the suspect.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The backdoor opens. Clear charges out into the backyard.

THE DOG

Helpless, chain wrapped around the tree. THUNDER RUMBLES.

CLEAR

continues to run...

THE CIRCULAR CLOTHESLINE

is whipped by a power line. SPARKS FLY as the base pole snaps in two.

CLEAR

the metal poles punge into the ground just before and behind her, inches from impaling her. She stumbles, but quickly steps aside and continues toward the tree.

THE CIRCULAR CLOTHES-LINE FRAME

is rolled by the winds, across the yard toward...

ABOVE GROUND POOL

the clothesline frame punctures the pool. Water streams from the rupture.

CLEAR

reaches the tree and begins unfastening the dog's collar from the chain.

THE POWER LINES

whipping, strike one another causing an angry FLASH!

THE RIVETS

holding the pool frame begin to BREAK and POP. Water floods into the yard.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex, blindly running through the forest, sheriffs' flashlight beams crossing behind him... in pursuit.

Looing back to check the postition of the agents, Alex blindly runs over the lip of a downward slope...

GULLY

He rolls and tumbles uncontrollably down the hillside. As he nears the base...

ALEX

stops with a CRUNCHING THUD... his face an inch from being impaled by a sharp, thick protruding branch. No time to catch his breath, he's up and running.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S FEET

water floods, pooling the backyard, cascading over Clear's feet. She looks down, in the reflection of the puddle, the dark shadow passes. Clear whips up, checking the position of...

A POWER LINE

coils, like a cobra, ready to STRIKE!

TREE

Clear drops the chain and hits the dog on its backside.

The dog starts to tear off toward the house. Clear runs toward the hanging tire. Leaps...

THE POWER LINE

whips, the frayed wires hitting the puddle of water...

CLEAR

in mid-air, desperately grabs the tire, hanging on, literally for her life. O.S., the dog YELPS. Clear turns back...

CLEAR'S POV - THE DOG

convulses in the small pool of water, burning from the overwhelming amounts of electricity.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - SMALL CREEK

Distant flashlights reflect in a small stream, barely two inches deep. Alex's foot splashes in the water. THUNDER RUMBLES.

ALEX

races along the path of the stream.

SHERIFFS

continue their pursuit through the dark trees.

ABOVE

Lightning CRACKS a tree branch.  SPARKS FLY! The tree tumbles down the branches.

ALEX

The thick branch falls from above, landing on top of him. He's knocked to the ground and pinned... face down in the creek.

CAMERA MOVES IN... his nose and mouth, just below the water line, but he cannot move. His eyes flash with panic, as he struggles... battles to move and avoid drowning in two inches of water.

As he struggles in the f.g., Weine and a pair of Sheriffs appear ten yards beyond him. They pause, confused, panning their flashlights across the forest.

WIENE'S POV - FOREST

the lights actually expose the area where Alex lies. From their postition, however, he is covered by the branch and out of sight.

ALEX

struggles to raise his head above the water, chest bursting...

WEINE AND SHERIFFS

believing Alex is not in the area, move ahead into the woods.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVERS'S HOUSE NIGHT

Clear pulls herself up to a tree branch. Lighting and THUNDER CONTINUE amongst the ARCING, CRACKLING POWER LINES. She searches for an escape.

CLEAR'S POV - THE TREE BRANCH

extends toward the house.

CLEAR

straining in the storm, begins moving up the branch...

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - CLOSE - ALEX'S EYES

dart open. Taking a tenth of a second to gather all of his strength, all his courage, he arches his back, pushing with his hands, anything to lift his face out of the stream.

With a DEEP GASP, he does so. Drinking up the air. It appears to infuse him with another blast of adrenaline as he manages to push with his arms and free himself from the pinning tree branch.

He pauses only for a couple gulps of air... and is off.

EXT. WINDOW - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear leaps from the end of the branch to her window, grabbing the sill awkwardly, she dangles outside the house. With a breath, she pulls herself inside, just as the power line bites, ARCING, at her feet.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

Weine RUNS INTO FRAME, looks around, frustrated...

ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - SCHRECK

deperately scans the area.

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The power lines strike the rooftop.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear River's stands in her bedroom just as it fills with blinding blue light. Her television screen BLOWS OUT. Sparks jet across the room. Blasts of FLAME erupt from the electrical outlets. She quickly turns, racing toward the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA IS LOW, RACING WITH HER as SPARKS EXPLODE FROM the lamps and electrical outlets. She cuts and leaps three steps at a time down the staircase...

EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS/BACKYARD - NIGHT

Alex tears across the fenceless backyards towards Clear's house. Blue ARC light glowing from the front yard.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A mid-eighties Corolla is parked amongst Clear's artwork. A door, adjacent to the kitchen flies open. Clear hustles through, running to the car and entering via the passenger door, for the sake of expediency.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The power lines WHACK angerily against the door.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Clear scoots into the driver's seat. She CLICKS the automatic garage door opener...

GARAGE DOOR OPENER MOTER

connected to a metal arm, attached to the door, remains motionless - there is no power.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Realizing the motor is dead, Clear takes a beat, STARTS THE ENGINE and SHIFTS INTO REVERSE...

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex reaches the backyard. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he quickly tries to deduce the deadly situation. HE RUNS OUT OF FRAME...

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear guns the small car in reverse.

GARAGE DOOR

as the rear of the car makes impact with the door...

THE GARAGE OPENER

trembles, the long metal arm collapses, falls...

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

BAM! In reverse, the Corolla SMASHES through the garage door.

THE METAL ARM

of the garage door opener RIPS through the windshield, locking upon the windshield wiper grille. The other end remains attached to the garage roof interior, essentially acting as an anchor.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

The car SHUDDERS, wheels spinning uselessly, as the arm "holds" onto the car.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - DOOR OPENER MOTER

the screws holding the arm to the ceiling begin to pull away...

A METAL CAN

on a shelf, is rocked as, O.S., the CAR rattles the garage, trying to break free. The can is marked "TURPENTINE: EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE." The can tumbles over the shelf.

GARAGE FLOOR

the can SMACKS on the floor, edgewise, REVREALING the can is sealed tight with a cap.

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - POWER LINE

thick cable ARCS, snapping toward the car INTO FRAME.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Foot to the floor, Clear SCREAMS for the car to move.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - DOOR OPENER MOTOR

pulls away from the ceiling.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Corolla lurches backward, freed from the grasp of the house.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

a chunk of the ceiling collapses upon Clear's artworks, including the canvas incorporating a jagged piece of debris from Flight 180. The metal SLAMS to the floor, on top of...

THE CAN OF TURPENTINE

which causes the flammable liquid to stream out, toward the driveway.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

As the Corolla lurches away from the house down the sloped driveway...

THE POWER LINE

THUDS upon Clear's car.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

An ear splitting CRACKLE. SPARKS FLY! The electrical system of the samll car erupts and the engine dies. The car stops.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

From the rear of the house appears Alex. CAMERA SWEEPS IN ON HIM as he reacts to the situation...

WIDER

The power line sadistically rests atop the automobile. The exposed end of the cable flutters and whips like a cat's tail, SPARKING, CRACKLING, as it hits the ground.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Clear looks up desperately to Alex.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex extends his hands. O.S., CARS approach THUNDEROULSY...

IN THE STREET

The unmarked F.B.I. vehicle and two sheriff patrol cars pull up on the street. Schreck and Weine hustle out of the car.

THE POWER LINE

SNAPS in ALEX'S DIRECTION.

ALEX

lurches back...

THE STREAM OF TURPINTINE

is ignited by a single spark fom the power line. It flows toward the car.

ALEX

backs away, eyes locked with Clear's, assuring she's remaining in the car.

CLEAR

keeps her eyes locked on Alex, watching him. Suddenly, a BURST OF FIRE FLASHES FROM BELOW FRAME...

ALEX

reacts, shocked. He realizes...

WIDER

the underbelly of the Corolla has ignited from the stream of combustible fluid.

SCHRECK AND WEINE

step forward...

THE POWER LINE

atop the car, whips, ARCS, warning everyone away.

IN THE COROLLA

Clear can see the flames, her instinct is to grab the handle to get out.

CLEAR'S POV - GARAGE WALL

The fire roars angrily in the f.g., on the garage wall, however, the shadows do not match that of the flames, rather, the approaching form of Death appears.

ALEX

steps closer...

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX as he quickly considers, then moves toward the hood of the burning car...

SCHRECK AND WEINE

ALEX AND CLEAR

hearing this, Alex's mind is made up. He looks to Clear.

At that moment, Clear doesn't understand. She looks to him, scared...

He reaches out and grabs the power line, falling back to pull it away from the hood of the car. The cable ARCS furiously.

COROLLA

Clear opens the driver's side door and runs out, knocked to her feet as behind her the car EXPLODES.

ALEX

is engulfed in the flames.

ALEX'S POV - THE SHADOWS

the edges of the FRAME are collapsing. Alex's face, gray and emotionless appears, yet, before it can transform into decay...

ALEX

through the flames, as if sensing the oncoming horror, defying the image...

He looks toward...

CLEAR - ALEX'S POV

She... is the last sight he'll ever see.

WIDER

The power line ERUPTS! Alex disapears behind the wall of fire and sparks before falling limp on the driveway.

CLEAR

Schreck, Weine and PARAMEDICS rush to the girl. Schreck turns back, calling out to a paramedic, helplessly watching by ther burning car.

CLEAR'S EYES

flash open, horrified, answering the question...

THE SKY

a web of LIGHTNING CRACKS across the Heavens, as if Death was making a final angry proclamation.

SCHRECK AND WEINE

CAMERA EASES IN on the agents, exchanging rattled expressions that convey their unease in the proof that Alex was right.

CLEAR - OVERHEAD

As a pair of paramedics work on her, a soft breeze blows across the girl, and only the girl. CAMERA MOVES DOWN TO HER FACE, her eyes opened... welling with tears... seeming to realize... to sense, he is gone.

INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY - CLEAR

SCREAMS, as if reacting to Alex's death, but in actuality it is a reaction to the pain of delivering her child.

DOCTORS AND NURSES

stand between Clear's legs in the stirrups...

CLEAR

breathes, pushes hard. Alex's parents stand on each side of her, holding her hand, wiping her forehead.

THE DOCTOR

cuts the umbilical cord.

CLEAR, KEN AND BARBARA

smile and fight back the tears. Clear begins to laugh euphorically through the tears.

Clear lifts her head up, still battling the pain of labor...

CLEAR'S POV - THE BABY

covered in goop, eyes shut... a new life arrives.

DOCTOR

looks at the clock and reprots to an attending nurse. Another nurse cleans up the baby, wieghs him and places him in a hospital bassinet.

CLEAR, KEN AND BARBARA

Barabra places a cool wet cloth on Clear's forehead...

Everyone recognizes the eerie, yet beautiful coincidence. Clear leans her haed back, relieved, euphoric...

Cleaned and wrapped in a swaddling blanket, the baby is placed in the mothers arms. The long retrospective harmonica of Neil Young's "Long May You Run" reprises as Clear looks at the I.D. braclet...

WRIST BRACLET

"Alexander Chance Browning II."

DELIVERY ROOM

CAMERA PULLS BACK. The birthing room is quiet; the people introspective. The doctors. The family. The mother and child. A room of new life, in which, each recalls a life lost.

As "Long May You Run" OVERLAPS...

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DAY - FLOWERS

A bright, colorful arrangment of flowers is carefully placed into a vase. CAMERA ADJUSTS to REVEAL Alex's bedroom is now lived in by Clear and the baby. Clear makes the final adjustment in the arrangement, then checks the sleeping baby in the bassinet.

Clear moves to her bed with a book. As she settles in, O.S., a faint RUSTLE. CAMERA INCHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks to...

CLEAR'S POV - THE FLOWERS

a soft breeze causes the petals to flutter...

CLEAR

looks toward...

CLEAR'S POV - THE WINDOWS

which are closed.

CLEAR'S POV - THE FAN

which... is off.

CLEAR

looks across the room...

CLEAR'S POV - THE ROOM

The breeze moves through the flowers... billows the cutains, posters and photos on the wall... until seemingly settling over the bassinet. The lace trim and blankets rustled by the breeze, it is hovering over the child.

CLEAR

CAMERA SETTLES, but her expression does not reflect fear. She knows Alex is here... and she smiles, tears welling in her eyes.

THE BABY

the bassinet trim settles, as if the presence is leaving. Before it fully departs...

CLEAR

the wind softly and rapidly passes over Clear. He smile remains as the room becomes still and her eyes looks across the room.

CLEAR'S POV - ON THE WALL

is a pencil rubbing, like people take away from the Vietnam veteran's Memorial. The name... "ALEX BROWNING..."

EXT. MT. ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - CLOSE - MONUMENT

"ALEX BROWNING" is marked in the granite. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the name has been added to the memorial, along with Tod Waggner, Valerie Lewton, Terry Chaney and William Hitchcock.

A hand ENTERS FRAME, fingers hover in space before they gently trace over "Terry Chaney." CAMERA ADJUSTS TO REVEAL Carter Horton, staring at the name. Alone, he allows himself the moment to grieve. Carter glances up to find Clear approaching with the baby in the stroller.

Carter straightens and nods, then begins to walk away. He hesitates, then turns back to Clear.

Clear looks up.

Clear smiles. As she takes the baby out of the stroller...

Clear holds baby Alex up to the monument, showing her son his father's name. Carter stands, watching. CAMERA WIDENS to REVEAL the entire monument against the deep blue sky. At the base in readable, but understandable lettering... "FLIGHT 180."

CAMERA HOLDS as "Long May You Run" CONTINUES... RETURNING each of us to the awaiting darkness.
