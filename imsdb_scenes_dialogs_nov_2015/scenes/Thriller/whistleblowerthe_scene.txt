A BOMBED OUT building, sprayed with RED GRAFFITI. DEBRIS

everywhere. Torn clothes. A SIGN. Cyrillic letters:

SARAJEVO - 3 KM.

Sprayed across it in red: TURN AROUND!

A SILHOUETTE breaks the horizon and SPEEDS towards us,

throwing up gravel: a dented white BUS, emblazoned with large

black letters: "UN". A UNITED STATES flag on it.

TITLE CARD: BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA 1999

Kathy sits in a bus full of BLUE BERETS. She looks out the

window, her eyes drinking it all in...

In the opposite direction, a U.S. MILITARY TANK ROLLS past. A

SOLDIER looks out from the HATCH.

Kathy turns to see the only other woman on the bus, Carmen,

20s, Latina. She smiles cheekily, giving Kathy the `peace'

sign. Kathy smiles. IMMEDIATE SOLIDARITY.

In the opposite direction, two other UN BUSES pass, one

flanked by a CANADIAN FLAG, the other with a FRENCH TRICOLOR.

The bus cranks around the corner, entering...

The final stretch into Sarajevo. Famous from so many war

reports, site of many deaths. The broad, pock-marked avenue

is barren. SHELLED HIGH RISES lean like hungry faces, gouged

from their once-solid structures. Living rooms are exposed to

the elements, wallpaper blowing in the wind like torn skin.

IN THE BUS: Carmen taps Kathy, pointing out the window...

All the walls are splattered at head level. Kathy is overcome

by the stark reality of war. Worse than she ever imagined.

MOVE ALONG rapt faces... YOUNG MEN, MIDDLE-AGED MEN, heads

held high, ready for anything. We're in...

BILL HYNES paces before the assembled NEW RECRUITS. He's in

his 50s, distinguished and seemingly in charge...

MOVING OVER more RECRUITS... On their laps, "DYNCORP"

ORIENTATION FOLDERS. MEN, listening, determined...

Kathy and RECRUITS receive TRAINING from a PAKISTANI MONITOR,

shadowing him as he hands food-packs to a LINE of REFUGEES.

The refugees turn their haunted eyes to the fresh faces of

the NEW RECRUITS. Kathy extends a parcel to an OLD MAN. He

hesitates. Then she sees... He has no arms. She's unsure what

to do. A young boy takes the package, leading his grandfather

away. Kathy stands: WHERE AM I?

ASSEMBLY HALL: Bill Hynes stands before a map of the Balkans.

KATHY and THREE NEW RECRUITS are led down a path along a

mountainside. They move toward an UNDERGROUND BUNKER.

CHILDREN play at the edge of an overgrown field.

A BOY hops up on a post, about to jump over, when the leader,

TODD MYERS, 30s, a seasoned pro, YELLS at him, points out...

A sign closer to the BARBED WIRE, fringing the field... A

SKULL AND CROSSBONES. "LANDMINES NOT SWEPT"

Kathy watches the boy run back up the road. The recruits head

down STEEP STEPS into...

Light sneaks through cracks, catching on the oil black

barrels of THOUSANDS of GUNS. Todd hands out BINDERS.

Kathy eyes the unending stash of GUNS.

Kathy drives past a MILITARY BASE, an ITALIAN FLAG flying...

A few hundred yards up the street, a BAR...

BELLA LUNA BAR

Driving past a another BAR. GERMAN FLAG... A SIGN: BERLIN

NIGHTS... Kathy passes by, amused.

Kathy and Carmen are led by a MONITOR through a sparsely

furnished UNIT. A poster of `Born in the USA' on the wall.

Carmen bounces her butt up and down to test her mattress.

Kathy inspects items on the shelves. Nothing familiar.

MOVING POV FROM BUS - EARLIER

A cluster of WOMEN in BLACK BURKAS. They sway like reeds in

the wind, grief overcoming them as they watch:

UN BLUE HELMETS supervise the dig of a mass grave. Bodies are

revealed. A child's shoe is uncovered. A BURLY PEACEKEEPER

turns, sickened.

The bus arrives. The base is surrounded by barbed wire and

overlook sights, manned by ARMED MILITARY.

MEETING HALL: Hynes looks out at the new batch. Proud.

The recruits are hyped, the rhetoric is working. MOVING OVER

THEM, MAN by MAN, we REVEAL in the back:

Kathy. In her crisp navy blue IPTF flack jacket. Her blonde

hair makes her stand out. She is one of the only women in the

room. Her eyes ablaze. She is completely fired up.

Kathy sits at the table spreading stuff on dark bread. Carmen

across from her. Kathy takes a bite and grimaces.

ROCK MUSIC ECHOES from several bars. Carmen heads toward one,

when an AMERICAN IPTF MONITOR stops her.

He points to BIG NEON SIGN: THE INTERNATIONAL BAR. Tiki

lights illuminate a broad patio. A PIG roasts on a spit.

Kathy follows Carmen through DOZENS of off-duty IPTF, SFOR

and UN workers who drink and trade stories with machismo.

There's a palpable sexual tension in the air. BOSNIAN

WAITRESSES flirt with OFFICERS. Guys paw GIRLS with trays.

They make their way through the crowded bar, feeling the

officers' double-takes. Carmen smiles coyly at Kathy, then

zeroes in on JAN VAN DER VELDE, 35, handsome. He is

surrounded by a group of IPTF with Dutch flags on their

shoulders. Carmen throws her arms around them, jovial.

Jan laughs at Carmen's forwardness, his eye on Kathy. But she

spots Todd Myers across the bar, and is on her way, when...

Carmen turns his head toward her.

The others see she's the real deal. Kathy feels good.

Kathy moves through the now-hopping bar. She's ready to

leave. She searches for... Carmen. She's IN A CORNER. Still

with the group of DUTCH OFFICERS.

Kathy approaches, concerned, when Jan cuts her off. He's

watching Carmen, who's teetering, drunk.

Kathy moves past him, irritated. But he grabs her.

Kathy shrugs, it doesn't mean much to her.

Early sun breaks through the fog over the valley.

Kathy tries to work the Bosnian coffee maker, a confusing

relic. Carmen comes in, holding her head.

Kathy smiles, pouring her a cup of the tar-like brew. They

both look at it, a little scared. Kathy eyes the clock.

Industrial plants dominate the skyline of this Sarajevo

suburb. Kathy drives frantically past bombed-out buildings.

Carmen studies a map beside her. They hit A RED LIGHT. And

stop. A GROUP OF MUSLIM WOMEN cross the street. One questions

Kathy with a lingering gaze. Carmen stares at her map...

Kathy shakes her head. No idea.

A run-down prefab office, with dated 80s equipment. A couple

of small offices off the open center.

Kathy and Carmen rush in. An IPTF OFFICER stands waiting for

them... Jan Van Der Velde.

They eye him, embarrassed. He hands them each a thick binder.

He eyes an eager Kathy. Carmen shrugs.

Kathy rushes off, then stops. Jan tosses a set of keys.

She drops the keys, grabs them, and rushes out.

A SCHOOL sprayed with GRAFFITI and BULLETS.

An abandoned CLASSROOM. Shabby corkboards with yellowing PSA

posters, ragged kids' drawings, and tired sticky tape.

Kathy skims through the training binders. The DOOR OPENS and

a GROUP OF LOCAL POLICE file in. They whisper, exchanging

lascivious glances. Kathy straightens her uniform.

Kathy waits for them to take their seats. They don't. A

BOSNIAN WOMAN, pretty, rushes in. Spotting Kathy...

The interpreter shakes her head benignly. They take their

seats. The interpreter looks at Kathy.

Kathy looks out, suddenly daunted. She presses on, opening

her binder as authoritatively as she can.

An older officer, DANIK, stands, defiant.

Full of malice. Kathy puts the sheet away, then...

The cop scoffs, and sits.

Kathy stands in front of a BLACKBOARD with DRAWINGS on a

CRIME SCENE. She crosses off TWO AREAS on the board.

A weak smile. Nothing from the crowd. She trundles on.

Remember you could be           Pamyatayte scho vu bu mholy

stepping on the very evidence   stavatu na scho nam pokazaye

that could incriminate. You     yaka bula nespodivanka. Treba

have to track anything you      vcyo datu v torbu.

bag. We call that 'chain of

evidence.'

Kathy looks out. The cops are barely paying attention. ONE

stubs out a cigarette. Another closes the binder, defiantly.

Kathy leans back, disappointed. She hands him the sheet. They

all sign, apathetic.

Kathy tries to retain a poker face but their indifference

stings. And just as they're about to leave...

The cops eye her, agitated.

Kathy's SUV pulls up behind the cluster of local police cars.

IPTF OFFICER CLARKSON stands outside. He eyes his watch.

Kathy rushes to him, but he's already a foot in the door.

Clarkson leads Kathy and the BOSNIAN POLICE through the hall.

Gurney's and IVs suggest it's a hospital, but you wouldn't

want to be examined here. Some windows are still covered with

wood slats, and paint barely covers old bullet holes. The

floors still hold the stains of old blood.

Clarkson grabs a file, and speaks without looking back...

The cops stare at him, lost. As they file into a SMALL ROOM

filled with tightly drawn curtains. They all squeeze into the

center together. Kathy is pressed against the large cop.

Clarkson pulls back a curtain, revealing...

ZLATA SEHIK, 40, Muslim. Her face is covered with wounds. She

avoids the gaze of the police who stare with contempt. She

pulls her bed-sheet up to her chin as...

He pauses. Looking at Zlata, he moves her sheet up to expose

her leg. Zlata's eyes tear. Clarkson reads...

Kathy looks out at the Bosnian cops, but they stare at the

ground. One cop peeks into the next cubicle. Kathy looks at

Clarkson for a cue. He holds out the clipboard.

No answer. Clarkson looks to Kathy to take control. She turns

to her group, but they have even less respect for her. She

goes to speak, when... VIKO, 25, looks up, hesitant.

The cops turn. Clarkson unclicks his pen. Viko sees Kathy,

hungry for support. But Danik scoffs.

Zlata's face tightens. Viko turns to Danik, angry.... Kathy

looks to Clarkson, who gives her nothing.

The other cops eye Kathy, defiant. This is our turf.

Clarkson ushers the cops out. Kathy catches Viko's eye.

Simpatico. Then follows the other out. Kathy looks back at

Zlata, who lies helpless.

Clarkson leads the group. Kathy pushes up toward him.

Clarkson pulls Kathy aside. Viko stares.

Kathy reddens. The local cops look over.

Kathy blushes, feeling like a chastened schoolgirl.

Kathy sits up in bed reading from her Dyncorp/UN manual. She

flicks, not finding what she's looking for. Carmen comes out

of her room, dolled up for the evening.

Kathy has dinner with Carmen, who talks away. Kathy watches

the world go by. She notices an OLDER, LARGE IPTF MONITOR

walking with his arm around a YOUNG GIRL, 16, dressed in a

short skirt. Kathy turns back to Carmen who is still talking.

Chanting echoes from the SINANOVA HOUSE of the Dervish Order.

Viko comes in, scanning over IPTF MONITORS. Spotting Kathy.

Viko lays down a pile of files. Zlata's picture on top.

Kathy isn't sure. She looks around, almost guiltily...

Kathy looks at him, struck by the truth of this. She takes

the files, flipping through them. Thinking...

A HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, who hands Viko a stack of files.

Kathy sits in a UN SUV. Viko watches as she goes through

Zlata's hospital files. She's encouraged.

Viko and Kathy sit behind a pile of Legal Books. Viko shows

Kathy a page, a questioning look on his face.

Viko turns to see a LIBRARIAN at the main desk.

Viko sits behind Zlata and COUNSEL while a JUDGE rules.

Viko and Zlata wait... then breathe relief. They won. Viko

turns TO THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM: Kathy smiles, at last

feeling they can really accomplish something.

Kathy comes inside, interrupting Jan and FRANZ, Dutch IPTF.

Franz excuses himself, eyeing a tense Kathy. Jan closes the

door behind Franz, turning to Kathy. All business.

Kathy rushes out, worried. Jan smiles, in on a secret.

Kathy sits alone in the office. Degrees, plaques, and awards

cover the walls. Pictures of Madeleine Rees with Kofi Annan,

Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela... Kathy is intimidated.

MADELEINE REES, 50s, tall, commanding, short blonde hair,

British. She sashays in with a DOBERMAN on a leash.

Kathy eyes the malevolent hound.

Madeleine sits. Kathy straightens.

Kathy takes it in. Madeleine looks out the window at TWO

GLASS TOWERS that punctuate Sarajevo's skyline.

Kathy is taken aback.

This is everything Kathy came to do...

Kathy paces, phone to her ear. Her suitcase open, she's

packing at the same time. Carmen helps.

Kathy stops pacing.

Kathy pulls the phone close, listening. Carmen eyes her.

Kathy goes over to a computer, clicking open an EMAIL. ON THE

SCREEN: A PICTURE OF ERIN in a PROM DRESS. Kathy sits back,

flushed with emotion. Her enthusiasm complicated by the

realization of what she's missing back home. Softly...

Carmen helps Kathy load boxes and suitcases into an SUV.

They hug. Kathy smiles, and hops into the car.

Kathy drives into the CITY CENTRE.

Kathy puts the last box down. She steps out onto the balcony.

Looks out at Sarajevo, city of survivors, her new home.

Member nations' flags slap in the wind. Hundreds of UN SUVs.

Kathy drives up. She takes in the huge building. Almost in

disbelief that she's part of it, at the center of it all.

The modern lobby buzzes with UN OFFICIALS and DIPLOMATS.

Kathy follows RICK JONES, 30s, athletic, crisp.

They walk through two large doors into... The Inner Sanctum.

Rick and Kathy round a corner to a medium-sized office, boxes

everywhere. Rick eyes the... mess.

Kathy nods, taking in the disarray. Dust sits on the stacks

of boxes, on papers and files strewn about.

He leaves her. Kathy runs her eye over the place. The reality

of her office less exalted than she imagined. But she's

raring to go. She eyes a name plate:

KATHRYN BOLKOVAC - HEAD OF GENDER AFFAIRS.

Kathy stands in her office doorway, glancing up the hall.

THE HALL is empty. The EXIT door at the end swings shut in

the flickering fluorescent light.

Black cobbles. Merchants line the narrow pathways. Open-

doored cafes serve coffee to UNEMPLOYED YOUTH. Kathy and Jan

walk along. He's delighted. She's restrained.

He grabs her by the hand, ducking into a SMALL ARCHWAY. A

NARROW PASSAGE opens up onto a charming restaurant.

Kathy and Jan sit at a table, watching a WAITRESS put down a

carraffe of wine and 'Cevapcici' (lamb dish).

The waitress reaches across Kathy with a plate. Winks at Jan.

The waitress eyes him coyly. Kathy studies the exchange.

The waitress leaves. Kathy shakes her head, amused.

Kathy is watching the waitress hit up another table.

He grins. Kathy looks at him, unsettled by the chemistry

between them.

Rick introduces Kathy to various IPTF and UN colleagues.

Kathy stacks unpacked boxes out of the way. She organizes a

BIG BULLETIN BOARD into 12 CANTONS.

Kathy follows an IPTF monitor, BARRY, 30s, Irish past the

front of a UN BUS. A DOZEN MUSLIM WOMEN disembark and look

up, their hands over their mouths, keening.

IPTF MONITORS help with unloading battered suitcases and

belongings. THREE carry a couch up the steps of a building as

a YOUNG BROTHER and SISTER watch. Standing back, an ELDERLY

WOMAN weeps in disbelief as the monitors lay final touches on

makeshift storm windows on her aparment.

Kathy watches, Barry by her side.

Kathy shakes her head. The women enter the building, their

past lives in shards at their feet. One WOMAN, 40s, stands

numb, a bundle of books in her arms, tears running down her

face, as her TEENAGE SON beckons her to come in the DOOR.

Kathy nods, moved.

Another FIELD OFFICER rushes up. An urgent look on his face.

The field officer leads Barry and Kathy round a corner, to...

A YOUNG GIRL nearly passed out on the couch. Her face bloody

and swollen. Kathy runs up to the girl, who can barely sit

up. Softly waking her. The girl comes to, taking in her

surroundings, and...

JUMPS UP. An unmistakable look in her eyes. TERROR.

Kathy eyes the field worker. He shrugs, lost. Kathy turns

back to the girl, and slowly places a hand on her shoulder.

The girl flinches, then inches back... shaking her head.

But the girl holds out her hands, stopping Kathy. She looks

around, completely disoriented. Desperately searching for an

exit. She eyes them all, realizing she's surrounded and

then... SHE WAILS.

Losing control. Slapping at all of them. Kathy moves to her,

trying -- gently -- to hold her tight. The girl sobs.

Hopelessness in her eyes. And then...

Kathy drives up a winding mountain road, checking directions

on a hand-drawn map. A LOCAL POLICE CAR swerves by in the

opposite direction.

Kathy's SUV throws up gravel. Out her windscreen, she sees

THE FLORIDA BAR: A dilapidated two story building, painted a

garish pink. Crude palm trees painted on the side.

Kathy jumps out of her SUV, and moves towards...

LOCAL POLICE smoke by POLICE CARS.

A LOCAL COP leads a CLUSTER of YOUNG WOMEN out the door. They

blink in the glaring light, pale, out of place, lost...

At the end of the line, is Luba. Her eyes darting between

Kathy and the Local Cops, helpless.

Kathy rushes towards the cop. He eyes her, dubious.

He moves past her, with the Girls in tow.

SHOUTING ECHOES from inside the bar. TWO COPS drag out TANJO

ZRAVBIC, 50s. He sees Kathy's uniform and SHOUTS at her.

The cops SHOVE Tanjo in a car, and SLAM the door. Kathy turns

to the Local Cop, standing with the group of girls.

Fred seems confused. Kathy pulls out a clipboard.

Kathy looks over as the girls are put into a van.

The Local Cops start to move, stubbing out cigarettes,

getting in cars. The Local Cop shuts the doors of the van.

He shrugs and smiles. Kathy hears the POLICE VAN's engine

start. Turning to it...

She rushes after the van. Fred eyes Kathy confer with the Van

driver. He and the other Monitor, drive off.

Kathy is left alone in the silence. She turns to the bar.

Kathy moves inside. The place is rank and dingy. A small

stage with a POLE in the centre. Tables fanned out around it.

CUT WIRES hang over the stage.

THE BAR AREA

Is filled with PHOTOS: YOUNG GIRLS in various poses with men,

IPTF SOLDIERS. They range from the illicit to the obscene.

Kathy stops on a photo of a NAKED GIRL on stage holding the

two open wires over her head. Behind her, SOLDIERS applaud.

Kathy takes down the photo, horrified. Turns it over.

Scrawled in marker: SARAJEVO FIRECRACKER!

She turns to the stage. Plugs in one of the wires. A HUZZ of

electricity. Tiny sparks fly.

She turns, and under the bar sees... A SAFE, SMASHED OPEN. A

handful of U.S. bills scattered about. And...

PASSPORTS. Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish. All for young girls.

She gathers them, surprised, and stuffs them into her file.

Her eyes are drawn to a back wall. She stops at a panelled

door. And pushes. It opens onto...

STEPS: She shines her flashlight up the dark passage...

The BEAM of the flashlight finds a DOOR. A glint off metal...

At the door handle, a large PADLOCK, smashed open. Kathy

darts the beam over the other TWO DOORS... both equipped with

PADLOCKS. Smashed.

Kathy pushes through the first door into...

Kathy's flashlight over: Hanging BEDSHEETS separate the room

into cubicles. Putrid mattresses. Condoms on the floor.

Her eye catches MARKINGS UNDER A MATTRESS. She pulls it away.

And sees GIRLS' NAMES scratched into the floor... Under each

name, etched in, a list of amounts: 50, 100, 30, 200, 20...

Some kind of RECORD.

Kathy PULLS back other mattresses. Dust. Some FAMILY PHOTOS.

And... a ragged PIECE OF PAPER: Crude drawings of sexual

positions. A NUMBER by each one: $20, $30, $50, $100, $200...

The amounts correspond exactly with the table on the floor.

Kathy looks around, sickened.

A run-down Community Center nestled in a shabby area outside

the city. It's completely unassuming. From the outside, you

might think it was abandoned.

The shelter is a converted gymnasium. Peeling wallpaper. Long-

forgotten notices from before the war, postcards. Patchy

linoleum curls at the edges. A soft hum. Voices in rooms that

Kathy can't see. She walks down the hall with MILENA, 40s,

Bosnian, down-to-earth, forthright.

Kathy stares at her, taken aback.

Milena hands over a medical report.

Milena pushes through a door. To a DARK HALLWAY...

Hanging bulbs flicker intermittently. They walk. Avoiding

dripping leaks in the roof.

They pass an EATING AREA. TEEN GIRLS sit, pick at food, chain-

smoke and flip through magazines. They are clean, but weak.

Milena looks at her. Blank.

UNMHQ stands over the crumbling red roofs of Sarajevo. In the

foreground, a CEMETERY packed with crooked wooden crosses.

Kathy walks in. Carmen sits behind a desk, piled with files.

Carmen nods, and clicks on her computer.

Kathy thinking. Something's not adding up.

Kathy walks. MONITORS greet her as she passes. She reaches an

OFFICE, and knocks.

FIVE local MEN in fatigues scan the field slowly with hand-

held minesweepers. One MAN holds up his hand as his device

BEEPS. At the edge of the field, Fred Murray blows a whistle.

Everybody else STOPS. The man bends down, as all wait...

Kathy approaches from the road, behind a fence. Fred smiles.

Kathy looks out, suddenly aware of the dangerous situation.

ANOTHER WHISTLE BLOWS. Fred turns to the field.

Before she can answer, Fred is moving down the field. She

watches him go.

Kathy and Milena lead Raya and Irka out to her SUV.

A stark contrast, the GDA is a new and shining edifice.

Kathy's SUV pulls up front.

Kathy and the girls sit in the waiting area. The place is

modern, western... corporate. In platinum base relief over

the reception desk:

GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY.

The LOBBY. Magazines on a coffee table. The wall adorned with

a HUGE FRAMED POSTER of a young girl in a spiderweb. A

caption: "TRAFFIKU ZHINOK YE SPRAV. 1999"

Kathy scans the hall. Endless posters. 1998, 1997, 1996...

LAURA LEVIN, 30s, American, groomed, business-like, comes

around the corner. Her ASSISTANT, 20s, leads the girls away.

Laura nods. Something still on Kathy's mind...

Kathy eyes the girls down the hall. Raya turns, a last look.

Kathy starts her car. She pulls out, turning left. Then,

cranks the wheel right.

Kathy's UN SUV swerves along the serpentine mountain road.

Laura in her office. HIGH MODERNITY. She works through her

files. Opening one with Raya's photo on top. She dials.

The phone is ringing. Halyna rushes to it. Out of breath...

Halyna falls into a chair, her chest heaving relief.

Kathy pulls up to a PARKING LOT full of CARS and UN SUVs.

MUSIC spills out. BACK IN BUSINESS. She gets out of the SUV,

moving inside...

Kathy in the doorway. The place is dark but lit by lamps

along the walls. MUSIC pumps. The place is hopping. A

scantily-clad GIRL dances on the stage, her body writhing but

her eyes dead. Along the edges, girls - the very SAME GIRLS

Kathy saw released at the raid - 'socialize' with customers.

Many of the CUSTOMERS... in IPTF UNIFORMS, others with off-

duty IPTF SWEATSHIRTS, and INTERNATIONALS in civilian

casuals. A few LOCALS at the bar, where...

Tanjo commands the scene, cheery, chatting with an IPTF

OFFICER at the bar.

Kathy stands, frozen , until she catches the eye of...

Luba, sitting on the knee of a MIDDLE-AGED IPTF Officer.

Kathy is filled with... anger.

Kathy SPEEDS up the mountain roads. Past many bars. One after

another, after another... All filled with UN SUVs. Groups of

drunk OFFICERS spill out. She stops across from one, seeing:

Jan coming out of the bar. Kathy watches, stunned...

Jan helps a drunk friend pile into an SUV. He looks up and

sees Kathy as a car beam slides over her. She pulls away.

Kathy stands on the balcony. Taking in the cold air. A KNOCK.

Kathy stands, quiet.

Kathy waits a moment, breathing...

Kathy paces as Jan struggles for words.

He looks at her, hurt - He cares what she thinks. Kathy sees

this. Something she hasn't felt in so long... Needed.

She looks at him, fighting the urge to trust him. Jan brushes

a strand of hair from her face. She lets go. He pulls her in.

Jan and Kathy in front of her computer. They're on an IPTF

MESSAGE BOARD: Flashes of Various Posts: New Girl at the

Berlin Bar; New Twelve Year-Old Pussy at the Old Grill.

They scroll down dozens of posts. Kathy looks at Jan, shaken

by the banal malevolence of a boys club gone wild.

Kathy watches Jan, asleep in her bed.

Fog hangs low over the waking valley of Sarajevo.

A DOCTOR signs off on a final examination of a now much

healthier looking Raya. He smiles. She signs a form.

Laura hovers in the background as Raya dials the phone. Her

face raw with emotion.

The phone in the hall rings. But no one is there to answer.

Halyna at the door. Zenia pales. O.S. A kettle whistles.

KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Zenia pours tea out of a chrome kettle. Her hands shake.

Halyna stares at a new dishwasher. Then a microwave, blender

and small LCD TV. Suspiciously out of context in Kyiv.

Zenia looks up, unsure.

Zenia nods, keeping still as possible.

Zenia chokes on her tea. Conflicted between love and guilt.

She wants so badly to say... but she can't.

Kathy watches Rick flip through her report.

He drops the papers.

Raya and Irka sit across from Laura Levin. She slides a

document over to each of them.

Raya looks at her, but Irka doesn't look back.

Kathy stares out across the central courtyard. Into the

adjoining building. Through the glass, she watches...

Fred Murray leading NEW RECRUITS through the halls. He jokes

around, as the OFFICERS eye him with respect.

The PHONE RINGS. Kathy turns.

Kathy stands in disbelief. Laura is stern.

Laura shrugs, resigned.

Kathy sits across from Raya. A TRANSLATOR to the side,

translates as Raya speaks.

Raya is stopped by a rush of tears. Kathy reaches for her

hand. Looking at this girl, so young...

Raya looks Kathy squarely in the face. She slides the photo

of Murray toward her.

Raya nods.

Raya sobs, knowing she has betrayed the system. Betting her

life on the hope that this system won't betray her.

Milena leads Kathy through the halls.

MONTAGE:

Kathy sits with GIRL after GIRL. Listening to their stories.

Writing furiously...

Kathy interviews EVA, 16. She talks through grateful tears.

Kathy with a different girl, FADILA, 17.

Another girl, JASMILA, 18 - stunning, with haunted eyes.

Yet another, NADIA, 14, nodding.

Kathy wasn't expecting that. Nadia throws down a photo.

Nadia lifts up her sweatshirt, revealing a long scar.

Kathy inspects the photo: Nadia with a SOUTH AMERICAN and

U.S. IPTF: Their arms around her. One licks her face.

Kathy eyes Nadia... Silently in awe of her strength.

Kathy pins Nadia's photo on a large bulletin board. Steps

back. The wall is covered in photos of girls.

Kathy reaches for the phone. Dials.

Kathy sits back, relieved.

Kathy stands before Rick's desk. He smiles at her, convivial.

Rick scrambles for words, but Kathy's not finished.

Kathy lays her stack of files on the desk.

Kathy is stopped.

The markets shut down. The Catholic Church Bells ring. Across

the square the Call to Prayer echoes from old loudspeakers`.

Jan stirs a pan. Kathy awkwardly cuts vegetables beside him.

Jan can't help noticing that Kathy is making a mess of the

vegetables. He takes the knife. She walks away, preoccupied.

She turns, glass of wine in hand, leaning on the counter.

She puts down her glass of wine, irritated.

She looks at him, seeing... It's not discouragement. It's

love.

Kathy gets an idea.

A crumbling edifice, once home to the world's finest, now a

reminder of humanity's worst. INSIDE...

Kathy walks with Madeleine, who unleashes Helen the hound.

Kathy hands Madeleine the files. She flips through.

Madeleine nods. The dog comes bounding back.

Madeleine grins, proud.

Kathy weaves around the corner of a dimly lit, shabby

hallway. She arrives at a doorway: VEHICLE DISPATCH.

Kathy talks to LEWIS, 20s, American.

Lewis looks at her, almost laughing.
