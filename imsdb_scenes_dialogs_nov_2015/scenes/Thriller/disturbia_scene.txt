Another GUARDRAIL BEAM UPROOTS --

CU - Jeff's left hand enters frame, clasps Kale's. Another

beat of eyes on eyes. The guardrail continues to BUCKLE.

Then -- Jeff starts to PRY KALE'S HAND AWAY --

Jeff's arm RELEASES FROM KALE'S GRIP.    Kale opens his mouth

to scream as a shrill bell RINGS!

ON THE RINGING BELL. STUDENTS disappear into their respective

classrooms. As the corridor quiets down...

SUPER: ONE YEAR LATER

ON RONNIE YUN, 16, a scrawny Korean kid with a knack for

perfect Spanish, stands at the front giving his speech.

Note: every time Ronnie says "quizas" ("perhaps") the class

giggles because it sounds a lot like "kiss-ass."

The teacher, SENOR GUTIERREZ, a rotund 50, bad comb-over and

khakis up to his naval, stands off to the side, quickly

picking up on Ronnie's excessive and increasingly dramatic

use of the word.

Over this, only one GIRL, MINNIE TYCO, a rail-thin BLONDE,

picks up on this:

The class laughs, claps.    Ronnie bows, heads to his seat.

The class laughs again. Gutierrez shakes his head, zeros in

on the student behind Ronnie. Sleeping with his arms folded

on his desk, a grey hoodie pulled over his head.

Senor Gutierrez takes some chalk, flicks it at the kid.       He

still doesn't budge. Ronnie nudges him.

The kid stirs, raises his head. The hoodie falls away to

reveal KALE. Longer, disheveled hair. The spark in his

eye's been replaced with an empty haze.

Kale glances around. All eyes on him. He looks at Ronnie

who nods in support. Kale gets up, heads to the front of

the class. He pauses. Trying to focus. Then --

The class chuckles.

Kale shuts his eyes, frustrated at the interruption. Senor

Gutierrez, also losing patience, steps closer to Kale.

Kale CLOCKS Gutierrez.

ON SENOR GUTIERREZ - displaying a black eye, sitting next to

the school's PRINCIPAL and COUNSELOR in a single row of seats

behind the attorneys' tables.

Kale, a little more cleaned up, wearing a suit, sits between

Julie and his DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

Julie, noticeably tired, glances at her son, her expression

a fusion of anger and sympathy. Kale's eyes shift her way,

but his head never turns. The JUDGE mulls over his notes...

Kale's lawyer prompts him to stand.

The judge lets that sink in.       Kale remains silent.

Julie closes her eyes in relief.

The judge taps his gavel.

A pair of hands wrap an ELECTRONIC MONITORING      BRACELET around

Kale's left ankle. WIDER TO REVEAL the hands       belong to Kale's

case officer, JANET PARKER, 35, no-nonsense.       Kale's perched

on the center island. Julie watches from the       b.g.

As Parker clicks the bracelet's buckle into place, a GREEN

LED light illuminates. It's ON THE TOP EDGE OF THE BRACELET'S

BAND so Kale can easily see it if he looks down. Next to

this light is an additional RED LIGHT that isn't on.

Parker points to a big black box (the CENTRAL TRACKING UNIT)

on the kitchen counter.

Kales sits in his video game chair, wearing his X-box live

headset, playing HALO 2 -- he's on the final "boss level."

GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS BLARE over his stereo speakers.

The TV SCREEN suddenly GLITCHES.

The screen goes black. The XBOX LIVE LOGO APPEARS along

with the words: SERVER ERROR. Kale throws the headset aside,

makes sure all the wires are connected. Checks the TV screen.

Same thing.

Kale glares at the screen another beat, then gets up, wanders

out of his room...

Kale slowly heads down the stairs, rounds the corner into...

Kale runs into Julie who wears a black blouse and slacks,

the required uniform of the steakhouse she works at. She's

just thrown a couple of microwave dinners on the kitchen

table. She's scrambling around, eating a couple bites,

gathering her things...

Kale sits at the table, picks through his food.

She heads O.S. for a beat, comes back in with her apron and

purse, sets them on the counter. Eyes her watch, sits at

the table, takes a couple more quick bites. Then --

Julie can't help but crack a little smile:

Kale looks back up. He's not smiling. Whatever chance we

had of a lighter conversation panning out here quickly

fizzles. Another beat, then -- Julie pushes her chair back,

heads to the counter, grabs her apron and purse.

Julie leaves. Kale glances around the kitchen.       A mess of

dirty dishes, stacks of paper... screw that.

Kale, looking disheveled and very perplexed, now has his TV

pulled out from the wall. He's behind it, meticulously

checking and re-connecting all the wires and ethernet cable.

Carefully studying the manual as he goes.

He blows on the Halo 2 CD, wipes it down with his sweatshirt,

gently puts it in the tray, giving us the idea this might

not be his first attempt at this.

He powers up the Xbox, grabs a controller... so far, so

good... he scrolls through the screens, a little hope

returning... SERVER ERROR.

Kale throws a mini-fit, slams the controller to the floor.

Rips the controller cord out of the XBOX --

A few stray beams of sunlight pierce the blinds. Otherwise,

it's a tomb. Clothes strewn everywhere. We TRACK ACROSS

the floor and a virtual DEBRIS FIELD of junk food bags,

wrappers, Mountain Dew cans... find Kale in bed, ankle and

bracelet stick out from the sheets, arm hangs over the side --

Still a mess as we find Kale, hair disheveled, rummaging

through the cabinets. Lots of Costco-size boxes: crackers,

Pringles... a HUGE BOX OF TWINKIES. Kale spots a jar of

peanut butter. He grabs the nearest bowl, pulls a bottle of

Hershey's syrup from the fridge, pours it all into the bowl.

He's about to throw the syrup bottle in the trash when

something in the bottom of the can catches his eye. He

reaches in, pulls out a bill for XBOX LIVE: SUBSCRIPTION

CANCELED.

Kale lounges in on the couch watching "The Price is Right"

as he spoons the peanut butter from the jar, dips it in the

bowl of chocolate syrup, devours it. Brings up a two-liter

of Mountain Dew, takes a big swig to wash it down.

Kale belches as he raises his spoon, saluting the screen.

Then, after a beat, a look of grave concern crosses his face --

The toilet flushes O.S. Kale opens the door, leans against

the frame, spent. He stands there a beat, absorbing the

silence of the house. He eyes a door at the end of the hall.

CU - the doorknob. Kale's hand enters frame, slowly turns

it. Click. Kale pushes. The door CREAKS open to reveal

DAD'S OFFICE

Hardwood floor.    Ornate, cherry wood desk.     Plush leather

chairs. Quiet.

ON THE DESK -- dad's reading glasses sit on a stack of papers

next to an antique typewriter.

THE WALLS -- adorned with framed, poster-size covers of Dad's

books - non-fiction, true account titles: WHISTLEBLOWER -

The Inside Story of a Real Corporate Insider; THE SENATOR'S

SHADOWS: How Eight Men Conspired to Control One.

ON ANOTHER WALL -- a family portrait of Jeff, Julie, and

Kale - age six; Jeff at a book signing, smiling wide...

Kale takes it all in from the doorway. His feet never once

cross into the room. His eyes say everything. Loss, anger,

regret. He gently pulls the door shut.

Kale samples some rap clips on I-tunes.    Likes what he's

hearing.

ON THE SCREEN - Kale moves the cursor to "buy song." The

account screen pops up. Kale types his password.

After a beat, bold red letters pop up: "THE APPLE ID OR

PASSWORD YOU ENTERED WAS INVALID OR INCORRECT..." Kale types

it again. Same thing. Then -- like we all do to be sure,

Kale types his password at a rate of ONE KEY PER SECOND.

Same thing. Kale fumes, smelling a rat.

The shades are drawn. Kale's door is closed. Find Kale

looking utterly miserable, lounging in bed watching "Bikini

Destinations" on HD NET. Julie enters wearing a business

suit and name badge emblazoned with the RE/MAX LOGO. Kale

quickly changes the channel to the local news.

Kale points to the TV showing a photo of a smiling PATRICIA

WALSH, VIBRANT, FLOWING RED HAIR - "MISSING" keyed in

underneath.

Julie shoots him a look, then rips open the blinds.      Sunlight

pours in. She gathers trash off the floor.

Kale turns to Julie who suddenly drops a pile of Kale's

clothes on the floor in front of him.

Julie goes to the TV, UNPLUGS IT.

Julie suddenly yanks a pair of scissors off Kale's desk and

SNIPS THE POWER CORD IN HALF.

Julie picks up her keys and briefcase, pecks Kale on the

forehead, leaves.

Kale furiously stuffs clothes in the washer, blindly cranks

the knob, presses start.

Kale SHOVELS dishes and glasses into the dishwasher, breaking

a couple as he goes. He pours half the box of Cascade in

the dispenser, kicks the door up and closed, cranks the knob.

Kale sits on his bed, staring into space. He eyes the clock.

Tick tick tick... We hear KIDS PLAYING IN THE STREET O.S.

Kale glances out the window.

HIS POV - Kids on bikes, NEIGHBORS out on walks... ahh...

the sights and sounds of summer... And Kale's not invited.

He glares down at his ankle bracelet. It glares back.

Kale sits on the floor as he spreads a line of Elmer's glue

across the bottom of a Twinkie. He's just completed the

first couple of floors of what will be... TWINKIE TOWER.

Kale, on cell, sits in his video game chair painting his toe

nails.

Kale tosses the phone and the nail polish aside. Sits there

in silence for a beat. Then eyes a racketball on the floor.

Picks it up. Starts mindlessly bouncing it against the

wall... and keeps bouncing it... and keeps bouncing it...

Kale reclines in his chair, now FURIOUSLY SWATTING the

racketball against the wall -- with a racket. We PULL BACK

to reveal SCUFF MARKS on the walls and CEILING where Kale

has figured out the exact points to hit it allowing him to

bounce the ball off multiple walls and return it perfectly

to his hand. He SWATS it... and SWATS it...

Kale's passed out in his chair, the racket still in his hand.

He's about to fall out of the chair when a loud BANG O.S.

JOLTS him awake.

Kale goes to the window, tilts his head, trying to see where

the noise is coming from.

KALE'S POV - He's able to make out some bits of movement

next door, but his VIEW is OBSTRUCTED by the architecture of

his house.

Kale steps back from the window, studies it a beat -- then

opens it, slowly sticks his head out.

HIS   POV - A U-HAUL TRUCK comes into view. It's backed into

the   driveway next door. ALAN NORRIS, 43, appears from inside

the   truck's cab, carrying a moving box. He hands it down to

his   wife, BONNIE, 42, who walks back in the house.

Kale's about to pull his head in when another PERSON comes

out of the moving truck. She's carrying a box that's

obscuring her face as she carefully negotiates the incline

of the moving truck's ramp.

But her blonde hair and perfect legs look to be about 17.

We'll soon know her as ASHLEY, the Norris' daughter.

She reaches the end of the ramp. Bends over to retrieve

another smaller box, her back and ass to Kale who stares in

utter disbelief. Ashley stacks the boxes, picks them up and

heads into the house, her face still a mystery.

Kale watches her go.   Mesmerized. Suddenly, the DOORBELL

RINGS O.S. Kale snaps to, yanks his head back in -- and

KERBONGS it on the underside of the window. He drops to the

floor.

Kale staggers to his feet...

More doorbell RINGING.       Kale heads down the stairs to the

front door.

Kale swings the door open to see -- A BURNING PAPER BAG on

the welcome mat.

Kale instinctively STOMPS ON IT with his SOCKED FEET!

Kale frantically hops around, looking for a hose, bucket,

anything wet -- but the flames are already out. Kale looks

down, finally realizes this -- but there's another problem --

his socks are smothered in SLIMY DOG SHIT.

We hear GIGGLING O.S. Kale glances up as two neighborhood

BRATS on bikes emerge from their hiding place behind a shrub

across the street. They high five each other.

Kale glares -- then heads down the steps into...

Kale walks briskly, menacingly toward them --

The Brats grow more concerned, back away as Kale draws closer--

KALE CHARGES THEM!

The brats pedal away. Kale races through the sprinkler,

crossing his yard into the far corner of Ashley's, trying to

cut the Brats off as they race down...

The chase is on.   Kale increases his speed.   Almost catching

up to them --

Kale overhears, stops cold.   He glances to the ANKLE BRACELET:

FLASHING RED LIGHT.

Kale races back down the street, his shit-stained feet leaving

tracks as he goes. He cuts through Ashley's yard again,

yelling at the bracelet all the way--

Kale races by ASHLEY'S PARENTS, leaps back into...

EXT. KALE'S FRONT YARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS

He looks at the bracelet. Still FLASHING RED. He hops up

and down as the SPRINKLER STREAMS approach him from behind.

He spins back toward the house, runs SMACK into the STREAMS,

trips on the sprinkler, falls on his face. Now his foot's

tangled in the sprinkler. Spraying water all over him.

Kale's foot jiggles the sprinkler free. He then sees the

ankle bracelet: GREEN LIGHT.

He gazes over: ASHLEY'S PARENTS, EACH WITH A MOVING BOX,

STAND THERE, JAWS DROPPED. BOTH TAKE A NERVOUS STEP BACKWARD

as ASHLEY steps out the front door. Freezes at the sight of

the sopping wet, shit-and-grass-stained Kale. Kale locks

eyes with her. Then smiles and waves.

Then -- SIRENS WAIL. Kale turns to the street: TWO POLICE

CARS SCREECH TO A STOP. Kale loses the smile.

ON KALE - pacing, on cell phone, pressing an ice-filled

Ziplock back to his head.

Kale flips the phone shut, collapses to the bed --

PRELAP - The doorbell RINGS.

Kale, his Louisville Slugger firmly in hand, groggily heads

to the door, swings it open. COURIER. With papers.

Over this, Kale yanks the envelope away, SLAMS the door in

the guy's face. Kale heads away. The doorbell RINGS.

Kale opens the door, grabs the courier's clipboard, signs

his name, SLAMS THE DOOR EVEN HARDER.

ON KALE'S FEET - entering frame, inching their way through

the yard...

ON THE BRACELET - The green light suddenly goes out, red

light FLASHES. Kale's foot quickly steps back. GREEN LIGHT.

A beat, then --

A SMILING GARDEN GNOME SLAMS DOWN INTO FRAME.

WIDER - Kale ties kite string around the gnome's hat, then

unspools it across the yard to a waiting croquet mallet

already hammered into the ground. He pulls the string taut

and ties it off.

We PULL BACK to REVEAL Kale's emerging KITE STRING PERIMETER --

a crude SEMI-CIRCULAR ARC around the yard tied off at

different points using makeshift "stakes" -- gnomes, mallets,

shovels, screwdrivers...

Same "BOUNDARY CONSTRUCTION" here. Kale shoves a screwdriver

into the ground a few feet shy of his mailbox. He ties some

string to it as he glances over to the other neighbors' (the

PILCH's) yard, sees their black Labra-doodle watching him.

The dog trots toward Kale. It almost reaches his outstretched

hand when it suddenly gets ZAPPED by the underground electric

fence. It YELPS away. Spins back around, sits and stares.

OVER KALE'S SHOULDER IN THE B.G. - ASHLEY

lifts more boxes from the back of their station wagon. She

sets them on the drive, SLAMS the liftgate. Kale turns

around. Ashley throws him a quick glance, then heads around

the back of her house. Kale stares after her.

CU - The doorknob. Kale's hand enters frame, slowly turns

it. Click. Kale pushes.

Kale stands in the doorway. He takes a moment, considering

what he's about to do. Then -- HIS FOOT steps inside. He

goes to the window, gently pulls the blind up to reveal the

BACK OF ASHLEY'S HOUSE

He peers down, sees Ashley and her mom standing by the

swimming pool. Ashley disappears through the back door.

Kale tilts his head up, curiously gazing through the pair of

OPEN WINDOWS on the SECOND FLOOR of Ashley's house.

HIS POV - ASHLEY'S BEDROOM

Unmade bed, stacks of open moving boxes, poster frames waiting

to be hung... Kale squints, steps closer.

ASHLEY

enters the room. Digging clothes from boxes, stuffing them

in her dresser, then -- she pulls her hair back, yanks off

her t-shirt, revealing a black bra.

ON KALE - he continues to watch as Ashley digs a towel out

of a moving box, and, with her back to us, pulls off the bra

and disappears into the bathroom. Off Kale --

The front door swings open to reveal Ronnie, DV camera in

hand. He's wearing aviator shades, half a dozen leis and a

hawaiian shirt.

REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL KALE - now with a patchy stubble,

wearing a bathrobe and a SHRUNKEN t-shirt that used to be

white but is now LIGHT PINK. He holds his bat in one hand,

quart of Haagen Dazs in the other. He smiles, hugs Ronnie.

Tight -- and not letting go --

Kale leads Ronnie up the stairs and to the window...

Kale gestures out the window.       Ronnie looks out. They peer

down to the Pilch's backyard.       A Ford Escort is in the drive.

Besides that, all's quiet.

The Pilch's dog darts out the back door -- then --

Over the above, Mrs. Pilch, wearing an unflattering tennis

skirt, exits the house. The dog hops around her as she waves

back to her heavy set, male maid, LONNIE, 35.

Kale and Ronnie watch as Mrs. Pilch heads down the walkway,

meets her rail-thin 50-ish female tennis PARTNER at the curb.

As they walk away, the dog tries to follow but gets ZAPPED

by the electric fence and YELPS back into the house.

A white mercedes pulls in the driveway.    MR. PILCH, 63, gets

out, carrying briefcase and flowers.

RONNIE AND KALE'S POV - TILTING UP TO THE PILCH'S BEDROOM

WINDOW - Lonnie vacuums as Mr. Pilch enters the room behind

him. Mr. Pilch flips off the light switch, cutting the

power to the vacuum. Lonnie startles, turns around, sees

Pilch standing there with the flowers and a big smile.

A beat, then -- Lonnie jumps in Pilch's arms, kissing him

passionately.

Kale slaps his hand over Ronnie's mouth. Ronnie pulls away,

reaches in his pocket, yanks out his ASTHMA INHALER and takes

a hit. Then --

As Kale heads away:

Kale leads Ronnie to the window. Ronnie takes in the mess

in Kale's room -- the scuff marks on the walls, the completed

TWINKIE TOWER. He glances to the desk, sees a penciled

GEOMETRIC DIAGRAM of Kale's line-of-sight spying theory --

shit, Kale wasn't lying -- he did do the math.

KALE AND RONNIE'S POV - In the yard across from Kale's back

yard, find ROBERT GILES, gassing up his lawnmower in the

driveway. He's early 40's, clean-cut, fit, decent looking.

He closes the garage door via remote, then fires up the mower,

pushes it around the side of his house toward the front yard.

Kale slowly pushes on the door. It creaks open. Kale tilts

his head, listening. Then -- SPLASH!! Kale smiles.

Kale leads Ronnie to the window.

KALE AND RONNIE'S POV - ASHLEY swims underwater the length

of the pool. She finally surfaces in all her two-piece glory.

They watch as Ashley steps out of the pool, towels off. She

pulls her bikini from her butt, lies in the lounge chair.

Off Kale, considering --

ON KALE - now clean-shaven, sitting on the front steps. He

eyes his watch, then stretches his neck. Yawns. Then he

sees something O.S.

KALE'S POV - peering down the street, Ashley's stationwagon

rounds the corner --

Kale hops to his feet, quickly fixes his hair as the

stationwagon draws closer.

Kale casually strides into the yard, approaching the kite

string boundary and mailbox. Then -- keeping his feet planted

in what looks to be a very practiced maneuver, he suddenly

falls forward against the mailbox. Reaches around with his

free hand, opens the door, going to grab the mail inside

just as

ASHLEY

pulls the car into and up the drive.    She glances at Kale

who nods and smiles back.

As the stationwagon heads up the driveway, Kale tries to

push himself upright -- but his feet SLIP. He pitches forward

more. He glances back over his shoulder, sees Ashley getting

out of the car and looking his way. Kale struggles under

his own weight, trying to keep his feet from crossing the

line -- he looks back to Ashley who's now heading toward

him. A slight smile crosses Kale's face as --

Ashley reaches in the box, grabs the mail, hands it over.

Ashley nods with a semi-polite smile, starts to head away --

Ashley walks closer to Kale, checks out his ankle bracelet.

Ashley smiles, disappears inside.    Kale's in love.

The wind HOWLS outside. Kale sits on the couch flipping

channels. Julie's in the chair, nodding off.

ON THE TV - Kale lands on that same photo of PATRICIA WALSH,

the MISSING REDHEAD we saw earlier.

Kale CLICKS the TV off -- looks over to Julie who's now sound

asleep. Kale's watch ALARM suddenly BEEPS. He quickly shuts

it off, eyes Julie. She stirs but doesn't wake up.

Kale quietly gets up, grabs the blanket off the sofa, covers

Julie up. He then picks up his soda and bowl of popcorn

from the coffee table, heads away...

Kale, immersed in shadow, enters. He quietly pulls Dad's

leather chair toward the window, positions it just right,

and sits.

KALE'S POV - Ashley's working out to a YOGA DVD.

As if eerily on cue, Ashley suddenly stops.

She goes to her window and peers out -- Kale ducks -- He

looks back up, sees Ashley gazing in his direction -- Kale's

breathing intensifies -- could she actually be seeing him?

ASHLEY turns around, goes back to her yoga mat. She takes a

breath, getting back in "the zone," then -- she slowly raises

her arms and bends into a ridiculously sexy pose.

Kale watches Ashley another couple of beats. Then her dad

appears in the doorway. Looking pissed. Kale leans closer --

Ashley stops the DVD. From her body language, she's clearly

annoyed at the interruption. The scene quickly devolves

into a heated argument. But Ashley's dad gets the last word

in and leaves. Ashley SLAMS the door behind him, flips off

the TV, storms in the bathroom and SLAMS that door, too.

Kale watches the vacant room... waiting... another beat,

then -- Ashley emerges from the bathroom with a box of

tissues. She sits on her bed, pulls THREE TISSUES from the

box, staring off... From this angle, it almost looks as if

her eyes could meet Kale's at any moment. Kale instinctively

lowers himself in the chair, his eyes never leaving her...

Then -- with a huge gust of HOWLING WIND we

Kale SNAPS AWAKE. Breathing hard. Bad dream. He sits up,

peers across to Ashley's windows. Dark, shades pulled.

Kale pulls himself out of the chair...

Kale enters, grabs his PSP and falls back to the bed. As he

starts playing, HEADLIGHT BEAMS appear from O.S. He glances

out the window:

KALE'S POV - A BLACK 1965 MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE pulls in Giles'

driveway.

Kale goes back to playing the PSP, then suddenly stops --

Kale hops up, heads to the window --

KALE'S POV - Kale watches as Giles hops out, leaves the car

running as he heads inside the house.

After a beat, the MAIN GARAGE DOOR raises up. Giles appears,

ducking underneath, heads back to the Mustang, gets in.

Giles maneuvers the car around the driveway. The front end

of the car swings around, revealing a bashed-in right front

fender.

Kale races to his closet, pulls down a pair of binoculars,

heads back to the window.

BINOCULAR POV - In the garage, Giles is already out of the

car, rounding the back as the garage door lowers... Kale

crouches, trying to see under the CLOSING DOOR... catching a

glimpse of Giles popping the trunk --

A HAND

suddenly enters frame, lands on Kale's shoulder! Kale

SCREAMS, whips around -- Julie. She SCREAMS, too.

Kale turns back.

HIS POV -    Giles' garage door is now closed.

Julie leaves.    Kale turns back to the window, stares out at

Giles' house.    The lights go out.

ON KALE - sitting in the leather chair, binoculars raised.

On the floor next to the chair is a 7-11 bag, a slurpee cup,

a bag of beef jerky and an AUTOMOTIVE MAGAZINE with a MUSTANG

on the cover.

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley sits on the roof leaning against her

closed window. She's reading Lolita.

REVEAL RONNIE - sitting at dad's computer looking at the

FBI'S OFFICIAL WEBSITE.

Kale processes that as we suddenly hear a car door SLAM O.S.

BINOCULAR POV - Kale TILTS DOWN to see Ashley's mom backing

out the driveway. Kale TILTS UP to Ashley's window -- Ashley

ducks back inside her room, disappears.

BINOCULAR POV - Kale TILTS DOWN to the pool, sees Ashley

emerging from the house with a towel that she throws on the

lounge chair.

Ronnie joins Kale at the window.

THEIR POV - Ashley flips her sandals off one at a time, pulls

her tank off revealing her bronzed back and bikini top.

Ashley slinks out of her shorts revealing a "near-thong"

bikini this time.

Ashley crouches down, runs her fingers through the water.

Ashley cups her hands, scoops a handful of water from the

pool, splashes her face... runs her hands through her hair...

She stands, takes a deep breath, holds it -- then exhales...

Ashley stretches her arms high above her head.

Ronnie grabs the binoculars from Kale, puts them to his eyes,

moves closer to the window -- but his zoomed-in vision causes

him to underestimate the distance -- THWUMP. The end of the

binoculars HIT THE WINDOW just as Ashley dives into the pool --

Ronnie and Kale hit the deck as we hear the splash O.S.

Kale grabs the binoculars from Ronnie.

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley's underwater at the far end of the

pool. She tucks and pushes off the wall, swims back...

ON ASHLEY - She suddenly surfaces, hoists herself from the

water. She spins and sits on the ledge, rings the water

from her hair. But she suddenly stops -- and shifts her

GAZE UP toward Kale and Ronnie!

Ronnie grabs the binoculars back.

Kale peeks out --

THEIR POV - Ashley's slipping back into her shorts and tank

top. She heads to the back door, tries the knob. Locked.

Over this, Ronnie turns to Kale:

They turn back.     Ashley's gone.

The DOORBELL RINGS.       Kale and Ronnie freeze.   Then --

Kale and Ronnie quietly approach the door.         Ronnie suddenly

pulls Kale back.

The DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN.         Kale heads to the door.

Kale peeps through the peephole --

DISTORTED PEEPHOLE POV - Ashley.

Kale calmly turns to Ronnie.

Ronnie tip-toes to the door. One look at Ashley and he covers

his mouth, grabs Kale and pulls him back.

Both laugh, giggle, acting "girlie," practically spinning in

circles as they speak in hushed, panicked whispers:

The DOORBELL RINGS again.         Kale heads to the door.

Kale swings the door open.     Ashley stands there a beat.    Her

arms folded. Then --

Ronnie cringes at how that sounded.

Kale and Ronnie trade glances.

Ashley steps inside, glances around, checking out the place.

Kale trades a look with Ronnie as Ashley nonchalantly heads

up the stairs.

Ashley barges in, instantly struck by the mess. Kale pushes

past her, starts grabbing underwear and garbage off the floor.

Kale keeps gathering clothes, tossing them to Ronnie who

tosses them in the closet.

Ashley picks up the binoculars from the window sill, peers

outside.

Kale and Ronnie trade looks. Ashley turns around, binoculars

still raised, aiming them like a gun at Kale.

Kale freezes.

Kale's eyes widen in panic.

Ronnie points out the window to Giles' house.

Suddenly seeing something O.S., Kale RIPS the binoculars out

of Ashley's hand, goes to the window.

BINOCULAR POV - Giles pulls the Silver Toyota out of the

garage and out the driveway.

Ashley suddenly grabs the binoculars from Kale, peers out.

BINOCULAR POV - Sure enough, the Mustang NO LONGER HAS A

BASHED-IN FENDER. The garage door starts to close --

Kale eyes Ashley. Shit, could he have imagined it?       Ashley

playfully grabs the binoculars back from Kale.

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley catches a glimpse of a faded TEXAS

LONGHORNS BUMPER STICKER.

THEIR POV - Giles' garage door finally SLAMS CLOSED.

Kale and Ronnie eye Ashley as if to say "see?"      Ashley eyes

them another beat -- then:

Off Kale and Ronnie, their dreams realized --

A BOX OF SPYING CRAP is dumped onto Kale's bed. Another DV

Camera, an old, bulky VHS camera, a black and white portable

TV, couple of tri-pods, walkie talkies, wires... a real mess.

WIDER TO REVEAL RONNIE:

Ashley sits at Kale's computer as Kale anxiously sifts through

Ronnie's stuff.

Ronnie goes to Ashley, reads the Amazon web page for the

book:

Silence. Kale and Ronnie trade awkward glances, shaking

their heads to each other as if reassuring themselves they

don't suffer from such a condition.

TRACKING ACROSS KALE'S ROOM - The two tri-pod-mounted DV

Cams stand watch over Giles' house. One camera feeds a grainy

close-up shot of Giles' garage door to Ronnie's portable TV

on the floor. The other feeds a WIDE SHOT of Giles' entire

house to Kale's color TV. Both images appear on Kale's

computer monitor.

WIDER TO REVEAL - Kale and Ashley sit on the floor near the

window. Kale peers over to Giles with the binoculars as

Ashley messes with Kale's cell phone. In the b.g. Ronnie's

passed out on Kale's bed, his hand resting inside the pizza

box just inches from the last slice.

ON ASHLEY - she's messing with Kale's cell phone.

Ashley carefully unclips Ronnie's cell from his hip, flips

it open, dials. After a beat, Kale's cell RINGS with

Madonna's "LIKE A VIRGIN." Kale laughs.

Kale laughs as Ashley delicately re-clips the phone to

Ronnie's belt.

KALE'S POV - the Pilch's dog, wearing a pink sweater, suddenly

darts into Kale's yard.

THEIR POV - Pilch's dog stops, spins around and takes a dump.

Mr. Pilch, in his robe, suddenly appears from the shadows,

watches the dog do its business.

Nope. The dog finishes.      Pilch calls it over, scoops up the

dog and heads O.S.

There's a beat as Ashley locks eyes with Kale.       Then --

Ashley holds Kale's gaze for a beat.      Then, she nods, with:

Kale hesitates. We see in his eyes that he's flashing to

the past... "going there..." There's an uneasy beat as Ashley

picks up on it:

Then -- HEADLIGHTS APPEAR OUTSIDE. Kale quickly turns away

from Ashley, pulls one of the DV Cams off its tri-pod, flips

out the three-inch LCD SCREEN.

DV CAM POV - Giles' silver Toyota pulls in the driveway.

Stops. Engine and headlights turn off.

DV CAM POV - Kale ZOOMS IN. The GRAINY IMAGE finally steadies

to reveal a SECOND CAR pulling in behind Giles. A thirty-

something attractive WOMAN -- a REDHEAD -- is at the wheel.

She pulls in next to Giles' car.

DV CAM POV - Giles gets out.      Wearing a suit, no tie.

Giles goes to the woman's car, opens her door.

The woman gets out, wearing a black cocktail dress.

DV CAM POV - Kale ZOOMS in on the woman's wrist and hand.

Sure enough, she's wearing both a green and a purple bracelet,

and has a black stamp blotch on her hand.

They turn back to the window, watch as Giles escorts the

woman to the house, shows her in. A light comes on inside.

DV CAM POV - Kale ZOOMS IN on one of the living room windows,

spots the woman moving around inside, looking at artwork...

she sits on the sofa as Giles enters with two glasses and a

bottle of wine. He sits down, pours the wine. They toast,

take sips. Giles moves in for a kiss --

DV CAM POV - The woman shies away from Giles, stands from

the sofa.

They watch as the woman gets up, moves to the center of the

room, and starts to get a little groove on...

DV CAM POV - Giles watches the woman as she seductively moves

her body to the music we're not hearing.

Kale sets the camera down, turns on his receiver. As he

toggles through radio stations -- Rock, Alternative...

Kale flips to an easy listening R & B station playing Lou

Rawls "You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine."

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley watches as Giles takes the woman's

hand and dances with her. Their rhythm fits the music

perfectly.

ON RONNIE - he stirs on the bed, still asleep.

Ashley and Kale eye Ronnie for a beat.     Then turn back to

the window.

DV CAM POV - Kale pans back to the woman and Giles. They're

really dancing close now. Kale's and Ashley's eyes shift to

each other, then quickly flick away. A beat. Then -- Ashley

raises the binoculars, faces back toward Giles' with:

Ashley glances to Kale. Kale turns, holds her gaze. A

palpable tension between these two. They ever so slowly

lean toward each other when --

RONNIE - suddenly interrupts, pushing himself between them.

Ronnie looks to Kale and Ashley who glare back.

Ronnie stands, leaves. Kale shakes his head, turns back to

Ashley. They lean in again when -- Ashley's CELL PHONE

ominously RINGS with the first measures of BEETHOVEN'S 5TH --

"BUM BUM BUM BUMMMMM." She pulls the cell from her pocket.

Ashley flips the phone shut, joins Kale who's watching the

LCD screen:

DV CAM POV - Giles and the woman are back on the couch. The

woman is leaning her head on Giles' shoulder. As Giles leans

forward to take her wine glass, the woman falls over behind

him. Out cold. Kale and Ashley cringe.

Kale and Ashley cross the yard to Kale's kite string boundary.

They peer into each other's eyes.       Then --

Ashley smiles. They suddenly hear VOICES O.S.       Kale and

Ashley glance over to Giles' house.

THEIR POV - The woman is heading briskly to her car.     Giles

is right behind her.

Ashley grabs Kale's arm and pulls him behind a shrub on his

side of the boundary.

They peek back over to Giles'.

THEIR POV - We're crouched low now, so we only hear the barely

audible voices of Giles and the WOMAN. Talking SERIOUSLY

about something --

Ashley suddenly darts from behind the shrub and bolts toward

the fence --

But Ashley keeps going.

WE FOLLOW BEHIND ASHLEY - She creeps over to the fence,

presses up against it, peering through the cracks --

ASHLEY'S POV - We see the dark silhouettes of Giles and the

woman -- Ashley shifts her head, straining to listen --

The woman suddenly drops her purse.       The CONTENTS spill onto

the driveway.

ASHLEY'S POV - Giles bends down, picks up her car keys.

ASHLEY'S POV - She sees Giles make a motion toward the fence.

Suddenly, the woman's CAR KEYS WHACK the other side of the

fence, then PLOP DOWN underneath it just a couple of feet

from Ashley's position!

ON ASHLEY - she startles, looks over, sees the keys.

ASHLEY'S POV - She looks back toward Giles and the woman.

Hears the woman start to LAUGH. Giles, not laughing,

purposefully steps toward the woman, takes her arm.

ASHLEY'S POV - The woman relents.   Giles helps her back toward

the house.

WITH KALE - He's seeing it all.

WITH ASHLEY - she glances down, eyes the car keys sparkling

in the moonlight. She scoots toward them as --

WE CRANE UP TO REVEAL - Giles - heading back toward the fence!

ON KALE - seeing this.

Kale tries to get Ashley's attention, but she's not looking --

CU - ASHLEY'S HAND - she reaches for the car keys --

CLOSER - ASHLEY'S FINGERTIPS barely TOUCH them when --

GILES' HAND - suddenly SWOOPS IN from O.S., BRUSHES ASHLEY'S

FINGERS just before grabbing the keys and swiping them back

to his side!

Somehow Ashley keeps herself from screaming as she YANKS HER

HAND BACK, PRESSES HERSELF AGAINST THE FENCE. She puts her

hand over her mouth to silence her own breathing --

KALE'S POV - Giles stands frozen in the shadows behind Ashley.

WITH ASHLEY - She slowly turns her head, sees Giles through

one of the cracks -- STANDING RIGHT THERE.

Ashley starts to slowly SLIIIDE away... when suddenly -- a

TWIG SNAPS under her foot! Ashley FREEZES. She peers back

through the nearest crack.

ASHLEY'S POV - searching for Giles -- doesn't see him --

Ashley presses herself even harder against the fence as we...

TILT UP AND PAN OVER TO REVEAL GILES - peering over the fence.

We can only hope it's tall enough to keep him from looking

down and seeing Ashley.

WITH KALE - He's seeing it all.

ON GILES - He raises up, standing on his tip toes to get a

better look down. Shifting his head back and forth.

WITH KALE - He ducks behind the shrub, contemplating his

next move. He glances down, picks up a large pebble. He

pops out and tosses it over into Giles' yard.

We HEAR IT DROPPING through branches, SCATTERING to the ground

as Kale ducks back behind the shrub, breathing hard. He

then peers back out --

HIS POV - Giles lowers back down, turns and heads back toward

the house.

Kale sighs in relief. Waves Ashley the "all clear." Ashley

heads back over to Kale, breathless.

Ashley silences Kale with a finger to his lips. She then

leans in, gives him a peck on the cheek and bolts away --

Off Kale, utterly stupefied --

Exhilarated, Kale SLAMS through the office door, binoculars

in hand. He goes to his chair, sits, taking position...

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley walks in, heads straight for the window

and draws the blinds.

Kale slumps.    Damn.

ON ASHLEY'S WINDOW - shades still drawn. Lights are out

now. The wind picks up outside as we PAN TO REVEAL Kale

asleep in the leather chair.

We suddenly hear GLASS SHATTER O.S.

Kale's eyes POP OPEN. He looks around. Did he hear something

or did he dream it -- he pulls himself out of the chair,

makes his way to the door, slowly swings it open...

Kale cautiously steps into the hall...

No answer.    He heads to...

Kale enters, tosses the binoculars on the desk, throws a

glance out the window to Giles' house. Dark. Kale turns to

the bed, pulls back the sheets. As Kale unties his shoes,

takes off his socks, we notice over his shoulder --

IN THE B.G. - A LIGHT COMES ON IN GILES' LIVING ROOM.

ON KALE - not noticing as he strips down to his boxers --

IN THE B.G. - GILES' LIVING ROOM - THE WOMAN HEADS INTO THE

ROOM FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY GILES. SHE SPINS AND SLAPS HIM IN

THE FACE. SHE WALKS AWAY AS GILES STANDS THERE FROZEN.

ON KALE - he throws his clothes in the closet, finally turns

back and sees --

KALE'S POV - Giles standing in the living room, glaring at

the woman.

Kale darts to his desk, turns off the light, grabs the

binoculars.

BINOCULAR POV - Giles and the woman are arguing. The woman

paces around the room as Giles stands there. The woman's

arms flail about. As she paces back by Giles, he suddenly

GRABS HER ARMS.

Kale watches as the woman yanks herself from his grasp and

knocks over the lamp. The BULB shatters on the floor,

throwing the living room into total darkness.

Kale drops the binoculars and grabs the DV CAM. He fumbles

with it, flips open the LCD SCREEN. But as he presses the

power button, the camera's LAMP suddenly IGNITES, MOMENTARILY

LIGHTING UP KALE'S ROOM!

Kale spins and hits the floor.   He frantically finds the

switch, turns off the lamp.

Kale stays on the floor, slouched under the window sill for

a couple of beats. Then -- he slowly raises up, peers out.

DV CAM POV - Giles, now alone, has turned on another light

and is simultaneously picking up pieces of shattered light

bulb and wiping some RED LIQUID OFF THE FLOOR...    Could be

wine... or blood even...

Giles wads the towel up, picks up one of the woman's HIGH

HEELS lying near the couch. Giles then moves to the stereo,

turns it off, leans down, picks up the woman's OTHER SHOE.

He flips off the lights, heads out of the room.

Kale trades the grainy DV CAM for the binoculars.

BINOCULAR POV - Kale PANS ACROSS the lower floor windows of

Giles' house that's now become eerily still. He TILTS UP to

the second floor, SLOWLY PANS ACROSS those windows -- Again,

nothing.

BINOCULAR POV - Over the above, Kale SLOWLY PANS BACK ACROSS

THE SAME WINDOWS, comes to the last one and see GILES STARING

RIGHT BACK AT HIM.

Kale spins and dives to the floor, knocking the other camera

and tri-pod over.

Kale shoves himself against the wall, frozen in terror. He

doesn't dare get up. He spots his CELL PHONE -- on the floor

a few feet away. He extends his leg out, uses his foot to

slowly SLIIIDE the phone toward him.

KALE'S TREMBLING HAND reaches for the phone, picks it up --

Kale's about to flip it open when the PHONE'S LCD SCREEN

SUDDENLY LIGHTS UP, BLARING MADONNA'S "LIKE A VIRGIN."

Kale startles, fumbles the phone -- realizes it's Ronnie,

flips the phone open --

Kale finally musters the courage to peek over the sill --

KALE'S POV - Gile's BACK DOOR is OPEN.

A DOOR suddenly SLAMS O.S.

This as Kale grabs his bat, slowly approaches his door.

Ronnie yawns, starts snoring. Kale's hand is about to grab

the knob --

Kale flips the phone closed, throws it to the bed. He turns

back to the door just as IT SUDDENLY PUSHES OPEN, SMACKING

KALE IN THE FOREHEAD! Kale STUMBLES BACK, screams, raises

the bat.

Kale doesn't immediately drop the bat as he focuses on Julie,

dressed in her serving uniform, barely visible in the

darkness. She flips the light on.

Kale falls back to the bed.

Kale turns back on his side. Julie eyes him a long beat.

What to say... she flips off the light, then -- pulls the

door closed.

ON KALE - eyes wide open, heart racing.    He's gonna need

that caffeine in the morning.

A groggy Kale tugs on the blind, cautiously raises it --

KALE'S POV - GILES' DRIVEWAY - The silver Toyota's gone.

The woman's car is still there.

Kale saunters down the stairs....

Kale enters, notices a few full grocery bags on the counter

and the coffee maker brewing. He opens the fridge, sees a

new Mountain Dew twelve-pack. He cracks open the carton,

pulls out a can, closes the fridge door revealing

GILES - IN THE FLESH, IN KALE'S KITCHEN.

Kale JUMPS, drops the can.    It rolls to Giles' feet.

Kale glares, breathing hard. Giles taps on the top of the

dented soda can, hands it to Kale. Kale doesn't take it.

Note: Giles' shirt should have BURNT ORANGE somewhere in it,

either in the pattern, stripes, etc...

Giles puts the soda on the counter as Julie comes through

the kitchen door carrying groceries.

Kale reacts to that. There's an awkward silence as Kale's

eyes instinctively glance down to the ankle bracelet.

Giles steps closer to Kale, bends down to get a closer look

at the ankle bracelet.

Kale reacts, surprised at how genuine that sounded.

Awkward beat.    Giles turns back to Julie:

Julie heads out the door.       Giles turns to Kale.   An awkward,

silent beat. Then --

Giles quickly adjusts his tone as Julie comes back with a

last bag of groceries:

As Giles says this, he casually sits at the kitchen table.

Kale eyes him, about to turn and leave, but:

Kale quickly grabs the jar of sugar from the counter and

even thinks to grab a spoon from the drawer. He delivers it

to Giles as Julie brings the coffee, sits at the table.

Kale turns to leave again.

Off Kale --

Ashley sits on the bed. She looks damned good, too.        Dolled

up, lipstick. She's just heard the story from Kale.

Ashley rolls her eyes.

Kale looks at Ashley, realizes what she's referring to as he

glances down to the ankle bracelet.

Ashley turns to leave.

Ashley glares, furious. She picks up the DV cam and

binoculars, approaches Kale, hands them over with:

Ashley leaves.      A sullen Kale stares after her --

PRELAP - CROWD WALLA and THWUMPING MUSIC.

Kale sits in the darkness at dad's desk. He's on the phone,

pressing his other finger to his ear, trying to drown out

the NOISE emanating from Ashley's party next door.

Kale, on phone, gets Ronnie's VOICE MAIL.

Kale slams the phone down, sits there a beat.     JUMP CUT:

- The white pages THWUMP onto the desk.     JUMP CUT:

- Kale on the phone:

A ROAR of LAUGHTER O.S. makes Kale jump from his chair.       He

grabs the binoculars, heads to the window.

BINOCULAR POV - Kale scans the crowd until he finds Ashley,

talking with a group of PARTYGOERS. She pretends to listen

to one of the guy's stories as she furtively glances toward

Kale's window. But it's quick. We can't be a hundred percent

sure if it was on purpose.

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley excuses herself from the group and

approaches the drink and food table where MINNIE TYCO (a.k.a.

"Skinny Psycho") is standing, nitpicking over her snack

choices. Ashley hugs her then taps the cute GUY next to her

on the shoulder. The guy turns around.

Ashley mouths "Oh my God" like he's some long lost lover.

Ashley hugs the surprised guy who wastes no time in hugging

her back.

Kale keeps watching.

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley glances up in Kale's direction again --

it's more obvious this time as she keeps HUGGING THE GUY.

Kale tosses the binoculars, heads out.

Kale SLAMS a ladder up against the roof.

Kale SLAMS a speaker down on the edge of the roof facing

Ashley's. Makes sure the speaker wires are securely clamped

in place, then unwinds the roll of wire back across the roof

toward the ladder... JUMP CUT:

Kale runs the wire down the hall...

SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

CU - Kale's hand flips on dad's bookshelf amplifier, CRANKS

THE VOLUME CONTROL KNOB.

CU - Kale's I-POD LCD SCREEN lights up.    His thumb hovers

over the PLAY button.

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley's party comes into focus.

Kale presses play. The speaker EXPLODES with the ROAR OF

BARRY MANILOW (or AIR SUPPLY).

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley's party comes to a grinding halt.

Kale PANS AROUND, picks up Ashley again. Glaring. Fire in

her eyes as she storms O.S. Kale smiles with perverse

satisfaction as he tilts his head, anticipating the doorbell

to ring. Another beat, then -- DING DONG.

Kale descends the stairs, maintaining his wicked grin. He

opens the door for Ashley, but instead -- gets PELTED WITH A

BARRAGE OF WATER BALLOONS.

Kale stands there, frozen as the two BRATS jump from the

bushes, AD LIB MOCKING Kale as they laugh and race away into

the shadows. Kale's about to pursue when the sound of a

DOOR OPENING O.S. stops him cold. He spins around to see

ASHLEY

storming in from the kitchen and marching up the stairs!

Kale races back to the stairs.    Ashley increases her speed...

Ashley storms down the hall, sees the speaker wires running

into dad's office...

Ashley SLAMS through the door, spots Kale's I-pod, rips it

out of its dock. The music stops. She spins around, runs

smack into Kale who SWIPES the I-pod out of her hand and

SLAMS it back in the dock. The music BLARES. Ashley moves

in, but Kale blocks her path. She tries to get around him.

He stands in her way.

Kale falls for it. He looks. Ashley shoves him out of the

way, grabs the I-pod. Kale chases her out into...

Ashley bolts into...

Where she holds the I-pod out the window, stopping Kale in

his tracks.

Kale tries to respond, but Ashley keeps pressing:

Over the above Ashley glances around

A long beat as Ashley peers into Kale's eyes.      She slowly

steps closer to him:

Kale leans in and kisses her. They pull away, lock eyes.

Then -- Ashley pulls Kale by his soaking wet t-shirt, kisses

him back even harder. Heavy make-out. Then -- they stumble

back toward the bed out of frame as we hold on Kale's window --

and Giles' house beyond...

OUR POV - peering down into Ashley's back yard. There's a

couple of guys passed out on rafts floating in the pool. WE

SLOWLY PAN to reveal --

KALE - looking tired, his eyes glazed, sitting at dad's

computer surfing a website: "BRUTAL KILLINGS IN AUSTIN."

ON THE SCREEN - As Kale clicks pages, we see FLASHES of CRIME

SCENE PHOTOS from the three murders -- the bodies of the

three redheads -- BLOODIED, BRUISED...

ON KALE - he doesn't blink as he clicks on ONE PHOTO after

the OTHER. We see a FLASHES of the victims' eyes -- WIDE

OPEN, LIFELESS...

We suddenly hear laughter O.S. Kale SNAPS TO. He runs a

hand through his hair, gets up, moves to the window.

HIS POV - ASHLEY'S POOL - a couple of girls GIGGLE as they

stand at the edge of the pool pouring beer onto the passed-

out guys' chests.

Kale quietly enters and shuts the door. He's hiding something

behind his back as he sits on the bed next to a sleeping

Ashley. She stirs, opens her eyes, peers up at him, smiles.

Kale holds up a folded piece of paper, hands it to Ashley.

She curiously eyes Kale, then takes it, opens it to reveal a

printed-out picture of a long-stem red rose. Ashley smiles.

Ashley pulls Kale in for a kiss. She pulls away, falls back

to the bed. Her eyes glance down at Kale's ankle bracelet.

A beat as the two peer into each other's eyes.       Then:

We get the impression she knows a lot. Kale leans in for

another kiss. But this time, as they lock lips, Ashley's

eyes shoot open.

HER POV - the first hints of daylight out the window.

Ashley scrambles out of bed for her clothes, getting dressed,

searching for her shirt. Kale spots it behind the bed. As

he gets up to retrieve it, he hears a NOISE O.S. Kale peers

out the window --

HIS POV - Giles is dragging a HEAVY BLUE PLASTIC BAG down

the stairs leading to the garage.

Ashley throws on her shoes, joins Kale at the window.

THEIR POV - Giles pulls the bag into the garage next to what

we presume is the Mustang that's now been covered with a

TARP. (Note: The woman's car is still in the driveway.)

Kale grabs the binoculars.

BINOCULAR POV - We catch a glimpse of a few CRIMSON RED SMEARS

on the blue bag as Giles heaves it behind the Mustang.

Kale gives her the binoculars.      Ashley looks over.

Giles' GARAGE DOOR CLOSES.

Ashley pauses, peers out the window again.      She can't help

but be a little concerned. Then --

Off Kale --

ON KALE - holding up a UNIVERSAL GARAGE DOOR REMOTE still in

the package.

Ashley and Ronnie are on the bed. Note: Kale is wearing the

same clothes he was yesterday, the stubble coming back.

Hair more disheveled, eyes a little puffier...

Ronnie eyes Kale with concern.    Kale doesn't answer.

GILES suddenly FIRES UP HIS LAWNMOWER O.S.

KALE'S POV - Giles pushes the mower around the side of the

house to the front yard.

Ashley grabs the remote.

CU - KALE'S CELL PHONE - "LIKE A VIRGIN" suddenly blares.

WIDER - Kale flips his cell open, holds it in one hand, binocs

in the other.

Kale presses "RECORD" on the tri-pod-mounted DV CAM. He

peers back out the window. We hear Giles' lawnmower O.S.

Both sides of his house are clear.

KALE'S POV - OUT HIS WINDOW - RONNIE - suddenly appears from

the bottom of frame, keeping low as he darts to the fence.

Ronnie turns, peers back up to Kale, gives him the thumbs up

or down.

BINOCULAR POV - Ronnie draws a breath, then very ungracefully

hops the fence and falls into Giles' yard out of sight.

BINOCULAR POV - Ronnie scrambles to his feet from behind the

fence, darts to the driver's side door of Giles' Toyota.

BINOCULAR POV - Ronnie lifts up on the latch.        Locked.

Ronnie tries the back door.        Locked.

BINOCULAR POV - Kale PANS ACROSS to the other side of Giles'

house. Nothing. He PANS BACK to Ronnie.

OUR POV - Over Kale's shoulder, we see Kale is clearly aiming

his binocs at Ronnie.

But we also see ON THE FAR SIDE OF FRAME GILES' NEIGHBOR

PULLS HER LAWNMOWER OUT OF HER GARAGE AND ROLLS IT O.S --

But Kale isn't seeing this!

Ronnie goes around the back of the Toyota to the other side.

He lifts up on the passenger door latch. Bingo.

We see and hear Ronnie, his ass to us, rummaging around the

inside of Giles' car.

Kale grabs the pencil and notebook.

Ronnie pauses. Kale glances up. Just happens to shift his

gaze to the side of Giles' house to see --

KALE'S POV - GILES IS WALKING BACK AROUND with no lawnmower!

But for some reason we still HEAR A LAWNMOWER.

Kale grabs the binoculars.

BINOCULAR POV - Kale WHIP PANS to Giles' neighbor, JUDY THORP -

CUTTING HER GRASS, TOO.

KALE'S POV - Ronnie dives in the car just as Giles rounds

the corner of the house.

Ronnie gently pulls the door shut.

BINOCULAR POV - Ronnie TUMBLES into the back seat and out of

sight just as GILES heads for the car.

KALE'S POV - Giles opens the passenger door. About to reach

in when something distracts him -- Giles pulls himself out,

looks over to see

ASHLEY

Heading up the driveway. We barely hear her introduce herself

to Giles. Giles steps around to the front of the car,

uneasily shakes her hand.

No answer.

BINOCULAR POV - Kale TILTS BACK TO THE TOYOTA, sees Ronnie

sneaking out the back seat door on the driver's side as Ashley

distracts Giles, pointing up to the trees on the opposite

side of the yard. Who knows what they're talking about.

Bird-watching perhaps. Whatever it is, it's working.

BINOCULAR POV - Kale PANS BACK to Ronnie as he hops the fence

back into Kale's yard.

Kale TILTS BACK UP to Ashley and Giles in the driveway.

Over this, a breathless Ronnie stumbles into the bedroom,

joins Kale at the window.

Ronnie and Kale lock eyes for a tense beat.     Then:

KALE'S POV - THE CLUB GIRL Giles brought home the other night

exits the back door and walks up to Ashley and Giles!

Kale and Ronnie watch as Ashley shakes hands with the club

girl, then throws a quick surprised glance up to Kale and

Ronnie. Giles' body language tells us he's ready for Ashley

to leave. Ashley gets the hint, shakes his hand, heads back

down the driveway and out of sight.

Kale raises the binoculars again, then furiously grabs for

his pad and pencil.

BINOCULAR POV - The club girl gets in her car. Giles closes

her door, watches as she backs out. Kale TILTS DOWN to her

license plate, starts jotting down the number.

Kale doesn't answer, still trying to get the rest of the

number as Ashley enters, eyes Ronnie who gestures to Kale.

Kale's starting to get manic:

Ashley and Ronnie trade concerned looks.

Off Ronnie and Ashley --

Kale enters, goes to the desk, sits at dad's computer,

clicking keys as Ashley and Ronnie enter --

Ashley and Ronnie stop in their tracks at the MESS.

Note: Up till now, the office has been in reasonably good

order. But now, it's noticeably different.

WIDER - The shades are drawn. Soda cans everywhere... papers

are spread on the floor: PRINTED OUT FULL COLOR GRUESOME

CRIME SCENE PHOTOS, BLACK & WHITE AUTOPSY PHOTOS of the

murdered redheads... more pictures of the girl who

disappeared, PATRICIA WALSH. "MISSING" FLYERS...

Over the above, Ronnie leans down, lifts a couple of books

out of an Amazon.com box: "Murderer: Tell Tale Signs of a

Serial Killer" and "The Shrine of Jeffrey Dahmer" -- the

titles Ashley was referencing earlier. Ronnie shows them to

Ashley who takes a RECEIPT out of a nearby Home Depot box --

on the page -- SMITH'S UNIVERSAL GARAGE DOOR REMOTE QTY (1)

$29.99.

Ashley and Ronnie turn to Kale. They notice on the wall

behind him, hanging next to his Dad's book cover posters, a

BLACK AND WHITE POSTER-SIZE SATELLITE PHOTO of THE

NEIGHBORHOOD. Giles' house is circled and labeled in

flourescent ink. Kale finally looks up, notices them looking --

That gets Kale's attention.

Kale locks eyes with Ashley.       A long beat, then --

Ashley pauses, shocked she hasn't gotten through to Kale.

Then --

Ashley and Ronnie trade looks.       Then -- Ashley leaves.   Ronnie

turns back to Kale.

Ronnie leaves.       Kale sits in silence, his thoughts unreadable --

JUMP CUT:

Kale falls back in the leather chair, fighting his emotions,

trying to keep them in check. He glances out to Ashley's.

Dark. He peers around the office -- the articles, the books,

his DAD'S PHOTOS... the family portrait of Dad, Mom, and

Kale, smiling wide... their lives ahead of them...

In the darkness, find Kale sitting in his video game chair

staring out at Giles' house.

HIS POV - Giles' garage door is open. Giles' silver Toyota

is parked inside next to the Mustang. There's a light or

two on inside Giles' house but no signs of movement.

Kale throws intermittent glances out the window as he starts

to UNSCREW the back of the DV CAM. He lifts the back off,

then reaches in a nearby BOX and pulls out a BLUE TOOTH

WIRELESS CIRCUIT BOARD. He starts connecting it inside the

camera... JUMP CUT:

Kale screws the back of the camera on, takes a swig of a

soda. There's suddenly fierce KNOCKING at Kale's front door.

Kale just sits there. Staring ahead. More knocking and

DOORBELL RINGING. Kale jumps from his chair, grabs the bat.

Kale swings the door open -- nobody's there -- then -- Ronnie

suddenly STEPS INTO FRAME, grabs Kale --

Kale eyes Ronnie a beat.

A SHAKY and grainy VIDEO IMAGE appears on Kale's computer

screen. Kale picks up one of Ronnie's old walkie-talkies.

ON KALE'S COMPUTER SCREEN - Ronnie suddenly aims THE VIDEO

CAMERA AT HIS FACE.

Kale picks up the binoculars.

BINOCULAR POV - Giles' garage door is still open.     There's a

light on at the opposite end of the house.

Kale turns back to the computer screen --

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - His feet dart across the yard -- he

TILTS UP -- approaching the fence.

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Ronnie hops the fence.

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - The image goes to SNOW for a split

second -- the signal weakening...

Kale peers out the window --

BINOCULAR POV - We barely make out Ronnie's silhouette as he

makes his way toward the garage --

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Rapidly approaching the back of Giles'

Toyota.

RONNIE'S   DV CAM POV - Very shaky as Ronnie makes his way to

the back   seat door -- he takes out a pen light, aims it at

the door   as his hand enters frame, lifts up on the latch.

The door   pops open.

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We see Ronnie's hand feeling around

the back seat floor of Giles' car.

Kale's CALL WAITING suddenly BEEPS. He looks at the CALLER

I.D: ASHLEY. Shit. He has to let it go.

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Ronnie's hand finally pulls out the

cell phone.

BINOCULAR POV - Giles' house.       Still no sign of movement.

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We see Ronnie's hand gently push the

door of Giles' Toyota closed. The angle TILTS DOWN -- we're

now watching Ronnie's feet as they stride deeper into the

garage, walking in between the Toyota and Mustang.

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Ronnie sets the camera on the trunk of

the Mustang, aims it perfectly at the BLUE BAG sitting in

the corner. We watch with Kale as Ronnie enters frame,

crouched low, heading toward the bag. He raises the walkie

talkie --

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We watch as Ronnie kneels down, starts

to open the bag. But suddenly, the still POV suddenly STARTS

TO SLOWLY, STEADILY TRACK TO THE LEFT -- And Kale realizes --

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We watch as Ronnie spins and grabs the

camera.

We hear another NOISE O.S.

Kale looks out --

KALE'S POV - Giles' GARAGE DOOR STARTS TO CLOSE.

Dead air.    Giles' GARAGE DOOR SLAMS SHUT.

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We watch as Ronnie picks up the camera,

aims it at his face. Looking terrified. The camera swings

away as we see Ronnie's feet scrambling along the concrete

floor and then -- they appear to RACE THROUGH A DOORWAY ONTO

DIMLY LIT HARDWOOD FLOOR -- making us and Kale realize --

Still nothing.

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Shaky. We catch GLIMPSES OF RONNIE'S

FEET -- hauling ass down a HALLWAY, ROUNDING A CORNER ONTO

CARPET, THEN BACK ONTO HARDWOOD --

ON THE SCREEN - Ronnie suddenly PANS THE CAMERA up to his

face as he runs, clearly mouthing "HELP ME!!"

Then -- the camera seems to fall, SLIDING ON THE HARDWOOD

FLOOR TOWARD AN OLD BOOKCASE...

THE IMAGE CUTS OUT -- GOES TO ALL SNOW --

Kale jumps up, pacing. Peers out the window to Giles'. No

telling what the hell's happening -- or happened -- in there.

Kale eyes his ankle bracelet.      Green light.   Kale eyes his

bat. Grabs it. Fuck it.

Kale SLAMS out the back door, races across the yard, skips

over his kite string boundary --

ON HIS ANKLE BRACELET - Red light FLASHES.

WITH KALE - he hops the fence, racing to...

Kale darts to Giles' back door, tries the knob -- locked.

The house is still. Kale bolts around the side, uneasily

feeling his way through shadows and low-hanging branches.

It's even darker on this side. No lights on in Giles' house.

Kale cautiously rounds the side, approaches the front door --

it's open a few inches -- darkness beyond.

Kale eyes it a beat. Then -- steps up onto the porch, about

to push it open when -- SIRENS BLARE O.S.

Kale SPINS AROUND to see A POLICE CRUISER ROLLING TO A STOP.

Kale races toward it as two uniformed officers step out --

The officer pulls his sidearm, aims it at Kale --

Uniform #2 heads briskly to Giles' front door.

Kale watches as Uniform #2 approaches the Giles' door.

Uniform #2 knocks on the door. Rings the bell. No answer.

Uniform #2's about to knock again when a light comes on

inside. After a beat -- Giles opens the door. Looking

disheveled, in his bathrobe.

Uniform #1 retrains Kale as another CRUISER rolls to a stop.

Uniforms #3 & 4 hop out, head to Uniform #1 to assist.

Uniform #1 pulls Kale back to the cruiser, opens the back

door and pushes him down on the seat --

Uniform #1 looks concerned as he steps away from Kale.

Uniform #3 nods as Uniform #1 heads back up to Giles and

Uniform #2.

KALE'S POV - Uniform #1 whispers something to Uniform #2.

They turn back to Giles.

A beat. A couple more police cruisers roll to a stop.

Curious NEIGHBORS are now gathering across the street.

Giles ushers them through the door and follows them into the

house. Giles turns, shoots a quick glance to Kale before

closing the door.

ON KALE - all he can do is wait. He shifts his gaze to the

gathering neighbors. A few lock eyes with him, shake their

heads. Kale turns back toward the house...

ON THE GARAGE DOOR - as it slowly raises up.

WIDER - The uniforms, standing with Kale, wait as the door

opens all the way.

A light comes on inside. Giles and Uniform #1 come out the

inner garage door as Uniform #2 Giles drags the BLUE BAG out

from the garage.

Sure enough, there's blood smears and visible strands of

matted hair near the top. Uniform #2 unties the bag, pulls

the sides away. Everyone gathers around, peers inside, then

suddenly yank themselves back at the horrible STENCH emanating

from within.

Kale eyes Uniform #1 who gestures him to look.       Kale steps

toward the bag.

KALE'S POV - We peer into the bag to reveal the WIDE OPEN

eyes of a dead -- DEER.

All eyes on Kale.    He slumps.   Giles has an answer for

everything.

As the Uniforms lead Kale back down the driveway...

Kale looks over, sees PARKER, standing with JULIE whose eyes

are filled with it all: anger, concern, sadness...

Kale turns back to Giles' house. Sees lights being turned

out inside. As Kale shifts his gaze forward, he locks eyes

with ASHLEY standing in the crowd of neighbors. She watches

him with concern. Kale turns away, drops his head as the

cops, Parker and Julie lead him away... a FLASH OF LIGHTNING

in the distance...

Kale sits on the sofa, staring off. He looks to the stairs

as Julie and Parker head down. Parker nods to Uniform #3

who's standing next to Kale. Uniform #3 meets Parker and

Julie at the front door. Julie quietly nods to them, opens

the door. A few more inaudible words are exchanged before

Julie gently closes the door behind them.

Julie heads back into the living room, sits across from Kale.

Not the words Kale expected.      He looks up --

Kale nods.    He stands, goes to Julie and hugs her -- tight.

Kale enters amidst a few more LIGHTNING FLASHES and distant

ROLLS OF THUNDER. He heads to his window, glances out at

Giles' house. Dark. The wind's picking up. Kale closes

his window, draws the shade, sticks his cell in the charger.

He collapses to the bed,      stares at the roof over his head

for a beat -- then "LIKE      A VIRGIN" suddenly BLARES ON HIS

CELL PHONE. Kale stares       at it... then jumps from his bed,

races to the phone, rips      it from the charger, flips it open --

ON THE PHONE'S LCD SCREEN - A text message: LOOK AT YOUR

SCREEN. The LCD SCREEN suddenly BLACKS OUT. The battery's

dead.

A wide eyed Kale puts the cell phone on his desk, slowly

shifts his gaze to his computer monitor -- a grainy image

suddenly pops on -- shaky at first -- then it finally

steadies, and clears up. A torso and face come into focus:

RONNIE, lying in the corner of a very enclosed space. Eyes

open, head tilted against the wall. Dead.

Nearly hyperventilating, Kale leans closer to the screen,

sees a pile of clothes and a stray racketball trophy lying

next to Ronnie.

Kale realizes -- Ronnie's IN HIS CLOSET. Kale slowly turns,

eyes his closet door. He then steps toward it, reaches out --

and SLIDES THE CLOSET DOOR OPEN TO REVEAL --

RONNIE - lying dead in the corner.

Kale kneels down to Ronnie who suddenly POPS BACK TO LIFE!

Kale screams, falls back to the floor as Ronnie cracks up.

MORE LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER.

Kale staggers to his feet. Stunned. Not knowing whether to

hug Ronnie or beat the shit out of him.

Kale paces around, runs a hand through his hair as Ronnie

steps out of the closet, DV CAM in hand.

Kale eyes Ronnie.

Ronnie eyes Kale for a beat, wondering if he's serious.

Then Kale cracks a smile. Ronnie cracks up.

Kale and Ronnie lock eyes a beat. Then crack up again.

Both laugh hysterically, slap happy as hell.

Kale grabs the DV CAM from Ronnie -- Ronnie pulls it away.

Ronnie grabs some wires, starts hooking the camera up to

Kale's TV.

Kale and Ronnie watch the video of Ronnie's break-in.      They're

cracking themselves up as we see --

ON THE TV - Ronnie's feet stumbling through the garage, the

camera sliding away off the trunk of the Mustang, Ronnie

diving for it.

ON THE TV - Ronnie's feet start motoring across the concrete

floor, racing through the doorway onto the hardwood floor...

ON THE TV - As before, we're mostly watching Ronnie's feet

as they scamper around Giles' house. Then -- the camera

falls away, slides across the floor toward that bookcase,

its POV -- FOR A SPLIT SECOND - aiming UNDER THE BOOKCASE.

ON THE TV - This we didn't see earlier -- The camera is

quickly scooped up by Ronnie whose feet dart across Giles'

entry hall floor toward the front door.

We see Ronnie's hand reach for the knob.

ON THE TV - Ronnie's feet dart out Giles' front door and

into the darkness of the yard...

The TV SCREEN goes black.

Ronnie heads from the room.

Kale gets up, heads to the camera. About to eject the tape,

when a thought stops him. He pulls the camera off the TV,

sits on the floor, presses "PLAY", scans back through the

tape.

ON THE TV - The same footage. Nothing glaring stands out.

The camera falls from Ronnie's hand, slides to the bookcase.

Ronnie quickly scoops the camera up, keeps running...

Kale scans the tape back again, this time just to the point

where Ronnie drops the camera.

ON KALE - his eyes suddenly narrow -- did he see something?

Kale scans back again.

Ronnie enters, starts rummaging through the fridge, pulls a

soda out, then goes for the cabinets.

ON THE TV - just as the camera slides to a stop at the

bookcase and aims underneath it, Kale FREEZES THE IMAGE.

Dark, grainy.

Kale grabs his remote, cranks the brightness all the way up

on his TV.

Kale scoots closer to the TV amidst another FLASH OF LIGHTNING

& MUCH LOUDER CLAP OF THUNDER.

ON HIS FINGER - pressing the FRAME BY FRAME ADVANCE button --

ON THE TV -- we start to see SOMETHING UNDER THE BOOKCASE...

Kale presses the button a couple more times.

ON THE TV - The next frames are blurred -- this is the point

where Ronnie grabs the camera back -- but --

KALE'S FINGER - presses the advance button one more time.

ON THE TV - The next frame POPS INTO FOCUS.

THERE, UNDER THE BOOKCASE, WE SEE A FADED BLACK STAMP ON THE

BACK OF A WOMAN'S HAND!

Kale's eyes widen as he keeps pressing the ADVANCE BUTTON...

CU - Kale's eyes are transfixed on the screen, his face just

inches away as a few more blurry frames FLIP BY then -- BAM --

THE FACE OF THE MISSING GIRL -- PATRICIA WALSH -- POPS ON

THE SCREEN IN SHARP FOCUS, HER LONG RED HAIR PARTIALLY

COVERING HER GHOSTLY, WIDE OPEN EYES THAT STARE RIGHT INTO

CAMERA!

Kale recoils in horror as LIGHTNING IGNITES his room.

But a ROLL OF THUNDER drowns our Kale's voice --

Ronnie throws a bag of popcorn in the microwave, punches the

clock. Presses start. As he reaches behind him for his

soda can on the island, a BASEBALL BAT suddenly enters frame

and SLAMS DOWN on RONNIE'S ARM -- FWACK! Ronnie WHIRLS AROUND

in excruciating pain to come face to face with

GILES

who swings the bat across Ronnie's face.     Ronnie drops out

of frame behind the island.

No answer. Shit. Kale grabs the cordless off his bed, clicks

it on: DEAD. Another lightning FLASH. He grabs the tape

out of the camera, buries it in his closet, pulls out his

racketball trophy then creeps to the door, peers out --

KALE'S POV - The hallway's empty.   Clear shot to the stairs.

Kale steps out, raises the trophy, ready for anything as he

approaches the stairs, glancing in every direction. He

reaches the railing, peers down. No movement.

Kale heads down, slowly makes his way toward the kitchen,

peeks around the corner --

KALE'S POV - IN THE KITCHEN - The popcorn's POPPING in the

microwave.

Kale rounds the island to the microwave, presses "STOP" then

glances down, sees Ronnie's body --

Kale spins around as

GILES SUDDENLY APPEARS FROM THE SHADOWS.

More THUNDER. Kale whirls around, HURLS the trophy at Giles.

Giles knocks it away as Kale BOLTS for the back door, throws

it open. Giles pursues.

Kale bolts out the door, but trips on a well-placed garden

gnome on the steps. Giles or the brats must have put it

there. Regardless, it slows Kale down. He staggers into

the yard, SCREAMING for anyone to hear. But the WIND and

THUNDER drown him out as

GILES

-- Now right behind him -- swings the bat and trips Kale up.

Kale falls just short of his kite string boundary line.
