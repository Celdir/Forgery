EXT. CHICAGO - AERIAL - NIGHT

CREDITS BEGIN OVER:

Snow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago.

EXT. CHICAGO HOTEL - NIGHT

Cars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN

in tuxedo moves into:

INT. CHICAGO HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

THROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs

to the ballroom.

ANGLE - COAT CHECK

The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her.

When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE,

a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated

ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical

fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and

sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the

models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND

AID FOUNDATION"

Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly

sets on another waiter's passing tray.

DR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group

of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars.

A hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks.

Everyone agrees.

His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.

The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS

KIMBLE

Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary

golf swing.

He keeps moving.

CUT TO:

ANGLE - TOUGH-LOOKING LAB RAT

KATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal

elegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over

T-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway.

She smiles. He moves on.

ANGLE - PARTY

Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend...

DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the

University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.

Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties,

wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by

a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble

catch a look and hold it.

Kimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan,

smiling. Lentz extends his hand...

Lentz moves on. Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses

on relocating the Woman he just saw. She's gone. He and

Nichols move together through the party.

He hands Kimble a valet ticket.

They reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife, HELEN KIMBLE.

Kimble kisses her.

He kisses Helen.

Nichols leaves. Kimble looks at his wife.

CUT TO:

ANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT

A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to

others at table ant sit across from each other.

Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE,

mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other

OLDER WIFE.

Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress

her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS

CONTINUE...

INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course

changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange

of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners,

catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to

his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly

ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper

of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety:

"not yet."

As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod

at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..."

"That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress

you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a

'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his

watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes

her head.

Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share

a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols

shakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we

see Lentz watching.

INT. KIMBLE'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

Kimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through

his hair as he drives.

He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much

for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light

changes and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.

CUT TO:

EXT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kimble pulls up in front of his house. Suddenly both his

PAGER and CAR PHONE RING at the same time.

He hangs up.

Helen kisses him again, opens the door.

INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY / SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

Kimble, wearing scrubs but without head gear, moves down

stairs to the OR hall.

He sticks his head into the operating room.

Two harried surgeons look up, glad to see him.

SCRUB ROOM

Kimble begins scrubbing as the RESIDENT comes out to bring

him up to speed.

CUT TO:

INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Operation in progress. Top medical facility filled with

trained professionals and state of the art equipment. Kimble

is assisted across the table by the chief Resident. Both

working so intently they never look at each other as they

talk...

MARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble

and the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident

assisting.

Kimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident

over their masks, then back to work.

Kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown.

INT. SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

Kimble throws away his hat and mask. The door opens behind

him; it is the other Surgeon.

Kimble turns.

He is on phone, waits for answer.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

Helen on the phone, downstairs. She is still in her gown with

Helen hangs up phone, turns out the light and starts up the

stairs.

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT

Kimble driving.

INT. KIMBLE-S TOWNHOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet.

Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on

the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close

one of the interior closet doors.

She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!

A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen

claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her

string of pearls bursts...

... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls

across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from

the top.

CUT TO:

EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the

driveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still

on.

INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on

the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and

calls up the stairs.

No answer. He steps into the:

KITCHEN

The wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The

WASHER BUZZES, he switches the clothes from washer to dryer,

and STARTS the MACHINE. Takes a bottle of wine and two

glassesand leaves the kitchen.

INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON .38 SMITH AND WESSON - NIGHT

Lies on the floor, beside Helen's legs and the receiver of

phone, off the hook. A man's rubber-gloved hand picks up the

gun.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - STAIRS - NIGHT

Kimble starts up the stairs to the bedroom...

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Helen's hand reaches out presses the cradle down, dials

ON KIMBLE

Climbing the stairs... suddenly stops.

A small white ball on the stairs. He bends down and picks

it up... a pearl.

Silence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet.

Too quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor.

UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before

he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door.

Adrenal surge.

Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun

free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him.

The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a

leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun,

sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the

landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry

hall below.

SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble

catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his

shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow.

Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable

face...

The SIRENS are LOUDER...

Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble

down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped

by a VOICE behind him in the bedroom...

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lying by the bed, Helen Kimble, clutches the phone with one

hand, her head with the other.

Kimble appears. Helen drops the phone when she sees him.

EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

Two Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly

to the house.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kimble moves to her. Sees the necklace of bruises where she

was held down and choked. And then a bullet wound in her

leg. She's already going into shock. Her speech turns thick.

Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.

Her eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her

head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes

she won't be all right.

CAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone.

CUT TO:

INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Cops enter the house. See the .38 lying on the floor.

Covering each other, they move quickly up the stairs - guns

drawn.

ANGLE

Third floor. The First Cop, gun drawn, turns the corner of

Kimble's bedroom and finds:

Kimble holding his dead wife. Blood on his hands.

CUT TO:

INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

Kimble, numbed by the event, washes the blood off his hands

in the kitchen sink. A cop takes his blood-stained tux

jacket, and another hands him a parka.

EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

The street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious

neighbors, television news vans, etc.

Kimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van

arrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear.

INT. 11TH STREET DISTRICT HOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA FINDS Kimble in an interview room. He is in "why"

shock. "Why her." "Why me?" Says nothing. Two Detectives:

KELLY and ROSETTI. Kelly, the questioner, is overweight,

aggressive. He shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down.

As Kimble is questioned we INTERCUT WITH flashes of the

murder scene being processed:

FLASH - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Forensics technicians photograph the .38 at the base of the

stairs.

FLASH - FORENSICS TECHNICIAN DUSTS CRYSTAL LAMP

FLASH - MEASURE "NECKLACE" OF BRUISES ON HELEN'S NECK

DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)

Your wife was loaded wasn't she? I mean, she was worth quite

a bit of money.

BACK TO SCENE

Kimble looks up at the two cops. For the first time he seems

to sense something aggressive in their questioning.

They no longer seem on the same team.

The two cops stare at Kimble.

He gets up to go. A cop blocks his path. He turns and looks

at Kelly.

FACES OF THE JURY

Impassive. Attentive. His "peers." They listen to the

KIBLE'S POV - THE JURY

A few members lean over to make notes. It's powerful taken

out of context.

NICHOLS ON THE STAND

Nichols' look tells us everything... Yes.

CUT TO:

CORONER

On the stand.

A woman in the jury reacts. Kimble notices.

KIMBLE

On the stand. He finishes his moving description of the

events. We see some of the jury has been moved.

Gutherie returns to his seat. The Prosecutor moves to the

jury. He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength.

CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Richard Kimble sits behind the desk, but already he's a

shadow of the man we knew before, stares ahead passively as

Judge Bennett delivers the sentencing to hushed courtroom.

Kimble is silent, stunned, but all around him the sentence

shockwaves through the courtroom. Reporters push out rear

doors. Prosecutors share a look - with a hangman's

satisfaction. Nichols, watching behind Kimble's table,

lowers his head. Disbelief.

ANGLE ON RICHARD KIMBLE

He remains silent. Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by

bailiff. Gutherie whispers an "I'm sorry." Kimble doesn't

hear it.

Looks over his shoulder to the emptying courtroom. Faces

stare back.

CUT TO:

INT. KIT ROOM - DAY

Judge Bennett's V.O. CONTINUES over:

A locker opening. Inside, a profusion of chrome and nickel

plating. Jailhouse jewelry. Handcuffs dragged out. Action

checked.

CLOSE ON CUFFS

Slapped down over wrists, ratcheting down tight.

Ankle cuffs dragged out. Pant legs raised, canvas shoes

exposed. Cuffs clamped down on ankles.

CHAINS RATTLED out. Snaked across the floor. Looped around

waists and locked to handcuffs to form belly chains.

EXT . SALLY PORT (COOK COW TY JAIL) - NIGHT

The chain gang exits through the sally port. Kimble and

three other prisoners. Jailers escort them to...

An Illinois Department of Corrections guard moves alongside,

INT. BUS - CLOSE ON KEY - DAY

Locking wire mesh cage inside bus.

An old DIESEL COUGHS to life.

EXT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT

Main gates open. The BUS GRINDS onto the streets.

INT. BUS - DAY

The four prisoners sit scattered, still cuffed but no longer

chained together. Near the front, PRISONER #1 is eyeing...

The two prison guards seated beyond the caged door. YOUNG

GUARD lighting a smoke. OLD GUARD drowsing. Shotguns

bouncing on their knees. Prisoner #l shifts his gaze to...

The driver. Pistol on his hip.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The BUS RUMBLES north, heading towards the horizon.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

PRISONER #1 rises. Through caging:

Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers."

Checks his watch: 4:00.

Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his

belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker.

PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches

the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the

aisle...

PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head

between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and

CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp

plastic shank.

Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is

handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps

a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank.

Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun

carelessly ready.

Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble

doesn't respond.

He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange,

sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it.

Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as...

Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into

Young Guard's gut.

Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes

out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...

Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the

floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges

inside, but...

Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES...

Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under

the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator.

The CAGE DOOR SLAMS locked behind the Old Guard.

EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the bus careens off the road, accelerating.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Young Guard wrestles gun from Prisoner #2 and FIRES, killing

prisoner #2. Copeland grapples with wounded Young Guard.

Old Guard shotgun-butts Prisoner #1, flips the gun, PUMPS

ONE ROUND into the man's chest. Dead. He turns just as...

EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat.

Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the

Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes

off target as...

EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope

and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the

bottom of a small ravine.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down.

On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds

him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around

at...

Kimble. Rising between the seats.

A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things

off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head.

Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to

find Kimble.

He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a

medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out

his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands.

Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just

Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.

In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it

just settling?

With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young

Guard's bleeding.

ANGLE UNDER SEAT

We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a

back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the

opening.

BACK TO KIMBLE

A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble

retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a

growing vibration.

The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and

looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend

grows bright by the light of an approaching train.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Kimble sees: Old Guard fights the cage door. Kimble lunges

to his side.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Kimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young

Guard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles

the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus.

The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble

snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.

Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws

the door open. Grabs Young Guard.

But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out

the shattered windshield.

ANGLE ON REAR OF BUS

Copeland escapes through the hole in the back...

EXT. BUS - NIGHT

... and hits the ground running the other way. The

locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Train light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should

Kimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard

hold a look.

EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT

As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard

behind him. He slings the man clear.

SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.

For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.

The train light X-rays him.

Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint

away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a

dozen mincing steps before...

IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus,

splitting it open.

Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his

feet, still running feverish half-steps.

An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its

flanks.

The train burns past the wounded Guard.

Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind

him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:

Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming

after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being

chased by a fire-breathing locomotive.

The train burrows to a stop.

Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval

of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that

nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices

something in his hand.

It's the key-ring.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key.

Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.

Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his

own chains.

Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his

arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the

other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT

News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing

smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines

hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work

feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled

wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation

investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted

remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators.

Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S.

marshals emerge:

BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick

shithouse.

RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds

fully-equipped.

POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during

nut-cuttin' time.

NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5.

From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media

spectacle.

As a group they begin moving along the service road above

the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below

them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they

walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.

Biggs spots something...

... and branches off.

They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain

with Gerard.

A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he

sees Gerard's Marshall star.

Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the

scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.

Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's

about to happen.

ANGLE - OLD GUARD

Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his

shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG

SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote

news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the

b.g., listening.

The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard

eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.

The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields

his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos

of all four prisoners.

He switches to a photo of Kimble.

Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred

prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.

He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.

INTERCUT WITH:

ANGLE - CULVERT

Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees

something. He orders Newman into the muck after it.

GERARD

Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.

Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and

we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.

Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents

from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.

He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out.

Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's

manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.

Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to

a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.

Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a

change of story and command.

Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the

Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.

Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.

The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the

press hovering just out of earshot.

Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.

The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.

He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving

downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like

Israelites behind Moses.

INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

ROARS... just above the treetops. Helicopter speeds up a

dark river. Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.

EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT

Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks.

The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment

later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.

EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT

Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with

blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's

going to need stitches.

Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps

moving.

EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN

Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction

of the lights.

A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the

road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2

mile.

ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM

Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he

nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign.

He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison

jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his

breath.

Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off

the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for

cover behind the wrecked car.

The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front

seat and closes the door.

He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets

something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door

and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the

coveralls missing from the seat.

As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite

side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window,

clutching the coveralls.

EXT. CRASH SITE - DAWN

A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the

crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone

lines are pulled down from the lines running along the

tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics.

Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and

relays it to Gerard.

Newman appears.

As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING

from the train crash.

ANGLE - TRAIN CRASH

A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.

EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - MORNING

Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food

outside kitchen entrance. Kimble, in the tow truck

operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside.

Once inside he branches off down a hallway.

INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING

A door opens on a long hallway. A DOCTOR, CHILD with a

bandaged hand, and a MOTHER leave a room and walk TOWARD us.

Behind them, Kimble moves down the hall and stops in front

of the doorway.

closed. Kimble comes INTO FRAME near his face.

KIMBLE

Can you hear me, sir?

No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the

patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his

clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched

breakfast tray.

CUT TO:

INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - NURSES' DUTY STATION - DAY

The Duty Nurse and State Trooper chat when a fax begins

coming through on DESK FAX.

CUT TO:

INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

Kimble dressing in the man's clothes. He eats a piece of

toast - part of the man's breakfast - as he buttons up his

shirt.

ANGLE - PATIENT

His arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call

button.

CUT TO:

INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY

A fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the

duty station FAX MACHINE. Next to the machine the

patient's call light comes on.

The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the

patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the

patient's room.

CUT TO:

INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

Kimble shaving when we hear the DUTY NURSE ENTER the

patient's room. He moves OUT OF FRAME.

ANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST

The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed.

She takes his empty plastic pitcher and...

... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and

refills the pitcher from the sink.

She doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes

into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind

it.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and

a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency

room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the

E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts

down the corridor toward Kimble.

The Trooper looks up as the two men pass...

Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R.

doors behind him.

The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow

trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down

Kimble's cheek.

At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes

it clean as the Trooper looks up.

They laugh.

Kimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks

outside...

EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY

Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The

lead wheels are stuck.

Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney

comes free.

As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face

of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.

Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young

Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.

The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.

As Kimble moves away...

He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk

the Young Guard inside.

ANGLE - AMBULANCE

Kimble climbs behind the wheel.

EXT. TRAIN CRASH SITE / OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A full communications link is in place.

Deputy marshals answer phones, work faxes, add information

to a situation board. Troopers bring in information. Poole

calls Gerard.

Renfro and Poole lay out the details. The download of

information comes clear and fast.

Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the

investigation to take a leak. Followed by Renfro and Poole.

Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard

unzips his fly and relieves himself.

Poole calls out from behind tree.

Gerard zips up.

Renfro won't take it.

... Biggs charges up the hillside.

ANGLE - SITUATION TENT

Gerard moves quickly to the map.

Gerard redraws the circle of units. No longer are we

covering a fifty-mile radius. The circle is redrawn,

tightened, with the hospital as its center. The

triangulation is set.

CUT TO:

EXT. RURAL RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY

The ambulance follows three cars toward a rural railroad

crossing.

INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

Kimble behind the wheel as he approaches the railroad

crossing. The biocom monitors police chatter:

Frequency goes dead. Kimble looks THROUGH the windshield:

ROAD SIGN

An arrow points toward Canton, two miles.

The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal

suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop. Kimble pops

the SIREN and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and

heads in the opposite direction... but his maneuver gets

attention.

INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

Truck driver watches Kimble cut through the crossing and

reaches for his C.B. radio.

EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

Poole hangs up phone.

Renfro turns to the map and marks it. The circle is much

smaller.

The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is

ready to move.

They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter.

INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

Kimble driving down a rural road. He flips down visor and

eyeballs folded roadmap...

EXT. SECONDARY ROAD (KENTUCKY) - DAY

... The ambulance crests a hill. In the distance we see the

Grosvner Viaduct and the Barkley Dam.

EXT. HIGHWAY (KENTUCKY) - DAY

Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and

G-cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of

Southern Illinois. Overtaking them all, a CHOPPER THUNDERS

overhead.

INT. HELICOPTER

Heading into hilly terrain. Down below we see the ambulance.

Inside the helicopter Gerard eyes the terrain.

EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF GROSVNER VIADUCT - DAY

The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred

feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River.

The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into

the tunnel.

ON KIMBLE

Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at

the mouth of the tunnel.

Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat.

ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM)

Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far

entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks.

ANGLE HELICOPTER

Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole.

KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE

Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions.

Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.

EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking

the other end.

Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a

State patrol car blares:

ANGLE ON HELICOPTER

Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar.

They're jacked up and ready to rock. Renfro hands Gerard a

vest.

Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22.

He starts into the tunnel.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three

silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers'

P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb

back inside and lock their doors.

Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the

middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet.

Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the

ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain

clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water.

Running water.

ON MARSHALS

They reach the mid-tunnel area. No Kimble. Biggs looks

around, beneath vehicles. Gerard listens. Poole looks

confused.

Gerard spots the trickle of water. He backtracks it until

he finds a loose grate in the pavement. Man-size.

INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY

Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows

at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction.

A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips

off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues

straight ahead.

Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit

wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong

to...

Gerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the

forking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.

They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go

left. Gerard - straight ahead.

INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

Kimble. Bracing with all four limbs. Negotiating a mossy

downslope.

INT. CONDUIT - DAY

Biggs and Renfro. Sweeping his light as he advances.

Searching for splash-patterns.

INT. CONDUIT - DAY

Gerard. Probing a branch-off tunnel with his light. About to

pass, he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the

branch-off tunnel. Hand marks?

He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with

three limbs

INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

Gerard begins the tricky descent. Slips once. Recovers.

Slips again...

... and tumbles out of control. GUN and RADIO CLATTER AWAY.

Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe.

Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock,

lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets

there first.

It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand

flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

Not my problem.

An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the

silence is broken by Gerard's radio.

Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.

Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up

piece.

INT. CONDUIT - DAY

As Renfro hears FOOTSTEPS POUNDING his way.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Gerard charges down the tunnel. From a side tunnel, Renfro

appears, almost colliding. Biggs follows...

INT. CONDUIT - DAY

Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance

in the tunnel. He spills around a corner and stops. Ahead

lies an orb of light. The tunnel ends. The NOISE is

incredible. Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and

stops.

KIMBLE'S POV

Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam

disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of

mists. No rocks. None visible at least.

He hears the MARSHALS behind him - COMING CLOSER.

ANGLE - MARSHALS

Gerard and Renfro turn the corner. Renfro drops into a

shooting stance.

For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.

Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the

water. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts

up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the

water toward Kimble.

Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the

footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. He jumps.

EXT. BARKLEY DAM - DAY

Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap

into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into

the mists below. He can't believe his eyes.

INT. DRAINAGE CONDUIT - DAY

Renfro lowers his gun.

It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen...

ON GERARD

He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down. He

stares down into the mists. Impressed. It has told him

something invaluable about this fugitive.

EXT. TOP OF DAM - DAY

Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam

near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search

helicopter converge on the site.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend.

The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down

stream. Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble.

EXT. BARKLEY DAM - LOWER RESERVOIR - SUNSET

Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the

shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.

Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.

FROM SHORE

Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with

the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD

ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.

Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain.

He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.

EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a

sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless,

exhausted.

KIMBLE'S DREAM - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - DAY

Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into

tunnel.

INT. DRUG STORE - DAY

Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for

party

to answer. An old lady and her mother shop.

Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble.

ANGLE - PHONE

Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear

RINGING, then a receptionist answers:

Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front

of the hair color. He takes a box of black hair dye off the

shelf and looks at the instructions. When he looks up he

sees the pharmacist looking at him.

EXT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a

new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat,

moves down the road to the diner.

INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER

WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and

tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.

She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around

Kimble begins to occupy his attention:

A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He

stares at him.

A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks

away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is

he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.

Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him

his soup. Where's the first waitress?

Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he

sees:

The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she

going to report him? He fights the paranoia.

A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

ANGLE - TV

A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the

chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death

from the fall.

Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on

the counter and exits.

EXT. DINER - NIGHT

Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until

he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of

the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both

sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly

hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves

faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to

a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the

inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him

chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble

looks at himself. He's shaking.

A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next

to him, passenger window rolls down...

Kimble stares at her.

She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling.

They hold a look as we hear:

CUT TO:

EXT. HOUSE - DAWN

A quiet house on a quiet street out from town. A homeless

woman picks through garbage. A garbage truck moves slowly

down the street. A plumbing truck parked along a curb. Just

early morning traffic.

We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the

street, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see

that Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless

woman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a

radio.

INTERCUT WITH:

In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.

The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his

the door.

INT. HOUSE - DAWN

Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room.

THEIR POV

Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT

A woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING.

GERARD

Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living

room while he moves down the main hall into the back

bedroom.

ANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN

Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door

off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom.

He steps into -

SMALLER BEDROOM

It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to

the bedroom.

HALLWAY

Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and

continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the

woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move

silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman

opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward

the doorway to the kitchen.

Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house.

He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty.

Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

CUT TO:

SMALLER BEDROOM

Newman looks around, suddenly scared. The only place he

didn't search was behind the bedroom door. He turns just as:

COPELAND

Surges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand. In a flash,

Copeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a

knife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the

room.

We...

INTERCUT WITH:

GERARD

He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.

Gerard moves back through the bedroom past the SCREAMING

woman. He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving

fugitive.

ON COPELAND AND NEWMAN

Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs

through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -

LIVING ROOM

Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against

his throat.

GERARD

Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses

at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.

LIVING ROOM

Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the

hallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard.

Suddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He

whips Newman around and we see:

A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too

late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly.

The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head,

stunned but unhurt.

Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the

bedroom doorway.

She does. Immediately.

EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across

the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a

sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly

hysterical, clutching his ear.

They hold a look.

Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.

Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly

unsettling man Gerard is.

EXT. CHICAGO PAY PHONE - MORNING

Kimble makes call. While he waits for phone to be answered

BELLS of Chicago River DRAWBRIDGE.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. LAW OFFICES OF GUTHERIE, MORGAN AND WAINWRIGHT - DAY

Walter Gutherie answers phone from his office overlooking

Lake Michigan.

Gutherie is silent. When he speaks again his speech takes on

the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases.

Kimble picks up the change in his attorney's tone.

CLICK. Gutherie hears the LINE GO DEAD. Kimble's gone.

INT. / EXT. NICHOLS'S CAR - DAY

As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves

toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield.

Nichols waves the man off.

The man shuffles off. Just then a second man appears at his

passenger window. He leans down to wave him away

... then stops - the face at his passenger window is

Richard Kimble's.

Nichols rolls down the passenger window.

Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs

for his wallet...

Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks

back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the

corner and come up the street behind them.

Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to

Kimble, who quickly pockets it.

They hold a look. The stoplight changes to green but they

don't see it.

He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car

behind him POPS its SIREN. Nichols looks into his rearview

mirror. Sees a COP lean out his window.

Nichols looks back at Kimble. He's gone.

INT. U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICES (CHICAGO) - CLOSE ON AUDIO TAPE - DAY

REWINDING. The media room - just what it sounds like -

Renfro rewinds the tape. Gerard, Biggs, Poole and Newman.

Renfro hits play. Kimble's VOICE is heard again:

Renfro removes the two voices. What comes up are the

BACKGROUND SOUNDS. EXTERIOR NOISES (BELLS RINGING, TRAFFIC,

MECHANICAL... TRAINS). Everyone becomes focused to the

sounds now.

At first the sound is unrecognizable. A BELL. GRINDING

MECHANICAL. Then a P.A. VOICE on the tape: "Next stop

Instantly the room is in movement.

Stevens stops.

The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to

from the arm to the man.

where the art once hung. Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the

place. He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it.

INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY

Kimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning

Anne moves to the back. Kimble on the other side.

They laugh. They reach ground level and step out together.

They part ways. Kimble continues out the door. Anne stops

and watches him leave.

INT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT

Kimble sits on the night train going home. He begins looking

at his information.

INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets

of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over

Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents,

making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable

attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking

for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.

Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it

on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and

covers his face.

Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the

Prosthetic Clinic material.

FLASHBACK - FIGHT

Kimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's

sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates.

FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

Reacts in pain. Again. (NOTE: We sense Kimble's mind

returning to something. Getting closer to the key...)

FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

Escaping the bedroom. We hear his FOOTSTEPS DOWN the

STAIRS... a DOOR SLAM. FOOTSTEPS again.

Another DOOR SLAMS, but this time the sound is distinctly

different... a CAR DOOR.

INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM (BACK TO PRESENT)

Kimble yanks the wet rag from his face, his senses alert.

Listening, he hears: FOOTSTEPS are real, just outside and

MOVING TOWARD him.

HARD CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

A car door slams. We see unmarked police cars pulling up in

front of the apartment. Cops are moving toward the house.

INT. BASEMENT - DAY

Kimble turns off his light, moves from the bed to the window.

Carefully looks out:

KIMBLE'S POV

Unmarked police cars in front of the house, looking, moving

his way.

BACK TO SCENE

Kimble moves instinctively to the back door.

He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees

the back courtyard covered by more cops.

Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move,

he's sweating, preparing for the worst.

He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of

charging through the basement door they move up the front

steps and into the house overhead.

Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

KIMBLE'S POV - BACK STEPS

Kimble SEES the Punk Kid try to escape out the back. He

runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door,

actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and

pulled away.

KIMBLE

Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the

Punk Kid out to the car.

POLICE RADIOS call the other cops to stand down.

Kimble moves slowly to his front door. Looks out.

KIMBLE'S POV

Cops put the young man into an unmarked police car. His

grandmother, the Polish woman, follows them, crying.

BACK TO SCENE

Kimble leans against the wall, exhausted.

INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kimble carries his cleaning tray down busy hallway just

outside of the Prosthetic Clinic and stops.

KIMBLE'S POV

Two cops talk outside the Prosthetic Clinic.

BACK TO SCENE

Kimble backs to a safe place in the trauma hallway to wait

for them to leave.

CUT TO:

INT. 11TH STREET POLICE DISTRICT HOUSE - DETECTIVES ROOM - NIGHT

The Punk Kid is handcuffed to a bench as a cop works on a

report. Suddenly the Kid notices something that gets his

attention.

KID'S POV

A wanted poster of Kimble over the cop's head.

BACK TO SCENE

The Kid sees - Wanted for Murder - realizes who it is.

The cop looks up, sees Kimble's poster and then back at the

Kid.

CUT TO:

INT. TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kimble moves toward prosthetic clinic. In passing through

the trauma hallway he becomes aware of a crisis developing.

A major accident has happened, victims are being brought in.

The P.A. CALLS for doctors. STATIC.

ANGLE ON FAR END OF TRAUMA HALLWAY

Elevator doors open as orderlies bring in new patients.

Some walk, some are helped by family and police. Nurses

direct traffic.

Orders fly. Medicines are called. Family members yell for

doctors. Ask for the injured. Anne picks up the pace with

an ORDERLY wheeling a gurney carrying a young patient,

a BOY.

Anne checks the boy's chart.

Orderlies quickly move the non-life-threatening patients out

of the hall. Still more help is needed. Anne spots Kimble.

Kimble nods. Anne moves to another patient.

Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the

hall. As he pushes he looks at the kid's X-rays.

Anne looks up, barks another order, then suddenly sees Kimble

pushing the gurney and looking at the film.

ANNE

Tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a

better look, but Kimble is gone. She goes back to work.

ON KIMBLE

He wheels the Boy's gurney into an elevator. The doors

close.

INT. HOSPITAL - O.R. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Kimble wheels the gurney down the hall and stops the Boy

on the scrub threshold to the O.R. and stops a SURGEON.

A Surgeon pauses and eyes Kimble's janitor suit and the

gurney.

He takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the X-rays and

yells to O.R. nurse.

He looks up, Kimble is gone.

INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

Kimble enters the Prosthetic Clinic computer room. The

Technician from the day before is listening to her Walkman,

sees Kimble and waves. Kimble waves back and turns into the

glass-walled computer room and closes the door.

He closes the blinds and turns on the computer.

CUT TO:

INT. CRITICAL CARE UNIT - NIGHT

The crisis has wound down. Anne moves into the room and

begins checking patients. She stops a unit nurse, GLADYS.

INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

Kimble scans DOS files, each an eight-letter enigma. Finds

one with promise and loads it up.

He backs up and tries another file.

"CLIENT DEMOGRAPHIC ORGANIZER SEARCH BY: AGE, SEX, RACE,

LIMB, OR OTHER?"

Kimble knows he's got it.

INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE ON SCREEN - NIGHT

Kimble keys in these responses:

INT. OPERATING ROOM WING - NIGHT

Anne comes out of the stairwell and stops the Surgeon we

saw with Kimble.

He heads to the operating room, leaving her stunned. She

stares at the scrawled orders.

CUT TO:

INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE ON SCREEN - NIGHT

A "PLEASE WAIT" message appears on the screen. We hear the

COMPUTER PROCESSING, searching, narrowing.

The screen flashes:

"NUMBER OF POSSIBLE CANDIDATES: 75

DO YOU WISH TO SUBDIVIDE?"

Kimble types in another defining characteristic...

Residence: Illinois.

Again he waits. Rattles the blinds to make it seem like he's

cleaning. The list shortens.

"NUMBER OF POSSIBLE CANDIDATES: 21"

MEMORY HIT - INT. CHICAGO COURTROOM - DAY

Prosecutor stands before the jury.

PROSECUTOR

Kimble thinks.

CUT TO:

INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT

Joint repair list between January 21-April 21... Five names

come up with Greater Chicago addresses.

Kimble hits print. The MACHINE begins PRINTING. Kimble

looks up at the Prosthetic Clinic Technician - she is

listening to her headphones, can't hear the printer. He

continues to shake the blinds.

EXT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC/TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kimble leaves Prosthetic Clinic and starts down the hall

for the exit when a voice stops him.

Kimble turns to see Anne coming toward him.

She moves in on him. He eyes the exit.

What do you want?

She reaches him.

They hold a look. She knows. He takes a step back and she

pulls his I.D.

Kimble runs. Anne turns to call security but doesn't.

She stares after Kimble.

CUT TO:

INT. POLISH WOMAN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

Kimble's room being searched by the marshals. Gerard finds

the flyer Kimble was handed on his way out the door. On it

we see: COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL.

CUT TO:

INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - CLOSE ON KIMBLE'S I.D. - DAY

Anne and Gerard stand in the hallway. Gerard studies the I.D.

Gerard watches her eyes carefully.

Clearly this is news to Anne. Gerard almost smiles at her

surprise.

He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's

gurney. Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that

place. Renfro and the other deputies converge.

Gerard considers this as a Man passes him. Gerard notices

something.

Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and

follows the Man down the hall.

The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the

Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him,

holds the hallway door open for Gerard.

We see the Man has a prosthetic arm and that they are outside

the door marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

INT. PHONE BOOTH - MORNING

Restaurant deserted at this hour. Kimble makes calls.

He scratches through another name. Three left. He dials

another number.

INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - MORNING

Gerard and his deputies inside the Prosthetic Clinic.

Artificial limbs are being tested, fitted. A technician

fits a demonstration model on Biggs while Gerard and Poole

work with the director of the institute and a data operator

at the computer.

The operator enters that information. Dropping the number to

250... as Poole continues.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Kimble on phone. He hangs up and scratches through another

Gerard looks at the screen. The number drops to 20.

Gerard picks up phone and dials a number.

CUT TO:

EXT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY

Kimble stands on a sidewalk, staring at the imposing edifice

across the street. After a here-we-go breath, he starts

through traffic.

INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY

Kimble waits for an elevator. It opens to reveal a pack of

staring COPS.

Forcing his feet to move, Kimble boards...

INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - ELEVATOR - DAY

... and pivots quickly. Elevator rises. Floor-indicator moves

deathly slow.

Kimble feels the breath of a dozen COPS on his neck. And just

when his floor is mercifully about to arrive...

Overhead lights flicker, and the elevator jars to a stop

between floors.

Abruptly they're moving again. Kimble's heart restarts with

the elevator.

INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - VISITATION AREA - DAY

"Next" is Kimble. He steps to the counter.

The Clearing Officer spins his clipboard around.

INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - MAIN LOBBY - DAY

Gerard and Biggs cross the lobby and stop in front of the

Gerard and Biggs head for the bank of elevators.

INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - VISITATION AREA - DAY

Clearing Officer looks down the hall.

Kimble is on his feet.

CLEARING OFFICER

Booth seven. No hands on the glass. Be advised...

The Clearing Officer, head down, drones on - doesn't notice

Kimble is already gone.

Kimble strides down the row of chairs, rounds the last

partition to reach booth seven - and to stare at the

one-armed man, DRISCOLL, who waits there.

CUT TO:

MEMORY HIT - FACE OF HELEN'S KILLER

CUT TO:

BACK TO SCENE

Driscoll's face is different. Driscoll is a black man.

But Kimble is gone. Driscoll calls after him.

INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - CORRIDOR - DAY

Kimble exits the visitor's area. He sees another crowd of

COPS around the elevator again, opts for the door marked:

"STAIRS"

INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY

Biggs and Gerard wait for the elevator. Finally Gerard's

had enough.

He finds the door and starts up.

INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - STAIRWELL - DAY

Kimble descending. Doors open and close throughout the

stairwell but the traffic is light...

INTERCUT WITH:

GERARD

Climbing the stairs. He reaches a landing - and skims

shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down.

Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet.

One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the

shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. He leans over the

stairwell railing to spy...

Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be

any dark-haired man. But still...

Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two

landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain

his step, keeps moving.

But Gerard is pulling his Glock: The hitch in Kimble's

stride told him everything.

Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.

INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY

Kimble throws open a fire door and starts across the lobby.

Sees two cops, quickly approaches.

The two cops rush to stairs and Kimble immediately moves

toward the doors, fast but not running. Hoping to cloak

himself in civilians.

ANGLE ON ELEVATORS

Biggs' elevator has finally arrived and emptied. He lets a

woman on in front of him, oblivious to...

Kimble moving...

The revolving exit doors loom nearer ant nearer.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

The two cops see Gerard. Gerard holds up his badge.

He shoves the cops out of the way and pounds downstairs.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a KLAXON HORN

sounds.

People stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors

begin closing. Biggs pushes his way off the elevator.

Kimble breaks into a sprint for the door.

GERARD

Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble.

But there's only one way of stopping Kimble.

KIMBLE

Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the

outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble

is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door

- trapping him partially inside the revolving door.

Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees

Gerard.

Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists -

but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd,

shoves a man out of his line of fire.

With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the

opening...

EXT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY

... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like

in a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks

back over his shoulder at...

Gerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and

clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.

It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his

leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as

INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY

Gerard FIRES seven times in two seconds.

Kimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A

long beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with

bullet holes, he sees...

Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's

alive. He runs free.

Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the

glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor.

It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble

rush across the street and disappear into the parade.

Doors open and Gerard and his men follow.

But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations

outside. Blending in with the marchers.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOTEL - MORNING

Kimble leaves a cheap hotel early the next morning. He wears

a new set of clothes - jeans, sport coat and tie - than the

day before, and the black hair coloring has been rinsed from

his hair. He moves down the street.

INT. BAR - MORNING

Kimble uses a pay phone and stares through the window.

KIMBLE'S POV - APARTMENT HOUSE

Across the street.

INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING

Inside the apartment the PHONE RINGS. No one is home.

INT. BAR - MORNING

The PHONE RINGS nine, ten times. As Kimble waits he looks

down at his list of five. The only name remaining is

Fredrick Sykes.

He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus

shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car

parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans

across the seat and opens the door for him.

He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in,

he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a

handgun.

Kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door.

EXT. REAR OF SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING

Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind

Sykes' apartment. He looks in the window, steps back to see

if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his

sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS.

INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

No sound. Slowly he moves into...

HALLWAY

Moving first toward the living room. The apartment is

modest.

He stops by a photograph of a teenage girl. Another is a

boy in football uniform. The next one is a man in a

police uniform. Kimble freezes.

KIMBLE

Looks up. He's found the man he's looking for but also a new

possibility - that the murder wasn't just a random act of

violence.

Kimble digs through Sykes' top desk drawer. His mind reeling.

He stops:

Roosevelt suddenly goes on the defensive.

On the mention of Kimble, Roosevelt becomes visibly nervous.

Biggs and Newman exchange a look.

He moves away from the autopsy table. Biggs stops him.

Roosevelt looks from one marshal to the other as we:

EXT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL EL STATION - NIGHT

Kimble starts up the stairs to the station just as a train

the last car. The train moves out.

CUT TO:

INT. GERARD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Gerard stares at his board. Stevens comes to the door.

He goes back to the board but Stevens isn't finished.

Gerard looks up.

Gerard stares at the deputy, thinking - something doesn't

click. Stevens sees the empty stare, then Gerard looks

back at his board.

Poole enters with Kimble's arrest transcript. Gerard takes

the transcript as Renfro appears at the door.

As Gerard looks up, we -

CUT TO:

INT. DOWNTOWN EL TRAIN - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

Sits in the front car. There are very few other riders.

A man with newspaper sits across the car reading. The

headlines facing Kimble say: "KIMBLE IN CHICAGO". Kimble's

booking photo stares back at him.

Kimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns

the pages.

The man looks over the newspaper at Kimble, then goes back

to reading. A moment later he folds the paper back to the

front page.

The man looks up from the paper and looks at Kimble again,

then down.

Coolly the man folds the paper, tucks it under his arm,

stands, looks through the car, then moves into one of the

rear cars.

Kimble looks out the window - hoping desperately for his

car to reach the station. He keeps his head turned until

the man is gone.

ANGLE - THROUGH CENTER OF TRAIN - NIGHT

From the center of Kimble's car we see the man with the

newspaper move up to a TRANSIT COP. They begin talking.

Kimble stands, coming INTO the SHOT. We see him watching

the discussion.

Suddenly a man, sitting in the rear of the car, stands

and blocks Kimble's view of the Cop. It's Sykes. His gun

is drawn.

CUT TO:

The train is not yet to the station. He has no escape.

Sykes moves toward him.

Kimble stares hard at Sykes. He steps toward the side

exit.

Suddenly the door behind Sykes opens and the Transit Cop

enters.

Sykes - the gun tucked next to his side - turns.

The Cop sees Sykes' gun, reacts...

But Sykes FIRES first, shoots the cop FOUR TIMES.

As the Cop falls, Sykes turns quickly to finish Kimble.

But Kimble pulls the emergency brake over the door.

two windows of the front car are over the platform.

INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

Sykes is thrown to the floor - the gun slips from his grasp.

Kimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble

in the stomach, knocks him back. The fight carries on

throughout the car.

Kimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and

aims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and

almost smiles.

SYKES

Go ahead. You don't have it in you .

For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the

gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face.

Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun,

driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost

unconscious.

Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit

Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead.

Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the

Cop's belt. He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the

Cop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop.

He pockets the keys and grabs Sykes' hair, pulls his face

off the floor.

He moves to the front of the car with Sykes' and the Transit

Cop's guns out. People back out of his way. He moves to

where the first two windows extend over the platform, kicks

out the front window and...

EXT. TRAIN STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

... drops to the station platform. Kimble lowers his head and

moves down the uncrowded platform to the station.

INT. GERARD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Heavily-armed CPD units pull up. Gerard stares at the police

presence. He starts toward the hotel where Kelly is

conferring with Kevlar-decked police captain.

The captain moves off. Gerard intercepts the cop.

Kelly moves off. Gerard watches him a moment then he looks

up to the roof. Newman hands Gerard his belt with his

backup piece.

He moves into the hotel with his deputies.

CUT TO:

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

Nichols moves to the last of his speech as Kimble enters

at the rear

Nichols stops his speech - stunned to see Kimble.

Kimble begins moving down the aisle past the tables of

doctors toward the podium.

We see the faces of Kimble's colleagues and friends from

the ballroom sequence earlier. At first no one notices

Kimble but as he makes his way toward the dais, the

applause fades and then room quiets. Whispers of:

Stunned expressions.

Kimble continues to the front, talking to Nichols as if

the room were empty.

Nichols remains calm.

Nichols stares at Kimble and for the first time we see a

flicker of concern.

Nichols and Kimble hold a look. Nichols turns to the audience.

Nichols leaves the dais and heads toward the exit.

Kimble tracks along with him - moving through the tables -

passing the table with the Devlin-MacGregor board of

directors. They are disturbed by this situation.

ON NICHOLS

Moves through a door and exits into...

Kimble goes flying, stunned. Nichols locks the door.

Nichols pulls Kimble to his feet.

He hits him again, drives him back into the library.

Kimble tries to recover as Nichols relentlessly stays on

him. He pulls him up, slams him against the fire escape

doors.

He drives a blow into Kimble's stomach.

He shoves Kimble through the door out into...

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE BALCONY - NIGHT

... and almost over the railing. Kimble grabs the rail to

keep from dropping to the street. Nichols closes on him,

but Kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks

Nichols back against the other side of fire escape.

two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs.

Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a

security camera.

Who slams Nichols hard against the glass. The WIRED

GLASS CRACKS and bellies with the form of their bodies.

Nichols' head rocks from the impact.

INT. HILTON LAUNDRY - NIGHT

... a huge industrial laundry room. Steam rises from the

giant machines.

INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT

Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves

carefully into the laundry.

... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with

DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry

move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of

heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers.

... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses

stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by

conveyor and dollies to automated dryers.

The NOISE is DEAFENING.

INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Gerard comes down back stairwell. Followed by Renfro.

INTERCUT WITH:

NEWMAN IN SECURITY

Newman checks the computer board for the elevator

position.

INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT

Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an

exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible

grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving.

KIMBLE

Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He

stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of

the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving

between the large conveyors.

ANGLE - SORTING ROOM

Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters

standing by a small conveyor as he enters.

He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry

worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead

rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off

switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker

takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.

Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the

main room.

He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main

room.

INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.

He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the

dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt

him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.

Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a

voice from the other end of the laundry.

Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.

ON NICHOLS

Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room

where Gerard enters.

ON GERARD

The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.

They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves

up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both

move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated

equipment.

The building is locked down.

CUT TO:

KIMBLE

Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near

the conveyor belts.

ON GERARD

RENFRO

Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag

comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins,

dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.

KIMBLE

Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with

Nichols.

GERARD

Moving through the forest of massive bags.

KIMBLE

Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.

NICHOLS

Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the

killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and

chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the

hanging control for the I-beam.

GERARD

Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He

dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can

see straight back toward the washers.

ON RENFRO

He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks

under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a

WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes

rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor,

opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.

NICHOLS

Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty

shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand.

Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.

GERARD

Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor

belts. He makes one last appeal.

KIMBLE

Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His

shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.

GERARD

Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He

pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back

on us...

NICHOLS

Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just

before he fires however he hears...

Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick

and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor

behind Gerard.

GERARD

Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble

with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes

instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.

Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.

They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the

room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.

INT. / EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan

Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie

for space in front of the Hilton Towers.

ambulance. The doors close.

REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk

giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom.

We PICK UP pieces of their reports as we MOVE PAST them

EXT. HOTEL / INT. CAR - NIGHT

As soon as the group exits the hotel. Television lights

flood the scene. Kimble lowers his head. Reporters crowd

forward, yelling questions.

Gerard wants the crowd controlled.

The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into

a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back

door and helps Kimble inside.

Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next

to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.

Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks

Kimble's handcuffs.

Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the

pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.

They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.

HELICOPTER POV

The car carrying Kimble pulls onto Michigan Avenue heading

back downtown. As we PULL BACK we see Kimble's car - at

first alone on the great avenue - then gradually joined

by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the

traffic, movement and lights of the city.
