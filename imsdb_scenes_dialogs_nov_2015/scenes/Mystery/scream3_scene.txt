Scream 3 - early draft

EHREN KRUGER

2nd DRAFT - REVISED

MAY 2, 1999

FADE IN:

A big dramatic crescendo as we --

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - SUNSET - AERIAL

Friday night traffic as usual. Things appear to be backed up all the way to

the valley. A cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly

DISSOLVE INTO:

INT.  FORD EXPLORER - NIGHT

A new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock. Behind the wheel is hot

teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody BEN DAMON. Ben is handsome, studly, in

his early 20s. However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city

of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick. Ben's in the middle of a heated

argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy.

Ben socks the steering wheel out of frustration. The horn blares

uncomfortably.

Ben's phone rings. He answers it.

But of course, we notice Ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the

conversation short.

Ben smiles.

Ben hangs up. He reclines back in his seat. Camera slowly pans out the

windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. He's not going

anywhere.

CLOSE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

Ben opens the glove compartment. Papers scatter out. Ben reaches for a card.

CLOSE ON CARD -

A small white business card:   1-900-WET-4-COCK

Ben smiles, begins to dial out when suddenly, RING RING! The cell comes to

life in his hand.

Ben smiles.

You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben

Damon.

The voice seems to have changed tones. It now sounds a lot harsher, angrier if

you will.

*NOTE: At this point we intercut shots of the empty lobby and halls of the

PLAZA THEATER. A POV shot standing outside the LADIES ROOM door.

Ben groans. He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only  he'd have

paid attention to Christine he might have known this.

Click. The killer hangs up. Ben flips open the phone, dials 911. Ringing and

then . . .

Ben hangs up, dials CHRISTINE's number. RINGING, then--

IN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming.

The killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV

into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car

screeches down the off ramp.

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

Ben comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER.  Tires smoking.

Sparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the

awaiting b.g.

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT

The SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps

out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing

ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into

his SUV, gets an idea.

THE BACK --

--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not

gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE

SLUGGER with "ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER" written across it.

Ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards

the sign when suddenly --

HIS CELL RINGS.

Ben answers the call.

Ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. He approaches the

sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.

Ben passes under the huge, pallid "H" in the sign. What seems at first like a

gentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead. He rolls back his head, his legs

turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.

Has been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in

the "H" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the

Southern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows,

not seeing --

THE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand.  In one quick, brutal

stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around,

face to face with his attacker.

AND WITH that, the GHOST drives the bloodstained knife into Ben's heart,

causing a vicious eruption of crimson.

GALE WEATHERS, the flashy thirty-something news anchor and author of the

WOODSBORO MURDERS. She sits behind a desk on the really ditzy, loud set for

TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT, an ET style program with a live studio audience.

CAMERA pans across the audience. Many of them are dressed as the GHOST. A sea

of white screaming faces. Very eerie and unsettling.

The crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as ROMAN BRIDGER,

ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy

white suit. He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a STAB 3 coffee

mug beside Gale's hand.

A eclectic hush falls over the crowd. Roman appears somewhat sinister in this

light. Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes.

Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into

applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second

rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of

the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her

imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as

if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.

A LOUD BUZZING O.S.  Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign

hanging over the stage. THE WORD "COMMERCIAL BREAK" is illuminated in flashing

red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to

Roman.

Gale bolts for --

INT.  BACKSTAGE - TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY

Gale races around the corner of the set, smashing right into -

DETECTIVE MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Mid-thirties. Handsome with piercing eyes. He

grabs Gale by her shoulders, shepherding her aside.

Detective Kincaid reaches into his back pocket, pulls up a newspaper clipping

in a ziplock evidence bag. He holds the bag up For Gale to see.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on the ARTICLE . . . "MAUREEN PRESCOTT, MOTHER AND WIFE, FOUND

BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED IN BEDROOM". A b/w photo of Sidney's mother

Maureen stands hauntingly before the camera.

Kincaid flips the article over. Someone has scrawled in black marker across

the back "SIDNEY".

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY

A red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY

RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of

. . . STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO.

All around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. Dewey

parks his car outside a soundstage, exits.

INT.  STAB 3 SET - DAY

A huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane

hanger.  In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes. In another

corner stands the infamous Becker house where the nightmare all began. In

other regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the

Woodsboro Police Station,  A TOP STORY news van, etc.

DEWEY, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego --

TOM PRINZE, a Hollywood poster boy. Very cool. Not so debonair. A shoddy copy

of Dewey at best. However, the conversation between the two is friendly, and

they exchange greetings.

Dewey's obviously gotten a lot colder since the last film. He walks past a

clique of STAB 3'S MAIN CAST:

There's:

SARAH DARLING: 30, playing a 25 year old bimbo. Very hot. Very blonde. Ample

cleavage.

ANGELINA TYLER: 20. Extremely nadve looking. She won her part in STAB 3

playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest. She's timid, with short dark

hair. Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got.

And also the loveable

TYSON JACKSON: late 20's, African-American, all attitude.

The three flip through pages of the STAB 3 script, conversing freely about the

production.

Tom walks into frame, sits down next to Angelina, subtly putting his arm

around her. She shoves him away.

Totally repulsed, Angelina gets up, races off set.

Tom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at Sarah with

bedroom eyes.

Sarah, following suit laid by Angelina, scampers off set. Tom looks up at

Tyson, smoke blowing out his nostrils.

Tyson races off set. Tom laughs, covers his face.

DETECTIVE KINCAID AND GALE.

They walk through the set. Gale's mesmerized. Kincaid is all business.

The pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher

Residence. Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat

on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. Even a foam dummy Of TATUM RIELLY

dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess.

GALE stares at the swaying dummy, haunted.

GALE looks up. DEWEY stands beside her.

Dewey stares daggers through Gale. There is a real bitter coldness between the

two.

Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly

growing.

Kincaid nods.

Dewey walks off camera. Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder.

Gale nods as Kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set. A Shrill voice

O.S.

Jennifer Jolie, an ambitious young starlet, playing GALE in the latest Stab,

rushes towards her, with arms wide open. She's decked out in the flashy neon

green ensemble Gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on

her right eye. Gale is obviously pissed. She knows this actress and doesn't

really want to be in her company very long.

Dewey steps back into the picture, cell phone in hand.

Gale stares at the couple, just processing things in her head.

Dewey walks away leaving Gale alone. Kincaid enters frame, 	talking to two

producers. The elder, sixty-five year old BUDDY SHAYNE, a towering, hefty man

with gray hair. The second, bigwig horror producer JOHN MILTON, a creepy

fifty-something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor. The two talk,

ignoring Gale the entire time.  She's almost eavesdropping on their

conversation.

Before Kincaid can finish, Gale buts in.

Milton nods his head, flags down the guard. He walks away.

Milton storms off camera, Buddy following close behind. Gale looks up at

Kincaid.

Kincaid hands Gale his card, begins to walk out of the building.

SIDNEY PRESCOTT, the stoic, survivor. Now 24, she lies peacefully in bed, her

black lab PETE curled up in a ball at her feet. A noise startles the animal

awake. It sets off the bed barking hysterically at --

THE BEDROOM WINDOW

SIDNEY --

--awakens. She squints her eyes to try and make out what her dog is going into

conniptions over. Then she sees, and her face loses any trace of color.

MAUREEN PRESCOTT'S GHOSTLY WRAITH is pressed up against the window. She's

wearing a tattered, blood soaked night shift.  Her voice is muted but her lips

are moving as if trying torelay a message to Sidney. Sid's hysterical crying.

She slidesoff her bed, makes her way towards the window when suddenly --

MAUREEN slides down the glass, as if being pulled by somethingbeneath the

window sill. Something we don't see . . . yet.

Left behind in her wake are five bloody streaks running downthe glass. The

streaks begin to bleed, as if each wounds themselves. They bleed right through

the glass. Sidneyreaches out to touch them when suddenly --

THE GHOST springs up behind the window, shatters the glass panewith his fist.

SIDNEY screams --

AWAKENING IN BED FROM HER NIGHTMARE.

Her dog's barking wildly.

THE WINDOW is fine.

SID crawls out of bed, disappearing out of the room.

Sid's washing up at the sink. She wipes the tears from her eyes.She shuts off

the running water, looks up into the mirror. Her demeanor definitely shows the

ware and tear of all that's happened to her in her past.

CLOSE on SIDNEY'S WRISTS.  Two ugly scars run up Sid's wrists.Battle Scars of

a war waged between her own personal demons if you wish. Former Suicide

Attempts former engraved on time.

Sid's house is deep within the Napa Valley. Secluded amongst verdant vineyards

and orchards that are now covered by thedarkness of night. A full moon hangs

ominously in the sky above.

A light burns from within the two story farmhouse. A phone dialing out rises

in pre-lap as we --

INT.  SID'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sid sits in a cluttered office. On the wall hangs a poster forthe FALL OF TROY

(her play from SCREAM 2) and a poster proclaiming WOMEN'S RIGHTS with

CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS center written beneath that.

A THREE-RING BINDER with a cover boasting CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS CENTER is

thrown open.

THE PHONE--

SID PUTS ON A HEADSET, dials a number. RINGING.

A click. A woman's voice comes on the other line. It sounds very familiar.

Sid reaches for the remote control, flips on a small TV lying across the

office.

ON THE TV --

A REPORTER stands with the HOLLYWOOD SIGN in the b.g.

Sidney shuts off the TV as a familiar voice cuts through the din:

The killer laughs coldly. Sidney wanes.

Click. The killer hangs up. Sid's left trembling. She rips the headset out of

the phone, reaches into her desk for a loaded.38 special.  She stands up, and

peers out her office window.

SIDNEY'S P.O.V. - THE DARK, OMINOUS NIGHT.

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - NIGHT

Sarah Darling drives through the main gates in her porshe, rounds a corner.

EXT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Sarah parks outside the production offices, gets out of her car.

KILLER'S P.O.V - watching from the rooftop, Sarah approaching the dimly lit

offices.

INT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Sarah steps into the office. It's desolate. Silent. All over the place are

promotional items (standees, posters, banners) for STABS 1-3. Sarah passes a

big cardboard GHOST.

Sarah walks down a hallway.

Sarah passes Roman Bridger's office. It's half-open.

Sarah continues further down the hall when suddenly --

TYSON comes reeling out of a doorway, a huge knife jutting out his back, blood

trickling down his mouth. Sarah lets out a bloodcurdling scream while Tyson

breaks into hysterics.

Stan, a bearded, middle aged make-up effects guy steps out behind Tyson, slaps

him a high-five.

Stan pantomimes the "blow job" gesture. Tyson laughs, slaps him another high-

five. Sarah makes a disgusted face as the two men leave the offices. Sarah

sighs, ducks into Roman's office.

INT.  ROMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Roman's office is a clutter of old movie memorabilia. Sarah plops down behind

Roman's desk, admires his old TRANSFORMER toys and two brass MUSIC VIDEO

AWARDS. Sarah examines the award.

The phone rings scaring the shit out of Sarah. She drops the award, causing it

to smash against the edge of the desk, snapping the head clean off. Sarah

hesitates, answers the call, putting it on speaker phone.

Sarah tries fixing the award with some scotch tape.

A pause, then a familiar dark natured noise enters our ears, the killer's

sinister voice.

Sarah tosses down the phone, bolts out of the office.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sarah stops in her tracks. Through the smoked glass of the front door she sees

a shape approaching. She screams, spins around, runs for the prop room.

INT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah locks the door, backs up right into --

AN ARMY OF GHOSTS!

AT LEAST THIRTY GHOST COSTUMES dangle from hooks on costume racks. Sarah

catches her breath, dives into one of the racks.  She pulls up her cell phone,

starts to dial.

INT.  STAB 3 - PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

A SECURITY GUARD opens the front door, pokes his head into the offices.

No answer. The guard nods, backs out of the offices, locking them with SARAH

and the killer inside!

INT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah's waiting on eggs as a digitized pre-programmed commissarymenu for

Sunrise Studios drags out.

Sarah momentarily glances behind her, just noticing, a pair of black work

boots stepping off the costume rack. Before Sarah has a chance to scream, the

ghost jumps down and shoves the rack hard sending a screaming Sarah into the

next room. She goes flying out, slamming into a metal table covered with prop

weapons.

THE GHOST --

Stomps into the second prop room, knife raised. Sarah leaps up, starts to

chuck the prop knives at her attacker, screaming furiously.

THE PROP knives, hit the ghost, and bend as they bounce off his body and onto

the floor. The killer shakes his head angrily, stalks towards his prey.

The ghost drives his knife into Sarah's chest, once, twice, and delivers a

final killing blow to her Adam's apple. She staggers forward. Her killer grabs

her by her long buxom hair, and hucks her into a glass door.

THE DOOR EXPLODES, SARAH'S BODY falling through, shards of glass tearing out

her back.

THE KILLER, stands in the shattered doorway, bloody knife in hand. An alarm

resonates in the b.g. The killer wipes his knife clean, races off screen.

A NICE PSYCHO-ESQUE close up of the dead Sarah's eye as Blood swirls into the

pupil.

EXT.  HIGHWAY 39 -  N. CALIFORNIA - NIGHT

The highway is desolate. It's late. Sidney speeds into frame in her HONDA

CIVIC.

INT.  HONDA CIVIC - NIGHT

Sidney's tapping her thumbs nervously against the steering wheel as an eerie

song filters off the radio. The only light comes from the unsettling neon

green digital clock/radio read-out. Sidney increases speed.

EXT.  HIGHWAY 39 -  N. CALIFORNIA - NIGHT

Sid passes up a road sign indicating LOS ANGELES - 64 MILES

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - NIGHT - EST.

The lot Is crawling with police vehicles.

INT.   STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Kincaid and Gale stare at Sarah Darling's corpse as it's zippered up into a

black rubber body bag and carried off by forensic technicians.

Gale's eyes light up. She grabs Kincaid's shoulders.

Gale smiles. DETECTIVE TOM WALLACE, Kincaid's cohort and partner. He's in his

late thirties. Family man. Wallaceenters frame with a folder in his hands.

Wallace arrogantly walks off camera. Gale looks at Kincaid.

CUT TO:

INT.  INTEROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A frazzled Roman is seated at a long conference table while Wallace and

Kincaid grill him with questions.

Camera pans through a two-way mirror into . . .

INT.  VIEWING ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

GALE AND DEWEY stand, gazing through the two-way mirror. Roman can't see them.

They watch nervously.

But Dewey doesn't answer. Again, he's staring daggers through Gale.  Years and

years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing.

Dewey races out the room. Gale pauses, stares at the interrogation. Wallace

has reduced Roman to tears. It's pathetic. Gale bolts after Dewey.

CUT TO:

EXT.  SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

The wind rushes past the camera. A huge panoramic view of L.A.  FULL MOON

hangs in the sky. A coyote howls in the near distance.

CUT TO:

EXT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A nice low ranch tucked away in the valley. Dewey rolls up Jennifer's driveway

in his truck. Gale follows behind in her VW JETTA.

Dewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house. Gale runs back to

shut off her car. From out of the bushes lunges --

TOM PRINZE, loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of JOHNNY

WALKER BLACK LABEL SCOTCH in his hand.

Gale pushes Tom's chest. Stopping him.

Tom and Gale walk into the house. Something stirs in the bushes.

INT.  JENNIFER JOLLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gale and Tom enter. Jennifer is crying hysterically in Dewey's arms. She sees

Gale, looks up with anger written all over her gaudy, over rouged face, her

make-up running in a comical, almost homage to Mimi on the Drew Carey Show.

Everyone is silent. Dewey nods his head. Gale rips the script from Jennifer's

hands.

A teary-eyed Angelina Tyler rises up from the couch, approaches the group.

Tom throws his arm around Angelina, squeezes her tightly.

Angelina squeals in disgust, elbows Tom, racing out of the house.  Tom groans,

follows after her.

CUT TO:

EXT.   JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tom walks out into the darkness, looks around. Angelina's nowherein sight.

side of the house. A noise catches his attention.   A low, muffled squealing.

Tom turns to a guest house. The door is half open, darkness  spilling out. Tom

smirks, steps inside.

BLACKENED BY THE NIGHT. Tom cockily waltzes about, not noticing one of the

black shadows peeling off the wall.

IT'S THE GHOST!

is ANGELINA TYLER! Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of --

ghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air. He slowly begins to

lift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow. Tom

gags. He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a

trickle of blood down his lips.

THE GHOST brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the

closet. Tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp. The GHOST

steps back, admiring his work.

INT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey are pacing around nervously.

Suddenly, a knock at the door. The three are startled. Dewey looks at the

front door.

Jennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale. Dewey reaches into a holster tucked

away under his jacket, drawing up his 9mm.

Dewey nods his head, slowly makes his way towards the door. Gale and Jennifer

huddle together, follow close behind.

Gale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully.

Dewey steps up to the front door. IT'S NOT LOCKED.  He reaches for the knob,

turns it when suddenly --

THE POWER SIZZLES OUT!

EVERYONE SCREAMS!

Dewey throws open the door. ANGELINA'S CORPSE drops into the doorway. A

SYMPHONY OF SCREAMS.

Dewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading

outside to the pool and backyard. A PHONE RINGS somewhere in the house.

Jennifer answers her cellular.

THE GHOST comes running out of closet, knife swinging wildly. Jennifer

screams, races for the patio door. The ghost lunges for Gale. Dewey draws up

his gun, fires.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The GHOST takes six slugs

In the chest.  He goes smashing through a coffee table, motionless. Dewey

backs into Gale's arms, smoke rising fromthe muzzle of the gun.

Dewey turns Gale towards the patio door. A noise O.S. Dewey pauses, turns

around --

THE GHOST IS GONE.

Dewey looks to the patio door.

SO IS JENNIFER.

The ghost barrels out from under the couch, knife raised. Dewey winds back,

kicks a chair out in the Ghost's path. The ghost trips, goes crashing through

the chair, coming smashing down onto the floor, knife burying into the

hardwood. Dewey and Gale run for the patio when suddenly --

JENNIFER comes dodging out of the kitchen wielding a butcher knife.

Jennifer slips on something, goes backflipping to the ground. Gale grabs her.

Helps her up.

THE GHOST comes to life, grabbing a lighter off an end table. He lights  a

trail of gasoline, running from the floor to the kitchen (i.e. the smell

Jennifer mentioned earlier and what she slipped on seconds ago). A HUGE flame

trail lunges towards the two women. They scream.

CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey take off out the patio doors when suddenly KA-BOOM!

THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT! THE ROOF SPLINTERS.

A HUGE CONFLAGRATION! The three dive into the swimming pool as debris rains

down onto the Earth.

THE GHOST --

WATCHES FROM THE SHADOWS, FLAMES BOUNCING OFF HIS PALLID WHITE MASK.

SIRENS ARE HEARD IN THE NEAR DISTANCE.

AS THE GHOST RUNS OFF INTO THE NIGHT, HE DROPS ANOTHER NEWSPAPER CLIPPING ON

THE GROUND. IT BLOWS IN THE WIND.

THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPING - ECU

IT'S FLIPPED OVER BY A PAIR OF HANDS.  SCRAWLED ON BACK IS:"I KILLED HER"

INT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY

DETECTIVE KINCAID paces around his room. A battered and bruised Dewey and Gale

sit beside his desk in Police Uniforms (since their old clothes has obviously

been drenched).

Kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey.

conference

Kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this. He smirks ever

so nefariously at Dewey.

Kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag. Within is a blurry 5x4 of

MAUREEN PRESCOTT exiting a motel room with COTTON WEARY. Kincaid turns it

over. Also, written on it's back is 'I KILLED HER'

Dewey is on his cell phone.

The two run into each other's arms, embrace tightly.

Dewey walks Sid into Kincaid's office.

INT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY

For a change, instead of an exchange of fists, the two share a warm hug.

Sidney notices the clippings and the photograph of Maureen.

CUT TO:

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY

Kincaid and Dewey's cars drive through the lot. They drive over towards a row

of trailers, park.

KINCAID disappears to do something else while GALE, DEWEY, and Sidney get out

of Dewey's truck.

A figure lunges out of nowhere, startling all three of them. It's a young,

scrawny goth girl in  heavy make-up.

This is KAREN COLCHECK, 22. She holds something in her hand, a video tape

marked SCARY MOVIES 101.

Sidney hugs Karen. So does Dewey.

Karen holds up the video.

Sidney and Karen are hugging.

Karen smiles. She hugs Sidney one more time, scampers away.

Gale runs off.

CUT TO:

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIO FILM ARCHIVES - DAY

Gale's banging on the door trying to gain access. Nobody home. Gale notices

the card lock and the sign reading  'AUTHORIZED PERSONAL ONLY'. Gale smiles.

Since when has this ever stopped her before. She reaches into her pocket book,

pulling out a couple of credit cards, a video store card, etc. She tries them

in the lock. NOTHING.

A hand reaches down, grabs Gale from behind. She lets outa blood curdling

scream. It's only JENNIFER.

Jennifer opens the door, steps in first. Gale follows, door closing ominously

behind them with a loud CLACK.

CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY - ARCHIVES - DAY

Gale leads the way down the dark hall.

The two turn the corner, stepping into -

INT.  CLERICAL AREA - ARCHIVES - DAY

BIANCA BERNADETTE, an aging, former actress in her late forties, early

fifties, sits behind a desk doing paperwork.

Sensing someone else's presence she stops what she is doing and looks up at

Gale and Jennifer.

Bianca shakes her head "no".

Gale reaches into her pocket, slams down the picture of Sid's mom on Bianca's

desk. Bianca looks up, totally unenthused.

Gale slaps a twenty dollar bill on the desk. Bianca looks up, a bit insulted,

slides the money back.

Jennifer turns to Bianca, slides off her ring. She slams the ring onto the

desk. It's absolutely stunning.

How can Bianca resist. She smiles, takes the ring, slips it on her finger.

Gale reaches for her Twenty. Bianca slaps her hand, takes it, folding it up,

sliding it between her cleavage.

INT. FILE ROOM - ARCHIVES - DAY

Gale takes the folder from Bianca, opens it up. Inside are 8x10 headshots of

MAUREEN PRESCOTT when she was younger. Behind the pictures is a Xeroxed

listing of the films she's starred in.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - SUNRISE STUDIOS - DAY

Sidney stands beside Dewey and Detective Wallace.

Dewey and Wallace nod. Sid begins to walk towards the soundstage.

INT.  LADIES ROOM - SOUNDSTAGE BUILDING - DAY

Sidney stands at the sink washing her face. She shuts off the water reaches

for a paper towel when suddenly, something catches her ear. Almost as if a

man's whisperedher name 'Siiiiiddney'. Sid turns around, stares at the empty

bathroom.

Silence. Sid reaches into her pocket book, draws out a Gravity Knife. She

flips open the blade, crouches down on her knees, scanning the row of stalls

for feet.

What a relief . . . none. Sid smiles, dismisses what she thought she heard

when she sees --

THE RUMBLING AIR CONDITIONING UNIT.

Sidney goes back to drying her face when suddenly --

This time it's apparent. There's somebody else in the bathroom. Sid begins to

make her way towards the bathroom door when suddenly --

WHAM! A STALL door flies open. THE GHOST charging out at full-force. Sid hits

the deck, sliding across the floor, deflecting the blow from the knife as the

killer buries it into the sink counter. Sid races for the door, killer hot on

her trail. SUDDENLY --

WHAM! The storage closet door flies open and a second GHOST comes charging

out, knife gleaming. He dives for Sid. Sid takes up her knife, buries it in

her attacker's shoulder. The GHOST goes reeling back into the closet. Sidney

slams the door closed on him. She dives for the door knob when suddenly, the

first ghost comes running back at her. She ducks as he swings his knife,

burying it into the bathroom door. Sid bolts across the bathroom towards a

tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling. Using the trash as a booster,

she leaps up, slides open the window, and dives out, just as the deadly pair

of attackers come back for more.

CUT TO:

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY

Sidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building. She looks

up, realizing she's just ran herself into a dead end.

BAM! An exit door flies open. The GHOST comes charging out. Sidney screams,

runs for a wooden fence. She begins to scale it, dropping over on the other

side just as the killer pierces through it with his knife. Sid takes off

running for WALLACE and DEWEY.

WALLACE AND DEWEY,

HEARING THE SCREAMS, spin around, drawing out their guns.  Wallace looks at

Dewey.

Wallace whips out his cellular, dials a number. Sidney falls into Dewey's

arms, collapsing like a house of cards, crying hysterically.

Dewey and Sidney turn around to see an excited Jennifer   and Gale race into

frame.

INT.  JOHN MILTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Milton's on the phone with Roman.

Milton hangs up as Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey barge intohis office.

CUT TO:

INT.   DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY

Kincaid stands at his desk trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together.

Sidney's seated beside him, staring at a stack of books on 'SCRIPT WRITING and

SELLING YOUR WORK IN HOLLYWOOD'.

Kincaid readies himself to leave. He snags up his holstered gun, his car keys,

jacket, etc.

Detective Kincaid pauses, he leans over Sidney's chair, his penetrating eyes

glaring right into hers.

Kincaid exits, door slamming shut behind him. A beat, then --

CUT TO:

Milton steps out of his office into his reception area.  Secretary's gone for

the night. Milton starts out of the office, disappears.

CLOSE ON A COAT CLOSET.

The door creaks open. Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey emerge from the darkness.

Jennifer is gagging.

Jennifer's quiet.

Dewey leans into Milton's office door, slowly opens it. Darkness spills out.

The three disappear inside it.

CUT TO:

INT.  HALLWAY - BUILDING - NIGHT

Milton's walking down the hallway. It's dark. Desolate. CAMERA tracks along

the paisley velvet carpet as a phone rings O.S.

IT'S MILTON'S CELL. He answers it, pushes the elevator 'up' button anxiously.

Milton's going rapid fire.

THE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS with a ping. A flash of silver and in an instant,

John's throat is slashed open, spilling blood. His corpse thuds to the ground.

A pair of gloved hands drag him into the elevator. A moments pause and then--

THE GHOST storms out, disappearing down the hall.

THE ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE ON MILTON'S CORPSE.

INT.  MILTON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Gale's trying to get a locked drawer on Milton's desk open. It won't budge.

Dewey steps into frame, flashlight in hand. He shines the light down on the

lock.

Dewey leans in, bumping his head with Gale's.

The two look at each other and smile. Dewey laughs sweetly. Gale reaches up,

rubs his head.

JENNIFER, chimes in. Clearly annoyed.

Gale and Dewey can't help gazing into each other's eyes. In an instant it

almost seems as if a long lost love has been sparked back to life.

Dewey takes the butt of the flashlight, brings it down  hard on the locked

drawer. The lock's smashed off.

Gale slides open the drawer, reaches in. She pulls up a manilla folder. Dewey

shines the light on the folder as Gale opens it up and reads what's inside.

Gale's eyes widen.

Dewey and Gale look up and scream as --

THE GHOST rushes out of the shadows. Jennifer bolts for the door. The GHOST

jams his knife in her back. She lets out a blood curdling death scream, drops

to the floor motionless. GALE and DEWEY share a terrified scream. The killer

wipes his blade clean, lunges for them.

Dewey jumps in the killer's path. The killer winds back, cracks the base of

the knife across Dewey's skull. Dewey drops to the floor unmoving.

CLANG! The Killer's blade glistens in the moonlight. He charges for Gale. Gale

screams, races out of the office door, slamming it closed on the killer

sending him flying onto his back.

INT.  HALLWAY - OFFICES - NIGHT

Gale races down the hallway, frantically trying every door she passes. All of

them locked. She reaches the elevator, hits the "down" button.  The door opens

with a ping. Gale unleashes a horrendous scream --

MILTON --

--has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to

gullet. His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet.

GALE staggers away from the elevator, speechless. She screams again.

HER GHOSTLY ATTACKER is coming straight for her.

GALE fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator. He runs ahead, briefly,

giving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face. Gale

races out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked

"stairs". She bolts through the door.

INT.  STAIRWELL - OFFICES - NIGHT

Gale races down the stairs, nearly tripping and falling. She races out onto

the ground floor.

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIO LOT - NIGHT

Gale races out of the office building. A car horn blares. She screams.

KINCAID jams on his breaks, gets out his car. He draws up his gun.

Kincaid spins around. Gale screams. The GHOST comes charging out of nowhere,

slashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest. Kincaid drops onto the

hood of his car, dead.

GALE pauses. She's screaming hysterically. The killer raises the knife

menacingly.

Gale closes her eyes, cries as the killer stalks towards her.

INT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sidney sits in Kincaid's office flipping through the folder marked 'SIDNEY

PRESCOTT' It's loaded with newspaper articles and police reports and is

basically a scrapbook of obsession. Sidney smirks. Kincaid has drawn little

magic marker hearts around a picture of her. She's awakened from her daydream.

The phone rings. Sid answers it.

Sid's face floods with fear. She rushes towards the office door when suddenly,

the voice draws her back, angrily and cautioning.

Sidney stands up, goes into an inner office, Wallace's.

We hear the killer haul back and hit Dewey hard.

Click. The killer hangs up. Sidney breaks down crying.

Wallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when

something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls

up a fully loaded handgun.

That's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit.

INT.  WALLACE'S CAR - NIGHT

Sid speeds through rain-slicked streets. Her cellular rings.

Click. The killer hangs up.

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS LOT - NIGHT

Sid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates. She gets out, stands on

the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence.

EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - NIGHT

Sidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot. Again, her cellular rings.

Again, she answers it.

Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is

startled out of fright.  Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production

poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's

in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the

holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness.

INT.  STAB 3 SETS - NIGHT

Sidney enters. She pauses. As a million things rush through her mind. To her

this is like the ultimate return. Everything appears as she last remembers.

Sid steps through the dark sets. Her phone rings. She answers it.

The killer hangs up. Sid pockets the phone. She walks past the MACHER GARAGE

set. Instead of a foam TATUM body dangling from the doggy door, it's KINCAID'S

CORPSE! Sidney flinches, covers her eyes. She walks on.

INT.  BECKER HOUSE - SET - NIGHT

Sid steps through the living room of the BECKER set. It mirrors the house

perfectly. Everything from the shattered patio door to the burnt Jiffy Pop is

there. Sid's phone rings. She answers it.

Sid bolts through the shattered patio door out onto the backyard set. Seated

before a heated in ground pool, tied to a patio chair, beaten and gagged, is

DEWEY RIELLY. He's unconscious and almost appears at first glance like STEVEN

ORTH from SCREAM. Sid's jaw drops. This can't be possible. She looks down at

the phone.

Sid screams, dropping the phone out of fright. She turns around coming face to

face with --

THE GHOST

HE STANDS in the patio doorway. A monstrous version of the voice-changing box

in hand. He raises up the box, clicks a button and speaks.

darkened set, running straight up the front porch of a mock-up of her own

childhood home. She swings open the front door, slams it closed.

INT.  PRESCOTT HOUSE - SET - NIGHT

Sid locks and bolts the front door. She backs away from it as the killer

begins to pounce against it, struggling to get inside. Sid hears something

upstairs. Like muffled cries. She races up to investigate.

CUT TO:

INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - SET - NIGHT

Sid enters the set of her bedroom, slowly drawing out the gun she stole from

Kincaid's office.

LYING on the bed, bound and gagged, is --

GALE WEATHERS

Sid races over, removes the gag from Gale's mouth.

Sid fumbles with the bindings, manages to untie Gale. Gale sits up.

KER-SMASH! The GHOST launches himself through the upstairs window. Gale and

Sidney bolt for the bedroom door, killer hot on their tails.

DEWEY --

Dewey comes around. He lets his head loll for a moment before finally

beginning to pull and tug on his bindings.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on Dewey freeing one of his hands from the heavy duct tape.

INT.  MAUREEN'S BEDROOM - PRESCOTT HOUSE SET - NIGHT

Gale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and

locking it. Sid looks around, her head already swimming from the chaos

outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the

furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a

black rubber body bag (supposedly Maureen's body). The door buckles under the

killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer.

A knife splinters through the door, inches from Gale's face. She screams.

Sid backs away, hysterical. She raises up the gun, fires into the door.  BLAM!

BLAM! BLAM! Gale ducks out of the way. Silence.

The door ceases to move. AND THEN --

THE BODY BAG UNZIPS and the second GHOST emerges, knife in hand. The girls

utter horrified screams. Sid raises up the gun, goes to fire when suddenly --

BAM!

The bedroom door's kicked down and the other killer enters, grabbing Sid by

her shoulders, batting the gun from her hands.

Sid screams, punches her attacker in the chest. He winces.

The second Ghost grabs Gale, holds the knife to her throat, stopping her in

her tracks. Sid makes a beeline for the window, leaps through the glass.

THE WINDOW SHATTERS.

Sid comes flying out onto the patio awning. She rolls over onto the astro-turf

grass, momentarily motionless. And then she comes to. Her eyes flickering

open, blurrily staring up at --

THE GHOST, leering out the shattered window frame.

SID stands up, takes off running towards --

THE MACHER HOUSE SET.

INT.  FOYER - MACHER HOUSE SET - NIGHT

Sid races into the foyer, slams the door closed behind her. Again, locking and

bolting it. She looks around, everything is once again the same as it was in

Woodsboro. This is where the climax of the original battle between good and

evil wasfought. It's dejr vu all over again.  Footsteps O.S.

Sidney turns around --

DEWEY staggers through the living room doorway, gun in hand.

Sidney embraces Dewey.

Dewey unlocks the front door, swings it open.

STANDING across the set is THE GHOST, knife raised.

Dewey goes to fire. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. Out of bullets.

THE GHOST winds back, launches the knife. It swirls through space before

embedding into Dewey's arm, launching him back through the doorway. Sidney

screams. Dewey's unconscious again. The GHOST races for the open door. Sid

screams, kicks it closed. Locking and bolting it again. A crash O.S. Sid turns

around --

A BODY rolls down the staircase, covered in blood. It comes to a halt at

Sidney's feet, an unmoving, rumpled figure.

IT'S ANGELINA TYLER.

She's been brutally stabbed.

BUT ANGELINA'S EYES OPEN. A SICK RICTUS SMILE FORMING on her lips.She pulls

out a gun, aims it at Sidney's face.

CUT TO:

INT.  MACHER LIVING ROOM - SET - NIGHT

Angelina walks Sidney into the living room at gunpoint. Gale's been handcuffed

and tossed onto the couch.

ON THE TV --

HOME VIDEO FOOTAGE of MAUREEN PRESCOTT plays.

Sid tries to run, Angelina trains the gun on her. Causing her to stop in her

tracks.

The GHOST enters frame, ripping open his costume to reveal a KEVLAR bullet

proof vest.

THE GHOST rips off his mask. IT'S ROMAN. Sidney's deathly quiet.

Sid squirms.

Roman stabs himself in the arm. He screams, goes stagger back into Angelina's

arms.

Roman continues stabbing himself. In the shoulder. In the side.In the leg.

Bleeding and hazed, he hands the gore drenched knife to Angelina.

Roman lunges at Sidney. Sid screams, takes off through the kitchen. Gale rolls

herself off the couch. Angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs.

Gale pops off the handcuffs.

Gale barrels into Angelina, tackling her into the coffee table before she has

a chance to move. Angelina struggles to raise her knife.

MEANWHILE --

ROMAN,

--chases Sid into the foyer. She races past the spot where Dewey fell earlier.

He's gone! Roman jumps at her. Sid disappears into another room.  THE CHASE

continues.

GALE AND ANGELINA,

Continue the fight. Gale's slamming Angelina's head against the hardwood

floor. Angelina swipes, slashing Gale along the side, deeply. Gale screams,

begins to crawl away. She kicks Angelina in the face. Angelina drops the

knife. Gale stands up, begins to back away.

SIDNEY--

Comes rounding into the foyer again. Roman's right behind her.

SUDDENLY,

WHAM! The laundry room door swings open and the GHOST emerges, KNIFE in hand.

He buries the knife deep into Roman's chest, sending him flying backwards.

Sidney screams. The ghost stops in his tracks, pulling off his mask --

IT'S ONLY DEWEY. He can barely stand up. He's bleeding profusely from his

wounds.

Dewey and Sid embrace.

SCREAMING O.S.

Sidney and Dewey race into --

LIVING ROOM --

Gale's got Angelina in a headlock, right beneath the TV UNIT.

Gale releases, leaps up, she pushes the TV set down onto Angelina's head.

Angelina screams, her body trembling from the electric shocks and high

voltage.

SID and DEWEY stand in the doorway, breathless. Gale approaches them. She and

Dewey embrace tightly.

ANGELINA's twitching corpse goes limp.

SIDNEY, spots a gun on the mantle. She grabs it, cocks it.

--FOYER --

THE THREE SURVIVORS STEP INTO THE FOYER.  Sid looks down at Roman's corpse.

THEN A HORRIFYING SCREAM rips through the air.

ANGELINA comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried

mess. Everyone screams, one epic last scream. Sid raises up the gun, fires,

hitting Angelina dead center between the eyes, sending a splash of blood and

brain matter onto the wall behind her.

Sid turns to Roman's lifeless body.

POV LOOKING UP ON SID TURNING THE GUN DOWN ON US --

SID scrunches up her face in anger, pulls the trigger. BLAM! A CLEAN PERFECT

SHOT TO ROMAN'S HEAD.

Sid drops the gun, walks off set.

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - THE NEXT MORNING

The police, fire, and ems are all on the scene of the crime.

Dewey's wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE

Gale's right beside him on a stretcher. She leans over, takes his hand.

Dewey smiles. The two kiss feverishly.

WALLACE exiting his car. He surveys the damage. Sid passes him.

Wallace nods his thanks as Sidney walks off through the studio gates, the sun

rising overhead, as calm and as casually as if nothing's happened. SLOWLY, we

crane up to an aerial looking down upon HOLLYWOOD. ANOTHER DAY IS BEGINNING.

AND THIS IS THE PERFECT END FOR A TRILOGY.

CUT TO BLACK

THE END
