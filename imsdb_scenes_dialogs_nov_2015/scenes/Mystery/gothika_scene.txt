The Woodward Forensic Institute (WFI) is a 175-bed Intermediate

Security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric

patients. Its primary clientele are those who have histories

of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the

Department of Mental Health by the Circuit Courts of the State

or who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian.

OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS:

INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN

PUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM

CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second

before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a

glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it.

Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs

(wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30,

sharp and prettier than she knows.

INT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING

Miranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on,

goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the

water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something

slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A

person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the

perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like

graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She

emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself

in a towel.

INT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING

Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Miranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial

analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast.

Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case

file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the

newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM.

EXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING

Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps.

Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers.

Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives

off.

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR

Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets

her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the

wall:

CONTINUED:

"WOODWARD FORENSIC INSTITUTE"

The gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as

we...

INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDA'S OFFICE - EVENING

Stark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the

according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces

a troubled young mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic,

deranged and forever trying to provoke. Mid-session:

Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough.

Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist.

CONTINUED:

Before Miranda can analyze that one, the room LIGHTS FLICKER

AND DIE. Darkness. Miranda's breathing speeds up.

As suddenly as it went out, now the POWER RETURNS.      A

visibly uncomfortable Miranda checks the clock.

CONTINUED:

She almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this.

Almost. TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door. Miranda nods

for them to escort Chloe. Chloe shakes their hands away

from her, strides off dramatically. The princess of the

asylum.

INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

Miranda locks her office, armed with paperwork. The end

of another workweek. DR. PETE GRAHAM, a good ten years

older and Miranda's best friend on the job, approaches.

They walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues

who not only respect each other, but enjoy each other.      A

lot.

CONTINUED:

They have reached an office marked "DR. PHILLIP PARSONS

DIRECTOR" and peer in to see Parsons (50's,

distinguished, commands respect from everyone) on the

phone. He gestures for Pete to sit. Miranda is about to

exit when he covers the mouthpiece --

Parsons looks through his appointment book.

CONTINUED:

He nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone

call.

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT

Miranda drives off, leaving the majestic grounds behind.

A GUARD waves her off.

END OPENING CREDITS.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up

ahead. A knocked-down telephone post blocks the road.

EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene. A patrolman waves her

down.

INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

SHERIFF RYAN, 40'S, recognizes her and ambles over.

CONTINUED:

He taps on her hood and heads back to the site.      She

shifts into reverse and makes a U-turn.

EXT. OLD MAIN ROAD - NIGHT

Miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge.

Something definitely creepy about this deserted place --

INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING

Miranda dials a number on her cell phone, gets the

machine.

A bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the

passenger seat. She reaches for it and when she looks up

we see:

POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

A TEENAGE GIRL stands smack in front of us.      Naked.

About to get pummelled by us.

BACK TO SCENE

Miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing.

METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain control of the

car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT --

She looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing

back there. Drunk or high or in any case completely out

of it.

CONTINUED:

She stares at the dead phone.      Punches the buttons on it.

No go.

She tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car.

EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

Miranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not

moving. Just standing there. Her back to us.

Nothing.     As we get closer we see she is covered in

bruises.     Clearly something horrible has happened to her.

And now she turns. Young, seventeen tops. Busted lip,

black eye. Miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around

the girl --

The girl suddenly grips Miranda's arm.         Hard.

Now the girl is touching Miranda's face. Her movements

desperate, smothering. Like the movements of a drowning

person. Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.

The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead

she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell.

And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much

stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --

CONTINUED:

The girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. And as

Miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the

girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body.

INT. BEDROOM - DAWN

Miranda wakes up in a cold sweat.         Just a bad dream.    A

beat.

FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER, we hear a REPETITIVE

SOUND outside. Like an ECHO of some sort, but vaguely

familiar: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP.

Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of

water on her bedside table. Except... it's not there.

She turns to her husband but he's not in the bed. And

now she glances around the room and realizes this is not

her bedroom.

She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark. Trips over

something. A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY. Her heartbeat

goes haywire. She feels her way along the wall to a

small opening in the door. A glass pane.

She peers through the glass at the empty corridor

outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's

inside a cell.

She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic --

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

CAMERA SOARS through the tall iron gates, past the guard.

Now we spot the source of our continuing THWIP THWIP

sound: sprinklers watering the impressively-kept gardens.

The expansive complex is more Victorian campus than drab

prison, with separate wings (male and female), research

units, libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center.

INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS

A bored group of female patients listen to a social

worker lecturing them. A janitor mops a long corridor.

Patients study at the library under the watchful eye of

orderlies.

A doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an

epileptic fit (we'll soon know her as SHELLEY). They

force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing

her tongue, prepare a syringe.

Institute director Phil Parsons at a meeting with other

doctors, discussing a patient's progress on a chart.

Now we are MOVING up the main building's wall and THROUGH

large windows into --

INT. FEMALE WING STAIRS

Pete rushes up two steps at a time, passing by a NURSE

WITH A CART OF MEDS, who nods respectfully as he goes --

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S CELL

An ORDERLY unlocks the door for Pete. Through the glass

pane he can see a visibly upset Miranda arguing with the

head nurse: a tough as nails woman in her 50's: IRENE.

Peter forces a smile, enters --

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL

Pete nods at Irene: it's okay, he'll take it from here.

Peter is half-listening to her, half-signaling to the

nurse with the meds to come in. Miranda catches all of

this, growing more agitated. She wears the uniform all

patients wear: a white T-shirt and sweats. Her wedding

ring is gone.

CONTINUED:

Pete grabs the meds from the nurse. Irene and the

attendant step closer to help. Miranda feels them

closing in on her. Peter's tone is infuriatingly gentle:

She looks at the silent faces around her. No sympathy.

Or maybe too much sympathy. Either way it's unnerving.

The nurse complies. Miranda stares at the meds, trying

desperately to put this into some kind of perspective.

Awkward nods from Irene, the nurse and the attendant.

Pete holds Miranda's gaze. Miranda takes her meds.

CONTINUED:

Pete motions for the others to leave them alone.         One by

one they file out and lock the door behind them.

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - LATER

Miranda paces.       Alone with Pete, she is even more upset.

He hesitates, unsure where to begin.

CONTINUED:

This stops her. Wanting desperately to whip out a

comeback but realizing she doesn't know the answer.

The hint of sadness in his voice alarms her.

Miranda shakes her head in disbelief, but we --

FLASHBACK - INT. NEUROSURGICAL UNIT

Miranda seizing violently FROM HER POV: Doctors

struggling to contain her. Arms thrashing, legs.

FLASHES of the wall, the floor. Head crashing against a

cart, out of control.

CONTINUED:

FLASH: Miranda being tied down.      A nurse with a

syringe --

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)

She looks down at her wrists with the reddish marks.

Miranda, speechless.     Reality sinking in.

Pete shakes his head emphatically.

CONTINUED:

A pause here. He's waiting for her to continue. She's

not used to being on the other side of the therapist's

table.

She stops here. Pete waits. The silence is deafening.

She pushes on, but her hands shake a little.

CONTINUED:

Pete nods.     Miranda is all foggy on the details:

FLASHBACK - ANTIQUE WIND CHIMES

sway in the night breeze with their gentle tinkling

SOUND, more menacing than joyful --

INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick

streak of blood on it.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - MIRANDA'S EYE

Jittery, alert. We scour her every blood vessel, iris,

pupil. FILLING the SCREEN and now we distinctly make out

an eerie shape reflected inside of it. But just for a

sec --

The teenage girl.

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)

Miranda shakes the puzzling images out of her head:

She shakes her head emphatically as we:

FLASHBACK - INT. LOFT - NIGHT

CAMERA PANS ACROSS the large space to find Miranda and a

MAN (whose face we don't see) kissing heatedly.

CONTINUED:

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)

Miranda chases the disconcerting image out of her head.

His face says he doesn't know how to tell her.

Frustrated, she snatches his cell phone and starts to

dial:

This stops her cold. Time stands eerily still. She

stares at Pete as if by looking at him long enough, he

will contradict his statement.

INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Irene and TWO NURSE rush to Miranda's cell.      WE HEAR her

hysterical CRIES from inside --

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT

Pete struggles to contain Miranda, who howls

disparagingly.

Off Pete's nod, a nurse injects the syringe into

Miranda's arm. They hold her down with great effort as

she continues to cry, and we...

FADE IN:

FLASHBACK SEQUENCE - SERIES OF SHOTS

A blur of images and scrambled snippets of memories come

at us rapid-fire, like a drug-induced dream:

EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

Miranda's CAR SCREECHES to a stop and she jumps out,

glances around.

INT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Graduation night. School principal Douglas Grey shakes

hands with proud parents and clumsily formal students.

Miranda grabs a drink from a nearby tray, bored.

He smiles weakly at the compliment. Moves his hand

towards her, in an affectionate gesture (or so Miranda

thinks) but instead fixes her bra strap. Ever

methodical.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

Miranda and a man exit the theater.    Giggling.

INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

Doug laying on the floor covered with bloodstains.

Bloodstained axe on floor in f.g. Walls covered with

bloodstains.

INT. LOFT - NIGHT

A flustered Miranda fumbles with her purse and keys,

heads for the door. She tries to fix her smeared

lipstick and messed-up hair. TURNS TO CAMERA:

First we hear our mystery man's voice, then we see him:

Pete. (Yes, the same person she kissed and went to the

movies with.) He places his hand on the door, blocking

her.

He smiles. Touches her face tenderly. Torn. A person

used to doing the right thing but not liking that at the

moment.

CONTINUED:

He nods.     Opens the door for her.     She starts to walk

away.

EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - MORNING

PUSH INTO a quiet house on a quiet suburban street. Two

Volvos parked in the driveway. Perfectly-kept front lawn.

FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

Another near-subliminal glimpse of Doug laying on the

floor covered with bloodstains. Bloodstained axe on

floor in f.g. Walls covered with bloodstains.

EXT. CHAPEL - DAY

Miranda and Doug laugh at their wedding. It's clearly

hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a

handkerchief.

INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick

streak of blood on it. She looks down at her hand,

noticing the blood -- and now we are back in --

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Miranda wakes up with a start. The darkness renders the

room almost void of any color. Monochromatic. It takes

her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander across

the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched.

We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like

somebody is standing over her bed. But we don't see

anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks

through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She

glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and

bangs on the door.

CONTINUED:

She waits.     Bangs on the door again.

A beat. And now finally we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING.

A light is switched on down the corridor.

The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER... and CLOSER...

Miranda tries to appear composed. Wipes sweat off her

forehead. Fixes her hair. The FOOTSTEPS now STOP right

out side the door. A KEY goes into the lock and JIGGLES

it.

Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens.

Confused, she steps up to the glass partition and

peeks --

The second her face touches the glass, she is met by a

pair of piercing eyes. The eerie teenage girl. Miranda

jumps back, screams.

And when she looks up again, the image is gone.      A beat.

Rational thought kicking in --

She props herself with her back against the wall. With a

view of the whole cell. Just in case. Staring at the

door.

And now, FAINTLY at first, but GROWING LOUDER --

FOOTSTEPS can be heard APPROACHING outside. Just like

before.

CONTINUED:

Like her life depends on that mantra. The FOOTSTEPS get

CLOSER. And her voice begins to falter --

And now the FOOTSTEPS pause outside her door like before

and she holds her breath, horrified, when suddenly we are

hit with the sudden glare of returning light.

EVERYTHING FLASHES WHITE and then COLOR RETURNS --

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY

Irene tries to shake Miranda awake.       An orderly and nurse

stand by.

No reaction.

She shakes her harder. And now Miranda's EYES SHOOT OPEN

and she grips Irene's arm. Hard. Like the teenage girl

did.

Miranda stares at her, coming back to. Starts to speak

but has no voice. Clears her throat --

CONTINUED:

Irene reaches out her hand and the nurse places a cup

with meds on it.

Irene shoves the meds into Miranda's mouth --

She struggles as they hold her down and Irene sedates

her.

INT. REC ROOM - DAY

DRIFTING PAST the female patients at their usual activities.

Some watch TV, play dominoes, some pretend to read, some

stare out blankly. Here's Chloe at a table, engaged in

some sort of trivia game with a tattooed Southern redhead

named JENNA:

CONTINUED:

Chloe shrugs, if you say so.       Jenna resumes:

Chloe checks a reference book.       Nods, impressed.

CAMERA FOLLOWS HER INTENT GAZE to another patient,

SHELLEY (the same patient we saw earlier mid-fit)

moseying across the room. Nervously takes a seat beside

Miranda.

It takes a moment for the heavily-drugged Miranda to

react. She looks up slowly: eyes glazed, painfully out

of it.

CONTINUED:

Miranda notices Shelley is toying with a wrinkled

NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. Shelley catches this look and slides

it over to her. Without malice, like a child.

It reads "SCHOOL PRINCIPAL SLAUGHTERED. WIFE UNDER

ARREST." Photos of Miranda, Douglas, their house.

Miranda stares at it in disbelief.      Growing sick.

Miranda slides the clipping back to Shelley, clueless as

to how to get out of this conversation, but Shelley has

no problem holding a conversation all by herself --

CONTINUED:

She hands Miranda paper and some crayons, whispers:

With a wink, she's gone. Miranda looks at the room

around her: Chloe spying on her in the corner, Irene and

the nurse sharing a laugh, other patients ambling about,

arguing --

Life among the insane.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA - DAY

Patients undress in the bare-bones locker area. An

uneasy Miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by

Irene.

Miranda studies the patients already under the spray of

the shower. Something vaguely concentration camp-like

about institutional bathing.

CONTINUED:

The shower, like everything else in this place, is

regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of

patients each get their turn. Miranda feels Chloe's gaze

on her across the room. She is stripping off her clothes

for Miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last

refrain from the Stones' "START ME UP."

The first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past

Miranda, in all shapes and sizes. She registers their

many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls:

names of men, places, religious quotes. Burn scars,

cuts, needle marks. They begin to towel off as Miranda,

slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in

the corner.

A moment later Irene nods for her to go in.

INT. COMMUNAL SHOWERS - LATER

Miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her

eyes, trying to shut it all out.

The SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda

and her RAGGED BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last

two out from the previous group, grab towels.

Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but

Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her

at the tile wall.

More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted

water pipe pokes out. Clearly at some point there was a

handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted

pipe.

PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of

blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems

to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system.

The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the

laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the

tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and now more

blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall.

Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is

the only one left in the showers. Panic. Shuts her

eyes.

CONTINUED:

Opens her eyes.

Five letters are written in blood.       N-O-T-A-L.

Shaking, nauseous, she looks down at her feet and the

drain, too scared to look back up.

Perhaps. But now blood drips by       her ankle, DRIP, DRIP,

DRIP. And the shooting pain she       feels is coming from her

arm. What the hell -- ? WE SEE        SHARP SLASHES appearing

on her skin, like some invisible      knife is slicing her.

Hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers --

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA

Miranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm, too freaked

out to process anything. Fumbles for her clothes and heads

straight to Shelley, tying her shoelaces, muttering.

Shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look.

Shelley doesn't respond. Simply crosses over and heads

for the showers. Miranda gets dressed when a hand on her

shoulder makes her jump --

CONTINUED:

But now Irene notices the blood seeping through the

towel.

And now the other patients are curiously watching as

orderlies RUSH IN to haul her away.

INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

THROUGH a glass pane we see a NURSE bandaging Miranda's

arm. Parsons and Irene confer just outside the room.

Parsons watches Miranda through the glass.       She can't

look him in the eye.

INT. REC ROOM - LATER

Miranda (with her fresh new bandage) ignores the looks

from the other patients as she rejoins them. Spots

Shelley by the window furthest from the wardens. Scared.

CONTINUED:

Miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation, but

has a sinking feeling.

Shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear.

Miranda shakes her head, feeling foolish.     Walks away.

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY

Pete and Miranda stare at each other.     A tense beat.

CONTINUED:

CONTINUED:

She stares at him.     Queasy.

She tries to read his face. Reminds herself of who Pete

is and what he means to her. He points at her bandaged

arm.

She takes a resigned breath, slowly shakes her head.

Wishing she could wake up from this nightmare:

FADE IN:

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE GARDEN - DAY

SPRINKLER SYSTEMS doing their thing: THWIP, THWIP,

THWIP... The female patients are out in the gardens for

their freshly dose of air. BOOM DOWN TO Miranda alone at

a bench. A cigarette appears before her, being offered

to her:

Miranda sees Jenna looming above her, shielding the sun.

CONTINUED:

Jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly.

Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna

rambles on.

Miranda follows Jenna's gaze. Sure enough, she's being

closely watched by two orderlies.

Miranda shrugs. God knows what Jenna is talking about

but who is she to say? Once again, Miranda checks the

building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge. She

rises --

He keeps walking.     Headed to the parking lot beyond.

CONTINUED:

He turns. His first instinct is to smile. But he checks

himself, reminding himself of her new status. Slips into

his best professional face:

Impressive.    She remembers his schedule perfectly.

She follows his look to the parking lot where Sheriff

Ryan emerges from his patrol car. Miranda nods.

His tone is fatherly yet direct.

This surprises her.

CONTINUED:

Stonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling

like an idiot. Watches Parsons join the Sheriff by his

car. The two men shake hands when suddenly Irene runs

past her, yelling --

Now two ORDERLIES race past. Miranda looks over to see

what the fuss is all about. Chloe is on top of an

institute staff member we haven't seen before, a round

black woman named CONSUELO. Punching her --

Other patients have crowded around the scuffle.

Irene and the orderlies yank Chloe off Consuelo. Chloe kicks

and screams like an animal. Consuelo meekly stands up.

CONTINUED:

The orderlies start pulling Chloe away.      Chloe spits at

Consuelo, full of venom.

The orderlies haul Chloe off. Irene disperses the crowd.

Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her

manner says she just wants to get back to her duties.

Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they

were doing.

Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something

catches her eye: Pete watching her from his office

window. He quickly slides the curtain shut. Odd.

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY TO NIGHT (TIME LAPSE

PHOTOGRAPHY SHOTS)

A sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a SWOOSH --

INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR

SLOW PUSH DOWN empty corridors.      The air thick with dread --

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT

Miranda cries softly, unable to sleep. VOICES trickle in

from the corridor outside, wardens on their rounds, a

SOFT MOAN from another cell, a random SCREAM. She shuts

her eyes, repositions herself on her stomach.

CONTINUED:

As before, somebody seems to be watching her.

FADE IN:

INT. WOODWARD LIBRARY - DAY

Irene escorts Miranda into the library.       A warden

follows.

The library is pretty    much empty at this hour except for

the LIBRARIAN and the    odd janitor tidying up. An

efficient-looking man    rises from a desk, briefcase in

place, glass of water    -- this is attorney THEODORE

"TEDDY" HOWARD.

Irene checks her watch.       The warden hangs back, keeping

watch.

Miranda sits.      Waits until Irene is out of hearing range.

CONTINUED:

As he speaks, she starts fidgeting with her itchy

bandage.

Teddy shakes his head.

CONTINUED:

She keeps absently playing with the bandage. The

adhesive is giving. The bandage starting to peel off.

She pulls off half the bandage, back and forth. Not

looking. BUT WE SEE the beginning of a pattern in her

scarred skin --

An uncomfortable Teddy takes too long before answering.

Miranda looks down, humiliated -- and now she sees it.

Perfectly carved into her arm, her scar reads:

"NOT ALONE."

Petrified, Miranda jumps back, knocks down Teddy's glass

of water all over his papers, her chair topples over.

The warden and janitor look up --

Teddy tries for delicate:

CONTINUED:

PUSH INTO her face as involuntary tears roll down and we --

INT. PETE'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda. Numb. Pete trying hard to get through. A

beat. We get a good look at the writing on her arm.

(The right arm.)

Silence from Miranda.     He is firm but not unkind:

Nothing.     He goes to touch her arm.   She jerks it away.

She shakes her head, at a loss. Torn between her

suspicion and the need to confide in someone. Finally:

They stare each other down. There's definitely chemistry

between these two. But the moment is far from romantic.

CONTINUED:

He starts to speak, stops himself. Switches tactics.

Their banter escalates in speed as their terms get more

clinical:

He steps back at her blowout. She catches the look on

his face and forces herself to sit down.

CONTINUED:

He studies her.     Finally nods.   New tactic:

Pete tries to reserve judgment. Her argument has a

certain loopy logic to it. He hesitates, then pulls a

SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS from a manila envelope.

Miranda looks at the crime scene photos. Lurid.

Terrible. Here's part of Doug's body. Here's the axe.

And now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words

on it. In blood, a la Manson family. And it says:

"NOT ALONE."

Miranda immediately tosses it away from her.      Repulsed --

FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Miranda furiously writes on the wall with blood. Wipes

her face breathlessly, leaving a thick red streak on it.

INT. PETE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)

CONTINUED:

Pete retrieves the photograph off the floor and holds it

up for her to study again.

She nods meekly. Staring at the picture. Begins to

shake as all of it finally comes flooding in --

FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick

streak of blood on it. She looks down at Doug, crawling

on hands and knees. He moans horribly, in shock. She

grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. He

reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and

makes a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying

turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles.

Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands.

Doug's hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over

her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA.

Miranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in

the mirror over the mantel and stares --

WE HEAR THAT SOUND. The WETTISH GURGLING sound. Miranda

stares at the MIRROR looking for the source of it. For

an instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there,

beckoning. But now she's gone and Miranda is left

studying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE

around her. She looks down at her feet: No fire. Blood

on her clothes, axe still in her hands. Looks back up

at:

THE MIRROR VERSION OF MIRANDA

shows a serene expression on her face. Fire enveloping

her. She slowly lifts her hands over her head. In place

of the axe there are CHAINS attached to SHACKLES on her

wrists. She is completely naked, as if purified -- like

an extreme version of Anima Sola. (A Biblical icon in

which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate.)

Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment --

When the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and we're back to

reality. Miranda stares at the axe she's flung at it.

INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - LATER

Miranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink. This is

a daunting task, seeing as how she's covered in it. She

stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor, at

the marks on the door handle, towels and wall.

Gasping for breath, almost crying, she turns on the

shower at full blast and climbs into the tub. She

watches the blood wash off her. As if finally coming

back to her body and realizing what she's done, she

slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the

tub. Crying. Shaking.     She shuts her eyes as hard as

she can to make it all go away, and we --

BLACKNESS

Silence. And now, faintly at first, but GROWING

PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER, we hear the SOUND OF BUZZING FLIES.

FADE IN:

INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

Miranda wakes up, still in the tub. How long has she

been there, hours? Days? Impossible to know.

But at some point she must have turned off the water.

She sits up, every muscle of her body aching, hair caked

with blood.

The first thing that hits her is the stench. And it's foul,

the putrid smell of decaying flesh. She steps gingerly out

of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of

blood, mortified at what she will find.

INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Soon enough the press will make the Manson Family

reference, but for now, only Miranda is here to witness

the fruit of her labor. She gasps for air.

Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea. She doubles over

to throw up when there is a FRANTIC RAPPING at the front

door.

She freezes. VOICES and YELLS trickle in. The HINGES on

the door RATTLE under REPEATED POUNDING and she still

stands there as the first FIREMAN breaks in. Sheriff

Ryan and his deputies right behind. A concerned Pete

Graham behind them.

CONTINUED:

The cops take one look at the place and raise their guns

at her, but we can't hear what they're saying because

Miranda's ragged BREATHING has taken over the soundtrack.

Suffice to say that, at the sight of the guns, something

clicks inside her and she turns on her heel and flees --

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She slips on blood, nearly falls as she scrambles to the

bedroom --

INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM

She locks the door behind her, hyperventilating in terror.

Instantly there are men POUNDING on it. SQUAWKING RADIOS.

ORDERS BARKED at her. She spots two officers through the

window in her backyard. About to smash the window.

A caged animal, completely surrounded, she covers her face

with her hands. Trembling. The doorknob jiggles violently,

about to give. And when she brings her hands down she is

staring straight into the teenage girl's face. And she

OPENS HER MOUTH WIDE and now we are back in --

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Miranda gasps for air, drowning in sensory overload.

She rocks back and forth. Finally aware of what she's

done. She is the killer. No more doubts. And now that

she knows, everything is much worse.

A long, harrowing beat.

WE PUSH IN ON her devastated face.       NIGHT TURNS TO DAY.

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY

The locks are unlocked. Pete appears at the door.

Miranda glances up at him. She looks like a different

person. Completely destroyed. He crouches beside her.

She shakes her head slowly. He sets his hand on her

shoulder. She turns to him and hugs him tight, holding

on for dear life. Breaks down in sobs.

INT. PHIL PARSONS' OFFICE - DAY

Parsons leafs through Miranda's file.   Pete stands by the

window, lost in thought.

INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER

Pete escorts a fragile Miranda down the corridor.    The

two orderlies walking ominously behind them.

INT. DR. PHIL PARSONS' OFFICE - DAY

Parsons on the phone, gestures for them to enter.

CONTINUED:

Miranda and Pete sit across from him. Miranda trying

hard to appear composed -- acutely aware of her every

gesture, and of how different her last visit to this

office was. Nothing casual about it now.

She stares at the picture frames on Phil's desk (all

facing AWAY FROM us), the diplomas on the wall, the books

by noted fathers of neurology (works by Hughlings

Jackson, Kurt Goldstein, Henry Head, A.R. Luria). A

framed quote reads:

"'If You Do Know That Here Is One Hand, We'll Grant You

All The Rest.' -- Wittgenstein"

He hangs up. Takes a moment to look at Miranda. Tries a

smile but to her it comes off condescending. Fact is --

there's nothing to smile about.

She nods, dazed. Angles her head to look at a framed

picture on his desk. Parsons looks to Pete.

CONTINUED:

PUSH IN ON Miranda who stares intently at something on

the desk. Not listening to a word he's saying --

Parsons pauses here.      Exchanges glances with Pete.

WE SEE what she is talking about: a framed photograph on

the desk is now FACING us. Eerie. It shows Parsons, his

wife Dorothy and a young girl. Our teenage girl.

Miranda looks up at this, perplexed.

Pete and Parsons trade uneasy looks.

This shuts Miranda right up.      Mind spinning.

CONTINUED:

Ashley Bridge. Mute. Ghost? Miranda hesitates here.

She is not the type to believe in ghosts, and knows full

well what even her suggestion of it will sound like.

Parsons doesn't want to talk about it anymore.    Rises.

The men step outside. PUSH IN ON Miranda's face as she

stares at the picture of Rachel. We catch snippets of

the doctors' discussion outside, increasing her

paranoia --

A DARK SHADOW envelops Miranda's confused face, as we --

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT

Miranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic

light. We are MOVING TOWARDS her, seeing her as if from

the POV of someone approaching her. We become aware of

the RAGGED BREATHING sound. Miranda opens her eyes,

looks this way and that, then closes them again.

She is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard

before. The strained WET SOUND. Miranda's eyes SNAP

OPEN. She slowly sits up, back against the wall.

Squinting to cover every inch of the room.

And now she sees it: a SHADOW crouched in the corner.

Roughly the size of a person. Miranda climbs off the bed

and slowly walks towards it. Scared, but determined.

She wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it.

She gets closer... closer... The RAGGED BREATHING GROWING

LOUDER as she reaches the shadow --

She stretches out her hand and finally touches...

NOTHING. She swipes her hand through the air, feeling

stupid.

She paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head.

The moment is as brave as it is ridiculous. She has

psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost. And

now she climbs back in bed.

CONTINUED:

A beat. And now we hear the SOUND OF THE DEADBOLT SLIDE

OPEN. The door opens quietly. PUSH INTO Miranda's face.

Properly scared now.

If proof is what she wanted, proof is what she got.   From

now on we'll refer to the teenage girl as RACHEL.

INT. FEMALE WARD - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Miranda takes a tentative step outside her cell, feeling

the door with her fingers, feeling along the wall --

still making sure she isn't dreaming this.

She looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of

neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily.

Nobody there. But when she looks down the other way she

sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. So

quick we're not sure we saw it for sure.

Miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction.

At night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling

quality. She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her

head at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells.

She turns to make sure Rachel isn't behind her and when

Miranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing

right across from:

THE NURSES' STATION

Where two nurses are watching TELEVISION. Miranda tiptoes

past them, ducking at the window to remain unseen.

ANOTHER CORRIDOR

This one is wider. Miranda is startled by the sudden

sound of LAUGHTER behind her. The nurses laughing at

their late night show. Momentarily distracted, she

almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall.

She holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a

SANITATION CLOSET.

CONTINUED:

She looks for something, a tool. Discards a pair of

brushes and finds a small screwdriver. Pockets it.

THE STAIRS

Miranda hurries up the stairs, hugging the wall to stay

clear from the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA sweeping the area.

She waits at the landing, times it just right -- and

scurries to the next floor.

INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR (OFFICE FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS

ACTION

Knowing her way around here, Miranda keeps a steady pace

as she heads towards her old office. She turns a corner

and stops in her tracks: another JANITOR making his

rounds. She waits until he's out of sight and rushes to

her office.

She pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the

lock. Starts unscrewing the screws. She does this as

fast as she can, but she's no professional -- so it takes

a few tries. She loosens one screw, then another -- and

clumsily drops the screwdriver. The METAL ECHOES against

the floor.

Miranda sucks her breath in, waits. No footsteps. She

bends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for

balance. It easily turns in her hand. It was open all

along. She simply forgot to check.

INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE

Miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her

computer. Shrouded in darkness. Hits a switch and a

SURVEILLANCE MONITOR comes to life. Now she has a view

of the corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a

smoke, a janitor at the coffee machine and so on.

She switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she

waits for it to boot up.

ON SURVEILLANCE MONITOR

The JANITOR with his coffee cup now heading back towards

Miranda's office corridor --

CONTINUED:

Miranda glances at the door, can see the glare of the

computer screen reflecting against the glass pane. She

tries opening drawers but they're all locked. She

remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath

the couch, uses it to block the light.

Computer powered up, she runs an online search for

"RACHEL PARSONS." Waits as the info appears --

ON COMPUTER SCREEN

Various listings: The archive news of her funeral,

something about her search and a LOCAL NEWS ARTICLE about

teen suicide. That's the one she chooses. Hits "PRINT."

She checks the surveillance monitor again:     the janitor

now mops right outside her door.

ON PRINTOUT

The heading says "WHAT DRIVES OUR TEENAGERS TO SUICIDE?"

A quick glimpse gives us ages (16, 18, 17) and names of

three local girls who have died. Rachel's name and

PHOTOGRAPH appears with two others: Jenny Dixon and

Andrea White.

Miranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance

monitor: the janitor is walking away. She watches him

disappear down the hall. Slowly but surely. And now the

screen is empty.

But just for a second. Because suddenly Rachel is there.

Staring straight at her. Makes us jump.

INT. CORRIDOR/STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Retracing her steps, Miranda shuts her door and hits the

stairs. Playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera.

INT. FEMALE WARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As she reaches the landing, she hears VOICES coming her

way. She detours down another corridor and hides from

view. Waits for Consuelo and a nurse to exit down the

staircase.

CONTINUED:

And now she turns at ANOTHER SOUND. Coming from inside

the room immediately behind her. Room 237. She steps to

the small glass pane on the door and peers inside.

INT. ROOM 237

It takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but

now we make out TWO FIGURES in the room involved in some

sort of struggle.

Miranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a

flash of metal. Something sharp. Not a knife, but a needle.

And now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm. In the dim

light we can make out Chloe, eyes glazed, drooling.

Just for a beat, because now she is slapped down on the

bed like a rag doll and the man with the needle ENTERS

FRAME.

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda flinches, confused. Glances down the corridor to

ensure she remains undiscovered. Then peers back in.

INT. ROOM 237

Chloe on her stomach on the bed. Her pale naked skin

marked with scratches and bruises. The needle is stuck

in her arm, which hangs off the side. Her mouth is open

but it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or

sobbing. Abruptly the man climbs on her, pulling off his

T-shirt.

As he discards it we see that it is yellow.

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Disturbed, Miranda turns away. Except now the corridor

isn't empty. There is a JANITOR at the end. Coffee cup

in hand. Staring at her, disconcerted.

Miranda turns and runs.

INT. FEMALE WARD STAIRS

Miranda bolts down the stairs. THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS and

YELLS can be heard right behind her.

INT. FEMALE WARD THIRD FLOOR

Miranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency

exit door all the way at the end.

TWO ORDERLIES emerge from the staircase and give chase,

shouting for her to stop. PATIENTS holler from their

cells, awakened by the COMMOTION.

Miranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as

she gets closer and closer to the emergency door. Twenty

feet, fifteen, ten --

When a side door opens and a MAN IN A YELLOW SHIRT

appears, blocking her path. Miranda tries to avoid

crashing into him but carries too much momentum. Veers

left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and

pins her down.

The orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find

her screaming, hysterical. They hold her down --

The man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea

what she's talking about. Ho-hum, just another psychotic

woman trying to escape. A nurse prepares a needle and

we --

FADE IN:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

TRACKING ALONG a long desk where the staff finish their

morning meeting. Parsons, Pete and Irene among others.

CONTINUED:

Pete ponders this.     It certainly seems that way.

Irene and Parsons share a look.     He wraps it up:

INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - DAY

A better room, in fact. This one has a view. Heavy bars

on the windows, but still. Miranda paces. Pete is

seated, observing her deteriorating state.

CONTINUED:

What was that?     Miranda reacts to this.

Miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket.

A disconcerted Pete looks at the article with the

pictures of Rachel and the others: Andrea White and

Jenny Dixon.

He regards her. Maybe Parsons is right: she's

desperately grasping at straws now. Skims the article:

CONTINUED:

Miranda snaps to attention here.

CONTINUED:

Discussion over. He raps on the door. Triple-locks come

unlocked and an ORDERLY is there. Peter exits.

INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Peter hurries down the corridor, passing by a nurse. The

same one who bandaged Miranda earlier, so let's give her

a proper name: CLAIRE. She pushes her cart into the

elevator.

INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

Claire and her cart emerge from the elevator and she

heads down the long corridor, reaches a door and unlocks

it.

INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM

TIGHT ON a row of drug-filled shelves. Claire parks her

cart and kicks off her shoes. Digs a pack of smokes out

of her stashed purse when a pair of hands grab her.

Claire squeaks until she sees her attacker: a stoner

type named SIMON. Deftly unbuttoning her uniform, hands

all over her. She means to resist but he's got such

boyish charm.

CONTINUED:

She finally twists herself out of his grasp. Points an

accusing finger, but she's grinning. Blushing, even.

Properly reprimanded, Simon picks up his folded uniform

and prepares to leave, head hung low.

He exits.    She shakes her head, slips her uniform back

on.

INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Simon presses the button, waits. He checks inside his

folded uniform where we see several stolen vials of

sedatives. The doors begin to close when --

He hides the loot behind his back, busted.       She holds the

door open and tosses him his yellow shirt.

She turns and exits.     The doors slide shut.   Meet our

rapist.

INT. WOODWARD CAFETERIA - DAY

Bustling with activity. The room is divided into two:          a

large main area where the patients eat, plus a second,

smaller upstairs area for the staff.

BOOM DOWN to find Miranda eating at a long table.

Shelley beside her, playing with her plastic fork. Jenna

taps an unlit cigarette. As usual, Irene keeps watch

nearby.

CONTINUED:

Optometrist?     Miranda starts to correct her, but lets it

go.

Miranda's gaze strays from this, um, most compelling of

conversations and comes to rest on Chloe. Alone at

another table. Heavily sedated. A wreck.

Miranda rises and walks over. Shelley waits until she's

out of hearing range, leans in to Jenna --

Jenna rolls her eyes, returns to her food.

UPSTAIRS

Parsons watches intrigued as Miranda sits beside Chloe

and starts talking. From Parson's POV up above we can

see pretty much the entire dining area.

BACK TO MIRANDA

Trying to get Chloe's attention. But Chloe just stares

at her untouched food, glassy-eyed.

No reaction.

Nothing.

Now Chloe looks at her, like something finally registers.

Chloe simply stares.    Finally shakes her head.

CONTINUED:

Chloe abruptly grabs her arm.     Tightly.

PUSH IN ON Miranda.     Deeply affected by Chloe's words, as

we --

INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY AND NIGHT

MIRANDA'S RESIGNED DAILY GRIND IN QUICK DISSOLVES --

A) Miranda and the other patients line up for meds in

the rec room.

B) Irene keeps watch in the garden as the women get

their daily fresh air.

C) Wardens watch as each patient enters their cell at

night and the lights go off.

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT

Echoing an earlier scene, we are MOVING TOWARDS her --

her pale skin visible in the dim monochromatic light.

Miranda flicks a look this way and that, alert. Sensing

something.

CONTINUED:

Just like a crazy person. She listens for any further

noise, hears none and shuts her eyes. Exhausted.

Silence. But now the BEDSPRINGS CREAK behind her and she

whips around and starts to scream as a big hand covers

her mouth. Her eyes open wide at the sight of Simon, in

his yellow shirt. He shoves her against the mattress and

presses his full weight against her. She lets out a

muffled scream as he uncaps a syringe with his teeth and

brings the plunger to her throat. Straight into her

jugular.

She flails and kicks desperately but he pins her down.

The BEDSPRINGS STRAIN violently and now he's straddling

her, squeezing the plunger into her throat. Her eyes

welling up:

She manages to free one hand and yanks the syringe from

her throat. It flies to the floor. He grins, enjoying

this:

Simon paws at her clothes as she struggles to defend

herself. He finally slaps her free arm down. Presses

his knee against it, immobilizing her once more. Now he

produces another syringe from his pocket. Checks it.

Miranda shakes her head, pleading. A scream stuck in her

throat. But nobody can hear her.

Simon brings the syringe towards her when suddenly we

hear a LOUD CLANGING at the door. Shaking it off its

hinges.

CONTINUED:

Simon looks up, confused. Nobody is there. The split-

second distraction is all Miranda needs to shove him off

the bed. She fumbles for the discarded syringe and STABS

HIS CHEST WITH IT -- squeezes the plunger --

Simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body

goes limp. Miranda exhales, coming back to herself. A

beat.

No response.     Miranda grabs his keys, begins to undress

him.

SECURITY CAMERA POV

shows a uniformed janitor calmly walking down the

corridor. PULL BACK to see we are in --

INT. SURVEILLANCE BOOTH - NIGHT

A bank of monitors keep watch on the premises   after dark.

TWO GUARDS play cards (Uno), bored to tears.    A cursory

glance at the monitors produces no reaction.    Certainly a

janitor walking down the corridor is no cause   for alarm.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Dead quiet. CRICKETS CHIRP or whatever it is    crickets

do. Miranda steadies her breathing, perusing    rows of

unfamiliar cars. She clicks Simon's key-ring    button

repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on   and off.

INT. SIMON'S CAR - NIGHT

Miranda slips behind the wheel, STARTS the CAR. The RADIO

KICKS IN at EAR-DEAFENING VOLUME. She nearly drops dead.

EXT. WOODWARD GATE - NIGHT

The gate GUARD reads a magazine as Miranda's stolen car

approaches. The guard barely registers the driver in the

booth mirror, immersed in his article. Hits a button to

open the gate for him. It opens SLOWLY. S-l-o-w-l-y.

INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Miranda, sweating, watches the receding image of the

institute behind her. Turns on the main road. Free.

She glances back, makes sure no one is following her.

Catches her own reflection in the rearview mirror: the

scared eyes, the haunted face. The new version of

herself.

She flips the RADIO dial: BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. BAD

COUNTRY. BAD DISCO. More BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. She finds

IGGY POP'S entirely appropriate "THE PASSENGER) and lets

it play.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Now we are seeing her as if from the POV of someone

traveling alongside the car. Peering THROUGH the

passenger window. Miranda becomes aware of this, slowly

glances over. Sees nothing but her own reflection.

Turns back forward.

We NOTICE the blue cigarette lighter key chain dangling

off the dashboard. Nothing but a long stretch of road

ahead.

EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night. Miranda

parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house.

Steels herself, climbs out of the car and heads around

back.

She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted plant, takes a

deep breath and lets herself in through the back door.

INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

POLICE CRIME-SCENE TAPE everywhere. She turns on the

kitchen light only and scurries to her bedroom without

even looking in the direction of the living room,

avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether.

Eerie as hell --

INT. BEDROOM - QUICK CUTS

Miranda stuffs clothes into a suitcase, finds her passport,

digs out some cash from a box. Quick change of clothes to

get rid of the rapist's uniform. Fast, fast, fast --

INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Miranda watches her house fade from view in the rearview

mirror as she drives down the block. Shudders. Flips

the RADIO dial with shaky hands.

She looks in the rearview mirror once more.      Only this

time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes.

Rachel's.     Inside the car.

Rachel's mouth opens unnaturally wide, revealing a gaping

abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet

sound. A threatening howl this time, pure venom.

Miranda covers her face, jerks the car. It does a 180

and slides to a halt in the middle of the street --

Facing the direction of her house again.

EXT. STREET

Miranda jumps out, panicked. Glances around. Looks

inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath,

making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a

U-turn.

INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling

and turns UP the RADIO. GUNS the pedal. Freaked.

She's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES --

The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key

but suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and

notices the key is gone.

A dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more

startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the

middle of the street.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty

street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys.

We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The

moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the

glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda

jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened

by a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes.

She watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in

her throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the

pesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now.

BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround

the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS

fastened around the insulators of a thick power line.

From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys.

And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming

loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some

invisible force --

Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP

and turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE

WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings

straight towards the paralyzed Miranda --

She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle,

back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to

a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The

wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends

SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like

lightning.

A silent, sudden beat.   That was as close as close gets.

No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing

over her shoulder, seemingly demented:

A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the

middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING

abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the

sound.

It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door

SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on.

CONTINUED:

Clearly Rachel wants her back in the house.

But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards

it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the

road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost

electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate

yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car.

INT. SIMON'S CAR

Miranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here.

She's never asked a ghost for permission before:

She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk.

INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE

Miranda stands in her living room, staring at her

handiwork. Frozen with dread.

The blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains.

The upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk

outline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the

shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied

footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc.

The faded writing on the wall:       "NOT ALONE."

Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's

supposed to be looking for.

CONTINUED:

Not knowing what else to do, she turns to exit when the

TELEVISION SET suddenly COMES TO LIFE, making her jump.

The unmistakable MUSIC from some old WB cartoon at FULL

BLAST.

She stares at the TV screen. Is there some sign here she

should be able to follow? She crosses to turn it off and

immediately doubles over in pain --

She looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck

right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin.

Blood already seeping from the nasty cut --

INT. BATHROOM

Miranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out

the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket. She

grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the

cut.

And now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears

the hollow WET SOUND we've come to associate with Rachel.

Inside the room with her --

Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror

move? We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds

perfectly still, listening. The SOUND now seems to have

STOPPED. A silent beat.

She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing

as the alcohol burns her skin. It looks painful.

And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes

her look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like

the night of the slaughter: flames all around her. Naked

arms raised. Wrists shackled. Anima Sola.

She stares.     Mesmerized.    The sound of FLAMES GROWING

LOUDER.

Miranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the

image reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if

the two versions of her are literally walking towards

each other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces

mere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the

mirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back.

CONTINUED:

Miranda stares at her fingertips. The tips are burnt.

The skin sizzles softly. 200 percent scientifically

impossible. And when she looks up at the mirror again --

the image is gone.

It is now deathly quiet. And what she finds herself

staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something

just behind her. A folded newspaper discarded in the far

corner of the room.

She turns to look at it now. It's opened to the REALTY

LISTINGS page. Doug must have left it there. She picks

it up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank-

repossessed property.

The address is in Willows Creek.

Her brain wires start clicking. This must be what Rachel

wanted her to see. She stares at it.

PUSH IN ON the picture as we --

EXT. WILLOWS CREEK PROPERTY - DAWN

A "FOR SALE" sign still flapping in the wind.   The first

few rays of light break through the dawn sky.

Miranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it

FILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out.

She studies the house before walking up the drive. We

watch her peek through windows and walk around back,

looking for something. What exactly, we don't know.

(Neither does she.)

She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes

her stare now on the barn. The one place he hasn't

looked.

INT. BARN

Dark, empty. The WIND outside causes the ALUMINUM SIDING

to FLAP NOISILY. It's slightly unnerving, but hey, it's

just the wind. Miranda covers the distance of the large

room, perplexed. There is something about this place.

Something she can't quite put her finger on. Beckoning

her.

With a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front

door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops

her. She moves to it.

CONTINUED:

And here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow

gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A

padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both

walls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy

padlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall

and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only

a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness

beyond, but can't see a thing.

Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides

herself into the claustrophobic slot.

She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face

brushes against something hanging in the air. She stops,

startled. It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light

bulb.

She tugs on it. And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow

to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of

her. She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY

CREAK. She peers into the pitch-black basement below.

Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs

down.

INT. SECRET BASEMENT

Miranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness.

Whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb

upstairs does not reach here. She feels around the wall

for a switch. Nothing.

Abruptly there's a sharp CLICK as she lights Simon's key-

chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast

space. Rats scurry for cover. It takes a second to orient

ourselves. Something metallic catches the lighter's

reflection way in back. Miranda walks towards it.

She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on

the floor. She stops. Kneels down and in the dim half-

light we make out a backpack. She unzips it and rifles

through it (T-shirts, underwear, Walkman) until she finds

a wallet. Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next

to the ID: the picture belongs to a teenager named

"TRACY MARIE SEAVER."

CONTINUED:

The lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it

click off. When it comes back on we see she has wrapped

a ragged T-shirt around it for insulation.

Miranda steps deeper into the room. Up ahead, she can

make out the metallic thing that reflected light before.

It is a hook in the ceiling. And suspended from it are

several heavy chains.

Like a meat rack.

And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and

sees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down,

tied around the hands and ankles.

Medical training kicking in, Miranda quickly lowers the

girl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter

away.

(We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so

that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an

almost strobe-light effect:)

She checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's

adrenaline at full tilt --

She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the

girl's pupils. Inspects them. Slaps her repeatedly,

clinically.

The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the

immediate surroundings:   household tools strewn about;

wire cutters, pliers -- a pool of dried blood.

Nothing. She unties the wires around the girl's ankles.

The skin swollen grotesquely around them. She shakes the

girl. Slowly coming to the realization that it's too

late.

EXT. BARN - LATER

Miranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and

throws up. The bright light outside blinding her

momentarily. Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to

register --

THE PATROL CAR

parked in front of the house. A POLICE OFFICER

cautiously peering inside her stolen car. He looks up

and notices her.

Miranda hesitates. Nowhere to run.      The officer waves.

His name is TURLINGTON.

He says this while already strolling over.        Miranda's

mind races a mile a minute --

She stares at the young, friendly cop. His left hand

resting on his belt. Right next to his gun. But it

seems as if he has no idea who she is. At least not yet.

She nods, nerves shot to hell.     Starts walking.

CONTINUED:

The cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of

marital dynamics. He flashes a smile but suddenly stops,

whips out his gun and trains it on her --

Miranda shuts her eyes, busted.     Freezes.

Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands.

A confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction he's

looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door. Dragging

herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock.

Battered, yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive.

But just barely.

EXT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY

A car pulls up to the chaotic ER area.       Phil Parsons and

Pete step out, rush inside.

INT. HOSPITAL ER - MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Sheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal. But even here he

can't find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his

case --

CONTINUED:

Sheriff Ryan zips up his pants, flushes and runs the sink

to wash his hands --

Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to

the waiting room, Teddy following closely --

INT. ER WAITING ROOM

Paramedics and nurses doing their thing. The young

officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of

coffee.

Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee, notices

Parsons and Pete approaching. Relief crosses his face.

CONTINUED:

Teddy waves him off in frustration.     Goes to talk to

Turlington.

Sheriff Ryan notices Teddy talking to Turlington --

The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons. They walk over to

the water cooler where they can talk more privately.

CONTINUED:

Parsons nods, lost in thought.        Sheriff Ryan returns.

Parsons frowns at this, concerned.        Pete studies him.

INT. COUNTY STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY

Bare room. A desk and two chairs. Glass window         panes to

insure no privacy. DOROTHY PARSONS (50s) waits,        seated.

The door opens and a DEPUTY escorts Miranda in.        She sits

across from Dorothy, looking as lost as can be.        A long

beat.

Miranda doesn't answer. Her mind elsewhere.         Namely back

at the barn and how it connects to Rachel.

She pauses here. Miranda looks up now. Her face hollow

and exhausted. Bags under her eyes. A person who has

seen too much. Wondering where the hell this is going.

CONTINUED:

She drifts off.     Takes a beat to collect herself and

resume:

Miranda can't help but smile to herself at that.

Dorothy Parsons starts to cry. A moment passes like

this. It seems she won't recover enough to continue her

tale.

Dorothy shakes her head, determined to finish.       She pulls

out a folded piece of paper.

CONTINUED:

She slides the paper over. Miranda watches her

carefully, then looks at the piece of paper. The numbers

are:

1-0-2-2-0-1.

A long beat.

Miranda studies it. Studies this woman, who quite

frankly seems to have completely lost her mind. Then she

looks back at the numbers and is slowly hit with a

realization.

She stares at Dorothy, stunned. Brain click-click-

clicking. Her wildest fears confirmed: Doug is behind

this somehow.

Dorothy stares at her, scared.     And finally nods.

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY

Pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as

TWO POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Miranda is brought out of

one of the cruisers by two OFFICERS.

Sheriff Ryan leans out of the other cruiser.

CONTINUED:

Pete sighs, gestures for the officers to bring her in.

Irene and two heavy-duty orderlies will also be part of

the escort. Miranda locks eyes with Pete as she

approaches.

The Sheriff waves, whatever. Knocks twice on the hood

and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive.

Pete regards her now, has no idea what she's going on

about this time. Tries to remain professional.

INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

Lunch time for the female wing. An excited Shelley

rushes over to a table where Chloe and Jenna are,

whispers something to them. They glance at the door.

CONTINUED:

A moment later, Miranda walks in with her police escort.

Taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door.

An uneasy Pete leads. Irene and the wardens at the rear.

Miranda glances at the women staring at her like a

specimen. Like somehow she's even more dangerous than

them. Top dog, as it were, of the crazies.

And then, halfway across the room, one of the women

stands up. Chloe. She claps her hands together.

Slowly. Miranda watches her, confused. And slowly

Shelly, Jenna and others rise as well. All of them

joining Chloe in clapping.

Pete nods.     Just what he needed.   The OFFICERS trade looks.

Irene shakes her head, amused.

The entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their

solidarity for Miranda. Chloe locks eyes with her,

mouths the words "thank you."

And Miranda is hauled out the side door.

INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL

White. Surveillance cameras in every corner. Two

separate doors with elaborate locks. High security all

around. The officers undo Miranda's cuffs and excuse

themselves.

Pete gestures for Irene and the Orderlies to leave as

well.

CONTINUED:

Once the doors are locked and they're alone, the

conversation jumps straight into frustrated high gear:

Pete is at the end of his rope. Can't hide his sadness

when he looks at her. Still, he tries to get her back on

track:

CONTINUED:

She shows him the crumpled newspaper listing.

Pete stares at the realty listing for Willows Creek.

Pete takes all of this in.     Dumbfounded.

CONTINUED:

Pete can see that she's petrified. He starts to speak,

but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his

lips. The gesture is tender, almost romantic. A

reminder of their very real connection.

EXT. NEWCASTLE COMMUNITY BANK PARKING LOT - DAY

A tense Phil and Dorothy Parsons in their parked car.

She sighs, climbs out of the car, leaving him there.

Takes three steps. Stops. Turns back around and lets

him have it:

BANK CUSTOMERS walk around the argument, pretending not

to hear. Phil is mortified. But Dorothy doesn't care:

CONTINUED:

She turns and storms off. Phil takes it all in for the

first time. A moment later he climbs out of the car.

INT. BANK VAULT - DAY

A solemn GUARD places the safety deposit box on the table

in the middle of the room. Steps back through the gate

and waits. Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a

moment.

Finally, Phil punches in the code written out by his wife

and opens it. He sorts through some paperwork that means

nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope. He

opens it and spills the contents on the table.

It is a stack of POLAROIDS.

Dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens. She

grabs onto the table, shakily -- and is forced to sit

down. A horrified sob rises from deep inside her, comes

out like the howl of a dying animal. Her husband pales,

all blood draining from his face.

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - EVENING

The sky darkens fast.     The storm moving in.

INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NURSES' STATION

THUNDER RUMBLES outside, making a tray of meds rattle.

PAN UP to see Consuelo, the round black woman we might

remember Chloe beating up earlier. She shakes her head.

INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL

Miranda looks up at the sound of the BOLT BEING DRAWN and

the handle unfastened. Through the door comes Consuelo,

carrying a tray. Sets it down by the bed.

She is on her way out when she pauses, stares at Miranda.

CONTINUED:

That term again, "we." Doctor-speak.         Miranda doesn't

have the energy for it:

What was that? Normally Miranda would look at this woman

as if she were crazy, but things have changed.

Consuelo holds Miranda's hands firmly, "reading" her.

CONTINUED:

Consuelo holds up a finger, hushing Miranda.      She's

receiving something here. Shudders.

Consuelo's grip tightens on Miranda as we --

FLASHBACK - EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT

We're back at the bridge.     Rachel pries open Miranda's

mouth. Miranda panics:

Rachel opens her mouth wide like a snake. And as Miranda

screams, blood starts leaking out of Rachel's wounds.

And now we see it. Rachel's lips touch Miranda's and

BREATHE HER SPIRIT INTO Miranda with a WHOOSH --

INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)

Consuelo lets go of Miranda's hand. Like recoiling from

fire. Speaks in the simplest of ways. The truth:

Consuelo crosses herself. A sign of respect for the

situation. But it has a chilling effect on Miranda.

Prayers?   What good is that going to do?   Consuelo exits.

EXT. PARSONS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Two POLICE CRUISERS parked outside.

INT. PARSONS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A glassy-eyed Phil Parsons serves himself another Scotch,

devastated. The SHOT is FRAMED so that we see the

bedroom door is open, Dorothy lying in bed, heavily

tranquilized.

Sheriff Ryan inspects the photographs.

ON THE LURID POLAROIDS

Postcards from hell: scared teenage girls in forced

poses -- gagged, tortured -- Andrea White, Jenny Dixon,

Tracy Seaver...

CONTINUED:

And young Rachel Parsons.

CONTINUED:

Parsons doesn't respond.     His eyes far away.

And now the Sheriff can see that Parsons is crying.

Quietly, miserably. And it's a disparaging sight.

Sheriff Ryan exits. Two deputies follow, RADIOS

SQUAWKING.

Parsons remains still for a moment, then digs a

photograph out of a drawer. A picture of Rachel in

happier times.

He sits there, staring at his dead daughter. Grieving.

WE PULL BACK to see he is not alone. Rachel is watching

him.

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT

The WIND has really PICKED UP now. A massive LIGHTNING

BOLT streaks the sky, officially announcing the storm's

onset.

A POLICE CRUISER pulls up to the guard gate.

INT. WOODWARD SURVEILLANCE BOOTH

PAN OFF the bank of monitors TO the same two guards we've

seen before. Playing yet another bored card game. The

LIGHT RAPPING on their glass door makes them look up.

TWO OFFICERS stand there.       We recognize one of them:

The Guards shake their heads, chuckle.

The Guard points at the bank of monitors.

ON MONITOR

Miranda inside her pristine white cell.       Restlessly

pacing.

The men share a chuckle over that one when suddenly

THUNDER CRACKLES and the power goes out.

No monitors, no radio, no nothing.       Pitch black.

Abruptly there's a SERIES OF sharp CLICKS as FOUR

FLASHLIGHTS come alive.

INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL

The THUNDER outside RATTLES the WINDOW PANE. The only

light source being the intermittent LIGHTNING as the

STORM RAGES.

She paces in the dark.    Sits.   Waits.

INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - STAIRS - SAME TIME

The two cops use their flashlights to hustle up the stairs.

INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME

Miranda holds her breath, listens. And sure enough,

somebody else is in the room. She looks around.

And now LIGHTNING streaks the room and we see Rachel in

the corner. Staring with her dead eyes. Moving towards

her.

But it doesn't work. Rachel keeps walking towards her.

Miranda backs up against the wall. Trapped. Fighting

tears --

INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DIFFERENT FLOOR - STAIRS -

SAME TIME

The cops reach the landing where we see other flashlights

down the corridor. They walk towards them.

CONTINUED:

The cops head down the corridor.

INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME

Rachel stretches out her arm to Miranda's face --

Rachel slowly shakes her head, places her hands on

Miranda's eyes and shuts them --

MIRANDA'S VISION - ANDREA WHITE

in her school uniform. Staring straight ahead. Now the

image is bathed in a red and blue light and we see her

half-naked, bruised. Dead.

JENNY DIXON

staring AT us in her school uniform. Now abruptly she is

a hellish vision: opening her mouth in agony, also

bathed in the strange red and blue light --

END OF MIRANDA'S VISION.

INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda screams at the visions.    Rachel holds her steady.

CONTINUED:

Now a heavy RATTLING makes her turn to the door. One of

the HINGES has SHATTERED and the latch itself is half-

pulled from the doorframe. Relentless POUNDING on the

other side.

There's a deafening SOUND like a thousand bells ringing

at once and Miranda covers her ears --

Outside WE HEAR MURMURS, YELLS, INSTRUCTIONS --

INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - CORRIDOR

The cops arrive to find every door in the corridor flung

open. Confused patients spill out as guards and nurses

try to restore order. RADIOS SQUAWK, flashlights beam

and FOOTSTEPS fill the dark corridor as patients try to

escape.

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

FIRE ENGINES and PATROL CARS arrive at the scene, SIRENS

blazing. Sheriff Ryan and additional deputies rush from

their cars to contain the breakout. A large SPOTLIGHT

comes to life. We spot Jenna making a run for the garden

wall when the spotlight hits her. Two officers rush

after her.

INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE

Sheriff Ryan makes his way through the mayhem, past Irene

helping a patient, past nurse Claire cowering in a corner --

Sheriff Ryan hits the stairs.

INT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

Officer Turlington runs down the corridor, searching

frantically with his flashlight --

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT

A car pulls up at the scene.     Pete and Parsons step out.

CONTINUED:

Pete rushes up the steps --

INT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

Officer Turlington looks inside Miranda's cell. Empty.

And as he is about to speak into his walkie he spots her:

Seated by the elevator. Holding a biting block in

Shelley's mouth as her seizing subsides.

He flashes his light at her.     Miranda looks back blankly.

Turlington nods. Miranda looks down at a grateful

Shelley, whose head is cradled in her lap. Brushes the

matted hair off her face. Carefully removes the biting

block, making sure Shelley is alright.

INT. REC ROOM - LATER

The patients are all assembled here. Flashlights galore.

Irene and Consuelo do head counts. Guards, officers,

janitors -- everybody. Irene points a finger at Jenna.

CONTINUED:

Parsons breaks away from Turlington, heads over to Pete

and Miranda --

Miranda scans the near-dark room, looking for someone.

Watches Turlington step aside to take a call on his

radio.   Parsons regards her with newfound respect:

Suddenly all the policemen in the room begin to exit --

Pete glances at Miranda.      She knows exactly who it is:

Turlington is about to exit when Parsons stops him:

INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

The DOOR CRASHES open and Chloe shoves the Sheriff

inside. She has a gun pressed hard against his ear.

CONTINUED:

Sheriff Ryan hesitates.      Chloe presses the gun against

him.

The sound of the UPSTAIRS DOOR BEING THROWN OPEN makes

her glance up. She trains her flashlight at the second

level, stepping behind the Sheriff to use him as cover.

Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM searches the section. Catches the

reflection of a police shield hiding behind a table.

A beat.   Officer Turlington rises.      Slow and deliberate.

CONTINUED:

A voice startles Chloe from behind, at floor level.

Chloe flicks the flashlight to see Miranda by the door.

Chloe flinches at that. Like all this multitasking is

affecting her. She digs the gun deeper into the Sheriff's

neck, making him cower to his knees, execution style --

The Sheriff glances at Miranda. Miranda nods.       The

Sheriff begins unbuttoning his shirt --

CONTINUED:

She starts sobbing.     Letting everything go --

This gets through to Chloe.       Her grip loosens on the gun.

Miranda walks over and embraces her.       Chloe hands her the

gun.

And that's when the power returns.

Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace. Sheriff Ryan

on his knees. In the sudden, shocking glare of returning

light, color abruptly re-enters the world and every

RADIO, PHONE, FAN and MACHINE that were left on HUM TO

LIFE.

Miranda finds herself staring at Sheriff Ryan, bathed in

the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the

cruisers outside. The image a replica of the Andrea

White and Jenny Dixon visions.

Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning

of a chest TATTOO. Miranda slowly trains the gun on the

Sheriff, finally struck with the realization:

She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup-

style WOMAN SURROUNDED BY FLAMES, ARMS RAISED, SHACKLED.

Anima Sola. Miranda's recurring vision from the night of

the slaughter.

CONTINUED:

The Sheriff throws his jacket on, starts walking --

The CLICK! of a SAFETY being released makes him pause.

He turns to look at her. A tense beat.

She glances at Pete's pleading face and the room around

her: cops everywhere. All guns trained on her.

Sheriff Ryan speaks low so only she can hear the

following:

Miranda's finger itches on the trigger as they face off.

Her hand starts to shake. Sheriff Ryan turns and strides

off. Getting away. Further. Further...

But as much as she wants to, she can't bring herself to

do it. Finally brings the gun down. The armed policemen

rush over and disarm her, shove her to the floor and cuff

her.

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT (HEAVY RAIN)

Turlington escorts a cuffed Miranda to a waiting cruiser.

He jumps behind the wheel and starts to pull out when

Pete suddenly taps on Miranda's window, startling her --

CONTINUED:

She shakes her head.     Mouths something Pete can't make out.

Turlington hits the gas. Miranda presses her face

against the window so only Pete can see her say the

following:

Pete locks eyes with her, nods -- as the cruiser leaves.

INT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - RECOVERING ROOM - NIGHT

Tracy Seaver lies unconscious, hooked up to a series of

machines. PULL BACK to find Pete with a young DOCTOR.

Pete nods, disconcerted.      Stares at the girl.

INT. WAITING AREA

The Doctor gestures for Pete to make himself comfortable.

CONTINUED:

The Doctor rushes off.

INT. RECOVERY ROOM #2

Like Tracy Seaver, Simon Reynolds is hooked up to a bunch

of machines and cables. Suddenly his EYES SHOOT OPEN and

the CARDIAC ALARM SQUEALS --

Two NURSES rush in.       The young Doctor right behind.

The EKG whipsaws. The Doctor feels for a pulse, then slaps

on the defibrillator pads, places the paddles on the chest --

He begins chest compressions on Simon's heart. He spasms

violently once, twice -- And then it stops. The Doctor

and Nurses stare at the monitor. Flatline.

Unseen by them, Rachel steps out of the room.

EXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

WE SEE Turlington and two other COPS climb in a patrol

car and drive off. WE MOVE INSIDE the empty station...

INT. SHERIFF RYAN'S OFFICE

Sheriff Ryan takes a healthy chug from a fifth of Scotch,

slips it back in a drawer. Stares at his hands. Steady as

a rock. Takes a deep breath. Knows what he must do next.

A religious man despite everything, he brings his thumb

to his forehead and crosses himself.

INT. COUNTY STATION - HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER

Miranda's eyes snap open at the SOUND OF DEADBOLTS

SLIDING UNLOCKED. Hopeful. Could this be Rachel?

CONTINUED:

A looming figure appears at the door. Doesn't bother to

shut it. Stares at her silently for a long while. And

so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game:

He studies her. Takes a step towards her. Miranda

responds by stepping back. A slow motion semicircle, if

you will. She eyes the open door. Tempted.

She's stalling, trying to keep him talking and he knows

it.

CONTINUED:

Patience tested, he suddenly WHACKS her across the face.

She makes a big effort to hide how much that stung.

And now Miranda briefly takes the reins of the

conversation. Analyst and patient in session.      Echoing

her opening scene with Chloe.

CONTINUED:

SMACK! Another slap across the face. Miranda's knees

buckle. But she remains standing. Her lip trembles.

This throws her off.     She shoots a quick glance at the

door.

She hesitates.    He draws his gun, tired.    Removes the

safety.

CONTINUED:

Miranda is petrified now.      Running out of ways to hide

it.

In a sudden move, Miranda shoves the chair at him and

bolts out the door. The Sheriff doesn't move to stop

her.

INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda dashes down the hallway, trying to escape. Takes

quick inventory of the space: two more holding cells

like her own, a row of filing cabinets, and a storage

area with barred windows. She makes a turn up ahead and

reaches another gate down the corridor. A sliding gate

that closes off the cell area from the main station.

She tries the gate. Locked, naturally.       She shakes and

bangs on it, desperate.

No response. And no way to disguise the sheer panic in

her voice. She fell for his trap. They're all alone

here.

INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - SAME TIME

Ryan smiles at that. Re-holsters his weapon and walks

towards her, taking his time. Relishing the hunt.

INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Now Miranda searches for a place to hide.        His FOOTSTEPS

GETTING CLOSER --

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sheriff Ryan peeks down the corridor where we last saw

Miranda. The gate still locked. She's not there. He

traces her steps, clearly enjoying this:

INT. STORAGE AREA - SAME TIME

Miranda is cramped underneath an upturned desk. The SHOT

is FRAMED so we can see the doorway. She prays silently:

Clearly not here.   Sheriff Ryan's voice getting closer:

He appears at the doorway now, peeks inside the room.

Sensing her in there. Miranda holds her breath.

He reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a

CLANGING SOUND. Miranda wasn't underneath that one. She

scrambles to the door behind him as he turns --

INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to

slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly

SMASHES OPEN against her, knocking her backwards onto the

floor --

He looms over her. She reaches around for anything to

defend herself. Nothing there. Game over --

CONTINUED:

Miranda stares, helpless. The Sheriff gestures for her

to begin. Like he has all the time in the world.

Miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra

under her shirt. Petrified --

His demeanor and voice are eerily calm,    as if in a

trance. He takes the bra from her hand     and hangs it

around her neck, as if helping somebody    with their tie.

She takes a step back and finds herself    pinned against

the wall --

He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking

her. She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole

body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking

uncontrollably --

And now we PAN DOWN TO see Miranda's left hand ever so

slowly reach for his holster...

CONTINUED:

They're so close together their noses nearly touch. He

gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her. He

applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin

to the point of no return --

BLAM! A GUNSHOT rings out and half his ear explodes in a

gush of blood. He stumbles back, still on his feet,

dazed.

He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him.

Struggling to catch her breath. A faint smile forms on

his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events.

He steps forward, almost playfully. She slowly shakes

her head. Wraps her fingers tightly around the

trigger --

He stares at her. Blood flowing from the side of his

head. He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's

open cell, weighing his options at triple speed --

He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills

a BULLET through his forehead. Sheriff Ryan splays

backwards and lands with a crash.

INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

The door to Tracy's room is closed. WE FIND Pete where

we left him, by the soda machine, fighting to stay awake.

CONTINUED:

MOVING TOWARD him, we COME TO REST ON the back of his

neck. So TIGHT we can actually see the hairs on the back

of his neck. And as he feels the SWOOSH of a cold

whisper, they stand up on their ends.

Pete turns to Tracy's room to notice that the door is now

open. Strange. He stands up and walks to the door.

INT. RECOVERY ROOM #1

Pete looks oddly around the room.

As he turns, we REVEAL Rachel slipping out of the room.

Unseen by him, of course. Pete starts to exit when Tracy

opens her eyes. Groggily waking as if from a dream.

EXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Turlington comes out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of

take-out food. Chatting with his colleagues.

INT. HALLWAY TO SHERIFF RYAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Turlington raps on the Sheriff's door and opens it.

No sight of the man.  That's odd. Maybe he's in the

bathroom. Turlington heads in that direction.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Turlington peeks in.      checks the stalls.

Nobody. He notices the back window is open because

raindrops are blown in by the wind. He looks out to the

parking lot for a moment before shutting it.

INT. POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR

The FRONT DESK OFFICER is trying to hold back a grim Pete,

Parsons and Teddy Howard from heading to the back area.

Teddy Howard slaps an official-looking document on him.

Turlington looks over the paperwork, confused.

Turlington is not used to being spoken to this way,

certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric

institutes. He leads the men down the corridor and

unlocks the cell. The men wait as all three locks are

dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open.

The men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks.

INT. HOLDING CELL

Sheriff Ryan, splayed.   Very dead.

CONTINUED:

Teddy Howard has to look away. Pete places his hand on

Parsons' shoulder. Parsons simply glares at the dead

man, eyes filled with hatred.

No sign of Miranda anywhere.        Vanished.   Like Houdini.

EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY

CAMERA SOARS THROUGH the tall gates, PAST the guard, PAST

the sprinklers watering the impressive gardens. A

TAXICAB pulls up.

SUPERIMPOSE:     SIX MONTHS LATER

A healthier, much happier-looking Chloe shakes Pete's

hand at the front steps. Small suitcase by her side.

Chloe smiles.     Awkward.   Her first day out in the real

world.

Chloe picks up her bag, climbs down the steps to her cab.

Stops midway, turns:

Pete shakes his head. Chloe nods, climbs inside the cab.

Pete waves as it drives off. Then he pulls out a postcard

from his pocket. It has a New York City postmark.

INSERT - POSTCARD

NEWSPAPER HEADLINES

fly AT us under her V.O.:

A) "Female doctor still at large, wanted for

questioning," with a picture of Miranda underneath.

B) "Guilt-ridden serial killer killed accomplice, then

killed self: Female Doctor cleared on charges."

Pictures of Sheriff Ryan and Douglas Grey side by side.

C) "Authorities close case on dual serial killers:

community mourns murdered daughters." A picture of

Officer Turlington, Pete, and Phil Parsons at a press

conference.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

BOOM DOWN TO a young woman kneeling down to set flowers

on a grave and we recognize her as Tracy Seaver.

Shockingly cleaned up and properly attired -- she's even
