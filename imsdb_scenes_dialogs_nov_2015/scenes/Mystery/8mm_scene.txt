Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a

WALL SAFE.  The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.

FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny

GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a

nondescript room with little furniture.  Looks like a hotel

room.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful

girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,

staring blankly.  The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts

long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl

still stares oblivious.  The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and

DUCT TAPE.  The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...

Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.

ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a

bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.

The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with

eye holes and a mouth.  The mask covers his entire head.

He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,

pale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems

to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and

the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole

CLATTER.  It's all one long take.  The CAMERA MOVES to favor

the girl...

Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.

ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the

girl, knocking her back on the bed...

Welles grimaces.

ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated

position.  The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes

closed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thumbs

to open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his

fingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man backs

away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked

Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid

out.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...

Welles rises slowly, still watching.

ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves

back towards the girl...

Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.

involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his

fist to his mouth, breathing hard.

still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.

A long line of HOMELESS PERSONS trails out the door.  Welles

stands out front, showing the PICTURE to a VOLUNTEER with a

broom, and a PRIEST...

The volunteer and priest can't help.  Welles is weary,

futility beginning to wear on him, walks to his car...

INT.  WELLES' RENTAL CAR -- IN MOTION -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

Welles smokes, driving, blankly watching the road ahead...

EXT.  FREEWAY --

FOLLOW Welles' car speeding along...

PULL BACK: still FOLLOWING WELLES' CAR, over the FREEWAY...

CONTINUE TO PULL BACK -- till Welles' car is very, very far

below -- REVEALING the staggering size of the City of Los

Angeles, where the lights go on forever and forever.

INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

Welles is seated, elbows on his knees, reading the DIARY...

Welles has come to the end of the writing in the DIARY.  The

next PHOTOCOPIED PAGE shows an image of the TORN RAGGED EDGE

of the diary's missing page.

EXT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY

Welles enters this "ADULT VIDEO" storefront.

INT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY

The CLERK is a sleazy forty-year-old man with rings in his

pierced nose and lips, behind a counter by the door.  He

watches Welles pass.

Welles looks around, uncomfortable.  A few of the other

CUSTOMERS, all men, sneak glances at Welles.  Display

shelves run floor to ceiling, full of hundreds of shrink-

wrapped XXX PORNO TAPES.  Welles pretends to browse.

Handmade signs above each section identify content: "ANAL,"

"BIG TITS," "CUMSHOTS," "BONDAGE and FETISH," etc...

Welles looks back at the clerk, who stares at Welles.

Welles feels obligated to pick up a box and act like he's

considering it.  He glances at other customers.

Each man keeps his eyes forward on the pornography.  One guy

has his arms full of about ten videos.

Welles puts the tape back, walks to the front counter.  The

clerk watches him the whole time.

The clerk just stares at Welles.

Welles considers, decides to leave, exiting...

INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

Welles comes in through the blacked-out door.  This place is

larger than the last.  TWO CLERKS are behind the counter.

One clerk's pricing porn, the other, MAX, 25, reads a porno-

novel.  Max has long hair, colorful tattoos covering his

forearms, has a HIGHLIGHTER MARKER in his mouth.

Welles browses.  There's a huge video bargain bin.  Walls

are covered in videos, sex toys, inflatable women, etc.

CUSTOMERS, again all wary males, follow proper porn-shop

etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper.

There are "PEEP SHOW" booths in the back.  A MAN looks

around, trying to be nonchalant, sweating profusely,

slipping behind one curtain.

Welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple-pack of

dildos, looks towards the front...

Behind the register, Max takes a look to make sure the other

clerk is busy, takes the cap of his Highlighter pen and

highlights a section in the book he's reading.

Welles notes this.  He goes to the substantial MAGAZINE

RACK, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it.  He selects

sex MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS, choosing about twenty-five.

Welles takes this pile up to Max, gets out his wallet.  Max

starts ringing everything up.

Max shoves everything into a bag and hands it over.

Welles takes the bag.  Max returns to his book.  Welles is

leaving, but stops at the end of the counter.

Max holds up the book, "ANAL SECRETARY."

Max takes a glance at the other clerk, opens the pages of

the book and shows it to Welles.  "

Another CUSTOMER clears his throat, waiting at the register.

Max turns to help him.  Welles heads out.

INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

Welles is at a table, porn publications spread out before

him, looking through the back of a PORNO TABLOID...

Turning pages of HARDCORE ADVERTISEMENTS: "

"

Animals -- you've got to see it to believe it...

Welles moves on to the next MAGAZINE, turning to the back,

again, page after page: "

amateur photos of naked men and women with faces and

genitalia blacked over... "

Seeking Women

It is endless.  More

OFFERED,

Welles leaves it, overwhelmed, goes to lay down on the bed.

He picks up his cellular phone, dialing.

INT.  NONDESCRIPT ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

In a dark room, we don't know where, a DARK FIGURE of a MAN

is silhouetted.  He wears HEADPHONES,

INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

Welles shuts his eyes, still on the cellular...

INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

Max is at the register.  A crewcut WOMAN in overalls works

behind the counter with him.  Welles approaches.

Welles shows his IDENTIFICATION, lets Max get a good look.

Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the counter.

Welles leaves.  Max watches him go.  Max opens the envelope,

takes out two fifty dollar bills, pockets them.

EXT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

Welles stands down the sidewalk, smoking.  Max comes out

from the porn shop, walks to Welles, looking around.

Welles and Max walk down the block, past HOMELESS MEN with

shopping carts overflowing with junk.

Welles walks away.

INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT

Welles sleeps, despite the stead SOUND of TRAFFIC racing by

his window.  The PHONE RINGS, waking him.  Welles looks at

the clock radio,

EXT.  DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

Against the backdrop of downtown LA's bright skyscrapers,

Welles' rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city,

smaller, older, darker buildings...

EXT.  DOWNTOWN STREETS -- NIGHT

The only people on the street are HOMELESS and SHADY

CHARACTERS.  Welles' car makes its way to a big deserted

PARKING LOT.  There are a few cars parked in one corner.

Welles parks near the other cars and gets out.  Max stands

against a chain link fence.  Welles goes to meet him.

Max leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways.

EXT.  DOWNTOWN ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

Max and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between

decaying brink buildings.  They cone to a STAIRWELL leading

down to pitch dark...

INT.  OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT

Max enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow,

labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs.  Welles follows.

They come to another STAIRWAY leading down.  At the bottom,

a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors.

Max heads to the double doors, waits for Welles.

INT.  BASEMENT -- NIGHT

Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind

of small, underground porn flea market.  It's incredibly

quiet.  About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows.  The

MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so "CUSTOMERS"

looking through the merchandise make those in the previous

porn shops look like high society.

These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot

bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members

Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in

their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.

Welles makes his way to the tables, wary.  One table is

covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of

PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked.  Each photo is

wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape.

Welles swallows back disgust.

The next table is piled high with used pornographic

MAGAZINES.  There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out.

X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands.

Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette.

Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks

other than hand written labels with numbers written out,

"

grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE.

Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN

beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures.

Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry

looking DEALER who's counting money.

Welles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip.

The dealer sits and keeps counting cash.

Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED

DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters...

INSIDE THE CURTAIN

Folding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent

movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag

and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an

examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.

In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting,

obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent

over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG.

A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.

Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.

INT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

Not many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max

eats a huge breakfast.

Welles watches Max eat.

EXT.  ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

Max and Welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking.

ACROSS THE STREET

INSIDE A PARKED CAR, through the windshield, SOMEONE watches

Max and Welles say goodnight.  Max walks to a waiting taxi.

It's the sinister lawyer watching, LONGDALE, the late Mr.

Christian's attorney, watching Welles go to his rental car.

INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

Welles is seated, PROJECTOR RUNNING, watching the 8MM film.

The last of the film makes its way through, threading out.

The take-up reel spins, the film's tail flapping...

Welles stares at the blank white square of light projected

onto the wall.  CELLULAR PHONE is HEARD RINGING...

Welles finally looks to the projector, turns it off.  The

PHONE'S RINGING.  Welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at

the cellular phone on the bedside table.  RINGING...

Welles lets it RING.  RINGING... RINGING... till it finally

stops.  Welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes.

INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Mrs. Christian is behind the desk, surrounded by BOXES of

BANK RECORDS and FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, on the PHONE.

Welles considers this, lost in thought.

EXT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL -- DAY

TEENAGERS work cleaning this large DORMITORY, sweeping and

mopping the floor, making the bunk beds, washing windows.

Welles stands with an elderly, black NUN in plain clothing.

Welles hands the woman the PICTURE of MARY.  The woman puts

on her glasses, looks at the picture... looks at Welles.

INT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL, STORAGE AREA -- DAY

In a basement corner, Welles watches as the nun uses keys to

open the door of a chain-link STORAGE CAGE.  The cage is

full of junk, BOXES, LAMPS, stacks of CHAIRS.

The nun enters the cage, pushes old BOXES out of her way,

looks up a cob-web covered METAL SHELVES.

The nun sees what she wants, finds a STEP LADDER, tries to

open it.  Welles comes to help her.

Welles climbs the ladder, points at boxes...

Welles takes down a small SUITCASE.  It's covered in dust.

He climbs down the ladder with it.

Welles puts the suitcase down, examines the LUGGAGE TAG:

"

INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

Welles puts Mary's SUITCASE on the bed, opens it.  He takes

out some of Mary's clothing, examines it, lays it aside.

He takes out a ROSARY, more CLOTHING.  Resting on a SWEATER

are two CERAMIC FIGURINES; a teddy bear and kitten.  Welles

examines them, frowning, puts them aside.

He takes out yellowed NEWSPAPER; Help Wanted CLASSIFIEDS,

"

crossed out.  He finds baggie containing a few old JOINTS.

All that's left are more items of CLOTHING, a TOOTHBRUSH and

an ADDRESS BOOK.  Welles examines the address book, finds a

folded piece of paper in the blank pages, unfolds it... it's

the TORN DIARY PAGE, a POEM written in Mary's hand...

Welles goes to a drawer, takes out the photocopy of Mary's

DIARY.  He turns to the ragged edge of the torn page, puts

the DIARY PAGE against it.  Perfect match.

Welles stands looking at the poem.  He turns the page over,

finds written, in cursive:

EXT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

Welles dials the number off the back of the torn diary page,

phone to his ear.  It RINGS, RINGS, RINGS...

Welles hangs up, begins searching the booth's YELLOW PAGES.

EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

A poverty stricken business section of Wilshire.  Welles

gets out of his parked car, looks up at a decaying Art Deco

building that's painted blue top-to-bottom.

Welles crosses through traffic.

INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, LOBBY -- DAY

Welles studies the REGISTRY, finds "

INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- DAY

Paint's peeling.  Walls are water stained.  Welles climbs

stairs, winded, sweating, up the stairwell...

INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY

Welles comes out a stairwell DOOR, catching his breath.  A

couple of SECRETARIES wait for the elevator.  Welles moves

down the hall, around a corner.

Each office door has a window of pebbled, translucent glass.

There's a "Dental Office," "Wilson Travel Cruises," and at

the end of the hall, "

Professional Casting and Distribution, Suite 804.

Welles heads back the way he came.

EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

Welles crosses back to the other side of the street, goes to

stand near his car.  He looks up at the blue office

building, counting up floors, counting windows across.

Satisfied, he turns, backing up, looking up at the tall

OFFICE BUILDING across from the blue building.  There's a

sign on this adjacent building, "

INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE, 9TH FLOOR -- DAY

Empty office.  Welles is let in by a disinterested LANDLORD.

Welles gives a cursory look around, goes to the windows and

opens the blinds.

These windows afford an excellent view of the blue building

across the street, at about 8th floor level.

INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT

Welles has transferred most of his belongings here, SUITCASE

open on the floor, CARD TABLE set up with fast food on it,

an ARMY COT against one wall.  Welles sits in a chair at the

window, looks through BINOCULARS on a TRIPOD.

WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: searching up the dark

floors of the blue building, as Welles counts under his

breath.  Moving over... stopping on one window, FOCUSING...

Welles locks the tripod.  He goes to sit on the army cot,

picks up his CELLULAR.  He looks at the phone, deciding.

He puts down the phone.  He turns off the LAMP on the floor,

lays back in the cot, going to sleep.

INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: watching the window of

Celebrity Films Inc.  We can see most of the office from

here.  It's crowded with junk, BOXES, piles of VIDEO TAPES.

There's a disorganized DESK by the window.

Welles sits looking through the binoculars.

THROUGH BINOCULARS: a pudgy man, EDDIE POOLE, in a loud,

print shirt, comes to sit at the desk, looks through mail.

He smells sleazy even from here, lots of jewelry, Lots of

rings.  He drinks coffee, answers the phone.  He talks into

the phone, looking for something on his desk, agitation

growing, till he's shouting, then slams the phone down.

Welles rises.  He looks to the wall where THREE PHOTOGRAPHS

culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of

Mary, the picture of Masked Man's tattooed hand, and...

... the grainy image of the Third Man in the mirror.

Welles comes to study this third photo.

INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie packs VIDEO TAPES into a box,

covering them with Styrofoam peanuts, sealing the box.

INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie finishes a call and hangs up.  He

sits back in his chair.  He starts looking in his desk

drawers, finds a MAGAZINE and opens it on the desk.  It's

porn.  Eddie turns pages, looking at naked women.  He sits

back in his chair, begins unbuckling his belt.

Welles pulls back from the binoculars in disgust.

INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's on the phone, pouring himself a

drink from the liquor bottle on his desk, finishing the

call, hanging up.  He shakes his head in disgust, drinks the

drink, walks out of view.  After a moment, the lights go out.

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- NIGHT

An old, dented CAR makes its way up the tight, twisting

roads of the Hollywood Hills.  Eddie's at the wheel.  Not

far behind, Welles' rental car follows...

FURTHER ON

Eddie's car pulls into the driveway under the porch of a

ramshackle HOUSE, parks.  Welles' car passes by...

FURTHER, AROUND A CURVE

Welles' car slows once it's out of sight, turns around,

moving back down the hill, slowly...

INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Welles turns out his headlights, coming around the curve

just far enough so the ramshackle house is in view.  Welles

watches Eddie walk up the stairs to the house.

INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie has a visitor.  There's a pretty

GIRL, wearing a tube top, in a chair facing his desk.

Eddie's talking, gesticulating, smiling, cajoling.

Welles watches through binoculars.

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's still taking, stands, coming

around the desk and placing a hand on the girl's shoulder.

The girl says something.  Eddie responds.  The woman shakes

her head, getting up to leave.  Eddie seems to be asking her

to stay, following as she moves out of view.  Eddie comes

back alone, sits at his desk, picks up the phone.

INT.  ESPIONAGE SHOP -- DAY

Ultra high tech for sale.  Welles examines items on the

sales counter as the SALESPERSON watches: a pair of sma1l,

round LISTENING DEVICES, a complicated RECEIVER/TAPE

RECORDER, and a TONE DECODER with LED window.

Welles takes out a thick wad, starts counting.

Welles lays the money on the counter.  The salesperson takes

the money, recounting.

The salesperson starts punching keys on the register.

EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- NIGHT

The blue building sits completely dark.

INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

Welles comes quietly out from the stairwell, wears gloves.

He moves down the hall to the door of "Celebrity Films Inc."

He kneels, begins using LOCK-PICKING TOOLS on the door.

INT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- NIGHT

Welles enters, shuts the door and locks it.  He takes out

his penlight.  There are POSTERS for cheap PORN FILMS on the

wall that we couldn't see through binoculars.  Titles like

"Sex Doctor," "Deep Ass," and "Penal Colony."

There a two FILE CABINETS.  Welles pulls a few drawers,

finds them locked.  VIDEO CASSETTES are everywhere, on the

cabinets, on shelves, piled high on the floor.

Welles goes to Eddie's desk, looking in drawers.  One drawer

is full of X-RATED MAGAZINES.  Another's stuffed with

paperwork, call sheets, contracts.

Welles picks up Eddie's phone, unscrews the earpiece.  He

takes the small, round LISTENING DEVICE from his pocket,

peels off backing to expose adhesive.  He attaches the

listening device inside the phone, puts it back together.

Welles moves towards the door, sweeps the room with the

penlight.  He stops at the file cabinets, takes his lock-

picking tools out, begins working on one file's lock.

He turns the lock, opens a file drawer.  Empty.  He opens

another.  Inside: piles of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

Welles clenches his jaw.

Faces of children.  Shirtless boys.  Girls in pigtails.

INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

Welles' RECEIVER/TAPE RECORDER'S set up by the window,

recording, with the TONE DECODER plugged into it.  Welles

LISTENS through HEADPHONE, looking through binoculars.

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's at his desk, on the PHONE...

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie slams down the phone.  He CANNOT

BE HEARD any longer.  He's cursing, shuffling paperwork.

Welles takes off headphones, picks up his cellular phone.

He drinks soda, opens the phone, dials, nervous, then looks

back through the binoculars.  He waits, clears his throat.

The PHONE'S RINGING... RINGING...

On the floor, the REELS of the tape recorder are TURNING...

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie answers the phone...

Welles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars.

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's slow to hang up the phone.  He

stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  Finally, he runs

his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back

down.  He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink.

Welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie sits motionless.

THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie picks up the phone, DIALS a

NUMBER.  We hear the PHONE RING in the HEADPHONES

THROUGH BINOCULARS: as DINO is HEARD HANGING UP, Eddie

reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office.

Welles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he's

found them.  He looks to the PHOTO of the Third Man.

Welles goes to the RECORDER, turns on the TONE DECODER.  Its

LED window LIGHTS UP.  Welles hits STOP, REWIND, PLAY...

Hits FAST FORWARD... hits PLAY, watching the TONE DECODER.

From the RECORDER, the SOUND of EDDIE DIALING a NUMBER on

his touch tone phone... and as EACH TONE is HEARD, a

number written: "

Thousands of TELEPHONE NUMBERS are LISTED in SEQUENCE, each

with an address.  Welles runs his finger down the page.

EXT.  SOHO STREETS -- DAY

PEDESTRIANS everywhere.  Streets are clogged with DELIVERY

TRUCKS loading and unloading.  Cars horns blow.  Welles

walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder

with other buildings, labeled "

Welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers.

The top button's labeled "Greystone Imports," the bottom

button reads "Lang Interior Design, by appt."  The middle

button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER.

Welles looks up at the building.

EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY

The sun is low.  Less activity on the street.  Welles leans

against a car down the street, smoking a cigarette.

TWO WOMEN walk this way, both in spiked high heels, dressed

in cheap, short, formfitting skirts, both carrying duffel

bags.  They start up the stairs of 1204...

Welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.

The women hit the center button.  A BUZZER sounds as they

head inside.  Welles hurries up the stairs, catching the

door before it closes.

INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, ELEVATOR -- DAY

Welles follows the women into a decrepit ELEVATOR.  One

woman hits "2."  Welles hits "3," steps back in the corner.

Elevator doors creak closed.  The two women are heavily made

up, pretty, but worn, eyes dull.

Welles looks down at the leg of one woman, noticing bruises

through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.

Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR.  The two women get

out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS

painted black.  Welles stops the elevator door from closing.

The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors.  Another

dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter.  The low rumble of

HEAVY METAL MUSIC is HEARD, SILENCED as doors swing shut.

Welles lets the elevator close.

EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

The elevator opens on the FIRST FLOOR.  Welles gets out,

instead of leaving the way he came, heads towards the

rear... FOLLOW him down a hallway, past a SERVICE ELEVATOR...

EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

Welles comes out BACK DOORS into an sunless alleyway with

fire escapes above.  There's a TRASH DUMPSTER, overflowing.

Rats scatter upon Welles, arrival.

Welles looks to make sure he's alone.  He starts tearing

open GARBAGE BAGS.  Flies swarm.  One bag's filled with

empty food containers and old newspapers.

Welles tears open another bag, finds burnt out FLORESCENT

LIGHTBULBS, digs out a handful of empty PHOTO PAPER

PACKAGES, bottles of DEVELOPING CHEMICALS.  He pulls out a

few MAGAZINES; Time, Newsweek, etc...

The magazines are cut up, falling apart, with pictures

chopped out from many pages.  Welles examines ADDRESS LABELS:

EXT.  MOTEL, HELL'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

A TAXI pulls over in front of this flea-bag motel.  Max gets

out with a SUITCASE, looks at the dubious accommodations.

INT.  MOTEL, MAX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Max enters with Welles, turns on a light and throws his

suitcase on the bed.  The room is disgusting.

Max looks in the bathroom.

Max opens his suitcase, takes out THREE VIDEO TAPES.

He hands them to Welles.  The boxes are covered in jumbled

PHOTO COLLAGES: American flag, S+M men and women, a skull,

mannequins, a scorpion, cut-outs of arms, legs and eyeballs.

INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Welles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN.  WE

SEE NOTHING.  We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN

from the TV, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain.

Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet.

Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a

VCR, tosses it aside, tired.  He picks another Dino Velvet

TAPE, puts it in, sits.

ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of

Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a

sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing...

Welles opens another beer.

ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the

ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by

candelabras.  Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in

slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound

woman, struggling.  A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters.

He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth...

This focuses Welles' attention.

ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman...

Max awakens, rolling over, groggy.

Max tries to see, eyes barely open.

Welles watches.  On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket

shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms,

thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples.

Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure.

ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped.

Welles rubs his eyes, sits back.  Max sits up, watching.

ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her

hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...

CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking.

He pulls down the woman's blindfold...

Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...

Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV

FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...

... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face.

FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch

between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked

Man in the snuff film.  A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.

Welles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and

down the woman's body.  The woman's eyes are filled with

fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching.

Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.

INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Welles enters, carries an OVERNIGHT PACKAGE and his LOCK

BOX.  At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the

MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in

thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape.

Welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the

combination, opens it.  He takes out the holster, stands

looking down at the gun.  He puts the holster on.

EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

Welles' Ford waits with turn signal on.  A car pulls out of

Max is in the passenger seat.  Welles looks to 1204.

INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

Welles and Max get off the elevator, moving down the grey

hall, to the black doors.  Welles pushes the INTERCOM

BUTTON.  After a moment, the INTERCOM CRACKLES...

Welles waits, presses the button again.

INT.  DINO VELVET STUDIO -- DAY

The doors BUZZ and Welles and Max warily enter this large,

dark, converted warehouse.  Square pillars shoot from floor

to ceiling.  Shafts of light cut down from high windows.

A large THUG in a pinstripe suit crosses from a far DESK.

Welles looks around, at piles of PROPS; a huge faux-stone

ANGEL and GARGOYLES, elaborate CANDELABRAS, a huge BIRDCAGE,

massive WOODEN CROSS, NAZI FLAGS.

Welles just stands looking at the thug.  A VOICE is HEARD...

Welles and Max look up.  There are SPEAKERS mounted high up

on the pillars, and SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS looking down.

The disgruntled thug starts back across the studio towards

a distant DOOR.  Welles and Max follow...

They notice an elaborate set built in one corner, a TORTURE

CHAMBER, complete with RACK and IRON MAIDEN.

INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- DAY

Thug opens the door and lets Welles and Max in.

The office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of

PICTURES from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned

up to form an indecipherable collage.  A tall LADDER leans

against one wall, near three TELEVISIONS.

DINO VELVET rises behind his desk, a small, bird-like man,

wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.

Welles shakes Dino's hand.  Max looks up at the walls.

IMAGES; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy

photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.

Welles sits.  Shelves behind Dino's desk are piled high with

VIDEO CASSETTES, old MOVIE CAMERAS, big REELS of 16mm FILM.

VIDEOS and MAGAZINES are stacked everywhere.

Welles considers.  Max glances over, looks back to the walls.

Dino grins, showing yellowed teeth.

Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the desk.

Dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips.

Dino stands, picks up a still CAMERA off his desk and comes

to look at Welles, studying him.

Welles leaves.  Max goes with him.  Dino watches them leave.

EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT

HORNS BLARE.  TWO CARS have collided head-on.  A large CROWD

gathers.  One windshield's shattered, blood spattered.  The

driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood.

On a nearby street corner, Welles in on a PAY PHONE.

HEAVY METAL can be HEARD filtered through the receiver.

INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

Dino's stands in the middle of his office, naked, his back

to us, 8MM camera in hand, on the phone.  A NAKED WOMAN

dances for Dino.  A Heavy Metal MUSIC VIDEO plays on a TV.

INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

Welles digs out his notepad, writing.

EXT.  MOTEL COURTYARD, POOL -- NIGHT

HORNS and TRAFFIC are HEARD.  Max and Welles sit in lawn

chairs at the tiny pool.  Welles smokes.  Max drinks beer.

They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit

climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in.

The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.

Welles takes out a thick ENVELOPE, hands it to Max.

Max doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about

fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope.

Max looks at it again, can't believe it.

Welles puts his cigarette out, stands.

Welles walks away, heading to his room.  Max watches him go,

doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope.

The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.

EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY

A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied

buildings.  A few burnt out cars on the street.  Welles

drives through, watchful.

Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn.

He parks the car.

INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.

EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all

directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...

INT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to

the darkness.  A vast, empty space looms before him.

In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a

powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.

There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino.  MACHINE is

seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M

harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.

Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.

Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the

warehouse.  He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS

propped up.  He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...

Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE.  As Welles gets

closer, he notices several things ...

... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along

with several movie LIGHTS

... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside

a pair of HANDCUFFS...

... Machine is watching him as he approaches...

Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his

distance.  Dino's still firing arrows at the target.

Machine's still staring at Welles.

Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.

Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then

turns to look at Welles with a smile.

Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the

table, beside Bowie knifes.  He's sweating.

Dino walks across towards the target.

Dino pulls arrows from the target.

Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the

quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.

Dino shoots another arrow to the target.

A CLATTER attracts Welles attention.  Far across the

warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards.  A CAR with tinted

windows drives in...

The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays

behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...

Machine stands.  He is a giant.

Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.

The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.

Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at

the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.

Welles brings his hand towards his holster...

Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...

The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way.  Can't tell who he

is yet.  Machine heads the direction of the parked car.

Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.

The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer.  It's Eddie Poole.

Welles obeys, walks to the bed.

Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the

other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.

Welles looks across to the car...

The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the

wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way...

Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles.  Welles watches

him.  Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward...

PUNCHES Welles in the side of the head.

Welles goes down, clutching his face.

Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed,

frisking him from head to toe.

Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a

tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles.  Welles looks up,

holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.

Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles.

Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE.

Across the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the

trunk of the car, pulls SOMEONE out...

It's Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly

conscious.  Machine throws him to the floor.

Welles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the

handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy.

Sorrow and rage rises up in Welles, but there's no choice.

Dino takes out HANDCUFF KEYS, throws them to Longdale.

Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him.

Eddie comes to SHOVE Welles.  Welles stumbles to the

ground, gets to his feet.  Welles walks, takes one last

glance back towards Max.  Longdale follows.

EXT.  MANHATTAN STREETS -- DAY

Welles' car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid-town.

INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Welles is at the wheel.  Longdale is in the passenger seat,

gun held in his lap.

Welles tightens his grip on the wheel, numbed.

EXT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK -- DAY

Welles double parks, puts his hazard lights on.

INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Welles climbs out, heading to the bank...

INT.  BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT -- DAY

Welles and the SAFE DEPOSIT MANAGER enter.  They go to put

their KEYS in one drawer, unlocking it a pulling it out.

Welles pulls the drawer open, takes the 8MM film out and

hands the empty drawer to the manager, exiting.

INT.  BANK -- DAY

Welles comes out from the SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT, pocketing the

film, crossing towards the entrance, looking around...

... at other CUSTOMERS waiting on line...

... at a GUARD with a GUN at his side...

Welles detours, toward one of the LOAN DESKS.  The BANK

EMPLOYEE behind the desk is occupied, on the phone.

As Welles moves past the desk, he grabs a PAIR of SCISSORS

from a pencil holder and palms it, heading to the door...

INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

Welles gets behind the wheel.  Longdale looks at his watch.

Welles puts the car in gear and drives.

Longdale puts the gun to the side of Welles' head.

Welles keeps driving.  Longdale sits back, stewing.

INT.  WAREHOUSE -- DAY

The door is kicked open.  Welles enters, takes the 8MM FILM

out and holds it in his hand.  Longdale follows.

As Welles moves forward, his face goes slack...

Machine is seated on the bed, Eddie and Dino stand smoking

cigarettes, and further on,

Welles runs towards Max, crying out, tears in his eyes...

Machine rises, goes to intercept Welles, grabbing him.

Welles tries to break free, but Machine lifts Welles up and

throws him brutally to the ground.

Welles scrambles to get up...

Eddie comes to KICK Welles in the face.

Welles is sent sprawling, blood gushing from his nose.  He

lays there, stunned, weeping.

Eddie pries the 8MM FILM from Welles' hand, tosses it...

Dino catches the film.

Machine comes to drag Welles towards the bed.

Dino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it.

Machine handcuffs Welles to the metal bedframe.  Welles

falls to his knees, holding his face.

Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the head.

Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the kidney.  Welles tries to protect

himself.  Eddie raises his fist to punch again, but Machine

catches Eddie's fist, throws Eddie back...

Eddie looks up at Machine, who towers over him.

Welles looks up through tears...

Dino drops the 8MM FILM on the floor, takes a small bottle

of lighter fluid from his pocket.  Longdale comes to watch.

Welles watches helpless, agonizing...

Dino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid,

takes out matches, light one, drops it...

The 8MM FILM goes up in flame...

Welles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself

towards the flame, dragging the bed...

The film is destroyed by flame...

Welles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut.

Welles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and

spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet.

He looks to Max's corpse, to the smoldering film...

Swallowing back his fear, panic and rage...

Welles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support.

Welles sits on the bed, eyes burning with fury.

Eddie and Dino look to Longdale.

Longdale's getting very nervous.

Eddie walks towards Longdale...

Longdale takes out his gun, aims it at Machine, Dino and

Eddie, scared...

Eddie slowly takes out his gun, seething.

Eddie puts the gun down, kicks it...

Longdale picks it up, throws it far away.

Machine, Dino and Eddie stand between Longdale and the car

with tinted windows parked across the warehouse...

Welles watches as Machine, Dino and Eddie back slowly away

from Longdale.  Longdale's gun hand is shaky...

Welles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun

and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch...

Longdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio

so he can get to the car...

Machine edges forward, holding his hands in the air.

Longdale brandishes the gun...

Machine, Eddie and Dino are held at bay...

Welles still tries to get to the table, wrist bleeding in

the cuff, bed screeching across the floor...

Machine, hands up, slowly reaches behind his shoulder,

touches the handle of a huge KNIFE sheathed to his back.

Longdale glances towards the car, seems like he's about to

make a run for it.  Dino Velvet takes a step forward...

Machine unsheathes the KNIFE and THROWS...

THUNK!  The knife imbeds to the hilt in Longdale's chest and

Longdale's gun FIRES...

Dino Velvet flies backwards, shot in the face!

Dino hits the ground, screaming, writhing, hands to his

face, blood pouring out between his fingers.

Longdale falls back onto his ass, sitting there, eyes bugged

out in surprise.  He looks down at the knife in his chest.

Machine lets out a SCREAM, runs to Dino...

Machine falls to his knees and grips Dino, tries to hold

him.  Dino's screaming, squirming frantically...

Longdale sits looking down at the knife in his chest, looks

up, and gallons of blood pour from his mouth...

Eddie comes to look down at the Longdale.  Longdale falls

back, dead, blood still flowing from his maw.

Welles drags the heavy bed, getting closer to the table...

Eddie spins, looks across to see Welles struggling...

Dino breaks free from Machine, runs blindly, still holding

his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up...

Eddie runs towards Welles.

Dino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still.

Machine rises, looking at Dino.  Tears come out from

Machine's eyes and roll down his mask.

One last gasp and shudder from Dino's body; death rattle.

Welles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the

socket, desperately clawing towards the table...

The table is mere feet away...

Eddie arrives, KICK Welles in the ribs...

Welles recoils.  Eddies KICKS again.  Welles curls into a

ball.  Eddie KICKS again...

Eddie stops, looks to Machine.

Machine strides over the Longdale's corpse, puts his foot on

Longdale's chest, yanks out the knife...

Machine starts this way...

Eddie backs from Welles.  Welles looks up, trying to shake

off unconsciousness, sees Machine coming...

Welles bows down, on his knees, as if to accept his fate...

Reaching his free hand into his suit pocket...

Machine arrives, knife in hand, lifts Welles' head back by

the hair, brings the knife hand back...

Welles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, STABBING

SCISSORS deep in Machine stomach...

Machine ROARS, falling back, pitching forward...

Machine's knife clatters to the ground.

Eddie's eyes go wide.

Machine hits the floor, clutching his guts.

Welles pushes upwards with all he's got left, turns the iron

bedframe onto its side, flipping the mattress off...

Eddie moves forward, furious...

Welles grabs Machine's knife, wielding it, holding Eddie off.

Welles drags the now lightened bed frame towards the table.

Eddie's sorely tempted, but keeps away.

Eddie turns, looks across the warehouse...

There's his gun, lying there, far away.

Eddie runs for the gun.

Welles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun,

knocks the table over.  He's got the gun, but...

Bullets hit the floor as the table falls.

Welles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand,

gets it open, holds it between his knees...

Welles grabs a bullet...

Eddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air...

Machine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with

trembling hands...

Welles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises,

taking aim across the warehouse...

Eddie's running...

Eddie stops, hands up, about ten feet from his gun...

Machine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach.

Welles points his gun at Machine.

Eddie's looking at his gun, so close, so far away.

Eddie turns, starts walking back...

Machine shakes his head.

Welles looks to see Eddie heading back, keeps the gun on

Machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the

DOOR behind him...

Welles backs away, drags the bedframe.  Eddie's getting

close.  Welles points the gun at Eddie.  Eddie slows.

Welles points the gun at Machine, points the gun at Eddie.

Welles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs, FIRES...

breaks the handcuff chain.

Welles bolts to the door...

Eddie runs back towards his gun.

Machine rises with a grunt of pain, moves towards the door,

but agony doubles him back over to his knees.

Welles' car picks up speed, takes a turn, BURNING RUBBER...

Behind, Eddie curses, runs back to the warehouse.

crying, steers with one hand, holds his bleeding face.

INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Dark.  Welles picks up the cordless phone, struggles to pry

the receiver open.  He discovers another small BUG.

He drops the BUGS to the floor, crushes them under foot.

He puts the phone back together and is replacing it when it

RINGS LOUDLY.  Welles is startled, drops the phone...

Welles takes a breath, trying to shake off the jitters.  He

picks up the RINGING PHONE, answers it...

Welles stiffens.

Welles moves into the HALL, towards the front door...

Welles takes out his gun, opens the front door, looking out.

The street in front of the house is empty.  CRICKETS CHIRP.

her red face as she keeps crying.

Amy comes to take Cindy from him.

Tears comes to Amy's eyes.

Welles goes to Amy, but she pulls away.  She sits on the

bed.  Cindy's still crying.  Welles sits beside Amy, puts

her arms around her.

Amy cradles Cindy.  Welles rests his head on Amy's shoulder,

places one hand on Cindy.

Welles rises.  He goes to the PHONE, starts dialing.  Amy

looks at him, wipes tears.

Welles looks to Amy.

Cindy's crying.  Welles sits into a chair, trying to

understand this, his mind racing.  He hangs up the phone.

find words, but none come.  He sits forward and hides his

face in his hands, overwhelmed.  Cindy's crying.

FOLLOW him up the stairs, into a hallway, past a LAUNDRY

wilderness on all sides.  Welles' car follows a TWO-LANE

ROADWAY that runs along the lake's southern shore.

Welles' car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS.

EXT.  DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT

Heavy forests border close to the road.  Welles' car travels

alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown

gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it.

IN THE CAR

Welles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken

neon and peeled paint: "

Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...

ON THE ROADWAY

Welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes

against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS.

Welles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns

around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...

EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

Welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.

IN THE CAR

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the

abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center

with attached wings of rooms on both sides.

The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out

skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is

boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken.

IN THE LOT

Welles turns out headlights and parks.

He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD.

HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the

forest as the CAR PASSES.

Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.

Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.

INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT

The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge.

Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him.  Welles

pushes Eddie forward, gun out.

Welles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the

room.  There dead leaves all over the floor.  The room's

empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side.

Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light.  This is

where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the

snuff film, without the furniture.

Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on

Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...

The bathroom's cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and

Welles' palely lit face.

Eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.

EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned

motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and

flashlight, into the dense forest...

Welles shoves Eddie ahead.

FURTHER ON

Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...

Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his

flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.

Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.

Eddie's not backing down.

Eddie walks towards Welles.  Welles backs away...

Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.

Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's

forehead, pulls back the hammer...

Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.

Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage

to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...

INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT

Eddie's thrown face down to the floor.  Welles comes to sit

on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun,

takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them...

Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape,

till Eddie's securely bound.

He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out...

EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.

IN THE CAR

Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his

wit's end.  He opens the glove compartment, finds

cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.

He looks back to the motel room.

He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR

PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at

it in his hand.

IN THE LOT

Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,

staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes.

Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.

He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,

pages through, studies one page.

Welles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,

dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...

Welles climbs off the car, paces, aching with misery...

Tears comes to Welles' eyes.  It's the hardest thing he's

ever had to do in his entire life.

MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB.

Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...

Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the

ground, utterly drained.  He puts his forearm over his eyes,

gasping, sucking air...

He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing

it to fuel his rage...

He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the

gun and pours the bullets out.  He closes the gun and walks

towards the motel room...

INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Welles SHOVES the door aside.  The door's hinge breaks and

the door falls...

Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...

The door SLAMS to the floor.

Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his

arm with the gun grasped by the butt...

Eddie's eyes go wide with fear...

Welles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie's head...

EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST.  CRICKETS and

distant BIRDS.  We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS

through the open door of the room.  A CAR is HEARD, getting

LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.

Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying

himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered

red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.

Welles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and

goes to his car...

IN THE CAR

Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun

into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his

shirt, revolted.  He starts the car.

INT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Welles enters and crosses through...

INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Welles goes to the kitchen sink, turns on the water, starts

scrubbing his bloody hands, using dishwashing liquid,

scrubbing his hands desperately under running water.

EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT

Welles comes out of the house, goes to open the rear door of

Eddie's car, looking through BOXES of Eddie's belongings...

INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Welles comes up the stairs with a BOX, dumps the contents

onto the living room floor: it's CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, Eddie's

collection from the office, HUNDREDS of PHOTOS...

INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Welles pulls open Eddie's cabinets, searching.  He finds

POTS and PANS, choosing a few of the largest...

EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT

Welles uses a cut piece of GARDEN HOSE, siphoning GAS out

from Eddie's car, filling several kitchen POTS...

INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Welles comes up the stairs, carries POTS of gasoline, dumps

the gasoline onto the pile of PHOTOGRAPHS...

INT.  EDDIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Welles dumps gasoline over Eddie's bed...

INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Welles stands at the pile of gasoline soaked photos, taking

out a MATCHBOOK, lighting one, lighting the whole book...

EXT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Welles walks down the dark hill, heading to his car.  He

gets in, starts the car and drives downhill, leaving the

headlights off.  BEHIND, the windows of Eddie's ramshackle

HOUSE grow bright as FIRE SPREADS and CURTAINS BURN.

INT.  LOS ANGELES AIRPORT -- NIGHT

Welles stares ahead, in fresh shirt and suit, waiting at a

CHECK-IN COUNTER.

The female AIRLINE AGENT behind the counter types in her

COMPUTER, stamps his ticket.

Welles shifts his gaze, something catches his eye...

Beside a stapler on the counter, a PAIR of SCISSORS.

Welles stares, fixated on the SCISSORS.

Welles looks to the agent holding up the ticket.

Welles accepts the ticket.

EXT.  MANHATTAN MOTEL -- NIGHT

The Empire State Building in the distance says NYC, and a

CAMERA PAN DOWN says another seedy MOTEL...

INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

Welles sits at a small desk, looking through a PHONE BOOK,

white pages, finds... "

Welles picks up the PHONE, chooses a number, dials it...

Welles hangs up, uses a pen to cross out a number in the

phone book, starts dialing the next number.

INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

Welles lies on the bed, on the phone, rubbing his eyes.

Welles gets up, hangs up, brings the phone back to the desk.

INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

The PHONE BOOK'S open on the desk with nearly a hundred

hospital phone numbers crossed out.

Light cuts into the room from between the curtains.  Welles

paces, carrying the phone with him, weary.

Welles stops in his track, listening, suddenly attentive.

Welles goes to the desk, takes out his notepad.  He starts

feeling his pockets for his pen, can't find it, telephone

book, searching, looks under the desk...

Welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor.

Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.

EXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAY

A relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two

story affairs, close together, each very much like its

neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.

Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in

school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.

Welles parallel parks.

IN THE CAR

Welles turns off the engine.

He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The

house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,

quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a

GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.

Cars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children

pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his

seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side

mirror, rolling up the window.

Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,

pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG

off the passenger seat and opens it.

He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink

wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.

Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles

slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along

the gun's inner barrel.

INT.  WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY

Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house.

He looks in his side mirror...

There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn

signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower.

The car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint

house begins to open.

Welles watches...

Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back

of his head, but he's huge.  It's a good bet it's Machine.

Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.

The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's

garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the

garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the

sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.

Welles watches.

The old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside.

The garage door closes behind her.

INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT

Welles still watches the house.  There's a light on in one

of the second floor windows, curtains closed.

Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.

At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture

window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old

woman comes to sit at a table.

Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...

THROUGH BINOCULARS

The old woman says something to someone we cannot see.

She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of

her.  After a moment, someone joins her...

It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge

forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our

view, so we never see his face.

IN THE CAR

Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.

Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen

putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old

woman smiles up at him, says something.

Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,

then goes back to stand beside the old woman.

Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a

kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman

starts to eat.

INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

Dawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep,

slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.

Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He

calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.

ACROSS THE STREET

The quaint house's garage door begins to rise.

IN THE CAR

Welles sees this, keeps low, watching...

The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman's

behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.

Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.

ON THE STREET

Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind

him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all

directions, making sure no one's around.

Ahead, the garage door begins to close.

Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too

conspicuous.  The garage door's halfway down...

Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get

there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.

ABOVE

In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out

from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.

INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY

Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off.

The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves

towards the door to the house.

INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

Machine, in T-shirt and jeans,

to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push

clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer,

taking out the WRESTLING MASK.

Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.

INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY

Welles enters from the garage, gun up.  The dank basement is

small.  A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING

MACHINE.

SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two

metal poles.  Welles leads with his gun...

He moves around the sheets, looking behind them.  There's a

WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs.  Welles starts up,

treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...

INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY

Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his

gun.  No one here.  The decor is feminine, neat and tidy.

It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT

WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL

FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES.  Very Home Shopping Network.

INT.  DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the

kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun.  No sign of

Machine.  The whole house is dead quiet.

He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old

woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls,

of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into

the living room area...

Yellow shag CARPET.  A pink SOFA is covered in clear

plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet.

Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.

Welles creeps up the stairs...

INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR.

He opens the door.  It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and

SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.

Welles shuts the door and moves on.  There are TWO DOORS

ahead, both closed.  Welles takes the one to the right...

INT.  MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

Welles pushes the door in, enters warily.  There's a

constant SCRATCHING HEARD.  The room is like a child's,

except the BED is huge.  Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and

COMIC BOOKS.  A DANZIG POSTER on the wall.  There's a RECORD

PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it.  A record turns on the

turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...

Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...

Pulls it open, steps back, gun up.  Nothing.  Just clothing.

INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...

DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the

stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.

INT.  GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAY

Welles stays near the door, looks around.  There's a fuzzy

sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby.

Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.

Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...

INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

Welles turns...

Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE

KNIFE raised to kill...

Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing...

Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife.  Machine

grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back...

Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand

pinned.  Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...

BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling.  Machine's grunts, pushing the

knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...

Welles struggles, overpowered.  The tip of the horrible

knife is inches away...

Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance

from the blade...

Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the

swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins

twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...

Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...

Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun

towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face...

The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek...

Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY,

FIRES his gun...

The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away!

Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free

hand to Welles' throat, choking him.  Welles' face reddens,

bleeding from bullet fragments...

Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat.

Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed

effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute...

SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN...

The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute.

Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles'

throat.  Welles can't break the grip...

Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the

mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect...

Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach!

Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already

wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...

Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping.  He struggles

to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...

Machine rises, charging after...

ON THE STAIRCASE

Welles is TACKLED from behind...

Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the

wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...

Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the

living room.  Machine rises to give chase...

Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it...

Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming.  Welles grips

another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...

Machine grips the chair by the legs.  Welles SHOVES forward,

pushes Machine back, letting go...

Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands

and knees, scrambling...

Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps...

Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING

down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...

Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises,

extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...

Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...

Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up...

Machine gets to his feet...

IN THE KITCHEN

Welles SHOVES through the swinging door...

Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...

Welles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins

to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...

Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...

Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...

Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen

sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.

Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the

counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor...

Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...

Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground,

tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up...

Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...

Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets

him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles

airway with his forearm...

Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one

hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand...

frantically feeling for anything he can use...

Welles' face is blood red...

Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...

Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh!

Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching

around to the fork...

Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...

Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling

fingers.  Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR.

Welles gets to his feet, looking...

He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both

hands and moving towards Machine...

Machine's getting up...

Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of

the frying pan...

Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven!

Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door...

IN THE BASEMENT

Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the

bottom, barely has any strength left.  He looks all

directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling...

Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of

dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching

desperately, throwing clothing aside...

Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess...

Welles searches the laundry pile...

Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for

Welles.  Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE...

HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking

Machine a few steps backwards...

Welles FIRES...

Machine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging

laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets...

Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets.

Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an

empty chamber.  Out of bullets.

Machine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get

back up to his feet.  Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun,

walking to Machine...

Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line

in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat...

Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight...

Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord.  Welles

stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back,

pulling the clothes line with all his might...

The cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood.

Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling,

struggling... till he finally stops moving.

Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard,

trembling.  He looks around the basement.

Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his

holster.  He stands looking at Machine.

Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling

mask, pulling it off.  He rolls Machine over...

Welles stares down at Machine.

INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY

Welles comes up from the basement, slow, hurting.  He looks

around at the damage done, looks down to see he's still

holding Machine's mask.  He drops it.

EXT.  QUAINT HOUSE -- DAY

Welles crosses the street, going to his car.  He gets into

his car, starts it, pulls out and drives away.

EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- DAY

BIRDS SING.  KIDS are kicking around a soccer ball down the

street.  Welles' Ford arrives, pulls into the driveway.

INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY

Welles comes in the front door, still a horrible mess.

He waits.  The house is quiet.  No one home.

EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- LATER DAY

Dusk.  A CAR comes down the street, slows...

IN THE CAR

Amy sits forward, seeing Welles' car in the driveway.

Cindy's in a child safety seat in back.

INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY

Amy comes in the front door, carrying Amy.

No answer.

INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

Any pushes the bedroom door open and looks in.  Welles is

asleep on the bed, still in his clothing and shoes.  Amy

watches him sleep, sad.

Amy backs out of the room, pulls the door shut.

INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Dark.  Welles sleeps, still in bloody clothing.  He's

restless, shifting, MUTTERING under his breath.  Bad dreams.

Welles suddenly sits bolt upright in the bed, looking around

the dark room, breathing hard.

INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Cindy's in her high-chair by the table.  Amy's at the

KITCHEN SINK, washing vegetables, peeling potatoes.

Welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her.  Amy turns

to look at him.  It breaks her heart to see him so wounded,

but she forces herself to continue working in the sink.

Welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside Cindy, puts his

hand out and clasp's Cindy's tiny hand.

Amy keeps peeling potatoes, refuses to look at him.  Welles

looks down at Cindy, pats Cindy's head, looks back at Amy.

He stands looking at Amy for a long moment.

EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY

Welles wears his fishing cap, pushing his lawn mower, mowing

his yard.  He has done some healing, though his face is

still swollen and terribly bruised.

INT.  KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Welles feeds Cindy with one hand, eating his own dinner with

the other.  Amy's across the table, eating, watching them.

INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY

Welles works on the WATER HEATER, wrench in hand, reading an

instruction sheet.  He puts the sheet aside, uses the wrench

to begin loosening one of the pipe fittings.

EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- NIGHT

Welles drags two GARBAGE CANS from the garage to the street,

leaving them by the mailbox, walking back to the house.

INT.  BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Welles and Amy are in bed.  Amy's asleep, on her side,

facing away from Welles.  Welles lays awake, on his back,

staring up at the ceiling.

INT.  SUPERMARKET AISLE -- DAY

Welles pushes a cart down one aisle.  He looks at his LIST,

takes a BOX of CEREAL off one shelf, puts it in the cart.

INT.  SUPERMARKET CHECK-OUT -- DAY

Welles waits in line with his cart.  It's a long line.

He takes out his wallet, opens it.

In the fold of the wallet, there's a PHOTO folded into

quarters.  Welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully.

It's the PHOTO of Mary Anne Mathews, the image Welles

printed from early in the snuff film.  Sad girl.

Welles folds in back up, puts it in another pocket.  He

looks forward in the line to see if it's moving.

EXT.  SUPERMARKET -- DAY

Welles transfers BAGS of GROCERIES from the shopping cart

into the back seat of his Ford.

INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY

Welles drives on the HIGHWAY, groceries in back.  He watches

the roadway ahead.  There's little traffic.

Welles glances down, turns on the RADIO.  Some CLASSICAL

MUSIC PLAYS.  Welles stares forward through the windshield.

After a moment, Welles turns the RADIO OFF.  He drives.  The

ONLY SOUND is the DRONE of the ENGINE and TIRES.

Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with

tears.  He tries to fight it, but can't help himself.  His

face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting

out a loud WAIL of misery...

EXT.  HIGHWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

Welles' car moves to the shoulder, brakes to a sudden HALT.

INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

Welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and

over again, wiping at his tears.  He lets out a little high-

pitched WHINE from far back in his throat...

He's wracked by SOBBING.

INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, CINDY'S ROOM -- DAY

Amy's in a chair, reading a BOOK, not far from Cindy's crib.

Cindy's asleep.  The FRONT DOOR of the house is HEARD

OPENING and CLOSING from far off in the house.  Amy looks up

momentarily, then returns to reading.

FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming through the house, getting

CLOSER.  Amy looks up from her book.  The bedroom door's

open a crack.  The door slowly pushes open.  Welles stands

there, eyes red from crying.

Welles comes into the room, stands before Amy.  He gets to

his knees, puts his head in Amy's lap, wraps his arms around

her waist.  Amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears.

Amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest

her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed.

Welles holds tighter.
