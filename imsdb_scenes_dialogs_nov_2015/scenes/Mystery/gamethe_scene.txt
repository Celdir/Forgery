A1. TITLES OVER "HOME MOVIES" from the 1960's -- FLICKERING, GRAINY,

HAND-HELD, KODACHROME COLORS.  MUSIC OVER.

1.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (HOME MOVIES)

A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BIRTHDAY BOY with a blindfold spins round and

round, the HANDS of OTHER CHILDREN keep him spinning.  MAIN TITLE.

It's a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.  The dizzy boy is given

a strip of felt, and the CAMERA follows as he stumbles toward a

large cardboard donkey.  He pins the tail on its nose.

2. QUICK, RAGGED CUTS-- the BOY blows out candles... opens gifts...

a CLOWN ties balloon animals.  CHILDREN, MAIDS and BUTLERS hover

about; there's even a real-live PONY.  The party take splace in the

gardens of a massive Pacific Heights MANSION.

3. THE BOY is SCHUYLER VAN ORTON (7), and this is his birthday

party.  He's a serious-looking child, who adjusts his glasses as he

poses for a shot with his mother, MRS. VAN ORTON, a stiff-looking

society matron.  A NANNY brings over an INFANT and gently places

the baby in Schuyler's arms.  Schuyler is ultra-careful, over-

whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny BROTHER (DAVID).

4. THE BOY and the other children sit spellbound, watching a magic

show in the front GARDEN-- a MAGICIAN waves a colored handkerchief,

a DOVE FLIES OUT.  CAMERA FOLLOWS the bird UP toward the house...

5. THE CAMERA FINDS MR. VAN ORTON, a pinched, depressive man of

about 40, wearing glasses.  He stands on a high balcony at the top

story of the mansion, in a bathrobe, smoking a cigarette.  The

unseen photographer ZOOMS IN jerkily on the man.  When he realizes

he's being photographed, Mr. Van Orton turns his back and goes

inside the house.  The film SOLARIZES and runs into LEADER--

6.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (PRESENT DAY)

TITLES CONTINUE.  Early morning, the same mansion (ideally an

ornate Victorian or Arts & Crafts).  The landscaping has changed,

there are some modern touches, such as an iron gate surrounding the

carriageway, a black 500-class MERCEDES in the drive.

MUSIC DOWN, SEGUE to a CNN NEWS BROADCAST OVER as the CAMERA MOVES

IN ON THE UPPER BALCONY where we'd seen Mr. Van Orton earlier...

it's now COVERED and GLASSED-IN.  We move THROUGH THE GLASS...

7.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B E D R O O M  -  D A Y

TRACK THROUGH a large master bedroom; neat, masculine and Spartan,

free weights, a treadmill.  Atop the bed a LAPTOP COMPUTER runs

STOCK QUOTES.  A LARGE-SCREEN TV plays UNWATCHED, a familiar CNN

ANCHOR (we'll assume BERNARD SHAW).  The Bang & Olufsen CLOCK RADIO

CLICKS ON, 6:30 am; CLASSICAL MUSIC now DUELS with the TV report.

HAND-ANNOTATED PAPERWORK and STOCK READOUTS cover a NIGHT TABLE,

where the ringing multi-line TELEPHONE JOINS the cacophony.

END TITLES as we MOVE TOWARD a DOOR, it's open a crack-- from this

adjacent bath we hear the SOUND OF A SHOWER RUNNING...

8.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B A T H R O O M  -  D A Y

In the steam-filled bathroom, we make out SCHUYLER VAN ORTON, now

38.  He's handsome, fit and apparently in complete control of his

world.  He steps out of the shower, wraps a towel around himself

and grabs the BATHROOM PHONE.

As he speaks, he continues his morning ritual-- hair combing, Q-

tips, etc.  (Schuyler is a man in almost constant motion.)

9.  E X T.   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T S  -  D A Y

The black Mercedes moves quickly through morning traffic.

10.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  D A Y

SCHUYLER is on his car phone, NEWS RADIO LOW in BG, maneuvering

aggressively through traffic.  His laptop RUNS in the passenger

seat, its cellular antenna up.

He hangs up and HONKS at another driver, displaying no emotion.

11.  I N T .   V A N   O R T O N   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y

TRACK WITH SCHUYLER through an elegant suite of offices.  He passes

a discreet sign: "THE VAN ORTON GROUP."  Schuyler is on a cell-

phone, carrying the laptop, trailed by MARIA, his middle-aged

secretary.  She bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention.

As Schuyler walks, he's GREETED by passing UNDERLINGS, whom he

ignores.  He SHUTS OFF the phone, Maria hands him a couple of

items, follows him into his office.

12.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  D A Y

The office is large, tasteful, reeks of old money.  A window

overlooks the San Francisco skyline and the Bay.

SCHUYLER FREEZES at this, stares at her.

Maria hands him a slip of paper, lingers, awaiting explanation...

She heads out quickly.  Schuyler stares at the slip, then turns to

look out the window, lost in thought.

13.  I N T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y

A working class bar, an ALCOHOLIC or two, pinball machines.

SCHUYLER sits a table near a window, checking his watch, it's not

his kind of place.  A WAITRESS arrives in a too-small uniform--

young, multiple earrings, CHRISTINE according to her name tag.

She hands him a menu and starts off.  Schuyler calls after her.

She waves a hand, "yeah, right," without looking back.  Schuyler

sighs and opens the menu.  Suddenly, someone BACKHANDS the side of

his skull, he assumes a defensive posture.  Schuyler sees his

LAUGHING brother:  DAVID VAN ORTON.

DAVID slides into the seat opposite him.  He's in his early 30's,

good-looking but unkempt, wears bright, funky clothes, an earring

and a perpetual grin.  There's an intense, edgy quality to him

which Schuyler has some trouble readjusting to.

Schuyler's unamused by the memory.  David grins and pulls a small

envelope out of his pocket, tosses it on the table in front of him.

Schuyler shrugs, opens the envelope and shakes out--

A BUSINESS CARD in BLUE and ORANGE:  "CONSUMER RECREATION SERVICES."

The C, R and S are HIGHLIGHTED, a PHONE NUMBER at the bottom.

SCHUYLER picks up the card, fingers it.

Schuyler gives him a bored, blank look.  David throws up his hands.

Christine the waitress has shown up with Schuyler's iced tea.  She

puts it down hastily, spilling some across the table.  Schuyler

shies away, grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip

into his lap.  Cracking gum:

She moves off as Schuyler tries to order, raising a finger--

David slumps in his seat, won't meet Schuyler's eyes.

David glares at him.  With the impeccable timing of all waitresses,

CHRISTINE appears, chipper.

She curls her lip and departs before Schuyler can open his mouth.

He sighs, resigned to the idea of not eating.  Calmly:

David WINKS, puts a finger to his lips-- not another word.

CLOSE as Schuyler slips the brightly-colored CARD into his pocket.

14.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   O F F I C E   B U I L D I N G  -  N I G H T

ESTABLISH the moonlit exterior of an older, classy building in

downtown San Francisco.  MOVE IN on a high window, one of the few

LIT at this hour.  We hear the SOUND OF A PHONE CHIRPING OVER.

lS.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T

COMPUTERS run, stacks of PAPERWORK, etc. PHONE continues to RING.

FIND SCHUYLER as he punches the SPEAKER:

ELIZABETH is Schuyler's ex-wife-- an earnest woman, a stranger to

subtlety.  STAY WITH SCHUYLER, who half-smiles, looks at his watch.

She has the concerned, forthright tone of a "recovery person,"

someone who's been through a lot of therapy and wants to reach out.

Schuyler GRIMACES, then mimics the tone:

SCHUYLER hates this question.  He quickly changes the subject.

He PUNCHES off the phone in the middle of her "Good-bye."  Schuyler

returns to his work, as if the call hadn't taken place-- but a few

seconds later, we see his concentration is completely shattered, he

leans back in his SQUEAKING deskchair.

16.  E X T .   P A C I F I C   H E I G H T S  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER'S MERCEDES cruises on the hilly streets, past impressive

mansions on all sides, a CRESCENT MOON overhead.

17.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  N I G H T

CLASSICAL MUSIC plays.  SCHUYLER drives, looking unsettled.

18.  E X T .   P A C I F I C   H E I G H T S  -  D A Y  (60'S/FLASHBACK)

POV DRIVING SHOT, from the backset of a LIMOUSINE.  PERIOD CARS,

FASHIONS, etc.  MUSIC CONTINUES OVER.

19.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER changes the RADIO STATION, trying to drown out his

thoughts with LOUD ROCK AND ROLL.

20.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T

THE ELECTRIC GATE slides open, and Schuyler's Benz pulls in.

21.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (FLASHBACK)

A LIMOUSINE pulls into the ungated carriageway.  THE BACK DOOR

OPENS and SCHUYLER (7) emerges from the backseat, carrying

elementary schoolbooks.  As he approaches the front steps, he looks

upward at something, blinks and squints.

ANGLE UP-- MR. VAN ORTON, in his robe, stands on the balcony

railing, looking up at the sky.  He turns his gaze slowly downward.

YOUNG SCHUYLER is puzzled, gives his dad a tentative wave.

MR. VAN ORTON waves back, his eyes dead, expression blank.

YOUNG SCHUYLER opens his mouth to call to his father-- instead we

hear an URGENT ELECTRONIC BEEPING--

22.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   K I T C H E N  -  N I G H T

A MICROWAVE OVEN BEEPS that the meal is "READY."  SCHUYLER opens

the door, takes out his upscale junk food, grabs a fork.

23.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   D E N  -  N I G H T

ON A BIG-SCREEN TV, a CNN NEWSCAST shows a FIRE OUT OF CONTROL.

MOVE FROM THIS through the manly, book-lined den.  The house is

traditional, opulent, densely decorated with "good pieces"-- and it

feels like a mausoleum.

FIND SCHUYLER peeling open the plastic food container.  He sits in

a leather armchair.  A BOTTLE OF DOM PERIGNON sits on the coffee

table, near a champagne flute glass, a CUPCAKE with a CANDLE in it.

The LAPTOP computer is RUNNING.

ON TV, BERNARD SHAW comes out of the story.

SCHUYLER raises his champagne glass to the TV, his birthday done.

Then he toasts in the direction of a FRAMED PICTURE on the coffee

table-- a WEDDING PHOTO OF SCHUYLER and ELIZABETH.

SCHUYLER reaches for the REMOTE CONTROL.  He settles back on the

sofa, CHANNEL HOPPING.  He despairs of this quickly, points the

remote at his own head-- CLICK, CLICK.  He closes his eyes.

24.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (FLASHBACK)

MR. VAN ORTON stands on the edge of the balcony, waving as before.

He looks skyward one last time, then suddenly LAUNCHES HIMSELF INTO

SPACE in a head-first dive.  We hear what sounds like a SCREAM--

25.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G   -  D A Y

--it's a CAR HORN.  The vehicle passes to reveal SCHUYLER striding

toward a postmodern building in the financial district; a ramp

leads to a parking garage beneath.  Casually dressed, he glances up

at the facade for a few moments, then goes in.

26.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y   A N D   A T R I U M   -  D A Y

The very new, dramatic structure is built around a central twelve-

story atrium narrowing to a SKYLIGHT above.  There's still some

minor construction underway on the ground floor, scaffolding about.

Schuyler crosses to a bank of lobby elevators.

27.  I N T .   C R S   E L E V A T O R  -  D A Y

Schuyler looks out the glass elevator as it rises vertiginously.

HIS POV as the atrium shrinks below him.

28.  I N T .   C R S   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y

Partitioned work areas, terminals, clutter and disarray.  Office

doors open off a reception area.  CRS EMPLOYEES move about

hectically.  Schuyler enters, wanders about for a moment, confused.

A friendly female RECEPTIONIST glances up from her desk.

The woman flips through an appointment book with a logo, CRS.  IN

BG, JIM FEINGOLD pays a CHINESE DELIVERY GUY for a BAG OF FOOD.

The woman shakes her head.  FEINGOLD slows as he crosses past

Schuyler, carrying the bag.  He's 30-40, a no-nonsense engineer,

looks a bit dull, but he exudes competence and trustworthiness.

Feingold glances at Schuyler, shrugs.

The man leads Schuyler to a row of open boxes on the floor, looks

in a couple, then finds what he's after.  He snatches up a couple

of pages, hands them to Schuyler.  Then he finds a clipboard on the

floor, tosses it to him like a frisbee.

He reaches into a box of PENS, passes one to Schuyler.

CLOSE ON PEN-- the CRS LOGO.

29.  I N T .   F E I N G O L D ' S   O F F I C E / H A L L W A Y  -  D A Y

A modern, dramatic office.  Swoopy furniture, imposing ART, all

very cool-looking.  Feingold moves behind the desk, unpacks a

couple of white cartons.

SCHUYLER sits on a couch, looking at the forms.

The fast-talking Feingold moves energetically through the office,

occasionally picking at his food or poking at the air with

chopsticks-- he's a bit hyper and fidgety in general.

Feingold sits on the edge of his desk, arms crossed, nodding and

smiling condescendingly-- he raises a hand to stop Schuyler.

Feingold cocks his head, reappraising him.  Then, with a smile, he

calls to an attractive young WOMAN passing in the hall; Schuyler,

meanwhile, flips through the pages of the tests.

As she leads Schuyler out the door, Feingold WINKS at him.

Schuyler reacts-- a physical?  He throws up a hand and follows the

woman into the hall.  Alone now, Feingold cracks a fortune cookie

and glances at the slip of paper inside.  He furrows his brow with

concern at the fortune-- then tosses it aside.

30. CRS OFFICES - SERIES OF SHOTS

During the following QUICK CUTS, SOUNDS will be layered in and

CONTINUE over one another, e. g. the SOUND of a scraping pencil,

the BLIPS of machinery, HEAVY BREATHING, MURMURING VOICES of

TECHNICIANS giving instructions...

A. X-CLOSE:  A #2 pencil FILLS IN box after box on a long MMPI

form.  CLOSE on a couple of these:  "I sometimes hurt animals... I

feel guilty when I masturbate..." each followed by TRUE and FALSE

boxes.

B. A WHITE-WALLED ROOM:  Schuyler concentrates on a drawing held by

a stone-faced PSYCHOLOGIST, a TAT test; he laughs as he speaks into

a tape-recorder, analyzing the pictures.

C. X-CLOSE:  The DRAWING, a large ant with an apron feeding a TV

dinner to a human child.  The card moves just as we register it to

reveal another DRAWING of a smiling man toppling backwards in a

chair, perched on the edge of a cliff.

D. A LAB:  Electronic MONITORS and PRINTERS record Schuyler's EEG

and EKG.  We see him on a doctor's table, wearing a medical gown

with the CRS logo.  He's hooked up to the wires, a female

TECHNICIAN studying the readouts while a NURSE takes his blood

pressure.

E. X-CLOSE:  The traveling trace of intersecting colored waves.

F. A DARKENED ROOM:  Schuyler in FG, still in the gown, watches a

screen as images FLASH-- geometric SHAPES, WORDS, PHOTOS.  His

finger hovers over a bank of three buttons, he presses different

ones from time to time.  There's a MIRROR to one side of the room--

G. X-CLOSE:  A COMPUTER SCREEN shows green columns of NUMBERS--

SCHUYLER'S NAME is steady at the top of the screen, with an account

number.  CAMERA MOVES FROM THE SCREEN to show an unseen COMPUTER

OPERATOR watching Schuyler through the one-way glass.

The CACOPHONY of the MONTAGE ends abruptly as we CUT TO:

31.  I N T .   C U B I C L E  -  N I G H T

Schuyler, in the gown, sits on an examination table with his hands

in his lap in a small, featureless cubicle-- he seems vulnerable,

looks around blankly.  To himself, irritated and bemused:

FEINGOLD BURSTS IN, a slew of COMPUTER PRINT-OUTS under his arm.

He throws open a closet door.  Schuyler reaches inside for his

clothes, which are neatly folded and on hangers.  Feingold turns

his back on him as he DRESSES, perching on the examination table

and studying the unburst print-outs.

He heads out, beckons for Schuyler to follow.

32.  I N T .   C R S   M A I N   F L O O R  -  N I G H T

Feingold leads him through the office-- SECRETARIES and other

WORKERS pack up at the end of the day.

Feingold smiles tightly and leads Schuyler back into his office.

33.  I N T .   F E I N G O L D ' S   O F F I C E  -  D A Y

CLOSE ON PAPERWORK as it's dropped on the desktop.

SCHUYLER, CRS pen in hand, looks at this dubiously.

Schuyler CLICKS the ballpoint pen, they both lean over the papers.

Schuyler's about to sign when Feingold grabs his wrist.

CLOSE, as Schuyler SIGNS on the dotted line.

FEINGOLD snatches up the forms, suddenly seems in a hurry for

Schuyler to go.

Schuyler shrugs, sticks it in his breast pocket, starts out.

Feingold gently shuts the door on schuyler's face.

S C E N E   3 4   D E L E T E D

35(NEW).  I N T .   R A C Q U E T B A L L   C O U R T / C O R R I D O R  -  D A Y

WHAM, a BALL SLAMS against a wall.

THROUGH A WINDOW, we see SCHUYLER playing violently, pumping

sweat... he's alone.  We hear the sound of a PHONE CALL OVER:

Fed up with playing alone, Schuyler lets the ball bounce, exits the

court and heads for a LOCKER ROOM down the hall...

S C E N E   3 6   D E L E T E D

37(NEW).  E X T .   C O U N T R Y   C L U B   B A R  -  D A Y

SCHUYLER, in casual clothes, hair still wet from a shower, comes

out of a locker room area toward an outdoor BAR by a SWIMMING POOL

at this upscale country ciub.  He passes PETE and JOHN, two middle-

aged RICH MEN sitting at a table near the bar; he overhears a

snippet of their conversation--

Schuyler slows down, eavesdropping, then moves toward the bar,

addresses the BARTENDER with a nod toward John and Pete.

Schuyler moves casually toward the men--

38(N). SAME LOCATION, LATER, the bartender brings another round of

drinks to the table, Schuyler and the men have been chatting a

while, all seem relaxed.  Pete, the friendlier (drunker) of the

two, puffs a CIGAR as he speaks:

The others CHUCKLE knowingly.  Schuyler sips his drink, blinking

and coughing discretely at the smoke; there's a slight pause.

He slides off his stool.  Pete studies Schuyler, sizing him up.

Schuyler raises his glass, numbed by this outpouring.  Pete drains

his drink, chuckling to himself.  His friend comes back, looking

concerned, takes the man's arm.

Schuyler stares after the two men dubiously as they move off.

39.  I N T .   L A W   F I R M   C O N F E R E N C E   R O O M  -  D A Y

A slick, designery conference room, filled with BABBLING LAWYERS--

at the head of the table stands BOB PLYMPTON, a trustworthy man in

his late 50's.  MURMURING CONTINUES during Plympton's address.

Schuyler has been going through paperwork in the back of the room,

he steps forward during the above.

THWAP!  Schuyler DROPS the stack of papers on the table, SILENCE.

CHIRP.  Schuyler's CELL-PHONE has started RINGING during the above.

He finally removes it from his pocket and moves to a quiet corner.

QUIET COMMOTION resumes IN BG during the following.  On the other

end of the line, there's the bland, bureaucratic VOICE of CYNTHIA:

CLICK and a DIAL TONE.  Schuyler shuts the phone and replaces it in

his pocket, his mind suddenly far away from the meeting at hand.

PLYMPTON, a wel1-meaning man with a fatherly attitude toward

Schuyler, steps close to him and speaks quietly, concerned:

40.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER pulls up in his MBZ, the electric gate glides shut.  He

gets out of the car and SETS THE ALARM.  He heads for the front

steps of his home-- then freezes, blinks--

ON HIS DOORSTEP lies a body, face-down, apparently a WINO, in a

tattered, filthy overcoat.

41.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (FLASHBACK)

SAME ANGLE, QUICK SHOT of the body of MR. VAN ORTON, sprawled

across the steps in much the same position as the wino, flat on his

stomach, head twisted at a grotesque angle.  His bathrobe is even

similar in color to the wino's overcoac.

42.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER shakes off the memory, looking alarmed.  He calls out:

THE BODY doesn't stir.  He approaches gingerly.

He crouches by the wino, winces at a strong smell, covers his nose.

He reaches out to touch the body, but hesitates, pulls back.  Alive

or dead, he doesn't want to have anything to do with this person.

The "wino" suddenly SPRINGS UP like a jack-in-the-box, bending

backwards impossibly at the hips.  Schuyler lets out a CRY and

scrambles back toward his car.

THE HEAD swivels to face him-- it's a grotesque HARLEQUIN, its head

made of COLORED GLASS, LIT from within.  The MOUTH DROPS OPEN and a

tongue in the shape of a corkscrew SPRINGS OUT.

A SMALL KEY ON A HOOK dangles from the tip of the tongue.  One of

the harlequin's glass eyes WINKS.

SCHUYLER stares in amazement for a few moments.

CLOSE on the dangling KEY as Schuyler fingers it.  The key catches

the light and we see the letters "CRS" embossed on it.

42B(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   F O Y E R  -  N I G H T

THE DUMMY is dumped in a straight-back chair in the foyer.

SCHUYLER takes a step back and studies it.  He crosses its legs,

smirks and shakes his head, ascending the stairs.

CLOSE ON the disturbing empty stare of the DUMMY...

43.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   B A T H R O O M / B E D R O O M  -  N I G H T

CLOSE ON SCHUYLER'S EYE as he blinks and removes a CONTACT LENS.  A

NEWSCAST is barely audible in BG.

WIDER, Schuyler, squinting, in a bathrobe, enters from the bathroom

off the bedroom, putting his contact lens case into a toiletries

case.  He's been packing a leather GARMENT BAG, which hangs from a

door, slips the toiletries into a "side pouch.  The TV PLAYS in BG,

Bernard Shaw delivering the news.

This gets Schuyler's attention, he squints toward the television.

SCHUYLER scrambles for his glasses, as Shaw struggles to continue.

SCHUYLER sits on the bed, breathes hard, stares at the tube.

SCHUYLER is freaking out, paces frantically, moves toward a phone--

who's he going to call?  He makes a low MOAN.

SHAW'S voice CRACKS, he speaks very rapidly.

SCHUYLER starts moving out of the room--

SCHUYLER doubles back, avoiding a window, his panic mounting--

SCHUYLER looks around, sees no such appropriate spot in the room.

SCHUYLER blinks, hesitates starts to move toward the doar--

SCHUYLER, confused, crouches as instructed--

On this last line, Shaw's voice starts to ECHO and CHANGE.

SCHUYLER rises, staring at the TV, mouth agape.

SHAW WINKS.  His VOICE is utterly transformed.

HIS FACE RIPPLES and MORPHS into a SKULL, it's becoming clear that

this is a computer-generated Bernard shaw.

As CYBERSHAW speaks, his face will continue to transform, sometimes

back to a recognizable human state, other times into abstract

images, a talking piano, a dog, etc.

The combination of relief, amazement and anger is a bit much for

Schuyler to absorb.  Smiling sickly:

As he speaks, Schuyler reaches for the gold key on his bedside

table.  He starts putting it onto his keychain.

ON TV SCREEN-- below CyberShaw, a PHONE NUMBER SCROLLS PAST.

SCHUYLER has snatched up the CRS pen to write down the number-- it

doesn't work.  SWEARING, he tosses it aside, grabs another.

ON TV, CyberShaw MORPHS back into the original Bernard Shaw.

There's a quick VISUAL GLITCH on the tube as the original TV feed

resumes-- Bernard Shaw is delivering a normal news story.

SCHUYLER is taken with the display of electronic pyrotechnics, in

spite of himself.  He hits the speaker button on his phone, dials.

A DIAL TONE, CRS doesn't take messages.  Schuyler sighs, HANGS UP.

44.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER crouches by a coaxial cable line emerging from the side of

the house.  He fingers a box with a miniature LOOP and RABBIT EAR

ANTENNA that's been spliced into the line with a tiny S-shaped

WIRE.  He starts to unscrew it, then thinks twice, heads back in.

WIDER, as Schuyler enters his mansion, a GIBBOUS MOON OVERHEAD.

45.  E X T .   S E A - T A C   A I R P O R T  -  D A Y

Mist in the air, a jet taxis to a terminal.

46.  I N T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  D A Y

SCHUYLER comes out of the gate with the garment bag and a

briefcase.  He joins up with a DRIVER carrying a sign that says VAN

ORTON, the man takes his bag for him.

The man shakes his head, Schuyler, exasperated, whips out his cell-

phone and dials.  As he and the driver move through the CROWD, they

pass a red-eyed, dredlocked, homeless-looking RASTA MAN in a

BRIGHTLY COLORED outfit with knit cap, hassling other TRAVELERS.

He turns his attention to Schuyler and begins walking alongside.

The driver and Schuyler climb into a little white people mover

cart, the driver starts forward, BEEPING at folks in the way.  The

rasta man continues to badger Schuyler.

The rasta man jogs alongside, holds up a stained, newsprint

religious TRACT, Schuyler glances at it without taking it--

CLOSE-- we see the words "CRISIS, REVELATION, SOLUTION."  The

letters C, Rand S are printed in a different color from the rest.

WIDER-- Schuyler ignores the tract, he's talking to Bob again on

the phone.  The driver SPEEDS UP as they pass a guard, entering a

restricted access area.

The Rasta Man runs out of breath as the cart SPEEDS UP.  He calls

after Schuyler:

47.  E X T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  D A Y

Cold and bleak.  The little white truck emerges from the terminal,

crosses the tarmac, heading toward an IDLING HELICOPTER, where is

stops.  From the chopper, ALAN BAER emerges-- he's an elderly,

muscular man, bluff, once blue-collar.  He gives Schuyler a firm

handshake.  They have to SHOUT over the WHIRRING BLADES:

SCHUYLER looks uncomfortable with this prospect.  The driver is

already loading his bag into the chopper.  Baer claps a hand on

Schuyler's shoulder, leading him under the wash, into the chopper.

THE RASTA MAN is walking slowly across the tarmac nearby.  He

watches the HELICOPTER ASCEND with a half-smile.

48.  I N T .   H E L I C O P T E R  -  D A Y

SCHUYLER and BAER in the back of the chopper.

Schuyler looks out the window.

SCHUYLER'S POV - On the PASTA MAN in his colorful clothes, now

holding up a dangling KEY on a chain.  Moments later, he's

invisible in the MIST.

ON SCHUYLER, looking disappointed, and annoyed with himself-- he

realizes he's missed something.  He reaches into his pocket as Baer

DRONES ON beside him.  Schuyler pulls out his KEYS, fingers the

gold one with the CRS logo, thinking.

49.  E X T .   M O U N T A I N S  -  D A Y

The HELICOPTER swoops low over a beautiful FORESTED MOUNTAINSIDE.

50.  I N T .   B A E R - G R A C E   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y

PAN from a WINDOW.  Outside, we see a sign-- BAER-GRACE LUMBER--

and the helicopter, now idle on a pad.  MOVE PAST a HUMMING FAX

MACHINE, find Schuyler addressing Alan Baer across a table.  A

couple of other LUMBER EXECS are present.  Everyone wears a

stricken expression, Schuyler's tone is matter-of-fact.

As he speaks, Schuyler moves to the fax machine.  A TRANSMISSION

has come through, he picks up the sheaf of papers.

Schuyler squints at the papers in his hand, flipping through them.

CLOSE, the entire transmission has been GARBLED.  The words all

BLEED TOGETHER incomprehensibly, it looks like a child's scribbles.

SCHUYLER turns on him, a suspicion forming...

Schuyler studies the SENSELESS PAGES for a moment then puts them

down, shaking off his apprehensions.

In BG, one exec picks up a page, WHISPERS to an ASSISTANT, who

moves out of the room.  Schuyler moves to his briefcase.  It's

LOCKED.  He starts patting his pockets.

Baer has a malevolent expression.  Schuyler looks at him.

A couple of execs stifle chuckles.  Schuyler's suspicions mount.

His eyes drift to a piece of CORPORATE STATIONARY on the table in

front of him.  He picks it up:

INSERT - UNDER BAER-GRACE LETTERHEAD we see a handscrawled note:

"CRS CALLED."  We don't see what's written below.

SCHUYLER is reeling, paranoia confirmed.

Baer stares at him blankly.  Schuyler puts a hand over his eyes,

seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together.

The assembled execs are looking at Schuyler in utter confusion.  As

he speaks, the ASSISTANT returns with some PAPERWORK.  Schuyler

stares at him menacingly.  Hesitantly:

The assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents

in front of Schuyler.  The assistant fishes in his pocket.

Schuyler gingerly takes the KEYS which the assistant holds out,

looks from them to the paperwork.  Then he glances back at the

handwritten note on the table:

INSERT NOTE:  It actually reads "CBS CALLED."  (Schuyler's thumb or

a Post-It note covered the base of the B before, making it look

like an R.)  It continues "Re: Interview with Alan B. on Sun..."

SCHUYLER takes a breath, reassembles his composure and consults his

watch.  He rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him.

He heads for the door.  As he leaves, the execs exchange looks.

51.  I N T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  N I G H T

Schuyler wanders through the terminal, carrying his bags, glancing

periodically at the DEPARTURES monitor and the clock.  His manner

now has changed, he eyes every PASSERBY, especially the ODD ONES.

Suddenly a leg is thrust out from behind an advertising kiosk,

Schuyler TRIPS and goes sprawling.  The Rasta Man steps out, now

wearing SUNGLASSES with PINK LENSES.

Schuyler gets up, dusts himself off.  As calmly as possible:

He snatches up the briefcase, dances back a few paces.  Schuyler

speaks as if to a child.

The rasta man keeps backing away, puts a hand to his ear.

Schuyler is pursuing the man, walking faster and faster.

The rasta turns and RUNS, Schuyler bolts after him, unable to

believe this is happening.  They draw a lot of looks during the

brief chase through the terminal, the suited businessman, garment

bag flapping behind him, in pursuit of the crazy rasta.

He runs into a MEN'S ROOM, Schuyler follows a moment later.

52.  I N T .   A I R P O R T   M E N ' S   R O O M  -  N I G H T

Schuyler has the rasta cornered now-- but he doesn't have the

briefcase.  Both are out of breath.  PISSING MEN look wary.

The rasta men holds out a SHINY KEY on a chain.  Schuyler narrows

his eyes, he's trying not to lose control of his temper.

THE RASTA makes a sad face, SNIFFLES, still dangling the key.

The rasta nods with a big grin.  Schuyler steps forward, hand

extended.  The rasta flings open the door of a STALL beside him and

hurls the key into the TOILET.  Instinctively, Schuyler moves to

grab it, reaches into the toilet, pulls out the chain, his hand and

sleeve DRIPPING.  The key is missing from the end of the chain.

He drops the rasta schtick, speaks with an Ivy League accent:

He takes off his sunglasses, folds them and tucks them in the

pocket of Schuyler's suit.  Then he reaches above him and pulls

down the briefcase, which was perched on top of the stall.

Schuyler grabs it from him, raises his voice:

He gives Schuyler a hearty SLAP on the back and strolls off,

HUMMING.  Schuyler leans against the wall, shaking his head.  He

puts down his luggage, pulls the sunglasses from his pocket.

CLOSE ON SUNGLASSES-- there's the image of a tiny GOLD KEY embossed

on each of the arms.

SCHUYLER puts them on, looks around for a moment, catches a GLIMPSE

of himself in the mirror-- he looks silly.  He quickly takes them

off.  As Schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind... the

Rasta has slapped a colorful SIGN that reads "KICK ME" on his back.

53.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y

THE NEON SIGN FIZZLES in front of this low-rent establishment.

54.  I N T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y

BELLS RING and LIGHTS FLASH as a DRUNK plays a PINBALL MACHINE with

a lot of body English.  SCHUYLER, stuck at a table right next to

the machine, winces at the noise, checks his watch and rises.  He

makes his way through the lunch hour CROWD to the bar, leans toward

the bartender, a gravelly-voiced woman-- RONNIE.

He drums his fingers, then whips out a CELLPHONE, spins around

quickly as he starts to dial--

--and SMACKS into Christine the waitress as she emerges from the

kitchen carrying a tray--

--SCHUYLER gets hit in the chest with a TRAY OF DESSERTS, colorful

JELLO, CREAM PIE, etc.  He stands there, stunned and DRIPPING.

She starts picking up plates and silverware, oblivious to

Schuyler's own plight; Ronnie charges out from behind the bar.

After the first shock, Schuyler CHUCKLES with annoyance.  He wipes

the phone clean, pocketing it.

Ronnie gives Christine a look as she starts wiping at Schuyler with

a rag.  He picks at his chest, examines the WHIPPED CREAM, tastes

it.  Schuyler addresses the kneeling Christine:

CHRISTINE squints up at him, puzzled.

She THROWS a plate on the ground, it shatters, then storms off into

the kitchen.  Schuyler CHUCKLES angrily, pushing through the slop

on the floor with his shoe, looking for something.

Ronnie stares, uncomprehending... Schuyler goes after Christine.

55.  I N T .   L E O ' S   K I T C H E N  -  D A Y

He crosses past a short-order COOK in the grimy industrial kitchen,

pulling a cube of JELLO out of his lapel pocket.  He finds

Christine in an alcove with a couple of lockers, as she finishes

changing into her street clothes.  Her brown uniform hangs from a

locker door, the nameplate "CHRIS" prominent.

CLOSE as his fingers touch the CRS of CHRIS-- they even look a bit

brighter than the H and the I.

CHRISTINE notices him for the first time.

She waves a hand at him, "go away" and ducks out of view, finishing

dressing into punk-grungy street clothes.  She SLAMS the locker,

starts to push past him, pulling on her backpack bag.

She puts her hand into her side pocket, pulls it out with her

middle finger extended, moving away from him in a hurry.

Schuyler's face falls-- he made another mistake.

She's out the SWINGING kitchen door.  Schuyler absorbs his blunder

for a moment, then hurries after her.

56.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y

Schuyler catches up as Christine hurries toward a MUNI station,

LIGHTING a cigarette.  A few PEDESTRIANS come off the steps from

the arriving elevated train in this residential SF neighborhood.

She reaches into her purse/backpack, Schuyler backs off.

He starts to move away, then they both hear GASPING O. S.--

ON THE STEPS, a HEAVY MAN, 60, in a coat and tie has collapsed,

struggling for breath, very pale.  Christine and Schuyler are the

only pedestrians around now.

She rushes to help the guy, loosening his tie-- he JOLTS.

SCHUYLER looks up at them dubiously, brushing a scrap of food still

clinging to his suit.

CHRISTINE reaches in to clear the guy's throat, starting CPR.  She

shoots a look at Schuyler.

Schuyler approaches slowly, pulling out his phone, studying the guy as

Christine gives him mouth-to-mouth.

SCHUYLER leans close to look at the man.

ON THE MAN'S FACE-- sweating, contorted, unnaturally pale, his eyes

rolling back as he GAGS his last...

CHRISTINE grabs the phone away from Schuyler, dials.

She stuffs the phone in a pocket and pumps the man's chest, returns

to the mouth-to-mouth.  Schuyler looks around uncomfortably,

starting to believe this is a real heart attack.

CHRISTINE ignores him, all attention on saving this guy's life...

56A. WIDE as an AMBULANCE pulls up, SIREN BLARING.  A couple of

MALE PARAMEDICS hurry out with a stretcher.

ON THE STEPS, the two PARAMEDICS lift the unconscious HEAVY MAN

onto the stretcher while Christine and Schuyler stand aside.  Both

have small EARPIECES that look like hearing aids, with wires into

their clothes.  Throughout the following, there's a lot of MEDICAL

BUSINESS-- feeding the victim OXYGEN, giving him INJECTIONS, etc.

She climbs into the back, they start to shut the doors.

He climbs in to get it back, they SLAM THE DOORS and start moving.

THE AMBULANCE peels out.  We now see the LOGO on the back:

"CITYWIDE RESCUE SYSTEMS," with the C, R and S in RED.

57.  I N T .   A M B U L A N C E  -  D A Y

The PARAMEDICS are intent on the gasping man.  The SIREN BLARES, a

bit MUFFLED in here.  Schuyler, looking out the back, is extremely

pissed, makes a fist and almost punches the wall of the ambulance.

A BUMP almost sends him flying atop the stretcher.  Schuyler sits

near Christine on a ledge near the back doors.  Petulant:

58(NEW).  I N T .   H O S P I T A L   E N T R A N C E / G A R A G E  -  D A Y

An UNDERGROUND RAMP, signs reading "EMERGENCY VEHICLES ONLY," a set

of DOORS leading into the lobby of an EMERGENCY ROOM; MEDICAL

PERSONNEL visible inside, INJURED PEOPLE, etc., a few PEOPLE mill

outside the doors.

THE AMBULANCE SCREECHES to a stop, the back doors fly open, the

PARAMEDICS wheel out the dying man and rush into the entrance,

automatic doors OPEN and CLOSE for them.  Schuyler and Christine

climb out, disoriented, walking more slowly to the doors.  The

AMBULANCE pulls away behind them.  Schuyler nearly slips in a

mysterious dark PUDDLE.

As she says this, she walks right into the ELECTRIC DOORS, which

fail to open for them.

THEIR POV-- THROUGH THE DOORS the gathered STAFF and PATIENTS all

turn at once to regard Christine and Schuyler.  They GRIN and WINK.

ON SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE, who barely get the chance to register

this before--

THE LIGHTS GO OUT... PITCH BLACKNESS and SUDDEN SILENCE.  We hear

only SCHUYLER'S BITTER LAUGHTER.  Dialogue OVER DARKNESS:

We hear RUSTLING in a purse, but still see next to nothing.

We hear the STRIKING OF A MATCH, there's some ORANGE LIGHT--

CHRISTINE holds the match.  The whole area is DESERTED, except for

the two of them.  SCHUYLER kicks at the glass doors-- they're not

going to give, nothing is visible beyond them.

SCHUYLER has found a STEEL DOOR with a GLOWING RED SIGN:  EMERGENCY

USE ONLY.  He yanks it open and a PAIL swings down, dumping WATER

on his head.  He's facing a BRICK WALL through the door.

CHRISTINE can't help but LAUGH, then YELPS in pain as the match

burns her fingers.  LIGHTS another.  Schuyler flips open his phone.

She flips it on, A BLINDING STROBE FLASHES for a few seconds-- both

CRY OUT-- then the BULB EXPLODES in a shower of sparks.

They've taken a few steps forward, exploring the DARK.  She LIGHTS

a cigarette with the next match, nearly running into ANOTHER DOOR.

She RATTLES it-- locked.

Schuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold CRS key-- nope.

In the matchlight, we see Schuyler fumbling in his pockets, pulling

out the ROSY SUNGLASSES from the Rasta.  He puts them on.

SCHUYLER'S POV as the last MATCH GOES OUT-- CHRISTINE GLOWS RED in

the matchlight for a moment, then as soon as it goes out, we see a

GLOW of FLUORESCENT PAINT on the ground... a series of STRIPES and

ARROWS in DIFFERENT COLORS, GLOWING.  These start PARALLEL near

where he stands, then RADIATE in different directions.  CHRISTINE

is but a SILHOUETTE against the COLORED LINES.

CHRISTINE moves away from him.

A BURST OF FLAME erupts from the GROUND close enough to scare the

shit out of CHRISTINE, who SCREAMS.  SCHUYLER hurries toward her.

The FLAMES VANISH, she lurches in a differrent direction--

She LOSES HER FOOTING on a slippery surface, falls, sliding down a

gentle SLOPE.

SCHUYLER follows.  FALLING himself.  They try to reach toward each

other for purchase, but it's no good, the slope is getting steeper.

58A. In a moment SCHUYLER tumbles on top of Christine in a four-

foot deep round CHILDREN'S POOL, but it isn't full of water.

There's a bit of BLACK LIGHT here, enough to make out--

--COCKROACHES, thousands of them, a TEEMING ROIL OF INSECTS in a

CHURNING LIQUID.  There's a BUZZING NOISE, both SCREAM.

SCHUYLER quickly helps lift Christine out.  She starts to pull him

upward, but--

He steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs, about to get sick,

finally coming up with the glasses.  He shakes them free of INSECTS

and clambers out to join Christine, who's GASPING and brushing the

bugs off of her.  SCHUYLER puts on the glasses and holds up a BUG.

She grabs his arm; both are now covered in MUCK from the bug soup.

He takes off the glasses, puts them on her.  She looks around.

HER POV-- the RAINBOW of COLORED LINES on the FLOOR...

SCHUYLER slips the glasses off her, puts them back on.

HIS POV-- a BLUE LINE moves in a snaking path ahead of them, going

in circles now and then, INTERSECTING or moving PARALLEL to other

colors, up a series of ramps.  This space sometimes resembles a

PARKING GARAGE, scmetimes a SEWER or a STEAM TUNNEL.

CHRISTINE keeps a hand on Schuyler as he follows the path.

58B. LATER, CHRISTINE almost hugs Schuyler now, as they move in a

seemingly random pattern in the darkness.

The BLUE LINE has led them into a NARROW TUNNEL, soon they're

crawling on hands and knees.

The TUNNEL has opened up again.  There's even a tiny bit of VISIBLE

LIGHT now.  He takes off the glasses, gives them to her.

HER POV-- the COLORED LINES are all joining up from different

directions.  A few steps onward they all converge at a point, like

the spokes of a wheel, at a WHITE SPOT on the ground...

SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE look around, then Schuyler points upward--

A WHITE RING overhead... it looks like the underside of a MANHOLE

COVER, with an illuminated CIRCLE OF LIGHT around the rim, a halo.

SCHUYLER steps on the circle of WHITE-- it's a BUTTON.  A ROPE

LADDER drops down.

59.  E X T .   W A L K W A Y  -  E V E N I N G

A MANHOLE COVER slides aside, SCHUYLER climbs out and helps

Christine up.  It's a short, covered WOODEN WALKWAY in an alley.

SCHUYLER points to some GRAFFITI-- a HEART with "SVO + CLK."

They start to move shakily down the CONSTRUCTION WALKWAY, both

bedraggled, covered in goo.  HANDBILLS cover one wall.

ON THE WALL, a series of HANDBILLS say, "AREN'T YOU FORGETTING

SOMETHING?"  SCHUYLER puzzles over these as they move, gets to one

last one-- "BEHIND YOU, STUPID."

SCHUYLER looks back toward the end of the alley--

A YELLOW DUMPSTER with the logo, "CONSOLIDATED REFUSE SUPPLY" and

the smaller image of a KEY.  SCHUYLER moves quickly to it, throws

open the lid.

ANGLE IN DUMPSTER-- a MOUNTAIN of SHREDDED PAPER.

SCHUYLER rolls his eyes, sorting through it.  Christine approaches.

He climbs inside, dives in... and pops up again in a moment with--

CLOSE-- A Z-SHAPED WINDOW CRANK.  Sure enough, there's a KEY

embossed on the side.

SCHUYLER climbs out again, brandishing the small crank.

60.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  E V E N I N G

SCHUYLER pockets the crank as he and CHRISTINE emerge from the

alley.  PEDESTRIANS give them a wide berth.  To a PASSERBY:

Schuyler heads straight for the CRS doors, the large numbers 636

printed above-- it's LOCKED.  He tries his little GOLD KEY on a

deadbolt, it's USELESS of course.

He walks a few steps on, she stands still for a moment, then nods

agreeably and follows.

61.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T

START ON THE SKYLINE-- SCHUYLER moves from the window, as we hear a

DOOR OPEN.  CHRISTINE emerges from the attached dressing area and

bath, toweling damp hair, in an oversized Harvard sweatshirt and

gym shorts, with a large plastic bag containing her filthy clothes.

She looks good, clearly she put some effort into her make-up.

He points to a MINI-FRIDGE, shuts the door, a moment later we hear

WATER RUNNING.  She looks around the office, letting down her

facade.  She seems quite impressed, and intimidated, by the place.

She looks back toward the bathroom door-- maybe this guy isn't so

bad after all.  From this point, she takes a more seductive tack.

62.  I N T .   D R E S S I N G   A R E A / B A T H  -  N I G H T

LATER, Schuyler has cleaned up, is finishing dressing, pulling a

pair of jeans over boxer shorts, tucking in a sport shirt.

Christine talks through the closed door.

63.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T

Schuyler emerges, shoes in hand.

Christine sits on his desk, with her bag slung over her shoulder,

eating an APPLE.  She slides off the desk, flirting rather bluntly.

Christine realizes her come-on is falling flat, she pulls back,

tossing her unfinished apple in the trash.

Christine nods disappointedly as Schuyler moves to the door.

64.  I N T .   L I M O  -  N I G H T

Schuyler and Christine ride in silence in the back seat.

As the limo pulls over, he and Christine turn to each other.  It's

a somewhat awkward moment.

The limo has stopped now.  Schuyler has started to open the door.

So saying, she pulls it off.  She's wearing a black bra... a ROSE

is tattooed on her shoulder.  Schuyler can't help but react.  She

thrusts the shirt at him, he's half out of the car.

He nods slightly... as he reaches to take it--

--CHRISTINE leans forward, cups the back of his head and gives him

a LONG, HARD KISS.

JACK THE DRIVER, middle-aged and trustworthy, turns and catches a

glimpse of this, quickly turns away.

CHRISTINE breaks the kiss, sinks back against the red leather seat,

waiting for Schuyler to make the next move.

Schuyler nods again, torn.  She's looking at him expectantly.  He's

clearly aroused, but this is such an inappropriate female.  Sadly,

he waves a hand.

65.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  N I G H T

Schuyler shuts the door, sweatshirt in hand, the dome light slowly

DIMS OUT out on the crestfallen Christine-- we see her mouth a

CURSE.  Schuyler moves toward his MBZ, the limo IDLING.  He's about

to get inside when he sees a TICKET IN AN ENVELOPE under the

windshield wiper.  He SNORTS-- insult to injury-- tosses it on the

dash as he climbs in.

66.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T

He sits behind the wheel, watching the lights of the limo

disappear.  He sniffs the sweatshirt a moment, then STARTS at the

sound of a MOTOR STARTING across the street.

ANGLE THROUGH SIDE WINDOW-- an MBZ the same year, model and color

as Schuyler's-- pulls away from the curb, Schuyler gets a glimpse

of something REFLECTING STREET LIGHT in the window of the car-- a

gun?  A camera with a long lens?  The car makes a quick U-turn and

drives in the same direction as the limo.

SCHUYLER, curious, STARTS THE ENGINE as if to pursue.  Then he

glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye.  He

doesn't put the car in gear, picks up the envelope instead...

CLOSE ON ENVELOPE-- The words "OPEN ME" are printed in BLOCK

LETTERS on the outside.  He opens it quickly-- there's no ticket

inside, but he shakes out a RAINBOW-COLORED CONDOM in a clear

wrapper and a NOTE in KIDNAPPER LETTERS:  "BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY."

SCHUYLER frowns at this and throws the note aside.  He flips on the

WINDSHIELD WIPERS (it's started to DRIZZLE) and pulls out.

POV THROUGH WINDESIELD-- A DARK FIGURE runs from the curb by Leo's,

right in front of the car, SCHUYLER SLAMS on the BRAKES--

--It's DAVID.  He hurries around to the passenger door and jumps

in, looking haggard, scared, a man on the run.

SCHUYLER pulls forward.

He sees the crumpled note on the floor, picks it up--

He cranks his neck around, looking for pursuers.  Schuyler looks at

him for a beat-- BANG!  He almost loses control of the wheel.

SCENES 67-71 DELETED

72.  E X T .   C I T Y   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T

A TIRE HAS BLOWN.  Schuyler drives ON THE RIM, struggles to get

over to the curb, BRAKES hard and stops.

73.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T

David's losing it, looking around.

He picks up the phone, punches buttons, gets nothing.

David reaches for the glovebox.

CLOSE ON GLOVEBOX-- it POPS OPEN and KEYS SPILL OUT.  There are at

least fifty of them jammed in there, all kinds, silver and gold...

and all have CRS stamped on them.

SCHUYLER leans closer, intrigued.  David's eyes go wide as he

fingers a few of these keys.

74(NEW).  E X T .   G O L D E N   G A T E   P A R K  -  N I G H T

David gets out of the car in a hurry, amidst the greenery in the

park.  RAINING HARDER now.

Schuyler tries hard to be rational, but David is over the edge.

David SLUGS HIM in the face, Schuyler staggers back, clutches his

BLEEDING nose.  David runs, full tilt, into the woods near the

Japanese Tea Garden.

SCHUYLER pursues amidst the trees and vegetation, running out of

breath, calling after David, who's vanished.  He leans against a

tree, PANTING, dabbing at his bleeding nose with a SCRAP OF TISSUE

from his pocket.  He hears a PHONE RINGING, moves toward it,

emerging through bushes near the ACADEMY OF SCIENCE...

He pauses at the RINGING PAYPHONE.  He decides not to pick it up,

looking around at the deserted MUSEUM BUILDINGS and hurrying toward

civilization.  He passes other PAYPHONES en route to the park

exit... each one STARTS RINGING as he approaches it.  He moves

faster, freaked.  At the edge of the park, he snatches one up--

SCHUYLER slams the phone down.  He dabs his nose one more time,

tosses the paper scrap into the trash.

CLOSE ON SCRAP-- "CRS" with the emergency NUMBER, the blue ink has

BLED with the rain and Schuyler's BLOOD...

SCENE 75 DELETED

76(NEW).  E X T .   F U L T O N   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T

POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD, as Schuyler emerges from the park.  The

car suddenly MOVES FORWARD--

WITH SCHUYLER.  He walks to the curb, distractedly raises a hand

for a cab, which pulls up instantly.  He climbs in.

77.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T

An aged, battered CAB; PLEXIGLAS between the CABBIE and the back.

The cabbie nods and hits the gas.

78.  E X T .   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T

The cab roars down the street, KICKING UP WATER from the gutters.

79.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T

Schuyler bites his cuticle, not watching where they're going; the

windows are wet and fogged.  Then he looks out, narrows his eyes

and RAPS on the PLEXIGLAS PARTITION.

The cabbie turns IN PROFILE for a moment.  He appears to be wearing

a HEARING AID, a round piece of plastic, a tiny WIRE disappearing

into his shirt.  And there's something familiar about his face.

Schuyler glances at the driver ID on the back of the seat--

CLOSE ON PHOTO, the man is the RASTA from the airport, with a new

hairdo.  The COMPANY NAME-- "CONSOLIDATED REGENCY SEDANS."  CRS.

SCHUYLER rubs his head, very angry.

The cab STOPS at a RED LIGHT.  SCHUYLER tries the doorhandle-- it

doesn't work.

80.  E X T .   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T

The cab PEELS OUT when the light turns green, heads for a pier.

81.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T

Schuyler looks around in increasing panic.

The cabbie opens his own door and leaps out of the MOVING CAB--

82.  E X T .   W H A R F  -  N I G H T

The cabbie/rasta hits the ground and ROLLS in a perfect stunt fall.

The cab rockets to the end of the disused wharf and--

--GOES FLYING off the edge into the San Francisco Bay, illuminated

by SPOTLIGHTS from the end of the wharf.

83.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T

Schuyler SCREAMS as the cab plunges and HITS the water.

84.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T

The STEAMING cab's nose slowly DIPS below the surface.

85.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T

FILLING WITH WATER from the car's floor, from overhead.  EERIE

LIGHT from the front of the cab.  Schuyler tries to roll down the

window, the handle SPINS, nothing happens.

86.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T

The cab GOES UNDER with a BURBLE of BUBBLES.

87.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T

Schuyler CRANKS the other window handle desperately, now up to his

waist in water, water GUSHING IN now.  INCREASING BLACKNESS through

the windows as he sinks.  The handle falls off in his hand.

88.  U N D E R W A T E R   S H O T  -  N I G H T

The sinking cab, HEADLIGHTS and INTERIOR LIGHTS STILL ON, Schuyler

inside KICKING at the windows and the Plexi, without any success.

89.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T

Schuyler stops his frantic kicking, tries to think coolly.  He's up

to his neck by now. Angry at himself for not realizing it sooner,

he pulls what he needs out of his pocket-- the HANDCRANK he found

in the dumpster.  He takes a deep breath and--

90. SUBMERGES.  UNDERWATER he inserts the crank into the window

handle hole... a perfect fit.  He CRANKS FAST, WATER FLOODS IN.

91.  U N D E R W A T E R   S H O T  -  N I G H T

Schuyler SLITHERS OUT the open window.  Cheeks puffed out, he kicks

frantically for the surface.

92.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T

He BURSTS to the surface, SPLUTTERING, catching his BREATH.  A

FLASHLIGHT BEAM catches him.

Schuyler, treading water, turns around--

A CABIN CRUISER at the dock nearby.  A very beautiful GIRL in a

yellow rain slicker, holding a powerful FLASHLIGHT leans over the

edge, tosses him a life preserver, hauls him toward her.

93.  E X T .   C A B I N   C R U I S E R  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER clambers onto the rear ladder with the girl's help, teeth

CHATERING.  HOLD ON the boat's colorfully painted name on the

stern:  "POSEIDON'S CURSE," and in small letters, "COSTA REY SOL."

SCHUYLER boards the large, ritzy craft.

Schuyler nods, looking around, recovering from the shock.

94.  I N T .   B O A T   C A B I N  -  N I G H T

Schuyler's wet clothes hang from a hook, he's in a towel, starting

to pull on a fresh set of casual clothes.

His back is turned as the girl climbs down, opens her raincoat--

only a STRING BIKINI beneath.  She could be a Playboy centerfold.

He turns slowly, just as the girl reaches behind her.

She WINKS as she lets her top drop.  Schuyler smiles strangely.

She takes this for lust, approaches him with open arms.  He GRABS

her by the hair.  Menacingly:

She pounds at him, tries to kick.  He wrestles her to the floor,

kneels on top of her.  He seems about to hit her.

Schuyler gets his rage under control, horrified at himself.  He

climbs off her, she scrambles away, afraid, covering herself.

Schuyler realizes he's not going to get anything more out of her,

pulls on a shirt, grabs his wet clothes and leaves the cabin.

95.  E X T .   W H A R F  -  N I G H T

Schuyler leaps off onto the wharf.  The girl, pulling the raincoat

on, leans over the deck.

Schuyler pauses, turns slowly, approaches.

THE GIRL nods quickly, reaches over the railing to hand him a SMALL

WOODEN COFFIN with a BLACK BOW and a RED KEY BURNED into the lid.

SCHUYLER takes it from her gingerly, undoes the bow, opens the lid:

ANGLE IN COFFIN-- an ornate HATCHET with a KEY DESIGN on the blade.

SCHUYLER REMOVES it from its QUILTED resting place.  THE GIRL backs

away, nervous to see SCHUYLER with a weapon.

He drops the AXE and the COFFIN into the water with a SPLASH--

95PT. THEY GO UNDER and DISAPPEAR...

96.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  D A Y

Early morning, the RAIN has stopped-- a RAINBOW arcs behind the

office building.  TWO COP CARS, marked and unmarked, pull up at the

curb, lights FLASHING.

97.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  D A Y

Schuyler, in the clothes from the boat, and Plympton, his lawyer,

are joined at the elevators by two plainclothes detectives--

BARNETT and GALLO-- and two UNIFORMS.

98.  I N T .   C R S   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y

Schuyler enters, followed by the others.  He stops short, reacts.

WIDE SHOT reveals-- the same offices, now entirely empty.  The

partitions, the desks, everything has been removed.  A small amount

of TRASH is scattered on the floor-- the move was evidently hasty.

99. LATER.  UNIFORM #1 SPEAKS into his walkie-talkie, COP TALK; #2

pokes around in a box full of SHREDDED PAPER; Plympton CONFERS with

Barnett, nods, then both of them cross to Schuyler, who sits on the

carpet, back to an empty wall.  Barnett checks his notes.

Gallo, who'd been talking on a phone IN BG, approaches.

Schuyler spots an empty CHINESE FOOD CARTON crumpled in the corner.

CLOSER as SCHUYLER picks up and fingers the container-- Chinese

characters on it, the name TUNG HOY.

SCHUYLER nods, unconvinced.

100(NEW).  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   M A N S I O N  -  D A Y

PLYMPTON pulls up in his LEXUS, SCHUYLER gets out wearily.

SCHUYLER sighs and nods, closes the car door and waves good-bye.

He climbs the steps to his front door and Plympton pulls away.

101(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   F O Y E R  -  D A Y

SCHUYLER enters and automatically reaches for a LIGHTSWITCH--

BLUE SPARKS leap to his fingers, the switch has been RIPPED OUT,

leaving exposed WIRING.

SCHUYLER CURSES and shakes his hand out.  He looks around in

disbelief-- the walls are covered in GRAFFITI.

"GAME OVER" is the first one we see in the foyer, above the

HARLEQUIN, who still sits in the only upright chair... but now a

GLOSSY BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO is stuck in its teeth.

SCHUYLER pulls out the picture, looks at it, hand trembling--

A POLICE PHOTO of MR. VAN ORTON, his body sprawled in a pool of

blood.  It's stamped "PROPERTY SFPD" in red...

SCHUYLER tosses the picture aside, moves into his living room--

101B(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  D A Y

More GRAFFITI everywhere:  "FUCK THE POLICE," "SORE LOSER!," "NO

FUTURE," "CRS RULES," assorted OBSCENITIES.  BOOM, as Schuyler

moves through the living room, CONTACT EXPLOSIVES on the floor

EXPLODE beneath his feet, making him LEAP and DANCE.

OVER THE MANTLEPIECE, A NOTE is stuck into a PAINTING with a

KITCHEN-KNIFE.  SCHUYLER approaches and rips this down.

INSERT NOTE, PAN DOWN SLOWLY, X-CLOSE:  "Like my father before me,

I kill what I love.  Goodbye, cruel world, blah blah blah..."  A

RED SIGNATURE ARROW is affixed by a DOTTED LINE at the bottom,

"PLEASE SIGN HERE."

SCHUYLER GROANS and crumples the note.  He reaches for a phone-- he

PICKS up the receiver, it's been MELTED into the body of the

telephone.  He throws it aside.  He hears VOICES from the next

room, enters cautiously, picking up a SMALL SCULPTURE as a weapon--

lOlC(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   S T U D Y  -  D A Y

THE TELEVISION is on, playing a silly-looking CARTOON.  ACTION

HEROS fly through the air, shooting LIGHT from their eyeballs, etc.

SCHUYLER lowers his weapon, moves to shut off the tube.  More

GRAFITTI over the walls, the books, etc.:  stick figure drawings of

a MAN HANGING HIMSELF, a BROKEN HEART, a PENIS, a NAKED WOMAN, etc.

Across the walls, over the TV, are the words, "YOU ARE NOT ALONE."

SCHUYLER presses the on-off switch-- nothing happens.

ON SCREEN, THE MASKED ACTION HERO stands proudly, hands on hips,

before a colorful MOVING BACKGROUND.  It speaks in a cheezy HE-MAN

VOICE, an ANIMATED MOUTH.  There's a CRS LOGO on its chest.

SCHUYLER covers his eyes, leans against a chair; this is too much.

Schuyler realizes this is a two-way conversation as the CRS-MAN

WINKS at him, making a stiff WAVE.

THE SCREEN IMPLODES as SCHUYLER SMASHES IT with the sculpture--

Schuyler peers into the SMOKING electronics, pulls out a battery

pack, a small video camera, a loop antenna; the SPEAKER's not dead.

He BASHES the equipment repeatedly on the floor with all his might.

The speaker SPUTTERS OUT, the CRS-MAN'S VOICE at last SILENCED.

The PHONE has started ringing during the above.  Schuyler,

breathless, moves around the room now, trying to find it.  He

finally tracks it down in the bottom of a GARBAGE CAN, covered with

disgusting SLIME which he wipes on his shirt.

SCHUYLER pulls his wallet, spreading his credit cards on the floor.

101D(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   F O Y E R  -  D A Y

START ON THE DUMMY, propped in a chair-- SCHUYLER seizes it,

SMASHES IT against the wall, the glass head SHATTERS.

102(NEW).  E X T .   C L A R E M O N T   H O T E L  -  D A Y

LATE AFTERNOON, the COMPANY LIMO pulls up and Schuyler emerges.

102B(NEW).  I N T .   C L A R E M O N T   H O T E L  -  D A Y

SCHUYLER crosses the opulent lobby to the desk.  A passing BELLHOP

gives him a nod and a smile.

Schuyler stares after the bellhop, whom he's clearly never seen

before.  He proceeds to the check-in desk.  Before he can even

introduce himself, the DESK CLERK turns to him with a tight smile--

From under the desk he removes a small ATTACHE CASE, places it

gingerly in front of Schuyler.

SCHUYLER examines the case closely for the first time, sees the

gold monogram, "S. V. O."

The man trails off and moves away.

The man ignores him now.  Schuyler pockets his credit card, thinks

a beat, then grabs the briefcase.

SCENES 103-104 DELETED

105.  I N T .   C O M P A N Y   L I M O  -  D A Y

JACK drives, Schuyler in back, studying the open briefcase in his

lap.  He seems extremely upset, fighting to maintain his wits...

JACK is a bit nervous, he doesn't want to piss off the boss.

Schuyler looks at the man, who stares straight ahead, not believing

him for a second.  Schuyler shakes his head, looks down at the open

briefcase in his lap.

ANGLE IN BRIEFCASE-- a set of HANDCUFFS, assorted BONDAGE GEAR...

and a few BLURRY POLAROID PHOTOS, showing a NAKED WOMAN with a

LEATHER MASK chained to a bed.  ONE SHOT shows her shoulder

clearly-- we see a ROSE TATTOO.

106.  E X T .   I M P O U N D   L O T  -  D A Y

A female IMPOUND WORKER with paperwork leads SCHUYLER through a

maze of SMASHED CARS, etc.  IN BG, the COMPANY LIMO pulls away.

Schuyler shakes his head.  They've reached his MBZ.

SCHUYLER bends down to look in the window.

HIS POV-- THE BACKSEAT has been SLASHED.  A few SPLASHES OF BLOOD,

not too much.  Schuyler's HARVARD SWEATSHIRT is torn and STAINED

with blood, crumpled in a corner of the seat.

SCHUYLER swallows, recovers quickly.

He quickly gets behind the wheel.

SCENE 107 DELETED

108.  E X T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   N E I G H B O R H O O D / H O U S E  -  E V E N I N G

SCHUYLER'S MBZ cruises past rows of similar-looking, lower-middle-

class homes, a pretty shabby neighborhood.  He parks the Benz.  A

WHITE VAN is parked just up the street, a LOOP AND RABBIT EAR on

the roof.  PAN to show THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR... A cartoonish logo

with the CRS MAN holding a wrench by a TV SET in front of a

RAINBOW, the words "CABLE REPAIR SPECIALISTS."

ON THE HOUSE, MOVE from a WHITEWALL TIRE hanging on a rope from a

tree to SCHUYLER as he RINGS the front doorbell of a WHITE HOUSE.

AT THE DOOR, an older, working-class man in a T-shirt appears--

Christine's dad, MR. KAMINSKY.

MR. KAMINSKY narrows his eyes at him as we hear--

Schuyler, very surprised, peers around Mr. Kaminsky--

109.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  E V E N I N G

Schuyler does a double-take as CHRISTINE comes down the staircase,

wearing a sweatshirt and shorts.  She lights up when she sees him,

then quickly hides her excitement.

MR. KAMINSKY allows the relieved Schuyler to enter now.

Christine's dad WINKS at his daughter as he moves back to the

basement.  She rolls her eyes, but mouths, "thanks," and then moves

to sit beside Schuyler in the modest, over-knick-knacked living

room:  religious pictures and statues, family photos, etc.

SCHUYLER is smiling at himself now, shaking his head.  Christine

reaches across him to FLIP ON a lamp.

She hurries upstairs.  Schuyler sighs, wondering what the hell he's

doing here.  He glances at a VIRGIN MARY statue, squints-- then

unscrews the head, it's a decanter.  He takes a sniff and puts it

back with a bemused expression.  He takes another sniff, noticing

something else in the air...

A WISP OF SMOKE rises from the lamp Christine turned on.

SCHUYLER peers beneath the shade.  On the table is a framed

PHOTOGRAPH of a LITTLE GIRL who could be Christine in a frilly

white dress, holding flowers.

ANGLE INSIDE LAMPSHADE-- a new PRICETAG dangles from the shade

against the bulb, starting to TURN BROWN, smoking.

SCHUYLER licks his fingertips, reaches inside the shade to PULL OFF

tag-- in doing so, he burns his fingers on the hot bulb, STIFLES a

curse and jerks his hand away.  He KNOCKS OVER the picture, which

FALLS to the floor.  Shaking his hand, he rises distractedly, pokes

his head through a swinging door.

110.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   K I T C H E N  -  N I G H T

DIMLY LIT from outside.  Modest, surface clutter, hanging pots,

etc.  Schuyler moves to a sink, turns on the tap and RUNS WATER

over his burned fingertips.  He SHUTS OFF the tap, looks around for

a towel, shaking his hand-- the paper towel dispenser has no roll

on it.  He pulls open a kitchen drawer--

ANGLE IN DRAWER-- completely empty.

SCHUYLER, curious now, opens a cabinet, absently drying his hand on

his shirt-- also empty.  He tries another couple of drawers, finds

nothing but scraps of paper, matches.  No utensils.  He exits, a

disturbing thought forming.

111.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER picks up the photo to replace it on the table.

ANGLE ON PHOTO:  Schuyler slips the picture from its cardboard

mount-- it's an ADVERTISEMENT clipped from a glossy magazine, TEXT

printed on the portion previously unseen.

SCHUYLER quickly returns the clipping to its mount, puts the photo

back on the table as Christine comes downstairs, dressed and made-

up for a night on the town.

Schuyler nods casually toward the photo as she sits beside him.

He grabs her hand away.  Icily:

His tone alarms her-- he stares at her with hatred.  A silent BEAT

between them, each tries to assess the new situation.  She realizes

he's onto her.  She swallows, makes a quick decision.  Suddenly she

leans close to him, reaching around him to SHUT OFF the table lamp.

She leaves her arms around him and HISSES in his ear-- she drops

her lower-class accent, speaks in a clipped, educated voice:

She kisses him, he doesn't open his mouth, neither shuts their

eyes.  Then she gets up quickly, moves to a corner of the room.

She glances up quickly to indicate something on the ceiling--

ON CEILING, a large SMOKE DETECTOR with a RED LIGHT, a cable from

it-- there's a small LENS in the center... A HIDDEN CAMERA.

SCHUYLER looks at this, starting to rise.  She moves to a window,

out of range of the camera, beckons him over.

Schuyler comes up beside her, she nods for him to look outside--

POV-- THROUGH WINDOW-- the CRS VAN.  Christine WHISPERS urgently:

SCHUYLER turns to her, his voice is tired.

112.  I N T .   C R S   V A N  -  N I G H T

CLOSE on a video monitor, Schuyler framed in a FISHEYE SHOT:

He moves toward the front door, a panicked Christine behind him--

We hear MEN GETTING TO THEIR FEET, see BODIES MOVE in FG.

113.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  N I G H T

Christine's furious and terrified, dashes in front of him, LOCKS

and THROWS A CHAIN across the front door.

She starts to pull him away from the door, he throws off her arm.

He goes to the window and opens the curtain.

THROUGH WINDOW-- the Hack/Cabbie, the Rasta/Pilot and a pair of CRS

AGENTS (JOHN and PETER from the men's club) hurry toward the house,

the older men reach inside their jackets--

THE WINDOWS BLOW IN, GUNFIRE, Christine TACKLES HIM and pulls him

to the ground as--

KNICK-KNACKS fly to pieces directly behind where he was standing.

CHRISTINE AND SCHUYLER keep low as they dash for the kitchen--

114.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   K I T C H E N  -  N I G H T

Christine pulls him toward a basement door--

115.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   G A R A G E  -  N I G H T

They dash down steps to the darkened one-car garage, mostly empty

with a few random tools.  MR. KAMINSKY looks up from a game of

SOLITAIRE, a day player confused by the sudden commotion.

THE GARAGE DOOR OPENS, Christine pulls Schuyler against a wall--

A "PARAMEDIC" charges out of the shadows, pulling a handgun--

IN BG MR. KAMINSKY dives for cover with a frightened NOISE--

CHRISTINE grabs a WRENCH and CLUBS THE PARAMEDIC, who falls with a

CRY, clutching his skull.  They hear FOOTSTEPS on the stairs they

just came down.  Christine hustles the dazed Schuyler out of there.

116.  E X T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   H O U S E  -  N I G H T

Christine and Schuyler dash for the Benz, climb in and SCREECH OFF.

CRS MEN run for their van to pursue.

117.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T

Schuyler drives for all he's worth, Christine watching behind.

118.  E X T .   S U B U R B A N   S T R E E T S  -  N I G H T

A brief CHASE, the van pursues the MBZ.

119.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T

Christine turns forward, her eyes widen--

120.  E X T .   S U B U R B A N   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T

The MBZ SIDESWIPES a car as Schuyler runs a light, his WINDSHIELD

CRACKS, the side of the car's CRUNCHED IN, but he keeps driving.

He crosses lanes directly in front of an oncoming TRUCK-- the VAN

HITS THE BRAKES to avoid getting squashed.

Schuyler SKIDS into a narrow alley.  THE VAN, having lost a half a

block, misses this and continues straight.

121.  I N T .   M B Z  -  N I G H T

Christine's looking behind as Schuyler drives.

She's THROWN FORWARD as Schuyler SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, reaches

across her and THROWS OPEN the passenger door, which CREAKS from

the collision.  He gives her a shove, she clings to the doorframe--

Schuyler pushes harder.

122.  E X T .   S U B U R B A N   A L L E Y  -  N I G H T

Christine tumbles into the wet gutter.

Schuyler pulls the door shut, the car starts BACKING AWAY.

Christine gets to her feet, looks after him.  He reaches the end of

the alley and stops-- then SCREECHES FORWARD.  She jumps to the

edge of the alley, fearing he's trying to run her down.  Schuyler

HITS THE BRAKES a few feet away.  He leans across, calls to her.

123.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T

Christine puts a hand on the wheel before he can back up again.

124.  E X T .   H I G H W A Y  -  N I G H T

The MBZ SPEEDS out of a tunnel on the highway toward SF.

125.  I N T .   M B Z  -  N I G H T

Christine looks out the side window, lights a cigarette.

She gives him a pitying look.  Schuyler throws her a sidelong

glance; this is absurd.  She gestures at his car phone.

CAMERA MOVES IN ON SCHUYLER'S FACE during the following and--

126. --SCHUYLER'S DESKTOP COMPUTER as CHRISTINE'S HAND inserts a

FLOPPY DISK and starts hitting keys.

127. --RAPID INSERTS from the CRS OFFICES-- Schuyler's SIGNATURE,

financial FORMS, a TAPE RECORDER, TEST FORMS, etc.

--ON A CRT SCREEN as various combinations of letters and numbers

SCROLL BY, too quickly for the eye to read.

--PAN OVER BANKS Of COMPUTER TERMINALS in DARK OffICES as financial

READOUTS FLIP and CHANGE, VANISH.  HIGH NUMBERS go to 0.00.

--MOVE FROM deft fingers at a computer keyboard UPWARD toward the

screen.  POLARIZE to show, in reflection... FEINGOLD'S FACE, LIT BY

the BLUE-GREEN CRT LIGHT, a mask of evil.

END SERIES OF SHOTS, DISSOLVE TO:

128. SCHUYLER'S FACE... LIGHTS through the FRAGMENTED WINDSHIELD

cast weird PATTERNS on it.  He's pumping sweat now, reaches for his

cell phone, dials, hand shaking.  Christine flicks her cig out the

window; she sounds regretful.

Schuyler sets his jaw, drops the phone-- and turns the wheel hard.

129.  E X T .   H I G H W A Y  -  N I G H T

The MBZ SCREECHES for an offramp.

130.  E X T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T

Schuyler's on his portable phone at a gas station/convenience

store, leaning on the Benz as he pumps gas.  Christine stands out

of earshot, arms folded, staring at the dark horizon.

131.  I N T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T

START ON-- a thermos full of coffee, foodstuffs, miscellaneous

camping supplies as a CLERK holds a credit card, hangs up a phone.

He looks up at SCHUYLER and CHRISTINE.

Schuyler sighs, "of course," Christine fishes in her pocket.

132.  E X T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T

They emerge from the store with a couple of grocery bags, Christine

sucks an ice cream pop.  They toss the bags in the trunk.

Schuyler is seething, clutching the trunk lid for a beat, then

SLAMS it hard when she steps back, making her jump.

He stares at her, she looks sick and truly scared.  He climbs in

the car.  For once without a comeback, she gets in the car quietly.

133.  E X T .   D I R T   R O A D  -  D A W N

The Benz ZIPS AROUND a logging truck on a DIRT ROAD.

134.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  D A W N

Schuyler, bleary-eyed, drains coffee from the thermos and tosses it

aside.  He glances over at the sleeping Christine, her head tilted

toward his shoulder; she looks pretty sexy.  He stares at her for a

moment, SIGHS and turns away.

135.  E X T .   O R E G O N   L A K E  -  D A Y

A beautiful Northern lake-- dense forests on the mainland, pines

and fall foliage.  A STORM coming in, ominous CLOUDS.  The Benz is

parked at the shoreline.  MOVE TO FIND Schuyler and Christine, as

they paddle a rowboat toward a small island with a surprisingly

humble, somewhat decrepit cabin on it.  A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.

136.  I N T .   O R E G O N   C A B I N  -  D A Y

CHRISTINE pours a cup of coffee from a metal pot on a wood-burning

stove in which a FIRE CRACKLES.  This cabin is genuinely rustic and

run-down-- hewn wood, fishing rods, cobwebs, rain damage, dust.

WATER DRIPS from the ceiling in a few places.  LIGHTNING FLASHES in

BG through the scene, the STORM has gotten pretty bad.

SCHUYLER finishes taking out his contacts, DROPPING them in cups

full of water. He slips on his glasses, then looks at a few framed

family photos on the coffee table in front of him.  Christine,

barefoot, brings him a cup of coffee, which he sips gratefully.

Schuyler gives her a sidelong glance, looks back at a photo.

ON PHOTO-- he rubs away the dust from a shot showing Schuyler's

father, with young Schuyler, on a boat with fishing equipment.

CHRISTINE takes a step and CRIES out, clutching her foot and

sitting beside Schuyler.  A small FISHHOOK protrudes from her foot,

He talks while he carefully removes the hook from her foot.

He pulls out the hook, puts it aside; she rubs her foot.

SCHUYLER suddenly starts LAUGHING, wipes tears from his eyes.

Christine looks at the photo of MR. VAN ORTON, then at Schuyler.

THE CELL-PHONE CHIRPS, Schuyler shakes off his self-pity, snatches

up the handset.

CHRISTINE mouths, "Who is it?"

During the following, Christine's eyes go wide, she shakes her head

frantically, draws a finger across her throat--

SCHUYLER struggles to absorb the import of this as well as

Christine's behavior.  She shakes her head with a sigh, rises to

refill his coffee cup.

SCHUYLER looks at Christine with horror.  She nods and WHISPERS:

Schuyler HANGS UP, breathing hard, pacing, clutching the phone.

Christine approaches him with a fresh cup of coffee, which he sips.

The PHONE CHIRPS again, Schuyler THROWS it violently against the

wall, it's silenced.  He gulps more coffee, rising again, looking

at the smashed phone, sickened by his own loss of control.

Christine watches him closely.  He keeps balling his hands into

fists as he paces, trying to think out his next play.

He takes a step, stumbles, shakes his head to clear it.  She rises,

picks up his half-empty cup and heads for the kitchen area.  His

gaze follows this, he realizes he's been drugged.

With a CRY OF RAGE he lunges after her, but CRASHES into the wall,

clutching at a hanging ROD, which falls when he does-- he KNOCKS

OVER the table of photos as he goes down, PANTING for air like a

fish out of water, clutching his stomach, nauseated.

HIS POV-- SIDEWAYS, LOW ANGLE.  SFX, BLOOD POUNDING in his head.

Schuyler's eyes FOLLOW the GROOVES of the wet, warped hardwood

floor, they lead to-- and almost seem to point to-- Christine.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE-- from the counter she picks up a small vial

with a bit of powder at the bottom, slips it into her pocket.

SCHUYLER's eyes roll into his head as he struggles against the

effects, tries to get to his hands and knees.  He gasps:

CHRISTINE approaches, stands a few feet away, lights a cigarette,

She crouches by him, flicking ashes a few inches from his nose.

He CLAWS at her helplessly with a GROAN, but misses.  His glasses

fall off, he collapses again.

SCHUYLER'S POV-- everything a BLUR NOW, except in EXTREME FG-- the

photo of himself and his father, which now lies on the floor.

137. FLASH-CUT TO:  FLASHBACK POV-- THE MOMENT OF IMPACT, as MR.

VAN ORTON'S FACE SMASHES into the ground, his GLASSES SHATTERING,

BLOOD SPRAYING from his head.

138. CUT BACK TO:  SCHUYLER writhes, fighting the drug.

139. FLASH-CUT TO:  The moment of his father's jump-- only in this

HALLUCINATION, SCHUYLER himself wears the robe, leaps into space.

140. SCHUYLER'S POV-- FROM FLOOR-- Christine moves INTO FOCUS,

crouches near him, studying her victim almost clinically.

The SFX POUNDING STOPS, and--

BREATHING... THEN SCREAMING, POUNDING and KICKING...

141.  I N T .   C R Y P T  -  D A Y

A WOODEN LID SPLINTERS as SCHUYLER pounds his way out of a COFFIN.

DIM LIGHT through CRACKS in the walls, this is an old and moldering

MAUSOLEUM, other COFFINS nearby.  FRESH FLOWERS surround his

resting place, otherwise everything is completely DECAYED.

By the time SCHUYLER gets out of the coffin, his arms are BLOODIED.

He's been dressed in an ALL-WHITE BURIAL SUIT.  A RED ROSE is TAPED

to his chest.  He blinks and stares about wildly--

HIS POV-- BLURRY, can't make out much.

SCHUYLER blinks, breathing hard, utterly freaked.  He notices the

ROSE on his chest, tears it off, SNIFFS it, then THROWS IT aside

with a frustrated CRY.  He stumbles to the heavy door of the crypt,

tugs, then realizes it opens the other way-- he gives it a PUSH--

142.  E X T .   C E M E T E R Y  -  D A Y

IT COLLAPSES immediately.  SCHUYLER tumbles out of the crypt into

the HOT SUNLIGHT.  He's in a ramshackle city of the dead, a SPANISH

GRAVEYARD.  There are endless rows of TOMBS, rioting tropical

VEGETATION, many FLOWERS, impossibly bright COLORS.  It should be

quite beautiful and peaceful...

He walks around tentatively, SQUINTING.  AN OLD WOMAN in black sits

contemplating a grave, fingering her rosary.  SCHUYLER slips a hand

absently into his pocket, and finds something there, pulls it out--

SCHUYLER'S POV-- BLURRY shot of a NOTE in SPANISH, with a KEY on

the stationery...

SCHUYLER blinks, slips the note in his pocket.

143.  E X T .   C E N T R A L   A M E R I C A N   S T R E E T  -  D A Y

TIGHT SHOT on Schuyler blinking, disoriented, JOSTLED by a sea of

HISPANIC PEOPLE on this busy street.

SCHUYLER'S POV-- WALKING TENUOUSLY.  The world's a BLUR, FACES move

in and out of FOCUS.  They're dark, foreign, many POOR PEOPLE,

poverty-scarred features.  Scraps of SPANISH.  He grabs a DARK MAN.

The man replies with an EXCLAMATION in SPANISH, pushes Schuyler

away, CAMERA TUMBLES--

OBJECTIVE SHOT-- Schuyler's on his knees in the middle of this

third-world thoroughfare, utterly disoriented.  STREET VENDORS sell

weird-looking foods, squads of SQLDIERS march with rifles,

MUSICIANS PLAY odd instruments... Schuyler clutches his head, as if

trying to wish it all away.

A COP IN BEIGE UNIFORM suddenly prods at him with a nightstick,

YELLING AT HIM in SPANISH to move on.

SCHUYLER'S POV-- the COP looming over him, a BLURRY menace, the end

of the nightstick SHARP in FG as it POKES at him.

ANOTHER ANGLE-- Schuyler pleads with the man:

This doesn't seem to help.  He tries to get away from the stick,

but the cop pursues.  He bangs into people as he tries to move

quickly, the stick right behind him.

Schuyler FALLS over a BEGGAR on the ground, in far worse shape than

he is.  The cop YELLS at him.  Schuyler covers his head, holding

out the NOTE WITH THE KEY, which the cop finally snatches away.  He

studies it for a moment, then BARKS with LAUGHTER.

SCHUYLER'S POV-- the cop reaches down to him--

OBJECTIVE ANGLE-- Schuyler cringes, expecting a blow, but the cop

just pulls him to his feet.  He drags him away with him, speaking

more gently IN SPANISH, amused.  Schuyler nods thankfully.

HIGH ANGLE-- the THRONGS on this crowded street.

144.  I N T .   F O R E I G N   P O L I C E   S T A T I O N  -  D A Y

A DESK SERGEANT studies the note, approaching SCHUYLER, whose face

is now red, SUNBURNT.  He sits on a bench with a VAGRANT or two.

SCHUYLER buries his face in his hands, nods.  He's relieved to have

found an English speaker at least.

The sergeant cocks his head, confused.  Indicating the note:

145.  I N T .   A M E R I C A N   E M B A S S Y   L O B B Y  -  D A Y

An Hispanic embassy WORKER behind a desk with a U. S. flag

TRANSLATES THE NOTE aloud in amazed, unaccented English.

ANOTHER ANGLE-- Schuyler, utterly humiliated, sits in a chair on

the other side of the desk.

146.  I N T .   W E I R D   B O D E G A  -  D A Y

A middle-aged Latina-- the BODEGA LADY-- counts out a stack of

bills on the counter, beside Schuyler's watch.  Her store displays

JEWELRY, KNIVES, MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, as well as mystical CANDLES,

POTIONS and BOTTLES with DEAD ANIMALS in formaldehyde.

On the other side of the counter, SCHUYLER Sorts through A BOX OF

EYEGLASSES, trying on different pairs.

The pawn shop owner nods knowingly.  There's one other CUSTOMER, a

shabbily-dressed but honest-looking HONDURAN MAN, looking through a

BIN full of sports equipment.  He seems to have been eavesdropping,

the pawn shop owner now exchanges a few words with him IN SPANISH,

clearly they're coming to some kind of deal.  Meanwhile, Schuyler

puts on a rhinestone-studded pair of woman's glasses, looks around.

Schuyler narrows his eyes at the Honduran man, who flashes a

crooked-toothed smile.

147.  E X T .   G U A T E M A L A N   H I G H W A Y  -  D A W N

A large, covered STAKE TRUCK RUMBLES BY on a hilly jungle highway.

148.  I N T .   S T A K E   T R U C K  -  D A W N

In the back of the truck, Schuyler rides among HUNDREDS OF BAGS of

COFFEE BEANS, marked "CAFE, PRODUCTO DE HONDURAS."  He wears the

silly rhinestone glasses, as well as cheap new clothes-- shorts, a

Spanish message T-shirt, sneakers.  He munches on a mango, peeks

out a hole in the tarp at the passing scenery.

HIS POV-- a VISTA of spectacular beauty, ideally jungle-encrusted

MAYAN RUINS against the backdrop of the rising sun.

SCHUYLER's quite taken with the view, despite his troubles.

149.  E X T .   B O R D E R   C R O S S I N G  -  E V E N I N G

The stake truck is parked at a U. S. BORDER CROSSING in the desert.

The Honduran man-- the truck's driver-- shows his papers to an

INSPECTOR as he walks him to the back of the IDLING truck.

ANGLE FROM INSIDE TRUCK as a tarp is lifted.  The inspector glances

inside, examines a couple of COFFEE BAGS.  IN FG, Schuyler hides

below a bag or two, holding his breath.  The tarp falls again,

Schuyler exhales with relief in the darkness.

150(NEW).  E X T .   B U S   T E R M I N A L  -  N I G H T

MOS, SCHUYLER has been reduced to pan-handling for bus fare in

front of a San Antonio BUS STATION.  An OLDER MAN takes pity, gives

him a bill, he moves on to a couple who shake their heads and avoid

looking at him.  He hurries off at the sight of a disapproving COP.

150B(NEW).  I N T . / E X T .   B U S  -  D A Y

ANGLE ON BUS WINDOW, ARIZONA/UTAH SCENERY reflected in the glass...

POLARIZE to show SCHUYLER through the bus window, exhausted, numbly

taking in the glorious view.

151.  E X T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   H O U S E  -  N I G H T

All seems quiet, the house dark-- late at night.  There's a

movement in the bushes near the street-- SCHUYLER emerges, on the

lookout for any surveillance.  It seems safe.  He digs out a hidden

KEY from within a FAKE ROCK then goes to the front door, gathers up

NEWSPAPERS and a thick stack of MAIL from his box.  He flips

through it quickly, finds a postcard that interests him and shoves

it in his pocket-- the rest of the mail he leaves in the box.  He

punches in his code on the alarm pad, unlocks the door and enters.

CLOSE ON ALARM PAD-- the light goes from GREEN to RED.

152.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   H O U S E  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER blinks as he enters the house-- the graffiti is gone, the

mess cleared up, it actually looks cleaner than ever.

QUICK SHOTS, JUMP-CUTS, the rhythm jarring.  LIGHTS LOW throughout,

Schuyler wants to attract as little attention as possible...

152A(NEW). IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER gobbles handfuls of dry cereal,

grabs for anything he can find in the refrigerator.

153. IN THE SHOWER, Schuyler scrubs away the grime.

154. IN THE BATHROOM, he inserts a CONTACT LENS.

154A. IN A DESK DRAWER he finds a few $20.00 bills.

154B. IN THE BEDROOM-- Schuyler changes into jeans and a sport

jacket, tucking the MONEY and the POSTCARD into the pockets.  As he

turns to leave, he spots something on his dresser--

A WHITE ENVELOPE, with a handwritten "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN..."

SCHUYLER frowns at this. tears it open. reacts with fear...

155. IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER holds the handwritten note to the

BLUE FLAME.  He tosses the BURNING PAGE into the sink.

CLOSE SHOTS on the curling, burning note, we make out KEY WORDS:

"MY FATHER WAS RIGHT," "NO REASON TO CONTINUE," "TAKE MY OWN LIFE,"

"I WANT ONLY DEATH..." and finally the signature, "SCHUYLER VAN

ORTON..."  This suicide note is no joke.

SCHUYLER backs away from the sink.  Quiet, determined:

156.  I N T .   S T U D Y  -  N I G H T

Schuyler moves to a bookshelf, looking for a volume, finds--

CLOSE-- a large, leather-bound BLACK BOOK with no title.

SCHUYLER clutches the volume.  HEADLIGHTS shine in the window, a

VEHICLE in the drive.  Schuyler moves for a back door.

157.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T

A CAR DOOR CLOSES, we see a UNIFORMED FIGURE MOVE O. S., revealing

A POLICE STYLE CREST, the words "CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL SECURITY,"

the initials "CRS" in the center.

SCHUYLER, sneaking around the side of the house, takes this in,

waiting for the RENT-A-COPS with FLASHLIGHTS and WEAPONS to enter

his house.  Then he hurries away, book under his arm.

157A(NEW).  E X T .   P A C I F I C   H E I G H T S   S T R E E T  -  D A W N

UNDER A STREET LAMP on a hilly street, SCHUYLER reaches into his

pocket and squints at THE POSTCARD--

INSERT POSTCARD, the message side:  "S - IT'S SAFE HERE - D."  An

ARROW points to a printed ADDRESS.  Schuyler FLIPS the card over--

a PAINTING of a COLONIAL MANSION down a tree-lined DRIVE...

158.  E X T .   M A N S I O N   G A T E S  -  D A Y

THE SAME VIEW of the same mansion, a very beautiful, peaceful spot.

SCHUYLER moves down the drive toward the entrance.  He carries the

thick book, as he will through following scenes.

159.  I N T .   S A N I T A R I U M   C O R R I D O R  -  D A Y

A NURSE leads Schuyler down a door-lined corridor, no one in sight.

This place turns out to be an incredibly ritzy SANITARIUM.

She KNOCKS at a door, OPENS IT a crack and lets Schuyler in.

160.  I N T .   S A N I T A R I U M   R O O M  -  D A Y

A pleasant bedroom, and safe-- no sharp objects or primary colors

in sight, discreet decorative BARS on the window.

DAVID, in pajamas, sits in a chair, eating bland food from a

plastic lunch tray.  He watches a GOLF MATCH on a tiny WATCHMAN TV,

we'll hear it IN BG-- CLAPPING, etc.  He doesn't react as Schuyler

enters, moves to his side.

David turns to him, half-smiles; food particles on his lips.

Schuyler sits close to David, upset.

David does seem in control now, if a little hazy.

He clutches his brother's hand.  David narrows his eyes, confused.

Schuyler stares at him for a beat-- no getting through.  David

leans forward, turns UP THE TV VOLUME, aiming the set at Schuyler.

ON SCREEN-- a golf ball rolls on a green and PLOPS into the cup.

161.  I N T .   S F   P O L I C E   S T A T I O N  -  D A Y

Barnett, the detective from earlier, has come out to the reception

area to speak with Schuyler, who's trying very hard to be rational.

SCHUYLER narrows his eyes at the question.  GALLO, beyond a METAL

DETECTOR in the rear area of the station, gestures to Barnett, who

holds up a finger.

Moving away, Barnett glances at the leatherbound book, which

Schuyler clutches very possessively.

Barnett purses his lips, nods, steps around the metal detector to

chat with Gallo.

WITH GALLO AND BARNETT

WITH SCHUYLER as GALLO AND BARNETT glance in his direction, gesture

for him to approach.  Gallo WINKS casually at Schuyler.

SCHUYLER, wary now, moves toward them through the METAL DETECTOR--

which GOES OFF with a WHINE.  The ALARM MONITOR woman approaches

with a wand-- but Schuyler steps back, wide-eyed.

SCHUYLER turns and moves quickly for the exit.

He's through the door.  The WHINE OF THE DETECTOR continues as we--

162.  E X T .   B A R T   T R A I N  -  N I G H T

THE WHINE dissolves into the SCREECHING of a TRAIN on an EL TRACK.

163.  I N T .   B A R T   T R A I N  -  N I G H T

LIGHTS FLICKER on and off in a moving train car.

SCHUYLER scribbles intently in a brand new kid's school notebook,

open in his lap.  He sits at the end of the moderately crowded

train car.  Suddenly, he looks up, eyes wild, starts SCANNING the

subway car slowly, sensitive to it all.  By now he's definitely the

sort of person you'd avoid in a public place.

INTERCUT POV with his REACTIONS, as everything falls into place in

his increasingly febrile mind...

SCHUYLER'S POV-- SLOW PAN OVER the assortment of nighttime RIDERS--

a couple of TEENAGERS, an OLDER WOMAN with shopping bags, a DRUNK.

CAMERA PAUSES on a patch of GRAFITTI:  typically unreadable SCRAWL,

but the letters could be CRS.

CAMERA MOVES to the overhead ADVERTISEMENTS:  one for hemrnorhoids,

a seasonal bank ad featuring the EASTER BUNNY... PAUSE ON a PHOTO

of an ecstatic CALIFORNIA LOTTERY WINNER holding up a wad of cash

with the words "YOU CAN'T WIN IF YOU DON'T PLAY."

A MAN READS the SPORTS PAGE:  "GAME FINAL 23-2."

ON THE FLOOR, a CANDY BAR WRAPPER with A GOLD KEY printed on it,

part of a contest.

SCHUYLER picks this up, examines and discards it.

SCHUYLER' S POV-- an ELDERLY MAN with a clunky HEARING AID is

looking at Schuyler with a blank expression.  The man suffers from

a facial TWITCH that causes one eye to BLINK rapidly.

SCHUYLER narrows his eyes at the man, then looks away pointedly.

He puts the notebook into A PLASTIC BAG.  Beneath it, cradled in

his lap, is the mysterious black book.  He opens this carefully--

CLOSE, the book is hollow.  Inside is an expensive HANDGUN.

WIDE SHOT from the next train car-- A FIGURE IN FG is staring

through the scratched, fogged window AT SCHUYLER as he puts the

leather book into the bag with his notebook...

164.  E X T .   B A R T   T R A C K S  -  N I G H T

The train car SHOOTS into a tunnel.

165.  I N T .   B A R T   C A R  -  D A W N

Schuyler is using the plastic bag and his jacket as a pillow, his

eyes closed.  Suddenly there's a KNIFE at his throat.

SCHUYLER starts; the PUNK keeps the knife on him.  He's a young,

glassy-eyed junkie.  He wears a RADIO EARPLUG in one ear, a wire

heading down to his waist.  Schuyler nods, starts studying the

man's arms, heavily TATTOOED with crude cabalistic SYMBOLS.

As Schuyler speaks he sits up, the PUNK grabs the bag-- Schuyler

grabs the guy's knife hand, they wrestle on the floor of the car,

clawing at each other.  The punk drops the knife, it gets knocked

beneath the seat, both men reach for it...

Schuyler and the punk look up to see a TRANSIT COP pointing his

WEAPON.  The punk throws his hands up, scrambles to his feet--

The cop has grabbed the still prone Schuyler, flipping him over and

slapping a handcuff on him--

The cop has dropped his guard; the punk spins and bolts into the

next car, squeezing through the door.  The TRANSIT COP hastily

cuffs Schuyler to an armrest--

He dashes into the next car after the punk.  Schuyler looks at the

floor of the car, sees--

THE SMALL RADIO and its EARPLUG attached by a WIRE.  The radio has

a tiny LOOP/RABBIT EAR antenna on it.  He snatches it up, then

YANKS at the cuff.  He spots the knife under the seat, grabs it,

starts using the blade to unscrew the armrest from its post.

FROM THE NEXT CAR he hears SHOUTS, SCREAMS, a serious commotion

going on, he doesn't know who's winning.  Schuyler's almost gotten

free as the TRAIN SLOWS, when--

--the DOOR at the far end of the car opens, it's the PUNK, bruised

and bloody, ready to kill.

He lunges at Schuyler just as he PRIES THE ARMREST off the seat and

CLOBBERS him with it.  The punk reels back.  The train has stopped,

the doors have opened-- Schuyler grabs his bag and squeezes out

onto the platform just before they shut again.

166.  I N T .   B A R T   S T A T I O N  -  D A Y

SCHUYLER locks the free cuff on to the same wrist as the other,

sliding his jacket over them, moving briskly up the stairs.

167.  E X T .   B E R K E L E Y   S T R E E T  -  D A Y

SCHUYLER emerges and walks quickly, checking over his shoulder,

BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT MORNING SUN.  He fiddles with the RADIO, the

PLUG to his ear.  We hear STATIC, BLEEPING NOISES, FILTERED VOICES.

For a few moments the VOICES ON THE RADIO become CLEARER.

SCHUYLER listens intently, leaning against a wall in the shadows,

breathing hard.  He stares nervously at a couple of nearby STREET

PEOPLE huddled by a shopping cart, they stare back.  Another VOICE

on the radio talks OVER the first:

We hear the HYSTERICAL GIGGLING of ROBIN QUIVERS.  SCHUYLER blinks,

recognizing the voice of RADIO DJ HOWARD STERN.

SCHUYLER fiddles frantically with the dial and antennas, calling up

RANDOM RADIO MUSIC, COMMERCIALS, etc.

CLOSE ON A TRASH CAN-- Schuyler tosses his hollowed leather book

into it.  It falls open, we see the gun is gone.

168(NEW).  I N T .   H O S P I C E  -  D A Y

TRACK DOWN an institutional corridor, a few EMACIATED PATIENTS in

wheelchairs... they only come here to die.  ELIZABETH, Schuyler's

ex, 4Oish, fit and attractive, a few months pregnant, READS to a

couple of sad PATIENTS in a lounge area.  She trails off as she

looks up, astonished to see--

SCHUYLER, bruised, frightened, almost looking like he belongs here.

168A(NEW).  I N T .   S P O R T S   C A R  -  D A Y

Elizabeth backs out of a parking lot in a 3OO-ZX CONVERTIBLE and

pulls into traffic, Schuyler beside her, babbling emotionally.

169.  I N T .   B R E A K F A S T   P L A C E  -  D A Y

ELIZABETH FLIPS THE PAGES of Schuyler's notebook-- page after page

of psychotic-looking scribbling, dense UNDERLINES, many EXCLAMATION

POINTS.  ON ONE PAGE-- "

WIDER-- a few BUSINESS PEOPLE read papers, pick at eggs; A LARGE-

SCREEN TV plays MORNING PROGRAMS.  Schuyler stares at Elizabeth,

awaiting reaction... she seems incapable of speech.  He puts the

tiny radio and earplug on the table between them.

Elizabeth picks the thing up, studies it, puts the plug to her ear.

Schuyler waves dismissively, "you don't understand," takes the

radio back from her and pockets it.

She stares at him, trying to be strong, but she's very freaked out.

A BARMAID brings their order.  Schuyler stares at the barmaid

suspiciously as she puts a cup of coffee before Elizabeth, and

gives him a bottle of water and a glass.  He tests the seal.

He watches her as she retreats, leans toward Elizabeth, puts his

hand on top of her cup.

Schuyler opens the bottle and drinks straight from it thirstily.

Elizabeth registers the CLINKING HANDCUFFS on his left wrist.

A CELL-PHONE RINGS in her purse, she makes an exasperated noise and

pulls it out, with a "one sec" gesture at Schuyler.  He rises

during her conversation, a new look on his face-- he can't trust

her either.

Schuyler's distracted by something on the TV... he lets out a

STRANGLED CRY.  Elizabeth turns her head to see.

ON TV SCREEN-- It's JIM FEINGOLD, clutching his head, rubbing his

temples with a look of pain.  CHEESY MUSIC, THROBBING SPFX.

SCHUYLER approaches the set, shouting at it.

Elizabeth gets up, tries to pull him back to the booth, he pushes

her away, not taking his eyes from the set.  PATRONS react

nervously to the deranged man.

THE TV IMAGE WIDENS, a COMMERCIAL ACTRESS rubs Feingold's neck.

The actress CLUCKS her tongue, shakes her head.

SCHUYLER's starting to get the picture.

ON TV-- Feingold holds up a colorfully marked bottle of pills,

studies them with a shit-eating grin.  SOOTHING MUSIC.

FEINGOLD gives way to the image of A BOX OF AMBUTOL.

SCHUYLER lets Elizabeth escort him back near the booth.  He's

completely absorbed in his own thoughts.

He shakes his head, waves his hand dismissively.  He's thinking

about something else.  Elizabeth starts dialing.

Schuyler tries to sound normal, claps her on the arm.  WHILE HE

TALKS, CAMERA FINDS Schuyler's other hand, which slips stealthily

into her PURSE, lying on the seat of the booth.

He moves quickly down a corridor marked RESTROOMS and EMERGENCY

EXIT.  She looks after him, quite puzzled, phone still to her ear.

170.  E X T .   R E S T A U R A N T   P A R K I N G   L O T  -  D A Y

Schuyler emerges from a back exit, looking behind him, the

EMERGENCY ALARM SOUNDING.  He twirls Elizabeth's car keys on his

finger as he jogs toward her sports car.  He unlocks it and the

ALARM SCREAMS for a moment before he figures out how to shut it

off, then he starts it and PEELS OUT.

Elizabeth's car zips through traffic in a Chinatown neighborhood

full of festive restaurants and shops.

SCENE 174 DELETED

175.  E X T .   T U N G   H O Y  -  D A Y

Hanging red ducks in the window, a SIGN with a phone number in the

window:  "TUNG HOY-- WE DELIVER" in English and Chinese.  SCHUYLER

argues with an OLD CHINESE WOMAN behind the counter--

175A(NEW).  I N T .   T U N G   H O Y  -  D A Y

A cramped, funky restaurant, rows of CELEBRITY HEAD SHOTS on a wall

behind the delivery counter.  SCHUYLER pursues the CHINESE WOMAN as

she serves bowls of noodles to a CHINESE FAMILY.

Schuyler stalks away from her, finds himself facing the wall of

signed photographs--

ON WALL, old and stained pictures, the most famous being the likes

of ED McMAHON and CHARO.  Among them is a newer HEAD SHOT of

FEINGOLD with a shit-eating grin... below, the name WILLIAM FISHER.

SCHUYLER leaps on the counter and tears the photo off the wall--

Schuyler's already leapt off the counter, bolts out the door.

175B(NEW).  I N T .   E L I Z A B E T H ' S   C A R  -  D A Y

SCHUYLER is on the CARPHONE, glances from the road to--

THE OBVERSE OF THE HEAD SHOT in his hand, a PHONE NUMBER before the

(short) list of credits, he flips it to show Feingold/Fisher.

SCHUYLER looks annoyed at what he's hearing.

He makes a quick U-TURN, the tires SCREECHING.

SCENES 176-179 DELETED

180.  E X T .   Z O O  -  D A Y

Late afternoon.  PAN FROM THE ENTRANCE to find SCHUYLER buying a

ticket and hurrying in.

181. IN THE ZOO, Schuyler prowls the crowd with manic energy.

SCHUYLER'S POV-- ZOO-GOERS gazing at the ANIMALS... CAMERA FINDS

Feingold/Fisher, wearing casual clothes, eating a popsicle.  He's

doing his best to supervise THREE OBNOXIOUS CHILDREN, two boys and

an older girl.  He's just another dad at the zoo, far from

impressive-- the Wizard of Oz after the curtain's been pulled.

When he makes eye contact with Schuyler, he pales, trying to herd

the children together as Schuyler moves in on him... he can't get

away.  Schuyler grabs the man's shirt.

Schuyler releases him, Feingold sheepishly avoids his eyes.

Schuyler casually shows him the gun, the man's eyes widen.

He dangles the bill over their heads, the KIDS CHEER, leap like

dolphins after fish.  The girl's tallest, grabs the cash, they run

for a nearby concession.  Schuyler and Feingold stroll together.

FEINGOLD'S BOYS ARE THROWING ROCKS at the monkeys.  They give their

father a look and saunter along.

SCHUYLER's not interested in the zoo drama.

Schuyler takes this in for a moment, thinking.

Schuyler cocks his head, steps in front of him.  Right in his face:

Feingold gets the message.

182.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  N I G H T

LIGHTS OFF in the building.  A battered STATION WAGON rounds a

corner, PAUSES before the ramp to the garage entrance-- the same

garage he and Christine were once tormented in.

183.  I N T .   S T A T I O N   W A G O N  -  N I G H T

FEINGOLD drives, looking very tense; a kiddie seat strapped next to

him, junk galore; he's apparently alone.

BEHIND THE SEAT-- Schuyler crouches under a blanket.

183A.  I N T .   C R S   G A R A G E  -  N I G H T

The station wagon stops at the bottom of the ramp.  A BEEFY GATE

GUARD behind glass glares at Feingold, who waves timidly.  The

STEEL GATE RISES and the station wagon drives in.

THE STATION WAGON parks near an elevator bank; a handful of CARS, a

few white CRS SECURITY VEHICLES and VANS parked nearby.  Feingold

climbs out, trying hard not to look scared.  ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN

and a beefy, frightening-looking SECURITY MAN in a suit steps out.

He looks around carefully as Feingold joins him.  He takes

Feingold's arm and pulls him toward the elevator.  They wait.

SCHUYLER'S POV from the back seat-- just as the DOORS OPEN, the

Gate Guard steps up behind Feingold, puts a gun in his back.

HE FIRES-- Schuyler glimpses a SPRAY OF BLOOD, Feingold collapses.

The Security Man grabs the body as it falls, starts dragging it out

of sight while the Gate Guard puts a hand to his ear, talks into a

mini-transmitter in his other hand.  He follows the Security Man

out of sight.  The elevator doors remain open.

With the guards out of sight, Schuyler rises slowly.  He looks

stunned and sickened as he lets himself out cautiously, sneaking

behind vehicles.  The main gate is sealed, he has no idea how long

the guards will be gone.  THE OPEN ELEVATOR DOORS beckon.

Schuyler crawls on his belly the last few yards, starts, finding--

CLOSE, a RUBBER BUG on its back.

SCHUYLER creeps military style, on hands and knees, the rest of the

way to the elevator.  He puts a hand in some of Feingold's BLOOD,

winces, then gets in the elevator.

184.  I N T .   C R S   E L E V A T O R  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER presses the button for 12-- the top floor.

ON PANEL-- nothing happens, the button LIGHTS for an instant but

GOES OUT again.  The elevator won't move.

SCHUYLER's getting exasperated.

ON PANEL-- he tries BUTTONS allover, same story.

ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the gate guard jogs TOWARD the elevators,

pulling his gun.

SCHUYLER starts to panic, pulls his own gun and POINTS IT AT THE

GUARD, who freezes and raises his hands.  Behind him, the Security

Man approaches Schuyler from a different angle, his gun out.

Schuyler can't get a bead on both of them.

Schuyler looks one more time at the elevator panel--

AT BASE OF PANEL, a gold keyhole.  CLOSER-- the letters CRS are

printed beneath it, very small.

SCHUYLER shakes his head-- it couldn't be; but what else can he do?

ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the guards are fanning out and getting closer.

SCHUYLER reaches with one hand for his keys, fumbling for the small

gold key he received at the start of the game.

ON PANEL-- his hand shakes as he tries to insert the gold key... it

fits into the hole; he turns it and PUSHES THE BUTTON for 12.

WIDER-- as the DOORS CLOSE, both guards train their guns-- but too

late.  Schuyler's on his way up.

184A. THE GLASS ELEVATOR RISES through completely blackened spaces.

SCHUYLER stares at a BULLET HOLE in the back of the glass elevator,

a remnant of Feingold's murder.  He holds the gun in front of

himself in both hands... then he closes his eyes, steeling himself,

almost in an attitude of prayer.

185.  I N T .   A T R I U M  -  N I G H T

PITCH BLACK but for the LIT ELEVATOR ascending swiftly through the

darkness... Schuyler, like a solitary spaceship pilot, looks upward

toward his unknown destination.

186.  I N T .   C R S   E L E V A T O R  -  N I G H T

The DIGITAL READOUT slows as it comes to 10, 11 and STOPS at 12.

SCHUYLER comes out of his trance, slips the revolver back into his

jacket pocket, keeps a hand there, and stands against a wall of the

elevator as the DOORS OPEN ON--

187.  I N T .   1 2 T H   F L O O R   C O M M I S S A R Y  -  N I G H T

--A BUSTLING, NOISY COMMISSARY.  Schuyler keeps the gun concealed

as he steps out of the elevator-- nobody here is paying any

attention to him anyway.  There's a cafeteria style counter along

one wall, people CHATTING and LAUGHING at Formica tables... amongst

others, everyone from his game appears to be here... there's the

RASTA, the PARAMEDICS with the HEART ATTACK VICTIM, JOHN and PETE

from the men's club, the GIRL from the boat, the DESK CLERK and

BELLHOP... also the HONDURAN TRUCK DRIVER, the SECURITY PEOPLE from

his house, the PUNK and the TRANSIT COP... and a lot of ENGINEERS.

SCHUYLER inches into the room, meets the eyes of--

CHRISTINE, who's just come away from the cafeteria counter with a

tray of food.  She nearly drops it, looks over her shoulder to see

if anyone is watching.  Suddenly, Schuyler is in front of her,

backs her into an alcove-- she holds the tray between them as if to

protect herself.

For a moment, Schuyler's not sure.  His voice is flat, monotonal:

Even though she's keeping a surface cool, he notices the GLASS and

SILVERWARE on her tray RATTLING.  She starts to move toward a

table, he blocks her path.

Schuyler shows her his BLOOD-STAINED HAND.  Christine looks utterly

perplexed, then shrugs, finding a place to put down her tray.

He pushes his palm in her face, she flinches, swipes him away, then

puts a finger to her ear as--

THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and the guard and security man from

downstairs burst into the commissary.

Suddenly the ROOM QUIETS, many others are touching their ears.

They all TURN in the direction of Schuyler and Christine.  The gate

guard gestures at Schuyler, attempting a smile.

Schuyler grabs Christine, wraps an arm around her throat, puts his

GUN to her neck.

He uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally

toward the nearest door, she CHOKES and GASPS.

188.  I N T .   S T A I R W E L L  -  N I G H T

The door shuts behind them, the stairs only lead UP.

Christine STOMPS his foot and ELBOWS his gut, breaks free and bolts

up the stairs.  Schuyler catches his breath and pursues.  Beneath

him, the stairwell door opens, GUARDS PURSUE.

189.  E X T .   C R S   R O O F  -  N I G H T

A HIGH LEDGE surrounds the roof on all four sides, a ROOF ENTRANCE

at each side as well.  The NUMBER "636" is painted large for

helicopters; there are air conditioning vents, ducts, etc.  A

MUFFLED ALARM sounds as Christine bursts through the door, followed

by Schuyler.  She spins, her back to the EDGE of the atrium, a

black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken GLASS SKYLIGHT, a

white RAILING around it.

Schuyler SLAMS the door, a large number 1 painted on it in BLUE.

He throws the HEAVY BOLT.  He and Christine circle each other

warily, his gun trained on her.  POUNDING from the other side,

MUFFLED VOICES that can't be heard.

For the first time, Christine focuses on the gun in his hand, then

clutches the railing.

Schuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child:

Christine touches her ear, listening to something, then puts her

hand to her mouth, speaks urgently.

Schuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the EAR PIECE and

HAND MIKE away from Christine, the wire tears her blouse open.

Christine's desperately panicked, fumbling for words.

Schuyler hesitates a moment, looking in the direction of the door.

ON THE DOOR-- POUNDING DESPERATE, but the ALARM DROWNS out the

sounds of VOICES on the other side.

SCHUYLER turns quickly as she takes a step towards him.  He points

the gun at her again.  He looks ready to use it.  The following

DIALOG overlaps and collides, growing AURAL CHAOS--

AXES DENT the metal door, which BULGES.

He looks at the monitor in his hand, the one he tore from her body,

putting it in his own ear, letting the rest of the device dangle.

Schuyler runs a hand over his sweating forehead, the gun TREMBLING

in his hand.  Christine's regaining control.  Schuyler's mind

whirls, he GROANS, almost crying as he considers for the first time

that she might be telling the truth.  She steps closer.

He looks at her, almost ready to lower the gun.  He raises his

bloody hand to his lips, about to taste it.

Schuyler's eyes dart toward--

ANOTHER DOORWAY, on the other side of the atrium, like the one

that's bolted.  The number 2 is painted on it in RED.  The handle

starts to TURN just as--

--CHRISTINE LUNGES AT HIM to wrest the gun away.

SCHUYLER comes to his senses, struggling.  The GUN GOES OFF, the

report should be DEAFENING.

He spins, points the gun at Door #2 and FIRES again, several times.

THE ALARM STOPS-- SILENCE.

Christine STIFFENS, falls backwards onto the ground, clutching her

BLOOD-DRENCHED stomach.  Schuyler just stares.  Dark blood SPILLS

from her mouth as she CHOKES in pain...

DOOR #2 OPENS and--

DAVID steps through.  He wears a brightly colored, silly looking

PARTY HAT, carries a magnum of CHAMPAGNE bearing a huge BOW that

reads, "SURPRISE."  BLOOD PUMPS from HIS CHEST.  He DROPS THE

BOTTLE, which SHATTERS... David collapses amidst the broken glass.

A BLOW OF THE AXE SEVERS the deadbolt and Door #1 flies open behind

Schuyler.  FEINGOLD is the first of a group to come charging

through, he wears a TUXEDO with a ROSE in the lapel, holds the axe.

SCHUYLER spins, points the gun at this axe-wielding man, then,

utterly stunned, lowers it in disbelief.

FEINGOLD looks from Schuyler to the wounded Christine-- her agony

is painful to watch.  He drops the axe with a CLATTER and runs to

her side, kneels.  His voice CRACKS.

THE GUARD and SECURITY MAN come out on the roof looking very

disturbed, followed by the RASTA and a few OTHERS.  Many are

dressed for a party now.  Feingold looks to their horrified faces.

The Rasta dashes downstairs.  Schuyler backs away, drops the gun,

staggers over to David.  He's GASPING for breath.  CRS EMPLOYEES

give the brothers a wide berth, move toward Feingold and Christine.

David's already DEAD, eyes wide, body limp.

WITH FEINGOLD and CHRISTINE.  He holds his colorful cummerbund over

her stomach to staunch the bleeding.  She CHOKES in pain.

They stare over at Schuyler, registering David's death.  Schuyler

is now drenched in his brother's blood, rocking him in his arms.

Most of the assorted CRS people move to get out of the building

before the cops show, MURMURING amongst themselves in fear.

CHRISTINE yells at Schuyler, unable to stand--

SCHUYLER gently lowers his brother and rises, like a zombie now.

The big security man picks up his gun and backs away with it,

keeping it out of his reach.

Schuyler backs away from the body, starts to SHAKE, looks as if he

really has lost his mind.  Feingold SOBS aloud.

Schuyler looks back and forth from the wounded Christine-- who

GASPS silent curses, beyond speech-- to David's body...

He slowly turns to the Atrium pit directly in front of him.  He's

strangely calm...

SHIFT TO SLOW MOTION:

SCHUYLER moves for the edge of the atrium pit...

THE OTHERS react in HORROR, SHOUT "NO!!", lunging TOWARD HIM...

DAVID'S HEAD suddenly MOVES, he BLINKS...

SCHUYLER leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit.

CHRISTINE jumps to her feet, perfectly alert, a hand extended,

SCREAMING, just as--

SCHUYLER CATAPULTS HIMSELF INTO SPACE, and--

DAVID SITS BOLT UPRIGHT.

SCHUYLER sees this, too late--

HE AND DAVID make terrified, helpless eye contact across the void,

arms outstretched.  Schuyler has time to register his irrevocable

error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for an

agonizing MOMENT.

THEN HE FALLS...  LEAVE SLOW MOTION.

190.  I N T .   A T R I U M  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER CRASHES through the skylight, TUMBLING-- SPARKLING SHARDS

surround him like stars as he PLUNGES, SPINS, SCREAMING.

191. RAPID CUTS-- the CLOWN, CHRISTINE's face, SCHUYLER and DAVID

as CHILDREN, HIS FATHER's head striking the landing.  These FLASH

PAST so rapidly we can't quite process them.

192. INTERCUT WITH:  INCREASING DARKNESS, GROUND RUSHING CLOSER...

ON SCHUYLER'S FACE as he experiences the epiphany that comes before

the end.  BRILLIANT ANGELIC LIGHT suddenly illuminates him, his

eyes roll into his head, closing--

ANGLE FROM ABOVE-- the LIGHTS are real, they've COME ON to show--

SCHUYLER'S IMPACT-- he LANDS on his back, arms outstretched, eyes

squeezed shut--

--and is swallowed by an ENORMOUS INFLATED LIFESAVING CUSHION that

covers the floor of the atrium.

SCHUYLER BOUNCES in the cushion a few times, gradually coming to a

rest, harmless bits of BREAKAWAY GLASS showering down around him.

He doesn't move a muscle, his eyes still closed.

CLOSER ON HIS FACE... muscles twitch.  His eyes open.

HIS POV-- UP the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of the

building around the atrium.  THE FULL MOON in the very center

through the hole in the glass.

All the lighted GLASS ELEVATORS COME TO EARTH, packed with people.

SCHUYLER stares upward, mouth open, motionless.

DAVID comes running from an elevator, leaps up onto the cushion and

bounces over to Schuyler, a huge smile on his face.

Getting no response, David hops closer, squats by Schuyler's side.

SCHUYLER remains motionless, David's worried now, grabs his arm and

starts shaking him.

SCHUYLER begins to LAUGH, a tremendous catharsis.  DAVID laughs

too, greatly relieved as he helps Schuyler to his feet.

THE TWO BROTHERS clutch each other for support on the BOUNCING

surface, LAUGHING.  CRS EMPLOYEES have gathered around the cushion,

CHEERING and APPLAUDING.

SCHUYLER wipes his eyes, shaking his head with amazement.  Then he

hauls back and SLUGS DAVID in the jaw, sending him flying onto his

back on the cushion.  MORE CHEERS from the crowd, as if they were

watching a boxing match.

193.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  N I G H T

THE HALLELUJAH CHORUS from Handel's "Messiah" plays.  SCHUYLER and

DAVID enter together from the atrium, the CUSHION deflates behind

them.  David licks blood from his lips, rubs his jaw.

Schuyler half-smiles.  The SECURITY MAN unlocks Schuyler's

handcuffs, giving him back his gun, which Schuyler stares at.

They turn a corner into the main lobby, Schuyler absently pockets

the gun, looks up in wonder...

SCHUYLER'S POV-- a SURPRISE PARTY:  A STEREO, STREAMERS and

BALLOONS, a CHAMPAGNE FOUNTAIN, CAKE and FOOD.  CRS EMPLOYEES

(mostly ordinary-looking office workers) CLAP and CHEER for

Schuyler.  They wear PARTY HATS, blow PLASTIC HORNS.

SMILING PEOPLE eager to offer CONGRATULATIONS surround him.  He's

pretty shaky, like a newborn calf.  JOHN and PETE shake his hand.

The RASTA SLAPS his back, Schuyler instinctively looks over his

shoulder for a gag message.

The RECEPTIONIST POPS a bottle of Dom Perignon, hands it to Sky.

Not knowing what else to do, Schuyler takes a slug.  The GIRL from

the boat KISSES his cheek.  TECHNICIANS, men with STUNTS UNLIMITED

T-SHIRTS, the NURSE from the asylum, the SECURITY PEOPLE, CRS

GUARDS, AGENTS, all want a piece of him at once.

The "MESSIAH" FADES and an R & B BAND breaks into ROUSING MUSIC as

Feingold approaches and sticks a CIGAR in his mouth, LIGHTS it.

Christine approaches, wobbly and dazed herself; she touches his

arm.  Her voice is soft for the first time, accents gone.

He gives her a DRAG on his cigar.

She shrugs, blows a SMOKE RING and sticks her finger through it.

She winks and strolls off.  Schuyler smiles, looking after her.

DANCING is starting up IN BG.  A clutch of non-CRS people approach

tentatively-- including PLYMPTON, ELIZABETH, MARIA and JACK.  They

all look very confused.

Schuyler LAUGHS, gives her a hug, surprising her.  He still has a

giddy smile plastered on his face.

He moves away quickly.

SCENES 194-197 DELETED

198(NEW).  I N T .   M E N ' S   R O O M  -  N I G H T

SCHUYLER FLUSHES and moves away from a urinal.  David waits a few

feet away by the sinks and mirrors; Schuyler starts slightly.

David pulls out A COLORED ENVELOPE, slips it into Schuyler's shirt.

Schuyler looks at him curiously as he dries his hands.

CAMERA FOLLOWS as David hurries out of the rest room, Schuyler

behind him, flipping pages of a long, long bill--

199(NEW).  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  N I G H T

--we rejoin the PARTY, which is now in full swing.  Schuyler stands

alone at the periphery of the dance floor with the bill.  He hits

the bottom line... he blinks and GASPS.

CHRISTINE appears, taking his hand and pulling him away.

They move into a stairwell and start climbing O. S., their hands

all over each other.  We hear the MUSIC and FESTIVITIES continuing

in BG.

CAMERA HOLDS for a beat on a SIGN painted on the wall with an arrow

upward:  "LEVEL 2..."
