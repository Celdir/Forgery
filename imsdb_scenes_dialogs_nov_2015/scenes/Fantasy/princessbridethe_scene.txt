The Princess Bride by William Goldman - 1987 Shooting Draft

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

FADE IN ON:

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's

seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,

presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's

hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.

We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,

somewhere in the suburbs.

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his

pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's

worried, it doesn't show. During this

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            2.

The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of

rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package

tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,

pinches his cheek.

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother

ignores it, beats a retreat.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

THE GRANDFATHER

Suddenly passionate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            3.

THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed.

The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of

the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English

countryside.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            4.

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while

in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at

her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about

clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't

as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the

most beautiful woman in the world.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.

And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her

as she walks away.

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large

buckets near him.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he

manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            5.

BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to

each other gazing into each other's eyes.

Now he turns, moves outside.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red

glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss.

THE KID'S ROOM

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            6.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace.

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly

around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup

watches him go.

CLOSE UP: Buttercup, staring out the window of her room.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            7.

HOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad.

FLORIN CASTLE - DAY

The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople,

livestock, and a bustling marketplace.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing,

standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three

others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the

aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the

Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.

And the answering YESSSS booms like summer thunder.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            8.

A giant staircase leading to the CROWD and as a FIGURE just

begins to become visible,

THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if

there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd,

collectively, holds its breath.

THE STAIRCASE, as the figure appears in the archway. It is

Buttercup. And she resplendent.

She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people.

THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no

instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees. Great

waves of people kneeling and --

BUTTERCUP, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her

subjects, blinking back tears. HOLD on her beauty for a

moment.

WOODLANDS

-- and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse

easily.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            9.

A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them

can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are

not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a

tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his

name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as

a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a

giant. His name is FEZZIK.

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,

touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a

scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.

As she starts to fall --

A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.

Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket

and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There

is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill

and precision.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10.

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11.

CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows

on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very

distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts

off.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

As Vizzini screams we:

THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the

princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?

Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are

only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

Inigo nods, glances back.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the

wind whistles. And the waves pound.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14.

And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately

to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.

Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.

Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good

distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the

gap.

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI

staring at the other boat.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

THE BOAT

and Vizzini screaming.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.

BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent

breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new

is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.

Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

THE BOAT

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The

shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.

Buttercup stays silent.

THE BOAT

BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is

louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,

something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she

makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.

-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,

starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of

any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,

it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made

such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp

down --

And the second we hear him:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's

gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.

He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the

book.

VIZZINI

We're back in the boat.

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

BUTTERCUP

treading water.

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,

Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to

clamp down as we

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           18.

A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily

lifting Buttercup.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

INIGO

pointing behind them.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black

sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being

sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be

flying.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.

And once he's said the name--

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high.

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is

closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was

too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great

precision straight at the Cliffs

THE BOAT

being pursued.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,

economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a

jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick

rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope

a freeing swing and

THE CLIFFS

The rope goes all the way to the top.

INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts

Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself

gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like

papooses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20.

And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along

with him as he goes.

THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity,

watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments

of dawn.

THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is

the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and

it's a gasper.

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with

fear.

THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's

already over a third of the way done.

THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's

impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he

didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over

hand like lightning.

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21.

THE MAN IN BLACK

roaring up the rope, and

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead.

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

And his arms begin moving much more slowly.

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded

up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22.

THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now.

THE MAN IN BLACK

less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining.

THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT!

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the

rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the

Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting

for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some

stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind

of resemble Stonehenge.

THE MAN IN BLACK

feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and

his pace is as dazzling as before, and

VIZZINI

cutting through the last of the rope and

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the

Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.

FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23.

THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to

the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life.

VIZZINI

stunned, turning to the others, looking down.

THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards,

sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

The group at the top, staring down.

Inigo nods.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24.

THE MAN IN BLACK

still creeping his way upward.

FEZZIK

who goes to Inigo.

FEZZIK nods, hurries after Vizzini.

INIGO

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the

Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands

loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is

a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for

waiting around.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           25.

THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than

when last we saw him. Inigo is watching.

INIGO

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to

talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but

neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our

two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what

it is.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few

perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the

edge again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his

strength.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.

He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice

takes on a tone we have not heard before.

THE MAN IN BLACK.

There is a pause. Then, quietly:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of

the cliff.

INIGO

now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and

hurls it over --

THE ROPE

It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks,

grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then

looks up at Inigo and --

INIGO

straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily,

and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to

Inigo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held

the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see

several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears

gloves. Inigo stares at them.

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           29.

He touches his scars.

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.

And on that word --

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest

sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later

on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the

swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they

look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time

one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and

there is silence, and as they start to circle --

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

THE TWO MEN

finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes

so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In

Black retreating up a rocky incline.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.

And he shifts his style now.

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated

castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the

perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and

lands facing his opponent.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,

never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the

battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the

other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that

this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more

that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're

in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"

battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,

the action begins going even faster than before as we

INIGO

And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the

deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and

ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for

long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,

keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being

forced toward it.

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and

immediately, the tide of battle turns.

THE MAN IN BLACK

stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff

edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now

faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he

increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33.

A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and

the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he

can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a

frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every

thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.

Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves

but they are nothing.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,

pinned there under the six fingered sword.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully

joined.

INIGO

And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.

He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the

same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And

before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked

clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar

suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and

scrambles to his sword and we

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the

landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black

copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.

He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus

performer and dismounts with a backflip.

INIGO

staring in awe.

INIGO

moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,

darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even

than before, and again he slashes but --

INIGO

And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,

and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with

the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's

feet moving with the grace and speed of a great

improvisational dancer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35.

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

INIGO

catching it again. And something terrible is written behind

his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,

tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't

enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization

that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling

everything and

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a

moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his

eyes.

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo

pitches forward unconscious.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

CLOSE UP: VIZZINI

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far

below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying

the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the

morning.

A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large

boulder nearby.

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and

we --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.

THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.

He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he

rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a

boulder inches in front of him.

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another

rock and holds it lightly.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,

takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward

the Giant.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.

He flips the rock away.

THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN

The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But

it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so

much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives

at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the

stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a

beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any

number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.

Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at

the Giant.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size

and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,

spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he

moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the

Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves

right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to

his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back

and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's

throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one

behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and

just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the

entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,

but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.

ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH

Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,

and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the

rough boulder.

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as

if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,

but he doesn't, he holds on.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only

this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to

slowly collapse.

FEZZIK

and there isn't much breath coming.

THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,

but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there

for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In

Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But

there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies

still.

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's

heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it

and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed

WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless

in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and

maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,

maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into

strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is

miming the fencers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.

And he gallops off --

THE MAN IN BLACK

cresting the peak of the mountain.

CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini

munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's

throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and

between them, a small leather wine container. And some

cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely

spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all

the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,

slows. The two men study each other. Then --

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's

unprotected throat.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.

BUTTERCUP'S THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against

the pain.

THE MAN IN BLACK

stopping fast.

The Man In Black nods.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.

Another nod.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the

Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing

it to Vizzini.

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,

turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces

Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game

maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other

in front of himself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.

He studies the Man In Black now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man

In Black's has been fast disappearing.

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In

Black.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47.

THE MAN IN BLACK

turning around, looking.

VIZZINI

busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his

head turned.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to

laugh.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the

one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini

hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows

his wine.

THE MAN IN BLACK

There's nothing he can say. He just sits there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           48.

VIZZINI

watching him.

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all

ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings

off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet.

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled

terrain.

And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           49.

A MOUNTAIN PATH

It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK

TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of

misplaced sand. The others wait behind him.

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off.

A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging

Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her

along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go

of her.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches,

but does not retreat.

VIZZINI'S BODY

The picnic is spread as before.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body

as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison

packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           51.

BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In

Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer

ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine

floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

The Man In Black says nothing.

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now.

THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52.

BUTTERCUP

And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be

tears.

Buttercup nods.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on

the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his

attention and as he stares at it briefly,

HIS P.O.V.:

The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up

into the sky.

BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high,

she pushes him with all the strength she has.

THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins

to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           54.

Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward

the flat rock floor of the ravine.

BUTTERCUP

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far

below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,

she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is

falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,

cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

THE DUST CLOUD

rising.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot

where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.

The Prince shakes his head.

COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           55.

THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of

course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After

a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he

does,

BUTTERCUP

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and

loving and gentle and --

THE KID'S BEDROOM

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up.

HUMPERDINCK AND HIS MEN

perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and

Buttercup.

WESTLEY

BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like

nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.

As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,

defeated.

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,

sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great

trees block the sun.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but

he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell

and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight

popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses

Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the

lower half of her is and --

WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming

hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This

isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he

does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.

He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her

feet --

THE SWAMP FLOOR

-- and as there's another popping sound,

WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame

suddenly shoots up.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently

leads her forward as we-

THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of

the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different

angle.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.

There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.

Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves

her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking

without missing a beat.

SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his

sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as

they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water

that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she

steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch

of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she

sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is

gone as we --

WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still

connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,

and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the

lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,

but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning

sand, lovely and lethal.

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is

suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into

view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably

no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs

around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.

THE LIGHTNING SAND

as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes

out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls

to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,

her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but

you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues

to pull them to safety --

THE R.0.U.S.

high above them; it watches --

BUTTERCUP

placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning

sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and

THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.

Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The

have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he

encouragingly goes on talking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62.

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from

offscreen.

BUTTERCUP

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend

it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He

howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.

He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the

R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just

when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly

rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,

changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing

only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small

branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the

thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her

hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.

WESTLEY

jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,

sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.

WESTLEY

with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He

tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound --

A FLAME SPURT

shooting skyward and --

WESTLEY

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts

into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs

his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is

trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,

exhausted. The danger has passed.

BUTTERCUP

relieved.

THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP

Beyond, a beach.

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.

And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,

and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED:

Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS,

armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup

and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to

leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.

Westley looks worse.

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others.

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other; then something else catches

her eye and we --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65.

AN ARMED WARRIOR

in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart.

BUTTERCUP

looking the other way --

ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley.

BUTTERCUP

frantically staring around, and now

A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a

tree blocking any escape Westley might try.

HUMPERDINCK

whirling to face her.

WESTLEY

whirling to face her.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           66.

BUTTERCUP

talking to them both.

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

staring deep into each other's eyes.

HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67.

Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off

her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go.

WESTLEY

staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring

Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it

in his hand.

Westley is looking at him.

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley

starts to fall --the screen goes black.

FADE IN ON:

THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering

torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the

cage, chained and helpless.

SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of

food and medication. He puts it down.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68.

He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces.

The albino nods.

The albino shakes his head.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.

He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad.

BUTTERCUP

and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a

corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an

intersecting corridor:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her.

As they move on--

FLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice

reading.

MAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE

And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how

many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen

and the Queen stand high on the balcony.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           70.

And the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence.

THE KID'S ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly

stronger than when we first saw him.

And on these words--

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           71.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And on his words--

THE CROWD

and it's gigantic.

THE ARCHWAY

we saw before, as Buttercup emerges.

THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent

KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.

BUTTERCUP

touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we

THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT

WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every

step of the way.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72.

She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.

CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at

Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's

throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was

when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and

suddenly,

BUTTERCUP

coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As

she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.

BUTTERCUP

bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands

nearby.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           73.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.

And she nods --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           74.

A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are

extraordinarily heavily knotted.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides

back perfectly into place.

AN ENORMOUS THING

We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow

it is unsettling.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing --

Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there.

The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley.

A DIAL

with numbers ranging from a low of "1" to a high of "50."

Rugen goes to it.

And he turns the dial to "1".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           76.

WESTLEY

He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his

heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of

himself

COUNT RUGEN

fiddling with his Machine a moment more. And then he opens

the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the

wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.

WESTLEY

and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the

chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it

almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes

from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as

we finally

COUNT RUGEN

He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and

pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides.

Rugen opens the book to a blank page.

AND NOW, AT LAST:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           77.

WESTLEY

in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries.

Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.

HUMPERDINCK

in his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all

over. Now YELLIN, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in

the doorway.

BUTTERCUP

entering.

THE PRINCE AND YELLIN

turning to her in the doorway.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           78.

As she glides out--

THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being

rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.

Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79.

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

INIGO

drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of

brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He

looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he

brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone

cause for worry.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the

Assistant Brute comes into view.

He waves his sword dangerously.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           80.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it

to his own smaller hand.

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's

brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right

in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he

careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has

come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and

as he does,

AN EMPTY ALEHOUSE IN THE THIEVES' QUARTER

Inigo sits slumped in a chair, while FEZZIK spoons him some

stew.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           81.

And he faints again into his stew.

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly

of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head

into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,

pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a

short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then

back in the hot --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.

THE TWO OF THEM

Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo.

CLOSE UP - INIGO

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           83.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK'S CHAMBERS

-- strewn with maps, etc. Yellin enters, and kneels.

He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck.

Just at that moment, Buttercup enters.

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment.

BUTTERCUP

staring at Humperdinck.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           84.

HUMPERDINCK

jumping at her, yanking her by the hair, starting to pull

her along, out of control, his words indistinct.

A CORRIDOR OF THE CASTLE

as the Prince throws open the door to Buttercup's room,

slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           85.

WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE

but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his

book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the

steps, raging.

And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the

lever and --

COUNT RUGEN

calling out --

But it's too late as we --

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

shoving the lever all the way up and

WESTLEY'S FACE

And there has never been such pain. The pain grows and grows

and with it now, something else has started

THE DEATH SCREAM. As The Death Scream starts to rise --

OUTSIDE THE PIT OF DESPAIR

as the SOUND moves along, LOUDER AND LOUDER, and --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           86.

YELLIN AND HIS SIXTY BRUTES

and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other

in fear, and as the scream builds --

BUTTERCUP IN HER ROOM

and she hears the SOUND, doesn't know what it is, but her

arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the

trembling, and the scream, still builds and --

ESTABLISHING SHOT ACROSS THE RIVER

There are many PEOPLE --it is the day of the country's 500th

Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits

them. A few CHILDREN pale, bolt toward their PARENTS and --

INIGO AND FEZZIK

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace,

which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through.

FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of

ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen

slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.

It's too crowded.

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87.

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to

track the FADING SOUND.

A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes

at his chest.

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

Silence.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if

he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops

without a sound.

INIGO

He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes

closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his

voice low and strange.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword

held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

THE SECRET KNOT

that reveals the staircase.

INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the

Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.

Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes

home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a

knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides

away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each

other, then start down.

WESTLEY

dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a

heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

THE KID'S ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet

seen him.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

THE KID: CLOSE UP

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.

And he desperately fights for control.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

INIGO, IN DESPAIR

We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a

moment, he just sags.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.

As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

A HOVEL - DUSK

Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From

inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel

Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

Inigo pounds again.

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting

to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench

by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop

limp.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and

starts to pump.

He stops pumping.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94.

He starts pumping again.

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and

toward

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96.

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

THIS LUMP

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at

the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking

utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like

chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more

dubiously.

Max nods.

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff

as a board now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.

And as they wave, trying to look happy we --

FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down

to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,

he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,

trying to prop Westley against the wall.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to

get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while

Inigo brings out the miracle pill.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98.

INIGO

Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can

see for himself.

WESTLEY

absolutely stunned.

He shakes his head from side to side.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100.

INIGO AND FEZZIK

Inigo and Fezzik do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101.

A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these

words come to us on the wind --

BUTTERCUP

in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her

beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          102.

BUTTERCUP

and she couldn't seem more serene.

HER WESTLEY

looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.

THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE

-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes.

WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake

hands.

Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back

and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his

arm over and onto his friend's.

AN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing

CLERGYMAN imaginable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          103.

Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind

them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the

back is Count Rugen.

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door.

He has an impediment that would stop a clock.

And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a

commotion. And then--

THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the

commotion, frightened, pointing.

THEIR P.O.V.:

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating

toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak,

and with a voice that would crumble walls.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          104.

FEZZIK

and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the

wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by

pushing it and supporting Westley.

THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

YELLIN

keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting

orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --

INIGO AND WESTLEY

Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

THE BRUTES

as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.

THE CHAPEL, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to

Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel

with the Four Guards as we

FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild

panic --

INSIDE THE CHAPEL

As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud

outside.

Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106.

And FEZZIK rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is

indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.

Yellin just watches in fear.

THE CHAPEL

as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger

Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And she's right. It's there.

YELLIN

pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK

close in.

FEZZIK

steps toward him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107.

And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik.

HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP

AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

And as he dashes off --

BUTTERCUP

standing there. Dazed.

COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS

racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex

intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous,

as we

WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK

moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who

is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog

leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108.

COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe

they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance

to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone

mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and

the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit

the floor. There is a pause. Then --

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he

does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.

INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving

Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,

running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it

and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He

tries again. No kind of chance.

FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls

back --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.

INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door.

FEZZIK AND WESTLEY

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and

takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came

from --

INIGO

still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for

him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands

the door crumbles

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110.

Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his

forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

And on those words --

COUNT RUGEN

And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he

glances back --

INIGO

behind him, coming like a streak and --

THE INTERSECTION

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at

all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of

the missing Westley.

COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his

pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp

point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111.

INIGO

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and

heading into a dining hall and --

COUNT RUGEN

throwing the dagger --

INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it

sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly

against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming

from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face,

and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

Inigo sinks.

BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly

to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled

box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems

very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

WESTLEY

lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice

sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.

Westley is helpless.

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his

stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving

in to kill Inigo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his

sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,

just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered

sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left

shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much

worse.

THE COUNT

stepping back, going for the heart again.

INIGO

And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for

support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a

roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make

some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as

this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,

Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

COUNT RUGEN

stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues

to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count

is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of

his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,

makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114.

COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great

power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he

forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.

But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the

Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

THE COUNT

And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none

of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves

forward.

COUNT RUGEN

retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home

where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his

blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo

was wounded.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115.

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash

bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel

slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

And on that --

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes

one final time and --

COUNT RUGEN

crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead

center and --

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116.

INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen

like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and

as the Count pitches down --

RUGEN

lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from

the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging

wide, full of fear.

INIGO

staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never

seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on

Inigo smiling, then --

INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is

still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.

HUMPERDINCK

entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118.

WESTLEY

lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.

HUMPERDINCK

gripping his sword, watching.

CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the

wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119.

HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside

him.

WESTLEY

lying there, staring at him.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his

feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

HUMPERDINCK

staring, eyes wide.

WESTLEY

And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind

his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.

WESTLEY

speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.

And as she sets to work --

INIGO

entering, looking around.

his balance betrays him.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121.

HUMPERDINCK

and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.

They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and

FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on

the balcony.

INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

looking down at FEZZIK.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          122.

And as he holds out his great arms--

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of

course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can

catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think

she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

Now from that --

THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS

triumphantly racing through the night --

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

and at last their trials are done. They stop.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          123.

As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

THE KID'S BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

THE KID'S ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.

The Old Man stops, turns.

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the

door, tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT.

THE END.
