CORTEZ leaps out. Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep

and pulls it to the log, roughly 15 feet away.

bg Cortez get suddenly YANKED out of scene!

ON DRIVER - His eyes go wide. Trying to see in the dark.

ON LOG - Cortez is gone. Pantera wakes up.

OS - Hear the sound of a CHAIN clinking. Then WHOOSHING as

the chain winch suddenly FLIES IN, and CRACKS the BURLY

SOLDIER across the jaw! It wraps itself around his neck.

Before he can react...

- YOINK! He gets pulled over the hood of the jeep, landing on

the ground HARD.

Burly gets pulled backward... away from the Jeep and into...

the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground.

ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the

back. Pantera stands up in the jeep. "Last" jumps out and

readies his machine gun.

REVERSE ANGLE - Don lifts his head up, eyes MAGNIFIED in some

bizarre head contraption. He flips up side panels,

ELECTRONICA MUSIC blares out.

A beat. Mikey sighs, then walks back downstairs to the LIVING

ROOM SOFA. He and the camera think he's alone, but before he

knows it, Splinter is sitting next to him, cross legged,

still, and sipping tea.

Mikey stares at Splinter, dead pan. A beat. Then returns to

flipping channels. He stops on a NEWS program - "NYC DIRT".

M         known as "The Nightwatcher".

REPORTER. Beside him is a news photo of the tied up MUGGER

from our second scene.

ON MIKEY - Can't smile wide enough. He runs to his room,

returns with a POLAROID CAMERA. He snaps a picture of the TV.

He pulls it out, placing it in his NIGHTWATCHER SCRAPBOOK,

overflowing with paper clippings and articles on the

vigilante.

Don walks in, holding an in-process invention. He looks up.

ON DOOR - Raphael walks in, his Nightwatcher costume no where

in sight.

Raphael's on edge from the mention of Nightwatcher already.

His attention doesn't break from Donatello.

Splinter watches the growing tension with concern.

Mikey picks up two NINJA BLADE RINGS, twirling them around

aggressively in mock battle.

Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick

and startled, eyes wide.

Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms

out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the

second floor.

ON OUTSIDE OF ROOM - Raphael walks out of the shadows. He's

good... but not too good for Splinter. Splinter and Leo break

and face the doorway. An awkward silence.

Raphael eyes Leo... and then the medallion.

He leaves.

TV ROOM - Raph walks through the room, cuffs Don on the back

of the head, and keeps on walking.

Donatello wakes up, looks around. LIGHTS UP when he sees Leo.

ON MIKEY - He wakes up. A Cheese Doodle stuck to his upper

snout. Really groggy.

Mikey flips past Donnie and slams Leo with a gripping HUG...

and doesn't let go.

WIDER - Casey is with 5 other KIDS prepping for a game of

STREET HOCKEY, using tennis balls and trash cans. Chubbier

KID 2 walks by and grabs the mask himself.

They begin a boisterous round of hockey. Trash talk, gentle

checking and all the requisite boy things. We see that the

kids love Casey. And vice versa. Suddenly-

Tommy's defeated. Looks at the disappointed boys.

OFF HIS LOOK - We see APRIL, dressed stunning in a dark

business suit at the other side of the street. She's dangling

a WHITE SHIRT and a TIE from her other hand.

April just gives him "the look" with an eyebrow cock. Casey

knows he can't win.

Casey hands his stick, then quickly turns with a grin.

38                                                                38

Winters nearly crushes Casey's hand in his grip.

Winters and April chuckle. Cam adjusts to show Casey between

them in the bg, looking uncomfortable and out of place.

Winters BEAMS, way too excited as well. April holds out her

hand to Casey, who doesn't know what she wants. He awkwardly

HIGH FIVES her.

He hands it to April as she twirls up a CROW-BAR and cracks

open the front panel.

INSIDE BOX POV - The light gradually breaks in, until - CREAK

- the front panel falls to the floor.

CLOSE ON - Winters' look. Pure wonder and admiration. He

walks up to it slowly. April and Casey cautiously stay back.

ON BOX - We finally see the statue - GENERAL AGUILA - a seven-

foot towering wall of granite and obsidian. Eagle warrior

armor reflecting a South American design... though not from a

specific time period. Winters rubs his hand over the stone.

GROUP SHOT - Of five Warriors. High atop a hillside, finally

stopped. Ready for battle. Their character-specific weapons

are drawn. Around them is a small army of MINIONS.

CLOSE ON - Yaotl. As he raises his sword in the air. CAM

DOLLIES AROUND HIS HEAD REVEALING their opposing forces. An

army of THOUSANDS. Waving their weapons in the air.

The opposing army CHARGES. Yaotl's men pull out   a large

ORNAMENTAL STAND - a "stargate" of sorts. Yaotl   and his men

are unmoving... as they begin a ceremony. Yaotl   looks to the

heavens above - as we see a CLUSTER OF SPECIFIC   STARS move

into place.

ON CHARGING ARMY - they stop dead in their tracks. Front-lit

by the OS portal. Don't know what to expect -

ON PORTAL - A crackling electric circle opens to another

dimension. Suddenly - DOZENS OF MONSTERS EXPLODE OUT!

Creatures of all varieties. Gnashing Fangs. Swiping claws.

T

Don is grinning. Observing the subtle tension.

Music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on

buildings. The course requires them to work as a TEAM,

throwing, catching and propelling one another from obstacle

to obstacle.

Leo accidentally slips, PLOWING Raph face-first into a brick

wall. Raph, convinced Leo did it on purpose, uses his next

opportunity to hurl Leo dangerously high and far over a

billboard. The situation escalates at each juncture.

Their intensity ESCALATES.

They scale to the top floor. Peering over the edge.

CAM BEGINS TO CRANE UP from Turtles to activity on the floor.

CAM FINISHES ON FLOOR - Showing SIX FOOT NINJAS and KARAI

squaring off against a LARGE BIGFOOT-LIKE MONSTER! It tosses

them around like stuffed animals.

ON TURTLES - As they've all now crept up to the dark corner

of the floor. A FOOT NINJA gets clobbered and sails past

them, and off the building. (safely to a scaffold below)

ON LEO - He's troubled. The burden of "leader" shouldered.

Raph jumps forward! Leo rolls his eyes, as all the Turtles

jump into the fray. The Foot are surprised at first, and the

Bigfoot Monster is confused as well.

ON LEO - He stops when he comes face to face with Karai.

ON KARAI - She pauses a moment. They exchange expert katana

attacks. Stalemate. She gestures to the Foot as they use this

opportunity for their escape. As they leap away, Karai looks

back at the Turtles...

The Creature immediately CHASES the boys throughout the

structure, as they use all their ninja skills to avoid it,

not to mention impalement on the bed of rebar below!

boys have no choice but to help him... putting them in deeper

trouble.

The I-Beam is getting dented and twisted with each impact.

The tussle begins to fall - whoomp, whoomp - down many

flights of floors.

Raph gets separated at one point, jumping off the side of the

building to catch up, and swings himself back onto the bottom

floor to await the others.

SMASH! They fall into Raph's floor.

But the Turtles eventually get cornered. And just as the

Creature closes in-

The creature stops. Confused. So are the other three turtles.

The creature SCREAMS BACK! Boys freak out.

A

dried cement and blocks to come CRASHING DOWN ON THEM! The

Turtles are buried under the rubble.

RUH? - The Creature is confused... until it's hit with a

blinding light, and then an EXPLOSION - FWOOM! We hear heavy

footsteps thumping through the light. Shapes start to form

until we see...

...LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS! Sporting HIGH

TECH GEAR - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings.

Their bodies "glow" with a red inner life, seeping through

their stone cracks and piercing eyes.

The Generals are all ANIMAL-THEMED - Mute and powerful Ape-

themed costume ("MONO"), Eagle Leader ("AGUILA"), agile

Jaguar ("GATO") and the deadly snake-like female

("SERPIENTE"). Large. Imposing. Completely bad-ass.

The Creature ROARS and FIGHTS to no avail...

Winters smirks, looking at the mouse who thinks he can take

the lion. He reaches to a satchel on the floor. The Foot

TENSE in anticipation. Instead... Winters comes up with a

MONEY BRICK.

SHINK! - Karai pulls out her To and slices the brick in mid-

air. Winters STOPS and looks back over his shoulder.

ON WINTERS - Condescendingly finds this particularly `cute'.

It sets the Foot off. They all grab their weapons, moving

toward Winters. Karai flips forward, sword drawn and at

Winters throat!

...as Winters stands still... and begins to LAUGH.

Slowly, the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the

shadows. Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS.

They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of

it all.

The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and

unmoving. Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot.

Karai stews... unblinking stare. Of course she does.

Karai slowly steps back. Winters smiles wide, reaches into

the drawer and takes another brick of bills and tosses it to

a Foot Ninja. Then another to a second Ninja.

ON FOOT - They just stare back, blank goggles. Probably

seething inside. Winters is flanked by Generals.

The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse.

CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is

wheeled into the light.

Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit

pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the

HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight.

It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily.

Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw.

Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He

merely grins at the creature.

AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over

Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four.

Karai and Aguila stare at each other. Karai obviously not

used to being handled like this.

The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the

floor ahead - into a DISK on the floor. ON CEILING - We see

the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell.

The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some

cells inserted on the large stone disk in the floor. Filled

by darkened silhouettes of creatures that we're probably glad

we don't fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness.

The Generals turn and walk-push the Foot out of the door.

They move to fight back, but Karai waves her hand.

ON DOOR - Splinter walks in, HUMMING to himself.

Splinter makes himself a TEA. Room is SILENT.

ON TURTLES - Raph and Leo GLARE at one another while they

eat. Don is pouring over a THICK BOOK while Mikey sits with

his forehead on the table.

S

the table, the glare continues.

The boys react and rush into the MAIN LIVING AREA.

ON TV - a well-coifed News Reporter stands outside of the I-

BEAM TOWER. In the daylight, we can see the building is

twisted and dented from the night's fighting.

The boys immediately JUMP FORWARD. Mikey grabs the remote and

ups the volume.

Splinter's eyes go wide. He looks at his boys listening to

the TV intently. Mikey nurses his sore head.

52                                                                  52

It's getting serious. Casey's bat is suddenly wrapped by

Night's CHAIN, and pulled down. Raph's visor flips up.

ON RAPH - His eyes look around for an answer. Nothing.

Raph smiles... the first genuine one he's had in a long time.

IN BG - The Burglar tries to get away. Casey and Raph both

spy him. Look at each other. Mischievously grin as we-

60                                                                60

SCREEEEECH!!! - A large VAMPIRE-LIKE CREATURE flies up from

the alley below and spreads its 30-foot wings!

It's about to attack when - THUNKA-THUNKA-THUNKA - it's

drilled with TRANQUILIZER DARTS from below! CHOOOM! - A

grappling hook winds around its feet. The Creature struggles

but is pulled down hard!

They inch closer to the edge. Peek over.

ON ALLEY - See the Four Generals putting a pounding on the

Creature. They subdue it with all their hardware. The Foot

stand guard, helping in the BG.

One of the generals effortlessly picks up a TRASH DUMPSTER

and wallops the Creature with one blow.

The Generals put the Creature in a cell. Wheel it to a

TRANSPORTER VEHICLE as it drives away. They're just about to

leave when-

S

the ledge. It falls down - CLANG! - on a garbage can lid.

UNDER A BRIDGE - Raph points up and - CHOOP! - hits a remote

that lowers his MOTORCYCLE.

Raph leaves Gato in a cloud of dust... but not for long. Gato

clamors along... keeping up with the weaving bike! In the

fray, Casey looses his mask... as it gets trampled by Gato.

It's an insane chase, with Raph trying to lose him as Casey

swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General.

Suddenly - THUNK!

A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat. He looks

at it.

Raph sees the blade! They manage to switch positions in mid-

ride, with Casey driving and Raph in back. Raph throws kicks

and punches at their pursuer when he closes in.

The chase takes them to a PARKING GARAGE as they circle

upwards, Gato jumping from car to car, still on their tails!

ROOFTOP - They're trapped. He doesn't have a hope... aside

from jumping the bike to the next roof!

He lets out the clutch as they make the jump! WHAM! - Sparks

and crucial pieces fly off the undercarriage. They both look

back at Gato up and away at the top of the structure.

...and then -thumpthumpthump- Gato JUMPS DOWN TOWARD THEM!

Casey guns it - BUT THE BIKE DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE - as Gato

is in mid-air, taking off. Casey grabs the weakening Raph and

drags him off.

ON RAPH'S SHELL - Two Obsidian Disks are wedged in his back

with a Tranquilizer Dart. Donnie wedges out the Obsidian Disk

with pliers.

April swallows hard.

April sits down on the floor with the disk. Trying to figure

things out. Casey leans down to her.

ON APRIL - Her mouth is agape.

ON APRIL - She slowly turns to Casey. Floored.

CAM PANS TO THE RIGHT - As it passes a FG element, the screen

dips to black. We hear sounds of a violent BATTLE. Monsters

shrieking. Blades clashing. April's retelling Winters' story.

Everyone is gathered around as April finishes. Mikey, in

particular, is hunched over, intent. Casey, like before, has

fallen asleep. Silence for a beat. Then-

Donnie studies the tranq dart under a magnifying glass of

April's.

Donatello looks up with MAGNIFYING GOGGLES on. Sarcastic.

Tense stare off between Raph and Leo. Raph moves anyway.

Casey stops him. Quieter moment.

ON APRIL - She's listening to Casey... maybe her man-boy is

growing up. Raph knows he can't win.

67                                                                67

A

Night turns. His helmet is still on. He hits his LIGHTS on

the side of his head to see through the thick smoke. He finds

the DINER COOK huddled behind the counter. Night looks scary.

Night looks around. He sees the CASH REGISTER on the floor.

He picks it up, puts it on the counter.

Sudddenly - SHINK! - a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash

register till! Night jumps. Looks out the window.

CAM PULLS WAY WAY BACK, REALLY FAST - Out the Diner and to

the rooftop across the street... and over the green shoulders

of LEO.

Nightwatcher standing over him, holding the register.

CLOSE ON LEO - He's fuming. Staring down at Nightwatcher. The

frustration of the last few days pent up inside of him.

B

to figure out his next move.

78                                                                78

Leo unsheathes his two katanas. Raph can't hear him.

Nightwatcher drops TWIN BOLOS. He twirls them with

expertise... then motions for Leo to fight. Charge at each

other, running through the rain, weapons drawn.

They fight. Hard. And with expertise. Two masters duking it

out. It surprises Leo. It fills Night with more adrenaline.

There's a break. They circle like tigers. Renewing attacks.

Night knows every one of Leo's moves, and counters in turn.

...then he starts goading him on. Pushing Leo. Prodding.

Making him MAD. ...and then Leo fights back. HARD.

Night can't keep up. Leo uses every bit of his control,

restraint and expertise. He surgically slices the bind under

Night's helmet. He jumps on top of the vigilante.

Leo UPPERCUTS Night, knocking his helmet off! His face

falls... IT'S RAPHAEL! Leo pales.

But Raph doesn't feel like explaining. Refuses defeat.

He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles back, still in shock.

They yell at each other through the pouring rain.

81                                                                81

Donnie's drawn a NEW LINE from the alignment of the stars.

April elbows Casey to wake him up.

ON OTHERS - HUH?! Mikey air - calculates math in bg.

It sits in the room. Heavy.

No one answers. Splinter looks to Raph. Raph steps up.

Splinter stands to his side.

The two stare at each other as the CAM ANGLES BEHIND KARAI -

she's holding a KATANA SWORD behind her back!

sports gear "heat" on his end too. Both don't let on.

Casey wheels the crate inside. The gate closes only KARAI HAS

NOW DISAPPEARED! Casey opens the front hatch, revealing Don,

Raph, Mikey, April and Splinter.

A long beat. Then...

Everyone looks at sheepish Splinter. A beat. Suddenly-

WIDER - The empty garden begins to move. CREEPY, as DOZENS OF

FOOT NINJA begin to rise out of the shadows and slink toward

our heroes, surrounding them.

KARAI makes a dramatic entrance, landing in front of April

and Casey. Tense beat.

92                                                             92

Everyone high fives Casey. Except April. She smiles.

OFF DON'S LOOK - the mayhem builds at the other end of the

vast lobby. The cells are glowing. The portal worsens.

They all run over. Mikey runs to a cell.

RAARRGH! - A claw swoops out. He dodges out of the way.

ON RAPH - He finds Leo!

D

out. LIFELESS.

Raph holds Leo in his lap on the floor. Looks like Leo is

DEAD. Raph's head falls low, as...

WIDER - Leo is alive. Coughs and slowly gets his strength

back. Stands up. He and Raph look at each other. Leo can only

imagine what Raph's been through to rescue him. A beat.

B

ON WINTERS - He stands on the battlefield. Alone. As he

walks, the CAM MOVES around him. During this, we X-DISSOLVE

BETWEEN A FEW SELECT TIME PERIODS between then and now.

ON SHADOWS - The Four Generals thump forward.

ON DOORS - CAM PULLS BACK ALONG DOORS as each one is barely

forced open and dozens of Foot Ninjas pile in the lobby!

Karai comes to FG of group. Surveys as the scene continues.

Aguila walks to the cells. The portal writhes in the bg,

sinking into the floor.

ON WINTERS - He waits. A beat.

Karai sees Winters' condition. Clearly getting screwed by the

very beings who have been nothing but hostile toward her and

her Foot Clan. She suddenly GESTURES WITH HER HANDS -

military/ninja style.

97   The Portal worsens behind them. Sound and sight. The Eight 97

98                                                                98

Raph and Aguila duke it out in and around the MONSTER CELLS.

It's a Jackie Chan-inspired sequence, where they have to be

aware of their environment to avoid defeat.

ON SPLINTER AND WINTERS - The portal is pulling the cells in.

About five more to go. Splinter also flips around and takes

out another demon trying to escape. Splinter actually seems

to be having FUN.

BACK WITH APRIL AND CASEY - Rush the streets of NYC.

Casey GUNS IT for the pier, music tinkling. CAM ZOOMS AHEAD

THROUGH THE STREETS until it reaches the pier. CAM CRANES

over the harbor warehouses until we see -

- the 13th monster! Looks like a land-locked GIANT CROCODILE.

It appears unconscious - a hundred or so TRANQ DARTS sticking

out of it's back. The Van pulls onto the scene.

I

each other.

They pile out of the van.

ON CREATURE - A Foot Ninja stands next to the lifeless body.

As he turns his head he doesn't see THE CREATURE'S EYE OPEN!

WIDER - The creature stands up as everyone turns to see. The

creature DOG SHAKES his hide, sending the tranq darts flying

everywhere! They slam into the walls like shrapnel.

ON FOOT - As they dive out of the way. One gets hit with a

dart in the chest. Looks down. Passes out.

ON VAN - As they open the doors to act as shields as - THUNKA

THUNK THUNK - darts stick in the door!

ON CREATURE - He's now standing... and dying to chase

something. It GROWLS/SCREAMS as they all pile into the van!

Casey immediately throws it in reverse and starts peeling

back on the pier, barely staying out of the clutches of the

creature smashing the pier in front of them. Get to the end

and spin the vehicle around.

Casey guns it, the 12-foot creature mere inches away!

STARS IN SKY - Karai sees the stars are slowly moving out of

alignment. Losing time fast.

BACK IN LOBBY - CRANE DOWN on Winters and Splinter. On the

last full cell.

ON PORTAL - A pair of LARGE EYES are threatening to come out.

In the BG, dozens of winged DEMONS fly around inside.

BACK WITH VAN - CLOSE ON CASEY'S FACE - As he's screaming his

guts out.

WIDER - We see that he's on top of the Van, acting as LIVE

BAIT to attract the creature! It's working too! The creature

pounces along like an awkward greyhound run. April drives.

Casey is throwing SPORTS EQUIPMENT at it from his large

hockey bag. The creature is catching and eating it all.

INSIDE VAN - Casey slips in.

They all look out the back window as the creature pounds

closer and closer...

BACK IN LOBBY - The Turtles and Generals are at a standstill.

Turtles all get thrown into a pile between the Generals.

Don clocks Mikey behind the head.

Raph grins. They stand, backs to back... finally as a TEAM.

They trust one another, and their efficiency shows.

ON PORTAL - More tentacles begin to come out. More claws

surround the surface edges.

ON TMNT - The music swells. The brothers act and think as

one. The way they should. They way they will from now on.

ON SPLINTER - As cam PUSHES IN, he stands up. Seeing his

sons. As one. As BROTHERS. He smiles.

The Generals can't keep up. It's enough to distract them to

make mistakes the TMNT take advantage of.

ON WINTERS - Sees the portal light beginning to SHRINK!

Because of the TMNT's moves, the Generals are now on the

precipice of the Portal, being pulled back. They struggle to

stand.

The brothers look at each other. The place is violent with a

whirlwind and screaming Monsters.

T

The   TMNT launch into their FINAL ATTACK - perfectly in synch

and   take out each of the Generals, knocking them back into

the   PORTAL! They're plucked out of mid-air by cloudy tendrils

and   pulled back!

The Turtles collapse onto the floor, back to the portal.

Silent. Splinter runs over to them.

Then - BOOM! - the Generals' ARMS slam onto the ridge of the

portal - BEGINNING TO CLIMB OUT! The Turtles jump back.

The brothers are screwed. They can't stop the Generals. Until-

BEHIND TURTLES - Glowing headlights grow larger. Closer. As -

KERSMASH!!! The Van flies through the lobby, musical chime

and all, being trailed by the Creature! April clips a corner

as the vehicle spins out of the path.

falls, sliding, clicking its claws trying to stop!

Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles out of way as the

Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into the

Portal! The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back

into the Portal!

ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the cycle.

ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get

out, only now, we see they are HUMAN... their curse broken...

and an eternity of pain and suffering ahead of them.

Aguila tries to fight his way out of the portal.

WHAM! - Raph and Leo team-roundhouse him back into oblivion!

WIDER - The portal EXPLODES in a upwards funnel. Silence.

The brothers high five one another. Splinter smiles proud.

ON VAN - Dusty and smoking. The door clangs open. Casey piles

out. Karai comes next and accidentally FALLS on Casey in a

very compromising position! She slyly smiles. April falls out

last beside them.

HUHN! - Casey tosses Karai off of him. April's eye cocks.

Casey just grabs her, cutting her off and they kiss. Like

they should have been kissing all along.

They stop. Noses close. Smile. They pull apart, revealing

MIKEY standing there. Watching them all gooey-eyed.

Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat. Then hug. Brothers

again. Dialogue would just ruin this moment.

Splinter walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and

the Foot Ninja standing there. Silence. Finally, Karai steps

forward -

ON TMNT - they're confused.

ON TURTLES - They all look at each other.

They look back - and see Karai and the Foot have DISAPPEARED.

Raph looks over at WINTERS. He's hunched over in the corner.

Can't tell what's going on. They walk over slowly.

ON WINTERS - Looks like he's sobbing. They get concerned.

Then the sobs turn to LAUGHING. He stands up. His hand is

spotted red with his M

Winters looks at all the Turtles.
