TITLE OVER BLACK

"Come, ye children, listen to me.   I will teach you

the fear of the LORD."

THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK

Vast.    Barren.   No signs of life.

A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains.    The

unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold.

A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.

And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED

OUT, leaving us in:

DARKNESS...

A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS

SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE...a CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS.

TITLE:   "Los Angeles, December 23rd - 1:02 a.m."

A BLOOD RED MOON

reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the

smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice

something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing,

coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!

TWO BLACK BOOTS

land hard in the water...and we're in:

EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT

A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the

pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly

he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have

been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head,

deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a

fight.

His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL.

He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick

walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from?

A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems

to motivate him.

Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes

toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in

time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner,

SIRENS WAILING, heading this way.

He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash

dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip

past.

Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a

MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly.

Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor

sharp.

Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare

chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK

TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light.

As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK

WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over,

and then...

...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO

WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.

The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens.

The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.

A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...

...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...

...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE

ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...

CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,

SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN...

EXT. CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER

Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out

of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront

across the street.

"GUN & SPORT WORLD"

INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER

Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists.    Quiet except for the

sound of RAIN, then...

SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a

shower of glass.

INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink.

His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the

fluorescent light, we get a better look at him.

His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED

shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is

a living book. But the writing is in no language we

recognize.

He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY

OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.

FRESH. BLOODY.

He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE,

and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the

cement floor around his feet.

INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER

Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the

ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons,

his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life

for this.

Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.

Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big.

Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold.

The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front

doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get

out of here?

INT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME

Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's

BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun.

The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.      Busy night.

Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a

deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the

streetwalkers.

Burton doesn't even smile.       He's dead fucking serious.

He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people

they pass, picking them off one by one.

Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh.      Estevez eyes his

partner, wary.

KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE

just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car.

Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time

to see...

EXT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - CONTINUOUS

Michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly

out of the GAPING HOLE he's blown in the front of the store.

Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car,

crouching behind the open doors, GUNS trained on Michael.

In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO

CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE.

"Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!"

The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.

The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what

the hell?" -- then they turn back to Michael.

Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.

Michael slowly places his palms on his skull.

Michael slowly turns around.    Calm.

Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist,

FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible

decision made.

And that's when he moves, a fucking blur!

In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him

helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's

Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off

with Burton.

Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.

Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his

throat like a skipping record.

THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the

confusion.

Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY

QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive

pressure were building inside him.

And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH

BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE

CLOWN!

His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully

in control.

Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice

GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.

Estevez looks at his partner with confusion.

Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.

BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops,

leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's

faster, already FIRING back.

Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!   The squad car window

SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING!

And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing.

Smoke rising from his gun.

With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags

and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car.

He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the

FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a

wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS...

JEEP HANSON (LATE TEENS)

Bolts awake.   Breathing hard.   Covered with sweat.

INT. JEEP'S ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped

bedroom. Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got

shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.

EXT. DESERT - PRE-DAWN

A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the

eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the

trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in

decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the

trailers roof lines, marking the season.

One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily

out into the cool western morning. Home.

Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a

two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that

Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours.

Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign

glows like a beacon in the darkness:

"PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB"

A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.

Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about

twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep

from her eyes. Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's

strikingly beautiful.

She approaches Jeep.   Sees the strain in his eyes.

He struggles for a moment, nods.

A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face.

Jeep turns away, dejected.

This is not news Jeep wants to hear.

Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but

this just isn't where she's at.

Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.

Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the

trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the

clank of the door, she's gone.

And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of

FRANK CAPRA'S "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" MIXES up.

IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE PLAYING ON A CRUMMY TV

Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence, his

guardian angel-in-training. The signal ROLLS and SNOWS in

and out. We hear a WHACK, which causes the image to

momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY

BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine

roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in

the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it.

The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm

you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old

plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and

tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded

diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off

the Shopping Network.

Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an

ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine

stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit.

You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer

drinker.

Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is

cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed

dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when

your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.   The

dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's

hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.

WHACK!

WHACK!

The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the

MERLE HAGGARD tune "I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE".

A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair

and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the

jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling

as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that

really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a

billboard of rebellion.

Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the

diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE. SANDRA

and HOWARD ANDERSON. Fish out of water.

The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard

with a caustic smile.

And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches

the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Loving it.

Howard turns back to his wife.   Rigid smile.

Sandra buries her face in her hands.

Across the diner, Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the

music, which is suddenly overtaken by BASS BUMPIN' HIP-HOP.

DRIFTING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF WESTERN DESERT

The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through

this barren country.

A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path.   HEAVY BEATS thunder

from within.

INT. ESCALADE - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

The stereo in this rig could shake mountains. KYLE WILLIAMS

(late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad

boy.

He passes a weathered road sign:

"ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES"

Kyle's expression says this is not good news.

He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat.   No signal.

He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the

lonely row of old gas pumps.

Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in

the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot.

Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and

rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the

SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier.

The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK

parked in front of the garage with its hood up.

Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and

flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around.

Which way is north?

He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way

out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in

search of a pay phone.

The good news is that he finds one.   The bad news is that

it's been broken for ten years.

Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing

a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her

very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look

is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name

tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE".

She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.

She lets out a long slow exhale.

She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette.

Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle

takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.

They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing

mechanic's coveralls and holding a DUSTY OLD CRIB. Charlie

quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Busted.

Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he

shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette

back up to her lips. An awkward beat.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY

The DOOR JINGLES.   Charlie and Kyle enter.

Audrey's eyes light up when she sees Kyle. He notices her as

well. How couldn't he? She's directing every ounce of sex

appeal she has in his direction.

Her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in

Kyle's direction, as if he personified their worst suburban

nightmare.

Charlie heads to the register. Digs out a fresh pack of

smokes from underneath the counter.

Bob steps off the chair.

In truth there aren't any orders stacking up, but it

certainly makes Bob feel better to say it.

Bob turns to Kyle.   Doesn't like what he sees.

Bob is about to respond when:

Howard approaches, oblivious to the conversation he's

interrupting.

Bob's expression darkens at this news.

A GRIMY PIECE OF WOOD

A cloth wipes away the dirt, revealing the partial image of

an ANGEL carved into the surface.

INT. MECHANIC'S BAY - CONTINUOUS

Jeep is carefully cleaning the old wooden crib on a

workbench. There's an unsettling intensity in his eyes, as

if fear itself were driving him.

Jeep freezes, knows he's in trouble He reluctantly turns to

see his father standing next to the Anderson's broken-down

Uhual.

Jeep stares at the ground.   Couldn't be anymore

uncomfortable.

Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails.

Bob looks down at the crib with dismay.

Bob considers him, softens.

EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

Jeep walks out toward the gas pumps, but Bob's right

alongside him, not giving up.

Jeep stiffens.   Turns to his father:

Bob gives Jeep a hard stare.    Yeah, she is.

Jeeps shakes his head, burns.

Bob sighs, feels for his boy.

Jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily.    A

tough pill to swallow.

Bob walks back into the diner.

Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices

something off in the distance.

Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a

living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north.

Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the

distant mountains. A storm is coming.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle sitting at the counter,

digging into a plate of banana pancakes.

Kyle is about to address him again, when something else

steals Bob's attention.

The TV has gone on the fritz again.   Only now the image is

mostly snow.

Bob climbs back onto the chair.   Faces the TV.

WHACK!

The image flickers but doesn't improve.

WHACK!

Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK!

And the picture snaps into FOCUS.    Only it isn't the picture

he was expecting.

The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and

its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner.

Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV.

That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the

screen, which read:

"THIS IS NOT A TEST"

Bob switches the channels.    All the same.

Bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the TV as

if a little distance will bring some clarity. He bumps into

Kyle.

Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious WAD OF CASH.

That gets Bob's attention. Bob snaps the money out of his

hand.

Kyle hustles passed Percy.

Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes.

Everybody's eyes are locked on the TV.

Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf.

Switches it on.

STATIC.   He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal.

The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting.   Station

after station the same thing.

The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW

TONES. Everyone goes very still.

INT. DINER - BACK OFFICE - SAME

Kyle sits at a messy desk in this dark, wood paneled back

office, phone to his ear.

Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial.

Frowns. No dial tone.

He keeps trying.    Nothing.

INT. DINER - SAME

Everyone is looking at Howard.

Everyone considers that grimly, then:

Kyle has reappeared in the diner.

Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Jeep is buried under the Uhaul's hood, working at something

with a socket wrench. It's not going well.

He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands.       The

sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention.

He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off

the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps. It's a mystery

how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that

windshield.

After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN

ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground, followed by the metal

frame and wheels of a walker.

The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on

the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner

with the rickety frailness of an old turtle. Jeep watches

her disappear inside.

He then looks toward the horizon again.   The WALL OF DARK

CLOUDS are growing ever closer.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

A JINGLE as the old lady enters. She surveys the scene as if

feasting on paradise. Maybe her eyes aren't so good.

The old lady settles at a table across from the Andersons.

She smiles at them pleasantly.

Charlie is about to hand her a menu, when:

The old lady turns to the Andersons.

A FLY begins to buzz around Gladys's head.    She doesn't seem

to notice it.

Gladys smiles strangely.

Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that

response.

The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S

FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the

least.

Howard and Sandra exchange looks.    Creepy.

The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a

quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one

eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the

Andersons. Something about her...

Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front

of Gladys.

Charlie rests a hand on her belly.

A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it

away. But another one lands in its place.

Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real

ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady.   More

FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food.

Charlie is still trying to wave them away.

Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well.   Kyle

glances over from the counter.

Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in.

She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward

the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob.

Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour

her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are

swarming now. How did so many get in here?

Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of

events.

Gladys's head suddenly whips toward her.

Sandra covers her mouth in shock.    Everybody in the diner is

now focused on the old lady.

Howard gets up from the booth.

But Howard's already standing over Gladys.

GLADYS LUNGES AT HOWARD AND TAKES A MONSTROUS BITE OUT OF HIS

NECK! SHE PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A MOUTH FILLED WITH TINY

RAZOR SHARP TEETH.

EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard crumbles to the floor.

Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over.   Blood

covers her face and chest.

Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he

whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head

sideways. THWACK!

BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK.   Impossibly, Gladys is

still standing.

She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE

DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake.

Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.

But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING

WALL LIKE SOME KIND OF BIZARRE CRAB!

Bob can't believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast,

as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING --

UPSIDE DOWN!

BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't

track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in

the ceiling, a rain of plaster.

Gladys drops down right in front of Bob.

Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE

ROOM!

The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. He

snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face

him.

Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE.

Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear

paralyzing him where he stands.

Gladys rockets straight at him!

But Jeep's too afraid to move.    He clamps his eyes shut,

bracing himself for the end.

BLAM!   BLAM!   BLAM!

A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an

animal.

Jeep slowly opens his eyes.   His gun's still cocked.

Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet.

He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his

silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. If everyone wasn't so

shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing

such serious heat.

Sandra is on the floor with her husband.     Blood pours freely

from his neck.

Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation --

then he rushes to help.

Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his

hand.

Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck,

desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out

between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid

kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck.

A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to

his feet.

Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her

knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering. Her adult

facade giving way to that of a frightened child

A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and

see Gladys's TRAIL OF BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE CEILING. An

ungodly horror.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Kyle, Percy, Sandra and Audrey frantically carry Howard, his

neck bandaged, to the back of the Escalade.

INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

Howard lies in the back seat. Sandra by his head, clasping

his hands in hers. Audrey by his feet. Percy rides shotgun.

Kyle struggles to get the key in the ignition.

The engine ROARS to life.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

The Escalade fishtails onto the highway.

INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

Kyle grips the wheel.   Picking up speed.

Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor

time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat.

Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally

closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL.

She's right.    They're black... Undulating... BUZZING!

PING!   PING!   PING!

Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield --

SPLAT!

And that's when they realize it... Those aren't clouds.

THEY'RE FLIES!

The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by

insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED

bug guts. Driving blind!

The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and BUZZING is deafening!

Everyone SCREAMS as hell surrounds them...

INT. DINER BATHROOM - SAME

Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of

light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like

he's about to puke or faint.

Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling.

But for Jeep it's not okay.   He's hurting real bad inside.

He can't get the words out.   Bob rests a hand on his boy's

shoulder.

Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front

DOOR JINGLE.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

Bob and Jeep appear from the back, as Kyle, Percy, Audrey and

Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling,

gasping for air. Charlie moves in to help.

Percy races for the back.

Bob's about to respond when he hears the BUZZING.

Bob, Charlie and Jeep slowly approach the windows to see the

SOLID UNDULATING BLACK CURTAIN OF FLIES SURROUNDING THE TRUCK

STOP'S PERIMETER A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OUT.

Everything in the diner is suddenly cast in DARK RED as the

day's remaining sunlight filters through the swarm.

Apocalyptic.

No one breathes.

A BLACK HAND AND A HOOK TEAR A SHIRT OPEN

Revealing a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down to

the bone.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Percy and Charlie are tending to Howard. Sandra is holding

her husband's hand, trying to comfort him, while Audrey

watches from a distance with grim fascination.

Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound.

Sandra can't help but stare at Percy's hook.

Meanwhile across the diner, Bob and Jeep peel back the

tablecloth to examine Gladys' bullet riddled corpse. Kyle

stands over them with Bob's shotgun trained on the body --

just in case.

Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse angles

from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from

Percy's frying pan.

Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged

mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the

plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner. They warily

eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out.

A CLANK and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped

to the ground.

GLADYS' CUTLASS SUPREME

Its windows are completely caked with dust. The men WIPE

AWAY a layer of brown from the glass, allowing them to peer

inside the car.

Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door.     Unlocks it.

Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell

hits them.

Bob covers his nose.

Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in.      Dark, dirty.   But

nothing unusual.

They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR.   Jeep slips the key

in.

The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS.   ROTTING.

MAGGOT INFESTED.

Bob quickly slams the trunk closed.    The guys are reeling

with disgust.

Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose.

They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze.

A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild

stop in front of the diner. Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust

clears around it. No movement can be seen behind its bug

splattered windows.

Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle.

They consider the police car a moment more. See the

SHATTERED PASSENGER WINDOW, the BLOOD STAINS.

Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

The door of the POLICE CAR OPENS as Charlie races from the

diner.

The three men see her moving toward the car.    Jeep's face

goes slack.

The men begin to run toward her...

While out of the police car steps...

MICHAEL

Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those

piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her,

as if she was exactly who he expected to see.

In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in

front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun.

A long beat as Michael considers Bob.   Icy cold.

Michael stares at him blankly.

Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well

kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others

ease slightly.

Bob lowers the gun.

Michael remains silent.       Doesn't seemed shocked in the least

by what he's heard.

Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in

kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the

shotgun again.

Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to

the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic

table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob:

Michael just shakes his head.

Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob

blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun.

In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Michael rips the shotgun from Bob's

hands. It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find

himself holding air.

He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun

pressed to the bridge of his nose. Everyone freezes.

Michael's expression is totally calm.   Merciless.

But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared.   He squeezes his

eyes closed.

Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction.

Considering her.

The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand

and hook held up to show no threat. He's followed by Sandra

and Audrey.

Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.

But Michael doesn't seem to register this plea.   It's not

looking good.

No one BREATHES. That's when Kyle notices something out in

the direction of the road.

DOZENS OF TINY HEADLIGHTS APPEARING IN THE DARK HAZE.

APPROACHING.

Michael turns, sees the lights.

Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it

back into his hands. Bob's looks down at the gun,

speechless.

Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser.

Pops it, revealing a staggering ARSENAL OF WEAPONRY.

HE BEGINS TO LOAD GUN AFTER GUN.

Percy stares out at the lights, eyes wide.

Audrey pulls her mother back into the diner.

Michael hands an MP5 SUB-MACHINE GUN to Kyle. Another one

goes to Percy. Finally he places a third one in Jeep's

hands, who stares down at it anxiously.

Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep.

Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked

everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the

men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works.

He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie.   He cocks a

Glock and hands it to her.

He gives her a hard look.   She nods nervously.   Trusting him

but not sure why.

Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the

others, then he bolts after Michael.

Percy follows.   Then Charlie.

Now it's only Jeep and his father left.

And Bob rushes into the diner.

A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road.

THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER.       CLOSER.

He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands.

And races after his father.

A DEAD BOLT

Thrown.   Locking the diner door.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

Frantic activity. Kyle and Michael push a booth in front of

the door, sealing off the entrance.

Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields.

Window blinds are snap closed.

THE BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Jeep races in, locks the back door.       Then he pushes a desk in

front of it.

IN THE DINER - CONTINUOUS

The place is transformed. Locked up tight.        The ROAR OF

ENGINES outside grows ever LOUDER, CLOSER.

Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap.

She's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to

keep calm. He opens his eyes. Pale, weak from blood loss.

Sandra closes her eyes.        Struggling to believe it.

Suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT, dipping the room into

DARKNESS.

We hear CRIES OF ALARM.   TOTAL BLACK.   Chaos.

A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH

THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face.

Michael looks up at the ceiling.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - NIGHT

A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy

and Kyle. They quickly take their places behind the

"Paradise" sign. Pitch black surrounds them.

The RUMBLE OF ENGINES is gone, leaving only the RUSH OF THE

WIND coming up off the desert.

Bob turns to Michael sharply.

Michael is about to answer, when:

Over the wind, another sound becomes audible.

The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE.

The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct.

Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN.

But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with

dread.

TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the   darkness. And sure enough, an

ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly   toward the diner. The EERIE

CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from   a speaker on its roof. It's too

dark to see who's behind the   wheel.

The men quickly do as they're told.

Kyle, Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Jeep faces the boarded up front door, awkwardly holding the

MP5, trying to assume a tough guy posture. If only he could

stop shaking, it might be believable.

Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the

windows. The ICE CREAM TRUCK'S HEADLIGHTS fan across the

diner.

Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows.

Charlie stops next to Jeep. Senses him shaking. Rests a

hand on his arm. And that seems to help...a little.

Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the CALLIOPE.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

The Ice Cream Truck pulls to a stop with its headlights

facing the diner.

Everyone aims their guns at the truck.     Tense.

From the Ice Cream Truck...a DARK BLOODY SHOE STEPS to the

ground.

MOVING up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to

reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. Say

hello to THE ICE CREAM MAN.

He looks like he's been through hell -- literally. As he

steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even

more clearly.

He's tall. Too tall. His clothes don't seem to fit him.

And he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like

taffy. If he got down on all fours, you might mistake him

for some kind of spider. He surveys the diner, the garage,

the roof -- assessing the situation.

On the roof, the men wait for something to happen.

The Ice Cream Man's gaze snaps up to the roof.      He heard.

That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHING

TORTUROUSLY DOWN TO NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST! ROW

AFTER ROW OF A RAZOR SHARP TEETH FORM with the sickening

sound of CRACKING OF BONES.

From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth

shattering HOWL.

Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with

fear.

And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING

SPEED! His movements aren't at all like those of a normal

man, but rather like some kind of HUMAN INSECT.

Michael aims.

BLAM!   BLAM!   BLAM!

Bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on

his back. Still. Arms and legs in a twisted, twitching

mess.

Michael keeps his aim.    Waits.   The CALLIOPE music continues

to play.

Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A

freeway full of VEHICLES of every variety punch through the

wall of dust, racing toward the diner. They are THE

COMMUTERS.

The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER.

WINDSHIELDS SHATTER!    TIRES BLOW OUT!   ENGINES EXPLODE!

Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE!

DARK SHAPES bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering.

In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch glimpses of them: BUSINESS

PEOPLE. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. EVEN AN ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL

FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many

mere BALLS OF FLAME drifting through the darkness.

The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions.

They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't

actually touch the ground.

From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow

Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight.

Their faces lighting up with each FLASH.

SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from

a sprinkler.

BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't

seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in

their sheer numbers.

With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the

diner.

ON BOB firing madly.    Then...   CLICK!   CLICK!   Oh, no.   He's

out of ammo.

Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch

and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.

With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down

for the ammo. Stretching... Further...

A HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM

BELOW THE ROOFLINE! Her hair must have been in curlers

before most of it BURNED AWAY. Her nightdress hangs in

tatters off her body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she

clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT.

Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts

to slip down toward her. She's coming fast!

Percy sees his friend in trouble.

Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the

bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide

even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he

can't stop!

BOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP

RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!

She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something

akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! WHAM!

The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing

force halts Bob's slide.

Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays

on.

But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more.

Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH!

Percy tosses Bob a Glock. Fortunately this time Bob deftly

catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman

pounces on him.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The back of her head EXPLODES. Her body

goes limp. Bob struggles to push the corpse off of him.

Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety.

INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

Hiding in the shadows... listening to sounds of WAR just

outside.

Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears.   A few feet away,

Audrey clutches a butcher's knife.

Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another.   Trying to

keep it together.

Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the

handgun close to her pregnant belly. Distant EXPLOSIONS

rattle the plates on the shelves.

Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the

front windows.

Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds.

Another FLASH lights up Charlie's face.    Staring.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

Percy is swivelling left and right, firing like mad.

Closer and closer the creatures come.   Most are eviscerated

by the fire from the rooftop.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

ON CHARLIE staring at the window.    CLOSER.   Charlie's eyes go

wide as --

SMASH!   A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window.    Glass,

sand and dust swirl in.

Audrey and Sandra SCREAM.

Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready.

Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically

for the intruder. It's so dark!

Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She

looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's

too much.

Suddenly Howard's body is TORN AWAY from Sandra. Something's

got hold of his legs!   That gets Sandra's eyes open!

Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through

the diner toward the broken front window. He flails about,

desperately trying to grab a hold of something.

Sandra scrambles after her husband.   Reaching for him.

The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's

outstretched hands. She has him!

The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered

window.   It turns back toward Sandra -- a shaft of light

falling across its face, reveals:

A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age.   Her skin is a deathly

blue. Her pupils a GHASTLY WHITE.

Deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated

flesh on her arms, neck and face. The self-inflicted wounds

of a drug addict. Her voice is not QUITE HUMAN.

Sandra screams, holds on.

Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's

arms.

Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but

with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. So he

discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms.

Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched.   A human

tug-of-war.

ON HOWARD'S FEET -- TWO MORE SETS OF SINEWY MUSCLE AND BONE

CLAWS REACH THROUGH THE WINDOW AND GRAB HIS LEGS.

Howard's body lurches further out the window.

Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie

daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain

leverage.

ANOTHER DISFIGURED HAND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BLINDS AND LOCKS

ONTO CHARLIE'S ARM!

Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window,

losing her grip on Howard's belt.

Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY

LOOKING MAN. He smiles at her like a father coming home to

his baby girl.

And he starts to pull her arm even harder...Other creatures

suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she

alone was their target.

Jeep immediately let's go of Howard and dives for Charlie,

grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through.

Without the help, Audrey and Sandra can't hold on any longer.

Howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the

window.

EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

The tide is turning. The men seem to have gotten their game

on and the dark shapes are starting to pull back.

Kyle turns happily to Michael.     Gone.   Kyle looks around the

roof with alarm.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Only a few more inches separate Charlie and certain death

through the window. Jeep's losing her!

A FLASH OF STEEL.    SCHING!

Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like

hands still grasping Charlie's arm no longer attached to

their owners.

Michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a

machine gun in the other. He lights up everything in his

path. The window blinds become a WALL OF FIRE. Creatures

SCREECH and flee into the night, having successfully taken

their first victim.

Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and

Jeep scoot away from the window.

Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael. She's going

after Howard. He intercepts her before she can make it out.

Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from

the window and thrusts her down into a back booth.

Sandra breaks down.

As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain.       She

clutches her belly. Winces.

Jeep catches her arm to steady her.

She glances back at Michael.       He's watching her.   Those eyes.

Charlie doesn't know how to respond.      She's about to say

something when --

Kyle rushes into the room.       A smile on his face.

Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his

excitement falling.

No one responds.   Sandra and Audrey are huddled together.

Crying.

Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the

adrenaline.

Bob grabs Kyle's arm.

All eyes on Michael.    These people want answers.      Finally:

Everyone takes that in for a moment, then:

That silences the room.

Michael looks squarely at Percy.

Michael considers Jeep, then:

Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that.

Bob falls silent, confounded.

Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael.

Charlie reacts in shock, as all eyes are suddenly on her.

In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can

do when told such a thing. She LAUGHS.

But Michael isn't joking and Charlie's laughter becomes

genuine fear.

Jeep stares at Charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is

starting to make sense.

At this Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her.

Michael nods.

Charlie sways on her feet.   Jeep rests a hand on her

shoulder, steadying her.

With a CLANK Michael re-arms his weapon, turns to the group

with finality.

Everyone exchanges terrified looks.   Finally, Kyle steps

forward.

Jeep looks anxiously at Charlie, silent, scared, and then he

follows after Michael, leaving Charlie to stare at the

SHATTERED WINDOW, the blinds flipping wildly in the wind.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE NIGHT

Percy and Kyle keep watch, rifles at their sides. They're

wrapped up from head to toe in blankets to protect them from

the cold and the flies.

Percy scans the horizon.   Momentary SPECTRAL FLASHES dot the

darkness.

Percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his "hands"

together to keep them warm. Kyle notices. Sees the dog

tags.

Kyle nods. Scared. He takes out his 45.     Nervously switches

it from hand to hand.

Percy looks at him skeptically.

Kyle's eyes narrow.

Percy just stares at him, penetrating.     Finally:

Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to

the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them.

THE SILVER ZIPPO

rolls between dirty fingers.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - NIGHT

Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up

some steaks with the other. He pauses in his cooking every

few moments to take a slug from a can of beer. Can't get it

down fast enough.

Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a

prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread

around.

Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes. He pulls

another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it and

places it in front of her.

She looks up at him.    Smiles weakly.   Takes a sip.

Sandra takes another sip of beer.   Considers it.

The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her

again. She gathers up some pills from the counter, tosses

them back and downs her beer like there's no tomorrow. This

is a battle she's losing.

Meanwhile in a booth across the diner, Audrey is fiddling

with Percy's old radio. Back and forth on the dial.

Listening for anything. Nothing but STATIC.

Up at the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael

nail broken table planks across the shattered window. He

eyes the strange tatoos running down Michael's arms, the two

jagged wounds visible above his shirt line.

Michael considers the question a beat, then:

Michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window.

Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:

Michael picks up his gun.

Michael heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him,

deep in thought.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAWN

The faintest glint of sunlight through the dark red dusty

haze. A new day has forced itself into existence.

TITLE:   "December 24th - 6:05am"

EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - ROOF - MORNING

Michael is searching the horizon in front of the diner for

movement. His expression focused, determined.

On the other side of the roof, Bob keeps watch, struggling to

stay awake. The beer taking over. His eyes droop closed.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Sandra awakens with a start.

But Howard's not there. And everyone else in the diner is

still asleep. The drugs have started to wear off... and her

fear is returning.

INT. DINER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sandra splashes water on her face.   Stares at herself in the

mirror. A living wreck.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Sandra steps out of the bathroom.

Sandra freezes.

A beat then:

Sandra spins around.    Searching.

It sure sounded like Howard.

This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from.      Sandra

turns to face the BACK DOOR. A desk blocks it.

Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door.

Sandra is stricken.    What the hell is she going to do?

That's when Sandra notices the TRANSOM WINDOW above the door.

She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see

out.

SANDRA'S POV:

Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away from the door.     NAILED

TO AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS.

But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible

black boils. And even worse than that. Howard's boils are

breathing.

Sandra goes slack with horror.

Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES

covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony.

Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it

away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when

Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway.

Kyle races to restrain Sandra.

She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags

Kyle in the face. Down he goes.

Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her.

INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

The SHOUTING from the back office awakens the rest of the

sleepers. Percy springs up. Charlie is shaking Jeep.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

The ROAR OF WIND ripping off the plain is all that can be

heard. ON BOB as his head drops down with drunken fatigue.

Sleep.

RISING OVER HIM TO SEE...

Howard nailed to the upside-down cross below.

INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - SAME

Sandra and Audrey are locked in battle. Sandra slaps Audrey

hard. Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor. Percy

appears in the doorway.

Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and

that's when the world hits SLOW MOTION.

Howard is there.    A few feet away.   Alive.

Sandra races toward him.    Just behind her comes Percy.

And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL --

-- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying

streams of dark fluid toward Sandra --

-- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her

from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not

stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door

SLAMMING closed behind them.

Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into

the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground.

But she's not fighting anymore.

Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his

back to the door, breathing heavily.

He takes a step forward, then falls to ground.

The entire back side of his body is gone.      Burned away.

A SHEET

covering a body.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - FREEZER ROOM - DAY

Percy's body lies covered on the table. Bob stares ruefully

at his dead friend. A broken man. Tears stream down his

face. He rolls the Zippo between his fingers.

Jeep watches his father from the doorway.

Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead

friend.

SANDRA'S FACE

Catatonic.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - A SHORT WHILE LATER

Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair. Not like it

looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never

know.

Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously. Michael

never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at

her. It's not lecherous. More like a protective father

making sure his child hasn't strayed too far.

In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrains

her mother. Then she returns her attention to Percy's radio.

Tuning. Trying to find something, anything in the STATIC.

She brings her ear up close.      Wait.   Is that a VOICE?

She adjusts the antenna, trying to bring the signal into

focus. CLEARER.

CLEARER.   Yes.   It's a VOICE!

Everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around

the radio.

THROUGH THE HAZE OF STATIC, A GRAVELY, TIRED VOICE.      STRAINED

BEYOND BELIEF. BUT STILL BROADCASTING.

Bob looks over at Charlie, defeated. She shakes her head,

anger building. She sweeps some plates off the counter and

races for the bathroom.

A CIGARETTE

being lit.

INT. DINER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Charlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water

running, stealing a private moment. She takes a deep drag,

feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant.

Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her

hand along the curvature of her belly. Tears well up in her

eyes, fear and anger overtaking her.

She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration.

INT. DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER

It's quiet. DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie,

wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought.

Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her.

Jeep sees the strain on her face.

Jeep smiles, nods.

A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then:

She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:

Jeep's face hardens.   He gets up.   Hurt.   Frustrated.

And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare

after him, disturbed and surprised by his response.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE AFTERNOON

Sand and wind.    The INVISIBLE SUN is sinking.

Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping

watch. Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5.

Audrey flips the safety.

She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding

one all her life.

Off Kyle's surprised look:

After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on.   Hands

the gun over to Kyle.

Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her

expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years

overnight.

Kyle considers her thoughtfully.

She smiles at this confession.    Can obviously relate.   He

wipes a tear from her cheek.

She leans in.   Kisses him.   Passionately.   Desperately.

His hands trace over her body.

She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control.

She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up.

It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over.

She moves down his chest.     Further.   Kyle leans his head

back. Further.

Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come

to life.   The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant

red word "Paradise" illuminated above them.

Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP.      The station's

FLUORESCENTS flicker on.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

All at once the entire diner COMES BACK TO LIFE.

The jukebox WHIRS ON, filling the room with Merle Haggard's

"I'm a Lonesome Fugitive".

Bob's TV glows with bright rolling STATIC.

The electric fan spins on above the grill.

Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the

window.

Charlie is giving Sandra some water through a straw.

Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

The truck stop is lit up like a Christmas tree. If you

didn't know better, you might mistake the place for business

as usual. Kyle and Audrey stand on the roof, taking in the

dramatic change.

HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway.

Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face.    Then he

pulls out his silver 45.

The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off

the highway to stop at the pumps.

They aim their weapons at the vehicle.

A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car.

He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the

coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and

YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car.

He races around to the gas pump.

A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look

out over the back side of the diner.

AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast.

Kyle looks urgently back at the family.    The father lifts the

pump. Flips the lever.

Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family.

But down below, the man can only hear the sound of RAGING

WIND as he pumps the gas.

Kyle fires his gun in the air.   BLAM!   BLAM!     BLAM!

At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the

roof.   His family heard it too and they start to SCREAM TO

HIM. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but

he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe.

Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner.

The father dashes to the driver's side.    He throws open the

door.

But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time

to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM.

His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows.

Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that

surround the vehicle like swarming insects.

The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from

the vehicle by skeletal hands.

So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto

the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the

ground in front of the diner.

Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the

woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on.

He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything

that comes at him.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

The group gathered at the window sees Kyle racing out toward

the pumps.

Bob springs into action.   Pushes the booth away from the

front door.

The sound of a gun COCKING.

Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably

agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display.

He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures

huddled around them.

He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively

covering his face.

Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms.

Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening.

The creatures have stopped coming at him.

In fact, they're just standing there watching him.   Waiting.

Kyle freezes.   CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly

wrong.

Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms.   GHOSTLY WHITE EYES

stare back at him.

A FLASH OF TEETH AS KYLE'S THROAT IS TORN OUT.

Kyle drops to his knees.

Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Bob kicks over a table in disgust.

Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and

run towards Kyle.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

The young boy stands over Kyle, silently watching the life

drain from his body.

The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears

suddenly appear in his eyes. He opens his arms pleadingly to

her.

Audrey raises the 45 and ...     CLICK.   CLICK.   CLICK.

She keeps pulling the trigger.    Nothing.

The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an

eerie calm for someone so young.

The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body.

Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the

diner. Blocked by advancing creatures.

They're everywhere.    She's trapped.

She notices the open door to the MINIVAN.     And so she BOLTS.

Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly

closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK!

She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press

against the windows. A nightmare come to life.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Panic.

Charlie rushes to Michael's side.

But he's immovable.

Charlie COCKS the gun, moves toward the door.

Charlie looks back at him, defiant.   No one breathes.   Then:

Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the

dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed

Charlie and out into hell.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps.

IN THE MINIVAN, Audrey screams as the windows begin to CRACK.

She's running out of time.

Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at

the minivan. What's he up to?

The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if

they've just now noticed him.

And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait,

there's more to this trick. Up comes Michael's Glock in his

other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

The spray of gas EXPLODES into a SPRAY OF FIRE!

The MINIVAN is engulfed in flames.

Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through

the night.

The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of

glass.

Michael drops the gas pump.

He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and

unlocks the door.

Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED

BY A RING OF FIRE.

Meanwhile, fire is spreading quickly under the car...

Michael pulls Audrey from the flaming vehicle.

And together they run toward the open diner door.

BEHIND THEM THE MINIVAN EXPLODES.   A BALL OF FIRE ROARS AT

THEM!

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

Everyone's eyes go wide at the insanity they're witnessing.

Audrey is the first one in.

Michael is almost there.   But the fire is faster, ENGULFING

HIM IN FLAME!

BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into

the diner. Jeep slams the door CLOSED just as the WALL OF

FIRE REACHES THEM.

Everyone hits the deck as the FIRE SHOOTS THROUGH THE SLATS

covering the windows like spindly fingers reaching for prey.

Michael's clothes are a smoky, smoldering mess.   Jeep and Bob

rush to pat him down.

Audrey's coughing from the smoke.

Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink.    She fills up

a pitcher of water.

She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher...

And SCREAMS!

The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her

wielding an ENORMOUS BUTCHER'S KNIFE.

The pitcher shatters LOUDLY on the floor.

The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress

outfit covering her pregnant belly.

Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She

frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy.

But she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room

to maneuver.

That's it.    She's backed against the end of the counter!

The boy raises the knife to strike.

Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in

front of her body like a shield, as the KNIFE IS DRIVEN DOWN.

CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's

hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the

blade.

The knife CLATTERS to the ground.

The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but

there's no knife.

Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his

THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps.

Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the

boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her.

Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie,

guns ready for action. But the boy is gone.

Charlie shakes her head no.

That's when the electricity goes out once again, PLUNGING THE

DINER BACK INTO DARKNESS.

FLASHLIGHT BEAMS fan out across the diner.

LIGHTING under chairs.    Under tables.

A SCAMPERING SOUND... MOVING FAST.    Everybody spins to track

the location of the sound.

As soon as they move in one direction, the SCAMPERING is

heard in another.

Jeep's LIGHT CATCHES SOMETHING ON THE GROUND.      A TRAIL OF

BLOOD.

THE BEAMS OF LIGHT JOIN TOGETHER, MOVING FAST TO TRACK THE

BLOOD ACROSS THE DINER WHERE IT ENDS AT...

A WALL...

Jeep raises his LIGHT UP THE WALL WHERE THE TRAIL OF BLOOD

REACHES THE CEILING AND...STOPS.

SCREECH!   THE BLOODY BOY SPRINGS OFF A TABLE BEHIND THEM AND

LANDS ON BOB'S BACK.

Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly

strong arms away from his neck.

Jeep can't get a clear shot.       Bob's gasping for air.

Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's

back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put.

Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked

creature into the air.

Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF

GUNFIRE AND INHUMAN SCREAMING fill the diner.

And then in moments...      All is QUIET.

BEHIND THE COUNTER, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet.       She

WINCES. Doubles over, clutching her stomach.

Michael lowers his flashlight.      CLEAR FLUID runs down

Charlie's legs.

EXT.   PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT

Inky darkness.   A flickering light emanates from within the

diner.

TITLE:   "December 25th - 3:33am"

The sound of CHARLIE'S SCREAM, carries us to:

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT

Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with

Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her

legs. Pots of steaming water surround them.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

Bob and Jeep keep watch.

The SPECTRAL LIGHTS in the distance seem to be growing larger

-- closer.

Charlie's SCREAMING rises up from below.

Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice.

Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound...

A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as

if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed.

The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold

numbers.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

Michael reacts to the sound. An urgency comes over him.

Audrey arrives with more steaming water.

Charlie pushes, tears streaming down her face, delirious with

pain. It's a gruesome, bloody affair. It's getting close.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

Jeep and Bob watch helplessly as the ARMY OF CREATURES has

closed within a hundred yards of the diner. Their ranks

stretch back seemingly without end into the darkness.

Bob looks at his son.   The agony stretched across his face.

Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob

pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears

filling his eyes.

INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

Amidst the dirt and darkness, Charlie lets out a final

agonizing SCREAM...

...and then comes a BABY'S CRIES.   Audrey, eyes wide, holds

up the CHILD. Stunned. Elated.

Audrey places the child in Charlie's arms. She stares at the

baby, holding it at a distance, unsure of whether to embrace

it or be terrified by it. A commitment she's not yet ready

to make, even at this late hour.

Charlie looks to Audrey, tears streaming down her face.

Audrey looks to Michael, unsure.

Audrey nods, takes the baby back from Charlie, tries to

soothe him by pacing around the diner.

Another DRONE OF THE HORN RATTLES THE WALLS.      Menacing.

Closer.

Audrey   reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio,

trying   to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out

of the   STATIC, the haunting sounds of BING CROSBY singing

SILENT   NIGHT fills the room. The quiet before the storm.

Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up.     She stares

at him, a burning spite in her eyes.

Those words provide her little comfort.

Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much.

Off Charlie's look, we move across the diner where Audrey

approaches her mother, kneels down in front of her. Despite

how much her mother pisses her off, it breaks her heart to

see her in such a demoralized state.

If Sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face.

Tears well up in Audrey's eyes as she moves away from her

mother. But we HOLD here and...

DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandra's hands are

loosening the bonds. BLOOD TRICKLES from where the rope's

cut through her skin.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

DRIFTING THROUGH the dark shapes as the BABY'S CRIES

reverberate up and down the ranks. They begin to look about

frantically, agitated by the sound. Some even begin to back

away from the diner.

EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS

Off in the distance, the diner is but a dim flickering light

above the plain. It could almost be mistaken for a stable in

a desert town a long time ago.

THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky.

All around us the DARK CREATURES are cowering from sound of

the CRYING INFANT whose wails seem to grow even LOUDER the

further away from the diner we get.

HIGH ABOVE THE TRUCK STOP

In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of

creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all, the

truck stop.

The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND.

AND WE'RE DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE DINER ENTRANCE.   LIKE A

BIRD CIRCLING ITS PREY.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Jeep and Bob enter the diner to see Michael helping Charlie

to her feet, while Audrey continues to pace, the bundle of

bloody blankets cradled in her arms.

ON JEEP as the realization hits him.

Michael looks at Jeep.

Michael nods grimly.    Charlie looks urgently at Michael.

The baby CRIES LOUDER.

Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey.

Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie...

...AND THAT'S WHEN SANDRA SPRINGS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND

SNATCHES THE BABY FROM AUDREY'S ARMS!

Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door.

Hers is the face of madness.

Michael cocks his gun.   Points it at Sandra.

THE HORN BLARES ONCE MORE, DEAFENING, SHAKING EVERYTHING IN

THE DINER. IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes.

Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words

rattling her to the very core.

Sandra is almost to the front door.

CRASH!   THE DOOR IS TORN OFF ITS HINGES.

A brilliant SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner.

Sandra is blinded.   She raises a hand to block the light.

And that's when Michael fires.    BLAM!

Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her

forehead, and...

...THE BABY GOES FLYING OUT OF HER HANDS!

Charlie screams and the WORLD MOVES INTO SLOW MOTION...   And

everything suddenly goes very QUIET.

Michael fires again.   Blowing Sandra's body back through the

doorway.

Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air.

The time for Jeep to act is now!

Jeep DIVES for the baby...catching the bundle of rags mere

inches from the ground! And then he looks up to see...

The dark SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching from out of the

spectral light. A MAN WITH WINGS.

Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the

diner. But this looks like no angel we've seen before.

This is a creature built for war. Rough hewn, battle

scarred. His body armor making him appear disturbingly

insect like. His wings are not feathery or gentle. Rather

they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine.

The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision.

And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his

striking resemblance to Michael. We might even mistake them

for brothers.

His name is GABRIEL.

Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical

looking MACE in his powerful hands.

And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the

mace arcing down at Jeep.

Jeep rolls! CLANG! The weapon just misses him, hitting the

floor in a spray of sparks, literally CRACKING THE GROUND.

Gabriel brings the mace up again.   Jeep won't be so lucky

twice.

Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing.

Gabriel reacts by instantly UNFOLDING HIS WINGS and launching

himself into the air. The bullets clawing up the wall behind

him.

But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run

with the baby for the back of the diner. He thrusts the

child into Charlie's hands. And without even thinking, she

pulls the child protectively to her chest.

Gabriel drops down in front of Bob, whipping his wings around

like a deadly, RAZOR SHARP FAN!

Bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face.

His gun falling from his hands.

Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly.

With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the

diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the

stove.

Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into

the fray.

Jeep shakes his head, panic setting in.

Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face

Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words.

And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to

Michael's Police Cruiser.

Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the

baby. The responsibility crashing in on him. Then he closes

his hand around the keys, determination building.

Charlie looks past Jeep to see Michael returning to the fray.

He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office.

Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the

ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood.

Bob's half open eyes focus on his son. In his outstretched

hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER... and next to that, a

BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove.

Jeep is terrified.

Jeep tries to help him up.

Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:

And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Audrey and Jeep push the desk away from the door.

Charlie opens it.    Sand swirls in around her.

And Jeep leads the trio out the door.

INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

Michael and Gabriel square off in the diner, not like

enemies, but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible

family conflict.

Michael slowly approaches Gabriel.

Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face.    This was not

what he was expecting.

A beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens.

He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! --

LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it

wasn't bad-ass enough.

And the fight begins.

It's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems

under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior

weapon.

With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering

speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. The

place is getting absolutely shot to hell.

Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings

the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches.

Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to

fire. Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight

into the barrel of Michael's MP5. The gun explodes in

Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he

lands on the counter.

Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest,

sending him fluttering back.

Michael thrusts himself to his feet.   Gabriel recovers, jabs

again.

Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support

and lifts his body just above the deadly spike.

Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him.

Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of

punches.

Gabriel is rattled back by the assault.   He clumsily lifts

his mace and thrusts with it.

Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a

wall.

Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones.

A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing

back, losing his grip on the weapon.

Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back.

Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael

off. They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on. Choking

the life out of Gabriel.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

Audrey and Jeep help Charlie quickly move around the side of

the diner where the cruiser is parked. They are buffeted by

winds and sand.

Jeep puts Charlie and the baby into the front passenger seat

while Audrey hustles in back.

Jeep rounds to the driver's side.     Hops in.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

Jeep frantically tries to get the right key into the

ignition.

It's in.

Jeep turns the key but the ENGINE STRUGGLES TO FIRE UP.

Panic.

Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING.

A DARK SHAPE POUNCES ONTO THE HOOD OF THE CAR. The light

catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a

SHOPPING MALL SANTA CLAUS, his oversized belly gruesomely

distended.

Charlie screams.

Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE!

The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass

Jeep floors it, causing the cruiser to rocket backwards

toward the highway.

BUT THE CREATURE HANGS ON!

Jeep pulls the wheel hard and the cruiser whips around a full

180 onto the road.

THE CREATURE SHOOTS OFF THE CAR AND HITS THE ASPHALT.

Jeep throws it in drive just as the POSSESSED SANTA rises

from the pavement.

Pedal to the metal.

The creature doesn't have a chance as the cruiser PLOWS into

him.

BONES CRUNCH as a flash of red and white is sent sailing over

the car and tumbling down onto the road behind them in a

cloud of dust.

Jeep clenches the wheel, pedal to the floor.

Jeep places his Glock on the dash. He sees that he's got a

police issue shotgun in the front seat rack. Charlie

searches under her seat.   Pulls out a...GRENADE.

Charlie places it onto the seat.

Audrey fishes around in the backseat.

Audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

Gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush Michael.    He

fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent.

Gabriel runs/flies for the opposite wall. This one doesn't

hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom.

Unbelievably Michael is still holding on.

Gabriel is up. He thrusts himself back into the bathroom

mirror. It shatters painfully behind Michael.

Gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner.

Michael continues to ride him like a wild bull.

Gabriel slams Michael into a wall once more.   It's a brutal

struggle.

Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms

reach.

He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. From this

angle he'd never be able to hit Michael with it. Gabriel's

strength is giving way. Michael is winning.

Gabriel lets out a tremendous ROAR and plunges one of the

mace's long spikes into his own stomach. Michael's eyes go

wide with surprise, his grip loosens. Gabriel has run them

both through.

Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward.

Blood pours from a huge hole in Michael's chest.   Right

through his heart.

Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. Not nearly

as bad as Michael's. Apparently there's not a lot of blood

left in this guy.

Michael falls to his knees.   Weakening.

Gabriel looms over Michael.   Michael looks up at him, blood

leaking from his mouth.

Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head.

Michael closes his eyes.   Submitting.

The mace comes swinging down...

INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - SAME

The cruiser hits the FLY STORM. Black. Nothing is visible

beyond the windows. BUZZING surrounds them. DEAFENING.

Jeep turns on the windshield wipers.     Hits the brights.

PING!   PING!   PING!   Driving blind!

ON THE SPEEDOMETER as their speed slows to a crawl.

Charlie's desperately trying to soothe her SCREAMING baby.

ON THE AIR VENTS as FLIES start crawling in.

INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Gabriel is looking down upon Michael's broken body.

Something is happening to his skin. The DARK WRITING THAT

COVERS HIS BODY is beginning UN-WRITE itself and DISAPPEAR...

INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - SAME

Charlie is struggling to close the air vents to stop the

inflow of BUZZING insects. It's not working!

She looks to Jeep in desperation, but something more

frightening catches her attention.

The INTRICATE WRITING is beginning to appear on Jeep's arm,

snaking its way up from his wrists like VINES.

Jeep sees it, eyes go wide.

A beat, as Jeep remembers Michael's parting words...

INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

Gabriel watches as the last of the writing FADES from

Michael's body when he hears a faint CLICKING sound from

somewhere in the diner.

Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward

the source of the CLICKING.

He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive

pool of blood.

It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING

sound is coming from Bob's SILVER ZIPPO.

Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to

lighting that lighter. CLICK... CLICK... CLICK...

Bob looks at Gabriel.

And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty ZIPPO

IGNITES.

Gabriel's eyes go wide as the TINY FLAME DANCES in front of

the stove's broken gas line.

Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes.

A STREAM OF FIRE ENGULFS HIM AS HIS WINGS UNFOLD AND HE LEAPS

INTO AWESOME FIERY FLIGHT.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

The MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the slow moving vehicle.

In the rearview mirror, Jeep sees the CLOUD OF FIRE

MUSHROOMING UP in the sky behind them. It's eerily

magnificent.

Jeep looks back to the road as, sure enough, the FLY SWARM

suddenly dissipates all around them, revealing a CLEAR VIEW

of the highway ahead. Jeep knows at what price this good

fortune has come.

AND THAT'S WHEN THE WORD "PARADISE" CRASHES DOWN LIKE A BALL

OF FIRE ONTO THE ROAD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM!

EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

The cruiser PUNCHES through the burning "Paradise" sign,

smashing it into fiery pieces!

The cruiser charges on down the endless highway, burning bits

of sign swirling in its wake.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

From the back seat, Audrey watches the fire recede into the

distance.

Up front Jeep stares out at the dark road ahead.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

Burning wreckage everywhere.

DRIFTING THROUGH IT until we settle on the SPIKE-SCEPTER

stuck firmly in the ground. Flames ring the handle.

EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME

The cruiser blazes down the highway.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - SAME

Charlie cradles the baby, apprehensive. The baby looks up at

her, smiles. She can't help but smile back at him. Jeep

eyes her.

Charlie looks over, feels his lingering anger.

Charlie's reacts, a bit stung.

Jeep tries to hide his pleasure that the tables have turned

at least a little. Charlie is about to respond when Audrey

leans in from the back seat.

She points ahead to a beaten up road sign that says:

"Now Entering Red Rock National Park, Next Rest Stop 30

MILES"

CRASH!

The roof buckles above them.   The windows BLOW OUT.

EXT. RED ROCK NATIONAL PARK ROOD - CONTINUOUS

GABRIEL SMASHES DOWN ON THE CRUISER'S ROOF WITH MASSIVE

FORCE!

USING HIS MIGHTY WINGS FOR BALANCE HE BEGINS TO STOMP ON THE

ROOF, CRUSHING IT DOWN AS IF IT WERE A SODA CAN!

INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

Jeep, Charlie and Audrey slip frantically down in their seats

as the roof presses down at them. The windows BURST.

Jeep grabs the Glock and fires wildly up at the roof.

EXT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

Gabriel takes a direct hit in the thigh, causing him to slide

off the roof and onto the trunk where he grabs a hold of the

rear window frame for support.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

With tremendous strength, Gabriel pulls his upper body

through the broken back window toward Audrey.

Jeep swings the gun around.

BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow

him down.

Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding

Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without the

risk of hitting Audrey.

Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now.

Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her

hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes

off INSIDE THE CAR!

Jeep ducks. The CAR SWERVES MADLY. The flare RICOCHETS

through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July!

Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the

windshield - PING! - and nails him right in the face, SETTING

HIS HAIR ABLAZE.

And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and FIRE.

BOOM! Gabriel is blown back partially through the rear

window. He holds onto the car with an iron grip. Starts to

pull himself back in. Nothing slows this guy down.

Jeep pulls the trigger again and...CLICK.    No bullets!

Audrey frantically reloads the flare gun. Brings it up to

fire, but he's too fast! WHACK! Gabriel knocks her into the

side of the car with a sweep of his hand. She's out cold.

Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again.

Jeep knows there's only one thing to do.

Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in

front of the passenger seat.

Jeep PUNCHES IT.   The speedometer leaps ahead.

70...80...90...

Gabriel's now completely in the car.   They're helpless.

Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie,

his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when...

Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just

in time. He flails wildly about but this young girl rides

him like one helluva a cowboy.

100...110...120...

JEEP SLAMS ON THE BREAKS, SENDING GABRIEL AND AUDREY SHOOTING

FORWARD THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD LIKE A BULLET.

The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road

with a sickening crunch and ROLL INTO A BALL OF FIRE.

EXT. RED ROCK PARK - CONTINUOUS

The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and

careening into a large rock formation.

This ride is over.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

Jeep's side of the car is crushed.   Blood is running down his

forehead.

Charlie crawls up from the floor.

He tries to focus on her.

She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out.

Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from

the demolished Cruiser.

EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - PRE-DAWN

Jeep and Charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the

long climb up the ridge.

Charlie looks up.

STARS completely fill the pre-dawn sky.   Breathtaking.

Jeep follows her gaze to the sky.

Endless stars.    Confounding.

Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead.

They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when --

GABRIEL ROCKETS UP IN FRONT OF THEM!

Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way

just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up

a cloud of dust.

Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has

done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away.

Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including

a large part of his head, revealing that under his human

visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE.

Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM!

Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's

hand.

Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin,

rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel

knocks Jeep savagely to the ground.

Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at

Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt

again.

Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.   Raises his

fists. This kid will simply not give up.

Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it,

shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear

off the ground.

Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at

Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope.

Charlie watches in horror.

But Gabriel is doing just that. Jeep is rapidly losing

consciousness. The battle is lost.

Jeep's eyes flutter.   He's almost gone.

This gets Gabriel's attention.

Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to

him.

Tears run down her face.   She's dead fucking serious.

Gabriel lets go of Jeep.   He falls to the ground, gasping

desperately for air.

Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her.

He peels the cloth back, revealing...

THE GRENADE.

He spins around to face Charlie.

She's holding the pin.

KABOOM!

GABRIEL IS BLOWN TO BLOODY BITS.

The creature is gone at last.

The sound of a BABY COOING.

Charlie picks the child up out of the brush.

She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make

their way to the top of the ridge.

EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - DAWN

Jeep and Charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below.

ON THEIR FACES, reacting to what they see.

Charlie takes Jeep's hand in hers.

And now we see it too:

THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN

Vast.   Barren.   No signs of life.

No resistance force.    No nothing.

ON JEEP AND CHARLIE

Taking it in.     Breathing hard.

He glances at Charlie.    Worry in her eyes.

At those words, Charlie looks deep into Jeep's eyes.       Sees a

confidence in them she's never seen before.

And she leans in and kisses him.      Tender.

When they part, Jeep stares back at her with surprise.      Then

the surprise melts into a smile.

And they descend the ridge...out of sight, leaving us with a

view once again of --

THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN

A BLOOD RED SUN rises behind the distant mountains. The

unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat.

And we're back where we started.

A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.

IT'S CHARLIE'S VOICE.

INT. CAR - DRIVING - MORNING - WEEKS LATER

Jeep is at the wheel. He looks aged, scarred from the

experience. His exposed arms are completely covered with the

INTRICATE WRITING...The Instructions. The boy he once was is

gone at last and the warrior protector has replaced him.

Charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms.

It's strange, but you might actually mistake them for a happy

family. Of course you'll have to ignore the ARSENAL OF

WEAPONRY in the back seat.

Jeep glances over at Charlie and the baby.   He smiles at the

image of maternal bliss.

The sun shines through the car windows, filling our eyes with

its fiery light.
