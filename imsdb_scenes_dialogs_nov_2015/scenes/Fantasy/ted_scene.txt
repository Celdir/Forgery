EXT. SPACE - X

As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to

slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States.

The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through

the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see

large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's

winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one

small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear

the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart.

EXT./ESTAB. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

We see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at

each other in the street.

Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled,

and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball-

throwing kids points at the sled kid.

The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle

him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy

and innocent-looking) approaches the melee.

The kids all look at him.

The Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John.

The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly

walks back toward his house.

INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

John sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands,

looking outside. John'S POV - We see the other kids all

playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing

snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A

WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with

open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun.

INT. A SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING

A LITTLE GIRL opens a present as her parents look on,

smiling. Inside is a My Little Pony. She smiles with

delight.

INT. ANOTHER SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING

A LITTLE BOY opens a present as HIS PARENTS look on,

smiling. Inside is a G.I. Joe Hovercraft. The boy is

overjoyed.

INT. A THIRD SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING

ANOTHER LITTLE BOY opens a present as his parents look on,

smiling. Inside is a "Darth Vader head" action figure case.

The boy opens it up, revealing that it's full of "Star Wars"

action figures. The boy jumps around ecstatically.

EXT./ESTAB. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING

INT. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - SAME

John sits amidst unwrapped gifts. We see him opening a

present. Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear.

The boy holds it with delight.

HIS MOM AND DAD hug him.

John hugs the teddy bear. It makes a cutesy, high-

pitched "I wuv you" sound. John gasps with delight.

John giggles happily, squeezing the bear to make it talk,

as his mom and dad exchange a smile.

INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

John sits on the floor watching the 1980 film "Flash

Gordon" on TV. He eats Twizzlers with Ted sitting next

to him. Occasionally he gives Ted a "bite."

INT. JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Teddy looks back at him, expressionless.

He squeezes Ted, who once again makes the "I wuv you"

sound.

John gets into bed with the teddy bear, and snuggles with

it.

John drifts off to sleep. The camera moves toward the

window, and drifts outside. It pulls back from the house

slowly.

EXT. JOHN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The camera pivots around to face the sky. We see the

snow falling from moonlit clouds. At the center of the

clouds, there is a small patch of open air through which

we can see stars. Suddenly, a shooting star whizzes by

through the opening.

INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

SLOWLY PUSH IN on the teddy bear's face as John lies

sleeping next to it.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NEXT MORNING

The house and yard are covered with snow.

INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SAME

John slowly opens his eyes. He turns over to face Teddy,

but we see that Teddy is no longer next to him. John

bolts upright and looks around, frantically.

John looks under the covers, but the bear is not there.

He jumps out of bed and looks around the bed's perimeter,

assuming that Teddy must have fallen off during the

night. Finally, he checks underneath the bed. ANGLE

FROM UNDERNEATH THE BED we see John looking around.

John sits up again and freezes, looking right into the

camera, wide eyed. ANGLE ON JOHN'S P.O.V.: We see the

face of Teddy staring right at him. Teddy blinks once.

John yelps and stumbles back, falling over. He stares at

Teddy, breathing heavily.

A huge grin spreads across John's face. He gets up, runs

to Teddy and hugs him.

INT. KITCHEN - SHORTLY AFTER

John's Dad sits at the breakfast table, reading the paper

as John's Mom prepares eggs and bacon, putting it on

their plates.

John runs into the kitchen.

John's Mom and Dad look at each other and smile.

Teddy walks in and stands next to John.

John's Dad scrambles to his feet, knocking plates off the

table. John's mom screams.

John reluctantly walks over to his dad, who grabs him and

protectively pulls him aside.

They stare at Teddy for a beat.

AA18 INT. ANOTHER NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV) AA18

INT. TONIGHT SHOW - DAY (ON TV)

We see REAL FOOTAGE of "The Tonight Show" from the `80's,

INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

John and Teddy are in bed, under the covers with a

Another thunder clap.

They hug as we PULL BACK SLOWLY, dissolving through the

covers.

Over the following, we continue to pull back from the

room to the outside of the moonlit house...

EXT. BOSTON SKYLINE - MORNING

"FORMER CELEBRITY BUSTED AT AIRPORT", with an

unflattering photo of Ted.

INT. AIRPORT - DAY (VIDEO)

We see Ted getting hauled away by security. A caption

below reads "Ted caught with mushrooms at airport

security". He's putting up a bit of a fight, and gives

the "finger" to the camera (the finger is pixilated).

ice cream on their upper lips.

EXT./ESTAB. - JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - DAY

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - DAY

John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up

behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and

grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss. We

ANGLE ON Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering

a "Home Sweet Home" picture into the wall. He steps

back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall.

He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there

like an idiot.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PHOTO)

John, Lori, and Ted sit on the couch. All three sit with

their legs crossed, faux-pretentiously raising glasses of

Jorian Hill Syrah to camera in identical poses, the wine

bottle on the table in front of them.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PHOTO)

We see a photo Ted has taken of himself. In the

background are John and Lori, playing Scrabble. Ted is

in the foreground, smiling at the camera as he holds up

his letters. He has spelled out the word "DOUCHE", with

an extra B and G to spare.

EXT. BOSTON COMMON - DAY (EXISTING FOOTAGE)

(Insert existing John/Lori swan boat footage.)

EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - MORNING

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME

CLOSE ON a bong. PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales,

his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for

the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is

ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple

stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's

evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's

been around for three decades. He and John, who sits

next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them.

John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-

worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a

box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,

he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the

remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity

Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,

though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that

this is a guy who has never really given up his

childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted

passes the bong to John.

John takes a hit from the bong over Ted's next line.

Ted takes a hit from the bong.

John gets up, and hurries into the other room to get

dressed.

EXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS

We see two shots of John's car driving through the city:

We see John in the passenger's seat putting Visine into

his eyes, with only Ted's ears and eyes showing as he

drives (his paws grip the wheel). We then cut to an

overhead pull-back shot as we move away from the car to

reveal it crossing Boston's huge suspension bridge.

EXT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - MORNING

John's car pulls up the street and into the parking lot,

scraping its side against the corner headlight of one of

the rental cars.

ANGLE ON Ted's feet. There are wooden blocks attached to

the pedals so that his feet can reach them. He slams on

the brakes. ANGLE OUTSIDE THE CAR. John gets out, and

looks at the damage.

ANGLE ON THE RENT-A-CAR OFFICE - THOMAS, the branch

manager, an intense, middle-aged man, is standing in the

doorway.

Thomas dryly waves back. Ted pulls forward, scraping the

car again. He abruptly pulls out into traffic, and

another car swerves a bit to get around him, honking.

Ted drives away.

INT. THOMAS' OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER

Thomas sits at his desk facing John.

Thomas takes out a framed picture of himself with Tom

Skerritt.

John exits.

INT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR FRONT OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

John emerges from Thomas' office, and walks out into the

front desk area.

We see his coworker, Guy (a burly Patrick-Warburton

type), handing a car key and a rental envelope to a

pleasant-looking couple. He looks tired, disheveled, and

a little bruised.

The couple exits. Guy turns to face John.

Guy starts to leave, when ALIX, a foreign guy with a

vague European accent, long dark hair, and a great tan

walks up.

We see TANYA, an unbelievably gorgeous salesgirl, enter

from the back with a set of keys.

Over the following, Tanya puts the keys away, walks over

to her station and sits.

EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME

John and Ted sit on the couch, in the same exact spots we

saw them earlier, bookending the day. John drinks a beer

as they watch TV. Ted lights up a bong and inhales. The

TV blares the opening titles of the 1980 film "Flash

Gordon." As "Flash's Theme" plays:

Ted jumps on John, and starts playfully punching him in

the face.

He throws Ted off of him.

ANGLE ON TV - We see Flash Gordon facing Ming the

Merciless.

The front door opens and LORI, an attractive girl in her

mid to late 20's, enters holding several grocery bags.

John gets up and gives Lori a kiss.

We see Lori roll her eyes. She's heard this before.

EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It's raining, with an occasional roll of thunder.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME

Lori lies in bed holding an iPad, reading a gossip news

site, with the TV on. John comes out of the bathroom,

and cozies up next to her.

She laughs.

She leans over and kisses him again. He kisses her back.

They continue to kiss, becoming more and more intimate.

She starts to pull his T-shirt off, when there is a

thunder clap from outside.

We hear another thunderclap. Ted runs into the room with

no warning and leaps into bed, right between Lori and

John.

Lori rolls over and goes to sleep with a groan.

EXT./ ESTAB. BOSTON HIGH RISE - DAY

Lori enters the building.

INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Lori gets off the elevator, where we see several signs

that read "PLYMOUTH PUBLIC RELATIONS." Lori goes to her

desk, looking exhausted. Lori's office friends, GINA,

MICHELLE, and TRACY approach.

INT. OFFICE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lori's boss REX (asshole handsome, mid-30's, expensive

suit) walks into the office, and approaches the gathering

of female employees.

Lori follows Rex and gives the girls a "help!" look.

Short beat.

INT. REX'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Lori sits across from Rex, who sits at a large desk.

Rex takes a framed picture out of a drawer, and shows it

to her.

Lori exits Rex's office. Rex casually gets up, strolls

over to her chair, nonchalantly brushes his hand on the

cushion where she was sitting, and nonchalantly smells

his hand.

INT./ ESTAB. CIAO BELLA RESTAURANT, NEWBURY STREET -

INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

John and Lori sit across from each other at a

romantically set table. They've just finished their

meal. John has the remains of a lobster shell on his

plate.

A WAITRESS approaches.

John holds up the front portion of the lobster shell,

which has the face and eyes on it.

The waitress walks away.

Another WAITER approaches with a bottle of champagne, two

glasses, and some chocolate-covered strawberries.

INT. CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

We see Lori out on the dance floor, amidst a sea of

dancing clubgoers. Nearby, we see John dancing with a

girl, and doing it very badly. He's putting too much

into it, obviously trying to impress her. The girl is

gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the

moves. John thrusts his butt back in one move,

accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force

to send her sprawling on the floor. As the crowd reacts

to this, we see that it is Lori. She starts to get up,

when John turns and rushes to help her to her feet.

She sits down. He reaches into a nearby glass, pulls out

a handful of ice, and wraps it in a napkin. He puts it

against her head. She inhales sharply for a moment.

They smile at each other...

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)

INT. SMOKY TAVERN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

We see John leaning against the bar, wearing a white Navy

officer's uniform, a la Ted Stryker in "Airplane!" as

"Stayin' Alive" blasts from the jukebox. ANGLE ON LORI,

who is up on the dance floor, done up like Julie Hagerty.

John takes his hat off, and tosses it O.S. coolly. He

struts up to the dance floor, locks eyes with Lori. They

circle one another for a beat. John suavely takes off

his jacket, twirls it in the air a few times, and tosses

it O.S. He then strikes a "finger up" disco pose, with a

bullet SFX. He and Lori begin disco dancing

simultaneously. He jumps up, locking his legs around

Lori, who spins him around in circles, as we cut back to:

INT. CIAO BELLA RESTAURANT - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)

They clink glasses, and take a sip.

John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small

box. Lori looks excited.

John slides the box over to Lori. She picks it up.

Lori unwraps the box and opens it. Inside is a pair of

nice, but not-super-expensive-looking earrings.

She opens up the card, which we see as John describes it.

It says, "Happy 4 year anniversary! Love you."

Lori hands John a small box. He opens it up, revealing a

very nice watch.

He puts it on his wrist.

She reacts a bit to this.

She laughs. So does he.

They both laugh hard.

EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Their car pulls up. They start to get out.

Lori punches his number on her cellphone. After a beat,

we hear The Imperial March from "The Empire Strikes

Back."

He reaches under the seat, fishing for the phone, as she

goes inside.

He continues digging for the phone, as she walks inside.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Lori walks toward the apartment, but stops as she hears

loud music coming from inside. She approaches the door

cautiously and opens it, revealing...

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Lori enters a haze of pot smoke, and a very much trashed

apartment (empty bottles, wrappers, etc.). Ted sits on

the sofa with a small group of trashy-looking women.

They're watching "Romancing the Stone," which plays very

loudly on the TV.

The girls ad-lib "Hello," "Nice to meet you," etc.

Lori glances around the room, then SCREAMS as she sees

something in the corner.

Lori is speechless with rage. At that moment, we see the

lobster head poke in aggressively from behind the door.

At that moment, John enters, holding his cell phone.

He stops, seeing everyone there.

INT./ESTAB. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - AFTERNOON

INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - SAME

Ted and John walk slowly down the ramp circling the

massive see-through tank, occasionally stopping to

observe some of the more bizarre varieties of fish. John

is oddly restrained. Something is on his mind. As they

stroll, we see a nearby man keeping an eye on them. He

seems much more interested in them than in the fish.

This, we will find out later, is DONNY...

Ted turns and stares at John for a beat.

Ted sits down on a bench, a little stunned and dazed.

John looks heartbroken at this response.

INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - MOMENTS LATER

Ted and John sit side-by-side on a bench next to the

penguin habitat.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Lori is staring at the O.S. poop in the corner. She is

trying to pick it up with a shoebox. In the background,

we can see an almost panicky, grossed-out John peering

out from behind the bathroom door.

INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - DAY

John hugs Ted. Ted hugs him back. We hear a squeak, and

a high-pitched recorded voice saying "I wuv you." John

and Ted pull away from each other uncomfortably.

That was the-- the thing-- The old-- Yeah-- no, I know-

that doesn't mean-- I'm not -

gay.

EXT./ ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

EXT. GROCERY STORE - SAME

John and Ted head toward the store. Ted is dressed in a

coat and tie, and looks very uncomfortable.

They pause as John straightens Ted's tie.

John discreetly pulls out a baggie of weed.

INT. GROCERY STORE MANAGER'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER

Ted sits opposite FRANK, the grocery store manager. We

see his name and title on a desk nameplate. Frank sits at

the desk, staring at Ted.

EXT. BOSTON COMMON - LATE AFTERNOON

(Over music:) John and Ted walk across the Common,

passing various park-goers. The occasional person

notices and points with a "Hey, isn't that..." sort of

look. They passes three cute girls who flag Ted down.

Two pose with him as the third takes their picture with

her cellphone. Ted poses for the photo with one hand on

the girl's breast. She laughs hard. Ted waves goodbye,

and he and John make their way over to a park bench.

They sit. John takes out the weed, looks around for a

beat, then starts to discreetly roll a joint.

John and Ted react, startled. John stuffs the weed in

his pocket, accidentally dropping the buds in the rolling

papers on the ground.

ANGLE ON a creepy-looking man glancing at them

repeatedly. This is Donny, the fat kid we saw in the

prologue. He has grown up into a thinner but no less

creepy man.

ADJUST TO REVEAL his son, who looks exactly like fat

young Donny from earlier.

BRIEF ANGLE ON the ground, where a pigeon is pecking at

the dropped weed.

He writes on a slip of paper and hands it to John. John

smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet.

Donny and Robert walk off. Donny turns and steals a

glance back at Ted as they move off.

John tugs on one of Ted's arms trying to creep him out.

He then breaks into a creepy falsetto.

They exit. After a beat, the pigeon flies into frame,

slamming right into a fucking tree.

EXT. ESTAB. A SHITTY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

John and Ted walk into the building. John carries two

cardboard boxes, and Ted carries one smaller one.

INT. AN ALMOST EMPTY APARTMENT - SAME

There's a couch, a coffee table, and a couple of boxes.

John and Ted put down their boxes, and stand just inside

the doorway.

They awkwardly nod to each other, both knowing that John

must leave soon.

They regard each other for a moment, then John slowly

turns and walks off down the hall. He turns back to

smile and wave. From John's POV, we see a diminutive-

looking Ted give a wan wave back. He looks very alone as

the camera recedes.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

John sits on the couch, putting his tie on as he watches

TV. Lori comes over and sits down next to him.

She gives him a kiss, and starts to undo his tie.

She laughs, and they kiss.

They kiss.

John pulls the Flash Gordon gun out of his pocket and

shows it to her. She cracks up.

EXT./ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - DAY

INT. GROCERY STORE - SAME

Ted is at his station, finishing checking out a customer.

The customer exits. Ted sighs with boredom. He turns to

ELLEN, the large African-American woman at the next

station.

ANGLE ON A VERY ATTRACTIVE blonde girl bagging groceries

a few aisles away (This is TAMI-LYNN).

Ted waves to the girl. She waves back. He makes a kissy

face at her. She giggles and blows him a kiss back. He

pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex. Her eyes

widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. He grabs

an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. The girl

laughs hysterically. CLOSE ANGLE on Ted, as white liquid

sprays all over his face from one side, then from the

other. WIDEN to reveal he's squirting two bottles of

pump hand soap on either side of him. The girl laughs

and shakes her head "no."

EXT. ESTAB./ LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - DAY

INT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - SAME

John sits at his workstation, playing a TBD video game on

his iPhone. Tanya approaches.

John's phone rings the theme from "Knight Rider." He

sees Ted's name pop up, with a photo of Ted smiling open-

mouthed at the camera, with his arms outstretched and a

bra on his head. John picks up.

INT. TED'S BATHROOM - DAY

Ted sits in the tub, talking on the phone. He has suds

in his hair, and there are a couple of little toy boats

in the water. From here, we intercut back and forth from

him and John.

John turns and looks back at Thomas in his office.

INT. THOMAS' OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

John stands in front of Thomas, who sits at his desk.

John smiles wanly, and exits.

EXT./ ESTAB. TED'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY

INT. TED'S NEW APARTMENT - SAME

ANGLE ON THE TV - Ted Danson sits in a chair, being

interviewed.

ANGLE ON Ted and John watching. They have a bong.

ANGLE BACK ON TV -

ANGLE BACK ON John and Ted -

John takes a hit off the bong, then glances around.

EXT. ESTAB. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

INT. RESTAURANT - SAME

John, Ted, Lori and Ted's dolled-up and sort of trashy

date Tami-Lynn (the bag girl from the grocery store) eat

dinner.

Tami-Lynn laughs heartily at this, as does John. Lori

isn't quite as delighted.

Lori stares at him for a beat, then:

Ted and Tami Lynn exit leaving John and Lori at the

table.

A beat. She sighs.

Lori can't help but let a small laugh escape. She

softens a bit...

He kisses her.

She smiles at him, then:

WIDER ANGLE on the restaurant. For a moment, nothing

happens.

Then, a guy at a table on the right (sitting with a

couple other men and women) screams into his napkin,

followed by his dining companions.

EXT./ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - DAY

INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Ted's boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a

clipboard. He looks up, and his expression turns to

confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at

Ellen's register.

He walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and

notices him.

He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms

off toward the back. He looks around the butcher's

counter and produce area, then walk into the back

storeroom.

INT. STOREROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE

ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost

naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging

her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away,

with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock

and horror.

INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER

Frank sits at his desk, addressing Ted.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT

We see the "CLOSED" sign on the door. Ted exits,

finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the

dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook

shot into a trash can. He takes the shot:

The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters.

We hear a soft footstep somewhere O.S. Ted turns and

looks around. There appears to be no one in the

darkness.

No answer. He looks around for a beat, and finds

nothing. He turns... and finds himself facing Donny, who

stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb.

Tami-Lynn approaches.

Ted hurries off. ANGLE ON DONNY, who looks eerily

determined.

EXT./ ESTAB. REX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

John and Lori walk up to the fabulously expansive house

in Cambridge. It's a very impressive estate with no

expense spared.

Rex throws open the door.

INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The party is a very costly-looking event: uniformed

servers walking around with trays of cocktails and hors

d'ouvres, tables laden with lavish-looking food displays

and floral arrangements, a 20-piece big band, and

hundreds of guests. A large banner reads "Happy 20th

Anniversary, Plymouth Public Relations."

Gina, Michelle, and Tracy approach. Everyone adlibs

their hellos to John and Lori. A waiter walks by with a

tray of champagne. Lori and the girls each take a glass.

INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - STAIRS AND UPSTAIRS

Rex and John are walking up the stairs to the second

floor of his house. Rex points out various items bought

at auction. John is visibly unenthused. He does not

like this guy, and definitely does not trust him.

Rex indicates a small, bronze-colored item on a stand.

John quickly pulls his hand away.

John is a bit surprised, not unpleasantly so, to hear

this.

They stand there for a beat, looking at Lance Armstrong's

nut. John's phone rings the "Knight Rider" theme. John

answers it.

INTERCUT PERIODICALLY BETWEEN JOHN AND TED, who stands in

the foreground with one finger in his ear. In the

background, we see a party in full swing.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

John looks down at the main area of the party, and sees

Lori happily chatting with her co-workers.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

John hangs up.

John races O.S.... and Rex raises his scotch glass to his

mouth.

EXT. REX'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The "Football Fight" music from "Flash Gordon" starts

playing, as John bolts O.S.

EXT. REX'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

John sprints out of the house and runs down the walkway.

He leaps over a hedge toward the parking area. He slides

across the hood of Lori's car, gets in, quickly starts

the car, and backs out.

EXT. BOSTON (VARIOUS) - NIGHT

CUT TO various shots of John racing through the city on

his way to Ted's. Finally, he pulls up to Ted's

apartment.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

John throws open the door. The place is as lively as it

can be. The party is packed with people, including Alix

and Tanya, John's co-workers from Liberty. There are

also a large number of booze-swilling guys and hot

chicks. Ted runs up, wearing a blazer.

John turns to look in the direction Ted is indicating.

The shot slows down into slo-mo as John's eyes widen, and

he sees...

OPPOSITE ANGLE - Across the room, SAM J. JONES turns in

slo-mo to face John. He is inexplicably still sporting

the same hairstyle he had in the "Flash Gordon" movie.

We hear the theme from "Flash Gordon." We INTERCUT back

and forth from him to John:

ON JOHN - He stands frozen in awe.

ON SAM - He smiles as he begins to walk toward the

camera, in John's POV.

ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.

ON SAM - Still slowly walking toward camera in John's

POV, but he is now dressed in the Flash Gordon costume.

ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.

EXT. MONGO SKY - DAY - FANTASY

Sam J. Jones flies on the flying Jetski from the movie.

John stands behind him on the back, with his arms around

Sam's chest, as if on the back seat of a motorcycle.

John has a huge, elated smile on his face.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - BACK TO SCENE

ON John - He still stares in awe.

ON SAM - He smiles and offers an outstretched hand for a

handshake.

BACK TO NORMAL SPEED - Sam walks up to John with Ted by

his side.

Sam passes out shots of Southern Comfort.

John and Ted look at each other, squealing with delight.

Everyone then does their shots.

John and Ted don't answer for a beat. They look at each

other nervously. It's clear neither one has any

experience with this sort of thing.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - SHORTLY AFTER

John, Ted, and Sam emerge from the bathroom. John's eyes

are wide and enthusiastic. Ted has a little bit of

powder on his nose, and his ears are flattened back. And

Sam is just playing it cool.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER

John and Ted sit staring at each other intensely across

the table.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - SAME

Ted stands opposite a group of party guests who sit on

the couch. He holds a knife.

Guy #1 puts his hand down on the coffee table and Ted

starts doing the knife trick from "Aliens". He gets it

right for a few seconds, then stabs the guy right through

the hand. The guy screams in pain.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER

John stands with a pair of fake bear ears on his head,

doing an impression of Ted as a small group of partygoers

(Ted included) watches, laughing hysterically.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER

Ted sits on the couch drawing a pair of Garfield eyes on

a topless girl. Below the eyes he has drawn the muzzle

and the mouth, and above them the ears.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER

Ted stands by the TV, singing a karaoke version of "I

Only Want to be with You" by Hootie and the Blowfish.

INT. TED'S BEDROOM - LATER

Sam, John and Ted stand by the wall.

Sam punches the wall a couple times, and his fist goes

right through.

Immediately we see half an Asian face dart into frame

through the hole. He screams in Cantonese, then,

The neighbor sticks a knife through the hole. John, Ted,

and Sam scream. Sam and John jump around and scream as

they frantically try to get the knife.

Sam grabs the arm, and it darts back inside.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

There's an angry pounding on the door. One of the party

guests opens it, and the Asian guy runs in, screaming in

Cantonese. He holds a wooden spoon in one hand, and a

live duck in the other. John, Sam, and Ted run back out

into the living room. The Asian guy runs toward them,

screaming first in Cantonese, then:

SAM'S POV - We see the Asian man dressed as Ming the

Merciless.

Sam charges the Asian man, tackling him. They both

tumble over the back of the couch, nearly knocking it

over. The duck flies out of his arms, landing on the

floor. It immediately goes after Ted, who screams.

ANGLE ON SAM, who chokes the Asian man on the floor.

John struggles to pull him off.

ANGLE ON TED - who circles confrontationally with the

duck, as in an Irish bar fight. ANGLE BACK ON THE GUYS

FIGHTING - The Asian man jabs Sam in the eye with the

other end of the spoon, and Sam goes staggering backward,

falling into John. They land on the table, smashing it

in half. They fall to the floor on top of each other.

The duck charges at Ted and slaps him across the face a

few times with its wings.

The Asian man calls to the duck from the door.

The duck takes one last whack at Ted and waddles over to

the Asian man, fluttering up into his arms.

He exits, slamming the door.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - LATER

John sits on the couch as Guy enters, holding hands with

another man.

He and Jared walk off.

ANGLE ON JOHN, who sits on the couch, looking zoned out

and drained. Sam Jones approaches.

John looks at the clock. His eyes widen in panicked

realization.

John scrambles to his feet, and runs for the front door.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

John opens the door and runs down the hall. He runs

partway down the stairwell, and stops short as he sees

Lori at the bottom, coming partway up the stairs. They

stare at each other for a beat. She looks as hurt,

angry, and betrayed as a woman can be.

He throws up all over the floor.

EXT. TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Lori storms out into the street. After a beat, John runs

out after her.

She hastily pays the cabbie who waits outside. John

catches up to her and grabs her arm, but she shakes him

off. She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears.

He reluctantly hands her her keys. She turns and walks

toward her car.

She gets in the car and drives away with a screech.

Angle on Ted, who is walking out the door.

Ted pauses, realizing John is serious.

John turns and walks away.

Ted pushes his own stomach in. We hear his soundbox

squeak out the words "I wuv you." John does not turn

around. Ted looks after him, then slowly lowers his head

sadly. He sits down on the sidewalk, dazed and defeated.

MONTAGE: SET TO MUSIC - SONG TBD

EXT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT

John pulls up in his car, and sadly goes inside.

INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT

John sits on the bed and turns on the TV. He flips

through the channels, seeing various clips of shows.

Eventually, he shuts off the TV. He opens his wallet,

and takes out a picture of Lori. He looks at it sadly.

EXT. MINI GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

John and Lori play mini-golf. She putts, and the ball

stops just short of the hole. John walks up to it, and

"looks the other way" as he taps it in with his foot.

She smiles warmly at him.

EXT. BOSTON COMMON - SUNSET

John and Lori are on a swan boat ride, throwing bread to

the ducks. They're both leaning over the side with their

hands on the rail. His hand moves partway on top of

hers. They look at each other, and share a slow,

romantic kiss.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lori sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, her face

wet with tears. ANGLE ON the TV screen, where a Bridget

Jones film is playing. ANGLE BACK ON Lori, who is

looking at the screen, but is really looking inward...

EXT. BEACH - DUSK

ANGLE ON a partially full moon. PAN DOWN to John and

Lori, walking along the beach, holding hands. He kisses

her on the cheek, then looks down, noticing something

O.S. He leans down and picks up a dead horseshoe crab.

He dangles it in Lori's face. She freaks out, and runs

into the water. They both laugh.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ANGLE ON A BIRTHDAY CARD ON THE TABLE - We pull out to

reveal Lori sitting at the table, with a couple of

candles in front of her. John comes out of the kitchen

wearing an apron, and holding an entire turkey with a

candle in it. She smiles and puts her hands over her

mouth with delighted hilarity. He sets the turkey down,

and she gives him a big, laughing smile as she shakes her

head.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

SLOW PAN ACROSS TED'S APARTMENT - The party is now over.

Everyone has gone, and the place is a mess. ANGLE INTO

TED'S BEDROOM - He lies alone in his bed, flipping

through channels with his remote. He turns and stares at

a picture in a frame next to his bed. ANGLE ON THE

PICTURE It shows John and Ted as kids, standing in the

snow, smiling at the camera. They stand next to a

soapbox car that they have built and painted.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

8-year-old John and Ted are at the top of a hill with the

soapbox racer. Ted is in the racer, wearing a helmet.

John gives the racer a push, and Ted speeds off down the

hill. At the bottom, he smashes into a tree, shattering

the racer, and sending him flying out of it onto the

ground. A dog runs into frame, snatches Ted up, and runs

off with him. John sprints after the dog.

INT. JOHN'S HIGH-SCHOOL ROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE ON a TV Guide cover that reads, "Simpsons Reaches

5th season!" ANGLE ON 17 year-old John and Ted watching

TV, laughing hysterically.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

The marquee out front reads "Star Wars: The Phantom

Menace." We pan down a line of moviegoers, eventually

getting to 22 year-old John and Ted. John is dressed as

Darth Maul, and Ted is dressed as Yoda. They excitedly

wait in line.

EXT./ ESTAB. CHUCK E. CHEESE - DAY

INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE - SAME

John and Ted share a pizza. Ted has sauce all over his

mouth and fur. John hands him a napkin and he wipes it

off. Ted looks O.S., then excitedly gives John a "hang

on, check this out" gesture. He runs O.S. ANGLE ON the

stage, where the animal band play their instruments. Ted

is there among them, stiffly playing the banjo and

looking very animatronic. A couple little kids walk up

to watch. After a beat, Ted gets in their faces, scaring

the shit out of them. They run away, crying and

traumatized. ANGLE ON John, who laughs hysterically.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - DAY

John and Lori paint the walls of their then new

apartment. They start to playfully splatter paint on

each other. ANGLE ON Ted, who watches from the other

side of the room, where he leans against the wall. He

shakes his head in a "whatever" fashion, and walks toward

the door. When he turns, we see there is a white stripe

of paint going down his back.

EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - LATER

Ted exits the apartment, holding a pack of cigarettes and

a lighter. He pulls one cigarette out with his mouth and

goes to light it.

He then notices something out of the corner of his eye.

cigarette and the lighter. After a beat, a skunk

shuffles through frame after him.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ANGLE ON a TV Guide cover that reads, "Simpsons Reaches

20th season!" ANGLE ON present-day John and Ted watching

TV, expressionless and bored-looking.

INT./ ESTAB. LORI'S OFFICE - DAY

INT. REX'S OFFICE - SAME

Rex sits at his desk and stares out the window.

EXT./ ESTAB. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT

It's raining outside.

INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - SAME

John sulks on the bed, leafing through a Tintin comic

book. There's a knock at the door.

John ignores him. A few beats go by, then the window

slides open from the outside, and Ted tumbles in, landing

on the floor, soaked.

Ted shakes the water off himself like a dog. John

flinches back, trying not to get wet.

John glares at him.

Ted stares at him for a beat, then lunges at him,

wrapping his whole body around John's face and head, like

the facehuggers from "Aliens." John stumbles around the

room, trying to pry Ted off. Eventually, he stumbles

into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door,

shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face.

John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted

flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted

hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John

stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed,

reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible.

John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be

pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him.

Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and

the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat,

each one breathing heavily (Ted is now on the floor).

John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling

him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the

process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in

a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a

number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back

onto the bed. Ted taunts him.

John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted

dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the

headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about

with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again,

and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the

chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted

to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles

backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing

lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall,

and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out

of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord

catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from

John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and

cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down,

whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the

bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach,

clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He

jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the

clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor,

yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his

bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks

blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face,

and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.

The TV wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a

crash, right on his groin. John lies there, with the TV

on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily.

Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over

to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing

deteriorates into sobs.

John continues to sob. Ted climbs down off the table and

up onto the bed. He pushes the TV off John, then lies

down next to him. Ted starts to sob himself.

John hugs Ted, who hugs him back.

EXT. HATCH SHELL - NIGHT

A huge crowd has gathered for the Norah Jones concert.

They cheer as she sings "Come Away With Me," backed by a

large string section. ANGLE ON Rex and Lori, who cheer

in the audience along with everyone else. They seem to

be having a fantastic time.

Norah finishes the song.

The crowd cheers.

INT. BACKSTAGE - SHORTLY AFTER

ANGLE ON a dressing room sign which reads NORAH JONES.

We move inside the dressing room as Norah enters and

pours a drink.

She hugs him.

ANGLE ON the doorway, where John enters, a little

nervous.

EXT. HATCH SHELL - SHORTLY AFTER

The crowd is cheering. Norah is back out on stage at the

piano.

The crowd applauds dutifully as John walks out onstage.

ANGLE ON Lori and Rex. Lori reacts, shocked.

John takes center stage, and looks down at Lori.

The band begins playing. "All Time High". Inexplicably,

Norah is playing the saxophone with a pair of shades on.

ANGLE ON Lori and Rex. Rex is visibly derisive, but we

see that Lori is softening. It's working...

The crowd starts to take the cue.

ANGLE ON Ted in the wings.

ANGLE ON a crazed audience member, who rushes the stage,

racing toward John.

John flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at

the last second, so the base is sticking out

horizontally. The crazy guy runs right into it, bashing

himself in the face. He goes down, unconscious and

bleeding. Everyone gasps as the music stops.

A few concert personnel rush out to check the guy.

The crowd is now shouting angrily at John. But he is

only focused n one spot in the crowd. He sees that Lori

and Rex are gone. Almost oblivious to the rest of the

frenzy, he sighs, heartbroken. A couple of concert

security personnel haul him offstage.

EXT. HATCH SHELL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rex escorts Lori to his car.

She walks away.

As she disappears out of earshot, Rex closes his eyes and

releases a fart.

EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN & LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SAME

Lori gets out of the shower, and begins towelling off,

still reeling with disgust from her encounter with Rex.

After a few moments, there's a knock at the door. Lori

sighs with annoyance, and walks to the door, still in her

towel. She looks through the peephole, but there's no

one there. She opens the door cautiously, and looks out

into the hall. There's no one there.

She looks down with a start, and sees Ted standing there.

He's blocking his view with one hand.

There's a beat. She reluctantly considers.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Lori, now in a robe, sits down on the couch, facing Ted.

She rolls her eyes.

We can see Lori starting to soften a bit.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SHORTLY AFTER

Lori emerges from the bedroom, dressed, and heads for the

door. Ted is on the couch watching TV.

The door shuts and she's gone. Ted gets up and walks

into the kitchen. He opens the fridge.

He opens up a crisper drawer, and looks at a six-pack of

beer bottles.

He shakes his head as he opens the beer, and walks into

the other room. He settles down in a recliner, and

watches the game. After a moment, there's a knock at the

door. Ted sighs with annoyance, and gets up.

He walks to the door, and opens it up.

He freezes, and looks up. We reveal Donny, the creepy

man from earlier, with his son Robert.

Donny throws a sack over Ted, trapping him.

EXT./ ESTAB. CHARLEY'S - LATER DAY

Lori's car pulls up, and she gets out.

INT. CHARLEY'S - CONTINUOUS

Lori enters, and looks around. She spots John, who looks

up from a menu. He is surprised to see her. She sighs

and walks over to him.

A beat. John smiles slightly.

She does. There's a beat. A busboy brings them each a

water.

He takes out some money, and puts it on the table, paying

the check. He smiles at her and walks out. She sits

there for a beat.

EXT. DONNY'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

Donny's car pulls up. The house is a low-class, creepily

shabby-looking Boston home (think Buffalo Bill in

"Silence of the Lambs"). It's close to one end of the

base of a bridge.

INT. DONNY'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

Donny carries the sack inside, and unceremoniously dumps

Ted onto the floor. Ted looks around. It's just as

shitty on the inside as on the outside. On the walls,

there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings,

photo spreads, etc. Most are from press from Ted's media

heyday, but some are photographs of Ted and John out in

public that Donny clearly took himself.

INT. ROBERT'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ted is led into Robert's room. It's a fairly sparse room

with some toys strewn about. A wooden rocking horse with

a wig stands in the corner.

Robert sits down on the floor, smiling at him. Donny

stands in the doorway.

Ted flinches nervously. Donny moves back.

Donny shuts the door. Robert stares at Ted.

Ted scrambles for the window and tries to open it. It

doesn't budge. He takes a running leap at it, but just

bounces off like a plush toy, and lands on the floor.

Robert stands over him.

Robert grabs Ted with one hand, and gets a grip on one of

Ted's ears with the other hand. Robert pulls on the ear

as hard as he can, and rips the ear off. Ted screams as

loud as he can. Robert looks at him, holding the ear.

There's a beat. Robert stares blankly at him, then:

Robert sits down, covers his eyes and starts counting.

Ted grabs a chair and starts sliding it over toward the

door.

Ted reaches the door, climbs up onto the chair, and turns

the doorknob. He opens the door, and exits out into the

hallway. After a beat, he re-enters, grabs his severed

ear, and exits again.

INT. HALLWAY - LATE DAY

Ted nervously moves down the hallway toward the front

door. He has it in sight on the far end of the living

room, but when he gets closer to the living room doorway,

he sees that Donny is sitting in an armchair, watching

The Incredible Hulk (the old TV show). Ted darts back

into the hallway before he's seen, but in the process,

bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick

knacks on it. One of them, a small ceramic penguin,

falls over, making a sound. Donny turns and looks in the

direction of the hallway.

INT. ROBERT'S ROOM - LATE DAY

Robert's hands still cover his eyes.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY

Ted looks panicky, not knowing what to do. After a beat,

Donny leans forward as if he's about to get up.

Ted breathes a sigh of relief, and walks the other way

down the hall. He passes a door. He opens it, but it's

just a storage closet. He's about to shut it, but

notices a stapler amidst the odds and ends. He hastily

begins stapling his ear back on.

INT. DONNY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Donny's hears something, and turns to look. We think

he's about to get up, but he then settles back in.

ANGLE BACK ON TED, who puts on last staple in.

Satisfied, he exits the closet and continues down the

hall.

INT. DONNY'S KITCHEN - LATE DAY

Ted looks around, and spots a phone on the counter. He

jumps up, grabs the handset, and jumps back down. He

dials John's number.

EXT. BOSTON STREET - CONTINUOUS

John is walking back to the Midtown Hotel. After a beat,

Lori's car pulls up slowly alongside him. She leans

over.

He pauses, then gets into the car and sits down next to

her. She prepares to speak, but John's phone rings. He

shuts it off without looking at it.

INT. DONNY'S KITCHEN - LATE DAY/DUSK

Ted nervously holds the phone to his ear.

INT. LORI'S CAR - LATE DAY/DUSK

John's phone rings. He looks down at it, annoyed. It

reads "Unknown caller." He silences it.

John's phone rings again. Exasperated, he answers it.

INTERCUT BACK & FORTH BETWEEN TED AND JOHN:

Lori sighs, slightly annoyed.

Lori turns, slightly curious, but still annoyed.

Suddenly, a hand grabs the phone away from Ted. He gasps

and looks up. It's Donny, who slams the phone back down

in its cradle.

INT. LORI'S CAR - LATE DAY/DUSK

John scrambles for his wallet. He opens it, and pulls

out the address given to him earlier by Donny at the

Common. He looks at it, then points out the window.

EXT. BOSTON STREET - CONTINUOUS

Lori's car peels out and races off.

INT. DONNY'S KITCHEN - LATE DAY

Donny stands over Ted.

Ted runs through Donny's legs, and out into the hall. He

races for the living room and the exit, but Robert steps

in front of the door, blocking him.

Robert turns the deadbolt on the door, locking it. Ted

turns and bolts in the other direction back down the

hallway, but sees Donny heading for him. Ted ducks into

the dining room, as Donny lunges for him and misses.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATE DAY - CONTINUOUS

Donny pursues Ted around the table. Ted ducks under the

table, under the chairs, etc. trying to escape Donny (and

Robert, who has entered the room). Ted slips past them

and back out into the hall.

He races for the door, but the deadbolt is too high to

reach. He runs into the living room, and pushes open a

door.

INT. BASEMENT - LATE DAY - CONTINUOUS

Ted tumbles down the dark stairs into the basement, which

is lit only by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling.

He lands, gets his bearings, then freezes in shock, as he

sees that the basement is loaded with ripped and

mutilated teddy bears.

Donny and Robert move in to frame behind him.

Ted whirls around in shock, as we cut to:

INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

John looks around frantically, then spots something out

of the passenger's side window.

JOHN'S POV - They pass the alley, where we see Donny's

car heading out of the alleyway.

The car slows down, and John sees Donny's car make the

turn out onto the street. Ted is looking out the back.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Robert and Donny both hear this. Donny looks in his side-

view mirror, just in time to see Lori's car swing a U-

turn to pursue them. Donny speeds up, and races off up

the street. Lori's car speeds up in pursuit.

EXT. STREETS OF BOSTON - NIGHT

We do several quick cuts as the chase blasts its way

through the Boston streets, avoiding traffic and

pedestrians.

INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny's car races through the tunnel. Lori's car

pursues.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted continues to stare out the back. He then notices a

crowbar on the floor in the way back. He grabs it, and

takes a hard swing at the rear window. It does not

break. Robert sees this, and scrambles to undo his seat

belt.

INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Lori speeds up.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted takes another swing at the window. The glass does

not break. Robert undoes his seat belt, and scrambles

back. He grabs Ted, who drops the crowbar. He starts to

pull Ted back over into the back seat, but Ted manages to

wriggle free.

INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The chase continues.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted grabs the crowbar, and again takes a swing at the

window. This time, it shatters. He drops the crowbar,

and climbs up onto the edge of the window.

INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

They see Ted in the window.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted gets one leg and one arm up onto the edge of the

window, when suddenly he is whacked hard in the side of

the head, sending him tumbling onto the floor. We see

that Robert has struck him hard with the crowbar.

INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

They continue watch with held breath, as they keep up.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted shakes himself off, still a little dazed, and climbs

back up. Robert climbs into the way back and grabs one

of his legs.

Ted reaches down and grabs the crowbar with one arm, and

brandishes it threateningly at Robert.

Robert backs off in fear. Ted climbs out onto the rear

of the car, and positions himself to make the jump. He

tosses the crowbar away into the tunnel. John and Lori

speed up, getting closer to him, so he can make the jump.

INT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Lori's car moves closer to Donny's. There's a tense

moment with some back and forth cutting... and then Ted

makes the jump! He lands on the hood of Lori's car, and

slides across, grabbing the windshield wiper to avoid

falling off. He pulls himself back up. John and Lori

breathe energetic sighs of relief.

John and Lori laugh.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny sees what's happening in his side mirror. He puts

his foot on the brakes, and the car screeches as it

drastically reduces speed. John's car slams into Donny's

causing Ted to go flying back through open rear window of

Donny's car, past Robert (who is still in the way back)

and tumbling into the back seat.

Ted gets his bearings, and notices the sack that Donny

captured him in, lying on the floor. He looks up at

Donny for a beat, then grabs the sack.

ANGLE ON Donny driving. Suddenly, Ted jumps up from

behind, and throws the sack over Donny's head, bracing

himself against the back of the front seat. Donny yells

in anger, and pulls at Ted, trying to get him off.

INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny's car scrapes against the side of the tunnel,

sending sparks flying.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny grabs Ted and flings him off his face, onto the

floor on the passengers' side. Donny rips the sack off

his head, and reacts as he looks out the front window.

He's approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is

opposing traffic moving in the other direction.

EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding

clipping one of the cars. A moment later, John and Lori

come racing out of the tunnel. However, a truck drives

through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks.

She pounds on the steering wheel, frantically willing the

truck to get out of the way. Finally it does, and they

continue on into the city.

EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Donny's car races through the streets, pursued by John

and Lori, who are catching up again, but are still a ways

behind.

INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Ted is still on the floor on the passenger's seat side.

He looks around, and spots a "Club" underneath the seat.

He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted

grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing

at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap

Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few

of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted

away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then,

with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in

front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering

wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles

into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but

can't.

EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Donny's car swerves out of control, veering up the

street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it

impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop.

Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the

back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of

glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles

for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit.

TED'S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly.

That little rip has done something... He shakes it off,

and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles

out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase

Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door

slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and

disappears inside.

ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind

Donny's car. They hurry out, just in time to see Donny

and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the

sidewalk after them.

INT. UNDERGROUND AREA - CONTINUOUS

Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an

escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a

ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red

metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs

on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his

larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him

down a bit.

ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through

the garage door, and running inside. They look around

for a beat. ANGLE ON ROBERT, who turns and sees them

(Donny has already made it over the fence). ANGLE BACK

ON JOHN.

John and Lori turn just in time to see Robert charging at

them!

When Robert reaches John, John knocks him down with one

punch to the face. Robert collapses. Lori and John look

down at him.

John and Lori run up the ramp, leaving a stunned Robert

behind. When they reach the red fence, they look around,

but it's unclear which way Ted and Donny have gone. John

continues up the ramp (in the wrong direction) with Lori

just behind him.

INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS

Ted runs as fast as his stubby legs will carry him.

Donny is in pursuit, and getting closer. The chase moves

past a concession area, and up a few flights of stairs.

EXT. UPPER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS

Ted runs out onto the upper level, and stops. The camera

PIVOTS 180 DEGREES and ascends to reveal the expanse of

FENWAY PARK down below. A few lights are on, and one

lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt. Donny emerges from

the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it. Ted sprints

past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He

has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted

scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto

the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED'S POV, it's

a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't

quite reach. Donny glances down at the drop for a beat,

then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted.

Ted climbs farther up the tower.

INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS

John and Lori emerge and continue to look around

frantically. They run up the walkway.

EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Donny pursues Ted up the tower.

EXT. LOWER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS

John and Lori emerge into the lower seating section, and

run down the aisle, looking around with desperation.

John turns and sees the drama playing out on the distant

lighting tower.

He turns and runs back up the aisle, toward the

concession area.

EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Ted is starting to gain ground, but he slips, and falls

back down. He's about to pulls himself up again, when

Donny grabs one of his legs.

EXT. LOWER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS

John continues up the aisle as fast as he can move.

EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Ted struggles to pull himself from Donny's grasp, but he

can't. CLOSE UP ON TED'S SIDE - The small rip from

earlier begins to tear again. CLOSE UP ON TED'S FACE -

His eyes go wide, and for a moment, his face freezes with

fear. TED'S POV - His vision swims a bit more. He knows

this is not good...

EXT. CONCESSION AREA - CONTINUOUS

John reaches the top of the lower seating area, and

sprints past the concession bar, heading for the stairs.

EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

The struggle continues. As Ted tries to pull himself

free, the rip gets bigger. He reacts again, and again we

see his vision swimming even more.

EXT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

John runs up the stairwell.

EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

The struggle continues. Ted tries to pull himself up,

but he's visibly weakened and his hands are slipping.

EXT. - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

John continues up the stairwell.

EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Ted manages to pull free from Donny. He uses all his

depleted strength to pull himself farther up.

EXT. UPPER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS

John runs past the top of the stairwell, and sprints over

toward the lighting tower, just in time to see...

EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Donny makes one final reach for Ted. He grabs Ted by the

foot again, and pulls hard. With one great RRRIIIIIIP,

Ted tears into two pieces. As John watches in shock, Ted

falls through the air in SLO-MOTION, a shower of white

stuffing descending with him. Lori watches with a hand

over her mouth. The two halves of Ted land, along with

the scattered white stuffing. Donny, still hanging,

stares down at the fallen teddy bear. He starts pulling

himself back over the ledge.

We lead and follow John as he runs back down through the

stadium with desperate numbness. Lori climbs over the

edge of the seating area, and runs toward him as well.

ANGLE BACK ON DONNY, who pulls himself back over into the

upper seating area. He hears the sound of a cop siren,

and peers over the edge of the stadium. Seeing a cop car

pull up far below, he makes a break for it.

Down below, Ted's top half lies on the grass, looking

around in a daze, like a badly wounded soldier for whom

there is not much hope. John and Lori race to his side,

and kneel down.

Ted looks glassy-eyed for a beat. John starts to

frantically gather up the chunks of stuffing.

Lori starts helping him, desperately grabbing chunks of

the white cotton.

John leans back over Ted.

Ted closes his eyes... and dies. ANGLE DIRECTLY ABOVE

TED as we pull away, and it starts to rain...

EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The rain is pouring now. Lori's car pulls up. She and

John hurry out, John holding the remains of Ted. They

race inside.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

John and Lori burst in with the remains of Ted. They're

both drenched from the rain. Lori frantically searches

drawers for sewing materials. She finds a needle and

thread, and John puts Ted on the table. Lori starts to

sew him up as John watches intently.

She continues sewing, until she is all finished. They

wait. Ted still does not move. John and Lori lower

their heads.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

John sits on the couch, head in hands. Ted still lies on

the coffee table. Lori enters with a blanket, and drapes

it around him. She sits down next to him, bringing part

of the blanket around herself. She places a hand on his

shoulder.

She gently puts an arm around him. There is a

thunderclap outside. John does not react.

ANGLE ON TED (shortly after) as a white sofa blanket is

placed over him. John and Lori shut off the lights, and

exit...

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT

John is asleep, but we see that Lori is still lying

awake. She sighs restlessly, and gets up. She walks

over to the window, and looks out.

EXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME

ANGLE UPWARD - We see a cloudy sky, much like the one

from that night when John was a child. As before, there

is a small clear patch in the center. A shooting star

whizzes by through the opening.

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lori's eyes widen a bit in recognition. She stares at

the shooting star for a beat, then closes her eyes and

makes a wish...

EXT./ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - TIME LAPSE

INT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM - MORNING

John wakes up, looks around groggily, then remembers. He

gets out of bed, and walks toward the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

He pauses for a beat... and walks in. The blanket is

where it was left. John slowly removes it. Ted is still

motionless. John lowers his head sadly. Suddenly, Ted's

eyes snap open.

John stares at him, confused.

John grabs him and hugs him. Lori enters. She sees

what's happening, and a huge smile crosses her face.

John turns to Lori, and realizes...

She smiles at him.

John goes to her, and kisses her passionately.

John and Lori kiss as we pull away...

INT. CHURCH - DAY

We hear the Flash Gordon Wedding March as we ANGLE ON Sam

J. Jones standing in robes at the altar. Ted, in a tux,

stands in the best man's position. John stands on the

steps smiling and looking out as we cut to...

ANGLE ON Lori, walking down the aisle in a wedding dress,

smiling warmly. TIME CUT to shortly after, as Sam Jones

addresses the two of them, standing at the altar.

John and Lori kiss each other. They turn and wave to the

cheering crowd. Ted waves happily to John, who waves

back. John and Lori run down the aisle joyfully, passing

pews full of people from the movie: Lori's co-workers,

John's co-workers, (Guy sitting with HIS BOYFRIEND, Alix

and Tanya, etc.).

EXT. OLD BOSTON CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

John and Lori come running out of the church, as the

crowd throws rice at them. They run to a waiting limo

with a "Just Married" sign on the back. John gets in,

and Lori turns to throw the bouquet toward Gina,

Michelle, Tracy, and Tanya. Tanya catches it. She turns

and smiles at Alix. Then suddenly, Tami-Lynn bursts into

frame, punching Tanya in the jaw. Tanya goes down as

Tami-Lynn tackles her, and the crowd tries to pull her

off. ANGLE ON the limo as it pulls away...

Ted stands next to Sam J. Jones, watching with a smile as

his best friend heads off.

DOWNSHOT Ted and Sam Jones leap into the air at the same

time...

They freeze frame in mid-air, as the Flash Gordon theme

kicks in. Over the music:
