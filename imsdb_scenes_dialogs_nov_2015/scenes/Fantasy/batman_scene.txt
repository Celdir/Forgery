FADE IN:

The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.

The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows,

dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and

concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its

aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and

kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready

to burst.

Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic

anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned --

long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.

On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from

their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch

over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the

Gotham night.

One of them is moving.

The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of

big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness.

Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-

fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to

each other... with one conspicuous exception:

A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring

straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the

main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks

over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and

now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in

the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.

Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in

frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.

Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys

them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.

TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night

souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER.

The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.  JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks

him off down the street and glowers at DAD.

A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of

stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath

and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.

The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty,

acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm

uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'

MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then

move on -- pretending not to hear.

By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street.

Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.

They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE

in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand

brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.

DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick

wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across

the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's

already searching for DAD's wallet.

MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to

snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his

gun on JIMMY.

The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her

face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to

shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.

The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle,

slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.

Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down

on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.

A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the

cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct

CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.

NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the

roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight

tingle at the base of his spine...

As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the

opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away...

where, at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE is

dropping slowly, implacably, into frame...

BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of

BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS

DROP.

Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a

BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.

EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his

throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK

FIGURE advances, spreading  its arms. Or rather, its WINGS:

GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.

NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.

And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate,

menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval

yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness...

NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure

is knocked bodily to the roof.

Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He

whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --

-- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a

strange, pre-verbal squeal...

... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET,

NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.

Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters

out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of

the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches

for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to

the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.

EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face

drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes

out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --

-- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --

-- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a

brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken,

weightless puppet.

THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES

NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES

past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape...

A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches

forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming

now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming

figure of the BAT at his heels...

... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against

the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He

has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.

Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he

could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling

on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to

pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails...

THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with

supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.

When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is

standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at

arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.

The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:

NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.

He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where

BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own

stricken face.

NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves

him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually,

without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE

ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.

Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over...

finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.

NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow

globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:

An oversized CAMPAIGN POSTER fills one wall: "A NEW GOTHAM.

HARVEY DENT FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY". We TILT DOWN to find

the man himself, determined, dynamic HARVEY DENT,

addressing a crowd from behind his podium.

Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery.

They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled

out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're

going to

Tuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling

water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING --

the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has

laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up.

The engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE.

A woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves.

Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place

reeks of money.

In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured.

Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle

with extraordinary finesse.

In the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news,

with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech.

THE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice,

turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck

sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the

middle.

JACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to

Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost

feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his

appearance. He is also absolutely merciless.

He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA

HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides

over in her negligee and snuggles up.

ALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She

begins knotting it playfully about his neck.

JACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts

back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a

nearby vanity.

JACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands

in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted

hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble.

He smiles at himself before turning to the door.

The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham

Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of

activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.

EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic.

Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE

MEDIC.

At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX --

thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham

PATROLMAN.

KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and

saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.

At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-

fried NICK past the mouth of the alley.

KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade

disgusted looks.

KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts

in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him:

We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street.

He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling

across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the

dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.

ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction.

He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the

block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered

up alongside him.

ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it

quickly in his coat.

ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two.

JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his

topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the

material between his fingers.

ECKHARDT laughs in his face.

JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The

fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.

JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back

full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an

all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.

By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows.

ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.

JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in

ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT

to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the

stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement.

ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one

crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun.

Gotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and

fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals.

ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his

hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table.

JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful,

fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption

at the top reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?"  KNOX nods in

approval.

He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED

COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out:

Curiosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops

in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS.

The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a

WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap,

her face obscured by a big outrageous hat.

The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock

of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls

KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs.

He points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears

the monogram "V.V."  VICKI catches on, makes a face at him.

She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of

glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn

corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed.

She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long

fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then

points to the scar and adds, slyly:

KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI

may have a purpose in all this.

She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an

INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement.

She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no.

KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead,

nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair.

Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.

A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham.

This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power

perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City

rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm.

GRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS

-- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types

and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this

makeshift 'boardroom.'  The big boss waves a copy of the

Gotham

JACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's

right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle.

This suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the

crowd. GRISSOM is unamused.

JACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the

deck. His hand freezes in midair.

At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA

HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator.

She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS.

ALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side

door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM.

JACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the

fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace.

It's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre

HOLE through its face.

GRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers

behind a moment.

JACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the

big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY.

He reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway

nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles

coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver.

A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-

hour's drive from Gotham: old money, and how. Out front, a

team of red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.

A DEALER'S HAND pushes cards out of a shoe (the card kind,

not the Florsheim kind). It's casino night at Wayne Manor;

the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels,

blackjack tables, etc., and the various members of Gotham's

power elite are happily -- and legally -- throwing money

into Harvey Dent's campaign kitty.

DENT himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies,

telling jokes, calling in favors. VICKI's off in another

group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots

and envious, furtive glances from their wives. And, in a

corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands

ALEXANDER KNOX -- staring inquisitively up at the ceiling.

A butler, ALFRED, appears alongside KNOX with a trayful of

champagne glasses. He too looks up at the ceiling.

KNOX takes a drink and ALFRED moves on. A moment later,

VICKI detaches herself from her little circle of admirers

and hooks up with KNOX.

KNOX winces at the reminder. She smiles and takes his arm.

Gotham's Police Commissioner, a distinguished-looking gent

in his late fifties. He's at a craps table, blowing into

his fist. ONLOOKERS root him on as he lets the dice fly.

Snake eyes. Crapped out. GORDON passes the dice as KNOX and

VICKI wander up alongside him.

KNOX puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his

fingers -- like little bat ears. GORDON groans.

HARVEY DENT is working the room. He ambles up, claps a

friendly hand on GORDON's shoulder.

DENT exchanges a meaningful look with GORDON.

A NEON SIGN reads: "ACE CHEMICAL. FOR A MODERN TOMORROW."

From the SIGN we pan over to a METAL SLUICE GATE -- dumping

TONS of CHURNING TOXIC SLUDGE into Gotham's East River.

TIGHT ON the rear-view mirror. JACK NAPIER is meticulously

applying BLACK CAMOUFLAGE PAINT to his face. He could be

getting ready for a date.

The van is parked outside a chain-link fence which

surrounds the Ace Chemical complex.

The SECURITY GUARD in a glass booth at the entrance to the

parking lot. ONE OF JACK'S BOYS creeps up behind the booth

and takes the GUARD out.

He turns the key in the ignition, shifts into first.

KNOX and VICKI are taking an unauthorized tour of BRUCE's

house, wandering through rooms decorated in wildly

divergent motifs, eyeing an astounding collection of

artworks and antiques from every corner of the world.

KNOX goes goggle-eyed as they enter the LIBRARY.

One wall is lined to the ceiling with leather-bound

volumes. On the other walls hang EXOTIC WEAPONS. Halberds.

Maces. Blowguns. Bolas. Thugee ropes and samurai swords...

every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever

devised. KNOX lets out a low whistle.

Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes.

KNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face

of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered...

and

KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she

is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead:

BRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question.

He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial

instincts aroused, pipes up:

VICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance:

KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his

competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's

something formal, maybe even

could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's

almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation

of charm.

like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm

turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all:

Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind

them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns.

Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and

strides hurriedly out of the room.

VICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him.

And indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous

WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to

ceiling.

She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we

looking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS --

as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording

everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent,

state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

showing KNOX and VICKI in the library. CAMERA PULLS BACK to

reveal that the screen we're watching is only one in a

whole vast

center, we can see everything that's happening in the

house.

Now we ZERO IN on a single screen: GUESTS moving backward,

with exaggerated speed, as a videotape REWINDS.

At the panel, BRUCE WAYNE hits a button. And now we see

COMMISSIONER GORDON talking to a uniformed POLICEMAN.

And suddenly COMMISSIONER GORDON is grabbing for his coat.

The monitor goes black. BRUCE reaches up, loosens his tie.

UNMARKED POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot, headlights

off. ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing

out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.

The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.

SPARKS FLY. A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a

blowtorch on the office safe. Behind him, JACK'S HOODS are

at work on the filing cabinets.

The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal

door of the safe, giving JACK a good look at its contents:

JACK shakes his head. His boys are antsy, ready to mutiny.

By now it's depressingly obvious: they've been set up.

Then, as if they needed any proof -- a SIREN blares

outside.

ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE

BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED

COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM.

ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.

ECKHARDT tries to slink off. GORDON grabs him roughly.

JACK and his HOODS ducking out of the office. It's two

stories above the refinery floor, accessible by a network

of steel ladders and CATWALKS running between the walls.

Down below, a CORRUGATED METAL DOOR begins to rise.

One hood goes into a crouch and OPENS FIRE. Half of his

colleagues dive back into the office, looking for a rear

exit. The others take off across the CATWALKS.

standing in the doorway as his MEN rush into the building

and take their places behind heavy machinery. SHOTS RING

OUT as the HOODS scatter.

TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section

of the complex. They're almost at the end of the hall when

a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.

It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant

WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its

massive chest. BATMAN.

One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in

the opposite direction.

THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across

the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands

hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.

BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a

bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL

by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.

THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike,

taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts

his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.

He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS

spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,

reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.

HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.

down on the floor, racing along a wall, THROWING SWITCHES

-- anything to create a diversion. With every switch he

throws, ANOTHER GIGANTIC MACHINE roars to life. CENTRIFUGES

SPIN. HUGE POLYMER EXTRUDERS spit out thick strands of

plastic gunk. OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place

over giant basins.

JACK SEES a squad of COPS on his tail, moving from machine

to machine, keeping covered. He SHOOTS AND RUNS.

BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated

walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them

starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up.

BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED

HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS

HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk.

HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his

ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support.

A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He

HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a

miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES...

planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG.

staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.

HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind.

BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III

with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side.

He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once

through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF.

Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the

HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB

UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE

STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK

to the factory floor forty feet below!

JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall;

STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking

lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting

for JACK to make his move.

No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team

-- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind

a forklift and darts into the adjacent room.

JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the

metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out

onto the floor in streams. The streams run together...

begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE.

COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last

pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK.

AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet.

COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses

out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN

FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor.

JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The

cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine,

hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE

begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate

opens on the East River. It's the waste dump!

Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If

JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting

shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to

his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor.

JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he

does --

BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him!

His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in

diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The

plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT.

An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm

around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED

STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK...

In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind

the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT

COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.

BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to

himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he

strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the

back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks.

All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move.

HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he

waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range.

ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his

side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the

Commissioner

at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk.

He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a

supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling

black currents of the East River... and freedom.

He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38

AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor

of the catwalk mere yards away.

The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the

Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.

ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands

poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops

ECKHARDT cleanly.

The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a

NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at

the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE --

a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE.

The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor,

DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY.

AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above.

JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS.

BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.

A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized

pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.

But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins,

totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The

COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN

into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING

ALL THE WAY.

And suddenly, with JACK out of the picture, all attention

focusses on THE BATMAN. COPS reach for their guns, circle

warily around him. Cornered now, he backs off slowly, HANDS

ON HIS BELT.

THE BATMAN raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. Then

-- as the COPS advance -- he flicks TWO TINY CAPSULES onto

the factory floor.

A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild

pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily

dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN

from view.

A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling

cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead.

The COPS are firing wildly into the smoke. But it's too

late. At the end of a cord, THE BLACK MAJESTIC FIGURE OF

THE BATMAN whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an

avenging angel -- and DISAPPEARING into the shadowy

heights, safely out of range.

A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the

illuminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN past the

chemical sluice to a SECOND ACE... a card from JACK's lucky

deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing on the

oily surface of the foul, polluted river.

As deadly toxins gush forth, OTHER CARDS from the deck

swirl past: a nine. A deuce. A queen. And finally, a JOKER

-- SHOT CLEANLY THROUGH THE FACE.

A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we

Behind the newspaper, feet propped up on his desk, is a

jubilant KNOX. He's on the horn to COMMISSIONER GORDON.

CLICK. KNOX grins, lowers the paper, finds himself looking

up at the smiling face of VICKI VALE.

A SUPERANNUATED SOUTHERN BELLE toddles over. MIRANDA REITZ,

60, is the society editor of the

VICKI is about to break out into helpless giggles.

KNOX fumes. VICKI shakes her head and laughs. She takes

KNOX's face in her hands, plants a kiss on his forehead.

She exits. KNOX stands there looking poleaxed.

KNOX, totally flustered, sighs and sinks into his chair.

A CABIN CRUISER slices through the waves. In the distance,

closer to the shore, we see a throng of SAILBOATS.

BRUCE's forty-foot cabin cruiser, aptly christened "DIE

FLEIDERMAUS." BRUCE and VICKI are on the deck, in chairs,

soaking up sun, gazing off at the sailboats.

ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of

drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches

for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin

over braided telephone cables.

He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for

her to try a sip.

The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends.

VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.

For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his

familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically.

VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she

can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.

VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but

if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.

Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's

also rather touchingly, almost childishly,

she knows it, VICKI finds herself melting.

crowd-pleaser, "La Donna e Mobile."

WE PAN THE AUDIENCE, finding several mobile young DONNAS in

the crowd -- drop-dead beauties in slinky gowns. Although

most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA

#1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above

the orchestra seats. Her mouth twists in disgust.

She scans the crowd, finds her counterpart (DONNA #2) some

rows back, on the arm of a bald bigwig. DONNA #2 is wearing

a similar sour expression, staring up at the

DONNA #3 is even less discreet than her comrades. She has

BRUCE and VICKI. He whispers in her ear. She smiles and

whispers back.

A beat. He whispers again. This time she doesn't laugh. But

her lips part slightly. SCREEN GOES BLACK as the opera

glasses SNAP SHUT.

staring icily at the DUKE as he finishes up to a round of

TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE.

BRUCE and VICKI enter. He takes her coat, drops it on a

chair by the door. VICKI is giddy, all champagned up.

BRUCE embracing VICKI in the vastness of the darkened entry

hall, framed by long semicircular STAIRWAYS on opposite

walls. A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHTNING transports us to:

Broken windows, graffiti on the walls: a decrepit rathole

near the Gotham docks.

TIGHT ON a face swathed in bandages. The patient sits erect

in a wooden chair, surrounded by the grimy paraphernalia of

an unlicensed gangland doctor.

The DOCTOR, a nervous little ferret with the bedside manner

of a back-alley abortionist, steps up with a scissors.

He begins to snip away. As the bandages come off, we get:

The last strands of gauze peel away. The DOCTOR stands

there, looking at his handiwork. His mouth falls open. His

eyes bug out. He GAGS.

The DOCTOR just stands there staring AT CAMERA, stock-

still, apparently transfixed by the sight of JACK's face.

He clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand

mirror, and passes it out of frame to JACK. Two beats.

Then, the sound of GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to

the floor.

JACK begins to laugh. THE DOCTOR gets a little edgy.

JACK keeps on laughing.

The DOCTOR turns uneasily away, gestures apologetically at

his seedy equipment.

MORE LAUGHTER. The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with

one hand, whining now, not daring to look at JACK.

A DOOR SLAMS. JACK is gone. The grateful DOCTOR breathes a

sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating table.

From a point high above we see JACK emerging into the

alley, pulling on a hat, wrapping a muffler about his head.

We can't see his face. But we can't forget his LAUGH.

VICKI nestled peacefully under the covers. Beside her is

BRUCE: hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling.

It's almost as though BRUCE is not used to

night. He doesn't know what to do with himself.

He looks at VICKI. She's terribly lovely. But despite all

that, we can't shake the feeling that BRUCE... would really

rather be somewhere else.

LOUD MUSIC. KIDS in punk regalia stand outside a rock club

as JACK stalks past. The wind knocks his hat off.

JACK ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat. Then he

gazes up at the steel-and-glass facade of a SKYSCRAPER --

and strides deliberately across the street.

The spectacular Gotham skyline, seen through the plate-

glass window of GRISSOM's conference room. The doors to the

private elevator hiss open and JACK wanders in. He plops in

the big plush swivel chair behind GRISSOM's desk.

GRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room.

He's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his

impressive girth. He's using a smaller towel to dry his

hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up

figure at his desk.

JACK gestures him over to the empty chair. GRISSOM doesn't

move until he sees the GUN pointed at his belly.

GRISSOM surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.

GRISSOM is beginning to panic now. It's obvious that JACK

is utterly, hopelessly deranged.

And now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS

THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock

-- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory.

His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous

seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from

the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS,

PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.

THE CACKLE BUILDS INTO FURIOUS, HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.

GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the

desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city.

And with that JACK pulls the trigger. And fires. And fires

again until the CLIP IS EMPTY.

We TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper,

arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW

spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit.

The room is still dark. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from

this moment on, THE JOKER -- sits in GRISSOM's swivel

chair, staring out at the moon-drenched skyline.

He reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at

GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still

wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself.

The sun is just up, and VICKI finds herself alone in bed. A

SOFT, OFF-KEY BARITONE VOICE drifts out of the adjacent

bathroom: BRUCE in the shower, singing "Honeysuckle Rose."

She breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. Somehow

she's wound up wearing BRUCE's ribbed formal shirt.

BRUCE in his opulent deco shower stall, still SINGING to

himself. VICKI sneaks up behind him, opens the door. He

instantly STOPS SINGING -- as if he's been hit by a brick.

She smiles, teasing him. He doesn't respond. He acts as if

she's caught him doing something shameful --

BRUCE seems somehow unable to sing along. But be quickly

recovers his composure -- and forces a crooked, almost

childish smile.

He kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a

towel. His body is one big mass of BRUISES AND ABRASIONS.

KNOX, in a surly mood, examines the morning edition of the

there, under Miranda Reitz's byline, is a picture of VICKI.

It seems she and BRUCE are the talk of the town.

A COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER:

KNOX leans back in his chair. The file is labelled "BRUCE

WAYNE: 1982-1987."  KNOX opens it and begins to leaf

through old clippings from back issues of the

WAYNE FOUNDATION TO FUND LOW-COST HOUSING. MILLIONAIRE

HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR GOTHAM HANDICAPPED. HURRICANE

VICTIMS SAY 'THANK YOU' TO BRUCE WAYNE. KNOX's face sags in

dismay. Every article seems to be telling us just how swell

a rich philanthropist can be.

Then he notices something odd. In the whole fat file of

clippings,

partial exceptions.

One is a group shot, Bruce in the middle, waving at the

camera and blocking our view of his face. The other is an

ancient picture of a collegiate Bruce, stern-faced, hair

down to his collar. The caption reads "BRUCE WAYNE IN

1973" -- years out of date even when it ran in the paper.

A DOORMAN DOZES in the plush lobby of ALICIA HUNT's

apartment building on the East Side of Gotham. Through the

glass doors we see ALICIA outside in the chill wind,

peering inside, hesitant to enter.

As silently as possible she uses her key and steps in,

tiptoeing past the doorman, trying not to wake him. She's

almost made it when he SITS BOLT UPRIGHT, startling her.

ALICIA, mystified, lets herself in and turns to lock the

door. She's startled once more by a VOICE FROM BEHIND.

She pivots. Her eyes widen. She SHRIEKS.

Sitting cross-legged in an easy chair, a twisted grin on

his loathesome face, is THE JOKER. He's in a smoking jacket

and slippers, reading the paper, a dry martini at his side.

This grim parody of domesticity sends poor ALICIA into a

dead faint.

It looks for all the world like a corporate boardroom. At a

long table sit Gotham's most distinguished criminals:

GANGLORDS and RACKETS BOSSES from every corner of the city.

They stare suspiciously at the head of the table.

Now we see what they see: THE JOKER, dressed rather

flamboyantly in a big slouch hat. His FACE is layered with

flesh-toned makeup, and his HAIR's been rinsed black.

Unfortunately, he can't conceal his ghoulish SMILE.

CARMINE ROTELLI, an especially oily mobster, speaks up:

THE JOKER extends a hand. ROTELLI reaches out to shake it.

He doesn't see the JOY BUZZER concealed in the JOKER's

palm.

40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body. He drops back

into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out from his

sleeves and shirt collar.

The CRIMELORDS recoil in horror. Before they can make a

move, a squad of ARMED THUGS burst into the room.

The JOKER is a wee bit agitated. He removes the hat and

mops sweat from his brow, exposing a patch of CHALK-WHITE

FLESH -- to the great bewilderment of the ONLOOKERS.

The sickened CRIMINALS file out cautiously. That leaves THE

JOKER alone in the room with the charred corpse of ROTELLI.

THE JOKER sinks into a chair and -- as is his wont --

ADDRESSES THE STIFF:

A poker game. A CRIMELORD from the JOKER's board meeting

picks up his hand and fans out the cards. FIVE JOKERS.

He looks up, puzzled. The last thing he sees is a HIRED

KILLER bursting in through the door, GUN IN HAND.

A COSTUMED CLOWN with a wheeled cart, filling balloons from

a helium tank, passing them out to the kids. CRIMELORD #2

strolls past. The CLOWN offers him a balloon, which be

politely refuses.

THE CLOWN reaches into his cart for a RED METAL TANK. But,

as we quickly find out, it's

FLAMETHROWER.

A sunny, landscaped quad surrounded by corporate

skyscrapers: trees, grass, marble fountains, flags of many

nations. Amid the pedestrians we catch BRUCE and VICKI, all

smiles, cutting through the plaza on the way to lunch.

He stops in his tracks, takes her by the shoulders.

All this, of course, is delivered with devastating

sincerity. VICKI finds herself totally disarmed.

He stops and laughs. She smiles crookedly, takes his arm.

PHILLY RICORSO -- another CRIMELORD from the boardroom --

enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of PAID BODYGUARDS.

A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside them, feeling his way

along an imaginary wall. VICKI groans.

And indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging

on the center of the plaza.

RICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a

skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the

passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside.

A BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME

reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN.

SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers.

VICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's

HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain.

BRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT

with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION:

-    TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY

-    A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully

-    PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as

... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for

a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in

the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's

just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT.

He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN,

CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past.

practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible

anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified.

A BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER.

BODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards.

his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood

as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. It's

almost as if the bullets are striking

A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI

emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the

wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.

As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS --

with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks

up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so

desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.

He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's

eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows.

He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back.

He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened,

pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her

face is full of bewilderment and doubt.

CUT TO TWO-SHOT: the ANCHORWOMAN and COMMISSIONER GORDON.

A PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the

TV, placing us in the JOKER's boardroom. Behind the big

desk he SWIVELS INTO VIEW, phone in hand.

ALFRED on the phone, a feather duster in his hand.

ANGLE WIDENS. BRUCE is sitting mere feet away, obviously

distraught, locked in some sort of internal struggle.

A KNOCK at the door as VICKI hangs up. She goes to open it,

finds KNOX -- wearing a big, cheshire-cat smile.

A MICROFILM MACHINE. As VICKI looks on curiously, KNOX --

all eagerness now -- threads up a roll of film and begins

cranking through back-issue newspapers.

He steps back. VICKI stares down at the display screen. A

FRONT-PAGE BANNER HEADLINE reads:

Beneath it, a PHOTO: cops kneeling over corpses. Medics

with stretchers. And off to one side, a YOUNG BOY -- BRUCE

WAYNE -- his arms wrapped around the waist of a BEAT COP.

The BOY stares straight at the camera. His face is a mask

of UNFORGETTABLE AGONY. You can't take your eyes off it.

TIGHT ON THE BOY'S contorted face, staring out in shock and

disbelief, his features recognizable across all the years

-- permanently, indelibly traumatized.

A greasy spoon off the lobby of the

and VICKI in a booth.

VICKI wilts under the challenge. She holds her silence for

a second, then changes the subject.

VICKI snorts, rolls her eyes impatiently.

LOW ANGLE on the JOKER. He stands on a catwalk high above

the refinery floor, lord of all he surveys, overseeing

production like a demented middle manager.

A dank, windowless room in the bowels of Ace Chemical,

which the JOKER has converted into a makeshift lair. SAP-

LIKE GOO drips in puddles from exposed pipes overhead.

CAMERA DRIFTS across the JOKER's cluttered desk. Shipping

manifests. Ledgers. PSYCHOTIC DOODLES scrawled in crayon.

More significantly: an old CONTRACT dating back to the mid-

seventies. It's half-obscured by other papers, but the

initials 'CIA' are plainly visible.

Then: a BOUND REPORT with the title 'DDID NERVE GAS:

RESULTS OF PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION.' Across its title

page, a diagonal rubber stamp: 'DISCONTINUED January 1977.'

And finally: a sheaf of PHOTOS. Laboratory apes, chimps and

orangutans, all DEAD. Their LIPS are drawn back, exposing

ON ONE WALL: POSTER-SIZED BLOWUPS of the grinning apes.

ON THE OPPOSITE WALL: a large-scale photographic

reproduction of the Gotham City skyline, its bottom half

HIDDEN FROM VIEW by the JOKER's desk.

The PHONE RINGS. The JOKER -- who has been sitting on the

floor by the cityscape -- POPS INTO FRAME and picks it up.

The JOKER nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the

floor. Like a happy kindergartener, with paste pot and

scissors, he's CLIPPING PHOTOS from a magazine -- horrible

scenes of death, destruction, panic, mutilation.

One by one, he's PASTING these shots on the blowup of

Gotham city -- all along sidewalk level -- creating a

massive photomontage of ANARCHY IN THE STREETS.

We've seen these photos before. VICKI VALE took them... in

Corto Maltese.

In foreground, ROWS OF MAKEUP in startling profusion:

mascara, blusher, eyeliner, lipstick. HALF A DOZEN

BEAUTIFUL MODELS giggle into their makeup mirrors.

In the background VICKI wanders past with a stylish friend,

CLAIRE, who owns and operates the studio.

In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular Brit,

is shooting a swimsuit layout with two SUPERMODELS. They

all ad lib greetings to VICKI as TONY darts around

hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses.

As VICKI looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place

simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces.

Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is

unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is

terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm.

The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH

SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away.

The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering

convulsively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN,

LAB-APE GRINS. VICKI GASPS. CLAIRE SCREAMS. TONY SCREAMS.

The

DAVE McELROY. Behind them, BLOWUPS of the two dead

SUPERMODELS.

Behind DAVE, on the bluescreen: a HUGE STATUE, covered in

canvas -- not unlike New York's Statue of Liberty.

A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper into frame.

Off to the left, PATSY begins to LAUGH. DAVE FROWNS.

An offscreen CRASH. Suddenly DAVE is up out of his seat,

mouth agape in horror.

PATSY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS VIOLENTLY

RIGHT AND LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS

UNCONTROLLABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY.

TECHNICIANS rush the soundstage in an unrehearsed frenzy.

PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the

newsdesk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at

DAVE gestures frantically to the cameraman:

Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A

moment later, we're looking at:

Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS as

a BOUNCY TUNE -- "Put on a Happy Face" -- comes up

underneath.

THEME MUSIC CONTINUES as a grinning, deranged pitchman --

THE JOKER -- pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. The

shelves are filled with products bearing his TRADEMARK

HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music.

PANICKED TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has

been JAMMED. Every monitor shows THE JOKER'S COMMERCIAL.

TIGHT ON an anonymous MAN -- GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied

to his chair, squirming, struggling. On the table before

him is a package labelled "BRAND X." A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE

reads: "NOT AN ACTOR."

ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his

chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY.

THE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before

him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH

DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY.

He grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as

he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss.

Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react

to the JOKER's maniacal promo.

As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE:

-    A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses for

-    A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable

-    A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked,

ALFRED THE BUTLER in a crouch, glued to the tube.

HIS POV: THE JOKER in tight closeup. Offscreen, an INFANT

begins to squall. THE JOKER cocks an eyebrow.

He tosses a JOKER PRODUCT out of frame. Then -- leering --

he gives the camera a BIG JUICY WINK.

MUSIC UP. VIDEO SNOW fills the screen as the jammed

transmission end. ALFRED looks over his shoulder.

TRACK IN ON THE GRIM, DETERMINED FACE OF BRUCE WAYNE.

-    The Gotham

-    An ANCHORWOMAN on the evening news. Her complexion is

-    The makeover counter at Bloomingdale's. SECURITY

-    An ANCHORMAN with a BIG UGLY ZIT on his nose:

-    A LARGE DRUGSTORE. CASHIERS sit idly by the registers.

From across the street we see VICKI headed down the

sidewalk toward a museum. A GLOVED HAND reaches for a pay

phone.

A BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is

at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying

pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered

cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human.

In all the city, he's the only person still using

cosmetics.

A DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes:

As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of

ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are

unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is

COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK.

A Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something

Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open

atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along

the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You

walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings.

The upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern-

filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly

matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI

enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in

hand.

VICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A

WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper,

bearing a single word: URGENT.

As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is

a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.

Unsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find

a MINIATURE GAS MASK.

She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN

SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent.

TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART

LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.

VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth.

Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.

GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN

toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS

lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold.

The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open

and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his

street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT.

A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are

carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a

"CLOSED" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE

CANS OF BLACK PAINT.

The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with

an appreciative eye.

He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a

pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT

RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas.

He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons,

pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water

lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment.

Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING

BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed.

He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM."

VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as

hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark.

The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair.

VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes

the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.

He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches

for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry

Lewis-style, as he lights the candles.

She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of

VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the

Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities.

Artier B&W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions.

He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.

VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate

the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway.

VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary,

getting more frightened by the minute.

Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the

impulse. She

on film. She reaches for her camera bag.

Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened

restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse

job, he looks practically

looking at his real face!

He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very

carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then --

suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER:

He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly

nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes.

He obviously wants her to

got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he

POINTS at the WATER GLASS:

Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS

ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE.

His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked

Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to

wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE.

His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the

running makeup, he LEERS at her.

VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.

He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's

coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind

them... and a VOICE intrudes:

The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and

moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wearing

the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.

VICKI can't take her eyes off this strange figure drifting

eerily through the abandoned tea room.

ALICIA sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.

We're looking at ALICIA's profile as the mask comes off.

The side that's turned to

side we

VICKI lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE

FROZEN IN HORROR. She finds her CAMERA, holds it out like a

weapon as THE JOKER advances on her.

VICKI backs away, snapping the shutter on her camera. HE

BLINKS as the flash gun goes off repeatedly.

There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He holds

it up for VICKI's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.

The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID

spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.

She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from

the floor where the clear liquid hit.

He backs VICKI into a corner. And then -- abruptly --

A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS IN A HAIL OF GLASS! A CAPED SHADOW

DROPS TO THE FLOOR OF THE RESTAURANT! And THE JOKER is face

to face with...

THE BATMAN!

On his wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. Ha AIMS IT at the JOKER

like a weapon. Then PIVOTS SUDDENLY -- POINTS HIS ARM

THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE RESTAURANT --

-- AND FIRES A METAL SPIKE into the adobe wall of the RAMP

OUTSIDE!!

On the end of the spike is a CORD leading to BATMAN's belt.

In the wink of an eye he's GRABBED VICKI -- DRAGGED HER OUT

OF the tea room -- and PLUNGED OVER THE RAMP WALL, FOUR

STORIES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE ATRIUM FLOOR BELOW!!!

The JOKER races to the edge of the ramp.

His GOONS are stationed at various points along the ramp,

still defacing masterpieces. They pull their guns and OPEN

FIRE as BATMAN and VICKI plummet past.

He holds the gauntlet overhead, ROPE whistling through it.

As we watch, the gauntlet sprouts STEEL WINGS -- forming a

BULLETPROOF SHIELD over their heads!

TWO FEET ABOVE the marble floor, THE ROPE jerks them up

short -- like a bunjee cord. GUNS BLAZE as BATMAN and VICKI

drop safely to earth and MAKE FOR THE EXIT.

The doors are LOCKED. BATMAN spots the black "CLOSED" sign

on a metal stand. He HEAVES IT through the glass doors.

VICKI hustles through. He points her to a side alley.

VICKI rounds the corner just as BATMAN lobs a SMOKE PELLET

into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.

VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while there

are many cars parked along the side alley -- there is only

one BATMOBILE.

The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well,

indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the

passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning

array of electronic gadgetry.

As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the

dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny,

synthesized VOICE repeats the command:

The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the

cockpit alongside VICKI.

Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the

Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE

FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of

the alley at ninety miles an hour.

THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.

The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH

PLAYING CARDS."  Half his GOONS pile into the van behind

him, the other half into a second car nearby.

SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim.

roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC.

A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The

COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the

BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response.

TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out

from the front of the van.

THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE.

The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian

restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH,

BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the

streets, eager to join the chase.

COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an

intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN

makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path.

PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE

PAVEMENT.

They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION

TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and

inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION.

BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST.

And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on

collision with a lamppost.

He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE

JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.

ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a

crowd around them.

The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies:

With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into

place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the

BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL.

BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE,

vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble.

THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S

VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE.

The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately

down the street.

BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands,

dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS.

FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off

the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio:

BATMAN and VICKI race down the sidewalk. The car is gaining

on them; and then, from behind --

BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They

dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up.

They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY.

Hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the

mouth of the alley. VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still

alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her

arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width

of the alleyway five stories up.

He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the

CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue

of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD,

and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist.

The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches

on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL

on his utility belt -- jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR.

BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line.

One story; two stories; and then...

They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's

goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward

another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS.

stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.

In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own

waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a

chance to protest, he LETS GO.

VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the

way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.

VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the

line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row

of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per

limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam

two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet --

-- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull.

BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off

and circle around his prostrate form, still wary.

The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and

fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black

INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks.

They move closer. And stop.

GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the

body. He examines THE BATMAN'S TUNIC... and RIPS IT OPEN.

Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the

roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as

the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this

height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a

sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.

peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE

WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.

GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A

FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.

Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.

A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the

GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds

the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.

HIS EYES WINK OPEN.

momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP

SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds

it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and

then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a

TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman...

No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.

They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes

out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL

and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas

pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.

In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body

THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage

can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.

GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the

way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.

Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the

alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at

BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.

BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised

on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH

GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.

She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons

everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up,

grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet

her.

VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S

FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the

roll, then drops it down her blouse.

But BATMAN is likely to

her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the

alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.

It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI

clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous

glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.

Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out

how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.

VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.

BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The

telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.

THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.

He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His

voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy

from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to

him.

Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands

over a roll of film. The

shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.

No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her

closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand

delicately along the line of her cheek...

... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS

into BATMAN's arms.

Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in

his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at

the BATMOBILE two blocks down.

The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact.

But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL

OVER the fearsome machine.

BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON

CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the

Batmobile.

He's about to get

from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.

TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From

within they hear the tinny computerized voice:

The steel plates begin to retract.

The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit.

They TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO

LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.

COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there

stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances

toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes

dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.

PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.

SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless

BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting,

dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of

COP CARS in hot pursuit.

BATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and

approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms

and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING

HEADLIGHTS.

BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN

and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.

SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible

behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's

powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL

THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.

A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on

either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.

VICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side.

He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.

At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by

underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a

SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.

Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds

later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.

As they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S

FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind.

BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him.

No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and

SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL

LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.

Wide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE

GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.

One second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES

ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF

AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.

The Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL

-- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION --

winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.

We all know this place. Although we haven't had time to

acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant

penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of

blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully-

equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the

biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for.

BATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips

off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are

TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest.

VICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and

picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to

examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR.

THE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his

futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost

flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more

carefree, than some guys we could name...

... like Bruce Wayne.

VICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping

at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.

VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses

overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.

He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the

kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the

roll.

VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She

kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound.

She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair

of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is

She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request.

But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand.

He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out

the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.

She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four

shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but

there's no clean angle on his face.

VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.

He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her

with the inscription: "TO VICKI. LOVE, B."

Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is

trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto

roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind

him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS.

HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:

He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a

SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw

on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing.

Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the

BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his

utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE.

VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as

he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.

She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the

mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP.

FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after-

burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW

fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we

The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE:

liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless

cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays

underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters

emerge from the opening of a hit musical.

In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE,

his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son

BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep,

head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.

THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the

sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts

an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.

IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES

are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and

MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle

BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF

JOY. And then, without warning --

A HANDGUN enters frame.

The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps

protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet,

begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.

MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at

her throat.

The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But

MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.

The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.

The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The

pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward

the sidewalk.

A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.

THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek

we cannot hear --

-- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.

BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a

handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's

purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the

boy.

Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his

parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny

glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around

them.

He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the

GUNMAN turns and runs.

AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-

winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics

with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped

tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.

There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away

from us.

And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's

hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name,

LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in

GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.

But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns.

face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death...

and more importantly,

At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the

sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN

is smiling prettily at BRUCE.

The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.

A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding

white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING

SOUND cuts through the silence.

VICKI AWAKENS. She sits up in bed, tremulous, distraught.

The bedside phone is ringing. She reaches for it, but her

hand freezes in midair. She knows who's calling.

Three rings later, she manages to lift the receiver. To her

amazement, she finds she cannot speak. Finally, she hears a

VOICE at the other end of the line.

BRUCE at a big mahogany desk in his somber, book-lined

study. The room is dark but for a small table lamp.

Her voice trails off. She's profoundly shaken. She knows.

She returns the receiver to its cradle.

He hears the click. His lips part slightly. He hangs up and

sits there at the desk, staring straight ahead.

TOTAL DARKNESS. VICKI stands before the bathroom mirror.

She holds the OPENED ROLL OF TELEPHOTO SHOTS over the sink.

Then she strikes a match. IGNITES the film. Drops it into

the sink, and -- with hollow eyes -- WATCHES IT BURN.

It's four in the morning. VICKI, wrapped in a bathrobe,

still shaky, pours her fifth cup of coffee. Sitting across

from her is a rumpled and stubbly ALEXANDER KNOX.

KNOX slaps his forehead in frustration, sprawls back in his

chair.

The joke dies. VICKI stares dead ahead. KNOX looks on in

utter disbelief as it all comes into focus: he's lost her

loyalty. VICKI is in over her head with BRUCE.

KNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up

and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly:

CUSTOMERS are lining up to buy the early edition of the

In the midst of the hubbub a DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past,

dumping a bundle of AFTERNOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk.

"WAR OF THE FREAKS" has been relegated to the lower right-

hand corner of the page -- supplanted by more pressing

news:

BRUCE in a plush office suite downtown, on the phone to his

broker. Behind his desk is a big plate-glass window with a

fortieth-floor view of the financial district, so he can

wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down.

With exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver

to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again.

BRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a

squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the

hook.

BRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is

shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls.

The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY.

BRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the

door to a men's room, looks around cautiously, then enters.

A small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank

of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to

make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a

number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver:

At this very moment, a DAZED FINANCIER enters from behind.

BRUCE automatically claps a hand over the mouthpiece. His

face goes slack as he hangs up -- with VICKI'S TINNY VOICE

still squeaking on the other end of the line.

HARVEY DENT at a big desk, flanked by a number of

POLITICOS.

COMMISSIONER GORDON reaches into his vest pocket for a

cigar. He clips the end off, lights it, takes a long

drag... and STARES GLUMLY at the floor.

The MAYOR sits impatiently at a long table, flanked by JIM

GORDON, HARVEY DENT, and other prominent officials. The

room is packed with REPORTERS and TV NEWS CREWS.

REPORTERS cluster around a bank of four TV sets, each tuned

to a different station, all broadcasting from city Hall.

KNOX, who has recently taken up smoking, responds with a

grunt. SUDDEN HUBBUB from the ONLOOKERS as a wave of VIDEO

NOISE wipes half the screen away.

Split-screen. On one side is the MAYOR. On the other --

sitting in a director's chair with a big yellow HAPPY-FACE

BACKDROP behind him -- is the JOKER, grinning fiendishly.

The MAYOR fumbles for his prepared statement.

He shrugs. STARTLED REACTIONS from the city officials.

Panicked, the MAYOR and co. go into a quick huddle.

MORE VIDEO STATIC sweeps across the screen, pushing the

MAYOR clean out of frame. The JOKER leers at the camera.

"The Shadow of Your Smile" comes up UNDERNEATH as the

JOKER's transmission ends and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

FRANTIC ACTIVITY as REPORTERS rush to their telephones and

typewriters. KNOX strolls slowly back to his desk. He's

sitting on the biggest story of his career... and now, as

he realizes grimly, nobody knows or cares.

A tiny island in Gotham Harbor, homesite of LADY GOTHAM --

the huge, newly restored stone statue that welcomes

incoming ships. Her upper half is draped in a huge TARP

prior to the unveiling ceremony scheduled for this Sunday.

At the base of the statue, WORKMEN are assembling a big

wooden platform, complete with microphones, amplifiers and

spotlights. They raise a gigantic BANNER which reads:

"GOTHAM CITY -- 300TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION."

A TAXI pulls away from the wrought-iron gate at the

entrance to the estate. KNOX ambles up to a stone pillar,

glances up at a VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the gate, and

hits a BUZZER.

KNOX starts cockily off down the driveway -- then STOPS.

Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN.

KNOX, agitated, drums his fingers on the edge of a big

leather chair. BRUCE stands across from him.

BRUCE turns away, evading his gaze. KNOX fumbles in his

jacket for a cigarette.

KNOX is a bundle of nerves now. No longer cocky, he stubs

out his newly-lit cigarette -- and begins to PLEAD OPENLY.

BRUCE sinks into a chair, exhales sharply. He can't even

put up an argument. The two of them sit there, not looking

at each other, as ALFRED appears in the doorway.

The weekend-long BIRTHDAY GALA is getting underway, and

Gotham Park is mobbed with CELEBRANTS enjoying a FREE

CONCERT. Onstage: FIVE ELVIS IMITATORS, dressed in

everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits,

representing the King in progressive stages of

deterioration.

She's on the sofa beside a disconsolate BRUCE.

He sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the

same argument with himself a thousand times.

VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands

up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY:

VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.

A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting.

Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.

VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on

his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder.

She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door.

THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.

The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off,

tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." After a

moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick

up the mysterious package.

Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.

He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets

it down on the kitchen counter.

As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds

his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a

LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then

lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.

He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a

stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the

earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package.

He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then

SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.

Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is

full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into

the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR.

In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal.

BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the

counter.

VICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears.

The KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver.

Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over.

ALICIA, in her porcelain mask, on the phone.

Faces pressed together as they listen in. BRUCE covers the

mouthpiece with one hand.

As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE

rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTOP

COMPUTER. He plugs it in, flips open the screen, punches up

a telecommunications program.

A moment later VICKI enters from the kitchen.

MASSIVE COMPUTERS click and whir. At BRUCE's prodding,

INFORMATION comes up on the monitor: a number, a name --

ALICIA HUNT -- and an East Side address.

THE SAME INFORMATION scrolls across BRUCE's screen.

HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.

ELEVATOR DOORS open on THREE THUGS. One of them uses a key

to lock the car in place on VICKI's floor. The key is on

the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys.

The KEY RING belongs to a DOORMAN, who's riding in the

elevator with the JOKER's trio of thugs. He's dead, alas.

The THUGS dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall

and march toward VICKI's apartment.

BRUCE is nowhere in sight. VICKI is at the sink washing

dishes, acting nonchalant. She pretends not to hear the

DOOR unlocking behind her.

She turns -- and faces the THREE ADVANCING THUGS.

BRUCE steps into the doorway behind them. With a single

sweep of the arm, he flings THREE DRUG-TIPPED NINJA WHEELS

at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the

shoulder, one in the hip. They COLLAPSE in quick

succession.

VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his

element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom.

She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK

NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is

full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.

He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key

off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI.

He starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a

dumbfounded VICKI in his arms for a kiss.

THE JOKER'S VAN, bearing the Monarch Playing Card logo. TWO

ARMED GOONS lean against the hood. They watch as the

elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out.

BRUCE pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the

thugs, head down, whistling. As he walks around the van,

his hand brushes against it -- leaving a MAGNETIZED HOMING

DEVICE, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender.

He walks another six paces, then stops short. He feels

around in all his pockets, making a big show of having

The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the

elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that

something is amiss.

Frustrated, snarling, ready to throw a tantrum.

From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling

out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE.

He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL

LIGHT begins to flash.

BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the

BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's

BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.

The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual.

But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky,

staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.

Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow

belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the

intersection on a ROPE.

The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on

either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS:

As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist.

His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just

about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING

MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands

directly behind him on the horse's back.

BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only

The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through

the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.

ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below,

UNMARKED CARS are converging.

The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They

see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building.

BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones,

drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the

FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.

A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.

We can't see the driver. But we

beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the

city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect

sync with the one on BRUCE's belt.

BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING

TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its

hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --

-- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE,

neatly tied in string.

BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick

salute -- and the BUG is gone.

The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the

southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are

everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for

the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger.

The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view

mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD.

THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET

ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around

the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.

THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS,

RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first

opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO

GOTHAM PARK ITSELF.

BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on

the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from

overhead.

CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the

FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:

He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying

side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.

ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the

twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING

GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled

red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other

in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.

PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the

crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.

On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He

lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly

against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN --

driving it off the access road down into the brush, where

it nearly topples over sideways.

GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair,

landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're

swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make

the return leap back to his own trapeze.

In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen,

compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents,

he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's

got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase.

The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding

trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.

At the foot of a hill, the JOKER spies a truck. On its

side, in bright red letters, a WARNING: "DANGER -

FIREWORKS. FLAMMABLE LOAD."

The JOKER reaches into the back for a HIGHWAY FLARE.

Hovering over the chase scene, DICK catches sight of the

JOKER. He GASPS IN SHOCK as a LIT FLARE flies from the back

of the VAN... directly into the FIREWORKS TRUCK.

THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a

massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of

BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!

THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an

expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.

LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past.

One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON

falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER

plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.

MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and

weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.

THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a

wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER

veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously

close to the tall buildings along the avenue.

DICK GRAYSON at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a

canvas strap. He watches helplessly as his MOTHER swings

into a POWER LINE and drops three stories to the pavement.

His face is contorted with rage and pain. The PILOT

struggles desperately to right the copter, barely avoiding

a collision with the nearest building. And then -- before

THE PILOT can make a move to stop him -- DICK HAS JUMPED

OUT OF THE COPTER.

With astonishing physical grace, he DIVES. GRABS A

FLAGPOLE. Executes a perfect somersault. FLIPS onto a

nearby fire escape. VAULTS to the next fire escape down.

And LEAPS OUT OVER THE STREET --

-- MAKING A PERFECT TWO-POINT LANDING on his intended

target... THE ROOF OF THE JOKER'S VAN!!

THE JOKER hears a THUNK overhead. He casually lifts his gun

and BLOWS A HOLE THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

The blast just misses DICK. He sprawls flat, YANKS at the

chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van, and BREAKS OFF

A FOUR-FOOT SHAFT OF METAL.

ANOTHER SHOT through the roof. DICK rolls forward, hoists

his chrome spear over the windshield.

SPLINTERED GLASS flies everywhere as DICK RAMS THE SHAFT

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. THE DRIVER dodges left and LOSES

CONTROL OF THE WHEEL.

The VAN careens wildly toward an OVERPASS. DICK rises up

into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads

"DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE." He's about to get his head taken

off!

ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across

the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over

a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet,

ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm

around his waist.

THE JOKER steps casually out of the van. TWO GOONS with

MACHINE GUNS emerge behind him. PEDESTRIANS SCREAM as the

GOONS level their guns at the CROWD.

DICK is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. BATMAN has his

hands full restraining the kid.

BATMAN cocks his head in puzzlement as DISTANT SIRENS

BLARE. The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the

crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the

night.

DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM. BATMAN throws him to

the street with a flying tackle. The boy is hysterical.

BATMAN flinches at the sound of the words. He reaches into

his belt and -- mercifully -- breaks a KNOCKOUT CAPSULE

under DICK's nose.

A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment.

COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of

BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other

screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty.

We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION,

showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER

and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate

transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads

into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and,

as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE.

Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY.

Yet

flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE

CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO.

And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head

in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that

he would just as soon be dead.

DICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed,

unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt.

Breaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his

unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby.

BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast

tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on

here?

Beneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT

march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument.

Mexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back

a moment, then turns down the hall.

The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long

driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut.

A glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED

INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps,

then climbs out and towels himself off.

He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable

in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could

drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order.

An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray

bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and

tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's

costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway

behind him.

BRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are

filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling.

BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the

kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding

speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up

spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL.

DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a

A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with

a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of

motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's

chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.

ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up

curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle

royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom.

DICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air.

He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet.

Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE...

who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie.

A long, tense moment passes between them. Then:

No reply from BRUCE. Their gazes lock. And suddenly...

DICK and BRUCE look around. The puny, mustachioed butler

stands in the doorway, feet spread in a Dirty Harry stance,

a .44 MAGNUM trained on DICK.

ALFRED relaxes, musters his dignity, and turns to go.

CANNED APPLAUSE as THE JOKER marches out onto a makeshift

STAGE to give his QUARTERLY REPORT to the stockholders.

He waves a pointer at three SALES CHARTS on portable

easels.

MORE CANNED APPLAUSE. The JOKER takes a bow.

He pauses. GLARES OUT at the audience. NO RESPONSE.

THE CANNED APPLAUSE goes right off the meter.

Familiar faces all around -- the major players of the

Gotham underworld. But despite the enormous twisted grins,

no one here is laughing or applauding. No one here is

corpses.

One of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop.

VICKI lies in BRUCE's bed, under the covers, propped up on

the pillows. BRUCE is in his robe over by the window,

looking out at his estate.

He turns toward her. His face is ravaged with guilt. Now

she's

TIGHT ON a tiny electronic device: two cylindrical steel

casings bracketed together, topped by a DIGITAL TIMER.

BRUCE makes a few adjustments with a jeweler's screwdriver,

hits a trigger, and watches the TIMER tick off seconds. 30.

29. 28. At 25 seconds, BRUCE kills the

countdown and CLAMPS THE DEVICE into an empty packet on his

utility belt.

He stands up wearily. He's in his bat-suit, minus the cape

and cowl. Behind him, hanging back discreetly in the

shadows, is his loyal butler ALFRED.

BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks

on tremulously.

Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to

speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long

circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne

Manor. On the third step he pauses:

As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies

himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.

BRUCE draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. The current

time is 7:09 PM.

He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly,

and closes his eyes. He inhales, exhales, taking deep,

regular breaths. His muscles relax. Ten seconds later,

BRUCE has plunged into DEEP SLEEP.

Time passes. The clock shows 7:19, 7:32.

At 7:44 we TRACK IN on BRUCE's unconscious face, drawing

closer and closer until HIS EYELIDS FILL THE FRAME,

twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of

R.E.M. sleep. Without warning his EYES SNAP OPEN.

HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the

clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with

its grating electronic WHINE.

The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage

point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out

the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up

the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights

off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's

forces.

The JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge

shipment. At an open loading bay, we find a DISPATCHER with

a clipboard, directing MORE UNMARKED TRUCKS in the lot

outside.

The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR

and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and

taking half the chain-link fence with it.

In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the

BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A

ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the

factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole

in the door.

The BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and

SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are

everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and

PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

CRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass

dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and

COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER.

BULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It

doesn't matter. The car is empty.

TRACK IN on the computer console -- where a familiar tinny

voice calmly repeats its pre-programmed command:

A beat. Then: BLAM.

A CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing

to raid the plant. Inside each car: SPECIAL UNIT COPS

dressed in asbestos suits, gas masks in their laps.

All at once, a BRILLIANT RED GLARE suffuses the sky.

THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking

lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS.

For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then --

All that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble

and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky.

DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham

Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming

stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas,

ready to be unveiled.

THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of

Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-

talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the

Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as

the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's

just another part of the celebration.

At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a

microphone:

The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY

GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's

Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair

of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon:

hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the

canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face...

... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd.

Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE

SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS

ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic:

the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the

stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD

stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES.

And across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS

GOING DARK.

QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different

points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a

PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE:

INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S

HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY!

ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to

earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS

try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another

in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT

DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb

out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.

DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED

COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS,

DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled

subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.

On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a

field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless

against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.

FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats

and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of

an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies...

only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a

SHOTGUN BLAST.

In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild

street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional,

VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's

wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger.

In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS

are sweeping the sky.

Stationed all up and down Gotham's widest thoroughfare are

huge portable SEARCHLIGHTS -- mounted on trucks with

portable generators, unaffected by the power outage.

On the money-covered sidewalks, TOTAL BEDLAM. But on the

street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if

nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block

intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS

BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical

figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.

The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN --

smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We

TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT...

... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom

queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily

at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like

some demented parade marshal.

A desolate rural setting. UTTER SILENCE. Moonlight glints

on placid waters. We track in on a small sign bearing the

legend: "GOTHAM CITY RESERVOIR."

Far off in the distance, HEADLIGHTS ARE APPROACHING.

The THREE CARGO TRUCKS from Ace Chemical roll ominously

TOWARD THE RESERVOIR on their deadly mission. And then -- A

STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.

THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift,

sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS

EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to

release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.

The BRIDGE EXPLODES, blocking the trucks' path to the

reservoir. PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and

wonder what to do next.

They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a

sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they

HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE

TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and

destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.

in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the

wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham

skyline.

FRIGHTENED PEDESTRIANS race past OVERTURNED CARS. A PARADE

FLOAT, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to BURN.

Above it, a damaged BALLOON -- the cartoon character

UNDERDOG -- is losing helium, warping and buckling in on

itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. Down the

street, KNOX'S FORD ESCORT is coming up fast.

VICKI snapping photos out the window as UNDERDOG drifts

downward. FLAMES lick up at his belly -- and the cartoon

blimp EXPLODES.

THEN -- as they drive past -- A SECOND EXPLOSION. And all

at once the STREET IS FULL OF DEADLY GREENISH GAS!

The Ford Escort, windows up, swerves out of a THICK

SPREADING CLOUD of GREEN LAUGHING GAS -- threatening to

engulf the entire block!

VICKI stares back at the green cloud. Turns. And sees, up

the street, THE JOKER'S PROCESSION: BALLOONS BY THE DOZEN!

BATMAN, at the controls, gliding over the Gotham streets.

He looks down, sees a BILLOWING HAZE of DENSE GREEN FUMES.

At its periphery: LOOTERS reeling and staggering, falling

to the pavement, LAUGHING THEMSELVES TO DEATH.

VICKI staring through the windshield. Overhead, an AIRCRAFT

streaks past... an aircraft with SCALLOPED BLACK BAT WINGS.

They speed up the street toward the PARADE. SPOTLIGHTS

SHINE. Suddenly KNOX's eyes bug out. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES

and SKIDS TO A HALT.

Before VICKI can speak, KNOX has grabbed a tire iron from

the back of the car and RACED OUT ONTO THE STREET. He

flings the TIRE IRON through a glass STOREFRONT.

It's a COSTUME SHOP. In the window, MANNEQUINS dressed in

party costumes: Frankenstein. Ronald Reagan. And, that

current popular sensation... THE BATMAN.

As VICKI catches up with him, KNOX drags the Batman dummy

out of the store window. RIPS OFF ITS BLACK CAPE. And

DASHES MANIACALLY UP THE SIDEWALK.

Waving the cape, he VAULTS onto the back of a SPOTLIGHT

TRUCK. VICKI's face goes slack.

VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of

the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel

assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM...

...

BATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its

massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in

the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT.

BATMAN'S MOUTH drops open.

THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing

MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on

the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE

CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON.

He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints

bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed

inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is

BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face...

... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM!

The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE

TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring

through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to

the ground!

as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in

the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it

now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it

disperses harmlessly in the wind.

THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the

rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds

it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession;

hits a button repeatedly...

... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The

damned thing is

fit of pique.

A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back

for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of

twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street.

CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS

sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on

helplessly, in stunned disbelief.

As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON

THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL.

A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX

throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the

spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS.

The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the

Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps

off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of

rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction.

GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT.

KNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL

LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally

exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done.

He GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between

his lips -- and BURSTS.

His hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He

looks down in genuine bewilderment.

That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and

slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the

street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face.

In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.

THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue,

past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the

one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear

through a CONCEALED HATCH.

WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE

mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the

parade decorations. And one moment later...

A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!

BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a

burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank,

leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops

low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he

streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range.

THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR-

SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The

JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can

him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons.

The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips

through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and

BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.

THE BLAST all but knocks the BATWING out of the sky. BATMAN

stabilizes the plane, climbs for the clouds. When he's

clear of the buildings, he grits his teeth and rolls out.

The JOKER stares at a tiny BLIP on his radar screen.

The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full

speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either

side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The

REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO

FLAME!

The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the

tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps

the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF

THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of

the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.

And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as

the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE

OPEN!

BROKEN CONCRETE SLABS rain down on a SUBWAY CAR stalled in

the tunnel DIRECTLY BENEATH BROAD AVENUE. SUPPORT GIRDERS

groan and GIVE WAY as the STREET ITSELF COLLAPSES -- and

the front end of the TANK drops through, CRUSHING THE

SUBWAY TRAIN BENEATH IT!

The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A

hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and

pulls himself up to the street.

He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the

BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt

SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the

tunnel.

The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They

sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the

Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN...

inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.

A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for

their guns, move in warily...

The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of

motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and

green --

-- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only

one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a

red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.

BATMAN slumps at the controls. Beneath him, asphalt SHIFTS

and BUCKLES. The Batwing lurches to the right, drops a foot

or two into the tunnel. Metal braces collapse and the

plexiglass dome of the cockpit SHATTERS LIKE AN EGGSHELL.

TONGUES OF FIRE lick at his face. He's helpless, pinned in

place. He manages to look up -- and SEES, through a dream-

like haze, A HAND extended toward him:

And suddenly DICK is clambering down into the flaming

wreckage. He gets an arm around BATMAN's chest and with an

extraordinary effort HAULS HIM OUT OF THE BATWING.

They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in

agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath

him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.

DICK drags BATMAN to safety as the Batwing ERUPTS INTO

FLAME behind them.

DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.

THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is

unendurable. His body has finally failed him.

He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as

DICK races off with murder in his eyes.

A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky,

piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is

scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old

abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.

HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER

forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears,

hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.

Ancient and creepy. A huge pipe organ, shattered stained

glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all

forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. The JOKER wanders

about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons.

DICK enters silently behind him. He kneels behind a rear

pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS

at the JOKER. The JOKER dives, takes cover, and RETURNS

DICK'S FIRE. Then: silence.

In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, THE JOKER

finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden

stairway, leading to the belltower. He ducks inside and

starts up.

DICK'S GUN drops with a thud. His hand slips from the back

of the pew. In the second before he slumps to the floor,

unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a TINY BLACK NINJA

WHEEL, imbedded in the flesh of his leg.

Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED

BLACK GHOST begins his final unholy march down the center

aisle of the old cathedral.

A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the

wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed.

The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on

the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie:

A PILOT replies through his radio headset.

The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc.

BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls

himself up the steps one at a time.

Dried blood cakes his face, his chest.

Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps

against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his

utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule

back onto his dry, swollen tongue.

Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and

TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten

wood of the belltower stairs.

THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him.

And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN

MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step.

It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the

fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING,

vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell.

Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away.

His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN

INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS.

For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED

WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching,

trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last

ounce of strength.

The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile.

BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it.

He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility

belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making

earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at

his side.

THE BATMAN is out like a light.

The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering

what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves

cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches...

just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.

No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little

snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of

his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on

his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS

BATMAN up into the belltower.

He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life.

The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly --

pats his face.

THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak.

BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes

and reaches over to undo his cowl.

BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The

JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief,

moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face.

The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps

his hands together in sheer glee.

He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend.

A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his

helicopter approaching in the distance.

BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his

utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins.

The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens

it gingerly.

He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE

reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER

is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.

Then he hears ticking.

Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt.

0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds.

He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR.

BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch

convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.

BRUCE is wearing a great big Joker smile.

The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks

better of it and retracts his shaking hand.

He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the

clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his

signal beacon. 0:20 and counting.

The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on

the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down

the stairs in a frenzy.

counting.

Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and

makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly

overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly.

The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a

windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD

LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air.

The JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost

losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures

wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go.

A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves

-- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of

the old cathedral --

-- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING

like a black cloud,

blind uncomprehending fury --

The JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder,

cackles in mad triumph --

-- AND SUDDENLY THE BELLTOWER IS FULL OF BATS. A SCREECHING

SWARM, HIDEOUS, BLACK-WINGED -- SWOOPING THROUGH THE

ARCHWAYS

-- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER --

-- and plunges into the night.

he makes his choice now.

Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body

working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches

into position. Heaves it out into the darkness.

It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.

The CO-PILOT is hanging out one side of the copter, just

enough to see what's going on.

It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly

silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies

splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the

churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in

the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE

FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact.

Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars.

Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW.

Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks,

bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the

sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence.

It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost

childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually,

though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins

to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness

sets in.

AN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL.

VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT

in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine

it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping

flowers.

As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she

gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes.

The headstone reads: "ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987."

ALFRED, in his apron, on the phone.

The glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized

SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling.

In the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE.

Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping

him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder.

A hard question for VICKI to answer. She thinks it over for

several beats, then SMILES... SLOWLY, SADLY.

For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls

her over, takes her in a tight embrace.

DICK GRAYSON stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and

looks up at the GYMNAST'S RINGS suspended overhead. He sets

his jaw and then -- with only a moment's hesitation --

LEAPS INTO THE VOID.

His hands find the rings. He launches himself HIGH INTO THE

AIR and does a spectacular TRIPLE SOMERSAULT, catching the

rings on his way down.

Exhilarated, he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the

pit. 10-point-0. A SMILE OF PLEASURE comes to his lips.

A dark, moonless night. LIGHTS OF THE CITY sparkle in the

distance. CAMERA DRIFTS across the rooftop, settling

finally on the broad back of a BLACK-CAPED FIGURE poised at

the edge of the roof, gazing down on the streets below.

A SECOND FIGURE enters frame. We get a brief glimpse of his

RED-AND-GREEN SUIT in the seconds before our EYES TURN

SKYWARD... to the SEARING YELLOW SPOTLIGHT sweeping through

the clouds. In its center: the VAST BLACK SILHOUETTE of a

BAT, wings extended, DOMINATING the night sky.

We HOLD on the GLARING BAT-SIGNAL as BATMAN and ROBIN

vanish over the edge of the roof, plunging down toward new

adventures. MUSIC BUILDS and we
