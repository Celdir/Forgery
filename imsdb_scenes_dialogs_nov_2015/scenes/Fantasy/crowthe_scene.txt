FADE IN:

EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

BOOM!  A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a

perched crow large in the f.g.

TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE

As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.

ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI

TWO GRAVEDIGGERS.  Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic-

style church b.g.  Rolls of astro turf.  They look up toward

the sky.

He indicates the mound of fresh dirt.  Spits into the grave.

Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt.

LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES

As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the

wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in

sequence.

TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows

the arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers

as it begins to sprinkle rain.

ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION

A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-

offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She

totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson

Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with

day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may

unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She

stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.

She looks down o.s. at --

ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE

as Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent.

RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G.

as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave

near Shelly Webster's.

ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES

TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the

granite, darkening it.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

It blinks in its alien way.

WITH THE CROW

as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's

headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE

She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

The bird blinks at her from the headstone.

Another blink from El Birdo.

CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH

as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking

back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad

alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we

continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in

the middle of the city.

EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES

CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY

ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy

open-front fast foodery.

He grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he

cooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs

surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling

the dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look.

MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS

Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

Mickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-

factness.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)

Thunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again

and a chip of granite flies off, bang!

EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE

as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

A dot of blood on its ebony beak.

LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE

A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the

stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning

plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

RESUME THE CROW

as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD

It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER

A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time

we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a

long duster and a cowboy hat.

RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE

DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER

Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched

arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,

beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW

shaking off rain.  Watching intently.

CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND

Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's

knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE

The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white

parts the earth to grasp the rose.

SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own

headstone.

LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC

Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in

back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud

from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC

as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched

on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies

to the tree.

ANGLE -  ERIC

Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.

The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric

looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike

charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His

eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the

Skull Cowboy is gone.

LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW

Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.

ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC

alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches

off, following the crow.

EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:

A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT

A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball

devices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,

ashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed

with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her

darting eyes.

COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak

with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.

And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is

prepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of

arson cocktail to Skank.

INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver

canisters, an LED timer, wires.

He CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks

it up.  Looks through it for valuables.

INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

T-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

ANGLE - THE WOMAN

Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!

EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT

As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

TB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally

fast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in

the back seat.

SKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT

As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering

nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS

Reacting, with a mouthful.

Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.

HOLD ON MICKEY.  He points at Albrecht's hot dog.  Yecch.

EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT

The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a

war hoop from the guys inside.

ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT

Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing

car.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

ANGLE - THE WOMAN

hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape

stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as

she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN

Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature

of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and

fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he

must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and

accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE

The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices

hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the

blade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND WOMAN

An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

ANGLE - THE CROW

perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN

She fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back

into the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.

ANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING

Skidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY

BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police

units screech up to assist.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT

Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against

the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)

Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")

"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually

distinct and immediately identifiable.

ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES

Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

ANGLE - ERIC

looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.

Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield

from:

ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES

The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and

debris.

ANGLE - WITH ERIC

he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

ANGLE - THE CROW

landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat

boots in the trash.  Flames.

LOW ANGLE - ERIC

The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the

shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face

with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

PUSH IN ON ERIC

as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his

chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit

wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.

His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

ANGLE - THe CROW

Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent

communication is taking place.

ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET

bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the

crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto

his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.

SIRENS

INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG

music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band

rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup

trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now

the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this

establishment since we are --

TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10

Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.

Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is

Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people

CROSS FRAME.

GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.

His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly

down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style

- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards

supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian

killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in

just a minute.

They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved

fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that

clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully --

suspiciously -- to Nwa.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without

a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in

Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either

side.

INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window

(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible

through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV

monitors is hot with surveillance.

LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,

almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is

the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,

perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop

is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a

meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned

beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

NB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in

VIETNAMESE.

Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep

breath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at

the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but

is somehow errant

Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it

the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of

immeasurable worth.

Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even

Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his

sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do

anything untoward.

Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's

chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of

astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely

treacherous, he is extremely capable.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both

Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the

door OPENS.

ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES

Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods

affirmatively.

Lao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on

the jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT

Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.

Up.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

Blood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE

Eye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM

The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself,

leaving another scar.

ANGLE - ERIC

Vising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

Inscrutable.  No answer here.

RESUME ERIC

Almost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

A junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and

other people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter

GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He

is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE

of doorbells.  Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and

T-Bird on approach.

Skank riles

Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.

He lifts a small carton onto the counter.

NEW ANGLE - COUNTER

Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot

and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.

He hands though the bag rested from the woman.

Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands

over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT

Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from

the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him

on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.

And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the

falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet

still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and

runs out of the frame.

ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.

as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.

TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next

roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a

WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining

strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW

keeping airborne, keeping ahead.

MOVING ANGLE - ERIC

Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...

UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS

As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up

where there is no connecting building.

CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE

as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,

grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him

downward.

ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs

for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,

executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.

He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the

ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket

rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.

UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL

It's a looooooong way down.

ANGLE - ALLEYWAY

as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder

if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from

facedown to his back.

TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one

piece.

ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW

It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,

examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off.

CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.  It waits.

RESUME ERIC

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.

The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access

door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.

CLOSE-UP - THE CROW

It just blinks at him.

INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT

as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and

sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist

ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS

Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the

building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken.  The crow lights

on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.

ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC

A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...

which now sags, faded.

A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that

this is -- was -- a crime scene.  Eric slows, stops, his hand

on the banister.

ANGLE - THE CROW

as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first.

ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW

Eric has had enough.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER

sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn.

PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT

stiffening as he suffers his second --

FLASH:  IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked.  A rapidfire MONTAGE set

in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween).

The broken door.  The stairwell is filled with cops and cop

noise; lab guys bustle.  Albrecht is there, making notes as a

DETECTIVE steps over to him.

Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.

RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS.

He sits down hard, hurting from the flash.  His eyes seek the

crow.  He completes Albrecht's line:

EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT

LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the

entryway of the pit.  MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she

nears.

ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY

Luridly-lit.  A grown-up's place.  A burly BOUNCER appraises

her, his tone jokey.  He knows Elly.

The Bouncer jerks a thumb.  Go on in.

INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight

with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away.  Hammering

MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting.  Each predator straining to

be badder than the next.

TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach

DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her

obvious.

Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps

it into Elly's hand.

RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit

Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN.

INT. LOFT - NIGHT

As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped

from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape

whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of

disuse.

PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW

as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged.

NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN

He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor.

ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW

A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light.

ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT

He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND.

as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH.

FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he

saw:  Shelly, holding the cat.

UP ANGLE - ERIC

Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers

the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger...

FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred

points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time.

REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC

as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC

vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.

He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through

the masonry wall.

FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they

collapse on the bed.

ANGLE - ERIC

slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.

His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like

a drowning man.

ANGLE - GABRIEL

watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD.

INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.

Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down.

T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy.

Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and

T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank.

Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's

face, cocking.

Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed

right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face.

They all crack up laughing like ax murderers.  Skank drinks,

Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's.  Darla

delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

INT. LOFT - DOWN ANGLE (CROW POV) - ERIC ON FLOOR

He's awake.  Pushes himself up.

REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW

Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric.

ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR

He's awake.  Pushes himself up.  Realizes he is in the center of a

faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor.  He reaches to touch

the dark stain of old blood.

FLASH:  Shelly spills into frame, mouth bloodied.  T-Bird

instantly on top of her, rough.

ANGLE - WITH ERIC

as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where

he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

FLASH:  Eric held firm in the grasp of T-Bird and Funboy, one

arm each.  Five bloody bullet holes in Eric's chest.

The thugs 1-2-3 and hurl Eric backwards through the window,

which shatters.

ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW

Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward

the floor, in SLO-MO.  Overloaded.  Blacking out.

AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE

A jumble of good/bad images from the loft:  Tin-Tin embedding a

page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife...

Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne

cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric...

Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a

clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug

high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window

blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through...

ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL

He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME.  THUMP.  Out cold.

INT. PIT - RESUMING FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT

Funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs.

Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all.  Skank

nearly shoots it, jumpy.  Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather

trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.

ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.

INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT

An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME.  RACK to

show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open.  A flurry of

dark motion as the crow flies past frame.

ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak.  Eats

it.

ANGLE - ERIC

rising from the floor.  Careful.  Stealthy.  Watches his fireplace.

ANGLE ON FIREPLACE

Huge.  Marble.  COld.  Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and

Tragedy still hang there.  The Skull Cowboy steps out of the

dark and into the vague blue light.  Shadowy as ever.

The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin-

Tin's).  Eric's gaze follow it closely.

He points to the crow.

ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION")

Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow.

TIGHT ON ERIC

As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the

bird's eyes.  He rolls.

ON THE CROW

It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's

ROLL finishes him up nearby.

He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but

the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH.

FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife

stuck in his shoulder.

RESUME ERIC

vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain.

He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.

ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.

A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across

the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping.

ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY

as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as --

ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC

FLIES feet first out into space.

CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME

Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!

EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT

High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose

stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside-

down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the

building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC

Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he

relaxes, and swings back inside.

INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT

He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is

gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow".

ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT

He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this

time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer.

He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the

Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:

Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An

occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized

by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")

Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by

his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got

a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"

RAZZLES b.g.

EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops.

And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.

EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT

He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as

he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom

box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.

Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.

HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO

As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief

shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad.

Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.

Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.  Ratso goes

slack, deader'n hell.  Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF

the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.

TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN

galvanized by the surprise voice.  He automatically draw a

fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside

the coat.  Can't yet track the source of the voice.

ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY

He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.  Wearing a

long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.

ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)

trying to process what he sees.  And cover.  And buy time.

Tin-Tin blows out a breath.  No bluff.  Time to kill again.

He shrugs.  The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.

TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC

His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from

his nose.  It CLATTERS.  Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.

SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN

as Tin-TIn throws another knife.  Eric closing in.  He claps

hand together, immobilizing the next knife.  Opens his hands,

almost an "oops" gesture.  Keeps on coming.

ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN

As they meet.  Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.  Eric blocks it

and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.

They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.  Eric peels off

the Tragedy mask.

But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.

Fear.  Sweat.

For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

INT. LOFT - NIGHT

TIGHT ANGLE - TABLETOP

as Eric's hands place Ratso's boom box on the table and click on

suitable weird b.g. MUSIC.

ANGLE - FLOOR LEVEL

Eric's boots pass frame.  An open can of cat food CLANKS down

big in f.g.  as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's

trenchcoat.  Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.

INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

Shelly's vanity.  Dusty, disused.  The mirror spiderwebbed with

cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame.  Eric is

seated, his image crazily split into many.  He pulls on a long-

sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt.

WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle

stubs.  Placed all around.  Ceremonial and weird.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC

In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up

as he realizes he's in for another --

FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric

(O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open.

ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him.

But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick.

FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times

RESUME ERIC

wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a

hairbrush.

FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall,

trailing broken glass.

NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY

Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky.

FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4.

RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY

his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended

yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked,

triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face,

but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one.

The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow

perched on the edge of the mirror now.

He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave

white.

ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT

coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity.

Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and --

FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down

in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both

corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.

RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT

EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR

We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates

the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow

harlequin smile.

EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS

crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

CLOSE-UP - VANITY

Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off.

CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL

looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose.

Thunder rumbles long o.s.

ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE

The storm boils.  Eric framed in broken window.

CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

Eric all in black,  Firm-wrapped.  Tight-wired.  The trenchcoat

flutters, cloak-like.  His shadowy face framed by the upturned

collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

SIDE ANGLE - ERIC

as he moves forward in the light.  The crow lights on his shoulder.

FRONT VIEW - ERIC

Full crow regalia.  Face makeup streamlined.  Eric's eyes flash.

PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the

window, his voice a howl.

UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL

Coat, wing-like.  MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.

SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --

EXT. ALLEY - WHERE TIN-TIN GOT IT - NIGHT

Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.  Albrecht and

several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.  A

detective, TORRES tries to appear in charge.

ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN

Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of

him.  Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.

Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.  Torres waves the smoke away.

Albrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow

silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.

INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency.

Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast

from another time and place.

TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON

looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s.  Irritated.

As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum

and approaches the front door.

Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back

against the frosted glass of the front door.

And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the

door, gun up.  Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes

rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and

knocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.

Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to

disintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR

reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.

During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his

shoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open

cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS

No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage

above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head.

Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.

IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON

Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.

Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees

his own pierced hand, immobilized.

ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER

scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun.

Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND.

Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

TIGHTER ON ERIC

He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble

struggles and invective, o.s.

He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND

Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light --

FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

RESUMING ERIC

He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of

decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.

Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes

spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and

rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.

Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of

flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed

hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

LOW ANGLE - ERIC

Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.

SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then

Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him

entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire

a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches

for it.

ON GIDEON

As he summons some last minute budget bravery.

RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY

The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at

Gideon's position.

MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON

as he realizes what Eric means.  Hauls ass and bangs through the

rear door with a bleat of terror.

ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR

as he cuts loose with the shotgun.

EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

as seen from across the street.  Eric silhouetted, unmoving as

the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining

glass and debris.  Stirring his hair.  Eric is the black eye of

the fireball.

LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC

lit by flames and residual explosions.  He hurls the shotgun

into the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus

from his own clothes.

NEW ANGLE - ERIC

as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.

Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of

Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of

Gideon's.

Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of

submission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT

He gives it up.  Can't shoot.  This is too weird for him.

NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed

gun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

SIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.

Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

Eric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...

then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND

as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.

TIGHT ON ALBRECHT

and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs.

PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does

a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin

to bounce red and blue off his face.

EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH.

A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater

marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.

INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT

T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES

from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored,

the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what.

T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes

open for him.

INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT

T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse

Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the

movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it.

ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS

As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends

the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time.

ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS.

As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By

the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him.

INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting

table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug

paraphernalia, weapons.

Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that

admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired

silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by

Showtime's exterior neon.

This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid

casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge.

Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really?

EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE

Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an

abandoned car.

ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.

Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.

CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY

She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.

TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY

She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.

CLOSE-UP - ERIC

He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past

his crow makeup.

He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not

in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly.

WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY

He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he

may observe the Pit.

Eric looks behind himself.  Who, me?  Genuinely amused.  He

shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly.

INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

The music POUNDS and smoke is everywhere, like incense.

INTERCUTS of the clientele, retro, robotic, clove cigarettes and

rubber clothing; fetish casual wear.

ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR

right in the center of the noise, looking downscale and dirty

in this milieu.

ANGLE - ANOTHER CUSTOMER

Passing Top, appraising him, finding him as boring as life

itself.  Undertaker chic, she stares at Top.

An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.

INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

Lao watches club activity on his flybank of TVs.  When Top

Dollar shows up at the office door two Sentries try to bar his

passage.  He shoves through.

Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.

INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

ANNABELLA, a comfortable large, spider-in-the-web deskworker,

sits typing at a terminal.  Miked headphone in one ear, police

scanner chatter o.s.  She blows and pops a pink bubble of gum.

ANGLE - ANNABELLA AND ALBRECHT

Albrecht enters frame from across her countertop.

There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.

Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully.  Fatalistic sigh.

EXT. STREET NEAR THE PIT - ERIC AND ELLY - NIGHT

Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other

now.  A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and

curbs across the street from the Pit.

TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)

Elly is not happy about this.  B.G. we see Grange get out of the

car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the

white face talking to the little girl down on the block.

Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.

Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly

unexpected flash.

FLASH:  Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with

makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.

RESUME ERIC - AS THE DOLL DROPS FROM HIS HAND

Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges.

Eric snaps out of it.  Elly retrieves the doll.

Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.

INT. PIT - NIGHT - WITH GRANGE

As he circulates to the bar, unimpressed.  To the bouncer:

INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of an 8x10 of the loft slaughter in Albrecht's hands.

Subject: a document pinned to the wall with a knife.

ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT DESK.

flipping through the file. Smoking.

ANGLE - THE 8X10 IN ALBRECHT'S HAND

Subject: Eric, dead in the street in front of the loft

building.  The blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face.

As Albrecht's hand moves the photo we can see in the file

several band shots of Eric as a member of Diabolique...

including the shot on Lao's wall gallery of past performers at

Club Trash.

A DOUGHUT on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle

of all this research, startling Albrecht.

ANGLE - ANNABELLA BEHIND HIM

Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light.

CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin.

It reads:  We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court

Apartments...

Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.

With a felt-tip pen he superimposes the crow smile, like the make-

up, like the blood.

UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.

PUSH IN on the doctored photo.  It's Eric.  It's the Crow.

PUSH IN on ALbrecht.

INT. THE PIT (REAR) - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

Climbing.  The crow perched on his shoulder.  Not in a hurry.

TIGHT CLOSE-UP - ERIC

Impish.  Clown killer.

INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

Grange at a table.  SMoking and waiting.  No beer.  His back

protected, he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a

good overview of the room.

INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of a base pipe being lit and hit hard.

EXT. THE PIT (REAR) - FIRE ESCAPE - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT

Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.

INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

A hypodermic needle rises into frame.  A nicotined fingernail

flicks bubbles in the syringe.  FOLLOW needle down and BROADEN

ANGLE: Funboy taps up a vein in Darla's arm and shoots her up.

Both are naked in a shabby bed.  Bare lightbulb above.

CLOSE-UP - THE NEEDLE

As the plunger depresses.

ANGLE - ON THE WINDOW

As the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,

scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends.  Funboy pulls a

giant auto pistol; mock aims, calms down, doesn't fire.

She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.

Funboy giggles.  Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the

sheets at his side.

NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY

Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the

bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle

flies and lands at Eric's feet.  Empty.  Funboy struggles to

maintain against his high.

Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers.  Suddenly he seems

totally focused.

Eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet

punctures.  This gives Funboy pause.

Funboy tilts the gun off target.  Grins as Eric flat handedly

past his chest, indicating where to shoot.

In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.

Then his expression drags a little bit.

ANGLE - ERIC

Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest.

ANGLE - DARLA

who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor

around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands.

Eric twists her arm.

CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM.

where we may clearly see the needle tracks.

UP ANGLE - ERIC

He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see

the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's,

Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor.

Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps.

ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING

Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.

Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem

to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to

Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the

gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on

top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric

relentlessly.

ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM

as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by

his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing.

Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he

looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the

crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a

hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of

morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already

inserted.

And he fills the syringe all the way.

ANGLE ON FUNBOY

as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing

terror.

And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home

the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in

the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens

his eyes.

The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE

streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC

The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is

a little shake of his skull-head.

Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really

confused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

She's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in

Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without

a glance back at Funboy.

Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,

stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with

Funboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric

takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

As a hastily dressed Darla BANGS out through the fire stair door

behind Grange and FLEES the Pit.

Bartender indicates UP with his thumb.  Grange moves to the fire

stairs door.

INT. FUNBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Grange has seen the door ajar and now ENTERS gun-first.  Freezes

when he sees:

GRANGE POV - FUNBOY

Half-sheeted, bloody, a hypo hanging out of his heart.

RESUME GRANGE

Eyes darting, drawn to --

GRANGE'S POV - THE WALL NEAR FUNBOY

A crow silhouette spray-painted with a syringe of Funboy's

blood.  A thin outline, drippy.

RESUME GRANGE

whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on --

ANGLE - GRANGE SEES THE WINDOW

The crow is no longer in the room.  Eric is perched on the sill,

guitar and all, looking right at Grange as if waiting from him.

He winks, holds a finger to his lips -- sshh --and jumps out

into the night.

ANOTHER ANGLE - GRANGE

He almost fires, but doesn't.  We see instead the priceless

expression on his face as we --

INT. PRECINCT FOYER - NIGHT

Albrecht lights another smoke, quitting for the night.  Waves to

the late-working Annabella en route.

EXT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NIGHT

Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,

cat silent, matching pace.

NB:  Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a

shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.

Albrecht startles; drops his file.  Nearly draws his gun.

Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.  Eric waits.

He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.

Albrecht gathers up the file.  Eric stands there.  We realize he

is hesitant about touching the file.

As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.

ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET

They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look.

Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.

Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with

his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.

TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL

We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the

Flash.

NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT

And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own

head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror.

Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.

Eric lowers his head, penitent.

TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC

Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single

contemplative puff from it.

Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.

As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and

simultaneously ducks out of frame.

ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS

to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric.

He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again.

MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF

Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves

away from Albrecht's position.

INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him,

as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and

is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to

him.

Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's

tale.

Lao's expression is one of sublime content.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION")

A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the

store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the

store side.

ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL

They stop walking.  Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross

themselves.  Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.  T-Bird indicates the

liquor store.

Skank hustles toward the store.  T-Bird crosses to the car.

ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS

WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.  Behind him, two

12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,

one wearing a long duster.

INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

as the KIDS enter and split between the counter and magazine

rack.  East Indian CLERK.  Two boys fight video game wars in the

corner.  Skank browses, grabbing odds and ends.

EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - LOWER ANGLE - NIGHT

as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack,

snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:

INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR

Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.

ANGLE - T-BIRD

He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling

one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.

INSERTS:  Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder

holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.

TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS

on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.  As ordered.

INT. LIQUOR STORE - ON SKANK AT COUNTER - NIGHT

He looks outside and sees Eric as the car fires up, pipes and

glasspacks grumbling.  Skank moves, BRISTLING.

And the car peels out maniacally!  Skank tries to pursue -- but

the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.

Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a

gigantic Auto Mag.

Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.--

INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELING FAST - NIGHT

Vertiginous windshield POV of onrushing street, highspeed.

ANGLE - ERIC AND T-BIRD

Eric now holds T-Bird's own gun on him.  Eyes locked on T-Bird.

T-Bird's jump between Eric's nightmare visage and the roadway.

Clearly T-Bird would relish bisecting Eric with a meat cleaver

as he says this.  He's nervous and needs to hold the road.

EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT

as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking

wake of litter.  PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

Parked in an alley, facing the street.  Two cops work on large

styro cups of steaming coffee.  MJ (driver) and SPEEG.

Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.

They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.

INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

Eric lends the chase car a backward look.

Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face.

Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips

for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to

T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's

tape.  What Eric needs.

ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR

as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit,

T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win.

EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT

A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the

city.

INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT

SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the

pedal.  Mummified into his seat.  Hands taped to the wheel.

Throat taped hard against the headrest.

The car is now in gear, idling.

ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

He drops an incendiary right into T-Bird's lap.  T-Bird squirms.

No go.  Eric reaches in with a bungie cord.

T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized.  Can't even budge the

wheel.

Eric activates the timer.  Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.

INSERT: T-BIRD FOOTWELL

The bungie cord pulls T-Bird's foot all the way down on the

pedal.

ANGLE - ON CAR, FROM DOCKSIDE

Eric steps back, plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move.  The

car roars for the edge of the dock, about a distance of a

football field.  Eric examines T-bird's auto pistol and pops the

clip.

INTERCUTS:  as the car speeds for the water's edge, Eric thumbs

bullets from the clip, one by one.

Sinks.  Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.

ANGLE - ERIC

heaving the gun into the distant water.  Plosh.  He produces T-

Bird's accelerator.  Squirts it into the ground.  He

prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.  He

flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.

HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC

EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.  More soft GUITAR strokes as

CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged

ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up

streaked by the night's work.  His fingering is unsure and he

tries the tune again.

INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong

around Eric's neck.  Like an amulet.

ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING

He's got it right this time.  Strong, sure CHORDS.  Passionate.

We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.

He holds a stroke, letting it ring.  Sun rises behind him.

Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.  Funny.

EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY

Later.  Elly is seated on a stool..  Mickey gives her a chili

dog.

Mickey EXITS FRAME.

Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car

is parked across the street, b.g.

Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.

Elly sizes Grange up.

Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across

the countertop to Mickey.

INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY

No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode.

He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity

in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard

against the bedroom doorframe.

FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window

wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is

embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties

that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples

down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the

floor...

LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC

hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing

as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.

extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight.

ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM

executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill.

He grasps it with both hands.

FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each

moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours.

But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes.

ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW

His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping

them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like

Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before

him on the sill.

He wipes his torso down with a towel.

He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can

HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful

fist.

INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has

a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.

WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1

and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and

rinses his nostrils with brandy.

Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao.  He rises and goes

to the window.  Neon glow.  Top sees something outside, below,

that really torques him off.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)

A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the

INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

Top whip-drawing an auto pistol and shooting below.

His gun smoking.  Momentary empowerment.

EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

As Top turns from the window,  PULL BACK to incorporate the

chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.  Eric is there,

perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it

until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.

INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his

time being frittered.

He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent.  Top

looks sheepish.

Top rallies to this.

Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's

guarantee.

CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND

from the ledge.  Endstamp is for a .45 caliber.

He sniffs the cartridge.  We can see Funboy's cartridge in his

hair.  He fists the shell casing tightly.

ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK

Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.

It wasn't anything.  Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on

his gun.  Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.

Death cleans house.  Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward

and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel

door as it being opened by the Sentry outside.  Crash!  The

door is shut again.

ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO

Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao

beneath the table for cover.

Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him.  Skank hits

the deck again.  Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits

across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing

the lights.

Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething.

Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.

And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier,

slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose.

FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft,

trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.

Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory)

Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing

Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof.

Lead SWAT hesitates -- because of what he sees.

He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.

As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in

from behind and above the row of buildings.

INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control.

He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit.

Gradually he calms down.

Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.

Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out

of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff.

He pitches the smoke out the open car window.

Eric turns back to Albrecht.

Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

It hangs a turn and their escape is made.

Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted.

one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven

FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk.  Lao has the 8x10 from

work on the desk BELOW FRAME;  we can't see it yet, among other

scattered research and inconcubula.

Entering and crossing to the desk.  As he comes up to the desk,

he DRAWS BACK.

NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE

Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in

his hands.  The killing blade is nearby.

Grange makes a face.  Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.

Lao chuckles indulgently.

ZZLIP!  Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against

the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body.

He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes

like a dark pimento.

LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT.

Off Grange's stunned expression.

Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.

Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it.  Pleased.

Lao SHRUGS.  Grange can handle it.

Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand.

INT. LOFT - DAY

Eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood

but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack.  Staring

fixedly into the fireplace,  where he burns everything he could

find of his past:  the junk from the makeup table, the masques,

photos of himself and Shelly.

INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY

Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS

cautiously inside.

RESUME ERIC

Without looking toward the door, he speaks.

And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier.

Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject:

Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera.

He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath.

Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see

Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently.

CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE

The photo burns and blackens in the grate.

He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.

He taps Elly's temple, then his won.

Elly gives Eric a hug.

He quizzical expression amuses him.

Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them.

Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy.

The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in

her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"

ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC

While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last

bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and

creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat,

then turns to Elly.

BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's

inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g.

Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS.

Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.  Eric plays

before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and

heartbreaking.  Definitive.  Pain replaced by strength and a

sense of homecoming.

As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At

the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it

down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.  He's finished here.

TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with

the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there.

Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs

back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP.

TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward

before he can fire.

INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard

changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides.  Sits up with his

gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword.

ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW  firing now with a gun in each hand.

RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire,

but not before he puts a round through Eric.

Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet.

RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol.  His machine

gun jams, he fights to get the clip.

ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht

dead-bang in the open by the window.

MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC --  A complex leap with the sword

flashing.  He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up.

CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S.

TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of

something AIRBORNE toward him.

CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s

HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating

strike.

ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the

background.  Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword.

WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn

apart by gunfire.  Hazy smoke.  Two dead guys.  And Eric.

Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's

sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who

pursues Eric to:

INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT

The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void.  Eric grabs the thick

bellrope, testing it.  A final look to Albrecht.

Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.

ON ALBRECHT

Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast..  Grumbles.

He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the

steps.

ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of

speed climb.  Zip!  All the way to the top.

EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT

Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark.  Lightning deep in the turbid

clouds.  The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.

DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large,

Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell

tower.

SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it.  Elly

flinches at the strike.

INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT

He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.

EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT

Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing  lightning

rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the

roof, his blade brandished.

CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but

weaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED

and RUNNING along the precarious peak.

Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD

FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the

roof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.

The steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick

that DUMPS Lao.

Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao

similarly saves himself.

NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward

the peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning

rod and tries to wrest it loose.

SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still

blue-hot.

MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao

closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as -

Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.

The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her

handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

ANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the

lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off

the roof.

With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs

on to Eric.

UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising

the sword.

Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.

When he looks up, Lao is gone.

ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks

around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's

gun quickly.

ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,

trailing sparks, snuffing out.

ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the

night above him.

ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.

ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS

The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

RESUME ERIC

Rage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as

hell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.

Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.

As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")

SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

ANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP

As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.

Pecking out Lao's eyes.

WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his

climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS

down the roof - toward Eric.

SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,

fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the

eyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's

back!

ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his

sternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM

TIGHT.

MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and

INTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,

the killing blade still embedded in him!

WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's

position.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the

blade in his own chest.

CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the

roof edge.

ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly

is in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own

shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying

to get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled,

limping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal

the flowers there.

Eric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

Eric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give

her hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds

it up to her.

Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss

her on the forehead.

MOVE WITH ERIC

Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never

going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One

groping hand tries to drag him further.

ANGLE - ELLY

Tears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops

the flowers on Shelly's grave.

ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE

Still too far away to matter.

RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat

before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's

blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG

She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly

wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns

toward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE

Eric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the

undisturbed  earth there.

HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY

Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

She walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)

A grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,

her doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we

notice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is

sprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME

B.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is

hectic but natural.

This does not get the expected smile from Elly.

Elly turns from the window and NODS silently.

ELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE

The aforementioned grey day in the city.

ANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.

Darla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much

more connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is

clutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past

Elly, out the window.

Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS

her hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE

Elly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is

Elly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES

INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the

crow.  Watching.  Waiting.
