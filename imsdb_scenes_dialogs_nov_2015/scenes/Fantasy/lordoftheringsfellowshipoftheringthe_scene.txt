into the Soundtrack.

"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's

head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:

sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his

feet and pushes his way towards the bar.

Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.

to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all

the attention turns to Frodo...

The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to

hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto

his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp

intake of breath...followed by total silence.

FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring:

THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow

motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative

quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow

motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is

hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE

EYE, wreathed in flames.

VOICE OF SAURON

There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death...

5 Ringwraiths appear...brandishing Gleaming swords, they move

slowly towards the hobbits. In the center is their

leader...the WITCH KING!

Witch King, who blocks the blow with his own sword. Sam's

blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,

sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,

throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in

the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into

his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a

chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any

longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He

disappears.

Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world...he looks

upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their TRUE APPEARANCE:

Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and

Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand

towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's

trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the

ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.

The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo

with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger

sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the

RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch

in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea

of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint

image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.

With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring off

his finger...

...Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him.

Another Ringwraith is burning and screaming...others screech

TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.

Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is

large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice.

INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and

empty space. Gandalf pauses...

blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows

spring up and flee...

their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.

Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,

polished and smooth as glass.

Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows

are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the

doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...

INT. BALIN'S TOMB, MORIA -- DAY

Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a

narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near

the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the

far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls

directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a

single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great

slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...

Gimli sobs.

Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto

the white stone slab.

CONTINUED:

Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from

the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and

appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and

break as he opens it...

Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against

the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton

tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin

before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as

the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing

loudly!

INT. MORIA CAVERNS -- DAY

Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.

ANGLE ON:    PIPPIN, CHASTENED.

They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths

below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of

Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts

nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries...

Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt...

CONTINUED:

Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's

Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing

blade!

Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir

catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in

his eyes.

Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the

tomb.

BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments,

and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave

troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in

2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of

Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into

Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!

Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The

cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles

backwards...the huge club descends for the killing

blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword

slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,

spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a

sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation

he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels

over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it

too, drops.

The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest

with his spear.

CONTINUED: (2)

Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip

and slammed against the wall.

The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee,

bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas

fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn

rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo

appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits

looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge

breath.

Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll

Spear did not pierce the mithril."

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again!

Gandalf turns to the others.

INT. DWAROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA -- DAY

Gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge Dwarrowdelf

Chamber.

CONTINUED:

They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start

scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches!

Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army

that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills

the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the

pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back

Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the

darkness.

A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the

hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...

INT. STAIRWAY OF KHASAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY

The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great

40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a

blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP

of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a

dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his

staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.

Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him.

THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up

Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE,

spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others:

Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm.

CONTINUED:

INT. BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY

The Fellowship run into a hall...the floor is split with

fissures that spit flame.

They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb

or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship

recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the

last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the

Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks

back in horror:

Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and

draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.

Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow

bridge.

flame...Gandalf blocks with his sword...a ringing clash and

the Balrog's sword shatters into molten fragments!

GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons up his LAST RESERVES OF

STRENGTH!

CONTINUED:

He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of

white flame springs up... the staff shatters...the bridge

breaks... right at Balrog's feet. The stone bridge drops away

into the gulf...from under the Balrog. For a moment, the

great Beast remains poised in the air...then it plunges down:

in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face..Gandalf remains

trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. Slow motion: As

the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire... Slow

motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's

knees, dragging him over the brink! Gandalf just manages to

hand on by his fingertips

CLOSE ON: Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away...

following the Balrog into the bottomless Abyss! Frodo cries

out! Boromir scoops him up and carries him away.

They rush towards an archway.

EXT. DIMROLL DALE DOOR -- DAY

The Fellowship tumble out of the Great Eastern Gate on to a

grassy sunlit hillside. Sam, Merry, and Pippin fall slowly to

the ground, Sobbing...Aragorn turns to Legolas and Gimli.

CONTINUED:

CLOSE ON: FRODO SLOWLY TURNS...a look of numb shock on his

devastated face. The Fellowship marches on.

EXT. DIMRILL DALE HILLSIDE--DUSK

Aragorn scours ahead of the company, as they stumble on in

the fading light...in the distance the shimmer of a large

forest can be seen...Lothlorien!

EXT. EDGE OF LOTHLORIEN--DUSK

WIDE ON: The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with

yellow flowers..above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by

silver pillars...the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks

nervously around...

Frodo hesitates...a STRANGE VOICE whispers in his head...

CONTINUED:

The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES.

Deadly arrows aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the Elvish

captain steps forward... he looks at Gimli with disdain.

Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo.

EXT. LOTHLORIEN HILLTOP -- DAY

Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top.   They look with

wonderment at the vista spread before them.

Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of

the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,

taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the

mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of

the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east

of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale

gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land

appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,

it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies

on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie

beyond.

INT. CELEBORN'S CHAMBER, CARAS GALADHON -- NIGHT

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls

are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the

trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its

crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair

is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no

sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady

of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,

unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...

Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn.

Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam.

side... Powerful, divine...no longer of this world..a

Piercing white light surrounds her.

EXT. CARAS GALADHON LAWN -- NIGHT

Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a

pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on

soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL

SINGING drifts down from the trees above.

Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face.

Aragorn kneels down beside him.

CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair.

CONTINUED:

Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes

heart,

Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet

sadness only when Boromir looks away.

LATER....

The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring

loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the

lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by

instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the

moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by

an invisible force.

EXT. GALADRIELS GLADE, LORTHLORIEN -- NIGHT

Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits

a shallow Silver Basin. Galadriel leads Frodo into the small

Glade.

Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug...a

glow rises from the water.

Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers     into the

glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into     the water...

suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure     of an old

man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long      road. Frodo

leans closer to the mirror's surface...

CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO!

FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.

Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo

reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.

Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision

shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The

image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings

burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting

and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party

tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to

grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing

him entirely.

IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields

and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching

smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the

Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-

stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-

hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black

abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable

to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches

above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire

erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself

away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light

instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his

senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,

unmoved, untouched by the horror.

Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely...Frodo looks down...in

his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at

Galadriel.

CONTINUED:

Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's

eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.

Galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender Elf-woman once more,

clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

Frodo realizes what her message is.

The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand...his fingers close

over it.

INT. ORTHANC CHAMBER -- DAY

Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean

intelligence.

INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD -- DAY

QUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored...Breastplate...Leg

guards, Helmet...a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. The URUK-

HAI are smearing themselves in white paint...a creepy

ritualistic ceremony...the white hand of Isengard is smeared

on bodies, faces, and armor. SARUMAN address a crowd of 200

fully armed URUK-HAI.

EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY

Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,

their powerful legs carrying them at speed.

EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN

The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from

the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves

quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small

Crystal Phial.

CONTINUED:

As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,

watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo

still hears her voice...

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven

boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees

slowly give way to a brown and withered land.

EXT. FOREST -- DAY

The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly

purpose.

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY

A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale

sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.

EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN

The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky

gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly

paddling in the stern.

Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide

on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot

pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of

Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power

and majesty.

Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the

silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.

The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes

them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.

CONTINUED:

Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to

reveal a large lake only a mile down river...

EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY

ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP

As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded

shore.

Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency.

Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest...

CONTINUED:

Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means.

Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling

at Gimli's feet...

Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his

eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp

bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!

EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His

feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes

follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the

summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!

Frodo freezes....

Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.

Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in

the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be

heard

Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself

up.

CONTINUED:

Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.

Frodo turns to leave.

Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo

has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his

neck..and rams it on his finger.

CONTINUED: (2)

EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY

FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy

shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's

distraught voice carries from another dimension:

Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers

up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone

pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the

throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around

him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to

shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope

towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of

holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from

Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships

sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in

motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes

against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills

Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,

tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!

SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF

LIGHT.

SAURON (V.O.)

(IN BLACK SPEECH)

They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down

the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,

seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring

off his finger...

EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY

Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the

ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!

Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.

Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by the

movement.

Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It

glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's

eyes are drawn to it.

Aragorn freezes!   He draws his sword.

Frodo hesitates.

CONTINUED:

Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto

Amon Hen behind Aragorn!

Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he

brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as

others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,

away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst

the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he

is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into

the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.

Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.

EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY

Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet

thunder down behind him.

Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his

URUKS.

Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a

tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the

forest rings out.

Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few

feet away.

Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great

sadness in his eyes...

CONTINUED:

Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.        Understanding.

Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at

his arm.

THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and

Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards

the lake.

Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling

URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear

guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he

tries to protect Merry and Pippin...

Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's

chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another

arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and

Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.

Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn

charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock

into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races

towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI

arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI

lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven

in two.

Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.

Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.   Boromir's

fingers tighten around the hilt.

On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish

Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as

hard as he can through the forest...

Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the

camera moves in on the ring.

Tears fall down Frodo's face...

With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his

vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish

boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs

toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.

wind. Frodo whispers to himself

Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.

SPLASH!   FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the

water.

CONTINUED:

Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo

drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.

Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a

bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam

look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming

down both their faces.

Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends

hug.

The two Hobbits row through the water...

EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY

Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing

water...Boromir's body slides under camera.

He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his

chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat

drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls

of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.

CONTINUED:

Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small

Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and

Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.

Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.

Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it

on.

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,

following the URUK-HAI trail.

EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP -- DAY

Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.

A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,

oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the

mountains....MORDOR!

outlook, Sam is undeterred...

WIDE ON: THE TWO HOBBITS SETTING OFF TOWARD MORDOR.
