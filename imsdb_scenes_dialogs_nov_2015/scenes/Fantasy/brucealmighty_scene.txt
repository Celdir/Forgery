INT. KOWOLSKI'S BAKERY - KITCHEN - DAY

A news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by

are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY,

MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family

employees. A "30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY" sign hangs in the

background.

BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying

to place a large segment of wayward hair.

The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.

She holds out a HAIR NET.

Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up

looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.

Ally laughs.

Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.

(Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his

"REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery

that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms

Bruce's version is to the 7th power.)

Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.

The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background,

toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks

dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.

Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off.

Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE

TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh.

The frame FREEZES.

We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote,

watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now...

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box

of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them

into a photo album.

Grace looks at a photo,

She places it in the album.

Bruce points to the TV as he says "future," not realizing

he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the

hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.

Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly

has a fragile temperament.

Grace holds up a photo.

It's the two of them, younger, laughing.

It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids

for the bouquet.

Grace cuddles into Bruce.

Grace rolls over onto Bruce.

Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.

They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.

Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the

bedroom.

A TELEVISION SCREEN

We see the INTRO FOR SIXTY MINUTES:

LESLIE STAHL is HIT IN THE NECK WITH A TRANQUILIZER DART.

Her head wavers, then DROPS on the desk. The camera PANS to

BRUCE, who lowers a bamboo blow gun, cooly addresses camera.

THE SIXTY MINUTES TICKING CLOCK

BRUCE'S ALARM CLOCK - IT RINGS

We are in. . .

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face. Grace

hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce.

She kisses Bruce, gets up.

The covers are RIPPED OUT OF FRAME.   Bruce throws a mock

hissy fit.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce watches TV as he buttons his shirt.

MOMENTS LATER

Bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign-

off.

ANGLE - SAM

Peeing in the corner on the carpet.

INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE

Bruce runs along carrying the peeing Sam with extended arms

dodges a man ascending the stares, who gets sprinkled.

EXT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Bruce makes it outside, sets Sam down on the grass. Sam

looks up innocently at Bruce, finished.

EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - MORNING

Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars

unloading kids. A 2003 MERCEDES SRL passes by.

Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school

with a BLOOD DRIVE SIGN.

Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...

She places a STRING OF PRAYER BEADS on the rearview mirror.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. He stares at the

prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look.

A big accident ahead. Bruce looks at his watch, he's

screwed. A person is CARRIED BY ON A STRETCHER, Bruce is

oblivious.

Bruce's BEEPER sounds.      He checks it.

He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels

off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars.

SFX: SIREN

Bruce pulls over, fumes.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping

over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS

MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign

boards. The various "warnings" change daily. Today's SIGN

reads:

Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then

continues on.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs

right into BOBBY, the endlessly yammering PASTRY CART GUY.

He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche.

Bobby belts out a laugh.

Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth. Bruce feigns liking

it with exasperation.

Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for

cash.

Bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy

anchorwoman, SUSAN ORTEGA across the room.

Bruce offers his money to Bobby.

Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off.

INT. STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY

ON THE MONITOR:

Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then

continues on.

IN THE ROOM

The morning meeting is well in progress. Leading the group

is the station manager and Bruce's boss, JACK KELLER, 50's, a

constant furrow in his brow.

Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival

EVAN BAXTER, 30' s , a walking statement. Impeccable posture,

perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it.

FRED DONOHUE, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned,

vain weatherman, DALLAS COLEMAN and segment producer Ally

Loman.

A beat and they all crack up.

More laughs.                                                    *

Bruce bursts into the room. The meeting stops. Jack doesn't

need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.

This hits Bruce hard. A beat of silence.

The others chuckle. Only Ally remains sympathetic.

More laughs.

Jack continues with assignments. Evan sits smugly, as Bruce

slides down into his chair, deflated.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. Bruce

catches up .to him.

Jack takes his sandwich and leaves. Bobby leans to Bruce.

Bruce looks at Bobby, continues after and catches Jack.

Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It

scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other

for a beat.

Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.

He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA

saunters by.

Hi, Susan.                           Hi, Susan.

Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing.

Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before.              *

Bruce hugs Jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest.

Bruce takes off, Jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his

chest. We hear children's joyous SHRIEKS...

INT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - DAY

A COUPLE DOZEN KIDS playing at Grace's self-starter business,

a one room day care center filled with children and toys.

Grace turns, reacts.

ON MARTIN - AN ADORABLE HISPANIC BOY

He shakes his head "no."

He does. His tongue sparkles with glitter.

Grace's sister, Debbie, enters. She's wearing a nurse's

outfit. Her youngest, ZOE, 3, runs over to greet her.

She spreads paste on the paper, sprinkles glitter.

Martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth.

Grace snatches it.

The phone RINGS.

Debbie does.

EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - DAY

Bruce is on his cell phone, while the NEWS CREW races around,

setting up for the report. The FALLS ROAR behind him and the

Mate of the Mist sightseeing boat is in the b.g.

INTERCUT DAY CARE AND FALLS

Grace GRABS THE PHONE.

Grace quickly switches gears.   She experienced the premature-

celebration before.

Ally interrupts, indicating the time.

Debbie turns to Grace.                                           *

EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - MAID OF THE MIST BOAT - DAY

Ally hustles Bruce toward the bow of the boat, as he places

his ear piece.

She hands Bruce a very stupid looking, blue "falls" shaped

UMBRELLA with the MAID OF THE MIST INSIGNIA.

Bruce takes the umbrella.

'     '               BRUCE

She positions A VERY, VERY OLD WOMAN next to Bruce.

Bruce looks upward at the ridiculous umbrella. Mutters

encouragement to himself.

THE LIVE FEED IN THE CAMERA TRUCK AT THE FALLS

Some of the CREW MEMBERS watch the feed.

ON TV

Pete Fineman is reporting.

The female co-anchor, SUSAN ORTEGA:

Pete smiles a proud, heart-felt smile.

ON BRUCE

Listening to the feed. His FACE GOES WHITE.      He stands in

shock.

Evan is seated next to Susan.

The other news anchors and Evan himself chuckle at "his"

joke. Bruce listens on the feed, beyond stunned.

EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - CONTINUOUS

Bruce stands like a deer in headlights, drenched, holding the

ridiculous umbrella. Ally sig nals Bruce he's on. He stares

into camera, numb.

INT. SMALL WONDER DAY CARE - SAME TIME

The kids are gone. Grace watches the TV with a few other

teachers. She's concerned.

All work has stopped. Stunned staffers stare at the monitor.

INT. STUDIO CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jack stands with his jaw dropped, snaps out of it.

EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - CONTINUOUS

Bruce is now licking the camera lens.    He steps back and

signs-off. Smooth as silk.

INT. STUDIO CONTROL ROOM - .CONTINUOUS

Susan Ortega stares frozen blankly into camera.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Bruce is TOSSED OUT THE FRONT DOORS, his box of possessions

spilling on the ground. Bruce FLAILS at the building.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Bruce carries his box to his car, when he HEARS A NOISE.

A street GANG is hassling the HOMELESS SIGN GUY. Pushing him

around, breaking and painting over his signs.

Instinctively, Bruce walks over.

They turn, look at Bruce, laugh and head off.    Bruce helps

the Sign Guy up, looks after the Gang.

They stop cold, turn back to Bruce and CHARGE AT HIM. Bruce

attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile,

swinging and kicking.

Bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car. We

hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the

gang running off. Bruce slowly gets up.

Reveal Bruce's car, WINDOW'S SMASHED, PAINT SCRAPED and the

word "HERO" KEY SCRATCHED ON THE DOOR.

Bruce gets in, pulls out of the parking lot passing the

Homeless Man who sits beaten up holding a scrawled out sign

"LIFE IS. JUST"

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bruce is pacing, holding an ICE PACK to his swollen lip.

Sam starts PEEING ON THE RUG.

Grace puts Sam outside. Returns, trying to calm Bruce.

Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the

photo albums to floor.

Grace starts to cry.

Bruce grabs his keys and heads out.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

It's RAINING now. Bruce drives, going nowhere in particular.

His frustration is turning to desperation.

Bruce passes a BLINKING YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT, doesn't

notice. . .

A PEDESTRIAN stepping into the crosswalk, steps back out of

the way.

Bruce is oblivious.

A TRUCK TRANSPORTING VARIOUS ROAD SIGNS pulls in front of

Br uce . F our way s, bli nki ng. The va rie d s igns re ad: Yi eld ,

Wrong Way, Dead End, Do Not Enter, Stop.

Bruce spots the PRAYER BEADS hanging on the rearview mirror.

He hits a bump and the BEADS DROP TO THE FLOOR.        Bruce

reaches down, fishes for the beads...

And BAM!11 BRUCE'S CAR SLAMS INTO A LIGHT POST.

EXT. STREET - LAKE EERIE - CONTINUOUS

Bruce stumbles out, surveys his demolished car, then looks at

the beads in his hands. He begins to laugh maniacally.

He spots the lake, starts running toward it like a madman,

HEAVES THE PRAYER BEADS INTO THE LAKE. He looks heavenward,

challenging the Infinite.

A beat of silence then Bruce's BEEPER GOES OFF. He cynically

chuckles at the timing, checks it, sees 772-5623.

Bruce walks off toward his wrecked car, it BEEPS AGAIN.

CLOSE ON - AN ALARM CLOCK

The BEEPING continues. We are in. . .

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce wakes, slaps at the alarm clock, groggy, reaches for

the phone, finally realizes it's the beeper. He gets up,

begrudgingly, checks it. The same number.

Bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom.

The beeper BEEPS. Bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens

the window, grabs the beeper and FIRES IT OUT. It SHATTERS

against a telephone pole. He calmly continues to the

bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM

A note is stuck in the bathroom mirror, with an old picture

of he and Grace in happier times. The note simply says:

"I LOVE YOU.    WE NEED TO TALK.

Grace"

Peering over top of the note, Bruce sees Sam circling on the

rug.

EXT. STAIR WELL - CONTINUOUS

Bruce runs down the stairs carrying the trickling, Sam.

EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

Bruce sets Sam on the grass. Sam looks up, finished.

BEEP, BEEP, BEEP...

Bruce walks over to the shattered beeper. He picks up a

small piece of it containing the LED read out: 772-5623

ON BRUCE - AMAZED

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

A PHONE - BRUCE DIALS THE NUMBER

A PRERECORDED VOICE ANSWERS

Bruce reaches for a pen, begins jotting down the address.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

An old building on the outskirts of town. A faded sign

painted on the wall reads, OMNI PRESENTS.

Bruce's demolished car enters frame.      He studies the area and

building suspiciously.

Bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, STEPS

IN A PUDDLE. He SINKS UP TO HIS KNEE.

He gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside.

INT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY

Bruce enters and checks the BUILDING DIRECTORY.      It reads:

OMNI PRESENTS UNLTD.

Pers onnel    Rm. 7

Ac coun ting Rm. 7

Security      Rm . 7

Creativ e     Rm. 7

Bruce turns to see a JANITOR mopping the floor.     He looks at

Bruce's wet leg, offers the mop.

He points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.

Bruce heads for the stairs.

He continues on.

SEVENTH FLOOR

The stairwell door opens up to a LARGE ROOM with a SINGLE

DESK at the end of an otherwise empty space.

Bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending

into a hole in the ceiling.

CLICK and an INSANELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATES, shining

down blinding Bruce.

An electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the

ladder.

As he talks he steps down next to Bruce and we see that it is

the SAME JANITOR.

The two stand, angelically illuminated.    Bruce tries to put

everything together.

The Janitor CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE and the light goes off.

The Janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit.

He extends his hand to Bruce.

He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.

Bruce approaches the desk.

He points out a single drawer file cabinet.

Bruce pulls the drawer and it FLIES OPEN, DRAGGING HIM THE

FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM --

The Janitor casually pulls a file.

He thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer

dramatically sucks closed, DRAGGING BRUCE BACK. The Janitor

reads from the file.

Bruce stands, dazed.

Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOWARD

GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again.

He shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers

disappear. God approaches Bruce.

Bruce backs away from God.

He turns to go but GOD STANDS BEFORE HIM in the Janitor

uniform, holding the mop.

Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and

God the Janitor has also vanished. A beat, then Bruce

sprints out of the room.

EXT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY

Bruce barrels out of the building --

He races to his car stepping in the SAME PUDDLE, but this

time his foot doesn't sink, he WALKS RIGHT ACROSS IT. He

paus es f or a bea t --

He races on.

INT. BRUCE'S CAR

Bruce jumps in, turns the key, the car turns over but doesn't

start.

We hear the car wind down to nothing. Bruce releases the key

pounds the steering wheel in frustration.

The car INSTANTLY starts.

Bruce backs up, peels out.

MUSIC UP: "HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS"

EXT. CITY STREETS

Bruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself,

immediately stops whistling.

Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic,

dodging and passing cars right and left.

Suddenly there is a GUY IN A RED PIT CREW SUIT standing

before Bruce waving a red flag. Bruce swerves to avoid the

man and SCREECHES into a pit stop. Several other red-suited

Italian men engulf the car. Bruce watches in amazement as the

professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on HUGE MAG

TIRES, gases him up, etc. PAUL NEWMAN leans into the

driver's window.

Bruce responds against his will IN PERFECT ITALIAN --

Bruce reacts shocked.   The crew backs off and urges him on in

Italian.

Bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control

the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb. His car door

won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window.

He rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal

looking Tauras. Not knowing what to do, he slips into a

diner.

INT. DINER - DAY

Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. The only other

patron is an OLD MAN seated at the counter.

An older. Sally Kirkland-type WAITRESS, order pad in hand,

stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow.

The waitress pours him a cup.

She heads off.    Bruce sits thinking.   Could it be real?

He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out

his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS

HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand.

Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and

sugar into his cup, looks around the table.

Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his

napkin.

The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves

further down the counter.

The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.

Bruce looks at the soup. His look grows intense.   He slowly

raises his hands over the soup bowl....

MUSIC UP: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THEME

The front door blows open, as A WIND SWIRLS through the diner

and with all the flourish of Moses at the Red Sea, BRUCE

PARTS HIS RED SOUP.

A little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the

edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.

Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal

collapsing on the cockroach. He looks up at God standing

beside the booth. Bruce is now awestruck.

EXT. LAKE ERIE - DAY

God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go.

God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore.

Off Bruce's look.

Suddenly a LARGE SAILBOAT SAIL PASSES RIGHT BY THEM.   Bruce

looks to the sail, oddly, then...

WIDE ANGLE - REVEAL God and Bruce are now walking ON THE LAKE

about 100 feet from the shore. They watch the sailboat pass.

Bruce is awestruck.

God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out THE PRAYER BEADS.

He pockets them as he talks.

WIDE MASTER - BUFFALO CITY-SCAPE

God and Bruce are tiny figures on the river, as God begins to

walk away.

ON BRUCE

Left alone, Bruce begins to carefully tip toe back to shore,

progresses to a full sprint.

INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Grace and Debbie stand at the check-out stand. Grace flips

through a celeb magazine, as Debbie places the last few items

from the cart to the conveyor belt.

In the background, throughout, Debbie's daughter, Zoe is

grabbing random items off the shelves and placing them on the

belt.

Grace checks her cell phone screen.

Zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt.

The CLERK finishes ringing the last item.

Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter

items. Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred

or so Tic-Tac mint containers.

The people in line hem and haw, exasperated.

Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion.

EXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK

Bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence.

He turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it BLASTS

WATER. KIDS run off their front steps, start playing.

A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes' walking toward him. As she

passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH

and turns to watch her SKIRT FLY UP.

He spots a    mannequin in a store window display, wearing a

cool, casu   al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens

them, HE'S   WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is

dressed in   his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better.

Bruce rounds the corner, sees the SAME GANG that beat him up,

hanging out in the alley.

EXT. ALLEY

Bruce approaches the gang.

The gang members turn to Bruce.

He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five.

A beat, then the Hoods BURST OUT LAUGHING.         A few circle

behind, surrounding Bruce.

The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a

MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants.

The Big Guy looks at Hood #1.

Hood #1 faints from shock.

ANOTHER BRUCE steps out from behind a stack of crates.

As Bruce talks, DUPLICATE BRUCE'S begin popping out from

various spots, a doorway, hanging down from a fire escape, a

dumpster pops open, six Bruce's jump out.

T HE B RUGES CONV ERGE ON TH E GA NG --

Hood #2 is instantly tackled by THREE BRUGES --

ONE BRUCE kneels down behind a hood, ANOTHER BRUCE pushes him

down over his back. The two Bruce's high-five --

A Hood climbs a fire escape. ONE BRUCE gives a hand up to

ANOTHER BRUCE, who takes pursuit. ANOTHER BRUCE leans out of

a window SMASHES a potted plant over his head --

ON THE MONKEY - SCREECHING, ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT

Our Bruce stands in the middle of the action, happily

watching the mayhem.

Hood #2 takes off running, the gang members follow.

The Bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into Bruce's body.

Bruce takes a deep breath, OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE, RELEASING A

SWARM OF LOCUSTS --

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The gang streams out of the alley screaming, COVERED IN

LOCUSTS.

Bruce exits the alley, the monkey at his side.        He looks down

to the monkey.

The monkey takes off back into the alley, as we see HOOD #1

stumbling to his feet.

He takes off running, the monkey in hot pursuit.

ON BRUCE

He belches and one last locust flies out.      He reacts to the

unpleasant aftertaste and walks off.

CLOSE ON - BRUCE

We widen to an UP ANGLE of him standing on the top of

Buffalo's tallest SKYSCRAPER. Clouds swirl behind him. He

looks out over the vast city lights, opens his arms and

proclaims to the world.

Bruce poses in dramatic god-like form, lightning crashes

behind him. He is an awesome god.

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box

of photos working on the album. She takes a sip of wine,

sets down the glass. Sam walks over and laps up the wine.

Grace hears Bruce coming up the stairs, singing.

Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she gets

up, opens the door and there stands BRUCE, beaming smile,

holding a very unique BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.

Grace takes the flowers, gives Bruce a kiss, still sizing up

his mood.

Grace goes to put them in water.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bruce breezes through, casually instructs the stereo as he

passes.

The Stereo illuminates and Barry White music plays.

EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

Bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony. He surveys

the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and ERASES THE

CLOUDS, LIKE ON A CHALKBOARD.

Still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon

and makes a LASSOING MOTION, THEN BEGINS TO PULL.

OUTER SPACE - BEHIND THE MOON

Earth far off in the distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE

the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH.

BACK TO SCENE

Bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with

points of his finger.

Grace joins Bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the

perfectly orchestrated sky.

Bruce puts his arms around Grace from behind.

Bruce starts kissing her neck. Grace turns, .they kiss and a

METEOR SHOWER lights the sky behind them. The kiss ends.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Grace grabs a neglige from the drawer, heads into the

bathroom. Bruce enters, adjusts the ambience of the room,

BLOWS THE LIGHTS OUT with a quick puff of air, LIGHTS CANDLES

with a gesture. His clothes magically fall away.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Grace slips her neglige on, begins brushing her hair.

Grace SHUDDERS a bit at the word "pleasure", quickly finishes *

brushing, picks up her lipstick.                             *

GRACE'S KNEES BUCKLE, causing the lipstick to smear across *

her face. She sits down on the toilet seat to get a hold of *

herself.                                                    *

Grace has a very POWERFUL ORGASM and slides off the toilet *

out of frame to the ground.                                *

BRUCE

Standing at the door with both arms extended toward the

bathroom like an WARLOCK CASTING A SPELL. Suddenly the light

hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a

casual pose.

Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal.

She dives on Bruce, attacking him.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

ON TV - THE MORNING NEWS

We see remote footage of Japanese families being airlifted

from root tops.

Grace half watches the newscast as she finishes breakfast.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce lies blissfully asleep. Big smile, life is good.

Then, we hear WHISPERING - Like distant voices MURMURING all

at once. Bruce wakes with a start. He looks around puzzled,

sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the

voices fade away.

ANGLE - SAM

Circling, getting ready to go on the carpet. Bruce casually

warns.

Sam looks at Bruce for a beat, then  walks into bathroom,

raises the toilet seat with his nos e, and STANDS UP ON HIS

TWO HIND LEGS, HOLDING HIS SNAUSAGE WITH HIS FRONT PAWS (NO,

WE DON'T SEE IT) AND STARTS TO GO.   He looks proudly back at

Bruce.

INT. KITCHEN

Grace places breakfast on the table. Bruce comes out, fully

dressed with a spring in his step.

Bruce sits, Grace sets down his plate, leans close.

Bruce enjoys his grilled cheese.

Bruce looks away, guilty, trying to be nonchalant.

They aren't.    They are clearly bigger.      She holds them.

Bruce throws up his hands.

He stops, turns. A new confident Bruce.

MUSIC UP:

EXT. BRUCE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bruce heads for his severely beat-up junker car whistling

"What if God were One of Us."

INT. BRUCE'S CAR

CLOSE ON - BRUCE

He gets in, fastens his seat belt, as two teenagers cruise by

on skateboards, stop outside Bruce's window.

MASTER - STREET

Reveal Bruce's car is now a brand new MERCEDES 2003 VISION

SLR. He starts and revs THE POWERFUL NEW ENGINE and peels

out.

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Bruce turns the corner into bumper to bumper traffic. No

problem, the traffic magically opens up for him, cars

instantly swerving right and left clearing a path for Bruce.

He waves as he passes.

EXT. POLICE TRAINING CENTER - DAY

A POLICE DOG, HANK, performs some standard TAKE DOWNS by

"attacking" a "criminal" (trainer) on the run. PHIL, a

reporter from a rival station is wrapping up his story.

The crew start to wrap up.

ANGLE - BRUCE

Watching the action from the side, holding his own home video

camera. Phil spots him.

Phil and a couple of his crew laugh, as they load the last of

their equipment into the van and shut the doors.

Phil turns back, Bruce and he exchange a glance.

Hank is DIGGING FURIOUSLY, making a BIG HOLE. The Policeman

jogs over, joins the trainer. They watch as TWO DRESS SHOES

EXTREME CLOSE ON - THE VAN'S DOOR LOCK

It LOCKS AUTOMATICALLY.   The CAMERAMAN yanks at the door.

Bruce casually turns his camera on, gives Phil a "tough

break" look, heads for the scene, as Phil and his crew

scramble around the van.

ON A TV

We cut to the pre-taped story. Bruce stands with Hank and

his trainer before camera, the body being exhumed from the

ground behind him.

We see footage of PHIL AND HIS NEWS CREW, being cuffed on the

ground, as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled

from the van.

EXT. NEWS STATION - DAY

As Bruce pulls up in front of the building the NO PARKING

SIGN flies back into the bushes and the RED CURB TRANSFORMS

TO GREEN as though being sloppily painted with invisible

brushes.

Bruce exits the car and smooths past the Homeless Sign Guy,

who sits in his usual spot. His sign reads:

"HEAVEN IS AT HAND.   LEGGO YOUR EGGO."

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

Bruce cruises through the office, fielding greetings.

Susan Ortega smooths up to Bruce.

She give's Bruce a "look" and continues on. Bruce is a bit

inflated by the encounter.

Bobby the pastry cart guy wheels his cart up along side.

Bobby CUTS BRUCE OFF WITH HIS CART.    Bruce is forced to stop.

Bobby forces a ladle of rhubarb out at Bruce.

Bruce continues    off, as Bobby stops cold, adopts an odd

expression, then    his EYES ROLL UP IN THEIR SOCKETS, SPIN ALL

THE WAR AROUND,    THEN GLOW RED. LITTLE HORN BUMPS PUSH UP

FROM HIS SKULL.     He turns instantly demonic.

An overly PERKY FEMALE OFFICE WORKER approaches Bobby from

behind.

She is instantly hit in the chest with a stream of green

vomit. A beat and Bobby offers out a plastic spoon.

several monitors. Susan Ortega opens.

attendant.

Margarita pulls the wrap tightly around Debbie.

Debbie eyes Margarita.

Margarita reaches Debbie's waist and YANKS tightly.

Margarita senses the attitude and pulls tighter. Debbie

reacts.

Margarita motions for Debbie to lay down and leaves.    Debbie

struggles to lay down.

Debbie slides to the ground, Grace cracks up, gets up to

help, but also in mummy wrap, topples on top of her. They

both laugh and struggling to get up.

Hearing the ruckus, Margarita enters and gasps.

Grace and Debbie crack up harder.

Margarita tries to pull them up, but falls too.

Grace and Debbie can't stop laughing.

INT. CHEZ L'AMOUR - NIGHT

A waiter pours the first trickle of wine into Bruce's glass.

Bruce whiffs it, tastes it.

Grace looks over the menu as Bruce notices people at various

tables eyeing him. He glances up to a ceiling light and

REDIRECTS IT with his mind, so it SPOTLIGHTS HIM in golden

light.

TWO CUTE GIRLS with dates SMILE and wave.     He waves back.

Bruce looks at Grace lovingly.      He takes her hand.

Grace beams, looks at Bruce with total love.

Grace's face falls.    She does her best to cover.

She's having a hard time covering her let down.

Bruce races through the restaurant kitchen holding his ears -

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

He BURSTS out the kitchen exit into the alley. Unclasps his

ears, but no relief. The whispers are now loud voices. We

start to make out fragments of words "Please," "Help me,"

etc.

Overwhelmed and scared, he slides down the alley wall,

covering his face, then TOTAL SILENCE --

Bruce lowers his hands and finds himself SITTING ATOP A HIGH

MOUNTAIN PEAK.

God sits down next to Bruce.

God laughs at this one.

God laughs.

God forms a snowball in his hands as he talks.

A DOORWAY OPENS like a crack in space. Grace steps out, sees

Bruce.

With that, the terrain TRANSFORMS back into the alley where

Grace has been standing all along. She can not see .God.

Bruce fakes a couple big breaths.

Bruce looks to God to shut up.

Grace looks at him like he's nuts.

Just then, the WHISPERS start in again.        Bruce reacts.

Bruce puts his hands to his ears.       Grace takes this as him

not wanting to listen to her.

Grace heads back into the restaurant. Bruce stands

completely frustrated.

God smiles.

Suddenly, Grace bounds out of the bathroom.                        *

Grace's boobs are enormous! A healthy D-cup.

Bruce jumps up from the computer, hides what he's doing...

She turns profile, her back sways causing her ass to stick

out.

Bruce gets up, walks to Grace.

She breaks away and sees the computer is on.                    *

Bruce tries to cover.                                           *

EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - LATER

Grace is talking with one of the other teachers. The kids,

He's hit in the head by a ball.    Grace can't help but smiles

Bruce leaps at the opportunity.

Martin is standing nearby.

EXT. DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

A FULL ON RIOT in progress. College students, city dwellers

going crazy. Cars are burning, people are out of control.

Escaped convicts are running in and out of stores looting

right alongside ordinary citizens.

The Kowolski brothers and Momma Kowolski are helpless against

the onslaught as pillagers run out of the bakery carrying

cakes, pies, bread - whatever they can get their hands on.

Bruce stumbles through the mayhem, confused.

They continue to trash the area.

Cars are being rolled over. A lone POLICE OFFICER protects

himself with his shield as he's pelted with various debris.

The Officer PULLS BRUCE down behind a car.

The Officer heads out. Bruce stands, then quickly DUCKS, as

a bottle is tossed through a window that has a lotto sticker

on it.

BACK TO SCENE

Bruce looks up at a burning building with a flaming "Mr.

looks out over the rioters.

ON BRUCE

We see the anger build in his face, like Moses looking down

on the Israelites. He RAISES HIS ARMS. DARK CLOUDS SWIRL IN

THE SKY. WIND BLOWS. LIGHTENING CRACKS.

A BOLT OF LIGHTENING shoots right into the middle of the

rioters, scattering them. People flee in every direction as

THUNDER CRASHES and lightning bolts continue to strike.

Bruce stands alone in the street, surveys the smoldering

mayhem, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the key

God gave him. He grips it tightly and...

satisfied.

God collects Bruce's mop.

God sets the mops down.

God holds up a REMOTE AND CLICKS, changing the room into the

DINER where Bruce first parted his soup. (NOTE: Whenever the

room "changes" we're actually still in the room, but seeing a

The older waitress, Ginnie, clears some dishes...

Ginnie bends down behind the counter and when she comes back

up she is a hot 21 YEAR OLD.

Ginnie bends down again, and when she comes back up, she is

HER OLDER SELF again.

God clicks the remote, changing the environment into a SCHOOL

YARD. We see the grade school where Filbert Davis, the boy

Bruce helped up the rope, is in a fight.

God clicks, changing the environment into a CONDO. We see a

lonely woman (who found the cash in her purse) sitting

depressed, rocking in a chair.

God clicks the remote again...

God clicks the images off.                                         *

God smiles, asks him again what he asked him in the alley...   *

God smiles, starts to walk away...                                 *

God claps the bright ceiling light on, walks over to the

latter.

God climbs, ascending into the light.

God stops, looks down to Bruce.

He smiles and disappears into the light, leaves Bruce

thinking.

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bruce stands in the apartment, Sam at his side. No signs of

Grace. The bed is made. Empty.

Then, he notices the BOX OF PHOTOS, the incomplete albums.

He picks up a photo of he and Grace in an even tinier

apartment, Sam is a puppy, they have little money, and

despite it all look very happy. Bruce smiles at the memory.

Reaches for a stack of photos...

EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING

Bruce sits in bumper to bumper traffic. A man's car is

broken down in the middle of the street causing the

bottleneck.

Bruce sees THE SIGN GUY by the side of the road.   His sign

reads: ALL FOR WON.

Bruce looks out at the other drivers honking and shouting at

the frustrated man.

CUT TO - the stalled car is now rolling to the shoulder and

we REVEAL that Bruce is doing the pushing.

Bobby instantly transforms to normal.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

Evan is packing his things at his desk, still looking much

worse for the wear. Bruce walks up to him.

Evan stops, looks up at Bruce, confused.

Bruce offers his hand, Evan takes it. When their hands meet,

there is a kind of ELECTRICAL CHARGE that passes between

them. Bruce walks off, Evan is confused when he catches his

reflection in the mirror. HE'S BACK TO NORMAL!

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - LATER

ON TV

Evan is manning the anchor desk and looking good doing it.

Jack is relieved.

With a little arrow pointing to the Homeless Sign Guy.

EXT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DUSK

Bruce paces, waiting for Sam.

Sam does. Bruce celebrates, does a happy dance and is

surprised to see Debbie standing there.

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT

Debbie is packing items into a box. She sees the photo

albums on the coffee table. She flips through, surprised.

Bruce nods. Debbie looks at Bruce, sizing him up.

Debbie starts to go, but turns back.

This not only touches Bruce, but it gives him an idea.

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE' S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bruce sits anxiously at the computer with Sam, checks the e--

mails and types in GRACE CONNELLY. He hits "search". 1,273

entries appear.

He types in "Grace and Bruce" and eagerly awaits. There are

335 matches. He checks a few...

Over and over, he finds the same prayer, the same entry every

morning and night for months on end.

Bruce is touched.

He KISSES SAM and races out.

EXT. DEBBIE HOUSE - NIGHT

Bruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another

special creation. He looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets

them down, picks a single, normal Daisy from the garden.

Better.

He heads for the door when he hears crying. It's Grace. He

looks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room.

He climbs the fire escape and looks in the window.

GRACE is sitting on the bed crying. As Bruce watches her

cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to LIGHTLY RAIN.

Through her tears she is praying.     Bruce looks at her with

total love.

Bruce smiles, thankful.

Bruce just stands there, stunned. He gets it. He raises a

hand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly

selfless act. He lets Grace go.

ON GRACE

Her face changes.     She wipes her eyes.   The pain is lifted.

And it is Bruce now who feels that pain. He looks at Grace.

A sad smile.

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Rain droplets splash on the river where Bruce first raged at

God. He stands in the middle of the street, looks up

heavenward, weakly. Humble.

And with that, the rain stops. The dark clouds slowly open

as beams of light cut through, shining down upon Bruce,

birds begin to chirp.adding to this magical moment as. . .

HONK1 HONKI

A MAC TRUCK SLAMS THROUGH FRAME, MOWS BRUCE DOWN. His spirit

remains in the same spot, looking confused, then STREAKS UP

heavenward.

FLYING POV

SHOOTING HEAVENWARD like a missile, THROUGH THE CLOUDS,

THROUGH THE SKY to...

A HUGE WHITE ROOM - No walls, just white as far as the eye

can see. The flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds.

Bruce finds himself standing there. He looks around and when

he turns behind him, he sees GOD. Floating on nothing, as

though sitting in the most royal throne.

A beat as Bruce takes everything in.

God doesn't respond, just listens.

God holds up the PRAYER BEADS, tosses them to Bruce. Bruce

looks at the beads, then up at God, puzzled.

God smiles the most satisfied of smiles.

Off Bruce's puzzled reaction he DROPS THROUGH THE CLOUDS --

FALLING POV - BACK DOWN TOWARDS EARTH, back THROUGH THE

CLOUDS, and right INTO ANOTHER WHITE ROOM where...

BRUCE EYES OPEN and he GASPS FOR BREATH.    The PRAYER BEADS

still clutched tightly in his hand.

TWO DOCTORS stop giving Bruce CPR, see that his vitals have

returned. . .

WIDER ANGLE - The WHITE ROOM is a HOSPITAL ROOM - Bruce is

heavily bruised and bandaged.

Bruce looks to the blood bag, sees "A/B Positive" written on

the side.

CLOSE ON BRUCE - THINKING, HIS MIND RACING

Bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees...

GRACE

A cotton swab taped to her arm. Now he remembers where he

heard of that blood type.

The doctors give Grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving

the two of them alone. Grace tentatively approaches.

She starts to cry.

Grace laughs. That's one thing Bruce could always do, is

make her laugh. Grace spots the prayer beads in Bruce's

hand, raises his arm.

Bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at Grace. He

remembers his prayer to God and the emotion wells within him

She goes to him, Bruce sits up a bit and they embrace.

EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

A BIG BLOOD DRIVE in progre   ss. Everyone is there, Grace,

Sam, Debbie and Zoe, Ginnie   and Jack, the Kowolski brothers,

Momma Kowolski, Evan, Susan   , Dallas, Fred. Bobby serves

various food items from his   cart.

Pull back to reveal BRUCE, crutch under one arm, cast on his

leg, mic in hand, reporting. He's now talking in his OWN

VOICE, much more himself.

Laughs in the background, from the people that know Bruce.

Bruce walks over to the Kowolski Brothers.

The brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see

that it's a HUGE SYRINGE SHAPED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE.

Everyone laughs.   The Kowolski brothers beam.

Bruce takes a seat as a VOLUNTEER NURSE pulls up his sleeve,

revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. She ties

off his arm, starts to probe for a vein.

The volunteer now is swabbing Bruce's arm and Bruce is

starting to sweat.

The volunteer pulls out the needle and Bruce PASSES OUT COLD.

Gasps, the Nurse leans close, total silence, then:

Bruce jolts awake making the Nurse and several people jump.

They all laugh.

He reacts to the nurse POKING the needle in. Everyone laughs

more.

He throws a look to Grace who smiles in return.    The crowd

applauds.

The camera cuts.   Bruce lowers his mic, turns to Grace.

Bruce smiles, they kiss...

As the blood drive continues, we push through the crowd,

heading somewhere. Bodies clear frame and we see the

HOMELESS MAN sitting on a park bench. His sign reads:

THEE END

The Homeless Man smiles into camera. We continue forward and

in a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly

transforms into the very pleased, FACE OF GOD, who winks and

w. . .
