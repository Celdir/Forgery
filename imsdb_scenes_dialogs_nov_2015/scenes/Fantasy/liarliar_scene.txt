QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside

their desks, addressing the class:

The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:

As Max starts to sit:

Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a

weapon. The jurors RECOIL.

He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.

He walks along the jury box:

Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.

In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN.

Fletcher returns to his seat. Jurors, dab their eyes.

EXT. COURTHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

EXT. SUBURBAN PORCH - AFTERNOON

A sad Max and his mother, AUDREY, wait silently on the

steps.

Finally, Fletcher's BMW pulls up. Max races to him,

delighted.

Fletcher instantly becomes a human version of the

TRANSFORMER TOY making ROBOTIC MOVEMENTS and SOUNDS. Max

knows the routine well, moves in perfect sine with dad. . ...

Until --                       .

Fletcher's "mechanical arm" becomes CLAW-LIKE, TICKLING MAX

like crazy! Max loves it.

Audrey watches these two kids, smiles.

Fletcher's other robotic arm becomes a "pincher", comes

after Audrey.

Fleccher IMITATES the familiar wise, old INDIAN CHIEF DAN

GEORGE.

Audrey can't help but LAUGH.

A HORN HONKS. It's the good-natured, affable JERRY. Max

runs up to him.

Jerry gives Max "five", then kisses Audrey on the lips.

Fletcher grits his teeth as Jerry gives Max a piggyback

ride to get the luggage.

Audrey heads inside.

INT. HOUSE - DAY                           .

Audrey enters, shuts the blinds.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY           '              '

Audrey locks up.

Fletcher turns sincere.

Behind her back, he FLAILS in celebration.    She glances

back... He stops, whistles innocently.

Audrey and Jerry say goodbye to Max.    They get in his

Explorer.

They drive off.

HANDFUL OF CHANGE. His son takes this in.

On their way to the elevators Fletcher and Max pass PHILIP,

a dweebish bore.

Fletcher starts off with Max, when Philip calls after him.

Fletcher heads into an open elevator... only to find the

The door again begins to close... when Philip stops it.

INT. HALLWAY OF LAW OFFICES -- AFTERNOON

Fletcher strides through the hallway with Max, calling out

GREETINGS to his colleagues.

Max looks at PETE, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him.

THOMAS glances up from a file. Max notes that he's

corpulent.

Fletcher arrives at his office. WE MEET his secretary, the

fiftyish, .worldly-wise and world-weary GRETA.

Flet cher's EYES WIDEN. He has clearly forgotten.

Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max

turns to him.     .

Max heads into the office. Fletcher closes the door behind

him turning it into a silly, two-handed wave.

Greta produces a wrapped GIFT.

She holds up another, smaller package.

She hands him a stack of mail.

As Miranda approaches, Fletcher switches gears in an

INSTANT:

Fletcher turns -- and pretends to be surprised.

He grabs Greta's gift and hands it to Miranda.

Before Fletcher answers, we:

Max eyes it with wonder.

Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the

FULL MAJOR LEAGUE STYLE UNIFORM.

Fletcher hates him.    Jerry and Max go to Jerry's car.

They drive away.

INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Miranda, and Fletcher's new client, VIRGINIA COLE, an

alluring woman in her early thirties/ review the document

he spent the previousnight putting together.

Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances.

Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all

night last night studying your

c ase. Not just your case...

b ut you. And, by now, I feel

I know you. You are the

victim here. The wife of a

cold, distant businessman.

Starved for affection, driven

into the arms of another man--

Seven.

--Seven .other men. You're not

trying to deny him what is

r ig htf ull y his. All you're

insisting on is what is

r ig htf ull y yours. And maybe

an idgy-smidgy bit more. I

think you're bending over

backwards.

Well, I did agree to give him

j oint custody of the kids...

He's always been a good

father.

And you've always been a good

wife.

Yeah. . .

There's such a thing as being

t oo nice. That's why you need

aggr essive representation. To

show the court that there is

more than one side to this

st ory. All I'm asking is the

opportunity to see that

justice is done on your

behalf.

Will you give me that

opportunity?

He stares into her eyes. A moment, then...

S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a

farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves.

Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door.

She moves in on him.

She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket.

She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep KISS.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

INT. AUDREY AND MAX'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

WE PAN DOWN from banners reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX!. . . to

a room full of guests... to a desultory five-year-old.

Audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.

Max doesn't respond.

When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..

Max doesn't believe it.                                    MAX (V.O.)

He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A

strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up,

up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15.

A clock on a wall.   It's 9:15'. We are--

INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

PAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is

adorned with Fletcher's shoes...

To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang...

To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing...

To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to

Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks--

Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing

way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.

Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing

compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully

kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF

CLOTHES follow.

The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants.

A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her

broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . .

INT. BEDROOM - FRIDAY MORNING

An alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With

regret and wonder he remembers:

INT. FLETCHER'S BATHROOM - MORNING

The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a

beautiful young WOMAN.

Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...

INT. LOBBY OF APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

We HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door

opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps

out, rubbing his freshly slapped face.

EXT. COURTROOM -, MORNING

A SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he

is accosted by a BEGGAR.

But he continues walking.

Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered

truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.

As Fletcher heads up the stairs...

INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

A winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondent's table,

He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely

wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters

with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.

Richard is SHOCKED.

Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T

GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but

succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.

Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs

the brief.

But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished

Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.

He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS

HIM to a nearby TRASH CAN where he throws it out.

At this moment the BAILIFF calls.

JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.

Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what

he just said. After an awkward silence--

Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the

world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.

Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose

unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.

FLETCHER'S P.O.V.

The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then

faster -- until we wind up squarely on --

FLETCHER'S FACE

Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise.

He BANGS the gavel.

INT. JUDGE STEVENS'S CHAMBERS - MORNING

Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge

Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness

refreshing.

She brandishes the audiotape.

Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.

Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana

thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.

She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind.

We are --

INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

Fletcher has joined Virginia at the respondent's table

But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.

Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm.

He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.

He BANGS the gavel. Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper.

INT. HALLWWAY OF LAW OFFICES - MORNING

DA ZED, Fletcher makes his way down the hall. Jane comes

toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest. He

tries to avoid her, but...

HORRIFI ED, Fletcher hurries on. The heavyset Thomas

ambulates in his way.                           -

The now panicked Fletcher breaks into a run, passing Fred.

Fletcher is RUNNING NOW, COVERING HIS EARS and SINGING

LOUDLY so as not to hear OTHER EMPLOYEE 'GREETINGS...

Fletcher speeds past--

-- And races into his office.

I NT . FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING

He leans against the door, trying to catch his breath.

He dives for his desk and rifles through it.

He holds up a BLUE PEN.

He takes a sheet of PAPER, his pen and writes "This pen

i s . . . " He tries to write an "R" but can't. He STRAINS.

S TR AIN S HARDER. He's out of his chair, on the desk. His

feet KICK OVER OBJECTS on the shelves'behind him. He

finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote

INADVERTENTLY:

Greta enters to find--

FLETCHER running around the office, shaking the blue pen in

the air.

Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair. A moment --

then Greta tentatively offers him a red pen.

Not certain why her boss would .shoot himself in the foot,

Greta nonetheless jots down his remarks.

He reacts, particularly stunned by this truth.

INT. VOLVO - MOVING / FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING

Audrey is driving Max, who wears his new baseball uniform

when her cellular PHONE RINGS. She picks it up.

We INTERCUT between car and office.

Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.

She SLAMS DOWN the phone.

INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE

Fletcher BANGS THE PHONE against his head in frustration! '.

E X T . FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN - MORNING

Hello.

Audrey, let me explain.

Something has happened to me--

Fletcher, something else is

about to happen to you.

What do you mean?

Max and I are moving to

Boston.

What?!

Jerry asked me to marry him.

He wants Max and I to fly with

him this weekend to pick out a

house. And I'm going to go.

God knows I don't have any

reason to stay here.

Wait, you can't move! If you

take Max away... I'll

practically never see him.

Well then you'll have pretty

much the same relationship you

have with him now.

Audrey, please.... Is this

because of what I just said on

the phone?

That was the straw and this is

the camel's back saying

goodbye.

Where are you?

Heading home.

He hangs up and heads for the door.      It opens and Miranda

enters.

Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.

Fletcher smiles.   It looks like he's off the hook, until--

INT. HALLWAY OF LAW OFFICES - MORNING

W e HEAR A SMACK! The door flies opens -- and a furious

Miranda stalks off.

INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING

Fletcher rubs his freshly SLAPPED FACi..

INT. BMW - MOVING / EXT, STREET - MORNING

Fletcher speeds away. He pulls the blue pen from his

pocket.

He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and

almost hits an OLD MAN.

But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring

to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a

truck. The DRIVER screams:

A long moment.

EXT. AUDREY'S HOUSE - MORNING

A cab speeds up to the house. Fletcher runs out. Audrey is

headed to her car.

EXT, POLICE IMPOUND YARD - MORNING

Audrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins

Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars.

At this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a

TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and.

parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.

He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.

She starts out.

Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very

sincere, but she can't trust him.

As Audrey gets in her car -- .

She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive,

when a new thought strikes him.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY

Fletcher marches quickly down the hall, cake box under his

arm.

INT. MAX'S KINDERGARTEN CLASS

Ms. Berry's reading a story when Fletcher enters.   Max

brightens.

She leads the kids in APPLAUSE. Fletcher takes center

s tage. The children stare, rapt with attenion.

He starts out.

The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then:

EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

They're in the playground just outside the classroom.

Max is disappointed again.

Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh.

Max doesn't laugh.

Max is amazed.

Max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession.

The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels

awful.

Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.

Max nods.

Max shakes his head "no."

A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.

Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He

takes out two birthday hats. He puts one on Max and one on

himself.

Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He

takes a breath-- and blows them out.

Fletcher spots an attractive FEMALE teacher. Fletcher

hurries to her and says something. A moment. Then she

SLAPS HIM.

Fletcher returns to his son.

Max nods.

Fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts.

Max hesitates, then nods.

Max heads back to class. Fletcher picks up the cake, looks

at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY

A worried and preoccupied Fletcher is heading toward his

office building when a MACHO ATTORNEY passes by.

Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He

shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him

anyway.

Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him

resolutely.

A long moment, then --

And he runs off.   Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on.

INT. OFFICE'S - DAY

Fletcher drags himself past Greta's desk. Miranda gives

him the stink-eye. Fletcher doesn't see her.

He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.   She follows

him in, leaving his door open.

INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Fletcher collapses onto his couch. Greta enters.

INT. OUTER OFFICE

Miranda is 'eavesdropping.    A wicked gleam in her eye,

INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE

She thinks.

INT. OUTER OFFICE

Greta is emptying all her personal effects into boxes.

She's leaving. Fletcher is on the phone and looks very

harras,sed.

He wants to say "yes", but he can't.

Greta holds up a framed photograph.

She thrpws it in the trash and keeps packing.

The PHONE RINGS.

The phone won't stop ringing.       .'

The phone flies into the air. He catches it.

He pushes -two more buttons. Then SCREAMS.

He falls to his knees.

Greta stops.     She seems to consider.

She leaves.   Fletcher starts to give chase...

He runs directly into Miranda.

Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.

Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall.

She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into --

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The room is filled with ATTORNEYS, including MR. ALLAN,

the founder himself. Fletcher freezes.

An involuntary WHIMPER from Fletcher.

Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's

trying to hold it back, but--

DE AN SILENCE. Then --Mr. Allan bursts into raucous

LAUGHTER. He is joined by everyone except Miranda, who

looks on, STUNNED. Everyone pounds the table in hysterics.

Miranda is incensed.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Fletcher exits the conference, closes the door, breathes a

sigh of relief, then FAINTS.   .

INT. COURTROOM

CLOSE UP of Fletcher, seated alone at a table. His hands

are on his-face. He looks totally dazed. At the other

table, sit Dana Appleton and Mr. Cole.

They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits.

The doors OPEN and Virginia Cole enters with her CHILDREN

and a NANNY.

He collapses into his chair.

He begins to hyperventilate.     Virginia turns to Falk.

Falk hurries into the building as Fletcher hacks on.

Falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to Fletcher, who

downs it in one gulp -- then spews it out again, SCREAMING

in PAIN. -

Fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning

h is scalded mouth. The bailiff appears.

Fletcher's expression turns to terror.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The judge settles in. Mr. Allan and a smug Miranda look on

from the gallery.

Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation.    In a voice

quaking with fear...

Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children

sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny.

The judge BANGS the gavel.

Dana Appleton questions BRYSON, a private investigator.

Fletcher watches with mounting anxiety, NERVOUSLY DRINKS

from a GLASS OF WATER at his table.

He shows a photo - - o f a strapping hunk. Fletcher TAKES A

HUGE DRINK.           .

H e hands her the tape. Fletcher refills his glass.

The judge is startled by his candor.

As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously

DOWNS THE GLASS.

Periodically CUTTING to Virginia, Mr. Cole, Dan and the

thirsty Fletcher, we hear Virginia and her visitor engaged

in intense physical activity.

WE HEAR labored rhythmic breathing.

As Dana fast-forwards again, then resumes... with still

more labored breathing, building intensity and --

The groans reach their incredible climax. There's a still

moment. . .

As the shy COURT REPORTER, the macho BAILIFFS and the no-

nonsense judge all mop their brows, Dana shuts off the

tape. She turns to Fletcher with a satisfied smile.

Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his

water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak...

when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him.

After a momement, he grins.

Fletcher beams. Then necessity compels him to race out.

INT. REST ROOM - DAY

Fletcher stands before the urinal, taking the longest leak

i n legal history. Relief. Then, he looks at his watch.

It's only 4:15. '

He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea.

He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE

WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally

KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack.

A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.

The man looks disgusted. He carefully leaves the room.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The judge is PISSED. Suddenly the bailiff helps in the

severly beaten Fletcher. The entire courtroom is SHOCKED.

A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel.

Fletcher smiles serenly -- until --

Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid

answering, but he can't repress the truth.

Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.

EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY

Fletcher sits on the courthouse steps, miserable. PHONE

RINGS.

INTERCUT WITH MAX AT HOME. AUDREY IS THERE.

Max hangs up.

She smiles, but she's worried. .

COURTHOUSE STEPS

Virginia approaches with her handsome lover, LAURENCE FALK.

Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.

But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT.   The

others look concerned, but he waves them off.

To his horror, he GAGS AGAIN, .unable to form the word.

At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.

Fletcher shoots a hateful look at Miranda. She smiles.

Mr. Allan and Miranda head into the building, leaving

Fletcher more desperate than before.

X\

Falk looks shaken as Fletcher barrels on, unable to stop

A GASP from the audience. All eyes are on Fletcher.

A MURMUR erupts from the crowd.

Fletcher meekly shakes his head, no.

Virginia GRABS HIM BY THE TIE, pulls him CLOSE to her face.

Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia

said.

Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup

and her passport.

Silence.

Stunned, Virginia nervously makes her way up,

The Baliff stands before the witness.

Fletcher approaches,. CONFIDENT NOW, COCKY.

He grabs her purse from the desk, rifles through it,

One-twenty-six. I swear!

So on this single document,

you basically lied at every

opportunity. I'm sure a woman

as vain as you would also lie

about her age. It says you

were born in 1964. What's the

truth? 1962? '60? How young

did you try to make yourself?

Wrong! I didn't lie to make

myself younger. I made myself

older. I was born in 1965!"

What? You're trying to tell

us you lied to make yourself

older?

Yes! "  lied so I could get

married! So .there Mister 'I

GOT-ALL-THE-ANSWERS-BECAUSE-I-

went-to-law-school'!

Mr. Reid, does this have a

point?

Oh, you bet it does, your

Honor!

My client lied about her age

because she was only 17 when

s he got married. Which makes

h er a minor. And in the great

state of California, NO MINOR

CAN ENTER INTO A LEGAL

CONTRACT WITHOUT PARENTAL

CONSENT INCLUDING--

Prenuptual agreements.

A MURMUR OVERTAKES THE ROOM!

All is quiet while the Judge reviews the documents. Then:

The courtroom ERUPTS.       FLETCHER'S WON!      Dana, Mr. Cole are

devastated.                    '

Mr. Allan gives Fletcher a thumbs-up; simultaneously,

Miranda gives him the finger.

Fletcher freezes.

Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.

He BANGS THE GAVEL. Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's

attention is drawn to a commotion between Virginia and her

kids.

V,'

,-

Fletcher does feel strangely fantastic. Free,

COMMOTION in the court.   The judge BANGS HIS GAVEL!!!

The bailiff grabs Fletcher, forces him out...

Fletcher is pushed passed Mr. Allan.

look Audrey never wanted to see again. She makes a

decision.

outside the courthouse.

He continues walking.

The beggar continues on.

A moment as the beggar thinks, then:

He goes back inside. Fletcher starts to get up when a CAR

SCREECHES to a HALT, inches away.

It's PHILIP.

Fletcher runs up and HUGS the astonished man,

Fletcher KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS.

INT. PHILIP'S CAR - DAY

Philip's driving Fletcher.

A moment, then:

EXT. AIRPORT -- DAY

Philip's car skids to a stop.    Fletcher jumps out.

INT. LAX TERMINAL - DAY .

Fletcher races in.

He sees the DEPARTURE BOARD

Fletcher looks at the clock -- It's 7:46!!   Holy Shit!!

INT. LAX ESCALATOR

Fletcher pushes his way HE a crowded escalator. Past

people standing on the left despite the SIGN that says

STAND ON RIGHT.

At the top,- a WOMAN in a NURSES UNIFORM asks for money...

INT. LAX - SECURITY AREA

Fortunately, there's no line at the metal detector.

Fletcher races right by but SETS OFF THE ALARM.

Fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his Rolex

into a tray.

He tries again.     It BUZZES again!

A guy in a TURBAN passes over him with a DETECTOR WAND.

The wand BEEPS over Fletchers front pocket. He reaches in

and pulls out the now familiar BLUE PEN...

INT. LAX - DEPARTURE CONCOURSE

Fletcher races by Gate 15, 16, gets to 1 7 . . . but sees the

PLANE Slowly TAXIING AWAY.

Fletcher spots a door marked "NOT AN EXIT".    Goes for it

when a FLIGHT ATTENDANT interrupts.

The woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway. And

Fletcher BOLTS THROUGH THE EXIT!

EXT. TARMAC - DAY

He scurries down a flight of stairs calling after the plane

which is moving away.

No way he'll catch it.

Then, he sees a MECHANIC working on a MOBILE STAIRS UNIT

(These are the steps they pull up to planes) Fletcher gets

an insane idea. . .

The worker hears an ENGINE START, looks up to SEE FLETCHER

in the truck, driving off, TOWING THE STAIRS.

But Fletcher's gone.

EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Fletcher's DRIVING THE STAIRS trying to catch up with the

plane. GROUND WORKERS react.

Soon, the "stairs" are racing alongside the plane.

Fletcher looks for signs of Audrey and Max but he's too low

to see in the plane.

He grabs the TOOL BOX'on the passenger's seat,-puts it on

the accelerator, pinning it to the floor. Then, he CLIMBS

THE STEPS!

The "stairs" sway back and forth as he reaches the top.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY - MOVING

PASSENGERS calmly read while outside FLETCHER speeds along,

WAVING HIS ARMS like a maniac. The ENGINE NOISE drowns out

his call for...

A STEWARDESS stands in the aisle, giving the safety

lecture.

Her MOUTH DROPS as she notices Fletcher.

EXT. TARMAC - DAY

Fletcher is BANGING on the windows. People on the plane

POINT, STARE in amazement.

Fletcher looks ahead, SEES the stairs about to CRASH INTO

THE WING! Fletcher desperately fiddles with some controls.

At the last second, finds the one that LOWERS THE STAIRS.

He surfs under the wing...

...    and RAISES UP THE STAIRS at the other side.

Fletcher's at the front of the plane, where he finally

spots. . .

MAX, AUDREY AND JERRY SEATED IN THE BULKHEAD

Max has the window seat, Audrey arid Jerry are next to him.

Audrey has on her headset and Jerry is looking for his

seatbelt. NEITHER SEES FLETCHER.

Fletcher SCREAMS to get their attention. But it's TOO

NOISY.

Then, Fletcher looks ahead and his EYES GO WIDE!

FLETCHER'S POV

The RUNWAY is ENDING!.

Just then, Max looks up...SEES HIS DAD. Audrey is now

trying to help Jerry find his seat belt.

Audrey turns. Then she sees Fletcher WAVING weakly...

AT THAT INSTANT -- THE PLANE MAKES A SHARP TURN!

BUT THE STAIRS DON'T! They keeps going straight, heading

right for the END OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE

CART. . -

And BAM!   FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING!

Audrey strains to watch as FLETCHER lands hard ONTO A

MOUNTAIN OF BAGGAGE!

CLOSE ON FLETCHER

With all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's

in one piece, and then COLLAPSES IN DEFEAT.

INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT

Fletcher's BANGED UP pretty good. His head is BANDAGED.

He.puts a COLD COMPRESS to his BRUISED FOREHEAD and WINCES.

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Fletcher comes out LIMPING, totally dishevelled, missing a

shoe, and still holding the compress.

He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY

waiting for him just outside the door.

Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY.

He sees his dad, then quickly turns away.

Audrey's patience are growing thin...

This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher

said, but the way he said it.

She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced.

Fletcher turns to Jerry.

They both look to Audrey.

Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the

stairs. He's still upset.

Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,

TALKING LIKE THE TERMINATOR.

Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:

A moment as Max studies his father, then:

But Fletcher's looking at his watch...

Max steps away from Fletcher.

Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself

Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.

Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.

Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll

never let you go."

Fletcher smiles. . .

EXT. PARK - DAY

A beautiful park with a basball diamond. Fletcher is

seated on a bench, waiting. He's dressed in sweats, with a

baseball glove. Soon, Jerry, Audrey, and Max pull up...

Fletcher picks Max up.

Fletcher and Max do the TRANSFORMER ROUTINE again...

Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He

sees Audrey.

He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops

for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.

Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.

A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the

ball to Max.

Fletcher winds up in an EXAGERATED SUPER FAST MOTION, then

instantly shifts to SUPER SLOW MOTION. Max CRACKS UP.

Audrey LAUGHS. Jerry can't help but smile, too.

There may be better things in life... but at this moment,

it's hard to think of a single one. Honestly.
