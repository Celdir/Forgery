INT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The flicker of film.   Footage from a press conference.

Laughter.   A word:

INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHT

A huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a

man into the stage, turns on a working light.

SUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965

Departing, he closes the soundstage door.

As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of

light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard.

GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the

world. In front of him:

AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under

construction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its

unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins.

Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open

platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    A

lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane

surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands.

Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts

on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the

stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping

over to the crane.

Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his

mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in

every sense a jumble of ideas.

Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the

bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands,

overwhelmed.

THE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES

In the distance, a figure approaches out of the

darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An

escape from his tortured reality.

The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is

gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his

film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she

stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,

and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music

swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the

air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something

beautiful, transforms into the interior world of

GUIDO'S FANTASY.

As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly

appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the

women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from

his films, women he has loved, the sources of his

inspiration and creative genius.

A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women

in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own

powerful entrance:

LUISA, his wife

CARLA, his mistress

LILLI, his costume designer and accomplice

GUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit

STEPHANIE, a fashion journalist

SARAGHINA, a whore

A dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido

and he loses himself and his anxiety in their

collective embrace.

INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY

The fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE,

as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting

Guido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight

penetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,

discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures

approach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-

fed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime

associate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure

accompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an

accountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious

punctuation:

Guido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.

He takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight.

Guido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look

and a gesture asks Dante who is he?

They head outside.

EXT. CINECITTA - DAY

Guido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en

route to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large

poster of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a

failure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido

passes he causes a mild stir, and many people nod

deferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.

Neither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders.

They make their way to the Production Offices.

Everywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.

INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY

A long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio

heads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are

several, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without

missing a beat of their solemn conversation.

As they progress into and through the open plan office,

many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to

get Guido's attention, swelling the procession,

interjecting with their urgent requests.

There are set models everywhere, in the process of

being constructed, or painted.

JACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a

model, hurries over. Nobody stops moving.

As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to

look.

PIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the

procession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting

through them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a

partitioned office -

- into the main office -

Guido carries on moving through the office.

Now BENITO, Guido's Casting Director, moves towards

Guido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head

towards Guido's office.

Guido turns through another partition, as they all

besiege him with questions. Benito despairs.

Guido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the

door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him.

Dante blocks Benito.

INT. WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAY

Guido comes through the door, blows hard from the

barrage.

They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always,

for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is

Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky,

indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without

any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido

heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting

some fabric.

Dante comes in, closing the door behind him.

Guido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to

Lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.

He lies down.

Dante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some

drawings.

Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.

Lilli glances at Dante who has edged closer to the

table, he looks at the costumes.

Lilli glares at Dante, ushering him away.

Lilli is the only person who intimidates Dante. He

leaves. Guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket.

Lilli walks round and takes the tie off him. Guido sits

up. Lilli puts the tie round his neck.

She ties Guido's tie for him.

EXT. ROME - DAY

Guido is driving his Roadster   through the streets of

Rome. An Italian pop song of    the day is playing on the

radio as he speeds around the   Piazza del Poppolo. In

front of him in the convoy is   Dante with Fausto.

INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY

As Guido drives, he turns to see his MAMMA in the

passenger seat. He's not remotely surprised. She

appears the way he remembers her. Mamma is

extraordinary.

He stops at a busy intersection.

EXT. STREETS OF ROME / INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY

This is the Rome of La Dolce Vita, the Rome of Vespas,

skinny ties, cool sunglasses, impossibly cool young

people. A magnificent fall day, and the cafes are

stuffed with the beautiful and chic.

Guido is in his own world. The policeman raps on the

bonnet of the car. Guido startles and pulls off, alone

in the car.

Guido looks across as he drives. Mamma has gone.

EXT. HOTEL EXCELSIOR, VIA VENETO - DAY

The convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel

Excelsior on the Via Veneto.

As soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting

paparazzi snap his picture. Beautiful women look at

him. Guido moves quickly by them.

Dante and the team hurry after him.   Fausto tackles

Dante.

And they hurry after Guido.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

A big suite. About fifty reporters, men and women, are

in the room, and an array of microphones are on a

coffee table next to a long couch. Excited chaos. A

RADIO REPORTER narrates in the background.

A few news cameras are filming.    There's a buffet, and

a bartender.

And Guido comes into the room, shaking hands, patting

shoulders, grabbing a glass of champagne. Dante and the

team follow him in.

A stunning film poster is revealed -- Claudia Jenssen

emerging from the Colosseum: CLAUDIA JENSSEN. UN FILM

DI GUIDO CONTINI. ITALIA. Flashes. Excitement.

Pretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and

kisses Dante on the cheek.

He returns to the couch. All the reporters fire their

questions at once. The questions come on top of each

other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated

energy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to

DINARDO, a harsh-looking woman.

Another journalist, Leopardi, vile - sitting next to

her, egging Dinardo on - almost sniggers with contempt.

General laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is

clearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps

in.

He's still winning. Ignoring the question, he points

to STEPHANIE, a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes

from American Vogue.   Flirtatious and charming, she

wants him and he senses it.

Guido is spinning plates.

Laughter. Everyone starts firing questions at Guido

again. Another REPORTER asks a question.

FANTASY:

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

We discover Guido, alone on the soundstage of his

unfinished set. A retreat into surreality. He sits on

the same couch from the hotel suite. He slouches, arms

folded, legs crossed, with his hat pulled over his

eyes.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. DAY

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

This stops Guido. He doesn't answer. We see a bead of

sweat running down the back of Guido's neck.

Everyone waits.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

As the number progresses, Guido gets up from his chair

and begins to scale the enormous heights of his

unfinished set, with great effort.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

She smiles, he smiles back, lighting his cigarette.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

Guido turns to the mantle. He grabs a bottle of

whiskey, looks up into the large gilded mirror at his

reflection. We see two Guidos.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/INT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - DAY

Amidst the chaos, Guido notices a waiter with a tray of

glasses entering the suite through a hidden door in the

wall. As the waiter passes, Guido slyly opens the door

and sneaks out.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Guido continues climbing higher and higher.

INT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - DAY

Guido slips through the hallway, down the grand lobby

staircase, and escapes.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

As Guido reaches the pinnacle of his Everest-like set,

Guido's WOMEN appear on the different levels.

EXT. ROME - DAY

Guido speeds away from Rome in his Roadster.

EXT. ROME ROAD - DAY

Guido's car passes by the remnants of an ancient

aqueduct, with women from his fantasy draped around

him, spilling out of his car.

THE WOMEN sing a musical flourish of praise to Guido.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON

Now Guido and his women are in the countryside.

The car races over a hill, blurring the countryside,

and we see the blue Mediterranean sea, and the pretty

spa town of ANZIO.

EXT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

The Alfa Spyder comes to a screeching stop in front of

the gates of the entrance of an impressive looking Spa:

GRAND HOTEL BELLAVISTA. The hotel has a slightly faded

glamour, something that lifts it a little out of time.

Guido's women are gone as the song ends.

SUPERTITLE: Bellavista Spa Hotel, Anzio, Italy

INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

Guido enters like a thief. He doesn't want to be

recognised. He approaches the Front Desk, where an

immaculate Desk Clerk, the urbane and wise DE ROSSI,

waits to greet him.

A suite.

Yes.

With a view of the sea. A balcony.

Something with air.

All of our suites have air... let me

just look for you.

I've come from Milano.

I understand.

On business.    I'm a businessman. Busy

busy busy.

Would Maestro Contini prefer to

register under a pseudonym?

Please.

Signor Milano?

Why not.

Needless to say, I love your films.

Guilty pleasure. Those early films.

Not the flops.

I need to see a doctor. Do you know

one who's discreet...? I'd like to

see him today, in my room, now, if

possible.

Consider it done. Please.

Guido writes the number on a piece of paper on the

desk.

INT. TELEPHONE KIOSK, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

Guido heads into the elegant Art Deco booth, pulls the

glass door shut. The phone rings. He picks up.

INT. CONTINI HOME, ROME / TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY

We intercut between the phone booth and LUISA in their

apartment in Rome... Luisa knows every move of

Guido's. She manages him very well, calm, dry and

funny.

Are you by yourself?

Yes, of course I'm by myself.

Then shall I come?

Yes, please come, that's why I'm

calling, please come straight away.

That would be wonderful.

Okay.

Great. Marvellous.

I don't know where you are.

I don't know, some spa.   Horrible.   I

just kept driving.

Well I can't come if I don't know

where you are.

And, actually, it's hardly worth it.

I'll be home in a day or two.

Yes, it's hardly worth it.

But I do wish you were here.

Get some rest, take the waters, sleep,

then come back here and make a good

movie.

I love you.

Get better.

INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

He hangs up, pensive. Goes straight back to De Rossi

at the Front Desk, and scribbles down another number.

De Rossi understands.

INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

...CLOSE-UP on Guido's eye, being held open by a

DOCTOR. Guido is on the bed, shirt open. The Doctor

examines Guido's eye while a heavy-set NURSE takes his

blood pressure. The Doctor stands and turns to his

case.

He walks round to her. The Nurse whispers to the

Doctor. They look at the blood pressure gauge. Guido

is disturbed by their conspiracy.

The doctor, interrupting him, takes a tongue depressor

from his kit.

The doctor, sits on the bed beside Guido, and takes his

cigarette out of his mouth. He stubs it out.

THE PHONE RINGS. The doctor is in the way of the phone.

Guido desperately makes an attempt to reach it and

can't. He's trapped by the doctor and by the nurse

holding his arm.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

WE CUT TO A PAIR OF FULL BEAUTIFUL LIPS SINGING HIS

NAME.

Guido opens wide, gagging, as the phone continues

ringing. Guido looks at the ringing phone, but the

nurse has his arm in her grip as she takes his blood

pressure for the second time. And the phone continues

ringing.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

NOW WE CUT TO A SUGGESTIVE LOOK FROM A HEAVILY MADE UP

EYE.

Guido lunges for the ringing phone, with the blood

pressure cuff still on his arm, and picks it up. It is

CARLA, at the perfect wrong time.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"/INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

WE SEE ISOLATED IMAGES OF A SEDUCTIVE BODY: A LONG LEG

IN SHEER BLACK STOCKINGS, A SHAPELY ASS, MAGNIFICENT

BREASTS.

FANTASY:

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

An enormous swathe of pink satin rakes across the

scaffolding of Guido's unfinished set. Emerging from

the highest point is a pair of long legs sliding down

the lush fabric. She wears stockings, heels and little

else. Bathed in hot light, Carla reveals herself from

inside the sumptuous folds of satin.

INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

The Nurse, still taking his blood pressure and

listening to his pulse, is concerned about Guido's

vital signs.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Carla slides from the lush fabric onto a mirrored

platform. As she sings, she writhes and undulates in a

seductive display of sexuality. This is Guido's

ultimate fantasy.

INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

Guido trying to hide the effects of this phone sex from

the Doctor and Nurse.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Carla grabs onto two satin-covered ropes, suspended

from the ceiling. She wraps herself in them, swinging

and gyrating.

Carla disappears in a cloud of hot steam that becomes

the steam from an arriving train.

EXT. ANZIO, TRAIN STATION - DAY

And out of the steam... CARLA comes walking toward

Guido, swinging her hips, with a PORTER behind her,

pulling five bags on a wagon. Carla is dressed in her

own style, which is not chic, but it's what Guido

likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant. She

wears it with pride.

She gives him a hug and a kiss, both too much for him

in public.

She sees something in his face that worries her.

EXT. PENSIONE FERROVIA - DAY

A small pensione across the street from the station.

Carla sizes it up, and it's really not at all what she

was hoping for, but she doesn't say anything.

INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY

Later, Carla, in silhouette, from behind. Wrapped in a

sheet, she is looking out the window of the dingy room.

The light from the pensione's neon sign spills in. They

whisper.

Carla closes the curtains.     They continue to whisper.

Carla sits on the bed facing Guido.

She kisses him.

Guido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and

tilts the lamp shade up. He begins to pencil in a

beauty mark and darken her eyes. He is meticulous

about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it

exactly as he wants it.

Guido takes off his glasses and puts them on the side

table..

Carla gets up and takes Guido's glasses with her. Guido

turns out the light and settles into his pillow, for

the game. Carla looks at herself in the mirror.

Carla turns back to the mirror, she puts on Guido's

glasses and turns back to him.

Carla teases him with a look that says, "Why not?"

Carla goes into the hall and closes the door behind

her. We HEAR the MATRON who runs the Pensione talking

to her. While they talk, Guido removes a crucifix from

the wall and puts it in the bedside drawer.

Now Carla comes back into the room, giggling, signaling

for Guido to keep quiet.

She crosses the room and climbs onto the bed and opens

the sheet slowly, spreading her arms wide.

She throws herself on Guido, whose arms enfold her.

INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - LATER

Carla is asleep, her bare back a thing of post-coital

beauty. Guido sits on the edge of the bed, quietly

getting dressed, filled with confusion and guilt.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Guido tip-toes out of Carla's room, shoes in his hand.

He walks down the hallway, alone.

INT. HOTEL, GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

IMAGES OF CLAUDIA in his fantasy.   Kissing him.

Walking away...

Guido is surrounded by discarded bits of paper, an

outline of Italia. An empty sheet of paper sits in his

typewriter on his desk. He is not working on the

outline. He is sketching a voluptuous woman...

...he draws in the nipples on the woman's breasts.

Guido becomes discouraged. He tosses off his glasses

and runs his hands through his hair in frustration.

He's happily distracted by the sound of vehicles

arriving outside his window. He opens a slat in the

shutters, looks down as a motor calvacade draws up. At

its heart is an impressive luxury car.

EXT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA, POV FROM BALCONY - DAY

Hotel staff swarm around the vehicles which discharge a

procession of religious, including an ANCIENT CARDINAL

in scarlet robes and the CARDINAL'S SECRETARY. Priests

follow as the Cardinal heads inside the hotel.

Guido is intrigued, hurries out of his hotel room.

INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA LOBBY - DAY

As Guido hurries down the stairs, the Cardinal is being

helped into the elevator. The CARDINAL'S SECRETARY is

dealing with check-in formalities with De Rossi. Guido

calls to him.

He heads towards the elevator. Guido watches him go,

then a voice calls out his name....GUIDO! Guido can't

turn round. He knows that voice.

Guido hurries towards the elevator. The elevator doors

close. Guido is trapped.

He takes Guido by the arm and leads him to a stairwell.

INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA - STAIRCASE - DAY

INT. GRAND BALLROOM, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

Dante opens the door of the Ballroom to reveal a full

PRODUCTION OFFICE, ART DEPARTMENT, COSTUME DEPARTMENT,

CASTING OFFICE. The models, costumes, headshots,

everything all in place or being put into place. An

absolute beehive of activity. Guido is staggered.

He stands watching Guido with genuine admiration as he

sets to work with his team. Guido moves through the

room avoiding specific questions from everyone. As he

does so, Dante makes his way over to Guido with a

magnificent girl on his arm.

Pierpaolo, Guido's assistant, holds a telephone.   Guido

wants to know who it is.

Guido grimaces. Then takes the phone.   He attacks the

phone call with gusto.

He takes the cigarette with a smile, and then without

missing a beat starts barking at Pierpaolo.

He hands the phone to Dante, who's delighted to see

Guido back on good directing mode.

As Dante takes over, Guido walks away, heads towards

Lilli and her domain.

INT. LILLI'S TEMPORARY OFFICE, BALLROOM - DAY

Guido leaps over the balcony and lies down on a table.

Performance mode off. Lilli nods to Roberta to leave.

Roberta puts down her work and clears the room quietly,

leaving them alone.

Lilli is working at a mannequin, hand-sewing some

sequins on a costume. A red feathered boa is draped on

the figure.

Lilli points to the one in Guido's hand.

Guido sees the costume.

Lilli tosses the boa over her shoulder as she continues

pinning the costume.

Guido picks up a straw hat. Puts it on his head

playfully.

She produces one.

Guido looks into the faded ballroom mirror behind her

and sees...

FANTASY:

INT."SOUNDSTAGE"

...Lilli, draped atop an upright piano, the red

feathered boa hangs from her shoulders. She places the

same straw hat on her head.

The soundstage has been transformed into an

impressionistic version of the Folies Bergere of the

1930's, with Lilli as its French Star. A spotlight

finds Guido watching from the scaffolding of his

unfinished set. The din of the theater audience fills

the smoky atmosphere.

Behind a black scrim, ghostly images come to life.

Apparitions that reveal themselves as exotic SHOWGIRLS

barely covered in beads, sequins, and feathers. They

descend the grand staircase.

The showgirls disappear. Lilli comes down from the

piano and crosses onto the stage. The scrim rises.

From every corner, more showgirls begin to enter.

FOLIES BERGERE-               OOH LA LA

"ET PAS TROP CHER"

VIENS CE SOIR AVEC MOI

Lilli crosses onto the passerelle, and speaks directly

to the audience.

Lilli singles out guests at the lip of the stage:

Suddenly, she sees Young Guido in the audience.

And she brings him onto the stage. The audience

applauds. She addresses him as though he is Older

Guido.

The number kicks into full gear with a rousing can-can.

Young Guido finds himself swept into Lilli's

intoxicating world.

Lilli crosses the proscenium. Her boa grows and grows

until it stretches the length of the stage.

Lilli wraps her long boa around Young Guido. He and

Lilli are lifted onto an art deco swing, flanked by two

showgirls, that rises into the air. He is transported

and inspired.

INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT

We seem to be looking at the SET ON STAGE 5. But

suddenly a HUGE HEAD dips into the shot and it's Guido

contemplating a model of the set. He places a figure

on the top of the staircase.

He moves round to the front of the model and places

another figure on the top of the scaffold tower. He

knocks it over.

Unconvinced, he sits down on the sofa. The coffee

table is covered in head-shots. He finds the one of

Claudia.   Guido looks at it.

He lies back to write and finds himself in CLAUDIA'S

LAP. She hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his

hair. He starts to sign - "TO HIS EXCELLENCY.... "

then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself.

Claudia laughs.

INT. ANCIENT BATHS - DAY

Grottos and tunnels are thick with steam.    Guido

follows the Cardinal's Secretary.

The Cardinal's Secretary leads Guido to a private area,

where the Cardinal is already soaking in a large tub of

hot water.

The Cardinal's Secretary makes a gesture to Guido to

get into the tub with the Cardinal. Guido gets in the

water. The Cardinal looks hard at Guido and then makes

his first pronouncement.

The Cardinal's Secretary is shocked.

Guido's head disappears under the water.    The sound of

the Cardinal's voice trails away...

MEMORY:

EXT. BEACH - DAY

SUPERTITLE:   Pesaro, Italy, 1926

Young Guido, dressed in his school uniform, runs fast

across the rough dunes with five boys from the village.

The boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall

with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the

war.

They reach into pockets and extract small change, hand

it to Young Guido, already the ring leader.

They crawl through a small opening in the wall and

approach an abandoned bunker...

EXT. SARAGHINA'S BUNKER - DAY

...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker,

as the other boys fearfully take a step back.

Now all the boys join in.

A shadow moves inside the bunker. Now even Young Guido

takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps

back.

And then she comes out. SARAGHINA is a gritty, earthy

woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. She has

darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the

model for the whore makeup on Carla.

She looks at the boys. She may be a crazy whore, but

she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the

boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having

her own fun with them.

She takes a deliberate step. Young Guido stands his

ground. She takes another step and holds out her hand.

Young Guido opens his hand with the coins.

She looks at the money.   Is it enough?

But she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes

the coins.

She stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back

to her bunker. She returns dragging an old broken

chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready

for the "show."

Saraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands

and pours it over her body...

A dark vamp begins.

FANTASY:

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Curtains of falling sand fill the soundstage.

Through the sand, we see Saraghina seated on the same

chair from the beach. She speaks, surrounded by other

WHORES in provocative positions on beaten-up chairs.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

With a smile, she pulls her dress off her shoulders.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

She grabs her breasts.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

She undulates her body. The boys watch and cheer.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Saraghina gets up on the chair, lifts her skirt, and

begins to move her hips.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER       BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER,

PICK THE FLOWER NOW BEFORE    BEFORE IT'S PAST, BE

THE CHANCE IS PAST, BE        ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN.

ITALIAN BE ITALIAN

LIVE TODAY AS IF IT MAY

BECOME YOUR LAST!

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Saraghina drops to the ground and playfully writhes in

the sand. The boys are transfixed.

She gets up and heads towards the water.   The boys

follow, running.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Saraghina and The Whores brandish tambourines. They

begin a slow, rhythmic and sensual dance that builds

into a wild and raucous tarantella.

We furiously intercut between the musical fantasy and

the memory of the boys romping on the beach with

Saraghina, across the sand and through the water.

BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER,      BE A SINGER, BE A LOVER,

PICK THE FLOWER NOW BEFORE    BEFORE IT'S PAST.

THE CHANCE IS PAST.

BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN,         BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN.

LIVE TODAY AS IF IT MAY

BECOME YOUR LAST!

The whores dance.

The number ends.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Two PRIESTS are running down the beach, cassocks

flapping.

The boys run. Young Guido tries to run away from the

priests. They catch him and carry him away from the

beach.

INT. ST. SEBASTIAN CHAPEL - DAY

Off-screen, a boys choir sings KYRIE.

The priests drag Young Guido through the school's

chapel, past a tortured Christ hanging above the ornate

altar, into the Principal's office.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

Guido's mother is there with the PRINCIPAL (again, she

appears the way he remembers her).

The Principal produces a cane and starts to whip the

boy remorselessly. Mamma looks away. Young Guido cries

out as they punish him...

INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY

...and the cry is now in Guido's mouth, on top of Carla

in the spasm of sex... He suddenly can't breathe...

Carla is suddenly aware that he's not in ecstasy... He

rolls over, recovers slowly. As always, immediately

wanting to leave after the sex.

Guido shrugs the sheet off and sits up slowly. Carla

kneels up and hugs him, kissing his back.

Guido stands up and picks up his shirt. He puts it on

whilst they argue.

Guido heads towards the door, still dressing.

Disgusted with himself, he leaves.

INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT

Glittering lights on the terrace. A view of the sea.

A pop band and a dance floor.   A slick Italian MALE

SINGER performs QUANDO QUANDO QUANDO. People dance.

The whole PRODUCTION TEAM is at a working dinner.

Guido is at the end of the table, spilling ideas,

struggling, struggling to make sense of Italia -

She nudges him. He looks across the restaurant to see

his wife at the entrance looking for him...

He jumps up from the table and hurries towards the

dance floor, genuinely happy.

ON THE DANCE FLOOR:

from the dinner table.

He pulls her into the middle of the dance floor.    They

start to dance.

They move together, enjoying each other.   She kisses

him.

They walk towards the table.

AT THE TABLE:

She leans across to kiss Lilli.

He sits Luisa down, goes to grab a bottle of champagne.

Luisa says hello to the rest of the gang, there are

kisses, etc. as Guido returns and pops open the bottle

of champagne.

Just then, the Cardinal's Secretary appears.   Heads

towards the table.

Music begins.

Luisa looks to Guido.   Close up on Guido.

FANTASY:

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

The restaurant table as well as the production team are

transplanted onto Guido's unfinished set. They are

surrounded by camera equipment, standing lighting

units, etc. Luisa rises from her chair, distancing

herself from the scene. The other characters, with the

exception of Guido, freeze in a dimly lit macabre

tableau.

Luisa contemplates her life with Guido.

As the number progresses, the world around Luisa

disappears into a black void, leaving only herself,

with Guido in the shadows. Luisa climbs the staircase.

MEMORY:

INT. INSERT STAGE - DAY

Luisa's screen test for Guido. A work print in

scratched black and white. The music continues.

The clapper board. TITLE: IL VICOLO (The Alley)    Her

name: LUISA ACARI.

A small set. A couple of tables and chairs, as if it's

an outdoor cafe in Piazza Navona.   Luisa enters,

younger, she's like Audrey Hepburn...

Luisa sits on the chair.

Guido enters.   He's fascinated by her. She's taken

aback that he's in front of the camera and approaching

her. He walks straight up to her and unties her hair.

It's oddly intimate. He stands back to reappraise her.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Luisa is now at the top of the staircase. She looks at

Guido from a greater distance and descends the stairs.

INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

In reality, Luisa sees Carla enter the restaurant.

They look at each other. Carla tries to change

direction, or look as if she's come to the wrong place.

...Luisa gets up abruptly.

She hurries away. Guido senses something terrible is

happening. He gets up and goes after his wife.

EXT. STEPS, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT

Guido catches up to Luisa as she storms up the steps.

She walks away up the steps. Guido can only guess at

what's happened. He heads back to the terrace

restaurant...

INT. TERRACE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Guido comes back inside. Carla is seated at a table.

She sees him and calls for him.

Raging, he grabs her and frogmarches her out the door.

INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT

Guido pulls Carla through the lobby. She's humiliated.

He walks over to the front desk, to the ubiquitous De

Rossi.

Guido goes back to the suddenly vulnerable Carla.

He disappears. Carla walks towards the door, conscious

of De Rossi. She's humiliated. De Rossi comes out

from behind his desk, approaches her.

She walks away.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Carla walks along the road in the dark, stumbling

along.

INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT

Guido enters. The two single beds. Luisa is apparently

asleep in hers. Guido sits on his bed. Glum.

Luisa doesn't move.

Luisa turns on her bedside lamp and sits up in bed.

Luisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly.

Luisa turns over, reaches to the bedside lamp and turns

it off. Guido gets up and hurries from the room.

INT. BAR, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - NIGHT

Guido enters the bar, goes up to the bartender.

A voice comes from behind him.

Guido looks around, it's the Vogue Journalist from the

Press Conference. Stephanie grins at him, infectious,

full of flirt.

Guido takes a cigarette. The drinks appear.    Guido

produces some money.

Stephanie crosses her legs. Guido looks down and sees

her grey patent leather boot moving in time to the

beat.

A RHYTHM BEGINS.

FLASH: A SUDDEN HEAD TURN OF A MAN IN SHADES.

FLASH: A SUDDEN IMAGE OF MEN IN STYLISH SUITS.

FLASH: A SUDDEN IMAGE OF A WOMAN'S HIP THRUST.

FANTASY:

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

The tiered levels of the unfinished set are covered

with go-go girls in silver miniskirts. At the center

of the stage, Italian male models in stylish suits and

Ray Bans strut down a fashion runway.

Stephanie makes her entrance on the catwalk.

INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Guido lights Stephanie's cigarette.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Guido and Stephanie share a laugh as she steals a sip

from Guido's glass.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Stephanie leads the men in a series of tight, rhythmic

moves.

INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Stephanie rubs her leg against Guido's.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Stephanie whispers into Guido's ear, as she drops her

room key into his pocket. He watches her hips swing as

she walks out. Guido plays with her room key, deciding

whether or not to follow.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

A long line of chic women replace the men on the

runway, joining Stephanie.

DRUM BREAK.   The number heats up.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Guido exits the elevator, weary and ripe with self-

disgust, and walks down the hallway to Stephanie's

door.

Guido pushes open the door and drops her key in a bowl.

He walks tentatively into the room and sits on her bed.

The dressing room door is deliberately ajar.

Guido catches a glimpse of Stephanie undressing in a

mirror.

Suddenly,   Guido is sharing the runway with Stephanie,

the go-go   dancers, and the male models, soaking up the

adoration   as his idol-worshipping audience cheers and

paparazzi   flash. It's a party. Champagne Popping.

Flowing.

Everyone is chanting Guido's name.     Guido and Stephanie

exit the runway, arm and arm...

INT. STEPHANIE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Guido feels consumed with self-loathing.

He gets up from the bed and bolts from the room...

INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT

...Guido enters his own suite. He sits down on Luisa's

bed, curls round her and kisses her neck. Determined

to commit to Luisa.

After a moment she turns to him, her own hand seeks

his.

The PHONE RINGS, shockingly loud. He kisses Luisa,

then grabs the phone to silence it.

EXT. PENSIONE FERROVIA - NIGHT

Guido arrives at the Pensione.   The Matron is waiting

at the door. Distressed.

INT. PENSIONE FERROVIA - NIGHT

As they walk down the hall -

The Matron nods.

INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Guido goes in with the Matron to find her DAUGHTER

pressing a cold compress onto Carla's head as she lies,

feverish in the bed. DOCTOR RONDI is packing up his

things.

Doctor Rondi is brisk.   He nods to Guido that they go

outside.

As Guido makes to leave -

Guido reassures her with a gesture.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Guido and Doctor Rondi come out. Guido is concerned.

Doctor Rondi writes out a prescription as he talks.

Guido doesn't fight. Rondi hands him the prescription,

picks up his bag, turns and walks away, leaving Guido

leaning against the wall...

MEMORY:

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Young Guido, alone and dressed in his school uniform,

runs fast across the rough dunes.

INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

... the door knob turns. Guido comes back into the

room, indicates to the Matron and her daughter that

they should leave.

He sits on the side of the bed and puts his hand over

hers.

This comes out with enormous tenderness, as if she

suddenly understands herself.

Guido hears her.    Knows what she's saying is true.   She

looks at him.

He stands and pulls a sheet up over her.

Guido lies down next to her, she turns to face him.

FANTASY:

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

...Young Guido is scaling the unfinished set, as Mamma

circles him from below. Hundreds of candles fill the

darkness.

Mamma intercepts Young Guido as he jumps down from the

spiral staircase and she swings him into her arms. She

sings playfully.

INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Guido attempts to comfort Carla.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Mamma guides Young Guido through an allee of candles.

She gently spins Young Guido, and - as he completes the

turn - he is replaced by Older Guido. Mamma now waltzes

with her adult son.

Mamma caresses Guido's face.   Guido pulls away.

Older Guido watches, as Mamma takes Young Guido up the

grand staircase.

Mamma sits on the steps with Young Guido.     He rests his

head in her lap.

Older Guido walks past them up the staircase.

He disappears into darkness.

INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY

Guido wakes. It's morning.

Carla looks very fragile as the first rays of sun touch

the room. Him, too. He rubs his face, hears voices.

He gets up, goes out to investigate.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY

Carla's husband, LUIGI, is talking with Matron on the

landing.

Guido straightens himself up, approaches, as Matron

retreats to leave them alone. LUIGI is a nice,

dignified man. He's very anxious. He and Guido can't

really look at each other.

She leaves.

He walks into the room. Guido stands outside for a

second, then turns to go.

INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY

The door is open as Guido enters. He's confused,

worried that Luisa has gone, perhaps. But then he sees

a figure moving about in the dressing room, emptying a

closet.

Dante appears, stuffing Guido's things into a suitcase.

Dante walks over to the door with the suitcase, passing

Fausto. A Bellboy and a luggage cart stand in the hall.

EXT. GATES OF CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON

Guido's Roadster approaches the gates. There are

PAPARAZZI gathered for the arrival of Claudia, for the

beginning of filming. They drive through, solemn faced,

ignoring the press.

EXT. CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON

The whole energy of this return to Cinecitta is hectic,

people wanting to work, equipment waiting to work,

everybody and everything needing Guido's attention.

Guido drives towards the stages. Guido feels the

pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a

movie that doesn't exist.

Guido is trying not to panic. He feels as if he's just

arrived in prison camp. He drives fast and straight to

Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are

immediately swamped. Pierpaolo has a hundred requests

for Guido...

Dante marches Guido towards the stage. Lilli joins

them.

Lilli peels off and joins her assistant Roberta at a

rack of costumes.

INT. INSERT STAGE, CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON

A couple of huge cameras are being prepared, some

lights are being flown up into the grid, the LOADER is

preparing the Clapper Board. The Loader has created a

slate: ITALIA, CLAUDIA JENSSEN, HAIR AND MAKEUP TESTS.

The gang enters. Guido says a brisk hello to the crew,

then leaves the set quickly. Finds the studio

telephone behind the flats. He dials.

Guido waits. Luisa picks up the phone.

INT. INSERT STAGE/CONTINI HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

INTERCUT, LUISA at home, listening, inscrutable.

Luisa listens. Pierpaolo appears again, always the

same, needs him to start.

Guido nods, waves him away.

Luisa puts down the phone.

Guido is in a mess.

INT. INSERT STAGE - EARLY EVENING

Guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly

there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and

some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only,

followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around

her. As the others walk towards a holding area with

costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman,

who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light,

her home, and stands there waiting for Guido.

She looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a

Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches

Claudia.

Pierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director.

Guido gets behind the camera and films Claudia's test.

Makeup artists and costume assistants immediately

surround her, loosening her hair.

Dante is thrilled. Fausto is also mesmerised.    She's a

star, that's the long and short of it.

And she's warming up for a fight with her director.

Another litany of jibes, half-joking, but dangerous.

Lilli comes forward, puts a chinchilla fur coat on

Claudia, adjusts her hair.

Guido adores her, her spirit, her feistiness.

Guido races after Claudia, taking the chinchilla coat

from Lilli with him. Opportunity for escape.

EXT. CINECITTA - NIGHT

Guido drives Claudia towards the gates, which swing

open. The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car,

flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a

picture of the Star driving away with her Director.

Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from

Guido. They drive away, and are immediately followed

by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas

and little cars.

INT. CAR, ROME OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

Guido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse

following.   Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her

in the car, she's such a class act. He's always

inspired. He's driving fast but distracted by her.

Guido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the

traffic. So do the posse, but as the road opens up,

they can't keep up with him and he manages to overtake

a car, they speed after him.

EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT

Guido stops the car by some narrow streets in the

Trastevere, just south of the Vatican. They watch the

photographers hurtle past in search of them.

They sit for a second.

Guido is exasperated.

Claudia listens. She's always seduced by the way he

speaks, his passion. They fall in love with each other

in every movie, that's the way of it. Guido lights a

cigarette.

Guido has no confidence in what he's saying anymore.

They get out of the car and begin to walk away.    It's

almost deserted here.

She grabs his hat, puts it on her head.     Saunters down

the road. He follows.

FANTASY:

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT

EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Claudia heads towards a little Piazza with an ancient

fountain in the centre of the square. The Piazza is

empty except for a few cars parked where the entrances

have been blocked off. Claudia steps up onto the

fountain.

Guido sits down at the edge of the fountain.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Claudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves

closer to Guido. The music continues.

She takes off her wig and diamond earrings.

She hands him the wig and the earrings.    She kisses

him.

The music ends.   Claudia turns and walks away.

INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT

A screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting

down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the

screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup

test. People start to comment, all enthusiastically.

Guido gets a cigarette off Pierpaolo and lights up.

Guido watches, sitting alone, he turns around as he

sees someone come in the door, but it's Gianluca, not

Luisa.

The reel finishes. The lights come up, to excited

chatter, he looks at Lilli a row or two behind him, she

shrugs sympathetically.

The room goes dark, the next reel begins.      Guido turns

back to look at the screen.

During the reel, Dante is very decisive... shouts out,

as the women appear.

They come on, one after the other, say their names.

Guido gives them things to do.   Pick up the phone and

argue with your lover. No, make him laugh. Make him

want you.   Walk towards the camera as if you were

frightened. As if you were angry. ON ELEANORA - very

angry on the phone:

Next actress: ILARIA. Someone comes in the door.

Guido turns and sees it's Luisa, sitting next to Lilli.

She's come. He turns back to the screen.

Another actress appears. It's Donatella. Very

nervous. She says her name. Guido instructs her.     She

tries the phone, the walks. She's not a natural.

Luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation. She

looks at Guido. A little smile. He feels it like

sunshine. He turns back to the screen.

Another girl: ALESSIA. Very striking. Keeps looking

out past the camera, getting sotto voce instructions

from Guido. Her hair is in a chignon. She begins her

improv, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in

front of the camera. Approaches her, and undoes the

chignon, freeing her hair. She's beautiful and

innocent. Guido says something to her, a whisper. But

what he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes,

goes like a dagger to Luisa.

As the reel finishes... and the lights come up.

The screening room empties, a lot of mutual

congratulations on good work, especially to Lilli, and

a hug or a handshake from almost everybody for Luisa.

Lilli kisses her, leaves. Just the two of them now,

husband and wife, several rows apart in the empty

screening room.

FANTASY:

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

THE BEAT OF A STRIPPER'S DRUM.

A gloved hand emerges from behind a beaded curtain,

beckoning. The curtain opens, revealing the silhouette

of a figure bathed in red light.

Guido sits in an audience of raucous men who have

filled all the seats around him. They start to whistle

as if they were at some sleazy club. Guido squirms,

trapped.

The figure steps forward. It's Luisa, tricked out like

a seedy nightclub stripper.

INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

Luisa strips.

INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT

He stands up, leans on the chair back.

Guido stands up straight.

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

As the strip becomes more raw, Luisa defiantly exposes

her body and her contempt for Guido. Guido watches,

humiliated.

Instrumental.

Luisa charges into the audience: she is mauled and

assaulted by the men.

INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT

Luisa gets up from her chair, heads to the exit door.

Luisa leaves.   Guido is left alone.

The room goes dark as the screen tests, on a loop,

start up again.

Guido walks into the flickering light of the

projector...

INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"

...He sits silhouetted by the harsh white beams.

Guido stands and walks towards the image on the screen.

He violently rips the screen to the ground.

Guido collapses to his knees.

Suddenly, his mother appears.

In Guido's face, a soulful recognition that what she's

said is true.

INT. CINECITTA, STAGE 5 - DAY

A HUGE CRASH...

...A large piece of Guido's set comes crashing down.

Dante and Guido walk through the empty soundstage,

leaving behind the set which is being dismantled by a

group of construction workers.

INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY

REALITY. Guido faces his production team.      This is

hard for him.

There is silence in the room.

EXT. CINECITTA, STAGE 5 - DAY

The metal soundstage door opens as Guido and Dante walk

through and into the sunlight. Guido is defeated. He

stops at his car and turns to Dante. Guido gets in his

car. Guido drives away. Dante watches him go.

EXT. BEACH - ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON

A cold wind blows.   A lonely figure (GUIDO) walks along

a deserted beach.

SUPERTITLE:   Anguillara, Italy, 2 years later

EXT. BEACH CAFE, ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON

It's the end of the season. Only a few customers left

in the cafe, as the waiters close up for the day,

pulling down umbrellas, stacking tables.

Guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt.

Haggard. He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves

crash to and fro. A newspaper sits open in front of

him. Scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a

theater production in Rome. Guido gets up at this

moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper,

folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant.

He heads up the steps towards the promenade and we

catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes -

EXT. ROME, THEATER - NIGHT

Guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street

from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play,

DIANA E LA TUDA, starring LUISA ACARI.

Luisa exits the theatre with the company of actors, all

of them plaited together in post-performance bonhomie.

Guido watches from a distance.

Luisa takes the arm of a handsome male, as they cross

and head down the street.

EXT. ANGUILLARA STREETS - DAY

Guido and Lilli walk along the waterfront.   People pass

by occasionally. They talk -

He sits.   Lilli joins him.

She indicates the people who pass.

FLASH: Lights from a makeup mirror. A glimpse of a

female eye applying false eyelashes.

FLASH: A man of the collar applies pancake makeup,

while a cigarette dangles from his lips.

Young Guido, 9, appears and whispers into Guido's ear.

INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS

A surreal backstage, the cast of Guido's life, whores,

models, schoolboys, priests, etc. A show about to

begin.

The music of "Be Italian/Folies Bergere" plays and

builds throughout.

People run past with props, lights, etc.    Showgirls are

hurrying. A beautiful confusion.

EXT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY

Guido pulls up in his car outside the soundstage. He

stops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence.

Summoning his courage, he gets out of the car. He is

greeted by Pierpaolo. He seems to need and acknowledge

his support. Pierpaolo is tender.

INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS

The camera moves through the backstage mayhem.

Mamma is in her dressing room preparing. Saraghina is

sharing a dressing room with a Priest. He is helping

with her corset. Carla and Luigi. Carla fixes her

husband's hair. Claudia and Stephanie smoke and talk.

Lilli adjusts her own, and other men's wardrobe.

INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY

Guido is in his element again, locked in passionate

discussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand,

an actual script. The set surrounding them is modest;

a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets.

The vast film Italia has clearly given way to something

smaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a

woman.

INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS

Young Guido rushes by the dressing rooms.

The dressing rooms begin to empty.

INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY

From high above on the soundstage catwalk, Young Guido

watches Older Guido at work.

On cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him and

ushers in THE CAST OF GUIDO'S LIFE. They enter with a

sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange

themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom

behind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white.

But Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task

that lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts down

his script. He takes off his jacket and hangs his

glasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set

in front of him.

A LONG WIDE PAN reveals a tableau vivant looming behind

Guido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every

inspiration. They watch him as he begins to work. A

part of him now and forever.

Guido sits on the crane.

The soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure

slip quietly onto the set. Tentatively, she steps

through the shadows. It's Luisa. From a discreet

distance, she watches her husband return to his gift.

Pierpaolo calls for silence.

CLOSE UP ON THE CLAPBOARD.   WORKING TITLE: NINE.   DIR:

G. CONTINI.

As the clapboard strikes.

At the last moment, Young Guido runs fast, down the

maze of steps, across the soundstage and jumps onto the

crane with Guido as it begins to rise. Luisa watches.

As the last note plays, the crane soars higher,

carrying Guido up and up.

CUT TO BLACK.
