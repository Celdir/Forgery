They plant themselves next to the piano, Lonnie intently

watching the long fingers work the keys- we TILT to see

TYRONE `Pinetop' Purvis, proprietor and piano player, in his

50's. He acts as if the boys aren't there, concentrating on

the music. We SHIFT to include Bertha Mae as she wraps up

the song-

SLICK, a pretty, sharply-dressed man in his late 40's at the

bar, and MACEO, who sits at a table near the bandstand

smiling throughout, APPLAUD. The sound makes the room seem

more empty.

Ty stands, nods to METALMOUTH SIMS, a slight, worried-looking

harmonica player who sits behind Bertha Mae-

As Ty crosses to the bar we hear RECORDED MUSIC booming from

outside-

Metalmouth launches into a HARMONICA INTRO. Ty pauses at the

counter next to Slick, who is attentively watching Bertha Mae-

Maceo arrives to join them, interrupting-

China Doll brings Ty a glass of whiskey.    He gives her a sad

smile-

We FOLLOW as Ty crosses to the door-

Ty looks out the door at-

POV - EXT. ACE OF SPADES CLUB

-the RED-lit ACE OF SPADES CLUB across the road, PEOPLE

hanging out in front, LAUGHTER heard from within-

HONEYDRIPPER

Ty reacts.    Behind him, Maceo indicates the near-empty room-

STOKELY, a bitter drunk who holds on to the end of the bar,

calls out to them-

Slick tenses, used to this-

Stokely almost chokes with laughter-

Slick starts to rise but Maceo puts a hand on his arm-

They all turn to see DELILAH, Ty's wife, coming out from the

back of the club. She is dressed for church-

Lonnie and Scratch, busted, hurry out.   Delilah turns her

attention to China Doll-

China Doll mopes as she steps out from behind-

Maceo gets behind the counter as Delilah heads for Ty at the

door-

Maceo reluctantly moves down to take the order of NADINE, a

large, handsome woman with a prominent gold tooth who has

just stepped in-

Maceo tries to slip the hook and be polite at the same time-

DOORWAY

Ty watches the CROWD in front of the Ace of Spades.   Delilah

comes up to join him, indicates his drink-

He looks at his wife-

Delilah surveys the room-

STOKELY

Stokely has to use two hands to keeps his glass steady as he

drinks-

TY AND DELILAH

Delilah shakes her head and heads out the door-

STAGE

Bertha Mae is singing straight to Slick now, as Metalmouth

backs her up on the harmonica-

Only Slick applauds-

Bertha Mae, a little unsteady, holds onto Slick's arm as he

helps her off the stage-

Bertha Mae looks to Ty as he steps back in-

She stops dead.   Stares at him till he has to let it out-

9   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT                                     9

10   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT                                   10

Sheriff Pugh looks around the near-empty club-

Ty has played this game before, trying to hold his ground

without pissing off the white man with the badge-

Pugh sniffs the air-

Ty doesn't respond. Sheriff Pugh stops right next to

Stokely, giving him a dead-pan stare as he speaks. Stokely

won't meet his eyes-

He turns his attention to Tyrone-

It gets very quiet, the HISS of the KEROSENE LANTERN growing

tense and insistent.

China Doll looks from Sheriff Pugh to Ty's face, searching

for a flicker of evidence. Ty stays deadpan-

The Sheriff steps to put his face very close to Ty's, an edge

of menace in his voice when he speaks softly-

Ty holds Pugh's eyes for an agonizingly long moment, then the

sheriff turns and heads for the door-

They all wait for him to clear the door before they exhale.

Maceo snatches the whiskey bottle from Stokely-

11   EXT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                              11

12   EXT. RAILROAD STATION - NIGHT                                12

SONNY BLAKE, 20's, rumpled from hard travelling.   He carries

a GUITAR CASE and something bulky in a SACK-

SHACK THOMAS, an older man in a PULLMAN PORTER'S UNIFORM

stands under the moth-addled light on the tiny STATION

PLATFORM, watching Sonny-

Sonny reaches Shack at the platform-

Sonny looks at the shed, unenthusiastic-

13   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - LATE NIGHT - CU MONEY                    13

Ty frowns, reaches under the counter and brings up a POSTER.

He spreads it out on the counter top. It reads-

Ty turns to look for the right spot to fix the poster-

14   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/1ST COTTON FIELD - EARLY MORNING           14

One of the other men, HAM, looks him over. Dex is little and

combative and has a nasty-looking SCAR on his face. Ham is

big and morose, with a deep, grumpy voice-

A few snickers-

JUNEBUG, a local man with a nervous air, jumps in-

More snickers and the truck stops at the side of a COTTON

FIELD. Somebody lets the tailgate down and they begin to

climb off-

The pickers unroll the sacks they pick up from the pile

that's been left and begin to spread out at the base of the

unpicked rows-

Dex turns to face the much larger Ham-

The two men stare at each other for a long moment. Way too

early to fight. Dex breaks eye contact and moves toward a

row-

He nods toward Dex's row-

Dex's gaze falls upon a tall, strong-looking young woman

starting down the row next to his-

She gives him a weary look-

15   EXT. TOWN - TRAIN TRACKS - EARLY MORNING                     15

16   EXT. MAIN STREET - GENERAL STORE - EARLY MORNING             16

Sonny surveys the street-

Possum finishes his song-

Possum gently nudges Sonny's case with his toe.   Sonny is

surprised at the blind man's perception-

17   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING - TY                          17

SIDE OF ROADHOUSE, MACEO

Maceo wrestles with the jury-rigged WIRES that run out from

the battered, rusting POWER BOX-

FRONT OF ROADHOUSE

China Doll has stepped out from the club-

Maceo comes around from the side-

Maceo makes a face-

18   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING                                  18

She cook for him, fixed him up all

kinds of nice new clothes, kept him

in gin and poker chips-

Don't see no problem with that.

Well, come four, five months, a man

starts to- sorry, China Doll, but

this just the way it is- a man gots

needs.

Nadine look like she can take care

of those, too-

You eat chicken every morning, noon

and night for five months, you get

a taste for some different kind of

meat, right? (looks to China Doll)

Maybe I shouldn't be-

Aint gonna tell me something I

haven't heard worse.

Well, Nappy goes out and has him a-

a porkchop or two, let's say- and

he comes back from Toussaint's one

night feeling no pain, smelling

like- like porkchops- the way a

man will- and he falls out on

Nadine's couch and commences to

snore. Wake up the next mornin,

finds she had took all his clothes

off without him knowin it-

Man was dog drunk-

Miss Nadine come in with a skillet

in her hand, hot grits bubbling in

it, says "Baby, I got your

breakfast." "Not this morning,

Nadine," he says, sittin up, "don't

think I could eat a thing." "Well

then," she says, "we can't let this

go to waste, can we?" and she dump

that whole hot bubblin mess right

in the man's lap.

They are all quiet for a moment, contemplating-

They turn to see Sonny standing in the doorway-

Ty's eyes fix on Sonny's face for a moment- something

familiar there- then go down to the guitar case at his feet-

Ty indicates the Guitar Sam POSTER hanging behind the bar-

Sonny looks a little shaky-

Ty gives him a once-over-

Sonny has to think-

Sonny pulls his hat off as he follows China Doll, who is

suddenly quiet and self-conscious, back to the kitchen-

Ty grows somber, reminiscing-

They turn to see COOL BREEZE, a hard-looking, sharply-dressed

character, leading the prosperous looking MR. SIMMONS into

the club as if they aren't there-

Ty stands-

A frozen moment.    Then Maceo stands as well, backing up his

friend.

Cool Breeze puts one foot up on the chair next to Ty, licks a

finger and dabs at his shoeshine with it-

He nods toward Mr. Simmons-

Cool Breeze takes his foot down and gets up in Ty's face. He

lets his jacket fall open so the butt of his .44 PISTOL is

visible-

Cool Breeze doesn't take his eyes off Ty's-

Cool Breeze grins, still locking eyeballs with Ty-

Cool Breeze breaks eye contact, strolls out, followed by

Simmons-

Ty and Maceo wait till the men are gone before they speak-

An awkward pause.   Both men are shaken.   Ty sits back down to

think-

19   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING                                 19

Zeke only has to look at the loader, who starts to put the

cases back onto the truck-

Zeke walks toward the cab of the truck, Ty following him,

desperate, waving the poster-

Zeke steps in and slams the door, the loader doing the same

on the other side of him-

The truck engine coughs-

But the truck is gone down the road.   Maceo comes up beside

Ty, watching forlornly-

Another TRUCK pulls around the bend from the opposite

direction-

The new truck slows to a stop by them.    The DRIVER pokes his

head out-

Maceo bites his tongue.   Ty plays it through-

Ty glances over to the Ace of Spades, then points behind the

Honeydripper-

20   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - KITCHEN - MORNING                         20

He sits back and looks her over-

Ty sticks his head in, Maceo behind him with a case of liquor

in his arms-

21   INT. MAYOR WINSHIP'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING            21

22   EXT. MAIN STREET - GENERAL STORE - MORNING                  22

Maceo and China Doll cut around toward the back of the store.

We TIGHTEN on Ty as he unrolls the posters he carries, looks

across the street for another likely place to hang one-

Ty turns-   how did Possum get there, chair and all?

Ty frowns at the lyrics-

Possum keeps playing but stops singing-

23   EXT. REAR OF GENERAL STORE - MORNING                        23

Shack looks to see Ty joining the others-

He gives China Doll a hug and kiss-

Ty starts in through the back entrance of the store-

24   INT. GENERAL STORE - MORNING                              24

33   INT. MAYOR WINFIELD'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY             33

Delilah nods.   Amanda takes a drink-

Amanda realizes she has probed too deep, tries to back up-

Delilah considers, struggling to express who Ty is-

Delilah turns away, embarrassed to have revealed so much-

She crosses to look out a window-

She catches herself, smiles-

She fades away again, empties her glass-

She frowns at the memory, sighs-

Amanda is up and out of the room.   Delilah frowns at the

decanter, hurries to put it away.

Amanda comes back in holding a DRESS for a young girl-

Delilah examines the dress, which is clearly for a little

girl-

She sits, still holding the dress, sneaks a look over to

where the wine decanter was-

An awkward silence that Perry Como fills inadequately. A

KNOCK at the back door, then China Doll steps in, not seeing

Amanda right away-

Delilah shifts her eyes to indicate-

34   INT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM                            34

35   EXT. 1ST COTTON FIELD - AFTERNOON                            35

Sonny widens his stance-

Sonny digs in and keeps low-

Ned cackles-

A DEPUTY calls out-

36   EXT. 1ST OPPOSITE COTTON FIELD                            36

Dex laughs and starts to deal a card at a time to the players-

Dex raises his voice so the woman he checked out in the

morning can hear-

He calls to where Ham stands in knee-high grass, a heavy

stick in his hand, staring intently at the ground-

He raises a matchstick in his fingers-

Dex stops dealing to stare at Ham, insulted-

There is a sudden RUSTLING at Ham's feet and WHAP! he brings

his stick down hard. He pulls up a RABBIT, dead, by its hind

legs-

Dex snorts, disgusted, then finishes dealing. He lays the

top card face up and slaps down the rest of the deck-

We hear a CAR APPROACHING, SLOWING DOWN-

They turn to see Maceo leaning out of the window of Ty's old

Ford, a Guitar Slim POSTER taped to the side of it-

37   EXT. PURVIS HOUSE - NIGHT                                    37

38   INT. PURVIS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                          38

Delilah proceeds cautiously-

Delilah tries to ignore this-

Delilah gives up, knowing he's set on his mood-

A strained silence.   Delilah crosses to the back door-

She gives Ty a lost look, steps out.   The screen door slams.

China Doll sees how worried Ty is-

39   EXT. REVIVAL TENT - NIGHT - WIDE SHOT                      39

He gets an `Amen!' from someone in the crowd-

The congregation start to get into it, RESPONDING, rocking

with the rhythm of the sermon, flapping their PAPER FANS that

advertise Beauchamp's Funeral Home in the hot night--

The Reverend picks up speed-

40   INT. JAIL - NIGHT                                           40

Sonny is in a big COMMON CELL with the other conscripted

LABOR GANG. He hangs on the bars as behind him men pitch

pennies, while Ned and another veteran jailbird, KING,

compare lodging experiences-

Sonny begins to SING softly, almost to himself-

The men join him on the chorus-

Sonny turns to face them-

51   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - DAY                                       51

Ty pauses on the keyboard-

They both go back to brooding.   Ty takes a drink.   He stares

at the keyboard-

Ty PLAYS something like a MINUET-

Ty hits a MINOR CHORD, lets it decay-

A silence.    Maceo is moved by the scene-

Ty gets up and crosses the room with his drink in his hand,

distraught. This is the end for Ty, no strategies left,

nothing but the bitter taste of total defeat-

WHAP! He kicks Sonny's guitar case, left sticking out under

a table, and sends it spinning across the floor till it

CRASHES into the bar and flips open. Ty and Maceo stare at

the contents-

Maceo pulls out a home-built SOLID BODY GUITAR, a painted

white rectangle with a complicated PICKUP jury-rigged over

the strings and yards of ELECTRICAL CORD hanging off it-

China Doll rushes in, upset-

Maceo plucks a string.    Not much of a sound-

He dumps the sack Sonny brought out and outs falls a mass of

tubes and wires, also home-modified-

Maceo turns the guitar over in his hands-

Ty has a thought.    He looks over at the guitar in Maceo's

hands-

Ty smiles-

52   INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE                                     52

Ty looks stricken-

He puts his feet down and sits forward, drilling Ty with his

eyes-

Ty considers.   He doesn't have any options-

Sheriff Pugh heaves himself to his feet-

53   EXT. 2ND COTTON FIELD - DAY - SHOTGUN                        53

54   INT. SEWING ROOM - NADINE                                    54

55   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - DAY                                   55

Ty leaves to join Maceo-

China Doll is a little nervous to be left alone with Sonny.

She puts her comb in her hand and walks around Sonny,

examining his hair while he examines her face-

China Doll steps behind the bar-

Sonny sees the LOOSE WIRES that come through the wall behind

the bar. China Doll searches around-

She searches under the counter for something-

She acknowledges his flirting with a little smile and comes

up with a MASON JAR full of clear LIQUID-

China Doll crosses back to Sonny-

She twists the lid off, sniffs the liquid, reacts to its

strength-

56   INT. PARLOR                                               56

No need to say this to Time Trenier.       You could cut yourself

on the creases on his pants-

Ty shoots Maceo a look-

Ty and Maceo wince as the kid hits a particularly SOUR NOTE-

57   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD, 2ND COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON        57

Ham is furious but has nowhere to go with it-

Ham swipes his pay off the table, stalks away.    Sheriff Pugh

glares after him.

We FOLLOW Ham as he crosses to the rear of the truck.    Dex

sits on the tailgate, grinning at him-

He catches the eye of Lucille, standing nearby-

SNATCH! Ham grabs Dex by the shirt front and yanks him

close, hissing in fury-

Ham turns to see Sheriff Pugh standing behind him, a wry

smile on his face-

58   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - DAY                                      58

Sonny stops by a poster for the `REGINALD ERSKINE BAND

featuring Tyrone "Pinetop" Purvis'-

70   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BACK ROOM - NIGHT                        70

She starts away-

China Doll looks at him, not sure what brought this on, but

pleased to hear it. The CALLS for Guitar Sam grow LOUDER

from the floor-

China Doll exits and Ty looks back to Sonny-

71   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BARROOM                              71

Sheriff Pugh is distracted for a moment as Opal and the girls

from the store step in, dressed to the nines, drinking up the

eyeball action from the pickers and soldiers-

Ty has nothing, the crowd is starting to CHANT for Guitar Sam

again. He wipes his forehead-

Delilah is there, smiling at Pugh, pulling her coat off-

Ty and Delilah exchange a long look-

She shoots a look to Ty-

She kisses Ty on the cheek and heads for the kitchen-

Ty smiles, his nerves all gone now-

A CHEER from the crowd.    Sonny has wandered uncertainly out

onto the stage!

Ty runs up to his microphone, shoots a look to the bar-

Maceo is pouring a scotch with one hand, the other wrapped

around the wires coming out of the wall. He nods to Ty-

Sonny starts to hook his guitar up with a thick COIL OF WIRE,

then into the dented AMP sitting on a wooden chair beside him

and pointed out at the crowd. Metalmouth Sims looks on

uncomfortably. Ty puts on his biggest grin, easing behind

the keyboard-

ENTRANCE - TIME AND YOUNG HENRY

Time Trenier strolls in with his sax still in its case, hat

on his head, exuding his no-sweat attitude. Beside him is

YOUNG HENRY, a kid who can't be more than 14, wearing a

fedora-

STAGE

A TERRIBLE SQUAWK emits from the amp as Sonny makes the

connection-

Sheriff Pugh cover his ears-

The girls from the store cover their ears, making pained

faces-

Sonny pulls his guitar away from the amp and the SQUAWK

settles to a FUZZY BUZZ. Sonny frowns at the amp-

The audience is stone-faced.   Could this really be the man?

Young Henry steps up and sits behind the DRUM KIT, pulling

sticks from inside his shirt-

Ty closes his eyes, begins to shake his head in defeat-

China Doll looks worried, collecting another cover charge at

the door-

Delilah steps out from the kitchen and looks to the stage,

worried-

Sonny holds his arms out wide, shifting his body to get the

BUZZ under control-

Dex leans to talk in Junebug's ear-

Maceo isn't going to wait to find out. He grabs the wires

with both hands, yanks- they hold firm! He looks to the

stage, panicked-

-as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp

BLASTS the room with a long, trip-hammering, spine-shivering,

ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRO!

Ty stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open-

Sonny WHOOPS and leans into his microphone-

Sonny looks over to Ty, who catches himself and begins to

play along. Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast

shuffle on the skins-

Ty looks over to Maceo, half-climbing the wall as he tries to

pull the wires out. Maceo sees Ty, who waves him off-

Delilah smiles and presses her hands together, shooting a

look upward-

Time Trenier has his case open now, the gleaming instrument

in one hand, squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to

the light with the other-

The crowd is already CLAPPING and STOMPING in time with the

song. Henry starts to hit the two and the four beat hard to

keep time-

Sonny finishes with a squawking chord and the joint goes wild-

CHEERING, WHISTLING, STOMPING!

Sonny goes into the intro for Louis Jordan's Blue Light

Boogie. Time lays down a steady rock beat with his sax and

Ty joins in at the piano-

Ty joins him-

Ty takes the verse-

As they join in the chorus, Ty sees-

Cool Breeze, strolling in, checking out the action with a

proprietary air.

Ty looks to Maceo, getting back behind the bar.     Maceo sees

as well, tightening up-

Cool Breeze nods to Ty.

A slow, sexy SAX BREAK comes up and Ty leaves the piano to

cross to the bar. When he gets there Maceo is already

counting out a huge pile of BILLS-

Maceo thunks a heavy CLOTH SACK full of change onto the

countertop-

Cool Breeze doesn't even glance at the money, hard-eying Ty

instead-

Maceo looks to Ty, who remains impassive, mind working-

Ty shifts and we RACK FOCUS to see across the room to Sheriff

Pugh, receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from

Delilah. Ty smiles and waves-

Cool Breeze reconsiders his terms-

Cool Breeze grins, scoops up the bills on the counter-

Cool Breeze hefts the sack of change, shoots a look to the

stage and leans over to speak into Ty's ear-

He steps away just as the song ends to APPLAUSE, Ty taking a

deep sigh of relief. Sonny steps up to the microphone to

introduce the next song-

A shocked silence.

The audience makes way for Old Man Toussaint to come

tottering up to the foot of the stage. He points a bony

finger at Sonny-

The audience looks to Sonny for his defense-

Ty holds his breath.   Maceo brings the baseball bat up from

behind the bar.

Sonny just smiles-

Toussaint ponders this a moment, then huffs-

A CHORUS of CRIES to the same effect, and Sonny crosses back

to his microphone-

He starts into a bouncy INTRO that Metalmouth joins in with,

then starts to SING as the crowd starts to dance and clap-

The front row is all girls goggling at Sonny, instant

groupies- but we RACK to China Doll, transfixed, as she is

drawn toward the stage-

Time Trenier steps in for a growling SAX BREAK-

TY

Ty looks around the crowded, rocking room-

POV - SHERIFF PUGH

The Sheriff makes his way through the crowd and out the door.

The last person he passes turns toward Ty-

Possum?

But then DANCERS cross in front and he is gone.

TY

Ty frowns, troubled. Under the sax now we hear a dissonant

SLIDE GUITAR, the haunting notes Possum was playing at the

train station. Ty searches the crowd-

POV

The SLIDE GUITAR continues underneath as we PAN across the

crowd dancing-

There's Possum again, at the bar, face turned toward Ty.

75                                                               75

A lighter, bouncier ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF has replaced the sax

now. Ty looks deep into the eyes of the two surprised

pickers-

Dex is shaken by the strength of the grip on his arm-

Maceo is there now, holding a cardboard BOX in one hand and

the BASEBALL BAT in the other-

Ty gently takes the pistol from Dex, regards it grimly before

laying it in the box. He turns his attention to Ham-

He takes the knife from Ham, tosses it in the box-
