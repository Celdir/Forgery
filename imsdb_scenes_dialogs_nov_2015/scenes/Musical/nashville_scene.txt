FADE IN:

Still photos of twenty-four principal actors.

Nashville Airport.

TRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S

old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward

coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the

same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.

NORMAN is attracted to large CONNIE WHITE display.

At the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the

jukebox we hear one of her songs.

The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an

overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.

There are several people at the counter with him, including

GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT

REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.

A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full

or dishes. This is WADE.

REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the

TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and

checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his

newspaper.

She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking

looks at her.

She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.

She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do

all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some

glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every

time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through

the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks

away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished

his meal.

As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the

jukebox, "Keep on a goin'."  The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.

CUT TO:

We hear the last chorus or "Keep on a goin'" as sung by HAVEN,

who is recording.

He is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY

PEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is

accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater.

HAVEN is not too happy with him.

OPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape

recorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and

the piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming

instructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.

OPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.

She looks at him.

They have entered a different control tooth. In the recording

portion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song.

OPAL asks BUD who this group is.

BUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and

starts to leave, yelling at the producer.

He heads for the hallway.

It is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates

being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white

knight. OPAL moves near.

She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.

HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and

PEARL. He spots LINNEA.

They all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep

CUT TO:

Barbara Jean's plane taxis to a halt.

REESE leaves a tip and exits the coffee shop to greet the plane.

Page Missing

TOM spots stews and goes to them

L.A. JOAN is left in the dust.

GREEN sees his niece and walks over.

She turns.

CUT TO:

GLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a

gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby.

Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps

close to NORMAN.

He runs off.

As NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep

arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out.

REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT

is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all

shake hands.

BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get

anything.

BUD nods like he has been complimented.

A wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes

and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes

as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see,

especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of

applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been

exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in

awe of the situation.

When the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN

descends the stairs.

He smiles and winks.

They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone.

Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars

and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.

BARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL

while BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.

While the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN

finds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath,

trying to pretend he's on time.

BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.

NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.

MARY takes NORMAN'S hand.

She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to

someone else.

As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top

of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement

Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking

toward it, shaking hands with several people.

TOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof.

Nearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the

Replacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape-

recorded VOICE:

Behind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with "Connie

White" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He

cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.

NORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the

TRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also

joins the procession.

The orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and

there seems to be a great deal at activity.

REESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into

HAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.

Two ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE

and REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN,

who has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia.

They test her reflexes, etc..

She comes to and looks at them all.

She resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.

A stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT

climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on

DELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people.

DELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance

speeds off, siren wailing.

CUT TO:

leads the procession.

L.A. JOAN is trying to find a station she likes on her transistor

radio.

L.A. JOAN can't find anything she likes.

He chuckles at his prepared joke.

CUT TO:

speeding by each vehicle. BARBARA JEAN and BARNETT are alone.

being very piggish in its driving habits.

CUT TO:

SUELEEN in doing some vocal exercising. WADE listens for awhile.

She laughs.

He breaks into a scale.

CUT TO:

They all laugh. STEW #4 has been driving over-cautiously because

of the cargo. TOM leans over and kisses her ear.

She shrieks and practically drives off the road. They all laugh.

They laugh.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

GLENN is at the window. "Connie White" ads are present.

Part of normal traffic. It belongs to TOMMY BROWN, who lounges

with four very black associates, playing serious poker.

Joining the procession from an auxiliary route. With her is

OPAL, who interviews LINNEA.

CUT TO:

KENNY is caught up in the crowd entering Nashville.

ALBUQUERQUE turns and looks out the window. They ride in

resentful silence.

CUT TO:

Near a bridge, a huge diesel truck almost collides with the

Replacement car, which has just made a greedy move.

To avoid collision, the diesel jackknifes, blocking all traffic

behind it, except for one narrow lane.

MARY sits erect.

BILL climbs out.

He runs toward the truck. At this point, the TRICYCLE MAN

appears through all the cars.

The TRICYCLE MAN works his way through traffic. STAR has climbed

from his truck and goes to help. ALBUQUESQUE takes advantage and

runs off.

It overheats and explodes. KENNY gets out, carrying his violin

case and starts to walk. ALBUQUERQUE spots him and steps near.

She looks at his violin case.

BARNETT is in a rage. The ATTENDANTS administer oxygen to

BARBARA JEAN

The ambulance passes all the vehicles, including the horse rigs.

As he passes NORMAN'S limo:

She climbs out of the car and moves to the freeway rail and yells

for some workmen below to call the police.

The driver is hurt badly. TRICYCLE MAN and STAR are there. STAR

looks up, relieved an ambulance is coming. His face drops as the

ambulance speeds past and toward the city.

ALBUQUERQUE is walking with KENNY. She sees STAR returning to

his truck. She ducks into the ivy.

STAR approaches his truck, sees ALBUQUERQUE is gone and spots

KSNNY.

KENNY nods "yes" and climbs in the pickup.

People are helping the injured driver. TRICYCLE MAN climbs on

his machine and leaves, heading toward Nashville.

CUT TO:

BARBARA JEAN is in bed. A DOCTOR is there, along with a crowd of

publicity people and well-wishers, including: TRIPLETTE, REESE,

BUD. BARNETT hovers over BARBARA JEAN. The atmosphere is

stifling.

He turns to the visitors.

There are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved

in their own conversations. TRIPLETTE walks toward the bed, but

can't really get close enough. He finally captures BARNETT as

the people start to leave.

BARNETT turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers

who he is. He doesn't.

The crowd is almost out of the room now. We see GLENN there as he

steps into the hallway.

He stands there too long.

BARNETT says "you bet" again and closes the door after TRIPLETTE.

BARNETT returns to the bed with BARBARA JEAN and the DOCTOR.

CUT TO:

A few of the people still remain, among them GLENN, who has just

finished another postcard. Near BARBARA JEANS' hospital room in

MRS. GREEN'S. GREEN is visiting her now and LA. JOAN waits in

the hall, smoking a cigarette. BUD is talking with a few people.

L.A. JOAN brings out a new cigarette and asks GLENN for a 1ight.

He doesn't have one, so she moves to BUD. She scares him, but he

lights her fresh cigarette anyway. She asks him for a ride, and

they leave together as GREEN comes out. GREEN begins to look for

L.A. JOAN.

CUT TO:

TRICYCLE MAN parks in front. He enters.

SUELEEN is auditioning. The TRICYCLE MAN goes to the bar and

listens. He is one of the few people who do. SUELEEN directs

her performance to him.

Also at the bar is TOM, being interviewed by OPAL.

STAR is down at the end, drinking alone and looking for

ALBUQUERQUE. The phone rings and the MANAGER answers it.

INTERCUT WITH:

Establish the REESES' relationship with their children. DELBERT

speaks to TRIPLETTE

Sueleen has finished her song and eavesdrops blatantly.

The MANAGER keeps looking at SUELEEN

Both hang up the telephones.

The MANAGER carefully looks at SUELEEM.

She kisses his cheek. He hates it. He writes on a piece of

paper.

She nods "yes" and takes the paper.

She isn't convincing.

ALBUQUERQUE enters. STAR sees her and chases her outside.

STAR hits the pavement, but there is no sign or ALBUQUERQUE. He

stands there as BUD and L.A. JOAN enter.

BUD and L.A. JOAN go to the bar as SUELEEN sings another song.

TOM has moved away from OPAL to the telephone.

DELBERT, TRIPLETTE, LINNEA and the kids are eating. The phone

rings. LINNEA answers it.

INTERCUT:

T0M

Cutting a record.

Pauses.

She tries not to hear what he's saying.

She laughs.

He hangs up the phone. LINNEA looks at the dinner table and

DELBERT and the kids.

TOM moves back to the bar and OPAL. L.A. JOAN has found the

TRICYCLE MAN more interesting than BUD and slides close to him.

BUD takes the opportunity to sneak out.

CUT TO:

NORMAN is on stage doing his routine, a series of imitations and

jokes, with help from Bluegrass pickers, who introduce him to the

audience. BILL and MARY are in the audience, watching NORMAN.

At another table sit BARNETT, TOMMY BROWN, PEARL, HAVEN

negotiating a deal and watching NORMAN as a potential warm-up

act. They think he stinks

KENNY enters with his violin case and sits. Near the back WADE

is drunk, leaning against the wall. ALBUQUERQUE enters from the

back door. She hangs around the kitchen, stealing food. WADE

notices her and starts to talk to her.

ALBUQUERQUE pretends she's fixing her purse.

ALBURQUERQUE can't find any, so she grabs whatever she can that

will fit into her purse.

NORMAN caters his material to TOMMY BROWN, hoping to get the Job.

TOMMY turns in his chair and looks at WADE. BARNETT leans into

TOMMY.

TOMMY

I don't think Norman's done yet.

TOMMY and BARNETT leave.

The Bluegrass players pick up the tempo by playing music. KENNY

tries to calm WADE down, but WADE belts him. NORMAN sings the

National Anthem. PEARL gets mad and tosses WADE out the back

door. ALBUQUERQUE goes after WADE to soothe him. BILL, MARY and

NORMAN leave together out the front. ALBUQUERQUE watches from the

alley.

MARY mothers NORMAN. BILL, MARY and NORMAN enter the limo,

leaving KENNY behind. STAR drives up. He recognizes KENNY from

the freeway

KENNY climbs in.

CUT TO:

TRICYCLE MAN drives L.A. JOAN to the hospital. She climbs off

his machine.

GREEN comes out of the hospital and walks over. He is hurt

They walk off to GREEN'S car. TRICYCLE MAN drives oft.

GLENN is in the middle of the rose garden gathering a bouquet of

flowers. When he finishes, he enters the building.

GLENN walks past the desk, holding the bouquet so no one will see

it. He enters the elevator.

PAGE MISSING

in the most despicable kind of condition. ALBUQUERQUE wades

through the waste, uses the John, then discovers it won't flush.

She goes to wash her hands but there is only a trickle. She

takes some Kleenex from her purse and dries her face and hands,

exiting the bathroom with the key still in the door.

CUT TO:

GLENN eases out of the chair where he has been sitting all night.

He has been writing a letter and puts it near the glass of

flowers. He looks at BARBARA JEAN for the last time, puts the

chair back, and leaves, bumping into an entering NURSE.

GLENN is too scared to say anything and takes off down the hall.

The NURSE checks BARBARA JEAN and lets it go at that.

CUT TO:

TOM is in bed with OPAL. He gets up and goes to the window. We

see the TRICYCLE MAN'S machine parked outside.

He goes to his Jacket and pulls out a phone number, then starts

to dial.

There is a long pause.

Another long pause.

OPAL is getting dressed and gathering her things.

OPAL is almost ready to leave. She sees the tricycle parked

outside. LINNEA has hung up on TOM and he dials again.

The phone is hung up in TOM'S ear. TOM studies the phone number

for an instant, then tosses it in the ashtray. OPAL has left and

perhaps we even HEAR the ROAR of the tricycle.

CUT TO:

KENNY stands on the front porch or one of the many rooming houses

near Music Row. GREEN opens the front door. He is with his dog.

We HEAR L.A. JOAN SINGING from another room.

KENNY follows GREEN down the hall.

They shake hands.

L.A. JOAN'S VOICE gets louder.

KENNY starts to answer.

GREEN doesn't hear him. L.A. JOAN wanders in and out, catching

KENNY'S eye.

GREEN smiles.

He hands over the money.

As KENNY starts to explain, L.A. JOAN appears.

JOAN eyes KENNY and moans that she doesn't want to go. GREEN gets

firm.

CUT TO:

We are inside a recording studio LOOKING INTO the glass booth.

There is an ENGINEER in the booth.

ALBUQUERQUS stands with some papers.

she shakes her head, "No" and moves closer to the mike.

She smiles at the backup trio: bass violin, piano, violin.

We HEAR the intro and she begins.

After the song finishes, the trio ends and the red light goes

out. The PLAYBACK BLARES.

CUT TO:

STAR drives past, looking for ALBUQUERQUE as GREEN'S car parks

and he and JOAN enter the hospital.

GLENN is there writing yet another post card. GREEN and JOAN

enter. JOAN eyes GLENN. GREEN talks to the NURSE. He carries

flowers.

He hands one to her.

GREEN goes over and joins GLENN and JOAN in the waiting area.

JOAN is coaxing GLENN into going to the Opera.

CUT TO:

BARNETT enters with a basket of fruit.

BARBARA JEAN rolls over and opens her eyes. She sees GLENN'S

flowers and the note that says, "When I die I want you to come

along and be an angel with me."

She gets out of bed and goes to the bathroom.

BARBARA JEAN suddenly starts to cry loudly. She covers the SOUND

by FLUSHING the TOILET. When that cycle fades, she FLUSHES

again.

CUT TO:

NORMAN drives up and enters.

NORMAN picks up the house phone, then sees MARY.

She exits without stopping.

CUT TO:

OPAL is driven up to the house by the TRICYCLE MAN.

BUD gives OPAL a tour of the house. She carries her big

recorder.

DELBERT enters after having had a meeting with HAVEN in another

room.

They nod.

REESE starts for another room.

He catches OPAL'S eye and doesn't leave.

REESE looks at OPAL.

CUT TO:

We SEE TOM and MARY make love. Not a word is spoken.

CUT TO:

TRICYCLE MAN arrives. So do REESE and OPAL. She records

everything he says, more for him than her. He talks about being

counsel for all the Western stars and WALKER, too -

L.A. JOAN and GLENN are in the audience. KENNY sits near them.

STAR is present also.

ALBUQUERQUE sneaks in as the guards check TRIPLETTE'S ID. TOMMY

BROWN is backstage, next to perform. An ANNOUNCER introduces the

acts.

ALBUQUERQUE looks to see who is present.

CONNIE WHITE and her entourage are gathered. HAVEN, BUD and

PEARL talk. OPAL and REESE arrive. As TOMMY BROWN performs,

TRIPLETTE makes the rounds. OPAL comes near. They are handed

pieces of anniversary cake.

He looks puzzled.

At this point, HAVEN walks up.

They are taken quite off guard.

Somebody walks by and asks HAVEN how the PRESIDENT is.

TRIPLETTE clears his throat and turns his back to HAVEN and

continues to talk to OPAL. HAVEN walks off.

HAVEN grabs the mike and bursts into one of his more famous

songs, then overlaps it with another. At the finish, he accepts

applause and begins to speak about BARBARA JEAN.

GLENN politely leaves when CONNIE WHITE is announced. The

TRICYCLE MAN takes his seat, next to L.A. JOAN.

CUT TO:

ALBUQUERQUE talks to two POLICEMEN.

POLICEMAN

Sorry, miss. No pass, no entrance. Your people should have given

you a pass.

We HEAR HAVEN'S VOICE from the stage.

CONNIE WHITE passes ALBUQUERQUE and the POLICEMEN on her way to

the bathroom. ALBUQUERQUE rushes up.

The POLICEMEN standing right behind her. They all know she is

lying.

A MAN walks into the group.

CONNIE smiles and squeezes ALBUQUERQUE'S hand.

CONNIE has disappeared and the POLICE start to usher out

ALBUQUERQUE. She tries to see and hear as:

Connie White starts to sing. She does a few of her tunes.

CUT TO:

TRICYCLE MAN is the first to leave. He's with L.A. JOAN. After

they drive away, there is an exodus.

After everyone else has gone, KENNY sits alone in the audience.

INTERCUT WITH

SEQUENCE IN OPERA:

SUELEEN is in her mirror applying a whole face based upon the

stars of the forties. She is listening to the OPERA ON the RADIO

and eating pork and beans and tuna from cans. Her room is tilled

with photographs of herself and Catholic symbols. She goes to

the closet and selects a gown. She is preparing an outfit and

face for the benefit.

CUT TO:

We HEAR the tail end of CONNIE WHITE'S SONG on the radio. BARNETT

is intently listening.

He continues to listen until the end.

BARBARA JEAN gets up out of bed.

She begins pulling flowers from various vases.

She sits down on the floor at the foot of the bed and begins to

cry. BARNETT backs off. If she was hoping for understanding,

she is not about to receive it.

He bends down and looks at her with the eyes of a race horse

owner whose investment Just collapsed in the stretch.

Afraid she has gone too far, BARBARA JEAN stops crying and tries

to make everything all right. But she is still choking in her

own panic of being left.

BARNETT looks at her as if from now on he will suspect her of

secretly being crazy. He begins to pick up the flowers from the

floor.

BARBARA JEAN crawls numbly back into her bed, nodding

affirmatively.

She begins to shiver. BARNETT looks at her, but he makes no

attempt to come any closer.

He leans in and pats her arm gingerly.

BARBARA JEAN nods affirmatively, still shivering.

She senses he can't go any further.

He looks at her again and leaves.

He is not out the door before the tears begin again and she turns

into her pillow so he won't hear her.

GREEN has come from his wife's room. He sees BARNETT walk down

the hall. After a moment's deliberation, GREEN enters BARBARA

JEAN'S room.

We SEE GREEN come in the door. BARBARA JEAN is sti1l trying to

control herself, but is not having much luck with it.

MR. GREEN can't bear what she's saying. He hesitates for a

minute and then figures what the hell.

She freezes, thinking BARNETT has come back and she will be

discounted as totally insane.

She turns and screams at GREEN.

She scares GREEN, too, but he recovers better.

She listens to him. The words somehow comfort her and she begins

to laugh.

Realizing he can't hear too well makes her feel a little more

secure.

BARBARA JEAN Well, Mr. Green, you tell those doctors to stop that

whittling and get her some Vitamin E. Have her take that three

times a day, along with some good meals. If I could cook for

her, she'd be well in a minute.

A NURSE enters.

She watches as he leaves, sorry to see him go.

CUT TO:

LINNEA is getting ready for bed. She wishes TOM would call. The

PHONE RINGS.

She hangs up and sighs.

CUT TO:

NORMAN and BILL are there. An ENTERTAINER is singing the CONNIE

WHITE song that CONNIE is doing at the Opera. BILL is eager to

know where MARY is.

NORMAN shrugs.

BARNETT, with the flowers, enters and sits in the lounge.

It is getting crowded by people returning from the Opera.

OPAL is on one of the house phones, talking to Paris. We can also

HEAR the HOUSE PHONE OPERATOR behind the switchboard desk. OPAL

speaks in a combination of English and French. She isn't saying

much in one language and she might just be talking to the

OPERATOR, but is sounds impressive.

CONNIE WHITE and her group step into the lobby. The MC in the

lounge, spots her and coaxes her into taking the stage and

singing one of her hits. When she finishes, BARNETT walks up and

thanks her, handing her the flowers. Meanwhile, HAVEN, who is

there with BUD and PEARL, tells TRIPLETTE that CONNIE and BARBARA

JEAN will replace each other, but never appear on the same bill.

After BARNETT exits, CONNIE leaves with HAVEN, BUD, PEARL and

TRIPLETTE. OPAL is still on the phone, now speaking in Ita1ian.

As CONNIE and group step out of the lounge, MARY enters. BILL and

NORMAN see her. BILL reacts.

END OF TUESDAY.

CUT TO:

CHURCH BELLS RINGING.

TRICYCLE MAN drives past the different churches.

DELBERT enters with his two kids. ALBUQUERQUE watches.

DELBERT sits. HAVEN and BUD are among those in attendance.

CUT TO:

TRICYCLE MAN drives by as TOMMY BROWN enters.

TOMMY sits. LINNEA sings in the all-black choir. OPAL is there

with her tape recorder doing research.

We SEE the TRICYCLE MAN outside. Present inside are SUELEEN,

STAR, PEARL and WADE.

A small chapel service for patients and families. FEATURED are

BARBARA JEAN, BARNETT, GREEN and GLENN.

CUT TO:

BILL and MARY are having a violent fight, broken dishes and all.

BILL throws something else.

She spins him around, but he tosses her onto the bed. He calls

her all kinds of things. The PHONE RINGS. BILL wants it to be

TOM, so he can yell at him, too.

BILL starts to laugh. TRIPLETTE starts to laugh. BILL stops

He hangs up the phone and goes to the mirror, yelling at MARY.

Momentarily, there is a KNOCK on the door.

BILL walks to the door and opens it on TRIPLETTE'S sincere smile

and extended hand.

TRIPLETTE enters the room and starts to take it in. MARY comes

from the bathroom, her face swollen. BILL and MARY act as if

nothing has happened.

TRIPLETTE laughs nervously.

TRIPLETTE laughs again. BILL and MARY will be tough to convince.

BILL lights a cigarette and takes a shot of tequilla out of the

bottle on the floor.

MARY smiles.

BILL ignores her.

MARY looks at BILL.

BILL begins the fight again.

TRIPLETTE moves in fast.

They stop and look at him suspiciously.

They seem to change viewpoints in a moment.

TRIPLETTE settles in like they were old friends.

MARY and BILL get caught up in the sincerity.

BILL bypasses all the talk about WALKER.

BILL takes another shot of tequilla.

TRIPLETTE shakes his hand.

BILL ignores her.

They shake.

CUT TO:

TOM is having a serious attack of too much of everything. He

takes a handful of vitamins, some aspirin and follows it with a

couple of uppers. Then he looks for LINNEA'S phone number.

There is a KNOCK on the door.

NORMAN enters and they shake.

TOM hands over a copy of their last album.

TOM looks NORMAN down. NORMAN cheerfully changes the subject.

TOM has found the phone number and dials.

The PHONE RINGS but no one answers.

CUT TO:

We HEAR JOAN singing from her room. GREEN'S dog is on the bed.

KENNY finds a dime, then steps into the hallway.

KENNY calls his MOTHER collect in Indiana. After the rundown

with the operator, they finally speak.

He looks suspiciously at the dog in his room.

KENNY signals the dog to get off the bed. He's getting worried.

L.A. JOAN will have wandered in and out during this phone call.

KENNY is really impatient to get the dog oft his bed.

KENNY hangs up the receiver and starts for his room and the dog.

L.A. JOAN comes from her room and interrupts. She asks him where

he's going.

CUT TO:

LINNEA has come to join DELBERT and the kids. They enter an ante

room where coffee and snacks are served.

ALBUQUERQUE is eating everything in sight. LINNEA approaches.

ALBUQUERQUE'S mouth is full and she nods, "yes."

The MINISTER is nearby.

He walks to the next person. ALBUQUERQUE passes LINNEA and

DELBERT and goes to the street.

CUT TO:

NORMAN is giving TRIPLETTE a tour.

They pass a house with a red pickup truck in the driveway.

TRIPLETTE cranes to look as a car with "Just Married" and "We've

only just begun" painted on it drives by them. Norman looks at

it, too.

He makes another turn on to a street that looks like a series of

parks strung together. He slows down.

TRIPLETTE struggles to see. NORMAN pulls up a little further and

stops.

Sure enough you can.

The limo passes OPAL and continues down the road.

We SEE OPAL hitching a ride. He starts past, but she yells,

forcing him to stop.

OPAL opens the door and gets in.

STAR just looks at her. She smiles back.

STAR drives off.

He grunts.

There is a long pause. STAR doesn't respond, so OPAL continues.

She removes same of her clothes because or the heat

STAR looks at her body and changes lanes.

She reaches over and turns on the RADIO. He reaches over and

turns it off.

We SEE them pass KENNY'S Nash. KEMNY and L.A. JOAN are there.

All the door handles have been stolen from the car. So has the

radio and the steering wheel. There is a raw egg and a note that

says, "ha-ha."  KENNY is dumbfounded.

He opens the trunk. There are several political posters and

politically motivated materials for WALKER.

KENNY looks at her for a minute.

The TRICYCLE MAN passes by the car.

END OF SUNDAY.

CUT TO:

KENNY is on the hall phone. Outside we HEAR the tricycle. KENNY

has a stack of dimes and in calling wrecking yard people,

The MAN has hung up. KENNY draws a line through his name and

dials again.

During KENNY'S calls, JOAN is dressing in a hurry.

Suddenly there is another person's VOICE on the line.

The MAN hangs up. Nothing else happens.

As he hangs up, JOAN appears with her transistor. She is quite

in a hurry.

She ignores him.

And she is gone.

CUT TO:

TOM is singing alone. L.A. JOAN enters the studio and begins

talking to one of the engineers. when TOM finishes she enters

the booth.

NORMAN, BILL and MARY enter the studio.

The studio door is burst open on TOM who is singing. BILL is

forced to stand still. TOM doesn't look up until he in finished.

TOM and MARY bounce a look, her face is a little discolored.

He gets up and starts out the door. BILL is very anxious.

He goes through the swinging door.

TOM is on the phone. MARY makes her way toward his back. There

is no answer to his call, so he hangs up and faces her.

Long pause.

Another pause. BILL sticks his head out from the studio room.

MARY walks pant TOM into the studio room. TOM holds up a finger

to indicate he'll be a minute and walks toward the bathroom.

MARY reaches BILL.

L.A. JOAN goes and waits outside the bathroom. When TOM comes out

they exit together.

MARY is at her mike with her instrument. The engineer asks for a

level so BILL and MARY sing their hit song. When they finish,

CUT TO:

BARBARA JEAN is sitting at the foot of the bed. A NURSE in there

talking to BARNETT.

The PHONE RINGS.

He hangs up. The NURSE is reading the forms. BARBARA JEAN is

going through the flowers... She finds GLENN'S and reads the

note.

She puts them on the gurney with the others.

As they start out, DELBERT enters.

There is a pause. BARNETT and REESE have been talking away from

BARBARA JEAN.

REESE leaves. BARNETT returns to BARBARA JEAN and the NURSE.

BARNETT and BARBARA JEAN come from the elevator. GLENN is there

writing. He sees her,  As BARRETT and BARBARA JEAN leave, GREEN

arrives with flowers for his wife. He sees BARBRA JEAN and hands

her a flower.

BARBARA JEAN feels BARNETT'S impatience to go.

She goes on out the door as he walks to the desk.

He hands the NURSE a flower. She looks up in disbelief.

She makes several phone calls and can't locate anyone. She sighs

and hangs up.

GREEN has and hasn't heard.

He is stunned.

He wanders to the waiting area. GLENN has been looking out the

window at BARBARA JEAN getting into the bus. He comes back and

begins to talk to GREEN so caught up in her he doesn't register

GREEN'S grief.

GREEN looks at him and nods. He's still got the vitamins in his

hand.

GREEN nods.

GREEN nods.

GREEN nods and puts the vitamins in his pocket as the NURSE calls

from the desk.

CUT TO:

The PHONE RINGS SEVERAL TIMES before LINNEA answers it.

INTERCUT:

Again she is left with a dead receiver.

TOM exits. Behind him is Percy Warner Park and the Parthenon.

L.A. JOAN is with TOM.

CUT TO:

SUELEEN works her way through a crowd of men trying to get into

the banquet hall. There is a sign that says "Benefit Banquet."

SUELEEN finally makes it through the crowd and enters the room.

She walks past the tables and steps on the stage. She checks the

curtain to find that there is no backstage. She enters the

kitchen.

SUELEEN almost trips over REESE and TRIPLETTE and another man who

are talking.

She removes her coat and exposes a costume that looks like a

picture of a frosty glass or gin and tonic on a hot day.

TIRIPLETTE stares blatantly and REESE can hardly keep his hands

off her. SUELEEN starts into her routine as a matter of

survival.

She hands over a stack of music.

TRIPLETTE smiles.

TRIPLETTE puts his arm around her and walks off.

They continue to walk past the many places.

She shakes her head, "no" quite caught up in air.

They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the

oven.

She nods "yes."

The waiters come in to serve the salad and the rolls and the chef

starts to carve the meat. We FOLLOW one of the waiters into the

banquet hall.

It is almost full. The pianist and the drummer are on the non-

stage. At the far end of the roam, we SEE someone enter from the

street, go to the sign and read it.

It is ALBUQUERQUE reading "banquet." The door to the room closes

and she goes down another corridor and disappears.

The men have finished their dinner and SUELEEN finishes her song.

The applause is thunderous. SUELEEN looks to the kitchen door.

TRIPLETTE is applauding like crazy. REESE in beside him.

She blows kisses then runs to TRIPLETTE.

It's too late. The ANNOUNCER speaks.

There are a few chortles. Suddenly she freezes. TRIPLETTE holds

her and kisses her hair.

Page missing

TRIPLETTE encases her in her coat. TRIPLETTE yells something

about bringing her clothes as the audience goes crazy.

ALBUQUERQUE is totally fascinated and delighted, applauding to

the point of almost giving herself away. She picks up SUELEEN'S

clothes.

CUT TO:

REESE drives SUSLEEN home. He is drunk. He double-parks.

She looks out the window and nods. He gets out and opens the

door as LADY PEARL walks past them on her way to the lounge.

STAR drives up behind REESE'S double-parked ear and has to move

around it. SUELEEN starts for her room, but REESE follows very

close. Finally, he turns her around.

His look says what he wants. She is terrified.

She starts to walk quickly, but he grabs her arm.

He pushes her against one or the storefronts.

He squeezes her arm and she screams.

She is about to pass out from terror, when all or a sudden he

eases of.

The TRICYCLE MAN stands and watches a few feet away. SUELEEN'S

terror now is divided between the two men. REESE can't handle

the way the TRICYCLE MAN looks at all.

He releases SUELEEN, turns and runs up the street. She slides

down and hugs herself. The TRICYCLE MAN doesn't move.

After a while, she pulls herself up and starts up the stairs to

her room. The TRICYCLE MAN watches until she is gone, then walks

across the street.

((THE FOLLOWING IS INTERCUT WITH BANQUET)

TOM enters with L.A. JOAN. The place in crowded. WADE sits at a

table with LINNEA. She hasn't seen TOM.

Before TOM can sit down he is called on stage by the MC. Also

present are BILL, MARY and NORMAN, talking about NORMAN'S act and

OPAL, who interviews them. LINNEA sees TOM.

TOM stands at the mike.

Everybody laughs.

TON

Well, they're here, Bill and Mary. We're cutting a record here.

So far, they've done all the work. It's an accident they're here.

I've been hiding from them for days now, right?

Everybody laughs.

Everyone laughs.

She in lost in the sound of his voice.

TOM calls BILL and MARY to the stage. The three of them burst

into:  "Since You've Gone."  When they finish, BILL and MARY sit

down again.

TOM seems to know where LINNEA is sitting and directs the song to

her. After he finishes, he gives the guitar back to its owner

and Joins L.-A. JOAN to walk out.

WADE starts in again.

LINNEA is wiping her eyes with a hanky.

A large group of people starts out the door, among them TOM and

L.A. JOAN. TOM steers himself and JOAN to LINNEA'S table. BILL

and MARY catch him there. All the while he is talking to them,

he writes a note and places it in LINNEA'S lap. OPAL walks past

TOM. They look at each other.

She nods again. She can't make out the writing with out her

glasses and she doesn't want to put them now.

She nods 'yes.'

She is too curious. She takes out her glasses and looks through

them lorgnette style as WADE continues to talk.

TOM takes L.A. JOAN and leaves. LINNEA panics, BILL burns, OPAL

and MARY watch after TOM, NORMAN keeps silent.

She gets up quickly and leaves. Everybody is gone, too.

CUT TO:

As LINNEA hurries off, we SEE STAR sitting in his pickup truck,

watching and waiting for ALBUQUERQUE.

END OF MONDAY.

CUT TO:

The TRICYCLE MAN is helping KENNY fix the car, changing tires,

etc. KENNY is under the hood. When he comes out, KENNY tells

the TRICYCLE MAN how grateful he is and that he wouldn't know

what to do if he hadn't shown up. The TRICYCLE MAN just finishes

the job.

CUT TO:

A platform has been erected in the center of the parking lot.

BARBARA JEAN'S bus is parked nearby. There is a large crowd, and

several people gathered around the platform. GLENN is among them

so is TRIPLETTE, REESE and OPAL. Radio station personnel and

musicians prepare for the show. Finally, the bus door opens and

BARNETT leads BARBARA JEAN to the platform. The musicians start

and she sings. The sound comes from many huge speakers and

people come from stores and shops to hear.

BARBARA JEAN segues from one song to another.

BARNETT stands to the side, talking to various people TRIPLETTE

pulls his sleeve.

THIPLETTE

I came out to see how you all were doing.

TRIPLETTE'S last sentence is caught in silence as BARBARA JEAN

has stopped singing in the middle of a phrase.

She holds the mike and looks at Barnett.

She faints. There in a moment of confusion, then GLENN is on the

stage protectively as the musicians clear the people out

BARNETT vaults through the crowd pushing TRIPLETTE aside.

He pulls himself on the stage. She is coming to and sees GLENN'S

face looking at her and rubbing her hands.

He carries her to the bus. TRIPLETTE is forced to watch from a

distance.

BARBARA JEAN has come to and she and BARNETT are alone in the

back of the bus. He studies her carefully for a minute and then

decides she'll be all right.

She fights back the tears.

He blows her a kiss and steps from the bus.

BARNETT sends the nurses inside. GLENN has pushed to front of

the crowd. BARHETT grabs a hand mike.

There is a group groan. BARNETT looks for some under-standing

but there is none. There are several catcalls and GLENN, who in

near BARNETT, becomes so enraged, he tries to find the caller.

There is almost a fight, but TRIPLETTE intervenes. He glances to

GLENN.

Catcalls continue from other parts of the audience. TRIPLETTE

shouts against GLENN, who has turned his intensity to the crowd

BARNETT studies the angry crowd then TRIPLETTE, who is holding

back GLENN against them. The crowd is even more angry

GLENN has disengaged from TRIPLETTE'S hold and pushed his way to

the back.

Moves closer.

He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he

speaks.

He calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the

statement. Then the secretary signs.

TRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores

it. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S

attention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary.

BARNETT looks at him suspiciously.

BABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the

same as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged.

The MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him --

BARNETT yells after him.

The MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the

crowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the

MAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and

hits the windshield with it. The car MISFIRES but finally

starts.. As the MAN drives off, BARNETT stands watching until

he's out of sight.

CUT TO:

((THE FOLLOWING Is INTERCUT WITH THE SHOPPING CENTER)

We SEE a fairground, then a roller rink, and a wrestling ring,

and finally a small portable stage in the center of a circular

track. The grandstands are partially ruled and stock cars roar

from another part or the field;

Around the stage -we SEE a sign that says, "Talent Show Tonight"

and we see the contestants and the MC, and NORMAN doing a routine

with an accordion player. After NORMAN finishes, the NC takes

the mike.

ALBUQUERQUE walks to the mike.

There are-a few nasty remarks.

She starts to sing, "You're an Old Smoothie," and as she does the

stock cars leave the pit and drive to the entrance of the track.

ALEBUQUERQUE, disturbed at first, sings louder. The cars are

waiting for the talent show to set off the track.

Albuquerque starts to take off her clothes. The MC hasn't

noticed, but the grandstand has. People shout, "Take it off..."

ALBUQUERQUE loves it. Before ALBUQUERQUE can remove the last two

garments, the MC rushes over and grabs the mike.

The stands are calling to have her take it all off and her fellow

contestants are furious. RAVEN, BUD and PEARL are there and they

discuss her act.

He shuts oft the mike.

The stock cars start around the track and stop in front or the

race announcer.

AL

A wave of applause and we SEE the talent show make its way across

the rack. The platform is already torn down and the MC is

helping ALBUQUERQUE dress. As she passes the drivers, they cheer

and she blows them a kiss and loses her first garment as she

does. More cheers.

The cars are dented. On the side of one car it says, "Haven

Hamilton," and now we see him, BUD and PEARL in the stands. On

the side of another car it says, "Connie White."

AL

Want you all to save a dime every day and next Saturday we'll

take up a collection and give it all to Billy Apple's wife.

Share. Their four kids will sure miss their daddy. Want to

announce Bob Trilltree is out of the hospital now. Hope you'll

be back with us soon. All right, would you stand, please?

The people stand to a scratchy record of the National Anthem. A

'74 Pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium-sized

American flag which flaps as the convertible drive.. At the end

of the song the Pontiac drives off the track.

AL

This is for Billy Apple. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's pick

ourselves a winner.

The drivers get into their cars and start up. The track man

waves a flag which starts them around the track in pairs. We

notice the TRICYCLE MAN, who has been there all the time. The

race starts and the SOUND is deafening. ALBUQUERQUE is thrilled

to death. Suddenly, STAR sneaks up on her as she whistles with

her fingers in her mouth.

She has no choice but to follow him out. Several people

compliment her as she leaves the grandstand. She buys a bag of

peanuts on the way out.

CUT TO:

There is some lovemaking going on in Tom's bed.

She makes a more to leave.

She laughs and eases out of the bed.

She starts to go into the bathroom.

She nods.

She looks at him close, then goes into the bathroom and shuts the

door.

We HEAR TOM making a phone call. LINNEA grabs a towel and wraps

it around her head and throws back the shower curtain, only to

find a huge black cockroach in the tub. TOM laughs as she shuts

the curtain in horror, then she proceeds to take a sponge bath.

She leaves the bathroom quickly.

TOM is still on the phone. LINNEA dresses, but can't find her

slip. She finishes and heads for the door.

He steps to LINNEA and puts his arms around her.

He kisses her and walks back to the bed. As she gets to the

door, she is hit with something,  It is her slip.

He smiles and she walks out the door.

Outside, LINNEA hangs the slip on the doorknob and leaves.

CUT TO:

GREEN is in bed. KENNY takes away a tray of cookies and hot

chocolate.

You okay?

KENNY turns out the light and calls the dog. GREEN settles into

his pillow.

END OF TUESDAY.

CUT TO:

A small, empty last rite for MRS. GREEN. KENNY and GREEN are at

the grave. In the distance, the TRICYCLE MAN watches.

CUT TO:

Preparation for the big televised rally.

CUT TO:

Outside the Parthenon, KENNY, with his violin case, waits for

some food at the barbecue. ALBUQUERQUE'S who has fled STAR

again, waits near him. BARNETT is talking to REESE.

TRIPLETTE is at the stairs. GLENN is trying to get past a guard

and finally TRIPLETTE recognizing him from the shopping center,

helps him in. They enter the stair area, near all the TV cables

and equipment.

They approach BARBARA JEAN, who is talking to musicians. BILL and

MARY are there with NORMAN, and LINNEA is singing on stage with

the black choir. TOMMY now steps up to talk to BARBARA JEAN.

GLENN is lost in BARBARA JEAN'S magic. She smiles at him, but in

talking to HAVEN, BUD and PEARL and looking for BARNETT.

TRIPLETTE walks by GLENN.

TRIPLETTE takes a note from GLENN.

TRIPLETTE hands her the note as BARRETT angrily steps up.

Someone calls  "places."

TOMMY BROWN joins LINNEA and the choir on stage. We SEE TOM

wandering and avoiding BILL, but catching MARY'S eye. OPAL is

near as is LA JOAN. BARBARA JEAN reads GLENN'S note: "If I die

tomorrow, I lived today."

The applause builds.

The audience is swept away.

In the audience we see KENNY and the TRICYCLE MAN and WADE.

SUELEEN is there, too.

As BARBARA JEAN sings, GLENN stands next to BARNETT. She finishes

the song and looks in GLENN'S direction.

She is leaning on a stool.

The orchestra starts. She calls for HAVEN to come out. The

applause swells and, they start a song together.

A long black limo is parked near two ambulances, the attendants

sitting on the ambulance fenders and joking.

BARBARA JEAN and HAVEN have finished the soldier song. The choir

comes out to back her now. The audience picks up the song they

sing. After the song everyone claps loudly, and a large bouquet

of flowers gets handed up to BARBARA JEAN. They hug as someone

begins to unfurl a "HAL PHILIP WALKER" banner behind them.

Photographers crowd in. Suddenly there is a sharp jolt in

HAVEN'S body and BARBARA JEAN is down. There is brief confusion,

but the choir continues to sing and everyone thinks BARBARA JEAN

has fainted again.

The confusion mounts as both HAVEN and BARBARA JEAN are down and

there are flowers lying all over the place

TRIPLETTE runs up the stairs and the choir continues. BARNETT

yells for them to stop. He and BARNETT are over BARRARA JEAN,

while guards and BUD attend to HAVEN.

There is a VOICE among the noise that shouts:

I could have got that Walker bastard before. I've been closer,

closer than this, but my Nash broke down and somebody kept

stealing my things. I wanted to get him the day before, then Mr.

Green's wire died, so this was the right time. I love the

President of the United States. I love him.

Guards grab the speaker, KENNY, in an instant. He shoots a

policeman's foot by accident. Men swallow him up. Someone

yells, "sing."

The choir has no direction to go in. ALRUQUERQUE suddenly is

with microphone.. She starts to do "It Don't Worry Me."  The rest

of the singers join in.

BARNETT leads the stretcher to one or the ambulances. He doesn't

allow HAVEN to enter.

A man walks up from the limo. It is WALKER. TRIPLETTE is near.

What'd she do, faint again?  I'm getting tired of waiting in the

car.

TRIPLETTE turns and belts him.

CUT TO:

As it speeds to the hospital. BARNETT is calm. He knows none of

it matters anyway.

The TRICYCLE MAN follows the ambulance, then heads off onto the

highway to Memphis. We SEE STAR'S truck going toward the

Parthenon.

We SEE STAR'S truck arrive and park. He gets out, as the music

and chaos swell.

END CREDITS

FADE OUT.
