HAND touched the album, caressing it lovingly for a

moment, as WE HEAR her voice.

She opend the ALBUM to reveal a BLACK AND WHITE

PHOTOGRAPH of the PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG on a

brilliant summer day.

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER TO the picture. . .

The PHOTO dissolves into REALITY in brilliant color as

the day turns into night and the summer cools into

winter. We see the palace at night, blanketed in a

beautiful, almost glowing, snow as hourse drawn carriages

pull up to the front door.

MOVE INTO THE PALACE

INT.  PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG - NIGHT

Elegant ROYALISTS mingle around the MAIN HALL as an

ORCHESTRA plays.

All eyes turn to the GLASS DOORS OF TWO ELEVADORS which

descend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase.

Through the glass doors we see TATIANA, the Dowager

Empress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is

seemingly unapproachable. TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are

with her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her

daughters - well,  all her daughters except. . .

ANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for the

party, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a

SERVENT (SONYA) 16,  who is trying to catch up with

Anastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair.

Just then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair,

stopping Anastasia with a

All eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes that

she's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous

smile and descends the staircase in grand style. As the

ribbon falls out of her hair and down her back,

Anastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride.

Tatiana sees her and can't help but smile.

The music suddenly becomes  a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS.

SERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY

steps out and begins a proccession through their

subjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she

makes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia has

a beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by

large, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of

energy and confidence for a girl her age.

beautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance

into the ball, they're "the  pride of all Russia".

Vladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire

glittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING

WALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will

rule forever.

During the above, the ball is in full swing. Beautiful

COUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including

Anastasia dancing gracefully with her father.

Under a long buffet table, we see DMITRI, 11, darkly

handsome, dressed in ragged servant clothes, with a

shock of dark hair which continuoually falls accross his

eyes as watches the guest enviously. Anastasia, still

waltzing with her father, sees him. SERVENTS cross the

room carrying a trays of BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL FRUIT. The

guests "Ew" and "ah" at the sumptuous fruit. Anastasia

sees Dmitri eyeing it hungrily and without missing a

dance step, she grabs an orange off thr tray and tosses

it to Dmitri. He catches it and smiles broadly at her.

Suddenly, A HAND grabs Dmitri and pulls him out from

under the table. It's IVAR, the HEAD SERVENT, who pulls

Dmitri into an open wall panel.

ON TATIANA

in a large throne-like chair. Tatiana is very serious

and very regal. She slides over to make room for

Anastasia who sits next to her.

Anastasia looks up at Tatiana and sees her smile with

pride.  Anastasia knows she doesn't have to explain.

Tatiana reaches from behind the chair and brings out a

beautiful MUSIC BOX.  Tatiana takes the key, a small

silver and enamel flower, on a silver neck chain and

winds it up. MUSIC BEGINS, she hands Anastasia the key.

CLOSE UP

the key bearing the inscription "Together in Paris".

Anastasia makes a disgruntled face. Tatiana laughs.

Tatiana puts the key around Anastasia's neck and they

embrace. Then, suddenly . . .

ON THE GRAND CHANDELIER

the lights begin to fade in and out.

GROUP SHOT

as PEOPLE in the ballroom look around bewildered. Then,

a WHIRLWIND kicks up, sending everyone off the dance

floor, as the whirlwind becomes a TORNADO.

Suddenly, an ALBINO BAT (BARTOK) with huge eyes, springs

out of the funnel, screeching and swooping over the

crowd, causing everyone to duck and cover their heads in

fear.

The tornada reaches it's peak and EXPLODES in smoke -

leaving RASPUTIN standing alone in the middle of the

floor. He is of indeterminate age, towering over other

men in the room, his most striking feature are his eyes

- which at this moment are burning a fiery red. He is

dressed in a flowing black monk's robe with a satin rope

tied around his waist. Connected to the rope is a

glowing RELIQUARY, a mystical lantern.

Rasputin swings the reliquary, wrapping himself in smoke

which seems to grow larger. Eerie moaning noises come

from the reliquary. PEOPLE back awayin terror.

Anastasia leaves Tatiana and rushes to stand in front of

her father. Still holding her Music Box, Anastasia's

shaking hands are the only thing that gives away her

fear. Rasputin spins toward the voice.

Twirling the reliquary again, the MOANS grow louder as

Bartok circles around his head. The smoke that emerges

seems to have almosy a human shape to it.

The tornada of smoke begins again, whipping into a

frenzy and then EXPLODING.

The smoke clears and Rasputin is gone. As the lights

return to normal the Romanov family all stand together,

and try to look regal and in control once again.

the ROMANOV FAMILY fades into a PORTRAIT OF THE FAMILY.

a lick of BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME creeps into view.

underscoring the coming revolution.

PULL BACK

to see the PORTRAIT, a huge FRIEZE which covers an

entire entire wall, singeing as the FLAME creeps up the nearby

drapery, tinting the room in a red glow.

A SCREAMING MOB, some in uniform, some not, has crashed

into the palace and is heading up the stairs. A few in

the mob fire off orange RIFLE SHOTS.

hallway. Tatiana is next to Anastasia as Anastasia

stopsdead in her tracks.

Anastasia turns around and runs back down the hall.

Tatiana tries to stop her.

It's too late, Anastasia fights her way back into her

room, with Tatiana following her.

FROM THE OTHER END OF THE HALLWAY

we see Dmitri watching amidst all the confusion.

INT. ANASTASIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Anastasia grabs her music box as Tatiana rushes in.

LOUD RIFLE SHOTS are heard as Dmitri bursts into the

room, closing the door behind him.

Dmitri runs to a wall panel and thows his weight

against it. It opens, revealing a passage way.

Tatiana, enormously grateful, looks at Dmitri as he

flips his hair out of his face unconsciously.

Tatiana goes in as Dmitri shoves Anastasia toward the

passageway, knocking the music box out of her hand.  She

reaches for it, but hearing the mob voices growing

closer, he pushes her through the panel without it.

Tatiana quickly follows Anastasia into the passageway

and Dmitri closes the panel JUST AS the mob bursts in.

The MOB, accepts the word of a peasant boy and rushes

out. Dmitri picks up the music box and looks sadly

toward the panel.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

Which is under siege by ROYALISTS trying to board the

overcrowded train and the REVOLUTIONARIES who are trying

to stop them.

A TOURING CAR pulls up RIGHT ON THE TRACKS behind the

caboose as the train starts to pull away.

Tatiana and Anastasia climb out of the car and race for

the train, fighting their way through the frenzied and

frightened crowd. WE HEAR shouts of "The Empress - let

her through!" which helps clear the way.

Anastasia reaches the train first, then turns to see

Anastasia refuses to board the train.

CHILDREN of all ages clean the cold, gray dormitory.

Their clothes are ragged and they look underfed.

ANYA, 18, pretty despite the boy's hand-me-down clothes

she is forced to wear, is busy scrubbing the floor.

Unlike the others, she is determined not to let her

surroundings get to her. She hums a tune.

The door suddenly SLAMS open and GREGOR, 8, and clearly

terrified, comes running in followed by COMRADE

PHLEGMENKOF - a huge woman carrying a switch.

All of the OTHER KIDS turn away, not wanting to get

involved.  Anya focuses on Gregor, who  is shivering with

fright and on the verge of tears as Phlegmenkof

approaches, swinging the switch menacingly.

Phlegmenkof advances on Gregor.  Anya takes the scrub

brush and SHOVES it across the floor, right under

Phlegmenkof's unsuspecting foot.  Phlegmenkof's feet fly

out from under her and she SMASHES to the floor. Gregor

hops over her huge body and runs to Anya for safety.

Some of the OTHER KIDS glance over. A CHUBBY GIRL and a

very pretty LITTLE GIRL, look at Anya with greeat

admiration . . .  someof the OTHERS think she's crazy.

Phlegmenkof rises, covered with soap bubbles , and spins

on Anya - who gives her a very innocent smile.

Some of the OTHER CHILDREN laugh as soap bubbles fly off

the enraged woman.  She spins on them, her back to Anya.

Anya, behind Phlegmenkof, mimics her outraged face and

angry gestures perfectly - as the CHILDREN laugh harder.

cause of the stench . . .

She tries to straighten herself out nervously - this

must be someone very important.

COMRADE SEREBREAKOV stands in the doorway, lecherously

eyeing the girls.  He is a huge, fleshly man with facial features which are reminiscent of a fish.

His eye catches Anya. He looks her up and down, his

beady eyes showing a touch of lust for her.

He leans close close to Anya.

Phlegmenkof moves between them, pulling Serebreakov

away.

Smiling in anticipation, he exit.

And she turns to leave in a huff. Anya does one more

imitation of her, making the CHILDREN laugh. But as

Anya turns away from her audience, we see her facade

fade and realize her terror of the future.

INT.  ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

The CHILDREN huddle in their cots under tattered, thin

blankets. Anya is fully dressed, illuminated by the

light of a FULL MOON, she ties a dull gray sheets together

and anchors the "rope" to an ice cold radiator and

throws the other end out of the window.  She is about to

climb out when she looks at the sleeping children and

smiles sadly. She walks over to Gregor's bed and puts

one hand lovingly on his head and then reaches over and

takes the hand of a sleeping LITTLE GIRL, who opens her

Anya begins to climb down the street, testing the knots.

The knotshold tight, but the old sheet RIPS in half,

sending her PLUMMETING into a snow drift.  From the

depths of the snow we HEAR her voice.

EXT.  HILLSIDE - DAWN

A glorious bright (and cold) dawn creeps over the

horizon. Anya stands at  edge of the hill, looking

down on the city of ST.PETERSBURG. The old gray

orphanage looms behind her. Anya "borrows" an old,

beat-up bicycle from the orphanage and rides down the

hill.

Music picks up in energy and excitement as Anya zooms on

her way bumping and bouncing downhill as the sunrises

and St. Petersburg looms nearer.

"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.)

- full of hope, energy and excitement as she peddls her

rickety bike toward the city. "Her heart is on its way"

and nothing is going to stop her.

Anya passes though the countryside toward the city. A

peasant family waves to her as she goes by. A Gypsy

Troupe performs tricks by the side of the road. A very

fancy car zooms by.

"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.)

a peasant to a princess! But it doesn't matter as long

as she finds her real family.

MUSICAL AND VOCAL CONCLUSION.

END MUSICAL NUMBER

Anya does not see a cute little PUPPY (MEETOO) with a

HUGE BONE in his mouth, being chased along the sidewalk

by a pack of much larger, vicious DOGS until he bolts

across Anya's path forcing her to skid to a stop. She

watched him as he scoots into an alley, followed by the

angry pack.

On reflex, Anya drops the bike and reuns into the alley

after him.

EXT.  ALLEY - DAY

Meetoo is trapped.  The PACK surrounds him, ready to

pounce when Anya LEAPS into the middle of the circle.

The PACK is startled, but begins to advance on both Anya

and Meetoo.

Anya doesn't know what to do. She crouches and then. . .

growls back at them, making her eyes look as ferocious

as possible. The PACK exchange a confused look; there's

a girl growling at them. Meetoo stands, suddenly brave,

behind her and growls along with her.

Suddenly, Anya pounced toward the pack, growling louder.

The pack has definately had enough - some start to back

out quizzically, others turn and run like hell.

Anya turns to Meetoo, who looks up at her gratefully,

wagging his tail. Anya picks up the bone and puts it

back in his mouth.

Meetoo nods and lets out a little "bark" that sounds as

if he were saying "retu".  Anya pats him and heads back

to her bike.

EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY

Anya rides down the street. She doesn't see Meetoo,

running like a little maniac behind her.

Anya approaches a STERN LOOKING BUILDING with a sign

over the door: "The People's Bureau of Bureaucracy".

She leaps off her bike and heads up the stais. Meetoo,

breathing heavily from his run, follows and almost

reaches her when the heavy door slams in his face.  He

slumps against it, panting, his little paw-to chest.

INT. BUREAU OF BUREAUCRACY - DAY

Anya enters and STOPS when she sees. . . LINES and LINES

of people which seem to go on forever.  She walks down

the side of one line, trying to figure out which one to

stand in.

They turn toward an armed Soviet Guard and smile

sweetly, hoping he heard their flattery.  He did.

He jots something down in his notebook.

ON ANYA

as she gets closer to the window. She turns to the

person behind her.

PEASANT 5, in front of her, turns around.

Peasant 6 is immediately carted off by TWO ARMED GUARDS

for his blasphamy against the state.

The OTHER PEASANTS join in with variations of "Nobody

leaves Russia" as Anya reaches the window and speaks to

the clerk.

And to further make his point, he slams shut his window,

which immediately opens a crack as he whispers to Anya.

He shuts the window, only to open it again immediately.

He shuts the window.

He opens it again.

The clerk sticks out a sign:  "Samovar Break - back in

ten minutes" and slams the window shut.

EXT.  BUREAU OF BUREAUCRACY

Anya steps out of the building, still not seeing Meetoo

and looks around at the hoards of people waiting in

lines for everything:  bread, gas, clothes, etc.

FOLLOW ANYA

as she wades into the crowded street. Meetoo getting

tangled in the legs of waiting Soviets.

Anya stops suddenly. She sniffs the air.  Her eyes

widen as she recognizes the stench that is floating

through the air.  She spins around and sees Serebreakov

DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET.

Serebreakov is on a mission to find Anya.  He turns in

her direction just as a bus passes.  Anya is gone.

We now see Anya clinging to the side of the bus as it

drives down the street. Meetoo looks, his face dropping

- he knows he'll never catch up to her now.  Then he

sees the bus hit a huge pothole and Anya is knocked off

into the mud.  Happily, Meetoo trots off in her

direction.

Anya approaches TWO PEASANTS who are waiting in line in

front of a cafe.

They begin to bicker back and forth in forced whispers

as to wether Dmitri is at the tavern or the library.

Exasperated, Anya walks away.  They call after her.

Anya rolls her eyes in frustration.  She doesn't see

Meetoo at her feet.

Meetoo gives a "retu" of agreement. Anya looks down and

sees him.

Just then, she catches another whiff of something foul

in the air. Anya duck quickly into a doorway and loses

Meetoo. Anya peeks out. A GARBAGE WAGON full of dead

fish and rotten food passes Anya.  She sighs with relief,

it wasn't Serebreakov - it just smelled like him.

Anya steps out of the doorway and approaches a STREET

ARTIST sketching a LARGE PEASANT WOMAN as her TINY

HUSBAND looks over his shoulder.

The Artist quickly scribbles and address on his pad and

hands it to her without turning around.

Anya looks down at the note

Anya is caught in a ray of moonlight, directly in front

of the image of Anastasia in the frieze.  The

resemblance is striking.  Dmitri is taken aback, but

Vladimir is unaffected.

Anya is dazed by what has just happened to her and can't

quite refocus on reality.

Dmitri pokes Vladimir with his elbow but doesn't take

his eyes off Anya.

Vladimir looks at Anya again and get it.

Vladimir and Dmitri walk down the stairs and up her

stairs and begin to circle around her.

Dmitri pokes him hard in the ribs and shakes his head.

Dmitri gives Vlad a "let me handle this" gestures.

Anya is coming back to her senses, doesn't like these

men circling her.

Dmitri stops circling and then begins to use everything

that Anya says - the perfect and charming con man that

he is - to get what he wants.

Dmitri pokes him again.

Anya laughs.  Vlad mouths to Dmitri "Do you think she's

really Anastasia?"  Dmitri shakes his head no, of course

not, then continues with Anya.  Vlad smiles to himself

Meetoo lets out his "retu". Vladimir lets out a whoop of

joy. Dmitri smiles and bows to Anya.

ON BARTOK

having watched the whole thing - he sighs.

Bartok flies out a broken window and into the night.

EXT.	AERIAL VIEW OF ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT

BARTOK'S POV

The city lights fade and we move into the blackness of

the Russian forest. Finally, in the distance. we see

the orange glow of a fire.

EXT.	GYPSY CAMP - NIGHT

Bartok swoops along the wagons. Everyone looks to be asleep.

Bartok keeps flying until he sees an ONIOUS LOOKING BLACK

WAGON, the largest and most elaborate.

Bartok screws up his courage and flies into the open

window of the BLACK WAGON.

INT.	RASPUTIN'S WAGON

A lone candle lights the dark wagon. A frightened Bartok,

stays on the window sill.

Rasputin's face suddenly ROARS into FRAME from the bed

below, his eyes fiery red and his beard wild.

Rasputin rises and pours himself a glass of vodka.

Rasputin grabs him by the throat.

Rasputin rummages around for a full bottle of vodka,

tossing the empties - which Bartok has to dodge.

He tenses, waiting for Rasputin's explosion but Rasputin

just laughs.

Bartok hovers face-to-face.

Rasputin begins a slow growl that builds.

Rasputin howls in anger and smashes his glass against

the wall. He moves toward the CABINET, knocking over

furniture. Rasputin flings open the cabinet and we see

the RELIQUARY, glowing gently as if it were sleeping.

Bartok covers his eyes in fear. Even Rasputin seem a

bit nervous in front of it.

Rasputin takes the RELIQUARY out of the cabinet and

sets it on the table.

Rasputin pulls out a set of RUSSIAN DOLLS (a small

painted. hollow doll with a smaller doll inside it,

and a smaller doll inside it, etc.) The first doll

bears an eerie resemblance to Nicholas. Inside the

second looks like Alexandra, all the way down to the

ANASTASIA doll.

"THE END OF THE LINE" (PRODUCTION NUMBER)

Rasputin will have a DARK, MENACING, DELICIOUSLY

SCARY NUMBER in whIch he SINGS of his obsession with

killing the Romanovs once and for all. Bartok will

interject comically throughouut. as Rasputin

will conjure up tLis minions from the iquary and sing

about Romanovs FINALE, he sends them off after Anya.

SONG TO INCORPORATE THE FOLLOWING SENTIMENTS:

He crushes the Anastasia doll in his massive hand.

Bartok land on the table while be's talking and his

wing accidently knocks the RELIQUARY on its side and

it begins to roll.

Rasputin makes a sad leap, grabbing it seconds before it

shatters on the floor.	Rasputin holds it up. The

smokey SPIRITS inside swirl around, moaning.

Rasputin spins an Bartok, who Us been slinki away, and

slams a goblet over his.

BARTOK'S POV

From under the glass, Rasputin looks distorted and even

more horrifying.

Rasputin smiles with his horrible yellow, decayed teeth,

and lifts the glass an if to whisper in Bartok, a ear.

The volume of Rasputin's voice rattles Bartok around the

inside of the glass. Rasputin focuses on the RELIQUARY.

Inside the reliquary the awoke begins to mow Suddenly,

the smoke EXPLODES in a burst and forms into the smoke

from a train engine. As the reliquary picture broadens,

we see a train and Anya, Dmitri and Vladimir all hurrying

to catch it.

Bartok looks desperate under glass. He trios to topple

the glass prism by jumping up but just cooks his head.

Rasputin gives his attention only to the reliquary.

Smoke begins to pour out of the reliquary. asput almost

giddy with the thought of finishing ambition, laughs

hysterically.

As Rasputin swirls his arms the smoke begins to form

into MINIONS. All look human at first, but then

we see MINION ONE, has the body of a human and a head of

a JACKAL, MINION TWO has the face of a woman and the

claws of a TIGER, and MINION- the most horrible

of all - has a huge bear-like body with the head of a

VULTURE. All wear long capes with hoods.

Rasputin kicks open the wagon door and leaps outside.

The MINIONS, still filling out into forms, follow.

One of the wisps of smoke, like a tail, swishes by and

knocks over Bartok's glass prism, freeing his.

EXT. GYPSY CAMP - NIGHT

Rasputin releases his BLACK HORSES who stoup -and

whinny, men ing something bad, as two Minions float

on to them the other flies ahead of than.

The Minions take off. Rasputin laughs wildy.

END MUSICAL NUMBER

INT. TATIANA'S STUDY, PARIS - DAY

CLOSE ON

TATIANA'S HANDS covering her face. Slowly dropping her

hands down to reveal an older, sad TATIANA.

PULL BACK

to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN standing in front of bar desk.

Sophie ushers the now ashamed YOUNG WOMAN to the door.

The YOUNG WOMAN looks amazing like Anya except that her

hair is long and her clothes are now. She walks with a

certain regal grace until she passes through the doorway -

out of Tatiana's sight - and her posture "question-marks"

and she lopes out.

Sophie. heavier and larger bottomed than ten years earlier,

speaks quickly - without ev er breathing, in a high

pitched nervous chitter.

XENIA and ESTELLE, as pinched and skinny as Sophie in

"full", don't appear to ever have been "touched" by

anything (or anyone).

Tatiana walks sadly out of the room.

EXT. TRAM STATION - MORNING

Anya and Metoo doze near a fire along with the other

PEASANTS waiting for the train. Dmitri looks over Vladimir's

shoulder nervously watching his forging their travel papers.

Vladimir looks at Dmitri's anxious face.

A TRAIN WHISTLE SLOWS and Vlad Moves to Anya.

Dmitri leans over and tugs Anya's hair lightly.

Anya's  eyes flash open and - totally on reflex - she belts

Dmitri in the nose. Ditri reels back,  lands on his butt -

Vladimir observes ruefully.

EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - SECONDS LATER

Vladimir, using his ample belly, bumps people out of the

way as they head for the train. Vlad climbs on just as

it starts up, followed	by Dmitri. Dmitri turns back and

reaches out his hand to help Anya up. But she

freezes... just STANDS THERE, not running.

ANYA'S POV

Dmitri on the train, his band extended - just like

Tatiana's was. Although Anya can't quite remember,

something about this terrifies bar. She snaps out

of it when Meetoo nips her ankle.

Anya looks down and sees the puppy, picks his up and

runs for the train.

Anya puts Meetoo into his hands and Jumps on without

touching his.

INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT

The compartment is JAMMED with travelers. Suitcases

and packages balanced precariously. Dmitri sits down

and carefully touches his painful noso.

OVER ANYA'S SHOULDER, out of the window. we see the

THREE MINIONS on horseback charging down a snow covered

hill toward the train.

Dmitri touches his nose again. Anya opens the window

and grabs some snow.	WE SEE the minions racing wildly

to catch up with the train. As the scene continues, we

see the minions,	by one, getting close to the train

and then disappear from	view - only their riderless

horses ride away.

Dmitri tries to act very manly as he puts the ice on his

nose, but cringes with the cold. Anya smiles.

An ELDERLY WOMAN loaded with packages cones into the

compartment. Anya immediately rises to help her.

Dmitri and Vlad both pull her back down.

Anya gives them both a look and helps the woman.

Vlad holds Meotoo, who is enthralled and plays with

Vladimir's drooping mustache, like a kitten with a string.

The COMPARTMENT DOOR swings open and an OMINOUS LOOKING

GUARD strides in!

Everyone rustles for their papers. Dmitri confidently

pulls out their papers, done in beautiful BLACK ink.

Then, he glances at the PERSON NEXT TO HIM and sees

that his papers are done in a bright RED ink. Dmitri

looks over at Vladimir - who has seen the mistake as well.

The guard hand papers back to a soulful looking man

with a frozen beard.

GUARD approaches Vlad and Dmitri.

Dmitri flashes the Guard a charming smile as he hands

over his papers. Vladimir is nervously playing with

his mustache until it stands out straight. Anya has

no idea what's going on.

As the Guard heads out of the compartment, Vlad turns

to Dmitri and they exchange an "oh, no" look.

INT. CORRIDOR, ANOTHER CAR

The MINIONS, hoods pulled low, push their way through

the PASSENGERS in search of Anastasia.

INT. CORRIDOR

Dmitri spots the GUARD conferring with the GUARDS

over the papers. Anya pokes bar head out.

Anya looks at him like he's crazy and walks away.

Dmitri runs back in and grabs his SMALL BACKPACK. He

pulls Vlad, carrying Meetoo, out off the compartment

Anya has a load on them as they follow.

INT TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

The GUARDS burst in, ready for an arrest. In the

background, the hooded Minions pass. The Guards,

seeing empty seats, head back out.

INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - ANOTHER CAR

Anya looks out the window as the country side flies by

and smiles.

INT. CORRIDOR

The Guards spot three figures at the far end of the car.

They run after who they think are the fugitives.

The Guard grabs a minion and spins him around.

It's MINION THREE, who comes face-to-beak with him

and lets out a HORRENDOUS SCREECH, causing the other

Minion to turn around. The Guards scream and reel backward,

pushing and shoving each other to got out of the way

The Minions proceed up the corridor, MINION TWO, spot

Anya looking out the window. He grabs her. palling her

viciously to the other Minions. She spins around - it

isn't Anya - it's a SERIOUSLY UGLY WOMAN. The Minions

now scream and reel back in horror.

INT. CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS

Dmitri and Vladimir catch up to Anya and grab her in

each arm, loading bar down the hall WE HEAR the MINIONS

SCREAM from the next car.

EXT. BETWEEN CARS

Anya. Dmitri and Vlad step out on a platform and see

there is no place left to run. Only the engine is

ahead of them.

He leaps up gracefully, grabbing the edge of the roof,

and pull& himself up.

as Dmitri's head, upside down, appears from the roof.

Vladimir picks Anya from up from tobehind and hoists

her up to Dmitri. She hollers.

EXT. TRAIN ROOF

Anya is pulled up by Dmitri, with a force that knocks

them both over Anya on top. An awkward moment. Anya

rolls off him as Dmitri tries to catch the breath she

knocked out of him.

Suddenly, Meetoo appears, as if he were flying and

lots out a little "retu". Vladimir has tossed his

up and Dmitri catches his, band his to Anya, and

reaches down to Vladimir.

INT. CORRIDOR

Though the window the Minions see Vladimir's legs

as he's being lifted.

INT. ROOF oF TRAIN

Dmitri struggles to got Vlad to the roof but he's

losing his grasp. Anya puts Meetoo down and reaches

to help the dangling Vlad. Even Meetoo helps by

pulling an Vladimir's  scarf .

EXT. PLATFORM

Minion one grabs for Vladimir's legs, just as

they disappear.

EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN

Dmitri and Anya let out a sigh of relief as Vlad in

safe, but it's short lived as they both SIMULTANEOUSLY

lot out a yell.

DMITRI & ANYA'S POV:

a TUNNEL rapidly approaching.

They hit the deck, Vlad on his back between Anya and

Dmitri.	Anya and Dmitri exchange a quick look as the

tunnel gets closer - Vladimir's stomach is sticking up

too high to clear the tunnel. They reach up together

and push down on his big belly, causing his eyes to

bulge

ON THE SIDE OF THE TRAIN

The minions, now climbing up the side are plunged into

total darkness.

ON THE ROOF

light hits as the train comes out of the tunnel.

Vlad lets out a gasp as they release his belly.

Just then a Minion hand reaches up over the edge.

Dmitri assumes it's a Guard.

Anya and Vlad follow Dmitri toward the back of the train.

ON THE MINIONS

now on the roof, seeing their prey in short distance.

ON ANYA AND THE OTHERS

running, without looking back. jumping from car to car,

passing Meetoo like a football. Vladiair makes a huge

running leap into the air...

INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT

As all PASSENGERS react to Vladimir's bulk hitting and

denting the coiling.

EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN

The TRAIN WHISTLE erupts and Anya glances back to see

her pursuers just as they are enveloped in the thick black

smoke of the engine. Behind them, Anya can another tunnel.

TUNNEL

They drop down, this time Vlad in on his stomach. Anya

and Dmitri realize his butt won't clear the tunnel.

They push it down.

ON THE MINIONS

An the smoke disappears, the Minions' eyes go wide when

they realize it's too late for them. The train roars the

tunnel as the MINIONS SMASH &"'not the sift of

the mountain in a COLORFUL BURST OF SMOKE from which

they were created.

INT. RASPUTIN'S WAGON - PARALLEL TIME

DISSOLVE TO

EXT.	ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

Rasputin stares at the scene in his reliquary, watching

his well laid plan *go up in smoke", and lots out a

simmering growl.

Anya is standing with her hands an her hips arguing

with Dmitri and Vladiair.

Dmitri motions that they are going to Jump. Anya shakes

her head slowly.

Dmitri shoves him off the top of the train with Meetoo

in his arm. Dmitri then puts out his hand to Anya.

Dmitri turns forward and sees the train is approaching

a HIGH RAILROAD BRIDGE over a rocky ravine. It's now

or never.

With his outstretched hand, Dmitri shoves her off the bar.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Vladimir has landed in a large pile of snow. He stands,

rubbing his bottom.

Meetoo comes out of the pile of leaves, rubbing his

bottom and answers Vladimir's with his "retu".

A short distance away, Anya seems to be sitting on

top of a puddle - but she isn't wet. Suddenly, Dmitri

gets up from underneath her, covered in snow. Anya

isn't wet because she landed on Dmitri! She jumps up.

Vladimir and Meetoo come over.

INT.	RASPUTIN'S WAGON

Rasputin paces, still angry at the Minions. Bartok,

nervous, fakes a yawn and stretches.

Well, I better got goin'. Got a busy day letting all

the blood rush to my head...

Rasputin pulls him back in, then speaks to his reliquary.

The reliquary glows eyes. Rasputin places It back in it's cabinet.

Rasputin smacks him against the wall as he stomps out

of the wagon. Bartok slides down the wall.

And he hits the floor.

EXT. GYPSY CAMP - MIGHT

Rasputin, on his obsessed mission, leaps on top of the

wagon as Bartok, still dizzy, tries to catch up.

Rasputin then looks down and sees that there are no horses

harnessed he gave then to the begins a slow growl.

EXT.	COUNTRY - BREAK OF DAWN

Anya is walking ahead with Vladiair as Dmitri follows

he's still muddy, wet and unhappy.

Meetoo is trying to catch fire flies in his mouth.

Anya stops dead in her tracks, this is the first she's

heard of this.

Dmitri, not paying attention, slams into the back

of Anya. Anya, not hurt, turns to Dmitri - who is

rubbing his now sore shoulder.

Anya searches for the -word as she sits down next

to a frozen pond.

Dmitri sits next to Anya and looks at her reflection

in the ice.

ANYA'S POV

her smudged face and boy's clothes. Dmitri's hands

come into frame, wipe off her face with snow and

them pull her hair off her face. Anya does, truly,

look pretty.

A POSSIBLE VLADIMIR SONG

Vladimir would begin to sing here, telling Anya that she

has a lot to learn. The music would probably have a

LIGHT, SOMEWHAT COMEDIC tone, and would be just a SHORT

SECTION OF SINGING, which would then SEGUE TO UNDERSCORE

for the scenes of instruction which follow.

We see the three of them from behind, walking down a

road - Meetoo trots behind them, happily.

EXT. SLEIGH - DAY

Vladimir is putting icicles in Anya's hair to keep it

up in a bun - she looks sweet, despite her boy's clothes.

She is reciting something to Dmitri.

Anya thinks as Dmitri looks at a long sheet of

paper, prompting her.

EXT. PIG CART - DAY

Anya, Dmitri and Vladimir are sitting in the back of a

pig cart traveling down a country road. The pigs are very

interested as Anya is pointing to different pieces of hay

which "set" her imaginary table.

Dmitri and Anya exchange a look and then laugh,

adding ad libs of "we can tell" and "There's a

fork you should have skipped". This is the first

time Dmitri and Anya have laughed together -

actually the first time he's ever seen her smile.

EXT.	PORT - DAY

Dmitri, who is sneaking around, pulling women's clothes

out of a suitcase that clearly isn't theirs! He takes

out a large, but pretty dress, a beautiful veil - and a

huge brassiere, which he quickly stuffs back in the

suitcase - somewhat frightened. He takes the dress and

veil puts it in his backpack and joins Vladimir and Anya

as they admire the ship.

Vladimir honestly can't remember, Anya thinks it's

another quiz.

Dmitri and  Vladimir exchange a quizzical look. No

one told her that...

Meetoo spots TWO UGLY PUG DOGS and a distinguished

ELDERLY DOWAGER. He runs happily to play with them.

She pulls her DOGS away from Meetoo.

They give him a disgusted look and walk away. Meetoo

looks a little hurt.

INT. HALLWAY OF THE SHIP - NIGHT

Dmitri and Vladimir are standing by a closed door.

Anya is on the other side.

The door opens and Anya comes out in the blue dress

Dmitri stole which at least ten sizes too big for her.

She is still wearing her hair up and despite the size

which actually gives her a "Kate Moss" waifish look

with her men's boots and baggy dress - the blue brings

out her eyes. Dmitri sees her and BUSTS OUT LAUGHING.

Anya storms back into the cabin and slam the door behind her.

INT.	CABIN - SIMULTANEOUS ACTION

When Anya storms into the cabin, she catches a glimpse of

herself in the mirror.

Just then, the slamming door catches the back of her dress,

pulling more than half of it into the door frame. She sees

in the mirror that the now fitted dress shows a lovely

woman's figure. Pleased, she looks at herself.

EXT.	CABIN DOOR - NIGHT

Vladimir and Dmitri wait outside the door. The door opens

and Anya appears, having tied the veil around the waist

of the dress, making it look fitted and beautiful. Dmitri

and Vladimir are surprised as Anya walks past them with

confidence and throws them a look over her shoulder.

"REPRISE OF VLADIMIR'S SONG (OVER MONTAGE)

The tone of the song would now change - - the older,

wiser person watching as two younger people are

unwittingly falling in love. The tone can still be

light, as are the visuals here, but there would be

an undercurrent of irony and romance. The song would

end as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary

embrace.

MONTAGE: (MOS)

ON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully

down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion.

Dmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion.

Anya looks back and flashes them a smile.

IN THEIR CABIN: Dmitri gets out of the bed he's

been sharing with Vlad and walks over, past where

Anya is sleeping peacefully, to close the port hole

against a cold wind. He closes is and see's Anya -

she looks beautiful - he bends down to pull up her

covers and she SLUGS him.

UNDER A TABLE: Meetoo is walking around sniffing

feet. Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY

PUG DOGS who growl at him. He runs away and finally

see's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine

shoes, with heels, that she has kicked off. Meetoo

grabs them in his mouth and runs.

ON DECK: The sea is calm, but Anya - wearing the heeled

shoes for the first time - is teetering and wobbling

like mad. Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement.

Anya turns to them.

ON DECK: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's

shoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him

with great vindication.

BALLROOM: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and

graceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir's arm and

completes a perfect curtsy in front of Dmitri. Dmitri

applauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks

him with her head accidently.

THEIR CABIN: Vladimir is directing Anya as she waltzes

gracefully in their swaying cabin. Dmitri enters and is

directed to join Anya. He does and they dance together,

with Anya clearly leading. The boat sways to the left

and Anya is thrown closer into Dmitri's arms. Neither

of them even try to readjust.

END MONTAGE

STILL IN THE SCENE

Vladimir walks over to Anya and nervously chatters (he

knows he interrupted something) as he leads her away

from Dmitri.

EXT. SEA - NIGHT

As a storm begins to whip up, the wind starts to howl

and the waves become more violent.

REVERSE ANGLE

just as a BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES the water, we see

Rasputin's face.

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

The storm is pitching the boat wildly. Vladimir is

sleeping, snoring loudly. Meetoo, sound asleep, is

sliding from side of the cabin to the other. Anya

is looking out the small port hole at the violent

sea when Dmitri, carrying his back pack, sits on the

bed next to her.

Dmitri takes out the music box and hands it to Anya.

She is immediately taken by it, something about it ...

Dmitri goes back over to his bed. Anya sees through

him and knows how much it all did matter to him.

EXT.	SEA CLIFF - NIGHT

The wagon sits on the edge of a high cliff. Rasputin

stands on the top of his wagon, staring at the sea

demonically. The jagged bolts of lightening and the

icy silver rain make him look all the more menacing.

The wind parts his beard and we see Bartok hanging

upside down in it, trying to stay out of the storm.

Rasputin's eyes light up as if he just thought of the

answer to his own question. Bartok is thrown out of his

beard when he makes a sudden turn and leaps off the

wagon. Bartok follows.

Rasputin steps in

INT.	WAGON - NIGHT

As Bartok continues, Rasputin moves to the

reliquary's cabinet.

in

IMAGES, horrifying and frightening, begin to spin

into a small tornado. Rasputin throws open the door

and the TORNADO bursts out streaking across the water.

EXT.	SEA CLIFF - NIGHT

Rasputin follows tornado to the cliff and watches

as it disappears into the horizon of the water.

Lightning and thunder crash as he laughs maniacally.

INT.	CABIN - NIGHT

which is swaying with the storm. PAN past Vladimir,

snoring, his now limp mustache flopping wildly and

past Dmitri, sleeping restlessly. Move to Anya, who

seems quite content.

From under the door SMOKY IMAGES silently slither.

They float across the cabin and swirl around Anya.

CLOSE ON:

Anya's CLOSED EYES as the SMOKY IMAGES seem to enter

her head. She smiles in her sleep and we are in ANYA'S

DREAM. . .

EXT.	FOREST - DAY

Anya, in a beautiful white dress, is walking peacefully

through a sunny part of a lovely forest on a spring day.

She reaches down to pick some pretty flowers, then looks

up as it seems to get dark... OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS cover

the sun. Anya reaches down for another flower when she

HEARS A GROWL.

Anya spins to see an ENORMOUS BEAR emerge from the trees.

(All the animals in the dream sequence have a SLIGHT

resemblance to Rasputin.) Anya is frozen with fear as MORE

BEARS emerge and head straight for her. She tries to back

away as the beautiful FLOWERS GROW LONG AND HORRIBLE THORNS

and wrap around her ankles, impeding her escape.

It gets darker as the BEAR'S EYES, glowing yellow, multiply

and move closer. Anya pulls free of the flowers and rushes

to the safety of a large tree  She climbs the tree and

escapesthe bears. Looking down, from her perch on a sturdy

branch, the ground seems miles away.

Suddenly, the BRANCH JOLTS her and almost falling, she hold

HER - no longer a tree branch, but A HUGE UGLY SNAKE with

red eyes and huge fangs that come right for her!

Anya leaps to another branch, which also turns into a snake.

She jolts backward and begins to fall ... toward a HUNDRED

YELLOW EYES, FIFTY BLOOD RED MOUTHS AND THOUSANDS OF SHARP

TEETH. As Anya falls, she lets out a SILENT SCREAM.

A BURST OF SUNLIGHT

as Anya lands in a field of soft GOLDEN WHEAT. Unharmed

and very relieved, she stands and looks around at the

beautiful sunny wheat field.

INT. CABIN

Reality. Anya's eyes are closed as she smiles in her

sleep and sits up in bed. TINY WISPS of smoke still

swirl around her head. As she gets out of bed, she

unintentionally steps on Meetoo's tail, waking him.

Meetoo watches as the sleeping Anya opens the cabin door

and walks out.

Meetoo rises to follow Anya but the ship pitches, sending

him sliding across the cabin floor.

EXT. DECK - NIGHT

Anya walks out on the deck, the ship pitching violently

in the storm, as she smiles.

IN HER DREAM

Anya is walking through the wheat field to the edge of

a BLUFF. A few yards below the bluff, Anya sees a beautiful

little pond where a FAMILY frolic's in the clear water;

laughing, splashing, swiming happily. Anya climbs over a

low flowering wall to look closer.

PULL BACK

REALITY: Anya has climbed over the railing of the deck

and is looking into the black ocean... smiling.

DISSOLVE TO:

A SMOKY IMAGE OF THE SAME SCENE

It's RASPUTIN'S POV as he watches his plan unfold in the

reliquary.

INT. CABIN

Meetoo finally rights himself from his slide across the

floor and begins to bark into Dmitri's ear.

EXT. DECK

Anya is waving happily at the dangerous water.

IN HER DREAM

Anya is waving to the FAMILY. They turn around toward

her and she sees that it's the ROMONOV FAMILY, from

the frieze that she saw in the palace. She is delighted

to see them as she feels a distance recollection of who

they are to her.

INT. CABIN

Meetoo jumps up and NIPS at Dmitri's hand. Dmitri leaps

up with an "owwww!" and looks over at the excited Meetoo.

Dmitri looks over to Anya's bed - she isn't sits up and

throws his legs over the side

EXT. DECK

Anya is standing right on the edge of death...

IN HER DREAM

She isn't there. He of his bed.

the FAMILY is waving to her. NICHOLAS waves for her to

jump into the clear pond and join them. Anya nods and

moves to jump in...

EXT. DECK

Anya gets ready to jump into the violent and icy black

waves. She takes one step out when... DMITRI GRABS HER

SHOULDERS.

Anya JOLTS awake from her dream. Confused at first,

then terrified to see what almost happened to her.

isn't lifts her to the other side of the railing

and looks at her.

Anya puts her hands to her mouth in shock, shaking

and almost crying with fear, she throws her arms

around Dmitri and holds him tightly.

Dmitri is surprised at first, but tightens his arms

around her.

They stand steady on the deck in a tight embrace,

their feelings for each other are stronger than the storm.

DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAME, as seen through the reliquary

Rasputin watches ... seething quietly, as Bartok peeks

meekly over his shoulder.

Rasputin studies Dmitri in the reliquary - Dmitri and

Anya still in a warm embrace.

But Rasputin's not interested, he stares into the

reliquary and speaks directly to it.

The reliquary, as if in answer, seem to be chuckling.

Rasputin smiles and joins in with it.

Rasputin returns the reliquary to its cabinet.

EXT. BOAT DOCK (LA HAVRE) - DAY

As Anya walks down the plank her dress gets caught

on a nail. Dmitri is walking toward her as she yanks her

dress free and accidentally punches him in the stomach.

Dmitri takes it like a man.

Vlad has been watching as he walks down the plank

with Meetoo - they exchange an "oh boy" look, both

noticing that clearly something is different between

Anya and Dmitri. Anya catches something out of the

corner of eye and turns quickly.

CLOSE ON a sign: "Paris 30 kilometers"

Anya walks away from Dmitri and over to the sign

and looks at it longingly.

AT THE OTHER END OF THE DOCK

Vladimir stares into his purse, depressed.

As he says this the ELDERLY DOWAGER from the ship

passes by with her TWO OBNOXIOUS PUG DOGS. Meetoo

growls as Vlad and Dmitri get an idea.

Vladimir picks up Meetoo and whispers instructions.

Meetoo likes the plan.

NEW ANGLE

as Meetoo races past the PUGS. They ignore him, so he

stops and makes a face, giving them a sloppy "razzberry",

which piques them a little. Meetoo then bends over and

waves his furry little butt at them. Now the PUGS are

offended and TAKE OFF after him, yapping all the way.

Meetoo turns and scrambles with the Pugs in hot pursuit.

As they get closer, Meetoo SUDDENLY STOPS and the Pugs

go FLYING OFF they edge of the dock and into the water

below. Meetoo looks over the edge and gives them a 'Boy,

are you guys morons look as the ELDERLY DOWAGER runs

up screaming.

Dmitri comes running up, a little too gallant.

Dmitri dives into the water as Vlad rushes up behind

the Elderly Dowager. Anya watches from a distance as

Dmitri climbs out of the water carrying the soaked

(and pissed) Pugs.

MINUTES LATER

Dmitri hands Vlad a pile of FRANCS as Anya approaches.

She gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks away with

Meetoo, who turns back and gives Dmitri a look. A

little guilty, Dmitri turns to Vlad.

EXT.	GRAND OPEN CAR - DAY

Traveling is style! Vladimir is driving - badly - with

Meetoo in the front seat. Meetoo covers his eyes. Dmitri

and Anya are in the open back seat, enjoying the beautiful

French countryside.

Dmitri looks over at Anya.

Anya smiles at Dmitri, knowing that all the confidence

she has is because of him. She takes his hand but

looks away.

EXT. TATIANA'S PARIS HOUSE - DAY

They pull up in front of the beautiful white house.

Anya is nervous as Vladimir walks up to the front door

ahead of Dmitri and Anya. Vladimir knocks. Sophie

answers the door.

She moves with grace and regal poise.

Anya looks to Dmitri, a little confused by that last

comment. Dmitri makes a little "she's slightly crazy"

signal.

They all leap to avoid her butt as she bustles into

the house.

INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY

Sophie, flanked by her sisters, sits at a table. Anya,

looking nervous but poised, sits across while Dmitri and

Vladimir hover nervously at the far end of the room.

Sophie's PAT CAT, TILLIE, attempts to cuddle up next to

Meetoo, who wants nothing to do with her.

Sophie opens a huge book that SLAMS open. Vlad and

Dmitri jump.

SCENE CONTINUES MOS

TIME LAPSE MONTAGE

Dmitri watches Anya answer questions gracefully and

without hesitating. Anya smiles as her answers begin

to surprise Sophie.

Sophie and the sisters look tired. Sophie has her last

question.

Dmitri and Vladimir exchange a nervous look. It's

obvious they never briefed Anya on this one.

Anya thinks a moment, then looks up, smiling, as

she remembers ...

Dmitri is shocked. He know this is Anastasia Romonov

and he can't believe it.

CLOSE ON

Dmitri, as he stares at Anya as Sophie prattles on.

MINUTES LATER

Anya sits near the window, stroking Tillie ...

much to the consternation of a jealous Meetoo.,

She looks out the window and sees Dmitri, deep

in thought, wandering in the garden.

OUT OF HER EARSHOT at the other end of the room,

Vladimir speaks to Sophie.

She rises heading towards Anya. Her butt knocks over

a vase, which Vladimir deftly catches.

EXT. GARDEN

Vladimir has finished giving Dmitri the details.

Both are ecstatic.

Anya gratefully kisses Dmitri an the cheek and

runs into the house. Vladimir, who's been watching,

has a warning.

Dmitri understands this and is devastated. Vladimir pats

him on the back as he walks into the house.

MUSIC BEGINS: BRIGHT, EXCITING, PARIS IN THE TWENTIES

Anya and Dmitri, followed by Vlad and Sophie are walking

down the Champs Elysees. Meetoo trots along after them,

happily. They walk by AN ACCORDION PLAYER and a LADY FLOWER

SELLER, who watch them and whisper to each other.

"PARIS HOLDS THE KEY TO YOUR HEART" (PRODUCTION NUMBER)

In UPTEMPO "PARIS IN THE TWENTIES style MUSIC, the people of

Paris ALL SING, welcoming Anya and Dmitri, Sophie and Vlad,

to Paris!

The foursome explores the city and Anya has the

happiest day of her young life. On the streets they

encounter the motley denizens of Paris, as well as

people with very familiar faces -- for anyone in the

audience in the know, they'll see Josephine Baker,

Maurice Chevalier, Rodin, Gertrude Stein, Freud,

Lindbergh - people who were in Paris in the twenties..

For those in the audience who don't recognize them,

they'll simply be unidentified fascinating "types" who SING.

As the joyous number progresses, we realize that Dmitri

is feeling something else -- the impending loss of Anya

to a world where she clearly is at home. He SINGS for a

short moment, knowing that he's about to lose her. Anya

visits a couturier and comes out with a big dress box

for her evening at the ballet. A BIG FINALE as they go

off for the evening. Even Meetoo has found some female

poodle companionship. But for one last beat, Dmitri's

wistfulness cuts against joy.

END MUSICAL NUMBER

EXT. PARIS SKYLINE - DUSK

A glorious sunset over the city of lights ...

PAN DOWN

next to the Seine River. Rasputin's wagon is

parked on the edge.

showing Rasputin trying to concentrate on the reliquary.

Rasputin leans closer to the reliquary, which now contains

the BRIGHTEST COLORS we've seen. The reliquary sits in

it's cabinet.

The reliquary BRIGHTENS even more, looking as if it could

burst.

The lightsin the reliquary shake, as if to say "yes".

Rasputin slams the cabinet shut, then turns to see Bartok

in front of a mirror. He wears a smart BLACK BERET which

is much too large on him.

EXT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT

Sweet, small french hotel on a winding cobble stone street

of the Left Bank.

INT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT

Dmitri and Vladimir are both dressed in formal attire and

look extremely dapper. Vlad is delighted with himself,

modeling his finery, but Dmitri looks very sad.

They turn as the door opens and Anya stands nervously,

but then strikes a regal pose. She looks magnificent ...

radiant, which is not lost on Dmitri.

Before Vladimir can gush, Dmitri, forced to repress his

true feelings, is a bit curt and rises.

Anya looks surprised by his tone, but follows.

EXT.	PARIS OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

As the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE OF PARIS pull up in carriages and

automobiles.

INT.	PARIS OPERA HOUSE

As Dmitri, Vladimir and Anya take their seats, all around

them people are whispering "Who's that?", "What a beautiful

woman", etc. The Ballet begins.

ANYA'S POV

Dancers in bright costumes leap across the stage.

Dmitri turns to Anya and gestures to the box seats to the

left. He hands her the opera glasses.

Anya gives Dmitri a very nervous look and takes the glasses,

aiming them toward Tatiana.

ANYA'S POV

The majestic Tatiana, flanked by Sophie and her sisters and

backed by several large GUARDS in uniform.

The music continues as Anya looks at Tatiana.

INTERMISSION

The lights come up and people around them begin to stand

up, stretch, etc. Dmitri turns to Anya.

INT. MEZZANINE -- MINUTES LATER

They approach Tatiana's private box.

DMITRI Wait here for just a moment. I'll go in first and

prepare her. It's bound to be a shock...

Dmitri opens the door into Tatiana's private box. Anya

waits nervously outside.

INT.	PRIVATE BOX

Dmitri walks up to the guards standing at the top of three

small steps into the box seats.

[PAGE MISSING]

The guards physically force Dmitri out, in spite of his

urgent pleas.

Dmitri is thrown out of the box and straight into Anya,

who stares at him with tears in her eyes. She then turns

and runs away.

INT. LOBBY

Anya pushes her way through the CROWD with Dmitri in pursuit.

EXT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

Anya bursts out of the doors followed by Dmitri

EXT.	PARIS OPERA

Dmitri runs out and stands by grand looking automobiles

lined up in front. He scans the cars.

DMITRI'S POV

Tatiana is walking toward her car. A very proper CHAUFFEUR

holds the door for her.

The CHAUFFEUR helps Tatiana in, then is about to climb

into the front seat when Dmitri rushes up to him.

As he gets out to look, Dmitri slides into the drivers

seat and roars away. The stunned Chauffeur in his dust.

INT. CAR

Tatiana is jolted by the fast motion of her car.

Dmitri turns from the front seat and looks at her.

EXT.	PARIS STREETS

Tatiana's car flying down small streets.

INT.	TATIANA'S  CAR

The car slams to. a stop in front of the SMALL HOTEL.

Dmitri leans into the back seat, face-to-face with her.

Tatiana is frightened, but still very stubborn. She looks

away from him. Dmitri thrusts the music box into her hands.

Tatiana looks down and is immediately taken aback.

your was your granddaughter!

Tatiana turns away from him again.

Dmitri points up to the open window of the hotel.

Tatiana finally looks out the window.

TATIANA'S POV

Anya holding Meetoo in front of the window.

BACK TO TATIANA

reacting to how much she looks like Anastasia.

INT. SMALL HOTEL -- A MINUTE LATER

Anya hears a KNOCK and assumes it is Dmitri.

The door opens slowly. Anya spins, then softens when she

sees Tatiana holding the MUSIC BOX.

Tatiana holds out the music box.

Tatiana notices Anya nervously playing with the key around

her neck. Tatiana reacts when she sees the key.

Anya sees her looking at the key around her neck.

UNDERSCORE-	"THE MUSIC BOX THEME"

Tatiana holds out her hands as Anya takes off the key

and hands it to her.

Anya takes the music box and the key out of Tatiana's

hand gently - remembering how it works. Anya puts in the

key and begins to wind it. Tatiana is surprised that Anya

knows how it works - so is Anya!

We hear THE MUSIC BOX begin to play.

Their cracking voices trail off as they look at each other

and know that they are who they've been searching for -

and the search is finally over.

Tatiana and Anya throw their arms around each other, both

crying, both overjoyed.

TATIANA Anastasia! Anastasia! You've come home at last!

You've come home ...

OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

Dmitri watches Anya and Tatiana's embrace. He smiles sadly,

then turns and walks down the dark street alone.

EXT. ANYA'S WINDOW

Bartok slides his way out to the window ledge. Overcome with

emotion, he is crying big bat tears.

EXT. RASPUTIN'S WAGON - NIGHT

Hideous fat river rats, ferocious looking and scarred,

stop and tremble nervously when

Bartok catapults across the frame, having been thrown out

of the window so hard that when he hits the stone wall of

the river bank, the stones crack.

INT. ANYA'S BEDROOM IN TATIANA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Anya snuggles down into the thick covers as Tatiana

strokes her hair gently.

Anya closes her eyes as Tatiana continues to stroke her hair.

Anya is asleep as Tatiana kisses her forehead, turns off

the light and walks to the door. She looks back on her

sleeping granddaughter with enormous joy and gratitude.

She smiles to herself as she pulls the door closed

behind her, revealing RASPUTIN STANDING BEHIND THE DOOR.

His eyes glow like embers in the dark. Bartok is perched

on his shoulder.

Rasputin takes the reliquary from around his waist and

places it on the table.

He waves his hand and the smoke emerges, emanating toward

the walls.

CLOSE ON

some CHERUBS as the smoke hits them. They begin to change,

taking on a lean and evil look. Their tiny arrows grow,

becoming lethal, as their eyes turn from soft brown to

blood red. Slowly, they EMERGE from the wallpaper, their

small wings growing into horrible pterodactyl membranous

paired appendages.

They SWOOP into flight and begin to circle the room, faster

and faster. Rasputin leans precariously over the sleeping

Anya, chuckling.

Rasputin backs away as the cherubs aim their JAGGED ARROWS

at Anya.

Suddenly, Meetoo leaps up from the bed, barking. Rasputin,

startled, jumps backward. Bartok falls off his shoulder and

on to the table, knocking into the reliquary - which is about

to fall.

Rasputin catches it. The SPELL is immediately broken and

everything turns back to normal just as Anya wakes up. She

sees Rasputin and lets out a SCREAM.

Rasputin advances on her, his hands outstretched as if to

strangle her when he hears footsteps and voices in the hallway.

Rasputin grabs the reliquary and LEAPS out the window, his

monk's robe billowing just as the door opens.

Tatiana rushes in and sees Bartok flying out the window.

She embraces Anya, who is still terrified and knows

that she saw what she saw.

INT.	TATIANA'S HOUSE - DAY

Anya sits, looking a bit vacant as two overly French

jewelers, PIERRE & ANDRE, fit Anya for her ROYAL CROWN.

Tatiana sits across from Anya and can't help but notice

that Anya looks miserable as Sophie bustles about.

The slight is lost on Sophie who bustles out talking to herself.

"RULERS OF RUSSIA" (COMIC REPRISE)

Sophie SINGS as COMIC REPRISE of 'RULERS OF RUSSIA"

Pierre and Andre argue as they fit Anya for the crown.

As they discuss this, Anya wanders away from them, the crown

still slightly askew on her head. Tatiana follows her.

But Anya simply nods. Tatiana turns her towards a FULL LENGTH

MIRROR, then straightens the crown as they look at their

reflections.

But before Anya can answer, Vladimir leans into the room.

Tatiana leaves and Vladimir looks at Anya. Anya, angry

at him, turns away.

Anya still won't look at him.

INT. TATIANA'S STUDY

Tatiana walks into her study and is happy to see Dmitri

is standing there, looking nervous and very uncomfortable.

He leaps from his chair, exploding with emotion.

Dmitri flips his hair out of his eyes and Tatiana gets

a look of recognition across her face.

Tatiana looks at him with great understanding and affection

as she realizes,

Dmitri comes down the steps, then stops when he sees Anya,

wearing her CROWN.

She turns and sees him, stifling her first impulse, then

putting on a show of supreme confidence.

With nothing left to say, he heads for the door.

Dmitri spins, but restrains. He opens the door and

Anya goes back into the Parlor. They both know that

they will never see each other again.

INT.	LITTLE HOTEL - DAY

Dmitri busily tosses his few possessions into his

backpack as Vladimir - in formal attire - waves an

embossed INVITATION at him.

Vladimir starts to protest. Dmitri grabs the invitation

and tears it up, tossing the pieces into the air.

Vladimir sighs.

NEW POV

from outside the window. WE DO NOT HEAR THEM, but we

see Vlad and Dmitri hug good-bye.

PULL RACK

to see it's RASPUTIN'S POV; as he stands on a LADDER

OF SMOKE, looking into Dmitri's window. Rasputin watches

Vladimir leave as Dmitri finishes packing.

INT.	DMITRI'S ROOM

As the windows BURST OPEN and Rasputin swoops in. Dmitri

backs away, terrified as the ladder dissolves and smoke

fills the room.

Dmitri backs away as the smoke coils around him and

Rasputin advances.

Dmitri lunges for him but the smoke coils around

him like rope, holding him back.

The SMOKE forms into hands, forcing Dmitri's face

toward Rasputin's. Dmitri's eyes widen. Rasputin

locks on him with his eyes, glowing like red hot

coals, as he bears Dmitri in hypnotically.

ON BARTOK

who looks away, obviously not enjoying this.

As WE HEAR Rasputin repeat "You are going to

help me" a few more times.

EXT.	EIFFEL TOWER - NIGHT

Magnificently, the Eiffel Tower illuminates all of

Paris when FLOOD LIGHTS come on and we see a LARGE

PARTY has been set underneath it's black iron legs.

WE HEM TRUMPETS as we

MOVE IN CLOSER

to see that a stage has been set up on the north side,

the "Seine side". of the Tower, with a large throne-like

chair in the center. Beautiful PARTY GUESTS,  many we

had seen in the opening Ballroom scene, mingle around

excitedly. Behind the stage, a beautiful curtain separates

the party from

INT. BEHIND THE CURTAIN

the Princess Anastasia, in crown and full coronation gown.

Anastasia fidgets nervously, looking for the key around

her neck, then remembering it isn't there anymore, as a

MAJOR RUSSIAN DOMO addresses her and Tatiana.

Tatiana sees that Anastasia isn't listening and dismisses

the Major Domo in mid sentence.

Major Domo bows and leaves. Tatiana looks at Anastasia.

Anya turns to her in confusion.

Anya is cut off with a quick knock at the door,

as Sophie and Vladimir enter, bowing to them both.

Vladimir has Meetoo, all dressed up in bows and

ribbons - and looking miserable - on a leash.

Tatiana is troubled by this news. Anya starts

laughing when she sees Meetoo.

Anya is shocked, she takes a minute to process this as

To Anya's dismay, Vlad and Sophie bow and back out of the room.

Tatiana gestures to the formality outside.

Tatiana kisses her on the forehead.

Tatiana turns to leave.

Tatiana leaves. Anya is very torn. Anya jumps as

the TRUMPETS sound announcing her entrance.

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

The COURTIERS gather, excited, as the Major Domo

readies to make his announcement.

INT. ANTE ROOM (EIFFEL TOWER)

Anya, thinking about what Tatiana has said, looks

at herself in the mirror.

ANYA'S POV

the Princess Anastasia. But not Anya.

Pause.	WE HEAR mummers from the crowd outside, various

"Where's Anastasia?", then

Anya spins around, looking for him. His voice seems

distant and ghostly,

Anya follows his voice out of the room and into the

ELEVATOR. The doors close.

EXT. ELEVATOR

as it rises gently to the very top of the Eiffel Tower

not on cables - but on long ropes of smoke.

EXT.	TOP OF EIFFEL TOWER

Rasputin, gleeful, sits perched on a girder, looking down

at the party below.

Rasputin leans over the rail and looks down at the party.

Rasputin chuckles at his own "wit"

ON THE ELEVATOR

As the door open and Anya rushes out, looking around.

Dmitri is standing - like a zombie - at the far end

of the platform. Anya sees him.

She stops. She can tell that something isn't right

with Dmitri by the look in his eyes.

Dmitri approaches her slowly, zombie-like, arms

outstretched.

Anya looks up at the booming voice.

ANYA'S POV

sees Rasputin.

BACK TO ANYA: FLASHES, RAPID IMAGES:

RASPUTIN from the last night at the palace

YOUNG ANASTASIA - TERRIFIED

ORANGE flash of gunshots

YOUNG DMITRI leading them out the wall panel, then the

Face of the YOUNG DMITRI superimposes over the zombie who

is coming toward her.

Dmitri stops. His eyes glazed and frightening.

Anya holds her ground as Dmitri moves toward her,

ready to push her off the

edge.

As Dmitri come close, she moves toward him and

kisses him. He blinks and snaps out of it and is

quite happy that Anya is kissing him.

WE HEAR a howl from above and suddenly Rasputin

jumps down. The reliquary tied to his waist, he's

more furious than we've ever seen him - his face

literally consumed with rage and hatred.

Anya is terrified - but holds her ground as she did

when she was a child.

Rasputin walks slowly toward Anya and Dmitri, burning with rage.

Dmitri pushes Anya away and charges the much larger

Rasputin, who knocks his aside with on swoop of big

huge arm.

Rasputin turns to Anya climbing up a girder.

Anya turns suddenly and kicks Rasputin in the face,

which has the same effect as kicking a brick wall.

Anya is thrown off balance and falls. Rasputin pushes

her with his foot and she slides across the floor to

Dmitri.

Anya and Dmitri exchange a quick look as Rasputin,

chuckling, advances on them. Anya reaches up and grabs

Rasputin's beard, pulling his face forward so that

Dmitri can give him a good roundhouse punch.

The blow does little but enrage Rasputin. He reaches

out and with one huge hand, picks Anya like a rag doll

and takes her to the ledge.

Dmitri throws himself against Rasputin several times

only to get batted away like a fly. Realizing this is

futile, Dmitri slips through the FLOOR GIRDERS and

scurries towards the edge... BELOW TEM.

DMITRI POV: Rasputin's large boots above him, heading

for the edge.

ABOVE

Rasputin reaches the edge, playful dangling the

struggling Anya over the side.

Anya looks over the ledge.

ANYA'S POV

The city below as she FALLS. Dmitri emerges from the

grid below and GRASS her, holding on to the back of

her dress.

She manages to spin around, gripping his hand.

CLOSE

their hands, gripping one another.

They look up to see his right above them. Rasputin's

boot SMASHES DOWN on Dmitri's hand, which grips the

girder.

Dmitri screams out	in, but doesn't let go. He

looks down at Anya and pulls her up while Rasputin

begins to pry off Dmitri's fingers one at a time.

Anya swings to another beam and now has firm footing as

Rasputin continues.

Dmitri is literally holding on with two fingers.

As Dmitri's last finger is preyed away, he falls but

his grasp on Anya's hand is firm and she pulls him

onto where she is standing.

Rasputin leans over and bends toward them, three feet

from Anya.

The reliquary is dangling. Anya reaches up to grab on to

it but her aim is off and she HITS it. The reliquary flies

and SMASHES against the side of the tower, shattering.

Rasputin realizes what has happened and scrambles away

in terror.

ON BARTOK

who covers his eyes.

ON ANYA AND DMITRI

who climb back up to the platform.

LONG SHOT

of the Eiffel Tower as the EVIL SPIRITS FROM THE

RELIQUARY burst out. The SPIRITS take on all the forms

we've seen earlier: BEARS, MINIONS, SNAKES, and

combinations of all. They grow and swirl, with hideous

MOANING noises.

Anya and Dmitri huddle together, in disbelief.

ON RASPUTIN

as the SPIRITS begin to swarm around him, a TORNADO of

horrid beings. Re screams as they pull him off the

ground.

ON ANYA AND DMITRI

as the force of the tornado increases, they have to

hold on to the girders and each other in order not to

be sucked in. Bartok is thrown against the side of the

tower and slithers to the floor.

ON RASPUTIN

suspended over the Eiffel Tower in the maelstrom. He

Screams wildly as the spirits encircle his, torment

him and EXPLODE - pieces fly and disintegrate in mid-air,

in wild colors and smoke.

ON DMITRI AND ANYA

who hug each other in relief. They stand, looking out.

The smoke dissipates, showing them the city lights below.

ON BARTOK

who rises, patting his chest- He's about to let out

a Bartokism... but all the emerges are LITTLE BAT SQUEAKS.

He's surprised as first, then thrilled. The spell is

broken and he's just a bat again.

DMITRI AND ANYA

as he reaches down and picks up the crown that fell off

her head in the fight. He hands it to her.

Anya looks lovingly at Dmitri and doesn't put the crown back on.

"HONE IS WHERE YOU ARE"

(The Love Duet For Anya And Dmitri). A SIMPLE EMOTIONAL

BALLAD for two people who realize at last that their hearts

have led then to each other, to "home". This will work within

the dramatic context of the film (sung by the characters) but

can also be re-recorded as a Pop single.

The song continues over various scenes:

THE EMPTY STAGE

Tatiana smiling, knowingly.

SOPHIE & VLADIMIR

sneaking a kiss in the middle of the party. Xenia and Estelle

look at each other with their stone faces.. . and smile.

BARTOK

Hanging from the rafters of the Eiffel Tower, no sure what

to do next - then a cute female bat flies up next to his and

"bats" her eyes.

ANYA & DMITRI

walking over the River bridge with Meetoo following behind

them... a family - going home together.

FADE OUT

THE END
