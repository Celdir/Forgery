A FADED KODACHROME PHOTO

Of the 9 best (11-year-old) buddies that ever lived. On a

makeshift baseball diamond - a sandlot... circa 1962:

SCOTTY SMALLS, studious-looking; ALAN "YEAH-YEAH" McCLENNAN,

little, hyper; HAMILTON "HAM" PORTER, tubby with a huge smile;

KENNY DeNUNEZ, handsome bean pole; TOMMY "REPEAT" TIMMONS and

his brother TIMMY; BERTRAM GROVER WEEKS, wearing inch- thick

horn rims; JEFF "SQUINTS" PALLEDOROUS, a transistor radio

plug wedged in his ear; and BENNY RODRIGUEZ, leaning on

Scotty's shoulder, sporting the world's all-time hottest

sneakers... P.F. Flyers.

One palm up, together like the 9 musketeers they're holding

forward a baseball... with a mysterious smudge.

WE CLOSE IN TIGHT on the black smudge, which becomes:

Many hands miming mechanical contraptions.

EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - DAY

The gang hurries out from the Timmons' yard carrying a broom

stick. They wriggle it under the fiberglass fence. Squints

peers through the peep hole motioning directions to Ham.

Suddenly - SNAP! Ham pulls the stick back. 'Tis toothpick'd.

The room is dark. Benny's in bed. He clicks on a "baseball-

illuminating the photo of The Babe.

Suddenly, a RACKET from inside Benny's closet. A bright LIGHT

GOES ON in there. Then, smoke comes out.

Benny jumps up on his bed - flattens against the wall. Hasn't

done this in years:

The closet door CREAKS open... by itself. Everything inside

is oddly devoid of color.

BABE RUTH steps out of the closet. He exists in the only way

any kid from 1962 has ever seen him: BLACK & WHITE.

The Great Bambino PUFFS on a massive stogie... the source of

all the smoke.

Benny comes off the wall. The enormous Ruth towers over him.

The Babe turns to go back to wherever he came from. Benny

grabs his arm - shocked that he actually feels something

"real."

The Babe disappears back into the closet, then:

Fairly spartan, except for one room, where it seems that Mr.

THE BASEBALL ROOM

Mr. Mertle sits at a table. Benny and Scotty stare at the

tabletop.

It holds a scale model Baseball Diamond: green felt field and

little bases, outfield wall and miniature player figures. A

picture on the wall of Mr. Mertle and Babe Ruth.

The picture is signed: "To Thelonius Johnson Mertle, the second

greatest slugger I ever saw... Babe Ruth."

A baseball game on the RADIO. As each play is CALLED, Mr.

Mertle's hands deftly put his tiny players in the correct

positions. Mr. Mertle is blind.

Mr. Mertle brushes his fingers over the leather.

Mr. Mertle shakes his head... hands the ball to Scotty.

On the RADIO, Wills steals second.

Benny moves the little figure to second base.

Mr. Mertle retrieves something from a glass case. A baseball.

He hands his baseball to Scotty... Benny stares at it in

disbelief.

As they ogle the ball:

Scotty hands Mr. Mertle the chewed up Babe Ruth ball. Shakes

his hand.

On the RADIO, Maury Wills steals 3rd for his 100th stolen

base. Scotty notices the wall clock:

over Scotty. The gang hangs their heads.

Benny unpockets a little felt bag. Hands it to Scotty. He

holds the bag up to a perplexed Bill, who opens it. He looks

from Scotty to Benny and back again. Then...

...stares down at the "Murderers' Row" ball.

EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

A BASEBALL sailing through the air. SMACK! it's caught in a

brand new glove. Scotty's new glove. Scotty snap throws the

ball back to Bill. He and Scotty are having a great game of

catch.

Bill and Scotty smile as they fire the cowhide back and forth.

Scotty's mom sticks her head out the back door. She smiles,

watching her "two boys" toss the ball around.
