EXT. SPACE

A small planet glows in the light of its sun. Suddenly, we

hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind

the planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the

planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction.

Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it.

EXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE

Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a

wild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as

Vesuvius erupted.

ANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING

The creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very

different context, but for now, he is running from the ever-

growing mist that threatens to engulf him.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC

As Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him.

ANGLE ON KRANIX

The mist threatens to engulf him too. He transforms into a

small rocket ship and...

TRACK WITH KRANIX AS...

He takes off. As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere,

we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious

Unicron. The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava

leak out. The energy cloud surrounds it and... Dissolves

everything... ... And when the smoke clears, we get our

first look at Unicron. It is horrifying. A massive, metal orb

with a gaping maw and a field of electricity.

CONTINUED:

PAN FORWARD to SHOW that this hideous planet is on a direct

collision course with...

MOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE

There are TWO MECHANISTIC MOONS orbiting the huge planet

Cybertron. But we are most concerned with a small, greenish

metal one.

CLOSER ON GREEN MOON

At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. Then,

pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered

with moon camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge

cache of futuristic weapons. This is the Autobot staging

ground for an assault on Cybertron. DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX

until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots

peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on

Cybertron.

ANGLE ON IRONHIDE

He peers into a monitor. As he speaks, we see the monitor

PAN to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned

on Cybertron.

ANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME

He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion

plans for Cybertron.

ANGLE ON PRIME

He solemnly hands down an order

ANGLE ON IRONHIDE

He raises a fist in a warwhoop!

A SMALL MOON "MOUNTAIN"

Ironhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands

about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility.

COMMAND CENTER - ANGLE ON THE CONSOLES

PAN UP   and through the sky to -

ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They stand together a communication console. Spike is now

35 years old. Bumblebee looks as he has always looked, save

for a couple of funny bumper stickers on his tail: I (heart)

Cybertron. I (club) Decepticons.

CONTINUED:

INT. THE SHUTTLE

Ironhide and Prowl sit at the controls, running a series of

pre-launch tests.

ANGLE ON PRIME, CLIFFJUMPER, AND THE OTHERS

Standing at the Command Center, watching:

THE   LUNAR    "MOUNTAIN"

Suddenly, smoke starts pouring out of the mountain.

Then, the "mountain" which must be made of paper mache or

something blows away revealing -- The shuttle!

Suddenly, the shuttle rips out of the ground in a ball of

fire.

CONTINUED:

As it takes off, we realize this isn't any dinky shuttle, but

a massive ship, capable of carrying all the energon needed

to fight a war and an army to boot. The screen is bathed in

smoke and fire which slowly clears.

ANGLE ON PRIME

As he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance.

ANGLE BEHIND PRIME

We see a bank of computers. Suddenly, a small tape deck pops

open... a cassette pops out and transforms into...

...Laserbeak who flies away unseen.

EXT. SPACE    - LATER

The shuttle    hurtles though a massive asteroid field.

INT. THE SHUTTLE

Ironhide is at the controls.

Suddenly, there is a terrible BANG! on the side of the ship,

and the two Autobots are thrown from their seats.

ANGLE ON THE SHIP

The most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a

gaping hole in the side of the ship... Then, when the light

clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we see -

MEGATRON!

In all his glory.

Then, he transforms to Gun Mode, spins into STARSCREAM'S arms

and Starscream fires.

IRONHIDE AND RATCHET

While FIRING back are FUSED TOGETHER... ... then blasted

apart and fall in smoking, glowing fragments.

ON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON

As they enter the now empty ship, a number of Decepticons

flood past them, taking positions and searching for other

living Autobots.

CONTINUED:

Ironhide pulls himself up and grabs onto Megatron who flings

him against the wall.

EXT. EARTH - CLOSE SHOT- MINIATURE RADAR SCREEN

A child's hands hold a scanner device which tracks a

TRAVELING BLIP across a star map towards a pulsing dot which

represents the Earth.

CONTINUED:

Then, he tosses the rod into the water.

ON DANIEL RIDING HIS HOVERBOARD UP THE HILL

ANOTHER ANGLE - ON AUTOBOT CITY

FOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the

perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant

Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill. As they travel, we SHOULD

also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about.

(DESIGN NOTE: Autobot City looks like a federal energy

project gone mad. Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit

every known means of getting energy. The mountain is covered

with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks

pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions

of volts. Near all of these various things are energon

compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN

THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel

truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this

energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then

convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot

City. In short, it should be clear that the purpose of

Autobot City is to harvest energy. All the while, Hot Rod and

Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up

into neighboring hills for an overview of the -

CIRCULAR LANDING AREA

which resides within the "bowl" created by the City structure

and natural surroundings.

CONTINUED:

ON KUP AND OTHER AUTOBOTS

KUP - a grizzled, "old Soldier" of an Autobot - is directing

the positioning of a large metal road barricade. Hot Rod

barrels through a sign which reads: "STOP -THIS AREA OFF

LIMITS", almost knocking Kup over in dust and wind

MOUNTAIN ABOVE AUTOBOT CITY- LOOKOUT POINT

Hot Rod arrives at a viewing platform carved in mountainside

and TRANSFORMS back to humanoid mode. Daniel rushes to a set

of PUBLIC VIEWING BINOCULARS and peers into them.

DANIEL'S P.O.V - BINOCULAR MATTE - THE SHUTTLE

The hole Megatron blasted in order to get into the shuttle

mars the otherwise perfect exterior of the ship.

ANGLE ON DANIEL AND HOT ROD

Hot Rod looks up and a pair of futuristic binoculars pop out

of his eyes.

HOT ROD'S POV - THE SHUTTLE

Hot Rod's vision, now, infinitely better than human vision,

spots something truly disturbing -- -- Starscream, and

several Constructicons inside the ship!

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

Drawing his gun, he starts FIRING on the shuttle.

ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE

Rays streak through the hole searing...

ANGLE ON MEGATRON

Standing behind a pair of Decepticons who pilot the shuttle,

he turns to see...

ANGLE ON KUP, CONSTRUCTION CREW

Kup and the Autobot Construction Crew watch Hot Rod shooting

at the shuttle.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE

Suddenly it cracks open, and Decepticons shoot out of the

wreckage like toys from a pinata.

CLOSE - MEGATRON

In mid-air

HOT ROD AND DANIEL

Hot Rod pulls Daniel back as Megatron's BLAST SHEARS OFF the

VIEWING PLATFORM which crumbles and falls down the steep

mountain!

Putting Daniel under one arm, he pivots and kicks up at...

...Hook and Scavenger who are descending on him in humanoid

mode... ...causing them both to crash against the

mountainside which starts a... ...landslide which Hot Rod

"rides" down the slope, pursued by... ... Decepticon FIRE.

ANGLE ON BOTTOM OF MOUNTAIN SLOPE - BLITZWING

Blitzwing flies down in jet mode, transforms to robot mode,

looks up at the "slide riding" Hot Rod and Daniel, transforms

to tank mode and takes aim.

ON HOT ROD AND DANIEL

as Hot Rod tumbles, he covers Daniel with his arms and tries

unsuccessfully to slow his fall.

CONTINUED:

...Kup's arm descends into SHOT, spinning Blitzwing's turret

around. Blitzwing's blast, scorches...

FOLLOW Kup as he lands in front of Hot Rod, who is just

coming to a stop at the bottom with Daniel.

... chew up the ground beside them.

HOT ROD AND KUP

with Daniel race toward Autobot City, transforming into

vehicle mode as shots gouge the terrain around them.

PERCEPTOR IN MICROSCOPE MODE ON "BATTLEMENT" OF AUTOBOT CITY

he watches...

PERCEPTOR'S POV - THE DECEPTICON ATTACK

Megatron, Insecticons, Constructicons, and other Decepticon

forces attack the city from the sky and ground.

CONTINUED:

He turns and FIRES from his hip.

DIRGE IN JET MODE

Zooms in to strafe as...

SPRINGER'S BLAST...

...Explodes on his wing tip.

SPRINGER, ULTRA MAGNUS AND OTHERS

as Decepticon BOMBS AND LASER FIRE pour in on the City.

HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN ON COURTYARD - TRACKING SPRINGER

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON SPRINGER AND ARCEE

as they make it through an archway which TRANSFORMS INTO A

STEEL SHIELD as they run through

ON STARSCREAM - HIS FOOT STILL CAUGHT IN "CLAM" OF COURTYARD

He struggles to get free before he is crunched by the still

transforming city. In the nick of time, he shoots a "shoe

horn" like projection from his wrist and pulls his boot

free, then... ...dodges away. ... The "clam" shape RETRACTS

COMPLETELY and more armored shielding SLIDES INTO PLACE TO

COVER where the Courtyard was. He winces in mid-air and flies

away as the city continues to transform to a fortress below.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TRANSFORMING CITY

The towers and buildings of the city, picot and retract.. ...

withdrawing like periscopes, turning and vanishing into

steel shield coverings.

doorway into the city.

TRANSFORM.

INT. CITY SIDE OF DRAWBRIDGE

as Kup and Hot Rod roll in and TRANSFORM where Ultra Magnus

is waiting for them with Perceptor.   Other Autobots are

moving into battle stations in the b.g. and ALARMS SOUND.

Daniel looks on in awe.

Kup moves OFF with Hot Rod and Daniel.

BLASTER ON FORTIFIED " CROWS NEST" LOOKOUT TOWER

The "Crows Nest" has windows all around and Blaster's seat

rotates so he can watch action and broadcast battle reports

like a Top 40 Deejay. Perceptor climbs up ladder into "Crows

Nest" from lower level. As Blaster speaks, we see Decepticons

FIRING at the windows of the Crows Nest but the bursts

explode harmlessly against the glass

BLASTER'S POV -   INSECTICONS

Chewing on armor plating at the lower edge of the fortified,

transformed city.

CONTINUED:

BLASTS of enemy fire continue to rock the crows nest as

Perceptor answers

ON WAVES SPREADING THROUGH SPACE

MEGATRON LEADING ASSAULT ON TRANSFORMED AUTOBOT CITY

He is FIRING at ARMORED DOOR, trying to melt through when he

reacts to SOUND of Blaster's broadcast for help, stops, and

IN "PILLBOX" LIKE   GUN EMPLACEMENT IN CITY'S ARMORED WALL

Where Springer and Arcee clear the twisted remains of Autobot

defenders away from a CATAPULT LIKE TORPEDO LAUNCHER.

ANGLE ON CATAPULT

as it HURLS FLAMING TORPEDO BOMBS one after the other out the

launch port and we FOLLOW THEM TO MEGATRON AND OTHER

DECEPTICONS waiting for Devastator to open the way as a

succession of torpedo-bombs explode, knocking them aside,

some of the Torpedo-Bombs strike...

EXT. THE EDGE OF THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE

as Optimus Prime's Space Shuttle hurtles in.

INSIDE THE SPACE SHUTTLE - OPTIMUS PRIME WITH DINOBOTS

...buckling City walls, menacing the Autobots inside.    Hot

Rod and Kup are released during the struggle.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

As they try to destroy Devastator... ... Their strength is

more than matched and soon they are overwhelmed by him.

EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

Prime stands outside the dented shuttle with Sunstreaker and

Hound. As he talks he shoots at a swarm of Decepticons who

battle their way towards him.

PRIME'S POV - MEGATRON

The Decepticon leader stands a hundred yards away, vanishing

and reappearing with the shifting waves of Generic

Decepticons that charge back and forth.

PRIME'S CHARGE:     A SERIES OF SHOTS

PRIME'S CHARGE - HEROIC BATTLE THEME SONG

Optimus Prime leader and hero of the Autobots charges into

certain doom. As he battles his way through the Decepticons,

we HEAR an inspiring anthem of courage, strength and triumph,

like "Eye of the Tiger". This theme will reprise during the

film when the Autobots are battling at impossible odds. He

charges headlong into the Decepticon forces which separate

him from Megatron. Decepticons fire on him, but he takes

the shots, and... Spinning and whirling like the Sundance

Kid, he takes a lot out. Then, Decepticons attempt to block

his charge and Prime... ... Like a powerback, transforms to

Truck Mode and barrels into them, sending Decepticons flying

around like shards of glass hit by a .45. ... finally, he

is engulfed by an incoming swarm, and it looks like his

attack is foiled.

Then he turns and sees...

CLOSE ON MEGATRON

his eyes blazing with hatred.

ON OPTIMUS PRIME

Dirge takes a sneaky leap at him... Optimus stiffarms him

with a shuddering clank... ...then turns him upside down with

one hand and... ...drives him headfirst into the rocky

ground, letting him crumple and fall.

Ultra Magnus in car carrier mode barrels out of city carrying

several Autobots. He and the others transform into robot

mode and fire lasers at the Decepticons.

INTERCUT TO HOT ROD, KUP, DANIEL, ARCEE, BLASTER, PERCEPTOR,

fighting their way to the battle of the titans.

...And charging.

ANGLE ON OPTIMUS AND MEGATRON

gun and...

BLASTS PRIME IN THE WOUND HE'D MADE WITH HIS LASER DAGGER

his midsection now glowing and smoking, a huge hole where the

Blaster has struck.

Megatron tosses Hot Rod aside like a rag doll and stands

above the dying Prime.

ON OPTIMUS PRIME

as he gathers his remaining strength and smashes Megatron

with both fists clasped together.

He bashes in Megatron's torso casing, fracturing the sides

which split, spilling wires, fuses, lights, circuitry.

Megatron falls! Prime falls to his knees, tries to rise,

collapses to his side and falls slowly back. HOT ROD runs

over to him.

ANOTHER ANGLE- MEGATRON

Starscream and other Decepticons stand over the smoking body.

ANOTHER ANGLE- ASTROTRAIN

Decepticons behind, who immediately raise their hands upon

realizing that they are surrounded by Autobots.

TIGHT SHOT - ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME

Optimus Prime is tilted into half sitting position by other

Autobots manipulating the platform as Ultra Magnus grasps his

hand with great emotion

Until all are one... Continue the struggle... (sags, gasps,

hanging on) Transfer the Matrix of Leadership.

TIGHTEN SHOT ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME

A distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand

and points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest. Then,

pressing a button on Prime's chest, a small, secret doorway

opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in

there. Ultra Magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light,

reaches in, and lifts out --

THE AUTOBOT LEADERSHIP MATRIX,

-- and holds it for a moment in his hand.

ANGLE ON ALL

The bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal,

seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the

shot. Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest,

closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary,

and extremely powerful glow from his eyes.

ON KUP, HOT ROD, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR

They are all full of great sorrow.

ON PRIME - HE DIES

All of his lights go out, including his eyes.

UNICRON

Rotating satellite dishes on the surface spark with

electricity. Dissolve inside Unicron to reveal scenes of

Prime's death and the passing of the Matrix to Ultra Magnus

THE DECEPTICON HALL OF HEROES - STARSCREAM

This is the closest thing the Decepticons have to a throne

room. It is a massive, circular room with tombs of old

leaders, and a raised area where Starscream stands.

STARSCREAM AND OTHERS

The Decepticon plane looks slightly ridiculous with cloak on

his shoulders and Thrust and Ramjet at his side, weapons held

high, but ready for action should anybody question

He is practicing sparring with a SPINNING AUTO-COMBATANT - a

very high tech quintain with many arms, legs, and weapons

that test the user's skills, and reflexes. Hot Rod wears

sparring gauntlet, and holds a small LASER DAGGER and special

shield. As he lowers shield and reacts to Dinobot reactions

to Kup's story.

THE AUTO COMBATANT

Then hammers its fists on top of his head...

as he presses firing button ...

ANGLE ON GALVATRON'S CARRIER

Particularly deadly looking missiles shoot out.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE

It zooms towards a whopper of a planet, surrounded by several

small moons. We will later learn that this planet is

Quintesson, but for now, it's mysterious. The moleculon

missiles streak after it like sidewinders.

INT. THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE

Kup and Hot Rod pilot the thing for all it's worth.

ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE AND MISSILES

The missiles streak toward them.

CONTINUED:

INT. THE SHIP (KUP AND HOT ROD)

Hot Rod watches wide-eyed, as Kup watches ahead warily, hands

on the controls.

ANGLE OUT THE VIEWSCREEN

Suddenly, the moleculon missiles, reverse course and start

coming back.

ANGLE ON THE MISSILES

The missiles sidewind towards them, then their paths cross

and

BOOOM!

Everything flashes white.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE

INT. THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE

Kup and Hot Rod look forward, their eyes, blinking, as if

strained.

CONTINUED:

EXT. ANGLE ON THE SHIP

It sits next to a gigantic alien-made moon. Suddenly, a

hatch opens and a massive grabber that looks like a lobster

claw shoots out at it.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He sees the claw coming out of the viewscreen.

ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN

The claw snaps on the front of the ship, smashing the window

and...

SPACE - ANGLE ON THE SHIP

As it explodes, flinging the Autobots inside down toward the

Quintesson's planet.

GALVATRON PURSUING ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE

INT. ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE - ULTRA MAGNUS, SPRINGER

as they man control panel in cockpit. In the background,

Blurr and Arcee work to patch other holes in hull and Daniel

helps them. Perceptor slowly plots coordinates on light-up

table, oblivious to SHAKES AND ROCKINGS of their ship.

electrical outline envelopes it and there is a... ...

blinding flash after which... .. remnants of the hull and

accompanied by explosive sound and then, silence! ... Where

the shuttle had been there is now...nothing! Just loose

asteroids and clouds of space dust

LONG SHOT ON THE HUGE FLAT TOP

as it veers off and away from the space cloud, followed by

Cyclonus' Armada. Hold for a beat, and then CLOSE IN on the

dust cloud as... ... part of Ultra Magnus' shuttle flies into

the clear.

ANGLE ON THE COCKPIT

Arcee, Perceptor, Springer, Blurr are crowded together in

cramped remnant of cockpit as Daniel and Ultra Magnus sit at

the control deck

RESUME ON PERCEPTOR

realizes he's overdoing it again, clears his throat

LONG SHOT- SHUTTLE CHANGING COURSE TOWARD LARGE DISTANT

PLANET

which we see as dim shadow on the edge of space

A small, falling object appears high above Quintesson and

hurtles down, down, over and over until it is in view and we

see it is...

HOT ROD - TRACKING

He plummets down through layers of atmosphere and continues

to fall past shiny rock pinnacles of unusual construction as

we

SEA Hot Rod sinks to the bottom where he collides with... ...

a metallic reef, bounces, manages to right himself, shaking

his head as he regains equilibrium, and... Then he transforms

into auto mode modified for undersea action and starts riding

off as he calls through intercom.

HIS P.O.V. - A HUGE, MECHANICAL 0 SQUID CREATURE

The ROBOTOID SQUID is tearing Kup to pieces and tossing the

pieces across the ocean floor with its silvery metal

tentacles

ON HOT ROD

He transforms and blasts...

... Wraps his tentacles around Hot Rod and starts crushing...

... Hot Rod looks like he's about to be crushed, but he...

CLOSE ON KUP'S HEAD

as he turns head around to look up at Hot Rod and spits out a

mouthful of sand

KUP AND HOT ROD ON THE RED DESERT SHORE OF THE ENERGY SEA

Kup stands impatiently while Hot Rod reassembles them.

CONTINUED:

we watch Hot Rod and Kup move off into the distance as we:

ANOTHER PART OF QUINTESSON

Kup and Hot Rod walk along a swampy, marshy area. Suddenly,

there are several loud gurgles, and we can see the shapes of

something terrible emerging through the muck. Hot Rod spins

to fire, but Kup bats down his arm.

PAN TO SHOW

EIGHT SHARKTICONS (in humanoid mode) surrounding them. The

Sharkticons are smaller than the Autobots, but they look ugly

and vicious.

CONTINUED:

Kup holds out his hands to show that he has no weapon.    Then,

he addresses them...

SHARKTICONS

(GROWL VERSION OF THE SAME

THING)

They hold out the cubes and two of the Sharkticons take the

Energon cubes, like dogs getting a treat. Then, the other six

show up looking for cubes.

CONTINUED:

The two robots, taken by surprise, fall backwards. PAN FROM

the fallen robots to an area behind a tree. For just a

moment, we see a small yellow Autobot in robot mode. There,

then, as quickly as we realize what it is, it transforms into

automode and vanishes in a flash. It was Wheelie.

THE SHARKTICON CAMP ON QUINTESSON - KUP, HOT ROD AND

SHARKTICONS

Sharkticons march Kup and Hot Rod into a HOLDING PEN within a

walled compound. As we FOLLOW THEM INTO PEN we PULL BACK and

PAN to establish that entry procession is being watched by...

ON HOT ROD AND KUP

as Hot Rod looks around and reacts sharply

HIS P.O.V.- THE QUINTESSONS

as we feature the Leader Quintesson who is taller and wears a

different color robe from others. He is watching arrival of

Kup and Hot Rod and his faces rotate so it goes from smiling

face to suspicious face to angry face to furious grimace.

RESUME ON HOT ROD AND KUP

as Sharkticons shove and prod them, JOLTING them into the

holding pen and locking the gate. Then, they install

RESTRAINING BOLTS.

PAN FROM HIS P.O.V. - A SHADOWED, ALCOVE LIKE HUT

as a figure moves forward slightly and speaks in a harsh,

bass'o voice. It is GRANIX. We saw him in the first scene,

escaping from his planet when Unicron ate it. {Note: The

script says *G*ranix here. Not my mistake.}

CONTINUED:

Suddenly, a Quintesson Guard roars in...

All turn and look off, reacting as two Guards thunder in,

grab Granix and pull him back out of the door. {NOTE: Another

instance of the spelling of Granix}

ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE LEAD QUINTESSON

as he points at Kup and Hot Rod

THEIR POV    - OUT THE WINDOW THE ARENA

Kranix stands on what almost looks like a wide diving board

over a watery (or oily) pit teeming with Sharkticons.

CONTINUED:

Jury's faces rotate to fifth expression - a DEATH'S HEAD ON

GRANIX   {NOTE: Yet another, final, reference to Kranix as

Granix} Suddenly, the Robot is dumped into a pit of teeming

Sharkticons and there is a mad frenzy. In moments, he is no

more.

ANGLE ON KUP

He watches grimly through the bars.

THE EDGE OF A HUGE, SHADOWY PLANET IN SPACE

as Ultra Magnus' Shuttle is BUFFETED BY WINDS AND STORMS as

it enters the atmosphere of JUNKION.

INT. THE SHUTTLE

as it SHAKES AND RATTLES VIOLENTLY

TIGHT ON BLURR

as he holds up hands and CROSSES fingers.

RESUME ON SPRINGER

Tenses and crouches protectively around Arcee and Daniel as

we see mountains of junk whizz past the window.

ON SHUTTLE - TRACKING

It plummets through the mountains and canyons of junk,

narrowly avoiding crashing, but frequently hitting junk

pinnacles or sides of junk walls, and causing avalanches of

junk. By the time the ship lands, it is nearly

indistinguishable from the junk.

INT. THE SHUTTLE

Everyone is in a jumbled tangle - Ultra Magnus beneath Blurr,

Perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway,

Arcee crouched over Daniel and Springer with half his body

sticking through the hull

SPRINGER AND PERCEPTOR AT OPEN DOOR

as they look out on landscape of "living" junk

CONTINUED:

She starts helping him into the exo-suit.

Daniel clips "cage" of Exo-Suit shut and stands up inside the

gridwork which makes him taller and broader. He moves

awkwardly, barely able to advance a step

He suddenly starts moving rapidly backwards, then sideways,

then forward, then he starts dancing rapidly, then bounces

off walls... ..spinning upside down, then flips over several

times and lands in a splatter, legs spread, arms this way and

that - amused, startled and unhurt.

CONTINUED: (2)

He suddenly flips around twice in mid-air then regains his

feet and leans way over against Arcee for support. She laughs

and pats his shoulder

ON SPRINGER AT DOOR

as he sends down RAMP and motions to the others curtly

EXT. THE SHUTTLE

as Springer, Arcee, Daniel et.al. come down the ramp and look

around at the lush "vegetation" of growing junk clumps all

around them and a long vista of junk mountains and spires of

weathered junk-rock.

LONG SHOT- DANIEL AND THE OTHERS

as they start DIGGING for parts to repair the ship, sinister

Junkions begin to emerge from the junk to watch them. Their

leader, WRECK-GAR, speaks to his fellow Junkions.

CONTINUED:

EXT.   THE GATE TO THE QUINTESSON PALACE

At first, we see only the face of a sinister Quintesson

gatekeeper, backed up by heavily armed Sharkticons.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

They stand at the gate, looking more like kids showing up at

your door wondering if you can come out and play, than like

serious robots on a serious mission.

ANGLE ON QUINTESSON AND GRIMLOCK

The Quintesson, showing his friendly face, smiles.

CONTINUED:

With that, the four Dinobots head towards the "primrose

path."

ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON

His head rotates and he smiles a sinister, evil smile.

EXT. UNICRON

Galvatron stands upon the demonic planet, in an extremely

contorted position.

VARIOUS ANGLES ON UNICRON

We have no idea where this godly voice is coming from, but

this place sure is spooky.

EXT. THE PRIMROSE PATH

They step along the primrose path, not noticing as sinister

things start to happen all around them.

ANGLE ON A METAL EATING PLANT

This thing looks like a metal version of a "venus fly trap,"

and it has a malevolent red eye which lights up. Swoop walks

past it in humanoid mode.

SNAP!

It misses him by an inch.

ANGLE ON THE GROUND - IN FRONT OF SLAG

Suddenly, a section of stones drop away in front of Slag

revealing a spiked pit...

ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK AND SLAG

Grimlock, in dino mode, slaps him with his tail, knocking him

away an instant before he steps into the hole...

ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK

He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is

actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs

toward him. The machete like blade strikes the ground,

between Grimlock and Slag narrowly missing them. He turns

and sees the thing stocking in the ground.

CONTINUED:

HIS P.O.V. - WHEELIE

WHEELIE is the Wolf Boy of Quintesson - an Autobot who's been

evading the Sharkticons since his parents' ship crashed,

killing everybody else in his party. He wears a necklace of

Sharkticon teeth, packs a three bladed laser knife and a

special SLING which hurls FIRE STONES. He fears nothing,

especially the Dinobots, and he cockily struts into the

clear... ... walks right up Sludge's tail onto Sludge's back

and then shinnies up his neck and jumps onto... ... Slag's

head where he stands eye to eye with Grimlock

GRIMLOCK AND WHEELIE

The platform drops away and they tumble...

KUP AND HOT ROD - TRACKING

Suddenly, Kup in double-jointed fashion slips out of the

restraining bolt...

CONTINUED:

Then, he transforms to humanoid mode and shoots off Hot Rod's

bolt.

ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT

In full humanoid mode, they land, their weapons drawn.

ANGLE ON ALL

Kup and Hot Rod fire, driving some Sharkticons back.

Kup transforms to Auto mode.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He transforms, too and does the same thing.

ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT

As fast as the Autobots can run the miserable things over,

new swarms of them come out.

ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD

They clear out a circle in the center of the pit and

transform to humanoid mode.

CONTINUED:

WHAT HE SEES

is a wave of larger, more powerful Sharkticons.

ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICONS

They charge Kup and Hot Rod Kup and Hot Rod fire into them,

destroying several, but are.... ... Soon overrun. The

Sharkticons crawl all over them, munching on their metal.

SUDDENLY --

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

They fly down and land on the pile, transforming into Dinobot

mode.

ASSORTED SHOTS OF DINOBOT CARNAGE

SLUDGE in brontosaurus mode, swats several around with his

tail, while stomping them with his feet.

Swoop picks two up with his claws, flies in the air and drops

them on other Sharkticons.

ANGLE ON ALL

Kup and Hot Rod dig themselves out of a pile of Sharkticon

parts.

sticking out of the ground.

EXT. THE SECOND MOON OF CYBERTRON

PAN ACROSS an enormous stockpile of weaponry as we hear the

terrible roar we have come to associate with Unicron.

ANGLE ON SPIKE

He sets a timer to 20 seconds.   The L.E.D. clicks down.

BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They run over to a small space ship as... ... The timer

counts down.

ANGLE ON THE SECOND MOON

Now, for the first time, we see what is really going on.

Unicron looms behind it, about to do the big munch.

ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They roar away.

ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They stop their ship in space.

ON THE SECOND MOON AND UNICRON

BLAMMMOLA!

An incredible display of fireworks goes off, seemingly

blowing Unicron to smithereens.

ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They slap palms. Then, they look up, horrified.

ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They try to fly away.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON THEIR SHIP AND UNICRON

ANGLE ON GALVATRON IN CYCLONUS

Galvatron pops out of Cyclonus and both transform, to land in

front of Ultra Magnus.

Four sweeps fly TOWARD CAMERA in formation.    Galvatron pops

out a communication device from his helmet.

ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS - TRACKING

Four rope-like rays shoot out of them and...

ON ULTRA MAGNUS

wrap around his arms and legs.

ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND THE SWEEPS

His arms and legs caught by the four ropes, he knows he's

just about had it. He struggles for one last moment, then...

ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS AND ULTRA MAGNUS

Pulling their rays taut, the Sweeps fly in four separate

directions, effectively drawing and quartering the Autobot

leader...

ON ULTRA MAGNUS

As all of his limbs are separated from his body and scattered

in the distance, he SCREAMS IN HORROR.

ANGLE ON THE MATRIX

Galvatron gets into Cyclonus and flies off

ANOTHER ANGLE - BLURR, SPRINGER, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR

as they move up beside Daniel.

WRECK-GAR AND AN ARMY OF JUNKIONS

as they are moving in battle array towards the Shuttle.

Junkions are an interesting species. They ride themselves.

That is, the Junkions ride transforms of themselves, so that

if their vehicle breaks down, the driver will become the

vehicle, and the vehicle will transform to become the driver.

They are gibbering, singing almost a wild kind of junk-rock,

war-cry song which, like their language, is constructed of

bits and pieces of the museum junk of our culture - a

humorous aggressive song which makes a surreal kind of sense.

"Slice 'em dice 'em... And that's all folks or your money

back..."

ON SPRINGER AND OUR FRIENDS

as they react

CONTINUED:

Springer leads the way and Blurr, Arcee, Daniel and Perceptor

follow and we MOVE TO A ROAD WARRIOR STYLE CHASE as Springer

Blurr bringing up the rear- - zig zagging back and forth to

keep the Junkions from getting at Daniel.

...turns around to come back.

WRECK-GAR AND OTHER JUNKIONS

They look at one another, blink, then beam with smiles

CONTINUED:

...Wreck-Gar takes the energon sticks and holds them over his

head and... ...all the Junkions smile and cheer and start

chanting the universal greeting phrase, laughing, clapping

their hands and dancing around, taking Arcee's hand and...

of a square dance type gathering, moving back and forth with

them dancing happily, singing the universal greeting in a

melodic, rhythmic way

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He looks at them, strangely.

ANGLE ON WRECK-GAR

He reaches into his body, and about where a heart or some

other organ would be, he pulls out a Watchman.

RESUME ON WRECK-GAR

as he points off and shouts happily.

HIS P.O.V. - JUNKIONS WITH ULTRA MAGNUS

The Junkions move Ultra Magnus' mangled body through an

amazing assembly line, quickly piecing together his body

parts, using junk when they can't find a part. Then, they

lube him, dust him, spray him and polish him. Then, Wreck-Gar

hits a switch, and Ultra Magnus' eye lights go on.

Suddenly, several Junkions scramble to concealed doorways in

the Junk.

ANGLE ON QUINTESSON

Suddenly, boosters fire from the back side of the junk, and

somewhere under all of the junk, we realize is a real space

ship. Maybe the junk is the space ship. It takes off, bits

and pieces of junk flying off as it moves.

LONG SHOT- UNICRON

as Galvatron stands on the surface of Unicron, holding the

Matrix.

CONTINUED:

He leans down and starts trying to open the matrix.

ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING GALVATRON

IN THE BACKGROUND, we see Cybertron getting closer. Galvatron

struggles with the Matrix, but gets a big shock.

ANOTHER ANGLE - GALVATRON ON UNICRON

He desperately struggles to open the matrix. The planet

suddenly starts shaking. Galvatron is bathed in a reddish

light, and looks up in horror!

ANGLE ON UNICRON

A hideous transformation is beginning. The surface of the

planet in front of Galvatron opens up, and we see that the

hideous light comes from eyes set on a hideous head!

GALVATRON AND UNICRON

Galvatron is maybe the size of a single tooth on the horrible

head before him.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

Suddenly, the ground he stands on drops away, and he falls

through space... ... Landing on a protruding plate which

sticks out of Unicron's chest.

GALVATRON - CLOSE

He looks around himself in horror and lets out a loud scream

as he realizes the unimaginable horror that surrounds him.

ANGLE ON UNICRON - LONG SHOT

The massive planet transforms, arms and legs fold out of the

enormous body, hands unfold from the arms, jets from it's

back propel it towards... ... Cybertron, which, now looks

lonely and vulnerable in space.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He stands on a ledge on Unicron and desperately tries to open

the matrix, but no cigar.

ANGLE ON CYBERTRON

Unicron enters shot and grasps at Cybertron with a hideous

claw...

Shockwave talks into a communications device, as alarms sound

and troopers run everywhere.

SHOCKWAVE'S POV - OUT HIS WINDOW

Unicron's hand reaches towards the window, squeezes, and the

walls crash in.

SPACE - UNICRON AND CYBERTRON

Unicron tears off the tower and crushes it as...

A FLEET OF DECEPTICON SHIPS

streak out of Cybertron and begin firing on the enormous

planet. Here, we see the true scale of Unicron. The fighters

are the size of bees as they attack.

ANGLE ON UNICRON

He looks down on the swarm of fighters and... ...Breathes

fire down on them. The fighters POP and burn like popcorn in

a blowtorch. In moments they disappear like sparks from a

fire.

ANGLE ON CYBERTRON

Decepticon troopers man a massive gun emplacement as... ...

Unicron's huge hand reaches down... ... scraping buildings

and... ... tearing out gun emplacements.

ANOTHER ANGLE- UNICRON'S FACE

rockets, laser blasts, etc.

THE DECEPTICON DEFENDERS

are silhouetted like ants in the foreground as Unicron OPENS

HIS MOUTH and swallows the fire barrage

ANGLE ON UNICRON AND CYBERTRON

As yet more Decepticon fighters rip out of the planet, it

apart.

catch the lot of them as soon as they get within reach

BLAAAM!

He hits the panel and lights and sparks fly out, causing the

gigantic robot to flicker momentarily.

ANGLE ON UNICRON

The monster lets out a ROAR! Then, reaches down, picks up

Galvatron and drops him into his mouth like a raisin.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He drops into the deep pit of Unicron's mouth, narrowly

avoiding both a torrent of fire, and his sharp, crushing

teeth.

EXT. THE SPACE BATTLE - SAME TIME

As they Junkion cruiser comes close, Unicron lets out a burst

of fire... ... Flames lick the ship, but when the fire

subsides, nothing has happened.

The ship fires back, dumping rays into... ... Unicron's face,

but not really doing any damage.

Lights go off, and the Autobots are thrown around like toys.

ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN

They are heading right to Unicron's eye.

ANGLE ON UNICRON AND THE CRUISER

Unicron swipes at the cruiser, but misses. The Cruiser

crashes right through Unicron's eye like a corkscrew!

INT. UNICRON'S HEAD - SAME TIME

The cruiser rips through the eye socket and smashes through

several electrical membranes that are, in fact, Unicron's

brain.

ANGLE ON THE SHIP

As the ship tumbles through, it dumps off the various

Autobots like rubbish and disintegrates.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He tumbles out of the rubbish and down a deep pit (which we

can assume is a robotic sinus or something)

EXT. THE BRAIN AREA

Kup, Springer, Daniel and Arcee are scattered about the floor

in the giant, flickering chamber.

CONTINUED:

WHAT HE SEES

Are dozens of hovering Robots that look like floating bear

traps, snapping their jaws as they drift slowly towards the

Autobots.

ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS

They run into a long, cave-like chamber which looks like the

central nervous system or something.

INT. ANOTHER CHAMBER - LATER

Hot Rod drops through the darkness and lands in a pile of

miscellaneous junk.

ON HOT ROD

He slowly gets up and looks around the chamber.

WHAT HE SEES

Pan as Hot Rod looks over various different bits of junk,

until he sees the glowing shape of the Autobot Matrix

apparently suspended in mid air.

Then, suddenly two red, burning eyes light up above the

matrix, and we see the hideous form of Galvatron.

ON HOT ROD

He stands up and walks towards Galvatron.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON HOT ROD AND GALVATRON

Hot Rod steps towards Galvatron.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD

Galvatron takes a shot at Hot Rod. ... Hot Rod dives away, as

electricity seems to flash everywhere.

GALVATRON'S POV   -   PANNING THE ROOM

Hot Rod is nowhere to be seen amidst all of the junk.

EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON UNICRON

Suddenly; he looks down, sending down a searing blast of

fire.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

They transform to robot mode and fly away.

INT. THE CORRIDOR IN UNICRON -- SAME TIME

Kup, Arcee, Springer and Daniel dash down the corridor.

Suddenly, Daniel's foot is caught in a maze of wiring.

ANGLE ON THE OTHERS

Not noticing, they keep running.

ANGLE ON DANIEL

He tries to pull his foot out. No luck. Then, he looks up.

WHAT HE SEES

The Robotic Antibodies are drawing very close to him.

ANGLE ON KUP AND ARCEE

They turn around and see Daniel about to be munched by the

antibodies.

ANGLE ON SPRINGER, KUP AND ARCEE

They dash down the corridor firing on...

THE ROBOTIC ANTIBODIES

Their shots hit some, knocking them to scrap, but there are

so many of them, that they can't hold back the tide as it...

ANGLE UNDER THE ANTIBODIES

Daniel, unscathed by the things, which hover over his head,

munching their way towards the Autobots, gets his foot free.

ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS

It looks like Custer's last stand as they are surrounded by

the vicious antibodies.

HER SHOT   - TRACKING

Misses the Antibodies, but strikes a large tube.

ANGLE ON THE TUBE

When it is hit, it pours a torrent of liquid which... ...

Goes over the swarm of Antibodies, but hits Daniel... ...

Carrying him away in a flood of glowing liquid.

ON DANIEL - TRACKING

He shouts as he finds himself in a river of flowing goo.

INT.   UNICRON - A FLOWING TUNNEL

Daniel    rips through what seem to be endless caves on the

torrent    of liquid, until he is dumped down a high waterfall

into...    .... A glowing lake. ... He stays under for a

moment,    and then bobs up to see...

ANGLE ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE

... Several Decepticon troopers hanging from cables like

shirts at a dry cleaners are dropped into the bubbling vat,

and in moments converted to nothing... ... Then, Cliffjumper

and Jazz roll out of the line...

And then Spike comes rolling down, followed by Bumblebee!

ON CLIFFJUMPER, JAZZ, AND SPIKE

They look down, but can't move because they are held by

massive pincers.

Then, he sees.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON DANIEL

He reaches the flickering panel.

ANGLE ON SPIKE - TRACKING

He looks down.

ANGLE ON DANIEL

He looks down at his hand and concentrates as hard as he can.

Then, a spark comes out. It grows longer.

ANGLE ON THE MACHINE

Spike and the Autobots are about to go in.

ANGLE ON THE LINE

It keeps moving. Then, Cliffjumper is dropped in!

ANGLE ON DANIEL

He looks back, and to his horror sees Jazz, Bumblebee and his

father about to be dropped in. He keeps firing. The panel

starts exploding!

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE

Jazz drops in, then Bumblebee, then Spike.

There is no answer. Play the moment. Then...

ANGLE ON THE VAT

It is empty. The Autobots and Spike sit at the bottom,

smoking but alright.

INT.   THE DARK CAVERN WITH GALVATRON AND HOT ROD

Galvatron, the Matrix at his neck, stalks around the room.

Looking everywhere for Hot Rod.

Suddenly, shockingly, Hot Rod jumps out of the floor and

grabs Galvatron, sinking his fist into the Decepticon's face.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD

Galvatron jumps at Hot Rod... ...   Hot Rod transforms to a

car and races away...

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He transforms to cannon mode and fires... ... Hot Rod

transforms to humanoid mode and the shot goes through his

legs. ...   Then, he fires back at Galvatron... ...

CONTINUED:

Hitting him as he transforms back to humanoid mode and

angering him. .Raises his gun, then lowers it.

... Galvatron wrestles him to his back.. ... The Adolescent

Robot tries to fight back, but the other is stronger. ...

Galvatron puts his hands around Hot Rod's neck and starts

squeezing. ... We hear the crunching of metal.

EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE

Unicron shoots down more Decepticons with his remaining eye,

while he crushes the Junkion ship.

INT. THE JUNKION SHIP

The walls crush in.    The Junkions and the Autobots are   being

smashed together.

INT. THE DARK CAVERN

Galvatron still strangles Hot Rod.

ANGLE ON THE MATRIX

Suddenly, it lights up.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He fires at Hot Rod as...

... Hot Rod gets up. ...    The shot doesn't even dent him.

EXT. UNICRON - SAME TIME

... Unicron's side...

INT. THE DARK CAVERN

Hot Rod, bathed in the glow of the matrix. Sticks his hand

in the way we saw Galvatron and Ultra Magnus try earlier.

There is no shock. Then, like pulling the pin on a hand

grenade, he unleashes the spiritual equivalent of a bomb!

ASSORTED SHOTS -   INVASION OF THE MATRIX

The matrix rips through Unicron's body, blowing up wires

causing floods and generally causing havoc.

EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE

Unicron suddenly lets out a scream and lets go of the Junkion

ship, sending it hurtling.

INT. THE JUNKION SHIP

It tumbles through space.

AUTOBOTS AND JUNKIONS

(THEY SCREAM WITH EXHILARATION)

ANGLE ON UNICRON

Suddenly,    he starts tearing into his body.

EXT. SPACE

Unicron writhes in space, tearing himself apart, ripping off

a leg, and sending out sparks like a roman candle.

INT. THE CORRIDOR WHERE KUP ET.AL ARE TRAPPED

They are overrun by the antibodies. One takes a whopper bite

out of Springer's chest.

HIM.

Then another explodes, then another.

SPRINGER'S POV - A WALL OF ANTIBODIES

Suddenly, every antibody in the wall begins exploding, and

through the carnage, we see Bumblebee, Spike, Daniel,

Cliffjumper and Jazz.

ANGLE ON THE BATTLE

The last of the antibodies is blown away, and Kup, Arcee and

Springer sit up amidst a pile of antibody bodies.

ANGLE ON ALL

Suddenly, an entire wall vanishes as Unicron's hand tears at

things.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON THE TUNNEL

They transform. The humans jump in.

THE CHASE - TRACKING

They race up the tunnel, one step ahead    of Unicron's hand

which shoots after them, pulling apart    what we know must be

pieces of his brain... Then, they reach    what seems like a

dead end. In fact, it is the back side     of Unicron's good

eye. The hand comes in after them!

ANGLE DOWN THE CORRIDOR

An unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the

Autobots. When it gets there, we realize that it is Rodimus

Prime.

ANGLE ON RODIMUS PRIME

EXT. UNICRON

Rodimus Prime shoots out the second eye...    Followed by the

others.

ANGLE ON UNICRON

An arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the Autobot essence

spreads throughout the body, blowing circuits. Suddenly,

Unicron lets out a loud agonized ROAR. SPARKS seem to shoot

out of every part of his body. Then, he spins in space like

some kind of a fireworks display, shooting off sparks. And

then...

BANG!

We get the big visual explosion.

EXT. SPACE - MUCH LATER

Unicron's head orbits Cybertron. PAN to Cybertron where and

PUSH IN on Rodimus Prime, Arcee, Kup, Springer, Ultra Magnus,

Wreck-Gar, Daniel, Perceptor, Blaster and Spike watch

construction being done on Cybertron below.

THE END
