"MASTER MIND ALL WET AFTER UBERMAN FOILS AQUARIUM HEIST!"

PHOTO: Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his enemy by

the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a

METALLIC GAUNTLET.

The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the

MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each

photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored

glove.

We ZOOM IN to the last headline.

"MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN!"

PHOTO: Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his

hips, obviously trying to accentuate the "U" insignia on his

chest.

END OF CREDITS SEQUENCE

EXT. BUILDING - DAY

We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the

exact same position.

WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city

below. A perfect view for our guardian hero.

He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as

people happily go about their day.

Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's

expression.

His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND

coming from his wrist.

He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.

It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter "U".

Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape

gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off

into the distance like a speeding bullet.

EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT

Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned

building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and

wonder - now home to a great evil.

INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY

The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge

hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC

EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have

an obvious function FLASH and HUM.

A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story

MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS

INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-

SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.

He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain

could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE

WITH A GIANT GREEN "M" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging

at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES

PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.

Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO

PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.

A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other

men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.

The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,

is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.

Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.

Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they

see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.

Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right

shoulder and turns around.

He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with

his metal gauntlet.

Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat.

He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his

posture and sucks in his gut.

MOMENTS LATER

Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE

RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are

standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away

from us.

She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo

the blindfold.

Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking

features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes

that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.

The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master

Mind.

Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.

Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.

Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.

Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.

Master Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer

terminal.

EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY

Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.

INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY

Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in.

He looks around, but there's suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.

EXT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - DAY

The boat is shooting through the ocean, away from the

observatory.

INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main

bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see

the observatory shrinking in the distance.

Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero

intently searches his hideout.

INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY

Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -

He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT

SCREEN.

Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.

A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping

Metro City's protector.

Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.

Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED

BUTTON on it.

He presses the button.

EXT. OUTER SPACE

A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its

bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.

The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the

sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the

burning star's power.

The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING

SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.

INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY

From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from

the observatory.

Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and

puts down the control box.

Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci

and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.

Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the

monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.

Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.

On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in

his hands. He yanks...NOTHING.

Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused.

Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as

leverage.

Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally

befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness.

Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS.

Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.

Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.

Master Mind begins to laugh.

Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.

Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand.

Everyone turns to the window.

EXT. OUTER SPACE

The satellite fires a giant BEAM OF LIGHT toward the earth.

EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY

The beam hits the observatory. The building instantly

EXPLODES in a white nova blast of fire.

INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window.

Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out.

One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out

toward the observatory.

All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and

smoke.

Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.

Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.

Master Mind turns toward the window.

An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it

closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A

CAPPED FIGURE.

Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.

Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know

what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with

his hands.

The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.

He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around

its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.

Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci's hold and runs over to the

body.

She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered

black cape with the yellow "U" on it.

Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded

at the grotesque sight before him.

Roxanne's eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as

she FAINTS.

Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he's just

walked on water.

Now that he's committed the impossible - our villain is at a

complete loss.

Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow

henchmen.

A sudden realization comes over his face.

His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind

and the others.

CRIME WAVE MONTAGE - SET TO "Fun Fun Fun" by The Beach Boys.

SPINNING HEADLINE: "UBERMAN'S DEATH IGNITES CITY WIDE CRIME

WAVE!"

ARMORED TRUCK

It's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice

something - THEY'RE FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CITY STREETS.

We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw

at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER.

Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh

maniacally.

SPINNING HEADLINE: "CHAMPION-LESS CITY AT THE MERCY OF

HOOLIGANS."

METRO CITY BANK

Da Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding

BAGS OF MONEY.

Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around

the corner and into an alley.

After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming

and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after

them.

The robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like

convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the

driver's wheel.

They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done.

SPINNING HEADLINE: "MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!"

A VICIOUS TORNADO

It's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the

lackeys coolly look on.

Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with

bricks of CASH.

The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in

the three trucks.

Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one

when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward

the tornado.

Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and

aims it at approaching windstorm of death.

He presses the button marked "Tornado Off."

The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the

city.

As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the

window with a hint of something in his eyes. Is it

melancholy?

END OF MONTAGE

EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY

It's Metro City's premier bowling alley. On top of the neon

lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.

INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY

HAL STEWART (early 30's) takes careful aim with his BOWLING

BALL.

He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball,

following it with his eyes.

It's a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.

An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth

looks over at him.

She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim.

Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson

administration era derriere.

It doesn't get anymore clear. This man is a pig.

Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling

him.

INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk.

This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train.

Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts

in a VCR.

TELEVISION

A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair

of shoes.

As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and

disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.

He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a

cat-like grin on his face.

Disgusted, she walks off screen.

Suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a

stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.

BACK TO OFFICE

Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.

This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned.

EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY

TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street.

He quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the

building.

A bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head.

EXT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - DAY

The massive building with a giant 7 on the roof stands in the

heart of Metro City.

INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY

The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle

of a busy news day.

Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are

SHOUTING.

The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.

Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.

Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room

to see every eye on her.

No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting

to make her uncomfortable.

The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK

BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.

Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad

expressions on everybody's face.

He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in

his mouth.

Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the

arm.

INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns

toward his door.

Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM

EMBRACE.

A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it

on the table in front of them and leaves.

Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to

face him.

There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank.

Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us

happier than to have our girl back,

but...

Yes?

Things have sorta...changed.

In three weeks?

Listen, I'm not one who likes to

open up wounds - especially ones

that are just starting to scab, but

you were sorta our go to girl for

the exclusive on Uberman. And now

that he's gone...I moved Brad into

your anchor spot.

Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an

idiot.

It's the suits. They think it's

time to switch things up.

Oh, because they can't use me to

get the big story.

C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the

nature of what we do. They used

you, you used Uberman. Everybody's

happy.

I didn't use him.

Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you

two were in love or something. My

bad.

We were.

There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if

she's failed to convince even herself of this.

Roxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her

pride

Frank looks up at her, not believing what he's hearing.

EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT

Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands

out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century

Gothic architecture.

LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding

a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT

A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and

dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely

futuristic machinery.

The building has been converted into Master Mind's new SECRET

LAIR.

In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING

BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads "Reactor -

Don't Touch."

We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting

on a couch watching TELEVISION.

Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a BAG OF LOOT.

Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in

the corner of the room.

Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato

sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out

of it.

Plato nods to the giant orb.

Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges

glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone.

Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses

Plato.

Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in

a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic

beat...

He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly

like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND'S

FATHER.

Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat.

From Master Mind's expression, we see Plato's words beginning

to ring true.

INT. RESTURAUNT - DAY

Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting

around her, gabbing.

Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks.

A WAITER comes by with a tray of CAESAR SALADS and begins

setting them out for the ladies.

The waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too

shocked by Roxanne's revelation to notice.

She turns to Friend one and two to explain.

The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away

as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away.

EXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY

The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his

sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS

WRIST.

His image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then

disappears - revealing the man's true form underneath: MASTER

MIND!

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building

construction site.

ACROSS THE STREET

A local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the

sidewalk, including Roxanne.

YOUNG MOTHER

The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into

the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby.

Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to

an upper floor.

Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction.

CRANE

The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look

on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to

fix the problem.

Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie

his shoe.

CRANE

The operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED

BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL.

HAL AND THE WOMAN

The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing

her and her baby. She screams.

Hal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the

way and crashes into the woman and stroller.

ACROSS THE STREET

The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on

film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just

as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND.

HAL AND MOTHER

Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and

kisses it.

Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him.

She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy.

He's a little uncomfortable with the woman's public display

of affection and the small child in-between their embrace.

Hal slowly eases out of the woman's grip.

The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother.

Hal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he's captivated by her

beauty.

They're suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his

way in between them.

The reporters eat this up.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT

TELEVISION

John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a

two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and "In Your Eyes" by

Peter Gabriel begins to play.

From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.

He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear

from his cheek.

INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as

she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a

book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER.

She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it

up for her.

Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned

speechless - It's popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN

CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him.

He notices the book she's reading.

INT. BOOKSTORE CAFE' - LATER

Roxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word

intently.

She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers-

by being to notice who she's with.

Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask

it.

The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of

lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time.

John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's

heard every word.

In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair.

Roxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the

craziness of the situation.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY

Master storms in the office to find Plato and Einstein

playing darts with the original Mona Lisa.

Everyone stops what they're doing upon seeing that their

master has returned.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY

The lab is slick, white and ultra modern.

Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING

GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly.

He glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked

thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a

huge vat dangles precariously.

Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and

Einstein.

Plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of

gallons of green and brown goo into the hole.

The slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo-

soaked Severs.

Master Mind looks into the pit.

BOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers

Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves

an inch. Finally...

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - LABORATORY - DAY

Through a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally.

Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY

The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass

tube not much wider than himself.

Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto

Stenwick's arm.

Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him.

He brushes the spider off.

Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato.

Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF

SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he's

engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY

Master Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in

the background.

He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no

advice.

Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's

attention.

Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand.

The lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what

they're hearing.

MINUTES LATER

Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small

table.

Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center.

As Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in WHITE

GLOW emanating from inside.

Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the

muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with

white lettering that reads: "Hal Stewart - Metro City's

Newest Hero?"

A smile creeps across the evil one's face.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Plato is sitting in the van, staring into a pair of

binoculars as he speaks on a cellphone.

INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY

Master Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console

as he speaks to Plato.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

We follow Plato's line of sight across the street where we

see HAL PLAYING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF BLIND CHILDREN.

INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY

Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair.

EXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY

From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child

who's sitting on a rock. But up close...

He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his

shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them.

Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his

hands and begins to cry.

Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder.

The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance.

The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark

sunglasses - he should get an Oscar.

The boy stands up and is about to take off.

Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the

boy's face before sending him on his way.

The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to

absolutely melt.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should

be next in line for popehood.

Plato starts up the van and pulls away.

INT. BAR - DAY

It's a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting

pool as the bartender slings drinks.

Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a

very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him.

As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly

catches himself on the bar's TELEVISION - it's a story about

how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site.

He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back

to the TV. A plan of attack is forming.

The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take.

TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them,

OVERHEARS.

Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air.

TRUCKER#1 taps Hal on the shoulder.

The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS.

MOMENTS LATER

Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as

`I'm Holding Out For A Hero' plays on the jukebox.

TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room

quickly goes silent.

He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it

up in the air for everyone to see.

Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal.

The crowd looks up at the Television.

TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS

The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40's, amazing mustache),

suddenly has a memo passed to him.

The tape shows Hal running in slow motion.

The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation,

pushing the woman and child out of the way.

INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal.

Trucker#1 snatches his medal back.

EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT

Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal

cutting through a dark alley.

Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle.

Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve.

A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth

spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and

shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row

of garbage cans.

EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT

An angry Master Mind slaps Plato.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering.

Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky.

Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the

emitting smoke from his jacket.

EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT

Master Mind turns to Da Vinci.

INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It's a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes

are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a

minefield.

Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights

wobble and streak like a hallucination.

He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks

worse.

Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a

chair. The room begins to swim.

His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him.

From Hal's POV the cat's face looks like we're seeing it

through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it.

Suddenly Hal realizes his cat's talking to him.

Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself

out on the coffee table.

INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Hal lies in the same position we left him last night.

He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst

hangover in the world.

Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not

really sure what he's looking for.

Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the

refrigerator.

He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his

mouth. It's empty.

As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton

to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.

He shakes the thought from his mind.

BATHROOM

Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.

HAL'S FACE

He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The

inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content

look washes over his face.

There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and

SPLINTERING.

The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM

SMASHING THE TOILET.

He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL.

He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it

destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom

mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window.

He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now,

to see the floor give way.

Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole.

He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast

table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the

smashed toilet on his pancakes.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the

stop.

He starts running after it.

ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING.

Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls

back to the ground.

As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso

right below the rear window.

Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.

He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can.

HONK!

Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him.

He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES

UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the

sidewalk.

Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.

He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity.

He opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL

NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him.

As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he

catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one.

He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK

OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business.

He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone

has returned to a clothed state.

He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's

floating a foot off the ground.

INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Hal's front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master

Mind.

He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he

notices the giant hole in the floor.

Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look

over a "KARATE KID" POSTER on Hal's living room wall.

He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a

young Ralph Macchio to kick.

He presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO

THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA.

INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge

and takes a long pull from it.

Hal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands.

Pat Morita steps out from the shadows.

Hal passes out again.

LATER

We are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open. He

appears to be lying on the couch.

He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is

as it seems.

He lays his head back down.

A voice sounds right next to his ear.

Hal leaps up to find he's been resting his head on Pat's lap.

Hal backs away and trips over a box.

Pat rises and walks to Hal. He's so calm it makes Hal calm.

Pat slaps him across the face hard.

Hal grabs his jaw.

Pat gets up and walks toward the door.

EXT. PAT'S CAR - DAY

Pat is sitting in the driver's seat. The car is bumping up

and down.

We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head.

He's hardly straining.

Pat leans on the HORN.

Two highly attractive female joggers run by. They're clearly

impressed with Hal's show of strength. He smiles and mouths a

"hello."

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up

and carefully takes aim...at Hal's chest.

Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun.

Pat quickly aims and fires.

Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets

off his chest.

Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch.

EXT. SKY - DAY

Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position. He's weaving

back and forth.

Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof

of a building down below.

Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight

position.

Pat's CELL PHONE begins to RING. He answers it.

Pat panics. He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot.

He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air.

Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his

John Cusack voice.

He can't believe what he's hearing.

He quickly recovers his composure.

Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal

lands behind him.

EXT. PARK - DAY

John Cusack and Roxanne eat WRAPPED SANDWICHES while walking

through Metro City Park.

Roxanne bites into her sandwich.

She tosses it in a nearby garbage can.

Roxanne smiles at his analogy.

John Cusack notices Roxanne's smile starting to fade.

John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask

and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It's not

unlike Uberman's except for a giant "T" on his chest. (From

here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN)

He grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa.

INT. BANK - DAY

There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet

ropes. They're all waiting for their chance at the one open

teller window.

Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and

CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank.

John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an

immediate panic.

Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills

into a bag.

As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner

office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER'S head.

George leads him out by the collar.

CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold

superhero stance with hands on hips.

Paul cocks his gun.

We move in for a nice dramatic close up.

George, John and Paul open fire on Titan.

He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him.

With their guns empty the three just stare at him in

amazement.

He turns to George.

Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light

fixture in the ceiling.

Paul tries to run for the door. Titan snatches the collar of

his jacket.

He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY

TRUCK.

Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his

shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands.

Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air.

He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN

FIRST.

Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo

cowering on the floor.

He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up.

EXT. BANK - DAY

Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his

arm. He's suddenly swarmed by a group of television

reporters, including Roxanne.

Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titan's first

news conference with great anxiety.

He hands Titan a check.

Titan looks over to Pat, who violently shakes his head no.

Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing

Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on

her.

Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering

around the crowd to get closer to Titan.

They both turn to see Roxanne's reporter rival Brad Helms,

Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK.

Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the

camera off.

As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough

for her to hear.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY

ON TELEVISION

We see the news conference on the bank's steps. In the corner

of the screen is written: "recorded earlier."

Brad holds the microphone to Titan's face.

Another reporter leans in.

We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this

spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a

NEWSPAPER.

Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads

"Metro's New Hero: Tighten."

Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace

around the room with his arms folded behind his back.

Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato's ear.

Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over,

standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.

Einstein throws up his hands. He's had enough. He pulls off

his wig and throws it to the floor.

Plato and Da Vinci's mouths drop to the floor. They turn to

Master Mind for his rebuttal.

With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the

throat and lifts him into the air.

Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of

Master Mind's grip.

Master Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not

into what he's about to do. He let's Einstein drop to the

floor.

EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a

fancy restaurant.

He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.

John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing

what she's talking about.

He reaches across the table and takes her hand.

Roxanne LAUGHS.

It's starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up.

John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.

They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John

Cusack's disguise generator to short.

His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne

as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.

Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.

LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER

MIND AND JOHN CUSACK.

As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the

Cusack disguise begins to hold steady.

He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.

Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face,

causing the generator to short out permanently.

Master Mind now sits in his true blue form.

Roxanne starts to walk away.

Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now

heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food.

Several resturaunt patron's are looking at him through the

window.

Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare.

INT. MASTER MIND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake.

He rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes.

Suddenly, they shoot back open.

EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street

from Roxanne's apartment

He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of

her.

Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment

window's reflection.

He turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but

gets the same results.

INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty.

She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe.

EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING

Roxanne steps outside.

Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on.

She walks across the street, passing in front of Master

Mind's car.

Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat.

Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence.

Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into

the store.

INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the

counter.

EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT

Master Mind is talking on his cell phone.

He suddenly spots something across the street.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out

a gun from under his coat.

EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT

Master Mind stares in shock.

He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the

store.

INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full

of cash from the register.

He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her

neck.

The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun.

The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway

holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs

and blinking lights.

The hoodlum starts to laugh.

The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind.

Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store

in a cloud of SMOKE.

The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL,

covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK.

Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded.

Master Mind starts to walk out when he's suddenly confronted

by the shopkeeper.

Master Mind points the goo gun at him.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder

like he's a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly

behind him.

Master Mind turns around.

He turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of

him blocking his way.

Finally it occurs to her what's going on.

They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in

conflict.

This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief

contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful

conclusion.

With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne

with a baffled expression on her face.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT

Master Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind

him as Plato notices his master's agitated state.

Master Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet

causing Plato's eyes to bulge in pain.

Master Mind tightens his grip.

Master Mind releases him.

EXT. SKY OVER METRO CITY - DAY

Titan flies high over and through the city, under bridges,

between buildings, etc. He's not really working, just

enjoying himself.

INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A PRETTY WOMAN sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but

her bra and panties. Through the reflection in her mirror we

see a large window directly behind her.

As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the

background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and

begins ogling the girl.

She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a

robe.

Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off.

MOMENTS LATER

Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN.

Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run

around in chaos.

He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization.

EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home.

Reporters stand just beyond the police line.

From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita.

Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms.

Pat's body goes limp.

The cameras begin to pop and flash around them.

Titan gently lays Pat's body down and stands respectfully

over him. The reporters rush over.

Titan walks up to one of the cameras.

In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS

PARAMEDICS, load pat's body onto a stretcher.

PLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick

it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing

dead.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT

Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal's

revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy.

There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall

being tinkered with by Da Vinci.

Plato enters the room.

Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on

his throne.

They move to either side of the chair.

Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut.

They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind

occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no

Titan.

LATER

Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have

degraded to fatigue.

STILL LATER

Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet

impatiently on the armrest.

Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.

Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.

He storms out of the room.

INT. HAL'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY

Titan's sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing

his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as

he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.

Much to his annoyance, there's a KNOCK at the door.

He gets up and opens the door. It's Master Mind.

It takes a few moments to register, but Titan's suddenly

excited.

Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins

around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal

fingers.

Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his

guest.

Master Mind throws up his hands.

He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He

walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a

LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER

VALUABLES.

Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan

awe-struck.

Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and

shows it to Master Mind.

The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.

A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of

grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his

chest.

Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a

black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.

Titan proudly points to the two figures.

Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.

Titan puts down his drawing.

Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust.

This strikes a cord with Titan.

Master Mind gets right in his face.

EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

We see Master Mind's body CRASH through the building and land

in a DUMPSTER across the street.

A car pulls up. The driver's door opens. Da Vinci gets out

and runs to help his master.

Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind's body

cushioned by a stack of trash bags.

The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the

dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It's

Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall.

Titan shoots up into the air.

He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were

piloting an invisible jet.

Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan

disappear into the distance.

Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff.

INT. BANK - DAY

Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The

last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks

nostalgic.

A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his

TV idol.

Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration

from all.

A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good-

natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.

The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK

OF CASH.

Sure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the

security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out

the door.

The bank manager comes over to the guard.

As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out

the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror.

The guard's body suddenly smashes through the window, landing

at the startled bank manager's feet.

TELEVISION

"A Channel 7 News Special Report." Brad Helms wipes into

view.

TITAN BEING EVIL - MONTAGE

EXT. DIAMOND EXCHANGE - DAY

Titan flies through the window of the building. He emerges

seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A woman screams from the window of a BURNING BUILDING. Titan

flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again,

leaving the woman behind, slightly confused.

EXT. OUTSIDE MARKET - DAY

Titan steals a little boy's lollipop and gooses his mother.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get

out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see

Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT

Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da

Vinci.

EXT. BAR - DAY

It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police

cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only

building left untouched.

INT. BAR - DAY

A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into

the bottom of his beer glass for answers.

The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a

dirty rag.

He follows the bartender's gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON

THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY.

Titan carefully considers this for a moment.

EXT. BAR - LATER

Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of

money.

He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.

Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.

Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like

the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.

Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars,

tries to pull them apart but can't.

Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a

human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW.

As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look

on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from

under the street in front of him.

Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.

Titan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops.

He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the

street.

Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They

watch Titan shrink into the distance.

EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY

As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city

below.

Suddenly, something catches his attention.

He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below.

The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are

in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up

to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane.

EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY

Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a

COMMOTION.

They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL

from the top of the establishment.

INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Roxanne enters the building's elevator. Just before the door

closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in.

Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.

The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a

MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne's face. She falls to the

floor unconscious.

INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her

living room.

We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to

adjust her vision.

Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear.

It's Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks

to be some kind of JOURNAL.

He throws the diary over his shoulder.

As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked

unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV.

ON TELEVISION

Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.

Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a

PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact.

BACK TO SCENE

As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at

Master Mind.

Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE

OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his

chest.

Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She

finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure

hatred.

TELEVISION

Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves

for the camera to zoom in on him.

He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to

the public for the first time.

BACK TO SCENE

TELEVISION

Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the

car.

BACK TO SCENE

Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her

eyes.

TELEVISION

He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete

shape just off camera.

The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING

BALL from Kingpin's.

He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS.

We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN

FORMATION.

Titan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again.

BACK TO SCENE

Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something

bad.

Master Mind thinks a moment.

Roxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him.

Master Mind shoots up out of his chair.

Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.

Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.

Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the

door.

He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.

He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC.

EXT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT

Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.

He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been

sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear

them off with his metal hand.

INT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT

The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the

darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the

manor.

Master Mind enters.

Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic

crypt.

Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF

WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his

fallen foe.

Besides the Armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact

that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he's

even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists

on his hips.

A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls.

Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a

gigantic BOOKCASE.

On the twelfth bong it falls silent.

Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he

hears a loud CLICK.

The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN

PASSAGE.

The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR.

Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with

stone walls.

He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED

SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.

Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he

begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the

door.

Nothing.

He opens the door to his immediate amazement.

It's some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image

onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS

litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is

covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine

stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.

Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.

SCREEN

A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an

overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt

sticking out.

She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain.

Master Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery.

The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open.

WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room

carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.

Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.

Wayne Scott is just as startled.

He drop his drink and snack to the floor.

The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain

their normal breathing patterns.

Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick

layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.

The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in

Master Mind's head.

INT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK

Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the

observatory explodes.

INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK

Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the

cage.

EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK

Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in

front of some bushes.

EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY

Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the

observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance.

Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the

SKELETON like a javelin.

It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the

flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the

windshield of Master Mind's hydrofoil.

END OF FLASHBACK

Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed.

Master Mind's is absolutely flabbergasted.

Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to

say no more.

Wayne shrugs indifferently.

Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind's shoulder.

He then starts walking to the door.

Wayne turns around.

He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind's face.

Master Mind seems deflated.

Wayne shrugs.

A beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and

turns around.

Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh.

Master Mind's steel hand clinches into a fist at his side.

Wayne's oblivious to this.

He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE

STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME.

Wayne is almost at a loss for words.

Roxanne looks at Master Mind.

Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in

silence.

EXT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY

Titan emerges with Brad and Frank. He's holding a BEER CAN

and a bag of PORK RINDS.

A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,

signaling the approach of something powerful.

Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the

sound becomes almost deafening.

A TANK TRACK

as it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line

of TANKS rolling along the street.

PLAZA

From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks

roll toward Titan.

Titan turns to Brad and Frank.

Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover

behind a nearby building.

Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks

begin to surround them.

FEEDBACK belts out of one of the tank's loudspeaker's,

causing Titan to do a mock wince.

There's a long pause as no one says anything.

Titan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC

BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks

flying into a nearby building.

Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have

him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive

guns.

Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each

barrel.

They FIRE.

The FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE

DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings.

Titan bends down and pick his beet back up.

Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine-

gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a

nearby car.

He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It's nose-

mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.

Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The

bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.

He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun

gets a bead on him.

Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his

hand.

It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade

clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like

a car dropped off a building.

Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and

Frank still hiding behind the building.

He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him.

He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream

cone.

In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of

the Metro City river.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY

Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack

boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb.

The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip

by, but as we have seen, he's not the same man.

Master Mind's cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his

men and answers it.

INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT

Roxanne paces back and forth on the phone.

INTERCUT between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone.

Roxanne can't believe what she's hearing.

Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches

himself before the words swell his heart.

Suddenly, there's a loud crash.

Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been

completely ripped off.

Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if

it were a paper plate at a barbecue.

He looks down at her and smiles.

Master Mind can hears Titan's familiar laugh from his side of

the line.

EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY

Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to

decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion.

He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air.

It's the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine.

As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends

to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne.

Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard

him.

Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY

Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of

his father.

The painting's menacing stare seems to reach into his very

soul.

He looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or

does the painting's stare suddenly seem even angrier?

Plato and Da Vinci suddenly stop what they're doing and look

up at him.

TELEVISION

A news report shows an aerial shot of Titan setting the giant

ball down in the middle of a vacant city street.

INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY     - CONTINUOUS

Da Vinci stops in front of a television set, seeing the news

report in progress.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Roxanne is standing in front of a camera with a mike in her

hand.

Titan suddenly steps into the shot.

He leans into the camera.

EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Titan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot.

INT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

In the bowels of Master Mind's hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR

glows and HUMS MENACINGLY.

BACK TO SCENE

Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away.

Titan lines up his shot.

Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main

street.

ROXANNE

Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable

destruction of Metro City.

As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it's wake;

cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete

sphere brushes along side buildings.

TITAN

He smiles in anticipation and uses "body English" to direct

the ball.

GIANT BOWLING BALL POV

It's nearly halfway to its target.

ROXANNE

She closes her eyes.

Titan's smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something

we don't.

About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT

SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a

defensive barrier. An enormous letter "M" is etched in the

web's center.

The ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly

reduced.

We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A

JET PACK.

He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a

path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere's path.

Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to

empty.

The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side.

It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL.

TITAN

He's furious to say the least.

Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.

Titan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER

on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the

city with Titan in hot pursuit.

ELSEWHERE

A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city

streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight.

He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left.

Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange

collar. It smiles at him.

From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO

CONTROLLED APES.

The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one

off two more jump him.

Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them

across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their

sight they begin to attack the fruit.

MASTER MIND

He's a block away frantically hitting his remote.

Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find

Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with

only his head sticking out.

Titan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND's CHEST.

Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT.

Titan's EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high

pressure stream of water.

Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of

CEMENT mix into the truck.

The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan

doesn't emerge.

Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck

cautiously.

- BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and

concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged

Titan.

As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to

give Master Mind the killing blow.

Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as

a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP.

AS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES

MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY.

Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to

make sure everything's still in place.

He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him.

The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing

next to Master Mind.

As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro

City's newly resurrected champion.

He puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder.

With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY

TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON.

Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING

EYES.

Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him.

Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across

the street into a parked car.

Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a

daze, unable to move.

Titan flies up in the air.

With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master

Mind. He's like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing

blow.

Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands.

Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like

an old Warner Bros cartoon.

In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN

THE GROIN.

The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching,

with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the

pain suddenly surging through his member.

Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind's hand and sees his

gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER.

He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold.

Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little

pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to

see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE.

Roxanne comes up to him.

The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He's

not sure what to make of it.

Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to

well up a little.

Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master

Mind.

She kisses him.

The crowd erupts in a cheer.

TELEVISION

The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the

title "Eye on Metro City."

A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind

her.

Cut to ceremony on capital steps. The MAYOR is shaking Master

Mind's metal gauntlet when it suddenly STARTS TO CRUSH HIS

HAND.

Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and

take aim at Master Mind.

Realizing what's happening, he quickly lets the mayor's hand

go and puts his arms in the air.

He elbows the mayor.

Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down.

WE CUT to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison.

A man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titan's cell

just out of reach.

The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a

copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it.

Back to Samantha at the desk.

Brad turns. The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see

has been sitting beside him.

DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

A woman is being chased by two large thugs. They're gaining

on her.

She comes to a brick wall - a dead end.

The thugs laugh.

The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his

arms folded across his chest.

Thug #1 draws a knife.

Thug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles.

Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind.

Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air.

Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men

behind him.

Thug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands

in the air.

Master Mind looks up and waves.

We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot.

The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it's

sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process.

The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified.
