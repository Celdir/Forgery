We hear PUMPING ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC as the POWER RANGER'S LOGO

BURST'S ONTO THE SCREEN.  Now the logo EXPLODES, revealing

A prop plane whisking across the deep blue sky.

2   INT.  PROP PLANE / FLYING - DAY                             2

The six Power Rangers, TOMMY, KIMBERLY, BILLY, AISHA, ADAM and

ROCKY sport sleek sky diving suits, parachute packs and

helmets.  Tommy is strapped into a high-tech airboard.

BULK and SKULL push their way through the Rangers, decked

in bizarre skydiving regalia, topped off by World War II

leather caps and aviator goggles.

The Rangers exchange amused looks.  Aisha gestures to them

Bulk and Skull swagger to the door and open it - the ground

is a dizzying distance below.  They swallow hard.

Bulk and Skull step aside, Aisha LAUNCHES herself.

The others follow through the opening with flair.

Tommy and Kimberly share an infectious glance, Kimberly

a hand, indicating Tommy should go first.

He's gone.  Kimberly stands backwards in the doorway.

Bulk and Skull watch wide-eyed as she BACK-FLIPS

out of the plane.

3   EXT. SKY  -  DAY

ROCK AND ROLL fills the track as the Rangers plunge towards

earth, executing a series of MIND-BOGGLING MANEUVERS: SPINS,

FISHTAILS, POWER DIVES, BACK FLIPS, you name it.

Bulk and Skull psyche themselves up.

They take deep breaths then CHARGE THE DOOR.

Naturally, they get STUCK, wedged shoulder to shoulder.

THE PILOT glances back, CHUCKLES and BANKS THE PLANE.

5   EXT. PROP PLANE - BARREL-ROLLING - DAY

Bulk and Skull rotate into frame.  Now, facing straight down --

they FALL INTO CAMERA, CLINGING TO EACH OTHER DESPERATELY

6   EXT.  SKY  -  DAY

The Rangers pull off more SPECTACULAR MANEUVERS

then swoop TOGETHER, interlocking hands and forming a

PERFECT CIRCLE

They look to one another and a moment of pure magic passes

between them.  It's not  usual the exhilaration of flight they're

sharing, it s the exhilaration of togetherness, of being part

of a team.

They disperse and yank their rip-cords.  The sky BURSTS TO LIFE

WITH SIX BLOSSOMING PARACHUTES -- white, pink, blue, yellow ,

red and black in color.

7   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK  -  DAY                               7

FAMILIES eat hot dogs and cotton candy at a huge fundraiser .

A large banner proclaims "SAVE THE OBSERVATORY."  We see

diving teams with labeled uniforms -- the BOWLING TEAM, ANGEL

GROVE P.D.  and the FIRE DEPARTMENT.  There s a large white

"BULLSEYE" spray-painted on the grass.  The city's

spectacular large skyline rises out of the b.g.

A SPUNKY MR. KELMAN stands at a podium, speaking into a mic.

A BOWLER shouts out playfully.

Mr. Kelman feigns seriousness.

A hip thirteen year old, FRED KELMAN, yells out as he points

to the sky.

ANGEL ON TARGET - AS AISHA touches down flawlessly.

Aisha clears, then Billy and Adam land toqether.

Billy and Adam clear and now Rocky and Kimberly come in.

Everybody watches with dumbfounded expressions as Tommy SAILS

IN ON HIS AIR BOARD AND SLIDES INTO DEAD CENTER.  He spreads

his arms wide.

The families CHEER and APPLAUD as they surge forward to

congratulate the Rangers.

Mr. Kelman and Fred approach Tommy -  Fred and Tommy exchange

stylish hand slaps.

The other Rangers approach.

8   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK  -  DAY                              8

We hear a VOCIFEROUS SISSING SOUND, but we can't see where  it's

coming from. - Suddenly the six Rangers come SCREAMING AROUND A

CORNER ON STATE-OF-THE-ART ROLLERBLADES.  These kids are FLYING!!

We hear FULL-THROTTLED MUSIC as the kids WEAVE, DUCK and SWERVE

like blading virtuosos.  Tommy LEAPS in the air, does a 180 and

SKATES BACKWARD.

THE HIGH BRANCHES.past a large tree as Bulk and Skull DROP INTO

FRAME

9   EXT.  CITY STREET - DAY                                     9

The Rangers GLIDE around another corner -- there's buildings on

one side of them and a construction site on the other.

Tommy leads them up a plywood ramp -- they LAUNCH TEN FEET

THROUGH THE AIR, PULLING OFF HAIR-RAISING FREE STYLE MOVES THEN

MAKE SPECTACULAR LANDINGS on the construction site parking

structure.

As they shoot across the concrete, the CAMERA PUSHES IN on:

10   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTtZUCTION SITE - DAY                   10

... WORKERS operating heavy machinery -- cranes, bulldozer ,

etc., Construction Worker  jackhammers solid rock.  Drill

makes a CLANGING SOUND as it HITS METAL!  A baffled look comes

over him as he stops the jackhammer, brushes away debris..

uncovering an ANCIENT IRON PLATE.  He gapes at it, too stunned

to speak.

11   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER                  11

A large hook has been fastened to the iron plate -- a crane

ENGINE ROARS as it HOISTS THE PLATE UP, revealing a CAVERNOUS

OPENING.

TWO MORE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS have joined the first, all of

them look on in amazement.

Suddenly a PURPLE STEAM POURS from the opening.  And now

something really amazing happens.   ..

A menacing STONE CLAW RISES UP, CRADLING A HUGE STONE

As though drawn by it's power, he moves to touch it.

KZAAAAAAP?!!  APURPLE BEAM OF LIGHT BLASTS HIM -- SENDS HIM

FLYING TEN FEET THROUGH THE AIR!

We see the reporter then a few cuts of GEOLOGISTS combing the

site with scanning equipment and COPS sealing off the area with

yellow tape.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL A CAFE.

The Rangers are at a table -- Tommy is teaching Fred martial arts

moves.

Tommy executes a wicked JUMPING ROUNDHOUSE KICK.  Fred is

wowed.  He drops into position.

The jovial proprietor, ERNIE, approaches the Rangers' table

with a loaded tray.  Fred pulls off a dazzling JUMPING

ROUNDHOUSE KICK and almost knocks Ernie's tray over.

Fred moves off as Ernie serves the desserts.

Aisha reacts to something off screen.

Bulk and Skull swagger past followed by a GROUP OF KIDS.

Ernie moves off after Bulk and Skull.  Tommy's wrist

communicator BEEPS.  The kids exchange glances than look for a

private area.

They move out of everybody's sight.

Aisha gives Kimberly a puzzled look.

They hit their wrist-communicators and instantly TRANSFORM

INTO SIX IRIDESCENT COLUMNS OF COLOR.  The columns SHOOT UP

THROUGH a giant oak tree, KNOCKING LEAVES LOOSE.

14   EXT. COMMAND CENTER  -  SUNSET                               14

Zordon's remote headquarters protrudes from a craggy

mountain top -- silhouetted by a glorious sunset.  The SIX STREAK

OF COLOR slice downward into the roof.

15   INT.  CONIMAND CENTER  -  NIGHT                              15

Everything's gone haywire   buttons BLINK, emergency

lights FLASH, there's a CACOPHONY OF ELECTRONIC SOUNDS.

ALPHA 5 works frantically amidst the array of computer

banks while ZORDON looks on from his COLUMN OF LIGHT.

The six Rangers MATERIALIZE, Tommy turns to Zordon.

16   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

Barricades and police tape surround the egg.  A  SECURITY GUARD

passes his sleeping CO-WORKER, drops into a chair, sips his

coffee.

BZZWAPP -- ZEDD, RITA, GOLDAR and a short, fat, furry creature

named MORDANT appear.

Zedd grumbles to himself.

The stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy.

Kurt looks up groggily.

Zedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are

knocked out.

Goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or

Mordant's foot.  Mordant KNOCKS on Goldar's metallic leg.

Goldar is oblivious.  Zedd, stands reverently before the

glowing egg shape.

Mordant BANGS on Goldar's leg again.

Goldar SWATS Mordant.

Mordant GRUMBLES under his breath.  Meanwhile, Zedd aims  is

staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy.  The egg

opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air.  webs of

ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE.

When the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT

OOZE.  The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in  o

the sticky substance.

As if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS.  Zedd and Rita

are too busy arguing to notice this.

We hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP

AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE.  Mordant tugs at Zedd.

Zedd and Rita finally notice Ivan, standing with his lips

apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of

GLISTENING SILVER.

He stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous YAWN, puts

his hands on his head, CRACKS it.

Now he SMACKS his lips together, opens his arms theatrically

and gives his trademark stance.

Rita blushes.

Zedd flashes her an angry look, turns back to Ivan.

Ivan gives a slight bow.

Ivan's face goes dark, THUNDER RUMBLES and the site LIGHTS UP

WITH A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  Mordant turns to Goldar.

Goldar hands Ivan a scrap of paper.

BZZWAPP!!  The foursome DE-MATERIALIZE.

His eyes come alive.

18   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

On cue, the Power Rangers TELEPORT into the construction site.

They're surrounded by rock piles, pools of water and a plethora

of building supplies.  Billy looks down at the mud puddle he's

standing in.

They survey the construction site for a moment.

They advance up a slope -- the egg comes into view.

The kids get close to the egg, looking it over with

fascination.  Suddenly a hand falls on Aisha.

They all whirl around and see the first Security Guard.  He

half smiles, shaking his head.

CLOSE ON HIS FACE as it SHAPE-SHIFTS INTO THE+ HIDEOUS VISAGE OF

IVAN OOZE.

Ivan puts his hands to his face in mock fear.

He looks them over reproachfully.

Ivan raises both hands -- ELECTRICITY SHOOTS OUT HIS FINGERS

and the kids DIVE CLEAR as the bolt ZAPS A THRONG OF RATS.

Now, incredibly, the RATS GROWN INTO GRUNTING, SNARLING MAN

SIZED RAT-BEASTS.

Ivan raises his arms -- thunder CRACKLES and LIGHTNING RIPS

ACROSS THE SKY.

An EXPLOSION OF PURPLE SMOKE CONSUMES IVAN.

The RATS ATTACK!

Tommy gets off a stellar CROSS-HOCK TAKEDOWN, Kimberly delivers

a world class HEEL STOMP, Billy executes a lethal REVERSE

HANDSWORD.  Despite their valiant efforts, the Rangers ar

being overwhelmed by the fierce combatants.

19   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

SMOKE POURS from various circuit boards, numerous control

panels VIBRATE.

There's a BLEET, BLEET -- emergency lights start FLASHING near

the entrance.  Alpha watches, forlorn, as OOZE SEEPS through

the hairline cracks in the door.

The ooze SLITHERS AND GURGLES ACROSS THE FLOOR, once again

IVAN RISES UP.  He takes in the state-of-the-art surroundings.

Alpha drops into a Karate stance, makes some BRUCE LEE NOISES

then LUNGES.

Ivan holds his arm out, ZAPS Alpha with an electrical charge

Alpha starts spinning.

Ivan slowly circles Zordan's column of light, Zordon turns

with him.

IVAN raises his hands - he  is holding  a flute and he PLAYS A FEW

NOTES

He uses the flute like a lightning rod --  A BOLT OF LIGHTNING

BLASTS A PANEL TO SMITHEREENS.

He blows up another PANEL.

HE BLOWS UP ANOTHER PANEL.  Ivan CASTS ANOTHER LIGHTNING BOLT,

DEMOLISHING AN ENERGY PILLAR.

Now Ivan begins to THROW LIGHTNING EVERYWHERE, LAYING

THE  COMMAND CENTER TO WASTE.

Ivan laughs in the b.g.  as Alpha continues to spin,

moving  his arms in and out.

20   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

Two rats charge Aisha and she LEAPS UPWARD - the pair SMASH

into each other.

Rocky picks up a two-by-four and starts SPARRING with another

rat.

Billy SHOVES A HUGE WOODEN-SPOOL down a slope and it

ROLLS INTO A COUPLE OF RATS, BOWLING THEM OVER.

One rat CRACKS IT'S TAIL like a whip, KNOCKING Adam to

the ground.

Another rat gets Kimberly in a bear hug and she makes a

face.

She grabs a handful of his whiskers.

She YANKS THEM OUT, the rat SQUEALS and releases her.  The

fight well, but the rats start to get the upperhand.

The Rangers click their power coins into their power morphers.

They JUMP INTO THE AIR and they're ENGULFED IN A DAZZLING

GOLDEN LIGHT as we do a 3D MOVIE VERSION OF THEIR

TRANSFORMATION INTO COSTUME.

They all LAND and there's a WHIRRING SOUND as all six of the

face pieces POLARIZE so we can see their faces.  The rats

immediately scurry off.

A YELLOW BEAM SLICES THROUGH THE DARKNESS.  Aisha leads the

group through the site.

They pass a bulldozer, some scaffolding

They come to a stop.

AN AUTO-PHONIC RECEIVER POPS OUT of the side of Billy's

helmet.  As he turns his head, the receivers ROTATE.

SOUND EFFECT:  We hear silence and then... a RASPY

BREATHING, followed by a GUTTURAL SNARL.

The Rangers advance along a cement wall, slowly round a

corner.  Aisha's light PANS THROUGH THE GLOOM.

A SCOPE SNAPS into place over Rocky's left eye.

P.O.V.  - THROUGH POWER TRACKER

We see HEAT SENSOR OUTLINES, PULSATING WITH COLOR.  COMMAND

GRAPHIC:  SEARCH MODE.

Lines VECTOR and SCAN as Rocky searches the area.  Eventually

he looks up and the lines LOCK ON TO THE PULSATING FORMS  OF

THE RATS.

The creatures LEAP DOWN and we see the Rangers pull off

KICKS, SUCKER PUNCHES, SPINBACK-ROUNDHOUSES, you name it.

One of the beasts TACKLES Tommy and the pair go TUMBLING

OWN A TWENTY FOOT ROCK PILE.  Aisha picks up a handful of dirt

A beast turns -- Aisha FLINGS dirt in his eyes.

She follows through with an OVER SHOULDER THROW --

the beast CRASHES INTO A JOHNNY-ON-THE-SPOT.

Rocky fights another beast and the creature SWINGS

UP THROUGH SCAFFOLDING with phenomenal dexterity.  Rocky goes

after him.

The talking Saber appears in Tommy's hand.

Saba sees the rats.

We hear a PRIMITIVE CRY as a beast SLAMS INTO ADAM,

SENDS HIM CATAPULTING.  Adam rises, speaks in a low growl.

He holds his hand in the air.

The STEGA-STINGER appears in Adam`s hand.  He aims

it toward an overhang, FIRES.  A thin wire SHOOTS OUT -- the

Stinger at the end PIERCES the overhang.

Adam leaps off a platform, SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR like Tarzan,

SLAMS into the rat and sends him CATAPULTING.

A contraption APPEARS in Kimberly's hand and she throws her arm

out -- a LONG RIBBON SWIRLS out and tangles itself around the

rat.

She yanks the ribbon pulling the rat into an opening -- he

DISAPPEARS.

Billy takes a hit, ROLLS across the ground.  He stops inches

away from a twenty foot drop-off.

The beast CHARGES HIM, he ducks and the beast GOES FLYING

THROUGH THE AIR AND SPLASHES DOWN IN ONE OF THE MUDDY POOLS

OF WATER.

Rocky is now up in the scaffolding.  He DROPS TEN FEET through

the air, LANDS ON ONE END OF A BOARD.

There's a beast at the other end and he goes FLIPPING THROUGH

THE AIR.

Tommy throws Saba Saber and the knife SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR

and zings around the beasts as they try to knock him down.

The rats chase after Saba as he heads into a water-slicked

area.  There's a large power cable running across it.  Once

all the rats are in the water, Saba kamikaze dives into the

cable, SLICING IT OPEN WITH AN ERUPTION OF SPARKS.  The water

SIZZLES WITH ELECTRICITY and the rats GO UP IN A PUFF OF SMOKE.

We see the six original small rats scurry away, SQUEAKING.

Suddenly, there's an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY and the

Rangers watch, stunned, as their COSTUMES DE-MATERIALIZE and

they appear back in civilian clothes.

Billy tries his wrist communicator.

There's no response.

They all hit their communicators and nothing happens.

They hurry off.

21   EXT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT                         21

The Rangers climb a mountain path, all of them looking alarmed.

Up ahead, there's a PILLAR OF BLACK SMOKE rising from the

Command Center.

22   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT                          22

The place is trashed -- there's SMOKING debris, ravaged  panels,

exposed wires and mechanisms.  The kids move through the

wreckage in numb silence.

Adam spots Alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble.

The kids quickly uncover the battered robot.

Everybody follows Kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions

coming over them.

Laying on a destroyed bed of crystals is Zordon.  He is still a

SHIMMERING SPECTRAL being, only now he s aged a good fifty

years.

The kids stand over him, forlorn.

Zordon opens his eyes.

The kids drop down beside him.

The kids are stunned.  Kimberly gently takes Zordon's hand.

Zordon closes his eyes.  Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's

shoulder.  The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly

despondent.  Billy turns to Alpha.

Billy opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment.

Alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze.

SPARKS BURST from where his nose should be.  He SNIFFS.

Rocky hands Alpha a hanky, Alpha wipes his nose area.

Aisha turns to Alpha.

Alpha shakes his head.

Alpha heaves a sigh.

Alpha heaves a SIGH.

The kids exchange curious looks as Alpha opens a compartment

and removes a vile filled with RADIOLUMINESCENT ENERGY.

He approaches a damaged panel, loads in the vile.

Alpha gives them a grim look.

Alpha keys in coordinates.

Alpha shakes his head, punches in the final codes.

He pulls a lever.

The kids TRANSFORM INTO SIX STREAKS OF COLOR AND BLAST 0FF

THROUGH THE CEILING.  Alpha shakes his head in despair.

PAST the moon.

The CAMERA MOVES IN on Zedd's ominous palace which rises up out

of the tortured landscape.  Zedd, Rita, Mordant and Goldar are

standing on the balcony.

29   INT.  ZEDD'S PALACE - NIGHT                           29

Zedd, Rita and their minions are inside Zedd's dark palace

Goldar looks through Rita's telescope as Rita rants.

Goldar looks up from the telescope.

Ivan sweeps regally into the room.

Ivan SNAPS his hand -- a WAD OF OOZE FLIES OUT, SPLATS RITA

across the mouth, muffling her.

Ivan drops regally into Zedd's chair.

Mordant slips behind Goldar, using him as a shield.

Zedd SHOOTS A BLAST from his staff -- Ivan is COVERED IN SPARKS.

Ivan raises his hands and the sparks DISAPPEAR.

He ZAPS Rita and Zedd, and with a BRILLIANT FLASH, THEY'RE GONE.

Mordant moves to a snow-globe on the table, his mouth falling

open.  Zedd and Rita are INSIDE IT!!

Rita wipes the ooze off her mouth, RANTS IN A MUNCHKIN VOICE.

Ivan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant.

Mordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan.

Goldar throws a hand over Mordant's mouth, MUFFLING him.

He makes a HOARKING SOUND then SPITS OOZE ONTO THE FLOOR,

Now the OOZE GROWS INTO TEN TENGU WARRIORS -- BIRD-LIKE

CREATURES WITH LONG BEAKS AND ENORMOUS WINGS.

THEY GOBBLE, SQUAWK AND CHIRP like newborn chickens, the

CACOPHONY GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER until...

The Tengu fall dead silent.

The creatures make HORRENDOUS SQUAWKING SOUNDS AS THEY SPREAD

THEIR REPTILIAN WINGS.

One of the Tengu grabs hold of Mordant and the FLOCK WINGS OFF

LIKE COLOSSAL BATS.

ANGLE ON - SNOW GLOBE

Zedd waves his arms around in outrage.

He SPLASHES DOWN in a puddle.

The others quickly gather around him.

Billy looks down at the puddle.

They help Billy up then take in the exotic jungle environment.

They hear all sorts of EXOTIC ANIMAL SOUNDS.

Tommy gives them all an invigorating look.

Ivan is walking through a giant chemical plant with Goldar

Ivan shakes his head.

GOLDAR digs for buried treasure deep in his nose.

Ivan approaches an enormous vat, turns a tap -- it BURPS and

GLOPS as PURPLE OOZE pours out.

Bulk and Skull enter waving a "help wanted" flier.  Both

them are wearing their garish blazers and dark sunglasses.

Bulk does a G.Q. stance.

Ivan doesn't look too pleased.

Skull extends his hand.

Ivan steps forward.

Bulk and Skull lower the sunglasses and take a good look

Ivan.  Both of them swallow hard.

alert to all the UNEARTHLY SOUNDS around them.  Tommy watches

Kimberly, who seems to be lost in thought.

Kimberly glances up.

Kimberly takes a moment to answer.

The others nod in agreement.

Tommy's words sink in.  He stops suddenly, sensing something.

ANGLE ON - MORDANT hiding behind a tree, watching the Ranger's

pass.

There's a HORRIFIC SCREECH -- the kids look up as the TENGU

WARRIORS COME SWEEPING OUT OF THE SKY

It's too late.  The Tengu attack with unbelievable ferocity

They SLASH with their claws, STAB with their beaks and BATTER

with their wings.

Rocky is hurtled into some bushes, Aisha is knocked against a

tree, Adam splashes down in a small creek.  Mordant watches

of this from the sidelines.  He gets so excited that he starts

throwing punches and kicks.

He accidently punches a tree.

One of the Tengu gets Kimberly in a choke-hold,

Tommy rushes to help her and another Tengu trips him -- he

TUMBLES HEAD OVER HEELS DOWN A SLOPE.  We hear an OTHERWORDLY

CRY as a small, hunched figure wearing a tattered robe SWINGS

IN ON A VINE.

He proceeds to pull off what is nothing short of a miracle.

He uses the STICKS for weapons as he executes a ROUNDHOUSE

KICK, a SCISSOR-KICK TAKEDOWN, a SITTING SIDE KICK, a

ROUNDHOUSE DROP SPIN BACK KICK, a PARALLEL BLOCK FROM THE

OUTSIDE, a REVERSE HANDSWORD and so on.

The creature punctuates the hits with an exotic variation of

BRUCE LEE NOISES.

The Tengu SQUAWK and SQUEAL as the little dynamo WAILS ON THEM.

Finally the Tengu retreat, WINGING UP THROUGH THE TREES.

One of the Tengu SWOOPS IN AND SNATCHES Mordant up.

The Rangers recover and exchange expressions of utter disbelief

The figure speaks in a HOARSE WHISPER.

Now the most amazing thing happens.  The figure RISES TO FULL

HEIGHT OF SIX FEET, while simultaneously shedding it's robe.

Underneath is a SCANTILY CLAD, STUNNING AMAZONIAN WOMAN.  We're

talking B-U-I-L-T.  Meet the Master warrior, DULCEA.

The Rangers stand there with stunned expressions.  Dulcea looks

to Tommy.

Tommy just gapes.  Kimberly gives him a cold glance and THUNKS

him one with her elbow.

Kimberly intervenes.

She moves off - the Rangers just stand there staring at each

other.

The Rangers quickly follow her through the brush Aisha turns

DOZENS OF KIDS Ranging in age from eight to seventeen, are swarming

Bulk and Skull, who have set up a booth with a large banner

that reads:      "FREE OOZE!"

Some kids STRETCH the ooze, others MOLD it, others THROW it at

each other.  It's an ooze free-for-all.

Bulk and Skull run a booth.   A banner screams "OOZE RULES".

Kids crowd around.

Fred approaches.

Bulk and Skull exchange apprehensive looks.

Fred looks at the container in his hand but he doesn't open it.

Skull sees a kid HURL some ooze at him.

Skull ducks and Bulk gets SPLATTERED in the face.  Bulk glares at

Skull, wipes some goop off, FLICKS it at Skull.

Aisha stares into hers with a grim expression.

Kimberly lifts out an EEL-LIKE CREATURE, and watches it SQUIRM

Dulcea sprinkles hers with brown flakes.

The other Rangers watch as Billy holds one of the squirbs over

his mouth and drops it in.  He chews a few times, lets out  a

BURP.

Dulcea looks to Tommy.

Dulcea's eyes move from Ranger to Ranger.

Dulcea's words hang heavily in the air.

As Rocky is talking, a flubbery looking SNOUT works it's way

over Kimberly's shoulder.  She hasn't noticed it yet.

The snout works it's way underneath Kimberly's chin -- she

SCREAMS FOR ALL SHE'S WORTH.

INCLUDE - A TERRIFIED SNOGGLE.

This is Dulcea's ant-eater like assistant.   He jumps up and

down, YAMMERING and GESTICULATING.

Snoggle now re-fills Aisha's tea-cup.

We hear a PHOOT as Snoggle BLOWS A CUBE OF SUGAR OUT HIS SNOUT

AND IT SPLASHES INTO AISHA'S TEA.  Aisha stares at the cube a

moment.

The other Rangers watch as Billy holds one of the squibs above

his mouth and drops it in.  He chews a few times, lets out a

BURP.

43A   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE LANE - DAY   (OLD SC 40)                43A

Night has fallen on Angel Grove.  We PAN ACROSS a quiet, middle-

class neighborhood, settle on a two story house.

43B   INT.  LIVING ROOM / KELMAN-RESIDENCE - DAY   (OLD SC 41)  43B

CLOSE ON - OOZE CONTAINER

We PULL BACK to reveal it's sitting on a table.

Mr Kelman enters, looks it over curiously.  He picks it up,

opens it and sticks his finger inside.

Suddenly a CRACKLING ELECTRICAL CURRENT RUNS OVER HIS ENTIRE

BODY.  His face goes blank and his eyes momentarily GLOWS

PURPLE.  Now he strides purposefully out the door.

43C   thru   47   OMITTED

48   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                   48

Dulcea and the Rangers are gathered around a bird-bath stand

with FLAMES leaping out of it.

The kids hesitate a moment, then reluctantly put their hands

inside the flame.  Aisha makes a horrific expression...

They remove their hands -- they're filled with sand.

Aisha studies the sand for a moment -- it MAGICALLY TAKE ON

THE SHAPE OF A BEAR.

Dulcea turns to Rocky.  His sand MAGICALLY TAKES ON THE SHAPE

OF AN APE.

We see each of them DISCOVER THEIR ANIMAL.

And now Kimberly.  She studies hers for a moment.  It looks

like a bird.

Now Adam.

And finally, Tommy.

Kimberly regards Dulcea with true admiration.

Dulcea stands tall and proud.

48A   INT.  KELMAN HOUSE / LIVING ROOM  -  DAY   (OLD SC 44)    48A

Fred enters the living room and searches for his Dad.

Fred comes outside as several KIDS approach, all of them

looking forlorn.

Suddenly a WILD KID wearing grunge clothes runs by HOWLING LIKE

A BANSHEE.  He's holding a container of ooze in one hand and a

baseball bat in the other.  He SMASHES a couple of trash  cans

with his bat.

The kid BASHES IN a mailbox then runs off.  Fred looks

startled.

51   EXT.  DULGEA'S GARDEN - DAY                            51

Kimberly and Snoggle observe as Dulcea walks ON HER HANDS

across a narrow bamboo log that spans a pond.  A waterfall

churns in the b.g.

She leaps into the air, does a ROUND-HOUSE KICK, lands

perfectly on the narrow span.

Dulcea reaches the end of the log, flips through the air lands

flawlessly on the ground.

Kimberly heaves a sigh, climbs onto the bamboo and start

walking across, balancing precariously on her hands.

She gets about a quarter of the way, loses her balance, and

falls into the shallow pond.

Snoggle laughs, making a loud HONKING SOUND.  Kimberly

recovers, shoots him a look.

He marches to the pole, Dulcea holds him back.

53A   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                  53A

Dulcea and Rocky are standing at the bottom of a twenty foot pole

with an exotic oriental carving

Dulcea now SCRAMBLES UP THE POLE WITH THE NIMBLENESS OF A

SPIDER.  In less than ten seconds she reaches the top.  Rocky

shakes his head in disbelief.

Now she SLIDES DOWN like a firewoman, drops beside Rocky.  He

takes hold of the pole, focuses for a moment.

It starts SCURRYING UPWARD.  He gets about fifteen feet in the

air, loses his grip, PLUMMETS AND SLAMS TO THE GROUND.

54A   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY   (OLD SC 53)       54A

Dulcea and Billy circle one another, fighting with spinning

WHISTLING sticks.

Dulcea is blindfolded, Billy isn't.

Billy takes SWING after SWING -- Dulcea easily DEFLECTS every

blow.

Now Dulcea takes numerous SWINGS, THWACKING Billy repeatedly

and finally KNOCKING him INTO THE WATER.

54B   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                    54B

Dulcea, Adam and Snoggle stand in an area filled with FLYING

INSECTS.

We hear a TRILLING SOUND as Dulcea watches some kind of insect

dart around her.

THWAP!  The TRILLING SOUND is gone.  Dulcea has literally

caught the insect in the blink of an eye.  Adam shakes his head

in disbelief.

He waits a moment, hears a TAT-TAT-TAT sound and watches a

insect zip around him.  He lashes out numerous times,

missing the insect completely.

THWUMP!  With lightning speed Snoggle VACUUMS the fly into his

snout.  CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH.

Adam speaks under his breath.

54C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY   (OLD SC 52)    54C

Aisha watches as Dulcea goes into a bear stance.

Snoggle CHARGES Dulcea, SLAMS INTO HER.  She remains as rooted

as a tree.  Snoggle meanwhile suffers some serious bodily

damage.

Snoggle recovers and faces Aisha.  Aisha shrugs, goes into a

bear stance.  Snoggle charges, SLAMS INTO HER and sends HER

FLYING!

54F   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                  54F

Dulcea and Tommy are standing on a towering rock rising out of

a dark lake.

Now Dulcea does the impossible.  She LEAPS OFF THE ROCK, SOARS

FIFTY FEET through the air, AND LANDS on another protruding

rock.  Tommy is stunned.

Tommy psyches himself up.

He spreads his arms out, LEAPS... and DROPS LIKE A ROCK

exploding into THE BLACK WATER.

54G   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT      (OLD SC 54E)     54G

Alpha fusses over Zordon, who is looking a good ten years older.

Alpha looks out over the decimated Command Center.

Zordon shudders in pain, closes his eyes.  Alpha watches over

his mentor, shakes his head in anguish.

Dulcea leads the kids through a circular opening in one

wall, all of them look completely wiped out.  She reaches an

ornate doorway, faces the Rangers.

She heads through the door.

Snoggle points to the campfire.

He pushes Kimberly toward it making a "Na na na na na" sound

through his snout.  He then hurries inside and SLAMS the door.

The kids approach the dying fire, all of them limping a little.

They drop around the fire, a few of them GROANING.  They stare

into the orange coals for a long moment, all of them looking

disillusioned.

It takes a moment to get a response.

There's a somber silence.

They all settle in for the night.

55B   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE  -  NIGHT  (OLD SC 47) 55B

A PURPLE HAZE OF SMOKE has settled on the construction site.

Suddenly, mysteriously, SWARMS OF ZOMBIFIED PARENTS emerge from

the vapors - We see Mr. Kelman amongst them.

Ivan steps forward, followed by Goldar.

All the parents stop.

All the parents stand on one foot.  Ivan seems to be taking a

perverse glee in all this.

All the parents start QUACKING LIKE DUCKS.   Ivan slowly turns

to Goldar, gives him an icy stare.

Ivan turns back to the QUACKING parents.

The parents keep quacking.

(they shut up)

The zombie parents have already started going to work.  Ivan

shakes his head in exasperation.

55C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - NIGHT             55C

The Rangers are fast asleep.  A night wind WHISTLES through the

trees, causing the branches to shiver.

After a moment, there's movement in the bushes.  Suddenly,

amazingly, a WOLF emerges -- his mane glistening in the

moonlight, his eyes GLOWING LIKE FIRE.

He surveys the sleeping clan, moves straight toward Billy.  He

stands inches away from him, watches him with an intense gaze.

Billy stirs slightly.

The embers cast an orange glow on Kimberly's sleeping face

A SHADOW moves over her and two CRANE LEGS step into frame.

There's a FLURRY OF FLAPPING WINGS as a FALCON SWOOPS DOWN and

lands on a rock directly above Tommy.  The bird fixes on Tommy

with its piercing eyes.

We hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS:

Now a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from

Adam.  The frog sits there a moment, it's THROAT THROBBING

Now we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES.  Aisha fidgets in

her sleep as an ENORMOUS BEAR SHADOW FALLS OVER HER.

Now, all at once, the six animals VANISH INTO THIN AIR LIKE

SPIRITS OF THE NIGHT.

55D    EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT  (PART OLD SC 55B)     55D

Ivan and Goldar patrol the parents who are busy digging.

Goldar suddenly point to the sky.

THE TENGU DROPS INTO THE SCENE, SQUEALING

Mordant waves Ivan off.

The Tengu appear, one of them SQUAWKS and makes grand gestures.

The Tengu SQUAWKS some more.

A pensive look comes over Ivan...

To help make the point Mordant SPITS on the ground.

One of the Tengu SCREECHES again.

Ivan looks up to the sky.

LIGHTNING RIPS from the sky and ZAPS THE TENGU, CAUSING THEM TO

GLOW RADIANTLY.

He shoots a BOLT OF ENERGY AND CREATES THE OUEEN TENGU!  She is

a different color than the rest and her eyes GLOW RED.  Mordant

shakes his head in wonder.

The Queen spreads her wings and makes the most HORRENDOUS

SCREECH imaginable.

Once again, the Tengu take to the sky like GIANT BATS.

55E   EXT.  LONG SHOT OF DULCEA'S COMPOUND - SUNRISE (MATTE) 55E

Snoggle's snout works it's way toward her making SNORTING

SOUNDS.

Kimberly bolts awake and SLAMS his snout with her fist.  She

YELPS LIKE A CHILD as he grips the protrusion and JUMPS

UP AND DOWN.

All the Rangers spring awake.  As they get out from under their

blankets they're shocked to discover that they're all wearing

Ninjetti costumes with animal symbols on their chest.

Dulcea approaches, a wondrous expression on her face.

The Rangers continue to admire their symbols in silent wonder.

55H   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK - DAY   (OLD SC 55F)       55H

HUNDREDS OF KIDS AND TEENAGERS fill the park, all of them

wearing PURPLE CLOTHES.  They're all dirty and grunged out

They jump around, breaking stuff, sparring with each other

It's total pandemonium.

Suddenly, an ERUPTION OF SMOKE -- and Ivan, disguised as the

wizard, MAGICALLY APPEARS.  The crowd CHEERS, Nuremburg style,

fists raised.

At the edge, Fred discreetly approaches Bulk and Skull.

Bulk and Skull exchange a look.

Fred decides to be tricky.

Fred nods.

He does a ridiculous mock salute.  Bulk and Skull repeat it.

Fred rolls his eyes and hurries away.

approach a bush filled with exotic berries.  All of them start

eating the berries.

Dulcea reminisces.

The kids are overwhelmed by what they're hearing.

The Rangers are silent for a moment.

Dulcea speaks with grim-visaged intensity.

These words strike deep in the kids.

59   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY                    59

The bulldozers and earth movers have dug out a twenty foot pit.

IVAN leads Goldar and Mordant through the site, passing dozens

of laboring parents.

The entourage comes to a stop, Goldar and Mordant can't believe

what's before them.

INCLUDE - A HUGE MECHANICAL ARM AND LEG EXTRUDING FROM THE DIRT.

ANGLE ON FRED as he darts through the construction site, taking

care not to be seen.  He hunkers down behind a stack of

two-by-fours, searches the area.  He spots his dad, speaks under

his breath.

He glances around to make sure the coast is clear, then sprints

off to where his dad is digging, grabs his hand.

Mr. Kelman just gives Fred a blank stare.

Suddenly an ARM FALLS ON FRED'S SHOULDER.

Fred whips araund, finds Mordant standing behind him.     He

SPRINGS TO ACTION pulling off a lightning quick IRON HAMMER

FIST STRIKE, a PALM HEEL BLOCK, A FRONT KICK WITH JUMPING

KICK.

Mordant is getting pummeled.  The last kick sends him FLYING

BACK INTO THE DIRT.  Fred takes off as Goldar stands over

Mordant.

Alpha continues making adjustments.

He flicks a switch and the screen LIGHTS UP WITH STATIC.  The

There's more STATIC, then IVAN APPEARS AS THE WIZARD.

As Ivan speaks we see Mordant behind him waving into camera.

The group reaches the crest of a ridge -- off in the background

we can see the outline of the Nathadian Monolith.

The kids strain to get a better look.

The kids are thrown by this.

The kids share glances, not quite knowing what to say.

Dulcea gives them a grim look.

Aisha nods.

Dulcea catches her hand and six Rangers put their hands on top

of hers.

The parents have finished assembling the STEEL TOWER -- thick

cables run from the base to the skeletal heads of Hornitor and

Scorpitron.

We see a group of parents fastening clear plastic pipes to the

skeletal feet -- the pipes are attached to the vat of ooze.

Mordant videotapes Ivan as he struts past a giant mechanical

foot.

Mordant gets the camera a little too close to Ivan.

Ivan SWATS Mordant and the camera FLIES up through the air and

SMASHES against a wall.

ANGLE ON - FRED watching from behind a generator, an alarmed look

on his face.  Ivan steps up onto a platform.

Mordant pulls a lever and the OOZE SLITHERS THROUGH THE

PIPES AND STARTS FILLING OUT THE GIANT EXOSKELETONS.

Goldar presses a button and the roof of the plant ROLLS OPEN,

REVEALING THE TUMULTUOUS SKIES ABOVE.

Ivan holds his arms up to the heavens.

THE SKY CRACKLES WITH THUNDER AND A JAGGED BOLT OF LIGHTNING

STREAKS DOWN, ZAPS THE METAL TOWER SENDING UP AN ENORMOUS

ERUPTION OF SPARKS!

ELECTROMAGNETIC CHARGES TRAVEL THE LENGTH OF THE CABLES AND HIT

HORNITOR AND SCORPITRON WITH SEARING BLASTS OF ENERGY.

Mordant admires Ivan.

Now the most amazing thing of all happens...

The SCINTILLATING BEHEMOTHS AWAKE FROM THE DEAD, THEIR EYES AND

MOUTHS OPENING, THEIR ARMS REACHING UPWARD.  The beasts ROAR

OUT IN THUNDEROUS RAGE.

Mordant's HAIR LITERALLY STANDS ON END -- he quickly retreats

behind a drum.

FRED looks on in horror.

All of them turn their attention to Ivan.

The parents just stand there with blank expressions.

Goldar taps him on the shoulder and he spins around.

Ivan shakes his head dismally.

67   EXT.  ROPE BRIDGE -  DAY                              67

The Rangers crest a hill and Adam, who's in the lead, suddenly

drops down - the others following suit.

They peer over the ridge -- their eyes wide.

Before them, a tenuous rope bridge leads to a vast rock landing.

The ocean RAGES BELOW.

On top of the island is the Nathadian Monolith.  It's a  mind-

boggling wonder from another time and place.

Between the Rangers and the bridge, the Tengu Warriors are on

patrol.

Kimberly surveys the area.

Tommy pulls all of them into a huddle.

68   EXT.  ROPE BRIDGE -  DAY                                  68

The Tengu are on full alert.  One of them hears something,

snaps around, there's nothing there.

Another Tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg.  He

SCREECHES and STOMPS down his taloned foot, missing the

creature by inches.

We hear a CAW and the Queen Tengu squints as she spots a falcon

circling in the sky above.  The Queen is perched on top of a 20

foot rock face. She looks around hesitantly.

Now the Rangers ATTACK, some of them LUNGING OFF ROCKS, others

BURSTING out of crevices, others coming over the walls.

Billy wields his WHISTLING sticks -- misses several times, then

starts BASHING and THWACKING the feathered beasts.

The Queen SHOOTS A LASER BLAST from her eyes -- it EXPLODES

before Tommy.

Kimberly battles another Tengu and the creature forces her back

on to the rickety bridge.

The Queen FIRES ANOTHER BLAST.

Rocky DIVES, knocking Aisha away from the bolt.

Adam and one of the Tengu circle each other warily.

Suddenly the Tengu is HURTLED BACKWARD TEN FEET THROUGH THE

AIR.  We didn't even see Adam move.

Tommy steps up behind a Tengu.

The Tengu turns around and Tommy WHALLOPS HIM WITH A SPINNING-

HEEL KICK.  A Tengu faces down Aisha and she goes into a bear

stance.

The Tengu CHARGES LIKE A BULL, SLAMS INTO AISHA.  She holds

fast and the bird EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS.

Kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she

EXCHANGES BLOWS with her foe.

She finally drops into a crane stance... then just like Dulcea

she LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR, EXECUTES A BRUTAL SPINNING HELL KICK

and sends the birdman TUMBLING OFF THE BRIDGE.

In a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly

back on the swinging bridge.

Billy swings his sticks, BASHES one of the Tengu in the beak --

the creature EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS!

Tommy reaches the top of a rack.  He sees a Tengu making a

KAMIKAZE DIVE TOWARD KIMBERLY.  TOMMY DIVES, SOARING THIRTY

FEET THROUGH THE AIR -- HE INTERCEPTS THE TENGU AND THEY SPIN

TOWARD EARTH TOGETHER.  They HIT the ground and EXCHANGE BLOWS

AS THEY FALL OVER ONE ANOTHER.

Rocky SLAMS another Tengu in the beak, KABLAM  -- the creature

is OBLITERATED.

Tommy LEAPS INTO THE AIR, NAILS two Tengu in the beaks.  They

BOTH BURST IN AN EXPLOSION OF FEATHERS.

The Queen shoots another BOLT OF ENERGY --  a rock EXPLODES,

SHOWERING THE KIDS WITH SHRAPNEL.  Aisha turns to Rocky.

Rocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position.

Incredibly he SCALES THE WALL IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT UP THE

POLE.  HE FLIPS OVER THE TOP and lands right before the Queen

Tengu.  He looks her dead in the eye.

With that, he executes a devastating SPINNING-HEEL KICK and the

Queen BURSTS INTO OBLIVION.

Instantly, the remaining Tengu retreat, SQUAWKING and CAWWING  in

rage.  The kids turn to eaeh other, sharing in a moment of triumph.

72   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE TOWER - DAY                               72

We're on top of a high tower overlooking the entire city

There's a BURST OF PURPLE SMOKE -- Ivan, Mordant and Goldar

appear.  Ivan looks out on the city, holds up his arms

theatrically.

HORNITOR APPEARS on the street ROARING like a fiend.  His

enormous foot DROPS DOWN AND CRUSHES A CAR INTO OBLIVION.

SCORPITRON APPEARS on the street and BASHES IN THE SIDE OF A

BUILDING, SENDING GLASS AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE.

Mordant turns to Ivan and throws his arms up in jubilation.

The kids climb up on top of the rock bluff -- before them is a

huge black Monolith.  There's all sorts of charred bones and

skeletons strewn around it, some of them human, some of them

alien.

They approach the massive block, stand before it in awe struck

silence.  In the middle of the Monolith there's a large circle

with the six animals of the Ninjetti carved into it.

Kimberly looks at all the bones -- instinctively puts her hand

on her animal symbol.

A few of the kids walk around the Monolith, examining it more

closely.

Billy &;Tommy latch their hands over the block, searching for

an opening.

Rocky steps back, THROWS HIS SHOULDER into the Monolith with a

THUMP, winces in pain.

The kids exchange discouraged looks.

The kids look crestfallen.

Suddenly a SIZZLE OF ELECTRICITY forms in front of them.

The kids mouth's fall open as... a HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF

ZORDON'S WITHERED FACE APPEARS.  He speaks in a barely

audible voice.

Zordon's image FLICKERS a few times then STABILIZES again.

His IMAGE FLICKERS then FADES AWAY.

Billy studies the circle with zealous eyes.

They silently assemble in a line, all of them interlock:

hands.  They face the Monolith with fire in their eyes.

A mysterious HALO OF LIGHT SHROUDS the Rangers and they dissapear

INTO THIN AIR.

The kids BURST THROUGH A WALL OF LIGHT and come down together

inside a vast cavern.  There's a pyramid shaped steel object in

the center of the room, a RADIANT LIGHT SHINING FROM IT.

The kids advance toward the pyramid.

Adam notices their symbols are glowing.

The kids ogle the radiant emblems.  Kimberly takes hold of hers

and it COMES OFF in her hand -- there's a mirror on the other

side.

Kimberly looks at her reflection and primps her hair.  The

other's remove their symbols.

All of them turn their mirrors toward the pyramid.  A BEAM OF

LIGHT SHOOT FROM THE POWER; INTO THE MIRRORS AND BACK IN TO THE

POWER.

We hear a RUMBLING SOUND as the earth starts to SHAKE.  The

Rangers look to each other, horrified.

Then everything falls still and silent... and then a miracle

happens.

We hear a HARMONIOUS, OTHERWORLDLY CHORUS as the pyramid OPENS

UP, REVEALING THE MOST GLORIOUS SOURCE OF LIGHT IN THE

UNIVERSE.

The kids shield their eyes from the brilliance, all of them

wearing wonder-struck expressions.

SIX BEAMS OF COLORED LIGHT SHOOT OUT AND HIT EACH OF THE

RANGERS...  AND THEIR POWER RANGERS UNIFORMS MATERIALIZE ON

THEM!  Their visors are clear so we can see their faces.

Now the symbols in their hands TRANSFORM INTO...

They hit their communicators -- they instantly TRANSFORM INTO

SIX IRIDESCENT COLUMNS OF COLOR AND BLAST OFF.

The place falls silent.

Enraged, they move in on Fred.

The crowd gets angrier.  They move closer... Fred gulps with

fear... glancing around for help, he notices a HOSE.  He lunges

for it, cranks on the water, and TURNS IT ON THE CROWD!

SPLASH!  They get SPRAYED DOWN!

Suddenly -- they stop in their tracks, slowly blinking,

confused.  The spell is broken.  We hear: "What's going on ?!"

"What am I doing here?!", etc.

He hurries off.  A few follow him, then a few more... until

pretty soon everybody joins him.  Bulk and Skull share a look.

Bulk considers the dilemma.

Skull nods, relieved.  They gather up the pizza and move off

78    INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT                               78

The Rangers MATERIALIZE in the Command Center with their

helmets off.

Alpha approaches, speaks in an anguished voice.

The Rangers are too stunned to speak.  They approach Zordon's

lifeless form looking absolutely devastated.

They stare at Zordon with gut-wrenching expressions.  They're

utterly defeated.

Eventually, Tommy looks to the others and speaks in a fervent

voice.

The kids gradually exchange zealous looks.  They form a circle

around Zordon and interlock hands.

They close their eyes, bow their heads...

After a long moment, a SHIMMERING ENERGY BEGINS TO FLOW DOWN

FROM THE RANGERS, INTO ZORDON'S ASTRAL FORM.

Zordon grows BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER and then there's a DAZZLING,

STROBOSCOPIC EXPLOSION.

When the LIGHT FADES WE SEE THE COMMAND CENTER BACK IN ITS

ORIGINAL, PRISTINE FORM.

Zordon's youthful face once again looks down from within his

pillar of light, his eyes filled with a fierce pride.

Alpha jumps up and down like a child.

Alpha sees the Ecto-Morphicon machines on the VIEWING GLOBE.

They TELEPORT out.

79   EXT.   ANGEL GROVE TOWER - NIGHT                            79

CLOSE ON IVAN as he TURNS INTO CAMERA, a startled look on his face.

He looks down on the street as the COLUMNS OF LIGHT SHOOT DOWN

AND THE POWER RANGERS APPEAR.

80   EXT.  CITY STREETS                                          80

The Rangers watch as Hornitor and Scorpitron come THUNDERING

down the street toward them.

We hear Alpha on Tommy's wrist communicator.

One after another they click their new coins into their

morphers and go into their stances.

From the sky, the six new ANIMAL ZORDS BURST FORTH LIKE

THUNDERING, MECHANICAL GODS.  The Rangers look up at the

TOWERING ASSAULT VEHICLES in awe.

81   INT.   COCKPITS                                             81

respective cockpits.

81A   EXT.  MONORAIL STATION - NIGHT   (OLD SC 69)               81A

Fred, Bulk and Skull watch a sleek monorail pulling in.  Skull

talks with a mouth full of pizza.

The train glides to a complete stop and the doors SLIDE OPEN .

The youngsters pile through the doors, quickly filling up the

entire monorail.

81B   EXT.  CITY STREET                                          81B

The parents round a corner, advance down the street like machines.

82    EXT.   THE ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES                         82

ATTACK WITH A RELENTLESS FEROCITY.  There's all kinds of

CRASHING and BASHING and EXPLOSIONS!

There's a BLAM, BLAM, BLAM as Scorpitron REPEATEDLY FIRES his

cannon arm at the Bear Zord, who in turn DEFLECTS THE VOLLEYS.

Hornitor shoots a BLAST from it's stinger, the Crane Zord

dodges the FIERY ERUPTION.

Scorpitron repeatedly KICKS at the Frog Zord with it's BLADED

FEET, SENDING UP OSCILLATORY DISCHARGES, at the same time

SLASHING WITH IT'S LETHAL CLAWS.

Hornitor BORES IT'S DRILL ARM INTO THE APE ZORD, SENDING

EXPLOSIONS OF SPARKS.

The Bear Zord CHARGES HORNITOR and the two Mastodons go

CRASHING BACKWARD.

Hornitor SEARS the Wolf Zord with it's needle-nose.  In

retaliation, the Wolf Zord POUNCES, KNOCKING HORNITOR INTO THE

STREET.  Now the Falcon Zord SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR.

He FIRES BOOSTER ROCKETS, STRAFING SCORPITRON WITH AN INTENSE

FUSILLADE.

Hornitor gets back up -- the Ape Zord SWINGS DOWN FROM

BILLBOARD, RAMS HIM FEET FIRST, SENDS HIM CATAPULTING BACK.

Scorpitron FIRES A VOLLEY at the Frog Zord -- the Zord BOUNDS

THROUGH THE AIR, AVOIDING THE BLAST, COMES CRASHING DOW ON TOP

OF SCORPITRON.

The Falcon Zord swoops in and blasts Scorpitron who BLOWS UP

INTO A BILLION FLAMING PARTICLES!

Mordant and Goldar watch popeyed as IVAN'S BODY STRETCHES OUT

LIKE A HUGE PIECE OF GUM.

He STRETCHES and STRETCHES until his head BURSTS THROUGH THE

STOMACH OF SCORPITRON.

We hear a resounding SNAP AS IVAN'S FEET ARE RELEASED FROM THE

ROOFTOP AND HIS ENTIRE BEING SPURTS INSIDE THE GIANT'S BELLY.

Now there's all sorts of GURGLING and SLURPING sounds as the

monster's face SHAPE-SHIFTS INTO IVAN'S FACE!

He grins, revealing his silver tooth.

There's amazing PYROTECHNICS AS FIVE ANIMAL ZORDS MERGE

TOGETHER AND TRANSFORM INTO THE NINJA MEGAZORD.

82A   INT.  COMMAND CENTER                                       82A

controls.

84   EXT.  MAIN STREET                                           84

There's plenty of GRINDING and SCRAPING as the MEGAZORD RISES

UP TO ITS FULL, TOWERING HEIGHT.

The behemoths CHARGE each other and the mother of all battles

begins.

85   EXT.  GREENWAY STREET - NIGHT                               85

The battle continues.  Remarkably, these enormous machines pull

off DOUBLE PUNCHES, DROP KICKS, ROUNDHOUSE HOOKS, SPINBACK

KICKS -- YOU NAME IT!

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM -- The Megazord STRAFES Ivan/Scorpitron

with EXPLODING MISSILES.

Ivan/Scorpitron SINGES the Megazord with a DEVASTATING LASER

BLAST, SENDING IT TUMBLING BACKWARD.

The Falcon Zord SWOOPS IN, STRAFING Ivan/Scorpitron with

gunfire.  Ivan/Scorpitron now turns to Angel Grove Tower and

grabs hold of it.

88   EXT.   TOWER                                                88

Mordant grabs on to Goldar.

Goldar TAKES FLIGHT with Mordant CLINGING DESPERATELY TO ONE OF

HIS LEGS.

89   EXT.  MAIN STREET                                           89

Ivan/Scorpitron RIPS THE TOWER OUT AND USES IT AS A SWORD TO

BATTLE THE MEGAZORD.

The giant SWINGS THE TOWER, BATTERING THE MEGAZORD MERCILESSLY.

The POWER SWORD DROPS FROM THE HEAVENS, PIERCES THE GROUND.

Megazord grips the handle, raises it to the sky.

The sword is STRUCK BY THUNDERBOLTS and now the behemoths SLASH

and PARRY WITH CATACLYSMIC BURSTS OF SPARKS.

Ivan/Scorpitron takes a swing and the TOWER SMASHES INTO

MONORAIL, SHATTERING A TWENTY FOOT SECTION OF AN OVERPASS

Ivan/Scorpitron continues backing the Megazord toward an

enormous power station.

He takes a final, DEVASTATING BLOW, SENDS MEGAZORD HURTLING

THROUGH THE AIR AND DOWN INTO GIANT GENERATORS.

There's an APOCALYPTIC FIREWORKS DISPLAY AS TEN MILLION VOLTS

COURSE THROUGH MEGAZORD.

90   INT. COCKPIT                                                90

Rolls clear, SMOKE AND SPARKS SPITTING FROM ITS JOINTS.

IVAN PICKS UP THE PROSTRATE MEGAZORD, RAISES IT OVER HIS HEAD AND THROWS

IT.

He HURTLES THE MEGAZORD INTO A BUILDING with a sign that

"Angel Grove First National Bank".  The ENTIRE SIDE OF THE

BUILDING IS DEMOLISHED.

and continues down the tracks.

The kids watch as Ivan reaches the top of the building, gazes

up at the stormy skies.

There's more SLURPING and BUBBLING AS HIDEOUS, BAT-LIKE WINGS

ERUPT FROM HIS BACK.

The wings FAN OUT and Ivan/Colossus DIVES INTO THE AIR AND

SOARS UP INTO THE HEAVENS.

Fred is standing beside the water truck holding a large hose

Bulk and Skull are in the truck cabin trying to start the

engine.  It turns over but it won't catch.

The parents are now five feet from the drop off.

Bulk turns the key again and the engine starts up.

He LETS IT RIP -- A POWERFUL JET OF WATER ARCS THROUGH THE AIR

AND SHOWERS DOWN ON THE PARENTS.

They're about a foot away from the drop when they come to a

standstill, all of them sharing confused looks.

There's all sorts of CHEERS as parents and kids are reunited.

Fred runs into his father's arms.

Bulk turns to Skull, holds out his arms.

They embrace -- Skull practically gets crushed by his burly

friend.
