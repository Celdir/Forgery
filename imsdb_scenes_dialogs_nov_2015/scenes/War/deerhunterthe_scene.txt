The Deer Hunter

EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAY

The plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley

under five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon

across the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering through

the windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of

guyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents and

chimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the

clanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted

by the falling snow.

In the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- which

inhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly

down the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sad

looking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by

the skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrow

sidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwiched

between the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the

hillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which run

to three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of

toppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are

all connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility

lines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional

aid from a leaning pole.

MUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as

we watch a car come charging up through the slush on

Columbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on the

slippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears,

huddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears AS

CAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTY

STREET.

MAIN TITLE COMES UP:

INT. STEEL MILL - DAY

A white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and

comes ripping down a track. Another ingot follows it, and

another and another and another. The ingots are huge,

trembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifying

rumble.

CREDITS ROLL

UNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots with

tongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERS

wear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped in

heat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures

in some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it is

hard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who

are young, who seem to work with particular grace. These are

NICK, SAL and MERLE.

CREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noise

is deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on

with murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pause

MERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL.

SAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICK

make the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips,

gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLE

and NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he starts

laughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track

again and they all grab their tongs.

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - ALTAR - DAY

A very old PRIEST is making preparations for a wedding

ceremony. SAL'S MOTHER hovers around him as he unlocks a

cabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which

will be used in the service. The PRIEST moves with agonizing

slowness and SAL's MOTHER is in the midst of a bad case of

nerves.

SAL'S MOTHER puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into

tears.

The PRIEST smiles. He takes SAL'S MOTHER in his arms and

comforts her.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

Another car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides

back. As the car disappears, the door to one of the houses

bursts open and a group of giggling BRIDESMAIDS begin

scampering across the street. They have all been working on

their dresses, which are not completely finished, and they

all carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material. As

they make their way to the other side of the street they all

wave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support. One

of the BRIDESMAIDS loses her dress entirely and with everyone

laughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip. When the

garment is repossessed a door comes open and the BRIDESMAIDS

disappear inside.

CAMERA HOLDS ON COLUMBINE STREET. The snow slants across the

little stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little

houses. Another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides

back. Suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group

of OLDER WOMEN emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a

miniature bride and groom standing on the top. The WOMEN are

all in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats.

They begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow,

with the great white cake held firmly between them.

INT. STEEL MILL - ENTRY AREA - DAY

The time clocks are lined against both walls. As a whistle

screams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin

checking out. NICK, SAL and MERLE are right up in the front

ranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather

together along the wall.

ALBERT -- six and a half feet tall and built like an ox --

changes course and plows across the river of homeward-bound

STEELWORKERS.

ALBERT wades back into the stream of STEELWORKERS, grabs

VINCE and they all push out together.

EXT. STEEL MILL - PARKING LOT - DAY

The snow is still falling. It covers the ground. It covers

the acres of parked cars. It swirls and tosses and blows. As

the five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all

stop dead in their tracks.

SAL gives a look at the others. Something is going on. VINCE

is so excited he begins hopping around.

They all know. They all know damn well. MERLE and NICK

exchange looks. ALBERT chortles.

The others nod, shrug, shuffle their feet. They are all a

little embarrassed.

A look at the others...

Now SAL is embarrassed. He makes a gesture with his hand.

They all start into the swirling snow. NICK with an arm

around SAL.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DAY

The place is large and drafty and rundown. A huge American

flag hangs from the middle of the ceiling. Under it WOMEN are

laying white table cloths on trestle tables. Off to one side

a half dozen OLD MEN wearing VFW hats are Scotch-taping paper

ribbons to the brick wall. Two OLD MEN are on stepladders,

two more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under

the direction of a pair of World War I VETS standing side by

side. Their hands tremble. Their four eyes loom huge behind

corrective lenses.

One end of the ribbon is moved up. The two VETS study it.

Suddenly there is a commotion. The WOMEN who are setting up

the tables all rush to the door as the OLDER WOMEN come in

with the wedding cake. The OLDER WOMEN look half-frozen and

as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus

of Uhh's and Ahh's. Suddenly one of the OLDER WOMEN

collapses. Friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and

give her wine. The WOMAN takes the glass, tosses it off in

one swallow and grins. EVERYONE laughs.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - BOTTOM OF HILL - DAY

A big, battered old shark-finned black Cadillac approaches,

coming fast.

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

NICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE and ALBERT are all laughing. NICK is

at the wheel.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

The car bangs over potholes and slams into the grade. We

watch as it reaches the half-way point, then the three

quarter mark...

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

NICK bends forward over the wheel, peering out through the

slapping wipers.

The car fishtails, loses speed... to a creep.

ALBERT and MERLE, who are sitting in front, immediately throw

themselves into the back seat on top of SAL and VINCE.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY

The Cadillac inches up the last ten feet, gains level ground

and skids to a stop. From inside comes a MUTED CHEER.

INT. BRIDE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

ANGELA is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil. She is

plump, pretty, with a solemn, round face and big brown eyes.

ANGELA leans forward into a mirror.

A pause. ANGELA scowls and tries it again.

ANGELA tries it a few more times. It sounds worse and worse.

ANGELA stares at herself. Now she looks desperate and

unrelievedly forlorn. Bursting into tears she throws herself

on the bed. Someone has slipped a photograph under the

pillow. The photograph is face down and as ANGELA pulls it

out she sees that something is written on the back:

ANGELA frowns, turns the photograph over. It is a picture of

Michaelangelo's "David". ANGELA stares at the figure for a

long, long moment...

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY

The place is packed with boisterous STEELWORKERS drinking

boilermakers. Deerheads are mounted in a long row over the

bar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls. The murals

depict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once

comical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret

from the hunters, some power beyond their own.

JOHN bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer. At

the same moment SAL comes in with NICK, MERLE, ALBERT and

VINCE. JOHN, who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his

tray, wraps his arms around SAL and begins jumping him around

the floor, grinning ear to ear. The STEELWORKERS turn, desert

their places and swarm around SAL, joking and shouting

congratulations.

INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

LINDA is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly

lovely face. Wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone

in the kitchen, staring at the ceiling. Thumping noises are

coming from the room above. The thumping gets louder.

There is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were

being thrown around. A MAN'S VOICE begins cursing and there

is more thumping and crashing. Suddenly there is a thud...

and then silence.

LINDA bites her lip. She crosses to the stove, ladles stew

into a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it

all on a tray.

INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - FATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

The room is a wreck of broken furniture. Chairs are turned

over, lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the

wall. In the middle of the room, face down on the floor, is

LINDA'S FATHER. His coat is torn, one shoe is missing and he

holds a half-empty bottle in his hand. Behind him, through

the open window, snow is blowing in.

LINDA comes in with the tray. She stands for a moment

expressionless, looking down at her father. Then she sets the

tray on the bureau and kneels beside him.

LINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and

rolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes

up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles

from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it

seaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins

cursing again.

LINDA gets up and closes the window. She comes back, gets

down on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the

bed. Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by

the shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet. The

effort is almost too much for her. Tears begin to burn in her

eyes, but when he slips back she tries again. The father

groans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him

on the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in

the face and pushes her violently across the room.

LINDA crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into

the wall. As she gets to her feet her father advances on her.

He swings, catches her in the face again, hard.

LINDA'S FATHER swings at her again, loses his balance and

falls on the floor. LINDA stands looking at him, holding her

jaw. She is crying. Tears are streaming down her face.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY

Seven MUSICIANS, carrying their instruments, file silently

through the falling snow.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND JOHN'S BAR - DAY

The WOMEN are all gathered, some fifteen or twenty, ranging

from grandmothers to young wives. About half of them wield

rolling pins or heavy pans. As the last reinforcements arrive

-- TWO HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS -- a roar of laughter

comes from inside.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY

NICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are dancing. The

MUSIC is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut

with a knife. Suddenly, from the back, comes a CHORUS OF

SCREECHES AND FEMALE RECRIMINATIONS. The door to the alley

bursts open and the HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS appear. The

STEELWORKERS take one look, gulp their drinks, grab their

heads in their hands and rush for the front door.

EXT. JOHN'S BAR - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

The STEELWORKERS stream into the snow with the WOMEN close

behind. Several blows are delivered and the howls of

complaint are met with angry commands to hurry and get

dressed for Sal's wedding.

CAMERA CLOSES ON SAL, who emerges with NICK and MERLE. The

snow hits him a sobering blow and he comes to a stop.

SAL'S MOTHER hurries out of the alley. She is crying.

She throws herself in SAL's arms, sobbing.

SAL throws a look to NICK and MERLE. They gesture with

sympathy and study the snow flakes.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

The trailer is a dented two-tone pink and cream job which

looks as if it had been purchased third-hand off a

construction site. It stands on cinder blocks in a small lot

which has been cut out of the side of the hill. A wrecked

school bus decorates it to the right. On the left is a bare

branched tree. NICK's black Cadillac is parked in front and a

light shows from inside the trailer.

CAMERA PICKS UP MERLE who is strolling toward the trailer

whistling through his teeth. He is wearing his tuxedo and

carries a knapsack and a deer rifle. He mounts the cinder

block steps and pounds on the trailer door. NICK opens the

door and waves him in.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

The place is cramped, littered with camping paraphernalia. A

deer head is mounted above the sink and NICK, who is half

into his tuxedo, is applying waterproofing to a pair of heavy

boots. MERLE smiles, throws his kit on the stove and sits.

Pause.

NICK grins, takes down his rifle and begins wiping the oil

off it.

Cursing and banging from outside. NICK opens the door. JOHN

and ALBERT, both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are

pounding on the trunk of the Cadillac, trying to get it open.

NICK and MERLE go out.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

ALBERT hits the trunk in the indicated spot and the lid snaps

open.

NICK nods.

VINCE comes up, also in tuxedo, and dragging a totally

disorganized clutter of hunting gear behind him.

ALBERT looks around at his friends. He surveys the back end

of the Cadillac with simian pride. Then he expands his chest,

thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent,

mile-carrying Tarzan call. As the echo of it comes back the

church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of

excited BRIDESMAIDS come, hurrying up.

As the BRIDESMAIDS begin straightening ties and putting on

carnations, NICK hears someone call his name. He turns to

find LINDA standing beside the trailer where she can't be

seen. She looks pale and very frightened and she holds a

small suitcase in her hand.

She fights against it but the tears begin to come. NICK looks

around, pulls her inside the trailer.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

NICK clears a place on the couch. LINDA sits, holding her

suitcase in her lap.

LINDA nods - a solemn nod.

LINDA's lip begins to tremble. Tears stand in her eyes and

she gives a little toss of her head.

NICK stares at her. He can still hardly believe it.

LINDA nods. She is suddenly excited, suddenly radiantly

happy. She takes the suitcase off her lap and throws herself

in NICK's arms.

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - NIGHT

SAL and ANGELA stand facing each other as the PRIEST reads

the Holy Sacrament of Marriage.

As the PRIEST continues with the Holy Sacrament CAMERA PICKS

UP FACES IN THE CONGREGATION. We see SAL'S FAMILY. We see

ANGELA'S FAMILY. We see the VETS from the V.F.W. Post. We see

the STEELWORKERS from the bar and the WIVES and MOTHERS who

chased them home to change. They are hard faces -- working

class faces -- but we sense a fortitude among the

congregation, a community of both heart and spirit.

CAMERA PICKS UP NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN standing

in a row opposite the BRIDESMAIDS. The guys all look slightly

disheveled. Their tuxedos are all too small and their shoes

are soaking wet from walking in the snow.

NICK catches LINDA's eye and they hold each other across the

intervening space like two children who are amazed.

The PRIEST hands white tapers to the bride and groom. CAMERA

CLOSES SLOWLY ON THE PRIEST. The man is impressive -- gentle

yet full of power. The PRIEST lights the tapers -- first

ANGELA's, then SAL's -- and looks out across the assembled

congregation.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF THE HILL - NIGHT

Save for a lone figure trudging home, the street is deserted,

left to the gently falling snow. In the background the

massive silhouette of the steel mill is plainly visible, lit

with fire.

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - NIGHT

NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN join with the BRIDESMAIDS

to assist the PRIEST in the crowning of SAL and ANGELA.

The PRIEST crowns SAL first.

Now ANGELA is crowned.

Guiding the couple by their joined hands the PRIEST leads SAL

and ANGELA around the analoy. The movement is very precise,

very formal, a circling to represent eternity.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

The Band is going full blast and the whirling COUPLES, young

and old, are laughing.

We see SAL and ANGELA, NICK and LINDA, VINCE, ALBERT and

JOHN. The only one of the group not dancing is MERLE. MERLE

is drinking, standing alone on the side of the floor chugging

beer in tense, rapid-fire gulps. We sense immediately that he

feels out of place, at a loss to join spontaneously in the

spirit of the party. MERLE finishes the beer, crumples the

can and starts on another. As he picks up the second can he

notices that a SAD-LOOKING GIRL is sitting against the wall

behind him, waiting for someone to ask her to dance. The SAD

LOOKING GIRL gives MERLE a smile. MERLE pretends not to see

and moves behind a post.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLES - NIGHT

The wedding cake that was carried in earlier has now been

attacked from all sides, but the miniature bride and groom

are still standing in the middle. Unnoticed by each other

SAL'S MOTHER and ANGELA'S MOTHER eye the little figures. Both

women are in rather teary condition and begin moving toward

the cake. Suddenly, as the CROWD shifts, they encounter each

other face to face. Smiles are exchanged -- strained smiles,

which get stretched and stretched and stretched. Then, in

unison, they desert the smiling and remove their respective

offspring from the cake. SAL'S MOTHER looks down at her sugar

coated groom and ANGELA'S MOTHER looks down at her sugar

coated bride. Then they eye each other, burst into tears and

throw themselves in each other's arms, moaning and sobbing.

INT. V.F.W. POST - COAT ROOM - NIGHT

Another COUPLE tries to enter the rack. It is pretty full.

They finally find an empty place and squeeze in.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

NICK comes off the floor with LINDA and throws an arm around

MERLE.

NICK takes off. LINDA sits down at a table and MERLE goes to

the cooler to get a Miller's. He gropes around in the tub,

finds one and pops the tab. Suddenly he notices that NICK has

crossed to the SAD-LOOKING GIRL by the wall. He has stopped

in front of her and is asking her something. The SAD-LOOKING

GIRL gives a blush, gets out of her chair and NICK takes her

in his arms and begins to dance. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL looks

transformed. She begins chattering and laughing.

MERLE crosses back to LINDA and gives her the beer. As he

pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and

nearly loses his balance. He is very drunk.

NICK swings by with the SAD-LOOKING GIRL and waves.

MERLE doesn't say anything for a moment. He seems to be

trying to contain a floodtide of emotion.

INT. V.F.W. POST - COATROOM - NIGHT

The rack is still jammed with COUPLES but the laughing and

giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing

and low moans.

What light there is comes from the colored glass ball

revolving above the dance floor, where the MUSIC is now

playing sweet and low.

The front door comes open and a U.S. Army SERGEANT steps into

the darkened hallway. The man wears his dress green uniform.

On his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are

brightly polished.

The SERGEANT gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance

floor.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLE AREA - NIGHT

The SERGEANT passes between groups of celebrating GUESTS,

plucks a beer from one of the coolers and sits down alone at

the end of one of the white trestle tables.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

ALBERT gives his Tarzan cry, suddenly picks his GIRL off her

feet and marches around holding her above his head.

INT. V.F.W. POST DANCE FLOOR - ANOTHER LOCATION - NIGHT

VINCE and JOHN are standing together. VINCE is going bananas

because his girl, MARSHA, is dancing too close to FRED.

VINCE marches up and taps FRED on the shoulder. FRED releases

MARSHA. MARSHA waits, one hand on her hip, while the two of

them exchange words. VINCE turns MARSHA, points to her ass.

FRED turns MARSHA, pints to the small of her back. VINCE is

hopping up and down now. So is FRED. MARSHA, who is getting

bored, points to the door. VINCE and FRED bang out. As soon

as they have gone MARSHA is taken by someone else who puts

his hand right back where FRED had it.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLES - NIGHT

NICK, SAL and MERLE are standing together, looking at the

SERGEANT.

MERLE gestures with his head. NICK and SAL cross with him to

the SERGEANT.

The SERGEANT looks at them and delivers a big, blank smile.

The SERGEANT keeps smiling.

MERLE nods.

MERLE looks at NICK. NICK looks at SAL. They all begin

scratching their heads, trying not to laugh.

They turn away and then, when they are out of earshot, they

all break up, howling.

INT. V.F.W. POST - NIGHT

The GUESTS have formed in a long double line which extends

from the dance floor right out into the street. Everyone is

pretty drunk and they are all armed with streamers and bags

of rice. As SAL and ANGELA appear from out of a back room

there is a great rowdy CHEER. The MUSICIANS strike up a

MARCH. Followed by the MUSICIANS, showered with streamers,

rice, advice and encouragement, SAL and ANGELA walk the

gauntlet toward the street, where a glossy, bright red

Pontiac with headers and straight pipes is being revved in a

series of ear-splitting crescendos.

EXT. V.F.W. POST - STREET - NIGHT

JOHN, ALBERT, MERLE and VINCENT are standing by the door.

Their tuxedos are stained and torn. Their carnations are

squashed and their clip-on bow ties are either missing

entirely or dangling from the open collars of their shirts.

VINCE looks the worst, with a black eye and half his pant leg

torn away, and they are all guzzling beer.

EXT. V.F.W. POST - PARKED PONTIAC - NIGHT

SAL and ANGELA emerge to more CHEERS and a shower of

streamers and rice. ANGELA is helped into the Pontiac on the

right. NICK throws an arm around SAL and walks him around to

the driver's seat.

NICK gives SAL a hug. SAL gets in the car.

INT. PONTIAC - NIGHT

SAL looks over at ANGELA.

ANGELA nods. SAL puts the car into gear and starts slowly

off. Fists pound on the car. Rice and streamers shower down.

Suddenly, through the front windshield, MERLE appears, stark

naked, running in front of the car with colored paper

streamers floating out from his upraised right hand. For a

split second SAL cannot believe what he is seeing. He throws

a look at ANGELA. ANGELA covers her mouth in amazement and

then quickly shifts the hand to cover her eyes.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

MERLE weaves down the street in front of the growling red

Pontiac. MERLE is not just running. He is leaping and

bounding, as if released from gravity and entered into a

realm of pure ethereal space.

NICK, ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN pound down the street behind the

Pontiac, ALBERT carrying MERLE's clothes.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The road forks, one road going high to a parking area, the

other descending to the valley below. MERLE swerves up the

incline toward the parking area, while the Pontiac goes

straight and disappears down the hill.

ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN stagger to a stop, panting helplessly.

NICK grabs MERLE's clothes from ALBERT and takes off up the

hill.

EXT. HILLSIDE PARKING AREA - NIGHT

MERLE stands motionless, looking out across the valley as

NICK approaches. The night is brilliantly clear and the fires

from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow.

NICK comes to a stop a few feet away.

MERLE turns. His face has a strange, distant look, and he

gives NICK an almost feral grin.

NICK moves up beside him. He doesn't know what to say.

MERLE lets out his breath. It is as if some great weight had

been pressing on him.

EXT. THRUWAY - NIGHT

NICK'S battered old shark-finned Cadillac comes screaming

past.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN, all of them still in

tuxedos, are jammed in the car between knapsacks, sleeping

bags, six packs of beer and deer rifles.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

Tale Cadillac comes blasting by...

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

NICK is hunched over the wheel, his eyes gone completely

glassy. MERLE and VINCE are on the nod, while ALBERT and

JOHN, both half asleep, are having a lead-voiced

conversation.

There is a long pause. They both struggle to keep their eyes

open.

INT. CADILLAC NIGHT

NICK'S head is sunk below the upper rim of the steering

wheel. One eye is entirely shut and the open one seems close

to death. Suddenly his head snaps up. He slams his foot down

on the brake and the Cadillac fishtails, rubber screaming, to

a jolting stop.

EVERYONE in the car comes awake ten bleary eyes staring out

through the windshield.

There are deer in the road, fifteen or twenty of them

standing in the headlights.

EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

VINCE, ALBERT, NICK and JOHN pile out with their rifles.

VINCE immediately slips and falls down.

VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush around to the trunk. ALBERT

begins pounding on it.

Pushing and shoving each other, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush

around to the side of the car. As they pass along the

embankment at the side of the road there is a soft sound,

like a sigh, and all three of them simultaneously vanish.

NICK, who has been watching, stares at the place where his

three friends disappeared. He takes a few steps forward,

realizes what has happened and doubles up in the middle of

the road, helpless with laughter.

NICK makes a gesture, a downward pointing of his finger.

VINCE crosses to the side of the road.

EXT. RAVINE - NIGHT

The slope is a good 45 plus. At the bottom, barely visible,

three tiny figures flop in the snow.

EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

VINCE looks down at the three hunters with an expression of

absolute disgust. He looks at NICK -- flat on his back,

pounding his feet, howling -- and then he looks at the deer.

The deer are still watching. If anything they have edged

closer and their massed expression of polite curiosity throws

VINCE into a blind rage.

VINCE, whose rifle is fully loaded, slams a shell into the

chamber and lets off a barrage of shots above the deer.

EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAWN

The sky is cold -- first light -- with low, wind-driven

clouds. CAMERA TILTS DOWN and we see NICK's Cadillac coming

up a narrow road flanked by precipitous, heavily forested

ridges on both sides.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN

The Cadillac seems minuscule, overwhelmed by the massive,

black slopes looming up from the road.

INT. CADILLAC - DAWN

Everyone is eating cold hot dogs, ripping them out of a half

dozen plastic packages, dipping them in a jar of mustard and

stuffing them down. Hot dog juice has dripped over

everything, potato chips are littered everywhere and both

beer and milk are being passed around.

ALBERT tears off the wrapper, dips it in the mustard and

glomps it down.

NICK pulls to a stop on the shoulder.

EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN

The sky is just turning grey. A cold wind is blowing, moaning

in the trees and swirling a fine haze of snow across the open

roadway. The guys all pile out in their wrecked tuxedos.

NICK, MERLE and JOHN have the trunk open and are taking stuff

out. MERLE strips down where he stands and begins putting on

his hunting clothes. ALBERT and VINCE grab their things and

follow the example of NICK and JOHN, who are changing on the

corner of the seats.

MERLE, who is crouched down studying the hillside, looks

over.

VINCE begins plunging around.

VINCE tears into another pile of equipment, comes up with

nothing and steps out of the car.

EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN - LATER

Shots are ringing out in the hills. NICK, ALBERT and JOHN

stand by the roadside while VINCE and MERLE glare at each

other. VINCE is still in his tuxedo pants, is still wearing

his dress shoes and is draped in a gigantic red goose down

vest that could only have come from ALBERT. MERLE's knapsack

lies on the ground in front of him and we can see that it

contains a pair of Vibram-soled mountain boots.

JOHN throws up his hands in a comical way.

MERLE -- who has remained completely calm throughout VINCE's

tirade -- pumps a shell in the chamber of his rifle. JOHN

freezes in his tracks and stares at him, his face gone white.

JOHN looks at ALBERT, who is right behind him, and they both

back away. VINCE, who is standing directly opposite MERLE,

begins to tremble. His mouth comes open, closes and comes

open again. Urine begins trickling out from the bottom of his

pants leg, staining the snow. Suddenly, NICK steps forward.

He looks at MERLE, crosses to the knapsack, takes out the

boots, walks over to VINCE and throws them on the road.

INT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

The place is about nine-by-twelve. The floor is rotted out,

boards are missing from the walls and the entire structure is

canted to the right. Hanging from the roof peak is a hissing

Coleman lantern which sways in the wind.

VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are sacked out, sound asleep. Beer

cans -- some old, some new -- litter the floor. Wet clothes,

most of them bloody, hang from tie-boards and nails. Strung

up on the end wall are two deer carcasses, one of them with a

knife jammed in it where steaks have been cut out.

Snow is blowing in -- dry, crystal bright. It swirls over

everything and settles on the sleeping figures on the floor.

CAMERA DISCOVERS MERLE AND NICK. They are both in sleeping

bags, lying on rusted bedsprings at either side of the broken

door. The wind gusts and moans. The cabin shudders and then

there is a sudden lull.

EXT. THRUWAY PITTSBURGH OFF-RAMP - TWILIGHT

Traffic is heavy, an unending flow of cars, a river of

headlights suspended on a curved concrete trestle which seems

to float in thin air. Behind is the mill, belching steam and

ablaze with fire.

NICK's Cadillac appears, horn blaring, weaving through the

traffic. The car sits low. Trussed to the hood, to the roof,

to the trunk, are the carcasses of five deer. Rope-ends

flutter and bang in the wind. The car shudders and thuds.

Inside, grinning maniacally, NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and

JOHN are all shouting and guzzling beer.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TWILIGHT

The Caddy appears, swerving onto Columbine with tires

screaming and NICK still leaning on the horn. The guys are

all hanging out the windows, shouting to FRIENDS, whistling

at GIRLS and banging a triumphant tatoo on the doors.

As the car ascends the grade the mill appears behind it,

seeming to loom upward under the pink-streaked twilight sky.

CAMERA HOLDS AS THE CAR COMES TOWARD IT. The headlights blaze

white, like huge hungry stars, and the eyes of the dead deer

on the fenders glitter gold and green and red.

ALBERT leans out the window and gives his Tarzan call... IT

SEEMS TO ECHO, AS IF COMING FROM FAR AWAY,

EXT. CLOSE-UP OF JUNGLE LEAF - DAY

The leaf is being eaten by an exotic-looking insect. After

each bite, the insect lifts its head, produces an exceedingly

thoughtful expression, and chews.

WE HEAR THE BUZZ AND CREAK OF OTHER INSECTS, THEN A DULL,

FLUTTERING DRONE. THE DRONE GROWS LOUDER...

EXT. HELICOPTER SQUADRON - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY

There are twenty of them, coming fast and low, just over the

tops of the trees. Sunlight gleams on their paint and

murderous-looking rockets are packed to their bellies in fat

clusters, like eggs.

Suddenly, in unison, they fire the rockets.

EXT. RANGE OF LOW HILLS - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY

As the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot

upward, lost to sight. There is an eerie silence and then the

hillside explodes, vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two

miles wide.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

A platoon of AMERICANS have been ambushed on the road. The

bodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, guts

spilled in the dirt. No one moves and there is absolute

silence except for the low buzz of flies.

A V.C. LIEUTENANT steps into sight. He gives a brusque

command and V.C. SOLDIERS step out of the jungle. The

LIEUTENANT bayonets a few of the fallen U.S. SOLDIERS --

idly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he

rubs his finger in the Americans' blood. The V.C. SOLDIERS

laugh, spear a few AMERICANS themselves and repeat the joke.

There is a slight sound. The V.C. LIEUTENANT spins and gives

a low command. Fifty feet away there are three grass huts.

He signals his SOLDIERS to spread out and then he starts

toward them.

INT. GRASS HUT - DAY

South Vietnamese VILLAGERS -- women, children, and a few old

men -- sit huddled in the semi-darkness. The WOMEN hold their

hands over their BABIES' mouths. Flies buzz and there is a

look of stark terror in their faces.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

One of the fallen AMERICANS moves. CAMERA CLOSES ON THE

SOLDIER. His face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a

gash in his temple. The face is unshaven, frighteningly

gaunt, but we recognize that it is MERLE.

A WOMAN'S SCREAM comes from the direction of the huts. A shot

rings out. MERLE pulls himself to his hands and knees and

stands there, on all fours, like a dog.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY

The V.C. roust the VILLAGERS from their huts, smashing them

in the back with rifle butts. One of the SOLDIERS emerges

from a hut carrying two small BABIES upside-down by their

feet. One of the WOMEN cries out. The SOLDIER gives her a

kick, swings one of her BABIES in the air and lets it go. The

BABY turns over and over against the blue sky. As the BABY

comes down ANOTHER SOLDIER catches it through the neck on the

end of his bayonet.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

MERLE strips a B.A.R. from one of his dead companions, slams

a fresh clip in it, jams two extras in his pants and starts

for the grass huts. His movements are slow, almost dreamlike,

and his face is expressionless, like someone risen from the

dead.

EXT. GRASS HUTS DAY

The VILLAGERS -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in

a line. As the SOLDIERS look on the V.C. LIEUTENANT walks up

and down trying to extract information. The SPEARED BABY lies

in the dust between the two groups. The SECOND BABY tries to

play with it. The SOLDIER who threw the dead baby in the air

squats nearby and yawns.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

MERLE approaches between the huts. He takes a quick look

around the corner, finds the V.C. all bunched in a neat

package and draws back.

CAMERA CLOSES ON MERLE'S EYES. They are cold, dreaming

things, glittering blankly.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY

MERLE spins out with the B.A.R. on full automatic. The V.C.

SOLDIERS go down screaming, arms and necks thrown back, in a

thin mist of spraying blood.

ABOVE THE CHATTER OF MERLE'S B.A.R. WE HEAR A GROWING ROAR.

EXT. APPROACHING AMERICAN HELICOPTERS - DAY

There are five of them, coming in low under the tops of

nearby trees.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - THE VILLAGERS - DAY

The VILLAGERS stand motionless, staring at the helicopters

and frozen with terror. They turn. They start to run. And

then they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm.

EXT. GRASS HUTS AFTER NAPALM ATTACK - DAY

MERLE stands alone with his B.A.R. surrounded by clouds of

billowing black smoke. There is no sound but the rush of

heated air and the faint crackle of flames. MERLE'S clothes

are burning. Flames are licking up his trouser legs and a

blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet.

In front of MERLE the SOLDIERS and the VILLAGERS lie in two

charred heaps. The BABIES lie between them. Both are

motionless now, like two roasted stones.

An AMERICAN LIEUTENANT steps out from behind one of the

burning huts. MERLE and the LIEUTENANT spin on each other and

then the LIEUTENANT lowers his carbine.

MORE AMERICANS appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the

trees in a long line. Among them are NICK and SAL.

The LIEUTENANT heads down the line. NICK stares at MERLE.

MERLE turns and looks at NICK. There is no recognition. He

seems to be looking right through him.

SAL comes up behind NICK.

A shot rings out. The LIEUTENANT goes down and suddenly the

whole line of AMERICANS is caught in a murderous cross-fire.

Grenades rain out of the trees. MERLE, NICK and SAL dive for

cover.

Out of the smoke V.C. SOLDIERS begin to appear, more and more

of them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

We are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug

and fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by

stones. The ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pits

are filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo

gratings. In each of the pits are about a half-dozen men --

SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their hands grip the gratings

and their eyes are hollow. Other than an occasional groan

there is only the sound of the falling rain.

A V.C. SOLDIER trudges out of the jungle. As he reaches the

pits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up and

down on the bamboo gratings. The hands disappear. As soon as

one comes back, the SOLDIER stomps on it, shrieking with

laughter. Then, almost as an afterthought, the SOLDIER pulls

down his pants and squats above the center grating.

CAMERA TILTS SLOWLY UPWARD. We see the clearing in its

totality. It is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and

contains only two structures. One is a large bamboo "tiger

cage" with a few leaves tied to its top. The other is a small

hut with a thatched roof. The walls of the hut are open and

we can see V.C. GUARDS moving about inside.

A cry comes from the hut. There is the THUD of a rifle butt

on flesh and the cry abruptly stops.

INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY

In the middle of the hut is an American kitchen table with a

rose-patterned plastic top. At opposite ends of the table are

two chairs. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONER sits in one of the

chairs. In the other chair, facing him, is MERLE.

The SOUTH VIETNAMESE has a welt on his head and one of the

half-dozen V.C. GUARDS in the hut is screaming at him. In the

middle of the table, between the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and MERLE,

is a single-action .45 caliber revolver with an American

eagle carved on its ivory grip.

MERLE sits quietly, waiting, but his eyes are working, taking

in every detail of the scene. The V.C. GUARD gives the SOUTH

VIETNAMESE a final cuff, takes up the revolver with a

dramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber.

Immediately the OTHER GUARDS begin placing bets. The GUARDS

are a ragged bunch -- wet, half-drunk on captured Budweiser,

and it takes some time to straighten things out.

MERLE looks off to his right:

INT. THATCHED HUT - REVERSE ANGLE - DAY

We see more SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN prisoners standing

against the wall. Most of them have been badly beaten and all

have their elbows tied behind their backs. In among them,

standing beside one another, are NICK and SAL. NICK looks

grey, like a skinny ghost. SAL is out of control, sobbing

quietly.

INT. THATCHED HUT - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAY

The betting is now completed. The V.C. in charge waves the

.45 around and calls for silence. Then, closing the cylinder

containing the single bullet, he points the revolver at the

ceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until the

revolver goes off with a ROAR. Bits of thatch flutter down

from the ceiling. The V.C. GUARDS shout enthusiastically and

grin.

MERLE sits motionless. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE across the table

from him begins shaking uncontrollably.

The V.C. in charge now reloads the revolver with one

cartridge, snaps the cylinder shut, puts the gun on the table

between MERLE and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and gives it a good

spin.

The revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing at

MERLE. MERLE stares at it for a long beat. Then he picks it

up, spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and

pulls the trigger. The hammer falls on an empty chamber with

a loud CLICK.

MERLE places the revolver back on the table and pushes it

toward the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE begins to

tremble again. Fumbling horribly he finally manages to get

the gun in his hand. He spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer

and puts the gun to his temple. The gun weaves around.

The SOUTH VIETNAMESE closes his eyes and pulls the trigger.

There is a loud CLICK.

MERLE takes the revolver again. He spins it, cocks it -- all

in one smooth motion -- puts it to his temple and pulls the

trigger. There is another CLICK.

MERLE pushes the gun back across the table. This time the

SOUTH VIETNAMESE takes it up with sudden confidence. He spins

the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls on

the trigger.

THERE IS A ROAR. THE PISTOL IS FLYING IN THE AIR AND THEN THE

MAN'S HEAD, HALF-EXPLODED, CRASHES OVER ONTO THE KITCHEN

TABLE.

MERLE doesn't even blink. The GUARDS begin hooting and

laughing, wiping pieces of brain from their clothes, and

MERLE watches them, watches every gesture, every movement...

like a cat.

EXT. THATCHED HUT - LATER DAY

A pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain. The

bodies are both SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their heads

are all variously blown to pieces and SEVERAL HUGE RATS are

already feeding on them.

INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY

NICK is at the table now, opposite a SOUTH VIETNAMESE. He

holds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder. His face is

twitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are

holding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it for

a long time.

NICK raises the pistol to his temple, CLICKS OUT. The GUARDS

murmur. NICK pushes the pistol across the table.

INT. THATCHED HUT - PRISONER END - DAY

There are no Americans left to play except SAL. The sobbing

has stopped but SAL is shaking and trembling and his eyes

wander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose.

MERLE, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk to

SAL. As he does so we hear the CLICKS coming from across the

room and the excited MURMURS of the GUARDS as their betting

choice survives another round.

There is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'S

eyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDS

open a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him and

the GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor.

The GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and drags

him of f to the table.

INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY

SAL is thrown in the chair. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE is placed

opposite him. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE is a kid, even younger

than SAL, and he is trembling with terror.

SAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle

comes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH

VIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his

eyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and then

SAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTH

VIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around,

cocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and the

SOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE IS

TAKING HIS FAITH STRAIGHT OUT OF SAL'S EYES AND NOW SAL GIVES

HIM ANOTHER ENCOURAGING NOD.

The SOUTH VIETNAMESE BOY squeezes the trigger. THERE IS AN

EXPLOSION AND HIS HEAD DISINTEGRATES WITH A ROAR.

SAL sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed

in an expression of terrible puzzlement. Then his face begins

to move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to

discover a frown. SAL looks around. He looks back again at

the place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry.

INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - FOLLOWING DAY

A half-dozen SOUTH VIETNAMESE sit huddled together in the

muck on the uphill side. A seventh lies sprawled on his back,

DEAD. The rain pours through the few leaves placed on the

roof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the

floor.

On the downhill side are SAL, NICK and MERLE. SAL is in a

fetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back

and forth. His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an

expression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at

the table blow himself away. Beside SAL is NICK. NICK sits

slumped against the bamboo. One knee is raised and he is

picking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn

at the knee.

MERLE IS STANDING, GRIPPING THE BAMBOO WALLS OF THE CAGE AND

LOOKING OUT AT THE "PITS".

EXT. THE PITS - MERLE'S POV - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

The pits are about twenty feet away. Running mud and water

gurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on the

downhill side. There are fewer hands than the day before, far

fewer. The nearest pit only has one pair and as MERLE watches

he sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip.

SUDDENLY ONE OF THE HANDS SLIPS AWAY. THE HAND COMES BACK FOR

A MOMENT, THEN BOTH HANDS DISAPPEAR.

INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE turns away from the "pits". He looks down at SAL, then

he looks at NICK. His expression is one of exasperation, as

if he had been having a long argument.

A shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE

whip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn.

Through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the V.C. GUARDS

coming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all

drinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the

pearl-handled revolver.

NICK looks at MERLE. The sight has totally unnerved him.

NICK stares at MERLE. Rain is pouring off them in rivulets

and the VOICES of the approaching GUARDS are getting louder.

The GUARDS begin screaming orders from outside the cage and

ONE OF THEM lets off a blast of automatic rifle fire which

shreds the bamboo roof just above the PRISONERS' heads. NICK

and MERLE grab SAL and drag him to the door.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

As the PRISONERS emerge from the "tiger cage" the GUARDS

smash them with their rifle butts, screaming orders. In the

melee SAL is separated from NICK and MERLE, both of whom are

knocked to the ground by furious blows. When they get to

their feet they see that SAL is wandering off alone in the

direction of the "pits". One of the GUARDS spots SAL and

clubs him down.

SAL gets up and begins wandering off again. The GUARD clubs

him down again, turns to the GUARD IN CHARGE and begins

complaining. The GUARD IN CHARGE dispatches a SECOND GUARD to

help the FIRST and the TWO GUARDS open the bamboo grating on

one of the "pits".

MERLE turns to NICK, who is standing beside him.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - THE "PITS" - DAY

SAL has absolutely no comprehension of what is about to

happen to him. His eyes are dreamy, far away, as if he had

mentally transported himself to some distant place. There are

great gashes in his head from the blows he has received and

as he stands waiting in the pouring rain he looks exactly

like a very small child who has experienced some terrible

confusion.

Suddenly the GUARD standing beside SAL wrenches him around.

We see the pit now, CLOSE UP. There are four bloated CORPSES

floating in the muck.

We SAL'S FACE, CLOSE UP. He gives a CRY and tries to turn

away.

We see the GUARDS pick SAL up, SCREAMING. We see the SPLASH

as SAL hits the water and then we see him surface between the

bloated CORPSES, STILL SCREAMING, paddling desperately and

trying to find something solid to hod him up.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - WAITING PRISONERS - DAY

NICK stands motionless, stunned, listening to SAL'S SCREAMS.

MERLE has his attention focused on the GUARD IN CHARGE and

when he glances in their direction MERLE slugs NICK in the

stomach and begins beating him furiously to the ground. NICK

struggles to his feet. MERLE attacks him again and now, as

the GUARD IN CHARGE comes over to see what's going on, MERLE

begins hopping up and down, pointing at NICK, pointing at the

revolver in the GUARD'S hand and screaming.

The GUARDS look at each other, interested.

INT. THATCHED HUT - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE and NICK sit facing one another across the rose

patterned kitchen table. The GUARDS are all grinning and even

the SOUTH VIETNAMESE are watching with grim fascination. NICK

has the revolver. He is trembling visibly. Already MERLE has

managed to draw the GUARDS in closer and as NICK spins the

cylinder and cocks the hammer MERLE jumps up and begins

pounding on the table.

NICK almost loses what little control is left and his hand

begins shaking violently.

Side bets begin changing hands.

NICK puts the revolver against his temple and pulls the

trigger. There is a dull CLICK.

NICK puts the revolver back on the table. His hand is shaking

so badly it falls with a clunk. MERLE grabs it, spins it,

sticks it to his temple and CLICKS OUT, talking all the time:

MERLE hops up and down, laughing maniacally.

The GUARD IN CHARGE looks at his COMPANIONS. They all begin

shouting for him to go ahead. The GUARD IN CHARGE purses his

lips, as if imitating a general coming to a decision, and

then nods his assent. The GUARDS all howl. MERLE joins right

in.

The GUARD IN CHARGE takes the revolver, opens the cylinder

and begins sticking in two more cartridges.

MERLE hops up and down again, then screams at NICK, jabbing

his finger at him, as if in fury.

The GUARD IN CHARGE places the revolver on the table, spins

it.

The muzzle stops pointing at MERLE. MERLE scowls, looks over

at the GUARD IN CHARGE. The GUARD IN CHARGE has lifted the

barrel of his AK 47 and is watching him with caution. The

OTHER GUARDS, who are totally caught up in the game, are

yelling and shouting.

MERLE picks up the revolver, spins the cylinder, cocks it...

MERLE starts it again. The GUARDS who are bett ing on him

JOIN IN:

MERLE takes a glance at the GUARD IN CHARGE again. The GUARD

IN CHARGE is still eyeing him with caution.

MERLE places the revolver to his temple... and CLICKS into an

empty chamber.

He pushes the gun across to NICK. Then he stabs his finger at

him, screaming again, as if in a fit of rage.

NICK looks down at the revolver and picks it up. He stares at

MERLE for a moment. Then he spins the cylinder, cocks the

hammer, Puts it to his head... and CLICKS into an empty

chamber.

The GUARDS let out expressions of disbelief. Those betting on

NICK begin taunting those betting on MERLE.

MERLE sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated,

his brow furrowed in a mighty frown.

NICK pushes the revolver across the table. His face is

twitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if

throwing back a challenge.

MERLE stares at the revolver -- stares at it with an

expression of utter gloom. Then he reaches out, takes the

revolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no

longer possessed the strength to pick it up.

MERLE roams a glowering eve over the watching GUARDS, as if

suddenly discovering himself among traitors. Slowly, he

pushes himself to his feet. The gun is still on the table,

still in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his body

sag over it.

There is absolute silence now except for the drumming of the

rain. It is as if the war had disappeared, vanished. The

GUARDS stand motionless, hardly breathing, so captivated by

MERLE'S performance that they suddenly resemble little

children.

MERLE begins his chant again. His voice is low, very

dramatic, and the GUARD IN CHARGE joins right in.

MERLE snaps the revolver level in his hand and BLASTS the

GUARD IN CHARGE, hitting him full in the face. At the same

time NICK throws himself into the GUARD who is standing

behind him, spins and slams the GUARD'S AK 47 into his chin.

TWO MORE SHOTS BLAST OUT FROM MERLE'S .45 and we see TWO

GUARDS crash over the kitchen table. NICK now opens up with

AK 47, and as MERLE backs off beside him, also with an AK 47,

they GUN the remaining GUARDS to the floor.

It is over in an instant. The BODIES lie in a bloody, tangled

mess under a pathetic paper lantern. The rain drones on --

uninterrupted, undiminished, eternal...

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

Barely visible against the dripping foliage -- like a shadow

is a startled V.C. SOLDIER. The man takes a half-step

forward, unslings his rifle and OPENS FIRE.

INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY

The SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONERS are hit where they stand. NICK

spins, BADLY WOUNDED. MERLE throws himself on the floor and

lets go with the AK 47.

EXT. BAMBOO GROVE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE appears carrying NICK on his back. NICK is unconscious

and the effort that MERLE has expended to get him this far

can be measured in MERLE'S eves, which burn like dead coals.

As MERLE approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the

side of a steep hill, we suddenly see SAL, stumbling along

behind and attached to MERLE by a short rope.

MERLE comes to a stop, unshoulders NICK and lays him on the

ground. As MERLE stands looking at NICK, gasping for breath,

SAL hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo

with an expression of pure terror.

There is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible.

MERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across his

mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK.

For a moment there is nothing -- silence. The rain drones on

and we can hear NICK'S breath, which comes in short, shallow

rasps.

The sound comes again and suddenly a PLATOON OF V.C. SOLDIERS

appear, coming down through the trees. Their passage is

almost completely silent and they go by on both sides, moving

down the hill.

CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON MERLE'S FACE. His gums are bleeding

and his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in

his skull. His teeth are bared, his eyes are hollow and he

looks within a hair's breadth of being completely mad.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - NIGHT

A huge battle is taking place nearby. The earth trembles and

shakes and gigantic explosions intermittently light the sky.

MERLE staggers down a ravine with NICK, loses his footing and

slides to the bottom where he lies in the mud, motionless,

too tired to move.

SAL comes down behind. He is hunched over, like a gnome. The

rope which MERLE has tied around his neck drags in the mud

and his eyes are huge with terror.

SAL crouches down in the mud.

Another explosion lights the sky, this one much closer. In

the flash we see that a red American car is stranded in the

middle of the road. There is another explosion and another

flash. The car is dusty, spattered with mud, but otherwise it

appears miraculously unharmed.

NICK'S breath rattles in his throat. MERLE, who lies beside

NICK, holding him, has closed his eyes. SAL, who is the only

one who has seen the car, stares at it hard, and for a long

time, trying it out with one eye and then the other.

No answer.

Still no answer. SAL goes over to MERLE and shakes him.

Getting no response he crosses fearfully toward the

automobile. When he gets to within a foot of it, he reaches

out and touches it.

As the flashes continue to light up the sky, SAL peers at the

tires and begins kicking them.

SAL crosses to the window and looks in. There is no damage

whatsoever, the keys are dangling from the ignition. SAL

pulls open the door and climbs in. He pumps the accelerator,

hits the starter...

THERE IS A FLASH OF FIRE, THEN A HUGE EXPLOSION AND THE CAR

GOES UP IN A FIREBALL OF FLAME.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - BURNING CAR - NIGHT

MERLE has dragged SAL from the car and thrown him in the

ditch below NICK. SAL is horribly burned and MERLE kneels

over him -- out of breath, tears streaming from his cavernous

eyes -- howling with helpless rage.

MERLE looks down at SAL. SAL'S face in a mass of raw flesh

but his eyes look up at MERLE with lunatic, unwavering trust.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - FOLLOWING DAY

REFUGEES are streaming down the road in a desperate,

frightened human torrent. There is every imaginable means of

conveyance -- from bullock carts to motorbikes -- but the

vast majority, carrying their meager belongings, are fleeing

on foot. The burned-out car is still in the middle of the

road and the great human tide streams around it, as if it

were an island. In the distance comes the sound of machine

gun fire and mortars are coming in nearby. MEDVAC helicopters

clatter overhead with wounded strapped to baskets on the

skids. Now and then an ARMY CONVOY comes through, blasting

the REFUGEES into the ditch.

MERLE sits alone on the embankment by the side of the road.

NICK and SAL are gone and the area is littered with fresh

bandage packages and throw-away medical supplies. Suddenly a

jeep pulls up with a two-star GENERAL in it.

MERLE stares at the GENERAL -- blankly, without

comprehension. Finally, after a long moment, he gives a

slight shrug.

The GENERAL and the DRIVER get out and start up the

embankment toward MERLE.

The GENERAL looks up at MERLE. MERLE is holding the pearl

handled revolver and he cocks the hammer with an audible

click.

The GENERAL and the DRIVER turn tail, scramble back down the

embankment and pile in the jeep.

MERLE watches them go without expression. On the road below

the REFUGEES stream past -- by the hundreds, by the

thousands, by the tens of thousands. For a long moment MERLE

watches, then he jams the gun in his pants and stands.

EXT. EVACUATION ROUTE - DAY

MERLE is walking with the fleeing REFUGEES. CAMERA PANS,

HOLDING ON MERLE as he grows smaller and smaller -- to a

speck in the vast human torrent.

INT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - SAIGON - DAY

The room is tiny, a cubicle furnished with a chair. NICK is

alone, standing at the window looking out. He wears ill

fitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for-the

pallor of his skin. Around his neck is a piece of plastic on

which is stapled a colored paper marker. Departing aircraft

thunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby

hydraulic mechanism.

EXT. LOADING RAMP (NICK'S POV) - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY

Black BODY BAGS are laid out in countless rows on the hot

concrete TWO PFC's are stacking them on pallets and MORE

PFC's, driving hydraulic LIFTERS, are loading the pallets

into the cavernous hold of a huge JET TRANSPORT.

INT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY

NICK turns away from the window and sits down in the chair.

Suddenly the door bursts open and a harassed DOCTOR comes in.

NICK shakes his head.

NICK nods.

The DOCTOR looks at the paper marker on NICK's neck.

NICK nods.

NICK nods. The DOCTOR directs a finger at him.

The DOCTOR slams back out the door. Another jet thunders

overhead. The hydraulic LIFTERS on the loading ramp shriek

and whine...

NICK reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers

down at it from the corner of his eye. It seems to remind him

of something and he takes out his wallet. In his wallet is a

PHOTOGRAPH of LINDA. NICK peers at the photograph intently,

then closes his wallet and puts it away.

INT. U.S. ARMY TELEPHONE CENTER - SAIGON - DAY

Banks of telephones line the wall. Stretching out from the

telephones are long, ragged lines of SERVICEMEN waiting to

call home. The room is huge, full of echoes. Re-enlistment

posters are plastered everywhere and CANNED LATIN MUSIC is

playing.

NICK stands in one of the lines with only one person in front

of him. He looks anxious. He takes out his wallet again,

peers intently at LINDA'S PHOTOGRAPH, then puts it back.

NICK takes a half-step forward -- staring at the telephone --

and then he stops, frozen with fear.

CAMERA HOLDS ON NICK as he turns out of the line and heads

for the exit under a long row of CLOCKS.

EXT. BUSY STREET - SAIGON - DAY

NICK comes along the sidewalk in a CROWD OF PEDESTRIANS. He

is drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting

along for hours. As he comes to a stop, staring at a SOUTH

VIETNAMESE who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket

for a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the

gutter. Suddenly, across the street, something catches his

eye.

NICK throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even

looking.

Vehicles swerve and screech to a stop. NICK dodges between

them, gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand

on the back of a passing SOLDIER. The SOLDIER turns. It is

not SAL at all and the resemblance is not even close.

The SOLDIER continues on his way. The CROWD streams on, a sea

of bobbing, brilliant color. NICK gropes in his pocket and

produces another pint bottle. He unscrews the cap and downs a

long swallow.

INT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT

The place is very dark. LOUD MUSIC is playing. Partially-clad

BAR GIRLS are dancing with the CUSTOMERS, while above, on a

kind of trapeze, NAKED GIRLS are performing obscene

contortions.

NICK sits at one of the tables. By now he is very drunk and a

BAR GIRL is giving him her undivided attention.

NICK nods. He looks as if he might be about to cry.

NICK nods.

INT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT

The BAR GIRL comes around the corner with NICK, guiding him

to a flight of narrow stairs. She has one hand around his

waist and the other down the front of his pants.

Suddenly NICK draws to a stop, staring at a small window at

the end of the corridor. He tears himself loose from the BAR

GIRL and pushes up against the glass.

EXT. NARROW STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

Seated on the sidewalk against the wall of the opposite

building is an OLD MAN surrounded by a collection of white

ceramic elephants. A truck roars by in front of him.

Motorcycles sputter past and PEDESTRIANS hurry in both

directions. The OLD MAN sits motionless, like the guardian of

some timeless, silent kingdom.

INT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT

NICK spins away from the window.

The BAR GIRL stares at him.

NICK turns and charges back down the corridor with the BAR

GIRL hot on his tail.

EXT. NARROW STREET - NIGHT

NICK paces up and down in front of the OLD MAN and his

ceramic elephants.

The STREET URCHINS come running. They are ragged,

malnourished, ranging in age from about six to nine. They are

covered with sores. One of them ~as lost an eye and another

has lost a hand.

NICK dives into a nearby bar.

INT. NEARBY BAR - NIGHT

The place is as dark as the one before. MUSIC BLASTS from a

jukebox and two vaseline-covered GIRLS are dancing. As NICK

crosses to the bar to get change there is a WHISTLING SCREAM

and then the FRONT WALL OF THE BUILDING DISINTEGRATES IN A

ROAR OF NOISE.

NICK pulls himself out of the debris. There is absolute

silence in the WRECKED BAR but rockets are coming in all over

the city and the EXPLOSIONS rumble and roar.

EXT. NARROW STREET AFTER ROCKET EXPLOSION - NIGHT

A nearby building is burning fiercely. The street is deserted

except for the sprawled CORPSES of the STREET URCHINS which

lie this way and that, like broken dolls.

NICK walks out past the CORPSES. The street is littered with

fragments of broken ceramic -- gleaming, pure white, like

chunks of snow.

EXT. DESERTED STREET - SAIGON - NIGHT

The sky is alight with fires. Now and then HUGE EXPLOSIONS

rock the night and SIRENS wail.

A lone figure appears, walking down the middle of the street.

As the figure approaches we see that it is NICK.

NICK swallows, as if to force back some overwhelming emotion.

Then, squatting down under a lamp post, he begins again.

NICK takes out his wallet, opens it hurriedly to the

PHOTOGRAPH OF LINDA and peers at it with a kind of ferocious

determination, as if this link were the last, as if by

staring at it hard he could make it hold.

There is the sharp report of a pistol SHOT and then, as NICK

spins, staring at a shuttered building, there is the

unmistakable sound of APPLAUSE.

NICK stares at the building for a long moment, then he

crosses toward it.

EXT. YARD BEHIND BUILDING - SAIGON - NIGHT

A tiny light glows inside a paper lantern. Lying on the

around are three CORPSES, all of them Asian, all of them

expensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown

off. As NICK stands looking at them a door comes open on the

back of the building,and TWO BURLY MEN bring out another

corpse. The body is that of a young American. Like the Asians

he is expensively dressed and he is dead from a bullet in the

right temple.

NICK turns. A MAN is standing in the shadows of a small grape

arbor, eyeing him with a look of cold amusement. The MAN'S

accent is French. Beside him, on a small white table, is a

bottle of champagne and several glasses.

NICK stares at the MAN, nods.

NICK shakes his head.

The MAN makes a clicking sound, three times, as if firing a

pistol. NICK nods.

There is another SHOT from inside and another round of

APPLAUSE.

NICK nods.

ARMAND refills NICK's glass. NICK looks at it. The glass is

as thin as paper and the sparkling bubbles dance and hiss.

NICK lifts the glass and empties in one swallow.

ARMAND disappears in the darkness. Then his VOICE comes

again.

ARMAND moves around the side of the building and the sound of

his FOOTSTEPS fades away. The TWO BURLY MEN come lurching

with another CORPSE. Laughter comes from inside the building

and there is a glimpse of AN ELEGANTLY DRESSED WOMAN seated

at a cafe table. The BURLY MEN return to the door and shut it

tight. In the distance the sky goes up in a huge flash of

fire and then the sound of the EXPLOSION rolls across the

city like a great dead wind.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - WINTER - DUSK

The trailer is all decked out with bunting and stuck, like a

plum cake, with tiny American flags. Stretching from the

trailer to the side of a house across the street is a huge,

hand-lettered banner which says "WELCOME HOME NICK!" and it

whips and it snaps in the cold winter wind.

NICK's battered old shark-finned Cadillac is in the yard.

Alongside it are a bunch of newer cars and PEOPLE are coming

from all directions, spilling in and out of the trailer and

congregating in excited, foot-stomping, half-frozen groups.

EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS - COLUMBINE AREA - DUSK

We see the OLD PRIEST on his way from the church. We see the

OLDER WOMEN, wrapped in shawls and carrying cakes and

cookies, trudging up the hill. We see ALBERT, JOHN and a

bunch of STEELWORKERS, all of them half-bombed, dragging two

cases of beer on a child's sled. We see LINDA peering out the

trailer window, pale and anxious-looking. We see VINCE, who

is unofficial lookout, jumping up and down at the approach of

every car and screaming, "This is it! This is Nick!" and

then, when it isn't, saying, "Not yet! Just hold your water,

I'll tell you when!"

And we see an empty street into which SIX VETS from the VFW

Post come tottering. The VETS are all in their old uniforms.

While three of them attempt to make MUSIC on a BASS DRUM, a

FIFE and an old Army BUGLE, the other three attempt to sing.

INT. TAXICAB - DUSK

NICK sits hunched forward in the back seat surrounded by

unwrapped cartons containing electric appliances he has

bought for LINDA. NICK looks nervous, VERY NERVOUS.

Suddenly, as the cab comes over the crest of a hill, the

trailer looms into sight, straight ahead, with VINCE hopping

up and down in the snow and the OLD VETS all marking time

under the flapping banner.

NICK stares at the approaching trailer.

NICK throws himself down on the floor.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK

LINDA is outside, standing with VINCE and ALBERT.

The TAXICAB comes thudding by. LINDA, VINCE and ALBERT all

watch as it disappears over a rise.

LINDA gives a thin smile.

LINDA nods.

EXT. MOTEL - DUSK

A huge neon sign stands against the grey sky, buzzing

angrily, as if it were full of bees.

The TAXI DRIVER comes out of one of the units, gets back in

his cab and pulls away.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK

NICK stands in the doorway where the driver has left him. His

duffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled

along the wall by his feet. His head is thrown back and he is

draining a bottle of whiskey, gulping it down in great raw

swallows. .

NICK lowers the bottle, catches his breath and goes at it

again. This time, as he lowers the bottle, the stark panic is

gone, but there is still fear -- blind, nameless fear, like

that of an animal run to the ground.

NICK crosses to the window, grips the frame with both hands

and looks out.

EXT. THE STEEL MILL FROM THE MOTEL (NICK'S POV) - DUSK

The five great stacks trail ribbons of black smoke across the

pale winter sky, Steam billows upward in huge, silver-edged

clouds and there is the flash and gleam of fire.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK

NICK turns back to the room. He stares at it blankly --

stares at the bed, stares at the bureau, stares at the chair,

then he picks up the bottle, closes his eyes and begins

gulping down whiskey -- gulping it hard, fast, as hard and

fast as he can.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NEW ANGLE - DAWN

The banner stretching to the house across the street has been

whipped to shreds by the wind. In the yard, parked beside

NICK's black Cadillac, is another car of about the same

vintage. There is a case of beer on its roof, the windows are

entirely frosted over and the engine is running. After a

moment TWO STEELWORKERS come down the street and knock on the

trailer door. TWO OLDER WOMEN emerge, putting on their coats,

and then LINDA comes to the door and tells the STEELWORKERS

she has no news. The STEELWORKERS and the OLDER WOMEN start

off, but now one of the WOMEN points to the frosted up car.

The STEELWORKERS go back, pound on the roof of the frosted up

car, pull open a few doors and go on their way. First thing

out is a GIRL. Next thing out is a SECOND GIRL. Their dresses

are rumpled and half-undone. Neither one has a coat and the

SECOND GIRL is missing a shoe. The GIRLS both plunge back

inside the car, where howling and cursing can now be heard.

The GIRLS both retrieve their coats. The SECOND GIRL gets her

missing shoe, plus a bra and a pair of panties.

She returns the panties to the FIRST GIRL, puts on her shoe

and they both take off at a fast trot. As the two GIRLS leave

there is a cascade of empty beer cans and ALBERT, VINCE and

JOHN all stagger out -- bleary-eyed, hung-over, half

undressed and freezing. LINDA comes out of the trailer with

coffee, but just as she emerges the whistle at the mill goes

off. ALBERT and VINCE begin yelling at each other, yelling at

JOHN and yelling at LINDA. Then they throw themselves back in

the car and start off. The case of beer on the roof crashes

to the street. They stop, pile out, pick up the cans, heave

them in the back seat and take off again.

JOHN says something to LINDA and goes on his way.

LINDA stands in the yard, alone, with the three cups of

coffee.

EXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN

NICK stands half-way down a rickety wooden stairway,

watching.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAWN

LINDA turns and goes back inside the trailer.

EXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN

NICK swallows and starts down the stairway toward the

trailer. He hesitates, pulls the bottle from his pocket,

drains the last of it and tucks it under the stairs.

Straightening up, he claws at his hair, trying to comb it

with his fingers. Then he starts down again.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAWN

Cakes, cookies, six-packs of beer and bottles of wine cover

almost every inch of available space. LINDA sits on the

little settee, wedged between two cases of Coca-Cola and

hunched over a white sweater which she is attempting, with

painful slowness, to knit. LINDA is trying not to cry. She is

trying her God-damnedest.

There is a knock at the door. LINDA freezes. Then, trying to

be totally matter-of-fact, she puts down the sweater, crosses

to the door and opens it.

LINDA stares at him. NICK gives a little laugh and steps in.

She hugs him for a moment, as hard as she can, then they pull

apart.

They pull apart.

NICK removes his coat. LINDA pulls the sweater over him

The sweater is huge, a great rumpled thing reaching almost to

NICK's knees.

She crosses to a garbage pail out of NICK's line of sight and

stuffs the sweater in it.

She begins to sob. CAMERA CLOSES ON HER FACE:

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

NICK and LINDA are some distance away. NICK is shaking hands

with an ENTHUSIASTIC MAN while LINDA stands to one side,

watching his face, and so full of love that she seems about

to burst. ANOTHER MAN comes over. LINDA takes the MAN's arm

and presents him to NICK.

WE CANNOT HEAR WHAT IS BEING SAID. THE ONLY SOUND COMES FROM

THE MILL WHICH LOOMS UP BEHIND THEM OUT THE FROZEN VALLEY

BELOW.

INT. PIZZA PARLOR - TABLE BY WINDOW - DAY

NICK and LINDA sit opposite one another. Across the street a

coal train is rumbling slowly by and NICK is watching it. The

cars are black, interchangable, and they roll on and on.

Suddenly the last car appears. The car passes and there is

silence.

LINDA gives NICK a smile.

LINDA stares at him. She doesn't know what to say, how to

respond. NICK forces a grin, gestures with his hand and

shrugs. He picks up the check, stands.

INT. SUPERMARKET - BACK ROOM - DAY

The place is full of crates and boxes. ONE CREW is unloading

a tractor-trailer. ANOTHER CREW is stacking and unpacking.

NICK stands with LINDA and a red-faced, cigar-chewing MANAGER

who is pumping NICK's hand, slapping him on the back and

shouting orders all at the same time.

He goes off.

NICK nods. A STOCK BOY comes by and whistles.

NICK nods.

NICK nods again. LINDA hurries off. The MANAGER comes in from

behind, clapping NICK on the shoulder and going for his ear

EXT. STEEL MILL PARKING LOT - DAY

NICK stands by the entrance to the mill. It is cold and he

looks as if he had been waiting for some time. Suddenly

STEELWORKERS begin streaming out the doors, heading for their

cars. NICK cranes his neck and then he catches sight of

ALBERT and VINCE.

ALBERT turns. He grabs VINCE and pulls him through the

departing STEELWORKERS.

VINCE grabs NICK's hand, shakes it. Then ALBERT does the

same.

THEY start for the cars.

VINCE makes a gesture, shrugs.

VINCE looks around. Cars are streaming out of the lot, horns

blaring. VINCE pulls back his coat and shows a .38 Smith and

Weston in a holster on his hip.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT

NICK comes through the CROWD OF STEELWORKERS shaking hands.

The STEELWORKERS treat him with immense respect. There are no

cracks; there are no jokes. They squeeze his shoulder, pat

his back, reaching out for him, touching him.

JOHN pushes out of the crowd.

JOHN pushes them all into a booth. A tray arrives loaded with

beer and shots of whiskey.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT - LATER

NICK sits at the bar flanked by VINCE and ALBERT. Both VINCE

and ALBERT are completely glassed out. Behind, in the booths,

three or four STEELWORKERS are sleeping. JOHN moves around

behind the counter wiping things off.

JOHN, ALBERT and VINCE exchange glances, nod.

He walks in a circle and then stops, staring at them.

NICK turns and goes out.

INT. SAL'S HOUSE - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT

The room is very dark. ANGELA sits at a lace-covered table by

the window where a street lamp illuminates her in an eerie

glow. ANGELA holds a portable radio in tier hand, a very tiny

one, and she fiddles with the dial, going from one station to

another.

There is a sound from the hallway, then SAL'S MOTHER comes in

with NICK.

SAL'S MOTHER goes out. ANGELA lights up a cigarette.

ANGELA begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands

up.

She stares at NICK for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and

writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. NICK

comes up behind her. ANGELA finishes, puts down the pen and

stands with her back against the wall. NICK tears off the

piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket.

ANGELA laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding

NICK's eyes.

The door to the kitchen bangs open and SAL'S MOTHER comes in

with an electric toaster and a screwdriver.

Pushes the toaster in NICK's arms.

EXT. RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT

NICK sits on the steps with the toaster that Sal's mother

gave him in his lap. It is snowing and from inside the church

we hear the CHOIR SINGING. The sound is massive, deep and

dark, like a great river rolling through the night.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK. He is staring at something, tears

glistening in his eyes.

EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - REVERSE ANGLE (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

We see a lone telephone booth at the curb. The door is half

open and snow is blowing in.

EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - ORIGINAL ANGLE - NIGHT

NICK closes his eyes, leans his head forward and takes it in

his hands.

INT. MOTEL NICK'S UNIT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

LINDA steps out of the shower and begins to dry herself.

LINDA pulls on a short and very sexy nightie, then looks at

herself in the mirror. She is very excited, very nervous. She

strikes a pose, pulling up the bottom of the nightie and

poking a finger in her mouth.

NICK doesn't answer. LINDA pulls the door full open, takes

one last look at herself and goes out.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

As LINDA comes out of the bathroom her face falls and she

stops dead in her tracks.

NICK is lying on the bed -- sprawled on his back, one shoe

off and sound asleep.

NICK doesn't stir, doesn't budge. LINDA crosses and looks at

him -- hungrily, top to bottom -- then she gives his toe a

wistful shake.

But NICK is out, gone. LINDA lets out a little moan and sits

down on the chair beside the bed. Then, almost immediately,

she stands and begins taking off his clothes. She takes off

his shoes, then both socks. As she goes to undo his belt, his

shirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a

fresh scar. LINDA stares at the scar for a moment, then she

slowly exposes the whole of NICK's chest.

NICK'S CHEST IS COVERED WITH A SERIES OF TERRIFYING FRESH

SCARS. THE SCARS ARE RAISED; THEY ARE INTER-CONNECTED AND

STUDDED WITH ANGRY SUTURE MARKS, LIKE A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF

SOME UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUND.

CAMERA HOLDS ON LINDA'S FACE.

INT. STEEL MILL - CASTING ROOM - DAY

NICK stands at the handle of a long metal rod. At the other

end of the rod ALBERT and VINCE are attaching metallic

strips. When ALBERT and VINCE have secured the strips they

signal to NICK and all three of them lower their goggles.

CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. NICK is standing below a furnace

which is seven stories high, towering above him into a maze

of cat-walks and monstrous steel-hipped cranes.

ALBERT and VINCE give a signal and the CRANE OPERATOR raises

the door at the bottom of the furnace. NICK is now alone,

standing like Don Quixote with his lance. As NICK advances

toward the base of the furnace with his rod the surface of

his asbestos suit begins to smoke and bits of lint which have

stuck to it burst into flame. Within reach of the furnace

now, NICK pauses. Then, lifting the metal rod, he jams it

through the open doorway at the base of the furnace. There is

a white flash as the metallic strips explode and then a

geyser of molten steel erupts in a huge jet through the

doorway, passing NICK at the level of his shoulders and

showering him in a great cascade of white sparks.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT

NICK sits at the bar, silent, hunched over a beer, lost in

thought. All around him STEELWORKERS are shouting, yelling,

cracking jokes. After a moment VINCE pushes in, claps him on

the back.

VINCE stares at NICK. His respiration is up, his mouth is

bone dry and his eyes are as big as saucers. For a moment his

belief is total, then a frown crosses his face.

He spots JOHN passing with a tray of beer.

ALBERT scoops JOHN into his arms where he holds him from

behind.

They all take a beer. JOHN raises his glass, solemnly.

VINCE cracks up, howling.

VINCE collapses on the floor.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer. His

hunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he

is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the

window by a street light on the corner. There is a sound

outside, then the lights come on as LINDA enters with

groceries.

LINDA crosses to the doorway.

NICK looks at the equipment on the floor.

NICK gets to his feet, suddenly. His face is twisted with

pain and his voice is cracked with emotion.

NICK can hardly breathe. It is as if he were choking.

A car pulls up outside. The HORN begins blowing, then VINCE

and ALBERT begin pounding on the wall of the trailer.

NICK swings his pack on his back, picks up his rifle and

heads for the door. LINDA follows, still clutching her

groceries, her emotions so pulverized she can't even speak.

NICK IS GONE. LINDA STANDS MOTIONLESS, CLUTCHING HER

GROCERIES, STARING AT THE TRAILER DOOR. IT IS DARK OUTSIDE.

SNOW IS BLOWING IN. THE DOOR CLOSES SLOWLY, WITH A FAINT

HISS, AND THEN CLICKS SHUT.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST - DAY

Snow is blowing, swirling past the trunks of stark, ice

covered trees. There is no horizon. Sky and earth are bound

in a moan of wind, in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the

whispering, fitful, spinning flakes.

NICK appears, suddenly, as a gust of wind shifts the slanting

snow. NICK is moving easily, heading slightly uphill,

following the contour of the slope. As he draws closer we see

that he is following a SET OF FRESH TRACKS.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOODS - ROCK LEDGE - DAY

A magnificent SEVEN POINT BUCK stands by a grove of hemlocks,

looking down the slope.

NICK appears below, barely visible in the swirling snow.

The BUCK watches NICK for a moment, then turns unhurriedly

and vanishes into the trees.

EXT. RIDGE NEAR CAMP - DAY

VINCE is out of breath, clawing his way up a steep slope on

all fours. JOHN and ALBERT, who have reached a level area

above VINCE, unsling their rifles. SHOTS are going off in

every direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that

it sounds like a full scale war.

JOHN nudges ALBERT. FOUR DEER are coming down the slope,

single file. JOHN and ALBERT raise their rifles and FIRE. TWO

OF THE DEER FALL AND THE REMAINING TAKE OFF. VINCE, who is

just getting to his feet, unslings his rifle, trips and falls

down. JOHN and ALBERT drag VINCE to his feet and then rush

over to the TWO DEAD DEER.

Leans his rifle on the horns of one of the fallen DEER.

JOHN signals with his head. VINCE turns. ANOTHER DEER has

come out of the woods. The DEER is rattled by the gunfire and

peers at VINCE uncertainly. VINCE spins and grabs his gun,

which immediately goes off. He slams another shell in the

chamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is

hooked on the antlers of the DEAD DEER and another shot

ricochets off a nearby rock. JOHN and ALBERT dive for cover.

As they look up, they see the DEER trot down the slope and

then VINCE, firing wildly, running after it.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY

The wind is much stronger, moaning in the trees. NICK

appears, moving fast, at a near trot. Suddenly he stops,

listening. At the same moment there is a snort. NICK wheels.

The BUCK is behind him, bounding away.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY

The BUCK appears, trotting out of the swirling snow. Reaching

a deadfall the BUCK pauses, looking back, and then turns

sharp left and disappears.

NICK comes out of the snow. He is winded but still going

hard.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DEADFALL - DAY

NICK reaches the deadfall, hesitates, then rapidly springs

over. As he touches down on the other side there is a

growling sound.

NICK grabs for the deadfall. The wind shifts and we see that

he has stepped onto a boulder which is loosely planted at the

top of a steep scree slope. As NICK watches, the boulder

begins to roll, then to bound, dislodging other rocks and

boulders, all of them bouncing and leaping and cracking...

and then falling -- soundless -- over a sheer ledge to

unknown depths below.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY

ALBERT and JOHN have dragged their TWO DEAD DEER to a log

beside the shack. They sit side by side, drenched in sweat,

guzzling beer out of both hands.

JOHN lowers his beer. ALBERT gives him a blank expression,

then cracks up. SHOTS explode nearby. At first the shots are

scattered but they quickly open into a FULL BARRAGE. ALBERT

and JOHN stand up.

EXT. HIGHWAY EMBANKMENT - DAY

The DEER that VINCE was chasing earlier comes hobbling out of

the woods pursued by a GROUP OF HALF-DRUNK HUNTERS. VINCE

comes barreling through the HUNTERS, shouting and screaming.

VINCE's clothes are in tatters, the sole is gone from one

shoe and the barrel of his rifle is jammed up with mud and

perceptibly bent.

VINCE loses his footing and rolls down the embankment, head

over heels.

EXT. DITCH - DAY

VINCE comes up ten feet from the bewildered DEER. He raises

his rifle, fires, and the BARREL SPLITS OPEN. SHOTS begin

coming in, thudding in the mud and ricocheting off rocks. The

DEER wheels out on the highway. VINCE heaves his rifle at the

DEER, draws his pistol...

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Cars are parked on both sides of the road. HUNTERS are

sitting in the cars, drinking, eating sandwiches and warming

themselves at small fires. MORE HUNTERS are up on the

embankment.

The panicked DEER bolts down the highway between the parked

cars. The HUNTERS ON THE EMBANKMENT open fire. The HUNTERS IN

THE CARS dive for cover.

VINCE FIRES, FIRES AGAIN. SHOTS are ringing everywhere.

HUNTERS are shouting, running, yelling. A car window goes

out, a headlight goes out. The DEER is hit, falls and gets

up. VINCE takes aim. A FLEEING HUNTER bowls him over. The

DEER bolts for the woods, bullets smashing all around it.

VINCE scrambles to his feet and plunges after it.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

The DEER staggers through the trees, blood pouring from its

wounds. VINCE comes stumbling after it. HE FIRES, FIRES

AGAIN.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY

ALBERT and JOHN stand with their beers, looking into the

woods. A shot zings by, close, and they dive behind a log.

The DEER comes out of the woods, barely able to keep moving.

VINCE appears, reeling. He takes aim at the DEER and there is

a DULL CLICK. VINCE jams his pistol back in his holster.

ALBERT indicates his rifle. VINCE stumbles over to it, rams a

cartridge in the chamber.

VINCE staggers to the cabin door. The DEER is lying on the

floor, motionless, DEAD.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - FROZEN LAKE - DAY

The wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way

and then the other. NICK appears in the distance, a black

speck in the endless expanse of shifting white.

As NICK draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. His

clothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow

gasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. As NICK

APPROACHES CAMERA HE FALTERS AND LIMPS TO A STOP. There are

no tracks. There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in

the driving snow.

The wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in

again from another way. Suddenly it stops entirely. In the

silence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock.

NICK turns. The BUCK is standing on the shoreline, not thirty

feet away, looking down at him.

NICK pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights

down the barrel.

WE SEE THE BUCK THROUGH NICK'S SIGHTS. IT IS A CLEAR SHOT.

NICK'S FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER. HE HAS ONLY TO SQUEEZE IT.

NICK LOWERS HIS RIFLE. THE BUCK SNORTS, TOSSES HIS HORNS AND

DISAPPEARS IN THE SLANTING SNOW.

NICK STANDS MOTIONLESS, STARING AFTER IT, SO WONDER-STRUCK HE

HAS FORGOTTEN TO BREATHE.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - OVERLOOK - DAY

NICK sits on his haunches with his back against a sheer rock

face. As he devours a Hostess Twinkie he looks out over a

snow-shrouded landscape of such spectacular beauty that it

might be something from a dream.

INT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

The Coleman lantern hangs from the rafter, rocking in the

wind. NICK is propped against the wall, dozing. JOHN is out

cold. ALBERT and VINCE are both drunk and arguing bitterly.

VINCE is sheet-white, trembling. He grabs up the pistol and

cocks it.

NICK is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at

the pistol in disbelief. Suddenly he springs, seizes the gun

with one hand and slams VINCE to the floor. VINCE gets up.

NICK slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and

begins pounding his head against the wall. ALBERT lurches

over, pulls NICK away.

VINCE gets to his feet. Blood is streaming down his face.

NICK takes the pistol.

NICK looks at him, then he EMPTIES THE PISTOL INTO THE FLOOR.

For a moment there is absolute silence. The wind moans in the

trees, snow curls through the open door and JOHN, who is

still soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore.

NICK looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands...

NICK goes out.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

For a moment NICK stands in the light from the door,

listening to the wind. He looks down at the pistol again,

then he heaves it into the trees.

The wind gusts. The snow swirls and hisses, slipping through

the woods in great streaming wraiths.

NICK watches it for a moment, then he turns and goes back in.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK

The trailer is lonely looking, DARK and cold. VINCE pulls

into the yard beside NICK's car and skips to a stop. NICK

gets out, says a few words to VINCE and everyone laughs. NICK

goes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and

pounds on the car. VINCE takes off, thudding over the curb

with his load of THREE DEAD DEER.

NICK crosses to the trailer and goes inside.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

TWO DOZEN AMPUTEES in wheelchairs are watching a western.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

In the foreground a NURSE holds a telephone. Beyond the NURSE

we see a wizzened figure in a wheelchair coming slowly down

the polished corridor. As the figure draws closer we realize

it is SAL. SAL is dressed in a white hospital gown, the

bottom of which hangs over the front of the wheelchair and

trails limply on the floor. Both SAL's legs have been

amputated and he has lost one arm. His face is terribly

scarred and what expression he displays is centered in his

eyes.

SAL takes the telephone. THE SOUNDTRACK FROM THE MOVIE IN THE

RECREATION ROOM IS VERY LOUD.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK sits in a little chair by the window, still in his

hunting clothes, huddled anxiously over the receiver.

SAL looks around in desperation.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK holds the receiver, staring into it. There is the SOUND

OF WHOOPING, GRUNTING, THUNDERING HOOVES...

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

SAL is wheeling himself rapidly down the polished corridor.

At the doorway to the recreation room he pauses, looking back

at the DANGLING RECEIVER. Then he turns and disappears into

the flickering darkness, where BUGLES are sounding a cavalry

charge.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK listens to the SOUND OF THE BUGLES for a moment, then

puts the receiver back on the telephone. He stands, walks

around in a little circle - pained, terribly upset. His eye

falls on the clock. It is nearly eight o'clock. He turns,

hurries out the door.

EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping

carts which a CLERK is banging together.

NICK gets out of his car and goes in.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Two or three CHECKERS are closing out the registers up front.

NICK goes down a long aisle of bright packages. Coming out at

the back he finds LINDA sitting in a green plastic chair,

crying.

LINDA looks at him, tears streaming down her face.

NICK walks back down the aisle between the bright packages.

INT. NICK'S CAR - SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The CLERK is still collecting abandoned shopping carts. The

carts crash and clank as the CLERK rams them together.

NICK sits behind the wheel, watching the clerk. His hands

begin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car.

EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NICK'S CAR - NIGHT

NICK watches the lights go out in the market. LINDA comes out

of the door and crosses towards him.

LINDA nods. NICK fumbles for the door.

LINDA takes him in her arms and holds him tight.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

LINDA is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across

the pillows, like a dancer leaping.

NICK stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking

down at her. After a moment he draws the covers over her,

fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then

goes to the window.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF NICK'S TRAILER (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

The wind is blowing. Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the

frozen ruts and a cat comes by, MEOWING. Suddenly a MAN

appears walking slowly down the street. The MAN is elegantly

dressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest,

polished boots and a Stetson hat. As the MAN draws under the

light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at NICK's trailer.

THE MAN IS MERLE, OR IF NOT MERLE IT IS A FACE SO STRIKINGLY

SIMILAR THAT NICK ALMOST LETS OUT A CRY.

THE MAN UNDER THE STREET LAMP PAUSES, JUST FOR AN INSTANT,

THEN HE TURNS AND MOVES ON DOWN THE STREET.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK backs away from the window. For a moment he stands

motionless, hardly able to believe his eyes. He looks over at

LINDA, he looks down at a chair, then he pushes his face to

the window again.

EXT. STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

The street is empty. The MAN is gone.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK hesitates, then he sheds the blanket and pulls on pants,

shirt, jacket and jams his sockless feet into a pair of

slices.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK comes out into the street. There is no one in sight.

NICK crosses to the intersection of Columbine.

EXT. INTERSECTION OF COLUMBINE - NIGHT

No one. Nothing. A beer can rolling in the wind.

NICK jams himself against a wall, zippers his jacket. He is

irked with himself, a little frightened. Suddenly he hears a

car door close and en engine start up. A black limousine

pulls out of a nearby street and comes past him slowly. A

CHAUFFEUR is at the wheel.

The PASSENGER in back appears to be the MAN he saw, but the

MAN is looking out the window on the other side and his face

is not visible.

As NICK watches, the limousine rapidly gathers speed. The

tail lights grow small, then the car dips over a hill and

disappears.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Sunlight streams through a window. The television is going.

In a far corner SAL sits in his wheelchair, sleeping.

CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON SAL. His head has fallen to one side

and his single arm sticks into the air -- as if he had failed

in his grasp of something, as if he were drowning. On a tray

in front of him is an untouched breakfast of orange juice,

milk and a little box of Wheaties.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY

Someone is descending the stairs. After a moment the feet

appear, clad in expensive cowboy boots. We see expensive,

tailor-made trousers, a belt buckle embossed with a six

shooter... and then, suddenly, MERLE'S FACE.

MERLE slows in his descent, stops, looking at something.

EXT. V.A. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE (MERLE'S POV) - DAY

NICK is getting out of a cab. He pays the driver and starts

toward the building.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY

MERLE watches NICK for a moment, his face utterly without

expression, then MERLE continues down the stairs.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY

NICK is pushing SAL down a walkway.

Turns SAL and sits on a bench.

SAL laughs.

NICK pulls a suitcase off the rack behind SAL's chair.

NICK sets the suitcase on a low wall and starts to undo the

clasps.

The suitcase slips over the back of the wall.

NICK swings up on the wall and then he freezes. The lid of

the suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are

scattered all down the slope of a steep embankment.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - EMBANKMENT WITH MONEY - DAY

NICK looks down at the money scattered at his feet. The

bundles are made up of hundreds and they are everywhere.

NICK bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking

for identification. There is nothing. As he straightens up he

notices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the

bundles of bills.

The paper is about an inch square. The corners are tattered

and it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket

for a long time.

NICK picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and

unfolds it.

THE CARD READS "EXHIBITIONS". IT CONTAINS A TELEPHONE NUMBER

ON THE LOWER LEFT CORNER AND IS IDENTICAL TO THE CARD ARMAND

GAVE TO NICK WHEN HE CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN BEHIND HIS

ROULETTE GAME IN SAIGON.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - VALLEY OVERLOOK - DAY

NICK leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable

cars of a coal train roll slowly by. SAL sits with the

suitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying.

NICK looks at SAL. His head is spinning and he brings himself

back with effort.

NICK is standing slightly behind SAL, looking down at the

money. The reality of what MERLE is doing, has nearly

overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he

maintains a casual tone.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - U.S. ARMY AIRFIELD - TEXAS - DAY

The place is a madhouse of activity. As jets scream overhead

TROOPS embarking for Saigon are being counted and recounted.

SERGEANTS are yelling off names. CLERKS are typing forms and

papers. Forklift trucks weave in and out, DRIVERS cursing.

NICK is back in uniform. He stands at a window watching a jet

transport being prepared for loading. A CLERK comes by,

arguing with a SERGEANT. The CLERK sets down his clipboard to

consult the SERGEANT's papers. NICK picks up the clipboard

and moves into the CROWD.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - ANOTHER LOCATION - DAY

NICK spots a lone SECOND LIEUTENANT sitting on his gear. More

OFFICERS are waiting nearby but the SECOND LIEUTENANT seems

not to know them.

NICK moves in close enough to read the SECOND LIEUTENANT's

name tag.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

NICK walks along briskly with the LIEUTENANT at his side.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

NICK comes to a door, opens it.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - UTILITY CLOSET - DAY

The LIEUTENANT walks into the closet and comes to a stop,

looking puzzled. NICK comes in behind him, closes the door

and picks up a length of pipe.

The LIEUTENANT stares at NICK, dumbfounded.

The LIEUTENANT nods, begins taking off his uniform.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - UTILITY CLOSET - DAY

NICK has changed into the LIEUTENANT's uniform and tied him

to a chair. The LIEUTENANT is in tears. NICK is going through

his orders.

NICK throws down the pipe in disgust, whips a gag around the

LIEUTENANT's mouth and ties it.

Slams the door.

EXT. SAIGON AIRPORT - TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT

Viet Cong SAPPERS have just attacked. A number of jet

fighters are burning, bodies are strewn over the tarmac and

jeeps with SOLDIERS are racing back and forth.

Out beyond, the jet transport taxis into view, lumbering like

a great silver monster out of the night.

INT. JET TRANSPORT - NIGHT

NICK stands in the aisle next to a COLONEL who is peering out

the window.

NICK nods.

NICK nods. EVERYONE starts out.

EXT. JET TRANSPORT - DEBARKATION RAMP - NIGHT

A SIREN is screaming in the distance. NICK looks around

nervously. The COLONEL is still right in beside him.

The scream of the SIREN grows louder. Suddenly a Jeep careens

around the corner followed by a huge black Cadillac flying

American flags on the fenders. Both vehicles screech to a

stop and an MP jumps out of the jeep with a loud hailer.

NICK is hurried to the limousine where a SECOND MP holds the

door.

NICK gets in the limousine. The SECOND MP slams the door,

jumps in the front and they take off with sirens wailing.

INT. LIMOUSINE - SAIGON - NIGHT

There are jeeps with MP's ahead; there are jeeps with MP's

behind. Seated beside NICK is a gigantic MARINE CORPORAL who

stares rigidly ahead.

EXT. CAVALCADE - SAIGON - NIGHT

Pedestrians and bicyclists flee as the cavalcade comes

screaming down a wide boulevard.

EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - SAIGON - NIGHT

The jeeps peel off to the side. The gate swings open and the

limousine enters the compound.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

A STRING QUARTET is playing. GUESTS in evening clothes are

drinking champagne.

NICK enters with the MARINE CORPORAL and is whisked rapidly

down a hallway.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - KITCHEN - NIGHT

NICK stands in front of a huge range staring down at a table.

On the table there is a basket of eggs, an omelette pan and a

pile of mushrooms. Across from the table six SERVANTS with

napkins on their arms stand waiting with plates.

NICK turns. The MARINE CORPORAL is holding a chef's hat. NICK

takes off his cap, puts on the chef's hat. Suddenly a door

comes open and the AMERICAN AMBASSADOR and his WIFE come in.

The WIFE shakes her head. The AMBASSADOR winks.

The AMBASSADOR and his WIFE hurry out. There is dead silence.

NICK pulls the MARINE CORPORAL to one side, points to his

crotch.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT

NICK comes down the corridor behind the MARINE CORPORAL. As

he passes a straight-back chair standing against the wall he

picks it up and swings it down on the MARINE CORPORAL'S head.

The blow is ferocious. The chair splinters into pieces and

the MARINE CORPORAL goes down with a dull thud.

NICK stands for a moment, looking at him. Then he kneels,

removes his pistol and jams it in his belt.

EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - WALKWAY TO PEDESTRIAN EXIT - NIGHT

Three MARINE GUARDS are standing at parade rest by an open

iron gate.

As NICK appears in his white chef's hat the GUARDS snap to

attention and he walks into the CROWD OF ASIANS streaming by

outside.

EXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - BUSY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

NICK takes out his wallet, extracts the tattered calling card

that he found with SAL'S money and dials the number. He lets

it ring a long time but there is no answer.

EXT. DESERTED STREET WITH SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

NICK is not sure where he is. Suddenly he stops, recognizing

the yard with the little grape arbor where he met ARMAND.

EXT. YARD BEHIND SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

The yard is grown over. As NICK goes in there comes a low

buzz of flies. He trips over something, draws back. Seeing a

candle on the little table under the grape arbor, he crosses

and lights it.

The yard is full of discarded champagne bottles, red velvet

cushions and rotting CORPSES. NICK leans over one of the

CORPSES. The skin is falling away and the eye sockets writhe

with maggots.

NICK straightens, looks around.

The back door to the building is open. NICK draws his pistol

and goes in.

INT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

NICK finds his way blocked by a door. He steps back, hurls

himself against it. The door gives way with a crash and he

staggers into the middle of a small stage hung with red

velvet curtains and furnished with a table and two chairs.

Out beyond the proscenium, huddled together in a litter of

broken cafe tables, a FAMILY OF REFUGEES stare at him in

terror from the other side of a small fire.

The REFUGEES cower back even further.

POUNDING and BANGING come from the direction of the front

door. NICK crosses...

INT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

NICK readies his pistol, cautiously unbolts the door and

jerks it open. The COLONEL FROM THE AIRPLANE tumbles in and

falls flat on his back. Standing in the doorway, lit by the

headlights of two cars, is a party of U.S. OFFICERS, ARVN

OFFICERS and WHORES.

He fishes a piece of paper out of his breast pocket.

The COLONEL opens a brown paper bag he is carrying and

presents her with a large red, white and blue dildo.

The WHORE shrieks with pleasure. EVERYONE laughs.

The COLONEL throws an arm around NICK and they all start for

the cars.

Pulls NICK close so he can whisper in his ear.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - SAIGON OUTSKIRTS NIGHT

An elegant house of French design is ablaze with lights. The

house is encircled by a stone terrace on which tables have

been set up. Over the terrace and strung out for a hundred

yards into the surrounding trees are countless paper lanterns

which bob and sway in the wind. GUESTS are everywhere --

wandering in and out of the house, sitting at the tables and

strolling under the trees. For the most part the GUESTS are

AMERICANS and SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The majority of these are

OFFICERS IN UNIFORM, but there are numerous CIVILIANS mixed

among them and the CIVILIANS are attired in everything from

sports shirts to white linen suits and tuxedos. As to

nationality there are no limits. There are FRENCH, GERMANS,

BELGIANS, SWISS, CHINESE, BRITISH and AUSTRALIANS. WHORES and

MISTRESSES abound. WIVES are not greatly in evidence, except

to dog the heels of heavily armed ARVN GUARDS who wander

about, glass-eyed, drinking champagne.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - PARKING AREA - NIGHT

Jeeps, personnel carriers, trucks and light tanks are parked

side by side with gleaming Mercedes limousines, staff cars

from various government agencies and a blitz of civilian

vehicles running from sedans to motor scooters.

More vehicles arrive by the minute and exotic couples, like

plumed birds, debark in the swirling dust.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - CLEARING IN TREES - NIGHT

A dozen ARVN helicopters have put down between the trees. One

has crashed and lies on its side with a broken rotor.

There is a mounting clatter in the distance and another

helicopter comes out of the sky. As it sets down a dashingly

handsome AIR FORCE OFFICER hops out and extends a hand to his

WIFE. When his WIFE has descended the OFFICER opens a back

compartment in the fusilage and carefully takes out their

BABY. He hands the BABY to his WIFE and they stroll off

toward the house.

INT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT

Gambling tables are set up in all the rooms. The betting is

heavy, champagne flows like water and the atmosphere is one

of reckless abandon, as if money, like love, were good for an

hour.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE STAGE - NIGHT

Low bleachers covered in red velvet are set in a semi-circle

facing a small stage. The stage is lit with a single,

blindingly bright spotlight and is furnished with a table and

two velvet-covered chairs. Two CONTESTANTS, both of them

VIETNAMESE, sit opposite one another. Between them, lying on

the table, is a revolver. Both CONTESTANTS are dressed in

tuxedos. Both wear red numbers on their downstage arm.

Although the bleachers are not yet full, eager BETTORS jam

the first three rows. Here CLERKS with change trays take the

bets, signalling each transaction to a MARKER who chalks the

shifting odds on a large board.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, standing in the aisle, staring in

disbelief at the evolution of the game he once played.

Now a REFEREE enters the stage carrying two strips of scarlet

cloth.

The CONTESTANTS wrap their heads with the scarlet cloth.

The REFEREE places the pistol back in the center of the table

and spins a wheel whose -intervals are alternately marked L

and R. The wheel clatters to a stop with the marker on L.

The REFEREE steps out of the light. A gong sounds. The

CONTESTANT on the left picks up the pistol, spins the

cylinder, cocks it and

places it to his temple. He hesitates, pulls the trigger...

and clicks out.

NICK is unable to bear it. He turns, starts around toward the

back of the stage. AS NICK MOVES THROUGH THE GUESTS WE HEAR

THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER CLICKING, AMPLIFIED OVER A P.A.

SYSTEM. WE HEAR THE CLICK OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED...

NICK turns. The SECOND CONTESTANT has the pistol to his

temple. He pulls the trigger... THE GUN GOES OFF WITH A

DEAFENING ROAR and he topples on the floor.

The FIRST CONTESTANT STEPS FORWARD AS THE SPOTLIGHT NARROWS

TO CONTAIN HIM ALONE. HE BOWS, CLASPS HIS HANDS ABOVE HIS

HEAD AND DANCES AROUND.

NICK stares at the FIRST CONTESTANT celebrating his victory.

He looks around him. BETTORS are screaming and yelling in

five languages.

NICK starts off again, hurrying.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - BACKSTAGE AREA NIGHT

NICK comes upon a pile of six naked CORPSES with their heads

blown off. Opposite the CORPSES -- sitting, standing, pacing,

squatting in the dirt -- are a GROUP OF WAITING CONTESTANTS.

Some of these are AMERICAN. Most are SOUTH VIETNAMESE,

several of whom have come with WIVES and FAMILIES. A few of

the contestants are well dressed, most are in rags. THREE. OF

THE WAITING CONTESTANTS ARE WEARING TUXEDOS.

Suddenly a WOMAN WITH A BABY lets out a shriek. NICK spins.

TWO BURLY MEN appear, bringing the CORPSE OF THE SECOND

CONTESTANT. As the WOMAN WITH THE BABY begins sobbing and

screaming with grief the BURLY MEN strip the tuxedo off the

SECOND CONTESTANT and then, as each article is summarily

removed, they begin dressing one of the WAITING CONTESTANTS

in it.

NICK turns and finds ARMAND behind him. ARMAND studies him

for a fraction of a second and then smiles.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TREES BY TERRACE - NIGHT

GUESTS are still coming in from the cars, strolling down

through the trees in bright coveys and flocks, chattering

like birds.

Laughter comes from the terrace. Glass tinkles and the tiny

lanterns bob and sway.

NICK appears, hurrying down the steps. Suddenly he stops.

MERLE is sitting at a table under a nearby tree. He is alone,

dressed in a tuxedo, watching the arriving GUESTS with an

expression of dreamy detachment, as if they were rain drops,

or snow flakes, or falling stones.

MERLE turns, watching NICK as he crosses toward him. When

NICK reaches the table, he stands.

NICK sits. MERLE's self-possession has thrown him. He doesn't

know where to start.

For a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, like

faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as if

to some landscape far beyond.

A BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL steps up and whispers something

in MERLE's ear.

MERLE and the VIETNAMESE GIRL move into the CROWD.

NICK starts after them. He can see them ahead, moving rapidly

through a GROUP OF ARVN OFFICERS and WHORES.

NICK sees he can never overtake them directly. He cuts around

to the terrace.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT

NICK maneuvers his way down to the end of the terrace.

NICK reaches the end of the terrace. MERLE and the BEAUTIFUL

VIETNAMESE GIRL have disappeared.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT

NICK sits at one of the tables. The terrace is deserted.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT

The gaming tables are utterly deserted. AS NICK WANDERS

THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS THE SOUND OF THE GAME CONTINUES OVER

THE P.A. SYSTEM -- THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER SPINNING, THE

SOUND OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED... AND CLICK AFTER CLICK

INTO EMPTY CHAMBERS.

Suddenly NICK can stand it no more. He turns and starts

toward the entrance to the bleachers.

A SHOT EXPLODES OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM. NICK freezes, then he

runs.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE THEATRE - NIGHT

NICK appears at the back of the aisle between the bleachers.

The CROWD is going wild, yelling and screaming. NICK pushes

through a group of BETTORS and then stops. A look of stunned

relief spreads over his features.

On the stage a tall figure stands alone in the spotlight,

head bowed in acknowledgement of the OVATION.

NICK grins. He begins yelling and screaming along with

everyone else.

On the stage the tall figure raises his head, pumps his fists

in the air and begins hooting maniacally.

... WE NOW SEE, AS DOES NICK, THAT THE TALL FIGURE IN THE

SPOTLIGHT IS NOT MERLE AT ALL. IT IS MERLE'S OPPONENT.

INT. V.F.W. POST - BASEMENT - DAY

Pipes crisscross the ceiling and there is the faint hiss of

leaking steam. Seated on a bench and all dressed-up in their

uniforms are FIVE OLD VETS. TWO VETS are on the nod. THE

OTHER THREE -- rheumy-eyed and ancient -- give patient

attention to the SIXTH VET who stands beside the boiler with

a bugle, trying to play TAPS.

The VET WITH THE BUGLE tries it again, flubs it, starts

over...

INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY

Three tables have been set up in the middle of the floor. The

tables have been laid with white cloth and the OLDER WOMEN

are setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for a

funeral breakfast. They work in silence, fussing over the

placement of each knife and fork.

AS THE WOMEN WORK WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR SINGING AS

THE SERVICE PROGRESSES IN THE CHURCH. AT FIRST THE SOUND IS

BARELY AUDIBLE, EASILY MATCHED BY THE FAINT NOTES OF THE VET

WITH THE BUGLE IN THE BASEMENT BELOW.

BUT NOW THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR GROWS -- A SOUND AS DEEP AS

WATER, AS DARK AS NIGHT; A SOUND LIKE STONE.

Gradually, one by one, the OLDER WOMEN stop fussing with the

table. They stand motionless, listening.

EXT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - DAY

A HEARSE waits at the curb. The day is windless, cold and

grey Snow is drifting down and the gleaming vehicle emits a

ghostly cloud of white exhaust.

THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR IS MUCH LOUDER, ASCENDING IN DARK

TRIUMPH TO A SUDDEN, FINAL NOTE.

In the ringing silence of the MUSIC'S END the doors to the

church swing open. NICK, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN appear with

MERLE's flag-draped COFFIN. Followed by MOURNERS, they bear

the COFFIN slowly down the steps.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Snow drifts down from a leaden sky as the MOURNERS stand

together on a steep hillside of tilted, weather-worn

headstones. The mill looms behind them, breathing roiling

clouds of steam and uttering a dull concordia of clanks and

groans.

EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - DAY

The PRIEST completes his reading of the 23rd PSALM. The

MOURNERS join in the LORD'S PRAYER.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, VINCE, ALBERT, JOHN and SAL. They help

SAL to the side of the grave. It is awkward. The chair gets

stuck and they have to carry it. THEY ALL pick up a handful

of dirt and then, following NICK's lead, they throw it in.

NICK steps back from the grave, nods to the VETS. The VETS

come to attention. The VET WITH THE BUGLE steps forward and

tremblingly, but perfectly, PLAYS TAPS.

INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY

The meal is over. The WOMEN are drinking coffee, the MEN are

smoking and putting down the beer. There is muted laughter

and conversation.

NICK sits at the head of one of the tables, flanked by LINDA

and SAL. He looks stunned. His food is untouched, there are

tears in his eyes and he hardly seems to know where he is.

NICK nods, picks up a piece of toast and then, forgetting all

about it, lays it absently on his plate.

VINCE comes up behind NICK, looking somewhat officious in a

new blue suit.

NICK nods. VINCE raps on a glass.

Tears are streaming down NICK's face and he sits down,

looking miserable.

JOHN goes to the piano, hurried along by VINCE. He sits down,

casts a quick glance to the ceiling and begins playing

"America The Beautiful".

A FEW VOICES being SINGING. OTHERS join in. ALBERT stands up.

Then EVERYONE stands up.
