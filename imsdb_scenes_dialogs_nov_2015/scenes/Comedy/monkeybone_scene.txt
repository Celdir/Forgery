FADE IN:

MAIN CREDITS ROLL

over BLACK SCREEN, with PORTENTOUS SPOOKY MUSIC underneath. Just as the

music reaches its crescendo, we hear a simian SCREECH.

A BUCK-TOOTHED CARTOON MONKEY swings past on a vine. TITLE WIPES IN with

him:

TIGHT CLOSEUP - STANLEY (ANIMATED)

A POCKETWATCH swings back and forth in F.G. Gaping at it is a goofy,

bespectacled CARTOON CHARACTER, sucking his thumb as his EYES move back

and forth. After a moment, the LEFT EYE freezes in place - but the right

eye keeps going back and forth with the watch.

Now BOTH EYES are locked in place. The patient is hypnotized.

INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY (ANIMATED)

A squat, lumpy TEACHER, MISS HUDLAPP, is straining to erase the

Gettysburg Address, which is written along the very top of the

blackboard. There's an obtrusive, rhythmic BANGING noice in B.G.

REVERSE ANGLE - ON STANLEY

Hapless ten-year-old STANLEY, still goofy and bespectacled, in his

front-row desk. NAILS stick out of his head. The FOUR MEAN KIDS poised

around him lower their hammers and return to their seats, grumbling.

A dreamy SMILE crosses STANLEY's face as he gazes at MISS HUDLAPP.

As MISS HUDLAPP pulls her sweater off, TWO MASSIVE ARM-FLAPS - fifty

gallons of flab apiece - SPILL OUT and SMACK INTO THE FLOOR.

MISS HUDDLAPP claps two erasers together, kicking up a cloud of dust.

Young STANLEY watches, transfixed by her massive ARM FLAPS. We TRACK IN

on the gigantic ARM FLAPS as they swing hypnotically back and forth,

with a loud SLAP each time they collide.

Now we TRACK IN on the mesmerized STANLEY. A SONG comes up underneath:

Donna Summer, "I FEEL LOVE."

DOINK! STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror. The boys and girls

around him are pointing and tittering.

Grimacing in embarrassment, he discreetly places a heavy TEXTBOOK onto

his lap, suppressing the bulge in his pants. But SPROING!! - the BOOK

goes flying across the room. The BULGE is fighting back!

The kids DUCK AND COVER beneath their desks as STANLEY slams a STACK of

textbooks onto his lap. It's no use - the WHOLE STACK goes flying, and

BOOKS come raining down on the entire class! Now MISS HUDLAPP is staring

directly at him...

She marches toward him. STANLEY pulls his BACKPACK over his lap.

The BACKPACK bucks and wriggles, as if something inside is trying to GET

OUT. And then - with a flourish of rousing disco strings - IT DOES!

The libidinous cartoon monkey BURSTS OUT of the backpack, POINTS at MISS

HUDLAPP - and announces, in his Barry White baritone:

KC and the SUNSHINE BAND comes up underneath as MONKEYBONE DANCES to the

front of the class. He grabs MISS HUDLAPP by the hands and begins

dancing The Bump with her ARM FLAPS. Butt left, WHAP. Butt right, WHAP.

The KIDS are bug-eyed - agog. With each WHAP their little heads turn

back and forth as if they're watching a nude tennis match.

INT. SCREENING ROOM - ON AUDIENCE (LIVE-ACTION)

A roomful of LIVE HUMANS watching the cartoon, heads turning in sync

with the kids onscreen. TV-INDUSTRY HIPSTERS, AD EXECS, MANUFACTURER'S

REPS...they're all guests at this sneak preview of the Monkeybone show,

and they're LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY.

In the midst of the crowd is a handsome young couple: JULIE McELROY and

STU MILEY. JULIE's a research scientist, brainy, professional,

abnormally well-adjusted - and pretty enough that she'd be intimidating

if it weren't for a prominent goofy streak.

STU is the one guy in the auditorium who isn't laughing at the cartoon

on the screen. In fact, he's solemn as a judge - peering nervously

around to see how the rest of the audience is responding.

Why? Because he's the cartoonist who created the characters on screen.

In his looks (gangly, disheveled) and manner (sardonic, self-

deprecating), he's the obvious model for the character of STANLEY.

INT. CLASSROOM (ANIMATED)

As the monkey dance continues, we ZOOM IN on the mortified face of

LITTLE STANLEY. His eyes begin doing the familiar HYPNO-SWIRL...

INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE (ANIMATED)

A CUCKOO pops out of a wall clock. ADULT STANLEY'S THUMB pops out of his

mouth. He awakens from his trance in a cold sweat.

On the desk is a CATALOGUE, open to a two-page spread depicting a 40-

foot CABIN CRUISER. "NEW FOR SUMMER! ONLY $229,999.95!" With his free

hand, the SHRINK is working a CALCULATOR...

The SHRINK hustles STANLEY to the door and shakes his hand.

The SHRINK shoves STANLEY out and slams the door behind him. Two beats.

Then he doubles over, WEEPING with LAUGHTER.

Now he notices a BACKPACK, which STANLEY has left on the couch. It

TWITCHES slightly - of its own free will.

EXT. SHRINK'S BUILDING (ANIMATED)

A WINDOW shatters. The SHRINK comes hurtling out. MONKEYBONE STRADDLES

HIM like Slim Pickens riding an H-bomb, hootin' and hollerin' all the

way down to the street.

SPLAT! A gob of gore hits STANLEY in the face as he exits the building.

He kneels on the sidewalk - finding a PIPE and a GOATEE.

MONKEYBONE sticks his thumb in his butt as he and STANLEY toddle off

into the sunset.

INT. SCREENING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

STANDING O from the crowd as the cartoon ends and the lights come up.

HERB, an all-purpose sidekick type, appears at the podium:

HERB leads a round of APPLAUSE. JULIE nudges STU - the only guy in the

room who's still in his seat.

A SPOTLIGHT hits him, and he STANDS to tumultuous applause. He looks

genuinely stunned. He can't believe it's happening.

JULIE surreptitiously PINCHES him on the bottom, giving him a start. She

WINKS at him. He shoots her a small private smile - then turns to WAVE

at the adoring crowd.

INT. LOBBY - HALF-HOUR LATER - NIGHT

STU working his way through a crowd of well-wishers and FANS.

A beautiful, heavily-pierced FEMALE FAN hands STU a marker.

She exposes her taut midriff. STU thinks for a moment, then goes to

work. When he's done, Monkeybone appears to be climbing out of the

girl's pants and WAVING to her. Nearby FANS APPLAUD.

She begins unbuckling her belt so STU will have enough room to draw

Monkeybone's bottom half. STU demurs...

He wanders across the room, finds JULIE deep in conversation with a

bunch of other GUESTS, and pulls her aside.

He grabs her by the sleeve, pulls her across the floor to -

INT. ALCOVE - OFF LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

There's nothing "cool" about it - it's a stairway landing, with metal

fire doors that open onto the parking lot outside.

He opens one door and holds it for JULIE.

He gives up trying to explain...pulls her close and kisses her. For a

moment they completely forget about the party in the next room.

Then HERB appears behind them, trying to catch STU's eye as he waits for

the clinch to break up. Finally he pries them apart:

But before STU knows what's hit him, HERB is leading him back to -

INT. LOBBY - THAT MOMENT - CONTINUOUS

The MERCHANDISERS shoot STU an expectant wave. STU waves back and turns

in the opposite direction. HERB grabs him by the sleeve.

He nods toward JULIE, who's at the open bar grabbing two glasses of

punch. HERB realizes a proposal is in the works.

JULIE's over by the punchbowl. She sees the two boys staring at her

conspiratorially - MAKES A FACE at them as she waves back.

STU nods gravely.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

STU, JULIE, and HERB in the parking lot. A small safari of FLUNKIES is

loading enormous boxes full of MONKEYBONE JUNK into STU's beat-up car -

stuffed dolls, action figures, board games, lunchboxes, beach towels,

team jackets and more! STU groans at the sight of it...

STU GLOWERS at HERB as he opens the car door for JULIE.

INT. CAR - NIGHT - MOVING

STU backs out of his space. The small parking lot is full of DELIVERY

TRUCKS from would-be merchandisers - all too large for the spaces

they're parked in. STU has to keep backing up because the exit lanes are

blocked. It's like negotiating a labyrinth.

He says it so solemnly that she cracks up. After a moment he joins in.

EXT. PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

A PLASTIC BANNER stretches between two poles on either side of the entry

to the lot. It shows MONKEYBONE in a typical languorous pose:

TWO GUYS on EXTENSION LADDERS are taking the sign down as STU'S CAR

idles at the exit below. There's a strong wind tonight, and one guy

LOSES HOLD of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached...

INT. CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

As STU pulls into the intersection he sees a DELIVERY TRUCK approaching

in the opposite lane, with a cardboard likeness of MONKEYBONE mounted

atop the cab. He chuckles...

Suddenly his view of the street DISAPPEARS. The MONKEYBONE BANNER has

fallen DIRECTLY ACROSS HIS WINDSHIELD, like a huge SHROUD. All he can

see is a great, grinning MONKEY FACE!!

JULIE SCREAMS. STU SCREAMS. Unable to see, he slams on the brakes and

JERKS THE WHEEL RIGHT.

Off screen: HORNS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. The horrible crunch of METAL

ON METAL.

But Stu's car comes to a halt untouched. After a moment he opens his

eyes...and JULIE opens hers...

She thinks it over, nods. STU takes a moment to catch his breath, then

opens the door gingerly. A HORN BLARES as a car speeds past in the

opposite lane, nearly taking STU's door off. He jumps back inside,

waits, opens the door again...

EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT

His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene. The

asphalt is strewn with MONKEYBONE MERCHANDISE - stuffed dolls, games,

lunchboxes. SKID MARKS show where the TRUCK which was carrying all this

SWERVED...

...and slammed into the rear of a BUICK REGAL, pinning it up against a

TELEPHONE POLE. STU races up to the Buick. Its front end is mashed up

like an accordion, but the occupants - a couple of TEENAGERS dressed for

the prom - seem to be okay.

He spots a PHONE BOOTH and starts across the street. On the way there he

plucks a STUFFED MONKEYBONE DOLL off the pavement and CHOKES IT with

both hands.

JULIE stays behind with the prom kids. The TEENAGE BOY in his tux is

glassy-eyed, miserable beyond description.

The BOY begins to SOB softly. JULIE nods in sympathy.

Then: EVERYONE WINCES. The air is full of a horrible CREAKING noise,

like nails on a blackboard...

The horrible CREAKING NOISE continues. JULIE turns. Behind her, the

TELEPHONE POLE that the car slammed into is beginning to TEETER. Then it

TOPPLES. Directly toward...

ON STU - IN PHONE BOOTH

He sees JULIE running toward him and holds up a single finger.

Finally he glances up - just in time to see the TELEPHONE POLE coming

down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer. His eyes

widen. The STUFFED MONKEYBONE slips from his grasp...

CLOSEUP - MONKEYBONE

A HORRIBLE CRASH. SCREAMS. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the MONKEYBONE DOLL which

STU was holding, surrounded by broken glass, its face twisted into an

insane, almost macabre grin.

The screen fades to PITCH BLACK for a few seconds...until we hear a

DISTANT SIREN, and an IMAGE comes swimming into focus...

STU'S POV: ON JULIE

He's in the back of an ambulance, with PARAMEDICS all around him,

working feverishly. JULIE hovers above him, holding his hand.

All at once he seems to be RECEDING from JULIE and the others - as if

SINKING THROUGH the bottom of the stretcher, and BEYOND - through the

floor of the ambulance! JULIE's voice grows weaker, more distant:

And then all trace of the ambulance is gone, and he's floating down

through some strange LIMBO, surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing

SHROUDS, with the sound of BIRDS CALLING all around him...

An AWFUL MECHANICAL RATCHETING NOISE fills the soundtrack. STU's eyes

close - and when they reopen, he finds himself in:

EXT. TROLLEY - MOVING

A tiny ROLLER-COASTER CAR descends from dense clouds down the length of

an impossibly long and rickety METAL TRACK. The track leads through a

vast black VOID...

...to a tiny ISLAND floating in the darkness...an island that looks not

unlike a disembodied FIST.

And, as the car draws closer, the fist begins to OPEN - tulip-like -

turning into a HAND, with a full-sized TOWN nestled in its palm! In the

town, CARNIVAL LIGHTS begin to glitter. MUSIC begins to tinkle...

EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT

The car - a one-passenger job with a CARTOON ANIMAL FACE on its prow -

stops with a lurch. STU steps out onto a fog-shrouded TRAIN STATION

PLATFORM. Before he knows it, the little car DEPARTS behind him. He's

stranded - alone.

Off in the fog is a big wheeled CART with the sign: "PSYCHOLOGICAL

BAGGAGE CLAIM." There STU finds two SUITCASES and a BACKPACK. He

examines the TAGS. They all belong to him!

He sits on the edge of the cart, opens a SUITCASE, and pulls out...

As he gathers his bags, he hears odd SQUEAKS and CHITTERING...

A STRANGE FURRY CREATURE pops out from beneath the platform and yanks on

STU's pants leg. It looks like a raccoon, but it's FLAT - an animated

pelt. Before STU has time to let out a yell, a FLAT SNAKESKIN comes

slithering out from beneath the baggage cart...

STU looks down and sees a SQUASHED RABBIT humping his leg.

These bordertown types are known as ROADKILL, and they're sporting the

tire tracks to prove it. STU SCREAMS, shakes them off, and RUNS.

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

A long stone STAIRWAY leads to decorative wrought-iron GATES. SHADOWY

CARVED SPHINXES sit on either side. As STU races up the steps, a

sputtering NEON SIGN comes to life overhead:

A FANFARE BLOWS as the creaky gates begin to part. A SPOTLIGHT hits the

SPHINXES - and they COME TO LIFE! They rise up on their hind legs, put

on boater hats. One of them blows a note on a kazoo...

STU bolts THROUGH THE GATES, with the ROADKILL TRIO right on his heels.

The indignant SPHINXES exchange a look of outrage.

EXT. DARK TOWN - MIDWAY - NIGHT

It's a carny town, a tourist trap, seedy and nightmarish. Despite the

festive trappings, there's something off about it - an air of neglect

and decrepitude - as if they'd tried to turn Alcatraz into Disneyland,

and given up halfway through.

STU looks back and sees the ROADKILL gaining on him. He spots a small

group of OTHER HUMANS...

The humans just YAWN. They're COMA VICTIMS, just like STU. He ditches

one of his SUITCASES as the ROADKILL come after him.

He turns and spots a helpful-looking fellow in a COWBOY OUTFIT. The

COWBOY is in fact a CENTAUR - rider and mount rolled into one!

The characters who run this place - the BARKERS, TICKET-TAKERS, and RIDE

OPERATORS - are all weird HYBRIDS, part human, part ANIMAL. They could

be the ancient Gods of some primitive culture - reduced to working as

street entertainers in this ramshackle resort town.

STU pinballs down the street, bouncing from one shock to another:

Reduced to babbling hysteria, STU ducks into the nearest building. Above

the door, an ANIMATED NEON SIGN shows a happy boozer lifting his martini

glass, then falling over flat on his back, at which point his eyes are

replaced by the traditional cartoon X's. This is the COMA BAR.

INT. COMA BAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

STU bursts in, flattens himself against the wall as the ROADKILL skitter

past outside. He's given them the slip. He looks around.

The bar's a weird melange of styles. COMA VICTIMS ride around in

wheelchairs refurbished as BUMPER CARS, drinking cocktails from IV

bottler. A four-armed ELEPHANT GOD is at the Mighty Wurlitzer while a

MERMAID VOCALIST in a half-shell belts out the wistful lyrics of Johnny

Mercer's "DREAM." And over at the BAR...

Out of breath, STU edges toward the bar as the BARTENDER, BULL, turns

away to grab a fresh glass.

STU GAGS. BULL is a full-fledged MINOTAUR, body of a man, head of a

BULL. His features are CUBIST - weirdly squashed over to one side.

STU gives him a cockeyed look. BULL points to a MONITOR mounted over the

bar, on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot

through a great sticky SEA OF MOLASSES.

He changes channels with a remote. Now we see a guy falling through

midair, arms and legs flailing, falling, falling, falling...

Now a small muffled VOICE speaks from the area of STU'S BACKPACK:

STU claps both hands over his mouth to prove he's not the one talking.

BULL glowers at him, snorting STEAM out of both nostrils.

The ELEPHANT GOD from the Wurlitzer organ comes lumbering over.

BULL and JUMBO rear back to PUNCH STU'S LIGHTS OUT. He's saying his

prayers when his BACKPACK begins to BULGE and QUIVER - and a SMALL FURRY

BEAST pops out, CACKLING HIS HEAD OFF!!

BULL and JUMBO back off, STUNNED. The monkey grabs STU'S FACE and plants

a big wet SMOOCH right on his NOSE. STU SCREAMS.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON an EEG monitor. There's a sudden BLIP on the readout.

JULIE strokes STU's limp hand. He's COMATOSE, cocooned in a tangle of

wires and tubes. His head and shoulders are heavily bandaged. He's

hooked up to as much machinery as you can cram into one room.

INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

Dead on her feet, JULIE stumbles toward the exit. As she's leaving she

passes the WAITING ROOM -

She turns and sees an older colleague from work - ALICE - waiting in the

doorway. Hovering right behind ALICE is HERB. And behind him -

It appears that almost everyone in the waiting room is a friend of JULIE

and STU's. Disheveled and groggy, they rouse themselves and make their

way over to JULIE's side. She's overcome with emotion.

INT. STU & JULIE'S HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT

The sound of the key in the lock is met by INSANE BARKING. JULIE and

ALICE enter and are met by BUSTER, the pet basset - jumping and yipping

like crazy after 24 hours without food or human company.

ALICE kneels to play with the dog. She hears a sudden GASP from the

kitchen. JULIE is standing by the open refrigerator, wearing an

absolutely stricken expression...

INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

ALICE finds JULIE holding a bottle of champagne - Veuve Clicquot La

Grande Dame 1989 - all wrapped up in a bow and ribbon.

She bursts into tears. ALICE sits her down at the kitchen table and

takes the champagne from her.

INT. BATHROOM - LATER - NIGHT

A limp JULIE soaking in a steamy tub, one arm dangling over the side. On

the vanity is a framed PHOTO STRIP, four poses for a dollar. In the

first three, STU and JULIE are making outrageously goony faces. In the

fourth, they imitate the stern-faced farm couple from American Gothic.

She gazes at it for a long, long time. Eventually she smiles.

INT. SECOND BEDROOM/STUDIO - NIGHT

OPEN on two PHOTOS, mounted in a single frame. On the left, BUSTER

KEATON, droopy-eyed, in his familiar porkpie hat and vest. On the right,

a Photoshopped image of BUSTER THE BASSETT HOUND, in the same pose, also

wearing Keaton's hat and vest.

These photos are on the wall of the cramped room which serves as STU's

studio and JULIE's office. MONKEYBONE STRIPS are scattered across the

drafting table. ALICE is making up the sofa as a guest bed.

As she's hanging her coat in the closet she comes across an ACRYLIC

CANVAS in the back, stashed behind a battered portfolio and a box full

of spiral-bound sketchbooks. She pulls it out. She's obviously disturbed

by it, but she can't tear her eyes away...

She's still gaping at the painting when JULIE enters in a terrycloth

robe.

The canvas depicts a group of SURGEONS with the faces of wolves. They're

standing over a HUMAN PATIENT, replacing his internal organs with

MACHINE PARTS. The style is at once cartoony and unsettling.

ALICE's gaze goes from the nightmare paintings to the MONKEYBONE strips

tacked up over the drafting table.

A smile comes to JULIE's face. She settles in on the floor beside ALICE

and digs through the various portfolios until she comes up with a

quickie CARTOON on the back of a napkin - the prototype for...

JULIE smiles at the cartoon. She isn't telling.

INT. ICU - MORNING

JULIE, in her white lab coat, wanders through Intensive Care and finds a

WOMAN hunched over STU's bed, BAWLING HER EYES OUT.

KIMMY looks up. She's crying so much she can barely recognize JULIE.

JULIE turns to look at STU in the bed. The certain knowledge that he was

about to propose is like a knife in her heart. KIMMY feels bad as well,

having let the cat out of the bag, but before they can hash it out -

Cheery DR. EDELSTEIN enters. He shakes hands with the women, then checks

STU's readouts, making notations on his clipboard.

This remark sends a shiver down JULIE's spine, but she keeps silent.

No one says anything. But both women look at STU, and then at each

other, and everyone knows exactly where everyone else stands. JULIE has

a sinking feeling that STU is working on a 3-month deadline.

INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

A beauty pageant - shapely INGENUES in EVENING GOWNS being introduced by

an EMCEE with enormous teeth.

GEORGE is a pudgy shmoe with a small pencil mustache who's wearing

glasses, a necktie, and NOTHING ELSE. He steps forward, holding a

briefcase in front of his crotch, looking EXTREMELY MORTIFIED.

CAMERA PULLS BACK - and we realize we're in:

INT. COMA BAR - NIGHT

where BULL the BARTENDER and a number of PATRONS are watching GEORGE's

nightmare on the TV mounted over the bar.

Onscreen, NUDE GEORGE is sweating bullets. He has no idea what to say,

and the audience is beginning to laugh at him. In a desperate, feeble

attempt to buy time...he begins to SING.

In fact he goes into a little softshoe, keeping the briefcase poised

over his crotch. Unfortunately, THE CASE POPS OPEN, dumping frilly

LINGERIE all over the stage. The weeping GEORGE must crawl around on all

fours to retrieve it...

By now the onlookers at the bar are CRACKING UP. All except one - the

lonely, disconsolate fellow on the last stool, nursing a martini - STU.

He GRIMACES at MONKEYBONE, who's stretched out atop the mighty Wurlitzer

at the other end of the room. The MERMAID CHANTEUSE is singing a

Dietrich number, "The Laziest Gal in Town" - or at least trying to,

because MONKEYBONE is caterwauling behind her. By the time she gets to

the grand finale, he's practically BAYING AT THE MOON.

Pissed off, she SHAKES her FIST at MONKEYBONE and pulls the lid of her

clamshell SHUT. This suits MONKEYBONE just fine, as it leaves him alone

in the spotlight to soak up what little applause there is.

He gestures to JUMBO, the elephant organist, who begins to vamp.

JUMBO's tasteful vamping gives way to a RAUNCHY ROCK BEAT - and

MONKEYBONE begins STRUTTING across the top of the piano, bumping and

grinding and shaking his booty to the tune of -

MONKEYBONE sings the same poignant line over and over until STU comes

storming over from the bar and YANKS HIM off the Wurlitzer by the scruff

of his scrawny NECK.

A trouper to the end, MONKEYBONE WAVES at the crowd even as STU drags

him off to an empty table in the farthest corner of the room.

MONKEYBONE waves and winks at every female who passes by. STU whacks him

upside the head.

Cocktail waitress KITTY, a seven-foot cat-faced feline sex bomb, arrives

in her skimpy black dress and shows STU a Cheshire-cat grin. MONKEYBONE

reclines, Odalisque-style, on the table.

A softie at heart, KITTY sits across from STU and takes his hand.

She leans forward sympathetically. From this particular vantage,

MONKEYBONE has an unobstructed view of KITTY's cleavage. And so does STU

- although he's not quite as obvious about staring.

MONKEYBONE slinks over behind STU - up onto his shoulder - and whispers

into his ear:

KITTY is holding the cleavage pose for an unnaturally long time. Her

furry tail begins to swing back and forth playfully in the air. It's

hypnotic - like a windshield wiper.

STU stares at it. MONKEYBONE stares at it. And MONKEYBONE'S TAIL

responds by straightening...stiffening...bending upward slightly.

STU is suddenly aware of something LONG, RED, and WET unrolling onto his

shoulder. It's a TONGUE...dangling out of MONKEYBONE'S OPEN MOUTH. STU

lets out a YOWL OF SHOCK.

Blushing bright red, he GRABS THE TONGUE and shoves it manually back

into the monkey mouth whence it came.

STU LUNGES at MONKEYBONE - who JUMPS OVER HIM, BOUNDS off the edge of

the table, and grabs hold of a CHANDELIER.

STU grabs a CHAIR and swings it at the chandelier. MONKEYBONE makes a

series of SUBMARINE NOISES -

- and DIVES - directly between KITTY's breasts into her skimpy black

dress!! STU circles around KITTY, following the undulating monkey-sized

BLOB that's tunnelling around under her dress. Finally MONKEYBONE pops

out of the BACK of the dress and NUZZLES KITTY'S EAR:

MONKEYBONE runs under the pool table. STU is giving chase when -

suddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind.

EVERYONE IN THE BAR freezes in place.

For there, in the doorway, is a looming, ominous figure - the most

dreaded figure in all of Dark Town -

- a GRIM REAPER, nine feet tall and swinging a scythe, come to take some

hapless coma victim to the land of Death!

EERIE WINDS WHISTLE and the shroud FLUTTERS in the night breeze as the

REAPER looks from face to face. For a moment he focuses on STU. STU

backs away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread...and

MONKEYBONE jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully.

But the REAPER moves on - past each COMA VICTIM in turn - finally

STOPPING in front of a TINY, WIZENED, PRUNELIKE OLD GENT in a

wheelchair, who looks to be 110 years old at least.

GASPS OF ANTICIPATION all around the room as the REAPER hands EARL a

long white ENVELOPE. EARL opens it slowly and removes...

...an oversized rectangular TICKET...the size of a Hershey bar, made of

SOLID GOLD, with the letter "E" stamped upon it.

VARIOUS CHARACTERS around the barroom react, in hushed voices:

EARL throws his crutches aside, jumps out of his chair, and DANCES A

JIG, waving the ticket over his head. STU stares at him with naked envy.

EARL does an end-zone dance toward the door. One by one, OTHER PATRONS

get up from their seats to watch EARL's departure.

EXT. COMA BAR - STREETS - NIGHT

The COMA VICTIMS shuffle toward a BIG RIDE across the midway.

It's a "TEST YOUR STRENGTH" machine - the kind where you slam down a

mallet and try to ring the bell. It's surrounded by crocodile moats and

storm fences and electrified barbed wire, and a big sign reading PRIVATE

- NO ADMITTANCE.

EARL, still jubilant, inserts his E-ticket into a receptacle at the

entrance. A DRAWBRIDGE LOWERS, and CAROUSEL MUSIC cranks up, and

CARNIVAL LIGHTS blink on, and FIREWORKS rocket into the sky...

All around them, faces turn skyward. CLOUDS are parting. An EDDY of

swirling colors is forming DIRECTLY ABOVE the E-ticket ride - and a

PINPOINT HOLE opens up at its center.

The "TEST YOUR STRENGTH" machine has been outfitted with a SEAT where

the bell-ringer should be. Once EARL has settled in, a GIANT MECHANICAL

MAN lifts its enormous mallet...

...and SLAMS IT DOWN on the lever end of the machine, sending EARL

ROCKETING UPWARD toward the hole in the sky. DING!! The SEAT hits the

BELL, but EARL keeps going - up - up - UP...

Then, with a distinct POP, he's gone. Over the rainbow...home.

STU marches across the street to the GRIM REAPER - who's climbing onto

his WINGED BICYCLE and seems shocked that anyone would want to chat with

him. MONKEYBONE scurries alongside, terrified.

MONKEYBONE practically swoons. But the REAPER just stares at STU:

The REAPER climbs onto his winged bike and PEDALS OFF down the midway.

STU lets out a HOWL OF FRUSTRATION.

STU BOOTS MONKEYBONE aside. They're at a GAME STALL manned by Elsie the

Cow - the one where you throw baseballs at milk bottles. STU picks up a

baseball and HURLS IT at the departing REAPER.

The ball hits the REAPER smack on the head, knocking him off his bike!

MONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them.

But STU isn't intimidated. He grabs another ball and winds up.

The REAPER, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF as

the ball whizzes past. STU starts chasing after him!

The REAPER turns down a side street and pedals up an incline - one of

the "fingers" of the hand that holds Dark Town. When the bike hits the

end of the finger, it TAKES OFF into the void and KEEPS ON GOING.

The REAPER vanishes. STU sits dejectedly on the edge of the curb.

Just then, a multi-armed MESSENGER BOY in royal livery toodles past on a

CHILD'S SCOOTER. He stops...

STU looks up. Six arms reach into six pockets. Finally the MESSENGER

finds an ENVELOPE and hands it over. Inside is an ENGRAVED INVITATION:

STU'S EYES widen with excitement as the MESSENGER scoots off.

INT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - MORNING

As she's done every morning for the last three months, JULIE brushes

STU'S TEETH. Although she looks a bit more worn and haggard than when we

saw her last, she always affects a cheerful manner around STU - on the

off chance that he might be aware of her presence.

She packs the toothbrush away, runs a hand along his stubbly cheek.

She opens up the entertainment section of the daily newspaper.

She refolds the paper and reaches into a bedside drawer for a paperback

entitled The Book of Raunch. She pages through it for a moment.

She whacks him on the arm with the book. No response at all.

The sound of SOBBING interrupts her joke. She looks up and sees KIMMY

standing in the doorway, red-eyed and crying.

JULIE just stares at her for a beat or two, refusing to understand. Then

it sinks in. Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief.

EXT. HYPNOSPIRE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS up the seemingly endless length of the HYPNOSPIRE - up,

up, THROUGH a heavy layer of clouds, to the ROTATING PENTHOUSE DOME of

the building...

...which is festooned with oodles of 18-INCH DSS SATELLITE DISHES.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT

ELEVATOR DOORS open, and we glide into the swank, swingin', space-age

bachelor pad of HYPNOS, God of Sleep. A giant flying CUPID welcomes us,

tiny bumblebee wings somehow keeping his vast bulk aloft.

HYP'S HIDEAWAY occupies the entire penthouse floor, and there's always a

party in full effect. A rotating disco ball flashes colored light on

walls, floors, and ceilings covered with shockadelic OP-ART PATTERNS.

Of course, a party needs party animals - and the DARKTOWNERS on the

scene are in fine fettle, working up a sweat on the dance floor. DJ

SLEEPY ZZZ'S has three turntables spinning at once.

As STU wanders through, he gets a big surprise. Reproductions of his old

NIGHTMARE PAINTINGS are hanging on the walls! They've been turned into

ONE-SHEETS for the coming attractions at the Morpheum.

Scowling at each other, the boys turn their backs and part ways. We

follow MONKEYBONE to the wet bar, where he almost immediately bumps into

a statuesque GORGON with a full head of writhing SNAKES.

He grins and shrugs: what the hell. As they head for a back room, the

BARTENDER hands him a SNAKEBITE KIT.

A look of apprehension crosses MONKEYBONE's face. But before he can

change his mind, the GORGON'S HAND yanks him out of frame.

STU, meanwhile, is crossing the dance floor, moving among glittering

animal-people who DANCE in their bizarre, uninhibited way. A FIVE-LEGGED

WOMAN - the bottom half of her body a big human HAND - SMILES at STU as

he passes. He tries to talk to her, but she's dancing, and with five

constantly moving legs it's difficult to get in close.

STU grins meekly, nods yes. She pulls him over to dance.

JUMBO the ELEPHANT GOD is dancing in ungainly fashion nearby. His trunk

swings out and hits one of the HAND WOMAN'S arms - which SNAPS OFF like

marble statuary. Before she can let out a squeal, he does it again. Now

she's armless - a regular Venus de Milo!

She leads him over to the sunken living room. Among the other guests, we

see a CYCLOPS, a YETI, a BBQ PIG. A number of sofas and lounge chairs

are arranged around a big crystal ORB in the center of the room.

The ORB is where nightmares happen. Although the perspective shifts and

the locales change abruptly, as in a movie, all the nightmares have a

3-D quality - as if they're taking place right here in the room with us!

STU grins in anticipation. He finds an empty chair and starts to sit

down - but there's a SLUG with a MAN'S HEAD already in it!

STU picks another seat. The HAND WOMAN sidles up alongside him.

EXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB)

In long shot we see a handsome young couple dressed in paisley prints.

Emerging from a sylvan glade, they kiss in golden sunlight. Then the MAN

breaks free - sprints through knee-high sunflowers to the middle of the

field, where a picnic blanket is waiting.

CLOSEUP - STU

HIS FACE GOES PALE as he recognizes the man in the paisley shirt.

EXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY

Paisley-shirted STU pours champagne for two. Toasts his beloved - who

is, of course, JULIE, the dreamer of the dream.

He pulls out a little velvet RING BOX and offers it to her. But when she

tries to take it, he pulls it away, teasing her, and STEALS A KISS.

Suddenly the two of them are locked in a tight embrace, rolling together

through the flowers, LAUGHING, full of joy.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

The DARKTOWNERS are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of

horrors to come. STU looks from one misshapen face to the next, his

heart pounding with dread.

EXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY

JULIE rolls onto her back on the grass, FACE AGLOW. Only to realize...

that STU IS NO LONGER THERE BESIDE HER.

She looks around. Gets to her feet. Turns. And the BACKGROUND behind her

MORPHS suddenly into...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB)

The room is decorated for a FAREWELL PARTY, complete with streamers and

confetti. KIMMY, DR. EDELSTEIN, various MEDICAL PERSONNEL and FRIENDS

are wearing party hats, lifting champagne glasses in a toast to the

guest of honor...the comatose Stu!

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

The DARKTOWNERS clustered around the orb can barely conceal their animal

excitement. It's obvious that the nightmares they're watching are more

than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive, visceral

charge from the spectacle of human terror.

He tries to push his way forward to the orb. An angry CYCLOPS elbows him

aside. A YETI grabs his coat and pushes him out of the way.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB)

COMATOSE STU stands in the center of the room, UPRIGHT and IMMOBILE in a

party hat. A weird UMBILICAL CORD extends from his navel to a huge

groaning BELLOWS DEVICE - like an artificial lung, it's all that keeps

him breathing.

EDELSTEIN hands a pair of OVERSIZED CEREMONIAL SCISSORS to KIMMY, and

she CUTS THE CORD, as if opening a new mall. Applause all around. JULIE

races toward STU in slo-mo, SHRIEKING -

- as he DEFLATES into a LIMP PUDDLE OF FLESH before her eyes!!

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - ON STU

JULIE's distress is killing him. Yet all around him, DARKTOWNERS are

cackling their heads off, growling, howling, punching their fists in the

air like rowdy drunks at a football game. He LOSES IT ALTOGETHER.

He won't be stopped this time. He makes for the orb - climbing over

sofas, pushing guests aside, knocking over their drinks -

Somehow, JULIE has heard him!! Down in the nightmare orb, her dream self

is looking UP, trying to locate the source of STU's disembodied voice!

He struggles to reach the orb, but the CYCLOPS is holding him back.

STU breaks free and FLINGS HIMSELF on the ORB - which SHORTS OUT in a

haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare. JULIE's image

vanishes - and STU gropes at the air, DESPAIRING.

INT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

The real JULIE awakens suddenly and lets out a scream of her own.

Only now does she realize where she is. She's fallen asleep in the

visitor's chair next to STU's bed. The clock on the wall reads 1:15 AM.

STU'S READOUTS are spiking like crazy.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

STU is being dragged across the dance floor by the YETI and JUMBO THE

ELEPHANT GOD. HAND WOMAN brings up the rear.

But just then a hush falls over the room, and someone screams...

A WALL PANEL does a 180-degree turn, and a CIRCULAR BED rotates into the

room. Languishing atop it, garbed in a silk robe which exactly matches

the black & white checkerboard pattern of the bedspread...

...is a CHUBBY, GRINNING, SLEEPY-EYED SATYR, with horns and hooves. TWO

WASP WOMEN are with him on the bed, brushing his furry goat legs and

feeding him grapes.

As STU fights his way over, he sees an odd LUMP wriggling under the

bedcovers. Out pops MONKEYBONE, clutching a bottle of champagne!

He shakes the bottle, pops the cork, and SPRAYS SPURTING BUBBLY at

HYPNOS, the GIRLS, and everyone else within firing range!

Hilarity all around. STU snatches MONKEYBONE off the bed -

A vaguely embarrassed look crosses HYPNOS's face. All the nearby

DARKTOWNERS stare at their shoes, clear their throats.

With a brusque gesture, HYPNOS sends the party girls packing. He slings

one arm around STU's shoulder and pulls him aside.

STU EXPLODES WITH JOY. He practically dances a jig.

One by one, the celebrants turn their backs and slink discreetly away.

MONKEYBONE's jaw drops. He slaps himself across the forehead.

MONKEYBONE marches back and forth across the bed, wearing a dimwit's

expression as he MOCKS STU in a singsongy voice...

STU grabs the monkey and clamps a hand over his mouth.

In checking his watch, STU removes his hand from MONKEYBONE's mouth. The

singsong resumes...

HYP shuts up. Looks around the room, as if he's afraid of being

overheard. Then he gestures to the boys to join him on the bed.

They climb aboard eagerly. HYPNOS hits his remote...

INT. HYPNOS'S BEDROOM - ON BED

...and they rotate AWAY from the party. Privacy at last.

HYP hits the remote. The bed begins to ROTATE OUTWARD again.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - A MOMENT LATER

HYP gives the boys a wink and a thumbs-up, then wanders off to shmooze

his other guests. MONKEYBONE shakes STU's hand.

He turns and stalks off. MONKEYBONE stands there blinking.

Stunned, MONKEYBONE scurries along behind him, PLEADING.

As if in reply, a PALE, SPECTRAL PRESENCE comes drifting across the

dance floor - an eight-foot-tall GRIM REAPER.

The boys duck behind a POTTED PLANT to watch as he zeroes in on the WET

BAR - where a beautiful coma victim, LULU, is drunkenly making out with

another sloshed corpse-to-be, FRED.

LULU doesn't notice. She continues grappling with FRED. Muttering, the

REAPER dives in and tries to disentangle them.

She ditches FRED and throws her arms around the REAPER. Repulsed, he

pushes her away, props her against the nearest wall -

- and TOUCHES HER with one bony finger above the heart! It's like

throwing a switch. Her body stiffens. Her EYES cross. Her TONGUE droops

out of her mouth. She makes a noise like a DIAL TONE.

The true horror of death is that it makes you look like a total idiot.

The REAPER pulls a collapsible HAND TRUCK from beneath his shroud and

starts maneuvering LULU onto it.

The REAPER ignores him. FRED holds up a cocktail glass.

The REAPER heaves a sigh and takes the cocktail glass. FRED grabs a

pitcher filled with some luminescent tropical concoction...

...and POURS IT down the REAPER's front!

ON STU AND MONKEYBONE - BEHIND THE PLANT

WINCING at the REAPER in his sopping wet, pink-stained shroud.

The REAPER wrings out his shroud and grabs the hand truck. As he wheels

LULU past the boys, MONKEYBONE pops up with a helpful hint:

STU claps a hand over MB's mouth as the REAPER turns down a hall.

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

The still-muttering REAPER wheels LULU toward the entrance to Dark Town.

The boys are skulking along behind him at a discreet distance.

The REAPER approaches the GATES. He presses a remote-control BEEPER and

the meshing teeth of the gates slide back far enough to let him pass

through.

STU realizes they've only got an instant to make their move. He DIVES

through the gates at top speed. As soon as he's on the other side, he

hears a nasty CLANG behind him...

MONKEYBONE is caught - his body contorted like a pretzel, woven in and

out among the meshing teeth! STU gives him a good hard YANK, and he

slips out like a strand of fettuccine.

They hear RUMBLING on the tracks outside. A CAR is arriving!

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

The REAPER loads LULU into the little roller-coaster and climbs aboard.

The car begins to move. STU and MONKEYBONE get there just in time to

jump onto the LUGGAGE RACK in the back!

ON ROLLER-COASTER - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

They peep over the back of the car at the REAPER and wonder what to do

next. MONKEYBONE spies a TOOL KIT mounted under the rack - opens it, and

pulls out a big, nasty MONKEYWRENCH.

The boys nod in agreement. MONKEYBONE clambers over the back of the car

and hoists the wrench. STU covers his eyes. WHANG!

STU looks up - sees a confused MONKEYBONE alone in the car with LULU.

Now he clambers into the car as well.

There's no trace of the REAPER - except for a rumpled shroud, a

wristwatch, and a St. Christopher's medal on the floor of the car. The

boys exchange a puzzled shrug. MONKEYBONE tries on the watch.

INT. SLEEP LAB - PRE-DAWN

The wall clock says it's not quite 3 AM, yet JULIE has managed to round

up all her co-workers: ALICE, HUTCH, CLARISSA, et al. They're groggy,

disheveled, un-made-up, unshaven. But they're there.

She points to a series of EASELS where HUTCH and ALICE have been tacking

up EEG printouts, engram maps, etc.

The lower chart shows a JAGGED SPIKE virtually identical to the one on

the upper chart. JULIE pauses for effect - then pulls on the edge of the

lower chart, OPENING IT UP like a gatefold -

The onlookers GASP. Opened accordion-style, the lower chart shows the

SAME SPIKE recurring again and again, TEN TIMES OVER!

The group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky. JULIE claps her hands:

As the group swings into action, HUTCH pulls JULIE aside.

INT. LAND OF DEATH - NIGHT

A PANORAMIC VIEW of an impossibly grand, Gilded-Age TRAIN STATION. A

central turntable is the hub for dozens of TUNNELS, which converge like

the spokes of a wheel, disgorging long trains full of DEAD PASSENGERS

from all over the world.

Far above, in the dizzying reaches of the vaulted DOME that crowns the

station, REAPERS on FLYING BICYCLES spiral about like mosquitos,

bringing dead souls to their final reward.

This is Thanatopolis - land of Death - truly the end of the line.

A WET SQUEEGEE scrapes across the frame - wielded by a GRIM REAPER in a

jumpsuit bearing the logo of "LAND OF DEATH WINDOW WASHERS, INC." The

noise is irritating, so a REAPER on the inside snaps the venetian blinds

shut, cutting off our view.

CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we realize we've been seeing all this through the

wall-to-wall windows of...

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

It looks like the observation bridge in the nose of the Nautilus; the

decor is ornate, and the office equipment - vacuum tubes, pipe

intercoms, etc. - is on loan from the Jules Verne Museum of Defunct

Technology.

REAPERS are bustling about everywhere. One of them pushing a HAND TRUCK

laden with oversized crates bearing the label "DEAD SOULS."

He unloads the crates in a corner of the room, where SCORES of crated

souls are already piled up.

We can't see DEATH himself - just the back of a tall swivel chair. With

much creaking, it rotates around - bringing us face-to-face with...

CLOSEUP - DEATH

He's not at all what you'd expect. He's a chubby-cheeked, bespectacled

ACCOUNTANT TYPE...a harried bureaucrat, just trying to do his job.

There's something sweet, almost avuncular about him.

There's an open crate of DEAD SOULS on his desk. Dead souls take the

form of PERFORATED PAPER DOLLS...two-dimensional, underwear-clad,

usually wearing expressions of shock. DEATH pulls a sheet from the box,

detaches the dead soul, and outfits it with a cut-out TOGA.

Now he places it in a big diorama - with OODLES of toga-clad souls

staring up at a scale model of an active volcano. He throws a switch and

BEAMS as the volcano spits BLOBS OF KETCHUP into the air.

DEATH, grumbling, digs into the box and pulls out another soul. His eyes

light up. He clutches the sheet with trembling hands.

Sure enough, the doll on the sheet is Ol' Blue Eyes. DEATH digs in a

desk drawer and pulls out a SHOEBOX DIORAMA...DINO and SAMMY standing at

microphones, with a third, center mike conspicuously open.

Grumpy, DEATH shoves FRANK, DEAN, and SAMMY back in the drawer.

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

A FLUNKY opens the office door, and a long line of REAPERS glides in.

DEATH lugs an enormous musty leather-bound BOOK over to a long table. He

snaps his fingers and WHISTLES.

His pet HELLHOUND - a tiny plump weiner dog, with a HORNED DEATH'S HEAD

for a face, comes skittering across the office floor and jumps into his

lap. Meanwhile, the ASSISTANT turns on a chugging, card-shuffling UNIVAC

COMPUTER, which spits out a length of TICKERTAPE.

DEATH checks the name against the master list in his big ledger. He

pulls out a document and puts his STAMP on it - the DEATH WARRANT. This

he gives to the REAPER at the head of the line.

As the line moves along, we notice an odd-looking REAPER nearing the

desk. His gait is wobbly. His head bobs independently of the rest of his

body. There's a big, luminescent STAIN on the front of his shroud.

EVERYONE FREEZES as DEATH points a bony finger DIRECTLY AT the wobbly

REAPER with the iridescent stain.

TWO VOICES come out from under the shroud at once:

Much COUGHING and THROAT-CLEARING from under the shroud. By now DEATH'S

LAPDOG is GROWLING at the STAINED REAPER, and DEATH can't hear what

anyone is saying. He shushes the dog.

The little hellhound YIPS VICIOUSLY. DEATH whacks him on the rump.

A loud chorus of "A WWWWW's" from the disappointed REAPERS. DEATH stamps

the word "REPRIEVE" on Clarke's warrant.

His ASSISTANT crosses the room. In the far wall is a steel-reinforced

VAULT DOOR with a hydraulic wheel - the kind you see at banks. The

ASSISTANT dials in a combination, turns the wheel, laboriously pulls the

door open and STEPS INSIDE...

...returning, a moment later, with a priceless gold E-TICKET!!

The UPPER HALF of the STAINED REAPER begins to gyrate wildly.

CLOSEUP - ON STU - UNDER THE SHROUD

MONKEYBONE is doing an agitated TAP DANCE on his head. His TAIL whips

repeatedly across STU'S FACE.

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - BACK TO SCENE

The REAPER in front of the boys stares at the E-ticket, crestfallen.

The ASSISTANT hands the REAPER a YELLOW MAILMAN'S POUCH containing the

E-ticket. But before he can depart, the STAINED REAPER - aka STU and

MONKEYBONE - jumps to the front of the line.

DEATH is stunned by this unprecedented breach of protocol. The other

REAPERS in the line are ABUZZ.

CLOSEUP - ON STU - UNDER SHROUD

An ENRAGED STU is yanking on MONKEYBONE'S TAIL, signalling him to shut

up. MONKEYBONE, in pain, squeals repeatedly. Finally he reaches down and

PUNCHES STU IN THE NOSE.

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - BACK TO SCENE

The blow sends STU staggering. DEATH and the other REAPERS look on in

astonishment as the STAINED REAPER does a bizarre DANCE across the

floor, top half and bottom half moving independently. Miraculously, he

manages to right himself and regain his balance.

He stands and gestures toward a side room. The boys follow. The little

HELLHOUND scampers out from behind the desk...

...and GRABS THE HEM OF THEIR SHROUD in its teeth! The boys keep on

walking, but the shroud stays behind. Somehow they go three or four

steps before they realize they've been exposed.

DEATH jumps a foot in the air and SHRIEKS. PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS.

The boys back toward the big WINDOW overlooking the trainyard. The

REAPERS close in on them, BRANDISHING THEIR SCYTHES.

With a SCREECH, MONKEYBONE LEAPS into the air, BOUNDS OVER the heads and

shoulders of the advancing REAPERS, and SNATCHES the yellow E-ticket

pouch from the guy Death gave it to.

He bounds over a table and into STU's arms, with the precious pouch in

hand! DEATH lets out a great rattling BELLOW OF RAGE.

His features begin to JITTER VIOLENTLY. HIS HEAD EXPLODES!!!

Nothing to lose at this point. With a CRASH, the boys DIVE THROUGH THE

BIG WINDOW overlooking the trainyard!

The headless DEATH gropes around blindly, waving to his ASSISTANT.

The ASSISTANT opens a cabinet containing a half-dozen identical HEADS.

He pulls out a spare and screws it onto DEATH's neck.

EXT. TRAINYARD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The boys land hard at the edge of the trainyard. Behind them, REAPERS

are shepherding a line of newly arrived DEAD PEOPLE past a sign which

reads: "PROCESSING - THIS WAY."

By the time they can dust themselves off, an ALARM starts blaring.

REAPERS drop what they're doing, point at the boys. Panic time!

Nearby, a FLYING BICYCLE is propped up against a SIGN. Side-by-side they

race toward the bike, each of them clutching the strap of the pouch,

YANKING each other back and forth in a tug-of-war.

STU's bigger. He pulls the pouch onto his shoulder, and MONKEYBONE with

it. They grab the bike, climb aboard, and pedal off -

- revealing the SIGN it was leaning against: "CYCLE REPAIR."

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON BICYCLE - THAT MOMENT

STU pedals onto the central turntable area. The BATWINGS on the rear of

the bike flap feebly, but the flying bike just won't fly.

MONKEYBONE looks over his shoulder. A small ARMY of REAPERS, anned with

scythes, is pouring into the trainyard behind them.

MONKEYBONE fiddles with the ignition switch. A BLACK CLOUD OF EXHAUST

belches violently from the rear of the bike, almost pitching them off

their seat. The batwings start to flap faster...

SPUT. BLAP. The engine BACKFIRES and DIES. STU fiddles with the switch,

but it's no go.

LULU is still sitting in her little car at the edge of the tracks, eyes

crossed, mouth agape. MONKEYBONE waves brightly. Then a mob of REAPERS

appears on either side of LULU's car, swarming out onto the tracks! STU

starts pedaling for his life.

He makes for the TRAIN TUNNELS in the far wall of the station.

ILLUMINATED SIGNS over the tunnels read: Calcutta...Hong Kong...Waco, TX

...and directly ahead...

Dark Town!! By now they're well out onto the turnaround. STU pedals

frantically, BOUNCING over tracks and ties. MONKEYBONE bites his

fingernails down to the quick as he watches the column of REAPERS

pursuing them onto the tracks.

INT. OFFICE - ON DEATH

watching through a crooked spyglass as the boys pedal down the tracks.

Petting his hellhound, he reaches for a WALL SWITCH.

EXT. TRAINYARD - HIGH ANGLE

The boys are almost at the Dark Town tunnel. The REAPERS, on foot, will

never be able to catch them. But as they pick up speed for the stretch

run, the GROUND begins to move beneath them!

DEATH has activated the TRAIN TURNAROUND - the rotating platform at the

end of the line which allows an engine to reverse direction. Before they

know it, they're doing a full 180!

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON BICYCLE

The boys continue to bounce down the tracks - but the tunnel entrances

seem to be SPINNING before their eyes. Before they know it, they're

pedaling directly TOWARD the mob of ANGRY REAPERS!!

STU jerks the handlebars HARD RIGHT and JUMPS THE TRACK he's on. He

WINCES IN PAIN as the bike BOUNCES over a series of rails...

EXT. TRAINYARD - HIGH ANGLE

The REAPERS are SPREADING OUT around the turntable - encircling it! STU

rides around the periphery of the great turning platter, but there's no

getting off. They're completely surrounded!

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON BICYCLE

MONKEYBONE covers both eyes and wails in fear. But STU is rattling the

ignition switch, making ONE LAST EFFORT to get the bike aloft...

THE ENGINE CATCHES. Trailing black fumes, the BICYCLE RISES! The REAPERS

converge in its path, and RAISE THEIR SCYTHES...

But the bike JUST MANAGES TO CLEAR the tangle of scythes - leaving the

REAPERS slicing at empty air!

INT. OFFICE - ON DEATH

Through the big window, he sees the boys leveling off, flying toward the

DARK TOWN TUNNEL. They're moments away from a clean escape.

INT. STU'S ROOM - NIGHT

STU's readout monitors are registering frantic nightmare activity when

JULIE and ALICE enter. JULIE sets her purse on STU's bedside table -

removes a SYRINGE and a test tube filled with PURPLISH FLUID.

CLOSEUP - DEATH

He unlocks a RED SECURITY BOX on his wall. Inside is a TOGGLE SWITCH

labelled "FATE WORSE THAN DEATH." He flips it...

CLOSEUP - THE SYRINGE

The plunger goes down, injecting fluid into STU...

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON FLYING BIKE

MONKEYBONE is sitting on STU's shoulder, facing backward, thumbing his

nose at the REAPERS. STU glances back as well, laughing, unable to

believe his own good luck.

Since they're both looking the wrong way, neither of them sees the

sheer, monolithic WALL rising up DIRECTLY IN THEIR PATH.

It's no ordinary wall. It's STU'S PAINTING - the one ALICE found in the

closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period -

- and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT, it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING

STU against the ground underneath!

STU'S DREAMSCAPE

No bike. No monkey. Just STU - who finds himself on an operating table,

with the world of the painting coming to 3-D life around him. The WOLF-

FACED SURGEONS are closing in on him, baring their fangs, brandishing

their scalpels and their metallic REPLACEMENT PARTS...

Suddenly the fabric of this weird reality TEARS - just like a rip in a

canvas. A FURRY PAW reaches through - GRABS STU by the hand...

EXT. TRAINYARD - JUST OUTSIDE TUNNEL

MONKEYBONE PULLS STU through the rip in the back of the giant toppled

canvas. The bike's there waiting. They hop aboard and pedal off INTO THE

DARK TOWN TUNNEL a split-second before the REAPERS arrive to slice them

to ribbons.

INT. DARK TOWN TUNNEL - ON BICYCLE

STU pedals so hard his heart is about to burst. He feels down at his

side - the yellow pouch containing the E-ticket is still there. The

REAPERS are clustered at the mouth of the tunnel, but they aren't

following.

The boys WEEP WITH GLEE. It's a miracle - they've cheated Death!

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

An exhausted STU huffs and puffs as he pedals the bike up the last

stretch of track to the platform outside the gates. He climbs off the

bike and stares back - it looks like the last thousand miles or so have

all been uphill. He slings the YELLOW POUCH over his shoulder...

The gates slide open. STU passes through. But MONKEYBONE lingers behind

a moment - just long enough for one of the SINGING SPHINXES to slip him

a big, nasty BASEBALL BAT.

He turns - and MONKEYBONE MARK McGWIRES HIM upside the head! STU

crumples in a heap...

Laughing maniacally, MONKEYBONE STEALS the E-TICKET and goes RACING OFF

DOWN THE MIDWAY!!

STU'S HEAD is swimming. It takes him a few seconds, but he gets to his

feet. By now, MONKEYBONE is halfway to the E-ticket ride. Worse yet,

STU'S WATCH reads 8:59 AM!!!

EXT. DARK TOWN PLAZA - NIGHT

The STREETS ARE LINED with Darktowners ROOTING MONKEYBONE ON as if he's

the hometown favorite in a big footrace. Which he is.

MONKEYBONE reaches the E-TICKET RIDE - drops his E-TICKET into the

receptacle at the gate. The drawbridge lowers...

As STU sprints down the street, the SNAIL MAN oozes into his path - and

TRIPS HIM! Before he can get up, cackling DARKTOWNERS converge on him -

forcing him back to the ground and HOLDING HIM THERE.

EXT. E-TICKET RIDE - ON MONKEYBONE

The familiar miasma of COLORS is beginning to swirl in the night sky

overhead. MONKEYBONE straps on a NEEDLE-TIPPED HELMET which makes him

look like a simian DART. Then he climbs into the seat of the TEST-YOUR-

STRENGTH machine and braces himself for the big ride!

EXT. DARK TOWN PLAZA - THAT MOMENT - RIGHT

ONLOOKERS APPLAUD as the robot lifts its mallet and LETS FLY. DING!! The

tiny figure of MONKEYBONE soars toward the swirling colors. His DART-

HELMET strikes the black hole dead center.

STU WATCHES HELPLESSLY as MONKEYBONE penetrates the veil of the sky and

VANISHES. He's still SCREAMING when the cackling DARKTOWNERS drag him

out of the plaza by the heels...

AERIAL SHOT - ON MONKEYBONE

ROCKETING UPWARD through the clouds in his dart-helmet, a look of SHEER

EXHILARATION on his simian face. Somewhere a CLOCK begins to chime the

hour...

INT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - 8:59 AM - DAY

MOST OF OUR CAST is either in STU's room or in the hallway outside.

PLUS we've got a man of the cloth; two LEGAL TYPES, with briefcases; and

several of the NURSES from the facility.

ALICE squeezes JULIE's hand, and JULIE squeezes STU's. The minute hand

on the clock hits twelve. KIMMY, sobbing into a handkerchief, gives DR.

EDELSTEIN the nod. As he reaches for the power switch...

JULIE DROPS the hand with a gasp. The DOCTOR jumps half a foot.

All at once STU is sitting BOLT UPRIGHT IN BED...shaking his head and

feeling around gingerly under the bedclothes, as if something VERY SHARP

has just poked him in the ass.

KIMMY sighs and FAINTS DEAD AWAY.

STU blinks and looks about the room, disoriented. It could be because

he's just come out of a coma after seven months. Or it could be because

he's a MONKEY unaccustomed to hanging out in a human body.

A BURST OF LAUGHTER from the others in the room. Weeping TEARS OF JOY,

JULIE flings herself across the bed and hugs him tight.

While JULIE is hugging him, STU is checking out his new fingers and

toes, RUBBING his sparse patch of CHEST FUR. DOCTORS and NURSES look on

in amazement from the doorway.

STU is almost oblivious to JULIE. He lifts up the sheet, sneaks a quick

peek at his CROTCH, and grins delightedly.

JULIE gives him another kiss, WHISPERS in his ear:

What she doesn't know is that, although he still looks like STU, his

body is now occupied by MONKEYBONE. Since he's now a hybrid character,

man on the outside and monkey within, let's call him...

INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

A damp, stonewalled VAULT with a barred door. STU is sprawled on the

floor, OUT COLD, when a VOICE awakes him...

STU comes around just in time to see a PANEL sliding open in the ceiling

far overhead. A torrent of JUNK - stale popcorn, half-eaten candy bars,

molten ice cream pops, and sticky soda - rains down ON HIS FACE.

A horde of DARK FIGURES emerge from the shadowy catacombs around him.

All at once, HANDS are grabbing at him from all directions. STU lets out

a SCREAM - backs up against a wall -

A MONGOL WARRIOR with a droopy mustache looks up at him.

After a moment STU realizes that the DARK FIGURES have almost no

interest in him - instead, they've been grabbing at the half-eaten

SNACKS that cascaded down onto his head. A long-haired SLAV - RASPUTIN -

dives on a Hershey bar with only one bite out of it, but an oddly

familiar FAT MAN gets there first. STU gapes at him...

He offers STU a box of popcorn soaked in Dr. Pepper.

Various OTHERS emerge from the shadows to shake STU's hand.

As if in reply, a FANFARE sounds in the distance...

INT. DUNGEON - ENTRANCE

A RAT GUARD stands at attention by the door, TOOTING HIS KAZOO to

announce the arrival of an honored guest.

As HYPNOS passes, the DUNGEON DWELLERS race up to the WALL OF BARS that

separates the entry area from the dungeon proper.

STU LUNGES at HYPNOS - who backs up just out of reach.

STU's face goes white as he realizes the point of the master plan.

HYPNOS marches off, chuckling. STU's head sinks into his hands.

EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

STU's back from the hospital. JULIE is removing his bags from the trunk

of KIMMY's car while STU and KIMMY chat in the front seat.

He climbs out. KIMMY is so rattled that she smacks bumpers with the car

parked in front of her. She PEELS OUT with the hand brake still on.

INT. STU & JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

STU-BONE and JULIE enter with luggage. He stands there for a moment

scoping out the unfamiliar surroundings. She sets the bags down, taps

him on the shoulder.

STU-BONE grins insipidly. She kisses him, pulls him into a tight embrace

- and then, overwhelmed by emotion, begins to SOB.

She gives him an extremely puzzled look.

She goes into the kitchen as STU-BONE plops onto the sofa. He spies a

bowl of FRESH FRUIT on the coffee table and immediately tries to pick up

a banana with his FOOT.

But he can't. He's got shoes on. Frowning, he unties his shoe, peels off

his sock. His bare foot is in the fruit bowl when JULIE returns from the

kitchen with a TRAY holding a chocolate cake and the bottle of CHAMPAGNE

Stu bought three months ago. The cake bears the message "WELCOME HOME -

I LOVE YOU" in pink icing.

She sits beside him with the goodies. He removes his foot from the bowl,

crosses his legs, WIGGLES HIS TOES at her. She smiles uncertainly. Then

she opens the bottle of champagne and pours two flutes full.

She finishes pouring, hands a flute to STU-BONE. His face is smeared

with CAKE and ICING. He's scooped out a big fistful and crammed it right

into his pie hole. He GRINS at her.

Then: we hear TINY NAILS skittering across the hardwood floors at high

speed. And BUSTER THE DOG races into the living room!

STU-BONE tenses instinctively. The dog is yipping, wagging his tail

insanely at the sight of his long-lost master - until he gets just a

little bit closer, and senses that something is very, very wrong.

BUSTER sizes STU-BONE up and GROWLS. STU-BONE bares his teeth and

HISSES. The dog LUNGES - and STU-BONE jumps up on the sofa!

He bends down, snatches up the cake, and CRADLES IT under one arm as he

KICKS AT BUSTER from the sofa.

The frazzled JULIE pours herself another jolt of champagne - a stiff

one.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

SOUNDS of JULIE taking a shower in the adjacent bathroom o.s.

STU-BONE is sprawled in bed, pillows propped up behind him, flipping

channels on the bedroom TV with his trusty remote. The Discovery Channel

happens to be showing a Jane Goodall special...

Onscreen a FEMALE GORILLA is presenting her furry haunches to an ALPHA

MALE.

STU-BONE watches this erotic spectacle with a connoisseur's eye. He

glances over at the open bathroom door and catches a teasing glimpse of

JULIE'S SHADOW as she steps out of the shower and pulls on a robe. He

SCRATCHES and SNIFFS, just to put himself in the mood.

On TV: MONKEY FOREPLAY, which consists of a pounce from behind.

STU-BONE mutes the nature special and sneaks up behind JULIE just as she

emerges from the bathroom in her robe and towel-turban.

She tries to pass, but he grabs the belt of her robe and spins her

around. He delicately unwraps the turban, then opens her robe and pulls

it closed around the two of them. They kiss...

STU-BONE almost lets out a gasp of shock. What does she mean???

STU-BONE does a take. The good news is, she doesn't suspect. The bad

news is, he's apparently named after his creator's penis.

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

All at once the air is full of Barry White's lush baritone on the

bedroom CD player. Through the bedroom doorway we see STU-BONE and JULIE

waltzing romantically, belly to belly, still wrapped up in the single

robe.

The only jarring note is BUSTER'S FRANTIC BARKING. The poor dog is stuck

behind an accordion gate in the hall, going crazy, trying to warn his

mistress about the imposter in STU's body. The dog is almost drowning

out Barry White -

- so STU-BONE stops kissing JULIE long enough to reach over with one

foot and KICK THE DOOR SHUT.

INT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

JULIE watches from the bed as STU-BONE begins peeling off his PJ's,

going into a bizarrely formalized MONKEY MATING DANCE. He circles back

and forth from one side of the bed to the other, making faces, grunting,

FEINTING at her occasionally.

JULIE has some dim sense that this ritual is supposed to be erotic, but

in fact, it's making her damned nervous. She finds herself scrunching up

on the bed, trying to keep out of STU-BONE's way.

Now he LEAPS UP onto the foot of the bed. REARS BACK. And with an animal

howl of triumph, POUNCES AT JULIE!

Terrified, she rolls out of the way. STU-BONE'S SKULL slams into the

headboard.

Dazed, he sits up. He tries to stand, but his rubbery legs give way, and

he pitches over - CRACKING HIS SKULL AGAIN on the nightstand.

EXT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

JULIE helps a punchdrunk, staggering STU to the stairway.

As they pass, BUSTER lets out a little growl of satisfaction from behind

his gate. HOLD ON THE DOG's satisfied expression as STU-BONE loses his

balance and topples down the stairs O.S.

INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

RASPUTIN, ATILLA, JACK THE RIPPER and STEPHEN KING are engrossed in

their weekly Parcheesi game. STU is clinging to the bars, bemoaning his

fate.

TYPHOID MARY runs past, GIGGLING, pursued by a huffing HITCHCOCK.

KAZOOS SOUND. The RAT GUARD appears to announce:

At the sight of STU behind bars, she breaks down CRYING.

The RAT GUARD pushes STU back with a prod. KITTY reaches out...

As she gazes at him, love struck, the overhead PANEL opens and a deluge

of CRUD from the Morpheum lands directly on STU.

KITTY BAWLS inconsolably as the RAT GUARD leads her away.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

STU-BONE in pajamas and a head bandage, reading the morning funnies. He

pounds the table, practically WEEPING with hilarity at the MONKEYBONE

COMIC STRIP.

JULIE grins, plants a goodbye smooch on his forehead, and exits. He

waits a minute, then reaches for the PHONE.

INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

The house is crawling with PRESS. There must be three dozen REPORTERS

and PHOTOGRAPHERS and TV CREWS hanging on STUBONE's every pronouncement.

The front door opens. A stunned JULIE pushes her way inside...

He pulls her to his side for a photo op. FLASHBULBS go off.

He pauses for a photo op with MIKE CACHUELA and MIKE MITCHELL.

INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

JULIE squeezes through the crowd, finds HERB working the phone.

HERB holds up a finger. He's too busy talking. STU-BONE enters with the

video crew in tow. JULIE somehow manages to sideline him.

EXT. STREET - DAY

SUPERCHARGED POP MUSIC underneath as STU-BONE comes running around a

corner - followed, a moment later, by a SCREAMING HORDE of BEAUTIFUL

GROUPIES in black miniskirts and high heels. It's like something out of

A Hard Day's Night, only more so.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

TIGHT on STU-BONE, head still bandaged, eyes closed, SNORING slightly.

He wears a big monkey grin as he DREAMS the above.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A CARLOAD OF SUPERMODELS. They kill their engine in the middle of a busy

intersection and climb out to join the mob chasing STU-BONE.

He cuts around a corner, ducks into an alley, and FLATTENS HIMSELF

behind a dumpster. As the girls run past, he pulls out a handkerchief

and MOPS SWEAT from his brow.

Then, with a what-the-hell twinkle, he steps out and FLINGS HIS SWEATY

HANKIE into the midst of the GROUPIES. A CATFIGHT ensues as they

scramble after this precious memento. The chase resumes.

Suddenly he realizes he's SLOWING DOWN...running in SLO-MO. Same deal

with the girls on his trail. After a moment, he FREEZES. He can't move

anything except his EYES; he looks right, left, up, down...

...and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of

him! HYPNOS is perfectly capable of moving. He strolls right up to the

frozen STU-BONE and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY, Moe Howard-style.

STU-BONE tries to speak. All that comes out is a slo-mo DRAWL.

He winds up - throws a ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH at STU-BONE'S FACE.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

STU-BONE sits up suddenly in bed. For a moment he's relieved - it was

all a dream. Then he realizes his FACE is swelling like a

prizefighter's. His front tooth is loose. BLOOD is streaming from his

nose!

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

He's awake, fully dressed, and fishing around in the pocket of JULIE's

topcoat. He finds her KEY RING and tiptoes furtively to the front door.

INT. SLEEP LAB - NIGHT

He unlocks the door and enters the darkened lab. Finds the dispensary

area and kneels beside a LOCKED REFRIGERATOR. Then he shuffles through

the keys on the ring until he finds one labelled "FRIDGE."

On the top shelf is a corked beaker of purple fluid bearing the label

"ONEIRIX" with red DANGER stickers all over it. STU-BONE takes it out,

flashes a sinister grin, and EMPTIES ITS CONTENTS into a similar beaker.

Then he refills the original from a hip flask and replaces it.

He's just about to leave when he's startled by a series of SIMIAN GRUNTS

and SQUEAKS - which are TRANSLATED in SUBTITLE:

He turns and spots a SEDUCTIVE FEMALE BABOON who's confmed to a CAGE in

the corner. The conversation continues in MONKEY TALK.

He pulls out a MATCHBOOK and scribbles a number on it.

A LIGHT goes on suddenly in the outside hallway! STU-BONE tries to dive

for cover, but the FEMALE BABOON grabs him by the belt and pulls him

against the cage.

Startled, he drops the ONEIRIX BEAKER - which rolls out into the hall!

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The beaker CLATTERS LOUDLY as it rolls through the lab door. STU-BONE'S

HANDS grope through the doorway - but the FEMALE BABOON has got him by

the pants leg and won't let go, no matter how much he rattles the cage.

He can't quite pull himself through the door...

He unbuckles the belt. UNZIPS HIS PANTS. Keeps clawing toward the

beaker. But he still can't quite make it, and the BABOON won't let go.

Now his pants are down around his knees. He keeps wriggling until his

pants legs are entirely INSIDE OUT - and still he can't quite reach the

beaker! His shoes are caught in his pants cuffs! RRRRRIPPPPP...

Freedom! Minus his pants, he GRABS THE BEAKER.

In FG through all this is a dim teenage JANITOR pushing his electric

floor polisher. He has his Walkman on and he can't hear any of the

mayhem behind him. He sings along atonally with the music:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

A disheveled STU-BONE, back from his secret mission, is trying to take

his clothes off so he won't wake JULIE. But she starts to rouse, so he

jumps into bed fully dressed and pulls up the covers.

She pulls the covers back. He's still wearing his topcoat, shoes, socks,

and shorts...but NO PANTS.

He pulls the covers up to his chin. The two of them lie there in the

dark staring up at the ceiling.

INT. STU'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The entire Monkeybone brain trust has come to visit: HERB, syndicate

head MR. BOWERS, and several CORPORATE REPS hoping to arrange tie-in

deals. Host STU-BONE has started to take on a simian look: more

prominent ears, flared nostrils, heavy beard stubble, etc.

The BURGER GOD REP sets a tray of FAST FOOD in front of STU-BONE - the

packaging all covered with angelic haloed Monkeybones.

STU-BONE takes a bite out of his Monkeyburger - looks pleased at first -

then begins PICKING something out of his teeth.

STU-BONE immediately signs the contract and shakes hands with the BURGER

GOD REP. HERB consults his agenda.

The TOY REP sets a LOCKBOX on the table. A stencil on the box reads "TOP

SECRET." He pulls out a key and opens it to reveal...

...a tuxedoed, collector's-edition MONKEYBONE DOLL lying on a bed of

CRUSHED PURPLE VELVET. He carefully removes the treasure from its chest.

Its right hand is hinged. The doll's thumb is UP ITS REAR.

STU-BONE stares at the doll - cautiously yanks its thumb out. We go to

SLO-MO as the rising arm causes a NOXIOUS AEROSOL SPRAY to shoot out of

Monkeybone's ass!

And we STAY in slo-mo as STU-BONE stares at the doll in wonderment and

awe...a man in looooove.

Still in slo-mo, the EXECS crack up, gag, hold their noses at the awful

stank of it. STU-BONE is the only one not laughing. He reaches out to

touch the doll - to fondle it adoringly -

- and suddenly we're back to REAL-TIME.

He breaks into RIOTOUS LAUGHTER and begins blasting monkeyfarts at HERB

and the EXECS, who dive for cover under the conference table.

EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

Laughter and back-slapping as STU-BONE walks his guests to their cars.

With a big grin, he pantomimes sticking a thumb up his ass, in obvious

imitation of the doll, and then gives the thumbs-up sign. The unnerved

EXECS gape at him as he goes back inside - he's developed an odd, loping

gait, and his arms swing outward in wide arcs as he walks.

INT. STU'S KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

He digs around under the sink, finds the purple beaker of ONEIRIX. Looks

at the FARTING DOLL...and GRINS.

INSERT - TV SCREEN

A PROMO for the MONKEYBONE cartoon show. MONKEYBONE swings across the

screen on a vine, followed by a string of grinning, live-action FANS

doing a scratch 'n' sniff, pull-out-a-plum LINE DANCE.

INT. LIVING ROOM - REVERSE ANGLE - NIGHT

A distraught JULIE mutes the TV. Her friend ALICE is on the sofa beside

her, having coffee and dessert.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

TIGHT ON the flask of ONEIRIX as STU-BONE picks it up.

He's wearing a GAS MASK. He's rigged a CLOTHESLINE in the garage.

MONKEYBONE DOLLS are clipped to it, ass-end up - forming a makeshift

ASSEMBLY LINE. He dips a TURKEY BASTER into the flask...withdraws a

quantity of purple fluid...plucks the FINGER out of the first doll's

behind...

- and plunges the TURKEY BASTER into the doll's hindquarters, filling it

with ONEIRIX!! The doll's buttocks take on the purple hue characteristic

of Orangutans in heat. STU-BONE holds the doll at arm's length and pulls

its finger - launching a purple puff of SPIKED NIGHTMARE GAS.

EXT. GARAGE/BACK YARD - NIGHT

STU-BONE steps out into the driveway and hears a low growl - BUSTER is

giving him the stinkeye from behind the picket fence. STU-BONE's eyes

light up with inspiration.

INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

LOUD BARKING outside. JULIE wanders over toward the window.

JULIE lifts the curtain - and sees STU-BONE in his gas mask, bent over

in a weird crab like stance, chasing BUSTER around the yard with the

Monkeybone doll.

JULIE doesn't seem especially surprised - but ALICE's mouth falls open.

EXT. BACK YARD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

BUSTER is apparently ALONE now - he's pacing in circles under a HIGH

TREE BRANCH, staring up and GROWLING. Someone throws a PINE CONE at the

picket fence. BUSTER'S HEAD TURNS, just for an instant -

- and STU-BONE plunges out of the tree, DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE DOG! The

two of them GRAPPLE, rolling around on the grass.

For a moment it looks like this battle royale could go either way. Then

STU-BONE gets on top of BUSTER, STRADDLES HIM, shoves the ASS of the

Monkeybone doll up against his muzzle...

FOONT! A purple cloud of NIGHTMARE GAS hits BUSTER in the face. The dog

goes limp. His eyes roll back in his head. He starts to TWITCH.

Disheveled but triumphant, STU-BONE stands up, pounds his chest with

both fists, and lets out a Tarzanian ROAR. Lights go on all over the

neighborhood. ANGRY NEIGHBORS poke their heads out the windows.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

STU-BONE skulks back into the garage. He throws back a tarp, revealing

HUNDREDS of boxed Monkeybone dolls, stacked so high they fill an entire

wall of the garage. He pulls out his turkey baster, cranks up the

clothesline, and goes to work.

EXT. BACK YARD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS IN on the twitching face of BUSTER, and we see

BUSTER'S DREAM (BLACK & WHITE)

A German-expressionist nightmare, all low angles and heavy shadows.

We're in some kind of OPERATING ROOM, where a struggling PATIENT is

being wheeled in on a tall, creaking GURNEY. Four ORDERLIES in surgical

masks are holding him down.

The PATIENT is BUSTER. And the ORDERLIES...are CATS.

A CAT SURGEON draws the sheet back. Looks at the spreadeagled BUSTER.

And brandishes a big nasty pair of GARDEN SHEARS.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The Dark Town audience is scratching its collective head at Buster's

dream, which is showing in one of HYP'S NIGHTMARE ORBS. An angry HYPNOS

slams down the phone and storms across the dance floor to his big

circular bed.

A FELINE BEAUTY embraces him from behind, pulls him onto the bed.

She draws ONE SHARP CLAW lightly down his chest. He gives her a now-

you're-talkin' grin and hits a switch - causing the big circular bed to

ROTATE off the dance floor and into the boudoir.

As it turns, we see KITTY'S PAW closing discreetly around a KEY CHAIN on

the nightstand...

INT. DUNGEON - RIGHT

STU's curled up on the dank floor when he's awakened by the sound of a

VISITOR in the corridor outside - KITTY. She passes a sack containing

FOOD and BOTTLED WATER through the bars - and SHUSHES the astonished STU

before he can speak.

Glancing back at the GUARDS, she pulls a KEY from her cleavage.

She turns down the corridor. STU stands there for a beat, GAPING at the

key in his hand.

Then he hears the sound of CARNAGE outside. A FEROCIOUS, BLOODY BATTLE

seems to be underway. Realizing that KITTY must be in trouble, he uses

the key to unlock the dungeon door.

INT. DUNGEON - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

He finds KITTY hunched in the corner on all fours, surrounded by blood

and tufts of fur and an abandoned GUARD'S HAT.

She looks up at him, feline eyes aglow. There's a three-foot-long

RODENT'S TAIL dangling out of her mouth.

He races off as KITTY resumes her feast. The sound of fighting has

roused the other DUNGEON DWELLERS, and when they realize the dungeon

door is open they come rushing out en masse.

Then the PANEL opens. They hear FOOD raining down behind them. HITCHCOCK

is the first to turn back - then STEPHEN KING - then ATILLA. A moment

later they're back to their old habits, climbing over one another to get

at a half-empty box of Raisinets.

INT. SLEEP LAB - DAY

The usual gang sitting around at their computer terminals, etc. JULIE is

coolly reading NOTEBOOK ENTRIES into a TAPE RECORDER.

DEAD SILENCE from the mortified group. They never had a case like that

at Johns Hopkins. JULIE somehow keeps a stiff upper lip - deeply

embarrassed for STU, but a scientist nonetheless.

The others all GLOWER at HUTCH for this egregious display of bad taste.

EXT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON

STU-BONE and HERB are standing outside the garage in formal attire as a

crew of ZOO WORKERS load MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a pickup.

HERB wonders if this is a joke, decides it is, and forces a chuckle.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

JULIE is getting dressed for the benefit when the PHONE RINGS.

INTERCUT - JULIE AND HUTCH

HUTCH is at the sleep lab, standing over the open refrigerator.

Her eyes move to the WINDOW - to STU-BONE out by the garage.

INT. SLEEP LAB - LATE AFTERNOON

Two DETECTIVES examining the scene of the crime.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

LIVERIED WAITERS scurrying all about in preparation for the benefit. ZOO

WORKERS set up tables and chairs underneath a giant CANOPY.

STU-BONE watches with satisfaction as the last of the DOLLS is loaded

into a giant pinata in the shape of STANLEY.

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The big creaky swivel chair swings around, revealing DEATH.

The party he's addressing is STU - who's stretched out horizontally,

strapped to a medieval TORTURE RACK, with a whole posse of GRIM REAPERS

standing guard around him.

DEATH gestures for the REAPERS to unshackle STU.

DEATH rears back and KICKS HIM, full-force, SMACK IN THE ASS. The

supernatural might of the blow sends STU ROCKETING UPWARD THROUGH THE

CEILING!!

INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY

A TEAM OF SURGEONS. The lead SURGEON has his arm buried up to the elbow

in the open torso of an ORGAN DONOR.

SCREAMS ALL AROUND as the ORGAN DONOR sits BOLT UPRIGHT! The startled

SURGEON drops the kidney back into place.

The ORGAN DONOR grabs a lab coat from a nearby rack and races out. (And

since STU is temporarily occupying the DONOR's body, we will henceforth

refer to him as O.D. STU.)

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER

O.D. STU comes racing around a corridor. His LAB COAT is already covered

with gore, and he's having trouble holding his GUTS in. His PANCREAS

spills out onto the floor just as two DOCTORS stroll past.

The DOCTORS move on. O.D. STU spots a JANITOR'S CART with a roll of DUCT

TAPE on one shelf. He WRAPS IT TIGHTLY around his midsection to keep his

innards from falling out. Then he runs for it.

Now the TEAM OF SURGEONS rounds the corner in hot pursuit. The lead

SURGEON spots O.D. STU at the end of the corridor and takes off after

him. But he SLIPS on the PANCREAS and goes sprawling!

The pancreas goes flying down the hall, where it gets SQUASHED in rapid

succession by a GURNEY and by a little old lady's MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIR.

When the SURGEONS retrieve it, it's a hunk of pulp.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

GUESTS are beginning to arrive for the benefit. In the cages and

habitats, animals stare up at a gigantic MONKEYBONE BALLOON.

EXT. ZOO - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

The BAZOOM TOY REP is rounding a corner when HERB pops out from behind a

tree and BLASTS HIM with a jolt of purple gas from a Monkeybone doll! He

sputters and coughs...

Then he grabs the doll away and blasts HERB right back! The two of them

chase each other around the tree, giggling. The BAZOOM REP'S WIFE, in

her formal gown, affects a look of supreme mortification.

EXT. STU'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

O.D. STU climbs over the fence, finds a hidden key, and lets himself in.

INT. HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY

O.D. STU rushes frantically from room to room.

No reply - the joint's empty. O.D. STU enters the studio and spots a

NEWSPAPER on his drafting table. The paper is folded back to a big

DISPLAY AD for the benefit: "MEET STU MILEY AND MONKEYBONE - 8 PM

TONIGHT!" He checks the wall clock: time is short.

Reaching into the drawer of the drafting table, he pulls out a TACKLE

BOX which contains old brushes...and a small VELVET BOX. O.D. STU opens

the velvet box to reveal Grandma's ANTIQUE RING.

He hears GROWLING behind him - it's BUSTER. The dog looks up, cocks his

head - and begins WAGGING HIS TAIL. Somehow, even though STU's in a

different body, BUSTER recognizes him.

EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

O.D. STU exits, ring in hand. Behind him, BUSTER is throwing a fit -

barking, FLINGING himself at the screen door. He wants to come along!

A BUS pulls up at the corner, and O.D. STU boards it. BUSTER throws

everything he's got at the door - and it gives! He takes off after STU.

EXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY

As HERB is walking toward the refreshment table, an ODD LOOK crosses his

face. All at once he begins to TUG at his collar. He yanks his TIE off

...doffs his JACKET onto the pavement...

POV HERB - PSYCHO-VISION

The nightmare drug is kicking in! The whole zoo SWIMS around him. All at

once he's being ATTACKED...by a HORDE of EMPTY CLOTHES!!

EXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY

JULIE has arrived at the zoo. She's wandering zombie-like through the

food court, flanked by her friends ALICE and CLARISSA.

All of a sudden, they hear SHOUTS and LAUGHTER from the area of the

reptile house. In the distance, ZOO SECURITY GUARDS are chasing a NAKED

MAN through the crowds of formally-dressed partygoers.

The GUARDS catch hold of HERB and drag him away past JULIE, ALICE, and

CLARISSA. He doesn't recognize any of them. He's PSYCHOTIC:

The three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR.

INT. MUNI BUS - LATE AFTERNOON

PASSENGERS are holding their noses, frantically pulling on the BELL ROPE

to alert the driver that they want off. As we move toward the back we

see O.D. STU sitting alone, with rows of empty seats on either side.

He looks rough. He's bone-white, his taped-up lab coat is crusted with

blood, and he never did find any shoes. Also, it's a hot night and he's

starting to get a little ripe. FLIES are buzzing all around him.

EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT

BUSTER runs down the sidewalk as fast as his stumpy little legs will

carry him, in pursuit of the BUS.

INT. CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

The team of SURGEONS has been tracking O.D. STU across the city! Through

the windshield they see the BUS pulling up outside the zoo. O.D. STU

hops out and sprints across the parking lot.

INT. ZOO - ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON

O.D. STU doesn't even stop at the ticket window. He VAULTS over the

turnstile, knocking benefit guests aside. The SURGEONS aren't far

behind. They race up to the ticket window -

The TICKET-TAKER shrugs and points off in O.D. STU's direction.

INT. BANQUET TENT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

The last stages of dinner. WAITERS are already clearing plates, and

although JULIE has barely touched her food she sends her plate away.

Onstage a BAND is playing tasteful zoo jazz. When the number ends, STU-

BONE approaches the dais and leans into the mike.

JULIE stands reluctantly. The CROWD APPLAUDS.

A DISCO BALL lowers. STU-BONE turns to welcome a group of BACKUP SOUL

SINGERS who are just joining the band on stage.

The TENT begins to ROCK with a throbbing beat. And STU-BONE launches

into a wild-eyed, hip-shaking parody of Mick Jagger singing the Rolling

Stones' "MONKEY MAN"!

As he sings, STU-BONE gyrates over toward JULIE, bumping and grinding

like the cartoon-monkey sex machine he is. He waves his mike to the

crowd, urging everyone to join in. JULIE gasps in disbelief, but the

crowd is eating it up - clapping and singing along with STU-BONE.

He gestures for pretty women to join him out on the floor. He opens his

shirt at the neck, exposing a hitherto unseen plenitude of chest hair.

He pulls out a hanky to mop his brow and tosses it to the crowd. He

wipes his armpits with a second hanky and tosses it to the crowd. He

blows his nose into a third and tosses it to the crowd.

Then he JUMPS UP ON THE TABLES and shakes his booty wildly, strutting in

and out among the dessert plates. If the real Jagger could see him, he

would creep home a sad and broken man.

For the big finale, he jumps off the table and SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR

to JULIE'S table - arriving ON HIS KNEES.

He pulls out a RING BOX and hands it to the beet-red JULIE. The crowd

lets out a collective GASP - followed by WILD APPLAUSE.

She stares down at the ring - a big vulgar sparkler. She can't speak.

No reply. She's taking a long time to say yes. The audience is

muttering.

Suddenly a GORE-STAINED FIGURE bursts into the tent.

JULIE's jaw drops. She barely gets a glimpse of O.D. STU before the ZOO

GUARDS arrive to haul him away.

- which STU-BONE never does. Someone in the crowd yells...

STU-BONE turns and does a simian COMEDY SHTICK for the crowd.

By the time he's done scratching his ribs, JULIE has vanished!

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

She races out of the tent - grabs a passing ZOO GUARD.

The GUARD points to an ANIMAL CONTROL VAN. JULIE sees O.D. STU peering

out through a small barred panel. Their eyes meet...

JULIE digests this, nods professionally, and turns to walk away.

This stops JULIE cold. Her spine is tingling. She turns slowly, a single

tear rolling down her cheek. And then...

The dog runs right past JULIE and bounds up to the animal control van,

barking his head off. Now JULIE is starting to believe. She turns -

THROUGH THE BARS he hands her the little box containing Grandma's

antique ring.

She slips the ring on her finger - looks up at O.D. STU with TEARS

WELLING in her eyes. He makes an odd SNORKELING kind of noise.

JULIE TURNS. The two DETECTIVES we saw in the sleep lab have just

arrived at the gate, and ALICE and CLARISSA are leading them over.

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - PINATA AREA - THAT MOMENT

The PARTYGOERS are lined up under the gigantic Stanley-shaped PINATA,

which is hanging from a tree. A TUBBY BANKER in a blindfold takes a good

hard whack. CRACKS are beginning to appear...

The next contestant is a GORGEOUS WOMAN. He blindfolds her and embraces

her from behind to help her with her grip on the bat.

Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in

tow. He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE -

- and catches a BAT IN THE FACE. Several people rush up to help him as

the COPS consult with the BENEFIT ORGANIZERS...

O.D. STU comes marching through the crowd. He passes a LIFE-SIZED

DISPLAY of Stanley and Monkeybone...GRABS THE BACKPACK off the Stanley

figure...and proceeds deliberately toward STU-BONE.

The old command seems to retain its magical power, because STU-BONE

clutches his gut as if stricken at the sound of it.

STU-BONE bends over - jerks and twitches - becoming more SIMIAN by the

moment as O.D. STU approaches.

The COPS are tres confused by all this -

- but JULIE holds them back so the scene can play itself out. Now STU-

BONE is doing a weird little monkey dance - PLAYING UP to the puzzled

crowd, who laugh and snicker, wondering what to make of all this.

He turns suddenly - GRABS THE BAT from the puzzled BABE -

He wails on the pinata like Ken Griffey Jr. O.D. STU tries to stop him,

but it's too late - the pinata BURSTS, and hundreds of PURPLE-ASSED

MONKEYBONE DOLLS spill out onto the ground!

An equal number of RABID PARTYGOERS surge forward to scoop them up. The

COPS swing into action, trying to hold the crowd back...

STU-BONE climbs a tree and JUMPS from a branch onto one of the TWIN

JUNGLE TOWERS at the pavilion - begins CLIMBING toward the giant

MONKEYBONE BALLOON moored up above!

O.D. STU sees him - pulls away from JULIE -

STU-BONE unties the mooring rope and wraps it around his midsection. Now

freed, the balloon LIFTS INTO THE AIR, CARRYING HIM ALOFT!

O.D. STU climbs up the opposite tower as the balloon starts to drift

away. He GRABS HOLD of the MOORING ROPE as it whips past.

And the TEAM OF SURGEONS - who have been combing the grounds in search

of O.D. STU - catch sight of him just as he FLOATS OFF INTO THE AIR, ON

THE END OF THE ROPE!

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - ON BALLOON - MOVING

They rise to an altitude of ten or twelve feet. But O.D. STU's

additional weight pulls the balloon back DOWN - and both of them hit the

ground! They have to RUN at top speed just to keep pace with the

balloon!

As he's trying to KICK O.D. STU off the rope, a GUST OF WIND catches the

balloon and LIFTS IT HIGH INTO THE AIR.

For about three seconds. The boys tumble to earth, off-balance, in a

heap, BOUNCING along the pavement. The balloon pulls them over a

WROUGHT-IRON FENCE and drags them through the ALLIGATOR PIT. Giant jaws

snap as the boys glide overhead like bait on a hook.

As the balloon LIFTS UP AGAIN, O.D. STU hauls himself along the length

of the rope.

He gets close enough to GRAB STU-BONE's LEG. STU-BONE reaches down to

push him away...grabs a fistful of DUCT TAPE...

...and RIP! The tape TEARS - exposing the great big GASH in O.D. STU's

midsection! He tries to pull himself together...

EXT. FOOD COURT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

A SERVER ladles out a cup of PUNCH from a big silver PUNCHBOWL.

Something PINK comes plummeting out of the sky - and the next thing he

knows, the SERVER is DRENCHED!

The SURGEONS come rushing up. They all stick their hands in the

punchbowl at once...fishing out O.D. STU'S KIDNEY!

One of the TEAM finds an ice cooler full of soft drinks. In it goes.

EXT. TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

BOTH BOYS SCREAM as the balloon drags them perilously close to the RAZOR

WIRE atop a tall storm fence.

They clear it by inches - but they don't have much time to celebrate.

They're dangling over the Bengal Tiger exhibit, and the great cats are

LEAPING INTO THE AIR trying to snag them!

As O.D. STU squirms out of reach, his LIVER drops out...

EXT. GROUNDS - TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

It lands close enough to the FENCE that one of the SURGEONS thinks he

can reach it. He reaches through the bars and sees a pack of BENGAL

TIGERS racing toward him! He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but

a TIGER gets the other end -

- and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending

the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars! The

HEAD SURGEON examines the remaining half-liver...

ANGLE ON BALLOON

STU-BONE socks O.D. STU hard across the face! He lets go of his incision

...and his SMALL INTESTINE falls out! Since it's still connected at both

ends, the intestine forms a great big LOOP...

EXT. FOOD COURT - SERVING TABLE - LATE AFTERNOON

The SERVER has just brought out a new PUNCHBOWL full of nice clean

punch. He sets it down on the table and is about to ladle out a cupful

when STU flies past overhead. His intestinal LOOP slides across the

table, knocking over glasses, snagging the PUNCHBOWL at its base...

...and YANKING IT right off the table! Bystanding GUESTS are DRENCHED in

punch as the punch bowl FLIES END OVER END...

...and, with the sound of a GONG being struck, BEANS a member of the

SURGICAL TEAM from behind!! Naturally it's the guy who's lugging the ICE

CHEST full of O.D. STU's organs. When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES

DOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest...

... at a pair of COPS who are over by the pinata, loading CONFISCATED

MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART. The ICE CHEST knocks them off

their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill!

The COPS try to get up, but they skid every which way on the SPILLED ICE

underneath. On top of which, the SURGICAL TEAM is all over them, playing

GRAB-ASS with the COPS as they try to retrieve precious organs.

The HEAD SURGEON kneels beside his fallen comrade, the guy who got

BEANED by the punchbowl, and feels for a pulse.

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

COPS sprint downhill, trying to intercept the runaway SHOPPING CART full

of confiscated dolls. Too late. The CART slams into a fence and goes

ass-over-teakettle, dumping its contents into the PENGUIN HABITAT...

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

HYPNOS and an audience of DARKTOWNERS peer into the nightmare orb. They

see a Keystone-Cops vision of fur-clad ESKIMOS, with clubs and

spearguns, amid a colony of terrified PENGUINS.

AERIAL SHOT - STU'S POV - MOVING

STU gets an idea as he looks down at his dangling INTESTINE. He begins

FEEDING IT OUT - giving himself more rope to work with - and when it's

long enough, begins SWINGING IT like a LASSO!

EXT. WATER BUFFALO HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

WATER BUFFALO graze Buddha-like as STU'S INTESTINE snags one of them

around the HORNS. The lasso draws taut - and holds!

ANGLE ON BALLOON - O.D. STU AND STU-BONE

The balloon is moored in place again! O.D. STU pulls himself upward,

toward STU-BONE, who KICKS AT him frantically!

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

A COP pulls his sidearm and TAKES AIM at the now-stabilized balloon.

ANGLE ON BALLOON - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

BLAM! The cop's shot hits the giant MONKEYBONE BALLOON smack in the ass.

With a gale-force helium FART, the balloon ZOOMS UPWARD. The INTESTINE

snaps. STU-BONE and O.D. STU shoot off into the air!

ON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - AERIAL

AT APOGEE. They exchange a LOOK as the last gasp of helium hisses out of

the gigantic balloon. Then it occurs to them to look DOWN...

THEIR POV - PARKING LOT - OVERHEAD ANGLE

...at the tiny CARS parked far, far below. They must be close to a

hundred feet up in the air - and all at once the ground is coming up

fast!

EXT. ZOO - ON JULIE & CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON

JULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward.

ON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - FALLING

...and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the

parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud.

Their BODIES have stopped - but their SPIRITS keep on falling...

AERIAL SHOT - SKIES OVER DARK TOWN - NIGHT

...and the fight continues - even into the afterlife! As they plummet

down through the heavens, they REVERT to their true personae. It's STU

vs. MONKEYBONE, creator vs. sidekick, still duking it out - like a

couple of skydivers fighting over a single parachute!

EXT. STREETS - DARK TOWN - RIGHT

DARKTOWNERS pour into the streets to watch the epic struggle overhead.

They're placing bets, rooting their favorites on. Then...

THE GROUND SHAKES AND THUNDERS - and the DARKTOWNERS scatter in all

directions, DIVING for the nearest hiding place. They seem to know what

this mighty rumbing signifies.

The E-TICKET RIDE pops out of the ground - begins to RISE into the air -

and a COLOSSUS appears beneath it! A FIFTY-FOOT WARRIOR clad in JAPANESE

CEREMONIAL ARMOR, he TOWERS over Dark Town, so mighty and enormous that

he can wear the E-TICKET RIDE as a hat!!

ON STU AND MONKEYBONE - FALLING

STU lands a HAYMAKER, and the two of them break loose of each other -

ON ARMORED COLOSSUS - THAT MOMENT

- LANDING in the upturned palms of the COLOSSUS! STU watches in

disbelief as a PANEL pops open in the giant's CHEST, revealing...

DEATH lets out a MIGHTY ROAR and CLAPS HIS GREAT METAL HANDS together.

Man and monkey are surely squished. But when DEATH opens his hands, STU

is still there, cupped safely in his palms.

He sends STU ROCKETING UPWARD INTO THE STRATOSPHERE with a single flick

of his finger. Then he turns...

A BUNCH OF FRIGHTENED DARKTOWNERS pitch the quivering satyr out into the

middle of the town square.

He looks up tremulously. A GIANT SHADOW falls across him...followed by a

GIANT ARMORED FOOT.

EXT. ZOO - DUSK

JULIE SOBS in a POLICEMAN's arms at the exit to the zoo.

They wander out. Behind them, a squad of COPS are confiscating

MONKEYBONE DOLLS from squawling children as they file out.

EXT. ZOO - PARKING LOT - DUSK

The TWO CORPSES, on gurneys, are being loaded into the back of the

police ambulance. The SURGEON and his team come wandering up.

The SURGEON pulls the sheet off CORPSE #1 - aka O.D. STU.

The SECOND CORPSE sits up abruptly. His sheet falls away, revealing STU

...the real STU...now back in his own body! The SURGEON and his TEAM run

away from the ambulance SHRIEKING.

EXT. ZOO - ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK

BUSTER barks like a maniac. JULIE turns and sees an IMPOSSIBLE VISION

ambling toward her...STU, alive and kicking. She can't believe it's him

until he grabs her and pulls her close.

He pulls her close and kisses her long and hard, quelling all doubts.

They wander off, arm in arm. STU TUGS at the seat of his pants.

He DOES A TAKE as he realizes what he's just said - but JULIE smiles,

and he shrugs it off. Johnny Mercer's "DREAM" comes up underneath as the

reunited lovers walk off into the moonlight, and we
