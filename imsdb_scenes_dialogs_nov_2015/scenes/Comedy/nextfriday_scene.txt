EXT. FRONT LAWN - OVERHEAD SHOT - NIGHT

DEBO is laid out on the grass.

Blue and red police lights flash over Debo's body.  Two

sheriffs walk INTO OUR FRAME and stand over Debo.  They flash

their lights on him.

They get him to his feet; but he stumbles and falls in the

bushes like a knocked out prize fighter.  The sheriffs laugh

at him.

Debo looks dazed and confused.  The sheriffs help him out the

bushes and start to cuff him.

They walk him OUT OF FRAME...

SOUNDTRACK!

"New Line Cinema presents, etc., etc...

FADE IN:

EXT. LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING

OPENING CREDITS.  It's early Friday morning and the sun peeks

over the LA skyline.  As the city starts to awake and the

credits continue to roll;

we see SEVERAL SHOTS of the real people who make up Los

Angeles.  It seems that they all move to the same beat.

EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS

Debo is released from the Twin Towers County Jail.  Still in

his orange jumpsuit, he walks right past us and down the

street.  Everybody clears his path.

SOUNDTRACK still PUMPIN'.

Debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and

directing traffic.  Debo stops, the man starts to dance in

front of him.  He stares for a second, then he's on his way.

Still walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the

sidewalk (losing cool points).

Three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the

latest dance steps on their way to school.  Debo is walking

towards them.  They scream and take off in the other

direction.  He smiles.  Briefly.

Still walking; he stops at a corner.  A SA boy waits to cross

with his low-rider bike.  A Metrolink train passes.  After it

goes by; we see Debo riding off on the boy's bike.  He's on

the ground holding his eye.

Debo continues to ride through the city.

He turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at Craig's

house.

EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Jones' dog catcher's truck sits in front of the house.

A CHIHUAHUA (like the Taco Bell dog) takes a dump on the

lawn.  It starts to BARK at Debo.  He looks down at the dog

and kicks him in the street.  The DOG YIPES!

Debo focuses his attention on Craig's house.

INT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The hallway is clear and quiet, until MR. JONES (Craig's

father), storms out of the bedroom.  He struggles to put on

his dog catcher's uniform.  He stops at the bathroom door and

knocks hard.

Mr. Jones laughs at himself.

Mr. Jones continues on his way; dancing to the beat.

INT. BATHROOM - CLOSE-UP ON HIGH TIMES MAGAZINE - CONTINUOUS

Hands crack open a $20 sack of bud onto the magazine.  A pack

of Zigzags fall INTO FRAME.  Papers are ripped from the

package.

CLOSE UP ON CRAIG JONES

the doctor of this delicate operation.

He's sitting on the toilet (dressed: not using it) putting

the finishing touches on his masterpiece.  He licks, rolls

and slides the 'J into the fifth pocket on his Levi jeans.

He exits.

EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The front door opens.  Mr. Jones walks out the door, yelling

back into the house.

He steps off the porch backwards and into "fresh Chihuahua

shit."  He slips and falls on the grass.

Mr. Jones gets up.  He brushes the grass off his uniform.  He

looks clean, but when he turns around dog shit is smashed all

over his back and butt.

Craig emerges from the house with his bags in hand.

Craig slams the door and starts towards the truck.

Mr. Jones gets in the truck.  Craig jumps in.  They back out

and pull off.

INT. DOG TRUCK - MOVING - CLOSE-UP ON CRAIG - CONTINUOUS

He's daydreaming about Smokey.

Out of nowhere, Debo jumps in front of the truck.  Mr. Jones

slams on the BRAKES.

Debo reaches for his shank.  Craig turns to Mr. Jones!

Mr. Jones floors it and hits Debo.  He falls over the hood,

off the car and in the street.  The yellow truck speeds off.

Debo jumps up staggering with scrapes and bruises.

BACK IN CAR - CONTINUOUS

Craig screams out the window.

Mr. Jones is a bit shaken up.

Craig smells something in the air.

Mr. Jones sniffs.

Mr. Jones grabs the air freshener from under the seat.  He

starts to spray too much.  Craig's window won't roll down.

EXT. CITY OF RANCHO CUCAMONGA - MORNING

They exit the freeway and pass a sign that reads, "Rancho

Cucamonga" (the city away from the city).

EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - CONTINUOUS

Welcome to the suburbs.  Where the "Smiley Happy People" live

in peace and quiet.

The neighborhood is full of green lawns and nice two story

track homes as far as the eye can see.  The yellow truck

drives through the streets and pulls up to a cul-de-sac.  Mr.

Jones BLOWS the HORN.

Uncle Elroy's house is royal blue with gold trim.  All the

other houses are painted in earth tones.

Craig grabs his bags.

As craig gets out;  the front door flies open.  It's DAY-DAY

(22), Craig's crazy younger cousin.  He yells back into the

house.

Day-Day walks out to the car and gives Craig a pound.

Just then, UNCLE ELROY (42) hits the door.  Dressed in boxers

and a T-shirt.  This is Mr. Jones' (very loud) little

brother.

Uncle Elroy laughs.  Mr. Jones isn't amused.

Uncle Elroy hugs Craig by the arm.

Mr. Jones pulls off.  Uncle Elroy yells out to him.

Uncle Elroy starts towards to the house.

Day-Day laughs.

They do.  It is quiet, except for a few BIRDS SINGING.

Just then, a maroon Cadillac low-rider on Daytons rolls up

the block.  It's the Jokers: JOKER (28), LI'L JOKER (21) and

BABY JOKER (15).  They pull into their driveway.

In SLOW MOTION: One by one they get out the car.  They have a

dog with them named "Cheeco."  As they get to the front door

they all look over at Craig and Day-Day.

Day-Day looks away, while Craig keeps his eye on them.  They

disappear inside.

They walk over to his black BMW 325i on chrome rims.

They turn to spot MISS HO KYM (67), the old Korean lady who

lives next door.  She's sitting on her porch nursing a cup of

coffee.

Day-Day smiles at Craig.

Craig can't believe his ears.

They all look over at the Joker's house.

Day-Day and Craig start to walk back to the house.

INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Day-Day and Craig enter the house.  They still have the

furniture from the projects.  Craig looks around.  He spots

at a few hanging pictures.

Mother's picture: she looks like Day-Day with a wig on.

She's smiling and holding the winning lotto ticket.

A sad moment.

Day-Day exits.  Craig is left to look around, until something

outside catches his eye.

EXT. HOUSE

It's D'WANA (20), Day-Day's six-month pregnant girlfriend.

She's walking on the right side of his BMW.  With one hand

she waves at Craig...with the other hand she's keying Day-

Day's car with the skills of a retarded first-grader.

INT. HOUSE

Craig waves back, but something ain't right.  Uncle Elroy

steps in with SUGA (39), his nymphomaniac girlfriend.  She's

wearing a sexy nightie that's a size too small.

She gives Craig a big, juicy hug and kiss, grabbing his ass

in the process.

Uncle Elroy un-hugs them.

Suga walks out.

He looks.

Day-Day runs down the stairs to get a look.  He's holding a

piece of paper.

He runs out the door.

EXT. HOUSE

D'Wana continues her job.  Day-Day storms over, waving the

paper.

Day-Day spots the damage.  He loses it.

Now he's a madman.

Day-Day charges D'Wana.  She has her pepper spray ready.

D'Wana sprays his face orange.  He stops in his tracks; grabs

his eyes and screams like a woman.

D'Wana runs to her car.  She speeds off.  Uncle Elroy goes

for the water hose.  Craig grabs Day-Day.

Craig puts him on the grass.

Before he can say another word, Uncle Elroy nearly drowns him

with the water hose.

Day-Day is drowning.

Craig moves the hose.

Now Day-Day is blind and choking.

They get him up and into the house.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

They rush Day-Day into the shower.

Uncle Elroy turns on the cold water.  Day-Day screams.  He

tries to get out.  They push him back in.

Uncle Elroy slams the door.  Day-Day stands in the shower

fully dressed and soaking wet.

They exit, leaving Day-Day in the shower.

EXT. ELROY'S BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

Uncle Elroy and Craig start to walk around the back yard.  In

the B.G., we NOTICE giant weed plants everywhere.

They walk over to the pool.

It's half-full with dirty water.  An upside-down lawn chair

floats in it.

The Jacuzzi water has a purple condom floating in it.  Uncle

Elroy reaches over and picks it out.

EXT. CRACK HOUSE - MORNING

A run-down crack house sits alone in the middle of the block.

It looks deserted with chipped paint, overgrown grass and

security bars everywhere.  Inside we can hear a FIGHT in

progress.

Suddenly the door flies open and Ezal comes flying out on his

ass.

He gets up and brushes himself off.  He heads back into the

crack house.

SMACK!  SMACK!  SMACK!  Ezal is roughed up some more and

flies through the picture window.  GLASS rains down.

Ezal lays there in pain.  Out of nowhere, a bicycle comes

INTO FRAME.  Ezal looks up at the rider.  It's Debo.

Debo rolls on top of him with the front tire.  Ezal is

smashed and in more pain.

Debo thinks about it.

He rolls off of Ezal.  Relief.

Ezal hops on the handlebars quick.  They start to ride off.

Debo rides over the curb and into the street.  The journey

begins.

INT. DAY-DAY'S ROOM - MORNING

Day-Day's room is junky.  Clothes are everywhere.  He's

putting on his Pinky's Records and Disc T-shirt.  Craig comes

in.

Day-Day's face looks sunburned.

He looks at his watch.

Day-Day exits.  Craig is close behind.

EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

As they walk out the front door, someone catches Craig's eye.

It's KARLA (23), the Joker brothers' fine sister.  She's

leaning against the lowrider, looking into her purse.  She

waves at them.

Craig and Day-Day are mesmerized.

Craig and Karla's eyes meet.  She smiles.

Day-Day walks over to his Beamer.  Craig follows.

CLOSE-UP

Big scratch on the side of Day-Day's car.

WIDER

Craig is still looking at Karla.

Day-Day is starting to get mad.

Karla looks at her watch and starts to walk up the street.

This is Craig's chance.

He trots after her.

Karla is still walking.

She stops and waits for him.

Day-Day is about to have a heart attack.  He's looking back

and forth between Craig and Karla, and the Joker's house

where somebody is looking out the window.

Back at the "Love Connection," Craig has Karla smiling.

Craig starts to trot over towards Day-Day.  Day-Day is

frantically waving Craig to hurry.

Day-Day's eyes get as big as golf balls.

Craig turns to see the pit bull "Cheeco" running right after

him.

Craig runs right towards Day-Day's BMW.

They both jump on top of Day-Day's BMW with CHEECO coming up

fast.  He's BARKING viciously.

ACROSS STREET

Joker, Li'l Joker and Baby Joker are across the street

laughing.  Karla is embarrassed.

ON BMW

Craig is breathing hard but he's calm, but Day-Day is

terrified.

They continue to laugh.  Craig pulls his belt off.  He swings

it and hits Cheeco in the middle of his forehead with the

buckle.  The DOG CRIES and runs back across the street.

The Jokers aren't laughing anymore.  Joker stares at Craig.

Craig stares back.  You can feel the tension.  Joker kicks

the dog.

CHEECO HOLLERS.  Craig and Day-Day get off the top of the

BMW.

Big dents in the roof of his BMW.

Day-Day gets into the car.

He slams the door, starts the car and backs up.  Leaving

Craig standing there.  He sees Karla walking away.  He looks

over at the Jokers.  They're still staring hard.  Craig just

looks away and walks into the house.

INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Craig steps into the house.

Uncle Elroy is sitting on the couch.  He has a Phillies'

Blunt (cigar) in one hand, a razor blade in the other.

Suga is sippin' on a glass of wine.  She moves over, making

room in the middle.

Craig does.  Suga moves closer, boxing him in nice and tight.

Uncle Elroy licks the cigar.

Uncle Elroy takes the razor and starts to cut the cigar the

long way.

Uncle Elroy scrapes the cigar shavings into a nearby trash

can (that's overflowing with cigar shavings already).  Suga

presses against Craig.

Uncle Elroy stuffs the open cigar full of weed.  He's

concentrating.

He licks and rolls.

It's perfect.

Uncle Elroy grabs the lighter.

He lights the blunt.  Craig's watching, so is Suga.  Uncle

Elroy holds the smoke in for a very long time.  Maybe too

long...'cause his eyes start to bulge, and he starts to toke

(cough with your mouth closed).  And toke.  And toke.  And

toke.  It looks like he's about to bust when he lets out a

big puff of smoke.  Then he starts to cough, and cough, and

cough out of control.

Craig and Suga are amazed at this display.  Uncle Elroy falls

to the floor on his hands and knees.  Still coughing.  He

falls on his back and passes the blunt to Craig.

Craig takes the blunt and puts it up to his lips.  He hits

it, holds it in and looks at Suga.  Suddenly, his eyes bulge

out and he starts to toke, and toke, and toke, and toke.  He

starts to cough out of control and he falls next to Uncle

Elroy who's still coughing.  Craig passes the blunt to Suga,

who looks at it for a moment and then looks directly INTO the

CAMERA.  (As if to say, "Shiiiiiiiiiiiit.").

INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - 15 MINUTES LATER

All three are passed out on the couch.  Uncle Elroy is

snoring with a little slobber hanging.  Craig's knocked out

with his mouth open.  Suga's head is not secure and she's

starting to bob.  She bobs so hard that her head falls in

Craig's lap.  He wakes up and looks down.

He looks over at Uncle Elroy who's looking over at him.

Uncle Elroy staggers to his feet.

Suga takes Elroy's hand.

They both stumble upstairs leaving Craig all alone.  It's too

quiet now.  He grabs the remote and TURNS ON the TV.  Flicks

a few channels.  He picks up the blunt and the lighter.

ON TV

A public service announcement from King/Drew Rehab Center.

It's SMOKEY!

He lifts a 22 oz. bottle of Olde English.

BACK ON COUCH

Craig is high.  He's looking at the TV with a slight smile on

his face.  It seems like the walls are shaking.  He looks

over at Suga's glass and her wine is vibrating, like Jurassic

Park.  Plaster falls from the ceiling.  He listens, it's

Uncle Elroy and Suga making love.

His eavesdropping is interrupted by a loud KNOCK on the door.

Craig is so comfortable, he doesn't want to move.  The

KNOCKING gets LOUDER.

Craig gets up slowly and starts to clean the area.  The

KNOCKING CONTINUES.

Craig stops what he's doing and swings the door open.

ON PORCH

The DELIVERY GUY, a thirtysomething asshole with tight shorts

and a buzz cut, is looking into the house.

He hands Craig a letter.

Craig signs.

He laughs and walks off singing the "Good Times" jingle.

Cheeco starts to chase him down the street.  Craig looks at

the notice.  "DELINQUENT! YOUR HOUSE WILL BE SEIZED AND

AUCTIONED -- TOMORROW AT 9AM  PAY TODAY!"

He SLAMS the DOOR.  We FOLLOW Craig upstairs TO Uncle Elroy's

room.  He knocks softly.

No answer.

Still no answer.  He turns the knob.  It's open.

INT. UNCLE ELROY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Craig steps into Uncle Elroy's freak palace.  Black lights,

candles, velvet posters - the works.  There's even a leather

fuck swing hanging from the ceiling.  Uncle Elroy and Suga

are asleep in a leopard-skin waterbed.  Craig is amazed.  He

slowly walks over to the bed.  Uncle Elroy is calling the

hogs.  Snoring.

He's about to shake him when Uncle Elroy lets out a big

grunt.  It startles Craig.  He looks over at Suga.  She's

completely under the covers.  Uncle Elroy rolls over on his

stomach, then he rolls on his back again.  Craig shakes him.

No response.  Craig tries again.

Uncle Elroy jumps up like a hibernating grizzly.

He goes after Craig, who has to fight him off.

Uncle Elroy grabs him in a bear hug and slams him on the bed.

Craig finds himself caught between Suga and Uncle Elroy, but

now everything is totally still and quiet.  Uncle Elroy

starts to snore again.  He's asleep.  The coast is clear now.

Craig tries to make his escape.  He crawls over Suga to get

away.  She grabs him and starts to kiss him.

Craig breaks away and tries to hurry out the room.  On his

exit, he hangs himself on the "fuck swing" and hits the floor

with a thud.  He scrambles to his feet, then he's out of

there.  Uncle Elroy and Suga lay asleep as if nothing ever

happened.

IN HALLWAY

Craig tries to gain his composure.  He gets an idea.

EXT. BUSY CITY STREET - AFTERNOON

Debo is riding Ezal on the handlebars.

Debo keeps riding.

He finally stops at a pay phone.  Ezal jumps off and grabs

his ass.

Mr. Jones' dog truck sits in front.

Debo slaps him in the back of the head.

Smack!  Debo slaps him again.

Ezal picks up the phone.  He starts to dial.

Debo slaps him again.

Ezal hangs up the phone.

Debo and Ezal run across the street to the dog truck.  Debo

opens the back and lets all the dogs out.  They run for it.

Debo is a hard fit.  Ezal stuffs him in there.

Finally he's in.  Ezal gets in and slams the door shut.  Just

then, Mr. Jones comes running out the joint with a sandwich

in hand.

He gets in and speeds off.

EXT. CUCAMONGA SHOPPING CENTER - AFTERNOON

Cars pull in and out of this 12 store strip mall where

Pinky's is located.

INT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - AFTERNOON

Everything is pink inside this mom and pop record store.  The

latest RAP HIT PLAYS in the B.G.  A few people exit the store

with bags.

Day-Day is scanning inventory.  A bud-head by the name of

ROACH is on top of the counter with his skateboard.

He tries to jump off the counter and land perfectly on his

board.  Wrong!  Off the board and on his ass.

An unhappy CUSTOMER walks in holding a CD without the cover.

The customer throws the CD on the counter.  Day-Day picks it

up.

Craig walks in with the notice in hand.

The customer KNOCKS over a counter display and then turns to

get away.

Craig bumps him and he falls into the Rap cassette rack.

He jumps up and slips on a few more cassettes on his scramble

out the door.

Roach can't believe what just happened.

He gives it to Day-Day.

Craig nods his head.

Day-Day reads the notice.

Day-Day ignores Roach.

Day-Day opens it.  A PHONE starts to RING.

Roach skateboards over to the phone.

Day-Day reads on.

Day-Day goes for his bank book.  He flips a few pages.

Day-Day is overwhelmed.  Roach skates back over.

Day-Day looks at Craig.  He runs over to the door.

OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT

D'Wana sits in her car with her play sister BABY'D (her name

does not fit her body).

Day-Day locks the door and runs into the back.  Craig and

Roach follow.

The PHONE starts to RING again.  D'Wana and Baby'D are at the

door.  D'Wana is on her phone.  Baby'D starts to knock.

The knocking gets louder.

AT FRONT DOOR

They observe the "Yes We're Open" sign.

Craig is peeking out.  He hesitates.

Craig walks out the back.  He steps over the door.  Unlocks

it, and cracks it open.

They don't believe him.

Baby'D kicks the door.  Craig has no choice but to let 'em

in.

Suddenly Roach is pushed into the front area.

D'Wana looks at Baby'D.

Craig looks at Roach for directions.  He nods over towards

the front of the store.

Baby'D checks out Craig as he leads the way.  D'Wana looks

around.

D'Wana starts to walk towards Craig and Baby'D.

But first she doubles back towards the storage room.

As she's walking in the back, Roach realizes his mistake.

BACK STORAGE AREA

Day-Day makes a run for it.  She spots him ducking out the

back door.

INSIDE STORE

Baby'D knocks Craig out of the way.

Baby'D gives chase with D'Wana, Craig and Roach close behind.

EXT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - CONTINUOUS

Day-Day runs around the side of Pinky's Records store.  He

stops to see if anyone is coming.  It's Baby'D with the three

others trailing.  Baby'D is chasing Day-Day all through the

parking lot.  Craig, D'Wana and Roach stop to watch.

...and he is.

He runs back towards his BMW.  The chase continues around his

car.  Baby'D is starting to tire.

D'Wana watches from a distance.  Craig and Roach are close.

Just then, out of nowhere, Karla appears behind them carrying

a couple of bags.  She taps Craig on his shoulder.  He turns

around.

She hands him a card with her number on it.

She picks up her shopping bags and walks away.  Over at the

chase: Baby'D is winded.  She bends over trying to catch her

breath.

Baby'D looks over at Craig.

Day-Day carefully walks back over towards the store.  D'Wana

pouts and walks towards Baby'D.  (If looks could kill.)

Craig looks over at Baby'D.  She's waiting.

Craig turns and sprints into the store.  Baby'D looks

concerned.  Day-Day grabs Roach and they run into the store.

D'Wana hands her a brick.

Baby'D screams and throws the brick through Day-Day's

WINDSHIELD.

INT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - CONTINUOUS

Day-Day is devastated.

Day-Day starts to walk into the back storage area.

Day-Day is like a zombie now.  He doesn't answer, just keeps

walking.

No answer.  Craig looks at Roach.  They follow.

BACK STORAGE AREA

Day-Day sits with the notice in hand.

Day-Day is still sad.

Roach pulls out a big, smashed brownie with green shit in it.

Day-Day shakes his head.  Craig reaches into his fifth

pocket.

He has the joint from this morning.

Roach snatches it.

Craig snatches it back.

Day-Day snatches the joint and puts it in his mouth.

Roach pulls out a mini-skateboard that's actually a lighter.

He lights the joint.  Day-Day takes a hit.

He hands the joint to Craig.  Gets up and closes the door.

Then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner.

He plugs in the VACUUM and TURNS it ON.  He puts the nozzle

in Day-Day's face.

Day-Day hits the 'J and blows into the nozzle.  It quickly

sucks up the smoke.

Roach hits the joint harder than anyone else.  Smoke starts

to come out of his ears.  Craig and Day-Day get a kick out of

that.

EXT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - CONTINUOUS

A pink limo pulls to a stop.  The chauffeur gets out wearing

his suit just a little too tight.  He opens the door and a

pair of pink boots hit the pavement.  The CAMERA PANS UP TO

PINKY (35), the asshole owner.

He walks over to the door.  He thinks it's open.  It's not.

He shakes the door.  It's locked.  He looks inside.  No one's

at the counter.  Cassettes all over the floor.  Pinky looks

around making sure no one sneaks up on him.  He reaches under

his shirt and pulls out a Glock 9mm.  Sticks his key in the

door and steps in.

BACK STORE AREA - CLOSE UP - ROACH

is upside down.  All the blood has rushed to his head.  He

has Chinaman eyes and a big smile on his face.

A big cloud of smoke rolls out of his mouth and he falls and

hits the deck.

Craig and Day-Day laugh at Roach.  The VACUUM is still GOING

but the room is very smoky.  Craig jumps in.

IN HALLWAY

Craig makes a left and grabs the knob.  He feels something

pressing on the back of his head (gun).

Craig throws his hands up.

He obeys.  Pinky backs Craig into the store.

Craig gets down.

Pinky starts to pat down Craig's pockets.

Craig says nothing.

Pinky backs up and steps on Roach's skateboard.  The gun goes

flying and so does he.  Pinky falls on his ass.  The 9mm

lands in front of Craig.  There's a big scramble for the gun.

BACK STORAGE AREA

The mood is serious.

Day-Day gives Roach the evil-eye.

BACK INSIDE STORE

Pinky and Craig are still scrambling for the gun.  The store

looks like a tornado hit it.  Twice.  Craig comes up with the

pistol.  Pinky jumps on the ground.

Craig is exhausted.  He stands over Pinky with the gun.

Just then, Day-Day and Roach come from the back.

He looks up at Craig.

Craig looks at Day-Day.  Day-Day looks back at him.  Nobody's

high now.

INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MONTAGE SEQUENCE

Uncle Elroy opens his bedroom door wearing a S&M mask and

holding a tube of KY jelly.  He removes the mask.  Day-Day

hands.

He starts to beat Day-Day with a sex toy.

EXT. FREEWAY - MONTAGE SEQUENCE - AFTERNOON

The dog truck exits the freeway.  He pulls into a gas station

by the freeway.  He stops near the restrooms and jumps out,

He knocks.

No answer.  Mr. Jones paces nervously.

EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S PORCH - MONTAGE SEQUENCE - LATE AFTERNOON

Craig and Day-Day are trying to think.  Roach is practicing

skateboard moves.  He's not very good.

EXT. GAS STATION RESTROOM - MONTAGE SEQUENCE

He knocks again.

Just then the door opens and out walks MICHAEL JORDAN.

Mr. Jones is stunned.

Jordan jumps in his car and he's gone.  Mr. Jones is happy

He walks in the bathroom.

Reality hits, it stinks up in there.  Mr. Jones fronds.

He starts to spray.

EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S PORCH - MONTAGE SEQUENCE - LATE AFTERNOON

Craig, Day-Day and Roach are sitting on the porch thinking.

He gets on his skateboard.

He attempts to jump off the porch with his board and lands

dead on his ass once again.  His board continues to roll.

His board continues to roll into the street.  At this same

time, Joker's low-rider rolls by and breaks his board in two.

Roach runs to pick up the pieces.

The Joker Bros. back their low-rider into the driveway.  They

have no sympathy.  Cheeco (the pitbull) is in the back yard.

He's happy to see them.

They stroll into the house with three Mexican girls with

them.  Joker spots our trio looking.

They disappear into the house.

BACK ON PORCH

Craig has a twinkle in his eyes and Roach walks over, pissed.

Craig is looking over at the Joker's house.  Baby Joker walks

out the front door.  He walks over to the rider and POPS the

TRUNK.

Baby Joker pulls out a chrome hydraulic pump.  He carries it

towards the house.  Cheeco starts to hump his leg.

Baby Joker drops the pump, something falls out.  (We can't

see what it is.)  Baby Joker quickly puts it back.

BACK ON PORCH

Day-Day and Roach look at each other.

INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT

The private party is starting to heat up.  Big Joker sits on

other senorita is pouring herself a drink.

Karla walks into the room.

Karla storms out the room.  Baby Joker walks in carrying the

chrome pump.

The Pretty Girl moves off Joker's lap.

Baby Joker carries the pump in the bedroom.  Joker is close

Craig, Day-Day and Roach are sneaking across the street

towards Joker's house.  Craig looks calm.  Day-Day looks

nervous.  Roach eats on a piece of baloney.

Day-Day tries to turn around.  Craig grabs him.

Craig slaps the baloney out of his hand.

All three kneel down next to a parked car.  Day-Day looks

sick.

Craig grabs Day-Day again.

Day-Day realizes that Craig is right. He takes a deep breath.

Roach crawls away on his hands and knees.

EXT. JOKER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Roach sneaks past Joker's lowrider.  He slowly approaches the

fence.  No sign of Cheeco.  Roach opens the pack of baloney

and pulls out a slice.

It's pitch-black behind the fence, still no Cheeco.

PARKED CAR - SAME TIME

Craig makes a move.

Day-Day follows.

They sneak up to the side of the house.  The MUSIC is

BLEEDING THROUGH the walls.

INSIDE HOUSE

Li'l Joker is dancing with all 3 girls.  They're all getting

high and feeling good.  One girl has come out of her blouse.

The others start to follow her lead.

BACK OUTSIDE

Craig and Day-Day are peeking through the window.  Craig

moves on.  Day-Day is still watching.

Craig snatches him from the window.  They walk over to the

fence.

Day-Day gets ready to fight.

Craig jumps like he's going to hit him.  Day-Day jumps back

and almost falls.

ROACH

...is having no luck.  Cheeco is nowhere to be found.  Roach

starts to sing.

We hear a MEAN GROWL out of the darkness.  Roach continues.

GROWLING gets LOWDER.

We can hear TINY FOOTSTEPS RUNNING at Roach.

CHEECO is running at Roach full speed.  He jumps on the fence

and starts to BARK with everything he's got.  Roach drops the

baloney.

CRAIG AND DAY-DAY

...hear the DOG BARKING and freeze in their tracks.  Day-Day

tries to run.  Craig grabs him, again.

A LOT of BARKING.  Nothing coming.

ROACH

...picks up the baloney and stuffs the whole pack into his

mouth.  CHEECO is SILENCED.  Roach is relieved.

INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The chrome pump is open and filled with money.  Baby Joker's

pulling out the money while Joker sits on the bed counting

it.  They stop when they hear CHEECO BARKING.

In the mirror behind Joker, we see a stick slide through the

curtain.  The curtain cracks just enough to see Craig's eye

looking in.

Just then, Li'l Joker bursts through the door with his shirt

off and two half-naked girls on his arms.

Baby Joker looks at the girls, then at Joker.

Joker hands Baby Joker the money.  He puts it away.  They

start to exit the room.

OUTSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Craig is still looking.  Day-Day is scared shitless.  He's

looking for Cheeco.

Craig climbs in the window.  Day-Day holds his stomach.

ROACH

... his meat supply is almost gone.  He tries to think fast.

Cheeco starts to look for more meat.  Roach grabs the smashed

brownie out of his pocket and throws it to Cheeco.  He

swallows it in one big gulp.  He's looking for more.  There

is no more.  Roach smiles.  CHEECO GROWLS.

CHEECO'S STILL GROWLING.  Suddenly Cheeco falls back on his

butt and lets out a slight moan.

CHEECO'S POV

Cheeco is looking up at Roach.  He's seeing double, even

triple.  Cheeco lays down.  It looks like he's faded.

INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Craig is in.  The bedroom door is cracked.  Craig walks over

and shuts the door gently.  He locks it.  Then he creeps over

to the dresser.  He pulls out the pump and sets it on the

in.  He starts to stuff it in his pockets.

Everybody looks confused.

Joker starts to kick the door.

INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Craig hurries to put the pump back.  He's about to go for the

window when: BANG!  There's a KICK on the door.  All Craig

can do is go for another door on the other side of the room.

time.

the bed.

Her door flies open.  Smashing Craig behind it.  It's Li'l

Joker.

Craig looks nervous.

Karla pushes Li'l Joker out.

calm and cool now.

Roach is on his back looking through the fence.  He hits a

joint and blows the smoke into Cheeco's face.

Cheeco is passed out.  Day-Day sneaks around the corner.  He

whispers.

Craig looks AT the CAMERA.

the dog truck.

Craig ducks back.

The singing stops.

47.

BOOM!

Debo hits Joker from the back.  Joker is out cold.

Ezal picks up the gun and hands it to Debo.

CHEECO!

The pitbull is back!  And he's mad as hell.  He runs through

everybody and jumps on Debo, knocking the gun from his hand.
