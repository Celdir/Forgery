HE GALLANTLY INTERTWINES HIS ARMS IN HERS IN A LOVER'S TOAST.

IT IS HARD TO DRINK WITH ARMS ENTWINED, ESPECIALLY IF ONE OF

THE ARMS IS ATTACHED TO A LITTLE OLD LADY.  THE TOAST IS A

FIASCO, BIALYSTOCK GETTING MOST OF THE CHAMPAGNE OVER HIS

VEST AND TROUSERS.

SHE SNAPS OPEN HER LITTLE BEADED PURSE, TAKES OUT THE CHECK

AND BEGINS TO HAND IT TO BIALYSTOCK.  AT THIS MOMENT, WE ARE

ASSAULTED BY THE PASSIONATE SOUND OF A CRYING VIOLIN.

CLOSING IN ON THE TABLE.  THE LITTLE OLD LADY IS DELIGHTED

BY THE VIOLINIST AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR BIALYSTOCK STOPS THE

PASSAGE OF THE CHECK AS HER ATTENTION IS DIVERTED.

BIALYSTOCK CAUTIOUSLY REACHES OUT TO SNATCH THE CHECK BUT

EACH TIME THAT HE DOES, A TURN IN THE MUSIC MAKES THE LITTLE

DRESSING TABLE.  FROM BEHIND AN ORNATE DRESSING SCREEN, WE

HEAR MUFFLED SOUNDS OF DISCONTENT.

CUT TO BOUDOIR ENTRANCE.  CARMEN, BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER.

DE BRIS' HEAD POPS OVER THE SCREEN.  HE IS A ONCE HANDSOME,

NOW DISSIPATED MAN IN HIS LATE FORTIES.

DE BRIS EMERGES FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN.  HE IS WEARING A

"LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN" STYLE DRESS.

DE BRIS IS SUDDENLY AWARE OF BLOOM'S EXPRESSION.  (BLOOM'S

MOUTH IS STILL AGAPE.)

HE PARADES BACK AND FORTH, EXECUTING SHARP TURNS LIKE A

MODEL AT A FASHION SHOW.

CARMEN TURNS IN A HUFF AND LEAVES TO GET THE WIG.  DE BRIS

REACHES INTO CUT CRYSTAL CIGARETTE BOX, TAKES CIGARETTE,

TAPS IT, AND HOLDS IT FOR A LIGHT.

BLOOM NERVOUSLY REACHES FOR A BOOK OF MATCHES, RIPS ONE OUT

AND STRIKES IT.  IT DOESN'T LIGHT.  HE TRIES ANOTHER AND

ANOTHER.  ONE FINALLY CATCHES FIRE.  HE TRIES TO HOLD IT

STEADY, BUT HE IS TOO NERVOUS.  DE BRIS FIRMLY PLACES HIS

HAND OVER BLOOM'S TO STEADY THE FLAME.

HE LIGHTS THE CIGARETTE BUT CONTINUES TO HOLD BLOOM'S HAND.

CARMEN ENTERS CARRYING WIG.  HE SEES DE BRIS HOLDING BLOOM'S

HAND.

DE BRIS DROPS BLOOM'S HAND AND TURNS ON CARMEN.

DE BRIS EXTENDS HIS HAND.  BIALYSTOCK SHAKES IT.

LITTLE BLACK MUSTACHE.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK.

DE BRIS, FOLLOWED BY CARMEN, HOPS TO THE STAGE AND ADDRESSES

THE MILLING MOB.

AS THE DANCING HITLERS LEAVE THE STAGE, CARMEN ARRANGES THE

SINGING HITLERS SO THAT THEY ARE IN A LONG STRAIGHT LINE

AGAINST THE BACK OF THE STAGE WALL.  CARMEN READS OUT A NAME

AND THE FIRST SINGING HITLER WALKS DOWNSTAGE TO AUDITION.

EXCEPT FOR A SPORTY LITTLE HITLER MUSTACHE, HE BEARS LITTLE

RESEMBLANCE TO THE FUHRER.

AS ARTHUR TELLS HIM THE TITLE OF HIS SONG, DE BRIS MOUTHS IT

WORD FOR WORD TOWARD HIS FRIEND, CARMEN.

FROM OFF-STAGE WE HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF BOOTS APPROACHING.

ALL EYES TURN TOWARD THE STAGE.  FROM OUT OF THE WINGS STEPS

A YOUNG PERSON IN A LEATHER DOUBLET, HIGH LEATHER BOOTS, AND

EXTREMELY LONG HAIR.  IT CARRIES A GUITAR.  UNTIL IT SPEAKS,

WE ARE NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS A YOUNG MAN OR A YOUNG WOMAN.

(LORENZO ST. DU BOIS)

LSD SINGS "I'M THE VICTIM OF A MULTI-MYSTIC FREAK-OUT." THE

SONG IS GEARED TO THE AU COURANT "RAGA ROCK" BEAT.  PHRASES

SUCH AS, "CONNECT WITH THE INFINITE" AND "TURN ON THE

WORLD." LORENZO FINISHES THE NUMBER.

OPENING NIGHTERS, ALL AGLITTER IN DIAMONDS, FURS AND ELEGANT

TUXEDOS.  LUXURIOUS BLACK LIMOUSINES PULL UP TO THE CURB,

DEPOSITING THEIR RICH CONTENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE

LITTLE OLD LADIES.

CUT TO LOBBY.  THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE SWIRLING CONFUSION

STAND BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IN THEIR OPENING NIGHT TAILS.

BIALYSTOCK IS RESPLENDENT IN A BLACK SILK CAPE, LINED IN

CRIMSON SATIN.  BLOOM'S TAILS ARE OBVIOUSLY RENTED.  THEY

ARE NEAR THE TICKET TAKER.  AS SOME OF THE OPENING NIGHT

"SUPPORTERS" ENTER THE THEATRE, THEY SHOUT ENCOURAGEMENTS TO

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  TO EACH OF THE WELL-WISHERS,

BIALYSTOCK RESPONDS WITH A SMILE AND A MUMBLE.  THEY GET THE

SMILE, WE HEAR THE MUMBLE.

CUT TO LIMOUSINE PULLING UP IN FRONT OF THEATRE.  DOORMAN

OPENS DOOR, ASSISTS RICH COUPLE OUT OF CAR.  LIMOUSINE PULLS

AWAY.  A MOTORCYCLE WITH SIDE-CAR ROARS UP TO FRONT OF

THEATRE.  AT THE HANDLEBARS, BEAUTIFULLY DECKED OUT IN

TUXEDO AND HIS EVER POPULAR GERMAN HELMET IS FRANZ LIEBKIND.

CAMERA FOLLOWS LIEBKIND AS HE ENTERS LOBBY.  HE MAKES HIS

WAY THROUGH THE MILLING THRONG TOWARD BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

HE CLICKS HIS HEELS AND SHAKES HANDS WITH EACH OF THEM.

HE STARTS INTO THEATRE, STOPS, TURNS BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND

BLOOM.

HE TURNS TRIUMPHANTLY AND ENTERS THE THEATRE.

BIALYSTOCK AMBLES OVER TO THE TIMES CRITIC, WHO HAS STOPPED

TO CHAT WITH SOME PEOPLE.

BIALYSTOCK WINKS AND SAUNTERS OFF.

THE CRITIC STALKS INTO THE THEATRE.  AS HE PASSES BIALYSTOCK,

HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY FLINGS THE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL TO THE

FLOOR.  HE DISAPPEARS THROUGH THE DOOR.

BIALYSTOCK REACHES DOWN, PICKS UP CRUMPLED DOLLAR BILL,

STRAIGHTENS IT OUT, PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET.

FROM INSIDE THE THEATRE, WE HEAR THE OVERTURE BEGINNING.

LIGHTS IN THE LOBBY BLINK.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE THEATRE.

CUT TO REVERSE ANGLE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING DARKENED

THEATRE.  THEY TAKE POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

BLOOM EXTENDS HIS HAND TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE INTENDS TO SPEAK

IN A CONFIDENT AND CONTROLLED MANNER BUT WHAT COMES OUT IS

AN HYSTERICAL SHRIEK.

HE SCARES HIMSELF AND QUICKLY CLAPS HIS HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH.

CUT TO STAGE.  AS THE OVERTURE IS CONCLUDED, THE CURTAIN

SLOWLY RISES.  ON STAGE THERE IS A LINE OF GIRLS DRESSED IN

SEXY STORM TROOPER COSTUMES--BLACK PATENT LEATHER BOOTS, ETC.

THEIR ARMS ARE LINKED ABOUT ONE ANOTHER AS THEY DANCE AND

KICK IN RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL ROCKETTE FASHION.

THE STORM TROOPER ROCKETTES PART AND FROM ABOVE THEM,

DESCENDING TWIN STAIRCASES, WE SEE TWO LINES OF BEAUTIFUL

SHOWGIRLS, HOLDING HUGE BALLOONS ABOVE THEIR HEADS.  ON EACH

CUT TO STAGE.  "SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER" OPENING IS ENDING IN

A GREAT CRESCENDO OF PATRIOTIC INSANITY.

CURTAIN FALLS.  THE NUMBER IS RECEIVED BY THE AUDIENCE WITH

HUSHED SILENCE.  FOLLOWED BY A SURGE TOWARD THE DOORS.  THE

AISLES ARE CHOKED WITH UNHAPPY PEOPLE, WHO CAN'T WAIT TO GET

OUT.

CURTAIN RISES.  ON STAGE ARE EVA BRAUN AND HITLER (LSD).

EVA BRAUN IS A FETCHING BLONDE IN LONG BRAIDS.  LSD IS

PACING UP AND DOWN.  EVA BRAUN SITS ON LOVE SEAT DOWNSTAGE.

IN HER HAND IS AN OVERSIZED DAISY.  AS SHE PULLS THE PETALS

FROM IT, SHE WHINES.  SHE HAS A PRONOUNCED AMERICAN ACCENT.

CUT TO PEOPLE IN AISLE.  THEY HAVE NOTICEABLY SLOWED DOWN.

SOME ARE WALKING BACKWARDS.  THEY ARE INTRIGUED.

CUT BACK TO STAGE.

CUT TO AUDIENCE IN AISLES.  THEY HAVE ALL STOPPED LEAVING TO

TURN AND WATCH.  SOME BEGIN TO LAUGH AND OTHERS APPLAUD.

THEY LIKE LSD.

NOW THERE IS A MAD RUSH TO REGAIN THEIR SEATS.

CUT TO INTERIOR BAR.  IT IS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR THE BARTENDER

AND A DRUNK AT THE FAR END OF THE BAR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

ARE SEATED ON STOOLS AT THE BAR.  THEY CLINK GLASSES.

THEY BOTH LAUGH AND DOWN THEIR DRINKS.  BIALYSTOCK RAPS ON

THE BAR WITH HIS CANE.

BARTENDER LOOKS AROUND AT THE ALMOST EMPTY BARROOM.  DOES A

LITTLE TAKE.  HE THEN REPLENISHES THEIR DRINKS AND PLACES A

GLASS IN FRONT OF THE DRUNK.  THE DRUNK TIPS HIS HAT

GRACIOUSLY TOWARDS BIALYSTOCK.

CUT BACK TO STAGE.  SAME SCENE.  EVA STARTS TO CRY.

DRUNK TIPS HIS HAT GRACIOUSLY.

DURING DRUNK'S SPEECH, BARTENDER HAS REFILLED THEIR GLASSES.

HE STANDS BACK, WATCHING THEM AS HE DRIES GLASSES.

BIALYSTOCK STOPS ABRUPTLY.  HE POINTS TOWARD THE DOOR.  WE

HEAR THE SOUND OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE BAR.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM HOP ON THEIR STOOLS AND COVER THEIR

FACES WITH THEIR HANDS.  THE DRUNK SHRUGS, HOPS ON THE STOOL

NEXT TO THEM AND ALSO HIDES HIS FACE.  A HORDE OF FIRST

NIGHTERS SWEEPS INTO THE BAR.  THEY ARE ALL AROUND

BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND THE DRUNK, CLAMORING FOR DRINKS.

THE CROWD IS VERY CHEERFUL.  THEY ARE STILL BUBBLING FROM

THE FIRST ACT.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM FREEZE.  A LITTLE OLD LADY COMES UP

BEHIND BIALYSTOCK.  SHE RAPS HIM ON THE BACK WITH HER

UMBRELLA.

THE CROWD STARTS TO LEAVE.

THE FIRST NIGHTERS LEAVE THE BAR.  ALL THAT REMAIN ARE

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, THE BARTENDER AND THE DRUNK.

BIALYSTOCK SLIPS OFF THE STOOL AND WANDERS TO MIDDLE OF

BARROOM.

CUT TO BLOOM AT THE BAR, FROZEN, STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD.

HIS EYES ARE GLAZED WITH SHOCK.  HE STROKES HIS CHEEK WITH

HIS LITTLE BLUE BLANKET.

THE DRUNK STARES FROM ONE TO THE OTHER.  UNHAPPY WITH THEIR

PRESENT MOOD, HE DECIDES TO LIVEN THINGS UP AGAIN.  HE

TIPTOES OVER TO BIALYSTOCK, PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND BIALYSTOCK'S

WAIST, ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AND BEGINS TO SING.

BIALYSTOCK PICKS HIM UP AND THROWS HIM ACROSS THE BAR.

DRUNK PICKS HIMSELF UP AND DUSTS HIMSELF OFF.

THE DRUNK STAGGERS OUT OF THE BAR.  BIALYSTOCK GETS A HOLD

OF HIMSELF.

BIALYSTOCK RUSHES OVER TO BLOOM.

BLOOM DOES NOT RESPOND.  BIALYSTOCK SHAKES HIM.

THEY START TO LEAVE.

DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING LOBBY OF THEATRE.

AS THEY OPEN DOOR TO THEATRE, THEY ARE GREETED BY A SHOCK

WAVE OF LAUGHTER.  THEY PAUSE STRICKEN.

THEY TAKE EACH OTHER'S HANDS LIKE TWO FRIGHTENED LITTLE BOYS

AND CAUTIOUSLY WALK IN.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY ENTER.  THEY TAKE THEIR

POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS

MEEKLY, LIKE TWO LAMBS AWAITING THE SLAUGHTER.

CUT TO STAGE.  HITLER HAS OBVIOUSLY CALLED A COUNCIL OF WAR.

THE FUHRER IS SURROUNDED BY HIS GENERAL STAFF.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEY STARE STRAIGHT

AHEAD, STONY-FACED.  HUGE TEARS WELL UP IN THEIR EYES AND

RUN DOWN THEIR CHEEKS.

IS EARNESTLY GNAWING AT IT.

ENTRANCE LEADING TO THE STAGE.

CUT BACK TO STAGE.

GOEBBELS ENTERS LAUGHING.

THEY SMACK HANDS.

LAUGH FROM AUDIENCE.

CUT TO BACKSTAGE.  LIEBKIND COMES CHARGING IN LIKE A LUNATIC.

HE RUSHES FOR THE CURTAIN ROPE.  A STAGEHAND ATTEMPTS TO

STOP HIM.  HE RIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND BANGS HIM OVER THE

HEAD WITH IT.  AS HE SLUMPS TO THE GROUND, LIEBKIND UNDOES

THE CURTAIN ROPE.

CUT TO ACTORS ON STAGE.

THE CURTAIN DROPS WITH A THUD.  FROM BENEATH IT CRAWLS

LIEBKIND.  HE JUMPS UP AND ADDRESSES THE AUDIENCE.

CURTAIN STARTS TO RISE.  LIEBKIND HURLS HIMSELF IT, AND

HOLDS IT DOWN.

DESPITE HIS EFFORTS, THE CURTAIN SLOWLY RISES.  LIEBKIND

DOES NOT RELEASE HIS HOLD ON IT.  HE STARTS TO GO UP.

AS THE CURTAIN RISES, WE SEE A BEWILDERED GROUP OF ACTORS

AND STAGE HANDS WATCHING LIEBKIND'S ASCENT.  THE AUDIENCE,

THINKING LIEBKIND'S BEHAVIOR PART OF THE SHOW, ENJOYS THE

PROCEEDINGS TREMENDOUSLY.  THEY BREAK INTO APPLAUSE.

CUT TO CRITIC.  HE IS LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY AND TEARING UP

HIS NOTES.

CUT BACK TO LIEBKIND.

LIEBKIND DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLIES.

DISSOLVE TO ANTEROOM OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM'S OFFICE.  DAY.

ULLA, WEARING A BELTED RAINCOAT, SITS AT THE TYPEWRITER.

MUSIC FROM A RECORD PLAYER SOFTLY ROCKS IN THE BACKGROUND.

IN HER LEFT HAND SHE HOLDS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, FROM WHICH

SHE SIPS, WHILE HER RIGHT HAND, INDEX FINGER EXTENDED, STABS

AT THE FUNNY LITTLE KEYS.  SHE IS HAPPY, IT IS THE RIGHT ONE.

THE DOOR FLIES OPEN.  THE DESPERATE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM

ENTER.  ULLA LEAPS UP, QUICKLY UNDOES HER RAINCOAT, EXPOSING

HER DELICIOUS BODY, CLOTHED ONLY IN BLACK LACE UNDERTHINGS.

ULLA IMMEDIATELY TURNS UP RECORD PLAYER TO A CRASHING BLARE

AND DOES HER GROOVY DANCE.  BIALYSTOCK HOWLS IN DESPAIR AND

FLEES INTO HIS OFFICE TOGETHER WITH BLOOM.

HE CLOSES THE DOOR, SHUTTING OUT THE NOISE.  THE OFFICE IS

FILLED WITH FLOWERS AND CONGRATULATORY TELEGRAMS.  BIALYSTOCK

SWOOPS DOWN ON THE TELEGRAMS.  HE RIPS ONE OPEN AND BEGINS

READING.

HE TEARS IT UP AND THROWS IT AWAY.  HE PICKS UP ANOTHER AND

READS.

HE THROWS IT AWAY.  BIALYSTOCK ATTACKS THE PILE OF TELEGRAMS.

WITHOUT OPENING THEM UP, HE TEARS THEM ONE AT A TIME.

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.  POSED IN THE DOORWAY IS ROGER DE BRIS.

IN ONE HAND HE CARRIES AN OPEN, BUBBLING MAGNUM OF CHAMPAGNE.

HE STARTS INTO THE ROOM.  BIALYSTOCK GROWLS AND LUNGES AT HIM.

HE SMASHES DE BRIS UP AGAINST THE WALL.  THE CHAMPAGNE GOES

FLYING.

BIALYSTOCK THROWS HIM OUT, SLAMS THE DOOR AND LOCKS IT.  HE

FALLS INTO THE CHAIR AND PUTS HIS FEET UP ON THE DESK.

BIALYSTOCK IS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT BLOOM IS DOING STRANGE

THINGS AT THE NEXT DESK.

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS FEVERISHLY PILING LEDGERS AND ACCOUNT

BOOKS TOGETHER.  HE SWOOPS THEM UP IN HIS ARMS, CLUTCHES

THEM TIGHTLY AND BEGINS BACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR.

HE TURNS THE KNOB.  THE DOOR IS LOCKED.  HE FIDDLES WITH THE

CATCH.  TOO LATE!  BIALYSTOCK IS UP AND AT HIM IN A FLASH.

HE BLOCKS THE DOOR.

BIALYSTOCK LUNGES AT BLOOM AND GRABS FOR THE BOOKS.  BLOOM

STILL RETAINS A FIRM HOLD.  THEY STRUGGLE BACK AND FORTH.

WITH A MIGHTY WRENCH, BIALYSTOCK RIPS THE BOOKS OUT OF

BLOOM'S HANDS.

BLOOM FLIPS.  HE ATTACKS BIALYSTOCK LIKE A CRAZY KID,

SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY AND PUNCHING WITH ONE ARM AS HE

PROTECTS HIS FACE WITH THE OTHER.

BIALYSTOCK GOES CRASHING TO THE FLOOR UNDER THE ONSLAUGHT.

BLOOM DIVES ON TOP OF HIM.  THEY ROLL ON THE FLOOR LOCKED IN

MORTAL COMBAT.  SUDDENLY THREE SHOTS RING OUT IN SUCCESSION.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IMMEDIATELY STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND

TURN TOWARD THE DOOR.

CUT TO LOCK AND HANDLE OF DOOR.  THEY DROP OFF.  A LITTLE

SMOKE RISES FROM THE HOLE.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

CUT TO THE DOOR.  IT FLIES OPEN.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS

FRANZ LIEBKIND, SMOKING LUGER IN HAND.

HE BLASTS AWAY.  THE WINDOW IS SHATTERED.  PIECES OF WALL GO

WHIZZING THROUGH THE AIR.  BIALYSTOCK DROPS THE LEDGERS AND

HE AND BLOOM DIVE FOR COVER BEHIND THE DESK.

CUT TO TIGHT TWO SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCRUNCHED

BEHIND DESK.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT.  THERE

IS A TIMOROUS KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

SHE CONTINUES WALKING UNTIL SHE SEES THEM CROUCHED BEHIND

THE DESK.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN DISBELIEF.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER,

DUMBFOUNDED.

ULLA REPEATS TO HERSELF AS SHE STARTS FOR THE DOOR.

SHE EXITS AND CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.

BIALYSTOCK LOOKS UP TO THE FATES AND MAKES A SMALL SOUND OF

DESPAIR.

HE PLACES THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN AGAINST HIS TEMPLE.  BLOOM

AND BIALYSTOCK PEER OVER THE DESK TO SEE.

HE PULLS THE TRIGGER.  CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.  THE GUN IS

JAMMED.  HE THROWS THE GUN DOWN IN DISGUST.

HE FALLS INTO A CHAIR AND SOBS LIKE A CHILD.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM COME OUT FROM BEHIND DESK.  BIALYSTOCK

LOOKS AT HIS WATCH.

BIALYSTOCK PICKS UP LUGER.

LIEBKIND AND COMFORTINGLY PATS HIM ON THE SHOULDER.

LIEBKIND STARTS TO GO.

HE LEAPS ACROSS THE ROOM AND WRENCHES THE GUN FROM LIEBKIND'S

HAND.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM.  HIS EYES NARROW AS HE SERIOUSLY

CONSIDERS THE PROPOSAL.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP LIEBKIND.  HIS FACE A POSTER OF SHINING

APPROVAL.

CAMERA PULLS BACK.  THE THREE OF THEM SEARCH EACH OTHER'S

FACES EARNESTLY.  THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY IN ACCORD.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN.  DARKENED CELLAR OF THEATRE.  WE SEE THE FAINT GLOW

OF A SHIELDED LAMP AT THE END OF A TUNNEL.  AS THE CAMERA

MOVES THROUGH TUNNEL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, WE MAKE

OUT THE SHADOWY FORMS OF THREE MEN.

CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND.

BLOOM IS HOLDING A MINER'S LAMP.  LIEBKIND IS TRYING BRICK

LOOSE FROM WALL.  BIALYSTOCK IS CONSULTING MAP.  BRICK COMES

LOOSE.  LIEBKIND REMOVES IT.

THEY START UP THE STAIRS.

BLOOM SHINES LIGHT ON FUSE.

LIEBKIND TAKES A WOODEN MATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET.

HE STRIKES THE MATCH AND LIGHTS THE FUSE.  WHOOSH!  IT

IGNITES.  THE SPARKS RUSH TOWARD THE MASTER CONNECTION.

LIEBKIND CHARGES DOWN THE STAIRS AND CHASES AFTER THE QUICK

BURNING FUSE FOR ALL HE'S WORTH.  HE CATCHES UP WITH IT JUST

BEFORE IT REACHES THE MASTER CONNECTION AND QUICKLY STAMPS

IT OUT.

HE TROTS BACK.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM COME CRAWLING OUT FROM BEHIND STAIRS.

LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND SHOWS THEM A ROLL OF

HE WRAPS THE FUSE LEAD AROUND THE METAL CONTACT POLE AND

RAISES THE PLUNGER.

HE RUNS TO THE END OF THE ALLEY.  LOOKS BOTH WAYS AND RUNS

BACK.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CROUCH DOWN AND HOLD THEIR EARDRUMS.

LIEBKIND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR.  HIS EYES

SUDDENLY GLISTEN WITH TEARS.

LIEBKIND TENSES HIMSELF FOR THE PLUNGE.  HE STARTS AND STOPS.

HE SOBS INCONSOLABLY.  BIALYSTOCK ROUGHLY PUSHES HIM ASIDE

AND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR AND PLUNGES IT DOWN.

HE HURLS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND COVERS HIS HEAD IN

ANTICIPATION OF THE EXPLOSION.  NOTHING HAPPENS.  AFTER A

WHILE THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HEADS CURIOUSLY.

LIEBKIND GOES TO PLUNGER, RAISES HANDLE AND EXAMINES
