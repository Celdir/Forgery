FADE IN:

As the OPENING TTTLES ROLL against a series of shots of

statues and paintings of former presidents, we HEAR shards of

dialogue from various presidential speeches.

MAIN TITLES END ON

EXT. BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come

over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment

before we

INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY

A SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private

elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff.

Another AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is

followed a step or two later by

PRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD.

SHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy,

professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old.

JANIE starts to make a note.

SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...

The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32,

LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It

would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night,

though that doesn't seem to slow him down.

LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the

double doors leading to the South Lawn.

The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down

the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West

Wing.

They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.

Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting,

JANIE quickly and quietly said--

SHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held

open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make

their way through the corridors of

INT. THE WEST WING - DAY

They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES

AND OFFICE WORKERS.

SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--

SHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.

Another STAFFER crosses their path--

Once out of earshot--

And, with that, they walk through a doorway and into

INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

In the OUTER OFFICE, MRS. CHAPIL, the President's secretary,

is hard at work on a word processor. She stands as SHEPHERD

walks in--

And by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has

gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight

briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used

to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading,

listening, and talking at the same time.

This from ROBIN McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the

President's press secretary, as she strides into the room.

This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a

separate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition

to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor,

he's the President's closest and oldest friend.

A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on

pedestrian collision in the outer office--

LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House

pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along

with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's

Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close

over the past few years.

Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...

SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a

temper.

The meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Thank

you, Mr. President"'s as they exit.

EXT. THE WASHINGTON BUSINESS DISTRICT - DAY

It's around 10 o'clock the same morning as the capital district,

in its own way, is showing signs of the approaching Thanksgiving

and Christmas holidays.

EXT. A CHROME AND GLASS BUILDING - DAY

On the seventh floor of the building. A RECEPTIONIST tells us

where we are by answering the phone--

INT. LEO SOLOMON'S OFFICE - DAY

LEO, a white-haired man in his early 60's is meeting with

SUSAN SLOAN, a 40'ish lawyer who seems to go out of her way

to create an issue where none exists.

INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

SHEPHERD and LEWIS -- working on a speech.

JANIE steps in--

The words came out casually, but they instantly freeze everyone.

INT. THE RESIDENCE - DAY

We HEAR the sound of a TROMBONE being played--not well--from

one of the rooms. SHEPHERD comes around and down the corridor.

He walks into--

INT. LUCY'S ROOM - DAY

LUCY, Shepherd's 12-year-old daughter, stops playing.

He hands her an old textbook ...

He gives her a kiss on the head and heads out the door.

Behind him, he hears Lucy's rendition of "Hail to the Chief."

SHEPHERD shoots her a look as we

INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT

Where SHEPHERD is finishing a meeting with the DEFENSE

SECRETARY, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS and a NATIONAL

SECURITY ADVISOR, each of whom is accompanied by at least one

DEPUTY or AIDE. A.J. is also present.

SHEPHERD and A.J. leave the Cabinet Room amidst a volley of

"good-bye" 's and "Thank you, Mr. President"'s.

They pass MRS. CHAPIL and JANIE.

SHEPHERD starts his walk from the West Wing back to the

residence.

It is the exact reverse of the path he took to the OVAL OFFICE

in the morning.

A SECRET SERVICE AGENT follows at a distance.

A.J. starts to leave. SHEPHERD stops him.

They have reached the south entrance to the White House.

SHEPHERD enters the White House.

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

It's early morning of the following day, and the grounds

outside are in full swing.

EXT. THE NORTHWEST EXECUTIVE ENTRANCE - DAY

In front of the guardhouse, Susan and her new colleague,

SYDNEY ELLEN WADE, are being cleared.

SUSAN hands the guard her license.

The GUARD BUZZES her through the gate.

SYDNEY and SUSAN begin to walk up the path toward the entrance

to the West Wing.

INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

A meeting with the EDUCATION SECRETARY, the HUD SECRETARY,

several AIDES and LEWIS is breaking up. SHEPHERD is ushering

people out.

The room has cleared...JANIE is arranging new papers on the

President's desk.

INT. A.J.'s OFFICE - DAY

SUSAN is trying to avert the inevitable--

SYDNEY -- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes,

check her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides,

instead, to hit the gas and swing away. The OTHERS are watching

this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck.

No one in the room really understands what's going on...

except A.J., who would like to take the time to admire

SYDNEY but, of course, can't.

There's an uncomfortable silence in the room...

SYDNEY's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the

direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in

person, The President of the United States.

She is frozen. Mortified. If she were capable of thought

process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on

her head right now.

SYDNEY gets up to leave. SHEPHERD escorts her out of A.J.'s

office and into the hallway.

SHEPHERD enters a doorway off of the hall. SYDNEY continues

down the hallway.

JANIE leads SYDNEY into...

INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

...where SYDNEY just stands uncomfortably, not knowing

whether to sit or stand. Waiting. Trying -- the way a jumper

on a window ledge tries not to look down -- trying not to

notice things like the JFK Desk, the Seal of the President of

the United States, the bust of Lincoln...

SHEPHERD strides in--

SYDNEY heads for the door--

SYDNEY, with as much dignity as she can muster, leaves the

Oval Office. SHEPHERD muses about what has just transpired.

INT. THE BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

SHEPHERD has converted one of the rooms on the second floor

residence. His expert shot demonstrates that playing pool is

something he does almost as well as being President. A.J.

stands to the side with his pool cue.

SHEPHERD sends the two-ball flying into the corner pocket.

A.J. assesses the table.

SHEPHERD makes the shot.

SHEPHERD lifts his cue for a moment...trying to think it

there was something he was supposed to tell A.J.

SHEPHERD, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mile.

A.J. is staring at him in disbelief.

He misses the shot.

JANIE enters--

EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET IN GEORGETOWN - NIGHT

Lined with red-brick, three-story walk-ups.

INT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A few suitcases and two or three moving cartons serve as

evidence that SYDNEY's staying with her sister BETH

temporarily.

BETH, still in hospital scrubs from a 12-hour shift, opens a

bottle of wine while SYDNEY, in a bathrobe and wet hair,

tries to get off the phone.

She hangs up.

The TELEPHONE RINGS...

SYDNEY picks up the phone--

SYDNEY doesn't recognize the voice--

SYDNEY looks at BETH and rolls her eyes, then explains to

her--

And we CROSS-CUT between SYDNEY and SHEPHERD.

SYDNEY hangs up the phone.

INT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

as SHEPHERD, undaunted, dials the number again.

INT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

as the PHONE RINGS.

She picks up the phone.

And we begin CROSS-CUTTING again between the two.

SHEPHERD hangs up.

INT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

SYDNEY's still holding the phone and seems a little

confused...an emotion which is about to be replaced by horror

as the unbelievable into the reality.

She dials.

The OPERATOR answers.

SYDNEY swallows.

INT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

He's just opened a bottle of beer when the phone rings.

He picks up the phone--

There's a long silence on the phone.

They hang up.

EXT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

INT. THE CRIME BILL WAR ROOM - DAY

A large conference room at OEOB has been converted for the

use of a half-dozen STAFFERS as well as ten or twelve

interns, some of them high school age. A sign on a

corkboard reads, "17 Votes in 69 Days."

The two numbers are written on two separate pads of paper so

that the top sheets can be torn off to reveal the following

numbers in descending order.

There is also a bulletin board that lists every member of the

House of Representatives and is divided up into five columns:

FOR, LEANING TOWARDS, UNDECIDED, LEANING AGAINST, and AGAINST.

Two INTERNS raise their hands--

LEWIS comes in.

LEWIS reaches to the tote board and pulls the "17" off,

revealing "16."

INT. FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY

A GDC conference room that SYDNEY, her assistant, DAVID, and

two INTERNS have made into their 72-day headquarters. A

similar tote board reads "23 Votes in 69 Days."

The two interns are marking spreadsheets. DAVID is on one

phone, SYDNEY is on another.

LISA, another intern, is hanging up a phone in the background

and crossing to the corkboard.

She rips the "23" off, making it "22." SYDNEY reaches for

her coffee and knocks over a cup of pencils. In righting the

pencils, she knocks over her coffee.

With that, a big pile of papers is sent flying off the desk.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

It's a beautiful night. The White House, lit up and shimmering

in its golden glow, would appear now to be exactly what the

poet was looking at when he described The Shining City on a

Hill.

Limousines, several of which fly the flag of foreign

diplomats, pull up one by one, their doors opened by white-

gloved MARINES.

White lights from television cameras mix with the fireworks

of flashbulbs from the print media.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

The GUESTS -- of whom there are a couple hundred -- in black tie

and evening gowns, are entering the receiving area.

All this happening, of course, under the eye of the SECRET

SERVICE AGENTS, both American and French, who are

strategically placed throughout.

The light from a TV camera comes on as a reporter begins a

quick stand-up interview with ROBERT RUMSON, a handsome man

in his late forties.

INT. SHEPHERD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lucy is standing behind her father, tying his bow tie.

He looks in the mirror.

INT. EAST WING ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Dressed in formal, but not festive, clothes and holding, as

always, her notepad, JANIE waits by the door.

A SECRET SERVICE AGENT sits alone behind a small desk.

The door opens and SYDNEY walks in. She's, needless to say,

stunning.

INT. SITTING HALL/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

This formal reception area is filled with special GUESTS. As

SYDNEY walks in, A.J. goes to her immediately.

SHEPHERD approaches SYDNEY.

ESTHER, MACINERNERY, A.J.'S wife, joins them.

The French President, D'ASTIER, and his WIFE approach.

SHEPHERD's guests make their way out of the residence,

leaving SHEPHERD with SYDNEY and the FRENCH PRESIDENT and

MDME. D'ASTIER.

INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are walking down the staircase that leads

to the red-carpeted hall through which the President enters

the East Room.

The GROUP escorting the President gives them wide berth so

that the two of them can have some privacy.

After a slight pause--

And all of a sudden an INCREDIBLE SOUND from inside the East

Room--

--The Marine Corps Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays four

ruffles and flourishes.

A BOOMING VOICE over the P.A. announces--

And now -- the whole walk timing out with incredible precision --

--SHEPHERD walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion

Ensemble plays HAIL TO THE CHIEF.

The 180 GUESTS come to their feet and applaud long and loud.

The GROUP following the President catches up to the spot

where SYDNEY has stopped walking. They all join in the

applause. We can see in SYDNEY's face that she's been quite

swept up.

INT. EAST ROOM - NIGHT

The room is beautifully appointed, with the Marine Corps

Dance Band playing dinner music -- and the SECRET SERVICE

strategically positioned.

AT SHEPHERD'S TABLE

STEWARDS are clearing away the main course and refilling wine

glasses.

In addition to the two main couples, and ESTHER MacINERNEY

and TWO OTHER COUPLES are seated at the President's table.

SHEPHERD stands, holds out his hand to SYDNEY.

SHEPHERD and SYDNEY move to the dance floor, accompanied by

the appreciative "oooh's" and "ahh's" of the GUESTS.

The dance band begins, and SYDNEY and SHEPHERD dance...

...beautifully.

THE GUESTS

each and every one of them, have stopped all conversation and

are fixating on this captivating sight. As we go around the

room, we can observe the subtle reactions of, at first,

various anonymous GUESTS, then

A.J. AND ESTHER MACINERNEY,

holding hands smiling as they watch their old friend, and we

RUMSON'S TABLE

where the Minority Leader's game face can barely conceal the

gears that have slowly begun to turn in his head, as we

SHEPHERD AND SYDNEY DANCING

LEWIS AND ROBIN

looking on from the back of the room.

As PEOPLE start onto dance floor, we

INT. A BLACK LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

as it pulls away from the White House and into the night. In

the back, SYDNEY slips a shoe off and rubs her foot.

She smiles, then turns around to look out the back window as

the White House slips out of view.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY IN THE LIFE

INT. OUTER OFFICE OF THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

MRS. CHAPIL and JANIE are at their respective desks as

SHEPHERD walks in.

He heads into the office.

INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

where LEWIS and ROBIN are waiting anxiously.

JANIE enters and hands SHEPHERD a piece of paper.

She exits.

LEWIS and ROBIN exit the Oval Office. SHEPHERD picks up the

phone.

SHEPHERD dials the phone number JANIE's given him.

LEWIS and ROBIN

INT. LEO SOLOMON'S OFFICE - DAY

SYDNEY enters.

LEO produces a copy of the morning paper, which has a photo

of SHEPHERD and SYDNEY dancing.

There's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's SECRETARY steps in

with a strange-looking package.

SYDNEY begins unwrapping the package.

SYDNEY can't stifle her laugh -- she sees what the gift is.

SYDNEY's smile fades away...she looks at LEO.

EXT. THE NORTHWEST EXECUTIVE ENTRANCE - DAY

as the white-gloved MARINE snaps the door open for SYDNEY,

and we

INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

SHEPHERD is conferring with LEWIS and ROBIN.

JANIE pokes her head in.

SYDNEY enters, crossing paths with LEWIS and ROBIN. They

exchange pleasantries.

JANIE enters.

During the following, JANIE will go to the desk, pick up two

briefing books and stick them in a briefcase and gather up

his things -- all without interrupting the conversation a beat.

An AIDE has slipped in and hands SHEPHERD a note.

The AIDE (JEFF) steps back in--

And he's gone.

And, as if from out of nowhere, a LOUD CLAAAMMERING, like the

sound of a jackhammer against cement, comes from somewhere

outside -- growing louder and closer --

And, sure enough, coming into view outside the windows of the

Oval Office, is MARINE-1, the President's helicopter. JANIE

comes back in and helps him on with his coat and scarf.

As SHEPHERD rushes out...

SYDNEY now stands alone in the OVAL OFFICE, trying to figure

out what just happened.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - SOUTH LAWN - DAY

Marine 1 lifting off the south lawn. TILT DOWN off night sky

to reveal

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

INT. SITTING HALL/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

A room designed more for comfort than for show, with its

overstuffed couches.

Lucy enters.

SHEPHERD enters.

INT. A POSE HOUSE IN CHEVY CHASE - NIGHT

Two dozen limos and town cars line this suburban Maryland

street, their drivers waiting patiently.

INT. THE HOUSE IN CHEVY CHASE - NIGHT

A cocktail party is underway. This is a fat cat fundraiser

for the Republicans.

INT. THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

The look and feel of old money. Rumson is holding court with

a half-dozen political insiders. Some smoke cigars; others

sip their drinks.

And four STAFFERS grab whatever newspaper is closest to their

hand and toss them to CARL.

INT. PRIVATE OFFICE/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

LUCY, SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are finishing up a game of Scrabble.

LUCY gets up from the table and kisses her father.

LUCY leaves. SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are alone now.

After a pause...

INT. THE EAST WING - NIGHT

This is the "museum" area of the White House, the part you

see when you take the official tour. Only a few lights are

lit, and while the SECRET SERVICE AGENTS give SHEPHERD plenty

of breathing room when he's in the residence, we'll still

catch a glimpse of one of them rounding a corner in the

distance or checking a doorway ahead.

SYDNEY and SHEPHERD enter the:

INT. THE CHINA ROOM - NIGHT

Named for its beautiful glass display cases featuring full

place settings of the official White House china and

silverware from every administration since Jackson.

SYDNEY's been walking slowly around the room, looking at the

display cases, and as she gets near one of the large windows,

she takes another step which drapes her in a shaft of

incredibly flattering moonlight.

The vision isn't lost on SHEPHERD. They stare at each other

for a moment.

This last statement is not lost on SYDNEY.

He moves toward her until they are both bathed in the

moonlight. He puts his arms around her.

They lean in to kiss each other. They barely make contact

when...

An AGENT is standing in the doorway -- SHEPHERD and SYDNEY

break apart.

SHEPHERD knows what that means.

He moves out the door and into the corridor.

SYDNEY, knowing something's wrong, instinctively moves to

follow him and be with him, but the AGENT hasn't moved from

the doorway, so--

SHEPHERD comes back in.

SHEPHERD exits.

SYDNEY, alone for a second in the dish room, is finally

approached by a SECRET SERVICE AGENT, who starts to escort

her out.

INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

SHEPHERD, A.J., the SECRETARY OF STATE, the SECRETARY OF

DEFENSE, and about a dozen or so Pentagon, Security Council,

and Joint Chiefs OFFICIALS are doing exactly what they're

trained for.

There's a SILENCE. SHEPHERD gets up and starts to head out

the door.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

SHEPHERD is with A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, KODAK and a couple of

AIDES, all of whom look as though they've been called out of

their homes in the middle of the night.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

SHEPHERD is at the podium taking questions. He's flanked by

his PENTAGON STAFF. A.J. and LEWIS stand to the side. ROBIN

stands out of the way.

American personnel got there. Leslie.

SHEPHERD is herded out of the briefing room amidst a chorus

of "Mr. President" 's.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

SHEPHERD walks away from the briefing room with ROBIN. JANIE

joins him.

INT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

SHEPHERD sits at his desk, is on the phone. A TELEVISION

NEWSCAST is doing a report on Congressional reaction to the

events of the day. ROB RUMSON is talking.

He hangs up. On the TV, we see a quick sound bite from RUMSON.

SHEPHERD clicks off the TV and then stares at

A SLIP OF PAPER THAT SAYS "SYDNEY"

EXT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

SYDNEY and BETH have been getting SYDNEY moved in. BETH is

holding a carton.

The PHONE RINGS--

SYDNEY freezes.

The PHONE RINGS again.

All right. But I'm gonna end it

INT. SHEPHERD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

SHEPHERD opens his door, revealing SYDNEY. Agent COOPER is

letting her in.

SHEPHERD closes the door.

But SYDNEY doesn't take her coat off.

SYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOM/DRESSING ROOM area.

SHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a

couple of drinks.

SYDNEY comes back into the room...she's wearing one of

SHEPHERD's dress shirts and nothing else. She walks toward

him.

She moves closer to him.

They're both standing, facing each other...

They gently kiss. They just stay with it until it becomes

easier and better and exactly what they want.

INT. AN ELKS LODGE - NIGHT

A crowd of 300 or so is being whipped into a frenzy.

Rumson's bringing it home under a campaign banner

proclaiming: THE PRIDE IS BACK -- BOB RUMSON.

The CROWD goes nuts upon hearing Rumson's signature phrase--

And as the CROWD loses its mind, we

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAWN

INT. SHEPHERD'S BEDROOM - MORNING

It is very early, and SHEPHERD is still asleep. As we PULL

BACK, WE REVEAL that he is alone in his bed. The PHONE RINGS.

SHEPHERD picks it up--

He hangs up the phone and looks around the room, only to

notice SYDNEY is tiptoeing around in the dim light, trying

to quietly dress herself and gather up her things. SHEPHERD

watches this odd spectacle for a moment before he says--

SYDNEY turns around.

There's a KNOCK on the door.

LEWIS comes in--

SHEPHERD laughs at SYDNEY's purposely lame try--

ROBIN enters.

A.J. KNOCKS on the open door and walks in.

SHEPHERD regards A.J. for a moment...clearly the man planned

ahead.

LEWIS, ROBIN and A.J. say their "Thank you, Mr. President"'s

on the way out ...

A.J. leaves...

SYDNEY gives him a good-bye kiss...

She exits the bedroom.

A SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY/NIGHT

AS we move through a series of quick DISSOLVES, all M.O.S.,

we HEAR in VOICE-OVER the sounds of American's electronic

media -- network news, news magazines, gossip shows, talk

radio, political round tables, etc. -- dissecting the

"Girlfriend Factor."

INT. FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY

SYDNEY and the TEAM are in full gear. Lisa rips off another

vote on the tote board, making it "14 Votes in 51 Days."

INT. CRIME BILL WAR ROOM - DAY

The tote board reads "8 Votes in 45 Days." KODAK is pointing

to a spot on an electoral map to emphasize a point to a young

INTERN.

INT. BISTRO - NIGHT

SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are sharing what seems to be an intimate

candlelit dinner. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL a restaurant packed

with SECRET SERVICE, and PRESS outside police barricades,

shooting through the windows of the restaurant.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lucy is giving a little trombone recital for SHEPHERD and

SYDNEY. SYDNEY cheers madly at the end of the piece, giving

Lucy a big hug for her effort.

EXT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

SYDNEY exits her apartment and is once again hounded by the

press.

innocent bystanders.

EXT. GDC BUILDING - NIGHT

SYDNEY exits the building and is mobbed by the press.

EXT. MANCHESTER RAMADA - NIGHT

Establishing shot of the Ramada.

EXT. A SUITE AT THE MANCHESTER RAMADA - NIGHT

Rumson and his STAFF are buzzing about amid room service

tables and late-night take-out as STU enters the room with

a manila envelope in his hand.

Rumson is signaling for an AIDE to take over his phone call.

He hands off the phone--

Several TOP AIDES join this slightly confidential conversation.

RUMSON starts to walk away when STU pulls an 8$B!_(J10 photo from

the manila folder.

RUMSON comes back. STU hands him the photo.

RUMSON gives it one last look, passes it back to STU, and

turns back to his phone.

INT. FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY

A few more young INTERNS have been added, and most are hard

at work on the phones -- ("___ from the Global Defense

Council. We're encouraging voters in your area to phone or

write your Congressman regarding...etc.")

The tote board now reads "11 Votes in 42 Days." David is

supervising things while SYDNEY is trying to lose her

patience on the phone.

SYDNEY wads up some paper and flings it at David to shut him

up.

She hangs up.

The room CHEERS, knows what this means. DAVID rips off the

11, revealing 10.

Everyone gets back to work as SYDNEY and DAVID speak among

themselves.

EXT. THE WEST WING - DUSK

The President's motorcade sits in its formation, engines

running, waiting for its passenger.

INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DUSK

JANIE and a couple of AIDES are in a familiar routine, doing

their last-minute scrambling to get the President out the

door so that he doesn't fall behind his usual "45-minutes-

behind-schedule" schedule. SHEPHERD is on the phone at his

desk.

JANIE catches SHEPHERD's eye and makes a subtle gesture to

her wristwatch.

He hangs up.

They head to door as A.J. enters from the other side of the

office.

EXT. THE WEST WING - NIGHT

SHEPHERD is getting into the limo when LEWIS and ROBIN hurry

out to catch him.

As they do they're told, and the motorcade gets on its way.

INT. SHEPHERD'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

SHEPHERD hangs up the phone.

SHEPHERD sees something out the window and gets excited.

EXT. STREET - IN FRONT OF FLOWER SHOP - NIGHT

SHEPHERD's sudden decision sets off a chain reaction of

Secret Service activity to accommodate the change of plans.

INT. CARMEN'S HOUSE OF FLOWERS - NIGHT

A high school GIRL is behind the counter, talking to a friend

on the phone. Her back is to the door when SHEPHERD walks in

with a couple of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS scrambling to keep up.

SHEPHERD begins surveying the various flowers that are behind

the glass.

The GIRL notices, and the receiver falls from her hand as

she stares in disbelief.

And apparently it does, because the GIRL faints and falls to

the floor.

Andy's got himself a girl.

APPLAUSE and appreciative LAUGHTER from a CROWD as we

INT. MEMPHIS GRAND HYATT - NIGHT

RUMSON is speaking to a black-tie fund-raiser for the

REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP ALLIANCE.

The crowd's getting into it--

A wave building--

The RUMSON FAMILY glows from a TELEVISION in the corner.

LEWIS and ROBIN react to the news highlight reel of that

day's screw-up.

SHEPHERD's off in a corner, talking on the phone. The

Presidential Suite has been turned into the St. Louis Oval

Office for the night as STAFFERS zigzag around room service

tables during the late-night preparations.

INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

He's referring to RUMSON on the TV.

EXT. CAMP DAVID - DAY

Scattered STAFF and MARINE PERSONNEL hold their hats to their

SYDNEY, nose pressed against the window, is drinking it in.

SHEPHERD is finishing up a crossword puzzle.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are lounging in front of a fireplace,

having hot cups of something alcoholic. SYDNEY is reading a

book. SHEPHERD is running through satellite TV channels,

searching for something.

SHEPHERD has landed on a news station.

The NEWS PROGRAM goes to the segment showing RUMSON and

MICHAELS on that morning's show. SHEPHERD and SYDNEY sit and

watch...knowing they're about to take a punch...powerless to

stop it...

SHEPHERD clicks off the T.V.

He goes to kiss her, she responds.

EXT. SOUTH LAWN - NIGHT

The official White House Christmas Tree is glimmering for the

TOURISTS.

INT. RESIDENCE - NIGHT

An informal Christmas party is underway with maybe 20 GUESTS,

some of them familiar faces.

SHEPHERD and a GREEN-BLAZERED MAN

LEWIS, KODAK and ROBIN stand huddled with cups of eggnog...

AT THE BUFFET TABLE

A.J. spots SYDNEY as she walks through the doorway and comes

over to her. She seems a bit agitated.

SHEPHERD joins them.

This catches SHEPHERD and A.J. by surprise--like accidentally

drawing to an inside straight.

SYDNEY isn't aware she's said anything of particular

consequence.

A.J. and SHEPHERD are trying to study the situation without

giving anything away.

She goes off.

INT. A WASHINGTON WATERING HOLE - NIGHT

LEWIS sits with a Congressman's aide.

INT. A POSE WASHINGTON RESTAURANT - DAY

A lunchtime crowd is doing business over white wine, oysters

and cobb salads. SYDNEY, a CONGRESSMAN, and his LEGISLATIVE

AIDE are going at it.

INT. FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY

DAVID is on the phone--

DAVID rips off the top sheet of the tote board, which now

reads "5 Votes in 14 Days."

CONGRESSMAN MILLMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

MILLMAN is walking on a treadmill while LEWIS stands by.

INT. FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY

INTERNS photocopying, clipping, stamping, crunching numbers,

drinking coffee...DAVID is on an extension, listening to

SYDNEY's final pitch over the phone.

The tote board reads: "3 Votes in 5 Days."

INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

LEWIS and KODAK, each with an AIDE, have been meeting with

two CONGRESSMEN and their AIDES.

INT. A.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

LEWIS and KODAK stand in front of A.J.'s desk.

A.J. hesitates.

EXT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The street's been temporarily closed to traffic, and SECRET

SERVICE AGENTS man the sidewalk. The PRESS and ONLOOKERS

form a small crowd, kept well at bay by police barricades.

INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are finishing up dinner.

SYDNEY pops a bottle of port and pours two glasses.

SYDNEY hands him a glass. They clink glasses and sip.

CUT TO:

EXT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY - EAST

A light rain is falling.

INT. CRIME BILL WAR ROOM - DAY

KODAK sits at his desk staring at a computer printout. LEWIS

is nearing the end of a phone conversation that isn't going

well. He's pacing around with the phone...desperate and

intense.

The tote board reads: "1 Vote in 2 Days." ROBIN enters.

ROBIN and KODAK appear in the doorway, sensing a surprise

development. LEWIS is losing it on the phone.

LEWIS looks over at ROBIN and KODAK ...his face telling the

story.

ROBIN and KODAK are trying to get their friend from setting

fire to a bridge out of pure frustration.

LEWIS hangs up the phone. He takes a deep breath, slumps

down in the nearest chair, and looks up at ROBIN and KODAK.

There's a long silence before LEWIS says--

LEWIS picks up the phone and punches in a few numbers. Even

before that line starts ringing, he picks up another phone

and punches in a different set of numbers.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

SHEPHERD stands in front A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK.

JANIE is somewhere in the background.

There's a pause before ...

SHEPHERD is stopped.

There's a horrible silence in the room. SHEPHERD has locked

eyes with LEWIS.

The room is slightly stunned by what their President has just

said.

SHEPHERD picks up the polling data and heads to the door...

INT. THE FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY

SYDNEY, SUSAN, DAVID, INTERNS and STAFFERS are having a

little office celebration. Champagne flows from paper cups.

Streamers and balloons adorn the tote board, which reads 0

Votes in 1 Day.

SUSAN, maybe a little drunk, has concerned SYDNEY.

A PHONE RINGS, and one of the staffers takes it. SYDNEY

tries to rejoin the party, but--

SYDNEY holds for a moment...then heads out the door and we

INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - LATE AFTERNOON

TROMBONE MUSIC comes from LUCY's bedroom as SHEPHERD rounds

the corner.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - LATER AFTERNOON

SHEPHERD pops his head in.

INT. SHEPHERED'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

SYDNEY is going through the closet in search of something.

The door opens, and SHEPHERD steps in, perhaps a little

tentatively. He doesn't see SYDNEY at first.

SYDNEY comes out.

SYDNEY continues her search.

She starts to exit

She stops.

SYDNEY heads out the door--

And SYDNEY is out the door...

...we HOLD on SHEPHERD, looking like a man who's taken a lot

of punches to the heads...

INT. THE POOL ROOM - NIGHT

A rack of billiard balls explodes from the break.

SHEPHERD gets down over the ball--

SHEPHERD smacks the ball, BULL'S-EYE.

SHEPHERD gets down over the ball...

SMACK!!!

...but instead of the cue hitting the ball, it's A.J.'s palms

slamming the cue against the table.

SHEPHERD's tossed his cue stick and is heading out...

SHEPHERD gets to the doorway...stops...turns around...

SHEPHERD looks away...nods absently...

SHEPHERD exits, leaving A.J. alone as we

INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A series of shots showing SHEPHERD walking down the corridor

to the dish room, then walking down a long corridor which

contains a series of paintings of various presidents. Then

sitting alone in the Oval Office, lost in thought...

INT. RESIDENCE DINING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

SHEPHERD and LUCY are eating breakfast in silence, neither of

them very happy, each with their own problems. A nearby T.V.

MONITOR glows with the live coverage of ROBIN's morning press

briefing.

Finally...

He glances toward the T.V. screen. ROBIN's standing up there

doing what she's been told: "No comment...No, this President

is not participating in character debates..." He mutes the

volume.

LUCY winds herself up. It would appear she's about to burst.

She's about to say the hardest thing she's ever had to say in

her life--

SHEPHERD is stunned and totally confused...

It just starts spilling out in a stream--

SHEPHERD is silent...totally blown away...he had absolutely

no idea...

He stands up slowly and moves toward her...LUCY doesn't know

what's coming...

LUCY gets up slowly...

She's never seen her father like this...

SHEPHERD knees down, cups her daughter's face in his hands,

and gently kisses her forehead. He pulls her to him and

holds her in a tight embrace...

LUCY squeezes her dad tight...they hold the embrace for a

long moment.

between you and the Bob Rumsons of

SHEPHERD trails off, realizing he's about to quote Sydney...

And now it's as if SHEPHERD is waking himself up from the

longest trip of his life...

...he looks over at the T.V. monitor..."No comment"...

"No, I don't know how many other ways I can say it. The

White House isn't getting involved in..."

He heads for the door, shouting out as he goes--

And he's gone as we...

INT. THE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

ROBIN is on her last drops of energy and patience.

But instead of hands going up, the PRESS CORPS suddenly

stands. ROBIN turns to see SHEPHERD stride in and step up to

the podium.

SHEPHERD takes the podium. There's a palpable BUZZ in the

room as video operators adjust their equipment, etc. People

starts to stand.

ANGLE - ROBIN

who's picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in

four numbers.

She turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the

rest of the room.

LEWIS enters with A.J. and KODAK.

SHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his

wake.

The MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS. They're talking

among themselves, confirming that they just saw what they

just saw. ROBIN steps to the podium.

INT. HALLWAY - WEST WING - DAY

A.J. and LEWIS are following after the President.

LEWIS goes off in one direction. A.J. heads towards the Oval

Office.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

SHEPHERD is on the phone.

A.J. enters.

SHEPHERD doesn't need to turn around to know who's standing

in the doorway, but of course he does anyway.

A.J. exits.

SYDNEY and SHEPHERD just gaze at each other for a moment and

smile. SYDNEY starts toward him.

They move to kiss. It doesn't last very long because...

JANIE enters--

MRS. CHAPIL enters--

EXT. THE CAPITOL - NIGHT

It's lit up and glowing on this cold, clear night.

INT. A VIP ROOM - NIGHT

It's off the main corridor, and it's being used as a green

room for SHEPHERD and his group -- LEWIS, KODAK, A.J., JANIE,

and various AIDES and STAFFERS. People are buzzing around in

a last-minute flurry. SHEPHERD is fumbling with his cuff

links.

LUCY takes his sleeves.

ROBIN steps in.

The PEOPLE in the room start to gather their things and exit,

ROBIN handling any and all last-minute "Mr. President"'s as

she herds people out the door.

LUCY walks past SHEPHERD. She holds SHEPHERD's old tattered

textbook and has it opened to a specific page...

SHEPHERD looks at his old friend and extends his hand for a

deeply-felt handshake. A.J. grasps SHEPHERD's hand and then

pulls him into a strong embrace.

A.J. whispers a shout into SHEPHERD's ear--

A.J. pulls away, leaving SHEPHERD to enjoy the moment without

having to speak--

The room clears out...revealing SYDNEY, dressed like the

First Lady she's soon to be, sitting against the window sill.

SHEPHERD has picked his black canvas gym bag with the gold

Presidential seal.

He reaches in the bag and pulls out a bouquet of flowers.

JANIE pokes her head in.

They exit into a hallway lined with Congressional STAFFERS,

SECRET SERVICE, CAPITOL SECURITY, WHITE HOUSE STAFF, and,

most prominently, A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, JANIE and KODAK.

SYDNEY is still clutching her flowers as they near the double

doors to the House Chamber--

SYDNEY is stopped in her tracks as--

--the doors to the Chamber fly open--

The CHAMBER leaps to its feet in a thunderous ovation,

shouts of "Bravo!" from the gallery...

At the back, LEWIS and ROBIN and KODAK are trying to maintain

their professional cool, but it's a moment impossible not to

get caught up in...SYDNEY is clutching her flowers with both

hands...SHEPHERD is making his way down the aisle, shaking

hands and receiving congratulations and good wishes, and we

FADE OUT.
