Three Men and a Baby

1   INT. AIRPLANE - DAY                                        1

Jack gets up and Paul takes his place at the controls.

Jack makes his way up the aisle, through the girls who

are blocking the way, to the object of his affections.

She is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing

her head off. Jack leans over and whispers, quickly and

intensely, to her.

Jack kneels down before her, and the Girl looks at him,

amused. He takes her hand and places it over his heart.

He hands her his business card.

The Girl laughs as Jack goes on. Meanwhile, the Busi-

nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has

gotten up and walked over to Jack.

The Businessman disappears in the direction of the

cockpit.

The Businessman has reached the cockpit.

He hands Paul a man's purse.

Jack returns.

The Businessman goes back to his seat and Jack grabs

hold of the microphone.

Everyone shouts "HOORAY!" except for Paul and the

2   INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - PASSENGER TERMINAL - DAY              2

A very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with

cart overflowing with luggage. One of them falls off.

He's about to walk off when Paul grabs him by the arm.

Jack races toward the woman and begins to help her

with the fallen luggage. We see him talking to her

and we can hear a little of what he's saying.

He kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart.

The young woman is flabbergasted.

A lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus.

3   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                    3

He moves away towards the den.

Michael walks off in the direction of Rosalie.

Paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find Jack,

he sees PETER who is talking with another young woman,

NICOLE. Peter is nodding, idly looking around, com-

pletely uninterested in the conversation.

Peter isn't paying attention.

Nicole laughs.

They move away.

Paul walks off in Jack's direction. We STAY WITH Peter,

who reaches Natalie. She is talking with a very styl-

ishly-dressed, tall, young man, CARL.

Paul comes up to Jack, who is kneeling before Clementine,

whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear. It

appears he's gotten beyond the "This is love at first

sight" stage. He's getting down to the nitty-gritty

now. Clementine is thrilled. Paul taps Jack on the

shoulder.

He disappears with Paul.

With some difficulty, Paul follows Jack as he picks his

way through the people dancing, heading in Rosalie's

direction.

Yeah... What kind of favor?

Damn, I've got to get her

a glass of champagne.

Listen, I've got a little problem.

I'm having a valuable package

delivered to me on Sunday, but I'm

not going to be home. I've got to

do the Hawaii-Tahiti-Australia

route, so can I have the package

delivered here instead?

Yeah, sure, of course.

No, wait, I'm leaving for South

America tomorrow. I'll be gone

for three weeks.

But it's okay. Peter and Michael

will be here. They'll take care

of it.

Will you be sure to tell them

about it?

Absolutely.   Don't worry about

a thing.

It'll be delivered Sunday and

picked up next Thursday, okay?

Delivered Sunday picked up

Thursday. Got it. No problem.

This is a very delicate matter,

Jack. It's very important they

don't tell anybody about this

package. It could be very... uh,

embarrassing for me, you know

what I'm saying?

Sure. You got it.    I'll see you

later...

4   INT. APARTMENT - FEW HOURS LATER - NIGHT                   4

She has already left.   The door closes on the last of the

departing guests.

Peter and Michael go into the living room. Peter is

picking up glasses. Michael is emptying ashtrays into

the wastebasket.

5   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                     5

Jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits, singing.

He makes up a tray with sandwiches.

Peter and Michael look at one another surprised, mouthing

silently, "Maxine?"

11   INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY                            11

No shit.

'Dearest Jack, here is the fruit

of our love. Take good care of

her. I have to go to Europe and

Japan for six months, her name is

Mary. Good luck, Love, Sylvia.'

What are we going to do with it?

Give it back to her mother, that's

what.

But it says she went to Europe.

Well, we'll see about that, d'you

have her phone number?

Whose phone number?

The girl's... Sylvia's...

Why the hell would I have her

number? I've never even heard

of this chick!

You mean you don't know who she

is?

No way. If I had to keep track

of all Jack's girlfriends, I'd

have to be a full-time secretary.

Well, what are we gonna do?

Hey, look, she's waking up...

Hey, look, she's crying...

Oh no, this can't be happening!

She's not gonna start to cry now?!

Uh-oh, now she's really crying!

What's her problem?

Maybe she's hungry?

Well, what are we s'posed to do?

Feed her, I guess...

Yeah, but what?

Soft stuff... I guess.

Oh no, I swear to God this is

unreal! Can you believe that

bastard Jack?! 'A little package,'

he tells me on the phone, 'just

put it aside till Thursday.' Put

it aside -- can you believe him!?

Really?   Jack said that?

Yeah and he also said 'don't tell

anyone about it -- anyone at all.'

Oh, so he told you about this?

Yeah, he told me a package would

be coming today, but he didn't

say it'd be this!

Boy, he's got a helluva nerve!

Just listen to the racket she's

making! What are we s'posed to

do?

Let's call Jack's mother!

Michael finishes the sentence in unison with him.

Peter steps over the basket and heads towards the

elevator.

Depends on what your pediatrician

recommends.

Oh right, the pediatrician...

But which one sells the most?

This kind.

Oh, so this is the best kind?

It's the cheapest.

Then it's the worst kind?

They're all good, sir.

Oh, okay, then I can take this

kind.

It's got iron in it.

Oh.   Is that good or bad?

It's very good.

Well, why don't they all have

iron in them?

Some babies are allergic to iron.

Oh, okay, well I'll take this

kind then.

That kind doesn't have any milk

in it.

16   INT. SAFEWAY - DAY                                         16

But didn't those friends of

yours tell you how old she was?

I told you they had to leave

unexpectedly.

Or else you could weigh her; that

would tell you how old she is.

See, my five-month-old grandson

weighs more than my neighbor's

grandson and he's nine months old.

So, y'know, how much they weigh...

doesn't mean a thing.

So what about me? What should I

buy?

Didn't they even tell you the

pediatrician's name?

No.   They didn't.

You sure have weird friends.

You have no idea how weird.

Or else her hair. Does she have

lots of hair?

My grandson, y'know, he has so

much hair you can make a ponytail

with it! And I know some kids

who are totally bald at a year-

and-a-half. So, y'know, how much

hair they have... doesn't mean a

thing...

Gee, he's really something, your

grandson -- is he good at math

too?

17   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                      17

Michael starts to close the door.    She pushes it back

open and holds out the package.

The apartment Manager has already given Michael the

package and grabbed Mary. She covers her with kisses.

Mary smiles. Michael absent-mindedly looks at the

package.

19   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                      19

Peter attempts to look into Mary's mouth but she squirms.

Peter slides his finger over Mary's gums.

Peter starts off toward the kitchen, Michael follows.

Michael hands him a diaper.        Peter tries to figure out

how it goes on.

Peter tries to slide the diaper under Mary's backside

but she squirms and kicks it off with her feet.

Michael holds Mary under    her armpits.     Peter tries to put

the diaper on her. It's     hard. What's     more, it would

seem that Michael didn't    buy the right    size -- The

diaper comes all the way    up to Mary's    chin.

Peter has more or less managed to adjust the diaper.

He tapes the diaper closed.

Peter turns and walks toward the basket.

Peter has returned with the basket. The Punks look at

the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief.

Punk #1 hears "powder" and catches on.

He hands them the basket.    Punk #1 grabs the handles.

He passes the basket to Punk #2

They start to leave, pressing the elevator button.

The Punks exchange a puzzled glance.

The elevator has arrived.    The Punks quickly slip inside

it with the basket.

Michael closes the door.

Peter plops down in the armchair by the front door.

He disappears in the direction of his room.

Peter is sitting    on something hard. He pulls it out from

under him, it's    a package. He looks at it, casually

reading: "Care     of Jack Collins." He tosses it to the

side. Suddenly,     it dawns on him. He leaps up, grabs

the package and    runs into Michael's room.

59   EXT. STREET - DAY                                           59

Peter comes rushing out of the building.

Peter takes the package from his pocket and is about

to grab the basket. Punk #1 pushes him back violently.

He discreetly reveals a switchblade knife he's carrying.

Punk #2 is about to get on the motorcycle.   Peter stops

him.

Peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket. A

patrol car comes up next to them, right beside the car

in which Graton is sitting, taking in every bit of the

action.

One of the COPS gets out of his car and comes over to the

Punks and Peter. Peter is scared stiff.

No one answers.

As he speaks, Peter undoes the bungie cord from around

the basket and takes it off the motorcycle.

Punk #1 gives him a dirty look.

The punks exchange a glance.   Suddenly Punk #1 shouts:

They take off running in different directions. Cop #1

charges after Punk #1 and yells to his partner who's

still in the car:

Cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand.

Peter stiffens with fear.

They disappear inside the building. Peter is carrying

the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched

on the horrible package hidden in his pocket.

Just then Cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed.

Graton gets out of his car and comes up to Cop #1, show-

ing him his badge.

60   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                      60

He takes out the package.

Michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to

climb out it when Peter stops him.

He starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back.

Michael disappears. Peter picks up Mary, grabs his  wal-

let and leaves the room. When he gets to the hall,  he

discovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is

whispering something. Peter holds his license out  for

them to see.

Agent #1 looks in his attache case.

The PHONE RINGS.

Agent #1 picks up the phone and listens.

Agent #1 hands him the phone.

Agent #1 gestures to Agent #3 to take a look around the

apartment. Agent #3 slips away.

Agent #1 picks up the other telephone.

65   INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - DAY                                  65

He goes back to the living room, followed by Agent #3.

Agent #1 is in the process of showing Peter a photograph.

Peter looks: it's the photo of Jack and Paul that was

taken at the beginning of the movie.

Michael has laid Mary down for a nap in her basket,

observed by the five cops. He now sits down, cheerful

and bubbling over with enthusiasm.

Agent #1 totally ignores him.

All the cops head for the door. Michael accompanies

them, putting on a very urbane act.

Once the cops are gone, Michael races back to the living

room. Peter has collapsed into his armchair.

Michael points to Mary's bottom.

Peter waits with the basket.   Michael tiptoes to the

corner of the corridor.

At the very end of the corridor, on Mrs. Razzolini's

doorstep, he sees the three narcotics Agents talking with

Mrs. Razzolini. We can hear snippets of their

conversation.

Michael hastily returns to Peter, still on tiptoes. He

leads him back to the elevator and pushes the elevator

button.

The elevator has arrived meanwhile.

They rush into the elevator.

He leaves.   A second later, he comes back.

He leaves; a second later, he comes back.

He leaves.   A second later, he comes back.

Michael takes the basket handle from  Peter's hand, places

the basket carefully on the bed, and  walks without a word

towards Jack, who he takes by the arm  and steers into the

living room. Peter softly shuts the   door behind them and

follows.

Michael leans over Mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti-

tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside

him. He puts the clean diaper on her.

Graton, nervous and wary,   watches Michael and the

passersby. Just then, two    punks (Peter and Jack) come

running up to Michael. He    ostensibly takes the brown

package out of his plastic   bag and gives it to them.

The two punks immediately take off with the package.

Graton leaps up, shouts "let's get 'em" and takes off

after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes

detectives, who'd been hiding all around.

Michael quickly gets up,    picks Mary up and discreetly

deposits the dope-filled    diaper in a trash can, giving

the punk on the bench an    intent look. Then he goes off

in the direction of the    cops.

The punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the

diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and

goes off in the opposite direction.

The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put

up no resistance whatsoever. Michael now joins them.

The cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate

Easter bunnies. Graton is mortified. He crushes all

the bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate

inside them.

Peter and Jack take off their glasses.

I am!

How 'bout Jack?

On his way to Miami.

Oh, yeah. He's got a lot of

nerve! Leaving us with the kid

again...

No, he took Mary to his mother's,

she couldn't wait to see her.

He's gonna try to unload her on

her till Sylvia gets back. I

made her four bott...

You're kidding! That son-of-a-

bitch!

Don't worry, I told him everything

he had to know, and I made her

four bott...

Oh, I'm telling you, that guy is

really starting to get on my

nerves!

Why?

Goddamn him! He really could

have called me!

Are you pissed off 'cause she's

gone?

Of course not! What, are you

crazy? I'm relieved! Thank God

she's out of here!

I made her four bott...

Oh, yeah?   How do you figure that?

Shouldn't I be discussing all this

with the father?

Well, listen, Mrs. Fretsaw, umm...

Brainsore...

Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.

Right... Bratsnot, lemme tell

you something. With a child you

always know who the mother is,

but the father -- that's another

kettle of fish. So don't give me

that bullshit, okay?

Very well. I won't discuss it any

further with you. Will you please

show me where the kitchen and the

bathroom are?

What for?

So I can make you a list of the

things we need.

What do you mean, make you a list?

-- Don't you do the shopping

yourself?

No shopping or laundry or

housekeeping. I am a professional

nanny.

We have plenty of everything.

Do you have a sufficient amount

of fruit and vegetables for the

child?

She only eats milk and cereal.

That's not enough, sir. From

the age of three months children

should be started on a normal,

varied diet.

Oh that's bullshit. You don't

feed a baby like an adult.

Oh, really? And how would you

know?

I've read plenty of books. The

diet recommended by those quack

pediatricians today is way too

rich. I'm in favor of natural

methods, Mrs. Breathmint.

Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.

For instance, if a child is having

trouble getting to sleep, what

would you do?

Depends, if it was a continuing

problem, I might recommend a

mild sedative...

I knew you'd say something like

that, you jerk!

Fine. Anything you     say, sir.

Let me just remind    you that I have

my diploma and that    medicine is

a serious matter.

Do you know the song that goes

'Medicine's a whore and the

pharmacist is her pimp'?

No, I don't. We must listen to

different music. Personally I'm

very fond of opera.

Here we go.

Look,  her mother'll be back in

less  than five months. Let's not

waste  a shitload of time looking

for a  solution for such a short

time.   Let's get organized.

What do you mean, organized?

Well, you'll have to ask to fly

the New York-Washington shuttle

for five months, on account of

serious personal problems.

What? Never! I'd rather be a

subway conductor.

Then dump her in an orphanage,

'cause there's no way we're gonna

take care of her all by ourselves

anymore!

Come on, stop arguing, you two!

Jack, you're going to have to

ask to do the New York-Washington

shu...

No!   Never.

That way, you can do the 6-10 A.M.

shift. That amounts to two bottles

and two diaper changes. You do

the shopping when you get home in

the evening and that's all. Peter,

you'll take the 6-10 P.M. shift.

That's two bottles and two diaper

changes, her bath and her laundry.

Since I work at home I'll take

the longest shift from 10 A.M. to

6 P.M. I'll take her to the park

for an hour, but that's it. No

shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.

What if she gets up at night?

She stops at the door to the living room and contemplates

the three men who are singing earnestly around the crib.

Peter and Michael stare at her, scandalized. Jack

gestures wildly to her to shut up and go away.

She goes back to Jack's room.

He exits, furious. Peter and Jack follow after him.

Fuming, they file one after the other down the corridor

past the stunned Brunette in her T-shirt who was waiting

for Jack by the door to his room. The three guys close

the kitchen door and start yelling at each other. They

all talk at once.

Meanwhile, the Brunette has put her clothes back on and

gathered up her belongings. Now she enters the kitchen.

heard CRYING.

Peter, Jack, and Michael exchange glances.    Jack rushes

out. The guests haven't heard anything.

Jack returns to the table.   Peter's eyes follow him

nervously.

He shuts the MUSIC OFF.   MARY keeps on SCREAMING.

Peter takes MARY on his lap.    The SCREAMING CONTINUES.

Peter gets up and walks around.      Jack and Michael,

standing, watch him walk.

MARY SCREAMS even LOUDER as Peter walks back and forth

in the room with her. The guests watch in uncomfortable

silence.

The guests remain silent.

MARY'S CRYING fills the room.

The guests remain silent, MARY CONTINUES to CRY.

conversation...

What?

Gosh, my ears are ringing, I

can't hear anybody.

I must say, a crying kid is kind

of hard to take...

What?

We were just saying that this

baby's conversation is actually

rather limited... and a touch

annoying. Don't you think?

Well, she's not the only one

with a limited conversation.

At least she has an excuse, she's

a baby! What's yours?

I frankly don't know what you

mean.

I mean, I've been listening to

your pompous drivel about the

latest trends for the last two

hours, and frankly, it's a crock

of horseshit.

Come on, Peter, be nice...

Listen, go put the baby to bed

and you guys cool it, will you?

It's okay. I'm used to it.

Peter's always been a sore loser.

You motherfucker, get out of

here! Get out of my house right

now or I'll kick the shit out

He exits with Mary.    Jack, embarrassed, follows him.

He exits.

They exit.

They exit.   Christie is hanging on to Caroline.

Sophia, Jay and his Wife exit.

She gets up, so does Jerry.

Michael, very playful, comes back in carrying an

enormous three-tiered cake.

Jerry and his Wife exit. Michael is left standing there

with his cake. Jack comes in, full of beans.

Peter comes back in with Jack.

He sits down on a chair with the cake on his lap.

He stands there, frozen.

They both enter the living room. Mary stares at Sylvia.

When she spots Mary, Sylvia suddenly breaks down in tears.

Peter is dumbfounded.

Recovering, wiping away her tears, she walks over to the

playpen.

She picks her up, hugs her tightly, showers kisses on

her. MARY LAUGHS. Sylvia starts crying again.

Peter, in a kind of daze, stares at Sylvia. Without

looking at Peter, she dries her eyes and tries to stop

crying.

117   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                        117

He stuffs the blender into the bag.

Mary has now finished her bottle.

With dexterity, he places Mary face down on his shoulder

and walks around in the kitchen, patting her on the back.

He hands two bibs to Sylvia.

Sylvia walks through the apartment, and stops in front

of Michael's room, where she looks strangely at the

changing table with its mattress, its pretty sheet, and

the baby's toilet articles.

Sylvia enters the living room.

Michael has spread all of Mary's clothes, neatly folded

and ironed on the couch. He is packing them in a big

bag.

Michael bustles about. Sylvia's gaze comes to rest on

the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the

living room. Music boxes, little booties and stuffed

animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white

tulle frames the crib.

118   EXT. STREET - DAY                                         118

She starts to cry again.

She rubs noses with Mary.

Peter and Michael approach.

The three men are lined up on the sidewalk. Mary stares

at them, looking a little lost. They wave their hands

and:

MARY LAUGHS and waves.

The CAR STARTS up, pulls away, and disappears FROM VIEW.

They head back to their apartment building.

They have entered the elevator. The doors close. They

come out of the elevator, in front of their apartment.

Jack, alone in his room, with his back to us, is facing

his full-length mirror.

He's looking at himself, with one fist on his hip and

the other hand clutching a half-empty bottle of scotch.

He observes himself and slowly turns around -- we can

now see him in profile. His hair is disheveled, he's

unshaven, and he's put a pillow underneath his sweater.

He's pregnant. He takes a big swig of scotch. The

DOORBELL RINGS. Jack walks away from the mirror. He

staggers dead drunk. But dignified, pregnant.

Jack opens the door. Standing there is Graton holding

a stuffed animal, a rabbit.

face.

Silence.

135   INT. SYLVIA'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT                  135

He follows the Young Man in Sylvia's studio. It's very

messy. On the table there's a big heap of books and

papers. Mary, sitting on the floor, is wearing a diaper

and a sweater, but her legs are bare. She's playing

with an empty pack of cigarettes. She looks at Jack

with a serious, unruffled expression.

Silence. The Young Man sits down at the table and

immerses himself in his books.

Mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore.

Jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the Young Man,

who plops them down on a chair.

He immerses himself again in his books.

Jack heads toward the door, then turns around.

138   INT. APARTMENT - MORNING                                   138

Sylvia is a disheveled mess.

Jack, bare-chested, comes in pulling on his jeans. He

stops short at the front door. Sylvia is about to cry.

A distraught Peter, bare-chested and in jeans, comes

running in from his room.

Sylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her

on the doorstep.

Michael eagerly takes the bag from her.    It's followed by

a second, and then a third.

Peter, carrying Mary towards the kitchen, is followed by

Jack and Michael with the bags.

Sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the

hall.

In the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags,

the bottle, the saucepan... They've swallowed all their

pride and are kissing Mary all over, on her neck, her

hands, her tummy. They're deliriously happy. Michael

takes some sheets out of the bag.

He exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around,

leaping and dancing... He gets to the living room and

goes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes,

a fearful expression on his face. Then he turns and

races back to the kitchen.

Jack and Peter nervously follow Michael into the living

room. They stop short in front of the crib: There is

Sylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb

and sleeping like an angel.

Mary    suddenly comes in from the kitchen, walking unstead-

ily    but determinedly. She's dragging Graton's rabbit by

its    ear. She looks at the four of them and laughs her

head    off.

FREEZE FRAME.
