The face of MINERVA "MINI" DROGUES, 18, watching something.

She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering

across her eyes. She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty

mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly

still that of a girl.

-                    MINI (V.O.)

-         thinking, oh dear lord in heaven,

-         out my eyes with the straw in my

-         mouth until I suffocate, just not

We pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that

awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. Though tall

and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a

"FUCT" T-shirt and jean shorts.

CLOSE ON: THE TV SCREEN. "When Animals Attack" is on. In a

series of quick cuts:

shark he and his buddies thought was dead.

just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his

skull.

Mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. We

now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-appointed

Studio City hillside home.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM- EVENING- A PARTY.

TEENAGERS OF PRIVILEGE and their UPTIGHT PARENTS are milling

around, dancing and chatting as A DEEJAY spins tunes.

Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and

halter top. She clearly understands how to the drive the boys

crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who

stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER-

AEROBICIZED MOTHERS.

Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her

that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. The

blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing

for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.

Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing.

Mini's friend KAYLA, a little rounder, but also brash, comes

dancing over. She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini,

almost challenging her.

MIKE RUDELL, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their

display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his

imagination.

CONTINUED:

Kayla and Mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way,

clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable.

Mini grabs Kayla and dips her low.

INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER.

Kayla instructs some CATERERS to start wheeling a giant

birthday cake into the living room. The caterers look

confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey,

starting to wheel the cake down the long hall.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The cake emerges from the hallway. The caterers begin singing

"Happy Birthday", as Diane turns to see it and her eyes flash

rage. As Diane comes storming over, we switch to SLOW MOTION.

As she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on

Diane's face grows stronger with every step.

CONTINUED:

We switch back to real time.

A YOUNG CATERER'S face turns white.

POP! Suddenly the lid to the cake flies off and from behind

we see A NUDE MINI rises out of it like Venus on the half

shell.

A collection of reactions from the party goers: The mothers

are numb, the fathers pretend to be disturbed, while copping

looks, and her friends are in stitches. Some are even waving

dollar bills.        M

Mini leans over and gives her STUNNED mom a big hug.

INT. MINI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Mini stands in a bathrobe with a towel around her head,

having just taken a shower. She removes the towel to reveal

she's just changed her hair color to FLAMING RED.

tongue in his cheek, simulating a blow job.

Kayla puts her head down, her face turning red, as Mini stops

to address Troy and his posse.

"Ooohs" and "Aaahs" erupt from the onlookers as Troy looks

concerned his ambush has backfired.

More students start to gather, overhearing them.

CONTINUED:

Troy looks around, surprised and emboldened by her

declaration.

Mini moves closer, looking him right in the eye.

The crowd has now swelled to a few dozen, as everyone is

riveted by the exchange. Suddenly, Mini starts unzipping his

fly.

Troy tries to push her away, but she's got a grip on his

belt. Everyone watching is almost speechless at first, but

then giggles start to erupt.

She gets down on her knees, struggling to get a hand in his

pants. The crowd howls with approval, as they almost can't

believe their eyes.

CONTINUED: (2)

Troy finally pushes her off, humiliated, and runs down the

hall as the mob laughs at him. Kayla looks at her gratefully

and smiles.

Mini applying frosty hot pink lipstick, making her lips as

full as possible.

Mini looks towards the door, deciding to ignore her mother.

MINI?!

Mini turns towards the sound.

Diane comes storming in.

CONTINUED:

Diane's eyes narrow, as it's clear Mini knows exactly where

her mother's buttons are.

Diane gives Mini the once over, lingering on her mini-skirt.

Diane winces at the outfit.

Diane turns and leaves.

Mini turns back to the mirror.

She continues through the living room towards the door,

hiking her mini skirt up a little.

She reaches the front the door.

She opens the door to reveal a delivery boy, JIMMY 20's, with

six cases of liquor stacked on a handcart.

INT. THE KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER.

Mini watches as Jimmy carefully lifts one case after another

on to the counter.

Mini opens one case, takes out a bottle and heads out of the

kitchen.

CIRCA 1993.

Diane walks down the steps to a waiting Porsche, with a

SLEAZY LOOKING, BUT CLEARLY RICH GUY behind the wheel.

CONTINUED:

Diane getting into the car. She turns to the driver and gives

him a flirty smile. IT'S NOW A DIFFERENT, but just as SLEAZY

GUY smiling back at her.

As the car pulls away, we see an 8 YEAR OLD MINI watch from

an upstairs window of the building.

INT. THE SAME RUN DOWN APARTMENT - EVENING

Mini sits watching TV as Diane walks in with YET ANOTHER

SLEAZY GUY, his hands all over her. Diane looks surprised

and pissed to see Mini still up.

Mini just stares at her, then shifts her penetrating gaze to

SLEAZY GUY #3. He looks unnerved by Mini.

SLEAZY GUY #3

I thought you said we'd be--

I

Mini lies awake as the SOUNDS OF DIANE FUCKING SLEAZY GUY

#3's brains out waft through the thin walls.

INT. THE KITCHEN OF DIANE'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING.

Mini sits at the kitchen table eating cereal as THE FOURTH

SLEAZY GUY emerges from Diane's bedroom, he's tucking his

shirt in. He looks a little startled to see her up.

SLEAZY GUY #4

Oh...Uh, hi, uh, tell your mom I, uh, had a good time.

The guy looks at her a little surprised, then smiles.

SLEAZY GUY #4

Sure...thanks, kid.

Mini watching the PORSCHE PULL AWAY from the curb. In her

hand, she holds a bottle of MAXIMUM STRENGTH EX-LAX.

SLEAZY GUY #4 driving down the freeway, drinking coffee from

a paper cup. Suddenly, a look of absolute dread overcomes

him.

INT. DIANE'S APARTMENT - LATER.

Diane emerges from her bedroom in her bathrobe, looking

disheveled. She glares at Mini, who sits at the kitchen

table eating her cereal.

Mini just stares at her.

Mini says nothing. Suddenly, Diane picks up a SMALL PIECE OF

POTTERY from the coffee table and throws it at Mini's head.

Mini ducks as it SMASHES behind her on the wall.

CUT BACK TO: 18 YEAR OLD MINI MIXING HER MARTINI IN THE WET

BAR.

Mini starts downing the drink in a few big gulps.

INT. A HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

Mini, Diane and MARTIN TANNEN, 45, a trim executive in an

Armani suit and $300 haircut, mingle at a large corporate

cocktail party. Martin, a man who understands, in his world,

style over substance is a way of life, works the crowd

effortlessly.

Mini at the bar, stealing the drink of a TROPHY WIFE who has

turned her back on it, to make a point to her OLDER HUSBAND.

LATER. Martin finishes talking to a client and heads out on

the balcony to get some air, where he sees Diane kissing a

HANDSOME YOUNG EXECUTIVE off to the side. Martin stiffens as

he watches in SLOW MOTION her tongue slip into his mouth.

INT. THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE - NIGHT

Martin puts his keys and cell phone on a table near the door.

They head back into the living room.

He plops down on the couch, taking an electronic organizer

clearly elsewhere.

INT. A HALLWAY OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT

Mini walks down a hall and stops in front of a room and

knocks. She looks around trepidatiously, as she waits for an

answer. The door opens and a MIDDLE AGED MAN opens the door.

He's very well groomed in a creepy middle american way. He

could be a serial killer or...

INT. A HOTEL ROOM - LATER.

Mini pulls her red top on and heads for the door, as the man

sheepishly follows her.

She reaches the door. He opens it and points to the room

across from his. Mini walks across and knocks.

A HEAVIER MAN in a denim shirt opens it.

INT. THE OTHER HOTEL ROOM - LATER.

The heavier man is on his knees, weeping as he hugs Mini

around the waist.

She rolls her eyes in frustration.

EXT. FOUNTAIN AVENUE - NIGHT

Mini drives home, suddenly a SIREN is heard and she sees the

FLASHING LIGHTS of a cop car behind her. Mini pulls over

looking pissed.

The cop car pulls up behind her and a FEMALE COP WITH A BUZZ

CUT gets out, approaching the car. Mini looks in her mirror,

with a sly smile. The cop reaches Mini's door and looks down

at her, clearly attracted to her.

EXT. A BACK ALLEY OFF FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

THE POLICE CRUISER is parked with its lights off.

INT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS

Mini unlocks the door and walks in to find Diane passed out,

INT. MINI'S BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.

Mini walks in and stops dead in her tracks. A GREASY-HAIRED

NAKED MAN lies passed out on her bed. His body hair is thick

Mini's jaw tightens slowly.

INT. THE LOBBY OF THE PENINSULA HOTEL - NIGHT

Mini walks through the lobby past TWO BUSINESSMEN sitting at

INT. THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The executive "convenience" apartment is cold, sterile and

clearly just used for short amounts of time. Mini opens the

door, passing the closet, the bathroom door and then stops

suddenly as she sees...

MARTIN, her stepfather, sitting up in bed.

She quickly turns away before he sees her face.

Mini goes back towards the front door, panicking. She

absently hangs her jacket up in the closet, to buy some time.

Mini ducks into the bathroom.

INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mini shuts the door, turns on the light and looks at herself

in the mirror. She's almost white from the shock. She looks

down at the counter.

CONTINUED:

Mini's expression softens as she examines herself closer.

A wicked glint dances across her eyes.

INT. THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Martin turns the light off next to the bed. A little bit of

light from the street sneaks in around the edges of the

blinds. After a second, the door opens and Mini comes out in

a bra and panties.

Mini crosses the room slowly and sits on the edge of the bed,

letting her hair fall over her face. Martin tries to pull her

hair away from her eyes, but she turns away, playfully

shaking her head "no".

She reaches down and touches him through the sheet. He looks

up at her, clearly excited, but she keeps her gaze down. He

reaches over to the nightstand and picks up his wallet.

CONTINUED:

He nods.

Martin furrows his brow, disappointed.

He obeys.

Mini pulls the sheet back, revealing his body to her. She

starts kissing his chest, inhaling deeply. She looks up at

his expectant face, intoxicated with her power. Her mouth

starts to move down his chest. Martin lets out a small,

almost self-conscious gasp.

INT. THE ROOM - LATER.

It is still dark as Martin and Mini lie under the sheets,

INT/EXT. UPPER LEVEL OF THE BUILDING'S PARKING GARAGE-

LATER.

Mini walks to her car, giddy with excitement.

She reaches her car and looks for her keys in her purse. Her

eyebrows furrow as she has trouble finding them. Suddenly,

she realizes they aren't there. She freezes.

CONTINUED:

Startled, her head whips around to see Martin walking towards

her, carrying her jacket. He stops, the realization setting

in.

Seconds go by as Mini allows a pathologically triumphant

smile to spread across her mouth.

Martin starts to look nauseous, as Mini walks slowly over and

gives him a deep, wet kiss right on the mouth.

Martin just stares straight ahead, numb. After another moment

he walks to the railing of the garage, staring down at the

street below.

MARTIN'S POV: A few cars rush by on the street below. It

appears to be about a three or four story drop.

He looks back at Mini. He starts to lift a leg over the

railing.

Martin looks down at the street for another moment.

He glances back at her, looking tortured.

blitzed, checks his watch and stands up.

Mini and Martin stop at the sound of her voice, they look at

each other, realizing Diane's right outside.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly, the door flies open, as Martin ducks under the

covers. Diane stands there with a drink in her hand and what

appears to be cocaine residue under her nostrils. She appears

truly wired and incoherent, it's unclear whether she's even

noticed someone else in the bed.

For a moment, Mini can't believe her mother appears to have

no problem with there being a man in her bed.

Diane shuts the door.

Martin pokes his head out of the covers. The two of them

share a smile, not believing their luck. They start to laugh

and then after a moment she kisses him deeply and they resume

where they left off.

Martin blushes, averting his eyes.

The two of them sit at a romantic table in the candlelight,

as A WAITER refreshes their wine.

circle filled with LOCAL PERCUSSIONISTS and ON LOOKERS moving

to the throbbing beat.

Her eyes harden as she looks out at the city.

Martin's eyes suddenly widen.

She lets the word linger, as the rain beats down steadily.

CONTINUED:

Martin searches her eyes, almost unsure he's heard her right.

Her gaze is unwavering and after a few seconds he realizes

she's serious. He can't help but let the hint of a grin cross

his lips.            M

The sexual tension arises between them, as he starts moving

closer to her lips.

She responds in kind, tilting her head.

Unable to stand it, their lips meet and they start to

passing out of sight, behind the door frame.

Cushions from the living room couch fly past the door frame.

Mini stirs her coffee innocently. Diane again can be seen

through the door, this time throwing magazines and papers off

the coffee table.

Diane looks at Jeanette, her eyes narrowing.

at the trucks, her expression souring. She stops the car and

flies out.

Mini leads Carlos back to his vans, just Martin's Mercedes

A whimper escapes from her throat as she looks around.

She scans the crowd frantically, then starts walking towards

a VICTORIA'S SECRET STORE for help.

She stops, frozen in fear. Just then, the second SKATEPUNK

comes up behind her, brushing into her. She jerks away from

him.

behind her.

S

I'm going to have to ask you to leave the mall. We'll walk

you to your car.

SECURITY GUARD #1

Maam, you're going to have to leave.

SECURITY GUARD #1

Who knows?

She hands him the phone.

CONTINUED:

The security guard puts the phone to his ear. The BEEPING

sound of a hang up is heard. He nods to his partner, as he

removes a walkie talkie.

The two guards grab her. She drops the phone and starts

scratching at one guard's face. The other pepper sprays her,

as she falls down, howling.

RING! The phone is like a jolt of electricity through her

body. Diane kicks and punches at the guards.

The guards finally tackle her, getting handcuffs on.

THE OTHER SHOPPERS watch for a moment and lose interest,

writing her off as just another LA kook.

MINI watches from the upper level, quite satisfied.

INT. MARTIN AND DIANE'S BEDROOM - LATER.

Diane lies in bed, half awake, watching TV. A scotch and soda

rests in her hand.

CONTINUED:

Mini pokes her head in the door of the room.

Diane considers the question by looking at her face in the

bed side mirror. It's still puffy and blotchy from the pepper

spray.

She looks up at Mini.

EXT. THE BACKYARD - LATER.

It is dark and quiet, as the evening dew rises on the lawn.

INT. MARTIN AND DIANE'S BEDROOM - LATER.

Diane is almost asleep when the phone next to the bed RINGS,

waking her up. She stares at it for a moment, trying to

decide if she should answer it. On the forth ring, she

answers.

CONTINUED:

A DIAL TONE rings in her ear. She hangs up the phone. A

second later it RINGS again. She waits two rings and then

answers. Again a DIAL TONE.

Now a bit freaked, Diane is fully awake and staring at the

phone, waiting... PLINK! Something small hits the window

across the room. Startled, she turns her head towards it.

DIANE'S POV: Through the window, in the distance by the

hedges a BLACK CLAD FIGURE is visible, wearing a ski mask and

goggles. In the figure's right hand there is a gleaming,

sharp kitchen knife.

She can't believe her eyes.

HER POV: The figure stands silently, bringing the knife up,

indicating that he's going to cut her throat.

Eyes wild with panic, Diane picks up the phone and dials 911.

The phone dials and she waits.

She looks back out the window: THE HOODED FIGURE walks out of

the bushes and heads towards the house.

Diane realizes she doesn't have time to wait and runs out of

the room, leaving the phone off the hook.

INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Diane stumbles down the hallway, almost tripping on the steps

down to the living room. She goes straight for the phone on

the end table next to the couch. She picks it up.

CONTINUED:

She hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway, but as

she does, she sees reflected in a wall mirror: ANOTHER BLACK

CLAD FIGURE outside the living room window, but this one

holds a HAND AXE.

She turns around to look out the window. THE FIGURE raises

the axe slowly.

She heads towards the front door to scream for help, but the

axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door, making it

unsafe for her to even try. Her face dissolves into utter

despair, as she stumbles out of the room.

INT. THE FAMILY DEN - CONTINUOUS

Diane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked. She

clicks the lock shut, just as THE FIRST FIGURE with the knife

appears in the door frame.

Diane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses

of the goggles.

She slowly backs away from the door, as the figure tries to

open it. The door frame rattles on its track, as the figure

violently tugs at the handle.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

She runs back in, checking THE WINDOW. It's clear. She

decides to check the front door. She runs over and looks out

the peep hole.

PEEP HOLE POV: It appears clear.

She starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the

slit in the door, leaving the chain on.

THROUGH THE SLIT: everything looks good.

CONTINUED:

She opens the door and looks towards the front gate, which is

open. She looks as if she's thinking of making a dash for the

gates. Just then, from behind the gate, steps the AXE

WIELDING FIGURE.

It shakes a finger "no" at her, as it walks towards the

house. Terrified, she slams the door, locking it behind her.

She instinctively pushes her back against the door, hyper-

ventilating. She looks up at the ceiling, her eyes filling

with tears.

She looks around the room, searching for options. Suddenly,

her eyes bulge as she sees THE KNIFE WIELDING FIGURE standing

not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen.

Diane screams and runs back down the hallway, towards the

bedroom. The knife wielding figure follows behind her. She

looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the

shoulder. She shrieks and struggles out of it's grasp before

running in the bathroom and slamming the door.

INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Diane throws her weight against the door, struggling to keep

the intruder out. She looks for anything to help her, and

then sees in the window to the bathroom...THE AXE WIELDING

FIGURE standing silently, staring back at her.

D

again at THE WINDOW: It's empty. The pushing on the door

suddenly stops, but Diane is so disturbed, she doesn't notice

through her sobs.

A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVED HANDS puts the bedroom phone back on

its cradle.

INT. DOCTOR HOGGLY WOGGLY'S TYLER TEXAS BARBECUE - LATER.

Mini and Martin laugh and giggle at the enormous slabs of

beef put in front of them.

INT. THE HALLWAY OF THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - LATER.

Mini and Martin walk down the hallway towards the master

bedroom.

They reach the door to the bathroom. It's still closed.

Martin and Mini exchange a look, not believing that Diane

could still be in there.

Martin tries the door. Diane still appears to be leaning

against it. He pushes hard on the door, opening it a few

inches. Mini reaches in and shoves Diane over so they can can

open the door. She appears drugged. They lay her flat and try

to wake her up.

Mini slaps her hard across the face.

Martin lightly taps Diane's cheeks.

CONTINUED:

Mini looks up at the counter. AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION

SLEEPING PILLS lies open next to the sink.

H

The two of them look at each other, studying each other's

reaction. Seconds go by as both wait for the other to make

the first move.

The suggestion hangs in the air, as Martin feels Diane's

wrist again.

Martin looks down at Diane.

CONTINUED: (2)

She's got him and he knows it.

He puts a hand to his ear, encouraging the studio audience.

CONTINUED:

On the screen, the host introduces THE COUPLE, who nervously

towards the hallway leading to the bathroom.

the engine. Mini comes running outside in tears.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - LATER.

One of the paramedics fills out a report on a clipboard in

the background, as Martin continues to comfort Mini. A MAN,

neighbor, peering at them in the dark. He has an arm wrapped

around the waist of A YOUNG BLONDE who is clearly Playmate

material.

Mini quickly sits up, trying to make it look like innocent

father/daughter closeness.

R

they were lying.

looks equally uncomfortable.

Jennifer looks quite uneasy, as she forces a smile.

His face turns a little red.

Martin rubs his temples, clearly overwhelmed.

Her words don't appear to have calmed him.

EXT. THE POOL - DAY

Martin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very

unhappy. From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a

bikini.

Martin looks up from the book, looking around suspiciously.

Suddenly, Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the

mouth. He instinctively pulls back.

Just then, Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area, waving

at them. Mini's head is not close enough for the scene to

look incriminating, but Martin is too spooked to know the

difference.

INT. THE TANNEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

MIKE RUDELL looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of

his home. He's dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is

smoking a pipe, which he raises in greeting. His eyes are

locked on hers.

RUDELL allows the folds of his robe to open in the breeze,

revealing his chest and pair of silk boxers. He's in good

the pulsating beat. Mini, in a tight crimson dress, has

attracted quite a crowd, as she dances very provocatively

with a MUSCULAR YOUNG LATINO.

His face and shoulders glisten with sweat, as she lifts one

leg around his waist and then the other. As she straddles

him, their hips rocking together, she puts her arms around

his neck and leans all the way back, her hair hanging down in

ecstasy.

As she pulls herself back up, her eyes scan the room.

MARTIN stands in the back, watching her, his eyes sullen.

Mini's eyes move quickly enough past him that it's ambiguous

to him whether she spotted him or not.

He reaches his desk, where his YOUNG SECRETARY, LOIS, is

waiting with an envelope.

She hands him a manila envelope marked "MARTIN TANNEN- VIA

MESSENGER". He takes it from her and walks into his office,

sitting down. He opens the package to find an 8x10 glossy

photo of:

CONTINUED:

MINI SITTING WITH HIM AT THE POOL IN MEXICO. The caption

pitching wedge heading straight for his ribs. THWACK! Martin

catches him square and he goes down like a sack of potatoes.

Martin starts hitting him with one swing after another.

Rudell cries out in agony, as the blows smash one rib after

another.

Martin bends down and grabs Rudell's hair, twisting his head

around so he can look him in the eye. In the distance a SIREN

is heard getting closer.

CONTINUED:

Martin smashes his face into the patio. Rudell lets out a

moan, grasping at the ground, trying to get up, but his legs

don't obey him. Martin stands up and grabs the club, raising

it with both hands above his head for a final swing.

He turns around to see Mini, tears coming down her cheeks,

standing ten feet away. The SIRENS suddenly stop.

He raises the club again. Mini runs for him, grabbing his arm

before it comes down.

He tries to pull the club away.

Martin turns around to see TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS with their

guns drawn. Martin looks down at Rudell, gasping for air, his

face covered in blood. He looks at his own blood-soaked

clothes, the reality hitting him.

face, almost as if he's an animal at the zoo.

Martin furrows his brow, confused.

He suddenly becomes very still, as Mini's lips curl in a thin

smile.

Martin looks at her blankly.

Suddenly, it hits him.   He looks almost nauseous.

His knuckles tighten around the phone.

Martins jaw tightens as his pupils go black.

The veins start to bulge in his arm holding the phone.

Martin stares at her, taking deep steady breaths.

A PRISON GUARD appears behind Martin's stall.

CONTINUED: (4)

The guard moves to take the phone from him. Martin clutches

it to his head.

The guard struggles to rip the phone away, but Martin holds

on for dear life.

Finally, the guard smashes Martin with a billy club, sending

him sprawling on the floor. Martin screams behind the glass,

but cannot be heard, as the guard hog ties him and drags him

away by his feet.

EXT. A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY - DAY

SENIORS in gowns sit awaiting their diplomas, as PARENTS sit

in the audience, fanning themselves with programs. Mini

stands at the dais, addressing the class.

A FEW CHEERS go up from the rowdier students.

CONTINUED:

A polite smattering of applause is heard.

Her classmates instinctively lean forward a little to listen.

Principal Andrews nods in approval.

A few PARENTS look almost surprised to hear positive things

said about them.

CONTINUED: (2)      MINI(CONT'D)

Mini puts her speech down, gently sobbing, as THE AUDIENCE

ERUPTS. PRINCIPAL ANDREWS moves quickly to console her.

MINI'S FELLOW GRADUATES give her a standing ovation. A few

PARENTS become misty-eyed.

MINI looks out across the crowd and a huge smile ripples

across her face, as she waves to everyone in the golden

sunlight.
