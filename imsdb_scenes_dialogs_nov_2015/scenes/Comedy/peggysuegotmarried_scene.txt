INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - DESERTED LANE - NIGHT

The windows are fogged.  Peggy and Charlie kiss tenderly.

Peggy starts to GIGGLE, realizing the absurdity of the

situation. The more she GIGGLES, the more agitated Charlie

gets. Peggy starts to unbutton Charlie's shirt.

Charlie pushes her away, angry..

Peggy realizes she's blown it. Charlie isn't ready for this.

Charlie straightens himself up, starts the car and burns out.

turns and walks down the street.

she turns away. In the distance she SEES the lights of:

ART'S DONUT HOLE. OPEN 24 HOURS.

INT. ART'S DONUT HOLE

A few people linger over coffee. The waitress serving them is

Monica (the same but younger woman from LOVIN' OVEN).

In a corner, Michael Fitzsimmons, in a red leather jacket,

sits alone, reading. He looks up to check on his motorcycle

parked outside. He's splendid in his isolation.

Peggy enters, taking a seat at the counter, startled to see

Monica, who doesn't know her.

Peggy notices Michael staring at her. Peggy smiles, Michael

doesn't. Monica brings Peggy her coffee and donut.

Picking up her donut and coffee, she walks over to Michael's

table and sits opposite him.

studies him for a beat.

around she waits a beat, then enters the men's.

INT. MEN'S WASHROOM

With all the aplomb of a divorcee, Peggy takes a quarter and

deposits it in a condom machine. She puts the packet in her

skirt pocket, pulls out the joints and stares at them for a

beat. She checks her hair in the mirror and exits.

EXT. GAS STATION

Michael pumps air into the tires, bunched against a building.

Peggy approaches him, holding up a joint, smiling

conspiratorially. She lights it, inhales deeply, then passes

it to him. He smiles back at her, a bit surprised, but still

takes the joint and inhales.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD

They drive up to a mountain top, Peggy wearing the leather

jacket. She directs Michael with one arm.

The motorcycle is parked. Peggy and Michael lie on the grass,

staring down at the town lights below. Michael inhales the

joint, then passes it to Peggy.

Peggy takes off her sweater, kicks off her shoes and begins

to dance. Her eyes are closed, her body silhouetted by the

moon. Michael is transfixed. After a few beats, he walks over

to her. He stretches out his arms and places them around her

neck. They sway together for several beats, their bodies

touching. Peggy opens her eyes and sees Michael gazing at her

tenderly.

Michael kisses Peggy. She responds passionately.

Peggy is falling for it. He fumbles with her bra straps.

His other hand reaches to undo her skirt.

Peggy is moved by the beauty of the poem. She sits up, leans

over Michael, runs her hand through his hair, almost

motherly.

Peggy lies back down on the ground. Michael takes her hand

and kisses it.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the entire, perfect tableau: the

starry night, the motorcycle, the clouds racing across the

sewing basket. She cuts the legs oft a pair of leotards. In

Peggy turns to face her parents, holding up her homemade

pantyhose with a flourish.

INT. PEGGY'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

A breeze blows through the open window Peggy sleeps fitfully,

tossing off the covers. We HEAR NOISES from outside her

window. A figure appears outside and silently climbs into the

bedroom. Peggy mumbles Charlie's name. The man walks over to

her bed as Peggy reaches out for him, tenderly, as if they

were still married.

Through her sleepclouded eyes, Peggy begins to focus on the

face of the younger Charlie. Suddenly, she remembers.

INT. BASEMENT

Peggy enters, flicks on the light and leads Charlie in. Peggy

senses Charlie's anger, and steels herself for the inevitable

confrontation.

Charlie exits. Peggy slumps back, drained. Getting up, she

crosses to the mounted swordfish. Standing on a chair she

reaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a package of

Pall Malls. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and picks up a

table lighter and flicks it. As it lights, the tiny music box

inside PLAYS SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES.

INT. KELCHER KITCHEN - MORNING

We HEAR distant CHURCH BELLS. Peggy sits down to scan the

large Sunday newspaper. Seeing her mother's phone book, she

batteryoperated revolving disc up in front of Peggy's closed

eyes, then puts it down and picks up a notepad and pen.

Peggy starts to shift in the chair. Her shorts hike up, her

legs spread slightly. This is not lost on Richard. Weird,

guttural sounds begin to emanate from his throat.

Peggy's meandering makes Richard nervous.

Richard frantically tries to put Peggy's blouse back on.

She's limp and unresponsive.

Richard kneels on top of Peggy as she wakes up, fumbling the

buttons at her breasts. Peggy comes to, as Richard jumps off.

dozen blacks are banging around outside. They eye Peggy and

Michael suspiciously.

INT. LENA'S LOUNGE

The room has a bar at one side, booths and tables in the rest

of the room. A stage is at the far end. On stage, an all

black group, The FourMations, is performing the song GOOD

TIMIN' The people in the club are dancing the Twist.

Peggy and Michael sit in the last booth. Several people wave

hello to Michael.. Although Peggy and Michael can see the

stage, their booth is not visible from the stage.

ANGLE  THE STAGE

On stage, the FourNations have concluded their song.

parents'. She stops when she sees Charlie's car parked in a

driveway, and leans against a tree next to his car. Moments

of the ANNOUNCEMENTS over the P.A. SYSTEM.

Everybody turns toward Rosalie and applauds. Peggy turns to

Rosalie, trembling. The BELL RINGS as the class starts to

leave, still crowded around Rosalie. Peggy stares after her,

frozen in her seat Dolores approaches.

Peggy looks up at Dolores and starts to seethe. She stands up

slowly and faces Dolores.

Peggy reaches down to	up her books. On the top of the pile is

an open fountain pen, which she picks up, pul1ing the release

lever, squirting ink all over Dolores's dress. Dolores drops

her books, looks down at her dress, horrified.

INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM

Peggy sits disconsolate on a bench, watching the other girls

changing into their swim suits. Rosalie is in the shower

room, wetting down her suit. She accepts congratulations from

Rosalie exits into the pool area. Peggy feels helpless.

INT. HALLWAY

Peggy walks down the hall, a set of double doors, leading to

the pool, just ahead of her through them she sees Rosalie

diving through the air with the careless innocence of youth.

She starts to walk away.

She kisses him on the forehead.

She continues down the hallway.

picking it up.

The man gets off the bus.

EXT. GENERAL STORE

Peggy stands at the door of the bus, hesitant. Elizabeth and

Barney approach the bus, waving and smiling up at her.

Peggy slowly walks down the steps, moved to tears. She

approaches her grandparents and drops her suitcases. She hugs

them tightly. The bus door closes and the bus pulls away

behind them.

INT. CAR  DRIVING

Barney is behind the wheel of a 1951 Plymouth. Elizabeth is

in front, Peggy curled up in the back, regressing.

INT. FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT

Peggy and Elizabeth finish up the dishes, chatting.

INT. LIVING ROOM

A fire blazes in the fireplace. A grandfather clock stands

prominently in the room. The clock from Peggy's house.

Peggy sits with Elizabeth, learning how to knit. Barney

laughs at "The Burns and Allen Show" on TV.

Suddenly, Peggy places her hand over her heart and shivers

with fear.

Peggy shivers again and shakes her head.

INT. LODGE - NIGHT

A onestory, pitchroof building. The sign over the entrance

reads.: THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN. Underneath the sign is

a logo of a spreading sunrise. Peggy and Barney pull up to

the front, exit the car and enter the building.

INT. LODGE  ANTEROOM

Thirty old men are congregating around the cloak room. Most

are already dressed in long, purple robes with the sunrise

logo over their hearts. They either wear or carry tricorner

hats. Peggy and Barney enter. Several men approach them.

Peggy nervously clings to Barney' s arm.

Peggy hands him her jacket as he heads over to the cloak,

room.

Barney rejoins them, wearing his hat and robe. The group

begins to enter the main room.

Barney takes her hand and squeezes it. They walk slowly

through the doorway.

INT. LODGE  MAIN ROOM

A large meeting hall. The room is draped, and brightly lit

with fluorescent lights. At one end sits a large, gold

painted wood throne. On either side are large candle holders,

with lit candles. A small table serves as an altar in front

of the platform. On a footstool is a potted plane with an

artificial bird perched on its top. The throne and altar look

like a set left over from a summer stock "Macbeth".

Peggy and Barney enter. Several men lead Peggy away from

Barney to the throne. One man places a go1den cape around her

shoulders. They lead her up the platform to the throne.

The LIGHTS are DIMMED. The room is lit by the candles.

The men form a semicircle around Peggy. Old men at the end

of their lives, they are serious and passionate about the

possibilities of life beyond this world. One by one, four men

from either end of the line approach the altar with

offerings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose.

The men rejoin the line.

LEO COOPER, a tall, whitehaired man, takes two steps

forward. The other men begin to sing a Gregorian chant.

Leo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms.

The old men form a circle in front of Peggy. They begin to

circumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads

bowed. As Barney passes in front of Peggy, he winks at her.

She smiles back.

We HEAR a clap of distant THUNDER. Peggy trembles. The

artificial bird falls off the plant. Peggy is struck with

amazement. She begins to glow, poised to take off. The men

continue to chant while:

Suddenly a door is opened, a gust of wind pours in and

extinguishes the candles, plunging the hall into darkness.

The LIGHTS are TURNED ON. All the men look to the throne.

Peggy is gone. They are speechless for a couple of beats.

CLOSE ON BARNEY  He smiles, happy that she made it. George

crosses to the wall, reaches behind the drapes and presses a

button. The wall slides open to reveal a fullyequipped card

room. The men shuffle in.

EXT. BEHIND THE LODGE

Charlie carries Peggy off towards his car, one hand covering

her mouth. Peggy struggles. When they reach the car, he puts

her down. She's still wrapped in her golden robe.

Charlie tries to Lead Peggy into the car.

Charlie pushes her inside, Peggy climbs back out. Charlie

takes her hand and drags her up a hill behind the lodge hall.

Charlie sits her down on the ground. She's impatient and

hopping mad.

Thunder and lightning. It starts to rain.

Peggy jumps up, exploding to Charlie.

Charlie bends down to comfort her, in tears. He hugs Peggy

and strokes her hair.

Peggy starts to compose herself.

Charlie helps her up. Be reaches into his pocket and takes

out a small box, handing it to Peggy.

With a slow, growing remembrance, Peggy opens the box. Inside

is the gold locket Peggy was wearing at the reunion.

Peggy opens the locket. She shivers with recognition.

INSERT - LOCKET

Two photos, one of Peggy, one of Charlie, as children.

Peggy leans into Charlie, throwing her arms around him,

holding on for dear life. She looks up at him, their

foreheads touching.

Charlie kisses her, passionately. The locket drops to the

ground. HOLD on the locket, and...

EXT. ON THE HILL - LATER

Charlie and Peggy are lying on the ground, gazing up. A flash

of lightning streaks across the sky.

Flying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon

kite. The center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing

like a marquee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEGGY SUE.

The kite begins to descend towards them. Peggy jumps to her

feet and races towards it. She grabs the tail and starts to

sail away with the kite. Charlie chases after her.

As Charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning

strikes his car. Peggy smiles. The men from the lodge run

outside. They look up and above the blazing car and see Peggy

floating away. Peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and

blows him a kiss. Charlie begins to run, following the kite

cord to its source. He finds Richard, struggling to restrain

the runaway kite.

Suddenly the cord breaks. Peggy floats away.

Charlie, Richard and the old men behold Peggy, bobbing and

dipping playfully in the sky. We begin to HEAR Charlie's

VOICE singing "Peggy Sue" O.S. Peggy looks down with wonder

at the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the

blackness. In an instant she becomes a star.

FINAL SCENE

HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Moving from two to C.U. Peggy, fragments of the reunion, the

cake coming towards her, fragments of words in echo effect:

'Your heart stopped for a while..." Father's voice:

'You're a very lucky young lady...' Doctor: 'A (explain) of

the head...' Mom's voice: 'But you're going to be all right

now, the paramedics got there...' Mom, 'We were so

worried..."

Echoing of, until once voice is left. Charlie. Sitting

opposite her bed, as he has been every minute of her illness.

He looks wan and old, worried sick, but trying to sing 'Peggy

Sue' for her.

Charlie laughs uncomfortably and Peggy Sue looks around her

hospital room.

Charlie pushes himself out of his chair and moves toward the

dresser.

Charlie returns to Peggy's bedside and opens the front cover

of the book.

ANGLE ON BOOK: the front page bears the title "The Pilgrim

Soul" and the dedication reads "

Night

Peggy smiles but shakes her head.

He places the book on her bedside table as he sits back down.

He holds her hand.

Checks himself in the mirror.
