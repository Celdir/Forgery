wakes her. She wants to be left alone.

Pete breathes all over her as he talks.

Pete lifts a sleeping CHARLOTTE (8) out of bed and walks her

downstairs. It looks ridiculous because she is too tall to

hold her like she is a baby.

INT. BREAKFAST NOOK - MORNING

Pete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the

table and decorate the room with birthday balloons,

streamers, etc. Pete sneaks bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts

into his mouth occasionally. The house is a bit more

cluttered and messier than when we last saw it in Knocked Up.

INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING

Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette.

She holds her cigarette with a yellow dish washing glove. She

puts out the cigarette and goes through an elaborate routine

of hiding the smell of smoke. She puts some weird oil in her

hair and uses a wet nap on her neck and clothes and brushes

her teeth. She sprays cologne and walks through it.

Debbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her

feet down. In the background, Barb stretches on a yoga ball.

You stop having sex, there will be

no more fights. I am living proof.

I have no sex, and I am the

happiest I've ever been.

I knew it. I knew you were not

having sex. I can see it on your

face. It's all puckered and pained.

I'm enjoying our non-sex period,

that's all I'm saying.

Don't you miss it?

Well, I wouldn't know, because I

don't have any feeling down there

anymore. I have nerve damage from

my C-section so everything is just

kinda-

She's numb down there.

I could sit down hard on a fire

hydrant, and I wouldn't even know

that I was sitting. I could get

stung by a hornet down there, and I

would not feel it. You could put

anything in there, and I would not

know what the object was. I used to

pee in a nice stream, and now it

just kind of goes like a shower

head.

That is the saddest thing I've ever

heard.

I think you need a family. Don't

you want a family?

No, I think I want to Clooney it.

Clooney it?

Jason demonstrates.

knocking. Pete is on the toilet playing Scrabble on his iPad.

Charlotte just did her first flip

on the trampoline, and she landed

on her feet. She was really proud

of herself.

Oh, that's great.

And you missed it.

She'll do it again.

It's just that this is the fourth

time you've gone to the bathroom

today.

Give me a break.

Why is your instinct to escape?

It's not my instinct to escape from

you. It is my instinct to come into

the bathroom when I need to go to

the bathroom.

How come I don't smell anything?

It's because I shoved an Altoid up

my ass before I came in here.

Let me see then.

What?

Let me see!

No, I'm not going to let you see.

You're not going to let me see

because you're not taking a poop.

She angrily grabs his iPad and walks out.

INT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - STAGE - NIGHT

Pete stands on stage speaking to a small crowd.

The crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage.

Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song. The

song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercial.

We watch Debbie. Although the music is great, it's a little

depressing and not working on her. She quickly gets bored.

An ambulance drives by, sirens blaring.

INT. PETE'S MUSIC LABEL - DAY

Pete paces around his office on the phone.

Pete is with RONNIE and CAT, employees at his record label.

They are watching an electronic press kit cut together for

Graham Parker. There is a montage of him performing

throughout the years from the seventies to the present.

You can't show him in his prime in

`77 and then jump straight to him

as he is now. It's terrifying. You

have to reverse it. You've got to

show him as he is now very briefly,

and then show him in 1977. You have

to "Benjamin Button" it.

I don't know what you're talking

about, okay? All rock stars are

older now. Steven Tyler, David

Bowie, Mick Jagger--

Paul McCartney.

Okay, stop it. Everybody you're

mentioning looks like an old woman

now. You're just mentioning a bunch

of Jessica Tandys. Keith Richards

gets away with it. But that's

because Keith Richards looked

seventy when he was forty, and now

that he's seventy, he looks sixty-

nine. He's regenerating.

I like it. And I think Graham

Parker is sexy.

Would you fuck him?

Yes.

You'd fuck him, and you won't fuck

me?

I mean, I kind of fucked you once,

if you could have finished.

Oh, I finished.

You know what, enough of who fucked

who and who finished what.

Angle on Graham and a journalist wearing a yarmulke.

Angle on Pete, Cat and Ronnie.

Graham walks up.

INT. PETE'S HOME OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Pete and Debbie are talking. Debbie holds a list of changes

she wants to make.

We have everything we need right

now to be completely happy. We're

going to blink and be ninety.

What?

So, let's just choose to be happy.

Yeah.

Your eyes are kind of glazing over.

No, I'm just processing it all.

Some of these I wrote for you. So,

we have to exercise every day.

Spend more time alone together. We

have to go to the therapist every

week.

That's a little pricey.

No stressing over tiny things.

Yeah, that's good. You should do

that.

We have to get more involved in

school. Have more patience with the

kids. And we need to work on our

anger.

Yeah, I think it would be good if

you could take care of your anger.

No, I said both of us.

That's what I said. Our anger.

Okay. No more smoking.

Yeah, you've got to cut that out.

I don't want to make this about a

fight, I want to just be positive.

Sorry.

Okay, and then no more holding on

to resentments. We have to just let

that go.

So, you're saying that if we're

arguing and I apologize, you'll let

it go and not throw it back in my

face later?

Well, I don't do that, but I will

continue not to do that. What did

you write?

All of that. That's plenty. That's

a lot.

And you're going to eat better?

Oh, yeah. I've been doing a decent

job, but I don't think there's

anything wrong with having some

fries every now and again.

And then I'll smoke that day.

That's not the same thing.

It is the same thing.

I like fries.

Pete picks up a guitar and starts playing with it.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

We reveal that Debbie is watching security cam footage of the

store.

We watch the footage and suddenly Desi's BOYFRIEND enters. He

walks behind the counter, and she sits on his lap. She

adjusts herself.

On the screen, they kiss. Desi seems to be popping up and

down a little.

Pete farts.

He farts again. It is longer.

Debbie hits Pete with a pillow.

Pete farts again.

INT. SADIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Charlotte jumps around in front of Sadie's door. Sadie sits

EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

cigarettes in the garbage cans outside. Pete tosses a packet

of M&M's in the garbage. He throws out all of his cupcakes

can't. He takes another bite, holds it over the garbage, then

You don't spend enough time with

the family when you're constantly

on your iPhone and your computer.

You're only here five more years.

So you won't see me after five

years?

No, but you won't be living with

us. And you should get to know your

little sister.

You've got the perfect friend right

here.

I don't want to be friends with her

now. I'll be friends with her when

she's twenty and a normal person.

I don't want to hang out with her

when I'm in my twenties.

You're on your computer too much as

it is. You need to get outside

more.

Yeah. You can build things. You can

build a fort.

What?

Yeah, build a fort. Play with your

friends.

eyes. Let's remember this moment

right now and know that we never

have to fight.

But you're such a dick sometimes.

I know, I am a dick sometimes.

People think I'm so nice, but I'm

such a dick.

Thank you for admitting that.

And you get so mad at me. I feel

like you want to kill me.

I do want to kill you.

How would you do it?

I don't know... poison you. I'd

poison your cupcakes that you

pretend not to eat everyday. And

just put enough in to slowly weaken

you.

I love it.

Me too.

could use the computer to iChat.

Remember the rules? Eight to eight-

thirty?

Yeah, but I have a friend over.

Hi Wendy. Why don't you guys go

play? You could go build a fort!

Remember the Alamo?

Have you ever built a fort, Wendy?

Like on Facebook?

I will take this if you're going to

throw it away, because at our

I don't want this. I don't even

like it. I'm not going to hang it

up.

It's not for you to hang up. It's

for you to sell. That way I can

give it to you and you can make

some money, and Debbie doesn't know

that I'm giving you anything.

Well, you're not giving me money.

You're giving me a project. I don't

know how to sell this. I'm not an

art dealer.

Just sell it online. Do some

research, make some calls. Or is

that too hard to do with your high

blood pressure?

All right. Don't get snippy. Just

because you write a great song

doesn't mean you can draw.

It's incredible. John Lennon drew

it.

I think it's a Ringo. Don't beat me

up if I get three hundred dollars

for it.

hundred for that. It's very

the docket. I'm not trying to force

that.

So you would do sex with me?

passion there.

We're not like brother and sister.

You know what we're like? We're

like Simon and Garfunkel, and

somehow you turned me into

Garfunkel.

I don't even know what that means.

Art Garfunkel.

What's wrong with Art Garfunkel? He

has a beautiful voice.

He's got an amazing voice. He could

put a harmony to anything, but what

I'm saying is that you turned me

into him.

What the hell are you talking

about?

Simon controls him.

That's because Simon writes the

fucking songs! He's the better one.

How am I going to relay what these

two nutballs said to me unless I

say it.

Can you please not talk like that,

Catherine? Music Man is rehearsing

next door.

Sorry, fucking Music Man. Maybe if

I looked more like this fake

bullshit couple, looks like they're

in a bank commercial. That's what

you look like. Like a bullshit bank

commercial couple.

None of this talk is productive.

I'd like to rear up and jackknife

my legs and kick you both in the

jaw with my foot bone.

You're just really scaring me.

This is what happens when you

corner a rat. You corner me, I will

chew through you.

Catherine, you're better than this.

Fuck you, Jill. You're a horrible

woman. This is why everybody hates

you. This kind of shit.

Ineffective. Bullshit hair. And I'm

glad your husband died. Because

you're a fucking asshole. He

probably killed himself.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Pete and Debbie leave the school together, surpressing

smiles. They get in separate cars and drive off.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Debbie is making dinner. Pete and Charlotte sit at the table.

Sadie storms in.

Joseph told me that you flipped out

on him and his mom and that you

guys are nuts, and I agree.

Don't be disrespectful.

You're the ones who are

disrespectful. Reading my texts is

like reading my diary.

You were really sweet on your

iChat. We were really proud of you.

Yeah, we were going to give you

your computer and phone back.

Fuck you!

Okay, there's the first official

"Fuck you."

That is not how we talk to each

other in this house.

You guys talk to each other like

that all the time! And to Joseph

and his mom. You made Joseph cry.

Joseph has a crush on you. You like

a boy who cries.

Shut up, Charlotte. You guys so

desperately want me to be perfect

and to make no mistakes. Well, you

two are fucking insane.

Okay.

She walks off.

INT. SADIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sadie does her homework on her bed. Charlotte brings in

Sadie's electronics and puts them down in a pile beside her.

Charlotte walks away and starts to slide the door closed

behind her.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Debbie is sitting on the couch. Pete paces around the room.

They hug.

INT. SADIE'S ROOM - MORNING

The shades are closed and the room is dark. Sadie watches the

end of the last episode of Lost on a laptop. Pete enters.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Debbie is speaking with Barb as they set up the kitchen for a

barbecue for Pete's fortieth birthday.

INT./EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Desi jumps in the pool in a small bikini. She is playing in

the water with the kids.

ANGLE ON BARRY AND PETE

Angle on Barb and Debbie.

Angle on Barry and Pete.

Angle on Barb and Debbie.

Barry and Pete turn toward their wives, smile and wave.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Pete greets guests, including Graham and Grandma Molly.

EXT. BACKYARD - LATER

Pete and Ronnie are talking in the backyard.

Debbie walks over with Jason.

They leave Ronnie and Jason alone. The guys spot Desi

swimming in the pool.

INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

Debbie and Pete open the front door. Standing there is

Oliver. He gives a nervous smile.

Debbie looks at him and tries to be nice, but we feel her

effort.

She opens the door wider. They do not hug.

He hands him a bottle.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

The party is in full swing. Pete, Debbie, Oliver, Barry and

Barb are getting food from the buffet. Barb and Barry are

trying to help keep the conversation going.

Larry arrives, with Claire and the triplets. Claire is

holding two of them, while Larry carries one.

The triplets now have very different HAIRCUTS so he can tell

them apart. One has a faux hawk, one has bangs, and one has a

buzz cut.

Larry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms,

simulating an elevator.

Larry puts Jack down and he runs off.

Claire runs off.

Sadie, Charlotte and Desi walk over.

He gives Desi a hug.

Oliver gets up. Charlotte, Sadie and Desi run off. Oliver

follows.

EXT. POOL - DAY

Desi is gracefully swimming under water. She looks gorgeous.

She sees Jason and Ronnie under water, but they look

grotesque, red-faced and awkward. They both reach for each

other and come to the surface.

Pause.

Desi swims away.

EXT. BACKYARD - LATER

Larry is talking to Oliver.

So, spinal surgery just seems to me

to be at the top of the surgery

chain.

Well, we're not cardio, we're not

neuro, but I like to think we're an

important part of the spectrum.

Do you operate every single day?

Most days.

Multiple times a day?

Three, four times.

So what's the price range? Like if

I wanted--

Oh, I'd rather not say.

It's so big you're embarrassed to

say.

I wouldn't say embarrassed.

Are there hunchbacks today?

Of course.

I've never seen one.

Well, that's because there are

spinal surgeons.

That's because of you. Each time I

don't see a hunchback, you're

getting that much richer.

Oliver smiles, amused.

EXT. POOLSIDE - DAY

Jason and Ronnie are talking to Desi.

EXT. BACKYARD - LATER

Debbie, Pete, Larry, Oliver, Barb and Barry are eating.

EXT. POOLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

Ronnie, Jason, and Desi talk.

EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

And before that?

It's been about seven years.

Seven years? That's a joke, right?

That's like two Olympics. And I'm

the bad guy. What Debbie doesn't

understand is that it's not bad to

help out a parent. And it's

certainly not bad for a parent to

help out a child. I'm sure Oliver

would agree.

Are you really doing this right

now?

Am I doing what? I didn't start the

toast.

Are you really about to hit up my

dad for money?

What? He does four operations a

day. It's perfect. It helps

everybody, and it relieves his

guilt from all the abandonment

issues.

You can't buy forgiveness, right

Pete?

I don't think anyone's looking for

handouts... We'd pay him back.

If you two are in a bind I'd be

more than happy to help.

No. It's not good to borrow money

from family members because it

causes resentment, remember?

Yeah.

What do you want me to do? Admit

that my life is shit? Is that what

you want me to say? You happy?

Aren't I allowed a little joy with

these children I never wanted to

have?

You have never once stopped asking

us for money.

Family helps family.

It's true. Family helps family.

Look, I don't expect you to fully

understand. Your dad left. You're

broken inside. It's not your fault

you can't feel love. There's

something that you can't -- this is

coming out wrong.

You know what? I would rather have

my dad than your dad, because he

doesn't drive me crazy. You know

the best quality my father has? He

asks for nothing. I don't know what

the fuck he's thinking right now.

Look at that. Nothing. I don't even

know him. And I turned out

perfectly fine without his input.

I just figured out what your

problem is. You hate Jews. Which is

so odd because your children are

Jewish.

Don't play the Jew card, Larry.

I'm not playing any Jew card.

Seriously, it's used up.

You can't use up a Jew card. That's

the whole point of a Jew card.

Oliver gets up to leave.

Oliver walks out.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Graham Parker sings "Happy Birthday" to Pete as Charlotte

accompanies him on a keyboard. The party is tense.

Debbie looks over and sees that Oliver never actually left.

He stands in the back looking uncomfortable, quietly singing.

She's shocked he's still there.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY - LATER

Debbie smokes a cigarette at the side of the house. Sadie

appears.

Debbie turns, caught.

She walks away towards the house. Sadie follows.

INT./EXT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Sadie storms through the front door after Debbie.

Debbie keeps walking down the hall. Sadie follows her.

Barb is in the kitchen with Pete and Charlotte.

Debbie turns the corner to find Pete standing in front of the

fridge, stress eating.

You have no idea what I want.

I want an Asian baby.

We're not going to have an Asian

baby.

Yes, we are!

They're not Asian.

Sadie.

We'll buy one.

Shut up, Charlotte.

You shut up!

Shut up, Sadie!

Shut up, Charlotte!

Shut up!

Okay, Sadie. Shut up.

Shut up, Charlotte!

Okay, stop saying shut up!

Since when are you pregnant? When

did you find out?

Will you stop eating cupcakes,

please! Stop eating cupcakes. Stop

eating cupcakes!!

Debbie storms off back towards the foyer. Larry pops out from

the living room, stopping Debbie in the foyer. Claire and the

triplets are right behind him.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Pete throws his cupcake against the wall.

INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Larry and Claire walk away as Pete storms in.

Oliver passes Pete and turns to Debbie as Pete walks away.

Debbie is stunned.

Debbie follows him out the door and onto the front porch. She

closes the door behind them.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Debbie looks at him for a moment.

Larry opens the door and peeks out. We reveal that everyone

at the party (except Pete) is still standing in the foyer.

From the side of the house we see Pete storming by on his

bike, wearing his street clothes and a helmet.

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Pete exits his home riding his bike. He is very angry. He

rides with great emotion like he is trying to get all the

frustration out of his body.

Pete rides his bike onto San Vicente Boulevard.

Pete rides down the street. A CAR passes by him. When it does

a fifteen-year-old TEENAGER sticks his head out the window

and yells to scare Pete.

Pete almost falls.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Debbie and Barb are cleaning up. They look out the window to

see Oliver picking up glasses and putting them in a bin.

Sadie walks in with Joseph.

Sadie walks off.

Joseph follows.

EXT. STREET - DAY

There is no bike lane and cars going very fast have to swerve

to avoid Pete. A car honks when traffic clogs up behind him.

A car makes a right turn, and Pete almost rides right into

it.

He pulls up alongside Jason's van. Desi is riding with Jason.

They speed off.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Oliver and the kids are playing with an iPhone.

Debbie walks outside.

Debbie exits.

Sadie turns to Charlotte, puts her arm around her.

Charlotte smiles, delighted to be accepted by her sister.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Pete starts riding really fast and passes a car. When the car

stops for a red he keeps going, tears off to the left,

crosses four lanes of traffic in both directions and almost

gets hit.

Pete rides his bike up a steep hill.

He passes some other bikers almost hitting them.

INT. DEBBIE'S CAR - DAY

Debbie drives around the neighborhood with Larry in the

passenger seat.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Pete flies down a steep hill going crazy fast. Close up of

his front wheel shaking. It is as if he wants to crash.

He rides down the street when suddenly a MAN IN A RANGE ROVER

opens his door to exit his car and Pete slams directly into

the man's car door -- hard, breaking the man's window and

falling to the ground.

The man is an incredibly thick fifty-five-year-old.

Pete slowly gets to his feet.

INT. DEBBIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

They drive near the scene of Pete's accident and overhear.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

The man punches Pete in the face where he's already bleeding.

INT. DEBBIE'S CAR

Debbie sees the punch and gasps, realizing it's Pete.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Pete looks stunned.

He punches the man in the gut, to no effect. The man punches

Pete back in the stomach. Pete sinks to the ground.

INT. DEBBIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Debbie watches Pete fall to the ground. She opens the car

door and starts to run over toward him.

EXT. STREET- CONTINUOUS

As the man starts his engine, Debbie runs toward Pete.

The car drives away, revealing that it is new and has

dealer's plates with no numbers.

Debbie reaches him and holds his head up.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Debbie and Larry sit in the waiting area of the hospital.

A NURSE walks over to them.

The Nurse walks away.

She hugs him and starts to cry a little bit.

He grabs the bill out of her purse and walks off.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Oliver is sitting on the couch with Charlotte and Sadie

watching the last scene of Lost. Joseph has joined them.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Debbie walks into Pete's room, sits on the bed next to him.

No. I'm sorry. I don't want to keep

anything from you. I love you.

You're my wife. I just didn't want

to let you down.

Are you mad that I'm pregnant?

No. I'm not mad. I'm thrilled.

You don't feel trapped?

Sometimes I feel like I trapped

you.

I don't feel trapped.

Really?

No.

You should, because I've trapped

you. You can't go anywhere. I'm

going to get you pregnant every ten

years for the rest of your life.

You can never leave me. Ever.

I never feel trapped by you. I'm so

happy to be with you. I love you so

much. You're my favorite person in

the whole world. god damn it, why

am I crying like this? Something is

wrong with me.

You're pregnant.

Oh, yeah. Shit. I was just outside

telling your dad that I liked him.

What if he thinks I like him now?

No, he won't think that.

I don't want him to think I like

him that much.

It'll never happen.

Can you believe it? This is the

craziest thing ever. What are we

going to do with a third baby?

I have no idea. How are we going to

afford it?

We'll sell the house.

We don't have to.

We kind of do.

We kind of do.

We'll make new memories in a new

house.

I love you.

Is there anything you want to do

for your birthday? It's been the

worst birthday ever.

There is one thing, but I don't

think you'll like it.

What?

I wouldn't mind going to see some

music. Would you want to do that?

Yeah.

Debbie laughs.

As Debbie helps Pete off of the hospital bed, Pete kisses her

passionately.

INT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Pete and Debbie watch Ryan Adams perform "Lucky Now" with his

band.

Pete smiles.

She smiles at him and he smiles back, almost blushing. This

is the smile he has been waiting for.

The camera pulls back as Ryan Adams finishes his song.

FADE TO BLACK
