BLACK

No image. A bleak WIND MOANS. HOLD.

With a STINGING CHORD we --

CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT (CIRCA 1958)

Lights twinkle. Snow falls. The WIND MOANS.

After a beat, the voice of an elderly black man:

We are TRACKING HIGH THROUGH the night sky. From the streets

far below we hear the sounds of TRAFFIC muffled by the falling

snow, and the DISTANT sound of many VOICES SINGING.

We are DRIFTING AMONG the buildings; the tops of skyscrapers

slip by left and right.

The SINGING, a little MORE AUDIBLE, but still not close, is

"Auld Lang Syne."

We are MOVING IN TOWARDS a particular skyscraper. At its top

is a large illuminated clock.

We hear a SERIES OF POPPING sounds.

A big band WALTZ MIXES UP on the track.

The LOMBARDO MUSIC gives way to the CHANTING of a distant

CROWD: "Sixty! Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight!"

The CHANTING has MIXED back DOWN AGAIN TO leave only the

WIND. Still TRACKING IN TOWARD the top of the skyscraper, we

begin to hear the TICK of its enormous CLOCK. The clock reads

a minute to twelve. Above it, in neon, a company's name:

"HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES." Below it, in neon, the company's

motto: "THE FUTURE IS NOW."

We are MOVING IN ON a darkened penthouse window next to the

clock. The window starts to open.

A young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge.

With the opening of the window, "AULD LANG SYNE" filters out

with greater volume.

The man gingerly straightens up on the ledge. He is perhaps

in his late twenties. He wears a leather apron. Printed on

the apron: "HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future is Now."

He looks with nervous determination into the void.

The CAMERA obliges. We TRACK IN SLOWLY, ENDING VERY CLOSE.

Norville sways in anguish as the TICKING of the CLOCK grows

louder and the WIND blows in his face.

Norville is tensing his body, peering out over the ledge,

preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but the

CAMERA'S continued MOVEMENT is LOSING him FROM FRAME.

We are MOVING IN ON the enormous CLOCK, whose MECHANICAL

THRUM becomes very loud indeed.

The second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve -- bare

seconds to midnight. Distant CHANTING from Times Square MIXES

UP: "Nine! Eight! Seven!"

OVER BLACK

The HUM of the CLOCK SINKS UNDER the HISS of an AIRBRAKE and

GRINDING GEARS as we...

DESTINATION DISPLAY

On the front of a bus just rocking to a halt. The display

says "MUNCIE-NEW YORK."

LINE OF BAGS

is being set out on the pavement. A man with the cuffs of a

redcap uniform swings one into the f.g.:

It has a sticker on it: CLASS OF '58, and below an

illustration of crossed right and left hands, their thumbs

hooked and fingers spread like wings: MUNCIE COLLEGE OF

BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.

After a beat the hand of its claimant ENTERS to pick it up.

STREET

FOLLOWING the bag as its owner carries it down the street.

He pauses, sets it down.

YOUNG MAN

Fresh-faced, eager -- NORVILLE BARNES. He is gazing off at:

WESSELS EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

The sign is over a ground floor office; an exterior clock

shows 9:00. A curtain is just being pulled open in its picture

window to reveal a great job board. It is like the departures

board in a great train station, with each of its individual

entries flipping over occasionally to reveal a new

opportunity. On offer are jobs like: PASTRY CHEF, STEAMFITTER,

LAY-OUT MAN, GRAVEDIGGER, etc.

REVERSE

On the small crowd gathered to, like Norville, watch the

board -- men in search of jobs, of various classes and

vocations, but alike in their intent gaze, their hands dug

into their pockets, their hats pushed back on their heads,

bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the chattering

board. Men occasionally head for the office as they see a

prospect they like.

Norville stands pat, watching.

HIS POV

An entry flips over to reveal EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT.

NORVILLE

He brightens.

BOARD

We PAN ALONG the executive entry to EXPERIENCE REQUIRED.

NORVILLE

He frowns.

Around him, the crowd is thinning out as men trot in to apply

for their respective jobs.

We see other entries: JUNIOR EXECUTIVE. PAN TO EXPERIENCE

ONLY. EXECUTIVE MANAGER... MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE.

BUSINESSMAN... EXPERIENCED.

The CROSS-CUTTING ENDS in a wash of SUPER-IMPOSITIONS PANNING

OVER Norviille, now alone on the sidewalk:

EXPERIENCED ONLY... EXPERIENCED... EXPERIENCED...

EXPERIENCED...

CLOSE SHOT - EXECUTIVE

A middle-aged, mousy-looking man in a conservative suit and

wire-rimmed spectacles is addressing his remarks to someone

O.S. Behind the Executive we see only the skyline of New

York City.

TRACKING

DOWN the LENGTH OF the board room table. Executives line

either side. We are APPROACHING the man at the far end of

the table, to whom the report is being directed.

He is late middle-aged, dressed expensively but

conservatively, his attention smilingly fixed on the Executive

who drones on.

The TRACK has ENDED IN a CLOSEUP of the man at the end of

the table, who still smiles benignantly at the droning

Executive. The smile is serene, almost otherwordly.

This is WARING HUDSUCKER.

REPORTING EXECUTIVE

He drones on.

The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OFF the droning Executive as the big

man's attention apparently wanders; we FRAME UP ON the picture

window skyline of New York.

FOLDED-BACK WANT ADS

A hand with pencil goes down a list of positions, ticking

each one: STREETSWEEPER -- EXPERIENCED; LINOTYPE MAN --

EXPERIENCED; CANTOR (REFORM) -- EXPERIENCED; SPARRING PARTNER --

EXPERIENCED.

WIDER

Norville, sitting at a coffeeshop counter, sets the pencil

down. His chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm.

His hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head. He idly stirs

his coffee with his spoon.

He takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down

on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change,

turning it inside-out.

CLOSE ON COUNTER

As Norville puts all his change on the counter. His hand

hesitates; he takes a little of it back. He LEAVES FRAME.

A waitress's hand ENTERS from the far side of the counter.

She clears away the saucer, then the cup -- which has been

resting on the want ads. It leaves a perfect brown circle

around one entry:

As we hear the COFFEESHOP DOOR OPENING O.S., a draft wafts

the sheet of newspaper off the counter and OUT OF FRAME.

NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE

Again LOOKING THROUGH the WINDOW as, O.S., the reporting

Executive drones on.

WARING HUDSUCKER

looks dreamily out the window. His attention returns to the

droning Executive and the benignant smile returns to his

lips.

NORVILLE'S BACK

He walks dejectedly down the street, hands shoved into his

pockets.

A sheet of newspaper eddies INTO FRAME. The wind tosses it

this way and that.

Slap! -- It plasters against another pedestrian, who bats it

away.

The newspaper eddies around some more, then plasters against

Norville.

He peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops,

noticing something.

NEWSPAPER SCRAP

It is a section of the want ads. One entry is perfectly

circled by a coffee stain.

BACK TO NORVILLE

He looks up from the paper. There is purpose in his gaze.

Wind whips his hair.

CLOSE SHOT - WARING HUDSUCKER

As the Executive drones on, O.S., Hudsucker is carefully

winding his wristwatch.

Hudsucker looks up from his watch, smiles, runs his palms

back over his fringe of hair.

Hudsucker pulls his sleeve cuffs to expose just the right

amount under the suit.

Hudsucker takes one puff from his cigar and carefully sets

it in his ashtray.

He deliberately unstraps his wristwatch and looks at its

face.

The sweep second hand is starting the last revolution that

will end at precisely noon.

Hudsucker lays the watch carefully on the table.

Savoring a pause, the Executive looks around the board table.

This draws an appreciative chuckle from the board. It is cut

off by:

The board turns expectantly to Hudsucker, who sits in the

f.g. Beyond him is the length of the board table and the

large picture window. He rises to his feet, slowly and

deliberately, and rubs his palms together.

He swings his chair out.

He steps up onto the chair.

The board stares.

He steps up from the chair onto the board table.

The heads of the board members swing up in unison.

Hudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN. He shakes the tension

loose from each leg, then waggles both arms dangling at his

sides, like an athlete preparing for a sprint.

CLOSE ON WANT ADS

THE CIRCLED AD

The hand holding the paper DROPS AWAY and we TILT UP, as

Norville walks AWAY FROM us into the b.g., towards the office

building across the street. Its street number tops its

imposing entryway in large gilt letters: 285.

We continue TILTING UP the length of the skyscraper, to reveal

a huge clock capping its facade. Above the clock is the

identification "HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES."  Below the clock is

the motto "THE FUTURE IS NOW."

The huge clock's sweep second hand is just approaching the

position that will make the time 12:00 sharp.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As the second hand hits the twelve, the CLOCK TOLLS, the

board room WINDOW SHATTERS and Waring Hudsucker comes flying

out.

SECRETARIAL AREA

Somewhere in the Hudsucker Building. A secretary sits typing

next to an open window, finished pages sitting stacked beside

her. As we hear ANOTHER TOLL of the CLOCK.

As Hudsucker shoots past the window, his draft sends the

stack of papers wafting this way and that. As the secretary

turns to look out the window, FREEZE FRAME (wafting papers

have their motion arrested) and SUPER A TITLE.

TRACKING

WITH Hudsucker, the building slipping by behind him. As he

yells he calmly runs his palms back over his fringe of hair.

The CLOCK TOLLS.

FREEZE FRAME and SUPER A TITLE.

HOT DOG VENDOR

on the street, handing a steaming frank to a customer who is

handing him some change. As we hear the APPROACHING HUDSUCKER,

both men look up. As the CLOCK TOLLS:

FREEZE FRAME and SUPER A TITLE.

PASSERBY ON SIDEWALK

The man, wearing a fedora, is in the f.g. of an EXTREME LOW

ANGLE whose b.g. is the bottom three or four stories of the

Hudsucker Building.

The passerby reacts to the approaching yell, looking up just

as Hudsucker ENTERS FRAME.

FREEZE FRAME to suspend Hudsucker a good twenty feet above

the sidewalk, arms and legs splayed, comically arrested. The

passerby is frozen in an attitude of surprise and disbelief.

SUPER the title of the film: THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.

UNFREEZE to send Hudsucker plummeting THROUGH the FRAME to

his rendezvous with the sidewalk, BELOW FRAME.

DUTCH ANGLE

The Hudsucker Building lists up into the distance. A woman

in a fancy fruited hat with a black veil rises INTO FRAME AT

an OPPOSING SLANT. Looking down at the sidewalk, she sends

two dismayed hands to her cheek and screeeeeeeeeams.

EXT. TOP FLOOR

With the LAST TOLL of the CLOCK punctuating the CUT, we are

FLOATING IN TOWARDS the shattered board room window.

The woman's SCREAM on the street below is FAINT, ECHOING,

MIXING INTO the sound of an APPROACHING SIREN.

THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting

around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and

disbelief. All stare at the shattered window in the f.g.

At the far end of the table, Hudsucker's chair is empty and

oddly askew. His cigar still smokes in its ashtray.

There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak

table.

One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway to

his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to

his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from

his nose.

We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.

SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window. He is a tall middle-

aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a

commanding presence.

He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his

knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room. The other board members'

heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching desperately

for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader.

Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers.

Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair.

He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suicide's

ashtray.

The other board members unfreeze, their worst fears confirmed.

Stillson shrugs.

Mussburger strides across the room from the still CHATTERING

TICKER TAPE MACHINE and lowers himself into Waring Hudsucker's

chair. He takes a last puff from his cigar and slowly exhales

a cloud of smoke.

SWINGING STEEL DOORS

that read, "MAILROOM." They burst open as Norville, who wears

a mail clerk's leather apron, imprinted: HUDSUCKER

MAILROOM/The Future is Now. The hellish mailroom is criss-

crossed by pipes that emit HISSING jets of STEAM.

As he wheels a piled-high mail cart down the aisle, Norville

is accompanied by an orientation AGENT who bellows at him

over the clamor and roar of many men laboring in the bowels

of a great corporation.

People on either side bellow at Norville and stuff envelopes

and packages under his elbows, into his pockets, under his

chin, between his clenched teeth, etc.

NORVILLE

standing in front of a shelf of cubbyholes. As we FOLLOW his

hand drawing an 8 X 10 envelope across the line of

alphabetized mail slots. The envelope is addressed to Max

Kloppitt, Jr.

He is COASTING ACROSS the "K" mail slots, finally COMES TO

Max Kloppitt, Sr. His hand moves to the next slot, Max

Kloppitt, Jr. This slot is half the size of all the others.

The envelope will not fit in.

He frowns.

He is about to fold the envelope, but notices something

stamped in red on its face. DO NOT FOLD.

Norville frowns. As he stares at the envelope, we see

envelopes swishing across the f.g., whipping one by one in

rapid succession, left to right.

CLOSEUP - ANCIENT SORTER

An old man sitting at the adjacent shelf, sorting mail.

Without ever even looking up, with a constant high-speed

back and forth flicking of his right hand, he is whisking

pieces of mail one by one out of the pile of mail in his

left hand.

ANCIENT SORTER'S SHELF

As his letters fly furiously but neatly into their mail slots.

NORVILLE

He raises his voice over the mailroom din:

The ANCIENT SORTER considers this as he continues whisking

his mail.

Whisk. Whisk. Whisk.

Norville takes out a pencil and writes on the face of the

envelope:

INSERT - LETTER

Dear Mr. Kloppit, Please give this letter to your son. Thank

you, Norville Barnes.

After a moment he adds:

Your friend in the mailroom.

BACK TO SCENE

Norville is taking an envelope from his pocket and handing

it to the Ancient Sorter.

The Ancient Sorter is pulling a ragged piece of paper from

the envelope. On the paper is a crudely-drawn circle.

The Ancient Sorter looks questioningly from the circle to

Norville.

The Ancient Sorter nods with feigned understanding as Norville

takes the paper back.

He resumes his sorting.

Whisk. Whisk.

Whisk. Whisk. Whisk.

A BELL CLANGS.

The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM SPUTTERS to life.

All HUBBUB ABRUPTLY STOPS and the sounds of HEAVY MACHINERY,

HISSING STEAM PIPES, and GENERATORS WIND DOWN TO leave total

SILENCE. After a moment:

The MACHINERY GROANS back INTO ACTION and the people return

to their jobs just as:

A STEAM WHISTLE SCREECHES.

ALARM BELLS go OFF.

From the PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM:

The mail room is thrown into pandemonium.

One MAN spins to face the CAMERA, his hands pressed over his

ears. STEAM JETS and HISSES behind him.

Animated for the first time:

Mail carts and other paraphernalia are abruptly swept out of

the crowded aisle to form a clear path running down to an

elevator in the b.g.

With a SIREN SOUND, a light above the elevator goes on.

The elevator door sweeps open. It reveals a wall into which

a four-foot high hinged door is set.

This door swings open and an old dwarf emerges: Old man

HUTCHINSON, the boss of the mailroom. He emerges from the

blinding light of the interior of the elevator.

He is holding aloft a letter.

He takes loping drawf strides down the aisle.

CLOSEUP - LETTER

TRACKING ON letter as Hutchinson bears it along. In the b.g.,

the faces that the letter passes are agog.

CROSSCUT the approaching blue letter WITH: Norville and the

Ancient Sorter.

BACK TO SCENE

The Ancient Sorter is leaning over to whisper into Norville's

ear.

Norville gulps.

Norville looks over his shoulder, but the Ancient Sorter has

disappeared.

As he points, the people around Norville shrink away.

DRAMATIC TRACK IN ON Norville. As Hutchinson talks, he thrusts

the blue letter into Norville's face. Norville looks at it

with terrific apprehension. As Hutchinson's speech ends, we

are TIGHT ON Norville's sweating face.

COMPLEMENTARY TIGHT DUTCH ANGLE ON HUTCHINSON

We can see the veins in his eyes, the veins in his nose, the

hairs in his ears.

ELEVATOR DOORS

ROCKETING OPEN. We MOVE IN ON the young elevator operator

who leers INTO CAMERA. He wears a brass-buttoned uniform,

white gloves and a pillbox hat. The name BUZZ is stitched

onto his breast pocket.

As Norville enters the elevators:

He lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut, then

lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his

head.

He holds out his hand but as Norville reaches to shake it he

snaps it away and pats down his crewcut:

He cackles and powers the ELEVATOR into GEAR. Norville's

knees buckle under a huge upward surge; Buzz is accustomed

to it.

With a powerful DOWN-SHIFTING SOUND, Buzz brakes the elevator

to a sharp halt. Norville continues upward with the inertia,

painfully smacking his head against a corner of the elevator.

Buzz opens the door and a couple of people enter.

An obese MAN enters, smoking a cigar:

Buzz has already thrown the doors shut and sent the elevator

into its power-rise. Norville, bracing himself now, sinks

only a little under the G-force.

He turns to look at Norville.

All heads in the elevator turn, aghast, to look, and those

near Norville shrink away.

The ELEVATOR SCREAMS into overdrive and we:

ELEVATOR DOORS

Sweeping open. Norville staggers out.

The door sweeps shut. Norville looks nervously around.

Behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again.

The elevator doors slam shut and we hear its ENGINES SCREAM

as it power-dives away.

Norville turns toward the executive offices.

Plush, thick-carpeted silence.

Norville starts walking.

A SCRAPING SOUND stands out in the high-powered executive

quiet. Norville looks to one side.

A workman in painter's overalls squats in front of a pair of

heavy oak doors. With a razor blade he is scraping off the

name "WARING HUDSUCKER."

The scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at Norville.

With a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction.

Norville enters the adjacent office.

OUTER OFFICE

Two secretaries are in Mussburger's outer reception office.

The first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the

f.g., her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a folder,

as she stares at Norville with an amused and supercilious

sneer which stays pasted on throughout.

The second secretary -- the RECEPTIONIST -- is seated behind

a desk in the b.g. that flanks the door to Mussburger's

private office. The Receptionist sits with her hands clasped

on the desk, staring at Norville with the hunch-shouldered

down-from-under look of a patient vulture.

The filing secretary sneers.

She opens an enormous leather-bound book with yellowed crinkly

pages.

Norville is groping in his apron pocket.

A low, unearthly WAIL fills the room, the sound of a million

souls moaning in purgatory.

The Receptionist looks up.

FAST TRACK IN ON SNEERING FILE SECRETARY

who is no longer sneering. Her mouth is stretched wide as

she wails and her finger points...

FAST TRACK IN ON BLUE LETTER

that Norville holds innocently at his side.

BACK TO TRACK IN ON WAILING SECRETARY

As her wail becomes deafening and we TRACK INTO her mouth

and the SCREEN GOES BLACK and:

CLICK

The blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the sound

of a DOOR OPENING. We are:

INT. MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE

its door swinging open to admit Norville.

In the b.g., in the outer office, we can see the filing

secretary leaning back motionless in a chair with a damp rag

draped across her forehead. The Receptionist is fanning her

with a towel.

The door closes behind Norville.

We hear a rhythmic CLICK-CLICK-CLICK and the HUM of

VENTILATION.

NORVILLE'S POV

Across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk, behind which

is a large executive chair facing the window. From above the

back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up. A telephone cord

snakes around to the man sitting in the chair, hidden from

us. On the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large

swinging ball bearings. Click-click-click.

A TICKERTAPE MACHINE occasionally BURPS information in the

far corner of the office.

A huge MECHANICAL ARM -- the sweep second hand of the

Hudsucker clock on the facade of the building -- RUMBLES by

immediately outside the window, describing an arc that throws

a moving shadow across the office.

His BACK TO us, into the phone:

He swivels around to face Norville, who stands deferentially

at the door. Still listening at the phone, Mussburger waves

Norville forward.

He covers the mouth piece.

Into the phone:

The INTERCOM BUZZES fiercely.

Mussburger hits the intercom.

But Mussburger is listening to the TINNY VOICE issuing from

the PHONE.

The INTERCOM SQUAWKS.

The second PHONE on Mussburger's desk RINGS.

Norville clears his throat.

He reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper

across the desk to Mussburger, who stares, frozen, at

Norville, making no move to take the paper.

Norville, undaunted, holds up the paper since Mussburger

will not take it. Mussburger doesn't even look at it; his

eyes are locked on Norville's. Mussburger smolders.

Mussburger's burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look

at the crudely drawn circle; he looks back incredulously at

Norville.

Sudden quiet.

With one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings

abruptly stop.

As Mussburger's eyes burn in on him, Norville stands mute

and paralyzed.

His eyes locked on Norville's, Mussburger circles the desk.

He stands toe-to-toe with Norville.

He thrusts his face into Norville's, whose head moves

reflexively back. Mussburger's nose is almost touching

Norville's, his eyes are burning, searching, studying,

evaluating.

Finally he draws his head back.

With one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norville's gaping

mouth. With his other hand he raises Norville's chin so that

his teeth clench it.

He steps back, eyes still on Norville.

He jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating his chair

behind the desk.

Norville, his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger,

looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger.

Norville obeys, reluctantly, stiffly.

Norville is again reluctant.

Norville obeys. Mussburger studies.

Norville's eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing

from between his teeth. Mussburger seems to relax.

Norville beams.

He waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a

euphemism.

Norville sputters out some more cigar smoke.

Norville shakes his head.

As he struggles to comply:

Norville, squinting against the cigar smoke, pulls the cigar

out of his mouth as he doubles forward, feet still up, groping

for a place to set down the cigar. He sets it blindly on a

loose stack of papers.

The top page radiates a circle of incipient flame from the

cigar's live end.

Norville runs across the office to a large water cooler.

Mussburger plucks the cigar off the contract and tosses it

into a wastebasket. He pats the fingertips of one hand against

his tongue and then efficiently pats out the crinkling orange

circle on the top sheet of the contract.

At the other end of the office, Norville is wrapping his

arms around the glass water tank, which he pulls off its

base. He runs back across the vast expanse of office toward

the desk, hugging the water tank whose WATER GLOOB-GLOOBS

out its open bottom and splashes down onto his pumping knees.

As he reaches the desk, the near-empty tank is now light

enough for him to hoist with one arm, which he does, and

cups his other hand under it to catch its last glub of water.

He tosses the TANK to the floor where --

CRASH -- it SHATTERS, and stands looking about for a place

to dump his handful of water.

He is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the desk,

which Mussburger cannot see.

It is sprouting flame, at which Norville ineffectually flecks

his remaining drops of water.

Norville is already running to the window, which he runs

both palms over, desperately seeking a way to open it.

The windows do not open. Norville furiously stomps on the

flames in the wastebasket and -- his foot sticks.

Further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket roar up

and down with his foot.

Norville has dropped to the floor, trying to wrench the

flaming wastebasket off his leg.

Norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming wastebasket

off his foot. Now the problem is what to do with it.

Norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle.

He winds up and throws it through the closed window.

The GLASS SHATTERS and the flaming basket plummets to

oblivion.

With the picture window broken a FEROCIOUS DRAFT ROARS through

the penthouse office.

CLOSE SHOT - BUMSTEAD CONTRACTS

On the desk. The pages are sucked away by the draft.

Mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked out

the window.

He runs, jumps onto the sill, grabs -- his fist clenches

around one wafting page -- he is about to fall --

INT. EXECUTIVE WAITING ROOM

BUMSTEAD, a short, fat, heavily perspiring executive, is

screaming at an O.S. secretary. He holds a pot of coffee in

one hand and a copy of Boy's Life in the other.

In the window behind him we see loose sheets of paper

fluttering down.

NORVILLE

Desperately hanging onto Mussburger by his legs.

Mussburger's screaming abruptly stops.

CLOSEUP - MUSSBURGER'S HORROR-STRICKEN FACE REMEMBERING (THE

SCREEN GOES WATERY):

MUSSBURGER

is in a basement tailor shop. LUIGI, an old Italian tailor,

is just running his tape up Mussburger's inseam.

CLOSEUP OF PANICKED MUSSBURGER

We hear a LOUD TEARING sound O.S. Mussburger drops a few

inches.

LUIGI AT HIS SEWING MACHINE

BACK TO MUSSBURGER'S PANTS

The tearing fabric abruptly catches and stops; the rest of

the pants hold intact.

MUSSBURGER

sighs with relief.

He looks up.

NORVILLE

Norville's arms are wrapped around Mussburger's ankles; the

heels of Mussburger's shoes are digging into his face.

MUSSBURGER

Looking. Thinking.

NORVILLE

Struggling to hold on.

MUSSBURGER

Calm. Contemplating.

He absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and sticks

it in his mouth. He holds his lighter under the cigar, not

noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong way.

He looks at Norville.

NORVILLE

His face drawn with effort, still struggling to hang on.

A PULL BACK FROM the EXTREME CLOSE SHOT REVEALS, however,

that Norville's arms are now wrapped around -- emptiness.

Mussburger's legs are gone.

Norville throws his head back and laughs, it seems, insanely --

but CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that Norville is merely

pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of the board

members, including Mussburger. They stand around Mussburger's

office, laughing gaily. All safe now, no harm done. This

inaugurates:

LAUGHING MONTAGE

Montage silent but for MUSIC.

A) Norville is entertaining the board with his depiction of

the near-disaster. Mussburger is slapping him merrily on the

back.

B) CLOSE SHOT - Board member laughing.

C) Another board member. Laughing.

D) Mussburger. Laughing.

E) Norville laughing.

F) FREEZE FRAME ON Norville's laughing face.

ANGLE

PULL BACK to reveal that the frozen picture is the newspaper

photo on the front page of the Manhattan Argus.

Its headline reads: UNTRIED YOUTH TO HELM HUDSUCKER.

The subhead reads: Stockholders Wary. The sub-subhead reads:

Meteoric Rise From Mailroom.

The article is under the byline of Amy Archer.

CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that we are looking at the

newspaper OVER someone's SHOULDER. The person swivels around

and away -- his face now TO us, we see that it is Norville

looking at the newspaper. He throws his head back and laughs

merrily.

As he laughs -- thwock -- a steaming towel is thrown onto

his face and he continues to swivel. CONTINUED PULL BACK

REVEALS that he is in a barber chair.

His head drops back and OUT OF FRAME as the swiveling chair

is cranked down, but immediately -- still spinning --

-- his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again.

Still laughing, Norville is now freshly shaven and has a

slicked-back haircut, heavy with pomade.

FREEZE ON Norville's laughing face.

ANGLE

PULL BACK to reveal it is another front page photo next to

the headline: Hud Board To Street: GIVE MAN FROM MUNCIE A

CHANCE. Subhead: Has Fresh Ideas.

CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that the paper is lying on a

chair. Norville's mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to

cover it.

PAN TO where the apron was tossed from. Norville stands on a

tailor's stage, laughing, as the tailor, also laughing, takes

his measurements. Norville in shirtsleeves, boxer shorts,

hose stockings and garters.

The tailor rises, laughing merrily, throwing up his arms and

spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape.

Norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide.

BOARD MEMBER

laughs merrily, his arms thrown wide, tickertape stretching

between his hands. He joyously tosses away the tickertape.

FLOOR

where the tickertape lands on a pile of previously discharged

tape.

PAN UP to reveal that the tickertape continues to burp its

disastrous tale of good news for the board.

PAN UP FURTHER to reveal that the machine is in Mussburger's

office. At the far end of the room, behind his desk,

Mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper.

TRACK IN TOWARDS him.

On his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing; outside his

window the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock rumbles

by, sweeping a shadow across the floor. Evil prevails.

As Mussburger opens the newspaper, the CONTINUED TRACK IN

shows its front page headline: HUD STOCK DIPS. Subhead: Just

Good Is He?

TRACK IN ON the front page photo: Norville laughing, his

chin propped in his hand.

PHOTOGRAPH

COMES TO LIFE and Norville unfreezes, laughing.

We are now TRACKING BACK FROM him. He sits behind a huge oak

desk, newly coifed and tailored.

The brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the OFFICE

OF THE PRESIDENT.

TRACK BACK CONTINUES THROUGH the large elegant office, leaving

Norville looking quite small IN LONG SHOT.

His LAUGHTER ECHOES in the bright bare office.

Norville's laughter is just winding down, leaving him

exhausted, as if he has been laughing nonstop for several

days. He finally sighs and wipes a tear from his eye.

FADE IN:

NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY

In the skyline we can see the Hudsucker building topped by

the Hudsucker clock.

A cigar ENTERS FRAME in the f.g., then the face of the man

smoking it. Staring contemplatively at the Hudsucker building,

he takes a puff from the cigar and then plucks it from his

mouth and waves it, as if painting a headline.

REVERSE

shows the Editors glassed-in office filled with REPORTERS

for the staff meeting. Although they listen quietly, they

are more bored than attentive.

THROUGH the glass walls we can see the furious activity of

an army of reporters, editors, and copy boys waging the never-

ending battle to put out a quality daily newspaper.

The Editor slams a newspaper down onto his desk in disgust.

Whack! --

Without even looking in its direction, the Editor has slammed

down the lid of the cigar box on his desk, towards which one

Reporter's hand had been idly reaching.

The Reporter jerks his fingers away as the Editor spares the

briefest moment to glare at him.

He thrust his face into that of the Reporter.

No answer.

WOMAN

Star reporter AMY ARCHER -- attractive, smartly-dressed.

One Reporter is leaning into another to keep his voice low:

Whack! The Editor has slammed down the cigar box lid again

but: Amy, smiling, raises a cigar INTO FRAME having beaten

him.

She tosses it to the Reporter who failed to get one.

Slam!

One of the wagering Reporters grins at the other, who is

taking out a five dollar bill.

The door bursts open and Amy sticks her head in.

ELEVATOR DOORS

Sweeping open to reveal the leering face of Buzz, the elevator

gnat.

Norville is entering the elevator in his new executive outfit.

Buzz is instant decorum as Mussburger enters the elevator.

Norville has been worriedly patting at his pockets since the

mention of the blue letter.

As he talks, Mussburger pats at his suit pocket, takes out a

cigar, inspects it.

He puts the cigar in his mouth and Buzz's hand is right there

with a lighter.

The elevator doors open.

Buzz turns to Norville. He is puzzled but trying to hide it:

MR. MUSSBURGER

is already striding through the lobby; Norville has to lope

to catch up.

Mussburger gives an artificially hearty laugh and claps

Norville on the shoulder.

EXT. SIDEWALK

Norville is still loping behind Mussburger, trying to keep

up with his long strides.

A black limousine pulls up to the curb.

Mussburger is getting into the back seat --

And, to Norville's surprise, slamming the door shut behind

him.

SCREEEECH -- the CAR pulls away. Norville is left talking to

himself on the empty sidewalk.

INT. COFFEE SHOP

A cheap coffee shop a half-flight down from the street.

We are LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the coffee shop counter.

In the middle b.g., Norville sits dejectedly stirring a cup

of coffee.

Behind him, THROUGH the window wells, we see the back and

forth feet of pedestrians bustling by on the sidewalk.

In the extreme f.g. sit two steaming mugs of coffee.

They belong to two VETERANS of the coffee shop, who, from

O.S., narrate the scene.

He gives a low whistle under his breath as a woman enters

from the street and hesitates by the door, looking around.

Still attractive but looking somewhat down-at-the-heels, it

is Amy Archer.

The woman's eyes settle on Norville, and she heads for the

empty stool next to his.

The woman says something to the counter waitress, who exits.

She is holding her wallet upside down.

Beat. Norville, however, is not noticing: He is staring

intently at his coffee spoon, his hat pushed back on his

head, his other hand propping up a cheekbone; the woman's

presence does not seem to have registered yet.

The woman starts crying.

As the woman cries, she accidentally-on-purpose jostles

Norville and he finally does indeed notice.

The woman mouths words at Norville who reacts sympathetically

and waves his hands at the waitress.

The waitress is entering to set a plate in front of the woman.

The woman continues to talk to Norville, smiling wanly at

him.

Veteran #1's enunciation of "lumbago" falls into perfect

sync with the woman's moving lips.

Norville is listening sympathetically, but he suddenly notices

his watch.

Norville is rising to his feet.

As Norville turns to leave:

She puts the back of her hand dramatically to her forehead.

And indeed she does: Faint dead away, falling backwards on

the stool, so that Norville has no choice but to catch her.

Norville holds her awkwardly, looking around for help.

A WAITRESS enters extreme f.g. to BLOCK OUR VIEW of the

swooned woman and the embarrassed Norville. The Waitress is

FACING the CAMERA and the two O.S. Veterans; the CROPPING

gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she

holds.

REVERSE ANGLE

Back of the Waitress's torso in f.g.; on either side beyond

her, the two Veterans are looking up at her O.S. face. They

sport extremely bored expressions, topped by "cabbie" caps.

Beat.

INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

Looking at its frosted-glass door; the sign painter is just

finishing lettering in: NORVILLE BARNES, President.

The sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow

approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he

is WHEEZING HEAVILY. He is apparently carrying the girl,

cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the

doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against

the door and get the knob with his other hand.

The door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is

wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode.

He swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the

lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see,

in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN

tnediserP.

Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms:

Still wheezing horribly, Norville staggers over to the couch

and deposits her gently on it. He straightens up and looks

at her.

NORVILLE'S POV

She is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA. The entire IMAGE PULSATES

as the blood pounds behind Norville's eyeballs.

We hear the LOUD, RASPING of his BREATH, resonating inside

his head. Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as

if coming from a long way away.

BACK TO SCENE

He perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his

head between his knees, still fighting for breath.

Speaking into his knees as he wheezes:

Norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind her

head.

She screams, staring down at the couch.

Norville jumps, startled, then looks where she is looking.

On the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is

printed, in wet ink, right side around: NORVILLE BARNES,

President.

Norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion. When the

nickel finally drops, he spins around to try to look at the

seat of his pants.

Distracted but still modest:

He unbuckles his trousers.

Buzz enters holding a brown paper bag.

He freezes, taking in the scene: Amy reclining on the couch;

Norville standing in front of her with his pants around his

ankles, still breathing heavily; the bottle of whiskey in

his own hand.

Leering:

As he turns to leave:

He snaps the elastic strap under his chin.

After the doors shut behind Buzz:

Norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to her.

He crosses back to the desk.

Norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette box

on the desk and sticks it in his mouth.

OVER NORVILLE'S SHOULDER

He has been pushing the box towards her. The box tilts lazily

forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk. We

hear the THUD of the BOX landing amid the pitter-patter of

cigarettes raining onto the carpet.

Amy's brow crinkles. Continuing:

He is pouring himself a drink.

He tosses back his drink, gags, looks at Amy with his eyes

bulging.

HIS POV

Once again her IMAGE PULSATES. There is a ROARING SOUND and

an AIRY STEAM WHISTLE as she silently moves her lips.

He staggers out a side door.

On his exit Amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to his

desk. At the top of her voice:

She throws open the top desk drawer. Inside two lonely lead

pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer.

Amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a

match off the desktop.

From the washroom:

Amy throws open another drawer, empty except for an

appointment book. As she hurriedly flips through page after

blank page an arctic WIND WHISTLES emptiness. One page only

has a notation: 11:45. Address Wilkie Grammar School Junior

Achievers Club.

Amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer.

She mutters:

She hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to

disperse the smoke.

She scurries back across the room as we hear the FAUCET BEING

TURNED OFF: she re-strikes her languid pose on the couch

just as the washroom door opens.

Norville gapes, one hand pressing a dripping rag to his

forehead.

Norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and

loud syncopated grunting noises. Amy gapes at him.

He starts singing, off-key:

Amy lamely fakes singing along, coming in louder on the last,

obvious rhyme. Norville jumps an octave on it; she quickly

follows sit, also pumping her fists.

As Norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of

his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers:

Amy awkwardly imitates.

Norville excitedly sits behind his desk.

He hits the intercom.

To Amy:

Norville thumps at his pockets.

CLICK. The intercom goes dead.

Norville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm.

As he reaches to shake:

She reaches for his hand but Norville snatches it away and,

winking at her, hooks thumbs in front of his nose and makes

wings of his fingers.

AMY

likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose, makes wings,

and, winking back:

But we PULL BACK to reveal that the girl is now in a newspaper

office, demonstrating the fight sign to SMITTY, a reporter

wearing a fedora with a bent-back brim. Smitty howls with

laughter.

Amy sits down behind a typewriter and, as she starts typing

at 80 words per minute:

Behind her an ancient man wearing an inksman's visor and

sleeve garters toils over a large checkerboarded surface

over which he shuffles letter blocks and black spaces.

Smitty gives a low whistle.

The PHONE RINGS and Smitty reaches for it.

Without a break in her typing:

Smitty holds the phone away from his ear.

Still typing, Amy whistles and nods to her shoulder.

Smitty tucks the phone into it as she continues typing.

Smitty is looking at his watch.

To the Ancient Puzzler:

Back into phone:

Her eyes narrow.

To Morris:

Into phone:

To Morris:

Into phone:

To Morris:

She slams down the phone. To Smitty:

Smitty bursts out laughing.

As she continues to type:

She rips the page out of the typewriter, swivels in her chair

to FACE CAMERA as we TRACK IN CLOSE and she hollers:

PRESSES

rolling, churning out great quantities of newsprint.

Papers piling up one on top of the other, very many, very

quickly.

DELIVERY MAN

throwing a baled stack of papers off the back of his truck.

BALED PAPER

rolling into the f.g. A hand ENTERS FRAME to snip its wires

and wipe off the top paper.

PAPER BOY

wearing an apron and a little paper boy cap, mouthing "Extra!

Extra!" as he holds one of the papers aloft.

PAN UP his arm TO the newspaper and, BEYOND it, the towering

Hudsucker Building.

All of the above --

NEWSPAPER

spinning TOWARDS the CAMERA and STOPPING FULL FRAME.

Its headline, over a picture of Norville smiling, is "IMBECILE

HEADS HUDSUCKER." The subheadline: "Not a Brain in his Head."

ANOTHER ANGLE - NEWSPAPER

is angrily slammed down to reveal that Norville has been

reading the inside.

His face twisting with fury, he leans forward and hits the

intercom.

Muttering to himself:

Amy is bustling in holding a steno pad and a pencil.

As she seats herself in front of his desk, he rises to pace

behind it.

He drifts into thought.

He whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an

easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a circle

rendered onto it.

Amy looks, puzzled, from the circle to Norville's proudly

beaming face.

Amy is bewildered. Norville explains:

She gets up to leave, and is heading for the door when

Norville adds:

Amy turns at the door.

Whap! Amy slaps him.

He stares.

As she stalks out of the office:

He stares, rubbing his cheek.

WHISTLE

SHRIEKING.

CLOCK

Reading five o'clock.

WORKERS

Rising from their desks, collecting personal effects, putting

on their hats and coats.

TIME CLOCK

Busy hands punch out.

INT. EMPTY HALLWAY

Of the executive floor. A security man walks down the hall,

whistling, swinging a ring of keys. After he passes the door

to the ladies' room it opens, Amy peeks out, emerges, goes

into Norville's office.

INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

She goes to the desk, takes out the appointment book, flips

through it.

BOOK

Still empty except for the one date with the Wilkie Grammer

School Junior Achievers Club, which now has a red line drawn

across it with the notation CANCELED.

AMY

looks around the office -- notices something.

DOOR

Set into the wall to one side it is topped by a small plaque:

AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

Amy tries the knob, which turns, and enters.

INT. ROOM

It is big and dim, several stories high, with spiral

staircases reaching into, and catwalks criss-crossing, the

gloom above. It is filled with contraptions -- works, cogs,

gears. There is no window, but on what would be the window

wall there is an enormous iron ring with a metal rod sweeping

an interior circle. It is the backside of the great Hudsucker

clock.

Amy gazes about. She crosses to a door opposite the one she

entered from.

She stoops to peek through its keyhole.

HER POV

We are LOOKING INTO Sidney J. Mussburger's office.

Mussburger sits at his desk barking into a Dictaphone.

CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS on his desk

are going full-tilt; THRUMMMMMMM -- the CLOCK'S exterior

second hand sweeps a shadow across the office.

Mussburger, it seems, never sleeps.

BACK TO SCENE

She straightens and turns.

Facing her is a very old BLACK MAN in a janitor's jumpsuit

with HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES/The Future Is Now emblazoned across

it. We might recognize his voice as that of the narrator who

opened the movie.

He draws a circle with his finger in the air.

To punctuate, he gives a little jerk of his hips.

She is answered only by WHIRRING MACHINERY.

MOSES

Elsewhere in the great room, he is hunkered down next to a

catchment which he buffs with a greasy rag. Amy's VOICE ECHOES

UP:

As OMINOUS MUSIC SWELLS, we --

FADE IN:

INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE

He slams down a typescript.

He gives her a companionable goose.

She whirls and slaps him.

Smitty rubs his cheek, staring as she storms off.

ENGRAVED INVITATION

IT READS:

Sidney J. Mussburger President Norville Barnes and The Board

of Hudsucker Industries CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO The Annual

Fancy-Dress Hudsucker Christmas Gala Music, Dancing,

Refreshments (Dainties) Formal Evening Attire de Rigeuer.

The MUSIC OVER the invitation -- "WE WISH YOU A MERRY

CHRISTMAS" -- SEGUES INTO the dance music of the Hudsucker

Chamber Orchestra.

DANCING COUPLES

FILL the SCREEN; we GLIDE AMONG them and FINALLY COME to

follow one couple: Norville and MRS. MUSSBURGER, a large

middle-aged woman of the Margaret Dumont-mold in an

elaborately flowered and old-fashioned evening gown, low-cut

in spite of her overly-heavy figure. She wears a large

flowered hat with a rolled-up veil.

She throws her head back and roars with laughter.

ANGLE - THEIR FEET

As the large woman leans back to laugh, her feet stay planted

on the ground and Norville's rise to be dragged with his

toes scraping the floor through the continuing dance.

Mussburger has ENTERED FRAME.

MIXING DOWN as they leave her:

ENTRYWAY

As Amy enters in a simple yet stunning evening gown. She

looks around the room, then starts across the crowded floor

towards the punch bowl.

NORVILLE

As Mussburger introduces him to a tall, imposing BUSINESSMAN

in a tuxedo and a ten-gallon hat.

Ignoring Norville's proffered hand:

Norville gives him a forced but hearty laugh of reassurance.

He starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket:

His WIFE, a small wiry woman, steps in as Mussburger starts

dragging Norville away.

As he reluctantly starts shrugging back into the jacket:

MUSSBURGER AND NORVILLE

As they make their way through the room Norville is mopping

at his brow with a handkerchief.

Thump! Dabbing at his brow, Norville has walked square into

the back of a debonaire man holding a martini.

The drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him.

Norville nervously pumps Findlandsen's hand.

Findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at Norville's

handkerchief which he now holds himself, apparently having

been given it during the handshake.

He hands it back to Norville.

He stuffs it nervously into his outside breast pocket as

Findlandsen stares at him. Mussburger stands watching in the

executive at-ease, hands dug into his pockets.

As Norville's hand drops from his breast pocket the

handkerchief, perhaps caught on his sleeve, whips out of the

pocket and follows his hand down.

Findlandsen looks down and Norville follows his look, and

stoops BELOW FRAME to retrieve the hanky.

Findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at

Norville, who continues, O.S.

In rapid fire, Norville straightens up into -- crunch --

Findlandsen, whose head snaps back, eyes rolling, a hand

pressed to his nose, drink sloshing; Norville, one hand

pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly

waving his hanky for balance, takes a staggering step forward

onto the toe of an elegantly-gowned MRS. FINDLANDSEN.

There is a drum roll and, as the lights dim:

EMCEE

grabs the large old-fashioned microphone in front of the

band and grins.

Vic Tenetta takes the microphone from the Emcee who backs

away, applauding as Tenetta starts to croon. He wears a white

dinner jacket. His jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead

in a roguishly pompadoured mat; one forelock droops and

bounces across his forehead.

SEVERAL BOARD MEMBERS

Clustered in a dim corner of the room, smoking cigars.

In the b.g., brilliantly spotlit, Vic Tenetta continues his

song.

As Mussburger joins them:

EXT. PENTHOUSE - TERRACE

where the PARTY NOISE is DISTANT, TENETTA'S SONG just

FILTERING OUT.

We are on a FULL SHOT of the back of a man who stands facing

the twinkling cityscape, but in an odd, leanedback posture,

with one hand reaching up to his hidden face, his other hand

pressed against the small of his back, like a man with a

stiff neck tossing back a drink.

REVERSE

Amy, having just emerged onto the terrace, squints at him.

He turns and we see that it is indeed Norville, holding a

dripping icepack against one eye.

He does.

As she rolls the pack gently across his eye:

They gaze out at the city.

She nods out at the city to avoid Norville's quizzical look.

Morosely:

He slaps his fist into his palm.

Sadly:

She gives him a peck. They look at each other.

She embraces him. They kiss again.

Norville's eyes widen.

VIC TENETTA

Crooning the end of his song.

DANCING COUPLES

Turn to the bandstand and applaud.

NORVILLE AND AMY

In the midst of a passionate kiss.

FADE IN:

DOUBLE OAK DOORS

Labeled "Executive Conference Room." A secretary is hanging

up a sign that reads: "Quiet Please! Board Meeting in

Session."

INT. BOARDROOM - CLOSE ON NORVILLE

Chest and up. His upper torso is swaying, his shoulders

rhythmically rolling as he talks. We hear a WHOOSH WHOOSH

sound from O.S.

CLOSE ON MUSSBURGER

Staring. Holding a just-lighted but forgotten cigar in one

hand, and a still burning match in the other.

BOARD

Staring, mouths hanging open, in arrested motion much like

when Waring Hudsucker jumped out the window at the previous

board meeting.

WIDER ON NORVILLE

Still gyrating. We now see that he has accelerated the hula

hoop around his waist to quite a good speed.

Mussburger's forgotten match has burned down to his

fingertips. With a wince, he shakes it out.

The Board is staring.

The Board looks at Mussburger.

He smiles weakly at Norville.

As furiously BUSY MUSIC STARTS:

TELETYPE

Furiously PRINTING out "EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE #37451-JL7.

A hand ENTERS FRAME and rips the directive from the teletype,

then hurriedly rolls it into a cylinder and slips it into a

cylindrical metal capsule.

The capsule is popped into a pneumatic tube.

ANGLE - LENGTH OF PNEUMATIC PIPING

somewhere in the labyrinthine substructure of the Hudsucker

Building. We hear a MISSILE furiously HURTLING towards us,

inside the pipe, and ROCKETING by.

ANGLE ON ANOTHER LENGTH OF PIPING

Once again we hear the CAPSULE APPROACH and ROCKET past.

BLINDING RED LIGHTS

as a SIREN BLARES. On a huge board that says HUDSUCKER DESIGN

DEPARTMENT, flashing red letters announce: INCOMING DIRECTIVE!

The pneumatic tube spout shoots out a cylinder, and a hand

eagerly picks it up and yanks it OUT OF FRAME.

A technician in white laboratory smock is reading the

directive as several other white-jacketed technicians crowd

their heads around his shoulders, also reading.

All of their eye and head motions synchronize as they eagerly

read, devouring the document line by line.

A large sheet of graph paper is whipped down on top of a

drafting table. Under the caption OVERHEAD ANGLE is a perfect

circle. Under the caption HORIZONTAL is a horizontal line.

Under the caption VERTICAL SIDE ANGLE is a vertical line.

EXTREME LOW ANGLE - SEVERAL TECHNICIANS

looking thoughtfully down at the rendering. The head

technician is stroking his beard and nodding.

RENDERING

as a hand ENTERS FRAME and stamps the drawing approved.

TWO MORE LENGTHS OF PNEUMATIC PIPE

as we hear the CYLINDER ROCKETING by.

FROSTED DOUBLE GLASS DOORS

Lettered on the frosted glass is: "ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT

Creative Bullpen." In sharp silhouette on the frosted glass

we can see the three admen working inside.

Two pace back and forth, smoking cigarettes, as they toss

out ideas. The third sits slumped in front of a silhouette

typewriter, his head resting on one hand, his other hand

resting on a half-empty bottle of whiskey.

In the f.g., outside the frosted glass and so not in

silhouette, sits a bored secretary reading War and Peace,

Volume One.

PNEUMATIC PIPING

With the cylinder rocketing by.

"ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT" WALL PLAQUE

HUGE POSTER

Up on the wall of the accounting floor is an enormous

reproduction of the design department's rendering of the

hula hoop. Over the poster is an enormous banner: "WHAT WILL

THIS COST?"

PAN FROM the poster TO a HIGH ANGLE SHOT of a floor full of

accountants sitting at their rows and rows of desks; all are

looking up at the wall poster as they operate their manual

adding machines to the same beat.

All accountants wear identical vests, shirtsleeves, garters,

visors and spectacles.

The head accountant stands in front of the room overseeing

their efforts. He wears a full three-piece suit, a visor and

a pince-nez.

HUGE BOOK

Being dropped onto a desk. Its cover reads: SUMMARY OF COST

ANALYSIS.

The book is opened and its pages, filled with rows of numbers,

are flipped to the last page where we QUICKLY PAN DOWN TO

the bottom line: Unit Cost... $0.59 Suggested Retail... $0.79

EXECUTIVE

Looking down at the book as the head accountant hovers over

his shoulder, waiting for his reaction.

The executive grimly shakes his head.

BACK TO BOOK

As the accountant's hand ENTERS FRAME to scratch in "$1" in

front of the suggested retail of $0.79.

A hand ENTERS FRAME to stamp the bottom line: APPROVED.

ROCKETING PNEUMATIC PIPES

in asbestos suits throwing down their visors as they scurry

and dive for cover behind banks of sandbags. A fierce

EXPLOSION harshly illuminates the sandbags. As the EXPLOSION

SUBSIDES:

The workmen cautiously peek out over the sandbags, then flip

back their visors and rise to their feet.

THEIR POV

Bouncing among the flaming debris of the explosion is a hula

hoop, still intact.

ROCKETING PIPES

ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT CREATIVE BULLPEN

The secretary in the f.g. is now reading Anna Karenina.

The silhouetted ad men, frustrated and hoarse, are still at

it.

The third ad man, slouched motionless at the typewriter up

until now, finally raises his head.

PIECE OF ART PAPER

Printed at the top: Hudsucker Industries Proudly Presents

PAN DOWN to reveal: THE HULA HOOP

PAN DOWN to reveal:

An artist's hand working in fast motion to render the hula

hoop logo: A grinning, healthy 1950s boy with a spray of

freckles, one fist thrown forward, the other behind, as if

doing an athletic frug, a hula hoop spinning with action

lines around his waist.

In seconds the artist has completed the logo and now, also

in fast motion, he writes the slogan on either side of the

boy: "You know... For Kids!"

As the page is ripped off the art pad:

PAGE

being carried away in a continuous motion by an engineer who

looks at it, nodding. We see that we are now in an enormous

plant area. The engineer, grimy from his labors in this sweaty

industrial realm, reaches up to pull an enormous lever.

MACHINES

GRINDING into motion.

DONUT SPOUT

As it begins to spit hula hoops in massive numbers.

The hoops are spit onto a long metal arm where they rest,

hanging.

A bale of hula hoops is loaded into a Hudsucker truck to

complete its load. The truck door is slammed shut.

IRON GRILL

is thrown up to reveal the display window of a shop just

opening for the day.

In the window is an enormous hula hoop display, with various

hoops strung up on wire in front of a large cardboard diorama --

"You know... for Kids!"

Reflected in the display window we see crowds of people

scurrying by, indifferent to the display. Inside the shop we

see the proprietor by the cash register, his chin propped

glumly in his hands.

INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

Norville sits anxiously awaiting the verdict of Amy who sits

hunched over the ticker-tape machine, studying the emerging

tape. Amy finally looks up at Norville and sadly shakes her

head.

BACK TO SHOP WINDOW

Crowds still scurry indifferently by. The shopkeeper stands

idly in his doorway, smoking a cigarette.

We TRACK IN ON the cardboard display. The displayed price of

$1.79 has been crossed out. Underneath it, inked in: "Reduced:

$1.59."

INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

Norville is nervously pacing. Amy still studies the ticker-

tape. Once again she is forced to shake her head sadly.

BACK TO SHOP'S PRICE DISPLAY

The old $1.59 is suddenly covered as the hand ENTERS FRAME

to slap on a sticker: $1.49. A beat. The hand ENTERS FRAME

to slap on a new sticker: $1.29. Then in rapid-fire

succession: $0.99. $0.79. $0.49. Two for $0.25. Free with

any purchase.

ALLEY BEHIND SHOP

where garbage and garbage cans sit waiting for collection:

Hands appear at the back door of a shop hurling a clutch of

hoops towards the trash heap. One errant hoop rolls towards

the mouth of the alley.

The mouth of the alley. The escaped hula hoop emerges and

starts rolling down the street.

HULA HOOP

It rolls across the street. CARS VIOLENTLY BRAKE to avoid

it.

It rounds a corner and rolls up to a little boy, rolls in a

circle around him, and finally wobbles to the pavement.

The little boy looks at it, steps inside it, raises it to

his hips and starts hula hooping. Somewhere a BELL is RINGING.

INT. NEARBY SCHOOLHOUSE

where the BELL is RINGING, the front doors fly open and

hundreds of schoolchildren run out, screaming, heading home,

but all in a dense pack.

The screaming pack of schoolchildren round a corner and --

stop short, their screams abruptly halting.

They are staring, fascinated, at the hula-hooping youngster.

The children are dumbfounded. It is a moment the likes of

which they have never dreamed.

SCREAMING PACK

once again running, maniacal, possessed. We don't know where

they are running, but we can guess.

STORE

Jam-packed with screaming children, grabbing hula hoops off

the shelves.

BACK TO NORVILLE'S OFFICE

Norville sits slumped behind his desk, his head resting on

the desktop, utterly dejected.

Suddenly the TICKER-TAPE HUMS to life and starts spitting

tape. Amy looks at it with mounting excitement. Finally she

looks breathlessly up:

Norville lifts his head from the desktop. A piece of scrap

paper is sticking to his cheek. Dramatic FANFARE MUSIC STARTS

TO SWELL.

We HOLD ON Norville's expectant face. We HOLD. The MUSIC

BUILDS. We HOLD. We:

NEWSREEL TITLE

We can see the "Tidbits of Time" logo as a solemn-voiced

announcer intones:

ANOTHER ANGLE

Picture dissolves to a pan up the Hudsucker Building.

Cut to candid film of Norville getting out of a car, noticing

the camera, grinning and waving as he walks, and taking a

pratfall.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A television sits against a neutral b.g. A hula hoop rolls

into frame and bumps the TV, pushing it out of frame.

ANOTHER ANGLE

A woman switches off her vacuum cleaner, takes a hula hoop

that is conveniently leaning against a nearby wall, and starts

hula hooping.

ANOTHER ANGLE

In the office, dad, smoking a pipe, is also hula hooping.

ANOTHER ANGLE

In jerky cinema-verite footage, a woman is excitedly sticking

her head in Norville's door.

Swish over to Norville, agog, who picks up his phone and,

voice breaking:

A half-wipe leaves a split screen with half of the screen

remaining Norville, the other half becoming a still of Ike

standing in a tank turret, pointing commandingly.

Under the photo: VOICE OF GENERAL DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER.

Facing a battery of REPORTERS at a news conference.

Norville is holding one hand up to shield his eyes from the

unaccustomed light. Amy stands next to him, beaming.

He is surprised by a burst of laughter.

Flash bulb explosion effects a...

NEWSREEL

A scientist with a Van Dyke beard, wearing a laboratory smock,

is facing the camera. Behind him we see other scientists

studying a hoop that has been hooked up to a gyroscopic-

looking device that analyzes its various movements and

properties.

A title supered over the Scientist's chest identifies him as

Professor Erwin Schweide.

INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE

The mean laugh. Norville, behind his desk in LONG SHOT,

laughing, as we begin to TRACK IN. There is something

disconcerting about his laugh -- it is harder, more

businesslike, colder than the dopey laugh that accompanied

his elevation to the presidency. Or perhaps it is only our

imagination, for while still some distance away from him:

Flash bulb explosion effects a...

NEWS CONFERENCE

Newsmen follow Norville as he walks through the lobby of the

Hudsucker Building.

This TIRED old joke brings some polite laughter.

Norville is smiling as he enters the elevator. As its doors

start to close, leaving Amy behind:

A young couple stands before the altar hula hooping.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The mean laugh. Yes, as we draw closer, it seems clear that

his laugh is colder than before.

NORVILLE

Sitting in a barber chair, face lathered up, as Reporters

crowd in.

A burning cigar emerges from the lather around Norville's

face. It waggles as he talks.

He looks to one side.

ZA-ZA. Standing nearby. Every man's dream, in a tarty sort

of way.

The newsmen react.

The barber is periodically pinching Norville's nose to shave

under it; as he alternately pinches and releases, Norville's

voice breaks from nasal to normal and back.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The mean laugh. FURTHER TRACK IN ON Norville ENDS in CLOSE

SHOT, his hands clasped on the desktop in front of him, as

he finishes his hard, square-jawed, man-on-top laugh, gazing

flintily INTO the CAMERA.

WEEPING EXECUTIVE

The PULL BACK FROM a blubbering executive REVEALS that we

are at a Board meeting. All of the Board members sit around

the table except for Mussburger, who, a towel around his

waist, is receiving a choppity-chop massage on a padded table

from a muscular man in a bulging T-shirt.

Addison snuffles.

He climbs up onto the board table.

He runs down the length of the table and hurls himself toward

the window and:

Thwok!

MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE - ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE

LOOKING IN, as Addison flattens against the f.g. glass, his

face squushing, his outflung hands likewise.

All stare in horror for a long silent beat.

With the sound of a SQUEEGEE being drawn across glass,

Addison, still frozen, slides down the window, hits the floor,

and falls stiffly back like a fallen tree.

Mussburger sits up and sticks a cigar into his mouth.

Sure, sure, the wheel turns, the music plays, and our spin

ain't over yet.

NORVILLE'S OFFICE

A small chamber orchestra, the musicians in tails, sit playing

"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik". Norville, eyes closed, reclines in

his desk chair, one uniformed woman stooping in front of

him, manicuring his nails, another, behind, massaging his

temples. A tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs.

A French sculptor wearing a white smock, a beret, and a goatee

squints at Norville and chisels at a block of marble with a

stone chisel and hammer.

A GOON sits off to one side, hat insolently atop his head,

reading the funny papers.

At length Norville stirs, opens his eyes, sits bolt upright,

batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple-massager.

The musicians' playing dribbles away to silence.

All sit frozen. You could hear a pin drop.

Eyes narrowed, he gazes off into space, squinting for his

idea.

CLOSE ON TAILOR'S KIT

A straight pin is rolling across the top -- it drops off --

EXTREME CLOSE ON FLOOR

Where the PIN -- PING! -- hits.

The musicians resume playing. Everyone else resumes work.

The INTERCOM BUZZES and a female voice announces:

Norville leans forward to hit his intercom.

The door bursts open and Amy storms in.

She shakes a piece of paper at Norville.

This was addressed to the chamber orchestra, whose playing

dribbles off. They look inquisitively at Norville, then rise

to pack up their instruments and sheepishly leave the office.

The Goon looks up from his funnies.

Thwock -- She slaps him.

The bodyguard is on his feet.

Crack -- Amy kicks him hard in the shin.

She strides to the door, leaving Norville rubbing his cheek

and the Goon hopping around on one leg.

FADE IN:

CLOSE SHOT - PICTURE OF AMY

PULL BACK SHOWS it to be her identification in her Hudsucker

personnel file.

A hand brings INTO FRAME another picture of her -- this one

a newspaper clipping. She stands on a podium accepting an

award; standing behind her are middle-aged identical triplets.

The caption says, "Amy Archer of the Manhattan Argus Receives

Pulitzer Prize."

WIDER ANGLE

We are in Mussburger's office. Mussburger is seated at his

desk looking at the file picture and clipping; the sign

letterer/scraper is leaning over his shoulder, having just

put them down.

Aloysious nods wordlessly and turns to leave.

As we TRACK IN ON the picture of Amy, we:

FADE UP TO:

PERFECT WHITE

After a beat, a woman ENTERS against the unblemished white

background, dressed in a flowing white dance robe, trailing

a long, diaphanous veil. She performs a flowingly sensuous

dance moderne; the MUSIC is a sensuous saxophone solo with

lasciviously bending blue notes.

After the woman has been dancing for several beats Norville

enters, dancing after her, pursuing her. He is wearing a

coatless suit, his sleeves rolled up, his thin tie loosened.

The woman dances around him, letting her diaphanous veil

trail sinuously around his body.

We hear an ECHOING voice:

CLOSE SHOT - NORVILLE

Sitting in his desk chair, sheened with sweat, eyes closed,

licking his lips.

CLOSER NOW:

He opens his eyes and looks stuporously about.

Buzz is grinning down at him in his little pillbox elevator

cap.

Norville clears his throat.

He turns an easel to face the desk.

The easel displays an oversized sheet of graph paper.

Onto it has been rendered a top view, which is a perfect

circle, and a side view, which is a vertical line.

Norville gazes stupidly at the circle.

He produces a tall glass of lemonade with a straw sitting in

it.

He holds his head over the glass to drink from the vertical

straw.

He bends the straw to drink from it at the horizontal.

Norville, who has been stewing, finally barks:

He grabs the lemonade glass, looks at it, sneering.

Norville yanks the straw out and crumples it up.

He pauses to belch.

Buzz looks over his shoulder, turns back to Norville.

Buzz's jaw drops. His elastic chin strap snaps under the

pressure.

Buzz sinks to his knees, weeping. He clutches pathetically

at Norville's pants legs.

Buzz stumbles away, still weeping.

As we TRACK IN ON Norville, laughing, there is a low,

unearthly RUMBLE, and his face seems to DISSOLVE INTO:

FLAMES

We PULL BACK FROM the flame of Sid Mussburger's oversized

lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar.

He is sitting alone in the boardroom, but its door swings

open and Norville enters wearing plaid knickers, a little

cap, and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to bulge.

He has a full golf bag over his shoulder.

He is shoving a file towards Norville, who opens it.

We TRACK DOWN the length of the board room table TOWARD

Norville, who stares horrified at the file.

We LOSE Mussburger FROM FRAME as we TIGHTEN FURTHER ON

Norville, Mussburger continuing off:

Norville is slowly dragging the golf cap off his head.

Norville stares, perfectly still.

Norville's IMAGE TURNS TO:

BLACK-AND-WHITE IMAGE OF NORVILLE

We PULL BACK to show that it is on the front page of the

Manhattan Argus.

The headline, in screaming nine-point type:

FAKE!

Next to the picture of Norville is the subhead: Idea Man a

Fraud.

Next to the sub-subhead is a picture of Buzz in his elevator-

operator's pillbox hat: Stole Hoop Idea from Genius Elevator

Jockey Clarence "Buzz" Gunderson.

She is near tears.

She turns to Smitty --

-- and swings -- but he catches her before contact, holds

her by the wrist, and sneers:

Amy swings her free arm to -- thwack -- blindside his other

cheek.

NORVILLE

In flickering black-and-white, he is lying on a couch that

has been brought into his office, gazing listlessly at a

bend straw, being interviewed by someone O.S. The footage is

rough, taking a moment to find focus; the sound is TINNY.

BOARD MEMBER

Sitting in a darkened board room, gazing off at a screen

that sends flickering light onto his face.

BACK TO SCREEN

ANOTHER ANGLE

A shadow is thrown across the screen as a figure steps into

the beam. He throws the sharp silhouette of a strict Freudian

ANALYST: Van Dyke beard, pince-nez with chain trailing down

to his vest, one thumb hooked into the vest, the other hand

holding a cigar wreathing smoke, which he waves for emphasis.

The image on screen cuts to four inkblots. The Analyst sweeps

in a pointer and thwoks each image as he comments on it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The image onscreen cuts to a close shot of Norville on the

couch, mouth listlessly agape.

Image cuts to a sine wave on a graph, the top of which is

labeled "Euphoria," the bottom of which is labeled "Despair,"

and a reference line through the middle labeled "Normal."

There is an X on the declining side of the wave, near but

not yet at the bottom, which is labeled "Patient."

MUSSBURGER

Casually puffing on a cigar.

He interrogatively twirls a finger 'round his temple.

The board murmurs.

As he scores each point it is illustrated on the screen behind

him: A patient is forced into a straitjacket by two brawny,

unshaven attendants; electricity arcs between two leads on a

wire cap being wielded by a technician; and lastly, a steel-

barred door is slammed shut behind a stooped and broken

patient who is led, shuffling, away.

Here the FILM runs out, CHATTERING, and the screen goes white.

The projector is shut off and the lights go on.

The board politely applauds.

INT. BAR - CLOSE ON BARMAN

He has a Vandyke beard and wears a cut-off sweatshirt and

dungarees and dark glasses, and has the phone wedged into

his shoulder as he tears open a large cardboard box.

He hangs up and we HINGE WITH him to bring the length of the

bar into view. Norville dishevelled, is on the other side

bellowing.

The barman is taking rolled-up blow-beepers out of the

cardboard box and loading them into tumblers to set along

the bar.

Suddenly enraged:

He starts awkwardly peeling off his suit coat.

He looks stupidly about, the shoulders of his coat down around

his elbows. He sees Amy rushing up.

Norville's attention has already left her. He looks for the

missing bartender.

She starts pumping her arms, slowly chanting.

She steps back off the stool. Norville watches her dully,

his head swaying.

She looks hopefully for some effect, but after staring at

her for a slack-jawed beat Norville can only bring out:

He lurches off his stool toward the door. Watching him,

despair fights with confusion on Amy's face.

She realizes that, though shattered, he is still the simple

innocent she loved --

-- and bursts into tears.

Two loud REVELERS reel INTO FRAME, one of them uncurling a

blow-beeper at the weeping Amy.

EXT. ANNE'S

As Norville exits. It is night, snowing.

We PAN WITH Norville OFF the bar facade and, ENDING the PAN

in the f.g.:

NEWSPAPER

WIPES UP INTO FRAME. Next to a picture of Norville is the

headline "MUNCIE MENTAL CASE." The subhead: "Hud Chief to

Tend Daisies." Sub-subhead: "Headshrinker Calls Him Walking

Time Bomb."

Norville's hand ENTERS FRAME to push the newspaper away and

leave us looking up the empty street. Norville's back ENTERS

as he stumbles off alone up the street, pulling up his coat

collar as he recedes, the NEWSIE's VOICE continuing:

CLOSE ON NORVILLE

trudging. VOICES WELL UP, ECHOING. A face looms with each

voice, hellishly lit, superimposed over the walking Norville:

This last voice and supered face is Mussburger's.

Norville DISSOLVES away to leave us ON Sidney in the:

INT. BOARDROOM

Hellishly bottom-lit board members sit around the table,

conical New Year's hats on their heads. Mussburger, the only

one not wearing a cap, waves his cigar as he continues to

talk:

The board murmurs appreciatively.

Louder murmuring. One board member leers, a trace of spittle

at the corner of his mouth.

With an unnatural rumble he straightens his papers and we...

HIGH NIGHTMARISH DUTCH ANGLE

of the assembled around the table.

NORVILLE

Norville trudges on, faster, sweatier.

People come and go, laughing, talking, blowing noisemakers,

making merry.

Thoomp!! Norville has run into someone. He looks up, dazed.

It is Buzz, the elevator boy, dressed in an ill-fitting tuxedo

and a conical party hat. Za-Za is on his arm, towering over

him, leering at Norville.

Norville is stunned.

Boffo!

Buzz swings and Norville hits the snow hard.

Norville groggily raises his head.

Norville looks dopily up at the people in furs and party

hats starting to gather.

We hear SIRENS.

Norville staggers to his feet. The crowd cringes.

Norville bursts through the crowd, running.

Buzz starts giving chase, followed by the braver souls,

followed by the entire mob.

NORVILLE

runs, gasping, turning a corner.

Behind Norville, the crowd rounds the corner, led by Buzz.

A VAN is SCREECHING to a halt and out jump two burly unshaven

men in white, one of them holding open a straitjacket, the

other carrying a large butterfly net. They join in the chase.

Norville turns down an alley. A DRUNK drooping off a lamppost

gaily waves a bottle at him.

The crowd is running past the mouth of the alley, missing

the turn-off.

LIMESTONE FLOOR

Norville, gasping, crashes down INTO FRAME, his hands breaking

his fall against the limestone. The CAMERA SPINS NINETY

DEGREES to reveal that it is not floor but wall he has run

into and is now leaning against. Norville looks up, sweating,

gasping.

HIS POV

The massive Hudsucker Building looms dizzily up towards the

stars, capped by the huge Hudsucker Clock.

HUDSUCKER LOBBY

Norville staggers in. A gust of icy air that comes in with

him flaps a dropcloth off a huge shape that dominates the

lobby:

It is the heroic statue of Norville that we earlier saw him

posing for.

Norville reels over to it, stares dumbly.

STATUE

Mutely -- mockingly -- dignified.

NORVILLE

He staggers off to the elevators.

MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE

We are TRACKING ACROSS the office TOWARD Mussburger, his

feet up on his desk, laughing demonically, smoking his cigar.

CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS swing

on his desk; THRUMMMMM -- the SWEEP SECOND HAND of the clock,

illuminated now, casts a moving shadow that rolls across the

floor. Evil prevails.

A piece of paper and a pencil lie on his desk; as we APPROACH

WE PAN DOWN and SWING AROUND to read it, LOSING Mussburger

but still hearing his LAUGHTER.

MOVING IN ON THE PAPER:

Musssucker Industries. Hudberger Industries. Sidsucker

Industries. This last alternative has been circled in red.

Below it has been scribbled:

Sidney J. Mussburger, President.

Evil LAUGHTER. Sweeping shadows.

NORVILLE'S OFFICE DOOR

We are TRACKING IN TOWARD the back of Aloysius, the sign

painter, who is stooped in front of the door. He looks back

over his shoulder, leering PAST the CAMERA, to reveal his

work: Under PRESIDENT Norville's name has been scraped away,

and painted in is SIDNEY J. MUSSBUR...

NORVILLE

He pushes past the sign painter.

INT. OFFICE

Dark and empty. Norville is peeling off his coat as he

staggers over to the closet.

We can hear DISTANT REVELRY and the STRAINS of "AULD LANG

SYNE."

Norville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet

and is putting it on: HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future Is Now.

Norville looks at the door.

THROUGH the glass we see the tail of the last R of

"Mussburger" being painted into place.

Norville throws open the window.

WIND WHISTLES.

He climbs out.

LEDGE

Norville, back against the wall, looks cautiously down.

We hear DISTANT CHANTING:

HIS POV

A sickening drop. Receding snowflakes. On the street far,

far below, a lone car's headlights cut through the falling

snow.

WIDER ON NORVILLE

We are FLOATING IN; it is the SHOT with which the movie began.

The sweep second hand of the Hudsucker Clock is approaching

the 12 of midnight, the New Year. In sync with the clock the

CHANTING continues:

We have COME IN CLOSE ON Norville. A lone tear runs down his

cheek.

BONG! The toll is right at Norville's ear. Startled, he

reaches up to press hands against his ears. Distantly:

BONG!!

He can't stand it. Whimpering, hands to his ears, he edges

his way back toward the window.

HIS POV

The open window at a steep angle. Someone inside slides it

shut.

BACK TO SCENE

Norville waves.

BONG!!

His gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance -- he

trips -- falls -- catches the ledge --

He is hanging onto the icy ledge by his fingertips. His feet

dangle away. Snow falls.

HIS POV

Looking STEEPLY UP.

CLOCK

Its second hand is making its descent.

NORVILLE

Falling.

MUSSBURGER

Laughing.

SECOND HAND

Descending.

NORVILLE

Falling, turning lazily in the air -- and suddenly, with a

great moaning sound -- he stops, suspended in mid-air, head

down, feet in the air.

It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that

the title of the film was supered over.

He waves his arms, to no effect, looks around.

PEOPLE IN STREET

Frozen in attitudes of laughter, celebration. Snow sifts

silently down around their motionless bodies.

MUSSBURGER

In his office, frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his

face.

HIS PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS

Frozen, one ball swung out but suspended, hanging at the

apex of its arc. Outside the great arched window, snow falls.

NORVILLE

He alone can move, but doesn't fall. He looks awkwardly about,

his body in a dive-bomber attitude, canted steeply down.

EXT. HUDSUCKER CLOCK

Its sweep second hand is arrested on its downward sweep.

WHINING NOISES emanate from within.

CLOSE SHOT - GREAT GEAR

The broom handle has been jammed between two cogs, stopping

them. We PULL BACK ALONG the handle to reveal Moses, who has

thrust it there, and who now TURNS back over his shoulder to

address the CAMERA.

NORVILLE

Twisting back to look up over his shoulder; there is a DISTANT --

very distant -- SINGING.

HIS POV

Looking up the length of the Hudsucker Building. Someone or

something wrapped in white is flying toward us, coming down

from the stars.

We can make out a male voice, accompanied by STRUMMING:

NORVILLE

He gapes.

ANGEL

-- For it is an Angel, arrives. He is a balding man, wearing

rimless glasses, in a white robe, large feathery wings

sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes

to rest, in midair. He puts aside the harp he has been

strumming on a nearby windowsill.

Presenting himself, he spreads his arms and stamps his forward

foot, forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot to

stamp. He lurches forward, momentarily losing his balance.

He rights himself. The halo spinning lazily over his head

has been jarred askew. With a flick of his forefinger he

rights it.

He blows a dismissive raspberry.

He pats at his robe, produces a white cigar.

He casually flicks his thumb out of his fist, lighting it.

He lights the cigar off his thumb, takes a puff.

Pain reminds him that he has forgotten to extinguish his

flaming thumb, which he now waves frantically about.

Norville reaches in and -- pulls out the wrinkled Blue Letter.

He tears open the envelope, reads:

As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his fingernails,

then pats down a yawn.

Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering. He looks up.

Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief.

He saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently

quavers in a voice strangled with emotion:

He waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles.

Norville looks down the page.

He roars with laughter.

He merrily wipes his eyes.

Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod.

Pleased with himself:

Hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the

stars.

MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE

Mussburger still sits frozen in his chair. Outside the great

arched window Hudsucker rises, through the falling snow, on

his way back to the heavens.

We hear a great WRENCHING SOUND from the GEAR ROOM next door.

GEAR ROOM

Moses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear.

With a LOW MOAN the CLOCKWORKS start to shudder and turn --

SWEEP SECOND HAND

Lurching forward --

PERPETUAL MOTION BALL

Swinging down --

EXT. PAVEMENT

As Norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face

with one last mighty BONG of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.

BOOM DOWN

FROM a tavern sign that says ANN'S 440, DOWN TO the front

door, which Norville is entering.

INT. ANN'S

Sitting halfway down the bar is Amy, staring morosely into a

coffee cup. AT the CUT we are TRACKING BACK, PULLING AWAY

FROM her.

Norville enters, comes up next to her and makes the Go Eagles

sign, hooking his thumbs in front of his nose and spreading

his fingers.

Two familiar voices narrate the scene, sounding a little

tipsy:

Amy looks at Norville, startled. After a moment she

reciprocates the sign.

Norville and Amy embrace.

Our PULL BACK ENDS LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the bar, TOWARDS

Norville and Amy, now in WIDE SHOT. Resting on the bar in

the extreme f.g. are two champagne glasses, half-full of

fizzing champagne.

Norville and Amy kiss.

We hear LABORED, RASPY BREATHING.

In a quavering voice:

Lou also is beginning to sound choked up:

Almost weeping as Norville and Amy continue their embrace:

A BARTENDER ENTERS to BLOCK our VIEW of Norville and Amy.

He is youngish, with a beat goatee, wearing dungarees and a

sweatshirt with cut-off sleeves. He looks to either side at

Benny and Lou.

REVERSE ANGLE

We see Benny and Lou are sitting side by side at the bar.

Lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long

flowing robe; he holds a fake scythe. On the bar next to him

sits a large hourglass.

Benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper, a baby

bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly

that says "1959."

He chucks himself in the heart, cocks his head and sucks in

air, then blows it back out.

BLUE LETTER

Lying on the boardroom table. As a hand enters to lay a

wristwatch on the table next to it, we hear the voice of

Moses, the old maintenance man.

The hand reenters to lay down a wallet, and then to deposit

a burning cigar in an ashtray.

We TILT UP to show that Mussburger is walking toward the

boardroom window. Board members silently remonstrate with

him as he tries to wrench it open.

Doctor Bromfenbrenner stands to one side watching, brow

furrowed, a pencil pressed to his lips.

We...

BARRED DOOR

being slammed behind Sidney who, straight-jacketed, is puffing

on a cigar as he is led away.

BOARDROOM

Again. Norville is eagerly pointing at a design he has up on

an easel: Under the heading BRAND NEW is a large circle. The

side view is a flat line.

The board members look at the design, puzzled.

Norville takes a drop cloth off of a piece of plastic on a

pedestal. He has the board's complete attention.

He picks up the plastic disc and as he sails it we...

OUTSIDE

As it floats out the boardroom window.

We BOOM UP, AWAY FROM the boardroom, to the great Hudsucker

Clock.

We FADE OUT on the clock as Moses' LAUGHTER grows distant

and END MUSIC SWELLS.
