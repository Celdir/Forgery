AIRPLANE PILOT (O.S.)

(panicky; through crackly

Los Angeles Tower, this is

Transworld two-two Heavy, we are

going down! Repeat... Engines two

and three are... L.A. Tower this is

MaydayI Mayday!

TOWER (O.S.)

(through crackly radio)

2-2 Heavy, Pull upt Pull up!

The RADIO NOISE is drowned out by the A CAPELLA, SOPRANO

VOICE of a young Indian boy as he sings a melodic Hindi

prayer.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN --- NIGHT

THE WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE:

SLOW MOTION: The plane is going down fasts Everyone panics

and screams in SLOW MOTION as the oxygen masks away like

plastic pendulums. The SOPRANO VOICE continues the prayer.

ANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE), 25, is the only passenger who

remains unfazed. Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery

reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated

next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even

as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and

the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits

peacefully; unaffected.

He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows

directly on him. He looks up to

THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN

it BINGS as the light flashes on and off. The BINGING

continues more and more frequently; at first in rhythm with

the prayer and then it dissolves into the RING of an

ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE.

INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

Whiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture

window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins

above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls

and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in

which he sleeps.

HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams

like they're chasing each other in a game of tag.

THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine. Large's eyes

stop moving.

VOICE ON MACHINE (0.S.)

Andrew... This is your father.

LARGE'S EYES slowly float open.

Hi, hello, it's uh. Look uh, you

don't call me back so I don't know

how to do this. If I can't... if

you're not gonna return my calls

then there's no way for us to

communicate. So uh...

'(starts to cry)

Look, I don't know how to do . this,

but you're gonna need to come home

now. Last night uh... Your mother

died last night, Andrew. She uhh...

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But she

uh... she drowned... last night she

drowned in the bath...

BEEP. The machine cuts the voice off.

LARGE'S EYES processing.

They elide slowly left, then back right as if scanning in

data. He blinks. He blinks again slowly. His eyelids float

closed. He falls back to sleep.

FADE TO BLACK-'

The RUSH OF WATER from the bathroom sink.

INT. BATHROOM -- MORNING

Large appears to stare directly at us. He's dazed. His body

is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle

of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the

mirror he's been staring into.

His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two

dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately

line the shelves of his medicine cabinet.

He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself.

MUSIC CUB., ("DON'T PANIC" BY COLDPLAY)

EXT. CENTURY CITY PAVILION -- LATER

Large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break.

He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries

to find an address while checking a piece of paper.

He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL-

stairs.

After a moment he looks to his right through a window into a

gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him.

Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere.

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the

down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way

down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the

next level. His expression never changes.

INT. CASTING OFFICE -- DAY

A casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and

manilla envelopes while the PHONE RINGS constantly. Large

sits next to another actor that looks exactly like him;

they're even dressed alike.

Casting, please hold. casting,

please hold.

WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL: they are sitting beneath an eight

foot photograph of "Urkel" wagging his finger at the camera.

A slow 360 degree pan around the room reveals ten other

actors identical to Large aggressively rehearsing their lines

to themselves.

The ACTOR seated next to Large leans over to him.

We're whores.

Large looks at him.

that I say, "If you would do

this... that you would do ' this...

you're a whore." 'But it pays the

bills," you say; startin' to get a

little pissed. And to that I say:

"how do whores, how do you think a

hooker justifies what she does to

her non-hooker friends?"

It pays the bills.

"Codey, an extreme, special-ope

hacker with an edge.' What the fuck

is an "edge"? Can you explain

"edge" to me? Is it just messy

hair?

Hey, wait. Aren't you the guy who

booked the retarded quarterback?

An overweight casting assistant enters.

Lukas Fox?

Yeah, hey Sandy.

Leslie.

(under his breath)

Fuck.

come on in.

(to the room)

Hey guys, we're only doing the

first scene okay; the "I'll cut

you!" scene. Thanks.

Good talking with you, bro.

Peace.

We hold on Large as he swings his gaze to the actor on his

other side aggressively running his lines to the air.

INT. LARGE' S CAR -- DAY

Hazy and claustrophobic in stopped traffic on the 405

freeway. Large stares absently out the window as BLARING

SIRENS. compete with the obnoxious ramblings of L.A. TALK

RADIO.

Large suddenly squints his eyes and clutches his neck in

pain.

EXT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Large pulls his car into a parking spot, throws "The Club" on

his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the

restaurant. But something catches his eye on the side of his

car.

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: a gasoline pump nozzle

sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped

off at the end. He stares at it, trying to remember the last

time he bought gas. He looks both ways and covertly pulls the

nozzle from his tank.

He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws

the nozzle in an open dumpater.

INT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Large flings open the door and enters a long, dark corridor

lined with stacked chairs. He passes a WAITER in a black

TUNIC wearing eye make-up to make him look Asian.

Dick head. You've got thirty-four

and twenty-five seated and Taylor

booked a pilot so he quit. You

picked a bad night to be late.

Large glides through the chaotic environment unfazed by any

of the stress. He rounds a corner to a time card machine and

swipes his card. The machine BEEPS and displays the word,

"LATE" in red. He crosses to a locker and quickly changes

into a black tunic and pants.

He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over

thirty people in white: chopping, frying, sauteing, YELLING.

The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and BARKS ORDERS down the

line. Large is met by a FRENCH WOMAN MANAGER. She walks with

him as he weaves his way through the kitchen.

Ten resumes just today. They come

in everyday from Idaho or Florida

or Milwaukee and do you know what

they want even more than a guest

spot on "Everybody Loves Raymond"?

They want your job. This will not

happen again. This will never

happen again. You have two tables.

You are thirty minutes late; if I

ever say this again, your job will

She pulls off the top resume from the bunch she's grasping;

revealing a headshot on the other side.

FRENCH MANAGER (CONT'D)

Todd Slauson from Duluth,

Minnesota.

During all this, Large remains calm and unphased. He takes a

stick of eye make-up from the pocket of the tunic and paints

his eyes to appear Asian. (As do all the white, good-looking,

male waiters.)

He takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of

the tunic and turns it on. He unwinds the ear piece, pulls it

through the back of his jacket, out the neck and into his

ear. Immediately we hear a VIETNAMESE MAN'S VOICE giving

orders over the ear piece.

VIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.)

(accented, but monotone)

Waiter number fifteen, your table

number twenty-three is ready.

Large takes a deep breath and pushes open the door into:

INT. DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

A very fancy Hollywood Vietnamese restaurant filled to

capacity with a Friday evening crowd. The energy is

completely different from the other side of the door. SOFT

ASIAN MUSIC' plays, the room is very dim and lit by

candlelight.

VIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.)

Waiter ten, you forgot the order of

forty-one for table one-o-one. All

waiters, eighty-six tuna special.

Large remains dead-pan as he crosses to a table with six

young, hot Hollywood types.

YOUNG HOLLYWOOD GUY

What the fuck, man? What are you on

break?

Large doesn't respond.

YOUNG HOLLYWOOD GUY (CONT'D)

Don't worry about it; I'm just

messin' with ya. Lemme get three

Kettle Red Bulls arid...

Can I have a Kettle Cosmo with Red

Bull, please. And some bread too. A-

sap.

We don't have bread.

What do you mean you don't have

bread? How could you not have

bread?

We just don't have bread it's...

we're a Vietnamese restaurant.

Well you're not Vietnamese.

No, I'm not.

So?

Well something to chew on --fuck.

Bamboo... whatever.

I'll see what I can find.

He turns and walks off .

VIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.)

Waiter number twelve, flight number

121 with non-stop service to Newark

International will be departing

from gate D-32.

ON LARGE'S FACE CLOSE as he closes his eyes and we:

FADE TO BLACK:

THE BLARE OF A JET LINER TARING OFF dissolves into

INT. AIRPORT BATHROOM -- DAY

THE RUSH OF WATER as Large washes his hands at the last Oink

in a very long row. He grabs his neck while SQUINTING his

eyes closed in pain for a brief second.

A moment later he picks up his bag and heads down the line of

sinks. As he passes each sink, he unknowingly activates their

motion sensors and each faucet SHOOTS a tiny burst of water.

The NASALLY VOICE of a WOMAN SINGING an off key version of

"Once, Twice, Three Times A Lady" with synthesizer

accompaniment.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

A large group of people are gathered around a steel coffin.

Atop the coffin site a framed picture of a tired looking

woman in a wheelchair. This is SARAH LARGEMAN.

We find SYLVIA LARGEMAN, the source of the music. CLOSE ON

HER FACE as the assorted palette of colored make-up on her

cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the

tip of her chin and drips like a leaky faucet onto:

HER LYRICS SHEET as a rainbow of tears splatter the words

"ONCE and "TWICE".

The song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of Hebrew

prayers. Large squints through the mourners to see his father

GIDEON LARGEMAN shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket.

Behind him stands CYNTHIA DILLARD, 25, a beautiful young

Black woman.

HIS FOCUS RACKS TO REVEAL two young men seated on a rusty

tractor smoking cigarettes about thirty yards behind the

ceremony.

WE JUMP CUT TO after the ceremony as Large weaves through the

crowd and approaches the two men. We see now they are HA-RKs

26, good looking in a dirty way. And DAVE, 26. They are quite

filthy, but each sports expensive jewelry and black

yarmulkes.

They look up as Large approaches.

T'sup.

Holy shit!

Largeman, what the hell are you

doin' here?

Oh... uh that's my mom.

Fuck.

Puck. Sorry.

Well... welcome home-

Thanks. Yeah. How you guys doin'?

Same.

Same.

Nice.

Silence.

Where the fuck you been, man?

You're like still acting and shit,

right?

Yeah.

In LA right?

Yeah.

That's cool. I hear that place is

pretty tucked up, man. I got a

cousin who's a writer out there. He

says that place is mad crazy. Coke

everywhere, parties, horny-ass

bitches...

Who?

What?

Which cousin?

Terry.

Terry's in LA? I thought he was

gettin' his GED down in Newark.

No bitch, he's in LA now. He's a

writer. He's writin' a movie about

snowboarders or some shit, X don't

know. I should introduce you to him

Largeman, maybe you guys could do

something together.

Great.

So what are you doin' tonight, man?

Nothing... no plans. I'm just here

for a couple days... nothing.

You should come out with us, we're

gonna head over to the Gleason's

house. He's having some huge

fuckin' party tonight or something.

Supposedly.

Supposedly.

Really?

Yeah, he lives up on the hill.

We're probably gonna head over

there right after we bury your mom.

Well I gotta shower.

Same.

Okay, well... You know I'll have to

see with all this... this.

All right. Well, welcome back.

Peace.

Large heads back to his car. The crowd has dispersed.

INT. LARGEMAN HOUSE: LIVING ROOM - DAY

in it, Large (as a young boy), Sarah (not yet in a

wheelchair) and Gideon Largeman huddle together with a Black

woman and her young daughter (Cynthia) against a white

background. They all wear white t--shirts, blue jeans and no

socks. Everyone but Sarah smiles widely into the lens.

"Shiva" is in full swing as forty or so older suburban Jewish

New Jersey'ites of every shape and size mingle over small

food and small talk. The camera moves past several

A heavy woman with gobs of make-up and lots of gold.

.Well you had to call her; she

never called anyone.

A woman in a white tennis outfit talking to a group.

This was a woman who never smiled.

An older man in glasses with cream cheese all over his lips.

Somebody ate all the lox.

THE CAMERA MOVES TO: Two very Jewish older ladies

simultaneously telling the same story to a group of friends.

The new thing is "Talk to the

hand."

That's what they're doing.

But you got a hold it out like

this.

Like you're saying...

"I don't have the time for you."

"So talk to my hand."

"He's the only one with time...

Like you're saying...

"I don't have the time for you."

"So talk to my hand."

"Time for the nonsense that you're

giving me.

Large site on a couch in the den next to his Aunt Sylvia, the

singer from the funeral. Some young children play on the rug

in front of them. Large stares off into space as she pets one

of the children's heads and looks to Large for conversation.

Did you know your mother redid the

hallway bathroom?

Large looks over, realizing she's talking to him.

What? Sorry. Who?

Since I met her she never showed an

interest in anything. Then all of a

sudden a month ago she wakes up and

decides to redecorate a bathroom. I

helped her.

That's great.

(trying his best)

I'll bet it was... fun.

Well I sew. I made you something.

Me? Thank you. Did you... sew it?

It's a shirt.

Great.

I made short sleeves... you know,

for LA.

Great. I'll wear it.

Will you try it on nowt

Now?

Well just in case I have to fix it

before you leave again and we don't

see you for another nine years, I

want to make sure it fits.

oh. okay.

You're gonna love the material. I

used the leftovers from your

Mother's design. Gorgeous.

INT. HALLWAY BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Large flips the light on to reveal the entire bathroom is

done in the same floral pattern; everything: wallpaper,

towels, curtains. He looks down at the shirt; it's the same

pattern.

He slides his sweater off to reveal his pale, thin chest. He

stares at himself in the mirror for a moment. He tilts his

head to the right and stares at his body.

He pulls the shirt on and buttons up the front. As he does

his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the

room. He looks at himself in the mirror; it looks like his

head and forearms are floating in mid-air.

Large almost smiles as he makes his forearms dance around in

mid-air.

TNT. GIDEON'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

GIDEON LARGENAN sits alone at his desk. Large enters.

Hi.

How you doin'?

"Well besides that tire. Lincoln,

how was the show?"

You know I'm not really sure what

to say here, Dad, so I'm sorry.

Mmnn.

Did you see Cynthia?

From afar at the cemetery.

She's on call tonight; she

volunteers as an EMT for the Rescue

Squad. She's doing so well in med

school.

Yeah, she's amazing. I'm really

happy that everything's working out

so well for her. She deserves that.

I have very fond memories of the

two of you running around here when

you were little kids like brother

and sister.

Silence.

So how are you?

I'm okay.

I've been getting these pretty bad

headaches lately. It feels like a

quick little lightning storm in my

brain and then it's gone. I was

thinking maybe you could set me up

to get it checked out while I'm

here.

Go see Dr. Cohen first thing

tomorrow morning. Re's a

neurologist in my building. I'll

call him and he'll fit you in. I'm

sure it's nothing to worry about.

Silence. Large nods.

House looks great.

Oh? That's nice. We've been...

doing a lot of work on it.

Really?

Actually, no. I don't know why I

just said that. We haven't done

anything to it.

We cleaned it for this; for this

whole thing. Janice has been

cleaning.

The bathroom in the hall. I noticed

someone redid that.

Yeah. That's new. Did you eat? You

should eat. Aunt Sylvia put this

whole thing together out there. I

think there's enough food out there

for... everybody. I mean, more.than

everybody... there's a lot of food

out there.

okay. I think I'll go have some..

There's dessert too.

Great. Okay.

Cake or something.

Great.

Large starts to leave.

I'm glad you're here.

Large stops in the doorway.

Saying goodbye is important. I'm

glad you could... fit it in.

They nod at each other. Large walks out.

INT. LARGE 'S BEDROOM -- DAY

A tattered, vintage American Flag site framed above the bed.

Large eases past all the shelves; trinkets, nothing seems to

mean anything and then

Several people are seated amongst dozens of presents

laughing. A. seven year old Large stands with his arm around

a seven year old Cynthia. They both wear enormous "chicken-

foot" slippers and smile from ear to ear.

Large's POV: zooms into the face of the only person in the

photo not smiling. This is Sarah Largeman. She stands; not

yet requiring a wheelchair.

He crosses to the bed and sits down. The surface sends waves

,towards the pillows throwing them off the bed, revealing it's

A LOUD RING from a PHONE on the bedside table which appears

to be made out of Legos. He answers it.

Hello?... Hey. No... Yes.

INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT

Large pulls away a tarp to reveal a classic world War II Army

motorcycle with a sidecar. The corner of hie mouth raises and

holds the idea of a smile.

MUSIC CUE: "REMY ZERO"

EXT. STREETS NIGHT

Large flies through the suburban sprawl without a helmet. THE

MUSIC BLASTS.

The wind throws his hair back as Large whips through the back

roads. He's going really fast. He closes his eyes, flying by

a COP CAR doing eighty before he opens them again. LIGHTS

FLASH behind him as he pulls over.

Fuck.

The cop car stops behind him and blares him with the search

light.

Hands on your head, please!

What?

I said PUT YOUR MOTRERFUCKING HANDS

ON YOUR FUCKING HEAD PLEASE!21

Large does it. All we can see is a silhouette of a figure

standing amidst the blaring lights and swirling blue and red

colors.

Eighty-two in a twenty-five. Are

you gonna tell me your late or just

tired?

I didn't...

Shut the fuck up.

You could have killed some little

kid or a baby deer.

He saunters closer.

skinny kid, maybe 23, with a baby face!

Largeman?

Large squints?

Kenny?

Holy shit: How you doin' man?

Great!

Your mom just died.

I know.

I mean that's why you're home.

Yeah... yup.

You're a cop, Kenny?!

I know, I know.

Why, Kenny?

I don't know; I couldn't think of

anything better to do. And it's

really cool though, man. People

really listen to you. They have to.

And check this shit out.

He pulls his gun out of his holster to show Large.

That's the safety. Plus the

benefits; if I get shot I'm rich.

Yeah but, I mean... Kenny, the last

time I saw you, you were blowing

coke lines off the top of a urinal.

I had to grow up now, man, I wasn't

makin' shit at the fish market. No

one knew who I was. I couldn't get

laid. This is a much better

situation for me. Speakin' of

which, how did I do?

What do you mean?

I mean you know... how did I do?

You mean like... as a... cop?

Yeah.

I don't know. I mean I thought, you

were a dick... so I guess that's

good.

Ah fuck, man. I hear you're like

some huge movie star; you played

some big football player or

something. I didn't nee it.

Yeah.

Fuckin' DeNiro and shit.

What?

fie ' s awe some .

Yeah.

Deer Hunter. We should talk, man; I

have some good ideas for movies,

and you could like play me and

shit. "Stories From the Force-"

Yeah, definitely.

They stand there; nodding.

So what are you doin' tonight?

That depends, are you arresting me?

Kenny laughs.

Shut the fuck upf Course not.

But you got to put your helmet on,

man; leading cause of death on the

highway for males in our age

bracket.

Okay.

Wanna see my kid.

He shows Large a picture in his wallet.

You got a kid, too? Wow.

Everybody's got kids now, man;

they're great. It's like your own

"Mini-Me"; way better than my cats,

Cute. Gold teeth?

Wellthiswas Halloween. He was

"OL'DirtyBastard." Yeah, already

likesraplike his dad. So what

d'yousayyou were doin' tonight?

I think I'm gonna meet Mark and

Dave over at some party.

The Gleasons?

Yeah, I think.

can you believe that kids havin' a

party at that house? His brother

hung himself like two weeks ago in

his bedroom.

Really?

Cut him down myself. Seth. Did you

know him?

I don't think so.

He tried like three times. Finally

got what he wanted.

Anyway... So okay, you get going,

I'll see you over there in a bit.

Oh, you get off soon?

No. But we'll be by to bust it up

by two. if it's crowded we might

get to wear riot gear.

Oh, that would be great... to see

that. So I guess I'll see you then.

Great seeing you, man.

Yeah. You too.

Benny gets in his car and pulls up alongside Large. He picks

up the CB and the PA CRACKLES on:

Pull over, the vehicle!

Kenny nods his head up and down to Large like "Isn't this

cool?" Large waves goodbye. Kenny floors the cop car and

BLARES the SIREN with LIGHTS FLASHING as be SCREECHES away.

INT.GLEASON HOUSE - NIGHT

Mostof thepeople are 18 to 21.

TNT.GLEASON KITCHEN --- NIGHT

A bunch of people are gathered around Mark as he tells a

drunken story. The group laughs.

holy chit look at this guy!

Everyone looks to Large at the end of the line.

Get the fuck up here, bitch! This

guy does not wait for a beer! This

is a movie star! This is Jersey's

DeNiro and shit.

Mark sloppily hugs Large. Others slap him five as Large

awkwardly navigates between variations of hugs and

handshakes.

What are you doin home?

A beat as Large realizes he has to answer that question.

I uh...

Press junket.

That's phat yo. Fuck yeah, Serpico

and Shit...

The crowd quickly moves onto other things.

(in a whisper)

You like that? That's

improvisation, bitch. You can use

it.

INT. GLEASON HALLWAY - CONTINUOS

They walk through the crowd as Mark recruits cute girls to

join them upstairs. They walk up the stairs past family

pictures and school photos made crooked by drunken backs.

Mark points to a photo of an awkward looking young man.

You see this?

in that him?

That was him. Dug the hole myself.

Did you know him?

Nah. Ugly motherfucker though, huh?

It pains Large to even try to respond to that.

You want to see the most fucked up

thing?

They arrive at the landing outside a door with a "New Jersey

Devils" poster on it.

MARK (CONT`D)

This is the tucked up thing.

Be swings the door to the bedroom open revealing the dark

bedroom of your average teenage boy. A teenage couple

drunkenly makes out on the bed. The mattress has no sheets.

Check that out.

Mark points to a hole in the ceiling where a ceiling fan has

been ripped out. Wires dangle. The fan lies next to the bed.

GUY HOOKING UP

Hey, get the fuck outta herei

Shut the fuck up. Who is that,

O'Malley? I'll beat your aael

GIRL HOOKING UP

Is that Andrew Largeman?

(squinting to see)

Yeah, who's that?

GIRL HOOKING UP

Hey, it's Karen. Karen Dullia?

Oh, hey.

GIRL HOOKING UP

You don't remember me? You

fingered me at the Dinner Dance.

oh hey, what's up.

GIRL HOOKING UP

Nothing. I saw you on TV.

GUY HOOKING Up

okay, can you please get the fuck

out now.

GIRL HOOKING UP

Mark pulls the door closed.

I can't tell what's more

disgusting; those two hooking up in

that room, or those two hooking up.

INT. GOLF ROOM __ CONTINUOUS

Everything in the room is golf. it is one man's wood paneled

shrine to the sport of golf: golf carpet, posters,

autographs, etc. A group of people sit around the couch

drinking beer,. passing joints. Smoky, dark.

Large notices JESSE, a wiry 25 year old in thick glasses.

Hey, what's going on, man?

bargeman.

They hug and pat each other on the back.

I heard you're kicking ass, man.

Yeah. You gotta come by my new

place.

Yeah, definitely.

Sorry... you know... I heard.

Oh, thanks... yeah - thanks.

That's fucked up.

Yeah... So I definitely wanna come

by and check out your new pad. You

gotta tell me what happened.

Basically, "The Man bought my

silent Velcro patent.

What?

Well you knew I was an inventor

right?

No. But I haven't seen you since we

Oh well yeah... I wasn't really an

inventor yet. Anyway I developed

this little item that's just like

Velcro but doesn't make that

annoying Velcro noise.

now much did they buy it for?

A lot.

Wow. So what are you doing now?

Nothing.

They laugh.

Seriously.

Seriously. Absolutely nothing. I've

never been so bored in all my life.

The first month I bought a whole

bunch of shit, but then that got

boring. But I... nothing.

That's so crazy. But I mean like,

are you gonna travel or like what

are you gonna do? Shouldn't you

like help starving kids or

something?

I'm not really motivated to do much

at all. It's kind of funny, I guess

I had kind of planned on my whole

life being about struggling to get

money. But now that I've got more

than I ever dreamed, I'm really not

sure what to do with myself. I

stare at walls a lot.

Can you believe that shit, Large?

This guy has one idea and he's a

trillionaire. I got a thousand

ideas, but I gotta sit around and

wait for all my relatives to die.

They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book.

Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that

the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty

young; 17-19.

As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG

GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the

stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone

has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on.

Here, bro.

He passes Large the golf book.

Oh no thanks, man.

Really? But you're like a movie

star and shit.

No, no thanks.

Well then here. Eat this.

Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY

FACE on it.

Welcome home.

Large takes it in his hand and thinks about it. He looks

around at everyone else in the room eating them; including

the cute girls.

I guess I'll see youguyslater.

He eats the hit. They laugh.

Should we play a game?

other than golf?

They laugh.

No, let's play Spin The Bottle.

The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group.

I'm not playing Spin The Bottle;

how old are we? or more

importantly, how old are they?

Jesse passes Large the joint.

They're all legal. I think.

He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy

voice takes control.

Well we just ate all this fuckin'

ex, what the hell else are we gonna

do?

The girl has a point.

Okay, how 'bout this.

He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to

neck.

First let's finish Daddy's golf

tequila. Then we can use this

bottle.

The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA

FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the

beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv

start.

THE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED-

UP AND SLOW MOTION.

The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES

TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name.

Large!

He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed

directly at him.

Largeman, this is Dana.

Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes

with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room.

Hi.

(snapping out of it)

Oh, who's up?

They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the

couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in

his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She

stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her

knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap.

The MUSIC PLAYS.

Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact.

They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy.

HIS FINGERS CLUTCH HER THIGH

They stop and look at each other. She kisses him on the cheek

and gets up. Everyone reacts and some clap.

This is gonna be a good night.

Everything SPEEDS-UP and SLOWS DOWN. A barrage of images:

people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls

up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off

his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and

Dave hugging, two-figures moving quickly under a blanket.

Kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him

in his helmet.

FASTER : hands gripping each other, a nose on a neck, hands

gripping a waist.

Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the

corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile..

The motion of the room is sped to a blur until finally:

BLACKNESS.

A BLARING LIGHT comes out of the darkness. Morning sun

streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame,

eyes still closed. Across his forehead in thick black marker

the word "BALLS" is written.

His eyes open wide. He has no idea where he is. His eyeballs

swing left, then right. As Large site up

THE CAMERA pulls back to reveal we are

INT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

Large site on the sofa covered in an afghan. White morning

sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to

highlight the duet in the air.

A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open. He has no idea

where he is.

Large's POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a

person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his

Bigfoot sighting.

He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal

box.

Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval

Knight in full regalia. They make eye contact for a second

and Large slams his eyes shut. When he opens them again the

knight is gone.

INT. KITCHEN -- LATER

Large and Mark sit with CAROL, mark's mother and TIN PAYTON,

25. Carol is mid-forties and always looks like she's got a

cold or has just been crying. Tim is dressed as a Medieval

Knight.

Large and mark stare at Tim as he SLURPS down his cereal.

Carol smokes a thin cigarette. Mark is shirtless. No one

addresses the fact that it says "Balls" in black marker On

Large's forehead.

Silence but for the CLANKING of SILVERWARE and TIM'S

SLURPING.

it's good isn't it.

No one responds, so Tim nods to be nice.

i always try to save a couple of

marshmallows for the very end, but

I can never make it.

My mind wanders and I'm left with

flakes and pink milk. And yet each

time I pour a bowl I tell myself

that this time, this is gonna be

the time I'm gonna save at least

one.

So, Tim, how long you been working

at medieval Times?

Three years. But I've only been a

knight for two. You have to pay

your dues. I worked in the stables

and helped in the kitchen.

When I started he was making the

coleslaw. It hasn't been the same

since you got knighted.

I really just stirred it.

Don't be modest. Mr. Modesty won

the joust last night.

Congratulations.

It's not that big a deal, it's

fixed.

What was it that happened to you in

high school? You had a thing, but

I forgot what it was.

He got the shit kicked out of him.

No he didn't.

How do you know? He got the shit

kicked out of him by Tyrell

Freedmen.

I remember that. That was sofucked

up. Why did he do that?

I fucked him up too.

He knocked your teeth out.

He said I bit off him 'cause I got

the same Jordans.

What?

That's right.

Who?

Tyrell said I bit off him 'cause I

got the same Jordans he did. But

his were the red ones and mine were

all white.

Yours were red too by the time he

was done with you.

Everybody laughs but Tim.

Air bloody tooth.

So what are those, like fake teeth

you got now?

He only chipped one tooth. So what

are you up to now, Mark, digging

graves?

Silence. A SPOON CLANKS on a plate.

Mark's getting into real estate.

cigarette.

Tim can speak Klingon.

What?

No, I can't.

Yes, you can.

What the fuck is Klingon?

Like the Star. Trek guys?

Yup. He can talk in their language.

She's kidding.

No, I'm not. He's being shy. Are

you being shy?

Don't be shy, Tim.

Yeah let's hear it, man?

It's just made up. The guy who

plays the wizard at work is a

Trekky. I don't really...

He's being shy. Say what you said

to me last night.

No.

Yeah, Tim. Say what you said to her

last night.

Silence. Everyone stares at Tim.

I gotta get going anyway.

Say what you said to her last

night.

Kuntar peteeky maya. Al fook soo.

They all stare at him. Then burst out laughing.

You've got to be kidding me.

It means, "I like to mate after

battle."

That's not what I said.

Yes.

No, that wasn't the one I said.

This one means "kill Kirk" and also

'hallelujah" depending on the

context.

You must have gotten it confused

with "Pleej artulyah. Hagtooth

pleep."

Theylaugh.

That was good, honey.

You know what that means, Tim?

No I don't know the whole language,

I just...

well I do. It means get the fuck

out of my house before I chop your

fuckin' head off.

Silence. Large stares at Mark in disbelief, then starts to

LAUGH. They all start to join him except Mark. They stop

laughing.

Mark, he's a knight.

He's just a fast-food knight.

I should get going anyway.

He gets up to leave. But his sword gets caught between his

chair and the table. They all watch as he fumbles to undo

himself. He's like John Ritter at his finest. Large and Mark

just laugh.

Thanks for the cereal. By the way,

it says "balls" on your face.

Carol follows Tim out. Large slides to the microwave door's

reflection.

My Mom did it.

IT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- LATER

Mark and Large sit captivated by ALLIGATORS EATING ZEBRAS on

TV. Large's forehead is now merely smeared with black ink.

Mark leans forward to pull a bong hit from a blackened,

colored tube. He coughs out his hit and reclines his bare

back against the torn pleather couch. Carol enters and stands

next to them watching the TV.

What's this?

She finds a long, thin cigarette with lipstick on it in the

ashtray and lights it.

What the fuck is that shit, Mom?

Where's this? Gimme a hit of that.

Don't bring those fucking people

here anymore, Mom. Or I'm leaving.

I'm serious. No Medieval Times

people in this house.

He passes the bong to his Mom. She smokes it, then sits down,

forcing them both to slide over. Several cats surround her_

MARK (CONT`D)

I'm declaring it. Now. It's

declared, now. Thank you. No more.

Did you tell Large about the tapes?

No, Ma. I'm not doin' the stupid

tapes.

what are the tapes?

Real estate tapes. You can make up

to a hundred thousand your first

year. You should have seen the boat

this one Oriental had.

Be even had his own game show in

China he made so much money. I

think Mark would be perfect at it.

Mom, shut-up about those fucking

tapes. It's a scam.

It's not a scam. They show you how

to do it. It's not hard, honey.

Then I could retire and we could

have our own game show.

Carol and Large share a laugh.

In China.

In China is right.

So... what, you like sell property?

It's bullshit. You were just all

baked,out and you thought it would

be a good idea.

Well I'm doin' it. I'm savin' up

for those tapes. 'Cause I know what

you could be if you just applied

yourself.

I do apply myself, Mom; everyday, I

work my ass off burying dead

people, okay? I'm only twenty-six,

I'm not in any rush. What's your

rush for? Just let me be, all

right? I don't rush you.

Well then I'm gonna do them then.

Fine. Do'em.

I will and then I won't let you

come on my yacht. Large, you're

welcome anytime, but leave your

friend behind.

Large LAUGHS. She checks her watch.

Shit, I gotta go to my meeting.

Okay.

She stands up and then leans over and kisses Mark on the top

of his head.

Okay. Love you. Okay, bye Large

good to see you.

Yeah. Good to see you too.

She gets to the door, then crosses back to Mark.

Don't sit in here all day you guys;

I took the batteries outta that

carbon monoxide detector 'cause it

was beeping all night.

She slams the front door.

She drives me crazy. She's gets all

fried out and makes me feel like I

gotta impress her all the fucking

time. And you know what? I'm okay

with being unimpressive; I sleep

better.

Large site forward abruptly.

Oh not What time is it ?

IT. NEUROLOGIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

Large rushes in to the counter. A female Hispanic

RECEPTIONIST looks up.

Hi, I'm Andrew bargeman. I'm sorry.

i'mn a little late for my

appointment.

She looks at her watch.

okay, Andrew. I'm going to need you

to fill out this paperwork for me,

and we'll call you when we're ready

for you.

Okay, thanks. Sorry.

He site back down and begins filling out the form-

The door opens and a blind woman with a seeing eye-dog

enters. The Receptionist sees her and calls out:

Hi Mrs. Lubin.

MRS. LUBIN

Oh, hello there.

Just have a seat and we'll be with

you soon.

MRS. LUBIN

Thank you.

She site. Large turns back to his paperwork. He fills out a

line before he notices the "seeing-eye-dog" has wandered over

to him. Large looks at him.

(cold, disinterested)

Hi, how are you?

The dog looks both ways before mounting Large's leg and

proceeds to thrust his groin to and fro.

Large tries to shove him off. He looks back at the blind

woman who stares off in the other direction. Large is about

to say something to her but he stops himself.

(under his breath)

Get off. Off.

The dog thrusts away.

Stop it. Heel. No thrust.

LAUGHING. Large turns to see a cute 20 year old GIRL he

hadn't seen sitting in the corner. She wears really big

headphones.

Got any suggestions?

Kick his balls.

Ready for me?

The girl and Large look to each other, the receptionist is

gone.

Not yet Mrs. Lubin.

The dog humps away.

The girl comes over and sits one seat away from Large.

Kick his balls.

I don't want to hurt him.

It's the only way to teach them. I

have three Dobermans. If I didn't

kick them in the balls regularly

I'd never get anything done.

Yeah, but I don't want to like

destroy future generations of

charitable dogs. Besides he's got

to be close to finishing by now.

Not yet, here comes the lipstick.

They sit and watch him go.

Oh, he's gonna be sore tomorrow.

WIDE SIDE ANGLE ON: the whole waiting room. Everything still

but the dog's thrusting pelvis.

Mrs. Lubin?

MRS. LUBIN

Yes.

We're ready for you.

MRS. LUBIN

Okay. C'mon Arthur.

Arthur immediately responds to her voice and returns to her

side to lead her into the office.

I feel so used.

She laughs.

LARGE (CON2''D)

Thanks for your help. Or at least

your good intentions.

I recognize you.

Oh, did you go to Columbia High?

No, not from high school, from TV.

Didn't you play the retarded

quarterback.

(Wishing she'd go away)

Yeah.

Are you really retarded?

He stares at her.

No.

That's cool. Great job, man. You

were- I mean I thought you were

really retarded. You were just as

good as that corky kid and he's

really retarded. I mean if there's

some kind of like retarded Emmy you

could win. You'd kick Corky's ass.

I got to fill this thing out, but

thank you for... that.

Oh, okay. Right on. My cousin's an

actor. Jake Ryan Winters. I doubt

you'd know him. He was on "Sheena"

once as some gnome or something. I

think that's great though.

Thank you.

Oh that last scene where you make

that speech to the whole stadium

and your Dad gives you the thumbs

up; that was - it was emotional. I

mean I didn't cry, but I think my

Dad did.

I couldn't totally see, but he got

up to go to the bathroom and I

think I heard him sniffle. Could've

been dander...

Well thanks. Thank you.

So are you doing anything else?

No. Not right now I'm just...

Any other retarded roles? I'm sure

you could definitely get more of

those.

No, I'm just auditioning and.,.

I can't believe you're not really

retarded. Jake's not a very good

actor. I mean on "Sheens" you

couldn't really tell 'cause he was

in a hairy gnome suit, but he used

to put on these really low-budge

renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber

musicals in our attic when we were

kids and they were awful. It sucks

'cause there isn't a whole lotta

work for little people, you know?

Anyway sorry I talk too much, fill

out your forms.

Large just stares at her. She's funny.

What are you listening to?

"The Shins." You know them?

No.

Oh are you kidding me? You gotta

here this one song, it'll change

your life I promise you. Oh but you

have to fill out your forms.

Conundrum.

Well do it while you listen to

She hands him her hugs earphones. The Shins' "flew slang" is

playing.

He looks at Sam and she just Stares at him and nods smiling.

After a moment, he takes the phones off and hands them back

to her. The SONG CONTINUES SOFTLY from the headphones.

That's cool. I like it.

So what are you doing here?

What are you doing here?

Waiting for a friend. You?

I'm uh... there's a_..

Fuck, that was nosey, I'm sorry. I

didn't mean to be nosey. That was

so nosey.

Its al=ight. I... I uh get

headaches. So I just wanna have

that checked out.

Cool.

Andrew Largeman?

Yes.

We're ready for you.

Okay.

He stands. He turns to Sam.

It was nice meeting you.

You didn't. I'm Sam.

Andrew.

Cool. well, bye. Good luck with

your head.

Thanks.

Don't worry Sam, we'll get to you

next.

Large turns to Sam. She looks away.

INT. NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Large site alone in a barren office. He pans around the room

staring at all the diplomas. His eyes follow them up from the

base-board all the way up to the ceiling to reveal: there's

actually one on the ceiling. The doctor enters.

Mr. Andrew Largeman.

Yes - hi.

There's absolutely nothing wrong

with you.

Large stares.

What?

I'm just kidding, how would I know

that?

Yeah.

They shape hands.

I'm Doctor Cohen. What can we do

for you today, Andrew?

I've been having these really

intense headaches. They only last

for a split second and then they're

gone. It's like a lightning flash;

almost like a surge of electricity

and then it's gone.

He looks at the chart.

You're Gideon's kid. I didn't even

put the two together.

Yeah.

I'm sorry about you're Mother.

Yeah. Thank you.

I must have missed you at Shiva

last night.

Yeah.

So how long have these headaches

been going on?

Well I think I've had them in some

form since I was a little kid. But

they've been getting more and more

frequent over the last year.

(looking at chart)

How long have you been on the

Lithium?

Oh uh, I've been on some form of it

since I was ten or so.

And what about Paxil, Zoloft,

Celexa, Depakote; did any of that

ever help you?

No. I mean I don't know. It's

recently occurred to me that I

might not even have a problem. only

I'd never know it, because as far

back as I can remember I've been

medicated. I grew up on it. I left

them in LA. This is the first time

I haven't had it in my body since I

can remember.

Well it'll leave your body pretty

fast. I'll write you a

prescription.

Actually I. was thinking about

taking a little vacation.

Have you spoken to your

psychiatrist about that?

E)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad.

So uh... he... I think he'd prefer

me to stay on it. He likes to think

it makes me happy. And I let him

think that because he's sort of

consumed by the idea of making

everyone happy.

Well look, I'll examine you and

give you a Catscan just so you

won't worry that it's anything

serious. But to be honest, I think

the headaches are something else.

Our bodies do very funny things

when they're consumed with stress

and anxiety. Things you'd never

expect. I found my ex-best friend's

cuff links in my wife's puree and I

couldn't get an erection for a year

and a half.

For example.

But that doesn't really feel like

it. I mean I don't feel stressed or

really anxious at all.

Well with all the Lithium he's had

you on it's amazing you can even

hear me right now_

Oh, right.

First of all, I do think you need

to find a psychiatrist that isn't

your father. That just's something

that should have been remedied

years ago. He knows better.

Secondly, I'm not in a position to

comment on whether or not you

should stay on the meds or not; I

don't know your story. But my

opinion, since you're paying for

it, is that those drugs may help as

a means to an end. But if you're

not In any sort of therapy, sooner

or later what's ever going on in

your mind will find a way to peek

it's little head out of the water.

Just something to think about.

,beat)

But, for now, let's have a look at

you.

INT. CATSCAN ROOM - LATER

AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF: Large staring at the wall as he lies on

a white slab covered from the waist down by a white towel.

AN OLD FEMALE NURSE straps him to the slab ignoring the

OBSCENE WORDS and DRAWINGS in black marker that cover his

chest.

THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN to reveal Large and the slab being

sucked.into the Catscan tunnel.

EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY

Large drives out of the parking lot. There, seated at the bus

stop is Sam bobbing her head to music- She wears a backpack

and holds an odd looking helmet in her hand.

He pulls up alongside her.

Why were you really there?

Charging. I'm a robot.

Do you lie a lot?

What do you consider a lot?

Enough for people to call you a

liar.

People call me lots of things.

Is one of them "liar"?

I could say "no", but how will you

know I'm not lying.

Because I`ll choose to trust YOU.

You can do that?

I can try.

Who's bike is this?

It was my grandfather's. It was the

only thing he left to anyone in my

family and he left it to me. And I

like it.

This is the point where you ask me

if I'd like a ride home?

It is?

Yup.

Would you like a ride home?

Fine, but I ' m not getting in that

sidecar,

Why not?

Sidecars are for bitches. Anyone

who gets in that thing is

automatically your bitch. Thus, I

will ride on the back.

She climbs on the back behind him.

(re: the helmet)

What are you like... a hanglider?

They drive off.

EXT NJ STREET/MOVING---DAY

I thought my boyfriend was gonna

pick me up on his bike, so I

brought it... But then he couldn't

so...

So what, it's like one of those

tandem things?

No, its a Ninja. Way faster than

this thing.

But what kind of helmet is that?

You can use it on a motorcycle.

Anyway, how's your head?

I should live through the day.

Cool. Make a right here.

They stop at a light.

Are you doing anything right now?

Can you elaborate on "doing

anything"?

Well, I just had this idea. I

promised this guy I'd stop by his

house that's right up here, but I

don't really wanna stay very long.

So I was just thinking if you came

with me I could say I have to take

you home when I'm ready to go.

Wow. well that's pretty damn random

of ya, Andrew.

I know.

'Nice to meet you. May I use you?'

That's the Hollywood in ya I guess.

No, it's not like that, c'mon.

It'll be fun. I promise.

I'll tell you what. We'll have like

a signal. When you pull on your ear

that's the code and then I'll say,,

"Well I've got to get her home

now." And then we'll go.

She mulls it over.

Can we have code names too?

If you'd like.

okay. But don't try and like

kidnap me or anything, because my

step-uncle's a bounty hunter and I

could have you tracked and killed.

Liar.

The light changes and they drive off.

EXT. JESSE'S MANSION'S FRONT YARD - DAY

The poorly maintained backyard of a mansion: pools,

fountains. Jesse stands shirtless and unshaven holding an

enormous bow and arrow aimed at the sky. The end of the arrow

is on fire. A joint hangs from his lips. Sam and Large look

terrified.

'Kay ready?

He unleashes the arrow into the air and the three of them

scramble around in terror trying to avoid wherever it will

land. It plunges into the earth three feet from Sam's foot.

Frozen, she yanks on her ear; hard.

EXT. SAM'S HOUSE -- DAY

Sam and Large stand on the front porch of her working class

house.

I'll be fine. Am I the first boy

you've ever brought home?

No. But I lied about my boyfriend

driving a t.inja.

He doesn't drive a bike?

No, I don't have a boyfriend.

He might drive a bike; wherever he

is.

Well we're off to a great start.

okay so sometimes I lie. I'm weird,

man. About random stuff too; and I

don't even know why I do it. It's

like a tick. I swear, sometimes I

hear myself say something and then

I think: "Wow, that's not even

remotely true.

So how am I supposed to know what's

real?

Well, I always feel bad and admit

them when they're lies.

Can you trust that?

Open the door.

TNT. SAM'S HOUSE: FOYER -- CONTINUOUS

She pushes the front door open and immediately three enormous

Doberman Pinchers BARK and CLIMB all over Large.

Down, Kevin! Mom! Kick their balls!

Kick their balls! Anthrax, heel!

Mom!

Sam tries slapping them on their backs.

OLIVIA, Sam's mother, comes rushing in clutching a hamster

with a bloody nose.

Everybody downl Who wants to eat?

Do you want to eat? Well then get

the fuck off him! Kevin! Steven!

She smacks their asses and they eventually retreat to the

other room.

OLIVIA (CONT' D)

I'm so sorry, we just don't have

the time to train' em. Who has time

to train'em? When they were

puppies it was cute, but now it's

like having a herd of Clydesdales.

It's just too much.

Kevin's the baby, he really just

follows the others but last week

Anthrax and Steven killed a dove

and left him on the front porch. Or

maybe it was a pigeon, he was grey.

'Member that, Samantha?

Mom, this is .Andrew...

Welcome, welcome. The place is a

wreck, I'm so sorry. You look very

familiar.

He's the retarded quarterback.

Shut up ! Oh my God ! You are the

retarded quarterback. You were so

good on that show. Now I'm really

ashamed. Look at this place. And

I'm wearing sweat pants.

(to Sam, through her

teeth, while nodding at

is he really retarded?

No.

Oh, tell me, what's that Alan

Thicke like? I've heard he's a

cocky son of a bitch.

No, he's a really nice guy.

Oh. Well, welcome, welcome.

Samantha I told you to take the

wheel out of the hamster cage.

She holds up a dead hamster.

I forgot, Mom.

Well you forgot and now Jelly's

dead. Luckily I got peanut Butter

out in time.

We have to get the only hamster on

planet Earth that can't figure out

a stupid hamster wheel. Now the

rest of 'am can't even get a good

sweat going.

There's a shoe box on the kitchen

counter. You can do the honors. I

have to run to work.

She sighs and absentmindedly pate her forehead with the

hamster.

It was so nice to meet you...

Andrew right?

Yes.

Samantha put the clothes in the

dryer and bury Jelly.

She kisses Sam on the cheek and then she's gone.

They stand there a moment to catch their breath. Then they

both start laughing.

Come on in.

They walk into the LIVING ROOM.

INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Big couches with tattered afghans on them. A Christmas tree

with the lights on in the far corner; a few unwrapped

presents underneath. An enormous hamster labyrinth, a fish

tank, three cats, a bird cage.

So this is it.

It's nice.

No it's not. You don't have to say

that just 'cause you can't think of

anything else to say.

I'm not. It's really nice. It's

very cozy. You guys are a little

early on the tree, huh?

Yeah, well we never got around to

taking it down, so when it got to

be fall again we just figured we

might as well leave it. Are you

freaked out? You're totally freaked

out aren't you?

No, not at all. I like it.

Wanna see my room?

Yeah, sure.

They cross to the staircase and are met by TITEMBAY (Ti-TEM-

bay) a handsome, young Black Man in a sweater carrying books.

Titembay, this is my friend,

Andrew. Andrew this is my brother,

Titembay.

Hi, nice to meet you.

T I T EMBAY

Nice to meet you. I'm sorry about

Jelly.

Oh, its okay.

I saved some mac and cheese for

you. It's in the f ridge.

Thanks.

Anyway, I'm late for class, it was

nice meeting you.

Yeah, you too.

They walk up the stairs.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

We watch the locks turn as Sam uses a key from the outside.

Music posters everywhere. Warm, cozy.

This is it.

She puts on a CD, (the song: "I'm Doing Fine" by Colin Hay).

Nothing fancy, but...

What?

Uhh... It's Titembay right?

Yeah, it's weird, huh? You're so

freaked out right now, you're like

running for the door. You can go,

don't feel bad.

Stop doing that.

What?

That whole thing you just did.

Don't do that. I want to be here,

and I wouldn't be here if I didn't

want to be, okay? Trust me, my

family's way more fucked up then

yours, okay?

Okay?

Yeah.

So, Titembay.

Yeah, he's my brother.

Is he adopted?

Well kind of. My mom adopted him

years ago from Sally Strothers. one

of those: For the cost of a cup of

coffee a day" kind of things.

where she's like, "How can you sit

there and not help the children?"

And we just couldn't. We couldn't

sit there and not help those

children. So we sent him letters

and pictures for years and then I

got really into ice skating and we

kind of forgot about'em. Then one

day the phone rang and it was

Titembay and he was at the dry

cleaners around the corner and he

said that he was going to school at

Rutgers and living in the dorms,

but since he was used to living

with his tribe he'd much rather

live with his family.

Wow.

Yeah and he's been here ever since.

He's an amazing guy, you gotta hear

some of his stories. I mean this

guy struggled through so much

because he wanted to learn. I think

of what he's accomplished and I

just feel so lazy. He's studying

criminal justice at Rutgers right

now and when he was a baby he was

one of those kids with flies all

over his face.

Wow. I mean that's great. It's a

crazy story.

That, my friend, is a true story.

I'm not that good-

A pause. Sam sits on the bed. THE AWESOKE MUSIC PLAYS. She

breaks the moment by pulling a small tattered piece of satin

fabric off the bed.

SAM (CO13T'D)

This is Tickle.

Large sits down next to her.

What is Tickle?

Tickle is my favorite thing in the

whole world. It's all that's left

of Nannie... my blanket.

And Tickle is all that remains?

Yeah.

Was there a hurricane or something?

Shut-up. No, I mean I had it since

I was born. it was the blanket they

brought me home in from the

hospital.

It's like the Wailing Wall.

What?

The Wailing Wall. It's like the

most holy place for Jews to go and

pray in Israel. It's all that's

left of this enormous temple that

was destroyed by the Romans.

Wow, so you're like really Jewish?

Large laughs.

Yeah, you are aren't you?

No I'm not. I mean I'm Jewish, but

I'm not really Jewish. I don't do

anything Jewish. I don't go to

temple or anything. But I don't

know any Jews who go to temple. The

Jews I know only go on Yom Kippur.

One day; the day of repentance. Did

you know that most temples are

designed with movable walls so that

on the one day of the year when

a everyone comes to repent they can

actually make the room big enough

to hold everyone?

I don't really believe in God.

Just tickle.

Oh, I believe in Tickle_

They laugh. A nice moment. They hold eye contact. THE AWESOME

MUSIC PLAYS.

We're not gonna like make out or

anything.

What?

I'm sorry, I just totally ruined

the moment didn't I?

No, I wasn't...

I just mean we're not gonna like

make out.

Okay. I hadn't planned on...

I didn't mean to put that out

there, that was lame. BLAAAAHRH.

That was so dumb. You know what I

do when I'm feeling completely

unoriginal?

She stands up and does really weird gestures with her hands.

Large states.

SAM (CONT ' D)

I make a noise or I do something

that no one has ever done. And then

I feel like... unique again; even

if only for a second.

So no one has ever done that?

Not in this spot, no. You just

witnessed a completely original

moment in history. It's refreshing.

You try one.

No.

Come on.

No. Trust me yours was good enough

for both of us.

Come on. What are you shy? This is

your chance to do something that

has never, ever been done before

and will never be copied throughout

human existence. If nothing else,

you'll be remembered as the only

person who ever did this.

He stares at her. She's not gonna let up. Large lifts his

index finger in the air and twirlsa it.

ZzzZzz.

Be stares at her.

How was that?

Oh, I've done that one before.

She bursts out laughing. He smiles.

SAM (CONT ' t3 )

So I got to bury this hamster

before the dogs eat him. You warms

help?

EXT. SAWS BACKYARD-- DAY

Rusty leaves fall on a backyard swallowed mostly by an empty

above-ground swimming pool. Sam carries the shoe box as they

walk around behind the pool to reveal

A SMALL GATED PET CEMETERY

About a dozen large rocks serve as tombstones for different

pets.

Wow.

Yeah.

I mean this is...

I know.

They stand in silence.

It's not that we're bad pet owners

or anything, it's just that we've

had so many of them over the years.

Besides some of these are fish.

Not to say fish deserve less than

other animals, but moat people just

flush them, and we just don't

believe in that. I mean the idea of

flushing something that had life in

it... it just makes me sad, you

know?

You gotta honor something a little

more than that, like

"Congratulations, man, you had

life. Here's your trophy; a little

spot in the ground to hang out in."

Anyway, I'm gonna put Jelly right

here next to "Goliath", the

Rotweiler Titembay backed over

during his driving exam.

She kneels down and begins to dig with a small shovel left

nearby. Large sits down next to her and watches her dig. A

brisk wind makes him hug his knees in for warmth.

What are you thinking about?

Now?

Yes.

Right now?

No. A second ago before I asked.

Uh... Right now I was thinking... I

was thinking that I've been going

to a lot of these things lately.

What, dates?

No, not dates. This isn't a date.

Is this a date? Funerals.

Oh. Who else died?

Uh... that's why I'm home actually.

Yeah, I uh... I haven't even really

told you that yet, but uh... yeah

my Mom just died.

Sam stops digging and stares at him.

God, it's weird to say that out

loud: 'My Mom died". And uh... eo

that's why I'm home... now.

I'm so sorry. Oh, God I'm so sorry.

And here I am putting you through

another one. I mean not that

Jelly's even comes close to your

Mom's. .. Although we loved, Jelly--

But still... I'm so sorry. I didn't

know.

No, it's okay. It's okay actually.

I'm all right with it. Anyway I

think it's what she wanted so..,

How did she die?

Large thinks about that.

SAM (CONT ' D)

I'm sorry, I'm so nosey. Forget I

asked, I'm sorry. I just need to

shut--up sometimes.

No, its okay. She uh... she

drowned actually.

Sam's jaw drops.

My Mom was a paraplegic; she had

uh... she was in a wheelchair. She

was uh... taking a bath and then I

guess she slipped or something.

That's what they say. I don't know.

But needless to say, she drowned.

And so... that's how she died.

Sam is speechless. Tears well in her eyes.

When?

This was uh... Hmm... Sunday.

Oh my God.

Tears roll down her face.

(with a laugh)

Why are you crying?

I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm not

usually like this. It's just so

sad. It's so tragic. Isn't it? It

is. It's like real life tragedy or

something.

Look, let's change the subject,

okay? Let's really bring the focus

back to Jelly. I mean what could be

ruder than talking about someone

else who died while you're in the

act of burying a close friend.

Sam places the box in the hole she's dug.

What should we do?

Well IIve only been to one of these

things,

(re: the other graves)

you appear to be the expert.

We usually say something.

okay, well I'll go first. I didn't

really know you, Jelly. But from

what I hear, you were a good pet.

Had a little trouble with the

wheel...

its not funny. Jelly you were a

great pet.

Tears roll down her face.

I'm so, so sorry I forgot to take

the wheel out of the cage. I'm so

sorry about that.

Goodbye. I hope that you liked me.

Tears stream down her face as she shovels dirt onto the tiny

shoe box. THE PATTER of the SOIL HITTING the BOX is the only

sound we hear as:

THE CAMERA CRANES UP above them to a bird's-eye perspective

settling on a final frame that looks down on the whole

backyard: the above ground pool, the pet cemetery and in the

bottom right corner, Sam burying as Large watches.

INT. LARGEMAN MANSION: LIVING ROOM - DAY

Once again Shiva is in full swing.

Large passes through a doorway and begins to hear a

COMPUTERIZED SEEPING to the tune of the "ShmaA. (A Jewish

prayer.) He looks to his left to see an electronic Mazooza on

the door frame. it says The Sharper image" on the bottom.

He moves his head back and forth past it's censor and each

time it begins the BEEPING of the Shma anew.

THE LIVING ROOM

A tired looking man in his 50's eating a cookie.

Avi wants his Bar Mitzvah theme to

be musicals. As in Broadway

musicals. Can you believe that?

Paul's kid's theme was the Meta; I

got to do the Elora with Mookie

Wilson. Miriam and I were at one

last weekend at the Pierre; whole

thing was like a winter

wonderland... live penguins wearing

yalmulkas. Now me, I got to lay out

ten grand alone for some asshole to

build a barricade of French garbage

across the boccie lanes at my

tennis club.

THE CAMERA PICKS UP LARGE holding a plate of food: as he

approaches Cynthia. She sits alone with a big photo album on

her lap.

I was just thinking-

I was just thinking you spend

you're whole life lusting for

anything you don't have. You stress

over money and your career, you set

your clocks back, you exercise, you

wait in line, you paint your house,

get depressed, feel better, buy

things, take your clothes to the

dry cleaner, set your clocks

forward and spend your whole life

waiting for happiness to arrive in

the mail. Then you die and people

are really sad, they cry really

hard...

and then they go eat lunch.

Hetakes a bite of his bagel.

Oh please be a little more

interesting than that.

Please don't be the brooding guy.

That's so unoriginal. I'd rather

hold onto who I imagined you'd

become.

Miss me?

No. Me?

No.

She didn't like being alive. She

got what she wanted. This should be

a party. Instead we're supposed to

mope. About what? She never did

anything.

She made you.

some trophy. I do have to say I'm

impressed with the turnout.

What, you didn't think people would

come?

Seems to me the only thing more

depressing than a funeral is a

funeral where no one shows up.

Don't you ever think about who'll

show up to yours?

No. Right now I'm alive, so I think

about living.

It's one way to determine who your

friends are. The people who'd show

up at my funeral if it was held in

their state, that's one level of

friend. But my real friends, the

people who really love me, they'd

come if it was on the other side of

the country.

So where do I fall into that?

You'd be there.

Oh you think so?

I do. I think you'd show up because

the truth is, that you really did

miss met you always thought of me

as the brother you never had. But

you've got too much pride to let me

know that. You want to pout 'cause

I don't return your calls.

you're way more talkative than I

remember.

Today I've been more talkative than

I remember.

What about mine?

Funeral? Honestly? I probably

wouldn't travel for it- no. But

don't worry, I'm sure you'll have a

great turnout.

Why do you say that?

'Cause there's also the guy who

lives his life to insure a good

turnout. I think that's how my Dad

lives his-, like he's sort of

writing his own eulogy as he goes

and making life choices dependent

on how it will sound in a speech.

Are you implying that that's why

I'm going to med school or

something?

I'm just saying a lot of people -

not necessarily you - a lot of

people try and accumulate accolades

that will somehow justify their

lives.

It's said we spend ninety-five

percent of our lives trying to look

good.

Where do I sign up for not caring?

How about sucking it up and really

having it out with your Dad? That

would be a tremendous step towards

not needing to look good.

Wow, that was so clever how you did

that. Is he grooming you to be a

psychiatrist too? Med school's one

thing, but please don't become him.

He's one of the most caring people

I've ever met.

well you would say that; you're the

son and daughter he never had.

Hell, you're the family he never

had. Has he got you on Lithium

yet? Wait till he does, you'll love

him even more.

He stands.

I bet my Mom a dollar you were

coming home with a message. I said

after nine years, he's definitely

coming home with a message.

i looked for a message; I got bored

and became an actor.

He leaves.

INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

Large enters the kitchen where JANICE, 50's, Cynthia's Mom,

is doing the dishes. He walks over to the counter near the

sink and just stares off across the room. She dries her hands

and moves to Large. She opens her arms. After a beat he steps

into her embrace. He rests his head on her shoulder and

closes his eyes. Neither says a word.

FADE TO BLACK:

LARGE'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

Morning sun blasts the entire room. Large site on the edge of

his bed squinting at pictures:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Large peeks his head around the doorway.

Hello?

Dad?

After shutting the door behind himself he' crosses to the

dresser and lifts one perfume bottle out from a dozen. He

smells the nozzle then brings the bottle with him as he edges

towards...

INT. MASTER BATHROOM --- CONTINUOUS

The bathroom is stark white. A large Jacuzzi tub sits at the

far end of the room. The faucet drips.

THE MOUTH OF THE FAUCET

as it wells with water and overflows to DRIP onto the drain.

Large crosses to the tub and tries to tighten the faucet to

stop it from dripping. It continues to DRIP. He stares at the

empty tub.

GIDEON (O.S.)

Hi.

Large jumps around and puts his hand to his chest.

Holy shit, you scared the shit out

of me.

He covertly slips the perfume bottle into his pocket.

Just wake up?

Yeah.

Sleep all right?

Yeah... fine.

Mmmm.

I haven't even really been in here

for a while. I've been using the

one in the hall. Shower pressures

awful in there though. It's by no

means as good a bathroom as this

one is. This one is- well we redid

all this. Its uh...

(beat, catching himself)

This is hard.

Yeah.

Silence. The FAUCET DRIPS. They avoid eye contact.

Janice will make you some lunch.

Yeah... good.

Well I guess it's breakfast for

you. What time is it?

Yeah.

Silence. DRIP. DRIP

Look, I wanted to ask you... I mean

if you don't want to talk about

this its perfectly fine, but I'm

just...

No I can. I know. I figured you

would want to...

But we don't have to do it now. I

mean you don't have to do that now.

It's just at some point I would...

I have some questions.

I knew that you would.

Silence.

Occasionally she would hum.., your

Mother. Always the same tune and I

never knew what the song was. I

don't even know if it was a song or

if she just made it up - It's funny

because it always struck me as so

out of character for her and every

time she did it... I just always

liked it. But I never told her I

could hear her because I knew if I

ever did she would stop.

She took a bath every night. And

she was always very quiet.

The only thing I would ever hear

when I'm in the bedroom was a

little splashing of water when she

was moving around. And every now

and then, her humming.

so anyway, then usually she would

call me when she was done, so I

could come and help her out. But

this time, that night... she never

called. And I just figured she was

taking a longer bath or something,

but when I called out to her, she

didn't answer. So then I uh... When

I came in, she was there.

So she didn't yell or...

No. I didn't hear anything. The TV

was on pretty loud. I always watch

the weather report before I go to

sleep.

It's just weird.

What?

I don't know, it's just that you'd

think if someone was really

drowning to death they would

scream. I mean really scream from

the terror of it all, you know?

They would splash and scream I

would think; I would have thought.

I would have too, but no. Nothing.

(off Large's look)

What?

Don't take this the wrong way.

What ?

I'm not reading into this, I'm just

thinking out loud so don't get

What? No.

What?

Its not that.

I'm just saying did they check? I

mean has someone ruled that out?

No. Because they know she drowned,

Andrew.

I'm just saying the facts.

No.

And I suppose it doesn't even

really matter. But I'd be curious

to know. I would like to know if

that's what happened; just for me.

I mean would that surprise you?

No. Yee!

She made it very clear to everyone

she knew that nothing was ever

going to make her happy-

I know! Do you think I don't know?!

And c'mon let's be honest; she

tried it before.

Shut-up! .lust shut your fucking

mouth.

Large is taken aback.

If nothing else will you please

just leave, her alone. She's gone.

That's it. That's all you get. She

died. We will never see her again.

She tried very hard, but she just

couldn't find it. She could never

find it. And I think - I know that

she's found it now. I know that.

And I know there's a certain amount

of guilt that you must feel for the

way things unfolded, but it's too

late now.

So I'm asking you, for me, not to

do that. Don't... come here and do

that.

I think I deserve to know the

truth.

You want to make her crazy. Why?

Does that make it easier for you?

Tears stream down Gideon's face, He sits down on the toilet

and cries.

It's like you want to torture

yourself or something! Why would

you want to think that? That that

happened. Why would you ever want

to think that?

Large moves closer to his father who SOBS with his head in

his lap and his arms over his head. It takes everything Large

has to reach out his hand and almost touch his father's

shoulder, but he doesn't make it and his hand lands on the

sink next to him.

I just want everyone to be happy

again.

I dreamt last night that I had

special powers. If I squeezed my

eyes shut and clinched my fiats

closed tight enough, we'd all wake

up in paradise.

(with a laugh through

I was like a superhero... and that

was my power.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

A giant rusted yellow tractor sits parked by an open grave-

Large and Jesse lean against opposite tombstones facing each

other.

Mark stands in the open grave STEALING VALUABLES FROM AN OPEN

COFFIN. A small PILE OF JEWELRY sits beside the grave.

How could you leave all that

Lithium? I was totally gonna hit

you up for some.

This fuckin' guy. I'm glad you're

back, man, because this town is so

messed up. Everyone's got there

drug of choice like in "Brave New

World". Did you ever read that

book? Who wrote that? Aldous

something. Aldous-

I don't know.

Jesse continues talking, but his voice distorts into WARBLED

SLOW MOTION: LARGE STARES in shock as Mark drops a WEDDING

RING into the PILE OF JEWELRY he's stealing off the corpse.

MARK LOOKS UP AT LARGE STARING AT HIM AND HIS LOOT. THEY HOLD

EYE CONTACT FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT. Large breaks it and

looks away.

JESSE (O.S.)

.and people are just like that

here, man. Huxtable3 Aldous

Huxtable. That's it.

INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Sam and Large are looking through a photo album. Olivia

enters with an enormous Parrot on her shoulder.

Andrew would you like to see Sam's

ice skating tape?

Mom, no.

Absolutely.

She was so ahead of her time. She

could have gone to the Olympics.

No, I couldn't have.

Yes, you could have. Don't blame it

on the epilepsy, you had a gift.

Large looks to Sam, but she avoids eye contact with him-

C'mon let me see it.

Let's just show him the "Florida

Stars of the Ice" opening; the

Gator costume.

Mom. I'm asking you seriously.

Don't be shy. Just let me see it.

Oh, she wants you to see it. How

could you not want him to see how

talented you are?

Were.

They cross to the TV room where they find Titembay wearing

rubber gloves, seated next to an open tool box, dusting the

coffee table for fingerprints and referring to an open text

book. White powder reveals fingerprints (and pawprints)

everywhere, including the TV screen.

Honey what are you doing?

I'm dusting for prints.

Well do you think we could move the

crime scene to the kitchen? I want

to show Andrew Sam skating.

But someone's been pissing on my

Gamecube and I'm about to close the

case.

It wasn't me your honor.

The pawprints point to a canine.

Andrew come sit down here next to

me.

Large sits next to Olivia on the couch between snoring

Dobermans. He places his glass of water on the table. Sam

stands in the doorway.

I can't believe you're showing him

this.

THE SHAKY, AMATEUR VIDEO comes up on the screen: a person in

a full alligator costume wearing white gloves skates onto the

ice. The lights come down except for a spotlight on the

alligator.

There she is.

You're the alligator?

You can tell by the hands.

The alligator skates in and out of the white fingerprints on

the TV screen to classical music. We begin to see that Sam is

a talented skater. In a very odd way, it's beautiful.

Here comes the Double Axle...

And... land! I mean come on. Isn't

she good?

Large, Titembay and Olivia APPLAUD. As they do, the LIGHTS in

the room SWITCH ON and OFF. Titembay CLAPS twice to turn them

back on.

That was so good. You're Mom's

right you were amazing.

Titembay has begun brushing white powder on Large's water

glass revealing his fingerprints.

Okay this was great, but we have to

go now.

All right, well I just wanted to

show you how talented she is. My

baby.

Mom.

Okay get out of here. Wait, Give me

a hug.

Sam crosses to her mom. They hug.

I love you so much. I'm so proud of

you.

I love you too.

Olivia kisses Sam on her forehead.

Okay, have a good night.

She pats Sam's butt as she walks toward the door.

Bye. Thank you so much for dinner.

C'mon, you're giving me a hug too.

Mom.

I'll take a hug.

They embrace.

Okay, good-night.

(calling to Titembay)

Night, Tim.

Good-Night.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

It was the only thing I ever really

liked doing; pretending to be

someone else.

But I've been so out of it the only

parts I ever get offered are to

play handicapped people.

She tries to hold it together, but she bursts out laughing.

It's not funny.

Oh c'mon. Don't ya see that it's a

joke. If you can't laugh at

yourself life's gonna seem a lot

longer than you'd like.

So what should we laugh at you

about?

I lied again. I have epilepsy.

Which part are we laughing about?

I had a seizure in the law office

where I work and they said their

insurance would only cover me if I

wore "preventative covering".

Preventative covering?

The helmet I was carrying.

Large is silent.

SAM (CONT' D)

Oh come on, that's funny. I'm the

only person in the world wearing a

helmet to work who isn't putting

out fires or racing for NASCAR. But

what do you do? I can't quit; their

insurance is amazing. What can you

do? You laugh. I'm not saying I

don't cry a lot, but in between I

laugh and realize how silly taking

anything very seriously is. And

plus, I look forward to a good cry.

I just love the way it feels.

I haven't cried since I was a

little kid. I didn't cry at my

mother's funeral. I wanted to-

I... tried. I thought of all the

saddest things I could think of;

things in movies, this image from

Life magazine that haunts me...

nothing came.

That actually made me sadder than

anything; the fact that I felt no

numb.

What do you mean?

MARK (O. S.)

Vagina!

Oh, no.

Mark, Dave and Jesse appear with some others.

Hey, guys, this is Sam. This is

Mark, Dave and you met Jesse.

Hey. Nice to meet you.

Hey.

T'sup.

I'm sorry I yelled- 'vagina' just

now, I didn't see you.

It's okay.

Nice. Let's get fucked up.

Off Large's smile we:

EXT. JESSE'S POOL -- NIGHT

A palatial swimming pool in the backyard of Jesse's mans ion.

The Manhattan skyline twinkles far in the distance.

Large, Sam, Mark, Dave, Jesse and a couple of high school

girls from the bar stand in their underwear on the edge of

the pool.

One, two, three!

Everyone jumps into the pool SCREAMING except for Large. He

stands there staring at the water.

Hey! what are you doing?

Largeman, get the fuck in the pool.

oh, it's so warm!

Can you swim?

'Course I can swim.

JUMP CUT TO. Large in the shallow-end doing the most pathetic

doggy paddle you've ever seen. Everyone stares in disbelief.

Dude maybe you should stay on the

steps; I don't know CPR.

You look like a drunken beaver.

They all laugh- Sam swims over to him sitting on the steps.

She smiles at him.

(in a whisper)

I never learned how to swim.

Fooled me. I thought you just had a

cramp.

Or two.

He smiles.

(in a whisper)

I can't whistle if it makes you

feel any better.

There's a handful of normal kid

things I kinda missed.

There's a handful of normal kid

things I kinda wish I'd missed.

She floats on her back beside him.

So how long are you gonna stay

here?

Probably till my fingers get

wrinkly.

(with a laugh)

No, I mean in Jersey.

Oh. I think I'll probably head home

the day after tomorrow. well, LA.

That's not my home.

Rer smile fades.

You know that point in your life

when you realize that the home you

grew up in isn't really your home

anymore? And all of a sudden, even

though you have a place where you

put your Shit, the idea of "home',

is gone.

I still feel at home in my house.

You'll gee when you move out. It

just kind of happens one day and

it's gone. And you feel like you

can never get it back. it's like

you feel homesick for a place that

doesn't even exist. But maybe it's

like this rite of passage, you

know? And you won't ever have that

feeling again until you create a

A new idea of "home" for yourself,

for the family you start, for your

kids. It's like this cycle.

Maybe that's all a family really

is; a group of people who miss the

same imaginary place.

They hold eye contact. The SPLASH of a CANNONBALL swings

their gaze to the others horsing around in the deep end. Sam

leans her head over and rests it on his shoulder.

Maybe.

INT. JESSE'S MANSION: LIVING ROOM -- LATER

An enormous and desolate LIVING ROOM devoid of any furniture

or decoration. Mark, Jesse, Sam and Large sit huddled under

towels at the foot of a colossal fire place that houses a

small blaze. They eat potato chips and drink canned beer.

They are all pretty tipsy. Mark plays with a "Silent Velcro"

sample.

How 'bout some fucking furniture

dude.

I bought a chair but I didn't like

it.

Where is it?

Its keeping us warm.

Silent Velcro. Lucky motherfucker.

I got an idea: loud tape, we'll

make millions.

I feel like if I had showed up at

school and presented the idea of

silent Velcro they would have sent

me away a whole lot sooner.

They all laugh.

So why did they send you away?

She takes a sip of her beer.

Whoa, listen to this girl.

They didn't send me away.

You're the one who said they sent

you away.

I mean they did, but... they sent

me to boarding school. "Sent me

away" implies I went to some asylum

or something. There were no straps

involved.

Why did they send you to boarding

school?

Large looks to Jesse and Mark.

They sent me to boarding school

because uh... they thought I might

be dangerous.

Oh are you freaked out? You're so

freaked out right now.

That's funny.

Why did they think you might be

dangerous?

I'm dangerous and I didn't get to

go to boarding school.

I was a kid and I was - they

just... I was a teenager and they

were depressed and it just wasn't a

good combo.

But obviously something happened. I

mean there must have been an event.

You're like a little detective.

I know. You and Titembay should go

into business together; solve

mysteries out of a van.

Am I being too nosey?

No. No. I just... it's fine.. I just

haven't ever really talked about

it.

To be honest, I never really knew

either. I mean I heard stories.

You wanna know?

Yeah.

Really, really?

You're gay.

No. Drumroll... I was the reason

she was in a wheelchair.

I pushed her.

So there that is.

Shut up.

Fuck you.

No, it's the truth.

Why?

It was a complete freak accident. I

mean its one of those things that

you replay a million times in your

head and you see so clearly what a

freak thing it was. I... Say whole

life she was depressed for no

reason. Look at this picture.

He pulls the picture of he and Cynthia as children wearing

chicken slippers out of his wallet.

Look at her face.. That's how, she.

was every single day of her life.

And one day... I was nine years old

and I just really hated, her for

that, and I pushed her.

I mean it was innocent. I was just

frustrated 'cause...

You couldn't make her happy.

Yeah. Fuck yeah. And any other

time, she would have just yelled at

me and sent me to my room, but this

time, in that moment, the door of

the dishwasher was open. The latch

on it was broken and it would just

randomly fall open. That fucking

latch; it's funny how so much of my

life hasbeendetermined by a

quarterinchpiece of plastic. So

she fellbackover the door and her

neck hitthekitchen counter;

paralyzing her from the waist down.

Sam's eyes are wide in shock.

Oh my God.

Still want to compare fucked up

families?

But your Mom was in the wheelchair

long before you left.

Well I was nine. They sent me to

therapy and my Father put me on

these drugs that were supposed to

"curb my anger". And I've been on

some form of them ever since. My

Mother who was clinically depressed

before the accident, sank even

lower to the point where she just

ignored everyone but our

housekeeper, Janice and her

daughter, Cynthia. And when I was

sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came

around to the conclusion that it

might not be the healthiest

environment for me to be growing up

in. So he sent me to boarding

school. And I haven't been home

since.

Until now.

For her funeral.

Until now for her funeral. I'm off

to a ripping start in this life,

huh? Next time through I think I'll

lay low out of the gate.

He takes a sip of his beer.

LARGE (CONT ' D)

The thing is though, when I think

about it, I wasn't really

abnormally angry at all. I mean it

all happened so quickly; I got

prescribed all these drugs for

anxiety and depression and anger so

I just kind of became what they

are.

It sounds like a punishment.

I think it was. So I left them in

LA. I'm taking myself off

punishment.

Please don't remind me.

All he heard of that whole story

was "left drugs in LA".

Fuck you.

Crackhead.

A 19 year old girl from the pool comes around the corner

Mark? Where's the sauna?

Mark and Jesse look at each other. They race towards her

tripping drunkenly on towels and pushing each other out of

the way.

Sam smiles at Large. Her face glowswarm from the fire.

What?

You're "in it" right now aren't

you?

what do you mean?

My Mom always says that when she

can see I'm like working something

big out she'll say, "Are you in it

right now?" And I look at you, and

you tell me this story and...

you're... you're definitely "in it"

right now.

I think you're right. I'm "in it".

But I'm so glad I'm "in it" 'cause

I'm working it all out, you know?

I haven't swallowed a pill in four

days now and I can already feel

this eerie clarity. It's probably

the reason I just can't stop

fucking talking; these.rusty cogs

in my brain have started

spinning... fast.

Maybe that's why you've been

getting those headaches.

Alright can we just forget about

all that stuff please and talk

about good etuff.

Good stuff?

Yeah, glass half-full shit. What do

you got?

I got a little buzz. That's what

I've got. What do you got?

I got a little buzz going.

And I like you.

Sam smiles and looks away. A beat of silence. She tries to

stifle her smile by pursing her lips as she turns back and

looks him in the eyes. She's so cute.

So... there's that. I got that.

INT. LARGEMAN SOUSE - KITCEEN -- MORNING

Large with bedhead in his boxers hunches over into the

refrigerator. He pulls out orange juice and closes the door

to reveal Gideon standing there.

Ah! Jesus, you scared the shit out

of me. You're always doing that.

Why are you always doing that?

I haven't seen you in awhile.

Yeah I've been kind of catching up

with people around here.

Dr. Cohen called. There's nothing

wrong with you.

Yeah I think I'm starting to figure

that out myself.

when are you thinking of leaving?

I think probably tomorrow. I gotta

lot of stuff I got to do back in

LA. I'm gonna have to find a new

job. So...

We need to talk.

Yeah. How? I mean when?

what are you doing... now?

Well actually I was supposed to

meet my friend Mark. But how about

later tonight?

okay. And well talk. we owe that

to each other.

Yeah.

We owe it to her.

Yeah.

Good.

I'm sorry I scared you.

INT. MARK'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

Mark sits on his sheetlese mattress on the floor, playing

classical guitar; impressively. His MUSIC scores the scene.

Don't mesa with all my shit; what

are you. doing?

Large picks up a small brown egg wearing tiny clothes.

You still have your egg baby? Mine

broke the first day.

Don't you fail if it breaks?

Yeah, well she gave us a C cause my

partner fell on some ice. My-wife

tell on some ice and killed our egg

baby.

Jesse cooked his.

They both laugh.

Why's it brown?

'Cause my wife was Tanisha Lubin.

Oh.

Large laughs at Mark's earnestness.

You kept her little blue skirt on.

He's a boy. His name's Shantel.

It's a girl, she's wearin' a skirt.

They're shorts.

Shorts?

Yeah, he's a boy, Shantel. They're

shorts.

Oh.

They laugh. Large flips through an album.

You collect "Desert Storm Trading

Cards"?

Fuck yeah, dude. Those are

collectors items. Do you have any

idea how much those things will be

worth some day.

Really?

Hell yeah. That shit's like an

investment. I have lots of little

investments - all over the place.

I'm gonna sel3. 'em all one day and

just live off 'em.

So like how much is this one worth?

Which?

"Night Vision Goggles."

I don't know. Mint; maybe two,

three.

Dollars?

Yeah. But it's too early. You don't

sell'em yet. Don't you know

anything about investing. I'm gonna

live off that shit. That

"Schwarzkopf" card is worth at

least five something. And if you

have the complete set it's worth

like thousands.

So do you have the complete set?

Almost. The corners are bent on my

"Friendly Fire" and someone stole

my "Wolf Blitzer".

Someone stole it?

One of my Mom's Medieval Times

friends, man. Drug addicts.

For drugs they sold it?

Yeah.

Wolf Blitzer.

It doesn't matter if you're a rich

house wife looking for your muscle

relaxers or some crack head drying

cars: people will do anything in

this town to get their drug money.

Now look, what do you gotta do

today? I gotta little going away

present for you. But I kinds gotta

track it down. So, can you give me

a ride?

Yeah, sure I just...

What?

Nothing I just...

Say it... speak.

Nothing I just, I told Sam I was

gonna hang out with her today...

She can come, I don't care.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS- DAY

GREAT MUSIC PLAYS.

They drive the motorcycle through the Jersey suburbs; Sate on

the back and Mark in the sidecar wearing a lacrosse helmet

and ski goggles.

LARGE'S POV: A mother and her stroller. A huge group of Black

teenagers coming home from school. An old crossing guard. An

ambulance. Two powerwalkere.

INT. HANDI-WORLD - LATER

They walk down an aisle.

What are we doing in the mall.

I don't wanna be in the fucking

mall.

We're making some money for your

present. Just don't look so guilty.

What do you mean, how do I look

guilty?

VOICE (0.S.)

Andrew Largeman?

They turn. KARL BENSON, greasy hair wearing a wrinkled, red

"Nandi--World" vest and dirty pants stands holding a small

box.

Oh, no. Benson.

Oh, no.

Who's that?

Don't give him your number.

Karl approaches.

Hey, what's up, man.

Hey.

Holy shit, I haven't seen you since

like junior year.

I know.

I thought you killed yourself.

What?

I thought you killed yourself, that

wasn't you?

No. That wasn't me?

Who killed themselves?

Just that Gleason kid. Oh, and

Tina.

Tina who?

You remember Tina. She was like

anorexic. She did gymnastics...

Sam is horrified by this conversation.

oh yeah, gymnastics Tina. How'd she

do it?

I don't know. She wasn't Jewish, I

didn't bury her.

I think sleeping pills. or that car

in the garage thing. I forgot.

Sam is yanking on her ear for Large to see, but he doesn't

notice.

This is Sam. Sam this is Karl.

Hey.

Listen I'm gonna go grab that

thing. So just hang here and I'll

be back.

Oh.

He walks off.

He's such a dick.'

Why'd you say that?

He stole my little brother's last

dose of Ritalin and the little

fucker glued his lips closed.

Weren't you on TV or something?

Yeah. Yeah I was. Just this thing.

So you're like what, working here?

Only for awhile I'm opening my own

business. Actually, I should tell

you about it. I'm looking for smart

people like you, Large. I should

get your number.

Yeah, definitely.

So what 'a in the box.

Oh, washers. I'm s'posed to

count'em.

Washers?

(picking one out)

You know these little round metal

things you put between a bolt and a

nut.

Oh, washers. I never use those. I

never knew what they were for, so. I

just always threw them away. I

never used washers.

Silence.

Oh, well listen, I want to talk to

you both about a good opportunity.

(like he's memorized it

For you and your loved ones. We all

have dreams. I know I do. I know

of an exciting opportunity that

people are talking about.

Mark returns holding a box with a picture of steak knives on

the side.

Hey. We gotta get going.

Yeah, well it was great to see you,

man. I'm sure I'll see you around.

Yeah, well let me get your number.

oh, well we gotta run. I'm listed.

Just call information. It's been so

long since I've been home I don't

even remember it.

Nice meeting you.

INT. HANDI-WORLD CHECKOUT -- CONTINUOUS

Why is it always the losers who get

into the pyramid schemes? Why isn't

it ever some charming hot girl

nagging you incessantly to buy

shit?

Oh, is that what it is?

Detergent or some shit. The thing I

don't understand is, if it worked,

why would he be working here. The

guy's a freak; he pops Darvocet

like it's Ritalin.

Why are you buying knives? I don't

need knives.

They arrive at the counter. A young Black woman with enormous

gold earrings and long fingernails stands at the register.

I'd like to return these.

You got a receipt.

Actually, no. It was a gift.

She clicks her tongue. She begins filling out a form.

Why are you returning these?

They're not sharp enough.

They're not sharp enough?

No. Not for what we need them for.

They couldn't cut cans.

You bought them to cut cans?

No, but in the commercial they say

that if I wanted to cut cans I

could. But with these knives I

can't.

Well it comes with a sharpener. Did

you try it?

Yeah, they're just... I don't want

them; not sharp enough.

She rings it into the register and counts out bills to Mark.

Thirty-nine, fifty-three. I hope we

came in handy at Handi-World.

Please come again.

They exit the store and enter the mall.

EXT. MALL - DAY

They walk past stacks of lumber.

A major loop-hole in the Handi-

World return policy permits returns

without receipts on items below

forty dollars.

So how often do you go?

I hit every employee once, then

wait for them to. hire. new ones.

Luckily, no one works at Handi-

World for very long. Except Karl

Benson.

You know, Mark, it's my last day in

town. I have money. I can give you

some.

I don't need your money, I'm making

my own right now.

Or fuck, take Jesse's - the guys a

millionaire.

Mark stops and looks at Large in the eyes.

i don't take anybody's money,

Andrew. I make my own. Favors are

bad news. And the only thing worse

than a favor, is a favor involving

money.

EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- LATER

The motorcycle pulls up behind two ambulances being cleaned

with hoses. Large sees Cynthia changing the sheets on a

stretcher. They climb off.

This will only take a second.

Is Aaron here?

This is Sam.

Hi.

Hey.

(re: the stretcher)

Did he live?

She... had an eight pound boy.

You delivered him?

Yeah.

Wow.

Yeah.

What are you doing here?

Mark's picking up something.

He's as friendly as always.

The three stand in awkward silence.

through making it.

Grab that one... over... once

more... good. That side... crease

the corner. . .under.. .good. Same

thing on this one... Voila.

So were you there?

Where?

Were you on the call to my uh... to

the house?

No.

Ch.

Do you wish I was?

Yeah.

She loved you_

Mark exits carrying a large gym bag.

Got it, let's go.

Nice to meet you.

You too.

Sam leaves them alone.

I should go.

Youknow, Andrew, the hour will

comeone day when you atop avoiding

allthe people that love you.And

whenit does I sure hope youcome

findme... 'cause I'd love toknow

whoyou are.

He backs away.

You know me enough to know I'd

travel for your funeral right? I

was kidding yesterday; where ever

it was... you know I'd be there

right?

Yes.

He backs away and mounts his bike. Cynthia turns to the

stretcher and quickly uses her thumb to swipe a tear,welling

in her eye.

INT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS/ROUTE 22 --- MORNING

Mark, Sam and Large enter the tacky lobby. Mark carries the

gym bag.

Large and Sam follow Mark down a corridor and into a vending

machine room. He opens a door labeled "Private" into a

kitchen area. They weave through the kitchen down another

hall...

INT. BACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

They arrive at a locked door. Mark knocks.

After a beat it's opened by an Asian teenager with bad acne

blasting his walkman. The far wall is entirely covered with a

blown-up mural of a New Jersey Driver's License used for

making fake ID's. The space where the face would go is

missing, revealing an opening in the wall. They climb

through.

INT. SECRET HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

DURING THE FOLLOWING SCENE, THE CHARACTERS WILL ONLY WHISPER

IN EACH OTHER'S EARS. WE WILL ONLY KNOW WHAT THEY ' RE SAYING

FROM SUBTITLES.

They squeeze down a long dark corridor filled with graffiti.

They come upon a young teen staring through a peep hole in

the wall. Mark taps him on the shoulder. He turns his head

and nods in recognition.

When he pulls away from the peep hole, the LIGHT PROJECTS THE

IMAGE OF THE MOTEL ROOM ON HIS FACE .

(Yes, that really happens.) As he looks at Mark, Sam and

Large, his forehead is filled with the image of a BUSINESS

MAN brushing his teeth. Mark leans into his ear.

Where's Diego?

Down the hall. There's a hooker in

room 112.. It's crazy down there. I

figured I'd just chill with this.

SLOW MOTION: Mark gestures for Large and Sam to follow him

down the hall. The hall is strewn with young men staring

into peep holes. As Mark, Sam and Large pass them, the

Peeping Tom's each turn to see who it is.

As they turn, each one has the image of what they're watching

projected on their face. We hear the ECHOES of the SOUNDS

FROM the ROOMS.

-- An old couple slow dancing projected on another teen.

REGULAR MOTION: They arrive at the end of the hall where a

group of six young guys are glued to the image being

projected onto the wall opposite the peep hole. An old camera

lens has been ducked taped to the peep hole causing the image

to appear in perfect focus.

The projection shows a very hot, YOUNG HOOKER getting taken

from behind by an OLDER GREASEBALL. Her face is no more than

three feet from the peep hole. The HOOKER'S MUFFLED MOANING

can be heard from the other side of the wall.

Everyone's eyes are glued to the wall. Large notices one kid

has duct tape over his mouth, while another is sweating

profusely. Sam's jaw is dropped open.

GRBASESALL (0.5.)

I'm fucking you! I'm fucking you.

Large notices another kid lip-synching along with the

Greaseball. Mark spots DIEGO, a Hispanic guy, 32, wearing a

bell-hop uniform and gestures him closer.

T'sup dog? She's fuckin' hot.

This is the most exciting day of my

life. We've never had anything

close to this.

I've got that Nitrous tank for you,

so can I get that info?

You're gonna have to wait a couple.

The HOOKER MOANS.

GREASEBALL (O.S.)

Who's fuckin' you? Hub? Who's

fuckin' you?

The Lip-Synching Kid mouths, "You are."

Dude we're kind of in a rush.

You can wait, he's about to cunt.

I'm gonna fucking cum!

Diegogestures, "Told you."

Cum on my back!

The group responds in silent shock. Jaws drop, Diego grabs

his hair with his fists. Just as they are about to climax, we

INT. OUTER ROOM --- DAY

Mark, Diego, Large, Sam and others rush out into the outer

room.They speak in quiet whispers.

Wow.

That shit was hot! I got to go drop

some knowledge on that ho.

How do you know she's a hooker?

of course she's a fucking hooker.

Girls that look like her do not

fuck guys that look like him unless

it's for money, coke or fame.

Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.

Who the fuck are you?

Oh, this is Sam and Large.

No offense.

Why are you bringing these people

here?

He's the guy who needs that thing.

Look I brought you the tank, so can

you just tell us where to go now?

Tank come with balloons?

Am I a fucking birthday clown,

Diego? No I don't have balloons.

Suck it off the tap. And I need it

back when you're done; the guy's

holding my thirty-nine bucks.

All right. Hold-up. Who here just

saw some titties?!

They all stare.

Raise your hand if you just saw

some titties?!

They all raise their hands. (Including Sam.)

Thank you. So everybody needs to

calm the fuck down.

we're in a hurry.

All right. You know where Kiernan's

Quarry is?

EXT. KIERNAN'S QUARRY -- LATER

They pull up on the motorcycle.

MARK (V . O . )

Down in Newark, right?

DIEGO (V.0.)

Yeah, its at the bottom of

Hillside and Rivington.

You can't really see it from the

street, but it's there. Park your

car at the gate and hop the fence.

They do.

DIEGO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

At the bottom of the quarry there's

this Junkyard run by this guy named

Albert. lie's the one that tracked

down the piece you're looking for.

I'll call him right now and tell

him to expect you.

Okay, stop. What the fuck are we

doing?

Just be patient.

Dude, we've been patient all day,

but it's my last day in town and

you haven't told me what the fuck

we're doing. I mean if you told me

we were going on a six hour

scavenger hunt for blow I would

have passed.

Blow? Please. If I was gonna give

you coke we'd have gone to the high

school football practice and we'd a

been reeling five hours ago.

Well I think we've corrupted this

innocent girl enough for one

afternoon.

I'm not innocent.

(getting worked up)

Yes, you are. And that's what I

like about you. And I don't want

this fucking guy taking you to the

bottom of a quarry in a sketchy-ass

neighborhood to find some Pitbull's

raping each other or... crack

whore's huffing turpentine or

whatever it is that you have us

Wow. That's the most worked up I've

ever seen you.

He was protecting me.

So.

He likes me.

Don't be cute.

You're my knight in shining armor.

Don't talk about knights in front

of Mark. It's a sore subject.

I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

Pun intended?

Beat as Mark gets it. He comes after him.

You're dead.

They play wrestle as Sam watches.

EXT. KIERNAN'S QUARRY -- MOMENTS LATER

The three of them reach the top of a small hill to reveal...

AN ENORMOUS ABANDONED QUARRY

Colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the

distance like ancient dinosaurs frozen in rust and graffiti.

The center of the quarry goes so deep they can't see the

bottom. They stand on the edge. Rain clouds rapidly drift

overhead. This glace is surreal.

Wow.

I never even knew this was here.

I've heard about it. They were

supposed to build a mall here I

think.

Yeah I remember reading about it in

the paper.

They were digging one day and they

broke through into this like

natural phenomenon. It's like an

underground Grand Canyon or

something. So now they're in some

huge legal battle over whether they

can build here or not.

Can you imagine the guy who's job

it is to fight for the right to

build his mall on some like

geological phenomenon?

They love their mall's here man.

Okay let's just find this guy and

get outta here.

You're not gonna tell us what we're

getting?

It's a surprise, you'll see.

Mark walks on ahead of them down a path that winds down

alongside the abyss.

EXT. 1CTERNIAN'S QUARRY -- LATER

Further down the path. Sam looks to Large. He uses an old mop

handle he's found as a walking stick.

As they continue along the path it begins to get continually

cluttered with rusty junk. An old bedframe, a porcelain tub,

remnants of a "Jungle-Gym", dirty broken toys.

Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a THIRTY

FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that

sits right on the edge of the cliff. It's windows glow warm

and welcoming.

Mark stands in front of the boat. This isn't what he

expected. Rain begins to fall.

I guess this is it.

So... knock. Knock and barter for

"Dessert Storm Trading Cards".

Please don't tease me about my

hobbies. I don't tease you about

being an asshole.

They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat. Mark

steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull.

After a moment, ALBERT, a very gentle looking man in his mid-

thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears

on the deck. He smiles warmly-

(in a whisper)

Mark?

Yeah. Are you Albert?

(with a smile)

Yes. Come on in out of the rain.

Sam and Large look at each other, then follow Mark up an A-

frame ladder that sits next to the hull.

INT. ALBERT'S BOAT -- CONTINUOUS

They step inside and the door closes behind them. It's very

cozy and warm. GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. A wood burning stove heats

the room and throws warm amber light onto a small LIVING ROOM

with deep cushy couches.

You guys must be freezing. Make

yourselves warm by the fire. I'm

just gonna go put her down. I'll be

right out.

The three of them huddle by the fire. They speak in quiet

whispers.

I must say, I've been continually

impressed today with how each new

place you bring us manages to be

weirder and weirder.

What do you mean, this is nice.

ah nothing, just hanging out in an

old boat at the bottom of a quarry

in Newark.

It's hardly the bottom, dude. Did

you see that cliff?

Albert returns with FAYE, an equally gentle and caring

looking woman in her early thirties.

This is my wife, Faye.

Hi. Hello.

Hi. Welcome.

This is Mark and Sam and Large,

right?

Diego told me when he called.

Please have a seat, make yourselves

comfortable.

Its really coming down out there,

huh?

Yeah, it just started pouring all

of a sudden.

Well in a bad storm I like to

pretend this old boat's my own

private "ark". Unfortunately, if

this is the apocalypse, I'm not

quite sure it still floats.

Would any of you like some tea?

I'd love some tea.

Large and Mark look at her.

No thanks.

No.. thanks.

Faye crosses to a small kitchen. They all sit there politely

nodding at each other.

What is it that you do here? What

is this place?

Good question. We're calling it

Kiernan's Fault. And no one's

really quite sure what it is

because they haven't been able to

explore it. They're locked in a

legal battle over who has the

rights to the land.

So one of these days it will either

be a national park or a shopping

mall. But while their locked in

litigation, I was hired to make

sure no one comes inside.

Oh. Wow.

What they don't know is that I'm a

geologist working undercover for

the preservation lobby. So, at

night... I go down.

He's documenting it to support

their case.

Wow. So how deep does it go?

No one really knows. I've been in

the furthest and that was about two

miles down. But I like to pretend

it's infinite.

Faye brings them tea.

It's kind of an odd job isn't it?

Guardian of an infinite abyss?

Yeah, I guess it is. We also trade

and deal in antique jewelry. I

suppose it's pretty odd for you that

we live down here like this-

No.

Not at all.

Never crossed my mind.

But we think it's important.

Why? What do you think you'll find?

I don't know. It's exciting. New

frontiers are hard to come by these

days. I guess I just like the idea

of discovering something.

Doing something completely unique

that no one's ever done before.

Large looks to Sam.

Yeah. "Albert's Abyss".

Who knows? Maybe. But I used to

think that was all that mattered.

No matter what it was, as long as I

could put my name on it. Like it

would somehow justify the fact that

I lived; that I was here. "I did

that. That's mine. I got this plate

on my travels." But you know what?

That's all ego; none of that stuff

really matters. If at the end of

the day I get to be with her, if I

get to be with this person right

here and the baby we created, then

that's all I need. Just having

felt that... If I die in an hour, I

know I've lived.

Faye kisses his forehead.

You know "my whole life I've had

that same anxiety that if I didn't

discover something or... save

something or...

Save something from being

discovered.

Yeah. That I'll have somehow wasted

my time here. And that somewhere,

whatever force created us, would

resent me for it.

Well I think that force would

rather remind you that "breathing's

all it takes to be a miracle".

He takes a deep breath. Large, Sam and mark stare at Albert;

TRANSFIXED. He's like a sage.

GREAT MUSIC BEGINS.

Well i suppose you want what you

came all the way down here for.

Yeah, that would be great.

It took me awhile to track this

piece down. But I owe Diego huge.

He pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to

Mark. Mark looks inside and nods his head.

That's it. Thank you.

They all stand.

Well thank you for the tea.

Yeah, thanks.

Okay, good luck in the rain. Would

you like some garbage bags or

something?

Yeah, that would be great.

EXT ALBERT'S HOUSE BOAT--DAY

They open the door and venture into the, DOWN POUR in their

garbage bag parkas.

Good-bye.

Albert stands with his arm around Faye in their warm doorway.

As the three of them climb down the ladder and head up the

path. Large turns back' around.

(yelling over the rain)

r, Hey Albert l

Yeah?

Good luck exploring the infinite

(with a smile)

Thank you.

EXT. KIERNAN'S QUARRY -- CONTINUOUS

THE GREAT MUSIC CONTINUES

SLOW MOTION: Mark, Sam and Large in black garbage bag rain

parkas head up the incline away from the trailer at half

speed.

Large leads them to an old yellow crane that's rusty arm

hangs out over the 'edge. He climbs up onto it's base.

REGULAR MOTION; Large SCREAMS as loud as he can, with

everything he has, like he's emptying himself into the abyss.

Sam and Mark look up at him and climb up alongside Large to

join hint.

The three of them, in their black parkas, with their hair

drenched against their heads, SCREAM as loud as they can,

with everything they have in the POURING RAIN.

FREEZE FRAME: The three of them smiling. A release. A perfect

moment.

UNFREEZE: Sam locks eyes on Large. He stares back at her.

They kiss. He wraps his hands around the back of her head and

they kiss, in the pouring rain, on the edge of something.

EXT. MARK'S HOUSE -- LATER

The rain has stopped as Large's motorcycle pulls up in front

of Mark's house. mark gets out of the sidecar.

So I don't know if I'm gonna see

you.

I know. Don't you wanna know what's

in the bag?

To be honest, I don't even care

anymore.

Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80

wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a

square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand.

I'd be lying to ya if I told ya

this was my plan all along.

But I got it back. That's got to be

worth something, right?

This whole day was about this?

And anyway you didn't want it down

there with her. It's better for you

to have it.

Large shakes his head; he's shocked. Mark backs away, still

wearing his garbage bag parka.

Hey, if you ever need a Kato, you

know where to find me.

Large sits back down on the bike into Sam's wet arms. He

stares at the pendant in his hand.

What is it?

It's my Mom's favorite necklace.

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. MASTER BATHROOM -- NIGHT

They sit, soaked from the rain in the empty bath tub where

Sarah Largeman drowned,, cross-legged facing each other.

Large wears the necklace around his neck. He plays with the

pendant...

EXTREME CLOSE-UP INSIDE TEE PENDANT: It's an antique game

where you try to get three tiny lead balls to sit in three

separate indentations.

No. I don't want to play this game.

Why not? I'm curious. She's sitting

here, across from you and you can

say anything at all. All the things

you never got a chance to say.

No?

Well I don't want to push you. I

just thought it might help. I mean

isn't that what you came home for?

Re stops playing with the necklace and takes a deep breath.

Okay.

I would...

If she were sitting here.

if my mother were sitting here I

would tell her...

Silence. The faucet DRIPS behind him.

What?

I really don't wanna...

I would tell her that I'm sorry.

I'm sorry that she wasn't happy.

And I'm sorry I couldn't make her

happy. And you know if I could have

had anything I ever wanted to have

happen in my life actually ever

happen, it would have been that she

would be happy. And...

A tiny tear wells in his lid and. spills over.

Oh, my God, Large I think I see

one.

Shut-up.

Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should

save it or something.

She finds a clear plastic cup.

SAM (COUT' D)

Here don't move, I'm gonna get it.

She tries to coerce the- tear off his cheek into the cup, like

a child capturing an inch worm.

I guess I could put it in my

scrapbook, if I had a scrapbook.

They wait.

Is that it?

I think so. I don't feel any more

coming.

Well if you do, let me know and

I'll grab the cup, okay?

Yeah.

This was a good idea. Keep talking.

It's funny; this thing reminds me

of this really random memory of my

mother. Its so weird, I haven't

thought about this in so long, but

this great memory I have where I

was a little kid and I was crying

for one reason or another and she

was kind of holding me and rocking

me back and forth. And I could see

the little balls in this thing just

rolling back and forth. And there

was just snot dripping down my

nose.

And she just handed me her sleeve

and told me to just blow my nose

into it. And I remember thinking,

even as a very little kid, "Wow.

This is love."

More tears start to well and overflow from his eyes. He tries

to stifle them with a LAUGH. He cradles the pendant.

This is love. And it just felt

so... good to be there. So safe.

And I didn't feel safe very often,

but at that moment...

Tears are now streaming down his face as well as Sam's. She

holds the plastic cup in her hand.

oh, Large I'm never gonna be able

to get all these.

They laugh. She moves closer, wrapping her legs around his

waist to hug him close. She kisses his-'wet cheeks.

I'm never gonna be able to get all

these, am I?

It's so funny isn't it? But I

think that's the single most

amazing moment I remember of my

Mother. 'Cause she wasn't sad and

she wasn't being prodded to be

happy, she was just there.

To be your Mom.

He node and tightens his lips; trying to hold in the faucet

that his eyes have become; a monumental release. He almost

looks like a different person. They stare directly into each

other's eyes. He turns away; it's too vulnerable a place for

him.

Look at me.

Look at me.

He does. And we see a vulnerable, lonely, little boy.

(in a whisper)

Let go. Listen to me. Just don't

hang onto any of it anymore. You're

holding on so tight and you just...

you don't have to hang onto any of

it anymore. Just let it all go.

I just don't...

Just let it all go.

He cries with his elbow over his eyes.

What do you feel? Describe it. That

always helps me. My mom always

says, "What's the word that's

burning in your chest..."

She touches his chest with her hand.

What is it?

He looks away. Soared.

Look at me.

He does.

What is it?

(in a whisper)

I would say that it's Love.

It's this Love that I have.

Yeah, it is.

And you've got so much of it in

you... God, you do. You've got so

many years of it in you, pleading

to come out.

This fucking hurts.

I know. But that... that is life.

if nothing else...

(pointing to his chest)

That is life. St's real. And

sometimes it burns. But maybe... it

might be all there is.

Look at you. Look at you. You look

like you just came back to life.

He just stares at her.

who are you?

I'm your new friend, Sam.

Holding up her sleeve.

Tissue?

They both laugh; a release.

Fuck. I feel like I just get so

much thrown at me; like there's so

much speeding by me in a day that I

feel like if I look up from the

sidewalk, I'll get dizzy and fall

down. So it's like I just...

barrel through and don't look up,

so I'll just never fall, you know?

And that's really... and you know

it's so sad to say this, but that's

really how I've been living my

whole life.

Trying to barrel through.

Yeah.

Well it sounds like you were due to

fall.

Yeah.

Yeah I was.

(beat. Then with a laugh.)

Thanks Mom.

(beat, realizing)

That's funny. The definition's

always confused me, but I'm pretty

sure that's irony.

He smiles. He wipes his tears away with his own sleeve .

Come here.

She comes in for a tight embrace. He kisses her gently on her

cheek with his eyes closed, then rests his head on her

- shoulder.

How do you feel?

On Large's face as he thinks about that question.

Safe.

When I'm with you, I feel so

safe... like I'm Rome.

A WIDE SHOT of the bathroom as Sam and Large embrace in the

middle of the empty tub and the faucet continuee to DRIP.

INT. LARGE'S BEDROOM -- LATER

Large's STEREO PLAYS: ("I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over

You" by Colin Ray)

Large and Sam lie naked in each other's arms. She's asleep.

He lies wide awake resting his cheek on top of here.

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES: of Large as he lies awake in different

positions staring at the ceiling; processing. S am turns to

him.

He gets up out of bed and puts his clothes on.

TNT. MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Large stands at the end of the bed staring at Gideon lying

propped up with a book on his cheat, asleep. The EVENING NEWS

is on the TV.

Dad?

He sits up startled.

Oh, hey, hey c'mon in.

He finds his glasses on his chest and lifts the remote to

turn off the TV.

Sorry to wake you.

No, no, it's uh... I was just

reading.

I've been on a pretty crazy little

journey these last couple of days.

You've been avoiding me.

No, I just... maybe I have been.

I'm sure you can find plenty of

things in your life to be angry

about, but what I don't understand

is why you're so angry at me. All I

ever wanted was for everybody to be

happy again, Andrew. That's all I

ever wanted.

But when were we ever all happy,

Dad? I mean you always say that,

but when was that? When was this

time that you have in your mind

that you wish we could all get back

to? 'Cause I don't have it in my

memory. Maybe if I did I could help

steer us back there. But we

should...

You know... you and I need to work

on being okay if that's not in the

cards for us.

Well we might have a shot at it if

you could just forgive yourself for

what you did.

What I did? What I did?! You know

what, Dad? I'm gonna forgive myself

for what I did right now: I was a

little boy and somebody made a

shitty latch. That's what I think

now. And I'm not gonna... I mean

I'm not gonna take all those drugs

anymore. Because they've left me

completely numb. I have felt so

fucking numb to everything I have

experienced in my life. And for

that; I'm here to forgive you.

Gideon site up against the headboard.

You've always said you wanted us to

have whatever it is we wanted.

Well maybe what Mom wanted more

than anything, was for it to all be

over. And for me, what I really

want more than anything, is for it

to be okay with you for me to feel

something again; even if it's pain.

Going against your doctor's

recommendation; that's a pretty

weighty experiment to take on don't

you think?

(with a chuckle)

This is my life, Dad. This is it.

I've spent twenty-six years waiting

for something else to start. So no,

I don't think it's too much to take

on. Because it's everything there

is.

I see now it's all there is.

Perhaps the great tragedy of my

life, will be that you both

deserved more than I knew how to

give?

We deserved nothing more than you.

And you deserved nothing more than

us.

Large puts his hand on the center of his father's bare chest.

You and I are gonna be okay. You

know that, right?

We may not be as happy as you

always hoped we'd be. But for the

first time let's allow ourselves to

be whatever it is that we are...

and that'll be better. OK? I think

that'll be better.

DISSOLVE TO,

INT. NEWARK AIRPORT STAIRCASE -- MORNING

Large sits next to Sam on a staircase between two escalators.

What are you doing?

I don't want to hurt you.

No. Why? How can you... how could

you... What's going on? What

happened? We can figure out the

long distance thing. Don't... this

is a good thing, Large. Don't...

you're gonna be... please don't do

this.

Shestarts crying.

Sam.

You don't realize. This is good.

This doesn't happen often in your

life. We can figure this stuff out.

I wanna help you. We need each

other; I haven't even lied in two

days.

Is that true?

No.

Look at me. Sam, look at me. This

is not over. I'm not putting a

period at the end of this thing.

I'm putting like... an ellipses on

it. Because I'm worried that if i

don't go figure myself out, if I

don't go land on my feet and be

okay on my own, I'm gonna fuck this

up. And I don't want to do that .

This matters too much to me.

He checks his watch.

LARGE (CONT`D)

This isn't a conversation about

this being over. It's about me

needing time to... Look, I just

fired my psychiatrist, I gotta go

out and find a new one.

He stares off. Decision time.

- I gotta go. I'm gonna call you. As

soon as I get there I'm gonna call

you.

She nods; heartbroken.

Look at me.

She doesn't.

LARGE (CONT' t )

Look at me.

She turns.

You've changed my life, Samantha.

And I've known you for four days.

This is the beginning of something

big. But right now I gotta go.

He kisses her on her mouth. As he pulls away she arcs her

head to touch his lips for one more second.

FADE TO BLACK:

ANCHOR (O.S.)

Well Paul is off tonight, but we're

lucky enough to have Ryan Walker

here to tell us about our weather.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gideon sits on the edge of the bed cutting his toe-nails.

He's naked except for white underwear. The SOUND OF WATER

running in the bathroom.

ANCHOR (O.S.)

Ryan, how's it lookin' out there?

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

Gideon?

Gideon doesn't hear the voice as he bends over and tries to

pick each toenail he's cut out of the thick carpet.

RYAN (O.S.)

Thank you, Dan. Well I have some

good news. We are in for some

gorgeous weather coming our way out

of the northwest.

Gideon?

A SCREAM and a BANG from the FEMALE VOICE in the other room!

GIDEON'S FACE as it whips up into frame from his task on the

floor.

FEMALE VOICE (CONT'A)

GIDEON!

SHE SCREAMS AGAIN THROUGH WATER!

He darts up off the floor and races to the open bathroom

doorl He is about to enter and then he's STOPPED ABRUPTLY.

SARAH IS DROWNING. Through the door we see SPLASHES OF WATER

as they land on the bathroom floor.

GIDEON'S FACE. he can't move; fro2en. His mind is racing;

ADRENALINE. We can almost see how fast:his, mind is

processing through his EYES.

The WEATHER REPORT continues low in the background.

GIDE...

And then silence.

GIDEON'S FACE; Wide-eyed in terror.

HIS FINGERS as they slide down off the bathroom door frame.

He backs away slowly to the bed and site down; staring

blankly at the bathroom door. And then he starts to SOB.

Quickly his whole body seems to surrender into it and he

WEEPS hard. His whole back lurches upward with each SOH.

RYAN (O.S.)

So there you have it folks; get out

the picnic baskets, push up those

storm windows, 'cause it appears

that Spring has arrived.

Gideon looks up; lost. His face is covered with tears. He

reaches down to the phone and dials 911.

I need an ambulance.

BLACK.

INT. AIRPORT BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA-- DAY

Sam cries in a phone booth. A KNOCK on the glass spins her

around to see Large. He opens the door.

What are you doing?

Remember that idea I had about

growing and working stuff out on my

own and then finding you when I'd

figured myself out?

The ellipses?

Yeah the ellipses. Its dumb. It's

an awful idea. And I'm not gonna do

it. Because like you said, this is

it. This is life. And I'm in love

with you, Samantha.

(with a laugh)

I think that's the only thing I've

.ever been really sure of in my

whole life. I'm really fucked up

right now, but I don't want to

waste any more of my life without

you in it. Okay?

Yeah.

Because I think I can do this. I

know I can. I want to. We have to.

Yeah?

Tears stream down her face. She smiles her angelic smile.

Okay.

(beat, nodding)

What do we do?

He looks at her and smiles like we've never seen him smile;

ALIVE; AWAKE; CHARGED!

LARGE (CONT - D)

What do we do?

They pause for a moment, staring at each other, transfixed by

adrenaline and spontaneity. Slowly Large leans in and they

kiss amidst an almost desolate baggage claim area.

MUSIC CUE: Radiohead: "Sulk"

As one lone bag circles an empty carousel waiting to be

found.
