[a loud thumping sound resonates throughout the ship]

[the crew look overboard, see bubbles rising up alongside the

ship]

Clear the rudder!

Hard to port!

[a Kraken tentacle silently seizes one crewman while other crewmembers

have their backs turned]

[the Kraken tentacle surfaces in the distance, holding the crewman

who was just seized, he screams]

*Kraken!*

[crewman rings the ship's bell wildly]

###

[music stops, slow motion scene, a huge tentacle rises high over

the ship]

[the tentacle comes down on deck, breaking the ship in two, bouncing

men off the deck]

[slow motion scene, men slide off of tilted deck]

[Will is flung underwater, sees the body of the Kraken in the

distance underwater]

[Will surfaces, climbs aboard a floating board of ship debris]

[the Flying Dutchman comes near Will, Will slides off his board

to swim towards the ship]

[view from the bow of the Flying Dutchman, looking at the floating

debris, including a face-down corpse]

[Elizabeth's wedding dress is also debris, and floats on the

surface of the sea]

[Jones stomps over to Bootstrap]

[the remaining crewmen are simultanenously axed from behind]

[Will witnesses the axing, ducks behind a beam]

[Jones turns around, sensing Will, but sees nothing]

[camera shows Will hitching a ride on the front of the Flying

Dutchman, between the jaw formations]

[Elizabeth's wedding dress is shown underwater, sinking into

the depths of the sea]

Black Pearl

[Elizabeth is sitting on some steps on deck of the Black Pearl]

[Jack walks over to her, holding a bottle of rum]

[Jack offers Elizabeth a drink from his bottle]

[Elizabeth recoils at Jack's breath on the word "now"]

[Jack smells his armpits]

[Jack stares in horror as the black spot boils back into view

on his hand, Elizabeth doesn't notice]

Longboat

[Pintel and Ragetti are rowing a longboat with key members of

the crew inside]

[Jack in the bow, Elizabeth and Norrington are in the back]

[their longboat arrives at the beach, Jack disembarks and begins

to walk off]

[Elizabeth is walking in some sand dunes near the beach, using

the compass]

[Elizabeth sits down on the sand, and sets the compass down on

the sand, the needle points to her]

[they start digging under where Elizabeth was sitting]

[Pintel and Ragetti are by the boat, clowning around, Ragetti

is balancing a shovel on one hand]

[Jones is watching Pintel and Ragetti on the beach through a

spyglass]

[ugly, nondescript crewmember] Down!

[view from the deck of the Flying Dutchman as it submerges, some

underwater footage]

[Pintel and Ragetti are astounded to see the ship submerge in

the distance, Ragetti's balanced shovel falls]

[Pintel and Ragetti run off to warn the others]

###!

[Norrington is digging in the sand, Jack sits in a lotus position

nearby on a sandy slope]

[while digging, Norrington's shovel hits something hard, they

brush off sand to reveal a chest]

[they remove the chest from the sand]

[the chest contains a pearl necklace, documents, and a smaller

chest, among other things]

[Elizabeth opens up a letter with a wax seal, and reads it to

herself]

[they all bend near to put their ears to the small chest, and

they hear a heartbeat]

[Will has unexpectedly appeared on the beach, walking up toward

them]

[Will and Elizabeth kiss]

[Will stoops down with the key to open the chest]

[Jack draws his sword, points it at Will]

[Will backs up slowly, then suddenly draws Elizabeth's sword,

points it at Jack]

[Norrington draws his sword, points it at Will]

[Norrington points his sword at Jack]

Be careful!

[various dueling interjections]

[duel halts for a second]

[duel resumes]

[Elizabeth throws a rock at the duelists, but the rock goes far

to the left of them]

[Pintel and Ragetti giggle and run off to steal the small chest]

[Elizabeth is panting from exasperation and exhaustion]

[Elizabeth pretends to faint, which knocks off her hat]

[Elizabeth watches sideways as the duelists continue fighting,

oblivious to her]

[Elizabeth soon sits up, puts on her hat]

[Pintel & Ragetti run by in the distance behind her, with the

chest]

[Elizabeth sees Pintel & Ragetti, and goes to chase them]

[various duel scenes on the beach]

Bugger!

[Norrington kicks sand in Will's face]

[Norrington runs off to chase Jack up the hill]

[the crew of Flying Dutchman emerge from the shallows]

[one crewmember holds chain shot as a weapon]

[Jack and Norrington run through bushes on the beach, then up

to a dilapidated stone church on the hill] [P2]

[Norrington chases Jack up steps inside the building, Jack kicks

Norrington back down with his foot]

[Jack and Norrington have a swordfight on the inside steps]

[Jack grabs hold of the bell rope, which carries him downward,

and carries Will upward, who just arrived]

[the Flying Dutchman crew on shore are at the large chest and

look up to the ringing bell in the building on the hill]

[while Norrington and Will are dueling on top of the roof, Jack

deftly grabs the dangling key away from Norrington's hand]

[noticing the key gone, Norrington then turns and duels with

Jack]

[soon Norrington knocks Jack's sword from Jack's hand, the sword

is flung onto the ground below]

[Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to

Will]

[Norrington and Will resume their part of the rooftop duel]

[Jack picks up his sword from the ground, and puts the key around

his neck]

[Jack walks through a graveyard, falls into an open grave]

[Jack stands up in the bottom of the hole]

[Norrington backs Will onto the top of the mill's waterwheel]

[the axle of the wheel breaks off with Norrington and Jack dueling

on top]

[Jack is facing the other direction, so is unaware of the freed

wheel rolling behind him]

[the wheel crashes through a small fence, turns, and rolls directly

towards Jack]

[the waterwheel rolls over Jack, and Jack is pulled into the

inside of the wheel]

[the key that Jack had around his neck falls off into the wheel]

[Jack struggles to grab the key, which is caught and dangling

inside the rolling wheel]

[Jack finally grabs the key, but hits his head on a metal bar

inside the wheel, and falls off the wheel]

[Pintel & Ragetti are running off with the small chest, each

holding one side, giggling]

[Elizabeth steps in front Pintel & Ragetti, confronting them,

halts, panting]

[Pintel & Ragetti drop the chest, pull their swords on Elizabeth]

[Elizabeth reaches for her sword, but it's gone]

[Pintel & Ragetti slowly advance on Elizabeth, she slowly retreats

while facing them]

[they all pause for a moment to watch the wheel roll by with

the duel on top]

[Jack is running behind the wheel, trying to catch up and get

the key that is still inside]

[Pintel shrugs, Pintel and Ragetti resume advancing on Elizabeth]

[suddenly a thrown axe embeds itself in a coconut palm next to

Elizabeth]

[all three turn to see Jones' crew crashing through the bushes

toward them]

[swordfight ensues with the Flying Dutchmen crew and Pintel and

Ragetti]

[Norrington and Will continue fighting atop the rolling wheel]

[Jack grabs hold of a palm frond on a coconut palm while at the

top of the wheel]

[the wheel continues on, Jack hangs from the frond, then drops

to the ground]

Sword!

[a sword is thrown to Elizabeth, just in time]

[a sword is thrown to Pintel, just in time]

[a sword is thrown to Ragetti, just in time]

[Jack sees Hadrus running alone through the palms, carrying the

small chest]

[Jack picks up a coconut, whirls it a moment, then throws it

at Hadrus]

[Hadrus' (conch shell) head is knocked off by the coconut]

[Hadrus' head lies on the ground, attempting to give orders to

the rest of his body to find the head]

[Hadrus' headless body walks into a coconut palm]

[Jack unlocks the small chest with the key, square security bolts

suddenly protrude when opened]

[the heart is inside, beating]

[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman approach, Jack tucks the heart

into his vest]

[Elizabeth uses two swords together, one in each hand, to stab

backwards and kill two attacking crewmen]

[Jack is the first to arrive back at the longboat on the beach]

[Jack opens his jar of dirt, dumps out some dirt, puts the heart

in the jar, scoops handfuls of dirt back into the jar]

[a Flying Dutchman crewmember arrives at the boat, Jack fights

him using an oar]

[the swordfight is carried to the beach as the Black Pearl crew

attempts to escape by longboat]

[Norrington arrives at the longboat, while others are fighting

he takes the heart from the jar, puts it under his vest]

[the rolling waterwheel reaches the beach, rolls out into the

shallows, falls on its side]

[Norrington and Will walk away from it, wobbling from dizziness]

[Pintel & Ragetti attempt to escape by longboat, but Will blocks

their progress]

[Pintel & Ragetti reach for their swords, to find their swords

gone]

[Pintel & Ragetti grab a fishnet and oar as weapons against Will]

[Jack fights with Koleniko, using an oar, subdues him]

[Will sees the key in the chest, Jack notices Will looking at

the key and chest]

[Jack hits Will on the head with the our, which knocks him out]

[Norrington takes the chest]

[the remaining Black Pearl crew escape by longboat]

[Hadrus is holding his conch shell head under one arm, the head

speaks to Norrington]

[Norrington pauses, looks around]

[Norrington flees, Hadrus drops his head onto the ground when

catching the chest]

[Hadrus' crewmates laugh and walk off with Hadrus' body, ignoring

Hadrus' head]

[the face inside Hadrus' head turns around, turns into a hermit

crab, extends its legs]

[the hermit crab head crawls after its departing body and crew]

Black Pearl

[Will, lying flat on the deck, head over a grate, returns to

consciousness aboard the Black Pearl]

[the Flying Dutchman suddenly surfaces alongside them]

[Jack falls down the stairs of the Pearl, crew says "Ooh!"]

[Jack stands up, struts across the deck, holding his jar of dirt]

[the Flying Dutchman's cannon covers slide down, cannons emerge

from the holes]

?Fire!

[a heavy cannonade fires from the Flying Dutchman, blowing large

holes in the Black Pearl]

[Pintel and Ragetti look through the gaping hole in the stern,

see the Flying Dutchman following them]

[cage-faced crewmember] Aye, Captain.

[triple-barreled cannon fires, barrel rotates after each blast]

...

Come on, ###!

?We giving up, Sir?

[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman are whipped to raise the Kraken

calling device]

BLACK PEARL

[crew cheers]

[suddenly the Black Pearl is badly jarred]

[Jack's jar of dirt falls to the deck, breaks open, spills all

the dirt]

[Jack runs down to the spilled dirt, searches frantically for

the heart, which is gone]

We must've hit the reef!

[with a deep rumbling sound, the Kraken's tentacles slowly crawl

up the hull]

[the tentacles rise higher]

[the tentacles start feeling around the ship]

[the crew fire the cannons, hitting the tentacles and nearly

severing some]

[the Kraken sinks into the sea, some tentacles glowing from the

blast]

[the crew cheers]

[Will sees the wrecked boats, then sets his eyes on the barrels

of gunpowder]

[hands Elizabeth a long gun]

[the crew is busy loading barrels of gunpowder from the hold]

We are short stocked on gunpowder. Six ?barrel/?below.

Bring it up!

[Gibbs seems shocked, then turns to see the entire crew halted,

staring at him in shocked silence]

[the crew continues loading]

[aerial view approaching Black Pearl, zooming through the rigging

to the other side]

[Jack is in a rowboat alone, rowing away from the Black Pearl]

[Jack stops rowing, sees the Kraken with tentacles around Black

Pearl in the distance]

[Jack looks back into the direction he's headed, then consults

his Compass]

[Elizabeth runs to the railing, sees Jack rowing away]

[another heavy thud hits the ship, crewmen shout]

[the Kraken attacks again]

...

[Pintel & Ragetti stand to one side of a cannon port as a tentacle

pulls one crewmember through sideways]

...

[Will hangs onto the side of the net of gunpowder barrels, attempting

to attract the Kraken's attention]

[Will slashes at tentacles with his sword]

[Elizabeth hesitates, waiting for Will to fall free]

[one of the Kraken's tentacles wrap around her leg and drag her

backwards, she screams]

[Ragetti chops off the end of the tentacle holding Elizabeth]

[Another crewmember picks up the rifle and attempts to shoot,

only to be grabbed by the Kraken and flung around]

[the rifle drops onto the deck above Elizabeth]

[Elizabeth tries to pick up the fallen rifle, but someone's foot

holds it down]

[she sees that it's Jack's foot, that he has returned to the

Pearl]

[Jack picks up the rifle and takes aim at the gunpowder]

[slow motion scene of Jack firing a ball into the gunpowder]

[ball whistles through the air, strikes the gunpowder, which

explodes]

[the Kraken releases its hold, burned tentacles withdraw into

the ocean, groaning sound]

[the crew get ready to leave the Pearl, loading supplies and

guns]

[Elizabeth approaches Jack]

[Elizabeth passionately kisses Jack]

[Will sees the kiss from the longboat, falters]

[the kiss is inturrupted by the sound of shackles, Elizabeth

has chained Jack to the main mast]

[Elizabeth leans in as if to kiss him again.]

[Elizabeth leaves Jack and climbs down into the long boat]

[the crew look uncertain]

[the longboat casts off]

[Jack struggles with his manacles]

[a coconut and cannonball roll by, on the tilted deck]

[Jack spots a fallen lantern, picks it up with the tip of his

sword]

[Jack breaks the lantern against the mast, pours oil over his

wrists]

[Jack struggles with slipping his hand out]

[Jack finally manages to slip his hands out]

[the Kraken rises up behind him]

[Jack halts, turns around, faces the Kraken]

[music and sound stop momentarily]

[the Kraken roars, spraying Jack with slime and flinging his

earlier-eaten hat to the deck]

[Jack spots his old hat lying next to his feet]

[Jack spots his hat, picks it up, puts it on, wipes slime from

his face]

[slow motion scene of Jack boldy charging toward the Kraken's

mouth, sword drawn] [Q3]

[downwards view, showing that the chest is empty, Jones tilts

his head back and shouts]

[Mercer drops the Letters of Marque on Beckett's desk]

[Beckett opens the letter to look at it before looking up at

Norrington, who has been standing in the office]

[from his desk, Beckett beckons Norrington with two fingers]

[the remaining crew paddles through the waters to Tia Dalma's

shack]

[many natives stand in the waters surrounding the shack, holding

candles, mourning Jack Sparrow]

[inside the shack, Will absent-mindedly keeps throwing his father's

knife into the table top]

[Tia carries a tray around to all of them, offers the mugs to

Elizabeth]

[Elizabeth takes a mug but doesn't drink]

and snarls]
