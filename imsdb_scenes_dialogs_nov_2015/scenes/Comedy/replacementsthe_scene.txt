1999

EXT. MARINA DEL REY HARBOR - DAY

We're BUZZING around the harbor with Shane in

an old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY.

Shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood

to his wet suit so that only the white, pasty

oblong of his face is visible.

It's still raining as he steers the little

boat around the sailboats and yachts.

He pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTS

the ENGINE.

With practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to

the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a

bill for services rendered on the sailboat's

stern line.

He slips on a weight belt,    puts on a pair of

old gaffer taped goggles,    jams the end of a

air-hose in his mouth, and    falls backward out

of the dinghy and into the    water.

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

It's dark, dirty and murky. Suddenly, Shane

floats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a long

spatula.

ANOTHER ANGLE

He attacks the underside of the sailboat

which is covered with green algae muck that

hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat.

The spatula scrapes away the green mess

revealing the pure white underside of the

boat.

CLOSE ON SHANE

As he scrapes. Muck from the boat floats

past him. This doesn't look like fun.

As he works, he happens to look down and

notices something on the bottom.

SHANE'S POV

Amidst the beer cans and other trash,

something golden is sitting on the bottom.

BACK TO SCENE

Shane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it

go and drifts down.

A shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky

water and reveals a broken trophy half-buried

in the mud. Shane kneels over it and picks

it up.

The trophy is almost a full-size football

rendered in bronze attached to a broken base.

Shane turns "the ball" over in his hands. He

grips the seams like he's done this before.

Then he holds the football out in front of

him.

Suddenly, he starts barking garbled signals

to an imaginary offense. He turns to his

running back as he yells something like "Blue

31!" It comes out in bubbles

He cocks his left leg and his wide receiver

goes in motion.

Then on the "snap" he turns and starts a five

step drop.

He moves in slow motion because hey... he's

underwater! He executes a perfect play

action fake on the third step of his drop,

and looks "down field" for his receivers.

But there's a blitz! He steps up in the

pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes

his head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weaves

in a kind of delicate ballet.

He rolls left and keeps looking for the open

man.

Suddenly he points down field, pulls up and

cocks his arm.

The "ball" comes behind his ear and snaps

forward in a perfect release.

D.C.) -

EXT. SIDELINES - DAY

Redskin quarterback EDDIE MARTEL is

conferring with Redskin head coach BUD TILDON

near the bench. Madden and Summerall

continue OVER.

We MOVE TO veteran Redskin center REESE

EVANS, 38, standing on the sidelines, uniform

totally clean.

He looks near tears.

ON REDSKINETTES

Twelve striking-looking women dressed in

burgundy and gold are doing some inane

chatter to a section of fans that ignore

them.

The girls are led by pretty ANNABELLE

FARRELL, a bundle of manic energy inside a

body from heaven.

ON MARTEL

The Redskin quarterback moves to the huddle.

The huddle breaks and Martel sets up over the

center.

The ball is snapped and Martel drops back.

He looks for a receiver and doesn't see

anybody.

He steps up in the pocket, sees an opening

and takes off running down field.

Martel is a pretty good broken field runner

for a big guy. Plus with the defense

covering every possible receiver, he's got a

lot of daylight.

Nobody has touched him as he crosses the

fifteen. Suddenly, a safety, smaller than

Martel, looms in front of him at the ten.

Martel goes down in one of those wimpy

quarterback slides before the safety can even

hit him.

BANG!   The GUN sounds and the game is over.

ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

They look at each other in disbelief

ON THREE REDSKIN FANS

We'll see these guys throughout. They're

typical low level Washington bureaucrats

named TODD, ROD and BOB who live for the Hogs

-- the traditional name for the Redskin

offensive linemen.

Todd is shirtless and his entire upper body

is painted Redskin red.

At that moment, they are livid with their

quarterback and Bob is speaking for them all.

ON ANNABELLE

Behind her, the rest of the cheerleaders are

already walking away. Annabelle looks at

Quarterback Martel with pure disgust as he

walks off the field.

INT. LARGE BEDROOM - DAY

The room's blinds are pulled tightly against

the bright sunlight. Only the blue light of

a TV illuminates anything.

Suddenly, we hear an old man in the bed give

out with a loud piercing wail.

The door to the room bangs open and an

English male nurse named AUGUSTINE RIPLEY,

dressed in white, comes running in. He's

carrying a syringe in each hand, poised at

the ready.

He runs to the bed of    the still wailing

EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL    (75). O'Neil is hooked

up to an oxygen tank,    watching the just

completed Redskin game    with the sound off.

O'Neil continues to wail.

He puts one needle down and jabs O'Neil with

the other one.

He murmurs to the old man as he injects him.

He finishes.

He reaches for the phone and hits the speed

dial.

He hands the phone to O'Neil.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. TILDON'S OFFICE

Coach Tildon sitting in his office. We can

hear players getting dressed, listening to

MUSIC and getting SHOWERS outside his open

door.

O'Neil throws the phone down. Augustine

picks it up and then cranks up the oxygen a

notch.

O'Neil takes big gulps of the rich air.

O'Neil sucks hard on the oxygen.

INT. REDSKINS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

A REPORTER is interviewing WILSON JONES, the

huge defensive end for the Redskins. Wilson

wears an enormous diamond earring.

Wilson is dressing at his locker.

Wilson holds his arms out.   Yes, he's

gigantic.

Somebody turns UP a TV in the locker room.

ON TV

A handsome ex-player named Jerome Lindell

steps up to a podium at a press conference.

He's wearing a two thousand dollar suit.

On the TV he is identified with a super:

"JEROME LINDELL -- President -- National

Football League Players' Association."

The entire locker room is silent for a beat.

And then everyone starts getting dressed

again, maybe a little slower than before.

ON WILSON JONES

INT. O'NEIL'S BEDROOM - CLOSE ON O'NEIL - NIGHT

As he sleeps peacefully.    The only sound is

the HISS of his OXYGEN.

Then we hear ICE CUBES SLOSHING in a glass.

O'Neil opens his eyes and sees:

JIMMY McGINTY, a handsome devil in his late

sixties, wearing golf clothes and sipping the

last dregs of a Scotch rocks.

O'Neil motions to the glass. Jimmy pours

three fingers from a Glenlivet bottle and

hands it to him.

O'Neil removes his oxygen to sip his whiskey.

He smiles as it goes down.

McGinty nods.

O'Neil sips his whiskey and calms down.

McGinty pours more Scotch and looks into the

glass.

O'Neil smiles.

INT. REDSKINS' HEAD COACH'S OFFICE - DAY

McGinty is sitting behind the empty desk as

his two main coaches give him a presentation.

They are offensive coordinator LEO

PILACHOWSKI and defensive coordinator

CHRISTOPHER BANES.

Both coaches laugh nervously.     McGinty

doesn't say anything.

McGinty takes out a piece of paper of his own

with a bunch of names on it.

McGinty looks up when he senses someone

standing in the doorway. It's REESE EVANS,

the veteran Redskin we saw standing on the

sidelines with the clean uniform.

McGinty nods to Pilachowski. The coach takes

a marker and fills in "Evans" in the center

circle.

INT. METHAMPHETAMINE LAB - DAY

A bunch of BIKER types are cooking up a vat

of speed. These guys are big, and

badasslooking.

After a beat, one of the Bikers looks up at

the door.

The other biker shakes his head, no.

The one who asked the question walks over to

the door and listens for a beat. Nothing.

He turns to go back and suddenly the door

disintegrates in front of a charging man

wearing a "police" windbreaker.

This is DANIEL    BATEMAN, a big,    young,

psychotic cop,    who immediately    runs over the

poor Biker who    was listening at    the door,

kicking the guy    in the head as    he goes by.

Bateman dives on two more Bikers, and

viciously head-butts one of them.

He stuffs the other's head into the meth

mixture, pulls him out and clubs him with a

big police blackjack, three quick times:

Rap! Rap! Rap!

The guy goes down like lead.

Bateman looks around and spots a big BIKER

cowering in a corner. The Biker is

terrified.

Bateman takes two stops toward the guy when

suddenly three more COPS wearing windbreakers

run in, out of breath.

They look around at the unconscious Bikers.

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Someone's BEEPER is

going off. The three cops look at theirs.

Nothing.

The cowering Biker looks at his.

Bateman pulls his beeper, studies it and

looks puzzled.

INT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

A loaf of Wonder Bread is spinning through

the air in SLOW MOTION. It comes AT us,

twisting and turning.

ON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

He's tall, maybe 22, and positioned behind

the cash register. He's wearing a Washington

Redskins sweatshirt.

Clifford's hands are up as he waits to catch

the bread which was tossed by his MANAGER at

the back of the store.

The loaf hits Clifford's hands and then

bounces out. It lands on the counter in

front of a TEN-YEAR-OLD smart-ass KID.

Clifford grabs the Kid's two one-dollar

bills, and makes change for the bread.

The Kid leaves.

The Manager yells from the back of the store

as he holds up a portable phone.

Clifford collapses.

INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

We hear deafening APPLAUSE as we hold on

ANDRE and JAMAL WILLIAMS, two huge

bodyguards, dressed in identical black suits.

Suddenly,   the artist formerly known as Prince

comes off   stage, grabs a towel from an

assistant   and starts walking with Jamal in

front and   Andre in the rear.

As they walk, a CELL PHONE RINGS. Andre

pulls it from his pocket and answers it,

quietly.

Jamal runs interference with the techies and

groupies backstage.

As they walk, Andre is still talking on the

phone.

Finally, they get to the backstage door and

stop. The rock star prepares to run the

gauntlet of adoring fans behind his trusty

bodyguards.

But his bodyguards are conversing quietly but

urgently with each other.

One of the assistants throws open the door.

A big mob waits outside.

The anointed one turns to his bodyguards to

lead the way, but... they're gone!

The mob surges. The artist formerly known as

Prince screams as he's trampled to death by

his fans.

EXT. MARINA DEL REY - DAY

Shane Falco, wearing his patched wetsuit,

climbs out of his inflatable dinghy and flops

onto the deck of his cabin cruiser.

He looks cold and tired.

Shane jumps.

McGinty is sitting in an old deck chair on

the stern of the boat.

Shane studies his visitor.

He offers Shane an elegant flask.   Shane

takes it and drinks.

McGinty drinks from his flask.

There's a beat as Shane looks away.

Shane doesn't meet McGinty's eyes.

Shane keeps staring out at the water.

McGinty points to the boats in the harbor.

EXT. QUEENS (NEW YORK) - DAY

We're right off Queens Boulevard on a busy

side street where LOU PACIFICO, 30, is taking

book. Lou is short, dark and handsome.

He leans against the wall of a liquor store.

Lou writes quickly on a small pad.

After a beat, another passerby leans in and

whispers something to Lou. Lou writes

quickly again.

>From across the street an old woman sticks

her head out of a four-story walk-up. This

is LOU'S MOTHER who speaks with a heavy

Italian accent.

People in the street are now starting to look

up at this old woman screaming "Foreskins!"

Louis quickly crosses the street to his

apartment house.

But at that moment, a soccer ball bounces

toward him from where a group of kids are

playing in an alley.

Out of pure instinct, Lou gives it a mighty

boot.

We FOLLOW the arc of the ball as it sails

DOWN the block. Everyone stops to admire the

kick.

Still airborne, the ball crosses Queens

Boulevard.

At that moment, a very old mafioso type is

being helped from his limo by several

lieutenants.

Pow! The ball hits the old guy right in the

back of the head, knocking off his porkpie

hat and dropping him to the pavement like a

bullet.

The lieutenants pull pistols and surround

their fallen leader.

ON LOU

He sees what happens and quickly ducks into

his apartment house.

ON ONE MAFIA LIEUTENANT

He spots Lou before he disappears inside.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

Coach ROLAND LAMONT, a good-looking ex-

running back in his late twenties, is

coaching a high school player.

We can see that Roland is wearing a pretty

substantial knee brace.

He holds up a football.

He pitches the ball out to one kid, who runs

right at him, steps on Roland's foot with his

cleats and then cuts around him.

Roland screams and falls to the ground.

He writhes there a beat until he hears:

Roland holds his foot and manages a smile

because he seems to know what the phone call

means.

EXT. BIG O (WASHINGTON D.C.) - MAGIC HOUR

The stadium appears empty.

Suddenly, a football thrown with a perfect

spiral comes AT us.

REVERSE ANGLE

We see the ball sail cleanly through a rubber

ring attached to the crossbar on the

goalpost.

ON SHANE FALCO

He's in shorts and a sweatshirt taking snaps

from center Reese Evans.

Evans bends over another ball.    Shane sets up

in the shotgun.

EXT. STANDS - MAGIC HOUR

McGinty is sitting with O'Neil on the fifty

yard line twenty rows back.

Augustine holds O'Neil's oxygen tank as the

old man sits huddled in a coat that's way too

big for him.

O'Neil motions to Augustine for more oxygen.

He turns the valve up.   O'Neil breathes

deeply.

ON SHANE

He drills a perfect spiral through the

circle.

EXT. BIG O - MORNING

A ramp at the rear of the stadium gives

vehicle access to the interior. The bottom

of this ramp is now a maelstrom of activity.

The regular Washington Redskins are in a

picket line walking in circles. The players

are dressed in everything from fur coats to

expensive leather jackets and leather pants.

Half of them are on cell phones.

We can see some of their cars parked

haphazardly nearby: BMWs, Porsches,

Mercedes, etc.

Jerome Lindell, the president of the

Players' Association, is being interviewed on

camera by a REPORTER.

The picketers start shouting and pointing.

A bus slowly makes its way towards the ramp

and the picketers.

INT. BUS - MORNING

Shane is sitting in the first seat with Reese

Evans (center).

We MOVE BEHIND them and see, among others,

Daniel Bateman (psychotic cop), Clifford

Franklin (can't catch a loaf of bread), Jamal

and Andre Williams (ex-bodyguards), Lou

Pacifico (kicker and bookmaker), and Roland

Lamont (ex-high school coach).

BANG! EGGS start HITTING the bus WINDOWS.

We can hear the regular players chanting:

ON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

He's very excited as he looks out the window

at the striking players. Roland Lamont sits

next to him.

ON WILSON

His big face looms right outside the bus

window. He looks pissed off and scary.

ON LOU PACIFICO

He leans across his seat to Shane.

Shane shakes his hand.

ON JAMAL

He's looking out the window when an eeg

splats against it. He turns to his brother

Andre:

Jamal reaches into his jacket and starts to

pull out a nine-millimeter pistol.

Andre stops him.

INT. BOWELS OF STADIUM - DAY

A nondescript van pulls up and a muscled,

deadly-looking guy in handcuffs and jail

issue clothes gets out. This is bearded

safety EARL (he-ain't-no-girl) WILKINSON.

A Maryland state trooper unlocks the cuffs.

Earl looks... hungry.

EXT. STADIUM - DAY

The replacements are getting off the bus as

the players chant.

When Reese Evans (former Redskin center) gets

off the bus, the players go wild.

Reese coolly gives them the international

suck my dick sign.

Clifford gets off behind him. He waves and

smiles at the striking players.

They throw rotten fruit at Clifford in

return.

INT. EQUIPMENT ROOM - DAY

SID, an oldtimer equipment man folds towels.

Behind him, we can see helmets, pads, etc.

McGinty walks up dragging Shane who is fully

dressed in a uniform, including helmet.

McGinty points to the intricate face guard on

Shane's helmet.

It's an exaggerated version of a lineman's

cage with so much metal criss-crossing that

you can hardly see Shane's face.

McGinty holds up three fingers.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Andre and Jamal are hitting the blocking sled

simultaneously. They drive it OUT OF FRAME.

ON SHANE

He's now wearing a helmet with a twobar

quarterback face guard. He takes a snap and

pitches out to running back Roland Lamont.

Roland, now wearing a big knee brace, looks

sharp as he cuts to the outside.

ON PILACHOWSKI

The offensive coordinator is standing with

McGinty who is concentrating on the

scrimmage. Suddenly, Pilachowski spots

someone. His mouth drops open.

ON MICKEY LEE

He's a fourhundred-fifty-pound ex-Sumo

wrestler crammed into a Redskin uniform.     Fat

rolls are visible everywhere.

Lee walks up. McGinty bows and says

something in Japanese. Lee bows and answers

back in Japanese. Then they shake hands.

Lee puts on his helmet, pulls his ponytail

out the back and rumbles away.

Pilachowski is looking at McGinty like he's

crazy.

Defensive coordinator Christopher Banes comes

running up in a lather.

He looks across the field at a big, good-

looking kid named BRIAN MURRAY who is in the

middle of a pass rushing drill.

Murray looks really fast, especially for his

size.

McGinty thinks this is funny as shit.

ON SHANE

He's just done a fivestop drop on a pass

play. He's looking down field when he sees

something scary.

He throws the ball away and then is nailed

and taken down on his back by Bateman

(psychotic cop).

Shane groans and lies there with Bateman on

top of him.

McGinty pulls Bateman up.

Danny runs off.

McGinty helps Shane up.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Shane is sucking down water from the portable

water cart when head cheerleader Annabelle

Farrell walks up. She's dressed in tight

workout clothes.

Shane is really not sure.

Shane nods.   She walks away.

We watch her world-class ass move across the

gridiron.

ON McGINTY AND CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

McGinty is holding a ball and talking to his

wide receiver.

He shoves the football in Clifford's hands.

McGinty starts to walk away.

McGinty thinks about that.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Andre and Jamal are just about dressed.

Andre helps Jamal on with his jacket.     Jamal

then helps Andre on with his.

ON SHANE

He's stripped down sitting on a bench.

Reporters are trying to interview him.

Microphones are in his face and video cameras

jockey for position.

ON MICKEY LEE AND ROLAND LAMONT

Mickey is watching Roland unbuckle his big

complicated knee brace. (NOTE: There should

be something slightly medieval about this

brace.)

Roland takes out a wrench and starts

unscrewing a bolt on his brace.

ON EARL WILKINSON (CRIMINAL)

He's standing naked in front of his locker

staring with anticipation at a garment bag.

Slowly, he unzips the bag revealing a

beautiful new suit. He touches the lapels

reverently.

ON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

He's sitting in front of a locker, holding

his football, with a shit-assed-eating grin.

Someone walks by.

He drops his ball and quickly picks it up

again. He looks around to make sure Coach

didn't see him.

EXT. BIG O PARKING LOT - MORNING

The regular Redskins are out in force,

holding signs as they lean on their Beamers

and Porsches.

Shane pulls up in a battered '89 Honda.

When he gets out, he's immediately surrounded

by six striking regulars, led by quarterback

Eddie Martel and defensive end Wilson Jones.

Shane looks but it's obvious he's parked

legally.

Wilson motions to another big guy. The two

of them proceed to roll the Honda over on its

roof. It lands with a crunch.

Everybody turns to see Andre and Jamal

walking towards them.

All the regulars laugh at this.

Jamal points to a gorgeous midnight blue

Porsche.

Before Wilson can even answer, Jamal pulls

his NINE MILLIMETER. BOOM! BOOM! No more

Porsche windshield.

All the regular Redskins dive for cover.

Jamal raises his GUN again.    POW!   No Porsche

driver's side window.

He turns to his cowering teammates.

The guys quickly pick up the Honda and put it

right side up.

Jamal spins the nine and holsters it.

Andre and Jamal get on either side of Shane.

They look at each other and then quickly

switch sides.

Shane smiles at his guards, smiles at the

still-shocked Redskins, and they move out.

INT. LOCKER ROOM BATHROOM - DAY

Shane, dressed in pads and pants, opens the

door and walks in. During the opening and

closing of the door we hear:

Shane stands in front of the urinal and goes

through the painstaking process of locating

his dick.

First he wrestles open his football pants and

then has to deal with the cup, etc.

Next to him, at another urinal, is WALTER

COCHRAN, a big, serious bornagain tackle.

As he pisses, Walter has his Bible propped

open behind the flush handle so he won't miss

a minute of scripture.

Shane nods.   Walter pees for a beat.

By now Shane is pissing too.

Walter takes his hand off his whizzing member

and holds it out to Shane.

Shane looks at Walter's hand for a long time,

but finally, he removes his own guiding hand

and clasps Walter's hand tentatively.

REVERSE ANGLE

They continue pissing as they hold hands.

EXT. McGINTY'S HOUSE - DAY

A barbecue is in progress for the new

Washington Redskins at the beautiful home of

Coach McGinty.

The huge back yard features a pool and a

catered buffet/barbecue.

Andre and Jamal are loading down their

plates.

Mickey Lee is gnawing on a two-foot slab of

ribs.

Lou Pacifico has a little three card monty

going at a picnic table.

Coach    McGinty is holding up a beautiful baby

girl    to the admiring players. He kisses the

baby    and then hands the child to his gorgeous

young    wife.

Augustine is pushing Mister    O'Neil in a

wheelchair. They pass the     outside bar and

O'Neil suddenly lunges for    a bottle of

tequila. Augustine has to     rip it out of his

hands.

Coach Banes and Earl Wilkinson (criminal) are

talking to a distinguished-looking big man in

his fifties. This is a D.C. CIRCUIT COURT

JUDGE.

Wilkinson is smiling but he looks dangerous.

There's an evil glint in Wilkinson's eye.

INT. McGINTY'S HOUSE - DAY

Shane is standing alone in a large hallway

looking at an enormous trophy case stuffed

with the spoils of football.

Shane turns and sees her.    She's as fetching

as ever.

Shane has to actually smile at this.

Annabelle laughs.

Shane is totally taken off guard by this

woman.

Shane waves uncertainly and walks away.

EXT. McGINTY'S BACK YARD - DAY

The Judge (now with his jacket off) and

Wilkinson are lined up across from each other

in a three-point stance in something called a

man maker drill.

The entire team forms two lanes on either

side of them, as they face off.

The idea is to knock the other guy down and

get by him.

Someone says hut! And Wilkinson slams into

the Republican 16th Circuit Court Judge and

knocks him head over heels.

The Judge lands on his back, wham!   He's out

cold.

Wilkinson slaps hands with Andre and Jamal.

EXT. BIG O STADIUM - DAY

It's another beautiful fall afternoon and

cars are entering the stadium parking lot.

At one of the entrances, the striking

Redskins are picketing. Jerome Lindell (NFL

Players President) is still marching with

them.

A little boy stops one of the Redskins and

asks for an autograph on a program. The

player gives it to him and the kid walks

away.

Lindell runs after the kid, grabs the program

and rips off the page the player signed.

The kid retreats quickly.    Lindell rips up

the page.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

It's very quiet. Shane sits in pads and no

jersey, methodically squeezing a football.

Reese Evans, his center, stops by.

Shane nods and gives a nauseous-looking

smile.

Shane nods that he understands but he goes

back to staring at a wall.

Andre and Jamal sit facing each other. Andre

throws a vicious forearm at Jamal's head but

Jamal catches it. They both nod in approval.

Lou Pacifico smokes and stares.

Bateman is leaning against a wall, fully

dressed, helmet on. He's staring into space

and smiling to himself. He looks terrifying.

Earl Wilkinson (the criminal) is polishing a

beautiful pair of new alligator shoes.

Clifford Franklin looks at himself in the

mirror as he ceremoniously puts on his

helmet.

Walter Cochran is reading his Bible in front

of his locker, which features a picture of

Jesus and a cross.

Mickey Lee (ex-sumo) is sitting in front of a

bowl of hard boiled eggs. He's methodically

popping them into his mouth. He eats four as

we watch.

Coach Pilachowski comes up to Lee and watches

him eat.

Like a hole in the head he needs the bulk.

Coach McGinty comes strolling through the

locker room, the picture of calm.

He walks by defensive end/tight end Brian

Murray and signs to him to have a good game.

Murray signs back, "Thanks, Coach."

Cochran spots McGinty and puts down his

Bible.

McGinty turns and bums an egg from Mickey and

walks to the middle of the locker room.

He eats the egg as he turns slowly and takes

in his players.

He walks away.   The players get up and start

moving.

EXT. BIG O - DAY

We're FOCUSED ON an enormous,    plastic blow-up

Washington Redskin helmet that    bobs on the

ground in front of the exit to    the field.

The idea is, the players will    run into and

then out of the helmet as they    are

introduced.

Annabelle and her fellow twenty cheerleaders

are lined up on either side of the bobbing

helmet, waiting for the players.

ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

They are in their booth, vamping ON CAMERA.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Shane is looking out at the field through the

blow-up helmet. He looks scared.

Suddenly, a CANNON goes off with a stomach-

resounding BOOM! Shane jumps.

IN STANDS

A sparse crowd is in attendance, mostly

diehard fans like Todd, Rod and Bob, who are

decked out in burgundy and gold. They look

drunk already as they cheer like mad.

INT. TUNNEL

Bateman is first in line.    He looks like a

racehorse on cocaine.

Bateman takes off at a dead run out of the

tunnel and into the helmet.

ON HIS FOOT

It hits a wire stretched across the ground

inside the helmet.

ON BATEMAN

He trips big-time into the side of the

helmet. He bounces (it's inflated,

remember?) to the other side, bounces again

and is shot out of the front of it like a

cannon ball.

ON CHEERLEADERS

Bateman bounces out of the helmet and takes

out the first six cheerleaders.

Girls fly left and right.       One girl is

knocked out of her shoes.

ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

Madden covers his face.     Summerall looks

pained.

IN STANDS

Even the hardcore Todd, Rob and Bob can

hardly look at the carnage.

OUTSIDE STANDS

A contingent of strike players like Eddie

Martel and Wilson Jones huddle in the parking

lot. They are laughing their asses off as

they watch on a personal TV.

ON FIELD

Cheerleaders are down and screaming in pain.

Annabelle is running from girl to girl, doing

triage.

ON BATEMAN

He's sheepishly standing to one side as

trainers come out to assist.

INT. BLOWUP HELMET

Jamal and Shane are examining the trip wire.

Obviously, they were sabotaged.

The rest of the team walks unceremoniously

out of the helmet and onto the field.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

BOOM! The Patriot kicker puts one in the end

zone for a touchback.

The ball is placed on the twenty as Shane and

the offense walk out onto the field.

Shane walks slowly toward the huddle that's

forming.

IN HUDDLE

Andre and Mickey Lee are arguing.

ON SHANE

As he walks, we hear McGinty's voice in

Shane's helmet. Yes, they do it by one-way

helmet radio so the filtered voice you hear

is McGinty, speaking into his headset mike.

Shane walks into the huddle and chaos.

Andre and Lee ignore Shane and start pushing

each other.

Now Jamal gets involved as Shane tries to get

between them.

ON REF

He's watching the play clock and when it gets

to zero he pulls his penalty flag and throws

it.

IN HUDDLE

Lee suddenly punches Andre through his face

guard. Andre knocks into Shane and spins him

around. Jamal then goes to punch Lee, he

misses and nails Shane in the back of the

helmet.

Shane goes down hard.

ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

They look confused.

ON FIELD

Trainers race out to Shane, who is lying face

up with the huddle standing over him.

Shane sits up.   Suddenly, he remembers what

happened.

Shane gets to his feet.

Everybody leans in.

Lee raises his hand.   Shane grits his teeth

and nods.

Jamal raises his hand.

We do hear a WHISTLE.        A penalty flag flies

by.

Shane throws ups his hands.

ON McGINTY

He's talking into his mike.

ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

ON O'NEIL

He's in bed sucking oxygen watching the game.

Augustine sits with him.

ON REDSKIN HUDDLE

It breaks this time and everyone runs to the

line of scrimmage.

On the snap, Shane turns to head off to

Lamont but instead runs right into Jamal who

knocks him down.

Shane looks up at Jamal.

IN HUDDLE

Shane leans in.

They break and Shane lines up over his

center.

On the snap, Shane hands to Lamont who sweeps

left, cuts inside and picks up eight yards.

Shane is ecstatic.

And then a penalty flag flies by.

Shane looks at Jamal who is trying

desperately to hide his number.

Shane leans in with the next play. Cochran,

playing right tackle, can't resist.

They break and come to the line of scrimmage.

Shane does a play action fake to Lamont and

then turns downfield.

Wham! He's buried by three defenders. The

ball squirts loose and the Patriots recover.

ON PILACHOWSKI

He's livid on the sidelines. As his

offensive line comes off he rants at them.

Shane hobbles off past:

The defense rushing onto the field led by

Bateman.

ON PATRIOTS

They break their huddle and come to the line

of scrimmage. Bateman is snorting fire.

Earl Wilkinson (with SMITH on the back of his

jersey) patrols the secondary and calls out

the formation.

The PATRIOT QUARTERBACK sets up over center.

Bam! Bateman runs offside and flattens the

quarterback. Penalty flags fly everywhere.

ON SIDELINE

Defensive Coordinator Banes rolls his eyes.

The Ref moves the ball five yards and gives

the offside sign.

ON PATRIOTS

They come out of the huddle again.

Pow! Bateman dives offside again and

forearms the Quarterback, knocking him on his

back. Flags fly again.

One Patriot lineman makes the mistake of

pushing Bateman. Bateman literally jumps on

his head. More flags fly.

ON SIDELINE

Banes is screaming something unintelligible

at Bateman.

ON BALL

It's marched downfield by the Ref, this time

fifteen yards.

OVER this we hear:

Here come the Patriots again.

EXT. GAME - ANGLE ON SCOREBOARD - SECOND QUARTER

shows the Patriots up 17 to 0.

ON SHANE

He's rolling in the back field again looking

for a receiver.

SHANE'S POV

Nothing but meat coming at him.

BACK TO SCENE

Shane panics and tosses the ball out of

bounds. Shane looks at McGinty on the

sidelines. We hear McGinty's voice.

Shane puts his head down like he knows it.

IN HUDDLE

Everyone is dirty, sweating bullets and

breathing very hard.

Shane leans into the huddle.

Lee is raising his hand.

And with that he promptly vomits sixteen

eggs.

Everyone is reacting.       Some players gag.

ON HUDDLE

Eleven bentover guys move in unison with tiny

steps to their left.

ON PATRIOTS' LINEBACKER

The guy watches the huddle moving.

ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

Summerall has his binoculars on the moving

huddle.

Pat just hands John the binoculars.

IN HUDDLE

Shane calls the play as they continue to move

as one.

ON HUDDLE

The huddle stops and they break for the line

of scrimmage.

ON LEE

He lines up face to face with the Patriots'

defensive end.

Lee breathes in the guy's face and the

Patriot gags.

Lee runs right over the guy.       He's quickly

followed by Lamont with the ball.

Lamont runs for eighteen yards and a first

down.

ON PATRIOT DEFENSIVE END

He's waving for a substitute as he weaves off

the field.

ON PACIFICO

He flicks his smoke away as he runs out onto

the field.

INT. BAR (QUEENS, NEW YORK)

A guy sitting at the bar turns his head

quickly to the televised game when he hears

Pacifico's name.

This is the same mafioso type who saw Lou

kick the ball that knocked the godfather's

hat off. Remember?

EXT. BIG O - ON SHANE - DAY

He crouches down and waits for the snap from

Evans.

Pacifico lines himself up.

It's a perfect snap.   Shane spots it,

Pacifico belts it.

And it goes through for three.

ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

They begin immediately singing "Hail to the

Redskins," a march always sung after a score.

They and the sparse crowd in the stadium know

and sing every word.

ON PACIFICO

He gets high fives all around. Then Bateman

runs up and in his ecstasy, slaps Pacifico in

the head.

Pacifico goes down, knocked out cold.

ON CHEERLEADERS

Led by Annabelle, the girls are doing a

stirring finale to "Hail to the Redskins."

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY (HALF-TIME)

Everyone is lying on the floor.

Shane has ice bags on his head, shoulder,

elbow and both knees.

Pacifico is getting smelling salts from a

trainer as Bateman hovers nearby waiting to

apologize.

Mickey Lee is chewing ice.

Cochran is reading his Bible.

McGinty walks in and bends down to Shane.

Shane smiles through his pain.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

The Patriots have the ball. Their

Quarterback drops back for a pass and throws

it.

ON WILKINSON

Earl is covering the intended receiver. He

deftly steps in front of the guy, and makes a

diving catch.

ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

Madden starts shuffling through pages.

He finds the paper he's looking for.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Shane is walking toward the huddle.     In his

ear, he hears:

Shane stops short of the huddle.     Everyone is

looking at him.

There is a beat and then Shane steps in.

Shane looks around the huddle.     Everybody

looks pained and/or depressed.

They break the huddle and Shane sets up over

Evans. He glances over at Brian Murray.

Murray is lined up in a three point stance at

tight end. But his head is turned and he's

looking directly at Shane.

Shane nods on the snap.

The front five, in the persons of Andre,

Jamal, Reese, Mickey Lee and Cochran, hit out

and simultaneously knock their men on their

backs.

Shane, with plenty of time, hits Murray over

the middle for twelve yards.

Shane looks over at the sidelines.   McGinty

is smiling.

everywhere.

ON PACIFICO

Boom!   He boots the extra point.

Scoreboard:    Patriots 17, Redskins 10.

EXT. FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

We're on the clock which shows one minute ten

seconds left in the fourth quarter.

ON HUDDLE

It breaks and comes to the line of scrimmage.

Shane drops into the shotgun.

Shane rolls left but there's a blitz! The

cornerback is almost on him when Shane shifts

and rolls the other way.

ON FRANKLIN

He's wide open five yards from the goal line.

ON SHANE

They're breathing down his back.

SHANE'S POV

He sees Franklin and cocks his arm.

Suddenly, opposing jerseys are everywhere.

Shane dumps the ball. He's immediately

decked by a defensive end.

ON BALL

We watch the flight of it in SLOW MOTION. We

FOLLOW it right INTO the hands of... a New

England Patriot defensive back.

ON SHANE

He's down and not moving.

ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

They scream in despair.

ON ANNABELLE

She falls to her knees in pain.

ON SHANE

He's helped off the field and onto the bench.

ON McGINTY

He grabs Bateman before he can run out onto

the field.

He runs out onto the field.

ON PATRIOTS

They line up.

The quarterback hands off to the running back

right up the middle in a typical "run out the

clock" play.

BAM! Bateman comes out of nowhere, decks the

runner and literally rips the ball out of his

hands as he goes down.

ON CROWD

They go wild!

ON ANNABELLE

She does a cartwheel.

ON McGINTY

He's leaning over a groggy Shane on the

bench.

McGinty grabs some smelling salts from a

hovering trainer.

He shoves them under Shane's nose.    Shane is

suddenly very awake.

Shane stares at him.

Then he stands up, wobbles and puts on his

helmet.

ON HUDDLE

They're all turned and watching as Shane

makes his way slowly out onto the field.

Annabelle watches him closely.

ON HUDDLE

It breaks and Shane stands over Evans and

looks out at the defense.

Nasty-looking linebackers and cornerbacks

stare at him.

His voice cracks and several defensive

players openly laugh at him.

Shane gets an idea.

ON ANDRE

He's down in a three-point stance facing a

defender. He whispers to Reese:

ON LAMONT

He shifts position in the backfield.

Lamont shifts again. Clifford goes in motion

from his flanker position but then changes

his mind and goes back the other way.

Lamont and Clifford then bump into each

other.

ON PATRIOT DEFENSE

They are totally confused now as they try to

adjust to the equally confused Redskins.

ON McGINTY

He looks extremely pissed.

ON SHANE

He turns to hand the ball off to Lamont but

Lamont is not there.

Shane turns the other way and sees Lamont

just standing there looking at him. Shane

runs over to him and hands him the ball.

Meanwhile, the Patriot defense is going the

other direction.

Lamont takes off.

One cornerback is not taken in. The guy

dives for Lamont's legs. We hear a CLANK as

the cornerback's HELMET hits Lamont's

industrial KNEE BRACE. The guy bounces off

and Lamont trots into the end zone.

Shane, meanwhile, is looking at McGinty on

the sidelines.

Shane nods vigorously.

Shane looks down.

Shane nods.

ON O'NEIL

He looks ten years younger as he and

Augustine watch.

ON PACIFICO

He sets up for the kick.

ON SHANE

He waits for the snap.

ON BRIAN MURRAY

He sets up at his flanker position.

Shane catches the snap and pitches the ball

out to Murray from his holding position.

The Patriot right defensive end breaks

through and reaches for Murray. The only

person in his way is Shane, still kneeling in

the holding position. Shane screams as the

huge lineman trips over him and then falls on

him.

Murray sweeps around the right side and

scores untouched.

Redskins win.

Everybody goes nuts.

ON O'NEIL

He pounds on Augustine.

ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

They pound on each other.     Hail to the

Redskins is deafening.

ON McGINTY

He just smiles.

ON SHANE

He's still under the defensive end. Reese

Evans pulls the guy off and bends down to

Shane.

Shane manages a painful smile.

INT. WASHINGTON HILTON - BAR - NIGHT

It's packed with players, friends and

assorted groupies.

Pacifico is smoking and talking non-stop to a

group who hang on his every word.

Andre is already passed out at a booth.

Jamal supports one side of Andre so he

doesn't fall over.

Murray is signing to several fans who sign

back.

Clifford Franklin signs autographs.

Earl Wilkinson, dressed to the nines, is

dancing close and slow with a gorgeous woman.

Shane is at the bar and he's not in good

shape. He's got cuts and bruises visible and

every time he moves he grimaces. The

martinis are starting to help, however.

He's talking to a stunning WOMAN IN RED.

He finishes his martini and throws the olive

over his shoulder.

She signals to the bartender.

Shane gets his new drink, takes a sip and

visibly slumps at the bar.

Shane looks at her closely.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Shane weaves down the hallway with the Woman

In Red.

They stop at a door.

Shane fumbles for a key.

Another stunning-looking woman suddenly

appears from down the hall. This is the

WOMAN IN BLUE.

She checks the hallway, takes the key from

Shane and sticks it in the lock.

Suddenly, Annabelle Farrell appears in the

hallway.

Crack! Annabelle punches her in the nose

with a straight right hand. The girl bounces

off the wall.

Both girls take off.

Annabelle opens the door.

INT. ROOM - NIGHT

Annabelle is pulling the bed down as Shane

falls into a chair.

Shane looks embarrassed.

She turns and sees that he's already passed

out.

She looks at him not unkindly. Then she

unbuckles his belt and starts pulling his

pants off.

INT. ROOM - CLOSE ON SHANE'S BEAT UP FACE - DAWN

as he opens his eyes.

He rolls over and screams in pain.

ON ANNABELLE

She's wearing nothing but a Redskins' T-

shirt. She quickly bends over him.

Shane takes it and swigs a glass of water.

She helps him get out of bed.   When he

stands, he screams again.

She walks him to the bathroom like an old

man. He shuffles in and closes the door.

He appears again at the door.

He leans on her as she walks him back.

He gets into bed with a moan.

She nods.

Annabelle takes her time answering.

Annabelle cradles his head.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

Annabelle walks up to Shane's door with a

stack of newspapers. She enters.

INT. ROOM - DAY

The bathroom door is closed.      Annabelle talks

to him anyway.

She reads a headline.

Shane comes out of the bathroom dressed and

ready to go. He's still moving slowly and in

great pain.

Shane tries to put on his coat, but he's so

sore he can't. Annabelle helps him.

There's another awkward silence.

EXT. CLIFFORD FRANKLIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Clifford, still carrying his football, comes

out of his apartment in a third floor walk-

up. He's wearing his Redskins jacket.

As he turns around from locking his door, he

stops dead in his tracks.

All of Clifford's neighbors, all the way down

both halls, are standing in front of their

doors.

They all start applauding.

Clifford smiles from ear to ear.

EXT. PALM RESTAURANT - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

We see Shane walk in the door.

INT. PALM - NIGHT

The Scabskins are all being served dinner in

a private room.

Mickey Lee is served a steak the size of a

briefcase. Andre and Jamal get lobsters big

enough to be pets.

Ed O'Neil is being fed pureed asparagus by

Augustine. When Augustine drops the napkin

and bends over, O'Neil whispers urgently to

Cochran who is enjoying a steak:

McGinty taps his glass at the head of the

table and stands.

There is dead silence in the room.   Everybody

thinks it's over.

There's a beat and then everyone breaks into

cheers.

Suddenly, the door flies open and a REPORTER

and a cameraman step in and start filming.

The Reporter shoves a microphone at McGinty.

Out in the restaurant, patrons see the

players and a few break into "Hail to the

Redskins."

Suddenly, the whole restaurant starts

singing.

Shane looks embarrassed.

Pacifico stands up on his seat, and conducts

the singing.

Andre and Jamal hold their lobsters in the

air and make them dance to the song.

INT. EDDIE MARTEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

We're ON a TELEVISION showing Pacifico

conducting and the entire restaurant singing.

Eddie Martel (Redskin quarterback) is

watching the scene at home on the late local

news.

Martel looks very angry.

INT. SHANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Shane answers his door.     Annabelle is

standing there.

She gives him a bottle of pills.

Shane smiles at her.

She suddenly grabs him and they kiss big-

time.

Then she breaks and walks quickly away.

Shane doesn't know what to make of this.

EXT. MEADOWLANDS (NEW JERSEY) - DAY

We're DOWN ON the field in the middle of a

play.

Shane is running away from three New York

Giant defensive linemen.

Shane is not even looking for a receiver.

He's looking to save his life.

Finally, he's caught by a six-foot-five, two

hundred and seventy pound defensive end named

HANK MORRIS, who throws him down and lands on

top of him. Oooof!

INT. CONTROL BOOTH - ON SUMMERALL AND MADDEN - DAY

They're back in their booth calling the game.

EXT. STADIUM - DAY

Jerome Lindell is once again outside the

stadium, picketing with a smaller group of

players.

He does his interview on camera, standing in

front of a huge semi-truck.

And a big, overweight truck driver stands

next to him.

The truck driver suddenly pumps his arm and a

CACOPHONY OF TRUCK AIR HORNS GO OFF.

It's deafening but Lindell smiles through it

all.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Shane is rolling out with Morris on his heels

again. He can't find anyone open and runs

out of bounds.

IN HUDDLE

Everybody is breathing hard, beat-up and

exhausted. Shane leans in.

They break.   Shane sets up in the shotgun.

On the snap, Lee and Cochran double-team

Morris.

Morris slaps Cochran away like, well, a rag

doll, and then confronts the Sumo master.

He bumps stomachs with Lee. Lee flies

through the air and lands on his ass.

ON SHANE

He spots his receiver, he cocks his arm and

wham! Morris decks him. And, of course,

lands on him. Oooof!

In order to get up, Morris puts one huge hand

on Shane's helmet and pushes himself up.

Shane moans as his face guard digs a four-

inch hole in the turf.

ON McGINTY

He's talking into his mike.

Shane gets up. He's got a huge piece of turf

stuck in his face guard so that for a beat,

we can't even see him.

Then he pulls out the dirt and grass, and we

see Shane really pissed off for the first

time.

Everyone gathers around.

They break the huddle.     Shane goes into a

shotgun.

Shane does a three-step drop from the

shotgun.

Cochran and Lee hit out on either side of

Morris, giving him a clear shot at Shane.

Morris comes hard and fast.

Shane looks downfield, winds up, turns and

fires the ball at Morris's head.

The ball goes like a bullet for five feet and

then sticks like a dart in Morris's face

guard.

For a moment, Morris is blinded.

And Shane is dumbfounded.

Then Morris starts to wrestle the ball out of

his mask.

Andre and Jamal grab onto Morris who starts

stumbling down field with the ball still

stuck in his helmet.

But Morris won't go down. He's still trying

to pry the ball loose as he throws off Jamal.

Then he shakes off Andre.

ON BRIAN MURRAY

He's in SLOW MOTION in midair, diving towards

Morris.

MURRAY'S POV

It's absolutely QUIET (he's deaf, remember?)

as he soars towards Morris's head, helmet and

ball.

Wham! Murray's full body weight hits Morris

in the helmet, which flies off and rolls

across the field with the ball still stuck in

it.

OUT OF THE SILENCE, we suddenly hear the hit

and the crowd roar.

Morris goes down like a building with Murray

buried in his throat.

ON ROOM (D.C.)

Todd, Rod and Bob are destroying Todd's den

in reaction to the hit.

ON ANOTHER LIVING ROOM

Annabelle is screaming "Whoa!" to that hit.

ON O'NEIL AND AUGUSTINE

They're watching ON TV.

ON BALL AND HELMET

It's in the very chubby hands of Mickey Lee,

who is rumbling downfield with the

fumble/helmet recovery.

New York players have been slow to pick this

up because they, too, have been admiring the

lick that Murray put on Morris.

Suddenly, the whole team is chasing Lee.

They catch him pretty easily at the twenty,

but Lee represents a lot of weight.

Lee staggers across the ten, shaking players

off left and right.

One defensive halfback sacrifices himself and

throws himself at Lee's feet.

Lee trips over the guy, gains his footing

again, walks on the guy (who screams in

agony) and falls into the end zone carrying

three players with him.

ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

John is beside himself.

ON LEE

He gets up in jubilation, spikes the

ball/helmet combination, and runs through the

back of the end zone.

But he doesn't stop. He's aiming for a low

wall that separates the first row of fans

from the field.

ON FOUR FANS

They see Mickey rumbling at them and they all

get the picture at the same time. They

scream!

ON MICKEY

He launches himself into the stands in

ecstasy.

ON FOUR FANS

Crunch!     Lee lands on all four of them.

ON FOOTBALL

It's hiked into Shane's hands and Pacifico

boots the extra point.

ON SCOREBOARD

"Giants 10 -- Redskins 10

ON SIDELINE

Murray and Lee are getting congratulations

from everyone.

Murray nods that he understands.

Jamal and Andre are hugging Lee. In the

b.g., we can see paramedics lifting one of

Lee's four fans onto a stretcher.

McGinty walks into the middle of it.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

We're CLOSE ON Bateman as he lines up for the

kick-off. Everybody in the stadium knows

that an on-side kick is coming.

Bateman is standing in the hot spot for

recovering the ball.

Shane and everyone with decent hands is on

the field.

Pacifico lines it up and boots it ten yards.

The ball takes a crazy hop, hits a Giant, and

ricochets off him.

Bateman runs over two guys and grabs the ball

on the bounce. He's got it.

But Bateman doesn't go down. He turns and

starts running across the field.

Shane runs after him.

But Bateman likes this new job: kick-off

returner! Especially after he runs over a

Giant and stiff-arms another.

Bateman is finally trapped on the far

sideline after gaining perhaps eight yards.

So, he turns and starts running back the

other way.

Shane has been chasing him and now sees

Bateman running back at him.

Shane has no choice but to throw himself in

front of Bateman's legs.

Bateman goes down.

Shane jumps up:

Bateman looks up at Shane.

ON CLOCK

Bateman has burned up most of the clock.

Eighteen seconds remain.

ON SIDELINE

McGinty, Shane and Pacifico confer.

McGinty looks at Shane and they both shrug.

ON SUMMERALL AND MADDEN

Madden can't believe it.

ON SHANE

He's set up to receive the snap.

Pacifico lines himself up the way soccer-

style kickers do.

Then he takes a drag on his smoke, and flicks

it away.

Shane looks at Pacifico and his clean

uniform.

Then Shane looks at his own uniform which is

covered with blood, dirt, and grass stains.

Pacifico looks clean.

Pacifico is really touched.

Shane turns to Evans who smiles at him

between his own legs.

The snap is perfect.    Pacifico boots the shit

out of it.

ON BALL

End over end, yard after yard, it flies

straight and true.

The ball hits the crossbar and goes over.

Everybody goes crazy. Players are pounding

on Pacifico. But Pacifico is desperately

looking around for someone.

He spots him: It's Bateman running flat-out

across the field to congratulate him.

Pacifico runs for his life.

INT. APARTMENT DOOR - NIGHT

Shane knocks. After a beat, the door opens

and Annabelle is standing there rubbing her

eyes. She's wearing a cut-off Redskin

jersey.

Nothing comes out.

Annabelle takes that in and thinks about it.

She takes his hand and leads him inside.

INT. ANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Annabelle is giving Shane a slow, sensuous,

full-body massage. It's lucky for us he's on

his stomach.

Shane does a lot of moaning as Annabelle's

fingers work their magic.

She gets to a place on his shoulder that's

especially tender. He moans even louder.

Annabelle pulls her jersey off and gently

presses her breasts into Shane's back.

Shane puts a pillow over his head to drown

out the ecstasy.

After a beat, he pulls the pillow away.

Annabelle starts laughing.

Annabelle is laughing hard now as Shane rolls

over.

INT. ANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Shane and Annabelle are in a close, after-sex

kind of cuddle thing.

Shane is unburdening himself.

We see Annabelle's hand move slightly under

the covers.

They kiss real good.

EXT. O'NEIL MANSION - MORNING

It's a huge town house in Foggy Bottom.    Its

entrance is now lined with REPORTERS.

One is speaking ON CAMERA to his anchor.

INSERT

We see two photographs of Earl: One with his

current beard and the other, his clean-shaven

mug shot of five years ago.

INT. STUDIO - ANCHOR

He's doing his sports segment from the

studio.

INT. O'NEIL'S BEDROOM - DAY

McGinty stares out the window at the

reporters as Augustine feeds O'Neil soup.

Augustine leaves with the tray.

INT. CAR SHOWROOM - DAY

We're ON    Mickey Lee, who is wearing his

Redskin    game jersey with no pads. He's

stuffed    into a Cadillac Brougham, a big-ass

version    of the Caddy.

He's talking directly TO US.

Mickey is very wooden as a spokesperson.    He

tries again.

Mickey looks game.

INT. HILTON - NIGHT

Shane walks down the hall to his room.        He

enters.

INT. SHANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

He walks in and closes the door.

When he turns around, Eddie Martel, ex-

Washington Redskin quarterback, is sitting on

Shane's bed.

Two defensive linemen-types stand by the

window.

There's a beat and then Shane suddenly bolts

for the door. But the two linemen grab and

hold him.

He kicks Shane viciously in the side.     Shane

screams.

The linemen drops Shane on the floor.

Shane is gasping on the floor.

Martel viciously kicks Shane again.     Shane

screams.

Shane is trying to get his breath.

They move toward the door.

EXT. BIG O - MAGIC HOUR

Once again, fans stream into the parking

lots.

In a corner of a lot, Jerome Lindell is once

again holding forth ON CAMERA.

But this time, he's standing with a hard-

looking guy in a suit, named MATHESON.

Lindell looks uncomfortable.   But he smiles

anyway.

INT. MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL BOOTH - NIGHT

The familiar "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL THEME

SONG" is just ending. AL MICHAELS does his

on camera intro.

EXT. STADIUM - MAGIC HOUR

Eddie Martel, Wilson Jones and other regular

Redskins take their seats on the fifty yard

line.

INT. REDSKIN LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone is just about dressed in their

uniforms and ready to go.

Lou Pacifico enters in street clothes and

starts undressing quickly. He looks worried.

Shane watches Lou for a beat. We see Shane

shift his upper body and grimace.

McGinty enters and pulls Shane aside.

Shane smiles in spite of the pain.

McGinty walks into the middle of the locker

room and goes into pre-game speech mode.

EXT. STADIUM - DAY

Boom! Pacifico belts the kick-off deep into

the end zone. Touchback.

ON AL, DAN AND BOOMER

The three hosts sit in shirtsleeves and ties,

headphones on.

Everybody laughs politely.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Bam! Earl Wilkinson flattens a Dallas punt

returner. He's now wearing a jersey with his

real name on the back.

ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

Bob is dressed in a striped convict suit with

Wilkinson's number on it.

He gets high fives from Todd and Rod for

Wilkinson's hit.

ON SHANE

He walks out onto the field to join the

huddle.

He turns and sees a smiling Annabelle.

Shane gives her a guilty wave and then

cringes with the pain of just having to lift

his arm.

ON LINE OF SCRIMMAGE

The Redskins line up. Cochran is opposite

Butler, the big tackle that "visited" Shane's

room.

On the snap, Butler bashes Cochran's head

with his forearm and knocks his helmet off.

Then he runs over him.

ON SHANE

He under-throws a very weak-looking pass to

Lamont.

Shane grits his teeth against the pain.

ON COCHRAN

He's dazed and still on the ground.

Butler walks over and bends down to him.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Shane is in the backfield, once again running

for his life.

He's rolling left with Butler on his heels.

He throws another weak incomplete pass to

Murray.

Shane is crushed by Butler after he throws

the ball.

Butler leans on Shane's side as he gets up.

Shane gasps with pain.

ON McGINTY

He's watching Shane closely.   Then he talks

into his mike.

ON AL, DAN AND BOOMER

They're watching the replay on their monitor.

Dan is very happy.

Some laughter.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

The Redskins huddle. Shane is in pain.       He

looks up at the clock.

ON CLOCK

There's thirty-two seconds left in the half.

The break the huddle and come to the line of

scrimmage.

Shane rolls right and looks downfield. He

holds the ball and keeps rolling. No one can

get open.

Suddenly, Lamont cuts in front of him and

yells:

Lamont sees an open lane and Shane follows

him. He eats up 15 yards before two

defensive halfbacks close in.

Lamont throws an incredible block and takes

out both guys.

Shane blows by and heads for the end zone.

Only a safety stands between Shane and pay

dirt.

CLOSE ON SHANE

His side is killing him with every step he

takes.

When the safety moves up on him, Shane panics

and goes down in the same kind of slide that

Eddie Martel did in the beginning.

Boom!   The GUN SOUNDS and the half ends.

Shane sees Redskin trainers running out onto

the field.

He turns and sees Lamont rolling on the

ground in pain as he holds his bad knee.

INT. MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL BOOTH - NIGHT

The boys are doing their half-time stand up.

No laughter.

After a beat we hear:

Dan reaches across Al and grabs Boomer by the

throat.

The three of them start wrestling in the

booth.

INT. REDSKIN LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone is nursing a bruise or some sort of

wound. Shane is nowhere to be seen.

McGinty walks into the middle of the locker

room.

And with that he walks out.     Everybody looks

beaten and depressed.

EXT. OUTSIDE LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Shane stops two paramedics who push Roland

Lamont on a stretcher. Roland is really

hurting.

Shane looks terribly guilty.

Shane can't look at him, but he nods.

The paramedics roll him away.     Shane slumps

against the wall near tears.

McGinty comes out of the locker room.     He

locks eyes with Shane for a beat.

And then McGinty turns his back on him and

walks away.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Everyone is quiet.   Shane walks in.

SID, the equipment manager, sees him and

yells.

He smacks Shane on his bad side and Shane

grimaces.

Everyone stares at Shane for a beat.

Nobody says anything for a beat.

Shane looks around the room at this beaten

bunch. No one makes eye contact with him.

Everybody lets this sink in.

Earl Wilkinson finally speaks up.

Everybody turns to Shane.

Everybody whoops!

Shane happens to glance at Pacifico.

Pacifico won't meet his eye.

Shane turns to Sid.

Sid helps Shane strip his jersey off.

Everyone reacts to the bruises on Shane's

side.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

The Cowboys are already back on the field as

the Redskins come out of their locker room.

ON AL, DAN AND BOOMER

Boomer's tie is off and his shirt is torn.

Dan looks guilty, but still angry.

ON BALL

The Dallas kicker puts the ball in the end

zone for a touchback.

ON SHANE

He starts to follow the offense out on the

field. Then he turns and sees Annabelle

engrossed in a cheer.

He runs over to her.

And with that, Shane takes her in his arms

and kisses her deeply.

The crowd on that side of the field reacts to

the kiss with a "Wooooooo!"

ON SHANE

He breaks the kiss and looks up in the stands

at Eddie Martel.

Shane gives him the finger.

The crowd goes "Wooooo!" at that too.

Martel doesn't think this is funny.

Shane walks onto the field leaving a confused

but happy Annabelle.

He walks past Dallas defensive lineman

Butler.

Butler is too shocked for a comeback.

ON HUDDLE

It breaks and Shane walks to the line of

scrimmage.

We can see now that Wilkinson and Bateman are

now part of the offense.

They line up as receivers opposite defensive

halfbacks. In fact, everyone but Shane is on

the line of scrimmage, paired up across from

a cowboy.

Shane leans over Reese and takes in the

Dallas defense.

The Dallas MIDDLE LINEBACKER yells at Shane.

Shane just smiles.

MONTAGE

On the snap, many things happen at once:

A)   COCHRAN

B)   SHANE

C)   CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

D)   BATEMAN

E)   WILKINSON

F)   LEE

ON FIELD

All across the line of scrimmage, Redskins

are punching, kicking and gouging the Dallas

defense.

WHISTLES BLOW.   Flags fly everywhere.

Most of the Dallas players are down and

screaming.

Jamal stands across from a DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.

He hasn't touched the guy. But he nods to

the player to look at his hand.

The guy looks down just as Jamal flicks open

a deadly-looking switchblade.

The guy jumps back and yells:

But there is so much confusion that nobody

pays any attention. Jamal slips the knife

away.

The officials are going crazy trying     to

figure out the penalties as Shane and     the

offense back up and make room for the     Dallas

medical staff who come running out on     the

field.

Some Dallas players are livid:

ON McGINTY

He's smiling to himself on the sidelines.

ON REFEREE

He faces the cameras, turns on his microphone

and sums up the penalties.

ON BALL

A ref is taking a very long walk with it. He

stops at the Redskin two-yard line and puts

it down.

IN HUDDLE

Shane leans in.

They break the huddle and line up with their

backs to their goal.

ON COCHRAN AND BUTLER

Butler is still whining.

ON SHANE

ON COCHRAN

He drops Butler with a vicious forearm.

Shane flicks the ball over the middle to

Murray who pulls it in for fifteen yards and

a first down.

EXT. HUDDLE - DAY

The Redskin huddle breaks.   The guys come to

the line of scrimmage.

ON SHANE

He's in the shotgun calling signals.

He gets the snap and starts looking downfield

for receivers.

ON COCHRAN

He slips while he's blocking Butler who takes

advantage of the situation and blows by him.

ON SHANE

He's got Franklin crossing in the end zone.

He cocks and throws, and simultaneously gets

decked by Butler.

ON BALL

A Dallas defensive halfback     goes up for    it

but just tips the ball. It      keeps going    now

end over end... right into     the waiting    arms

of Franklin who is standing     by himself    in the

end zone.

Franklin is shocked.   His teammates run INTO

FRAME and mob him.

ON SHANE

He's on his back.

ON ANNABELLE

She looks worried as trainers run out onto

the field.

ON O'NEIL AND AUGUSTINE

They're watching in O'Neil's bedroom.

ON SHANE

Trainers are bending over him.      He's out but

he's mumbling:

A trainer hears that and looks worried.

Shane's teammates run up and carry him off

the field.

ON FRANKLIN

He's holding for Pacifico on the extra point.

On the snap, Franklin bobbles the ball but

manages to put it down.

Pacifico belts it through the uprights.

Scoreboard:    Dallas 24, Washington 21.

EXT. SIDELINE - DAY

Shane is sitting on the bench holding his

head and his side. He's talking quietly to

McGinty.

ON WILKINSON

He's on the field calling for a fair catch.

He makes it.

ANOTHER ANGLE - WILKINSON

He's leading the offense out onto the field.

ANOTHER ANGLE - WILKINSON

He takes the snap from the shotgun and keeps

the ball on a sweep. He plows for twelve

yards.

ON SHANE

McGinty is still bent over him.

Shane is in major pain but nods his head.

ON WILKINSON

He rolls again, but no one is open. He

crosses the line of scrimmage, is hit and

goes down.

ON CLOCK

It continues to run and passes twenty seconds

as we watch.

ON REDSKINS

They're hurrying back to the line of

scrimmage. Wilkinson stands over center.

On the snap, Wilkinson throws the ball out of

bounds.

ON SHANE

He shakily follows Pacifico out onto the

field.

Reese Evans catches up with him.

Pacifico doesn't answer.

ON BALL

Evans leans over it.

ON SHANE

He's kneeling in the middle of the field

waiting for the snap. But something is

bothering him.

Pacifico looks up from where he is set up for

the kick. There are tears in his eyes.

Shane tries to digest what he just heard.

Shane looks back at Pacifico and makes a

decision.

The ball is snapped perfectly.      Shane catches

it and spots it perfectly.

Pacifico moves to kick it.

And Shane pulls the ball away.

Pacifico flies through the air like Snoopy as

he kicks nothing but air. He lands hard.

Shane jumps to his feet and starts running.

ON McGINTY

He's in shock.

ON SHANE

He has totally caught the Cowboys by

surprise. He sweeps around the right side.

The Dallas middle linebacker has recovered

and is moving quickly to cut Shane off.

But Reese Evans comes out of nowhere and

crushes the guy with a flying block.

Shane cuts downfield and heads for the end

zone with nobody near him, except:

For the same safety from the first half who

waits for him at the ten.

The safety smiles as he takes a bead on

Shane.

Shane heads right for the guy. He puts his

head down and smacks helmets with the safety.

The guy goes down and Shane runs over him and

into the end zone.

ON McGINTY

He jumps into the air.

ON O'NEIL

He jumps out of bed.

ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

They jump on each other.

ON ANNABELLE

She's jumping for joy.

ON SHANE

He spikes the shit out of the ball.   And then

sees something up field.

Shane stands stock-still in the end zone

watching the REF call the penalty.

ON MICKEY LEE

He's wearing number 77 and he collapses in

tears.

ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

They are now sobbing in agony.

ON O'NEIL

He's being helped back to bed by Augustine.

ON SHANE

He's walking slowly back to the line of

scrimmage.

ON McGINTY

He looks sick.

Shane walks up to Pacifico who is down. His

arm is being immobilized by a team trainer.

Shane nods.     In his earpiece, he hears

McGinty.

Shane leans into the huddle.

He looks around the huddle. He studies each

face. And then he comes to rest on Brian

Murray.

Brian's eyes are shining.   He doesn't need

words here.

Everybody puts their hands into the middle.

They break the huddle with a roar.

ON CLOCK

Three seconds are showing.

ON LINE OF SCRIMMAGE

Shane leans over Reese and calls it.

Shane nods.     On the snap, Shane rolls left.

ON REESE EVANS

He cuts his man at the knees.

ON MICKEY LEE

He takes two men down.

ON MURRAY

He cuts on a deep post.

ON SHANE

He steps up and throws a clean bullet

downfield. He roars in pain as he throws it.

ON MURRAY

The pass is perfect. He pulls it in and

beats his man to the end zone.

Redskins win.

ON CROWD

It roars! "Hail to the Redskins" is

deafening.

Todd, Rod and Bob are screaming.

O'Neil kisses Augustine.

Annabelle throws a punch into the air.

McGinty is all smiles.     Shane walks up to him

and they shake hands.

Pilachowski and Banes hug.

Lee and Andre are hugging and crying.

Cochran is on his knees praying.     Reese Evans

joins him.

Wilkinson hugs Jamal.

Clifford Franklin, hometown boy, throws

himself into the stands where fans mob him.

ON EDDIE MARTEL

The Washington Redskins first-string

quarterback is so pissed off he jumps up from

his seat and turns quickly to go up the steps

and out of the stadium.

But he slips awkwardly and falls.     He grabs

his knee and screams.

ON BRIAN MURRAY

He's still in the end zone, holding the ball

up to the crowd. The roar is deafening.

BRIAN'S POV

We HEAR NOTHING, but somehow the pure energy

of the moment comes through.

ON SHANE

IN the SILENCE, he's walking in SLOW MOTION

toward Annabelle. And everybody is smiling.
