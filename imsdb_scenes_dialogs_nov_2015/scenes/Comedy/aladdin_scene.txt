JAFAR:  You...are late.

GAZEEM:A thousand apologies, O patient one.

JAFAR:  You have it, then?

GAZEEM:I had to slit a few throats to get it.  (Pulls out

JAFAR:  Trust me, my pungent friend.  You'll get what's

IAGO:   What's coming to you!  Awk!

(JAFAR pulls out the second half of the medallion.  He connects

JAFAR:  Quickly, follow the trail!

(All ride off, following the glowing speck of light, until

JAFAR:  At last, after all my years of searching,  the cave

IAGO:       Awk!  Cave of wonders!

GAZEEM: By Allah!

JAFAR:  Now, remember!  Bring me the lamp.  The rest of the

CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?

GAZEEM: It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.

CAVE:       Know this.  Only one may enter here.  One whose

JAFAR:  What are you waiting for?  Go on!

(GAZEEM hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave.  With

CAVE:       Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough.

(IAGO unburied himself from the sand, coughing as he does so.)

IAGO:       I can't believe it.  I just don't believe it. We're

JAFAR:  Patience, Iago.  Patience.  Gazeem was obviously

IAGO:       (Extremely sarcastically) Oh, there's a big

JAFAR:  Yes, we do.  Only one may enter.  I must find this

GUARD:  Stop, thief!  I'll have your hands for a trophy,

ALADDIN:    (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.)  All

GUARD 1:    There he is!

GUARD 2:    You won't get away so easy!

ALADDIN:    You think that was easy?

(He looks at three women, laughing at him.)

GUARD 1:    You two, over that way, and you, with me.  We'll

(ALADDIN pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise.

ALADDIN:    Morning, ladies.

WOMAN 1:    Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't

ALADDIN:    Trouble?  No way.  You're only in trouble if you

(A hand grabs ALADDIN's shoulder and yanks him back.  It's the

ALADDIN:    I'm in trouble!

GUARD:  ...and this time--(A screeching sound from ABU,

ALADDIN:    Perfect timing, Abu!

ABU:        Hello!

ALADDIN:    Come on, let's get outta here!

(ALADDIN battles a GUARD wielding a sword.  He dodges a couple of

(ALADDIN and ABU scamper up a pile of barrels, then kick one down

GUARDS: (one at a time) Riffraff! Street rat!

ALADDIN:    Just a little snack, guys!

(ALADDIN scampers to the top of a platform. The GUARDS shake the

GUARDS: Rip him open, take it back guys!

ALADDIN:    I can take a hint, gotta face the facts

WOMEN:  Who?!?

(ALADDIN jumps off the platform to certain death, only to grab ABU's

(ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a

WOMAN:  I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em!

ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat

(ALADDIN and ABU exit.  Cut to MUSCLEMAN flexing to a crowd.  The

(A chase sequence, in which ALADDIN and ABU, pursued by the GUARDS,

CROWD:  Stop, thief! Vandal!

ALADDIN:    Let's not be too hasty

(ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens

LADY:   Still I think he's rather tasty

(ALADDIN tumbles away, then puts his arm around a GUARD, acting

ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat

GUARDS: WRONG!

(They all jump into a pile and fight.  When they stop, ALADDIN and

GUARD 1:    He's got a sword!

GUARD 2:    You idiot--we've ALL got swords!!

(ABU sets the sword down gently, then runs.  ALADDIN and ABU are

ALADDIN:    One jump ahead of the hoofbeats!

CROWD:  Vandal!

ALADDIN:    One hop ahead of the hump!

CROWD:  Street rat!

ALADDIN:    One trick ahead of disaster

CROWD:  Scoundrel!

ALADDIN:    They're quick--but I'm much faster

CROWD:  Take that!

(The GUARDS chase ALADDIN up a staircase into a room.  He grabs a

ALADDIN:    Here goes, better throw my hand in

(The GUARDS follow him out the window, but they go straight down to

ALADDIN:    And now, esteemed effendi, we feast!  All right!

(ALADDIN breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU, who begins

ABU:        Uh-oh!

(ABU takes a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks

ALADDIN:    Here, go on--take it.

(The children giggle with delight.  ABU tries to swallow his bite,

ABU:        Ah, don't.  Huh?

(ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight, where there is a parade

BYSTANDER 1:    On his way to the palace, I suppose.

BYSTANDER 2:    Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is startled as the two children come running out from the

PRINCE: Out of my way, you filthy brat!

(The PRINCE brings up his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN

ALADDIN:    Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners

PRINCE: Oh--I teach you some manners!

(The PRINCE kicks ALADDIN into a mud puddle. The crowd laugh at him.)

ALADDIN:    Look at that, Abu.  It's not every day you see a

(The PRINCE stops and turns back to ALADDIN.)

PRINCE: You are a worthless street rat.  You were born a

(ALADDIN rushes the PRINCE, but the doors to the castle slam shut

ALADDIN:    I'm not worthless.  And I don't have fleas.  Come

(ALADDIN makes the climb to his home with the view, then tucks in

ALADDIN:    Riffraff, street rat.

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace.)

(Dissolve to same shot during day.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber.

PRINCE: I've never been so insulted!

SULTAN: Oh, Prince Achmed.  You're not leaving so soon, are

PRINCE: Good luck marrying her off!

SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine!  Jasmine!  Jasmine!  (The SULTAN goes

JASMINE:    Oh, father.  Rajah was just playing with him,

SULTAN: Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor

BOTH:       ...must be married to a prince.

(They walk over to a dove cage.)

SULTAN: By your next birthday.

JASMINE:    The law is wrong.

SULTAN: You've only got three more days!

JASMINE:    Father,  I hate being forced into this.  (She takes

SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not only this law.  (She hands him

JASMINE:    Try to understand.  I've never done a thing on my

SULTAN: But Jasmine, you're a princess.

JASMINE:    Then maybe I don't want to be a princess.  (She

SULTAN: Oooohhh!  Allah forbid you should have any

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second.  JASMINE goes to the dove

SULTAN: I don't know where she gets it from.  Her mother

JAFAR:  My life is but to serve you, my lord.  (He bows.)

SULTAN: It's this suitor business.  Jasmine refuses to

IAGO:   (In the parrot voice) Awk!  Wit's-end.

SULTAN: Oh, ha ha.  Have a cracker, pretty polly!  (He

JAFAR:  Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.

SULTAN: If anyone can help, it's you.

JAFAR:  Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue

SULTAN: Uh, my ring?  But it's been in the family for

JAFAR:  It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.

SULTAN: Everything...will be...fine.

JAFAR:  The diamond.

SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.

(The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns

JAFAR:  You are most gracious, my liege.  Now run along and

SULTAN: (Still hypnotized)  Yes...that'll be...pretty good.

(JAFAR and IAGO exit.  We follow them. When they're out of the room,

IAGO:       I can't take it anymore!  If I gotta choke down on

(JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)

JAFAR:  Calm yourself, Iago.

IAGO:       Then I'd grab him around the head.  Whack! Whack!

JAFAR:  (Speaking over IAGO.)  Soon, I will be sultan, not

IAGO:       And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!  Ha

(The pair pass through a door and slam it shut.  Diss. to ext. gardens

JASMINE:    Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.  But I can't stay here and

(She disappears over the wall. Cut to daytime on the street  ALADDIN

ALADDIN:        Okay, Abu.  Go!

(ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR.)

PROPRIETOR: (To passing crowd)  Try this, your taste buds

ABU:            Blah blah blah!

PROPRIETOR: Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape!

(He grabs the melon away from ABU.  But in the foreground, ALADDIN

ABU:            Bye bye!

(He zings back up.  The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front,

ALADDIN:    Nice goin' Abu.  Breakfast is served.

(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat.  We see J

SHOPKEEPER 1:   Pretty lady, buy a pot.  No finer pot in brass

SHOPKEEPER 2:   Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs!  Sugar

SHOPKEEPER 3:   Would the lady like a necklace.  A pretty

(She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust

SHOPKEEPER 4:   Fresh fish!  We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

JASMINE:    I don't think so.  (She backs away, but bumps into

ALADDIN:    (He's obviously deeply in love with her.)  Wow!

(She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head.  ABU sees him and

ABU:        Uh oh.  Hello?  Hello?

(JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child

JASMINE:        Oh, you must be hungry.  Here you go.  (The

PROPRIETOR: You'd better be able to pay for that.

JASMINE:        (Mystified) Pay?

PROPRIETOR: No one steals from my cart!

JASMINE:        Oh, I'm sorry sir.  I don't have any money.

PROPRIETOR: Thief!

JASMINE:        Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can

PROPRIETOR: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

(He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to

JASMINE:        No, no please!

(The sword drops, but his hand is stopped by ALADDIN's.)

ALADDIN:        Thank you kind sir.  I'm so glad you've found

JASMINE:        (whispering) What are you doing?

ALADDIN:        (whispering back) Just play along.

PROPRIETOR: You know this girl?

JASMINE:        Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She's a little

PROPRIETOR: She said she knows the Sultan!

ALADDIN:        She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU is picking a pocket.  He hears this, then straightens up.

JASMINE:        Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you?

ABU:            Well, blah blah blah blah.

ALADDIN:        Tragic, isn't it?  (He leans forward, picking

JASMINE:        (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor.

ALADDIN:        No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose

(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he's stolen from the cart falls

PROPRIETOR: Huh?  What is it?  (ABU picks up what he can

(Cut to int. of JAFAR's lab.  IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre

IAGO:       (huffing and puffing)  With all due respect, your

JAFAR:  Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!  (He places the

IAGO:       Yes, o mighty evil one.

(IAGO runs faster.  A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing

JAFAR:  Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can

IAGO:       That's him?!?!   That's the clown we've been

JAFAR:  Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to

(IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down.)

IAGO:   Swell.

(JAFAR laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with

ALADDIN:    Almost there.

(JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms.

JASMINE:    I want to thank you for stopping that man.

ALADDIN:    Uh, forget it.  (He grabs a pole.)  So, uh, this is

(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE:    Is it that obvious?

ALADDIN:    Well, you do kinda stand out.  (He stares at her,

JASMINE:    I'm a fast learner.

ALADDIN:    Right.  C'mon, this way.  (They go inside the roof

JASMINE:    Is this where you live?

ALADDIN:    Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please.

JASMINE:    Fabulous.

ALADDIN:    Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and

JASMINE:    Oh, it's wonderful.

ALADDIN:    I wonder what it would be like to live there, to

JASMINE:    Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how

ALADDIN:    It's better than here.  Always scraping for food

JASMINE:    You're not free to make your own choices.

ALADDIN:    Sometimes you feel so--

JASMINE:    You're just--

BOTH:       (in unison) --trapped.

(They look at each other, realizing that they're perfect for one

ALADDIN:    So, where're you from?

JASMINE:    What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not

ALADDIN:    Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his

ABU:        Why you!

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.)

JASMINE:    My father's forcing me to get married.

ALADDIN:    That's--that's awful.  (ABU appears from behind the

(ABU races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes.)

JASMINE:    What?

ALADDIN:    Abu says that--uh--that's not fair.

ABU:        What?

JASMINE:    Oh did he?

ALADDIN:    Yeah, of course.

JASMINE:    And does Abu have anything else to say?

ALADDIN:    Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do

ABU:        Oh, boy!

JASMINE:    Hmm, tell him that's very sweet.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until

GUARD:  Here you are!

ALADDIN and JASMINE:    They've found me!  (To each other) They're

JASMINE:    My father must have sent them--

ALADDIN:    Do you trust me?

JASMINE:    What?

ALADDIN:    Do you trust me? (He extends his hand)

JASMINE:    Yes. (She takes it.)

ALADDIN:    Then jump!

(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt.  They

GUARD:  We just keep running into each other, don't we,

(Again, the GUARD's turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are

GUARD:  It's the dungeon for you, boy.

ALADDIN:    Hey, get off of me!

JASMINE:    Let go of him.

GUARD:  (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we

JASMINE:    (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak)

(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)

GUARD:  Princess Jasmine.

ALADDIN:    The princess?

ABU:        (peeking out from the vase) The princess?

GUARD:  What are you doing outside the palace?  And with

JASMINE:    That's not your concern.  Do as I command.  Release

GUARD:  Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from

(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing as they go.)

JASMINE:    (getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me, I

(Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers.  He

JASMINE:    Jafar?

JAFAR:  Oh, uh, princess.

IAGO:       Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck!

JAFAR:  How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his

JASMINE:    The guards just took a boy from the market, on your

JAFAR:  Your father's charged me with keeping peace in

JASMINE:    What was the crime?

IAGO:       I can't breathe, Jafar!

JAFAR:  Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.

IAGO:       If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the

JASMINE:    He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!

JAFAR:  (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear!  Oh, why

JASMINE:    What do you mean?

JAFAR:  Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried

JASMINE:    What sentence?

JAFAR:  (with a sinister tone)  Death.  (JASMINE gasps.)

JASMINE:    No!  (She collapses to the floor.)

JAFAR:  I am exceedingly sorry, princess.

JASMINE:    How could you?  (She runs from the room crying.)

(IAGO finally makes it out through the door.  He flies up and lands on

IAGO:       So, how did  it go?

JAFAR:  I think she took it rather well.  (They both get a

(Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying at the edge of the fountain.  RAJAH

JASMINE:    It's all my fault, Rajah.  I didn't even know his

(Cut to int. of dungeon.  Rats scurry by, and we descend until we see

ALADDIN:    (to himself) She was the princess.  I don't believe

ABU:        (from a distance) Yoo-hoo!  Aladdin? Hello!

(ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.)

ALADDIN:    Abu!  Down here!  Hey, c'mon--help me outta these.

(ABU stops, then begins chattering wildly, dropping to the ground.  He

ALADDIN:    Hey, she was in trouble.  Ah, she was worth it.

(ABU jumps up on ALADDIN's shoulders and pulls a small set of tools

ABU:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.

ALADDIN:    Don't worry, Abu.  I'll never see her again.  I'm a

(ABU finally frees ALADDIN's hands.)

ABU:        Ta da!

ALADDIN:    (Rubbing his wrists) I'm a--I'm a fool

OLD MAN:    You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

(We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU

ALADDIN:    Who are you?

OLD MAN:    A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together,

ALADDIN:    I'm listening.

OLD MAN:    There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders.  Filled

(Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word

IAGO:       Jafar, can ya hurry it up?  I'm dyin' in here!

ALADDIN:    But the law says that only a prince can marry--

OLD MAN:    You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you boy?

ALADDIN:    So why would you share all of this wonderful

OLD MAN:    I need a young man with strong legs and a strong

ALADDIN:    Ah, one problem.  It's out there, we're in here?

(The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit.)

OLD MAN:    Mmm, mmm, mmm.,  Things aren't always what they

(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.)

ABU:        Oh, hmm.

(Cut to desert scene.  We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the

CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?

ALADDIN:    It is I, Aladdin.

CAVE:       Proceed.  Touch nothing but the lamp.

(The cave opens up with a roar, and a staircase appears in front of

OLD MAN:    Remember, boy--first fetch me the lamp, and then

ALADDIN:    C'mon, Abu.  (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of

(ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase.  He reaches the bottom

ALADDIN:    Would ya look at that!

ABU:        Uh oh!

ALADDIN:    Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer

(ABU peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it.)

ALADDIN:    Abu!

(ABU stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor.)

ALADDIN:    Don't...touch...anything!  We gotta find that lamp.

(They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises

ABU:        Huh?

(He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor.  He continues, and

ABU:        Aladdin!  Aladdin!

ALADDIN:    Abu, will ya knock it off?

(Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet

ALADDIN:    Abu, what are you--crazy?

(The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.)

ALADDIN:    A magic carpet!  C'mon.  C'mon out.  I'm not gonna

(The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts

ALADDIN:    Take it easy, Abu.  He's not gonna bite.

(The CARPET again picks up ABU's hat and hands it to him.  ABU shakes

ALADDIN:    Hey, wait a minute.  Don't go.  Maybe you can help

(They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant

ALADDIN:    Wait here!

ABU:        Oh.  Huh?

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey.  The outstretched paws hold a

ALADDIN:    This is it?  This is what we came all the way down

(ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to

CAVE VOICE: Infidels!

ABU:            Uh oh!

CAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU

(ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he

ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Carpet, let's move!

(Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling

ALADDIN:    Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off

(CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they

ALADDIN:    Help me out!

OLD MAN:    Throw me the lamp!

ALADDIN:    I can't hold on.  Give me your hand.

OLD MAN:    First give me the lamp!

(ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a

OLD MAN:    Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha!

(ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD

ALADDIN:    What are you doing?

OLD MAN:    Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his

JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! It's mine.  It's all mine! I (He can't

SULTAN: Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What's wrong?

JASMINE:    Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She

SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we'll set it right.

(Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET.

ABU:        Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin.

(CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up.  He awakes slowly.)

ALADDIN:    Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.)

ABU:        Aha!

(ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN:    Why, you hairy little thief!  Looks like such a

GENIE:  Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya

ALADDIN:    Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.

GENIE:  (Says his name as if he's discovered something

ALADDIN:    (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder

GENIE:  (Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog

ALADDIN:    Wait a minute!  I'm--your master?

GENIE:  (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a

DUP. GENIES:    Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,

GENIE:  (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.)

ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Wish fulfillment?

GENIE:  Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the

GENIE:  So what'll it be, master?

ALADDIN:    You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want?

GENIE:  (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost.  There are a

ALADDIN:    Like?

GENIE:  Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody.  (He

ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I tried to tell you.

JAFAR:  So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin
