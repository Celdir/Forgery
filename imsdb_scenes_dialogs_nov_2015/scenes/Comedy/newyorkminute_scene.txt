NEW YORK MINUTE

FADE IN:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN

CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW

MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin

Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after

her but UNSEEN.

She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,

her BREATHING becoming more labored.

Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.

Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten

the leaves.

Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with

beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her

racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.

DREW'S POV - HER OWN FRONT DOOR

and safety loom half a block down. She pours on the

effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the

door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.

ANGLE ON THE SHRUB

where, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN

RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT

HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Drew, wheezing from the exertion, pulls an ASTHMA INHALER

from her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window

in the front door and sees...

DREW'S POV

The puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to

extricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs

it close:

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - PARKER'S ROOM - MORNING

CLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE (with a CLOCK in his belly)

which suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAW

WAGGING.

From under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD,

17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the

shrieking ALARM CLOCK.

With a SIGH, she throws her feet  over the edge of the

bed. Her room is a train wreck.    Grabbing a MatchBox 20

T-shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff.

Good enough. Pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit

concerned down at her navel.

A recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She

touches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins

tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the

source.

She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers:

THOREAU 786:   MADE CRITICAL ERROR LAST P.M.

Parker snickers, types her return from...

NOTATWIN:   CONFESS

THOREAU 786:   DROPPED TRIPLE DEPTH CHARGE AFTER DINNER.

NOTATWIN:   THAT MUCH CAFFEINE IS ILLEGAL IN UTAH.

THOREAU 786: THEN BOUGHT 'NO MONEY DOWN' REAL ESTATE

COURSE AROUND 3:00 A.M.

This makes her smile.

NOTATWIN:   A CAREER MAN.   I LIKE THAT.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection. In

a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer...

... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little

labeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath

where it says, "tweezers."

She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray

eyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her

other eyebrow. Huh. Now they're not even.

CONTINUED:

She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow.

Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and

keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She

reaches for the other side... but suddenly catches

herself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too

psychotic.

She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces

them.

Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit.       Grabbing her

WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth.

Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water

pick. Parker's ENTERED from her side. Drew shuts off

the water pick, dries her face.

Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new

belly ring.

Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt

down.

Drew shivers.

A little BEEP BEEP from her preset WATCH ALARM goes off.

CONTINUED:

Drew turns on her heel and EXITS. When Parker sets her

Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of...

... HER SIDE OF THE    BATHROOM which resembles a post-

apocalyptic toiletry    landscape. There's a very clear

line of demarcation    on the counter like the demilitarized

zone separating the    Koreas.

Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but

notices another message on her Blackberry:

THOREAU 786:     KNOW WHAT TODAY IS?

NOTATWIN:     ANOTHER DAY IN HELL?

THOREAU 786:     TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT.

NOTATWIN:     OUR ANNIVERSARY.    HOW SWEET.

THOREAU 786: SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, MY REAL

NAME'S WARREN COLLIER. IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE CITY, I'D

LOVE TO MEET. GOTTA GO.

Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes

downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein

model-type.

Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces

off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet.

ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking.

Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of

the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered

holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then...

nah.

Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth,

brushes with a finger and spits.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying

her open DAYBOOK.

CONTINUED:

DR. QUINN MacLEOD, dressed professionally and obviously

together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and

her husband, PROFESSOR CHARLEY MacLEOD, who ENTERS still

in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head.

As a matter of routine, Quinn holds out his cup and he

takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper.

Parker ENTERS with her Blackberry in hand, smooches her

pop, then takes a sat.

Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block. Both pour

milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super

Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula. Both

hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar.

Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat

toast that she slices in half first. Like Mom, like

Drew.

Drew spots the BLACKBERRY JPEG of Warren before Parker

can turn it over.

CONTINUED:

Parker looks to her dad.     He shrugs.

CONTINUED:

Everybody stops what they're doing for a BEAT.

Drew CHOKES on her granola and a little milk trickles out

her nose.

Drew is still choking -- pretty badly.

WHOOSH!   The granola goes down and she sucks air.

CONTINUED:

Quinn, the normally thick-skinned M.D., is tearing up.

She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker

follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.

Drew throws an arm around Quinn's other shoulder.

Mom blows her nose.

CONTINUED:

The BEEP BEEP of Drew's alarm WATCH signals time to go.

Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the

news that her mother's going to accompany her.

INT. DREW'S ROOM - MORNING

Drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite. Almost

trembling with tension, she ENTERS and immediately sits

down at her desk with her DAYPLANNER, turning to the

present DATE:

CLOSE ON THE PAGE, WHERE EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IS COLOR-

CODED AND ACCOUNTED FOR RIGHT UP TO...

2:07 -- PROFESSOR QUE SPAULDING, CHAIR, NEW YORK

UNIVERSITY ACCELERATED STUDIES PROGRAM, ADMINISTRATION

BUILDING, SUITE 101.

With a shiver, Drew closes the book, looks up into the

mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself

and tries some self-reassurance.

She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but

something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED.

Collecting her Dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell

phone, she drops them into her matching Coach shoulder bag.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - MacLEOD HOUSE - MORNING

Quinn hops in her Saab.

ANGLE ON the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep

breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned

prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in.

INT. QUINN'S SAAB - CONTINUOUS ACTION

RING! Quinn's CELL PHONE goes off. Quinn looks annoyed,

checks the incoming number. Drew closes her eyes and

prays.

Frustrated, Mom hangs up and with a look of profound

disappointment, turns to Drew.

Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom.

Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss.

CONTINUED:

Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her

mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street.

With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her

shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you."

This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in

her Honda Accord. Drew signals her to stop, so of course

her sister IGNORES HER and jets into the street.

Drew takes off running after the car!

EXT. PHILADELPHIA TRAIN STATION - MORNING

Commuters all jump from their cars and into the station.

INT. THE GIRLS' HONDA - MORNING

Parker pulls up to the curb at the station.       Drew

collects her bag.

Drew pauses, holding the door open.

CONTINUED:

Drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train

station. Parker SIGHS, looks to the BLACKBERRY on the

seat next to her.

INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING

Drew finds a seat.     She neatly folds her jacket and sets

it next to her.

She pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind

her -- just right. Next, she takes out a tiny inflatable

lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap. A pen

goes in the little holder. Coffee from her Thermos.

After laying out her interview materials, she turns to

her reflection in the window.

An EXECUTIVE takes the aisle seat next to her, and after

a sideways glance at Drew's portable office, opens his

Wall Street Journal as the train begins to pull away.

EVERY COMMUTER is quietly reading the paper or staring

off into their own world, wondering why their life has

lead them to this sad moment when...

... they're all distracted by an AWFUL, AWFUL VOICE

singing Sheryl Crow's "Soak Up the Sun." It's Parker,

wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full

train car.

Drew stares at her, dumbfounded.

CONTINUED:

Drew pinches herself too hard.

A look from the Exec reminds Parker of her headphones and

she pulls them off.

CONTINUED:

The EXECUTIVE furrows his brow at Drew -- never?

He goes back to his paper.

Drew's ALARM WATCH BEEPS.

Parker turns to go, then remembers something.

Drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her

sister.

The Executive peers over his spectacles at Parker with

the old paternal reprimand look.

INT. SECOND TRAIN CAR - MORNING

Parker's got her headphones back on and is SINGING Uncle

Cracker's "Follow Me," torturing everyone in her car.

But when she spots the CONDUCTOR ENTERING the front of

the car, she abruptly stops, slips down in he seat and

slides past the COMMUTER LADY next to her into the aisle.

Parker heads the opposite direction from the ticket-

taking Conductor and out the back of the train car.

INT. THE TRAIN - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Parker stands by the door, waiting, listening to hear if

the coast is clear.

Sounds good. She cracks the door, steps out on tiptoes,

closes the door and THERE'S THE CONDUCTOR. He smiles.

EXT. TRENTON STATION PLATFORM - MORNING

Parker's on the platform. The Conductor climbs back on

the train into the FIRST CAR.

This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window,

smiling and giving her a little victory wave.

INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING

The Conductor heads up the aisle -- does a double-take

when he sees Drew.

He takes her by the arm.

Drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little

inflatable lap desk falling to the floor.

ANGLE ON THE PLATFORM

No Parker.

He hauls Drew down the aisle but as they EXIT THE CAR,

SHE BUMPS HEAD-ON INTO BIKE MESSENGER/PRE-MED/MOUNTAIN

CLIMBER/MALE MODEL GUY -- they really do CRACK FOREHEADS,

OUCH!

CONTINUED:

IS DREW SEEING STARS? OR IS IT THE MAGIC OF THIS INSTANT

IN TIME WITH DREAM GUY?

BOTH OF THEM SHAKE OFF THE WOOZIES.     He smiles:

As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and

Dream Guy share a last look before she's...

... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out.

Still no sign of Parker and Drew doesn't have all her

wits about her.

She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. On her

hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket

in the mess.

The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as

it pulls away. He just waves, victorious.

Parker    steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor

spots    her. He looks from one sister to the other --

oops,    mistake. But it's too late. Sheepishly, he climbs

inside    and the train is gone.

Parker steps up from behind her.

Parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but

Drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away.

CONTINUED:

Drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the

ticket counter. The WELT on her forehead is gonna be a

doozey.

But Drew's inside the stationhouse.

Parker follows into the stationhouse.

INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Packed with frustrated COMMUTERS. Drew's standing in a

long line at the ticket counter, steaming, turning a cold

shoulder on...

... Parker, who walks right through to the street side.

EXT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - STREET SIDE - CONTINUOUS

ACTION

Parker steps outside where it's just as crowded. She

scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded

COMMUTERS jostle for the few remaining TAXIS.

TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving match.

To the left, a couple of BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CARS --

standard car service rigs -- sit IDLING, each with a

DRIVER next to it, holding up his sign with his client's

name scratched on it.

An EXECUTIVE (#2) passes her, finger in the air,

signaling the FIRST DRIVER who holds a sign that read:

"Wilcox."

With no further ado, the driver opens the back door for

him, the Exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his

side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind.

Parker raises an eyebrow.    Hm.

The second driver (BENNIE) with a head like a cinder

block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and

holding up a sign, "SCARPELLI."

Parker shoots a finger into the air. This barely gets

his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. Parker signals

again -- one minute -- then turns back inside.

INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION

Drew has reached the counter, where a bitter TRAIN CLERK

who wishes he'd paid attention in school is tired of

angry commuters.

CONTINUED:

Parker arrives in the nick of time, pulling her by the arm.

But Parker drags her away. Drew shoots a look back at

the Clerk, who sticks out his tongue at her.

EXT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Parker pulls Drew toward the Town Car.

But Bennie opens the door for Parker like he's done it a

thousand times.

Drew KNOWS SOME SKETCHY SHIT IS GOING DOWN buy she's only

got this instant to consider. She glances at the

STRANDED MOB descending on a lone approaching CAB,

engulfing it.

Drew lets herself be pulled inside. Bennie shuts the

door and waddles around to his side.

INT. TOWN CAR - MORNING

Parker tries to play cool -- Drew's rigid -- angry and

afraid. Bennie checks his invoice.

CONTINUED:

She checks his Chauffeur's License up front:        Benjamin

Loyola.

Bennie doesn't seem perturbed a bit.

He FIRES UP the LINCOLN and off they go.

Drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's

going on. She leans into her sister and WHISPERS.

CONTINUED:

Just then, Bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on

the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so Drew can

read:

This is when Bennie's CELL PHONE RINGS and he answers it.

Bennie glances into the REARVIEW MIRROR, smiling at the

girls...

... but his smile TURNS DOWN AT THE CORNERS as he

listens. The girls exchange doubtful looks. It gets

worse.

Bennie RAISES THE PRIVACY GLASS but doesn't realize he's

left the intercom button on so they can still hear his

half of the conversation.

The girls are PETRIFIED.

CONTINUED:

YES THEY CAN and they're now scared as hell.

The girls want OUT OF THIS CAR!

Drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it.

Parker sees the LIGHT AHEAD TURN RED.

Just as Bennie brakes for the light, Parker throws her

door open and pulls Drew into the street!

An ONCOMING BUICK LOCKS UP its BRAKES as they dash for

the sidewalk.

EXT. JERSEY SIDEWALK - MORNING

They hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride, race

around the first corner, looking back over their

shoulder.

VRROOOM!   Here comes the Lincoln storming around the

corner.

They run into the first ALLEY and hunker down by a

GARBAGE CAN. The Lincoln flies past. They dash back

out, the same way they came.

SCREECH!   Bennie LOCKS UP the WHEELS!

They round the same corner going the opposite way and

Parker pulls them into the first door...

INT. MINI-MART - MORNING

... where they crouch down the magazine rack. Among the

magazines is DOG FANCY with a picture of a Chinese

Crested Hairless on the cover and the headline: "EMPEROR

DEFENDS CROWN."

Parker peers over the top and out the window.

PARKER'S POV -- slowly, the Lincoln cruises the street,

Bennie scanning the neighborhood for them.

Spooked, they both turn to find a scraggly HOMELESS GUY

with a Slushee in his hand. They stand. Parker reaches

in her pocket.

CONTINUED:

Parker starts to find the Homeless Guy a dollar but Drew

reaches over to stop her...

... just as the Homeless Guy reaches for the dollar and

the SLUSHEE IS KNOCKED FROM HIS HAND.

We watch in SLOW MOTION AS THE SLUSHEE TAKES FLIGHT, THE

CAP FALLING OFF AND THE STICKY, CHERRY RED MESS FANNING

OUT UNTIL...

... BACK TO FAST MOTION -- SPLAT!     IT CATCHES DREW FULL-

FACED, DRENCHING HER.

The Homeless Guy snags the dollar.

And he EXITS.     Parker SNIFFS.

The MINI-MART CLERK approaches them, shaking his head.

Drew appears STUNNED, unable to form words so Parker

speaks for her.

The cherry syrup and cheap wine concoction drips down

Drew's blank face.

INT. BURT'S PUMP 'N' GO - MORNING

BURT, who has no teeth, hands over the restroom key to

the girls. The key is attached to a full-sized STEERING

WHEEL. Burt SNIFFS, wrinkling his nose.

EXT. BURT'S PUMP 'N' GO - MORNING

The girls practically have to drag the key around to the

restroom on the side.

Parker puts the key in and slowly... slowly...

CREAKING... opens the GATES OF HELL

ON THE GIRLS -- WHO STARE IN HORROR INTO THE ABYSS FOR A

BEAT, THEN:

INT. BUS - MORNING

Sitting side by side. A YOUNG MOTHER sits in front of

them with her NINE-MONTH-OLD BABY who's standing on the

seat facing the girls.

Drew's BUMP on her forehead is large and inflamed, her

hair a stringy, ratty mess of booze and red-dye number

four and glucose. She is in a REALLY BAD MOOD, only

staring straight ahead.

Parker's playing peek-a-boo with the baby and trying to

lighten up her sister's mood.

CONTINUED:

BLECCH! The BABY PUKES all over Drew.       She looks

sideways at her sister.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - MORNING

The bus pulls over then pulls away, leaving the girls on

the sidewalk.

CONTINUED:

Drew's suddenly looking at her EMPTY HANDS.

Parker digs in her pockets.

CONTINUED:

Parker looks her sister right in the eye.

Drew takes off her shoe, lifts the inner sole and pulls

out a twenty, then realizes:

Parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads:

THE RITZY PLAZA -- HOURLY RATES, HOT TUBS.

Parker leads them inside.

INT. THE RITZY PLAZA

This looks like a good place to get your throat cut

fighting over a dime's worth of crack.

There's no real       lobby, just a small area to stand at the

"desk" which is       behind iron bars. Behind the iron bars a

rabbit-eared TV       with a busted-in tube houses a dead

houseplant. An        old easy chair leaks stuffing.

CONTINUED:

Above, a BABY SCREECHES. Something BREAKS.        Then a

DISEMBODIED VOICE SPEAKS to them.

The girls look behind them, nobody.       Behind the bars?

Still nobody. What the hell?

There's the sound of something SCRAPING across the floor

and then the MIDGET HOTEL CLERK appears behind the

counter. Now he's standing on a STOOL and we don't know

what he was doing behind the counter.

CONTINUED:

He retrieves a key and holds it up just out of reach

between the bars.

CONTINUED:

He grudgingly holds out the key for Parker, who takes it

and hands it to Drew while she gets the money out.

ON DREW -- sensing something, she looks down at her feet

where a HUGE RAT is licking the sweet stuff off her

shoes.

There's a rather LONG BEAT while this horror sinks in,

then:

Key in hand, Drew makes a beeline out the door.

Parker follows her.

The Desk Clerk jumps off his stool, opens his cage and

follows them into the street.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HOTEL - DAY

Panicked, Drew sprints down the sidewalk with Parker and

the Desk Clerk in tow.

Laying the hammer down, the Desk Clerk blasts past Parker

-- he's a midget, but he's got wheels.

INT. MATERNITY WARD - MORNING

A WOMAN is giving birth. Her husband holds her hand.

Quinn and a nurse are at her feet.

CONTINUED:

But they don't have her attention which is riveted on...

... A TV TUNED TO "THE TODAY SHOW" WHERE WHACK! THE DESK

CLERK DROPS DREW LIKE A SAPP-SACKING GANNON, THROWING

THEM BOTH INTO THE LINE OF AUDIENCE MEMBERS, WHO THEN

TOPPLE LIKE DOMINOES.

EXT. "TODAY SHOW" SIDEWALK - MORNING

"TODAY SHOW" SECURITY GUARDS and NYPD descend on the

crowd.

Parker pulls Drew out of the pile-up and grabs the key,

tossing it away from them, sending the Desk Clerk

scrambling after it.

The two girls HIGH TAIL IT around the corner.       Winded,

they stop.

CONTINUED:

Drew's sucking on her inhaler but is so irate she spits

out the words.

But Parker's not listening.       She's staring intently...

... ACROSS THE STREET where several TOWN CARS are parked,

the DRIVERS chatting next to a HOT DOG/PRETZEL CART.

Among them is Bennie, sipping coffee.       Parker spots him

and freezes.

Parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that Drew

should look across the street.

CONTINUED:

Drew finally turns and she, too, freezes.

Not wanting to draw his attention, the Girls shuffle off

quickly down the street.

ON Bennie -- squinting across at them. Can he make them

out in the crowd? He nods to ANOTHER DRIVER, tosses his

coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel.

The girls break into a run.

She points up at the street sign -- 57th and 5th.   Oops.

Parker leads her into traffic, HORNS BLARING, as they

weave their way across. On the far side, a HORSE

CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute,

Parker spots a fresh pile of...

... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap. Drew,

however, ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT OVER. She closes her

eyes.

Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow

manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT,

we see her surprised face. Hm. I did it.

Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and

puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits

in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass.

This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch

inside some revolving doors.

INT. THE PLAZA - GIRLS' POV - DAY

IN THE STREET, Bennie's getting up, brushing the crap

off. When a CAB HONKS at him, he gives it an Italian

salute and slaps the hood, but when he reaches the curb

it's clear: He's lost the girls.

DREW AND PARKER

CONTINUED:

Her WATCH ALARM BEEPS.

Parker starts to look.

Drew drags her behind a palm. Sure enough, across the

lobby, a guy dressed as PLAINCLOTHES HOTEL SECURITY

(MORTY SESTERO) now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on

them.

The ELEVATOR behind them opens.

The girls slip into the elevator.     When it closes,

Morty's watching.

INT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA - DAY

The girls climb out of the elevator and sneak to the end

of the hall where Parker stops and peers back around the

corner.

CONTINUED:

DOWN THE HALL a door swings open and MR. AND MRS. LO

BIANCHO, wealthy Bostonians, EXIT their suite.

ANOTHER ANGLE

REVEALS -- at the opposite end of the hallway, Parker and

Drew aren't the only ones watching. A PAINTER with one

lazy eye, ROGER, pauses with his roller and carefully

peeks around the corner.

CONTINUED:

The ELEVATOR OPENS       for them and they step in. Parker

RUNS LIKE HELL for       the door of their suite... it's just

about to close when       she SLIDES LIKE PETE ROSE INTO FIRST,

just getting a hand       on it.

She lies there on the floor, holding the door and

WHISPERS LOUDLY to Drew.

ON DREW -- bracing herself, she turns slowly.

INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - DAY

Practically sewn to Parker, Drew follows her into the

suite, both nervous, tiptoeing.

INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY

At the end of the hallway, the PAINTER watches the suite

door close. Hm. What are those girls doing?

INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE

It's lavish, yaddada yaddada.

CONTINUED:

Parker leads her to the big double doors of the master

bedroom and slowly OPENS them.

There, on the bed, is THE EMPEROR, defending champion of

the New York Kennel Club Dog Show. A CHINESE CRESTED

HAIRLESS with his little crown sticking straight up, he

may be the most absurd-looking dog in history. He simply

eyes them. He might even be smiling.

Drew backs away -- she's about to break for the door.

Parker approaches The Emperor.

Happy to give the company, The Emperor practically jumps

into Parker's arms.

She takes him into the living room and moves to the door.

Parker, holding The Emperor, opens the door a crack to

keep a lookout.

PARKER'S POV

The hallway's empty.

But The Emperor, feeling frisky, leaps from her arms into

the hallway, then turns TO face her. Come on. Let's

play!

BACK TO SCENE

Parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to

keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to

spook him into running away from her, she steps into the

hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA

But sure enough, just as she gets close, he turns and

dashes down the hallway.

She chases him down the hallway     and then around the

corner where they have to dodge     cans of paints, a ladder,

until finally The Emperor slides     on some plastic

sheeting, careens into a can of     mauve paint and is

COVERED.

Arms reach down, pick him up and Parker looks up to see

the Painter (ROGER) with the now-mauve Emperor in his

arms.

He turns and RUNS for the stairwell door marked

EXIT. Parker, completely baffled, finally calls after

him:

ANGLE ON THE ELEVATORS AROUND THE CORNER

as they open   and the HOUSE SECURITY GUY (Morty) steps

out, looking both ways and spotting one thing awry...

... a shoe holding open the door to the Lo Bianchos'

suite.

INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - MASTER BATH - DAY

Drew finishes struggling out of the last of her sticky

clothes and gets ONE FOOT IN THE SHOWER WHEN SHE HEARS:

POOR NAKED DREW FREEZES. THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING ON ITS

AXIS. Panicking, she grabs the shower curtain, pulling

it off its hanger and covering herself.

INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The SECURITY GUY snoops toward the bedroom doors. Just

as he reaches for the handle, the door swings open,

SHADOCK, clocking him and dropping him.

Wrapped in the shower curtain, Drew races across the

living room. Just as she reaches the hallway, Parker's

there, also at a dead run and they don't even break

stride.

INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY

They reach the end of the hallway and are TRAPPED.

Only one out. Parker HUFFS OPEN the window to the fire

escape and they climb out...

EXT. PLAZA ALLEY FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY

... and scurry down the stairs only to find that THE

LADDER DOESN'T REACH.

CONTINUED:

Parker hangs and then drops onto the top of a DUMPSTER

with one side of the lid still closed, then jumps to the

alley.

But DREW'S FROZEN WITH FEAR and to complicate matters,

she's struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around

herself.

INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY

Rubbing his sore head, Morty the Security Guy lumbers

down the hallway.

BEHIND HIM Mr. and Mrs. Lo Biancho get out of the

elevator:

But now they both notice the DOOR to their suite is wide

open.

The elderly couple do their version of a panicked run

inside.

CONTINUED:

ON MORTY -- making an abrupt halt. Baby?!          He turns

around and lopes back to the suite.

Morty pulls his RADIO as he backs out the door and heads

down the hall.

CONTINUED:

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE PLAZA - DAY

Drew's still FROZEN on the fire escape.

ANGLE ON THE END OF THE ALLEY

where Roger appears with The Emperor. Surprised        to see

the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen,       but

they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and       he

quietly makes his way to his VAN (painted on the       back and

sides: "Michelangelo's Painting: A Masterpiece         every

time".

CONTINUED:

Roger's VAN SQUEALS AWAY, drawing Parker's attention.

She glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears

around the corner into traffic.

Shutting her eyes, Drew drops onto the closed lid of the

dumpster.

Oops, the curtain starts to slip. When she reaches for

it she loses her balance and suddenly -- FWONK --

nosedives into the dumpster. The curtain floats INTO THE

ALLEY at Parker's feet.

Parker tosses the curtain in and Drew climbs out.        They

hurry off down the alley.

IN THE SECOND STORY FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW -- Morty appears.

MORTY'S POV -- The girls near the end of the alley. A

small dog could easily be concealed under that shower

curtain.

ON THE GIRLS -- running full-tilt, Drew turns to Parker.

WHAM! -- Drew's       CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a

BIKE MESSENGER       who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her,

brakes so hard       he flies off the handlebars and lands

RIGHT ON TOP OF       HER.

CONTINUED:

It's DREAM GUY from the train and for a confused BEAT

they look into each other's familiar faces where we read

recognition, love, unstated chemistry, then:

O.S. SIRENS signal that the police are now involved.

Parker yanks Drew from underneath Dream Guy.

But Parker's got her by the arm and she can only call

back over her shoulder...

... before disappearing into the CROWD on the sidewalk.

AROUND THE CORNER comes Morty who, without time to react,

trips headfirst over Bike Messenger Guy.

EXT. SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF PLAZA - DAY

The girls weave through the PEDESTRIANS but spot a COP

CAR SCREECHING to a halt in front of them and quickly

take a left into...

EXT. THE OTHER ALLEY ADJACENT THE PLAZA - DAY

Where to now? Thinking fast, Parker pulls on a door --

locked -- the next door SWINGS OPEN as if by divine

providence and two HIGH FASHION MODELS step past them out

while the girls step inside.

INT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE - DAY

Chaos. MODELS, DRESSERS, SYCOPHANTS, "I ONLY DATE

MODELS" GUYS and the famous couture fashion designer,

BOBO, are mid-show and friggin' frantic.

Bobo spots the girls coming through the back door and

physically grabs them both, pushing them at the

Showrunner.

This is when he gets a load of Drew's matted hair,

running makeup and shower curtain and does a double-take.

Hm. Does he like it?

The Showrunner shoves Drew one way, Parker the other --

Drew looks at her -- what the hell? Parker CLEARLY

MOUTHS: HAIR! MAKEUP! CLOTHES! and TEAMS OF DRESSERS

virtually surround them.

INSIDE THE MOB OF DRESSERS SURROUNDING DREW the HAIR

STYLIST raises his brush and scissors, but PAUSES.

The rest of the team stops, watching him make his

decision. He shrugs.

CONTINUED:

He excuses himself and the others begin shoving her into

couture.

DRESSING TEAM - A MOMENT LATER

And   the DRESSING TEAM surrounding Parker parts, revealing

her   in a very un-Parker-like, super-chic business suit.

She   catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and rolls

her   eyes. Boring.

The DREW TEAM parts and    we are stunned to see they've

chosen to drape her in a    show-stopping couture FREAK SHOW

OUTFIT that is some sort    of marriage between dominatrix

and nun, complete with a    habit and black leather bikini.

ON PARKER who spots Drew and is, for the first time in

the movie, speechless.

THE NEXT MUSIC CUE COMES UP and the SHOWRUNNER grabs

Drew...

... and pushes her through the curtains and...

INT. RUNWAY - DAY

FLASH go a hundred CAMERAS! Blinded, Drew stumbles

forward on a nine-inch spiked heels down the catwalk.

ON THE AUDIENCE -- ALSO SPEECHLESS.

This is when Drew catches sight of herself on a TV

MONITOR at the end of the walk.

CONTINUED:

Her first instinct is to RUN, but suddenly THE AUDIENCE

HAS DECIDED -- IT'S A SMASH! THEY APPLAUD MADLY! BRAVO!

BRAVO!

Drew recovers herself a bit.        Wow.   They're clapping for

me?

INT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE

Parker's watching through the curtains when she spots

Morty leading two NYPD DETECTIVES (WILLIAMSON AND HOGAN)

through the back door. Uh-oh.

The Showrunner's holding her arm, waiting to throw her

onstage but when Morty turns in her direction, Parker

takes the initiative and...

INT. RUNWAY

... jumps onstage, vamping it down the catwalk like she

was born to it.

Drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the

APPLAUSE and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in

her SCARY SPIKED HEELS when Parker approaches her and...

... throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy

executive! and leans into her sister:

The juxtaposition of the TWO POLAR OPPOSITE OUTFITS

draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into

PAROXYSMS OF APPRECIATION for the inspiration of the

artist and they call him out! Bobo! BOBO! AUTEUR!

BRAVA!

Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the curtains, blowing

kisses and heading for the girls.

Bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their

hands and beginning his bows, but the girls spot Morty

peeking from backstage, and they TAKE OFF, leaping off

the front of the stage into the audience like punks

jumping into the mosh pit.

CONTINUED:

The ADORING CROWD holds them up and they CROWD SURF

toward the rear of the room.

ANGLE ON MORTY

Spotting the commotion, he and the two cops race down the

catwalk. Realizing he'll never get through the crowd,

he, too, leaps off the stage to surf toward them but...

THE CROWD ABRUPTLY PARTS and he does a complete FACE

PLANT.

ANGLE ON THE GIRLS

who bust out the back doors of the large room and

unwittingly...

INT. THE PLAZA - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

... right back into The Plaza lobby.

Unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they

have to pass by...

... the PLAZA MANAGER and the other HOUSE SECURITY AGENT,

BRUCE (butch haircut, bad suit), consoling Mrs. Lo

Biancho.

When MORTY and the COPS come through the doors behind

them, however, there's no choice.

The girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible

heading for the revolving doors but they overhear:

CONTINUED:

Morty spots the girls across the lobby just as they reach

the revolving doors.

Bruce looks over to Morty like he's speaking Slavic, but

Morty's furiously pointing and Bruce sees...

THE GIRLS break for the revolving doors. Parker gets

there first, plunges in so fast that a MAN ENTERING is

tossed headlong into the lobby.

Drew tries to time the quickly-spinning door but one of

the very high SPIKED HEELS catches, throwing her forward

and sandwiching her in the revolving door.

OUTSIDE -- Parker sees Drew caught in the door as Bruce,

Morty and the cops close in. Quickly, Parker pushes the

door back, releasing Drew, who jumps in and swings out.

EXT. THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Then, Parker HEAVES THE DOOR WITH ALL HER MIGHT, spinning

it so fast the security guys and cops can't jump in.

INT. LOBBY OF THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The four men all stand there, watching the spinning door.

CONTINUED:

Then, just    to their right, an ELDERLY WOMAN walks through

the regular    door just adjacent the revolving doors. All

four share    a sheepish look -- uh, maybe we should have

thought of    that -- then BOLT outside.

EXT. THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The police and security look left, right, across the

street.

Morty and Bruce take the cop's order and race off in

separate directions. Neither Hogan nor his partner

moves.

Williamson and Hogan step over to a hot dog cart set up

next to a NEWSPAPER STAND.

CONTINUED:

The cops giggle at this.

ANGLE ON THE NEWS STAND

where a BLIND CASHIER (SPEEDY) smiles at the two

policemen.

ANOTHER ANGLE

REVEALS Drew and Parker, crouched down behind the counter

right next to Speedy.

The cops head back to The Plaza.

CONTINUED:

With the Detectives gone, Speedy turns up his nose and

waves the air, fanning away a bad smell.

Drew checks her watch.

CONTINUED:

A BEEP BEEP indicates Parker's BLACKBERRY is receiving a

message.

Parker reads the incoming MESSAGE from...

THOREAU 786:     HOW'D CHEM TEST GO?

But Parker's typing furiously even as Drew rants on --

she has to lean around Speedy's legs. A GUY buying a

newspaper peers down at the strange sight.

The guy pays for his paper, leaves.

NOTATWIN: WARREN. MY REAL NAME'S PARKER MACLEOD.         MY

SISTER AND I NEED A FAVOR.

Drew reaches for the Blackberry.

CONTINUED:

THOREAU 786:     PARKER.   THANKS FOR SHARING.   ANYTHING YOU

NEED.

NOTATWIN: BIT OF A JAM IN THE CITY. MOB, POLICE AND

HOTEL SECURITY ON OUR TAIL. COULD USE A HIDEOUT.

THOREAU 786: LOL!      ADVENTUROUS TYPE.   MEET ME AT WORK?

I'M AT THE U.N.

NOTATWIN:     UNITED NATIONS?

THOREAU 786:     JUST A DAY JOB.    JOIN THE 11:00 TOUR.

SOON.

Parker pockets the Blackberry.

Speedy opens the rear door of the newsstand.

CONTINUED:

Drew SIGHS, then reluctantly follows Parker out.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - CHARLEY'S STUDY

Head thrown back, mouth wide open, still in his        bathrobe,

Charley sleeps in the chair directly in front of        his

laptop. The SCREENSAVER, an animated version of         Jack

Nicholson in THE SHINING, just keeps typing "All        work and

no play..."

When the PHONE RINGS it nearly knocks him out of his

chair. He hunts it down through the MAELSTROM on his

desk.

He glances at the screensaver, the same words pouring

out.

CONTINUED:

Charley smells his armpit.       Ripe.   He'll need a quick

shower.

Charley hangs up, punches a key on his computer.       The

screensaver disappears and up pops a BLANK PAGE.       At the

top: CHAPTER ONE. Nothing else.

INT. CHARLEY'S '77 FORD PICKUP - DAY

Charley's driving,      eating a sandwich and dialing his CELL

PHONE at the same      time, veering dangerously and

obliviously across      the center stripe. The oncoming CAR

careens out of his      way in a blaze of HORN.

He hangs up and of course veers into the other lane

again, correcting wildly before resuming his merry way.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - LO BIANCHOS' PRIVATE BOX

Far below, Garden employees set      up for the dog show.

Inside, the Lo Bianchos' luxury      box is likewise being

prepared. In one corner, Bruce       and Morty are fumbling

with the unfamiliar electronic      tracing gear, readying for

the ransom call.

Mrs. Lo Biancho turns up her nose at the buffet table.

CONTINUED:

A SOCIETY FRIEND of Mrs. Lo Biancho, BABS, arrives to pay

her respects, shuffling her feet across and leaning in to

trade air kisses.

When she turns on Morty and Bruce, they both jump a

little.

Babs nabs one of the rumaki on her way out. As soon as

Babs is gone, Mrs. Lo Biancho looms over Morty and Bruce.

CONTINUED:

A troubled Bruce isn't having much luck operating the

trace machine.

EXT. SIDEWALK IN NEW YORK - DAY

The girls try to be as inconspicuous as possible walking

cross-town in couture, Drew with only one shoe and in a

bad mood.

CONTINUED:

Drew didn't want to admit that -- it just slipped out

under pressure.

A block away, the United Nations building stands

majestically against the sky.

CONTINUED:

Directly in front of them, however, a POLICE CAR is

stopped at the light with two uniformed POLICEMEN inside.

The girls spot the Police and stop.

The Police look up at the girls through their windshield.

INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

Their on-board FAX is spitting out an APB PHOTO. The

POLICEMAN on the passenger side pulls it off and holds it

up.

ON THE PHOTO -- IT'S DREW STUCK IN THE REVOLVING DOOR OF

THE PLAZA WITH PARKER PULLING HER THROUGH.

He shows the PHOTO to his PARTNER who's driving.

But when they look up:

POLICEMAN'S POV

-- the girls are gone. They don't take much notice of a

HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE passing them with the DRIVER up

front and TWO TOURISTS kissing in the back.

BACK TO SCENE

As the carriage clops past, however, the Policemen don't

notice the Girls -- both clinging to the back.

INT. DETECTIVES' CAR - DAY

Hogan and Williamson are eating sandwiches but they've

paused to listen:

Hogan picks up the radio while Williamson FIRES UP the

CAR.

Zoom!   Williamson blasts crosstown.

EXT. U.N. PLAZA - DAY

The Horse Carriage passes the usual groups of PROTESTORS

and TOURISTS outside on the U.N. Plaza and...

... the Girls jump off and move into the crowd, headed

for the ENTRANCE where there's a LINE at the door.

DOWN THE BLOCK the Detectives' unmarked car appears and

parks at the curb.

Williamson and Hogan climb out, scanning the crowd.

DETECTIVES' POV

-- just a glimpse as they ENTER the building.

BACK TO SCENE

INT. ENTRANCE TO U.N. - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The Girls pass through the metal detector and move toward

a small group of TOURISTS waiting by the sign that reads:

NEXT TOUR 11:00.

Parker consults the JPEG PIC on her Blackberry, then

scans the group.

At the head of the group, the U.N. TOUR GUARD, geeky in a

Clark Kent way and nice enough looking but definitely not

a male model, leans into a petite BRUNETTE and her LITTLE

SISTER.

The Brunette looks at him like he's a serial killer.

Her fierce-looking BABUSHKA MOM gets in the Tour Guide's

face.

This is when Drew notices Williamson and Hogan ENTERING

and approaching a U.N. SECURITY GUIDE, flashing their

badges.

CONTINUED:

The Tour Guide, WARREN COLLIER, looks over at them.

Warren moves back to Drew and Parker.

But Williamson and Hogan, led by the U.N. Security Guy,

ENTER the lobby.

Drew grabs Warren by the arm and turns him.

Parker looks Warren right in the eye.     This is a test.

Warren leads them into a small adjoining office...

INT. TOUR GUIDE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

... where another TOUR GUIDE is taking a break.

CONTINUED:

Drew grabs Angie by the collar, lifts her up.

Angie heads out to take the tour.        Parker turns on

Warren.

CONTINUED:

Parker opens the office door, peeking out.

ANGLE ON WILLIAMSON AND HOGAN

who Parker can't see because her line of sight is blocked

by the office door.

BACK TO DREW AND WARREN

CONTINUED:

With Warren leading the way, they EXIT the office.

INT. U.N. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

The three make their way across the vast lobby, but

before they reach the main hall...

Almost instinctively, they go COMPLETELY SEPARATE WAYS,

Warren and Parker breaking left, Drew right.

Drew makes a mad dash down a hallway, makes a turn,

another turn, working her way deeper into the labyrinth.

Even while running frantically, she tries to smile

politely at everyone she passes until she spots a WOMEN'S

room and quickly ditches inside.

INT. U.N. - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She hurriedly crosses, enters a stall, locks the door and

puts her feet up. She tries to catch her breath.

GROANS OF PAIN ECHO from the stall next to her.

Somebody's in BAD SHAPE.      Another HEART-RENDING GROAN

can't be ignored.

CONTINUED:

A FILE FOLDER comes skidding from under the stall.

What can she possibly do?

Drew EXITS the stall and goes to the door.

Drew peeks out the door.       It looks clear.   Out she goes.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MAILROOM

On the run, Warren and Parker ditch through a door marked

MAILROOM. A BEAT LATER, Hogan appears from around the

corner.

INT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vacant and quiet. The DOOR OPENS SLOWLY and Hogan

ENTERS. It's a small room with a few canvas mail sacks

piled in a corner and a wall of mail-sorting cubbies.

An in-house MONITOR mutely broadcasts the now empty

ASSEMBLY ROOM.

Nothing here, Hogan closes the door. IN A BEAT, one of

the mail sacks wriggles and Warren sticks his head up.

Parker pops up from the same sack. Face to face, there's

an awkward moment of attraction between them.

INT. U.N. ASSEMBLY - DAY

Drew peeks in through the door, reading the COUNTRY

IDENTIFICATIONS on the desks... Bangkok, Borneo,

Bulgaria... Canada.

The REPRESENTATIVES are in the middle of a heated DEBATE

that we hear being translated (and we see in subtitles).

CONTINUED:

The CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE is sitting gingerly in his

chair, shifting uncomfortably. He looks pale, shaky.

Drew commits herself and rushes down the stairs to his

desk with the file.

He puts a hand to his stomach -- he's struggling.

Even as she holds out the file, he races past her,

puckering his bum.

She watches him waddle up the stairs BUT AS HE EXITS, HE

PASSES WILLIAMSON AND THE U.N. SECURITY GUY IN THE

DOORWAY.

Drew sees them. Uh, oh. The only thing she can do to

make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the Canadian

Rep's chair and turn her back on them like she's one of

the Assembly members. She sits up, shuffles the files

around.

Glancing furtively to either side, she sees that everyone

else is wearing the TRANSLATION EARPHONE. She puts one

on.

ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVE

Williamson's gaze comes to rest on...

... THE BACK OF DREW'S HEAD.         Hm.   That looks familiar.

This is when the CHINESE REP stands, furious, and points

an accusatory finger at Drew!

ALL EYES TURN TO DREW.

CONTINUED:

These are fighting words. The Assembly grows SILENT.

Drew wishes she could BEAM HERSELF somewhere off planet.

She gulps air. Glances left, right.

BUT SHE KNOWS THE DETECTIVE'S EYES ARE ON THE BACK OF HER

HEAD AND SO SHE CLEARS HER THROAT AND:

This furrows some brows.

Ah, yes, some knowing nods.

ON THE NORTH KOREAN REPRESENTATIVE leaning over to confer

with the NORWEGIAN REPRESENTATIVE:

BACK ON DREW

Uhhh... where now? She notices the FILE the Rep in the

bathroom gave her and holds it up, shaking it for

emphasis.

CONTINUED:

This draws a CHORUS OF MURMURS throughout the hall. The

Chinese Rep suddenly looks terribly worried and pauses to

confer with his ASSOCIATE.

INT. U.N. - MAILROOM

Parker's peeking through the door, checking the hallway.

Warren points to the MONITOR. Parker's jaw drops.         Her

sister is addressing the entire U.N. Assembly.

INT. U.N. ASSEMBLY - DAY

Drew glances Williamson EXITING.

Like Cinderella at Midnight, she turns and races up the

stairs as the Assembly is in complete turmoil -- KOFI

ANAN BANGS his gavel.

INT. LOBBY OF THE U.N. ASSEMBLY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Drew busts through the doors just as Warren and Parker

come running with the Detectives chasing them. The three

of them make for the front door but a TOUR GROUP comprised

of a hundred young JAPANESE GIRLS blocks their EXIT.

Warren thinks fast and YELLS IN JAPANESE.

SCREAMING LIKE BANSHEES, the Japanese Girls all pour

outside, Warren and the Girls following.

EXT. U.N. PLAZA - DAY

Once outside, he YELLS AGAIN.

The JAPANESE GIRLS turn around and STORM BACK THROUGH THE

DOORS, blocking Williamson and Hogan's EXIT.

The three of them run for the line of taxis.

Warren grabs a Taxi door.

Williamson and Hogan have fought their way out through

the little Japanese Girls.

Realizing they won't reach Parker and Drew in time, they

head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just

ahead of...

Bennie's TOWN CAR. He's holding the door for a cigar-

chewing CLIENT but watching the Girls climb into the cab

up ahead.

INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS ACTION

They jump into the back seat, Warren in the middle.

Parker leans urgently into the DRIVER:

The TAXI pulls away from the curb.

INT. DETECTIVE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Williamson FIRES UP the CRUISER.

They pull into traffic, following the Cab.

In a BEAT, Bennie's Town Car follows, too.

INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Parker leans across Warren to Drew.

CONTINUED:

CONTINUED:

Oops. This just slipped out in anger.        Parker's brain

has to adjust, then:

Drew is near tears.

CONTINUED:

A look from Parker quiets Warren.       Drew's choked up.    She

just nods, yes.

Drew wipes her tears, then:

She opens the door and jumps out!

Parker starts to open her door on the TRAFFIC SIDE! HONK

HONK! It's nearly SHEARED OFF by a passing truck and she

closes it just in time.

CONTINUED:

As the taxi bogs down in traffic, Drew disappears around

the corner up ahead.

EXT. BLOCK NORTH OF THE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Tears running, Drew's walking too quickly for the one

stupid shoe. She nearly turns her ankle.

This is when she sees, parked just down the block...

ROGER'S VAN with "Michelangelo's Painting" across the

back door.

Drew quickly steps into the shadow of a doorway to keep

out of sight and watch the van.

A BLOCK BEHIND THE TAXI --

INT. DETECTIVE'S CAR - SAME TIME

Williamson and Hogan have the same problem with the

traffic and can't see clearly what's going on up ahead.

CONTINUED:

INT. ROGER'S VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Roger dials a cell phone while The Emperor stands on the

passenger seat with his front paws on the dash. As far

as we can tell, he's having a great time being kidnapped

and doesn't mind being mauve.

The Emperor ignores him, happily watching the streets of

New York go by.

But his CALL has gone through.        He imitates a GIRL'S

VOICE.

INT. LO BIANCHOS' BOX (MADISON SQUARE GARDEN) -

CONTINUOUS ACTION

Mrs. Lo Biancho calmly answers her cell phone.

Morty and Bruce have their tracing gear rigged to her

phone but have to keep following her around the box.

CONTINUED:

She looks to her husband, who consults his watch and then

holds up ONE FINGER.

Bruce SIGNALS her -- keep him on the line!

She hangs up.     Bruce and Morty SIGH.

INT. ROGER'S VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Roger looks at the phone. It wasn't supposed to go like

that. He looks at The Emperor.

He glances at his watch.      He believes Mrs. Lo Biancho and

is PANICKING.

INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Parker and Warren are scanning the sidewalk ahead for

Drew.

CONTINUED:

They turn right.

INT. ROGER'S VAN

He hits redial.       Mrs. Lo Biancho answers.

CONTINUED:

She hangs up.        Roger does, too.

EXT. BLOCK NORTH OF THE GARDEN

Drew watches as Roger climbs out, looks up and down the

street, then moves around to the passenger side, grabs

The Emperor and drops him into a gym bag.

AT THE END OF THE BLOCK -- SPECTATORS for the New York

Kennel Club Dog Show have begun filing into the Garden.

Ever wary, Roger carries The Emperor under one arm. The

Emperor pokes his nose out. Roger pushes it back in.

The dog pokes it back out.

Whoosh! From behind, DREW GRABS THE EMPEROR and takes

off running.

Holding The Emperor at arm's length, Drew makes a run for

it with Roger after her.

ON DREW -- LOOKING RIGHT INTO THE SMILING MAUVE FACE OF

THE EMPEROR.

She and Roger race right past...

... Mr. Lo Biancho, holding out the Saks bag of money.

CONTINUED:

Puzzled, Mr. Lo Biancho falls in line behind Roger,

keeping up pretty well for an old dude with a gut.

ANGLE ON THE END OF THE BLOCK

WHERE PARKER'S TAXI APPEARS.

INT. TAXI - WARREN'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD -

CONTINUOUS ACTION

DREW'S RUNNING RIGHT AT THEM DOWN THE SIDEWALK WITH THE

EMPEROR!

INT. DETECTIVE'S CAR - DAY

They round the corner behind Parker and Warren.

Drew blows past them, holding The Emperor. The

Detectives exchange glances -- nice hunch -- and they

LEAP OUT OF THE CAR TO JOIN THE CHASE.

INT. BENNIE'S TOWN CAR - DAY

Just as he turns the corner, the PARADE PASSES HIM.   What

the hell?

EXT. BLOCK NORTH OF THE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The Emperor's having the time of his life. He licks

Drew's face joyfully as she weaves through the growing

crowd.

DREW'S DOG-SLOBBERED POV

REVEALS A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN doing security at the

DELIVERY ENTRANCE to the Garden, where SHOW PARTICIPANTS,

wheeling their DOG KENNELS, are being checked in by two

SHOW OFFICIALS.

BACK TO SCENE

Drew draws a bead on THE POLICEMAN, determined to reach

him and hand over The Emperor:

But SHOW OFFICIAL #3 appears from inside, taps the

Policeman on the shoulder -- they need him inside.   He

turns and goes through the door just as...

... Drew reaches the loading dock and hustles up the

stairs.

She sprints past the other SHOW OFFICIALS checking in

CONTESTANTS.

INT. BACKSTAGE (MADISON SQUARE GARDEN DOG SHOW) -

CONTINUOUS ACTION

Drew has entered HER OWN PERSONAL CIRCLE OF HELL -- DOGS

OF EVERY SHAPE AND SIZE SURROUND HER.

A GROOMER combing a HOUND DOG points toward the CURTAINS

on the far side of the room and she blasts off that

direction.

CONTINUED:

CLOSE ON THE HOUND DOG -- lifting his big nose in the

air, he sniffs mightily and then...

BAYING LIKE HE'S COON HUNTING UNDER A KENTUCKY MOON, the

Hound Dog leaps off his table, heads after Drew.

EXT. LOADING DOCK (MADISON SQUARE GARDEN) - CONTINUOUS

ACTION

CHAOS.

The TWO SHOW OFFICIALS,    sporting nifty sweaters and

manicures, are prepared    to sacrifice their lives to block

the door. In addition     to the PARTICIPANTS trying to get

inside, they're holding    off Roger, Mr. Lo Biancho,

Williamson and Hogan.

At the mention of POLICE, Roger's EYES GO WIDE. He

slinks down, losing himself in the crowd and sidles off.

AT THE CORNER, Parker and Warren keep their distance, not

wanting to be seen by the Detectives.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She is -- but now she's not running to catch a policeman,

but to try to keep from being over-taken by...

... A GIANT PACK OF PEDIGREED POOCHES WHO CHASE DREW

ACROSS THE SHOW FLOOR.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - LO BIANCHOS' BOX

The ROAR of the CROWD and the BARKING of the PACK

draw the attention of everyone in the Lo Bianchos'

box.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

Drew makes it across the floor and out the other side

into a tunnel...

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONCESSION AREA

... appearing in the concession area.

ANGLE ON A SHIH-TZU

as it breaks off, jumps onto a concession stand and

begins looting it.

Drew makes for the EXIT past the TICKET TAKERS who leap

out of the way and just as she reaches the door and

pushes it open...

EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FRONT ENTRANCE -

CONTINUOUS ACTION

THEY CATCH UP TO HER IN A SWARM, KNOCKING HER ONTO THE

SIDEWALK OUTSIDE WHERE SHE DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH A

MOUNTAIN OF DOGS!

Williamson, Hogan, Morty, Bruce, Mr. and Mrs. Lo Biancho

and quite a few SPECTATORS pour out the doors.

ANGLE DOWN ON DREW

STILL HUGGING THE EMPEROR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK, ALL

OF WHOM GLEEFULLY LICK HER FACE!

DREW'S POV

The Detectives appear above her.

BACK TO SCENE

She holds up The Emperor.

As the other OWNERS and HANDLERS gather their dogs,

Williamson hands The Emperor off to Mrs. Lo Biancho while

Hogan handcuffs Drew.

Williamson and Hogan move Drew toward their car.

CONTINUED:

Just as they push her head down into the car, she

glimpses a vaguely familiar face among the myriad GAWKERS

-- it's the Bike Messenger. For just an instant they

lock eyes before the car pulls away.

DOWN THE STREET

Parker and Warren round the corner at a run, only in time

to watch the Detective's car leave with Drew in the back

window.

With a SIGH, they turn to go and BUMP -- knock into

Bennie, who's staring coldly down at Parker.

She's paralyzed with fear.

CONTINUED:

Bennie appears unmoved. Parker closes her eyes, trying

to meet death with dignity.

She opens one eye.

Indicating Warren.

Bennie hands Parker Drew's daybag.      Parker takes it,

still trying to comprehend.

CONTINUED:

Bennie waddles over to his Town Car and climbs in.

Parker looks at the daybag.

But now Parker's mind is elsewhere.     She pulls out Drew's

daybook, opens it.

INT. JAIL BOOKING ROOM - DAY

FLASH! A MUGS HOT is taken of Drew, looking as

bedraggled, beaten and defeated as humanly possible.

DREW

staring at her INK-STAINED FINGERS as Hogan finishes

fingerprinting her other hand.

CONTINUED:

He hands her a towel to wipe them off. We know that

dirty hands would drive the old Drew crazy. This Drew

merely tosses the towel into the garbage. Who gives a

crap?

INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

Drew sits among other FEMALE CRIMINALS, staring zombie-

like.

An INMATE with freaky frazzled red hair and a whacked out

look in her eye sidles over to Drew.

OFF Drew's look of complete spiritual resignation we --

EXT. NYU - DAY

Warren and Parker leap from a cab and hustle across

campus. In only a few strides, Parker's dusting him.

CONTINUED:

INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

Red points at Drew's one shoe.

She hands the high heel to Red, who enthusiastically

pulls it on and models it.

Hogan ENTERS, opens the cell door.

Hogan takes her by the arm in a fatherly way and leads

her out.

INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY

Hogan leads her into the lobby where Bike Messenger Guy

is waiting. He stands up when he sees Drew. Her

dissonance is even more confounded now.

CONTINUED:

Hogan leaves them alone.       Bike Guy steps over.

As an answer, Drew merely points to herself -- look at

me? Now answer for yourself.

Reminded, Drew puts a hand to her face.

Suddenly, realizing just how awful she must look, Drew

becomes self-conscious.

She walks past him out the door.

EXT. NYPD STATION HOUSE - DAY

Jim catches up to her.

CONTINUED:

Drew looks at her watch.

EXT. NYU ADMINISTRATION BUILDING

Parker's on the stairs with Drew's DAYBOOK open, staring

into it like someone who has a final exam in two minutes

but forgot to show up for the semester.

Warren's looking over her shoulder.

Parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass.

Working herself into Drew form, she puts her hair into a

conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture.

CONTINUED:

INT. NYU ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - CLOSE ON A HAND

about to knock on a door that reads "Professor Que

Spaulding, PhD" when the door suddenly opens and the last

INTERVIEWEE steps out in a suit and tie, confidence

oozing.

Parker nods primly as he passes, then steps inside.

INT. OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

A SECRETARY sits at her computer.        She looks over her

glasses at Parker.

CONTINUED:

This is when the inner office door swings open and the

PROFESSOR himself, coat over one arm, briefcase in the

other, steps out.

Parker positions herself directly in front of him,

cutting off his EXIT.

He tries to make a move.      Parker blocks him.

The Professor hesitates for just an instant, giving

Parker her opening. She grabs his hand, giving it a

vigorous, Young Republican shake.

EXT. NYU CAMPUS - DAY

STUDENTS leisurely make their way between classes.

CONTINUED:

The Students dive out of the way as Jim comes barreling

across campus with Drew clinging for life to his

handlebars.

Just outside the Administration Building, Jim hits the

brakes and Drew FLIES OFF THE HANDLEBARS and like the

puppy in the opening, disappears into a shrub.

The old Drew is back.     She scrambles out of the

shrub...

... and up the stairs -- then stops, turns.

She launches herself into the building.

INT. PROFESSOR SPAULDING'S OFFICE - DAY

Parker sits genteelly forward in her chair, legs crossed

just so at the ankles, hands folded in her lap.

CONTINUED:

A FUSS from the OUTER OFFICE interrupts them and suddenly

the door bursts open and Drew BURSTS IN:

The Professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but

by Drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look.

Drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a

face full of Parker, already there.

CONTINUED:

Seeing her plan to help Drew go awry, poor Parker's lip

trembles.

CONTINUED:

CONTINUED:

Drew stops, ponders this deeply.

Then she smiles, only a teensy bit.

This is the first moment in a long time when the sisters

share a smile. Drew turns to the Professor.

CONTINUED:

Drew takes her DAYBOOK from Parker and drops it in the

wastebasket.

Parker looks horrified at the sight of Drew's daybook in

the trash and fishes it out.

He shakes her hand.

EXT. NYU ADMINISTRATION BUILDING

Warren and Jim sit waiting when the Girls come out,

smiling.

Drew turns to Parker.

The sisters hug, but we GO...

CONTINUED:

CLOSE ON PARKER -- EYES WIDE.

Parker grabs Warren by the hand and blasts around the

corner just as...

Charley MacLeod pulls up in his truck and parks half on,

half off the curb.

He leans over, waving to Drew.

Drew goes over to the truck.

Drew goes back to Jim.

CONTINUED:

Drew leans over and kisses him on the cheek.         Then she

reaches into her bag and pulls out a card.

She smiles, shrugs and climbs in her dad's truck. They

pull away, leaving Jim waving. When they're out of

sight, Parker and Warren come back around the corner of

the building.

Warren pulls out a CELL PHONE, hits speed dial.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Passing over the City, Warren and Parker are strapped in,

headphones on, and have to talk above the DIN.

INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - EVENING

Both girls are putting on makeup, getting ready to go

out. Everything appears the same as before, Drew's side

neat and clean, Parker's a wreck.

CONTINUED:

Quinn steps in, grimfaced.

The Girls share a look.       Busted.

Quinn holds out her hand revealing a BELLY RING.

There's almost a palpable sense of relief between the

girls. They BOTH LOOK DOWN and pull up their shirts --

Parker's not the only one who has her naval pierced --

Drew does, too.

She holds out her other hand, which has an envelope.

They stare at the envelope -- NYU ADMISSIONS DEPARTMENT.

There's a HONK.

CONTINUED:

Parker and Quinn stare at Drew.

Parker and Quinn simply continue to stare.

INT. MacLEOD LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Charley's laying on the couch with some chips on his

stomach watching the game.

Jim and Warren are watching, too.

Jim and Warren share a look.        This is a story best left

untold.

Charley smiles.       He's not as out of it as he appears.

Suddenly, all three women SCREAM JOYFULLY O.S.
