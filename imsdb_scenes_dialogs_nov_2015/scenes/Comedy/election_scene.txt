ELECTION by Alexander Payne & JIM Taylor

Third Draft July 22,1997

Based on the novels by Tom Perotta

EXT. MILLARD HIGH -- DAWN

The school stretches out before us, slumbering in the overcast morning

air.

Along the front sidewalk, a lone JANITOR trundles a garbage bin filled

with overstuffed hefty bags.

A weathered FORD ESCORT pulls into the empty PARKING LOT and comes to

a stop near the athletic field.

A TEENAGE GIRL'S VOICE -

JIM MCALLISTER, a teacher in his mid to late-thirties, emerges from

the car in running clothes and carrying a briefcase, gym bag, and

coffee mug.  On his way to the field, he crosses paths with the

janitor.

Lowell nods, hoists a bag and tosses it into a dumpster.

EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD -- DAWN

JIM CIRCLES THE TRACK, sweating and panting.

ON THE GROUND JIM does sit ups

He collapses onto his back.  His head rolls to one side, and he

glances past the fence at --

THE PARKING LOT

Where a second CAR is just arriving.  JIM watches as TRACY FLICK, a

junior, and her MOTHER get out.

The mother helps remove a CARD TABLE and a big plastic sack from the

trunk before Tracy heads toward the school.

JIM turns his gaze toward the sky, closes his eyes, sighs.

INT.    BOYS'    LOCKER   ROOM   --   DAY

Naked in the showers, JIM pumps liquid soap from the wall- mounted

metal dispenser.

INT.   HILLARD   HALL  DAY

THE LEGS OF A CARD TABLE - as Tracy spreads them open and locks them

into place.

STICKS OF GUM from a Plen-T-Pack are emptied into a FISHBOWL-

SCOTCH TAPE is wrapped around the end of a pen to attach a piece of

string

INT. BOYS' LOCKER ROOM	DAY

AT THE MIRROR

JIM adjusts the knot of his tie, notices a little shaving cream in his

ear.

INT. MILLARD HALL	DAY

FOUR CLIPBOARDS  with pens and lined sheets of paper are being placed

in a row like little soldiers. The top of every sheet reads "Tracy

Flick for President: Official Nomination Signatures."

INT. FACULTY LOUNGE -- MORNING

AT THE REFRIGERATOR

JIM tries to place his lunch inside, but the shelves are too crammed

with old take-out containers. He opens one and smells it. Disgusted,

he drags a garbage can over and begins throwing things away.

Lowell appears in the doorway wheeling his squeaky maintenance cart

and watches JIM conduct his purge as A CHINESE FOOD BOX misses the can

and rolls on the floor.

INT. MILLARD HALLWAY -- DAY

Tracy is seated behind her card table strategically placed near the

school's main entrance.  A sign taped to the wall behind her reads,

TRACY FOR PREZ.  SIGN UP FOR TOMORROW, TODAY!  She checks her watch,

readies herself.

JIM walks around the corner whistling vaguely.

An awkward moment passes between them.

AS JIM turns and walks away, Tracy watches him.  He stops and picks up

some litter, tosses it in a nearby garbage can.

INT. JIM'S CLASSROOM	DAY

Alone in his room, JIM studies the Omaha World-Herald

After laying the paper down to circle an article, JIM leans back in

his chair and momentarily loses himself in thought.

Suddenly a VOICE --

JIM glances OUT THE WINDOW and sees a kid -- PAUL METZLER -- pointing

at him. Paul walks with a LIMP. Behind him, other STUDENTS approach

the school.

JIM enjoys the affectionate joshing and gives the kid  a wave. He

returns to his newspaper, a contented man.

EXT. MILARD HIGH FOOTBALL STADIUM	-- NIGHT

JIM sits in the bleachers, clapping his  hands  over his head.

INT. MILLARD GYM    DAY  AT A PEP RALLY -

JIM is dressed as a WESTERN VILLAIN, and his black hat reads "Lincoln

South." With a menacing grimace he approaches a group of FOOTBALL

PLAYERS at a poker table.

A CORNER OF THE SCHOOL    DAY

JIM has a comforting hand of the shoulder of a CRYING GIRL

INT. AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT

JIM trots up the stairs to receive a plaque. He beams.

INT. JIM'S CLASSROOM -- DAY

Mr. McAllister reads aloud from the newspaper as he paces in front of

his class of high school juniors, Tracy Flick among them. The seats

are arranged in a SEMI-CIRCLE.

JIM slaps the newspaper for emphasis and addresses the class

Tracy shoots her hand into the air.  JIM notices but keeps looking

around.

Other hands rise tentatively

Tracy's hand goes higher.

JIM weighs the answer, tries to be encouraging.

FREEZE FRAME on Tracy, her hand lowering, her mouth agape.

INT. STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM -- DAY -- ONE YEAR PREVIOUS

JIM sits to one side, monitoring the student council MEETING about to

convene.  A younger Tracy enters briskly and, unlike her casual teen

comrades, has made an attempt to dress for success.  She takes a seat

right up front and opens her backpack.

After preparing her notepad and pen, Tracy puts a MICROCASSETTE

RECORDER on the table in front of her and pushes RECORD.

JIM observes Tracy, trying to size her up.

ON TRACY -- putting all her little things in order, finally folding

her hands to wait.

A FAST-PACED MONTAGE BEGINS UNDER TRACY'S VOICE-OVER:

INSERT	HILLARD HIGH YEARBOOK It fans open to the INDEX.

PAN DOWN to Tracy's name followed by countless page references

A page number turns BOLD, and the other numbers drop away

Suddenly we are on that page, and we PAN to a headline: "Spanish Club

says Oh La!"

PAN to the group shot and ZOOM in on Tracy smiling in a big SOMBRERO.

We see Tracy on other pages too: "Yearbook Staff goes for it!" "Junior

Achievers put on the dog!" "Student Council meets the challenge;"

Oklahoma's a hit!

The STILL of Tracy in Oklahoma suddenly COMES TO LIFE.

INT. MILLARD HIGH AUDITORIUM	NIGHT

On stage, Tracy wears a cowgirl outfit and hams it up with exaggerated

gestures.

TV INSERT/INT. CAFETERIA	DAY

It's the closed-circuit school NEWS BROADCAST. Tracy is delivering a

stand-up report from the crowded cafeteria. Her dress and makeup are

an obvious if lame emulation of a professional newswoman.

INT. STUDENT COUNCIL MEETING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

A Student Council meeting is underway led by the president, LARRY

FOUCH.  A girl, ASHLEY, is speaking.  JIM observes from the side.

Before Ashley can finish, Tracy STANDS UP

SHE FREEZES AGAIN

WIDE -

Dave is leaning across his desk to speak with JIM at an adjacent work

area.  They eat sack lunches.

INT. JIM'S BASEMENT	DAY Dun-dun-DUN... Dun-dun-DUN

JIM and Dave are playing the opening notes of "Foxy Lady" through

cheap, distorting amps. JIM plays bass. Dave plays guitar and sings

into a microphone. They're bad. As in not good.

The basement is typical of a Midwest middle-class young couple -- half

storage and laundry, half makeshift roc-room.

CLOSE ON DAVE really getting into it, playing to an unseen stadium.

Behind him JIM is very careful with his chords.

CAMERA DRIFTS toward the stairs leading up.

INT. JIM'S KITCHEN

CAMERA DRIFTS from the open basement stairway door and toward DIANE

MCALLISTER and SHERRY NOVOTNY seated at the kitchen  table. They are

fussing over little six-month-old DARRYL NOVOTNY in his highchair.

At a particularly grating note from downstairs, Diane gets up and

closes the basement door.

INT. GEOMETRY CLASS

AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE is being drawn on the blackboard and bisected.

PULL  OUT to reveal Dave explaining.

The class is taking notes, and we zero in on a younger Tracy.

EXT. GODFATHER'S PIZZA -- NIGHT The parking lot, the neon lights, the

promise of good times.

INT. GODFATHER'S PIZZA -- NIGHT Dave and  Tracy are at a booth along

with six other students.

TWO KIDS  DISSOLVE OUT OF FRAME,

and the others shift positions. Others continue to disappear in the

same way, until only Dave and Tracy remain.

Dave's finger traces the rim of his frosty root beer mug.

Dave looks directly into her eyes.

Tracy nods in quiet recognition.

INT. MILLARD YEARBOOK OFFICE -- DAY

A DOOR with cloudy glass and a stenciled sign: YEARBOOK OFFICE.

DISSOLVE through the door and TRAVEL through an empty room to discover

EXT. NOVOTKY HOUSE - DAY

Dave wheels his car into the open garage.  The automatic door closes

behind him.

INT. NOVOTHY LIVIMG ROOM

Dave stands up from his squat at the STEREO, and the sexy sounds of

Sade set the mood.

Tracy is seated awkwardly at one end of the sofa, a Diet Dr. Pepper in

one hand.  Dave walks slowly toward her, a sexy, knowing look in his

eye.  The music is sexy.  Tracy is sexy. He's sexy.  Keeping his eyes

locked on Tracy's, he takes the pop can from her hand and takes a sip

himself.  Sexy.

INT.  NOVOTHY STAIRCASE	DAY

Dave and Tracy walk up the stairs and down the hall.  Dave enters the

bedroom first, while Tracy pauses in the hall. His arm reaches out and

pulls her inside.

INT. NOVOTNY BEDROOM	DAY

IN QUICK TIGHT CUTS we see Dave and Tracy DISROBING

Tracy's head and naked shoulders lay themselves on Dave's pillow.  She

looks toward the foot of the bed at -- DAVE, unable to believe his

eyes.  He looks at naked Tracy up and down, up and down, his breath

quickening.  Sade wafts up the stairs.

He descends out of frame.

INT. DAVE'S BASEMENT	DAY

JIM is riveted by Dave's story; he is both horrified and titillated

Dave draws a heavy sigh and buries his head in his hands perhaps JIM

has reached him.  Perhaps not.

CLICK.  SQUEAK.  STEP STEP STEP.

Sherry comes down the basement stairs with Darryl in her arms.

As Sherry approaches them, Dave rises to take Darryl, the perfect

father:  hug, tickle, kiss.

INT.  PRINCIPAL HENDRICK'S OFFICE	DAY

CLOSE ON DAVE slumped in a chair.  He is lost in agony: all he can do

is look down and draw short, gasping breaths.

Principal Walt Hendricks is at his desk, examining a little BOOKLET.

JIM

sits on the vinyl sofa.

CLOSE ON -- the small makeshift booklet whose cover reads, "There's a

place for us" in overdone fancy cursive.

THE SECOND PAGE shows a cutout from a travel magazine of a swanky

BEACHFRONT HOTEL.  One room has been circled with the words "you and

me" written next to it.  Below: "A time and place for us."  We HEAR

Walt clearing his throat, swallowing.

THE THIRD PAGE has glued to it a POSTCARD showing a couple hand-in-

hand on the beach at sunset and reading, "Maui is for lovers." Below:

Take my hand and we'll soon be there.

THE LAST PAGE has a cutout of a bouquet of flowers.  It reads, "Tracy,

See you in paradise?  Love, your 'teacher' David.  P.S. I really,

really need you now."  The booklet is lowered.

Dave looks at JIM for help. JIM looks away. Dave's breaths grow more

convulsive. Finally -

Dave looks slowly up.

Sherry cradles Darryl while Dave grovels at her feet.

Dave follows Sherry as she takes the baby into their bedroom and slams

the door in Dave's face. Dave pounds on the door, eventually sinking

to his knees and crying.

INT. JIM'S CLASSROOM -- DAY

Tracy, still frozen, THAWS OUT. Maybe now she can finish

RINGGGGG  Maybe not.

At the bell, students instantly shut their textbooks and collect their

things.

Tracy is miffed as she puts her things away: slam, stuff, zip. She

slings her backpack over her shoulder and heads toward the door.  She

looks back at --

MR. MCALLISTER who himself now FREEZES as he talks to a couple of

students

CLOSE-UP FROZEN DETAILS - of Jim's appearance - his slightly frayed

collar and bad tie; the heels of his old docksiders worn down at

irritating angles; the faded impression his too-big wallet has made in

his khakis; his growing bald spot; his ear hairs.

Tracy turns and walks out the door.

INT.  TRACY'S HOUSE -- DAY

CLOSE ON A SMILING LITTLE TRACY - in a Sears-style portrait.  PAN

across a wall full of other framed photos of Tracy accepting awards,

dancing in a recital, poised to dive at a swim meet.

AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE

Tracy's mother, BARBARA FLICK, finishes a letter and puts it in an

envelope.

CLOSE ON BARBARA'S TONGUE as the envelope flap slides across it.

INT. MILLARD HALLWAY	DAY

A politician's SMILE plastered to her face, Tracy is at her card table

vigorously gathering signatures.

A shabbily dressed BURNOUT -- DOUG SCHENKEN -- walks past and grabs a

huge handful of gum.

John just keeps on walking away, and his two BUDDIES take great

delight in his nimble-witted, quick retort.

INT. HILLARD LIBRARY -- DAY

While other students sit in groups around her, Tracy sits apart at her

own table, concentrated and alone. She is writing little numbers by

her signatures.

EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY CLOSE ON TRACY'S EXCITED FACE

Jim, his tie loose and his sleeves rolled up, looks up from unlocking

his car.  Tracy runs toward him holding out a TERM PAPER FOLDER.

He cursorily flips through the bound pages and offers them back to

Tracy.

JIM throws his briefcase and Tracy's folder into the backseat.

Tracy stays put as JIM climbs in, shuts the door and fastens his seat

belt.

They exchange a long, curious stare.  There's a tone at once

confrontational and vaguely sexual about this moment.

JIM pulls away and heads for the parking lot exit.

INT.EXT. JIM'S CAR ON STREET -- DAY

JIM drives stone-faced, unblinking. Something about the music on the

radio mocks him.

EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKIKG LOT	DAY

JIM pulls to a stop next to a giant DUMPSTER

Out of his window come yellowed newspapers, balled-up fast food bags,

and other detritus. He speeds away.

INSIDE THE DUMPSTER we see Tracy's little bound book of signatures.

INT. MCALLISTER DIKING ROOM - MIGHT

JIM and his wife Diane sit at their dining room table, eating chicken

pot pies, baked potatoes with sour cream, salad with Lite Ranch

dressing. Not a word passes between them.

INT. MCALLISTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

JIM lies awake in bed while Diane snores beside him. Something seems

to be echoing in his head.

CLOSE ON JIM'S EAR as Tracy's LIPS magically whisper into it.

INT. MCALLISTER BASEMENT	NIGHT

In the darkness a light pops on, and JIM quietly pads down the stairs.

He opens an old CEDAR TRUNK, lifts out a few blankets and a piece of

cardboard to reveal a row of PORNO TAPES cleverly concealed in the

bottom of the trunk.

ON THE TV SCREEN -

A FOOTBALL PLAYER in uniform and helmet filets a CHEERLEADER in a

locker room.

JIM watches with detachment, as though watching the news.  He sips a

can of PEPSI.  The football stud continues to bump and grind.  Looking

at his Pepsi can, JIM is suddenly inspired.

EXT. SKI SLOPE (REAR PROJECTION) DAY

PAUL METZLER is SKIING in goggles and scarf. Behind  him is a cheesy

His arm on Paul's shoulder, JIM walks Paul down a deserted hall and

into Jim's classroom. JIM picks up some scrap paper off the floor and

puts it in the proper place.

JIM'S CLASSROOM - DAY Paul sits in a chair, while JIM stands

Paul furrows his brow and looks around, searching for an answer.  His

JIM draws illustrative circles on the board as he speaks.

INT.    STUDENT   COMHON   AREA  DAY

Tracy directs her friend ERIC OVERHOLDT on a ladder as he hangs a

large POSTER high on a wall.

Suddenly she notices a small COMMOTION in the adjacent cafeteria and

goes to investigate.

INT. CAFETERIA	DAY

A small crowd of students compete to sign Paul's nomination petition

taped to the wall.

Tracy watches the hubbub, none too pleased, and pushes her way to the

front of the group.

Tracy stares at him.

THE "I" IN "FLICK" is dotted with a STAR

sweat, she moves in a hypnotic frenzy.

INT. PAUL'S PICKUP -- DAY

Paul drives home, his stereo thumping. Silent, he appears lost in

thought, as though a little gopher idea were burrowing its way to the

surface. Oh, look -- there's its snout  now.

EXT. METZLER HOME	DAY Paul pulls into the driveway and hops out of

his car.

Diane and Sherry are setting the picnic table.  Stacked charcoal

briquettes burn off in a nearby barbecue.

Darryl's laughter suddenly turns into CRYING

Sherry heads into the house.  JIM watches her walk, then turns toward

Diane and Darryl.  It's as though Diane, not Sherry, were the infant's

real mother, so loving and attentive is she, so swelled with maternal

piety.

INT. YOUHKERS DEPARTMENT STORE -- DAY

IN WOMEN'S ACCESSORIES -

Sherry looks at herself in the mirror modeling a colorful floppy hat.

direction.

AT THE MAKEUP COUNTER - Sherry spreads on lipstick.

It's clear what JIM thinks.

INT. JIM'S CAR -- DAY

They're driving home.  There are packages on Sherry's lap and in the

uncomfortable silence.

Diane lies face-down, and JIM is on top of her. JIM makes spirited

love with her.

SHERRY'S HEAD, like a cut-out from a tabloid cover, floats in from

off-screen and lands on the back of Diane's head. At the right moment,

her face COMES TO LIFE and vaguely mouths the words that Diane is

saying, like a badly-dubbed movie.

Jim's wicked desire increases with each movement

Now TRACY FLICK'S FACE floats over and replaces Sherry's. Tracy mouths

Diane's words.

JIM is at once in deep-space ecstasy and surprised at himself.

Diane's voice now changes: it's Tracy's VOICE.

FADE OUT

UNDER BLACK

INT. MILLARD HALLWAY -- DAY

It's passing period, and hundreds of students clog the halls

A distant DING-DING grows louder and louder. Everyone turns toward the

source, far down the hall, and eventually TAMMY emerges wearing a

makeshift SANDWICH BOARD that reads "Tammy Metzier For President."

Smiling a perverse smile, she rings a hand bell. Salvation Army style.

Paul is at his locker and watches Tammy go by.

Tammy ignores her brother and keeps walking directly toward us,

finally INTO CAMERA.

INT. MILLARD TEACHERS' OFFICES -- DAY Tracy sits opposite Mr.

McAllister.

Suddenly LISA AND PAUL are sitting where Tracy was.

Now TRACY replaces Lisa and Paul

Sighing, JIM fishes in his drawer and hands Tracy some sheets

LISA AND PAUL again

TRACY returns.

INT. MILLARD GYMNASIUM DAY

The entire student body is assembled on the bleachers. There is a

palpable mood of boredom and apathy.

JERRY SLAVIN, a handicapped kid in a wheelchair, is  at the

microphone. His head lists to one side, and he takes  long breaths as

he speaks.

Jerry motors away amid scattered applause and coughs.  JIM steps

forward, clapping, and raises the mike.

Tracy steps forward with a small stack of index cards. During her

speech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at them.

There is  scattered laughter. Tracy pauses, wait Hendricks bounds up

and grabs the mike.

Walt backs away to his seat. Tracy resumes

Walt whispers to Jim.

JIM nods solemnly

Tracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair.  There is polite

applause and a few whistles.  JJJB comes back to the microphone.

Tracy takes her seat next to Paul and glances at him.  Paul scares

straight ahead, a fat bead of sweat on his forehead. One of his legs

is jiggling.

Paul awkwardly makes his way to the mike.   Though by no means

thunderous, his applause clearly exceeds Tracy's.  A small cluster of

jocks "woof" for him, shaking their fists in the air.  Paul manages a

weak grin for his buddies.

Tracy shifts in her chair, her smile stiff and forced

Lisa smiles and nods at Paul from the bleachers, giving him

encouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they talked

about.

Tammy's eyes dart between Lisa and Paul. She shows no emotion, reveals

nothing.

The applause quickly dies, and after a moment Paul remembers to look

at the white paper in his hand. He speaks in a barely audible

monotone, never once glancing up.

JIM pinches the bridge of his nose, clearly pained

A few loud SOUND EFFECT SNORES saw through the air, and Walt points a

stern finger at - you guessed it -- Doug Schenken.

Paul now gets considerably less applause, but his jock friends remain

loyal.

Tammy approaches the mike. There are scattered mocking whistles and

catcalls.

Tammy calmly looks over the crowd, waiting for the jeers to subside.

She makes eye contact with Lisa, who stares back.

The room quiets down.  Tammy puts her lips close to the mike,

NOW there's something worth listening to.

There is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and applause.

Tammy has set them free.  Even cynical old Doug Schenken and his

buddies join in.

In total control, she steps back from the mike and CURTSIES.

Walt shoots an angry, confused look at Jim, who shrugs. Tracy is

clearly upset, but her smile remains eerily fixed Paul just looks

confused and ashamed.  Jerry Slavin is convulsed in laughter and

chants along with the multitude.

Tammy quickly grabs the mike for one final exhortation.

The students go nuts.

INT. WALT HENDRICK'S OFFICE	DAY

Dr. Hendricks is in a serious post-assembly discussion with JIM and

VICE-PRINCIPAL RON BELL.

To emphasize his point, Walt throws his STYROFOAM CUP at the

wastepaper basket and misses.  Lowell the janitor, passing by outside

the door, notices the cup bouncing on the floor.

EXT. STREETS	DAY

Tammy rides her bike on this crisp sunny spring day.  The music is

buoyant.  Tammy is all smiles.

EXT. 7-11  DAY

Tammy is hanging out by the entrance. A DUDE emerges from the store

carrying a 12-pack of beer. En route to his car, he throws Tammy a

pack of CIGARETTES.

Tammy looks at the pack

EXT. SACRED HEART ACADEMY -- DAY

A cigarette hanging out of her mouth, Tammy rides by the front of this

Catholic girls' school.

NOW AT THE ATHLETIC FIELD -

Tammy gets off her bike, goes to look through the surrounding fence at

GIRLS PLAYING LACROSSE

in their cleats, short skirts, jerseys. LITURGICAL MUSIC accompanies

SLOW-MOTION close-ups of the girls in action.

Tammy seems to breathe them in

INT. TAMMY'S ROOM -- DAY

Wearing headphones. Tammy DANCES to music only  she can hear. She

happens to glance toward her door and notices a MANILA ENVELOPE

sliding under it. She opens the door  and finds a startled Paul.

Tammy looks at him, picks up the packet.

Paul smiles at the acknowledgment of his good deed.

Paul is about to leave again but

Tammy looks as though she'd like to push the button on all the world's

atomic bombs.

EXT. TRACY'S DRIVEWAY DAY

CLOSE ON A GIANT OUTLINED "0" --

drawn on white paper. A hand enters frame with a brush and begins to

fill in the outline with blue tempera-paint.

Camera RISES to reveal the "0" as part of a giant banner. Tracy is

working on some letters, while ERIC OVERHOLDT is working on others.

Finally, we're high enough to read:

WHO CARES? I DO: VOTE TRACY!

Eric carefully paints over his mistake, then works up  some courage.

Ouch.

INT. MILLARD YEARBOOK OFFICE -- NIGHT A haggard Tracy sits alone at a

computer monitor

THE MONITOR

displays a DIGITIZED PHOTO of the Millard yearbook staff.  DAVE

NOVOTNY peers proudly from behind two of the taller students. A CURSOR

in the shape of tiny SCISSORS makes a small circle around Dave's face.

Suddenly, the cursor turns into a tiny HAND and drags Dave's dislodged

head into the TRASH.

Tracy concentrates as she deftly controls the mouse.

THE COMPUTER MONITOR AGAIN --

as Tracy outlines a piece of the WALL and places it in the void where

Dave used to be, blurring the edges for a perfect effect,  voila!

Satisfied, Tracy taps on the keyboard.

INT. MILLARD HIGH HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Tracy is heading down the hall toward the exit when she rounds a

corner and, suddenly deeply troubled, sees that

HER NEW "WHO CARES?" BANNER has come loose on an upper corner and is

drooping.

Tracy puts down her things and JUMPS up to slap the corner back into

place.  Satisfied, she turns away.  But then - SHOOP!  The banner

fights back, peeling even further from the wall.  Tracy prepares for

battle.

INT. YEARBOOK OFFICE	NIGHT

Tracy enters and grabs a long aluminum STRAIGHT-EDGE.

INT. HALLWAY	NIGHT

Standing on an overturned GARBAGE CAN and wielding the straight-edge,

Tracy tries to smooth the banner. But she's not holding the ruler flat

against the wall and -- RIP! -- she slices the banner lengthwise. Now

the plastic garbage can begins to buckle. Struggling to retain her

balance, Tracy accidentally hooks the banner and as she TUMBLES yanks

the whole thing down.

Overcome with anger and frustration, she thrashes around on the ground

and TEARS UP what remains of her banner.

PAUL METZLER smiles down at Tracy from his poster across the hall.

Tracy looks up at it. Instantly she is on her feet, lunging for the

poster. She jumps up, TEARS it down, and RIPS Paul's head into pieces.

Blood issues from a thin paper cut on one hand. Tracy regards it at

first without comprehending, then raises it to her mouth. While

sucking her wound, her gaze falls on --

ANOTHER SMILING PAUL mocking her pain.

ANGLE FROM WAY DOWN THE HALL

Hurricane Tracy begins a savage assault on the fragile coast of

Millard High. Paul's campaign posters fill the air, shredded to pieces

by the powerful winds of jealousy and rage.

TIME DISSOLVE --

to Tracy even farther down the hall, still jumping, still ripping.

TRACK FROM OVERHEAD - THE HALLWAY FLOOR - where a thousand bits of

Paul lie scattered -- a grinning mouth here, an eye there.

TILT UP finally to Tracy, sweating, panting.  She finishes ripping a

poster and looks to find another.  But there are no more Paul posters:

she has destroyed them all.  Tracy raises her hands and sees they are

streaked with Blood.

INT. GIRLS ' BATHROOM	NIGHT

Tracy is at the sink, washing away the blood.  She pats her hands dry

with paper towels.  The gravity of what she's done now sinks in, and

she panics.

She lifts the top off a garbage can, removes the PLASTIC LINER.

INT. MILLARD HALLWAY	NIGHT

With frantic haste, Tracy stuffs the evidence of her awful deed into

the garbage bag.

EXT. BACK OF HILLARD HIGH -- MIGHT

Tracy's face is half-obscured by the bulging bag she carries down the

sidewalk.

EXT. HILLARD PARKIMC LOT - MIGHT

Tracy opens her TRUNK and heaves the garbage bag inside slamming the

trunk, she looks around - no one.

INT. TRACY'S CAR	NIGHT

Tracy drives, sucking on a wounded hand. She glances frequently in the

rear-view mirror.

EXT. STREET    MIGHT

Tracy's car drives down a REMOTE ROAD.  There are no sidewalks here,

and the surroundings consist of scrubby vegetation and industrial

structures.  In the background looms a POWER PLANT.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

We now sense that Tracy has a plan. She throws the car into reverse,

backs up and turns onto -

EXT. A SMALL ACCESS ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

Tracy stop the car near an EMBANKMENT. She gets out and pulls the

garbage bag from the trunk.

With a big shove Tracy sends the bag cartwheeling down the hill

Breathing hard but clearly relieved, Tracy watches the evidence of her

deed tumble into obscurity.

NOW THROUGH BINOCULARS Tracy's shadowy figure runs back to the car.

EXT.    HILL   ABOVE   POWER   PLANT  NIGHT

Tammy momentarily drops her BINOCULARS before raising them again.

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - Tracy's car speeds away.

Tammy drops her binoculars and mounts her bike

EXT. EMBANKMENT -- NIGHT

Tammy skids to a stop, drops her bike, and heads down the embankment.

CLOSE ON THE HEFTY BAG

as Tammy draws near. She pauses at first, but intrepid curiosity

conquers her fear. She unties the knot.

FROM INSIDE THE BAG we see Tammy's sudden look of HORROR

PAUL'S MANGLED FACE smiles up at her. Tammy raises it toward camera

INT. NOVOTWY BATHROOM -- MORNING

CLOSE ON A DRAIN

as a hand extracts a huge WAD OF HAIR -- stringy, mucousy. fetid.

JIM holds it up for Sherry, who stands behind him in her bathrobe.

He examines it from different angles. Both scrunch their faces

CLOSE ON AN OPEN TOILET - Plop!  The hairwad joins several smaller

stringy friends.

NOW AT THE SINK

JIM washes his hands.  Sherry glances between JIM and the water

running in the shower.  It's getting steamy.

JIM turns off the faucet and reaches for a towel.  Sherry offers him

another.

JIM takes it and dries his hands.  Sherry now stands very close to

him.  JIM

sets the towel on the sink.  It's a little awkward as they look into

each other's eyes, standing so near.

She slowly wraps her arms around Jim's neck and pulls him to her, a

hug of gratitude and warmth -- nothing sexual here, just the embrace

of two people in need of shelter from the storm of life.  No, nothing

sexual at all.

Now sherry begins to cry a little, and things begin to change -- hands

wander, cheek brushes cheek.  Finally lips meet, tenderly at first.

And then it is a deluge.

INT. NOVOTNY LIVING ROOM	DAY

JIM and Sherry stumble in from the hallway locked in an embrace.  They

rove around the room, barely able to keep their balance.  Finally,

they fall to the ground.

CLOSE ON LITTLE DARRYL --

playing with his foot in the CRIB.  Through the bars behind him we can

discern the murky shape of Sherry and JIM rutting and grunting like

wild boars.

EXT. NOVOTNY DRIVEWAY	DAY

JIM starts his car.  Sherry leans into his window.  She looks around

the neighborhood before kissing him firmly on the mouth.

curvy MOUNTAIN ROAD. Next Stop: portofino!

EXT. MILLARD HIGH PARKING LOT	DAY

JIM'S Ferrari heads up the driveway and into his assigned space He

opens the Ferrari door.

JIM'S FOOT touches the pavement - not a shiny Salvatore Ferragamo

loafer but a worn out Dexter.

WIDE -

JIM is back in his own clothes, and his car has reverted to a Ford

Escort in need of a wash. He heads toward the school.

INT. HILLARD LIBRARY -- DAY

JIM enters the library, walks among the stacks.

JIM takes a BOOK from the shelf

Jim flips through the book and finds the poem he seeks. His lips move

silently.

JIM'S VOICE (VO CONT'D)

Close, close the lovers keep. They stay together in their sleep. Close

as two pages in a book That read each other in the dark..

Suddenly -- a grating VOICE from the loudspeakers.

JIM smacks the book closed

INT. WALT ' S OFFICE - DAY

LISA FLAMAGAN - her face streaked with tears from outrage and

confusion.

Paul sits next to Lisa on the vinyl sofa.  He wants to console her,

but he doesn't know how.

JIM enters.

INT.  CHEMISTRY CLASSROOM	DAY

A BUNSEN BURNER --

as a VIAL containing blue liquid is held to the flame.  The solution

magically changes from blue to yellow.

Wearing goggles, Tracy holds the beaker with chemist's tongs Her two

LAB PARTNERS observe.

The classroom door and a STUDENT approaches the teacher, MR. BECKMAN,

to deliver a note.

Tracy looks up through her goggles.

Finally she reaches the

Tracy is seated in a chair. JIM hovers above her, alternately leaning

on a desk and pacing.

JIM stares at her.

JIM shifts gears

JIM draws a long breath as he tries to control himself

There's a KNOCK.  JIM and Tracy turn to see

TAMMY METZLER timidly poking her head in.

Tammy manages to squeeze in a naughty little smile before closing the

door.

INT. OUTER OFFICE    DAY

Tammy sits patiently in a chair, bobbing to an unheard song. The door

opens, and Tracy emerges.

As Tammy and Tracy cross, Tracy speaks in a low voice but loud enough

for JIM

to hear.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

Tammy sits facing Jim, cradling her backpack.

She burrows in her backpack.

INT. OUTER OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Tracy stands up from her seat and manages to PEEK THROUGH THE WINDOW

of the conference room. She sees --

pulling out a handful of POSTER SHREDS from her backpack and handing

them to Jim.

Tracy turns away and covers her mouth with one hand.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM	CONTINUOUS

THE POSTER FRAGMENTS in Jim's hands. TILT UP to Tammy really hamming

it up.

Paul's little sister.  He's so perfect,

JIM watches her performance until he can't take it anymore he's got

other fish to fry.

He throws the door open.

INT. OUTER OFFICE	CONTINUOUS

Tracy is frightened but still plays the indignant victim.

What does he mean?

It takes Tracy a second to figure out how to react. But once she's got

it, she runs with it.

He yanks the paper out of the carriage and hurries away.

THE SINK --

JIM dumps a bucketful of ICE and wedges in a bottle of cheap

CHAMPAGNE.

THE BEDSIDE TABLE -

JIM props up his flowers in the ice bucket and puts a small box of

Russell Stover's CANDY next to it.  He unwraps the motel's plastic

cups and places them just so.  Perfect.

JIM'S BOOK OF POETRY -- open to that special poem.  He marks it with a

carnation.

UNDER THE BED --

Jim's face appears as he kneels down and slides the book into place,

ready for that perfect moment.

THE BATHROOM -

JIM'S FINGER on the doorbell. DING-DONG.

JIM waits, rings again. Ho answer. He knocks. No one. He tries the

door. Locked. Maybe she's out back. He walks around the house to --

EXT. SHERRY'S BACKYARD	CONTINUOUS

It's a lovely little backyard. Springtime flowers bloom. Bees buzz

among the peonies.

JIM opens the gate, approaches the back door, and knocks.

He rears back and aims his yell toward the second floor.

No response. He tries the door. It's locked. JIM cranes his neck for a

last look at the house. As he starts to leave, he calls out one final

time, not really expecting a response.

Suddenly A WASP STINGS him above his right EYE

Cursing and holding his head, JIM stumbles out the gate

INT. SAFARI MOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Through the glass windows, we see Jim's car pull into the lot and

park. JIM enters the lobby. His eye is puffy and red.

A MOTEL EMPLOYEE watches TV behind the counter

THE TELEPHONE - as JIM punches in Sherry's number.

JIM holds the phone against his ear and the champagne bottle against

his eye.

JIM'S car pulls into the driveway.

INT. JIM AND DIANE'S KITCHEN    NIGHT

JIM enters the back door and sets his satchel down in the usual place.

He opens the refrigerator, grabs a beer.  As he closes the door,

something catches his eye.  He reaches inside and throws a plastic

container away.  Rooting around noisily, he finds other things to

dispose of.  Suddenly --

A BABY CRY stops him cold.

JIM stiffens, his good eye widening as the horrible truth sinks in.

He carefully closes the refrigerator and tiptoes toward the living

room.

INT.    LIVING   ROOM   --   CONTINUOUS

Jim's face slowly appears around the corner, bad eye first. Finally,

he's able to see --

together on the living room sofa, staring at him.  Their eyes are red

from crying.  Little Darryl squirms in Sherry's lap.

Caught, JIM emerges from his hiding place.  No one speaks. Finally, he

looks down, sucks in air, blows it out again, nods a little.

He turns to leave, and nobody stops him.

EXT. JIM'S HOME -- NIGHT

JIM wanders out the front door and stands in his driveway, bewildered

and alone.  The camera slowly CRANES UP, eventually looking down on

him from a great height.

INT. JIM'S CAR -- NIGHT

JIM sits parked outside of Sherry's house, a SLURPEE held against his

practically gasps for breath.

INT. TRACY'S KITCHEN -- DAWN

Tracy and her mom are hard at work frosting cupcakes.

CLOSE ON A CUPCAKE - as "PICK FLICK" is written on it with a yellow

icing tube.

MRS. Flick cheerfully performs her task. She hums.

I remember she was so happy, like there was nothing in the world she'd

rather be doing.  Besides me and her job, I guess my mom doesn't have

much of a life.  She hasn't dated anyone since Frank, and she hardly

ever buys new clothes for herself or travels.

Mrs. Flick puts an arm around her daughter

EXT. SHERRY'S HOUSE	DAWN

Jim's car has not moved from its spot on the driveway. Its windows are

now fogged. A LOUD GARBAGE TRUCK rumbles by.

INT. JIM'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Reclined in his car seat, mouth open as he sleeps, JIM is awakened by

the truck. His breath steams. His eye has turned bluish. He tries to

wipe the condensation from the windshield, but it's on the outside.

EXT. SHERRY'S DRIVEWAY -- CONTINUOUS

JIM opens the door and looks around -- no sign of Sherry's car. He

stiffly walks to the side of the garage and unzips his pants to pee.

Now cradling his head on the roof of his car, JIM gathers what little

strength he has, gets in, and tries to start the cold engine.

THE TAILPIPE finally coughs out a cloud of exhaust

INT./EXT. JIM'S CAR	DAWN

JIM drives, bleary-eyed.  He creeps along his tree-lined middle-class

block.

JIM slows to a stop, looks with dread at his home

EXT.  JIM'S HOUSE	CONTINUOUS

On the front porch sits A GYM BAG.  JIM approaches, stares numbly at

the bag.  Drawing a long breath, he bends over and picks it up.

Attached is a NOTE reading:   "Don't come in."

EXT. MILLARD HIGH	DAWN

At the foot of the main walk to the school, Tracy and her mother are

setting up a CARD TABLE covered with little pink cakes.

Jim's Ford Escort chugs its way through the fog and comes to a stop.

Looking like a war refugee, JIM emerges from his car carrying the gym

bag and heads toward school.

JIM stops, turns slowly, regards mother and daughter with a crazed,

one-eyed, uncomprehending stare.

JIM takes it wordlessly.  AS he heads up the walkway, he eats it in

two huge bites, like a feral animal.

INT. BOYS' LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

IN THE SHOWERS JIM scrubs himself as if to wash his whole life away.

AT THE MIRROR JIM adjusts his tie, tries to smooth his wrinkled shirt.

INT. SCHOOL OFFICE	DAY

INT.  TEACHERS'  OFFICES	DAY

BALLOT AFTER BALLOT -- as a black magic marker crosses out Tammy's

name.

JIM sits at his desk and carries out his absurd task.  He stops and

stares.  His thoughts wander far, far away.

INT. TV AND MILLARD CLASSROOMS	DAY

CLOSE ON A TV-- mounted in the corner.  An educational video is just

beginning.  Host CLARK NAYLOR sits on the edge of a desk in a generic

office set.

During the video, we cut to CLASSROOMS, where from the TV's point of

view, we see the students watching:  English class shop class, gym

class, biology class.

CLOSE-UPS OF STUDENTS

Now replace the wider shots of classrooms.  Photographed as though

from a Soviet propaganda film, some students look up nobly and

attentively, while others watch with dead eyes and open mouth, and

still others goof off.

An AFRICAN-AMERICAN TEENAGER walks up to Clark.

INT. MILLARD HALLWAY NEAR OF-PICE -- DAY

JIM slinks down the hall and ducks into a PHONE BOOTH. He fishes

change out of his pocket and dials.   We hear the echo of the video

emanating from all the classrooms.

INT.  TEACHERS' OFFICES -- DAY

JIM crosses out more ballots, this time with perverse intensity.

CLOSE ON TAMMY'S NAME -

as it is blackened.  We WIPE with the motion of the magic marker to:

INT. LITTLE SALLY ANN SHOP    DAY

SWISH!

The curtain of the dressing room is drawn back, and there's Tammy. She

beams and walks toward --

A THREE-PANEL MIRROR,

where she takes herself in, dressed in her new Catholic schoolgirl

UNIFORM.

The SALESLADY converses nearby with Jo Metzier.

Tammy spins and admires the flip of the skirt.

INT. MILLARD HIGH CAFETERIA    DAY

Makeshift POLLING BOOTHS are set up just outside the cafeteria. Behind

two tables sit TWO TEACHERS who cross out voters' names on big master

computer lists. Tracy stands in line, not-so-patiently waiting her

turn.

She finally reaches the front of the line.

Tracy goes into a VOTING BOOTH and quickly hands her ballot. sophomore

PHIL CHOY stands nearby with his CAMERA.

Tracy exits the booth and heads toward the BALLOT BOX.  She inserts

her ballot halfway and freezes, smiling.  Phil snaps a picture, but -

Tracy remains perfectly still while Phil fiddles with his camera.  A

STUDENT stands behind her, waiting to put his ballot in the box.

FLASH!  Phil gets his shot and Tracy drops her ballot in.

On her way out Tracy passes Paul at the end of the line.  He gives her

an enthusiastic THUMBS UP.

INT. VOTING BOOTH Paul scans his ballot, struggles with his decision.

THE BALLOT - as Paul's pen puts an "X" next to the name "Tracy Flick

INT. MILLARD HALLWAYS	DAY

THE BALLOT BOX is being carried through the halls and up some stairs

by Larry Fouch and three other STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBERS. The music

suggests the weighty importance of its contents and the sacred mission

of its bearers.

INT. JIM'S CLASSROOM - DAY

JIM is hunkered over his desk.  He's a wreck: dark, dark circles under

his eyes;  his hair didn't dry right -- frizzy here, matted there.

And he's near tears.

Larry Fouch and his retinue enter cheerfully

Larry drops the ballot box on Jim's desk

JIM doesn't understand at first, then

JIM proceeds to sort through his cluttered desk drawers but can't seem

to find the key.  The council members exchange concerned looks as

Jim's search becomes frenzied.

JIM emerges from the drawer wielding a VISE GRIP.  He goes to the box

and TEARS the entire hardware assembly off.  Holding the mangled lock,

he turns to the students, who look back STUNNED.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCHOOL OFFICE	DAY

JIM slinks up to a PAY PHONE, inserts a coin, dials

JIM it's me again.  I'm sorry for all the calls.  But Sherry, if I

could just hear your voice, if you'd only acknowledge that I...

CLICK.

INT. MILLARD HALLWAY -- DAY

It's PASSING PERIOD, and the halls are jammed with students at their

lockers and walking to class.

JIM is walking quickly back to his classroom. He passes Paul.

Jim doesn't even hear.

INT.  CLASSROOM	DAY

Larry is  just finishing his count. The ballots are on a desk in front

of  him, neatly organized into three piles. JIM enters.

Jim's use of profanity scares Larry, and he responds reluctantly

Jim, who hasn't cared about any of this today, suddenly takes note. He

stares blankly at Larry as the news sinks in.

Jim-scoops up the three piles of ballots and takes them to his desk.

INT. HISTORY CLASS	DAY

CLOSE ON DALE -

a junior honors student. He is thinking. The wheels are turning,

grinding. Finally --

MR. FLAGG is lecturing, really trying to make history come alive.

Tracy takes notes, but she is noticeably distracted.

Tracy just can't take it anymore.  She abruptly stands up, takes the

GIANT HALL PASS off the lip of the blackboard, and starts to leave.

Mr. Flagg gives her a small nod.

INT.  RAILWAY	DAY

Tracy nears a room, a special room.  She slows down and peeks in the

window of the door.  She sees --

LARRY FOUCH  sitting at the back of the classroom, staring front.

Tracy presses her face to see what Larry is staring at --

JIM at his desk counting ballots

LARRY catches sight of Tracy in the window.

TRACY crosses her fingers by her ears and gives a questioning look

LARRY sneaks a guilty look at Jim, absorbed in his counting.  Then,

against his better judgment flashes Tracy a quick, furtive double

THUMBS-UP.

TRACY suddenly disappears from the window.

IN THE EMPTY HALLWAY - Tracy pogos with unbridled joy

She pulls herself together enough to peek through the window of the

OTHER DOOR to Jim's classroom, the window behind which JIM

is still busily doing his count.

INT. JIM'S CLASSROOM -- DAY

JIM counts out the last of the ballots, mouthing the numbers to

himself.

JIM looks up and sees

TRACY in the window, her face exploding with joy.  She FREEZES.

We move closer to Jim in SLOW-MOTION.  What actually occurs in a

split-second is suspended in time

Tracy UNFREEZES and darts out of sight. JIM glances at Larry. Larry is

writing in a notebook.

JIM'S HAND

creeps up from his lap and onto the pile of TRACY VOTES.  His fingers

nimbly count two ballots and pull them off the desk.

JIM coughs as beneath his desk he CRUMPLES THE BALLOTS into a ball and

drops them into the wastepaper basket.

INT. WALT HENDRICKS'S OFFICE	DAY

Walt is just finishing counting the ballots on his desk. Larry and JIM

stand over him.

INT. MILLARD HIGH GYMNASIUM -- DAY

AN ASSEMBLY - The students are taking their seats on the bleachers.

ON THE FLOOR

are all the candidates:  three for secretary, two for treasurer, one

for vice-president, two for president.

PAUL AND TRACY sit side-by-side.  Paul seems a little overwhelmed by

the whole thing.  Tracy leans over and offers her hand.

CLOSE ON PAUL

JIM approaches the microphone

The students quiet down

OS TRACY - Jim's voice momentarily recedes.

JIM pulls a folded paper from his back pocket

Tracy just can't wait.  Smiling, she STANDS UP.

The crowd breaks into applause -- and laughter

ON TRACY - AS she sits, her smile belies her horror and humiliation

Paul begins his acceptance speech.  We cut alternately to a thrilled

Lisa; a stunned Tracy, tears forming at the corners of her eyes; and

to JIM, who watches the events with shifty eyes, his mouth dry and

tasting of metal.

The auditorium erupts into applause and whistles, and JIM takes the

microphone again.

EXT. COCO'S BAKERY/RESTAURANT DUSK

In the growing darkness, the restaurant radiates its distinctive

orange glow. The parking lot is nearly empty.

INT. COCO'S BAKERY/RESTAURANT DUSK

JIM sits alone at a booth by the window, finishing    a slice of berry

pie. He gets the attention of a WAITRESS and holds up his coffee cup.

As JIM gets his warm-up, in walk the Metziers: Paul,  Dick and Jo. JIM

notices them as they wait to be seated. He    wishes he were

invisible.

As a PERKY HOSTESS leads the family to a table, Paul  spots Jim. Here

it comes.

JIM stands up awkwardly.

The Metziers go, and- Paul slides in across from Jim.

JIM tries to smile and seem attentive, but we sense his profound

fatigue and his profound sadness.

The wind out of his sails, Paul gets up and is about to go when

INT. TRACY'S BEDROOM	NIGHT

CLOSE ON TRACY -

her face drained and pallid, her eyes red and bleary: she is exhausted

from crying.

She falls again headlong again into the throes of despair. Her mouth

contorts into a rictus of agony, and there issues an almost feral cry

of pain. Her anguish grows convulsive.

Barbara Flick comes in and sits on the bed. She's carrying a

PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and a glass of milk.

Tracy takes the pills and sips the milk weakly. Her mother kisses her.

She lays Tracy on the bed, and Tracy begins to quiet. Barbara kisses

her again and rises to leave. At  the door she pauses to add a few

final words of comfort.

EXT.  MCAILISTER  HOME	 NIGHT

JIM stands at his own back door, beaten and ashamed.  He lifts a hand

and knocks.  After a moment the door opens, and there is Diane.

Diane looks at JIM in silence.  Her face reveals nothing, but there is

a deadness in her eyes.  After a moment, she turns back inside,

leaving the door open.

JIM follows his wife inside, closes the door.  The camera moves to

peek in the kitchen window, from where we watch JIM and Diane but

cannot make out anything they say.

INT. MILLARD HIGH	JIM'S CLASSROOM -- NIGHT

A WASTE BASKET peeks out from under Jim's desk.

We hear a distinctive rhythmic squeak, and a shadowy head appears in

the window.  Keys jingle.  The door opens, and Lowell turns on the

lights.  He approaches the waste basket and slides it out.

ON THE GROUND -- JIM does pushups. Then sit-ups.

check his box, giving a wave to Miss Seeder.

JIM continues to whistle as he looks through his mail.

Still absorbed in his papers, JIM heads over to Walt's door.

INT. WALT'S OFFICE	CONTINUOUS

JIM stops cold. Walt is not alone. Barbara Flick and a bleary-eyed

Tracy are there. So are Larry Fouch, Ron Bell, and Lowell the janitor.

Prominently displayed on Walt's desk are TWO CRINKLED BALLOTS. JIM

takes an eternal few seconds to absorb what is happening.

All turn and stare at Jim. Come to think of it, he does look awfully

guilty.

is there

The door opens revealing that only wait and JIM remain. The office

staff is hushed as JIM the Zombie Cyclops emerges into the office and

walks somberly toward Miss Boeder. His voice quavers at half-volume.

EXT. HILLARD HIGH (REAR PROJECTIOH) -- DAY

As JIM moves toward the parking lot, the school recedes in an odd REAR

PROJECTION that suggests he is floating. The MUSIC here reinforces the

gravity of the moment, the inevitability of his fate.

JIM stops walking, and a disembodied STEEPING WHEEL floats into his

hands. The scene behind changes to:

INT./EXT. JIM'S CAR REAR PROJECTION - DAY

The city passing by outside is another strange REAR PROJECTION. JIM

grips the floating steering wheel and makes turns wildly out-of-sync

with the background.

JIM lets go of the steering wheel, and it drifts away. JIM turns his

back to camera to face -

INT. MCALLISTER HOUSE (REAR PROJECTIOH) -- DAY

JIM drifts toward his house, and it absorbs him through the front

door.

INT. MCALLISTER LIVING ROOM - DAY

We're no longer in rear-projection land: reality has caught up with

Jim. As he walks across the room, he strips off his shirt, shoes,

socks, and finally pants. Left only in his underwear, he walks through

the house and out into the -

EXT. MCALLISTER BACKYARD	DAY and flops down in the grass, facing

the sky.

A shadow falls over Jim's face, and a hand offers him a glass of iced

tea. Grateful, JIM takes it, and looks up at -

DIANE, her head blocking the sun.

Diane leaves. JIM looks up at the sky.

sombrero with tassels on his head. Behind him  we can see an enormous

illuminated GRAVEL CONVEYOR. SUPER-IMPOSED:  "ONE YEAR LATER."

LATER --

Paul is at a KEG, pumping it up and serving himself  a beer. He takes

a sip, seems to grow pensive.

CLOSE ON TRACT'S NAME - followed by a whopping list of page references

EXT. MILLARD PARKING LOT - DAY

Tracy walks outside hugging her yearbook and sees

PAUL AT HIS TRUCK, surrounded by supplicants.

Tracy stops for a moment and watches.  She gathers her courage and

heads toward him.  Paul doesn't even notice her, so occupied is he

with his friends and admirers.

Paul takes the book, efficiently finds the page with his picture, and

goes to work.

Nolan finishes and hands the book over.  Tracy turns to the front

pages and finds them completely filled, as are the end pages.  Now she

looks for her picture.  When she finds it, it's almost completely

obscured by part of some ASSWIPE 'S long, illegible, exclamation

point-filled message.  Finally, she locates an available space and

begins to write.

CLOSE ON - Tracy writing: "Love, Tracy" beneath her inscription

Tracy takes Paul's book back to him.  He's already working on another

annual and barely looks up when he swaps with her.

Tracy starts to walk away and Paul stops her

Have a great Summer!  Good luck at college   Paul Metzier'

THE GLASS DOORS TO THE SHOWROOM OPEN, and JIM watches a satisfied

customer drive slowly away in a new Saturn Twin Cam.

INT. GRIFFITH SATURN EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM	DAY

The room consists of mismatched sofas and chairs around a coffee

table.  There's a TV that no one watches.

Sleeves rolled up and tie loosened, JIM eats a sandwich next to TWO

OTHER SALESMEN and a FEMALE ACCOUNTANT who like him are eating lunch

and watching TV.  NO one speaks.

A SALESMAN pokes his head in the door.

JIM chews quicker and wipes his mouth as he stands up, straightens his

tie.

JIM walks among the shiny new cars and sees the back of an attractive

young woman in a red dress and heels.  She turns around: it's Tracy.

Tracy takes a corner and pulls to a stop in front of a modest middle

class house.

Tracy sets the parking brake.  Jim's eyes register a suppressed panic.

Tracy looks deeply into Jim's eyes.

Tracy heads toward the house. JIM sits and waits.  He scans Tracy's

house, notices the chipped and peeling paint,  the rusting lawn

furniture, the bowed porch steps.

NOW TRACY opens the door and gets in. She carries her YEARBOOK  and

gives it to Jim.

Tracy reaches over the parking brake and flips the yearbook to the

blank pages at the beginning.

JIM removes a pen from his breast pocket and uncaps  it. He considers

what to write.

CLOSE ON JIM

He looks at the yearbook. He looks at Tracy. He looks out the

windshield. It's all so odd.

CLOSE ON THE BLANK PAGE JIM begins to write:

"Dear Tracy,"
