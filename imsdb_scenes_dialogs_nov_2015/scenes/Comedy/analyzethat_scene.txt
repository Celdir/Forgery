PETER STEINFELD and HAROLD RAMIS and PETER TOLAN

FADE IN:

INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT

Two men, CAESAR and MARTY "DUCKS," stand at  the   end of the

deserted bar, talking quietly, oblivious to  the   exotic dancer

grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle  of   the small

stage. Body language and charisma tell us   that   Caesar is the

boss, "Ducks" his lieutenant.

Caesar starts to walk away as the bartender, now holding a

sawed-off shotgun, moves closer to Ducks. The exotic dancer

splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage.

Caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have

appeared, holding AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

As he walks out the door, the soldiers OPEN FIRE on Marty

"Ducks." Caesar doesn't look back.

PULL BACK TO:

TV SCREEN

The title credits come up on the made-for-cable series we've

been watching, "Little Caesar." CLAPPING AND CHEERING from

O.S.

WIDEN TO:

INT. SING SING PRISON - NIGHT

Maximum-security prisoners are gathered around watching their

favorite show in the rec room. In the front row is PAUL VITTI,

former New York crime boss, and a couple of other wiseguys.

The WISEGUY gets up and starts switching channels on the TV.

A couple of CONVICTS in the back start to protest.

Vitti turns and stares at them.      They fall silent

immediately.

Vitti turns the page and sees a huge headline in the Post:

MOB SHRINK TELLS ALL. He gets up, agitated.

Vitti stands up and heads back to his cell.

INT. CELL BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

As Vitti approaches his cell, he sees a prison guard standing

by. His cellmate, EARL, a giant of a man, comes out of their

cell carrying his bedroll and a box containing his other

meager possessions.

He notices something in the box.

Earl exits with the guard. Vitti hesitates a moment, then

warily steps into his cell.

INT. VITTI'S CELL - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

The cellblock is quiet. A guard stops outside the darkened

cell, looks around to make sure no one is watching, then

pulls out a GUN with a SILENCER, reaches through the bars and

FIRES REPEATEDLY into Vitti's shadowy form under the blanket.

Then he slips away as quietly as he appeared.

ON his exit we PAN DOWN TO Vitti, unhurt, curled up under his

bunk.

INT. MEMORIAL CHAPEL - DAY

A deluxe casket flanked by elaborate floral displays and an

easel displaying a portrait of the deceased, Dr. Isaac Sobel.

Mourners fill the pews, standees at the back, an overflow

crowd. BEN SOBEL sits in the front row, staring at the

casket with his wife, LAURA, his son, MICHAEL, now a

teenager, BEN'S MOTHER, and her friend, DR. JOYCE BROTHERS.

At the podium, the RABBI is speaking.

Ben rises and crosses solemnly to the podium.

Laura, Michael and Ben's Mother listen proudly to the eulogy.

A RINGING CELL PHONE interrupts him.

BEN

still seated in the front row, daydreaming. The RINGING

CONTINUES as all the mourners and even the Rabbi discreetly

check their cell phones.

Then Ben realizes it's his, fumbles for the phone in his

jacket pocket and answers it.

The mourners mutter.

INT. PRISON PAY PHONE - SAME TIME

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. CHAPEL

Ben turns away from Laura.

Vitti is disheveled, his hair messed, his shirt buttoned

wrong.

Ben hangs up.

VITTI

He stands there for a long beat just staring, the DIAL TONE

BUZZING in his ear.

INT. SING SING - MESS HALL - NEXT DAY

Vitti and another WISEGUY pass through the cafeteria line

with their trays. Vitti now looks catatonic.

Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little.

A guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from

his post. Then he nods to someone across the room.

COYOTE, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in

response.

Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other

tough Hispanic gang members.

His friends laugh.

Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them.

There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing.

Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic.

But Vitti can't stop. He drops his tray of slop, splattering

food on the men. Coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv.

Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly

whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray

and bursts into song.

Prisoners and guards stare at him like he's nuts.

Coyote stabs at him again, but Vitti dodges and smashes him

over the head with the tray.

Coyote rushes him, but Vitti sidesteps and hits him in the

face.

Guards move in from all sides.   Vitti jumps up on the

tabletop to escape them.

The guards drag him down and cuff his hands behind him, then

carry him out stiff as a board.

EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - LATER

A limo pulls up to an old, but well-maintained suburban

house, the family gets out and starts walking to the house.

EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

The family crosses to the front door.

Ben opens the front door and they go in.

INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The family enters the foyer.

Laura notices FBI AGENTS CERRONE and MILLER waiting for them

in the living room. Cerrone is an attractive woman in her

late twenties, wearing a dangerously-short skirt. Miller is

a clean-cut man in his thirties.

Ben gestures for them to sit.

Laura and Michael both look at him doubtfully.

Agent Cerrone crosses her legs, a move that does not go

unnoticed by Ben and Michael.

Laura shoots him a look.

Agents Cerrone and Miller eye each other.

She exits.

INT. SING SING INFIRMARY - PSYCH WARD - DAY

Vitti huddles in the corner of a bare, white, padded cell,

rocking, completely out of his head.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME TIME

Ben watches through a two-way mirror with the prison

psychiatrist, DR. CUTLER. They can hear Vitti through a

wall-mounted speaker.

INT. PADDED CELL

Ben and Dr. Cutler enter.   Vitti doesn't seem to notice.

Vitti's jaw suddenly goes slack and he slumps in his seat,

staring forward.

Ben waves a hand in front of Vitti's face.       Nothing.

INT. EXAMINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Vitti sits inert on the examination table.

Ben slaps Vitti's face lightly a couple times.

He pulls on Vitti's ears and nose.     Vitti does not react.

Ben checks Vitti out of the corner of his eye. No reaction.

Then Ben takes a sharp needle from an instrument tray.

Ben hesitates for a moment to see if Vitti will crack, then

He sticks the needle into Vitti's shoulder.

INT. SING SING - CONSULTATION ROOM - NEXT DAY

Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben.     Dr. Cutler observes

from a chair in the corner.

Vitti looks at the wrong side of the card.    It's all white.

Vitti turns it over and makes a face.

Doctor Cutler looks worried.

SHAPES TEST

Vitti is literally trying to pound a square peg into a round

hole.

VITTI AND BEN

THEMATIC APPERCEPTION TEST

Vitti studies a vague and ambiguous photograph of a man

standing beside a bed with a sleeping woman and child on it.

ANOTHER TEST

INT. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Ben meets with RICHARD CHAPIN, the U.S. Attorney for the

Southern District of New York.

Dr. Cutler?   No, he's annoying, but --

Vitti.

Not crazy. At least not permanently.

In certain people, continuous exposure

to an extremely stressful situation --

soldiers in combat, for instance,

disaster victims, a hostage situation,

or being locked up in a maximum

security prison with someone trying to

kill you -- it can produce a temporary

psychotic state.

How temporary?

A day, a week, up to a month -- if the

precipitating stressors are removed.

Which means he's not going to get any

better while he's still in the can.

He could get worse. He could

deteriorate to the point where he'd be

permanently schizophrenic.

Then I'd say he's got a real problem,

because he goes before the parole

board in four weeks.

You think they'll let him out?

Oh, yeah, I'm sure they'll want to

release a major Mafia figure who's now

totally deranged on top of it.

Well, couldn't you release him to    a

halfway house or some place where    he

could get some decent treatment?

Based on my earlier work with him,    I

don't think he's dangerous, and I

think he was making a real effort    to

reform himself.

You do, huh?

Okay. Then I'll tell you what. I'm

gonna release him into your custody.

Mine? Me? No, this is a bad time for

me. My father just died -- and I've

got this bulging disc in my neck --

and we're redecorating, which is a

total nightmare. I can't --

You want to see him killed in prison?

No, of course not.

Or sent to a facility for the

criminally insane.

No --

Then he's all yours. I'm going to

talk to the Bureau of Prisons and get

you certified as a temporary federal

institution.

What?    I can't be an institution.

You've got thirty days to get him in

shape for his parole hearing. That

means sane, sober and gainfully

employed. But let me warn you,

Doctor. If he fucks up in any way --

if he flees, or if I find out that

this whole thing was just a setup so

he could get back on the street and

return to a life of crime -- I will

hold you totally responsible, and I'll

see that you are stripped of your

license and prosecuted to the full

extent of the law. Are we clear?

Yes.    We're clear.

EXT. SING SING - FEW DAYS LATER

The gate opens and Ben coaxes Vitti outside.     A guard watches

them.

Vitti comes out carrying an overnight bag, walking like a

zombie. Ben leads him over to the car and opens the door for

him. Vitti keeps walking, passing the car.

Ben helps Vitti into the car.     One of Vitti's legs is still

outside.

Ben lifts Vitti's leg into the car and closes the door.

INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Ben STARTS the CAR and pulls away with Vitti still slumped in

his seat. Once out of sight of the prison, Vitti straightens

and turns on Ben, suddenly lucid.

Ben nervously pops a pill and swallows it.

Ben can't believe what he's gotten himself into.

EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - LATER

Ben and Vitti pull into the driveway and get out of the car.

Vitti relents and grabs his stuff from the back seat.

He follows Ben up the stairs.

INT. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - LATER

Chapin is conferring with another U.S. ATTORNEY, DAVIS, and

Agents Miller and Cerrone.

INT. SOBEL HOUSE - LATER

Ben and Laura are in the kitchen, cleaning up the dinner

dishes. Ben is wearing an apron that says "To Heck with

Housework!" and a pair of Playtex rubber gloves. Laura is

angrily muscling dishes around.

She scrubs the plate with manic energy.

She looks up and jumps when she sees Vitti standing there.

Laura smiles at the two men, then exits.

He exits.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ben knocks on Michael's door and walks in without waiting to

be asked.

INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Michael is sitting up in bed reading.

I know the last few weeks have been

kind of tough with Grandpa -- dying

and everything -- and it might've felt

to you like I didn't have time for you

or I didn't care about how you feel.

No, it didn't.

Good. Because I want you to know that

you can talk to me about stuff and

that I can really listen and

understand what you're going through.

I do, Dad.

And if I seemed a little hard on

Grandpa, it's just that your

grandfather was a hard man in a lot of

ways. He wanted everything done his

way and sometimes I just felt like

nothing I ever did was good enough. I

don't want it to be that way with us.

It's not.

And you know, at times like this we

all might start questioning our own

mortality and you might be thinking

how devastated you'd be if I died.

Right?

No.   Not really.

That's good. Good talk. And I

realize it's all a little hectic right

now, but this Paul Vitti thing is only

temporary, okay?

Oh, really? I didn't hear you the

tenth fuckin' time.

That's not funny.   Good night,

Michael.

Ben exits, shaking his head.

The moment he's gone, the rumpled blankets next to Michael

shift, and a CUTE, PUNKY 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL emerges from hiding

under the comforter.

EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - NIGHT

The suburban street is dark and quiet and all the lights are

off in the house.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

The room is dark. We PAN UP the foot of Ben and Laura's bed

and find them both wide awake staring straight up at the

ceiling, listening.

The MOANING shifts into low gear, more guttural and bestial.

The O.S. MOANING kicks up another notch. Laura rolls over

and jams her pillow over her ears. Ben growls, exasperated.

INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Michael's girlfriend is gone. He has his bedroom door open a

crack and he's standing there holding a small tape recorder

and smiling broadly.

EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

Agents Cerrone and Miller sit in a sedan with a small,

sophisticated-looking microphone trained on the Sobel house

just down the street. They hear the high-pitched MOANING.

Miller gives Cerrone a look.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ben takes a deep breath and knocks sharply on the guest room

door. The heavy MOANING STOPS. After a moment, Vitti

appears wearing only a bathrobe. Ben can see the beautiful

SHEILA sitting naked on the bed.

Sheila starts to light a cigarette.

INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Michael freezes, about to light a cigarette himself.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER

Ben comes down the stairs with Vitti.

Ben looks curiously at Vitti.

Vitti heads back upstairs.

INT. DINING AREA - NEXT MORNING

Laura and Ben are hosting a brunch for the out-of-town

relatives. Laura offers a basket of bagels to a seated,

older woman.

She glares at Ben.

A DOOR SLAMS somewhere, then Sheila storms into the room

sobbing, her hair askew, tucking her blouse into her skirt.

Vitti charges into the room, his robe open. From the

reactions of everyone in the room, it's clear he's not

wearing anything under it.

Sheila exits and slams the front door.   Vitti sees everyone

staring at him. He closes his robe.

Vitti heads for the buffet.

Vitti bellies up to the buffet, stepping between an older

couple. He eyes the food disdainfully.

The woman reacts in horror.

INT. BEN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Ben and Vitti enter.   Vitti still in his robe.

Vitti starts for Ben's chair.

He points Vitti to the sofa and takes his own chair.

Ben sees that he's in the line of fire, gets up and moves out

of the way.

Vitti is at a loss.

No.

Astronaut?

No.

Al Capone?

Yeah, maybe.    What did you want to be?

We're not talking about me.

I am.

Fine.   I wanted to be a philatelist.

You wanted to look up people's

assholes all day?

No, Paul, I believe you're thinking of

a proctologist. I wanted to collect

rare and unusual stamps.

You must've been a lot of laughs when

you were a kid. Lonely, huh?

Oh yeah. Big time.      So what did you

want to be?

It's stupid.

You afraid to tell me?

Yeah, I'm afraid.

Then tell me.    I'm not here to judge

you.

Okay. When I was really little --

like seven or eight -- maybe I wanted

to be a cowboy.

A cowboy.   Really?

Yeah. My father gave   me a cowboy

suit -- you know, the  vest, the

chaps, the cap guns --  the whole

thing. And he used to   take me up

to my uncle's farm in  New Jersey

and lead me around on  this pony.

Yippee-i-o. You happy   now?

So you watched cowboy movies and TV

shows with your father.

Everybody. The whole family.     My

father loved 'Gunsmoke.'

Sheriff Dillon.

Marshal Dillon.

Marshal.    So who were your favorite

cowboys?

This is so fuckin' retarded.

Paul!

All right. Gene Autry, Roy Rogers,

the Lone Ranger --

Interesting.   They're all good guys.

Yeah, I guess.

No, that's important. You didn't want

to be the bad guy. You wanted to be

the hero.

Vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep.

He really starts sobbing now.

Vitti fights to regain control.

Suddenly one of the WINDOWS behind Vitti SHATTERS.

Ben dives for cover. Silence -- then another RAP on the

window. Ben looks out and sees JELLY in the back yard,

tossing stones at the window.

Ben waves him around to the side door.

INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

Jelly is loading up a plate of food from the buffet, talking

to the elderly relatives. Laura stares at him.

Ben enters.

Jelly and Ben exit.

EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ben and Jelly walk out to the driveway where Jelly's Buick is

parked.

Vitti, now dressed, comes out of the house and crosses to the

car.

Jelly STARTS the CAR and slowly backs out of the driveway.

Ben runs after the car, talking to Vitti through the open

window.

Vitti puts the window up.

The car pulls away.

Ben turns and sees his Aunt Goldie on the porch.

INT. KNIGHTS OF PALERMO SOCIAL CLUB - DAY

Soldiers lounge at the bar, keeping a respectful distance

from the capos seated at a table in the rear. All eyes turn

as the door opens and Vitti enters.

SAL MASIELLO, Vitti's old consigliere rises and warmly but

warily welcomes Vitti back into the fold.

Vitti embraces him and they sit down with the others.

Vitti gives his old friend a pat on the back and exits.

EXT. LOPRESTI HOUSE - SAME MORNING

Jelly pulls up, Vitti gets out and strides up to the front

door of a nice home on Staten Island and RINGS the BELL.

INT. ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The door is opened by EDDIE DEVOL, early thirties, dark and

sullen.

Vitti punches Eddie in the mouth, sending him sprawling back

into the living room. Several other bodyguards are watching

television, caught off guard by Vitti's sudden entrance.

INT. PATTY'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vitti enters. PATTY LOPRESTI, mid-forties, still sexy even

in an apron, is mixing cake batter in a bowl with an electric

mixer.

Patty hugs and kisses him, taking the opportunity to pat him

down for a weapon or a hidden wire.

Vitti explodes, reaches across the counter and grabs her by

the shoulders.

Vitti lets her go.

She holds the beaters out to him.

He heads for the door.

After Vitti leaves, Eddie enters from the other door.

EXT. PARK AVENUE AUDI DEALERSHIP - LATER

Vitti is trying to sell an $80,000 Audi to the

MacINERNYS, an upscale middle-aged couple. Vitti opens

the trunk.

The MacInernys laugh uncertainly.

The MacInernys look doubtful.

INT. MORETTI'S STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT

A crowd of well-heeled New Yorkers surround Vitti at the

captain's station. Vitti, the new host, greets a prominent

sports figure who embraces him like an old friend.

JOEY BOOTS, an old acquaintance of Vitti's, enters with a

couple of his cronies.

The Maitre D' crosses away and waves at Vitti.

Joey and his friends nod condescendingly.

Joey and his guys walk away, they turn back and glance at

Vitti, then whisper something in audible to each other

and laugh.

Vitti burns, humiliated.

FLASH PHOTO

Vitti poses for a picture with some notables.

ANOTHER PHOTO

Vitti with some Broadway actors.

ANOTHER PH0TO

Vitti poses grimly with a BUSINESSMAN and his friends.

Vitti moves to leave.

He slips Vitti a couple of bills.        Vitti stares at the money

in his hand.

He takes a small loaf from the breadbasket on the next table,

stuffs it into the Businessman's mouth and walks off.

INT. IMPERIAL DIAMONDS - DAY

Two Hassidim are in the back of a 47th Street jewelry store,

sorting through a huge pile of diamonds.

Behind the    display counter, Vitti stares at the diamonds,

breathing    hard, starting to perspire. His customers, a

thirty-ish    YOUNG MAN and his FIANCEE, study the diamond

engagement    ring on her finger.

He starts instinctively casing the store.

Ben's cousin, approaches Vitti who is now

hyperventilating.

INT. CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY

The MacInernys are trembling.

The MacInernys rush out of the showroom.

DREAM SEQUENCE - INT. BEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Vitti is on the sofa. He's wearing a shiny, silk, short-

sleeved shirt with the sleeves turned up, tight, black chino

pants and short, black, pointy-toed boots. His hair is oiled

and coifed like early Frankie Avalon.

BEN

is listening to Vitti, but dressed as Sigmund Freud.

VITTI'S MOTHER is sitting next to him.

Ben (Freud) has a large TAXI METER TICKING away beside him.

Suddenly, the WINDOWS are SHATTERED by GUNFIRE.

DOOR

BLASTS open, flying off the hinges. Jelly enters, pushed

into the room by a gang of thugs, led by Patty LoPresti,

Eddie DeVol and his guys, all at least ten-feet-tall and all

holding huge guns.

VITTI

leaps to his feet and reaches for his gun, but instead pulls

out a long sword. Confused but desperate, he holds up the

sword to menace the intruders, but the sword suddenly goes

limp. He tries to make the blade stand up, but it just keeps

dropping like a piece of soft rope.

Patty, Eddie, and the thugs laugh contemptuously at Vitti,

while Jelly looks on with an incredible stream of tears

pouring from his eyes.

END DREAM SEQUENCE.

INT. GUEST ROOM - NEXT DAY

Vitti is back in bed in his robe, still asleep. The door

opens and Laura enters with an interior decorator who has

fabric samples over her arm.

She sees Vitti and quickly steers the decorator back outside.

She comes back in, closes the bedroom door and confronts

Vitti who is still groggy from his troubling dream.

EXT. SOBEL FRONT PORCH - LATER

Jelly   comes out the front door with Vitti's suitcases as Ben

pulls   into the driveway. He gets out of the car holding a

small   bag from the drugstore and sees Vitti coming out the

front   door. Ben stops him on the porch.

Jelly carries the luggage to his car parked in the driveway.

Ben sits on the wicker divan.

He empties the drugstore bag and hands it to Vitti.

Vitti sits on a wicker chair.

Ben breaks down and cries what amounts to one racking sob,

then quickly pulls himself together.

Ben takes a pill bottle out of his pocket and pops a couple

of pills.

EXT. NOGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Ben and Laura walk up to a trendy Japanese restaurant in

Chelsea. Ben is really keyed up.

Ben pops a couple of pills.

Ben opens the door and motions for Laura to enter.

INT. FBI CAR - SAME TIME

Cerrone and Miller watch the front of the restaurant.

They drive off.

INT. NOGO RESTAURANT - LATER

Seated at a table are Ben and    Laura, Vitti and Sheila, Jelly,

and the producer RAOUL BERMAN    and his uptight, downtown

GIRLFRIEND. Jelly inspects a     piece of raw octopus, while

Raoul gushes over a platter of    sushi and sashimi.

Raoul picks up a floppy piece of raw fish with his

chopsticks.

Raoul chuckles and glances uncomfortably at his girlfriend.

Ben laughs loudly to cover the awkward moment. He's

suffering from some reaction between the pills and the booze

and he's oddly thick-lipped.

Why you talkin' like that?

Like what?

Like a fuckin' retard.

Oh -- this? I took a couple ibuprofen

before we got here -- I shouldn't have

had the saki. I'll be fine. It only

lasts a couple hours.

Rah-oo. Row. Rowl. I guess you need

both lips for that name. You know

what I love about Paul? He

was born without a filter. He

says exactly what he's thinking --

just lays it right out there. He

doesn't edit himself.

You wanna shut the fuck up?

See? He just told me to shut the fuck

up. No filter. I love that.

Isn't he great?

Too much buffering. Way too much.

Yes. Paul, I'm such a huge fan of

yours -- not a fan, but you know, an

admirer.

Don't admire me too much.

Is there any chance you might be

interested in working on 'Little

Caesar' as a consultant? Give us

technical advice, coach the actors,

make sure the dialogue rings true --

Laura chokes on her drink.

She glares at Ben as the table descends into silence.

Vitti's eyes suddenly go wide.

He grabs Sheila and pulls her down as GUNFIRE rakes the wall

behind them. Everybody else at the table hits the floor.

Other diners scream in terror.    Jelly pulls a GUN and SHOOTS

back.

A LONE GUNMAN

runs from the restaurant. After a long beat, the frightened

patrons start to get up and chatter nervously.

BEN'S TABLE

Nobody's hurt.   Vitti helps Sheila to her feet.

Raoul crawls up from behind the table.

EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jelly stands in front of an apartment building parking

garage. A guy comes walking up the ramp toward him. As he

comes nearer, we see that the guy is the Gunman from the

restaurant.

The guy stops, pulls out a Zippo and lights it for Jelly.

The Gunman recognizes Jelly and desperately reaches for the

gun in his pocket, but Jelly hauls off and whacks the guy

across the back of the head with a sap. As  he slumps into

Jelly's arms, Vitti steps out of a doorway and Jelly drags

the gunman into the garage.

INT. SOBEL HOUSE - SAME TIME

Ben and Laura are getting ready for bed.

Laura goes to Ben and embraces him.

Ben almost starts to break, but he holds it back.

Ben sits heavily on the bed.

She sits next to him and takes his hand.

She kisses him.

He looks at her expectantly.

She puts her arms around him and holds him.

EXT. ROOFTOP - LATER THAT NIGHT

Vitti and Jelly stand with the Gunman on the roof of the

parking garage, four stories above the ground. The guy's

arms are bound. Jelly ties a rope around his ankles.

Jelly shoves the guy to the parapet at the edge of the roof,

grabs him by the legs and hangs him over the side of the

building. The guy screams.

The guy keeps screaming.

Jelly swings the guy against the building, hitting his head

and dazing him momentarily.

Jelly drops the guy.

The Gunman plunges three stories and lands heavily in a

dumpster full of garbage.

EXT. RIGAZZI PLUMBING AND HEATING - NEXT MORNING

A "family" business in Jersey.

INT. BACK ROOM - NEXT MORNING

The light from outside barely penetrates the painted windows

of the shabby office.

LOU RIGAZZI, aka "Lou the Wrench," the aging boss of the

Rigazzi family, sits in the half-light as a couple of his

soldiers enter with the battered and hobbling Gunman between

them.

Rigazzi pulls out a GUN with a silencer and SHOOTS the

Gunman.

EXT. BACK-YARD SWIMMING POOL - DAY

A big, family barbecue is going on in a back yard in Queens.

Several children are splashing in an over-sized, above-ground

swimming pool. Oddly, the children appear to be shouting and

laughing but make no sound.

At the barbecue, Nicky Caesar is watching his friend MELLO

turn Italian sausage on the grill.

The wind shifts and blows the smoke from the barbecue in

their faces.

We PULL BACK to reveal the set of "Little Caesar." Assistant

directors and production assistants echo the director:

"We're cut!" "Reset!" "Effects!"

Vitti observes the action sitting in a director's chair,

still brooding over the previous night's events. Raoul sits

next to him.

ANTHONY BELLA joins them.

Raoul laughs hard.

Vitti looks around, his future plans now beginning to form.

He exits.   Vitti turns to Raoul.

He hurries off to talk to his assistant.   Jelly comes up to

Vitti.

MONTAGE

Jelly and Vitti's old crew, MO-MO, BIGS, TUNA, EDDIE COKES,

and eight or nine other wiseguys walk en masse into base

camp.

Vitti's guys go to the front of the lunch line, forcing the

crew aside.

A big, pop-out trailer labeled "Mr. Vitti," guarded by three

of his guys. Tuna brings a lunch tray and knocks on the

door. Jelly opens the door and takes the tray.

Vitti conferring with Raoul and Tony Bella on the script,

ripping out whole sections.

Vitti in the makeup trailer getting a haircut and manicure

while he smokes a cigar and talks on his cell phone.

Vitti with the costumer, approving and nixing various

wardrobe choices, while Jelly steals an expensive watch in

the b.g.

Vitti in a massage chair getting a backrub from a masseuse.

A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT approaches him.

Eddie Devol, Patty LoPresti's guy, watches Vitti from a safe

distance.

EXT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

Ben comes out of the market carrying several grocery bags and

a small prescription bag. Two Mafia SOLDIERS step up beside

him and urge him toward a big stretch LIMO IDLING at the

curb.

INT. KNIGHTS OF PALERMO - LATER

Ben enters timorously, still carrying his groceries.

Patty LoPresti, Masiello and a couple of other heavyweights

are sitting at the table, all except Patti smoking cigars.

Ben immediately recognizes their status and grasps the

gravity of their mood.

The Soldier sits Ben down. The other soldier takes his

groceries. Ben looks at Patty, trying to gauge her role.

He drops the bags heavily onto the bar.

He hesitates.

Ben looks at her, sensing her command of the group.

Ben offers his hand but she ignores it.

She reaches under the table and grabs Ben's balls.    He winces

in pain.

He takes his groceries and edges away.

INT. "LITTLE CAESAR" SET - DAY

Vitti is sitting at a table with Jelly and some of his main

guys. From a distance it looks like they're playing cards.

Up close it's a different story.

Vitti turns to see Patty, Eddie Devol and his men heading

across the set.

They all laugh.

An ASSISTANT DIRECTOR approaches the group.

Eddie grabs the Assistant Director and walks him away.

passing by.

As Patty and her men walk away down one aisle of trucks and

campers, Rigazzi and his men walk down the next aisle heading

for the set.

They narrowly miss seeing each other.

EXT. BASE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

Ben arrives looking for Vitti. He       sees Patty approaching and

freezes, then quickly ducks behind      a nearby truck, shielding

his crotch. Patty and her men pass       by. Ben waits until they

pass, then comes out of hiding and      hurries on.

behind him.

Vitti stomps his foot down on Ben's, flooring the

accelerator.

Ben is on the edge of panic.

Ben executes a hard, SKIDDING left.   The Benz stays right

with him.

EXT. HOBOKEN STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Pedestrians scatter as Ben makes a sudden turn into a bank

drive-thru. He over-steers and wipes out an ATM machine,

sending up a cloud of bills that flutter down like confetti.

INT. CAR

MERCEDES

follows right behind him, then the bystanders run to pick up

the cash, blocking the drive-thru, forcing Miller in the FBI

car to stop.

EXT. HOBOKEN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Two police officers are parked at the curb. They hear a HORN

HONKING, and turn just as Ben's car comes flying past them.

The cops start to pull out but stop short as the Benz blows

by, swerving to avoid hitting them.    The cops take off in hot

pursuit.

INT. BEN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

GUNFIRE SHATTERS the rear WINDOW of the car.

Vitti puts his left foot on the gas pedal and his left hand

on the wheel.

driver's seat.

tennis racket, sneakers, an empty Macy's box.

INSERT - TENNIS RACKET

is crushed under the Mercedes' wheels.

INT. BEN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Ben picks up the only thing left -- the New York Times.   He

starts leafing through it.

Bent throws the paper out the window.

BENZ DRIVER'S POV

The Times hits the windshield and one double-page sticks,

totally OBSCURING the driver's VIEW.

EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vitti throws a 180, SKIDDING to a stop just inches from the

river's edge. The Benz, with the newspaper covering the

windshield, sails past them and right off the embankment. It

seems to hang in the air for a long time, then lands with a

big splash and starts to sink almost immediately.

BEN AND VITTI

They jump out of the car and watch the Mercedes disappear

under the water.

They hear POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING. Vitti starts walking

away quickly. Ben follows after him.

Vitti takes off running, ducking behind the rows of parked

cars.

POLICE CARS and the FBI CAR SCREECH into the parking lot and

surround Ben.

EXT. RIVERBANK - LATER

Police divers search for the sunken Mercedes in the middle of

Vitti is hurriedly collecting his stuff, talking to Jelly and

Vitti watches impatiently while the makeup artist touches up

Tony Bella.

Vitti starts for the door.

Tony Bella likes something about Vitti's inflection.

EXT. MAKEUP TRAILER - MOMENT LATER

The door flies open and Tony Bella comes flying out of the

trailer backwards, hitting the pavement hard. Vitti charges

out of the trailer and storms away. Tony wipes blood from

under his nose.

EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - LATER

A cab pulls up to the house, and Ben gets out.

He walks up the driveway and sees Jelly's car parked at the

back door and a big man in a dark suit and tie wiping the

windshield.

The guy in the suit turns.   It's Michael.

Laura comes out of the house.

They kiss.     Then Ben turns to Michael.

He kisses Laura again and takes off.

EXT. LITTLE DARLING'S - LATER THAT NIGHT

Several limos are parked outside a family-owned nightclub in

Queens.

Ben pulls up, leaning way back in the driver's seat of

Michael's, half-painted, modified '82 Honda Civic with the

BUBBLING MUFFLERS.

INT. CIVIC - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Ben takes out a bottle of pills. He tries to remove the

child-safety cap but his hands are shaking so badly he can't

do it. Frustrated, he tries to bite the cap off, then gives

up and throws the bottle away.

EXT. LITTLE DARLING'S - SAME TIME

Ben enters the club.

A moment later, Cerrone and Miller cruise by in an unmarked

car and park at the end of the block.

INT. CLUB ENTRANCE - MOMENT LATER

Ben enters the nightclub and starts moving through the crowd,

looking for Vitti.

He pushes through and sees Jelly and a few of the guys

watching an exotic dancer, a beautiful young blonde in a

skimpy costume, standing on a platform grinding in mock

ecstasy.

Jelly tucks a few bills into her G-string.     She looks at Ben

and winks suggestively.

Ben reluctantly digs in his pocket and holds out a bill to

the stripper.

The stripper sensuously fingers the top of her G-string, and

Ben gingerly sticks the twenty in it.

He tentatively reaches for some smaller bills in her G-string

but she dances away.

He turns around to talk to Jelly, but he's already gone.

Ben finds Jelly at a table with Vitti.

Eddie DeVol enters, flanked by his main guys, AL PACINO and

ENORMOUS BOBBY.

Ben laughs.   Al Pacino glares at him.

He heads for the back of the club with his guys.   Vitti and

Jelly start to follow.

Vitti violently shakes off Ben's hand.

He walks away leaving Ben frozen.

Ben watches as they disappear through a door leading to the

back of the club. He starts toward the door.

INT. BASEMENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Vitti is seated at a big table in the crowded, smoke-filled

room. Jelly sits at  his side. He's surrounded by his crew,

about a half-a-dozen guys, and Patty's man, Eddie DeVol.

Several street maps and diagrams are spread out on the table.

Vitti pulls a street map to the center of the table and taps

a spot downtown.

Ben enters the back room of the club, looks around, and

starts down the stairwell leading to the basement.

INT. BASEMENT STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ben makes his way down the cramped, dimly-lit stairway and

approaches the door to the basement room.

He raises his hand to knock, then hesitates and stands there

for a moment listening to the MUFFLED VOICES inside.

Suddenly he is grabbed from behind and slammed up against the

door by Enormous Bobby. Bobby slams him against the door a

couple of more times, using Ben's head as a doorknocker. The

door is opened by someone inside and Enormous Bobby shoves

Ben into the room.

INT. BASEMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Ben hits the floor to a chorus of surprised reactions from

the guys. Enormous Bobby pulls Ben off the floor by his

lapels.

Al Pacino puts his gun to Ben's head.

He starts muscling Ben to the door.

Vitti hesitates.

EXT. LITTLE DARLING'S - LATER THAT NIGHT

Agents Cerrone and Miller watch the front of the club from

their car parked across the street.

THEIR POV

A dozen men looking like Vitti and his crew come out of the

club and get into the limos.

The limos drive off.

At the corner, the FBI car pulls out and follows at a

discreet distance.

EXT. QUEENSBOROUGH BRIDGE - NIGHT

The FBI car follows the limos across the bridge into

Manhattan.

nondescript nobodies.

Miller watches intently.

Cerrone stares with the growing awareness that they've been

had.

INT. MANHATTAN WAREHOUSE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

Vitti's guys are dressed like construction workers as they

load their gear into two trucks. Vitti supervises while

others work on a New York City bus.

Eddie DeVol, Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby stand guard over

the whole scene, in case anyone is thinking of defecting.

Ben is wearing heavy dungarees and an oversized plaid shirt,

struggling to lace his work boots. Jelly approaches him and

tosses a bulletproof vest on the table.

He glances at Eddie DeVol.

He holds up an automatic rifle.

He holds up another rifle.

Ben sees Eddie watching him and gingerly picks up a 9mm

handgun.

Ben puts the gun into the waistband of his dungarees, but it

slips through and drops into his pants.

He jams his hand down the front of his pants and starts

searching around in there. Eddie and Enormous Bobby stare at

him as they walk by.

He shakes his leg and the gun drops out of his cuff and

clatters onto the floor. He smiles weakly and picks it up.

Vitti approaches.    He looks agitated but under tight control.

Jelly exits.

Vitti walks off.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Vitti comes in, locks the door and has a full-blown panic

attack -- gasping for breath, sweating, whimpering, trying to

stifle his panic. Then he sees his tortured face in the

mirror and starts pulling himself together.

INT. WAREHOUSE - FEW MINUTES LATER

The guys are getting into the trucks. Ben keeps letting

everybody go in front of him, then starts to back away, but

Eddie and Enormous Bobby come up behind him and push him up

into the truck.

EXT. MANHATTAN WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The big doors open and two trucks roll out carrying Vitti,

Ben and the crew.

INT. LEAD TRUCK - SAME TIME

lined up along the sides like paratroopers waiting to jump.

just staring intently.

EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The trucks make their way past the aircraft carrier Intrepid

heading downtown.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT (LATER)

Vitti, Ben, and Eddie DeVol stand next to the treads of a

giant crane.

Ben slips it off and hands it to him. Vitti smashes it on a

rock with the butt of his gun, then tosses it back to Ben.

Vitti's RADIO SQUAWKS and the spotter's voice is heard.

Vitti keys his radio twice as a signal and holds up his

clenched fist to alert the guys on site with him.

EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - NIGHT

A CONVOY of vehicles emerges from the bowels of the building

and turns onto the street. In front and back are specially-

equipped SUVs, full of heavily-armed federal marshals; an

armored truck in the middle carries the gold.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET - SAME TIME

The convoy RUMBLES past a block-long, high-rise construction

site, totally enclosed by a plywood wall around the

perimeter.

VITTI

He can hear the convoy passing outside the wall.

SPOTTER

He looks down on the convoy from a vantage point on a

scaffold high above the street. When the trucks are in the

right position, he waves to Vitti on the ground.

VITTI

sees the signal.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A forty-foot, flat-bed trailer truck loaded with cement

conduit backs across the street and stops, blocking the path

of the convoy.

The lead SUV HONKS. The truck doesn't move. The CAPTAIN of

the marshals gets out and walks up to the truck. The driver

has slipped out the other side and disappeared.

Suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes

around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points

crunching into the metal sides. Then the truck starts rising

off the pavement. A couple of determined marshals jump out

of their vehicles, race over and grab onto the bumpers as the

armored truck is lifted off the ground.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A hundred-foot tower crane lifts the truck straight up. The

marshals hang on as long as they can, then prudently let go

and drop heavily to the street. Two marshals are still

clinging to the truck as it rises to a height of thirty feet,

then swings silently over the perimeter fencing.

INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE

A bank of arc lights is switched on illuminating the site as

the truck is lowered to the ground. Heavily-armed gangsters

in ski masks surround the truck and herd the driver, the

shotgun guard and the frightened marshals

into a construction shack, while men with acetylene torches

attack the back doors.

Vitti pulls down his ski mask and taps Ben.

He strides off to take charge. Ben pulls down his mask and

hurries after him, but runs right into a pole.

He raises his mask and scampers after Vitti rubbing the

painful bump on his forehead.

EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

The marshals run around, frantically searching for a way into

the construction site.

VITTI

Totally in charge, he strides up to the armored truck just as

his men finish cutting through the steel plate doors. Vitti

yanks the doors open..

Vitti and Ben stare in awe at the exposed contents of the

truck -- a fortune in gold bars.

Eddie and his guys run up with a long, narrow track with

metal rollers and set it up at the rear of the gold truck.

EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

The marshals are trying to climb over the construction site

wall, but they're stopped by rolls of razor wire and

SUPPRESSING FIRE from inside the site.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE

The guys take the heavy bars out of the armored truck and run

them quickly along the rolling track into the bus.

INT. BUS - SAME TIME

Jelly is pulling on the hat and jacket of a transit authority

bus driver. The floor boards of the bus have been lifted out

and the guys are laying the gold bars in the hollow under the

floor.

He hears a LOUD CRASH and all eyes turn to the gates.

Eddie goes off to help transfer the gold.

EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

The marshals back up one of the SUVs and run it into the

gates again.

INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE

The big, wooden GATES SHUDDER but Vitti's men roll two

enormous earthmovers up to reinforce the gates.

Vitti drags him off toward the building structure.

Inside the structure, Vitti spins him around and shakes him.

Suddenly, he slaps Vitti hard across the face.      They both

freeze.

Ben lets it all go, sobbing for all the years of pain.

Vitti looks at him.

Both men are crying now.

Jelly comes around the corner and sees the two men in a weepy

embrace.

Another huge CRASH as the marshals ram the gates again, this

time tearing loose one of the big hinges.

Vitti, Ben and Jelly run to the bus, but Eddie pulls a gun

and stops them. Al and Bobby cover Jelly and the rest of the

crew. Vitti backs away slowly.

He cocks the gun and is about to pull the trigger when Ben

suddenly roars and slams him in the head with his gun. Vitti

and Jelly quickly cover Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby.

Sitting on Eddie's chest, he presses the gun against Eddie's

nose.

They shove Eddie, Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino into the back

of the armored truck, Vitti gives a signal and the crane

lifts it off the ground.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The armored truck comes down fast and drops heavily to the

street. Federal MARSHALS swarm the truck and find Eddie, Al,

and Bobby sprawled in the back.

The marshals handcuff them.

Suddenly, the marshals hear AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE coming

from the next block.

Uniformed SWAT COPS come running from that direction and

shout to the marshals.

The marshals rush toward the sound of the GUNFIRE and

disappear around the corner.

NEXT BLOCK

As the marshals round the corner, they see a police shoot-out

in progress.

Wiseguys are FIRING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at cops who are pinned

down behind police cruisers.

The Captain of the marshals FIRES a warning SHOT in the air.

The head wiseguy, Anthony Bella, turns in surprise.

Raoul strides out into the street, furious, still talking

through his bullhorn.

The Captain and the marshals look around and see that they're

on the set of "Little Caesar."

The Captain walks toward Raoul until they are almost face to

face, shouting at each other through their BULLHORNS.

The ASSISTANT DIRECTOR addresses the TV crew.

On the perimeters of the set, the PA's signal the off-duty

cops who work the set to release the real traffic they've

been holding on the cross streets.

A city bus passes behind Raoul and Tony Bella who are still

screaming at the Federal Marshal.

EXT. 11TH AVENUE - MINUTES LATER

In mid-block, SWAT cops step into the street and wave the bus

to a halt.

INT. BUS - SAME TIME

Ben is sitting in the back with Vitti as the helmeted SWAT

cops board the bus.

The cops walk toward the back and confront Ben.

The cops unmask. It's Mo-Mo, Cokes, and Tuna.     They laugh

and slap hands with Vitti and Ben.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The bus pulls out and joins the flow of traffic heading

downtown.

INT. BUS - MINUTES LATER

All the guys are looking pretty happy with their score.

Ben turns to Vitti.

EXT. RIGAZZI PLUMBING AND HEATING - NEXT MORNING

A Rigazzi company van is forced open by a team of FBI agents led

by Agent Miller. Stacked inside are forty gold bars.

Agent Cerrone comes out of the building with Lou Rigazzi and

several associates in handcuffs.

U.S. Attorney Chapin makes a statement to the media.

EXT. PATTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

Vitti knocks on the front door.    Patty answers it in her

robe.

She adjusts her robe, providing Vitti a quick peek.

Patty smiles and shrugs.

EXT. EAST RIVER BOARDWALK - LATER MORNING

Ben is leaning against the railing gazing at the water when

Vitti walks up.

Ben gives up.

They embrace. Then Vitti starts to walk away toward Jelly

who has been waiting at a respectful distance.

Vitti stops and turns.

The ORCHESTRA SWELLS as we CRANE UP TO the Brooklyn Bridge

and Lower Manhattan beyond.
