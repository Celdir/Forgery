--------------------------------------------------------------

Title

EXT. VARIOUS DAYS

'She' plays through the credits.

Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our

time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of

glamour and sophistication and mystery.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.  We

follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of

bread.  It is spring.

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

It's a full fruit market day.

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

A man in denims exits the tattoo studio.

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

Sure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant.

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - SATURDAY

A frantic crowded Portobello market.

The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained

glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes

and saints.

EXT. GOLBORNE ROAD - DAY

Shot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant,

the sign still being painted.  He receives and approves a huge

fresh salmon.

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

We arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello.

INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY

The house has far too many things in it.  Definitely two-

bachelor flat.

Spike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual

hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very

white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears

only shorts.

The t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien

coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere.  It says 'I Love

Blood.'

He heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...

And he re-enters in a white t-shirt, with a large arrow,

pointing down to his flies, saying, 'Get It Here.'

He comes down wearing it.  Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the

most beautiful woman in the world.'

Spike turns and walks upstairs proudly.  Revealing that on the

back of the t-shirt, also printed in big letters, is written

'Fancy a fuck?'

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'

William enters.

INT. THE BOOKSHOP - DAY

It is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere,

with little secret bits round corners with even more books.

Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically.

He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist.  Perhaps without

cause.  A few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the

desk.

He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in.

We only just glimpse her.

Cut to William working.  He looks up casually.  And sees

something.  His reaction is hard to read.  After a pause...

It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --

in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.

When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.

She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a

quite smart coffee table book.

He picks up a book on the counter.

William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor

beside him.

Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and

approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.

He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does

William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the

shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has

observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.

She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there.

She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it.

Thief leaves.

She hands William a $B!r(J20 note and the book he said was rubbish.

He talks as he handles the transaction.

He drops in one of the signed books.

She looks at him with a slight smile.

And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a little

dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in.

But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.

They set about drinking their coffees.

Martin shakes his head.  William drains his cappuccino.

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

William sets off.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

William collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park

Road.

EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY

William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of

Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.  The orange

juice,  in its foam cup, flies.  It soaks Anna.

He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting

far too near her breasts in the panic of it...

He jumps back.

In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being

genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him.

He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  She looks down.

She looks up at him.

INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY

They enter.  She carries a few stylish bags.

William runs in further -- it's a mess.  He kicks some old shoes

under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of

breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen.

And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books

from her...

She heads upstairs.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

William is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's feet on

the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black

top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still on.  He

is dazzled by the sight of her.

He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents.

Pause.  She looks at him deep.

It has taken a lot to get this out loud.  He is not a smooth-

talking man.

She smiles.  She's cool.

He guides her towards the door.

In a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door.  He

closes the door and shakes his head in wonder.  Then...

... He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along

the corridor in silence.  There's a knock on the door.  He moves

back, casually...

He opens the door.  It's her.

He shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping

bag.  Then returns and hands it to her.

They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Second time

saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She leans

forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense of the

strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  They part.

Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.

Spike walks in.

Spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen.

And leaves them in the corridor.

And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand.  Spike

comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a

styrofoam container with a spoon.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The lights are off.  William and Spike on the couch, just the

light from the TV playing on their faces.  Cut to the TV full

screen.  There is Anna.  She is in a stylish Woody Allen type

modern romantic comedy, 'Gramercy Park,' in black and white.

INT. MANHATTAN ART GALLERY - DAY

Anna's character -- Woody Anna -- is walking around the gallery

with her famous co-star, Michael.  They should be the perfect

couple, but there is tension.  Anna is not happy.

And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

The next day.  William and Martin quietly co-existing.  An annoy-

ing customer enters.  Mr. Smith.

Pause.

William looks up.  At that moment the entire window is suddenly

taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and

entirely covered with a portrait of Anna -- from her new film,

'Helix.'

INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CONDOR/LIVING ROOM - DAY

William heads upstairs and pauses.  Spike coming down, wearing

full body scuba diving gear.

INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY

The two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen.

EXT. WILLIAM'S TERRACE - DAY

The two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day.

William is reading 'The bookseller.'  The terrace is small and

the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather

wonderful way.  Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.

William closes his eyes in exasperation.

Spike leans back and relaxes.

William freezes -- then looks at Spike.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

William on the phone.  We hear the formal man at the other end of

the phone.  And then intercut with him.

INT. RITZ RECEPTION - DAY

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM

Spike happens to be in the foreground of this shot.  He's read-

ing a newspaper.

Flintstone is indeed the magic word.

He practices how to sound.

We hear her voice -- don't see her.

EXT. RITZ - DAY

William jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz.  He carries a

small bunch of roses.

INT. RITZ HOTEL - DAY

He approaches the lifts.  At the lift, he pushes the button and

the doors open.  As he is getting in, William is joined by a young

man.  His name is Tarquin.

William pushes the button.  They wait for the doors to close.

INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY

The lift lands.  William gets out.  So does Tarquin.  Rooms

30-35 are to the left.  35-39 to the right.  William heads right.

So does Tarquin.

William is puzzled.  He slows down as he approaches room 38.  So

does Tarquin.  William spots, so does Tarquin.  William points

at the number.

He knocks.  A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door.

She hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits,

with the poster picture of Anna, for the film 'Helix.'

INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE ANTE-ROOM - DAY

A few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room.  There

are a number of journalists waiting for their audience.

They both turn to William for his opinion.

They sit down as Karen goes off.

William goes for the cover-up.

Pause.  He's in trouble.

Saved by the bell.

INT. TRAFALGAR SUIT CORRIDOR - DAY

He is shown in through big golden doors.  Karen stays outside.

INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY

There Anna is, framed in the window.  Glorious.

There are lots of other flowers in the room.

A fair amount of tension.  These two people hardly know each

other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.

At which moment Jeremy, Karen's boss, comes in.  A fairly grave,

authoritative fifty-year-old PR man consulting a list.

William nods.

William shrugs his shoulders.  Jeremy settles at a little desk

in the corner and makes notes.  A pause.  William feels he has to

act the part.  They sit in chairs opposite each other.

Anna nods.

Jeremy leaves.

William puts his head in his hands.  He was panic.

Re-enter Jeremy.

Jeremy exits.

It's a challenge.

Pause.  Then they move towards each other when... Jeremy

enters.

Jeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds.

They look at each other.  Jeremy enters, with another journalists

in tow.  Anna and William stand and shake hands formally.

INT. TRAFALGAR SUITE CORRIDOR - DAY

William exits fairly despondent and heads for the door.  Tarquin

is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone.

William can't think his way out of this.

He turns to go, but is accosted by Karen.

INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

A forty-year-old actor with great presence warmly shakes

William's hand.

INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

Same room same seat, minutes later, with a monolingual foreign

actor and an interpreter.

INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

And now William is sitting opposite an eleven-year-old American

girl.

INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY

William emerges traumatized into the corridor.  It is full of

camera crews.  And there is Karen.

INT. ANNA'S SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY

They knock on her door.

William enters.  A certain nervousness.  They are alone again.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bella and Max are in the kitchen.

The oven seems to be smoking a little.  Then the bell rings.

It's bad timing.  Max shoots out of the kitchen.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Max heads for the door impatiently.  He opens it and turns back

without looking at William and Anna standing there.

William and Anna move along the corridor to the kitchen.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bella is there.

He rises from his stove position.

Door bell goes.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Max opens the door -- it is Honey.

She does a little pose, having worn a real party dress.

They head back along the corridor.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

They enter the kitchen.

She hands her a present.

The front door bell goes.

He heads out into the corridor to the front door.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Max opens the door.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

They enter the room.

Doesn't recognize her -- turns to Honey.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A minute or two later -- they are standing, drinking wine before

dinner.  Bernie with Anna on their own -- William helping Max in

the kitchen.

Then on to Bernie's conversation.

They all move towards the kitchen.

A moment's silence as they leave -- then in a split second the

others all turn to William.

The horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds.

Honey re-enters.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

A little later.  They are sat at dinner.  Bella next to Anna.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

Moving on through the evening -- they are very relaxed, as they

eat dinner.  A few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna

is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing.

And there's a cake.  Honey wears Bernie's unsuitable hat.  Anna

watches William laughing at something and then putting his head

in his hands with mock shame.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

Coffee time.

A little pause.  Then William turns to Bernie.

Dead silence.

Bella shrugs her shoulders.  Bernie is totally grief-struck.

William reaches for her hand.  Max breaks the sombre mood.

They all laugh.  Anna smiles across at William.

While she says this, quiet settles around the table.  The thing

is -- she sort of means it and is opening up to them.

Silence... they all look at her... then.

The mood is instantly broken.  They all laugh.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Anna and William are leaving.

He holds out his hand to shake.  She kisses him on the cheek.

He stumbles back with joy.

Max loves this.

And Honey gives her a huge hug.

Anna and William head out... Bernie tries to save some dignity.

They move to the door and wave goodbye.

EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

William and Anna step outside.  From inside they hear a massive

and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true

feelings.  William is a little embarrassed.

The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill.

They walk for a moment.  A bit of silence.

They walk in silence for a moment.  Then...

She smiles and shakes her head.

EXT. NOTTING HILL GARDEN - NIGHT

A little later in the walk.

They are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage

behind it.

Her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on

the answer to this.

He rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite

make it, and falls back onto the pavement...

Tiny pause.

He fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously...

They look at each other.

She starts to climb.

But she's already almost over.

A few seconds later.  Anna jumps down into the garden.

William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself

off, and heads towards where she stands.

She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first

time -- she kisses him.  This time a proper kiss.  A tiny pause.

EXT. MAGIC GARDEN - NIGHT

They walk around the garden.  It's a moonlit dream.  We see

the lights of the houses that surround the garden.  They come

across a single, simple wooden bench.

We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.  She

doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917

- 1992.'  She is slightly chocked by it.

He nods.  They are standing on either side of the bench,

looking at each other.  The camera glides away from them, up

into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.  Music

plays.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

William in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower.

He shoots past Spike.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING

He sprints downstairs, now fully dressed.

INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

Mid-film.  We move across the audience.  And there is in the

middle of it, we see Anna, watching the screen, and next to

her, William, watching the film keenly, through his scuba-

diving goggles.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A very smart Japanese restaurant.  We see Anna and William

sitting, near the end of their meal.

We've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table --

now we can hear it.  Two slightly rowdy men.

William and Anna look at each other.

Again -- Anna reacts.

Anna mouths 'Meg Ryan.'

William and Anna smile -- they're enjoying it.

Anna's twinkle fades.

This is horrible.

He gets up and goes round the corner to the men.  There are in

fact four of them, the two meeker men, Gavin and Harry, hanging

on the other guys' witty words.

He's not a very convincing or frightening figure.

Anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without

being recognized.

They walk on and then...

And she walks straight back to their table.

And she walks away.  Gerald turns to Lawrence.

EXT. RITZ ARCADE - NIGHT

They are walking.

They have arrived at the end of the arcade.

His look says yes.

He watches her go -- and stands in the street.  Music plays.

INT. RITZ CORRIDOR/ANNA'S SUITE - NIGHT

William coming along the hotel corridor.  He knocks on the

door.

There's something slightly awry.  He doesn't notice.

He kisses her gently on the cheek.

He is duly shocked.  She's trying to be calm.

Jeff drifts into view behind.  He is a very famous film star and

looks the part -- well built, very handsome.  Unshaven, he has

magic charm, whatever he says.  Over a t-shirt, he wears a

shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks.

And he does just that.  Scoops up the two used plates and heads

to the bin.

Jeff slips him a fiver.

He kisses her.

He wanders off taking off his t-shirt.

Anna just nods.

INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - NIGHT

William walks away.

EXT. RITZ - NIGHT

William walks down the arcade outside the hotel.  He is

stunned.

EXT. LONDON BUS - NIGHT

William sits alone on a bus.  We see him through the side

window.  As it drives away, we see that the whole back of the

bus is taken up with a huge picture of Anna.

INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

He gets into his room and sits on the bed.

INT. SPACESHIP - NIGHT

Space Anna, in the very hi-tech environment and a serious

moods, fastens the last clasps on her uniform.  She takes a

helmet type thing, and places it on her head.

INT. CONNECT CINEMA - NIGHT

Cut round to the Coronet cinema where this film is showing.

It's not full.  The camera moves and finds, sitting on his

own...William.  Just watching.  We see a momentous flash of

light from the screen explode, reflected in his eye.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

William is looking out the window, lost in thought.  Spike

enters.

Spike settles on the arm of a chair.  William decides to open

up a bit...

Spike nods thoughtfully.

He roars with laughter.  William smiles.

INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Only two tables are being used.  William and his friends are

on their first course.  Bernie reads an "Evening Standard,"

with a picture of Anna and Jeff at Heathrow Airport.

Their looks make it obvious that everyone did.

They all look to him for wise words.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The kitchen.  William is looking uneasy.  A doorbell rings.

William nods.  Max heads off to the door.  We stay with William

-- and just hear the door open and a voice come down the

corridor.

They reach the kitchen.  Tessa is a lush girl with huge hair.

She turns to take the wine and William has a split second to send

a message of panic to Bella.  She agrees -- it's bad.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

Max walks over to the table.  Honey, Bella, William and another

girl.

It is left to William, who has been set up here, to fill the

pause.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT

Time for coffee and chocolates.  Beside William sits the final,

perfect girl.  She is Rosie, quite young, smartly dressed,

open-hearted.  It is just Max and William and Bella and her.

They all laugh.  It's going very well.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

William is with Rosie by the door -- just about to say goodbye.

She kisses him gently on the cheek.  He opens the door -- she

walks out.  He shuts the door quietly and heads back into the

living room...

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Max and Bella wait excitedly.

William makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then...

They all roar with laughter.

Music starts to play to take us through these silent scenes.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Max lifts Bella off her couch and carries her upstairs.

Mix through -- William sits on the couch downstairs -- eyes wide

open -- thinking.

INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY

Morning.  Max, all in his suit for the city... Bella kisses him

goodbye.  William sees this from the kitchen.  She is also

dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her

briefcase with law books from the kitchen table.

EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

William emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night

away from home, a heads off.

EXT. NEWSAGENT - DAY

William walks past the newsagent, heading for home.  We see,

though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem

to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front

page.  Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!'

and 'Scott of Pantartica.'

INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY

William is shaving.  The bell goes.  He heads out to answer it.

EXT./INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -DAY

William arrives at the door and opens it.  There stands a dark-

glassed Anna.

She moves inside.  Her hair is a mess -- her eyes are tired.

Nothing idealized.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The two of them.

William shakes his head.

She's very shaken.

INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

Spike enters through the front door.  William doesn't hear him.

Spike is reading newspapers with the Anna pictures in it.

He heads up the stairs.  Opens the bathroom door, walks in.

INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY

Spike heads for the toilet -- undoes his zip...

She's in the bath.  Spike turns in shock -- and sidles out of the

bathroom.

INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

Spike calms himself down.  He then opens the bathroom door

again -- and looks in.

INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY

Anna is still lying low in the bath.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Spike comes back out into the corridor.  Looks to heaven.

INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY

William and Anna at the kitchen table, eating toast, dringking

tea.

He doesn't think she has to talk about this.

EXT. TERRACE - DAY

A little later.  They're in the thick of the script.

Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day.  He is helping.

INT. WILLIAM'S DINING ROOM

Anna and William.  Sat down at table.  There's a picture

hanging on the wall behind.

It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple,

with a goat as company.

Spike enters with three pizzas.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Later in the evening.  William and Anna on their own.  They're

sipping coffee.  A few seconds of just co-existing.  Anna looks

up.

He laughs.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A few hours later -- eating ice-cream out of the tub.

INT. WILLIAM'S UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

They are walking up the stairs -- and stop at the top.

Pause.  She leans forward, kisses him gently, then steps into

the bedroom and closes the door.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

William downstairs -- on a sofa -- under a duvet.  Eyes open.

Thinking.  Pause and pause.

He waits and waits -- the ultimate 'yearn.'  But nothing

happens.  William gets off the sofa decisively.  Sits on the

side of it.  Then gets back in again.

Pause, pause, then... in the darkness, a stair creaks.  There's

someone there.

He drifts round the corner, half-naked.

Back to William thinking again.  Dreamy atmosphere.  And then...

more footsteps on the stairs.

The darkness of the living room.  We see Anna in the shadow.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A few moments later.  William and Anna stand in the middle of

the room.  He kisses her neck.  Then her shoulder.  What a

miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin.  Then

he looks at her face.  That face.  He is suddenly struck by who

it is.

And then gets over it straight away.

And kisses her.

INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The middle of the night.  They are both asleep -- a yard apart.

In sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then

she wriggles across and re-settles herself, tenderly, right

next to him.  He is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this

all is.

INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

The morning.

He looks under the sheet at her breasts.

She laughs...

She looks at him carefully.  Then leaps out of bed.

INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING

William on the bed.  The door opens.  It is Anna with a tray of

toast and tea.

She heads across.  She smiles and sits on the bed.

The doorbell goes.

INT./EXT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

William heads down the corridor and opens the door.  Outside

are hundreds of paparazzi -- an explosion of cameras and

questions, of noise and light.  The press seem to fill the

entire street.

He comes back inside, snapping the door behind him.  Anna is in

the kitchen.

She heads back the corridor, with no suspicion.

She thinks he's fooling around.  She opens the door, the same

explosion.  In a split second she's inside.

INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY

Anna is on the phone.  Spike is blithely heading downstairs to

the kitchen in just his underpants.

He does a thumbs up to William -- very excited about what he knows

was a 'result.'

She heads upstairs.

The moment William goes upstairs, Spike heads for the front

door.

EXT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY

From outside -- we see this scrawny bloke in the frame of the

doorway, in his grey underpants.  A thousand photos.  Spike

poses athletically.

INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY

Spike closes the door and wanders along to a mirror in the hall-

way, muttering.

Inspects himself.

INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

William enters.  He's unhappy for her.  She's almost dressed.

She's packing.

It's a difficult moment -- defining where they stand.

She heads out.

INT. STAIRS/LIVING ROOM - DAY

The doorbell goes.

Spike leans merrily out of the window.

INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY

They move from the kitchen into the corridor.

He takes this in.  That's the end.

She looks at him.  The doorbell goes again.  She opens the door.

Massive noise and photos.  Outside are her people, including

Karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards.  And then the door is shut

and they're all gone.  Silence.

INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY

Spike and William sitting there.  Pause.

He puts his head in his hands.  It's over now.

EXT. LONDON - DAY

As full, sad music plays -- William begins to walk through

Notting Hill.

This walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually

and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter,

back into spring...

First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month

pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.

As he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat

collar -- umbrellas appear.  Followed by winter coats --

chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint

of snow.

Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape,

for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove.

By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and

in a few yards, it is spring again.  He passes Honey again --

arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful.  Then turns

past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby.

The camera holds on her.

INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

A grey day in the bookshop.  Martin and William.  As ever.  A

feeling that things in there ever change.

Ten seconds pass.  Honey rushes in.  Spike, still feeling in

disgrace, comes in with her but lingers in the doorway.

And she rushes out.  William looks at the piece of paper, folds

it and then places it gently in the garbage bin.

INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Bella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle.  All the friends are

gathered in the restaurant.

Tony's brave face breaks.  The dream is over.

They're all rather stunned.

They toast him.

Total bewilderment from the others.

Special cut to Bernie -- the shot shows he had special feelings

for Honey.

As she sits down, Honey leans towards Spike and whispers.

INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Two hours later.  They've had a very good time.  There's been a

chocolate cake.  Lots of alcohol.  Tony is playing 'Blue Moon'

on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing.

At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table.

Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together.

He puts down a copy of the 'Evening Standard' with a picture of

Anna on its cover.

EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY

Cut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath.  William entirely

alone.  He marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it -- and

sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the

radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes.

EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY

Now closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where

he is himself approached.

At that moment -- thirty yards away, William sees trailer door

open.  Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a

velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.

She has a necessary cluster of people about her.  Hair, make-up,

costume and the third assistant who has collected her.

She walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head.  And

sees him.  Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a

simple smile.  His being there is a complicated thing.

Cut back to him.  He does a small wave.  She pauses as the whole

paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them.  The

movie divides them.  But then she begins to walk through it, and

followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.  When

she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her

people hold back.  She doesn't really know what to say...

The third assistant is under pressure.

She looks around.  The poor third is nervous -- and the first is

approaching.

She is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume.

EXT. KENWOOD PARK - DAY

As they make towards the set...

EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY

A complicated shot is about to happen -- with waves of extras --

and a huge moving crane.  They end up next to the sound desk.

Harry the sound man is a pleasant, fifty-year-old balding

fellow.  He hands him the headphones.

William, the headphones on, surveys the scene -- the cluster is

a full 100 yards from the action, to allow a gracious sweeping

wide-shot.  He watches Anna.  She is with her co-star in the

Henry James film -- let's call him James.

He studies an actress a few yards to the left.

Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.  That's his

girl.  Anna prepares.

EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY

Cut back to William -- he has heard.

He takes off the headphones and puts them gently down.

William walks away.  The moment of hope is gone.  He couldn't

have had a clear reminder.

INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

William is emptying Anna Scott videos into a box.

INT. BACKROOM OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAY

The next day.  William is hard at work, doing the accounts in a

dark small room with files in it.  Martin pops his head in.

They head out, Martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing

his hands -- he's in a very good mood.

INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

William enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue

skirt and top.

It's quite a big wrapped parcel, flat -- 3 foot by 4 foot,

leaning against a bookshelf.

Then the door pings.  In walks the annoying customer, Mr. Smith.

Mr. Smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient.

And he leaves.

Pause as William takes this in.

Martin edges up.

Martin is left with Anna.

She's kind in here, not sarcastic.

William returns a little uneasy.

Martin leaves them.

She's awaiting an answer.

He can't really express what he feels.

He feels he must explain.

Pause.

Pause.  She kisses him on the cheek.

Then turns and leaves.  Leaving him.

INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY

The restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed.  The

pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension

lead is on the bare table behind.  They're all sitting there.

Spike enters.

Bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside

William.  It is the original of the Chagall, the poster of which

was on his wall.

They take in the line.  It totally reverses their attitudes.

A pause.

They look at him.  Spike does a big nod.

EXT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAY

Max's car arrives in the street outside.  They pile into the

car.

He shoots out of his door, rushes round and grabs Bella out of

the chair.

EXT./INT. CAR. STANLEY CRESCENT/NOTTING HILL GATE - DAY

Max's car is shooting up Stanley Crescent.  We are inside and

outside the car.

Suddenly the car slams to a halt.

EXT. PICCADILLY - DAY

The car turns illegally right across Piccadilly the wrong way

down a one-way street and ends up outside the Ritz.  William

sprints into the hotel.  Bernie follows.

IT. RITZ LOBBY - DAY

It is the same man.

Man shakes his head.

He turns despondent and takes two steps when the Ritz Man stops

him in his tracks.

William is very grateful.  He kisses the Ritz Man.  Bernie's also

gratuful.  He kisses him too.

A Japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the Ritz

Man gets kissed a third time.

EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

The car speeds through London.  It gets totally stuck at a

junction where no one will let them in.

He gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the

opposite direction.  Our car shoots past him.

They leave him behind.  Honey leans out the window and shouts...

Spike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly

hit by a car.

EXT. THE SAVOY - DAY

They pull to a stop.  William leaps out.

INT. THE SAVOY - DAY

William rushes up to the main desk.

He flashes a card.

Honey shoots into shot, pushing Bella's chair.

INT. SAVOR ROOM - DAY

William runs, searching.  At last finds the room, and enters.

INT. LANCASTER ROOM - DAY

Huge room -- full of press.  Row after row of journalists,

cameras at the front, TV cameras at the back.  Anna clearly

gives press conferences very rarely, because this one is

positively presidential.  She sits at a table at the end of the

room, beside Karen: on her other side is Jeremy, the PR boss,

firmly marshalling the questions.

She's in a slightly melancholic and therefore honest mood.

He points at a journalist he knows.

They love that answer, and all scribble in their note books.

Next question comes from someone straight right next to

William.

He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up.

Anna sees who it is asking.

We cut to Max, Bella, Bernie and Honey, all watching.  Then back

to Anna.

Anna whispers something to Jeremy.

Pause.  Anna looks up at William.  He nods.

They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on --

music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos

of William.  Max and Bella kiss.  Bernie kisses a total stranger.

Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.

Honey hugs him.  It's a new experience for Spike.

Cut to William's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at

Anna.  They are both smiling.

INT./EXT. THE HEMPEL ZEN GARDEN WITH MARQUEEN - DAY

Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the

crowd.

Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at

least four other bridesmaids, all under five.

Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,

pyramidical wedding cake.

William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.  She

tries to brush his hair.

Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is

dancing with Anna -- thrilled.  He does a rather flashy little

move.  Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.

Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a

song, entirely happy in the corner.

EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT

A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out

of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous

-- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.  He's startled.

EXT. GARDEN - DAY

A pretty green communal garden.  Children are playing, watched

by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.  A very

old couple wander along slowly.

A small tai chi group moves mysteriously.  And as the camera

glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden

bench overlooking the garden.  He is reading, she is just

looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.  It

is William and Anna.
