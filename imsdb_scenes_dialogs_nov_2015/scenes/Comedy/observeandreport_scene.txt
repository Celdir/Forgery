FADE IN:

EXT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING

ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK.

A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the

mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN

ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes

the old women. They SCREAM!

The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the

skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the

sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes

them.

The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running

and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR.

The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY,

flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and

flashes ANOTHER GIRL.

It's an all-out Pervert assault!

The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a

fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as

quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an

assassination.

INT. MALL - BUSINESS OFFICES - DAY

MARK, the Mall Manager, walks by a group of women, who

were exposed to the Pervert. They crowd around and

complain loudly.

Mark walks down the hallway that houses all of the

business affair offices. He stops at the RECEPTIONIST'S

desk.

CONTINUED:

The Mall Manager quickly walks off.    On the way, he

passes a JANITOR.

The Mall Manager keeps walking.

INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

The Mall Manager comes into the surveillance room. It's

a small office with monitors that show the different

security cameras around the mall. DENNIS, a Mall

Security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word

ever, turns around in the chair.

Dennis shrugs.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Blackness. White shafts of light sporadically shoot

through the dark and we see IMAGES. A GIANT FLASHLIGHT

is inserted into a UTILITY BELT. MACE is inserted in the

other side. A WALKIE-TALKIE is turned on. A TASER is

sparked. MIRRORED SUNGLASSES are pushed over the nose.

A garage door raises and bright light spills in...

EXT. GARAGE - DAY

A garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up ORANGE

GOLF CART. There's a siren on top that spins around.

The man driving is RONNIE BARNHARDT (28), a stocky mall

security guard whose expression reads all business.

Ronnie pulls out of the garage...

SUPERIMPOSE:    OBSERVE AND REPORT

EXT. MALL - DAY

HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages

through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they

see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater

grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a

car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over.

Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He

looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max.

The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One

skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking

lot.

The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent

orange siren and gives chase.

As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls

up and drives alongside of them.

STEVIE, the leader of the skaters, yells back.

HECTOR, another skater, joins in.

The skateboarders flip Ronnie off and push hard to get

away from him. Ronnie guns it and an all out chase

ensues.

CONTINUED:

Ronnie pulls up alongside of a SLOW SKATER. Ronnie side-

swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash

can and fall.

Ronnie catches up to ANOTHER SKATER. This time, Ronnie

tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too

fast. Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges

and ducks. Ronnie hits the brake. The skater thinks he

has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his

way. The skater nails the car and is thrown over the

hood.

Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie

are left. Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely

behind the two kids.

Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind. Hector

wobbles. Ronnie rams him again. Hector goes swerving

off and falls down hard.

Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie.

Stevie is good. He turns and rides through cars, ollies

over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. Ronnie

burns down the lane beside him.

Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight.    He's

in the clear.

Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie, driving in

reverse straight towards him. Ronnie rams into the

skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass.

Stevie picks himself up slowly and hobbles toward the

golf cart.

INT. MALL - SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING

Ronnie is in the room with the monitors. The skaters sit

across from him. There's a poster on the wall with the

security guard motto: OBSERVE AND REPORT.

Ronnie fiddles with his walkie-talkie.

The Skaters start laughing louder.

Ronnie picks up the walkie-talkie and turns it on.   He

speaks into it.

CONTINUED:

Ronnie winks at the Skaters.

Ronnie picks up the walkie and whispers into it.

The Skaters start laughing.

The VOICE fades as Ronnie turns off the Walkie.

CONTINUED:

Ronnie takes his pad out of his pocket.    He begins

writing.

Ronnie fills out the paperwork, sets the suspension notes

on the table. Stevie looks down at it. He picks it up,

reads it, balls it up, and throws it at Ronnie.

The Skaters start cracking up.

Ronnie sits there while the Skaters laugh.

of it!

Ronnie goes back to giving the interview as if nothing

happened.

CONTINUED:

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

BRANDI, the make-up counter girl, globs on tons of make-

up. She's a hot girl who looks like she's spent a few

up to her.

Brandi looks up from her mirror and then goes back to

posters up with instructions on how to execute choke

holds, wrist locks, and other assorted death blows.

However, the biggest decoration is a large diagram of the

mall.

Ronnie stands in the middle of his room with his MOM

across from him. She's an old, thick boozer, with the

strength of a father and the love of a mother. She downs

a full beer and throws it against the wall.

Ronnie and his Mom take to fighting. Ronnie's Mom is

surprisingly good and she lands the first blows to

Ronnie's cranium.

Ronnie attacks his Mom. He manages to scoop her and body

slam her to the ground. Ronnie's Mom flips out of it on

the ground. However, Ronnie holds onto her wrist and

stands up, thus locking in the submission hold.

Ronnie flips the wrist lock tighter!

CONTINUED:

Ronnie lets his Mom go.     She shakes off the pain.

Ronnie's Mom rubs her arm. Ronnie drops his guard and

comes over to tend to his Mom's wounds. However, she's

only playing possum. Ronnie's Mom sees an opening and

attacks Ronnie at his legs. Ronnie goes down and the two

start wrestling again.

(NOTE: This plays as realistic as possible, no phony

punches or smooth/comedy fighting, it looks like a school

yard fight video. Sloppy and real.)

INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Ronnie is laying in bed while his Mom chugs another beer

drunk. They're watching Ronnie on the news from earlier.

the floor.

Toyota pulls up to the parking lot. The car comes to a

stop and out steps Brandi, the makeup counter girl.

Brandi walks toward the mall to start her new day. As

she crosses the parking lot and heads toward the door,

the Pervert pops out. This time, he's upped his attack

and beats off staring right at her.

The horrendous sight stops Brandi dead in her tracks.

She SCREAMS bloody murder...

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

chair and is surrounded by a large group of mall

dumb.

out of the Department Store and down through the middle

of the mall.

EXT. MALL - DAY

A black UNMARKED POLICE CAR pulls up quickly and stops

directly in front of the Main Entrance to the mall as if

Devil Worshipper guy. Beside him is a       sketch of the

Pervert. The images are on the bottom       points of a

Pyramid.

On top of the Pyramid is a combination drawing/picture of

Ronnie. The body is drawn with his arms folded across

his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top. The

whole thing adds up to nonsense, with the only clear idea

exits,   a car drives by BLARING RAP MUSIC. The passenger

throws   a beer bottle at Ronnie. He dodges it and the

bottle   shatters on the ground.

he's okay. Detective Harrison waves back, then PEELS OUT

OF THERE. Ronnie is confused.

CONTINUED:

Detective Harrison keeps on driving without looking back.

EXT. CROSSROADS - A SHORT TIME LATER

Ronnie looks petrified as he stands guard.       A BUM stands

off to the side staring Ronnie down.

Ronnie waves to the bum. The bum runs his finger under

his throat. Ronnie tries to ignore him.

A group of KIDS walk by Ronnie talking loudly.

Ronnie grabs the little Kid by the shoulders to restrain

him.

Unbeknownst to Ronnie, Gang Members start walking up

behind him. It's like that scene in Training Day where
