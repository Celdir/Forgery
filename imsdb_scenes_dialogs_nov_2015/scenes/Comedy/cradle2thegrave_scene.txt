CRADLE TO THE GRAVE

FADE IN:

EXT. STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY

End of the day.     An armored truck moves through the city of

Los Angeles.

EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY

The armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges

from the back with a satchel and heads inside.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS

can be heard from a second floor balcony.

DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing

the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and

dials. Beat. Into phone --

The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As

he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard

references the sounds from upstairs --

PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside.

Handing over the satchel and heading out --

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

We see the security guard with the satchel use a key-card to

gain elevator access to the lower floors. As the elevator

doors slide closed...

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER

An exclusive showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of

the room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to

a walk-in vault.

The ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges

with the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of

the vault.

A man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading

the cart into the vault.

INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

A train arrives.   People jostle on and off.

One man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser.

Carrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap

over his shoulder.

The train doors begin to close.   When...

A fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and

a man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed.

Intense.

Fait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They

check to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the

platform into the tunnel and disappear.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY

The man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He

closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the

door, securing the vault.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY

Fait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to

the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high-

voltage third rail.

Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him.

Just before he hits. Inches from the rail. Fait pulls him

back up and away from the danger.

Miles nods.

Miles nods again, and they set off.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY

Sounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security

station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and

scans the security monitors.

ANGLE - SECURITY MONITORS

depicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various

empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man

in the suit riding up.

BACK TO SCENE

Douglas settles back in with his magazine.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY

Fait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint.    Fait

starts to open it.

Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an

APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall.   Press

their backs against it as tightly as they can.

The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's

gone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.

INT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY

Fait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts

and rights, following more spray paint.

They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the

sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a

flat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray-

painted circle.

Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.    Fait

pulls out a cell phone.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - (SANTA MONICA) ROOFTOP - DAY

A man, DUNCAN SU, sits in a rental 2002 Thunderbird.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Su's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through

HEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music,

just STATIC.

Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even

more alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the

phone.

CLICK.   HISS.

Su didn't like what he just heard.       Curses in Chinese.   And

takes off.

EXT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Perched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to

the park. The top floor is at street level.

Su easily gains access to the roof of the building. He

moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's

an eight-story drop.

Su faces in.      And then... Hops backward off the roof.

Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs

onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then

lets go.

Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a

sixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto

the balcony.

INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

A large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away. Nearby,

CHRISTOPHE is packing to leave town. When...

Christophe turns.       Sees Su standing behind him.

Wham.   The Chinese boxing version of a bitch-slap.

Wham!   Wham!   Wham!     Wham!   Much more violent than a bitch-

slap.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY

A plasma torch burns through the metal-reinforced slab

overhead. Fait taps Miles, who turns off the torch.

Fait hammers at the last layer. And...

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A hole appears under the private display table, where it

can't be seen by the room's security camera.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY

Fait communicates via a high-tech, transmitting/receiving

earwig.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY

Douglas looks up from his magazine and checks the security

monitors again. Everything a-okay.

ANGLE - FRONT DOOR

A limo pulls up outside.

EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY

A uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the

back and opens the door. A very attractive woman in a

short, tight dress emerges.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY

Escorted by the chauffeur, the woman, DARIA, enters. She

approaches the security station. Up close, in the light,

Daria's even more alluring. And knows how to wield it.

Douglas scans a list of names.      Checks off hers.

Daria turns toward the elevator. Then doesn't go. Just

glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic.

Daria looks back at Douglas.      Studies him a moment.   Liking

what she sees.

She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage.      Then leans over the

desk. Giving Douglas an eyeful.

Douglas is unaffected.   Just looks at her blankly.

Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her.

Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk.

DARIA'S POV

The magazine is Genre.   Males for males.   Buff boys.   Big

pecs, big penises.

BACK TO SCENE

Daria steps back.

Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY.

What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as

Daria walks toward Tommy:

She whispers into a hidden mike --

Tommy hears it over his earwig.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY

Fait and Miles have heard it, too.   Into his mike --

A look of alarm on Tommy's face.    Into his mike --

It's an order.    Tommy knows he has to.   Shit.

Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume --

Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him.

Then heads toward the elevator, as...

Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to

look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans

over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face.

(NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20

Douglas looks up from his magazine.

Beat.   Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine.

Tommy sticks out his hand.

Shaking hands --

He looks away.     Scans the monitors.

ANGLE - MONITORS

Everything looks normal.

ANGLE BACK ON TOMMY AND DOUGLAS

Seeing Douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault,

Tommy relaxes.

OFF which...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Daria gets in. Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas's

attention. He does.

Instead of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the

controls to go down.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at...

TOMMY

who furtively flips her the bird.        Never missing a beat with

Douglas.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY

Fait emerges from the hole beneath the table.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY

On the monitors, we see Fait in the vault anteroom and Daria

descending in the elevator as Tommy keeps Douglas's

attention diverted.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY

Fait holds a small digital camera next to the room's

security camera. Mimicking the security camera's slow pan,

Fait films the room. When he's done....

CLOSEUP - FAIT'S DIGITAL CAMERA

We see the panning shot of the room on the monitor. Fait

pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks on "Repeat." Whereupon

the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous loop.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY

As Fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera,

Daria steps off the elevator, putting her hair up, ready to

work.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY

On the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera

slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy

continues diverting Douglas's attention.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY

Fait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves

equipment bags through the hole in the floor.

Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three

steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a

high-tech DRILL. Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault

door.

Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the

steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door.

Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside.

A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the tripod.

Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had

slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal

canister of liquid nitrogen.

Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound

as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault

door. The outside frosts over.

Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips

on the SAM. Final checks of the rig.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY

Speeding through L.A.   Calling 911 on a cell phone.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY

Fait is the last one down through the hole.   Beat.    He looks

at the others.

Fait pulls out a remote control firing device.   He pushes

the button. And...

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY

The SAM IGNITES with a blinding flash and streaks across the

room. The steel cables instantly snap taut and... RIP the

vault's wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck

out of the door.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY

They felt a rumble.   Tommy covers --

Douglas checks the monitors.      Everything looks okay.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY

The crew re-emerges through the floor to find the vault door

in pieces and a hole the size of a Sub Zero where the SAM

augured into the opposite wall.

Fait's already swinging open the vault.

Miles moves down the rows of   drawers, using a tool to pop

all the locks. Fait and Daria   follow behind, quickly pulling

out the drawers and emptying   jewels into nylon bags. Fait

empties drawer after drawer.    All white diamonds. When...

He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds.     And

stops, admiring them.

He holds up a small, faceted blue diamond.

Into the bag.

Then something else catches his eye. He holds up a small,

pink diamond on a chain. Admires it.

And pockets it.

Fait moves to her. Daria's fishing into a nylon bag she

found in a drawer. Pulls out a handful of... Large black

diamonds. Many more in the bag.

He takes the bag. Stows it in his jacket. When...

Suddenly, Fait's CELL PHONE RINGS. Surprising them.   Beat.

Fait answers.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY

Su's speeding through Los Angeles streets.

Fait just hangs up.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY

Tommy and Douglas hear APPROACHING SIRENS. The SIRENS STOP

outside. SWAT, cops, the works. All heading for the front

door. Tommy whispers urgently into his mike.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY

Fait grabs a bag of jewels.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY

SWAT swarms in.

Tommy exits behind them.

INT./EXT. LIMO - DAY

Tommy gets in.    A SWAT COP signals him.

INT. UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY

Fait, Miles, and Daria run.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY

Slam! Fait, Miles, and Daria blast out the access door.

Fait kneels, feels the track.

Miles nods.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY

Su studies a computer map of downtown as he drives.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY

running like hell. Rounds a curve.      Ahead are the rear

lights of a stopped train.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FAIT AND DARIA - DAY

Approaching the front of another train, stopped at a

station. Fait signals Daria to stay put. Then pokes his

head around the corner of the train.

FAIT'S POV - STATION PLATFORM

SWAT cops hustle passengers off the train. One SWAT GUY

helps another up to check the top of the train. The SECOND

COP jumps back down.

ANGLE BACK

Fait turns back to Daria. Signals her to climb up onto the

top of the train. Then begins climbing after her.

As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT

COP approaching the train's DRIVER, checking under seats,

etc.

Fait has to climb fast. The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting

closer. Looking up. Just as...

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - THEIR POV - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Fait's leg just clears the window.      They don't see it.

But...

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As Fait rolls onto the top of the train...

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The NOISE causes the SWAT Cop to react.      To the Driver --

A moment, as they stop and the Cop looks around.    The Cop

checks the Driver's compartment. Nothing.

The Cop exits.    The Driver enters his compartment.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

ANOTHER SWAT COP stands outside the Driver's window.

During which, just above them...

Fait and Daria lie very still. Daria's tense. Fait winks at

her, trying to relax her. Daria's still tense. He raises his

eyebrows slightly. Shifts his gaze down.

She doesn't get it. Finally follows his gaze. Sees her

position is giving him a full view of her cleavage. She

looks back at him in disbelief.

That does it. She relaxes and smiles back. Under which a

voice crackles over the SWAT Cop's radio.

Whereupon the train jerks to a start.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY

running toward the rear of the stopped train.   Leaping onto

the rear steps. When...

Out of nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him

flying back down onto the rails. And... There is Su in

front of him.

Su moves on Miles. Miles throws a solid punch at him. Su

and Miles fight on the track behind the stopped train. The

deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous.

Miles is a street boxer. He's good. He's ferocious. But

he's no match for Su. When Miles is subdued, Su grabs the

bag of jewels, makes sure Miles doesn't have any more, then

goes.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY

Rocketing underground. The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above

Fait and Daria. Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches

from their heads.

Every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward

the edge. Fait places a calming hand on top of Daria's. The

car takes a wide curve.

Daria's body flips to the side. She loses her grip.

Screams as she starts to fall off the train. Fait reaches

for Daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off

the train.

Fait can't grab her. The train jerks again. He starts

sliding away from her, off the opposite side. Fait thrusts

out both hands as far as he can. And...

Just snags her at the last second. Grips Daria's wrists

with all he's got. They're now draped across the curved roof

of the train. Hands in the middle. If Daria slips, or Fait

lets her go, they both die.

INT. RENTAL T-BIRD (OUTSIDE SUBWAY ENTRANCE) - DAY

Su gets in. Empties Miles' nylon bag into his lap. A

fortune in gems and jewelry pours out. Su sifts through it,

increasingly agitated. What he wants isn't there. He throws

the bag down, cursing in Chinese.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY

Fait is at his limit. His grip starts to loosen. When the

train begins to slow. They pull into a station and stop.

Fait releases Daria, and she drops to the platform.

Fait jumps down on the other side. He's lost the bag of

jewels. Knows they're gone for good. He feels for the bag

of black diamonds. Still has them.

Unseen, Fait joins Daria on the platform, and, hand in hand,

they melt into the crowd of commuters.

EXT. AIRPORT - GENERAL AVIATION TERMINAL - DUSK

A stretch limo and a Cadillac Escalade wait on the tarmac

next to a Gulfstream, which has just arrived.

The jet door opens, and a man emerges with a bodyguard. The

man, LING, is Asian, about forty. Emanates grace and power.

As Ling descends the steps, and two thugs from the SUV go to

retrieve baggage...

A woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet Ling.   She's

also Asian. Dressed in American casual. Beautiful.     SONA.

She's not smiling. As Ling approaches her --

CHARLES, the bodyguard, answers for himself.

Ling kisses Sona on the lips.    Then --

Ling's mood quickly darkens.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY

Swarming with police. When... Su steps off the elevator.

He's carrying the bag of jewels he took from Miles. To a

COP --

Su flashes I.D. We don't see it.   The Cop scopes it a

moment. He's clearly impressed.

As he leads Su toward his superiors in the vault...

INT. VANESSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

VANESSA, eight, is in her pajamas, playing SIM Coaster on

her computer. The door opens. Fait enters. His daughter.

Vanessa sighs. Fait stands over her as she shuts down the

computer, talking her through the commands, making sure she

doesn't dawdle.

Whereupon he whisks her out of her chair, flies her once

around the room and tucks her into bed.

She takes his right hand, opens it and turns it over.

Nothing. Takes his left hand, opens it and turns it over.

More nothing. She's stumped.

Fait smiles. Puts his hands together. When he opens them,

there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain.

Fait slips the chain over her head and kisses her.

Then Fait looks up.     Addresses the air above her.

A bedtime ritual. Fait goes. When she's alone, Vanessa

holds up the diamond, which catches every bit of available

light and shines in the dark.

Then she rolls over and closes her eyes.

INT. FAIT'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Fait enters.     Vanessa's nanny, TONITA, is there.    To Tonita

--

Still to the nanny --

Fait exits.

INT. FAIT'S BAR/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Fait enters.    Tommy and Daria are there.

Fait puts a finger to his lips.    Leads them across the room

to another door.

INT. FAIT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

They enter.    Fait shuts the door.

Fait's thinking it through.

Just then, Miles enters.

He takes the broken communication device out of his ear and

tosses it on the table.

Fait pulls out the bag of black diamonds.

Miles moves to go with him.

Daria moves to him.   Their eyes meet.

Fait gives her a kiss.   Then goes.

INT. CHRISTOPHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Christophe's arms are   wrapped around the large fish tank,

one arm over the top,   the other through the legs of the

stand. His hands are    bound. He can't move. His beaten

face is pressed to the   glass. Large, weird fish swim past

in front of him.

The weird fish scatter as a face appears on the other side

of the tank. Ling. Looking through at Christophe.

Ling straightens and walks around the tank. Sona is with

him. So is Charles, the bodyguard. In b.g., the two thugs

stand sentry near the front door. Christophe's eyes follow

them.

Ling interrupts him with a hand on the shoulder.

EXT. ARCHIE'S AMERICAN SURPLUS - M1A1 TANK - NIGHT

Sitting in the middle of the large lot, which is full of hot

goods and military surplus equipment. The tank's turret is

spinning around. The cannon elevating and depressing

seemingly at random. When...

The cannon stops. Having locked on...Fait, standing in

front of the tank. From inside the tank, a muffled voice.

A hatch opens. ARCHIE, a fairly straight-ahead-looking man,

pops his head up out of the tank.

As Archie climbs out of the tank and joins Fait --

Fait and Archie walk to a work table. Nearby, two MEN

UNLOAD HOT TVS from a truck. One Man calls to Archie.

Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait.

Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black

diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup.

Studies them a moment. Shrugs.

Fait's heading out.

INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Fait opens a door with an electronic lock pick.

INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Fait enters. Stops a moment, his back against the closed

door, while his eyes adjust to the dark. Then moves quietly

out into the room. Looking for Christophe.

Fait continues moving around through the room. When he

steps in something wet. He bends down and checks it out.

Water. The carpet's soaked.

His eyes go to something. Fait finds a cord and turns on a

switch. The light in the fish tank snaps on.

REVEAL Christophe.     Stuffed inside the tank.     Sleeping with

the fishes.

Behind him.   Fait turns around.      Sees Su.   Sitting on a

sofa.

Fait does the math.

Su stands.

Fait launches   himself at Su. Gonna fight     his way    out the

door. A much    better fighter than Miles.     And...    He's saved

by the bell:    the PHONE RINGS. The fight     stops.     The

phone's near   Fait. Beat. The answering      machine    picks up.

BEEP.

Beat.   Fait pushes the button for the speakerphone.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Overlooking L.A. Ling and Sona. Enjoying hotel room

service. Ling's on a cell phone.

Fait just hangs up.

A long beat. The two men facing off. Then...

As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out...

EXT. STREET NEAR CHRISTOPHE'S - NIGHT

Fait slides into his Porsche and drives off.

INT./EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT

Fait's checking his rearview mirror. Sees a black Cadillac

Escalade pull away from the curb and follow.

Fait doesn't need it.

He's about    to punch it. When... A cop car turns a corner

and falls    in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps

driving.     Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now...

Fait hits    it. Until...

Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi-

industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow,

but is cut off by the on-coming cars.

We STAY WITH Fait. He GUNS down the alley. Reaches an

intersecting alley. Turns. GUNS it out of sight.

INT./EXT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and

speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the

intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled

into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a

wall.

EXT. ALLEY (SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Two men start to get out of the Escalade. We recognize

them: Ling's two thugs. We barely have time to realize

that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction

equipment down the alley. He's had no choice but to turn

and fight.

Which is what he does, rushing the passenger.

The battle's ferocious and fast. Ultimately, Fait's out-

muscled and out-gunned. He's forced back against the open

door of the Escalade, guns to his head.

He cocks his pistol.   Beat.

Whereupon a...

BOTTLE

Spins through the air. The bottle knocks the gun from one

Killer's hand. The gun skids under a nearby chain-link

fence.

REVEAL

the person who threw the bar.   Su. The fight's on.   Two on

two. Using all means available. During the battle, a killer

tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence. Almost

gets it. When...

Two vicious DOBERMANS, guard dogs for the junkyard behind

the fence, leap out of nowhere, SNARLING and SNAPPING and

smash into the fence. The killer jumps back, barely

escaping with his arm.

The fight continues.   Fait and Su wear them down.

Behind the fence, the Dobies want flesh. Every time someone

crashes into the fence, they're right there trying to get a

piece.

Also, every time someone crashes into the old fence, we see

a series of chain-link connections loosen and break. Until

it happens one too many times. The entire fence goes down.

The dogs are out. The nearest targets: Su and Fait.Su and

Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and

evading the ferocious attack dogs.

Finally, Su kicks one dog flying. Whip-kicks the other off

Fait. The two men run for the Escalade. The dogs are up in a

flash. Su spots an abandoned car. A rear door is open.

Fait follows, right on his heels.

The dogs close in.

Su reaches the car. Dives through the open door.

Somersaults over the rear seat. Kicks open the far door and

rolls out. Fait dives in right behind him. The Dobies leap

in after Fait.

Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the

other side of the car. Clears the door. And... Su slams

the door shut.

We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed

door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that

door, too. Trapping the SNARLING, foaming DOGS inside.

The bad guys are gone. And Fait's CELL PHONE is RINGING. As

Fait digs out the phone, to Su --

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. ARCHIE'S AMERICAN SURPLUS - OFFICE - NIGHT

Archie's had the shit beat out of him.

CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR

Surveillance camera footage of Archie's.

Five armed African-Americans, faces hidden under baseball

caps, enter Archie's place, put Archie up against a wall and

start to beat something out of him.

INT. ARCHIE'S AMERICAN SURPLUS - OFFICE - NIGHT

Archie, Fait and Su are watching the monitor. On screen,

Archie surrenders immediately.

Who are they?

Uh... Don't know.

What'd they say?

Well... 'Give us the stones,

motherfucker.' You know. That kinda

thing.

That's it?

Pretty much.    Yeah.

Thanks for keeping yourself alive to

pass on all that valuable

information.

Did you call the police?

Look around. Are you crazy? Then

again, maybe you are crazy, 'cause I

have no idea who you are.

Big question is, who's behind the

boost?

I don't know that, but I know they

got great guns. I can't even get

those. U.S. Special Forces only.

... Chambers.

What?

He's wired into everything going down

in this city, and he can get that

kind of firepower. Gotta be him.

Who's Chambers?

Beat.   Su takes out his wallet and shows him.

INSERT - I.D.

In Chinese.     Clearly official.

Archie takes it, reads.

UNDER which, Fait's CELL PHONE starts RINGING.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. LIMOUSINE - TIGHT ON LING AND SONA - NIGHT

Ling's on his cell phone.

Fait freezes.

REVEAL Vanessa, in the limo, held by Charles.     On Ling's

signal, Charles uncovers her mouth.

Beat.   Fait hands the phone to Su.

Su takes the phone.   In CHINESE with ENGLISH SUBTITLES --

We see this resonates with Su.

And then, he simply hangs up.

END INTERCUT.

Beat.   Fait realizes what this means.

INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - NIGHT

Large, empty, brightly-lit.    The door opens, and the limo

pulls in.

INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The limo stops inside the hangar.    To Charles, re:   Vanessa

--

Then, as Charles forces Vanessa out --

Sona just reaches out and slaps her. It hurts and surprises

Vanessa. Tears come to her eyes. But she's Fait's

daughter: she won't let this bitch make her cry. Charles

takes Vanessa out. Ling's mind is still on the phone call.

INT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT

In motion.     Fait and Su.   Fait on the cell to Tommy.

Su looks over.     Beat.

A long beat.     L.A. moving by outside.

Beat.

Another beat.   Then --

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

A battered Ford camper now sits in the middle of the hangar.

We see Vanessa inside the camper. She's screaming. Loudly.

Not scared. Pissed. As...

Ling Thug #2 covers the windows with black spray paint.

ANGLE - ACROSS HANGAR

Ling Thug #2 hands car keys to Charles.

Vanessa's still screaming.   It's getting on Charles' nerves.

He marches toward the van.   Unlocks the rear door and slides

it open.

INT./EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vanessa is standing inside, still yelling.

Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV.   Turns

it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as...

Charles slams the door shut.   Locks it.   And...

Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her

anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on

the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark

camper.

Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it.

A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the

fear go away, but giving her strength.

CLOSEUP - FAIT

As he drives, just as if he can sense Vanessa's need for him

--

OFF which, as Su regards him...

INT. MEDIUM SECURITY PRISON - CELLBLOCK - DAY

A prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as

dreary, spare and institutional as the next. That is, until

they reach the last cell.

The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries.    Hanging

blankets cloak the cell entirely from view.

Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside the cell. One

sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets

covering the open cell doorway, REVEALING...

INT./EXT. CHAMBER'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The

last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as

Joel's office.

JUMP CHAMBERS, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime

lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the

terms of his incarceration.

Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS,

sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs

benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries;

French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ, Maxim, Hustler

and the daily mail.

The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns to go.

The guard, METZ, stops and looks back.

Metz goes.

Beat.   Chambers eyes Fait and Su through his cigar smoke.

Then, when Fait and Su have removed their shoes --

The sentries move aside. Fait and Su enter. Chambers ash-

trays his Cuban and digs into b-fast.

Chambers turns to Su.   In SUBTITLED KOREAN --

Su doesn't say anything.   Back to English --

Chambers carves up a sausage.

A QUICK SHOT OF Fait, taking this in.

No response.   Chambers just keeps eating.

Still no response... Chambers finishes eating.    Wipes his

face. Finally --

Beat.   He meets Fait's eyes.   Holds them.

Another beat.   That's it.   No deal.

Fait takes a sudden step toward Chambers.     Su stops him.

He indicates behind them. They turn. The two cell sentries

are wielding prison shanks. So is Willy Chickens.

Chickens is happy.   Thrusts the knife at Fait.       When...

Su reaches out and catches the   blade.  Catches it with just

the thumb and forefinger of one   hand.  And holds it like

that. Holds it hard. Chickens     can't push and can't pull.

Doesn't know what to do next.    Finally yanks really hard.

And...

Su lets go. Chickens goes backward, ass over teakettle. A

beat. Then, to Fait --

EXT. PRISON - DAY

Fait and Su walk toward the Porsche.

They're about to get in the car. Fait stops.     Looks back at

the prison. Suddenly realizing something.

INT. HANGAR - DAY

RUSSELL, the science and technology end of Ling's operation,

carries a piece of equipment from the back of a five-ton

truck and approaches some kind of strange contraption, which

he's in the process of erecting in the middle of the hangar.

He puts down what he's carrying next to the contraption and

starts back for something else, when he sees Charles is

looking in the back of the truck.

Russell hurries over, extremely edgy, almost manic.

Sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby.

Charles does. And now we can hear Vanessa, who's begun

screaming inside the camper.

Charles backs up, continuing to address Russell --

Charles joins Sona.   Re:   Russell --

Sona tosses Charles a roll of duct tape.

As Vanessa continues to SCREAM, Charles moves to the van,

unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it.

Then opens the door. And...

Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his

waist.

He pries loose her arms from around him. Keeping a grip on

her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face

away from him. He's about to start duct-taping her wrists.

Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads.   Charles howls in

pain and lets her go.

Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vanessa slams the sliding rear door shut. And now... We

suddenly realize she has the key and remote! The crying

just an act she put on to pickpocket Charles. Vanessa pushes

the remote. And...

EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

THUNK go the DOOR LOCKS. Charles, still in pain, is

surprised to hear this. Feels his pocket. Realizes the key

and remote are gone.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vanessa climbs into the driver's seat. Puts the key into

the ignition and STARTS the ENGINE. Puts it in "D."

CLOSEUP - ACCELERATOR PEDAL

To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal. An

extension for her short legs. As her foot tromps down on the

can...

ANGLE - CAMPER

takes off. The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't

see where she's going. But she's going.

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The camper careens around the large space.   Charles

scrambles after.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vanessa keeps driving blind, pedal to the metal.

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The CAMPER veers toward the rear wall.   And...

... CRASHES into a support post.

As Charles yanks Vanessa from the wrecked van, unhurt...

INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY

A hostess bar, but very high-end. Beautiful women. Elegant

decor. Pumping MUSIC. No strip-club cheese. For extra

money, private rooms for private pleasures. It's day, but

the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men.

Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility:   at the

door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc.

ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through

the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door.

Then, checking her out --

Daria starts to go.   Odion stops her.

Daria considers it a moment.

Beat.   Daria knows the look in his eyes.   Gets the subtext.

Odion's drinking her in.

A beat. Then, as Daria reaches out and slips her hand into

Odion's, smiling at him --

INT. SU'S T-BIRD - DAY

Su and Archie.

They turn into...

EXT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A cavernous industrial building.   Cars parked on the

perimeter.

INT./EXT. SU'S T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As they park --

OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to

help disguise himself...

INT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Archie and Su exit the car and approach a GUARD manning a

gate to the fight arena beyond.

Then, to the Guard --

Su shoots him a surprised look.

He hands a card reading "12" to Su. As Archie and Su make

their way toward the arena --

They reach the arena. It's also huge. Packed with men.

Hazy with smoke. Loud with betting, cheers and boos.

A large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room.

Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the

shit out of each other.

Like at    a Gallagher concert, front row fans have sheets of

plastic    over their laps. Whenever a hard kick or punch

lands,    the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to

shield    themselves from flying blood.

He looks around.      Lotta African-American males.

As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands,

and Su follows...

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

Daria and Odion enter, and Odion closes the door. He starts

to take her in his arms. Daria slows him up. Guides him

back toward a sofa.

Odion sits.

Odion puts a DISC in the STEREO.        Cranks up some HIP-HOP.

Odion SWITCHES MUSIC.        A SLOW TUNE fills the room.

Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the

music. Then starts dancing for him. Slow and sexy.

And Odion's eating it up.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

Fait and Miles climb onto the roof with gear bags.   Via

earwig mike --

INT./EXT. PEST CONTROL TRUCK - DAY

Tommy's behind the wheel, wearing a pest control uniform.

EXT. KOREAN CLUB - STREET IN FRONT - DAY

The DOORMAN watches Tommy drive up in the pest-control

truck, put on a respirator, get out, unreel 20 feet of pest

spray hose from the truck and advance toward the door.

Tommy starts to go.

Tommy stops.

The Doorman considers it another moment.   Then --

The Doorman considers a moment.     Then --

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

Daria keeps dancing. Peeling off layers now.    Showing skin.

Odion's starting to salivate.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY

What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a

normal office. No expense spared. (Think Joel again.) A

large, "Zen" FOUNTAIN BURBLES meditatively in the center of

the room.

The door opens.   The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around

in amazement.

He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT.     He sets off

one. PFFFT. The other. As he goes --

OFF the closing door...

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

Fait and Miles grab gear bags and mobilize. Clip onto

ascender/descenders and lower themselves to a second-story

window. A window into...

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Where the BUG BOMBS HISS away.

Fait tries the WINDOW. Locked shut. He quickly tapes it.

BREAKS it. He and Miles climbs inside. Grab the bug bombs

and toss them out.

As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls out

a folding metal detector. Uses it to scan the entire room

quickly: floor, walls, ceiling... Gets LOW-VOLUME RING-OFFS

from various hidden metal. But he's looking for something

bigger.

BLEEE.   He gets it when he sweeps past Chambers' big desk.

He kneels.     Removes a desk panel.   And...

There it is.     The safe is small but highly secure.

Miles finishes assembling a Barrett .50 caliber rifle. A

big gun. Opens an ammo box labeled "Depleted Uranium. .50

cal."

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

Daria's down to bare essentials -- still dancing slow and

sexy for Odion.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY

Miles loads one of the massive D.U. cartridges into the

Barrett.

Miles aims the BARRETT directly at the safe lock.      Miles

FIRES. BIG BANG.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

Odion starts.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY

Basically, the lock's just gone. Melted. Burned through by

the DU slug. Fait swings the safe door open.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

Odion's heading out the door. When he stops.       Looks back at

Daria. A realization dawning.

He steps toward Daria.    Backhands her.   Hard.   Then opens

the door.

A CHAMBERS MAN outside the door addresses Odion.

Odion goes. The Man enters. Shuts the door, leering at

Daria, who starts putting on what she's taken off.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY

Fait's tossed the safe.     No stones.

Fait's started searching the room.       Tearing it apart.

Someone starts RATTLING the LOCKED DOOR.      Fait doesn't stop.

Miles hesitates. Fait's unreachable. Chambers' men are

trying to break down the door. Miles goes. Out the window.

Onto the ascender-descender. And gone.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

Daria finishes dressing.     When...

Her response is a front kick to the head. Followed by a

spin kick, knocking him out. Then, stepping past him --

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY

CRASH!   Odion and his men break down the door.

Fait's still searching. Desperate to find the stones.

Desperate to save his daughter. He fights off the first

men to reach him. A wild animal. Fights off another. And

then...

The guns are out.     All pointed at Fait. No stones. No exit.

INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY

Daria walks out the front door.

INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY

Willy Chickens hovers near Chambers, who is talking as he

eats another meal. Lobster. At first, we don't realize who

Chambers is addressing.

Whereupon we see who he's talking to:     Ling.

Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time.       Still isn't

looking. Forks up some lobster meat. When...

Chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him. And...

Ling slams a lobster claw deep into Chickens' neck. Chambers

doesn't wait for whatever's next. Jumps back. Fast for a

big man.

But Ling is much faster. Stronger. Deadlier. Quickly, and

quietly beats Chambers like a drum. Chambers knows when it's

finally tent-folding time. Croaks surrender through the

blood and swelling --

Ling stops.

INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE CHAMBERS' CELL - MOMENTS LATER

Ling emerges from the cell through the blankets. Closing

the blankets behind him. To the sentries, who've heard

nothing --

OFF which, as Ling walks away...

INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY

FIND Chambers. No one will bother him. Ever.       The lobster

fork driven deep into the base of his skull.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY

Archie still looking for the man with the diamond

pinkie-ring. Su still following.

In the cage, a fight has just ended. The loser's

unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning

airplane propeller. The winner doesn't look much better.

The midget RING ANNOUNCER steps in with a mike.

As Archie and Su continue the search --

No response from Su.   Beat.

In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the

midget calls out --

Suddenly, seeing the "12" card in Su's hand, a FIGHT CLUB

FAN grabs his arm and raises it. Yells out --

Su pulls his arm back.

Su glances into the ring, seeing the BRUISER for the

first time. The Bruiser's beckoning.

Su waves them off.

The catcalls start.    Archie leans into Su.

A long beat.    Su hates this place.   Su hates Archie.

INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY

Fait's in handcuffs. A big cut on his head. Being escorted

by two COPS to the stairs leading out of the club. To

Odion, as they pass him --

As they continue up the stairs --

EXT. HOT DOG STAND (NEAR KOREAN CLUB) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Near, but not too close. The club visible in b.g. Daria,

Miles, and Tommy watch as Fait is led into an ambulance.

Via earwigs --

INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Fait's heard.

The PARAMEDIC treating him doesn't understand.

CLOSEUP - BEHIND FAIT'S BACK

His cuffed hands.    Fingers feeling the inside of his belt.

Finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the

leather. Popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed-out

recess in the belt. Where...

Fait has a hidden handcuff key.

CLOSEUP - ANOTHER SET OF HANDS

struggling against their duct-tape bonds.   REVEAL...

INT. CAMPER - DAY

Vanessa's hands are taped together behind her back. There's

tape around her feet. Tape over her mouth. The TV is ON

nearby, but she's not watching.

Vanessa struggles a moment longer, but can't break the tape.

Finally gives up trying. Just lies there. Tired and

scared.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY

DING! The crowd's yelling and betting as number eight

leaves his corner and advances on Su.

Su has nothing against number eight. He's just trying to

buy time. So he dodges his opponent. Not exactly

running. Fighting by not fighting. A target one moment,

gone the next. Again and again, number eight swings and

misses. Until...

Number eight delivers a knockout blow. Unfortunately

it's against himself. The momentum of a missed punch

carries him headfirst into a metal post.

Number eight drops. As the referee counts over number eight,

Su uses the chance to find...

ARCHIE

still checking out the hands of African-American men in

the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it.

SU

Number eight's on his feet.    Moving in again.   When...

ARCHIE

Suddenly, he sees it.    The ring.

SU

dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling

he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A

solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight.

Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows.

Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its

disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's

path.

Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting

fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the

cage. Where... It's now Su against them all.

HOT DOG STAND - DAY

Daria, Tommy and Miles wait. Two     extreme MOTO-RIDERS

dressed in leathers have pulled up    in a truck and gotten out

to eat. In the back of the truck     is a motorcycle and a

four-wheel ATV. The two men Ogle     Daria. To her --

She ignores them.     To each other, so she can hear --

INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Fait's heard. Looks past the Paramedic. Past the Cops

talking outside. Sees the hot dog stand in b.g. Sees the

truck with the motorcycle and ATV parked near the stand. The

Paramedic finishes bandaging Fait. To the cops outside --

A Cop calls inside to Fait.

Fait stands.     Starts out.   Into his mike --

And we see...

The handcuffs aren't on him anymore.

EXT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Fait reaches the rear doorway.      When...

He jumps. Knocks one Cop down.      Shoves another aside.   And

takes off running.

Fait's caught the cops completely by surprise. It takes a

few moments before the cops give chase, some on foot, others

by car.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand.

To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on --

As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into

the bed of the truck. Jumps on the ATV. IGNITION.

The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening.

Too late. Fait blasts out of the rear of the truck.   Right

through the nylon mesh tailgate.

Fait flies from the truck bed. Lands on the hood of a

police car. Gets big air off the windshield. Clears the

rest of the car and grabs pavement with all four wheels.

As Fait tears off, and cop cars follow, one of the Moto-

Riders jumps into the bed of the truck and climbs aboard the

remaining motorcycle. His friend calls to him --

The Moto-Rider FIRES UP the MOTORCYCLE. Drops it into

first. Dittoes Fait's leap out the back and SCREAMS off in

pursuit.

INT. CAMPER - DAY

Vanessa still taped up.    TV still ON.   When...

ANGLE TO INCLUDE TV

Airing a chopper shot tracking Fait on the ATV.

Vanessa looks over in surprise.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

WHOOOM! Fait's flying. Seventy-plus. Down streets,

sidewalks, squeezing through places police cars can't.

Over, under, around, through -- doesn't matter. The ATV's

fast, strong and maneuverable.

One problem: so is the moto-cross bike.     The guy's right on

Fait's ass. Matching move with move.

Overhead, police choppers follow Fait's every move. While

on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path.

But whenever Fait meets a roadblock, he somehow finds an

escape. At one point, he uses an outdoor escalator. At

another point he blasts through the Hotel Bonaventure.

This'll be a news highlight for days to come.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY

The place is bedlam. In the crowd, bets are going down on

the battle royal, now in full effect inside the cage. Su

versus the five fighters. And the midget.

The different fighters use different fighting styles against

Su. Kickboxing, grappling, aikido, kali, American street

fighting...

Su uses all his own skills and whatever's at hand. At one

point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another

opponent. At another point, Su wields the midget like a

fighting staff.

One by one, Su starts reducing the opposition.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Fait's everywhere.   And so is the moto-bike.   Still on his

tail.

Fait veers inside a building.   The bike follows.

INT. BUILDING - VARIOUS SHOTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs.   One floor.   Two

floors. Up and up.

Fait reaches the top-floor hallway.   Nowhere left to go

except...

Out the window at the end.   And...

That's just where he goes.

And where he goes, the moto-bike goes.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS

The ATV and the moto-bike make the first leap.    Onto the

roof of a next-door building.

From there, it's rooftop to rooftop.    Jump after jump.

Longer and longer. Until...

The MOTO-BIKE eats it in a spectacular CRASH.     The moto-

rider walks away, but his chase is over.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Fait's ATV SCREAMS down another street, still chased by

cops. Into his mike --

INT. DARIA, MILES AND TOMMY'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY

It's down to Su and the kick boxer.    The kick boxer spins

and kicks and punches, and...

Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes.    Ties him into a

pretzel. Cinches him tight. Then...

Looks for Archie.     Can't find him. Can't find the guy

wearing the ring.     And hurries out of the cage.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

Fait jukes the ATV in the entrance.    Up the spiral ramp.

Moments later, police CARS SKID up and seal the entrance.

INT. CAMPER - DAY

On TV, a chopper shot of the garage surrounded by police.

OFF Vanessa, watching...

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY

Su runs into the parking area. Archie's in the T-bird.

Sitting, a little unnaturally in the front.

Su looks inside the car.

ANGLE - CAR

Where Archie sits atop the man with the diamond pinkie ring.

Holding a STUN GUN to the guy's cheek.

He ZAPS the air.    Then puts it back to the guy's cheek.

INT. CAMPER - DAY

On TV, the chopper zooms in on a familiar car, as it rolls

down the exit ramp toward the police barricade.

We see the police approach the car.

The police let the car pass.

Vanessa notices something about the car.     Looks carefully.

When...

The car turns, giving the news chopper a better zoom angle

of the people inside, and...

Vanessa sees Daria, Miles and Tommy.

Which could mean only one thing:    her daddy's safe.   And

soon he'll be coming to get her.

With a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape,

Vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct-

tape bonds. When, just as it's about to seem hopeless

again, her eyes go to...

Her necklace.   The chain and pink diamond pendant.

Vanessa bends over    and lowers her head until the necklace

slides off onto the    bed. Then turns around and  picks up the

necklace behind her    back. Holding it as taut as  she can

between her hands,    she begins sawing away at the tape around

her wrists.

EXT. NEAR KOREAN CLUB - HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT

The gang's all here.    All eyes on the club.

A long beat.    Fait doesn't answer.

OFF which, as he and Su go --

INT. KOREAN CLUB - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

MUSIC pumps downstairs as Su and Fait cautiously move down

the hall toward Chambers' office.

They reach the closed office door, where they stop and

listen. Hear nothing.

Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look.     Then Su opens

the door.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Su and Fait enter, unchallenged, to find...

Odion and the other Chambers' men.    Dead.   Skull shot.

Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain,

where he reaches into the water and begins searching the

rocks lining the bottom. Beat. Then --

Su doesn't answer, still searching.

Another beat. Then, at last, Su holds something up:         one

black stone. It takes Fait a moment to understand.

Fait can't believe it.

Beat.   Failure.       Summed up in one word:

Su just looks at him.        Not a chance.   And he knows Fait

knows it, too.

It's over.     For Fait, it's as if his life just ended.

Fait doesn't move. Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage,

and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the

fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of

exotica, destroying it.

Beat.   Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes.          Then --

OFF which, as Su mobilizes him, and they go...

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

Ling pours the black stones out on a table.   To Sona and

Charles --

Russell, who's been working on his scientific contraption

nearby, speaks up.

When the goggles are on, Russell hits a switch.   And...

Inside the contraption, brilliant green laser BEAMS begin

bombarding a sensor. OFF which...

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT

Vanessa succeeds in using the necklace   as a saw to free her

wrists from the duct-tape. She quickly    rips the tape from her

mouth. Untapes her ankles. Then tries     to figure out what to do

next. Begins searching the camper for    anything that might help

her escape or fight. When...

Looking through the glove box, she finds a cell phone. An

old model. So old, it takes her a moment to figure out

exactly what it is. Then she pushes "Power," and...

The phone turns on.    Sort of.

CLOSEUP - CELL PHONE

"Low Batt" flashes on the screen.

INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rock bottom.

Fait's desolate, sitting on the sofa, staring off.      Daria

tries to comfort him, but it doesn't help.

Miles and Tommy stay close and stay silent.

Even Archie's quiet for once.

The only noise is Su, speaking into a cell phone in Chinese

to someone who is obviously his superior.

Under which, the PHONE begins to RING.    And...

Fait's too upset to care about answering.

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT

Vanessa's on the old cell phone.    We hear RINGING on the

other end.

CLOSEUP - PHONE

"Low Batt"... "Low Batt"...

INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The PHONE'S still RINGING.    After another moment...

Which finally mobilizes Fait to reach over and answer.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT

Vanessa whispers urgently.

Which gets everyone's attention.

Under which, in b.g., Su quickly ends the phone call to his

superior. Still in Chinese --

Vanessa puts her eye to the window.    Finally finds a small

gap in the paint.

VANESSA'S POV

Few details. Just some chairs and bright green light from

Russell's contraption.

CLOSEUP - VANESSA'S PHONE

"Low Batt"... "Low Batt"...

BACK TO SCENE

Fait repeats for the others' benefit.

CLOSEUP - VANESSA'S PHONE

Fait's voice drops out as the battery dies.

BACK TO SCENE

END INTERCUT.

Fait slams the phone down in frustration.

But Su's mind is on what she told them.

Archie answers it.

All eyes go to him.

Su considers it a moment.

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

Ling, Sona, Charles, and Russell.

Russell finishes testing his contraption.    Switches it OFF.

Then, removing his goggles --

The others remove their goggles.    Sona checks her watch.

Beat.   Ling holds up a black stone and examines it.

A look at the others.   Serious.   Then a broad smile of

consummate satisfaction suddenly spreads across his face.

Beat.   He puts down the stone.    A glance at the camper.

CLOSEUP - TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF LOS ANGELES AREA

Fait's finger indicates a spot.

PULL BACK TO...

INT. FAIT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Fait, Su, Daria and Miles.

He and Su exchange a look.     Then --

CORPORATE HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Noselight beaming, the chopper lands next to four other

high-end biz copters, including an Agusta A109, outside the

hangar, where the bruised Ling killers stand guard.

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT

Vanessa peeks through a void in the paint covering the

windows.

VANESSA'S POV - HANGAR

An internationally-diverse group of men -- some occupying

the chairs, some studying the contraption, some clearly

muscle. Across the room, Sona and Ling greet the new

arrivals.

In all, sixteen men have arrived for the sale. There are

five buyers -- one RUSSIAN, one AFRICAN, one PAKISTANI, one

EGYPTIAN, one FRENCH. The French Buyer is in a wheelchair.

Each buyer has brought with him one right-hand man and one

to three bodyguards.

Vanessa SHIFTS her VIEW, REVEALING...

Charles standing nearby.    Too close for her to escape.

Charles turns, and...

BACK TO VANESSA

Quickly, before Charles can see her, she steps away from the

window.

There's no way out.

EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT

Driving.   Daria and Miles following in their car.

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

Ling holds up a single stone.

Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a

table. Folds the velvet over. Then, whack, hits it hard

with a mallet.

He unfolds the velvet.   The stone's smashed to pieces.

Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who

places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then

inserts the capsule into his contraption.

Everyone puts on goggles. Then Russell hits the switch, and

the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver

of stone, which begins to glow.

Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical

readout on the contraption races up the scale --

And it just keeps going.   Until, finally --

As the buyers absorb this...

Russell shuts off the beams.

Russell removes the capsule and hands it back to Ling, who

holds it up.

A beat as this sinks in.

The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand

signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. At the

same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators.

Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a

laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market-

analysis for Sona to consult.

The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel

out the situation.

Sona is silent.   Silence means "No."

Silence.

Silence.

Silence.

EXT. WICK AIRFIELD - FAIT AND DARIA - NIGHT

Near their cars.

(NOTE: From now until the battle's over, it's night. At

the airport, Fait, Su and Fait's team will all communicate

via earwigs.)

EXT. AIRFIELD - ROOF

Atop the building next to Ling's hangar. The five choppers

rest on the wide tarmac below, between the two buildings.

Miles scans Ling's hangar through the scope of a silenced

sniper rifle.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NO NIGHT VISION

FINDING the Ling killers outside the hangar.

Then, scanning inside Ling's hangar THROUGH windows --

EXT. AIRFIELD - FAIT AND DARIA

EXT. HANGAR

Su's reached the top of outside stairs.    Opens a door and

enters.

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

High above the floor, Su steps onto a catwalk.    The sale

continuing below. More heated now.

Silence.

Silence.

And now, in more and more rapid-fire succession --

EXT. AIRFIELD - FAIT AND DARIA

MILES

is already sighted in.   PULLS the TRIGGER.   PHUT!

SENTRIES

One Ling killer takes a leg hit and goes down.

Before the second killer has time to react, he catches a

BULLET in the shoulder.

MILES

FAIT AND DARIA

INT. HANGAR

The sale's now a frenzy.

When suddenly...

KA-WHAM! Archie's Abrams TANK BLASTS through a wall and

into the hangar.

Archie's head pops out of the driver's hole. At the same

time, Tommy pops up out of the turret and trains a mounted

machine gun on the stunned group.

Russell watches the advancing tank.

ANGLE - BEHIND TANK

Fait and Daria enter through the hole in the wall using the

Abrams for shelter.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vanessa peers out through a gap in the paint to see what's

happening.

VANESSA'S POV

Charles is drawn away by the advancing tank.

BACK TO VANESSA

She looks back into the camper. Finds a heavy iron skillet

amid the stove utensils. Swings it. And...

SMASH!    She SHATTERS a side WINDOW.

MILES' SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)

We FIND Vanessa, jumping out of the camper.

INT. HANGAR - FAIT AND DARIA

To Daria --

And he's gone, sprinting after her just as...

VANESSA

reaches a button for opening and closing the giant hangar

doors. She jabs a button, and the nearest door begins to

motor open.

CHARLES

hears the OPENING HANGAR DOOR.    Turns.   Sees Vanessa and

goes after her.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)

Vanessa rolls out under the rising door and runs.

Then, FINDING Charles coming after her --

PHUT!

INT. HANGAR - CHARLES

A BULLET rips through the collar of his leather coat. Just

behind his neck. Just missing him. But he keeps coming.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)

Charles rolling out under the door.

MILES

SHOOTS again.   PHUT!

CHARLES

The BULLET RICOCHETS off the PAVEMENT right next to him. In

a flash, he's up and running. Heading out into the darkness

of the airfield after Vanessa. Meanwhile, back inside...

INT. HANGAR

In here, the hangar door continues to open as the tank makes

its slow approach. Archie's not a great driver. Tommy

sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group.

At which point, Russell breaks for his five-ton truck.

Russell just keeps going. Slides open the side door in the

back of the five-ton, revealing... A twin-fifty machine gun.

Two barrels, .50 caliber. Dangerous even for a tank.

Russell vaults in and takes aim.

He starts FIRING. People start running. .50 CAL. ROUNDS take

big CHUNKS out of whatever they hit.

The question's answered for him.   He somehow does the right

thing. And...

Tommy's MACHINE GUN begins RIPPING CHUNKS out of the FIVE-

TON and EVERYTHING near it. Tommy's a horrible shot; the

gun's more in control of him. But...

Russell finally dies under a HAIL of HEAVY LEAD.

INTERCUT WITH which...

ACROSS HANGAR

Ling and Sona are moving toward the limo. Ling has the

stones. When... Su is there. Blocking the way. Sona

attacks. Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back.

Never taking his eyes off Ling. When...

Sona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly

takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns

the gun on Su.

Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd

just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su... Su sees

Ling getting into the limo.    To Archie and   Tommy, as he

signals --

As a result of which...

TOMMY AND ARCHIE

Having just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo. Tommy's .50

is out of ammo. He switches to the .30 cal. tank's machine

gun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins BLASTING

away.

LIMO

Ling's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH

HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as

the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO.

INTERCUT WITH which...

SU AND SONA

Play cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out of room to hide.

He can't get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the

inevitable. When...

WHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from

Sona's hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed

limo

Su goes after Ling.

And now it's Daria vs. Sona.

Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her

side. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the

Scorpion. She swings it up. And...

Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes

Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the

SCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips

through her chest and kills her.

And now, here's what's been going on outside...

EXT. AIRFIELD

As Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the

tarmac into the darkness of the airfield...

MILES

flips to NIGHT VISION on the sniper-scope.    And...

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION

Charles and Vanessa become clearly visible. Charles is

closing in on her. Cross-hairs FIND him. PHUT!

CHARLES

The BULLET knocks his gun from his hands.    Charles is slowed

but keeps going.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION

Charles reaches the flight line. Parked planes, a gas

truck, a shed, etc. He disappears behind the equipment.

MILES

sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and Vanessa.     He comms

Fait.

CHARLES

stops behind the gas truck.   Looks around for Vanessa.    No

sign of her. Until...

Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all

the way. He whips it open. And...

There's Vanessa, hiding inside.

Charles grabs her.   Yanks her out struggling and kicking.

And then...

Charles looks over.    Fait is there, holding a gun on him.

Vanessa's relieved and excited to see her father.

Charles lowers Vanessa to the ground.    He releases her.

Vanessa runs to her father. Dives into his arms. It's a

little more energetic than Fait was expecting. And...

Suddenly, Charles uses the distraction to rush in behind

her. He hits Fait hard. A kick sends the gun flying.

Charles keeps coming. Charles keeps pounding.

Fait's hampered by Vanessa. She won't let him go. Fait

stays between Charles and Vanessa. Guarding his little

girl. Barely managing to fend off Charles, a seemingly

unstoppable force.

The fight winds through the planes, under wings, through

struts.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION

Fait, Charles and Vanessa.    No clear shot.

MILES

comms Fait.

FAIT, CHARLES AND VANESSA

The fight continues.   Fait's suffering under Charles' brutal

attack. When...

Vanessa causes Fait to stumble near a plane.   They fall.

Charles moves in. And...

Fait's hand goes to a set of chocks set against the plane's

wheel. The chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by

a length of nylon rope.

Fait turns to Vanessa.

Fait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite

like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of

Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat

the living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight

back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion.

The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until...

A mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is

unconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over

Charles. Tosses the chocks down.

Fait turns. He moves back to where Vanessa's still hiding.

He scoops her up. And... Father and daughter hold each

other tight. Forever. During all of which, also INTERCUT...

EXT. HANGAR

Ling, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs

out just as... Four helicopters take off, one after the

other, carrying the buyers away.

The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting

for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a

bodyguard.

Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips

over the Frenchman's chair. Then jumps into the Agusta.

INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT

Ling puts a gun to the pilot's head.

EXT. HANGAR

Su, having left Daria to fight Sona inside, runs out.

EXT. AIRFIELD

The Agusta begins to lift off. Su starts running toward the

helicopter. Runs under the rising aircraft. Jumps. Just

in time to... Grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels.

EXT. AGUSTA

As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to

get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the process,

he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly.

INT. AGUSTA

Ling hears the THUMPS.    Looks out.

LING'S POV - SU'S LEG

swinging beneath the Agusta.

LING

To the pilot --

CLOSEUP - CONTROL PANEL

The pilot hits the wheels-up switch.     And...

SU

The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into the bottom of

the chopper. In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold.

And then... Su lets go.      Drops fifteen feet to the ground.

As...

Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams

tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta.

INT. TANK

Archie aims the cannon.

Tommy slides a shell into the breech.

Archie's locked on.     He hits the trigger.   And...

ABRAMS TANK

BOOM!   The big CANNON FIRES.      And...

SKY

The Agusta's tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON SHELL.

INT. TANK

Archie and Tommy exult.

INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT

The pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from

crashing.

EXT. AIRFIELD

The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the

hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac,

ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it

caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle

around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING

INTO FLAMES.

The spilled fuel ignites.    A circle of intense fire.   With

Su in the middle.

The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the

circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside.

Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones.

Su is waiting.

The final fight begins.

The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire,

using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the

equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death.

For a long time, the fight could go either way. Until...

Ling gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes

and flails. Like Charles, he can't get away.

What happens next happens in an instant:

Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms.   Wrenches it.

A direction it can't go.

Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP.

Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic

Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from

Ling's pocket. And...

Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags,

choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror-

stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment.

Then, in SUBTITLED Chinese --

And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand

blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that...

INSIDE LING'S THROAT

The CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS. Releasing the hot, glowing

white sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe. The fragment's

super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook

Ling's body from within. The power of a few thousand

microwave ovens turned on all at once.

Ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as...

ANGLE BACK ON LING

As, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, Ling flash-cooks

from the inside out.

Not simply burned. Horribly desiccated. His seared and

darkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his

skeleton. Human jerky.

In a moment, it's finished. Ling's dry-roasted remains

topple over. Su has closed a chapter.

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

Su and Fait meet on the tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait's

holding Vanessa, asleep in his arms. SIRENS APPROACH in

b.g.

The two men regard each other a moment.

They see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive

in b.g.

A look between Fait and Su.   Su nods.

Fait looks at Vanessa again.     Finding a new purpose in her

eyes. Beat.

He regards the others.

Fait's eyes meet Tommy's.     Beat.   Tommy nods.

Fait looks to Daria for her answer.

He looks to Miles.

Fait looks back to Su.   They hold the look.

Another beat. Then they turn and start walking toward the

arriving cop cars. Daria and Miles follow. Archie and

Tommy lag behind. As they all walk away from us --

And so on... OFF which, we...
