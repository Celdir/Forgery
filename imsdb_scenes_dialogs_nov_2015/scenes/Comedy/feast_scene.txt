FADE IN:

EXT. DESERT -- DAY

The white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a

cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill.

Far in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its

way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES

perched on a barren tree watch the intruders.

EXT. DESERT -- DAY

The truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching

coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky,

weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut

and naive).

Chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth

before them.

Chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck.

The logo on the rear gate reads "WIGWAM WASTE MANAGEMENT."

The gate drops revealing their full load of YELLOW BARRELS

bearing the familiar BIOHAZARD WASTE symbol.

INT. CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER

College Boy and Lanky steer a cart loaded with the first

barrel inside. Chief's lone beam of light leads the men.

College Boy shakes his head "no" and they set the cart down.

College Boy is rapt.

Something GRABS College Boy's ankles, causing him to jump.

Lanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The

two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed.

Then, a sound. All eyes turn.

As Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe.

Instantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A

group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave,

CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams.

MEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched

a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around

her neck. She charges towards Chief.

Panicked, Chief drops his pick-axe and stumbles back.

In unison, the hippies start CHANTING.

A BEARDED CAMERAMAN with a huge KEY RING on his belt, films

the whole event. The three men are stopped in their tracks.

Chief, shaken, confirms the injunction and hands it back.

He snaps his fingers, motioning to the barrel.

Backing away, looking to Mean Green.

Hastily, the men roll the barrel out of the cave.

The hippies let out a spirited cheer. One pulls out a

tambourine, drums the beat for KUM BI YA. The rest join in

the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their

truck and peel away.

At the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, FUZZY, moves

to hang a GREENPEACE sign. Mean Green strokes the cave wall.

Fuzzy hammers the sign in, but hits too hard, causing a breach

in the rock wall.

Fuzzy puts her face up to the hole for a closer look. The

rest of the hippie-chain moves in closer.

CHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into Fuzzy's skull.

Blood SPLATTERS on the hippies.

Bearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach.

Fuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles

forward.

Mean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't.

One by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death.

Ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls.

Bearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him.

Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing

both his arms.

Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She

HAMMERS at the chain around her waist.

Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she

BREAKS the chain, popping herself free.

She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her

fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening.

She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!

Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness.

The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light.

As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK...

EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

Neon light flashes UNITED NATIONS TAVERN. Laughing and music

emanates. Besides the bar, there's nothing around for miles.

A 1985, pristine black Pontiac Trans-Am with a Golden Eagle

on the hood pulls up. The rear bumper sticker reads "MY OTHER

A weasel-like man with a fat belly and tank-top emerges from

the hot rod carrying a VELVET POOL CUE CASE. Freeze on him.

The rest of the parking lot is scattered with cars and pickup

trucks. Bozo lazily makes his way to the bar and pushes

through the front entrance --

tail, don't you dare call him an alcoholic) stands by the

bar's POOL TABLE powdering his cue.

The CD spins and an 1980s heavy metal classic KICKS IN.

Bozo, mouthing the lyrics, struts away.

INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- NIGHT

Beer Guy pulls the keg from the elevator and places it next

Trampy seethes as she chooses which obscenity to deliver.

Adulterer slides a wad of cash to Tuffy.

EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

Bozo looks grimly at a pile of CASH on the ledge of the pool

Edgy looks to Para, distracted. Bozo quickly replaces the

WHITE CUE BALL with one hidden in his waistline.

EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

P.O.V. - The bar's a quarter mile away.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

Para's chair back aims at the pool table pocket of which

Edgy Cat is lining up for the winning shot.

SMACK! The nine ball sinks in the pocket, the cue ball

ricochets away as intended.

Para flips a switch under his wheelchair's arm rest. The cue

ball strays ODDLY into the pocket near Para. Scratch.

EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

P.O.V. - Hurtling toward the double doors and --

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

BOOM! The double doors to the bar are kicked open by HERO

(30s, rugged alpha man built to kick ass).

KRASH! Belle DROPS a second tray of drinks --

MUSIC CUTS OUT

Hero is scraped, bruised and bloodied. He is dressed in blue

denim and holds a RUST-RED SHOTGUN and GUNNY SACK.

He SLAMS the double doors shut and props a chair against the

handles, securing them.

Bartender cocks his SHOTGUN.

Hero puts down the shotgun and moves towards Bartender.

Hero reveals a drool-dripping, white, GRANDPA BEAST HEAD

from the gunny sack and holds it out and for all to see.

Grandpa Beast's head has large red eyeballs and a mouth full

of jagged, ivory white teeth. It is like an albino jackal

head with spiked hair.

The bar stares at him, slack-jawed.

The Bartender lowers his shotgun slightly. Fast as a snake,

Hero GRABS it. He notices the engraving, "THE JUDGE."

Hero looks out the lone front window.

Belle moves to a pay phone at the end of the bar.

CRASH! A white Beast arms BURSTS through the window and SPLITS

Hero right down the middle. The Judge FIRES into the ceiling --

SECOND FLOOR

The Judge's blast blows a toe off Boss Man's RIGHT FOOT as

he reaches climax with Tuffy. Boss Man HOLLERS.

MAIN BAR

Hero's right half is JERKED outside through the window.

Blood sprays. Rapid chomping. CRASH! The double doors are

kicked open, splintering the propped up chair.

HEROINE (Native American, rugged, ripped pants, wickedly

hot) rushes in, slams the doors shut and instinctively kicks

up the RUST RED SHOTGUN. She flips it sideways and slides

the metal weapon through the handles of the double doors,

securing them.

BAM! A massive HIT slams into the doors from the outside

sending Heroine SLIDING across the floor.

She SPRINGS to her feet and drives her weight into a table

attempting to hoist it over the now open window.

Old Vet and Harley Mom rush to Heroine's aid. They raise the

table to cover the gaping hole. Heroine looks outside.

A BEAST nails the rising table, just missing Heroine's face.

The table falls, pinning Heroine.

JUNIOR BEAST enters. He's small and too fast to see well.

He SWIPES the heads off Old Vet and Harley Mom. Bartender

grabs The Judge, but he's SCRATCHED down the back.

Junior Beast rips out the pay phone. Knocks over the TV.

Yanks out half of Trampy's hair.

Edgy Cat CHARGES the spastic monster with a stool.

Edgy Cat misses. Junior Beast sends him FLYING into a wall.

BLAM! BLAM! Bartender FIRES The Judge at the creature hitting

lights instead. An errant shot destroys Edgy Cat's face.

Para covers as Junior Beast RIPS the back of his wheelchair.

Roadie WHACKS Junior Beast with a chair. Stunned, it flies

across the room, landing in a metal ICE COOLER.

Bozo SLAMS it closed, capturing Junior Beast.

EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Shadows of THREE SHRIEKING BEASTS close in on the window...

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Bartender runs across the bar and SLAMS shut the thick wood

shutters. The Beasts HIT, cracking the middle.

Roadie power lifts the table with Heroine and braces it

against the window for reinforcement, but a FURRY ARM busts

through and grabs the other half of Hero.

Blood starts to SPRAY from outside as the rest of Hero is

being devoured through the smallish hole.

Heroine works a GOLD RING off of Hero's ring finger. The

feeding MOMMA BEAST'S head breaks in through the hole. It

grabs Heroine's left forearm.

Bartender aims The Judge at the Beast...

Roadie KNOCKS The Judge up -- BLAM!

SECOND FLOOR

The Judge's shotgun blast blows off another toe on Boss Man's

RIGHT FOOT. He cries out in agony.

MAIN BAR

Heroine spins and buries a splintered piece of the broken

chair into the ATTACKING MOMMA BEAST'S RIGHT EYE. The Beast

SCREECHES and jerks back, dragging the rest of Hero outside.

Heroine clutches the ring. Shrieks and flapping wings are

heard outside. They dissipate. A moment of calm.

Belle timidly holds the receiver of the busted pay phone.

The other patrons emerge from under tables and other hiding

spaces in various states of shock. Junior Beast has

momentarily stopped moving. Bozo secures the lid with a nearby

PADLOCK.

Wild-eyed and with a trembling hand, Heroine pours herself a

shot from the bar. She downs it and takes a long breath.

Freeze on her.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

There is a HOLLER at the top of the stairs. Everyone turns.

Boss Man hobbles down the stairs with the help of Tuffy. His

foot is a bloody mess. He is holding a .38.

Belle and Bartender move to his aid.

Boss Man looks to Bozo.

Boss Man squints skeptically. Adulterer points to GRANDPA

BEAST'S HEAD on the bar.

NOTE: As Heroine describes each beast, we see a slight glimpse

of their virtues, hidden mainly by shadows and fog.

EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

TEEN BEAST has a big head and awkward body. He clumsily moves

and seems uncomfortable in his own skin.

INT. BAR FRONT -- NIGHT

Heroine tends to her scratched arm.

EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

MOMMA BEAST flashes out from the dark. She's shorter than

Teen, but much wider. She has a big mouth and NATIONAL

GEOGRAPHIC BOOBS that hang down to her waist. She covers her

stabbed right eye and SCREECHES.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

Heroine taps her right eye.

EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

A blur of muscles, bloody fur, and teeth.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

The entire bar stares at Heroine with their mouths agape.

Heroine eyes the room.

Tuffy races toward the staircase to the SECOND FLOOR.

Tuffy is halfway up the stairs.

SECOND FLOOR

Tuffy BURSTS through the door. Cody sits by the TV, unmoved.

Tuffy pulls Cody into her arms. Heroine and Bartender halt

to guard the doorway. Heroine spots a SMALL PORTAL WINDOW.

SMASH! Papa Beast BURSTS through the portal window and RIPS

Cody's torso from Tuffy's grasp. Tuffy holds his DANGLING

ARMS. Blood sprays everywhere.

Papa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy! Bartender SHOOTS, nailing Papa

Beast. He hisses, but can't fit through the small window.

Bartender aims again for a kill shot, but Papa Beast

projectile vomits Cody's remains at Bartender.

Papa Beast retracts out the portal window. Heroine SLAMS the

wood shutters closed.

Tuffy drops Cody's arms. Bug-eyed. She moves, zombie-like,

to the staircase. Bartender follows, covered in Papa Beast's

bile. Heroine locks the staircase door shut.

MAIN BAR

Beer Guy stares at the bile covered Bartender.

He hands him a towel. Tuffy slowly walks towards the rest of

the patrons. The blood on her face and chest tells them what

happened. The horror hits home.

Heroine eyes the destroyed phone.

Heroine puts a hand up to silence Coach.

Bartender emerges from the back holding a mess of plastic

and wires.

Trampy's eyes light up and she digs through her purse.

Grandpa and Grandma have calmly re-taken their seats.

Bartender hesitantly tosses a wash towel over the Grandpa

Beast head at the end of the bar.

Para is awkwardly trying to fix the back of his wheelchair.

Belle moves over to help and sees a mess of wires coming

from the wheelchair's back rest.

Belle puts together his scam with a smirk.

Trampy pulls out a CELLULAR PHONE from her purse.

The group looks over. Adulterer GRABS it.

Beer Guy walks from behind the bar.

Trampy stares with grief in her eyes.

Adulterer looks at the phone a bit dazed.

He moves towards the front door. Heroine moves into his path.

Adulterer, violently grabs Heroine to shove her away.

Heroine nails Adulterer with THREE HITS to the chin, throat

and chest, flipping him to the floor. She pulls a KNIFE from

her belt buckle and has it under Adulterer's chin.

Adulterer squirms.

Adulterer nods obediently. Heroine removes the knife from

his neck and plants it back into her buckle.

Adulterer takes his seat. He looks over at the half bald

Trampy. She looks at him, hurt.

At the bar, Bozo puts the TV back into place, he jiggles

with some wires in the back, bringing back the picture.

The bar takes notice. Trampy, cell phone in hand, paws through

a phone book as she watches the broadcast.

ON TV: The Newscaster reads the teleprompter.

Heroine eagerly looks on, moving closer to the TV.

ON TV: There is an awkward pause from the Newscaster. The

broadcast doesn't cut to the reporter.

Heroine sinks in her skin.

ON TV: A REPORTER, in an even worse suit, stands in a field

with several people looking through telescopes.

Heroine sighs a gust of relief.

The Reporter beams.

In the studio, the Newscaster smirks.

Roadie points to the TV.

Trampy is already dialing on the cell.

ON TV: the Newscaster continues his routine.

A Beast arm REACHES in and TEARS off Newscaster's jaw. The

bar gasps in horror as his blood sprays. ZAP! The broadcast

cuts out, turning to static.

Trampy screams and DROPS the cell, SHATTERING on impact.

Heroine, tense, quells the rising panic.

Tuffy looks up from a booth, clearing her throat.

Heroine looks over, making eye contact.

At the door, Heroine slides a thick metal pole through the

double door handles and takes out the Rust Red shotgun.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

The last board is hammered into place as the survivors back

away from the now re-enforced bar.

BAM-BAM-BAM! Junior Beast bangs around in the ice cooler.

Boss Man hobbles over to the cooler and aims his .38. Junior

Beast goes wild, trying to get out.

Bullets rip through the cooler. Junior squeals. More shots.

Casings hit the ground. Smoke rises. Bozo leans in.

RAH! A tiny white arm fires out from the cooler GRABBING

Bozo's leg. Bozo yelps.

Moving quick, Tuffy grabs The Judge from Bartender and shoves

the barrel into a hole.

BLAM! Guts splatter. Bozo falls back unscathed. He catches

his breath and looks to Tuffy. She is born again, seething.

She hands the shotgun back to Bartender.

Coach steps forward, poised to make the sale.

The bar skeptically eyes the large, sweaty Greek man.

Bartender opens the cooler's lid and carefully pulls out

Junior Beast with salad tongs. It falls to the floor with a

SPLAT. Coach grabs a splintered broomstick.

He buries the broomstick into Junior's side and carries the

limp carcass towards a covered hole in the wall.

Roadie pries off a board to reveal a pumpkin sized hole.

Coach shoves Junior's mangled body through to the outside.

The whole bar moves to the side wall to see how the Beast

family will react. They look through SMALL HOLES, barely

able to see anything.

Bozo's insult hangs in the air.

P.O.V - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

WHOOSH! Junior is swiped from the handmade pike.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Coach jerks back. The startled group tries to focus, but

it's too dark outside. With the moon as the only light, Father

Beast can barely be made out cradling his dead child.

Silhouettes of the other family members slowly approach

Junior. Papa Beast is gentle and it's almost endearing.

The whole group starts to ease. Then... Papa Beast HOLLERS.

P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

Papa Beast lets out a HORRID WAIL. The group jumps back,

covering their ears. Then, something really odd happens.

Momma tosses Junior in the air, opens her wide jaws and

SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Adulterer's eyes widen.

P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

Papa Beast moves behind Momma Beast and grabs hold of her.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

A steady "thud-thud-thud" rhythm vibrates the bar. Grandpa's

drink starts to hop to edge of his table with the beats. The

group maneuvers to get a better look.

P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

Yes, Momma Beast and Papa Beast are having MONSTER SEX.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

Unlike humans, Papa Beast finishes and the birth cycle lasts

all of thirty seconds. Momma Beast's belly balloons up and

she squats. POP! A SLIMY OBJECT the size and shape of a vacuum

cleaner drops from her.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Trampy VOMITS.

P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

The slimy object SPLITS in half. The two halves spring

appendages and raise their heads. The TWIN SISTER BEASTS

have been born.

Papa moves forward and cleans off his new baby girls. The

Beast Girls look at the bar and hiss in unison.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Heroine's eyes bulge.

SLAM-SLAM! The two hissing Beast Girls strike the bar front.

Roadie shoves that board back over the hole. Beer Guy is

holding back the still heaving Trampy's hair.

Bozo pops open a beer off the back of Para's wheelchair.

Roadie nods to Grandpapa Beast's head on the end of the bar.

Heroine turns.

Shrieking and flapping grows in the distance.

Heroine and Hero look at each other with concern. Hero looks

PLOP! A HORSE'S HEAD falls as Heroine and her companions

peek out from the damaged cellar door.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- LATE DAY

The sun is falling into the horizon. The traveler's CAMARO

pulls into a small gas station

EXT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

Heroine goes up to the service window with Tubbs and looks

inside. Nobody. There is a slight BUZZING from inside.

Hero hollers from the fuel pump by the car.

She follows the buzzing sound to a corner of the room. There

is a swarm of black flies crawling over half a STATION

ATTENDANT'S gutted torso.

Glass shatters as Heroine reaches inside to turn on the pumps.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

EXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY

Hero fills their Camaro.

INT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

Heroine and Tubbs hastily grabs food and drinks, ignoring

the cash register completely. The sun is setting.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

EXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY

Heroine and Tubbs emerge from the gas station shop.

Heroine and Tubbs hear the growing cries of the Beasts.

Their loot hits the pavement as they run.

Hero drops the spilling gas nozzle. Tubbs slides into the

back as Heroine jumps into the driver's seat.

Hero runs over the top of the Camaro and slides into the

sunroof. He grabs a rifle and aims toward the leaking gas

pool. Something rises in the gas station.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

EXT. GAS STATION -- SUNSET

Three lean, muscular shapes rise from the shadows.

Heroine fires up the car and tears out. Hero shoots and the

station becomes a FIREBALL.

INT. CAMARO -- CONTINUOUS

Hero lowers into the back seat and starts to close the roof

as STRIPPED COUSIN BEAST lands on top of the car...

Stripped Cousin Beast PUNCHES through the back window,

reaching for them. Heroine jerks the wheel.

The car 180's and the Beast sails off of the car into

darkness. The Camaro tears down a tangent dirt road.

Hero reaches back to give a "five" to Tubbs. Tubbs doesn't

respond. Heroine is the first to see Tubbs' quivering,

HEADLESS body in the back seat.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

Heroine stands near Grandpa Beast's head.

INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT

BOOM! Grandpa Beast LANDS on the front hood of the Camaro.

Heroine and Hero SCREAM and rev the engine, swerving madly

as Grandpa Beast VOMITS on the windshield.

Heroine slams on the breaks. Grandpa Beast slides back,

holding onto the grill.

Grandpa Beast tears into the engine through the grill as

sparks and smoke shoot out. Heroine jerks the steering wheel.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT

The car crashes into a ditch, DECAPITATING Grandpa Beast.

His head FIRES through the windshield, landing on Heroine's

lap. Its snake-like tongue lashes out at Heroine's crotch.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

Para wheels over to a COUNTY MAP on the side wall.

Para stares intently at the map. Adulterer moves over to the

window that has shutters over it, peeking through a hole.

The room is silent. Bozo looks around, quickly moving towards

Grandpa and Grandma.

Bozo saunters off.

Para points along the map as he explains.

The group is silent.

FROM ADULTERER'S P.O.V. - He peeks out the hole and sees

nothing but the dark night. Bartender eyes him.

BOINK! Papa Beast's claw POKES into his eye. Adulterer JERKS

away holding his blood squirting eye socket.

FROM OUTSIDE

P.O.V. - The eye sees its owner stumble back and fall to

the floor holding his face.

INSIDE

Coach and Trampy move to help Adulterer.

FROM OUTSIDE

The eyeball fires into Papa's drooling mega-mouth. SLURP!

INSIDE

BASH! A Beast arm BURSTS through the side wall and SNAGS

Coach's pants and boxers. He screams and lunges forward. He

is BOTTOMLESS.

Everyone obeys her command to get in the middle of the room.

Belle hands Coach a little menu to cover himself with.

The group nods.

Trampy holds Adulterer's wounded head.

Coach heads to the bar. Roadie moves to the map near Para.

Roadie nods. Heroine jerks a bottle of booze from Beer Guy

and tosses it out.

Boss Man, pale and morphine pumped, sits at a table with his

foot raised.

Beer Guy scans the stocked bar wall.

The crowd turns to face Grandpa and his wife.

Grandpa holds on to Grandma's hand as he speaks.

The group looks back to Heroine.

Trampy pensively stays on her fractured phone.

Bozo blinks. A little taken aback.

Bartender hands him The Judge.

No one budges.

Bartender moves to the back of the bar, grabbing his machete.

At the same moment, Coach emerges from behind the bar in

very snug, feminine-looking pink sweat pants.

Heroine tosses the keys to Bartender.

Bozo moves to the staircase. There's blood at the bottom and

it gets worse with each step. Bartender and Coach follow.

Heroine turns to the bar.

Tuffy stands, sniffling. She wipes the tears from her eyes,

looking tough and resolute.

Heroine, Tuffy, Roadie, and Beer Guy all move to the basement.

The door creaks open slowly. The group descends.

OUTSIDE THE DOOR

Bozo slightly slips on the blood. He grips the railing and

pulls himself up the staircase like an old man.

They unlock the door, swinging it open.

Bartender has the key in the thick dead bolt, ready to move.

SECOND FLOOR

Bozo hustles in. The door shuts and locks.

WHAM! Bozo is on the ground.

OUTSIDE THE DOOR

SECOND FLOOR

Bozo rises and nervously surveys the damaged floor.

Bozo jumps when he sees the gore and the bloody shoes from

Cody's attack. The TV illuminates the room.

MAIN BAR

Belle kneels next to the Boss Man.

He pulls a bottle out of his pocket and hands it to her.

She puts a few drops on his out-stretched tongue.

BASEMENT

The basement is dark, dingy and scattered with crap. Dried

out ANIMAL CARCASSES hang from the ceiling on hooks. A WINDOW

is open. Roadie slams it shut, eyeing the room, staring into

the dark corners.

Tuffy tightly grips her weapon, ready to fire. Heroine kneels

next to a hatch door that emits a red glow.

Roadie jams a pipe into the little door, bracing it shut.

Beer Guy finds the dusty locker and opens it.

OUTSIDE THE DOOR

Bartender and Coach have their ears pressed to the door.

Behind them, through a boarded window, something CRAWLS

upward.

SECOND FLOOR

Bozo moves turtle slow.

He moves to the Boss Man's private room. He puts his hand

out to open it. Trembling, he touches the knob and...

CREEEEEEEEAK! The door eases open. Bozo steps inside the

room. He moves over to a lamp and pulls the chain. A bat

FLIES off the lamp shade SCREECHING. Bozo falls backwards.

OUTSIDE THE DOOR

Bartender and Coach jump back.

SECOND FLOOR

Bozo gets off the floor again. He may have filled his pants.

OUTSIDE THE DOOR

SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

The room is like a converted pantry. Boss Man lies on a cot,

kissing Belle. A tiny wall fan spins providing ventilation.

Belle pulls away and brushes back her long hair.

Belle, a bit high, sways and starts to remove her clothes.

She takes off her blouse and tosses it at him. She then lifts

up her skirt and bends over, giggling.

BASEMENT

Roadie emerges with two crates. He dumps them on the floor.

Beer Guy holds a rusted machete.

Heroine moves to the stairs, but stops. She grabs Tuffy by

the arm and takes her aside.

Heroine reaches into her shirt and pulls out an IDENTICAL

LOCKET as Tuffy's. She opens it and displays a picture of a

LITTLE GIRL.

SECOND FLOOR

Bozo turns and points the gun around the room. He sees the

CB. It is like an intercom with a cable running outside. He

drops the shotgun and fidgets with the CB knobs.

All he gets is static. A faint GROWL is heard outside. OUTSIDE

THE DOOR Bartender hears the growl, his eyes grow wide.

SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

Belle rubs her hands over her rounded ass and flicks her

tongue at Boss Man.

She cringes and backs up a little.

Belle, hearing the crash, jerks back from Boss Man.

CRASH! Sister Beast #1 and Sister Beast #2 punch through the

tiny wall fan and GRAB Belle by the scalp. She is JERKED

against the wall.

She's slammed against it repeatedly and then -- RIP! Belle's

skin is TORN from her head and torso. Boss Man jumps back.

Belle falls into Boss Man's arms for a HIDEOUS KISS.

Boss Man shoves the bloody Belle back against the wall.

Sister Beast #1 pokes her head inside the room, hissing.

in pain. Sister Beast #2 tongue-lasso's his other foot.

Heroine's picking fingers are bleeding from her effort.

SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

Boss Man is pulled towards the Sister Beasts.

Roadie kicks open the door and FIRES at the Sisters. They

dive back out of the room screeching.

Right behind Bozo, the boards fly off the portal window.

Papa Beast flies at Bozo. Bozo spins and aimlessly FIRES his

shotgun, hitting Papa Beast directly in the groin.

The door flies open. Bozo is YANKED to safety just as Papa

STRIKES the closing door.

MAIN BAR

The patrons track the wild CRASHING and HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING

sounds of Papa Beast. He finally breaks out of the upstairs.

Beer Guy and Roadie carry Boss Man into the room as Coach,

Bartender, Heroine and the shaken Bozo creep down the stairs.

Bozo slowly takes a seat in his brother's lap.

Heroine glares at Boss Man.

Coach eyes the group, this is his time to shine.

Long silence. Bozo stares.

Coach sits down, humbled.

The room is silent. Bartender motions to Boss Man, but he is

promptly shushed by Boss Man. Heroine notices.

Heroine glares at Roadie.

Roadie nods, causing Boss Man to sigh.

They clam up.

Boss Man reluctantly pulls out some keys that are on a string

around his neck.

Coach stands forward.

SMACK! Bozo SLAPS Coach's ass.

Heroine takes The Judge from Bartender and hands it to Coach.

Coach takes the rusty machete from Beer Guy.

Heroine, Roadie, and Coach move to the basement.

The three look to Bozo, who offers a parting nod.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

At a booth, Trampy re-bandages Adulterer's eye.

Bozo moves close, surveying the bandage work.

Bozo turns his attention back to Trampy.

INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Heroine, Roadie, and Coach make their way through the

basement. Creeks and cracks with every step.

The light casts a shadow of something BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

Roadie moves to open the curtain with his sawed-off barrel.

WHIP! The curtain slides. It's a dried animal hide on a hook.

They all sigh. Roadie unblocks the tiny door.

Heroine scans the room.

Coach's hand shakes as he raises his weapon.

Roadie, Heroine raise their weapons.

Roadie whips open the door. Nothing.

BANG-GONG-GONG! Some pipes CRASH to the ground next to them...

they jump, but nothing is there. A LITTLE MOUSE emerges from

the fallen heap.

Coach leans down and puts out his hand. He smiles as Heroine

watches over his shoulder.

He leaves the mouse and follows Heroine to the tunnel.

SLURP! A pink tongue LASSOS the mouse.

A red fluorescent glow radiates from the tunnel. They all

drop in, one by one, entering the steamy, confined space.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

Tuffy stands by a far wall, looking through the planks for

movement. At the bar, Beer Guy makes MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.

Bozo moves close, slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand.

Bozo grabs a cloth rag and moves to the alcohol bottles.

INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

The tunnel is thin and no more than SIX FEET HIGH. Cherry

red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and kneehigh

marijuana plants are along the ground soil. There are thick

pipes above the plants that work as a makeshift watering

system. There is about six inches of water on the floor.

Coach bites his lip, dying to say something.

INT. BAR -- NIGHT

Bozo stuffs the cloth rag into one of the bottles.

Bozo finishes the Molotov cocktail and grabs a beer.

Para and Beer Guy eye the three large peanut barrels, perfect

for bomb-making.

Bozo looks to Trampy, putting an arm around her shoulder.

INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

Roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. The

tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down.

A SCRATCHING sound is heard from above.

The scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end

of the tunnel as well.

Then, Sister Beast #1 drops into the tunnel from the far

end.

She charges. At the last second, Roadie spots her.

Roadie and Coach duck into the water, but Heroine is unable

to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards. Sister

Beast #1 lands and turns, surveying her prey. Roadie aims

his water-dripping gun, but Heroine rises and blocks his

shot.

From her knees, Heroine fires. BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! The three

shots push Sister Beast #1 backwards. Heroine rises, covered

in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face.

Roadie and Coach reluctantly turn, leaving Heroine to fend

with the Beast.

Heroine charges. Hissing, Sister Beast #1 charges as well.

Heroine pumps and fires. BOOM! Sister Beast spins, avoiding

the shot. Now too close, Heroine jams the Beast in the mouth

with the gun, knocking her back.

Sister Beast #1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm.

Heroine bats her away. Sister Beast #1 moves to the others.

Roadie and Coach sprint until Sister Beast #2 BURSTS through

the tunnel walls, stopping Roadie and Coach in their tracks.

Roadie fires his weapon, but it sparks and fizzles.

With the two Beasts closing in. The men are trapped. Coach

looks around, seeing a plan.

Grabbing onto the piping along the ceiling, Roadie pulls

himself from the water. Coach uses the machete to cut a power

cord from above. He grabs the exposed, sparking end.

Heroine sees what he's doing, sprints back the way they came.

As the two Beasts charge, Coach pulls himself out of the

water by holding onto the above piping. He's forced to wait

for Heroine to get out of the water.

The second she does, he jams the cord into the water.

ZAP! The conductive water sizzles. Sister Beast #1 and Sister

Beast #2 lock up and crash. ELECTROCUTION. Sparks and smoke

rises from their cooked bodies.

Roadie and Coach look to each other, victorious. They begin

shimmying along the piping to the end of the tunnel.

INT. TUNNEL/BASEMENT -- NIGHT

Heroine looks back at the two men. She turns and reenters

the basement.

GAH! Teen Beast drops in front of her, whacking her to the

floor. Heroine slides across the floor, but jumps up quickly.

Teen Beast cautiously moves in for the kill.

Heroine raises her weapon.

Click -- out of ammo!

Heroine THROWS the shotgun at him and pulls out the MACHETE.

She rolls left and swings. Teen Beast loses two fingers.

She swings again but gets whacked to the floor.

Heroine rolls with the hit, grabs her shotgun, and dives

into the KEG ELEVATOR.

She slams closed the door as Teen Beast regains its composure

and lunges. BAM! It CRASHES against the door.

INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

Roadie and Coach crawl to the platform by the exit.

The two men climb up the ladder leading to the ground above.

At the top, Roadie pushes off the plywood covering. The two

men peer into the night and spot the TRUCK.

INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

Heroine wedges the door closed. The Beast continues to try

to get in. Heroine bangs the top of the small elevator...

MAIN BAR

Tuffy backs up and hears the screams from the keg elevator.

Beer Guy hits the button. The gears grind and start to pull

the elevator up to the main floor.

As Teen Beast starts to tear at the base of the rising keg

elevator in the shaft, Heroine pounds and tears at the few

planks above her in the keg elevator.

MAIN BAR

INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

Heroine almost has the primary cable cut. Teen Beast rises

up to bite.

SNAP!! The cable BREAKS. Heroine SOARS up the shaft. Teen

Beast is pulled down to the bottom. The keg elevator door

bursts open on impact.

Heroine SLAMS into the ceiling, kicking and yelling.

MAIN BAR

Tuffy KNOCKS Adulterer's shotgun up, takes the gun, and rips

open the keg door. Heroine swings out.

P.O.V. - Teen Beast is right behind her with mouth open and

ready to feed. Tuffy points her shotgun.

BLAM! Teen lurches back, dropping back down the shaft.

Tuffy slams the keg door shut. Heroine pants on the floor.

Adulterer is down, winded.

She turns to Adulterer, rigid.

Adulterer nods, ashamed. Heroine looks around the bar. She

notices the peanut barrels on top of the bar. Two wooden

planks serve as track, leading straight for the side wall.

Bartender expels a shell from The Judge and hands it over.

Heroine cringes, eyeing the lined up Molotov cocktails.

Boss Man sips a bottle, still hopped-up on morphine. He lazily

loads his pistol from a pool of bullets on his belly.

Boss Man shrugs, content with himself.

CRASH! Teen Beast's arm ERUPTS through the Boss Man's belly.

His pistol and bullets scatter across the floor.

SNAPPP!!! His head and legs SLAP together as the arm pulls

him through a small hole in the floor.

The group jumps back. Blood rockets out. His body is pureed

down the tiny hole.

Everyone struggles to get on the tables.

CRASH! Teen Beast's arm reaches up and GRABS Para's

wheelchair, violently shaking it. Para FALLS to the floor.

Teen Beast's arm grabs Para's leg...

Bozo jumps from a table and STOMPS on Teen Beast's arm. He

picks up Para and TOSSES him onto a table.

Bozo leaps back onto a table. POP! The power cuts out. The

room goes black.

And with that, the shouting and pounding stops. The group

nervously shuffles around the tables.

There's silence.

Dead silence.

Then, far is the distance, beyond the walls, a sound is heard.

It's screaming. And it's approaching. Rapidly. The survivors

maneuver to peek out the front walls.

Tuffy sees what is coming.

EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Being held by Papa and Momma Beast, Roadie and Coach are

both rushed towards the wall like human battering rams.

THUD! The first strike causes the men to HOWL.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

The survivors shake in sickened silence. From beyond the

walls, they can hear high-pitched SCREAMS.

THUD! THUD! THUD! With every strike, a splattering of blood

spits through the planks of wood.

The entire group goes into motion.

THUD! THUD! THUD! With a final furious strike, a few wood

planks splinter. Papa Beast sticks in his head and hisses.

From the bar, Beer Guy, Tuffy, and Adulterer release the

first peanut barrel. It's ablaze and sails straight for Papa

Beast. BLAM! It explodes, bursting open the wall and knocking

back Papa Beast. The wooden walls go up in flame.

Para, on a side table, reaches out and grabs Boss Man's .38

from the floor.

The second peanut barrel is released. It sails outside the

breach, but it doesn't explode. Nevertheless, the Beasts

stay far away.

Teen Beast madly rips floor boards away, moving towards Para's

table. Teen Beast bursts through the floor, knocking Para to

the floor.

Para crawls to his fallen wheelchair. Teen Beast spots him,

moves in to feed.

Para points his seat back at the scattered .38 bullets and

flips the armrest switch. SNAP! The bullets jump to the power

magnet. Para yanks one free, loads the pistol and turns just

as Teen Beast strikes...

POP! The shot hits Teen Beast in the eye, sending him back

down the hole in the floor.

Heroine and Bartender move in. When Teen Beast sticks his

head out of the hole again, they thrust both their shotguns

into each ear.

BLAM-BLAM! The two shots scatter head everywhere.

The flames in the bar spread, catching the entire wall and

roof on fire.

EXT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

The second barrel comes to a stop a good distance from the

bar. Suddenly, the top is knocked off. Trampy sticks her

head out.

Seeing no trouble, she emerges, dizzy as hell, and races for

the nearby BEER TRUCK.

INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

Papa and Momma Beast both charge the bar. The third peanut

barrel is released. It sails for them, but they dive out of

the way.

KABLOOM! It takes out the rest of the wall. Fire and smoke

fills the place.

Adulterer douses Momma Beast with booze as Beer Guy nails

her with a lit Molotov cocktail.

WHOOSH! Engulfed in flame, she bolts from the bar shrieking.

Papa enters and is instantly cornered. He swings wildly.

Heroine and Bartender rip the DEER HEAD from the wall and

charge Papa, pinning him against the wall with the antlers.

Bozo and Beer Guy dive into Papa's legs, holding them down.

Tuffy picks up The Judge.

WHAM! The shotgun butt knocks out Papa's front teeth. Tuffy

raises the weapon again, staring down at the monster that

killed her child, but Papa Beast gets an arm free to knock

away her fatal blow.

Bartender wrenches Papa Beast's arm with all his might. With

her hair stuck in Papa Beast's claw, Tuffy is pulled face to

face with the beast. She squirms as he chomps at her, but

with no front teeth, he can't do immediate damage.

Tuffy reaches back and shoves her fist into Papa Beast's

mouth, jamming it down his throat. He instantly gags, sucking

for air.

Papa Beast struggles to get free, but the others hold tight.

Papa Beast's body begins to quiver from a lack of oxygen.

His eyes widen, face to face with Tuffy.

With one last lunge, Papa Beast shakes, his life drifting

away. His eyes turn black as his body goes limp. Tuffy pulls

out her arm from his throat.

Tuffy shakes her wet arm dry. As the group pulls away, Papa

Beast is still pinned to the wall with the deer antlers dug

into the wood.

Heroine turns to Grandma and Grandpa, offering a hand.

Heroine swallows and nods. HONK-HONK-HONK! Just outside the

breached wall, the beer truck pulls up.

EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

The beer truck screeches to a halt. Trampy's at the wheel,

waving the group over. With the bar burning, a thick layer

of SMOKE blankets the entire area.

The people amass at the opening, but Heroine stops them from

advancing. The group stares the dark night. Silent.

Heroine eyes the truck, seeing something she likes.

She creeps out alone.

Nothing. Just smoke. And silence.

From the smoke, a smoldering Momma Beast charges like a bull.

At the truck, Heroine opens the back doors and dives in,

leaving the doors open. Momma Beast gives chase, entering

the back.

INSIDE TRUCK

Heroine is deep into the truck as Momma Beast enters. She

advances, hissing.

Momma howls and charges. Heroine slides out the side keg

door, locking it behind her. Before Momma can see the trap,

Beer Guy slam closed the rear doors.

OUTSIDE TRUCK

Beer Guy latches it. Trampy comes around the truck.

Heroine looks to the others at the breach.

The others move into action. Beer Guy takes off his shirt

and shoves it into the fuel tank. Adulterer and Bozo, with

Para riding piggyback, help. They use the Molotov cocktails

to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck.

About fifteen yards away from the truck. Bozo throws his

silver-plated American Eagle lighter to Heroine.

Then, a noise: EOCH-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK!

A deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck.

It's Momma Beast. Again and again.

Heroine drops the lighter onto the fuel. It races for the

truck. When feet away, COUSIN BEAST lands, stomping out the

fire with his foot.

Instantly, another beast, AUNT BEAST, lands on the top of

the truck. These Beasts are like the others, but stripped.

The group gasps. Trampy backs away.

BURST! Trampy's rib cage is ripped from her body. The culprit,

UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box

of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar.

From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma

Beast emerges.

The Beasts spring into action, chasing the group.

Bozo, with Para on his back, sprints for his car. Aunt Beast

RIPS Para from Bozo's back.

Bozo runs for his Trans-Am. Para falls to the ground, still

alive. Bozo turns back and sees him.

Bozo grabs his brother and puts him on his back again, runs.

Para is RIPPED into the air again.

Tuffy and Bartender jump into his PICKUP TRUCK.

Heroine hops in the back.

Beer Guy and Adulterer run to a car together. Beer Guy lags

behind, continually looking over his shoulder.

As Beer Guy looks forward, Aunt Beast and Uncle Beast hit

him HIGH-AND-LOW, cutting him in half. Bozo makes it to his

Trans-Am.

VAHVVVOOOMMMM! The car roars to life. He pushes in a tape.

The "MIAMI VICE" theme song blares from the speakers.

Bozo peels out. Aunt Beast lands right in his path.

BAM! He SMACKS Aunt Beast head on, sending the creature's

disemboweled body sailing through the air.

Para DROPS from the sky, still ALIVE and panting. Cars are

moving everywhere.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

The burning JUKEBOX plays a slow love song. Dancing and

holding each other, Grandpa smooches Grandma on the forehead.

EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Para crawls along the ground, being ignored by the Beasts.

Bozo turns on his windshield wipers to clear off the blood

and guts. He spots Para.

Para claws the ground.

Bartender jerks the wheel of his car.

Para sees Bartender's approaching truck.

Para rolls right, just missing tires. Para yells for his

brother.

Bozo's eyes bulge.

BAM! Para is SMEARED by Adulterer's car.

Bozo floors it.

The remaining cars maneuver to hit the open road.

INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Grandpa and Grandma hold each other tight. Uncle Beast enters,

moving to their table. It moves in for the kill.

Grandpa kisses his wife gently.

The Beast OPENS its massive jaws and... CRASH! Bozo's car

DRIVES through the bar, SMEARING the Beast.

INT. BOZO'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Bozo guns the engine, crashing out the other end of the bar.

EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Bozo's car veers, flipping over a pile of rubble.

Bozo squirms in his flipped car, UPSIDE-DOWN.

He hears a Beast approaching. He pulls out a BUTTERFLY KNIFE

from the open glove box and SAWS at his safety belt.

Cousin Beast leans into the passenger side of the car and

looks him right in the eye. Bozo raises the knife.

Cousin Beast leaps in.

EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

The remaining TWO CARS race down the road.

INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

With the peddle to the floor, Bartender drives.

BAM! Momma Beast lands on the roof. She reaches inside and

yanks out Bartender's throat. The car veers.

Tuffy rights it, leaning over and stomping on the gas. Momma

yanks at the door, pulling it open. Tuffy pushes out

Bartender's corpse and JERKS the wheel.

IN THE BACK

Momma Beast falls back, knocking down Heroine. Momma Beast

nearly falls out, but manages to grab the rear gate with one

claw. Defenseless, Heroine backs away. Momma Beast holds on

tightly, pulling herself onto the bed of the truck.

Tuffy stares back through the glass, unable to do anything.

Momma Beast lunges towards Heroine. Momma Beast's claw snags

Heroine's locket, jerking Heroine right up to the creature's

face. The locket catches Momma's attention for split second.

Her remaining eye goes from the picture of Charlie to Heroine.

Momma's mouth opens wide. Heroine screams!

And then, a beam of the RISING SUN catches the gold locket

and burns into Momma's eye. In one quick motion, she's gone,

taking the locket with her.

Heroine lets out her breath, reaching around her neck for

what is no longer there. The truck SKIDS to a halt. Tuffy

jumps out.

They both jump as Adulterer approaches.

Heroine rises and moves to the cab of the truck. She finds a

pack of cigs under the visor. Pops in the lighter.

PING! The lighter springs out, hot. Heroine lights up and

passes one to Tuffy.

Moment of silence as Adulterer and Tuffy look down the

desolate road.

Tuffy nods, affectionately touching his hand.

The car peels off. Adulterer watches the car tear down the

road. He glances up at the RISING SUN.

EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

A sign reading "RED MOUNTAIN" swings lazily in the breeze.

Tuffy and Heroine coast down a town road. There are random

POOLS OF RED BLOOD in the dirt. No one in sight.

EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

Adulterer drives along a small town road. There's no sign of

life here either.

EXT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

Heroine enters the ransacked house. Tuffy follows.

INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

He enters his house. It too, is a mess.

move up the stairs to the second floor.

SECOND FLOOR

SMACK! They spin to the noise.

INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

He moves up the stairs to the master bedroom. SMACK!

There's a noise at the end of the hall. SMACK!

INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

They cautiously move to the last room in the hall. A

scratched, closed door without an outside handle.

Heroine kicks in the door and...

There's a note on a teddy beer that says, "WE WENT TO THE

SHELTER. LOVE GRANDMA AND CHARLIE."

The shudders SMACK against the wall.

INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

Adulterer holds a shattered PICTURE of his wife and two kids.

He sighs and puts it down.

EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- DAY

The sun shines bright in the cloudless sky. There is a stiff

wind that stirs up the dust. Bartender's car slowly lurches

up the street.

INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Heroine and Tuffy skeptically look at the surroundings.

EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

The car pulls up in the back of the store and stops. They

get out, looking around. Tuffy holds a machete. Adulterer

kneels against his car.

Adulterer shakes his head, acknowledging their death.

Adulterer sheepishly nods.

The group makes their way to the store front, peeking beyond

the glass doors.

In the distance, in middle of a dusty parking lot, CHARLIE

stands staring at them.

Heroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets

awkwardly. She cries and blood stains her dress.

As Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm.

The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her

ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly,

the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun.

The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast

HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to

right, panic stricken.

The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something

is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but

Adulterer holds her at bay.

At a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the

distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them.

Adulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for

Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole

cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer.

The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting

Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground.

Heroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast.

Tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store

front. As Adulterer's blood flows, Momma Beast drags him

towards her main prey.

A blanket of darkness leads Momma Beast, overtaking the

survivors. At the store front, Heroine pulls Charlie close.

EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- AN HOUR LATER

A string of ten WHITE VANS come to a halt in the dusty parking

lot. THE MAN IN TAN (45, buzz cut, leathery skin, cool) steps

from the lead van and surveys the ravaged small town.

A swarm of men emerge from the other vehicles, all dressed

alike in work boots, gas masks and coveralls. They go into

action honing in on rubble with SENSORS and COUNTERS.

TECH (27, horn-rimmed glasses, all business) eyes a laptop.

The Man in Tan closes his eyes in thought.

The Man in Tan moves to a few men standing over a pool of

blood and guts. Using the sensor equipment, the COMPANY MAN

follows the blood trail that enters the grocery store.

INT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

The place is torn to hell. Dust and soot hangs in the air.

The men instinctively raise their high-powered rifles, letting

the flashlights on the ends lead the way. They follow the

trail of blood to a back FREEZER LOCKER.

It's scratched, bashed and thrashed.

Company Man #2 steps forward and uses a metal-cutting chainsaw

to cut through the hinges. The door falls with a THUD.

As the dust clears, Tuffy, Heroine and Charlie stare back at

the men, huddled together in a defensive stance.

The Man in Tan creaks his neck.

Heroine, holding Charlie, lurches back.

The Man in Tan steps forward, guiding the group out.

EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- MOMENTS LATER

A bulky security truck pulls up. A DRIVER, holding a bloody

rag to his nose, gets out and moves to the back door.

The Driver nods to the back of the truck, opening the door.

Bozo lurches out, handcuffed and chained.

A shirtless, irate BOZO sits next to Grandpa and Grandma in

the back. He settles at the sight of the others.

Heroine covers her daughter's ears as the survivors are helped

into the truck. Tuffy sits, looking to Bozo.

Heroine, last in the truck, turns to the men.

The door shuts on Heroine's concerned face. The Man in Tan

locks eyes with the Driver.

The Driver nods back. Sinister implication understood.

The Man in Tan lights a cigarette as he watches the truck

drive off. The truck's logo reads, "FARM-AID." He inhales.

Freeze on him.

NAME: THE MAN IN TAN

AGE: 45

OCCUPATION: HE CAN'T TELL YOU

PURPOSE: TO LAY GROUNDWORK FOR SEQUEL

LIFE EXPECTANCY: PRETTY F-ING GOOD

The Man in Tan exhales a gust of smoke.
