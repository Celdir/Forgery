the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons, and the TV screen

fills with the face of DANIEL CLAMP. At a young 40, he's New

York's most successful real estate developer.

CLAMP (ON TV)

Good morning, Mister Wing. Let's

out through to key issues, okay?

I'm prepared to increase my offer

substantially.

(BEAT)

Now, Mister Wing, you're attached

to your business. I appreciate

that. I'm attached to my own

business. I develop the biggest

buildings in New York, and you

sell, ah, little things. Fine.

But I'm not just talking about

money here.

answers Forster.

MR. WING

I'm sorry. Please tell Mister

Clamp that the answer is no.

arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a

But as the helicopter starts to burn, Mr. Wing comes back and

As SEEN by Gizmo, the towering janitor stops at the department's

WATER FOUNTAIN and tries to get a drink. The fountain's spigot

OVERSHOOTS, giving the janitor a SPLASH in the face.

Gizmo inches away from the source of the water, and -- seeing a

Gizmo looks up, but too late. From his POV, the blob of paint-

tinted water is huge, and coming down fast. It HITS him --

-- and, as the janitor's feet and the wheels of his cart pass in

a.g., CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo on the floor, writhing in pain. The

janitor leaves, and Gizmo SCREAMS, as -- THWIP! THWIP! -- two

tiny FURBALLS shoot out of his body and land in the open DRAWER

of a nearby filing cabinet.

THWIP! The painful Mogwai replication continues, and a third

furball caroms off a drafting table and into a wastebasket.

THWIP! The fourth and final offspring shoots from Gizmo's body,

and -- as Gizmo watches in horror and pain -- BOUNCES crazily

around the office area, a little Superball of fur.

As Gizmo sits up and looks up, we watch with him -- four newborn

BOUNCING FURBALL hits the floor in front of him, then ricochets

up onto a DESKTOP.

To SOUND FX of a bowling ball hitting the pins, the furball

rolls into a desk corner, and the third Mogwai unfolds --

upside-down. This is DAFFY, a dizzy, uncontrollably antic

Mogwai with the demented juvenile Joie de vivre we associate

In a dimmed conference room high up in the building, Forster

backs fearfully toward a wall...
