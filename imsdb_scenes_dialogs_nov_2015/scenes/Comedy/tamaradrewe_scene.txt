Andy Cobb, early thirties, is digging an English garden in

the hot sun. He is lean, naked to the waist. It's hard to

tell which century he inhabits. Only when he stops to drink

from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time.

TESS (V.O.)

And love slipped the bonds of

restraint...

At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties,

funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring

at Andy.

TESS (V.O.)(CONT'D)

His touch was like a cosmic `yes'.

Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a

bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad,

writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work.

EUSTACIA (V.O.)

`Fuck you,' screamed Kelly, `Fuck

you to hell!' Scott stepped back

from the cell door as the gob of

spit flew.'

Sitting at a barn window is American academic Glen McCreavy ;

a physically awkward man, more at home with his intellect

than his body. He is surrounded by foolscap, post-it notes,

books and markers - dominated by a poster of a dour Victorian

- Thomas Hardy. He is writing.

GLEN (V.O.)

This complex contemporary matrix is

what Hardy meant by `the ache of

modernism.'

He regards it.

Crap.

He deletes it. He looks at his blank screen, breathing

deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'.

NICHOLAS (V.O.)

Inchcombe had seen it all before.

He'd seasoned it: the metallic

smell of blood and gunshot;

forensics hunched like vultures.

The dreadful mundanity of murder,

he thought.

Nicholas Hardiment writes fluidly with pencil and paper. A

good-looking man of fifty. Dark hair, strong figure.

NICHOLAS (V.O.)

He approached Patel, who was

stricken. She was one for whom a

corpse was still an obscenity.

Inchcombe realised a disturbing

truth. His lack of feeling was

almost...

(He stops writing. Sighs)

Pathological...

A playground on the edge of an idyllic English village. Jody

Long - fourteen, skinny, restless - is lying at the bottom of

the slide gazing at the clouds. Casey Shaw, her shy, placid

best friend, is sitting on a toddler toy, reading aloud from

a magazine.

`I've been wearing the wrong size

all my life,' said Katie. `I was

always popping out. Turns out I'm a

30GG,' she says. `Now my bras

finally fit - though Simon prefers

me without one.'

Jody checks to see if her breasts have grown. She sighs.

A woman in an upmarket apron is taking a tray of scones and

biscuits out of the aga. It's Beth Hardiment. Once pretty,

she's now mumsy and countrified.

She examines her baking, satisfied with its perfection.

Mary, the help, is doing the washing-up.

Do you think I should be reminding

them to drink enough? It's very hot

out there...

Beth - they're writers, not babies.

You run round after `em too much.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 3.

Glen walks outside, breathing in the fresh air. Beth

approaches with her tray of scones and biscuits.

Can I tempt you, Glen?

Wow, thanks.

Glen picks up a scone.

I often take something snacky down

to Nicholas at this time of day. I

know how the brain needs feeding.

How are you settling in?

Great. The last writer's retreat I

stayed at kind of froze my balls off,

you know?

Oh.

Screeching firedoors, curried

lasagne and a needy poet - from whom

I still bear the scars.

We try to keep it peaceful here;

far from the madding crowd.

Well, it's paradise.

The blight on this rural paradise is a vandalised bus shelter

near the only T-junction in the village. A twee shop, hanging

baskets and Grade II listed buildings make up the view. It's

shatteringly dull.

Casey and Jody walk up towards the bus shelter. Their boredom

is epic.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 4.

An open-topped BMW goes past and halts briefly by the

junction. The tones of Classic FM blare out, much to the

enjoyment of the middle aged couple within.

Frock horrors. This weeks top of

the shocks goes to Katie Pound in

an off the shoulder lime by

Roberto.

She looks like a bug.

(Car hoots) Wankers!

You wanna sack your stylist girl.

Bet they did that on purpose,

dressed her up like an insect.

Casey agrees. They zoom away.

Glen lowers himself into a comfy garden chair, his mouth full

of cream and jam. Behind him, Nicholas' shed.

Perfect harmony.

Nicholas is panicking down the phone.

In Ewedown? Nadia, what the ffff

are you doing there? I haven't told

her yet.

Nadia is walking up the road from the station in her high

heels, carrying an overnight bag. She is weeping into her

phone.

Why not? You keep saying you want

to be with me.

Jody and Casey are all ears.

I can't tell her just like that.

It's twenty five years; a marriage.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 4A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 5.

NO, NO DON'T!

I want to be with you. I thought

you'd be pleased...

Through the window Nicholas sees Beth leaving a scone by

Diggory, a sleeping poet in a pretentious hat.

Of course I'm pleased... Nadia, go

to the pub and stay there. I'll come

when I can.

Are you going to tell her?

Just give me a couple of hours -

He ends the call just as Beth is nearing the door - panicking

the phone back on to its holder.

Cock pie.

Beth opens the door to see Nicholas apparently hard at it.

How's the worker?

Good actually. Just about to embark

on forensics.

Well give me your pages and I'll get

started.

Nicholas hands her several pages.

Reckon I might pack it in a bit

early today. Need to think about my

blood smears. Might take a drive;

have a pint. Stir the old grey

matter up.

Who were you talking to just then?

Judy. She says the Impala contracts

should be through in a day or two.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 5A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 6.

Beth decides to try and call his bluff.

I could come with you.

What?

For a drive. I don't know when we

last went out.

Buying time by biting his scone:

This is absolutely yummy.

We could go into Hadditon, get a

meal.

Yes but. What about the guests?

Mary's got Casey to help.

But I'm supposed to be thinking,

you know about the -

You can run it by me. I'm good at

forensics.

Nicholas has run out of excuses.

Beth approaches Andy with her scones and biscuits. Nearby,

Glen is sitting back in a sun-lounger. Diggory sleeps on.

Can I tempt you, Andy?

Andy takes a scone with a wide smile.

That's Glen, our new academic. Turns

out he's working on Thomas Hardy.

Said he might have some farming

questions.

Needs an expert yokel, does he?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 6A.

Would you mind? And the writers are

eating al fresco tonight; could you

check there's no bird shit on the

seats? Sorry.

You OK?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 7.

Yes. Nicholas and I are going out

to dinner.

As she walks away, Andy glances at the shed, a look of

puzzled dislike on his face.

Glen settles back in his chair.

It's paradise...

Nicholas, dreading his predicament, is staring out at a cow's

arse. The cow starts to piss. He shuts his eyes in

desperation.

Shooting from inside the car, we pass the sign "Ewedown".

The same car drives through the village. Jody and Casey

appear from behind a wall and chuck eggs at it. They both

land on the windscreen.

Fucking bingo!

Jody and Casey run away, laughing.

The driver brakes, swerves and comes to a halt. Tamara Drewe

gets out. She's twenty eight, startlingly beautiful. She

looks around shocked, for the culprit.

The immaculate, picturesque street is deserted. Tamara takes

it in, with an expression of such distaste that it might as

well be a landfill site.

What a dump.

As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in

her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 7A.

Tamara drives up to an old farmhouse. She gets out of the car

and stands at the gate. Air of neglect; dark windows. Tamara

looks at the place as if it stirs memories. She doesn't move.

At the back of the house Tamara walks through an overgrown,

neglected garden. She peers through the back door into the

kitchen. A thin layer of dust on the surfaces; a sense of

recent abandonment.

Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over

her head. Tamara startles. It completely spooks her. She

backs away. She doesn't know what to do.

Jody and Casey are slouched on the bench at the bus stop.

Three teenage boys are doing wheelies over the T-junction.

One of them almost lands in the shop. An old lady comes out,

shoo-ing them away.

We could walk up the garage.

I'm supposed to be helping my mum

up at Stonefield.

They keep you busy.

Yeah.

You never stop, you!

Neither of them moves. The boys are yelling. Two try to put

the third head first into the bin outside the shop. Jody and

Casey are not impressed.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 8.

The writers are sitting round a table lit with tea-lights in

jars. Casey is helping her mum, Mary, an efficient local

woman in her late thirties. She wobbles the heavy serving

dishes dangerously.

It was called `From Hearth to Heath

- Doomsday and Revelation in

Victorian verse.'

What was it about?

Oh you know. Pale poets on

laudanum, dark towers and sunless

seas - a little sturm and drang in

a teacup.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 9.

At an upstairs window we can see Beth hold a dress up to

herself and then abandon the idea.

Did it sell?

Well my kind of books aren't about

sales. I mean that's not why I

write. So... no.

What are you working on next?

Upstairs, through a window, we see Beth is putting on a

blouse.

Beth is looking at herself in a cheval mirror. She's full of

hope that Nicholas will take her out - and dread that he'll

find some excuse.

Thomas Hardy.

Is there anything left to say about

that maudlin bore?

Excuse me but there is nothing dull

about Hardy. That is a

misconception.

At least you've been published. I'm

seething with envy; I'd love to be

published.

I publish myself on the internet.

Oh, do you earn money doing that?

No.

So what do you write?

Lesbian crime.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 9A.

I'm here picking up tips from the

master.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 10.

The door to the garden is open, letting in the eveing air.

Nicholas is waiting for Beth by the mirror. He is full of

unease - but can't help finding himself handsome. His phone

bleeps; a text. He reads it anxiously.

Beth, why don't I just pop out on

my own?

Beth, determined to force things, comes downstairs.

But I'm ready. Come on.

She's on her way to join him.

Is that - I mean - are you wearing

that?

Oh.

Just looks a bit... hot.

Now Beth knows she is right. She takes her jacket off,

gutted.

You know, Haddition's always packed

with pissed Londonites on a Friday. I

doubt we'll get a table anyway. Let's

do it properly next week; make an

occasion. I'm always taking you for

granted. I'm vile I know; you should

kick me really, but -

He's about to leave. Beth speaks calmly.

Who is she?

The question hangs in the air. Nicholas' smile is frozen.

What?

For a moment, he tries to find a lie.

Oh come on, Beth.

Tell me. Who?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 11.

Look, it's nothing. It's been once

or twice, that's all. Beth, it's

not anything.

Beth is raw with pain.

(her voice raised)

Who is she?!

Tess faintly hears. She stops mid chew, listening for more.

Nicholas coughs up.

Just a researcher with Radio 4.

What's her name?

Nadia, Nadia Patel.

This hits a nerve.

Patel? She's in your book.

No, no I met her when I was on

Desert Island Discs.

You put her in your book!

Just the name.

And Desert Island Discs was a year

ago.

Yes but -

Once or twice?

I was going to tell you but -

Beth utters an inchoate cry.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 11A.

Tess hears it.

Shhh!...

Beth's pained voice drifts out of the house.

BETH (O.S.)

You lying PIG!

A hush falls over the table.

Beth, I'm a ruin, I know - but I've

been in a real state about this... I

didn't want to hurt you.

Another wounded cry from Beth.

In the kitchen, Andy picks up his plate and goes.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 12.

Beth is incandescent.

How can you lie to my face?

Can we talk calmly about this?

There are people out there -

You look me in the face and LIE!

For God's sake; we're surrounded by

You BASTARD!

A thrilled intake of breath goes round the table. The writers

(with the exception of Glen, who is mortified) are poised

like scavengers, waiting for more.

Beth, we're like a pair of

compasses...

Don't you dare -

Joined solidly at the top but with

the ends able to roam, in freedom -

His phone beeps.

That's from her isn't it? Are you

keeping her waiting?

Nicholas finally snaps.

We've talked a lot about the

creative mind and we agreed that it

needs freedom to explore!

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 12A.

(leaving the house)

Take your freedom. I can't live

like this any more. It makes me

feel WORTHLESS!

Casey gawps, fascinated.

Nicholas is following Beth outside. Her agony travels through

the quiet evening air. The writers are open-mouthed.

Calm yourself down!

BETH (O.S.)

Go set up home with Patel. See if

she does your tax return.

NICHOLAS (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Will you please -

BETH (O.S.)

Do you love her??

Diggory's fork stays in mid-air. Glen is horribly fascinated.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 13.

This is pointless.

Is she young?

For heaven's sake.

IS SHE?

YES!

The guests are hanging on every word. Beth retreats back into

the house.

BETH (O.S.)

If you leave here tonight to be with

her... Don't come back.

Beth...

For a moment, she hopes he'll apologise.

You're making fools of us both.

Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the

door and hurls it, roots and all. It's a direct hit.

Liar.

Glen cringes. Beth slams the door.

Nicholas wipes soil off his glasses; brushes it off his

shirt. He realises with a sinking heart that he must pass the

writers to get to his car.

I didn't know they provided material

too.

Beth, her back to the door, is regretting her gesture.

Beth does everything for him you

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 13A.

types his manuscripts, deals with

his agent, makes his female

characters convincing.

Nicholas still at the door, listening.

She even came up with the name Dr

Inchcombe.

No wonder he's bored.

I hope she takes him to the fucking

cleaners.

Nicholas walks to his car. Silence. He roars away.

Beth comes into the kitchen. Her eyes flicker over pictures

of her daughter and Nicholas. She is in shock.

Glen is mortified.

At the end of the day, this is why

I'm glad to be single.

Beth is going through agonies of self-criticism.

BETH (V.O.)

Nadia Patel. Gazelle eyes. Tantric

sex.

We see her thoughts: An exotic clinch. Nicholas in thrall to

Nadia's confident passion.

Why would he choose me?!

The gossip flutters round the table.

Will she take him back, that's the

question.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 13B.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 14.

Alone, Beth weeps.

Nicholas is walking Nadia to his car.

Thought you weren't going to come.

I was busy. Rowing with my wife.

Where are we going?

Home.

To your farm?

A look of frustration crosses his face. He turns to her.

We could have gone on just as we

were.

But you said you wanted to be with

me...

Yes. In London. Now and then.

Nadia looks at him. The scales are beginning to fall. They

get in the car. As they drive away, Tamara's car pulls up.

She gets out of the car and takes in the pub before entering.

Tamara enters. Zoe, a buxom Australian, is behind the bar.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 15.

Big glass of rioja please. And I

need a room.

Sure, how many nights?

Don't know. Just one.

You here on business?

No. Business of a kind.

I don't mean to pry; I'm just

really nosey.

I'm from here. Sort of.

Nice place.

I keep meaning to leave but... Hard

to get away.

My mum's house is just up the road.

You're not staying with her?

She's. She died.

Have that on me. And here's your

key. Up the stairs, right in front.

You can't miss it.

Didn't think I'd see you tonight.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 16.

Bit of an atmosphere at Stonefield.

Tell me everything...

Andy shakes his head.

Marriage. Remind me never to try it.

Andy, you're just a sex object. No

one'd have you.

He grins back at her.

Tamara is in a deep bubble bath. She glances at herself in

the mirror, scrutinising her beauty. She fingers her nose.

Slowly a look of doubt steals over her - as if she's not

quite comfortable in her own skin.

Glen is eating his breakfast looking at all the Hardiment's

family memorabilia in the kitchen. Andy is eating toast.

So the Hardiments have lived here

centuries, huh?

No, `bout twenty years. Still

strangers by local standards.

Beth comes in, tense, anxious and haggard.

Andy, come and look at Ingrid. I

think she's coming into heat.

She goes out.

She's a nice lady.

Yeah, I owe her a lot.

Husband's a sleazebag, huh?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 17.

We'd say prick here actually. Or

wanker.

That's good. We might even call him

a Fuck.

That's good too.

Andy approaches Beth. She is cleaning out the hen coop with

all the frenetic energy of an abandoned wife.

This is going rotten underneath.

Shall we look at Ingrid?

It's falling apart.

I can do that. Beth...

Andy takes the shovel. Beth bites back tears.

He won't last five minutes.

Beth looks down embarrassed by (but grateful for) his

support.

Glen wanders into Beth's office. The wall in front of him is

dominated by a framed newspaper profile of Nicholas,

surrounded by framed covers of Inchcombe books. The whole

room is a shrine to Nicholas' career.

Glen is in the hall looking at Beth's prints and pictures;

old maps, wildlife and framed letters from grateful writers

who have stayed at the retreat. He stares at a print of farm

workers in the nineteenth century. Glen sighs.

GLEN (V.O.)

I know why I'm drawn to Thomas

Hardy. He writes about failure

better than anyone else. I need

this book to go well. I need a tiny

reward for my endeavours...

His stomach gurgles ominously.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 17A.

GLEN (V.O.)

I need a dump.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 18.

Glen walks down the corridor by the kitchen, to the

downstairs cloakroom; a marvellous Victorian toilet of

reassuring size. He shuts the door in relief.

Glen is on the loo. Even in this small room there are framed

photographs of Nicholas receiving awards. He looks at them in

wonder.

NICHOLAS (O.S.)

If that's the way you feel...

Nadia, I'm devastated.

Through the frosted window Glen sees Nicholas.

NICHOLAS (O.S.)

But if that's your decision, I'll

have to learn to live with it.

Beth comes in from the garden. Glen sees Nicholas quickly end

the call. For Beth's benefit:

(Into his phone)

I told you. I love my wife. Don't

ever phone me again.

Glen is shocked by this duplicity.

Beth...

No don't touch me, don't you dare.

Glen panics, realising their reunion is going to be right by

the door. He puts his hand on the flush, hoping to warn them

- too late.

I'm sorry.

Not good enough. Not any more.

I'm sorry.

You do what you like and then you're

sorry?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 18A.

NICHOLAS (O.S.)

I hate myself. I hate myself.

Where were you?

Drove her back to London. Took all

night.

You drove her home?

She was in a state.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 19.

Do you think she'll get over it?...

Nicholas shrugs. To Glen's horror, he starts to cry.

I'm sorry.

Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms,

holding each other.

I don't know why I'm like this. I

couldn't do without you.

Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He

opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks

again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on

the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again.

Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating.

He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas

releases Beth. She wipes her eyes.

I've got to go to the bottle bank.

OK... Let's talk later.

Yes. The goat's come into heat.

Has it?

I love you so much.

Me too.

Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange.

He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas'

lies.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 20.

Glen flops into a sun-lounger near Diggory.

I've just seen the Hardiments kiss

and make up.

The hat is on.

Looks like she's taking him back.

When the hat is on, it means don't

speak.

So... Peace is restored.

The sound of a burglar alarm suddenly blares over the garden.

Diggory sits up, infuriated.

Glen is following Andy down the hill from Stonefield. The

cows are too close for Glen's comfort. He hurries through.

I don't like cows. I mean really.

They exude bovine malice.

Yeah, these girls are killing

machines. They don't like Americans

either.

Very funny.

Glen and Andy are in the valley between the two farms.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 21.

It's Winnards Farm. Lady there died

a while back. Place is empty.

You think it's being robbed?

Prob'ly just kids. Nothing to do

round here except make trouble.

What if it's bad guys? Don't you

have a blunderbuss or a fowling

piece or something?

They climb up through a copse.

Glen and Andy are going up the hill towards Winnards.

Used to belong to my dad, this

place.

Really?

But it all went tits-up. Land was

flogged to a consortium and the house

was sold to Londoners; the Drewes.

So this is your ancestral pile?

Was. Born in that room up there.

He points up at the back bedroom window.

You must have been pretty resentful.

An eighteen year old Andy jumps off a stile into the lane

behind a slim, fifteen year old girl on a horse.

Hey.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 21A.

This farm's mine, big nose.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 22.

The girl kicks the horse into a trot, her nose in the air.

Andy and Glen turn the corner to the back of the house.

Tamara is up a ladder wielding a hammer at the alarm box.

Hey, what're you doing?

Tamara gives the alarm box a great whack.

Who are you??

Andy, you moron; it's me.

Andy looks more closely. A disturbing spark of recognition.

Tam?... Hardly recognise you.

Another whack. The noise becomes a high-pitched squeal.

You won't do it that way.

Then help me!

Andy turns the alarm off. Tamara enters the dusty kitchen.

Used to do bits of work for your mum.

Been keeping an eye on the place

since she died.

What sort of work, graphics?

I do horticulture now.

You're a gardener?

Andy says nothing. He stares at her nose. Glen has come in.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 23.

This is a great old house.

Would you like to buy it?

I'm not really the property-owning

kind. Prefer my life to fit into hand

luggage.

That's why you're back, to flog it?

Yes.

Make a nice second home for some

banker wankers.

Andy if you want it, why don't you

make me an offer?

Because sadly I'm still prey to the

economic forces that threw the

peasant classes off the land.

Unlucky.

Tamara opens a cupboard. It's full of empty wine bottles.

Tam.

Their eyes meet.

What the fuck have you done to

yourself?

Tamara's face falls.

Glen and Andy are walking back. Andy is brooding.

She's completely different.

How was she before? What's the

story?...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 24.

There isn't one.

Come on.

Was nothing. Decade ago. Just a

teenage thing.

Tamara pulling down her pants; Andy unbuttoning his jeans.

She jumps up on the worktable, pushing a stack of turnips out

of the way. They kiss passionately.

You should find someone you're in

love with.

You stupid prick.

Andy looks at her. She is sincere.

You saying you love me, frosty tits?

You first.

You say it; You're the girl.

Fuck off.

She kisses him. As they start to make love:

I love you. Fuck off. I love you.

Glen looks over at Andy, interrupting his thoughts.

Romeo and Juliet, huh?

Andy carries on down the hill, shaking his head.

Tamara is watching Andy walk away with Glen. Her eyes follow

him curiously - then she firmly turns her back.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 24A.

Tamara rips a bin liner off the roll and shakes it out.

She takes a deep breath. She opens the cupboard and begins to

bin the distressing mountain of empty wine bottles.

Beth is standing at the hedge looking down at the valley with

Nicholas at her side.

Thinking of the first time we saw

this place...

You've made it a wonderful home

Beth.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 25.

Not wonderful enough.

She starts to walk away. Nicholas holds her back.

If you can't put this behind you,

then we're stuck.

Well I'd better sort myself out then.

What has to happen? I am sorry -

Beth brings her arm up to push him away. Nicholas catches it;

draws her to him. He kisses her insistently. Beth's

resistance diminishes. Soon it has gone. We begin to see the

depth of Beth's physical love for him.

At that moment, Glen walks round the corner. He tries to

backtrack, mortified by his intrusion on their passion. Too

late. They part. Nicholas turns away in frustration.

Just taking the air.

Flustered, he knocks into a tub of lobelias. Beth and

Nicholas remain. The moment between them is gone. Round the

corner, Glen is cringing.

Jody and Casey are reading a celebrity magazine.

Would you do him?

No.

What about him?

He's gay, you dobbin.

So?

They turn to a big spread on a band called Swipe.

Swipe.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 26.

Ben Sergeant...

I'd walk through fire to do him.

The drummer?

He's not just the drummer. He writes

the lyrics; it's his band. He's the

fucking genius, not Steve Culley or

any of these wankers. It's Ben.

OK. I'd do Ben.

I wanna be her, in that dress with

him licking my teapot lids.

Yeah... me too.

Casey is still carrying this image as she serves a tray of

nibbles on the patio. She stands among the writers, watching

a fly get caught in one of the vol-au-vents.

People talk about the muscularity in

prose. I want a similar muscularity

in my verse. I don't want a poetry

that's flabby or obese - that's why I

adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes:

Diggory picks the vol-au-vent up and without looking, puts it

in his mouth. Casey moves over to Nicholas and Glen.

ABB ACC DEE D. They give you the

armature, the beating heart, the

nerve ends...

So has the muse shone on you, Greg?

I've been pretty distracted. Most

recently by those delicious cookie

things that Beth brought round this

afternoon.

Oh yes. Of course we call them

biscuits here.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 26A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 27.

Wow, that's scary. Ten pages; how

do you do that?

Well, Greg -

I wouldn't presume to give an

academic tips.

Matter of fact I read one of your

books. Another distraction but I

thought it was decent stuff.

Well.

How do I do it? I just get on with

it, Greg.

`We call them biscuits, here.'

To the muse, however you find her.

Who's that?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 28.

That's Tamara Drewe.

No it isn't.

I met her with Andy.

Good God. What's happened to her?

She's had a nose job, Dad.

She's completely different.

That's what Andy said.

Poor Tamara. Such a sad girl. She

used to come and help you wash the

car, didn't she Nicholas? I think

she liked a bit of family after her

dad left.

Is that Tamara Drewe who writes the

column in one of the Sundays?

Used to. Writes for the Independent

now.

She spent weeks going on about her

nose job. Smart way to pay for it I

suppose. Was her old one an awful

conk?

Yes.

She's poured herself into those

shorts. I hope they don't give her

thrush.

What's the etiquette with nose

jobs? Do we mention it, or...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 28A.

Hello. Sorry to intrude.

Hey, Tamara.

Poppy, how are you?

Love your new hooter.

Thanks. It isn't actually new; just

smaller...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 29.

At last Beth remembers her manners.

Tamara, so sorry about your mum.

Thank you...

Are you staying down for a while?

I'll have to. There's so much to be

done.

You must let us know if we can help.

Actually, I was going to ask if you

could spare a pair of strong arms.

I've got a skip coming tomorrow and -

Nicholas? -

Nicholas is opening another bottle of prosecco. It pops its

cork over his trousers. He mutters a swear word.

I'm available. I do skips.

I... No.

Well thank you. You're very kind...

Is Andy around at all?

Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers.

Oh, I can't spare Andy. He's making

a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons.

Tamara and Glen are carrying junk out to a skip. Tamara is in

big boots and a slightly more practical pair of shorts.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 30.

Beth is preparing lunch, talking to Poppy. Nicholas is going

through his typed-up manuscript; not really listening.

She's had the writers down there

helping her all day. I hope she

realises they're here to work...

Can't believe what a difference

her nose makes.

Well I think it's a mistake; taken

away all her character.

Come on; she looks ten times

better.

Huh.

And she knows it. I found those

shorts really irritating. Going

around with half her bum hanging

out. I mean, why?

To annoy people like you. Might get a

pair myself.

Of course you won't.

Why not?

Because you're not desperate, are

you? Always something a bit

desperate about Tamara Drewe.

Beth looks at him puzzled as he works on.

Tamara and Glen are having a rest.

So why did you change your face?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 30A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31.

Would it work for me?

Maybe; if you did the wrinkles too.

Oh, you're just coming on to me...

Tamara laughs. She starts work again.

In your column, you write about

yourself... Does that come easily?

No... But it feels right. My first

novel's definitely going to be

autobiographical.

Your first novel? You're going to

dash one off just like that?

Ideally, I'd like to make it into

fiction before I'm thirty.

And then maybe a swimwear collection,

a chat show, a pasta sauce range?

What?

Life sure is easy for the beautiful.

You know before I got the nose job

I had no trouble getting taken

seriously. Maybe, when they removed

that bit of cartilage, they pulled

my brain out by mistake - what do

you think?

Glen smiles, won over.

Glen is coming from the bar with a pint for Andy and a half

for himself. He has just been served by Zoe.

She's single, man.

Andy looks over at Zoe.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 32.

I'm a pedigree loser. I had a

graphics business; went bust. And

then with my great business acumen

I invested in a polytunnel full of

ganja.

Wow. How'd that go?

Made a tit of myself. Spent about

six years stoned out of my box and

I'm only just getting it back

together. Besides, even if I was

the last man in the world, Tamara

Drewe wouldn't have me.

Why not?

I dumped her.

Oh, you are a loser.

I was twenty. My mates thought I

was cradle snatching... And they

used to call her Beaky.

Tamara in her school uniform, is gutted.

Beaky?...

We see her stricken face as she turns away. Then she turns

back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood.

Glen is preparing to leave.

You told her the truth... The time

might come when she respects that.

Andy, as your love guru, I suggest

you ask Tamara for a date. But take a

shower first, OK?

Piss off, Glen.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33.

Tamara is in her shorts and boots, chucking empty bottles and

old saucepans into the skip, like an Amazon.

Nicholas is at the hedge, looking down the valley towards

Winnards Farm. He is watching Tamara like a hawk - as if he

can't quite believe what he is seeing.

Nicholas and Tamara are polishing Nicholas' car.

Boys know nothing.

Nicholas looks up at her, smiles indulgently. Tamara stops

work.

I've been reading `Inchcombe's

Dose.'

Have you?

The bit where Doctor Inchcombe

finds himself having thoughts about

the dead guy's daughter.

Tamara walks around the car, bringing her polishing cloth

closer to his.

You describe her light smattering

of freckles and her striking

profile. So...

She turns her head.

Who did you base her on?

What?

Have you noticed me?

Nicholas looks at her in surprise.

Because I've noticed you...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33A.

Think it's time you went.

You're making yourself ridiculous.

Nicholarse.

Oh, grow up.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 34.

Nicholas is still staring at Tamara, who is jumping on the

stuff in the skip. Glen is strolling up the hill from the

pub. He follows Nicholas' gaze.

A man can dream, huh?

Nicholas looks at him affronted - as if he doesn't know what

he's talking about.

Tamara, hot and dirty, runs up the stairs with her roll of

bin liners. She opens the door to her mother's bedroom.

She is completely unprepared for it. A neat, womanly room

covered in photographs of Tamara as a child, teen and young

woman. On the dressing table is a lipstick; the lid lying

next to it as if it has just been used. Tamara picks it up.

She sits, suddenly exhausted. For the first time, she looks

lost.

Tamara still looks slightly shaken as she walks up to Andy.

He is watching Ingrid meet Darcy, a billy goat.

Go on Ingrid; have some kids.

Pretty direct isn't he? He's not

even bought her a coke.

Andy turns. Sees her.

And he stinks.

She doesn't mind; it's like Lynx to

her. If she's ready she'll stand for

him, if not she won't.

That's disturbing human.

Refreshing basic.

Darcy is up and at it.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 35.

Thought you'd have gone back to

London by now.

I wish. Looks like I'm stuck here for

a while. Actually, I've got a

proposition for you.

We should go for a drink

sometime, Tam. You know, for old

times sake.

So we can reminisce about how I

smashed your nose?

You didn't smash it.

Yes I did.

It just bled.

I've got to do the house up before I

sell it. It looks like an eighties

timewarp. Would you like the job?

Painting it and tidying the garden?

Good hourly rate.

It can't be easy down there, Tam.

What d'you mean?

All the memories and stuff. Your

mum...

I'm fine.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 35A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 36.

Jesus Christ, the goats are giving

OK it's bollocks -

That's very sweet of you Andy -

Of course you wouldn't want to

fraternise with your gardener.

So... is that a yes?

Andy doesn't reply.

Come on, goat whisperer - I thought

I'd be doing you a favour. I thought

you needed the work.

It's all over with Ingrid and Darcy.

She's had a shit time but she'll

still call him. He'll lose her

number. He won't ring her back...

Andy's face cracks into a smile. He is won over.

Glen types a sentence. He reads it. He deletes. He stares at

the blank page. It stares back at him.

No.

He stands. He paces. He sits.

Just write, you numbskull. You

moron, you dumb fuck - write!

Glen is passing Beth's office. She's working through a stack

of fan mail. She smiles when she sees him.

How's Thomas Hardy?

Glen unburdens himself.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 36A.

I'm wasting my sabbatical.

Oh dear.

I've been working on this book

forever; why can't I finish it? I'm

two years past my delivery date and

Fantail could ask for their

chickenshit advance back. I can't

write. I'm fucking constipated.

It's a disaster.

Crikey.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 37.

Is this all his fan mail?

I do a couple of sessions a week,

to keep on top of it. Pretty good

at forging Nick's signature.

Glen looks awed - and defeated.

Would you like me to read it?

You'd do that?

Be glad to. If you think it would

help.

Beth suddenly sees Andy out of the window. He's leaving.

Sorry Glen. Just need Andy -

Barging in on you; What an idiot.

Beth catches up with Andy.

If you're going into Hadditon -

we're really low on chicken feed.

I'll get it tomorrow. I'm on my way

down to Winnards. Doing one or two

jobs for Tamara.

She's got you helping her too?

Just painting, decorating, sorting

the garden.

Beth is quite put out.

Andy, that sounds like a lot. I

need you here.

I can easily do both.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 37A.

As long as you're not working for

her in the hours that I pay you.

Sure, Beth. I won't rip you off.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 38.

He walks on, leaving Beth feeling very uncomfortable - and

somehow slightly bereft.

Andy comes in. He shouts into the house.

Tam? Got some colour charts for you

to see.

He sets out all the colours charts and plans he has been

working on. Tamara appears. She is dressed to kill.

What would you choose for in here?

Well... I'd have this one. And then

upstairs in the bedroom -

OK.

She starts gathering her things.

So what d'you have to do to get a

cup of tea round here?

Make it.

Tea bags. Sugar. Fridge.

I'm off to work.

Andy stares. Suddenly Tamara is no longer just a blast from

the past. He sees a future - a future that he wants. He

slowly smiles back - but she's already striding away.

Pounding rock music, slightly distorted by distance. Jody and

Casey are trying to get in over the boundary fence. A

security guard is already running towards them.

This is our village. Our fucking

field.

OUT!

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 39.

COME ON YOU BASTARD LET US IN!

Jody is ready for a fight but Casey pulls her back.

Beth is tending to Ingrid - making sure she's not scared by

the noise. Ingrid looks as if she couldn't give a damn. Over

by the barn she sees Glen, unaware that he's being watched,

breaking out of a mournful walk to groove to the music. She

smiles.

At the other end of the farm, Nicholas is staring over the

hedge with tissue paper ear-plugs. He pretends his arm is a

rifle, like a little boy. He aims at the cows. He fires.

Swipe are playing; bit like The Libertines in their prime.

There is one girl in the band, bass guitarist Fran Redford.

The drummer, Ben Sergeant, is also vocals. The lead singer,

Steve Culley, is mixed-race; confident and charismatic.

He is getting very up-close and personal with Fran. Ben is

getting more and more furious.

In the wings, we see Tamara talking to a publicist, trying to

make herself heard above the roar of the music. She is

pointing at Steve and Fran. The publicist nods.

Suddenly Ben leaps up and takes hold of Steve, pulling him

away from Fran. There is a scuffle, Fran trying to separate

the boys. Ben takes a microphone.

Sorry people. I resign. Swipe is no

more. Steve Culley is a cunt.

Ben storms off the stage. The audience are in uproar.

Ben! Ben! What's happening?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 40.

He's seeing Fran. I won't work with

that tosser again.

Steve! Don't!

Steve is coming into the wings. He punches Ben.

You fucking baby.

Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the

ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name.

Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara.

Hello. I'm Tamara Drewe.

What?

I'm supposed to be interviewing you

- for the Independent.

She smiles sweetly, smoothing his hair.

It was scheduled for later but

maybe now's a better time...

Jody, Casey and the boys are sharing a bottle of cider.

They should let us in free.

Too right. They come here, drink our

water, use our fields, they leave

all their crap in our drains -

Tamara's car sweeps past with the roof down. It is closely

followed by a bright yellow Porsche. Ben is driving and his

boxer dog, Boss, is in the passenger seat. Jody clocks him.

Ben! Ben!

She jumps up and down in the road with both arms waving.

What are you doing?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 40A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 41.

Jody and Casey scream with delight, chasing the car.

Ben skids his Porsche to a halt right next to Tamara's car.

He jumps out. Boss follows. Tamara is walking towards the

door. The distant festival is still audible. Tamara backs

towards the door, with Ben inches away.

That's Boss.

Hi Boss.

You're not allergic are you?

To indie drummers? Maybe. Who are

your influences, Ben?

Everyone asks that. This your place?

I'm selling. D'you want it?

No, I want something else.

Tamara grins. Jody and Casey arrive at the brow of the hill,

breathless. They see Ben pin Tamara against the door.

Who the fuck's she?

I seen her up at Stonefield. She's

got a nose made of plastic.

How come she gets Ben? I've loved

him since March.

Just as Ben's about to kiss her, Tamara coolly opens the door

and draws him into the house.

Wow...

Jody is gutted; feeling the full injustice of her life.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 42.

Tamara leads Ben to the kitchen. The hall has been stripped.

Would you like a beer?

Yep. Maureen Tucker.

Who?

Tamara opens the fridge. Ben is inches away. He still hasn't

kissed her and he's just about to.

Moe Tucker, with the Velvets. Five

foot nothing. Used to stand up to

play. Put the snare drum on its side

and hit it with mallets. Mentalist.

You write all the songs; that's

pretty rare for a drummer.

Everything you've ever heard about

drummers is total shit.

You mean you don't spontaneously

combust?

Only sometimes.

She goes in to kiss him. But Ben grabs a pair of chopsticks

from a utensils jar. He starts to play around Tamara, hitting

the surfaces, the shelves and everything on them; a brilliant

rhythm. He gets closer and closer. Tamara is utterly

mesmerised. Ben stops. He still doesn't kiss her.

Any more questions?

Tamara is speechless. He kisses her.

Andy is walking in the copse up to Tamara's. He spots a

couple of wild mushrooms and picks them. In the distance he

sees Glen bending and stretching. A cow is looking at him

over the fence. Glen sees it and startles.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 43.

The sight makes Andy smile. He carries on towards Winnards

Farm in high spirits.

Andy comes up to the house. He sees the yellow Porsche; then

a large boxer dog sitting by the front garden. It starts

barking at him. Andy calms him right down.

Hey, hey - who are you, mate -

lost, are you?

Andy strokes Boss.

Andy takes a key from under a flower pot.

Andy opens the kitchen door.

Tam? You want breakfast?

Boss bounds inside and disappears.

Andy is puzzled. He steps into the hall.

Do you know about this dog, Tam -

He notices two half-drunk beers. He wanders into the hall. He

sees Ben's boots and most of Tamara's clothes, abandoned. The

unmistakable moans of lovemaking are coming from Tamara's

room.

He turns on his heels, pained.

Andy strides back across the field, chucking the mushrooms in

the mud on his way.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 43A.

Postcard of Winnards Farm. The exterior is half-decorated.

Two cars parked - Tamara's and the yellow Porsche, which

looks more like a permanent fixture. The garden has been

cleared and dug, ready to plant.

Andy is stoking a bonfire. He is smouldering like the embers.

He gives the yellow Porsche an angry look.

Nicholas and Glen are both walking in the field. They pass

each other, each managing a painful smile.

How goes the opus?

Fine Nicholas, just fine...

Their smiles fade. Nicholas descending into deep gloom, Glen

into deep anxiety.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 44.

Beth is mending the engine of her huge mower. Glen, now

wearing a scarf, is sitting on the seat watching her work.

It's his most obscure novel `The Well-

Beloved'. Most people have never even

heard of it. About this guy of twenty

who falls in love with a beautiful

young woman. Then when he's forty, he

meets the woman's daughter and he

falls in love with her. And finally,

when he's sixty he meets the

Oh he doesn't.

Yeah. Falls in mystical love. Hardy

was like that in his life, too. Even

as he aged, he only had eyes for

young women. Like, in one essential

way he never grew up.

In his trousers.

He was still at it in his eighties.

You know? Snow on the rooftop but

fire in the cellar...

Why won't it come for you Glen?

The way you talk about it's so

engaging.

Yeah but there's an academic style,

you know?

Who are you writing for? Who's your

ideal reader?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 45.

Glen can't answer.

Because if you wrote the way you

spoke... it would make me want to

read Hardy.

Really?

Yes. If you wrote like you were

talking to a friend... Pass me that

thing.

Glen passes it, looking at Beth as she tightens a bolt.

Try it now.

Glen turns the key. The engine starts. Glen starts to drive

the mower, delighted. Beth watches him, amused.

A cosy dinner for all the writers - more ladies in their

forties and fifties. Nicholas is topping up his glass.

I simply pander to popular taste.

Oh your books are far more than that.

Just airport fodder...

Glen at the foot of the table, finds this modesty rich.

Your prose is so vivid. And Inchcombe

- for all his flaws - is a man with

total integrity.

Who did you base him on, Nicholas?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 46.

My books don't say anything

profound. I can't pretend to be an

intellectual - not like Glen here,

illuminating our ignorance with his

critical glow - but I do love prose.

And I think I can turn a reasonable

story.

Excuse me.

Let me help.

They need dusting with this.

I went to my room and I wrote for

three hours. The time just

vanished.

That's great, that's brilliant.

I feel like a man who's just passed

a gargantuan stool.

Super. Sprig of mint on the top.

The real secret of being a writer

is learning how to lie.

Because that's what storytellers

are. Thieves and liars...

(as he serves Nicholas)

`The basis of all excellence is

truth.' Samuel Johnson.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 46A.

The room - her mother's - is empty except for a mattress on

the floor, clothes rail, designer bean bag and desk.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 47.

Tamara is sitting at it, tapping away on her PC, almost

pained with concentration. Ben is bored.

Are you done yet?

I'm just starting something.

That poxy column? Can't it wait?

Not the column. Just stuff coming

out. Don't want to stop it.

Do it later. Play with me.

Ben strums his guitar, determined to get her attention.

She is such fun she's sexy

And she lives on an old farm

But something gnaws away at me

It's causing me real harm.

Tamara, what can you do with it?

What can you do with her name?

Its stands there lonely and

rhymeless It's driving me nearly

insane.

Tamara the lovely, the ultimate,

dazzling girl,

Make me pasta carbonara,

Cos I'm ravenous Tamara,

Then shag me wearing your tiara...

Tamara is delighted. She leaps on him.

Andy is planting a bed. Ben's boxer dog is digging up work

he's just done. Andy swears at him under his breath.

BEN (O.S.)

Hey - Andy?

Andy looks up. Ben is at the bedroom window, naked.

Can you let my dog in? Thanks mate.

Jody and Casey watch from behind the hedge as Andy angrily

goes to let the dog in.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 48.

He must like kissing plastic.

He doesn't love her. He's just on

the rebound from losing Fran;

numbing his pain with loads of

empty, rampant sex. What he really

needs...

Is a fifteen year old from Ewedown.

So? Stranger things happen. He's

only ten years older and that's

nothing. If he met me, if he just

met me...

It'd be love, right?

Yeah.

But I'd settle for sex.

Beth is feeding the hens.

Coo-er... In your parents' bedroom?

Still I suppose being an

exhibitionist is part of his job -

strutting about on stage.

He doesn't strut; he's a drummer.

He sits on his arse.

Very good-looking, isn't he? Poppy

You-Tubed him and we both got quite

hot and bothered. Is that his car -

the yellow Porsche?

Yep.

Bit brash, vrooming through the

village... But fancy our Tamara

bagging a bone fide rock star. She

was such an ugly duckling. She must

be thrilled to bits.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 48A.

Andy can't listen to any more.

Andy peers through the door. Zoe is setting tables. He

knocks. Zoe let's him in.

We're not open for another hour.

Good.

Andy and Zoe are in the near-darkness, making love against

the wall.

Andy is lying on one of the seats, his head on Zoe's lap.

I'm going to move on soon, Andy.

No way...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 49.

Don't know if I can stick a winter

here. The way the light disappears;

it's doing me in. I'm a blue sky

girl. Got to have some warmth.

Andy just looks up at her, smiling his understanding.

We all need a bit of that, don't we.

Boss is outside, sniffing round the front door. Sounds of the

end of an epic shag from the upstairs window. He sits, bored.

He hears the noise of crows in the field.

He is off like a shot.

Boss is having the time of his life chasing the cows. Penny

Upminister, an uppercrust landowner in a horrible coat is

trying to catch him.

The whole herd is now on the rampage, Boss in pursuit, Penny

bringing up the rear. Nicholas sees them heading straight for

his shed.

Fuck Soup.

Tamara is opening a Tiffany's box. There is a ring inside it.

She looks at Ben, almost in disbelief. Boss can be heard,

barks fading in the distance.

What's this?

What's it look like?

Ben... For which finger?

Whatever one you like. That's a

nice one. Why not put it on that?

He's pointing to her ring finger. Tamara is moved.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 49A.

Penny Upminister has managed to get Boss on a bit of rope.

She is handing him over to Beth at the top of the field.

Those girls could have aborted!

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 50.

Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out.

Nicholas is approaching.

It beats me why you people want to

live in the country. You've got no

sense of responsibility.

It's not our dog!

Hello, Penny. How's tricks?

Penny is suddenly all coy.

Oh - Nicholas...

You're looking great. Terrific coat.

What, this old thing?

You look like royalty.

(laughs, delighted)

Well, I try... Can't wait for your

next book. Inchcombe's such a sauce-

pot. Giles is always says `What are

you reading Penny? You've got steam

coming out of your ears...'

She laughs like a drain. Nicholas joins in. Beth is striding

away with the dog, infuriated.

Ben has put a ring on Tamara's finger.

So what's the ring saying, Ben?

It's saying hello I'm a ring. Will

you marry me?

Tamara looks at him, searchingly.

What's up?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 50A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 51.

That you were in love with me.

The ring says I'm platinum with a

long guarantee. So give me a reply.

Tamara is grinning from ear to ear.

You're the best fun in the world.

I'd love to marry you.

She throws her arms around his neck.

Can I say it then?

Say what?

I love you.

Tamara holds him, profoundly affected. Something akin to fear

flickers across Ben's eyes. The phone rings.

What? She's being proposed to.

Ben's Porsche skids to a halt, music blaring. Diggory is

looking on in irate astonishment. The hat is on.

Shhh! There are writers here, trying

to write.

Beth is in the hen enclosure, a hen in her arms.

This is a Buff Orpington. She's

looking a bit peaky today. Not a

great layer but she's very

decorative.

Beth puts down the hen.

We're fully organic - but I like to

think that our champion product is

the written word.

Nicholas approaches, his hand held out, heartily.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 52.

The famous Ben - Swipe, eh?

Swipe's over. Thought the whole

world knew that.

It wasn't on Newsnight, no.

Ben is engaged to Tamara. Isn't

that lovely? He'd just popped the

question when I rang.

She said yes?

We're delighted for you both.

Why's he on a chain?

He was out of control.

How'd you like to be chained up?

He was chasing livestock. He

could've got shot.

They shoot him; I'll fucking shoot

them.

I think the word is gobshite.

I hope he makes her happy. It's hard

for girls when their dads walk out.

Gives them bad taste in men.

What's that supposed to mean?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 53.

Just saying her father left when she

was a girl and -

That is ten pence psychology! You

don't know what you're talking

about, do you?

He walks away. Beth is completely taken aback.

Nicholas, wearing a woolly hat and scarf, is writing.

NICHOLAS (V.O.)

Patel's eyes were open, eloquent in

death...

He looks up. In the distance, he can just see Tamara talking

to Andy in the garden at Winnards Farm.

Nicholas opens his desk. He finds a pair of old binoculars.

He focuses them on Tamara. She holds out her hand with the

ring on it. Andy has his arms wrapped around himself, his

shoulders hunched. He nods, affecting congratulations.

Nicholas tries to close in on Tamara. But she turns and goes

indoors. Also the yellow Porsche arrives. Nicholas puts the

binoculars down.

NICHOLAS (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He knelt down - forensics be damned -

and closed her eyes, forever.

Tamara is turning the ring around her finger.

`Mai Buff Orpingtons. Oh, the

written word. That's what the

country does to you; turns you into

one. What's up?

It's a shame it doesn't fit. Perhaps

you should have taken one of mine

with you when you went to buy it.

Yeah but I didn't know you then.

So... when did you buy it?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 54.

Ben realises his mistake. Tamara laughs, shocked.

Was this for someone else?

Ben shrugs, not wanting to admit. The truth dawns.

You gave it to Fran didn't you?

So? It's yours now. She never wore

it. She didn't want it.

You asked her to marry you...?

It was a gesture, OK, when she

started seeing Steve. Backfired,

anyway. Look, I love you now.

Tamara doesn't believe him. She is devastated.

It's not the ring that matters. I

mean fuck the ring. It's just a

consumerist piece of zinc. What

matters is I want to marry you.

Do you?

Yeah. With my whole heart. And all

the other stuff. Like my brain and my

entrails and my whatever, pancreas.

It all wants to marry you.

He hugs her, starts kissing her but Tamara hardly responds.

Nicholas is staring out at the darkness. Beth is organising

things around him.

She wondered if you had a delivery

date in mind. I told her Easterish.

Mind that cocoa, it's hot.

Across at Winnards, Tamara's bedroom light comes on. For a

moment, she gazes out. Nicholas gazes back.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 55.

There's a few invites; I'll pop them

there. Just tick the ones you want

to go to.

Ben wraps his arms lovingly around Tamara. She draws the

curtains as he pulls her away.

And Tim wants to know if you'll do

your Christmas signing in Hadditon. I

know he's always ungrateful but I

think it's so important to keep these

little bookshops open, don't you?

Uh huh.

Beth is on her way out. She turns and kisses him.

Come in soon, my love.

Nicholas stares out into the darkness. He isn't working. He

isn't doing anything.

From the field, Nicholas is an ageing, isolated figure in a

tiny pool of light.

Mud, frost and gloom add to the sense of neglect. Jody is

smoking. Casey is eating Pringles. They share a magazine.

Look at that cellulite...

She been sitting on a bead car-seat

or what?

Casey turns a page.

`Her latest tattoo count was nine,

including a Sumatran tiger and

`Eternity' written in Sanskrit.'

She'll be getting a barcode done

next. Right across there.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 55A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 56.

Jody chucks her fag-end into the bin.

The bin is on fire. Casey chucks in the Pringles box. They

warm their hands, watching one of the boys wheelie his bike

and fall off right into a freezing puddle. Casey giggles.

That Ryan...

What a dick.

I think he's cute.

No you don't. Would you snog him?

Maybe.

Be like having a slug in your mouth.

Ben's yellow Porsche speeds right through the puddle, further

soaking Ryan. Ben and Tamara are both wearing designer shades

despite the gloom; Boss in the back.

Jody and Casey are both on their feet in a second.

Ben! Ben!

BEN!!!

Wankers.

Ben gives them a grin and a wave. Jody's heart soars.

Come on.

Jody is outside the back door. She lifts a flowerpot and

takes the key from underneath.

She keeps this here for Andy.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 56A.

What if she's got an alarm?

Soon find out.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 57.

What if they come back?

If you're too chicken, go home.

The girls wander in, awed. Jody turns and grins, her eyes

like a cat's.

Nicholas is doing a book signing. There's a good crowd.

Is that Claire with an `i'?

Beth has a tray of mince pies. Glen is at her side.

What about you, Glen? Where will you

be?

In London with a collection of spare

academics. I guess we'll be decking

the halls in our own erudite way.

I'll miss our chats.

I've been in a state of writerly

bliss these last weeks. I hope I

get to come back.

Me too. We'd love to have you.

Glen doesn't want Beth to move away.

You know, this is the best mince pie

I've ever had.

Oh?

If it was possible to have an orgasm

from mere food, this mince pie would

do it.

Golly.

She moves away. Glen heads for the wine, kicking himself.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 58.

What the fuck are we doing here?

It's kind of research; I want to

write about them. They're funny, Ben -

come on.

The 2001 was the best. Someone just

bought my last three cases...

So I've got her this gorgeous

Rajastani gagara skirt...

Besides, I want to show you off.

What am I - arm candy?

More like arm fungus with that face

on. Ben, meet Glen. Glen, meet Ben,

my fiance.

You're getting married?

Uh huh.

OK. Beautiful dress, magazine

photoshoot - everything the

aspiring novelist needs.

I knew you'd be pleased.

Have a mince pie.

Can we get out of here?

Wait.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 58A.

In Field of Tares, you made Fred a

corporal. But there's no such thing

in the Royal Artillery. They call

them bombardiers.

Oh, thank you for that...

Sorry.

Could you do it for Ben? He's my

fiance. We're getting married in

the summer.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 59.

So I hear. You have my heartiest

commiserations, Tara.

He hands her the book dismissively. Tamara is smarting.

Well merry Christmas. Nicholarse.

She turns away.

Jody sniffs Ben's aftershave, longingly. Casey plucks his

guitar. They listen to the note in hushed awe.

Jody puts her foot into one of Tamara's killer stilettos. She

picks up Ben's drumsticks and kisses them, reverently.

We gotta live the dream, Casey.

Live the dream...

Jody and Casey jump up and down on the unmade bed. Jody pulls

a black T-shirt from under a pillow. She holds it to her

face.

Ben...

Casey is looking out of the window. The yellow Porsche is

heading up the lane.

Omigod!

A wild panic. They put things back where they found them.

Go! Go! Go!

She nicks the T-shirt.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 60.

The girls sprint down the stairs and out.

They dive behind a bush as the car pulls in. They lie on the

ground splitting their sides with hushed laughter, as Ben and

Tamara disappear into the house.

Tamara and Ben are having a heated discussion.

Why don't you sell it like you keep

saying?

Because... I've started writing.

You can write anywhere.

But this is proper. Not just stuff

for the paper. 'It's about my teens -

and is working for me here.

Well it might be memory lane for you

but it's doing my fucking head in. I

want London. I want some Urban, OK?

Are you with me or what? Cos I've had

it with this place.

Tamara is hurt - and deeply disappointed.

Of course I'm with you...

It's drab. It's depressing. And every

time I look out of the window I see

Andy's arse - what's that about?

Andy is bending down, the top of his arse peeking out in the

morning sun. Ben stares at it with distaste. Andy is plucking

a goose, putting all his frustration into it.

We're leaving. Thank God.

Andy looks at him.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 61.

Tamara says you sell Christmas geese.

Yep.

Can I have one?

Right now?

Yeah.

That one's spare.

Is that a goose?

You can take it now if you like.

Oh come off it.

What?

It's fucking alive.

Oh, you want it from Tesco, all

plucked and headless sitting on a

bandage.

How d'you do it then?

Gently put it's head down there; then

quick in the skull with an air rifle.

Pluck it while it's warm, little pot

to catch all the blood -

Do you enjoy doing that?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 61A.

No, but in my low wage economy, this

flock's worth a lot.

You're a sick fuck, Andy.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 62.

Grow up.

What did you say?

Andy stands. He's at least two inches taller than Ben.

I said grow up, little drummer boy.

Ben thinks about it. He walks away. Glen appears with his

suitcase on wheels containing most of his worldly goods.

Tamara rang me this morning. Said

to finish the house. It goes on the

market in the spring and that's it;

over.

Why does the asshole always get the

girl?

He stands with Andy; comrades. Andy slaps him on the back.

Come on. Or you'll miss that train.

Snow falling outside. Jody and Casey are in school uniform.

Jody curled up on the bed; Casey at Tamara's PC. The room has

been redecorated.

It won't be just a shag, Case. It'll

be an event. I'll be wearing like a

gossamer slip with a bra bit; Prada.

Or like a filmy, linen shirt, and...

We see Jody's thought bubble. Ben is leaning against the door

frame, giving her a smouldering look.

JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He'll be wearing a black T-shirt all

taut over his buff bod and underneath

Calvin Klein Boxers, black.

Jody moves towards Ben. He buries his face in her neck as if

he's found the love of his life.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 62A.

JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 63.

Ben lifts Jody on to the bed. They marvel at each other. He

bends down to kiss her.

JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And he tries to stop himself but I'm

a vision and he gets drawn into my

power and it'll be like Uhhh... But

also respectful. And my `V' plates

will melt into nothing.

She looks up. Casey is reading at the PC.

Are you listening?

I like this.

What?

There's this bit right, where her dad

takes her for dinner and she thinks

it's some big treat but what he's

doing, right, is telling her he's

leaving them. And she, right, she's

gutted and she yaks all her food into

a napkin and puts it on his plate.

So?

It's painful. But funny. It's about

her; Plastic Fantastic. She's sad,

Jode.

Sad? She's a lucky cunt.

Outside the farm the snow falls.

Tamara is trying to write. Ben is playing his drum kit, high

as a kite. The noise is deafening. Tamara sits back, looking

around the boyish pad. It feels alien. The phone rings.

Andy is on the phone, examining the decrepit shed. Nothing

has changed in a decade.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 63A.

TAMARA (V.0)

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 64.

FARM.

Tamara takes the phone out onto the balcony to escape the

noise. She slowly smiles, knowing what he's thinking.

I don't know; the shed... What do

you think?

I recommend preserving it.

Really?

Always useful, a good shed.

Well then. Keep it...

Andy puts the phone down, grinning. Tamara is grinning too,

sharing the same memory.

Beth is decorating a little pink valentine cake. She's on the

phone to Nicholas.

Really? Oh dear...

NICHOLAS (V.O.)

Yes, We thought it'd be a good

opportunity to catch up.

Couldn't you do it another day?

Nicholas is standing by the window on his phone.

NICHOLAS (V.O.)

Beth, you know what it's like.

Judy's off to New York tomorrow. We

can never find a window. Should be

home around ten.

He puts the phone down.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 64A.

Beth looks at the cake. It says To My Valentine in piped

lettering around the edge. She picks up her icing bag, full

of unease.

In the middle of the cake she ices a big question mark. Then

she quickly looks up a number and dials.

Hello, Judy?

Judy and Nicholas are eating their starters.

Beth, hello love.

I'm so sorry, I think Nicholas has

got his phone turned off and um -

He's right here. I'll put him on.

Oh - actually - don't worry - I've

just found it.

Beth puts the phone down, biting her lip. She is relieved,

ashamed and ultimately not reassured. She looks to camera.

Nicholas has been telling the truth

a lot recently.

The cake, with its question mark, is finished.

CASEY (V.O.)

Roses are red, violets are blue.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 65.

Jody, dressed in Tamara's leopard skin coat, is admiring

herself in Tamara's mirror, swigging from a bottle of wine.

We hear Casey reading the card.

CASEY (V.O.)

You are so fit

I wanna shag you.

Love from Ben pfwoor!!!

Jody takes another swig with a wicked grin, she sits at

Tamara's PC.

We hear Casey knock three times on the back door.

Outside Casey is waiting. Jody lets her in. She has

accessorised the leopard print coat with red stilettos, a

Chloe bag and bright red lipstick.

What are you doing?

Just messing. I got one from Mum, one

from that peanut Ryan, and a mystery

one from Ben.

I sent you that.

Jody takes another swig from the bottle of wine.

Is that theirs?

It's my mum's; they don't drink this

shit.

She hands it to Casey.

Look what I'm doing. Come on.

Jody plonks herself down at Tamara's PC.

We have to get him back down here.

I'm sending him a valentine.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 66.

No you are not!

From her address.

He'll think it's from Tamara, you

dipshit.

But I know it'll be from me. Subject:

Hot Love.

(amused, despite herself)

Oh God, Jody...

Contacts: where are you Ben?

Look, there's that bloke my mum works

for; Nicholas Hardiment.

Let's put him on. Who else?

Uncle Andy.

Andy Cobb.

(typing as she speaks)

`Come to Winnards Farm. I'll give you

the biggest shagging of your life.

Love Tamara xxx.'

Don't ever, ever send that.

I just did.

You never!

You'll spoil it! Jody - I love coming

here and you'll spoil it!

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 66A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 67.

She'll know someone's read all her

stuff!

I'll delete it from sent items. It's

just a laugh, Case. I only want Ben

to come back.

Ben is reading the email looking angry and jealous.

What the fuck is this?

Beth opens the email.

`Come to Winnards Farm.'

Andy is on the public computer looking completely puzzled.

`I'll give you the biggest shagging

of your life...'

Beth starts, utterly shocked.

Zoe is leaning over Andy's shoulder, reading the email.

She must want a foursome. Or

something.

Ben is bashing away at his drums. Boss is barking. Tamara is

trying to remonstrate with Ben over the din.

How many times? I didn't send it!

Are you listening to me? BEN! WILL

YOU STOP DRUMMING?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 68.

He stops. He looks at her, betrayed.

Why don't you believe me? I didn't

write that email.

Explain it then.

Is this about Fran?

What's Fran got to do with it?

She's the reason you don't trust me.

Just because she fucked around on

you it doesn't mean that I will.

Ben, furious, starts drumming again. Tamara boiling with

frustration, walks away.

FIELD (LIMBURY) OUTSIDE ANDY'S SHED.

Tamara is on the phone at the far end of the flat.

I wasn't pissed, or depraved or

Andy is outside his shed.

It's OK, it's OK...

The drumming leads up to a massive crescendo and stops.

Can you go to the farm? Just take a

look, see if anyone's been in.

No problem.

Thank you. Ben's really pissed off.

He's massively got the hump -

Ben appears from the other end of the large room.

Have I?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 68A.

Got to go. Sorry.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 69.

I've just asked him to go and check

over the farm -

Are you thick?

What?

Isn't it obvious who sent it? That

tosser Andy Cobb.

He wouldn't do that.

Making himself all cosy in your

house. Going through your stuff,

prob'ly wearing your fucking pants -

No way!

Bet it was him that nicked my black

T-shirt.

There is no way Andy would do that!

Well that says it all; the way you

leap to his defence.

He hasn't done anything.

You know what? I know Fran fucked

my best friend but at least she was

straight with me.

Ben - where are you going? Don't

go!

Fuck's sake.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 70.

He pushes her away, harder than he meant to. She lands on the

sofa, shocked.

I'm taking the dog for a crap.

He grabs the lead and opens the door. It slams shut. Tamara's

dread overwhelms her.

Poppy is reading a print-out of Tamara's email. Beth is

folding sheets.

Oh come on mum. She's just stirring

shit. Tamara's always done that.

Why's your father on there - and

poor Andy? It's so tasteless.

(helping with the sheets)

You know how subversive she is. She

once sent me a valentine from

Prince Harry - and I believed it.

It's her sense of humour; she likes

causing trouble. At school she used

to give us first years tips on how

to shoplift.

She taught you to shoplift?

Mum, she's marrying Ben Sergeant.

Why would she look at an old git

like dad?

Nicholas is in the shadowy hall, listening with interest.

Poppy helps Beth upstairs with the laundry. Nicholas steps

into the kitchen. Poppy has left the email on the table.

Nicholas picks it up, deeply curious.

Nicholas is walking up the field wearing his red scarf. Andy

is outside his shed, doing heavy work.

What did you make of that email

from Tamara?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 70A.

It don't make any sense. Her London

boyfriend's trying to fuck her up;

that's my theory.

She could do so much better.

Couldn't agree more.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 71.

Casey and Jody are pouring over a gossip mag; pictures of

celebrity blonde with new man.

How come she's with a different bloke

every week and when Lesley Hunt's

sister shagged Jeff Dobson - just

once, after he lied he loved her -

she gets called a dirty slag.

(Pointing at the blonde)

That's cos she does it in five star

resorts around the world - and not

The Feathers carpark.

Over the page, Ben canoodling in a freezing park with Fran.

It's Ben!

`Who's the daddy? Steve Culley and

Fran Redmond recently announced they

were expecting. But in a Valentine

tryst shocker Fran is snapped with ex

Ben Sergeant! Ben and Fran - we say

Get A Room.'

He's back with Fran? After...

After that email, Jode.

No way. No way!

Tamara's car zooms past. Her expression is black.

Omigod... what if she's dumped?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 72.

Tamara arrives outside her house. Depressed. She remains in

the car, reluctant to go in, to face her isolation.

She looks at herself in the mirror. The face that stares back

seems like that of a stranger.

Tamara is lying in bed with her brand new nose bandaged up.

He face is covered in bruising. She is panicking -

experiencing a loss of self.

The mask drops. All her old insecurities come back. She gets

out of the car and slams the door, unable to stand the sight

of herself. She lets herself in.

The inside of the house has been transformed by Andy. The

drab gloomy shades of her mother have gone, replaced by warm

tones which bring out the beauty of the house.

Tamara wanders through. She turns around taking it all in.

She never knew the house was so beautiful.

Jody is weeping into her mobile phone.

I'll never see Ben again... And it's

all MY FAULT.

Jody's mum comes into the room.

What's all your fault?

(putting the phone down)

None of your business.

I'm bloody sick of you looking like a

wet weekend. Who's Ben?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 72A.

No one.

What've you done?

Nothing.

Are you in trouble?

NO!... Leave me alone.

You take care with boys, Jody. You

know what can happen.

What can happen? What can ever,

ever happen in a place like this?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 73.

Beth is with Lucetta, another writer, crossing a field.

Lucetta raises her binoculars passes them to Beth.

POV SHOT AT MARVELL'S FARM.

Are they crows or jackdaws? It's so

nice to get these little details

right.

They're rooks.

I've got an unhappy wife and a

newly qualified vet discovering a

forbidden world of physical love in

a bird hide.

There's Nicholas...

Nicholas's red scarf makes him visible from afar.

Nicholas sees Tamara. He waits while she emerges from the

copse.

I'm looking for Andy.

He's not up at Stonefield.

Tamara is about to turn back.

So what about this shag I've been

reading about?

Oh fuck off.

I liked your email. Very succint.

Well I didn't send it. And I wouldn't

shag you if you were the last man

left after a nuclear winter.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 73A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 74.

Drop dead you smug prick.

Nicholas watches her storm back up the copse.

Tamara's car pulls up. Jody and Casey wheel around closer on

their bikes. Tamara tries the door. The pub is shut. She

looks in through the glass and sees Zoe up on the bar,

clinging to Andy in a long embrace. Tamara is frozen. Andy

kisses Zoe, long and tender.

Tamara turns.

She gets back in her car, trying to hide her distress - which

has taken her completely by surprise. Jody and Casey stare

mutely as she drives away.

Andy and Zoe finish their kiss.

Still time to change your mind. Blue

skies. Fun in the sun.

Just not a traveller, Zoe.

I know... you're like a big old

tree. Stuck here.

Nicholas parks his 4X4. As he gets out, he is on the phone.

I'll probably stay on at the library

for another hour or two. Yes... just

checking some law reports.

Tamara is playing with the ill-fitting ring that Ben gave

her. She puts it a jar and closes the lid. There's a knock on

the front door. She startles, her face falling. She answers

it. Nicholas is on the threshold.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 75.

Hello.

So. Nicholas.

She lets the door fall open. She backs into the hall.

Nicholas walks in. He closes the door. They look at each

other. Neither of them moves.

You can tell me to leave.

Tamara says nothing.

You can throw me right out.

Nicholas slowly takes his red scarf and coat off. He hangs

them on a coat hook, bringing himself closer to her.

Just say and I'll go.

She still can't speak. Nicholas takes her in his arms. He is

big and fatherly and comforting.

Tamara feels a sense of relief, of not being alone. Her arms

go around him. When he kisses her, he's surprisingly real,

vulnerable even, as if he's left his lordly persona at the

door. Tamara closes her eyes.

Their kisses become more urgent.

Tamara is lying in Nicholas' arms in the growing darkness. He

looks blissfully post-coital. Tamara is gazing ahead. A tear

rolls down her cheek. It lands on Nicholas' chest.

Are you crying?

No.

Nicholas is taken aback. He instinctively holds her.

Don't cry. Am I really that bad?

Tamara shakes her head, glad of him.

I'm just not myself.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 76.

Yes you are.

She looks up at him.

You're relentlessly, rudely,

uncompromisingly yourself.

A smile appears on Tamara's face.

I used to watch you out of my window

helping your daughter learn to

skateboard up the lane. Bit of an

obvious crush, wasn't it.

Is that why you're crying?

No.

Am I here as revenge on your ex?

I don't know why you're here. Why are

you here, Nicholas?

Because... since you climbed over

that stile in the summer I haven't

thought about very much else.

She doesn't believe him.

You can use me in one of your books.

Nicholas is putting his coat on. Tamara is uneasy.

When can we do this again?

What about Beth?

Look, Beth and I have this kind of

Bullshit.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 76A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 77.

Isn't life complicated enough?

Nicholas shakes his head. He kisses her.

Nicholas strolls in. He's ecstatically happy. Beth is getting

something out of the Aga.

Oh poor you - was it awful?

Bloody terrible. Didn't move till

well past Chiswick. But look, I

nipped into Fortnums...

He hands her a package.

All my favourite teas - Oh!

He embraces her. He is affectionate, magnanimous in his

bliss. Beth is taken aback by his warmth.

My goodness. You feel like my buzzy

toothbrush just after I've charged it

up. You should go up to London more

often.

Maybe I will...

Nicholas goes to the table. The writers greet him as he sits.

Sorry everybody; traffic was a pig.

Do carry on...

I'm trying this magic realist bit

at the end of chapter three, where

the characters slowly turn into

That sounds very innovative...

Do you think so? It's sort of the

key to the structure, which I'm

thinking of as a nest shape...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 78.

Nicholas listens benevolently as Lucetta shares. His good

humour is so out of his recent character that Beth watches

him with increasing unease. There is something in her eyes

akin to suspicion.

Beth is putting Glen's luggage into the boot.

So after two years of radio silence

I contact my editor. And she loves -

I mean loves the chapters I did in

the fall.

Oh Glen.

I tried writing at the library but

I could feel that awful paralysis

descending again.

GLEN (V.O.)

I missed everything that I've been,

you know, finding here.

(Seeing the view)

Oh my god - it's so beautiful!

They are now in the village driving down the main drag.

I'm glad you've come back.

A few solid weeks should - holy cow!

An egg hits the windscreen (shot the same way as the earlier

scene). Casey and Jody hide. Beth gets out of the car to

clean the window.

Idiots! Morons! Hey, writers! Let's

egg the self-regarding sacks of shit.

Glen is helping Beth prepare the evening meal. They are both

animated, enjoying one another's company.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 79.

He gave his wife syphilis.

Jolly good.

He's completely distracted. He's up

and down to London all the time.

The latest Inchcombe's taking

everything he's got.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 80.

Nicholas is reading, hunched over a computer. He glances

round. Tamara, wearing a robe, is awaiting his opinion.

Is it any good? Because I keep -

Shush.

(Points at the screen)

This is brutally candid. You lay

yourself completely bare.

I'm well-known for it.

Seriously. It's very moving.

Tamara knows this is praise indeed. She is deeply gratified.

Thank you.

So... have I done my duty?

Admirably.

Now do I get my treat?

Tamara, almost in his arms, is crestfallen.

You are so cheesy.

Tamara is staring at him with something akin to distaste.

Jody and Casey share a magazine and a spliff in the bus stop.

Zero Ben sightings in two whole

months.

Last time I saw Plastic she looked

like a minger; all red-eyed and

gutted. Ben's a Love Rat.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 81.

She should move on...

She's probably topped herself. I

would if Ben dumped me.

Jode. Don't say that. What if she's

done something?

Like got in the bath with her heated

tongs?

Like taken a stack of pills?

We see Jody's thought bubble of Tamara luridly dead, her

mouth coated with dried froth and vomit.

D'you think she might be lying there

all choked in vomit and drug froth?

That'd be dire.

If we find her we'll get in the

papers.

Oh my God.

Rock Chick Dead at Winnards Farm.

Andy is outside the farm beside his landrover. He walks up to

the front door. Hesitates.

Behind the railings, the girls arrive.

What's Uncle Andy doing here?

Andy knocks.

Hearing the knock, Tamara springs out of bed. Nicholas spins

into a panic.

Arse biscuits.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 81A.

Casey and Jody are watching as Andy waits.

No answer...

She could have been lying there

days. She could be like putrid now,

like rancid -

Oh no, I'm gonna chuck -

Like bloated and all greeny.

And Uncle Andy'll find her by the

smell!

Eurrrrr! Shhhhh!!

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 82.

Tamara opens the door in some deshabille. To her surprise,

she sees Andy on the threshold, looking spruced up and

handsome. The contrast with Nicholas couldn't be more

apparent. She finds herself genuinely pleased to see him.

Andy...

Behind the railings, the girls can't help their look of

disappointment at seeing her alive.

Bollocks.

Haven't seen you for a while. Thought

you might be ill or something. Or

depressed or -

I've had my head down, writing.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 83.

Come for a drink. Let's lighten up.

I'd love to, but...

Shake off the winter blues. Come

celebrate the spring.

I can't... I'm kind of on one with

my writing.

Over her shoulder, Andy sees Nicholas' red scarf and coat

hanging on the coat hook. He hides his shock. Tamara is

unaware that he has seen.

Can we do it soon though? I'd

really like to; just not right now.

He nods at her in disbelief.

Sure.

He turns on his heels and goes. Tamara closes the door.

Outside, Andy is leaning over his land-rover, sickened.

D'you think he's in with a chance?

No way.

Why not? He's fit. I'd do him.

Jody - he's my uncle.

She'd be mad not to have him - I

bet he goes a like a train.

Nicholas is creeping down the stairs. Tamara is troubled.

What's he doing here?

He just came on the off-chance.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 83A.

Off-chance of what?

He wants to know about roofing for

the shed...

Andy's Land Rover roars away.

Let's go. I'm freezing my tits off.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 84.

Wait!!

Casey is looking back at Tamara's door. Tamara is peering

out. Nicholas joins her, putting his coat on. He kisses her

passionately. He wants to stay. She's insisting he leaves.

Oh. My. God.

It's him. From Stonefield.

The dirty cheating sod.

Tamara wanders in looking like she's trying to shake Nicholas

out of her hair. She sits, full of apprehension.

We see her fears: Beth, in her apron, pulling Tamara's hair

back and coming at her face with an electric hand-held whisk.

You fucking little slut.

She puts her head in her hands.

Jody and Casey have Googled Nicholas. They are outraged.

`Prolific author of intelligent

crime novels.'

Fucking `D' list. How could she do

that after Ben?

Maybe she's numbing the pain.

He's not even a proper celeb.

Maybe older guys know more... you

know, bed stuff.

Eww! He's a perv. I hate him.

Jode, I know who I feel sorry for.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 84A.

Beth is walking to the post box. Jody and Casey are at the

bus shelter, gazing at her with keenest pity.

Hello Casey. How are you?

Jody nudges her. Casey nods. Beth posts her mail.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 85.

You waiting for the bus?

Bus got scrapped.

So it did. Well. Hope it doesn't

rain.

She turns for home.

Gutted for her.

Me too. Fat arse though, hasn't

she?

Casey and Jody stroll down a lonely lane. Misty. Rooks caw.

There'll be the divorce and like

acrimony and her world'll fall

apart...

Yeah.

But maybe one day, she'll put the

bitterness behind her and find a

new love...

Don't be daft. She's old, you big

sop.

A parked 4x4 looms out of the mist.

See? That's D-List's car.

So this is where he hides it when he

goes to shag Plastic.

Yeah. Dirty git.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 85A.

Big old turd.

He's a rotten cheater.

Like my dad. Come on Case. Let's

fuck him up.

Nicholas looks to see if the coast is clear - then lets

himself out.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 86.

Nicholas is striding purposefully back to his car with a smug

post-coital grin. Then he sees that one of his tyres has been

let down.

Shit salad.

He gets out his phone. Jody and Casey are in the trees

watching, satisfied.

Beth is on the phone preparing to cook.

Oh poor you. What a drag.

Tamara is half-running down the track with a foot pump.

The rooks are cawing.

Yes, it's a frightful bore.

BETH (O.S.)

Well I'll hold off on the paella.

Tamara arrives, breathless. Nicholas signals her to keep

quiet. She looks guilty, anxious.

You're a marvel. See you soon.

The line goes dead. Beth is disconcerted. Glen walks in.

Beth, could I use your printer?

Nicholas is on the motorway with a

flat tyre. But I couldn't hear

traffic. Just rooks...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 87.

She snaps out of it. But she knows.

Did you ask me to read something?

The tyres are done. Nicholas is about to get in the car.

Nicholas, someone knows. Maybe we

Who cares?

He kisses her, passionately. She is troubled but eventually

responds. Jody nudges Casey.

Casey, pap them. Pap them!

Casey holds out her mobile and takes a picture. Then Tamara

extricates herself from his embrace.

Jody peers at Casey's photo. A close-up clinch.

Fucking bingo.

Tamara, dressed for a walk, heads down the lane. She looks

preoccupied.

Jody appears from behind the hedge. She heads for the door,

motioning Casey to follow.

Jody is at the computer. Casey is keeping a nervous watch.

This is wrong, Jode.

She's asking for it; slut. I'm

going to email D-List's wife.

We should send the photo and be done

with it.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 87A.

Casey.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 88.

What?

While I was sitting here. Look. An

e-mail from Ben come in. Just like

that, when I'm here.

`Tamara, Fran's baby has come.'

Ben is play-fighting with Boss.

BEN (V.O.)

And as it's a cute little brown girl

with curly black hair I think we can

safely say it's Steven Culley's and

not mine. Truth is, I feel released.

I am free! New band up and running.

Done three songs about me and you.

Ben throws a treat lovingly at Boss. Boss catches it.

BEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Big favour to ask. We're recording in

Paris. Would you have Boss?

Jody continues to read.

`Could drop him off next week. And

when I'm back, maybe we could dot dot

dot. Ben.'

He's coming back.

Tamara doesn't deserve him, Case.

(She starts to type)

`Dear Ben, I can't see you as I am

shagging an old married man -

What're you doing??

`But I have found a reliable dog-

lover in the village...

No way, Jody! You're not sending it.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 89.

`Call Jody on 07700 900929.'

Casey tries to stop her pressing send. Jody digs her nails

into Casey's hand. Casey yowls. Jody presses send.

You stupid cow!

I'm making something happen!

You gone too far!

I'm getting him down here.

/ You don't know when to stop!

You're an idiot. I'm not having

nothing to do with it.

Jody shouts over her from /.

Otherwise my whole life'll go by and

I'll be washed up and thirty four

like my mum and no one decent will

ever even have snogged me!

Casey is leaving.

You twat.

Fuck off then.

Nicholas is writing. Beth approaches.

There's the festival brochure. You're

on in the Lanson Marquee. I've marked

a few bits in case you want to read.

Beth hands him a hardback.

You're a marvel. Cheers.

He kisses her and prepares to leave. She is suspicious.

I could come with you.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 89A.

Oh, don't. You hate festivals.

But it's only Hadditon. I'll come.

It's completely boring. You'll hate

it. Stay here.

Her suspicion will stay silent no longer.

Have you got anything to tell me,

Nicholas?

Like what?

Nicholas attacks; the best form of defence.

God, it's like living with the

effing moral police. Are you ever

going to trust me?

He goes.

Nicholas drives through a huge puddle in his 4X4, splashing

Casey. He roars on, oblivious.

(getting her mobile out)

Right. Wanker.

SCENES 146,147 AND 148 ARE CUT.

Glen is admiring his finished manuscript. Beth is making

sponge, preoccupied - but pleased at Glen's achievement.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 90.

I'm doing this cake in celebration.

Well done.

To Hardy.

Although I can't bear the man for

what he did to his wife.

Well, things were different then.

She had no choice.

She couldn't just walk away. I mean

who'd put up with that now?

What is it?

(Looking to Andy)

How do I find out who sent this?

It says number withheld.

Did you know?

Couldn't tell you. I'm sorry Beth.

Her...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 90A.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 91.

It's so shitty, so insulting. You

do not deserve to be treated -

If you're kind to me, I'll cry. I

don't want to cry. I must be very

clear.

If there is anything I can do...

I have to do it myself.

Beth's face cracks into distress.

Hey, come on.

I trod in the sponge mix.

It's OK. It's OK.

Tamara is out on a walk. She approaches the shed; sees Andy's

landrover parked beside it.

Andy?

Andy emerges. Tamara smiles tentatively.

Hey. How are you?

Andy says nothing.

Would you like to have that drink? I

could do with a friend / at the

moment and -

You and Nicholas Hardiment. That's a

nice piece of work isn't it?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 92.

I get it from his point of view. He's

always been a cheating wanker. He

loves having his cake and eating it -

But since when did your standards

drop so low? You could have anyone.

All you have to do is bat your eyes.

I care a lot about Beth. She helped

me out when I was at rock bottom.

I'm not going to split them up. It's

A bit of fun?

It's none of your bloody business.

I reckoned I could still see the

blazing girl you used to be. But now?

Shut up!

I don't know who you are.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 93.

Boss is crapping on a verge. Ben is on his phone.

That Jody? This is Ben Sergeant.

Jody falls off her bed.

That's right, yes... I love dogs.

The crap is done. Man and dog are back in the car.

So I'll meet you at Winnards Farm,

four thirty.

Ben zooms off.

Jody is haranguing with her mum.

It's a nice dog, Mum!

Well I don't like `em. Dog-hair and

slobber all over the place.

But I said yes.

No dogs, no way and that's final.

Jody is devastated.

You loser. I hate you. You want to

RUIN MY LIFE!!!

Jody slams her bedroom door. She stares at herself in the

mirror. She steels herself.

Live the dream, Jody...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 93A.

Tamara pulls Nicholas into a quiet corner.

Andy Cobb has rumbled us.

Cock pie. Has he told Beth?

I don't know. But he might. And I

wouldn't blame him.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 94.

Well, I suppose it has to come out

sometime.

Does it?

It's a good thing. Feels like a

relief. Means you and I can start to

think about our plans. For the

future...

Nicholas?...

I know it's been hard, sharing me

with Beth. But I'm yours now. I'm

going to leave her. I want a new

life - and I want it now. With you.

Tamara is appalled. A minder interrupts.

Mr Hardiment? It's time.

During the interview, Tamara takes a seat at the end of the

front row. The audience listens attentively.

It all runs very smoothly. I start a

book in the summer, publish it the

following spring. Bit of a factory,

really.

So you've just finished `Like The

Night', Inchcombe's seventeenth

adventure. Are you already planning

the next?

There won't be a next one. Frankly

I'm sick to death of Inchcombe. In

fact, I'm about to kill him off.

There's a gust of dismay in the crowd, as though a real death

has been announced.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 95.

That's a bombshell for your fans.

(all for Tamara)

Yes, but I'm moving on to fresh

pastures.

LADY IN THE CROWD

No!

Inchcombe will be meeting a very

sticky end. And it's one murder I'm

really looking forward to.

LADY IN THE CROWD

How could you?

This might be a good moment to take a

few questions. Yes, the lady in the

apron...

You write a lot about adultery. Is

that from personal experience?

Tamara turns round. Nicholas' colour drains. Beth is with

Glen, close by - glaring at him. He tries to make a joke.

Madam, what a saucy question!

Why do you cheat persistently on your

wife?

Nicholas considers whether he wants to be publicly

humiliated. He decides not.

Because she lets me.

Beth takes this like a blow. Even Tamara is shocked by it.

Tamara is striding away from the Marquee, red with shame.

Nicholas is at her side almost jogging to keep up.

It's got to stop, Nicholas.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 96.

You're right. I can't go on using

her, lying to her. Won't be fun but

I've got to do it.

I don't feel alive with Beth! I

haven't been living for years. She's

had me smothered in a comfy blanket -

Nicholas, listen to me.

We had fun. But it's wrong. And

it's over.

But... I'm in love with you.

I'm sorry.

No. You can't end it. Tamara - Fuck

supper!

Will you keep it down?

My God, you're cold hearted.

Please don't shout.

You don't feel a thing, do you?

I do feel. I feel like I'm blazing

away inside all the time. Why do I do

these things? What am I doing with

you?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 97.

There's someone else isn't there...

Oh for God's sake.

Not that narcissist drummer?

Goodbye.

It's that ignorant lunk isn't it?

That muscle-bound wastrel Andy Cobb.

Andy Cobb is a far better man than

you!

In saying it, Tamara realises it's true. She walks away.

Nicholas bends almost double in pain, letting out a great

moan from the soul. A fan has been waiting at a respectful

distance. He approaches.

Nicholas numbly takes his book. Instead of signing, he tears

it to pieces. He hands the tatters back to the fan.

Thank you.

Jody knocks on the door. It's open. She pushes it.

Hello? It's Jody Long. About the

dog?

She looks around.

Ben?

She heads up the stairs.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 98.

Hello Jody...

Dog minder? I guessed you might be

the somebody who's been getting in

here, pissing about, sending e-mails

and fucking people up. D'you know

what I'm saying? You've been breaking

in.

I didn't break in. Used the key.

What key?

Found it under a pot.

Well for fuck's sake. Did you nick

my T-shirt?

Took it as a souvenir. I'm sorry!

Creeping about in our stuff? What

gives you the right?

I just... like I always wanted to

meet you...just once...just to tell

you stuff...

What stuff?

Like... I love you.

So that's nice. Least someone does.

I used to lie awake thinking about

you being here... in Ewedown, the

bumhole of nowhere. It was the

best thing to happen ever. I've

been so in love with you. And when

you left I couldn't bear it. I

thought the valentine would make

you come back...

D'you still love me, Jody? Even

though I wanna lock you up in a

young offenders institution?

Jody nods, unsure.

What would you do for me then?

Would you do anything, like a

proper fan?

Jody looks at him, scared. She manages a nod. Ben approaches

her.

Let's see then shall we?

We see Jody's phone flashing on the bed.

CASEY (V.O.)

Jody! What are you doing not

fucking answering?

Casey is at the triangle leaving a message on Jody's phone.

Boss is running round and round it.

Ben's dog. It's here. Means Ben

must be -

Casey suddenly realises where Jody is. The dog runs off up

the street. Casey sets off towards Winnards, full of

apprehension.

Beth is taking Nicholas' awards down and chucking them in a

box. Glen is trying to save them from smashing.

I bet that bitch wants a baby. Well

she'll find out; Nicholas doesn't

do children.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 99A.

He'll leave it all up to her.

That'll age her.

But suppose he discovers

fatherhood?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 100.

They do, these men, second time

round. They get all nappy-happy.

I was barely twenty when I got

pregnant. I've never done

anything! Oh God! God!

Yes you have. Look at this place!

I hate him - I've wasted my life!

No... What about all the work you do

here?

Breeding goats? Baking fucking

biscuits? It's meaningless!

Beth... When I was lost with my

book you helped me more than you

know. You asked who I was writing

it for...

You.

Excuse me.

May I speak with my wife?

No. You may not.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 101.

Beth walks outside towards the chicken coup. Nicholas pursues

her. She sees Boss running across the grounds chasing birds.

It's over.

That's Ben Sergeant's dog. Perhaps

he's come to beat the shit out of

you - good!

Beth - I finished it. She's been

chasing me; this wild crush -

There's something desperate about

her, something almost unhinged -

Good God, even when you try and

tell the truth you lie. YOU LIE!!

Nicholas is falling apart.

I want you to leave. I want a

divorce. I want Stonefield.

Beth...Don't. You can't.

I will.

And you - Go home! Bugger Off!!

She throws a handful of chicken feed at him. Boss runs away.

Beth storms off.

Nicholas looks profoundly shocked; like a man who has just

realised he's in danger of drowning.

Tamara's car pulls up outside. She gets out, looking at the

yellow Porsche in complete disbelief.

Ben...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 101A.

Jody is shakily pouring a pot of tea.

Right. Now put two sugars in and

stir it. OK. That's a decent cup.

Which is lucky Jody cos if it had

been shit, I'd be on the phone to

the extremely scary local cops

right now.

Please don't tell my mum.

I knew it was boring round here but

for fuck's sake...

I'm gonna get out as soon as I can.

Going to work in Vegas - as a

croupier. Vegas, or a cruise liner.

Aim high, that's what I say.

Tamara lets herself in. She calls:

Ben?

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 102.

Tamara. You've had an infestation.

Of what?

Jody.

Jody, shamefaced, prepares to cough up.

Boss is lolloping round. He stops. The whole herd of cows is

staring at him. Boss regards the animals with curiosity. He

wags his tail. Will they play? He starts to bark.

Nicholas sees Glen sitting on the edge of an old rusting

trough. Fury overwhelms him.

Oy! Greg! I want a a word with you.

It's Glen, asshole.

Nicholas is stomping through the mud and cowshit.

You fucking devious bastard.

I'm devious? I'm a bastard?

You think I haven't noticed how

you've been worming your way in?

You keep your hands off my wife,

you low-rent pedant.

You've abused her long enough /

with your goddamn lies -

I want you out of my house.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 103.

It's Beth's. She made this place -

And I fucking pay for it. I've

given Beth all this. What can you

give her?

I can give her / integrity!

Obscure literary shit not worth ten

You know if I made my pile

fantasizing rapes and homicides I

wouldn't be so proud.

You cunt.

Fuck you.

Beth'll come to her senses. You

need an income to run Stonefield.

And mine's bigger than yours!

Now... get up, Nicholas. Let's talk

about this like grown men.

Oh my God. Nicholas...

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 104.

They are heading straight for the trough. Nicholas is trying

to get up on his knees.

Nicholas! Get up! Run!

Glen puts out a hand to help him. But before Nicholas

notices, he instinctively retrieves it.

Glen turns on his heels and runs, terrified. He throws

himself into the hedge as the cows thunder past. They

disappear down the hill, Boss still behind them.

Glen looks back towards the water trough. Nicholas is lying

on his front, his face pressed into the mud, unmoving.

Glen walks over. He gingerly peers at him. The back of

Nicholas' skull is broken open. Blood is pooling in the mud

and shit. Glen panics. He looks all around. Has the accident

been seen?

No human is visible. Has his part in it been noticed? He

bends down as if to turn the body over, in case by some

miracle Nicholas still lives. He cannot bring himself to

touch him. Fear overwhelms him. He runs away.

Tamara is looking at Jody, stunned.

It was you?

Jody can't look her in the eye.

Jody has explained that she did it

out of deep love for me.

To Ben's astonishment, Tamara smiles. He grabs his moment.

Tamara...

It's an apology. Tamara takes Ben's hand and leads him

through to a dresser in the hall. She opens it.

Ben.

She takes the ring out of the jar and puts it in his hand.

I'm in love with someone else.

At that moment, Casey appears at the back door.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 105.

Jody - the dog!

Boss is still worrying the herd. He's got them against a

gate. The animals are very distressed. Behind them we see

Andy's Landrover appear.

Andy gets out of his Landrover, takes out his rifle, comes

through the gate. Loads his rifle while watching the dog.

His POV. The dog and the cattle.

He raises the gun.

Through his sights, the dog.

As his finger tightens on the trigger.

Bang. A shot rings out. He looks round, off right.

Up on the ridge of the hill, Penny Upminster is standing in a

straw hat and flowery wellies, with a smoking gun.

Got `im. The beast.

Beth, chucking fan mail into the bin, stops in her tracks.

Tamara's head appears at the front door.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 106.

Beth is coming down the field where Nicholas lies. She sees a

figure in the distance. She squints, the sun in her eyes.

Opposite her she sees Tamara descending through the copse.

Tamara, walking down by the trough, discovers Nicholas' body.

She drops to her knees, light-headed with shock.

Beth walks into the field. She sees Tamara kneeling, looking

at something on the other side of the trough.

Bitch.

Tamara looks up.

Beth - no -

Brazen. That is brazen.

Beth carries on walking towards her.

Beth. Don't.

Tamara is running towards Beth. She cannot bear her to see.

She throws her arms around her, protecting her.

Don't look. Don't look...

It is too late. Beth is seeing the corpse. A great wave of

shock hits her. Tamara holds her tight, trying to contain it.

Another great wave of shock.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 107.

Nicholas. No.

Her cries of grief soar over the valley.

Tamara, ashen, is on the phone to emergency services.

You'll get to it through Byley farm.

His skull is broken. It's smashed. No

I haven't but... it's obvious. His

wife. Yes she is. Thank you. Thank

you. I will.

Beth has turned Nicholas over. She is washing the mud from

his face with water from the trough.

They're on their way...

Beth seems totally closed off. Tamara gingerly approaches.

She touches Beth's shoulder.

Beth? Help is coming -

Beth cannot bear to be touched. Her hand involuntarily flies

out. It slams into Tamara's face.

Tamara steps back. Her nose is broken, pouring blood.

It's broken! -

She gasps, riding the pain, knowing she deserves it. It's the

biggest wake-up call of her life.

Beth stares at her, at first astonished at what she has done -

then satisfied. Tamara stumbles away.

Tamara sits beside a dewpond, gingerly washing the blood off

her face.

Tamara...

Andy is watching. She turns away from him. He approaches.

I'm sorry.

She starts crying bitter tears.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 107A.

Tam, come on. It was an accident.

I'd better get up to Stonefield. Come

with me. We'll get this sorted.

GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 108.

Tamara shakes her head. She separates herself from him and

stands.

Then get Ben to take you to London.

Make sure he looks after you.

Tamara walks a few paces away. She stares straight ahead.

I don't want to be with Ben.

She looks back at Andy. He begins to understand. She walks

off.

Glen, sick with dread, is drying his face with a towel. He

picks up his muddy shoes and clothes, wraps them in a bag and

shoves them in his case.

His eyes alight on his poster of Thomas Hardy. He pulls it

down.

Ben and the girls have dug a grave for Boss. Casey is putting

flowers on the top. Ben starts to cry like a broken-hearted

little boy. Jody instinctively puts her arms round him. The

girls are immensely moved. Jody looks over at Casey. She

Pap me! Pap me!

Casey waits until Ben is not looking. Then she takes pictures

with her mobile phone. Jody cradles Ben in her arms, doing

her best moved-but-sultry pose. Casey tries not to laugh.

Jody is ecstatic. The man of her dreams is in her arms. Her

wish has come true.

An ambulance and two police cars are in the courtyard. The

police are carrying the corpse, covered in blankets. Andy

crosses the yard to the barn. He bumps into Glen furtively

coming out of the door. Glen's case is packed.

What are you doing?

Glen can't look him in the eye.

You can't run away.

I'm not running away! I just

finished my book; my time here is

up. Destiny calls.

Beth is asking for you.

She's... Really?

She's on her own over there. Glen,

she doesn't need a writer around

the place. She needs a man.

Beth is sitting, still pale with shock, her hands around a

mug of tea. Glen approaches.

I'm so sorry.

Beth looks up at him despairingly.

Do they... suspect anyone? I mean

of like Foul Play?

It was my fault. I let the dog go!

No, no...

I shooed him away! The police said

it was an accident but...

It wasn't your fault!

What I don't understand is why was

he in that field anyway? He hated

cows. And when they were coming,

why didn't he get out of their way?

For a moment, confession and silence hang in the balance.

Glen opens his mouth to speak.

You live in the country. You share

it with those dangerous beasts. And

when they're scared, they run. Like

we do...

Glen is full of horror at his lie.

But Beth is only grateful.

Glen. Stay with me.

Her eyes, still red with grief, are full of their future

together.

Glen nods. He will stay. He wants it all.

Beth leans into him, seeking comfort. He puts his arms around

her, his face ashen with the weight of his secret.

As he holds her, he looks around the room. Nicholas is

everywhere, glaring down at him from photographs.

Tamara is in the garden, a strip on her nose. She sees Andy

in the dusk. He's leaning against the gate watching her.

Don't say anything.

Kind of suits you. And I always did

like the old one.

They are in each others arms. The embrace lasts and lasts.

Tamara is leading Andy up to the house.

You did it on purpose, didn't you?

What?

Made it so beautiful I'd never be

able to leave.

Been dying to get rid of you. This

is my house. I was born in that

room.

So you were.

Welcome home.

THE END.
