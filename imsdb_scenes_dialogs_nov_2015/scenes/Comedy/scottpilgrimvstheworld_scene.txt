1 EXT. TORONTO RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 1

Snowy suburbs of Toronto. From a nondescript house we hear:

KIM PINE (O.S.)

Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler?

2 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' KITCHEN - DAY 2

Four twenty-somethings lounge around a small kitchen table.

STEPHEN STILLS, 25, shaggy hair, Canadian Cowboy chic.

Really? Is she hot?

KIM PINE, 22, cute, bitter, sweatshirt with a zipper.

How old are you now, Scott? Like

twenty-eight?

I'm not playing your little games.

So you've been out of high school

for like, 13 years and-

SCOTT (O.S.)

I'm twenty-two. Twenty-two!

And you're dating a high school

girl? Not bad, not bad.

YOUNG NEIL, 20, simple mind, layered T-shirts.

Like, did you guys 'do it' yet?

SCOTT PILGRIM, 22, fresh faced and charmingly cocky with an

unruly yet adorable mop of hair.

We have done many things. We ride

the bus. We have meaningful

conversations about how yearbook

club went and about her friends

and, um...you know...drama.

Yeah, okay, have you even kissed her?

We almost held hands once, but then

she got embarrassed.

Well. Aren't you pleased as punch?

So, what's her name?

(pleased as punch)

Knives Chau. She's Chinese.

(under his breath)

Chinese...

Young Neil pauses his Nintendo DS.

Wicked! How'd you meet her?

I believe I mentioned the bus?

Scott Pilgrim prepares to tell an amazing story:

3 INT. THE BUS - NIGHT 3

KNIVES CHAU, 17, cute and innocent with clothes to match,

sits next to her mother, MOTHER CHAU, 45, demanding.

You are seventeen year old! Time to

get interested in boy!

Mom!

Knives DROPS her bag, books scattering everywhere.

You drop book.

Knives crouches down to pick up her books, grumbling.

SCOTT (O.S.)

Hey...

Knives looks up to see the cute and gallant SCOTT PILGRIM

holding her books. TEXT appears in an on-screen box:

"SCOTT PILGRIM, 22 YEARS OLD, RATING: AWESOME."

Stars appear in Knives's eyes. Scott grins heroically. Scott

winks at Knives. Scott winks at the camera.

4 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' KITCHEN - DAY 4

Back in the kitchen, everyone looks at Scott...

Is that seriously the end of the story?

Yes. It is.

Young Neil unpauses his Nintendo DS.

So when do we get to meet her?

Oh please. Let it be soon.

DINGY DONG! The doorbell rings. Scott smiles broadly.

That's for me.

5 INT/EXT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 5

An eager Knives stands outside. Scott opens the door a crack.

You promise to be good?

Of course I'll be good!

No, really. Please be good.

Am I normally not?

Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through.

Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen

Stills. He's the talent.

Hey.

STILLS shuts the door on a confused Knives.

Is she gonna geek out on us?

She'll just sit in the corner, man.

I mean, I want her to geek out on us.

She'll geek. She geeks. She has the

capacity to geek.

Stephen Stills quickly opens the door and waves Knives in.

You're good.

6 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 6

Knives enters, looking around the rehearsal pad with awe:

Bare bulb, ratty rug, drums, guitar, bass, LAME BRAND amps.

Wow.

Knives, that's Kim. Lemme get your coat.

Scott throws Knives' coat on the floor. Knives waves.

Hi, sorry, what was your name?

KIM PINE (O.S.)

Kim.

You play the drums?

REVEAL Kim sitting behind the drumset, sticks in her hands.

...yes.

That is so awesome.

Knives, that's Young Neil.

Hi. What do you play?

Uh, wow...Zelda...Tetris...that's

kind of a big question.

Knives stares blankly at Young Neil, who finally gets it.

Oh. I'm not in the band. I just

live here.

Sex Bob-Omb has geared up. Amps hum to life.

Let's start with Launchpad McQuack.

That's not the actual title of the-

WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB! 1-2-3-4!

Kim BASHES the kit and Sex Bob-Omb EXPLODE INTO ROCK! GUITAR

AND BASS LEADS LEAP INTO THE AIR, SPELLING OUT OUR TITLE...

SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD

TITLES continue over the song as the small rehearsal space

seems to GROW with the music. Stephen Stills barks

unintelligable lyrics.

Knives watches, jaw ajar. The song ends, feedback lingering.

You guys...are so...amazing.

7 EXT. BUS STOP - EVENING 7

Scott bids adieu to a stunned Knives as she gets on a bus.

I can't even...Sex Bob-Omb.

Amazing.

8 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' ROOM - EVENING 8

The band and Young Neil lounge around Stephen Stills' room.

She seems nice.

Yeaaah.

She seems awesome.

Yeaaah.

Scott, if your life had a face I

would punch it.

Yeaaah...wait, what?

I mean, are you really happy or are

you really evil?

Like, do I have ulterior motives or

something? I'm offended, Kim.

Hurt, Kim.

You? Hurt?

Scott takes a breath, turns to Young Neil.

Neil, you were saying she seems awesome.

Yeah, she seems awesome.

Yeaaaah...

9 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9

Scott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He

turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal.

"WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!"

Before you hear some dirty lies

from someone else, yes, I'm dating

a 17 year old.

Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading.

Is he cute?

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Does this mean we have to stop

sleeping together?

Do you see another bed in here?

TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the

one room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included.

Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever.

So. The whole seventeen year old

thing. Don't tell too many people.

Hey, you know me.

I mean. Don't tell my sister.

You know me.

Wallace tosses the NOW magazine aside, starts texting.

Who are you texting?

RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up.

STACEY (O.S.)

Seventeen years old? Scandal!

Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on

her cellphone in THE SECOND CUP. A sign behind her reads 'If

you are using your cellphone, you will not be served'.

"STACEY PILGRIM, YOUNGER SISTER, 19, RATING: 'T' FOR TEEN."

That's not true. Who told you?

Wallace. Duh.

That gossipy bitch.

WALLACE (O.S.)

You know me.

Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless.

Wallace!

Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair.

Who is this mysterious child you date?

Her name is Knives. Knives Chau.

A seventeen year old Chinese

schoolgirl? You're ridiculous.

It's a Catholic school too.

With the uniform and everything?

Yeah, the whole deal.

Oh my God, you haven't-

No no no. We haven't even held

hands. I think she hugged me once.

Um, Scott. Why are you doing this?

I don't know...it's just nice, you

know? It's just...simple.

It's been over a year since you got

dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named.

Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine,

looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad.

STACEY (CONT'D)

So, are you legitimately moving on,

or is this just you being insane?

Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next

to a hot redhead in happier times.

Can I get back to you on that?

A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly...

10 EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY 10

Wallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL.

Uniformed boys and girls pour out.

I do not want to be here. At all.

This school has boys too.

I hate you. Even I would think twice

about dating a seventeen year old.

Well, she's only allowed out when

the sun is up, so I wouldn't call

it dating, more like...

That doesn't sound so good either.

KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

Scott! Heyyyy!

Knives skips to Scott. Her shy friend TAMARA lingers behind.

Hey Knives, this is my cool gay

roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay.

Oh, hi! Do you want to know who in

my class is gay?

Yes. Does he wear glasses?

Wallace, you go now! Begone!

Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers.

You're too good for him. Run.

11 INT. THE ARCADE - DAY 11

Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION (think a martial

arts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION).

They punch and kick in unison, side by side.

Did you know the original name of Pac-

man was Puck-man? You would think it's

because Pac-Man looks like a yellow

hockey puck, but actually it comes

from the Japanese phrase paku-paku

which means to flap ones mouth open

and closed. They changed it over here

because Puck-Man is too easy to

vandalize. You know, scratch out the P

and turn it into an F or whatever?

Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move.

Ohmigod, like...wow.

Yeah. Wow.

The game ends. CONTINUE appears, counting down: 10...9...8...

Scott looks at Knives. She digs for quarters.

Oh, I got it!

12 EXT. "PIZZA PIZZA" - DAY 12

Scott and Knives leave a pizza joint, slices in hand.

Tamara is into this Korean guy,

Bobby, but everyone thinks Bobby

has a crush on Mina.

I thought Derek and Tamara had a

mutual like-each-other thing going,

what happened?

A13 INT. THE GOODWILL - DAY A13

Scott and Knives shop for T-shirts. Hangers click in time.

I don't listen to much music. I

know a lot of kids who play piano

or whatever, but you guys ROCK.

I knew I personally rocked, but I

never suspected that we rocked as a

unit. Thank you, Knives.

13 INT. SONIC BOOM (RECORD STORE) - DAY 13

Scott and Knives flip through records in perfect sync.

I mean, you guys are gonna be HUGE.

Well, we're already pretty big. But

it might be cool if cool people

wore our T-shirt.

Knives speaks to a female clerk, surly with tats and specs:

"JULIE, 22, STILLS' GIRLFRIEND, RATING: WHAT IS HER PROBLEM?"

Excuse me, do you have anything by

'The Clash At Demonhead'?

Have you tried the section marked

'The Clash At Demonhead'?

Thank you, Julie.

Are you coming to my party Friday

or will you be busy babysitting?

Thank you, Julie.

You don't want to listen to her.

And you definitely don't want to

listen to them.

Scott puts The Clash at Demonhead CD back in the rack.

Oh, I heart them so much.

I hearted them too until they signed

to a major label and the singer turned

into a total bitch and ruined my life.

But that's just me.

Envy Adams is sooo cool. Do you

read her blog?

Sorry, you were saying about me?

14 EXT. SNOWY TORONTO STREET - DAY 14

Scott and Knives amble down a snow covered sidewalk.

I mean, I've...I've never gone out

with someone so talented.

You go out with a lot of guys?

...no.

Yeah, so whatever, man!

I've never even kissed a guy.

Knives blushes and looks at the ground. Scott hugs her.

Me neither.

15 EXT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - DAY 15

Scott and Knives walk up to the front of Wallace's apartment.

So this is your secret lair? Can I

come in?

My secret lair is one of those 'no

girls allowed' deals.

Oh, okay.

But do you want to see the house

where I grew up?

Sure.

They literally walk across the street to a small house.

Here you go.

Wow.

Yeah. Wow.

Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand...

16 EXT. THE DREAM DESERT - HOTTEST DAY 16

...Scott wanders alone through a barren land. He falls to his

knees next to a lonely cactus.

Oh God...so...so alone.

A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She

wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink

hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun.

You're not alone. You're just

having some idiotic dream.

Does that mean we can make out?

But she's gone...

17 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - ? 17

...SCOTT WAKES UP, sitting up in the FUTON.

Oh God...

Wallace wakes up to the left of Scott, rubbing his eyes.

What is it, Scott?

I had this totally weird dream.

Oh God.

What is it, Scott?

A scruffy, goateed guy wakes right between Scott and Wallace:

"OTHER SCOTT, 22, WALLACE'S BOYFRIEND? FUN FACT: GUY CURIOUS"

Can we skip the dreamtime? Color me

not interested.

But there was this girl...

Girl?

Was this an Envy related dream?

We don't use the E-word in this house.

No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new...

Yay for that.

Other Scott goes back to sleep. Wallace rubs his eyes.

Speaking of new, weren't you

supposed to take your fake high

school girlfriend to the library a

half-hour ago?

What? It's like, six in the morning.

Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room.

Arrrrgh!

18 INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY 18

What's wrong?

Scott is noticeably taller than all the teens in the library.

He carries a stack of books for Knives.

Libraries remind me of grade school.

That must seem like a reeeeally

long time ago.

Uh. Let's talk about something else.

The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He

freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM

skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION.

Do you know that girl?

The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to

the librarian. Scott's gaze follows the GIRL as she blades

out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts.

Scott?

Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl.

STEPHEN STILLS (O.S.)

SCOTT!

19 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - EVENING 19

Scott stands in the rehearsal room, head still in the clouds.

You only played one note for that

entire song.

It was...uh...my hand slipped.

Is your girlfriend distracting you?

My girlfriend?

A meek Knives sits next to Young Neil on the couch.

I'll... I'll be quieter.

Let's do that one again.

Sorry, what are we doing?

20 EXT. TORONTO RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 20

I told you like fifty times!

Scott, Kim Pine, Stephen Stills and Young Neil walk down an

icy Toronto street. Scott's head is still in the clouds.

We're going to this party, retard.

Party?

At Julie's.

Ugh. I thought you guys split.

We did. But, you know, there may be

some label guys there, so...

Aw, man. This is going to suck.

At least it will give us something

to complain about.

Awww maaan...

21 INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21

A bored Scott stands next to Young Neil in a very crowded

house party. Both have red plastic cups in hand.

...this sucks.

Sucks.

I'm going to go pee due to boredom.

Scott exits frame.

I have to pee.

Neil sips his drink.

Scott passes by COMEAU, a bespectacled hipster geek:

' COMEAU, 25, FUN FACT: KNOWS EVERYONE (INCLUDING YOU)'

Hey Comeau.

Hey Scott. Some party huh? You

gettin' your drink on?

This is Coke Zero. I don't drink.

You don't drink? I remember you

getting ridiculously drunk off two

G&T's one time and-

Comeau, you know everyone, right?

Pretty much.

Do you know this one girl with hair

like this?

Scott sketches an incomprehensible drawing of Ramona.

Yeah man. Ramona Flowers. Someone

said she was coming tonight actually.

WHAT?

You got the hots for her? I hear

she's hardcore...

Scott has already left a Scott-shaped dust cloud...

22 INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 22

Scott scans the party. His eyes go WIDE. He CRUSHES his

plastic cup. There she is...playing the wall...RAMONA! Aloof.

Enigmatic. Hot. Scott sidles up and stands next to her.

Hey, what's up?

Nothing.

Hey, you know Pacman?

I know of him.

Scott begins to babble.

Well you know Pac-Man was

originally Puckman but not because

Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck

and paku-paku-paku means flapping

your mouth and they changed it

because if you scratch out the "P"

and turn it into an "F'? You know?

Like...

Yeah that's amazing.

Um...am I dreaming?

Ramona looks at Scott blankly. He slowly skulks away.

I'll leave you alone forever now.

"THEN HE STALKED HER FOR THE REST OF THE PARTY..."

Series of quick shots as Scott follows Ramona. He ducks

around corners, spies from behind a much bigger dude. Ramona

leaves the party. Scott grabs a startled Young Neil.

DUDE!

WHA?

SHE'S TOTALLY REAL!

WHO!?

RAMONA FLOWERS!

WHUH?

JUMP CUT. Scott RUNS towards Comeau.

DUDE. What do you know about Ramona

Flowers?!

All I know is she's American.

American...

But you should talk to Sandra and

"SANDRA AND MONIQUE, 24, TWO GIRLS COMEAU KNOWS"

LADYDUDES! What do you know about

Ramona Flowers?

I think she has a boyfriend.

Some guy back in New York.

Doesn't she have the most

ridiculous name?

I know. It's so 'Ramona Quimby,

Aged 8' and yet...Flowers.

The girls laugh. Scott does not.

Yeah. What else?

JUMP CUT through a FLURRY OF FACES as Scott asks everyone

I heard she kicks all kind of ass.

She's on another level.

She's got men dying at her feet.

She's got some battle scars.

Not to be entered into lightly

We end on the surly JULIE (the rude clerk) who steps in front

of Scott, arms crossed. Stephen Stills is with her.

What about Ramona Flowers?

You know her? Tell me. Now.

She just moved here. Got a job with

Amazon. Comes into my work.

Does she really?

Didn't you say she just broke up

with someone, Jools?

Did she reeally?

That they had a huge fight or whatever?

Did they reeeally?

...yes. But I didn't want Scott to

know that, Stephen.

Yeah, I don't know what it is about

that girl, she just-

Scott, I forbid you from hitting on

Ramona. Even if you haven't had a

real girlfriend in over a year-

Hey whoa, whoa. Scott's mourning

period is officially over. He's

totally dating a high schooler.

Dating a high schooler is the

mourning period.

She's got a point.

I thought you guys broke up.

I don't want you scaring off the

coolest girl at my party Scott. We

all know you're a total lady killer

wannabe jerky jerk.

That's garbage! Completely untrue.

That time with Lisa-

Misunderstanding.

That time with Hollie-

Not what it looked like!

That time you dumped Kim for-

Hey, me and Kim are all good now.

SCOTT looks to KIM. We hear the sound of arctic winds.

Whatever, Ramona is out of your

league, let's leave it at that.

And anyway, I'm not even sure she

really did have a big breakup. She

keeps mentioning some guy named

Gideon.

Yeah, I don't know what it is about

that girl, she just-

Forget it Scott!!!

23 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 23

Scott lies on the futon, WIDE awake. Wallace storms in.

Guess who's druuunk?

I guess Wallace.

You guess right.

Wallace flops onto the futon, landing next to Scott.

So, that girl. From my dream.

Girl. Okay...

I saw her at the library...

Library...can I pretend we're

talking about a guy?

So then I'm at this party, and hey!

There she is.

There he is.

I think she's...

You think he's...

I think she's the girl of my dreams.

Mmm. Then you should break up with

your fake high school girlfriend.

I've never been so sure about

something.

Then you should break up with your

fake high school girlfriend.

What's that?

Break...up...fake...high

school...girlfriend...

I'm not getting it, friend.

Wallace drifts off. RINGY RING! Scott answers. INTERCUT with

STACEY sitting on a bus on her cellphone.

You're thinking of juggling two chicks!?

Not even!

Well, you should break up with your

fake high school girlfriend.

Wait. Who told you?

Duh. Wallace.

He's not even conscious!

Whatever. You of all people should know

how sucky it is to get cheated on.

Don't you have a job to do?

You're right. I should send out a

mass text about this. Bye.

Scott looks to Wallace, who is out cold, cellphone in hand.

Wallace, how do you do that?

HARD CUT to MORNING LIGHT filling the room!

SCOTT (O.S.)

WALLACE!

Wallace sits bolt upright. Scott sits at Wallace's computer.

Amazon.ca. What's the website for that?

...Amazon.ca.

Awesome! I have to order something

reeeally cool.

"You've got mail!"

Dude! This thing claims I have mail!

It's amazing what they can do with

computers these days.

Dude! Now I'm reading it!

I'm so happy for you.

"Dear Mr. Pilgrim, It has come to

my attention that we will be

fighting soon. My name is Matthew

Patel, and I'm" blah blah 'fair

warning' blah blah...hmm. This

is...this is...THIS IS...!!!

WHAT?!

This is boring. Delete!

'CLICK.' Scott walks to the front door. Moments pass.

Scott. Are you waiting for the

package you just ordered?

It's the weekend. It won't ship

until Monday at the earliest.

DINGY DONG. Scott JUMPS to his feet.

You were saying?

Scott opens the door. It's KNIVES CHAU!

Heyyy...

Attack hug!

Knives smothers Scott.

Attack hug. That's cute.

He plasters on his best fake smile.

Remember you were supposed to meet

me at the bus stop a half-hour ago?

How could I possibly forget?

24 INT. SONIC BOOM - DAY 24

Scott and Knives flip through the record bins, out of sync.

Yearbook club is getting SO boring.

I cannot believe the music they put

on while we work.

That's sucky.

25 INT. THE GOODWILL - DAY 25

Knives buys a hip and trendy jacket. Scott sits on a couch

next to the DO NOT SIT sign, still distracted.

Hannah broke up with Alan and now

she's all into Derek...

Uh huh.

26 EXT. PIZZA PIZZA - DAY 26

Scott and Knives walk out of a pizza joint. Knives chows down

on a slice. Scott doesn't eat, his thoughts elsewhere.

...but Tamara claims she has dibs

on Derek.

I tell ya'.

27 INT. THE ARCADE - DAY 27

Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION, side by side.

Scott plays halfheartedly, his timing off.

Combo!

Knives goes to flip over Scott, but he messes up. THE MIRROR

IMAGE of Scott's videogame avatar appears on screen.

Uh oh, NegaNinja.

NEGANINJA - squares up against Scott's avatar.

I can never get past that guy.

Scott has his little videogame head cut off. The 'CONTINUE?'

countdown comes up...10...9...8...

Do you want to keep going?

Scott takes a long look at Knives.

Um, I think...I think...

Scott takes a deep breath. This is never easy. 3...2...1...

28 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - EVENING 28

Game on, everybody. Game. On.

An excited Stills addresses Sex Bob-Omb. Scott tunes his

bass, alone by the window, staring out.

I got us a show.

KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

OH MY GOSH WHEN?!

Knives BURSTS into frame. Scott winces.

Wednesday, The Rockit. And even

better? It's the T.I.B.B.

The Toronto International Battle of

The Bands?!

S'right. This guy at work was like

"Steve, do you know anyone in a

band?" and I was like 'I'm in a

band' and he was like 'You're in a

band?' and I was like 'Yeah I'm

totally in a band'-

Great story, man.

Is there a prize or something?!

Only a record deal with G-man Graves!

What? Who?

You don't know?

Indie Producer of the millennium?!

Oh.

Whoa.

Stills gestures to Knives' home-made Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.

If we win...it won't just be Knives

wearing a Sex Bob-Omb shirt. It'll

be the cool kids too.

Knives can barely contain herself. She grabs Scott.

I will do everything I can to get

out of study group and come.

Sure. Great.

We follow Scott as he walks in a daze to the bathroom.

KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

Oh my gosh, who are you battling?

STEPHEN STILLS (O.S.)

Crash and the Boys.

YOUNG NEIL (O.S.)

That one band with Crash? And

those Boys?

Yeah that's the one.

I hate them!

KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

Oh my gosh, I hate them too!

STEPHEN STILLS (O.S.)

Yeah, they suck.

29 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE, BATHROOM - EVENING 29

Scott pees in a state of dreamy reverie. The PEE BAR above

his head slowly reduces. He stares at himself in the mirror.

Scott exits the bathroom, entering...

30 INT. DREAM HIGH SCHOOL - ? 30

...a long, empty HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY. Scott's footsteps echo

as he moves towards a classroom door with a STAR on it...

RAMONA FLOWERS bursts through the door, skating past Scott

and down the hall, PACKAGE from AMAZON clutched in her hand.

Scott runs after her, around a corner, down a row of LOCKERS

leading to...the outside of WALLACE'S APARTMENT???

31 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING 31

Scott LEAPS out of the futon and RUNS towards the front door,

THROWING IT OPEN and startling Ramona Flowers just as she

presses the doorbell. DINGY DONG...

Hi, um, I was thinking about asking

you out, but then I realized how

stupid that would be.

Do you want to go out sometime?

Um, no, that's okay. You just have

to sign for this alright?

I just woke up, and you were in my

dream. I dreamt you were delivering

me this package. Is that weird?

It's not weird at all.

It's not?

No, it's just like, you've got this

really convenient subspace highway

running through your head that I

like to use. It's like three miles

in fifteen seconds.

Right...

Oh yeah. I forgot you guys don't

have that in Canada.

You don't remember me do you? I met

you at the party the other day.

Were you the Pac-Man guy?

No. Not even. That was some total

ass. I was the other guy. You're

Ramona Flowers right?

That's me.

So, you're like American?

Why, am I coming off as rude?

Not at all. Noooooo...

Scott stands in awe of Ramona. She gives him a pen.

You know...you need to sign for

this. Whatever this is?

It's something really cool. You'd

be impressed.

You still have to sign.

But if I sign for it, you'll leave.

Yeah. That's how it works.

Okay well, can we just maybe just

hang out sometime? Get to know each

other? You're the new kid on the

block, right? I've lived here

forever. I mean...there are reasons

for you to hang out with me?

You're all over the place.

You are like...my dream girl.

I need to find a new route.

Either that or you need to start

hanging out with me.

You want me to hang out with you?

Um...you know...if that's cool.

If I say yes, will you sign for

your damn package?

Scott finally signs on the dotted line. And throws the

package straight in the trash.

Done. So, yeah. Eight o'clock?

32 OMITTED [INTEGRATED INTO SC 34] 32

34 EXT. PARK - NIGHT 34

Scott finds Ramona waiting at the top of some stairs in the

park. The Toronto skyline gleams in the night behind them.

Why are you just standing there?

Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.

Sorry, I just assumed you were too

cool to be on time.

Well. You assumed wrong.

So what do you want to do? We could

get a slice at Pizza Pizza or flip

through some records at Sonic Boom.

Oh, or there's this awesome game

called Ninja Ninja Revolution at-

I'm not into simulated violence.

I'm cool with whatever you want to do.

This is good.

Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park.

This is good. So how'd you end up in

Toronto?

Just needed to escape I guess.

Oh yeah?

I got this job here. And Gideon had

always said Toronto was one of the

great cities so...

Is Gideon...is he your boyfriend?

He's...a friend.

Was he your boyfriend?

Do you mind if we don't get into

that right now?

It's so not interesting to me.

They sit on some swings in the park.

So what about you? What do you do?

I'm between jobs.

Between what and what?

My last job is a long story filled

with sighs.

I know plenty of those.

Is that why you left New York?

Pretty much. It was time to head

somewhere a little more chilled.

Well, it's certainly chilled here.

Yeah.

Uh. Chilled as in cold.

Yeah.

I'm totally obsessed with you.

I didn't mean to get you obsessed.

I just haven't been obsessed with a

girl for a long time. It's weird.

That's probably because you sleep

with a guy.

Um...

I was guessing from your apartment,

but you totally do!

It's... we're just poor! We can't

afford two beds! We're not gay!

Actually... no... Wallace is pretty

gay.

Dude, relax. I believe you. You're

too desperate to be gay.

I feel so stupid.

Aw... you're probably not that

stupid.

Laughing, Ramona hops off her swing.

I'm... mostly stupid.

Well, you're definitely stupid if

you want to go out with me.

Exactly, yeah.

The snowfall gets heavier.

This is ridiculous. Isn't it like April?

Yeah. I can barely see you. This whole

thing is an unmitigated disaster.

I think 'act of God' is a pretty

decent excuse for a lousy date.

So this is a 'date', eh?

Did I say 'date'? Slip of the tongue.

Tongue...

The snow gets heavier still. Ramona walks away.

Anyway, night's not over yet. I think

there's a thingy up here somewhere.

A door? I... I... I can't see you.

I'm blind. Help me.

A door with a STAR on it appears out of the whiteness. Ramona

opens the door. Scott and Ramona fall into blackness...

35 INT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 35

Scott shivers at the kitchen table of Ramona's cozy, girl

friendly apartment. He watches as she slips out of her coat.

What kind of tea do you want?

There's more than one kind?

We have blueberry, raspberry,

ginseng, sleepytime, green tea, green

tea with lemon, green tea with lemon

and honey, liver disaster, ginger

with honey, ginger without honey,

vanilla almond, white truffle,

blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut,

constant comment and earl grey.

Did you make some of those up?

I think I'll have sleepytime.

That sounds good to me.

Let me get you a blanket.

That would actually be awesome.

Ramona exits. After a moment alone, Scott ventures upstairs.

He wanders towards a half open door. Pushing it open, he

finds Ramona in her bedroom in her bra and skirt.

Dude! I'm changing.

Scott covers his eyes and our screen goes BLACK.

SCOTT (O.S.)

AAAH! Sorry, I'm just...cold!

RAMONA (O.S.)

Here, does this help?

SCOTT (O.S.)

That's...very warm. What is that?

Scott opens his eyes to see Ramona hugging him.

Ohh...kay.

They look into each others eyes...camera circles Scott and

Ramona as they begin an awesome make out session. Scott

imagines himself soundtracking the kiss with a slinky bassline.

Ramona breaks off, smiling. Scott is in heaven.

Were you..were you just going to

bring the blanket from your bed?

I guess...

Maybe...maybe we should both get

under it...since we're so cold.

Well...what about our tea?

I can...not have tea.

The slinky bassline continues as Ramona takes her skirt off,

revealing black panties to complement black bra. Scott takes

his shirt off. They tumble onto the bed and make out. Then-

I changed my mind.

Changed it to what? From what?

I don't want to have sex with you,

Pilgrim. Not right now.

Ohh...kay.

It's not like I'm gonna send you

home in a snowstorm or anything.

You can sleep in my bed. And I

reserve the right to change my mind

about the sex later.

Ramona curls up next to Scott.

This is cool, just this. It's been

like a really long time, and this

is...I think I needed this.

Whatever this is. So, thanks.

You're welcome.

They exchange a smile. Then without warning we jump cut to -

36 INT. RAMONA'S ROOM - MORNING 36

DAYLIGHT! Scott awakens. Ramona is gone. An arrow points to

the empty spot in the bed next to him.

'NO RAMONA'

Another arrow point out that-

'SHE'S IN THE SHOWER'

Ramona steps out of the bathroom in a towel. Scott relaxes.

I have to work.

Work?

You have to leave.

37 EXT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - MORNING 37

Ramona skates towards the front gate, Scott walking next to

her. WAIST DEEP SNOW covers the roads and sidewalks.

Hey, can this not be a one night

stand? For one thing, I didn't even

get any...that was a joke.

What did you have in mind?

Umm...oh, come to the first round

of this battle of the bands thing.

You have a band?

Yeah, we're terrible. Please come.

Ramona shrugs and ROLLERBLADES through the snow...(somehow)

Wait! Can I get your number?

SSSSHHHOOP! Ramona skids to a stop, right back next to Scott.

She hands him a note. ' RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx'

Wow, girl number.

Scott looks back up. Ramona is already skating far, far away.

See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim.

Oh, hey! It's tonight...At The-

38 INT. THE ROCKIT - NIGHT 38

'THE ROCKIT, FUN FACT: THIS PLACE IS A TOILET'.

Ramona wades through a grungy venue under the stare of young

hipsters, reaching Scott at the bar. He stands with Wallace

and Stacey. She holds hands with a guy wearing glasses.

You totally came!

Yes. I did totally come.

Scott is so amazed at her presence, his social skills vanish.

Excuse my brother. He's chronically

enfeebled. I'm Stacey.

Hey.

And this is Wallace, his room-mate.

Hey.

And this is my boyfriend Jimmy.

(staring at Jimmy)

Heyyy.

And this is Knives, Scott's-

Scott goes white. He didn't even see Knives come in.

HEYYYYYYYY!

Hey.

Knives pecks Scott on the cheek. He pushes her away. Knives

looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes.

Do you like?

I...uh...

LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives

and Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

Have. To. Go.

Scott scurries off. We hear feedback from a mic onstage.

PROMOTER (O.S)

This next band are from Brampton

and they are Crash And The Boys.

39 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 39

Scott runs backstage to see Stills obsessively flipping

through a chart with hand drawn stats of their rival band.

This is a nightmare. Is this a

nightmare? Wake up, wake up, wake up.

Once we're on stage you'll be fine.

We were just on stage. For sound

check. The sound guy hated us.

It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters.

People love us. Right?

Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and

Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY.

40 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 40

Crash and The Boys tune up. A drunk Wallace turns to Jimmy.

Jimmy. Do they rock or suck?

They...haven't started playing yet.

That was a test, Jimmy. You passed.

Good evening. I am Crash, and these

are the Boys.

IS THAT GIRL A BOY, TOO?

Yes.

TRASHA, 8 year old girl drummer, gives Wallace the finger.

A41 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS A41

Sex Bob-omb peer at the band from offstage. Kim glowers.

They have a girl drummer?

B41 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS B41

This is called "I am so sad. I am

so very very sad." And it goes a

little something like this.

Crash and the Boys play a whole song in .04 seconds.

Thank you.

Wallace yells from the balcony.

IT'S NOT A RACE, GUYS!

This song is for the guy who keeps

yelling from the balcony, and it's

called "We Hate You, Please Die."

Sweet! I love this one!

B41 CONTINUED: B41

Crash continues his rampage of musical hate.

41 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 41

These guys are good. Are these guys

good?

Kim Pine scowls harder than ever.

These guys are good.

42 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 42

This is called "Last Song Kills

Audience". It'll be our last song

tonight and your last song EVER...

Sound explodes from the stage. The audience are stunned.

43 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 43

Stills paces backstage as the others watch the band.

How are we supposed to follow this?

We're not going to win, we're not

gonna sign with G-Man and we'll

never play opening night at the

Chaos Theatre.

GODDAMN IT SCOTT, WILL YOU STOP

JUST STANDING THERE, YOU'RE

FREAKING ME OUT!

44 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 44

As Crash And The Boys climax, Stacey turns to Ramona.

So, how do you know Scott?

He's...um. He's a friend.

Hard for me to keep track

sometimes. He has so many friends.

Ramona arches an eyebrow. Stacey turns to Knives and Tamara.

So Knives, how did you meet Scott?

45 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 45

Scott looks up into the balcony, sees Stacey talking to

Knives. He turns around and slaps Stephen Stills in the face.

We gotta play now and loud!

46 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 46

Stacey and Ramona listen intently to Knives' story.

Well, I was on the bus with my Mom-

Knives freezes, staring at the stage.

Is that seriously the end of the story?

OH MY GOSH, they're on!

47 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 47

ONSTAGE: A DISHEVELED PROMOTER walks to the mic.

This next band is from Toronto

and...yeah. So give it up for

Sex...Bob-Omb?

SEX BOB-OMB walk on. Wallace and Knives give the only cheers.

Scott...you ready?

Scott nods vigorously.

Kim...you rea-

WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB. ONE, TWO...

ANGLE on Knives. She faints in the excitement.

KIM PINE (CONT'D)

THREE, FOUR!

Sex Bob-omb rock out, barely into the first verse when a

chunk of ceiling CRASHES down and a SPINDLY INDIAN HIPSTER

KID DIVES HEAD FIRST through the hole, finger pointed at

Scott as he sails towards the stage!

MATTHEW PATEL lands onstage and glares at Scott through a

lopsided fringe. He wears an evil grin and a jacket that

borders on flamboyant. He drags on a cigarette (blacked out).

Mr. Pilgrim. It is I, Matthew

Patel. Consider our fight...begun!

What did I do?

Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott.

What do I do?!

FIGHT!

Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his

left arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right.

Patel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott.

Alright. Alright.

Watch out! It's that one guy!

Thank you, Wallace!

Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and

sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking

hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle.

You're quite the opponent, Pilgrim.

Who the hell are you anyway?

The LIGHTING GUY spotlights the fighters.

My name is Matthew Patel and I'm

Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend!

You're what?

Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend!

All eyes WHIP up to Ramona...

Anyone need another drink?

Patel attacks Scott with spin kicks. Scott blocks. Patel

punches. Scott blocks, then holds his hand up for a time-out.

We're fighting because of Ramona?

Didn't you get my e-mail explaining

the situation?

I skimmed it.

You will pay for your insolence!

Patel attacks, landing kicks and punches. Scott evades and

counter-attacks. Patel evades, then lands more punches. Scott

jump-spins away from danger. They pause, breathing heavy.

What's up with his outfit?

Yeah! Is he a pirate?

Scott looks at Patel's outfit.

Are you a pirate?

Pirates are in this year!

Patel attacks again. They exchange furious blows, until Patel

puts Scott in a choke hold. Scott looks up to Ramona.

You really went out with this guy?

Yeah, in the seventh grade.

The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the

balcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK.

It was football season and for some

reason, all the little jocks wanted

me. Matthew was the only non-white,

non-jock boy in school, probably in

the entire state, so we joined

forces and took 'em all out. We

were one hell of a team. Nothing

could beat Matthew's mystical

powers. Nothing but pre-teen

capriciousness. We only kissed

once. After a week and a half, I

told him to hit the showers.

The spotlight swings back onto Scott and Patel.

Dude, wait...mystical powers?

Patel levitates into the air and points at Ramona.

You'll pay for this, Flowers!

Patel SNAPS his fingers and launches into a BOLLYWOOD SONG!

MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)

If you want to fight me, you're not

the brightest. You won't know

what's hit you in the slightest.

Patel levitates into the air. Four hot girls in skirts with

fangs and bat-wings appear in the air around him.

MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)

Me and my fireballs and my Demon

Hipster Chicks, I'm talking the

talk because I know I'm slick.

Patel and the Demon Hipster Chicks shoot FIREBALLS at Scott.

He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack.

MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)

Fireball Girls! Take this sucker

down.

The Demon Hipster Chicks unleash more fireballs. Scott

dodges. The house drum kit is trashed behind him.

MATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D)

Let us show him what we're all

about.

Scott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs.

They explode Crash and the Boys in the wings.

That doesn't even rhyme.

Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and

throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the

eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish.

This is impossible, how can it be?!

Scott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time

to see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face.

Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see.

K.O! Scott punches Patel. He explodes into COINS. They

clatter to the stage floor. Scott lands and picks them up.

Sweet. Coins.

48 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 48

Ramona makes her way out fast. Passes Stacey.

Well, it was great meeting you.

Tell your gay friends I said bye.

Gay friends?

Stacey turns to see Wallace and Jimmy making out.

WALLACE?! Not again!

Ramona passes Knives, who is being resuscitated by Tamara.

49 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 49

Scott picks up the coins onstage and counts them.

Aw man. $2.40? That's not even

enough for the bus home.

I'll lend you the 30 cents.

Ramona yanks Scott away. The Promotor ambles back onstage.

Yeah...so like, Sex Bob-Omb wins.

50 INT. THE ROCKIT, BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 50

Knives is now wide awake, clapping wildly from the balcony.

Her eyes scan the venue for Scott...but he is long gone.

51 INT. THE BUS - NIGHT 51

Sooooooo...

A bemused Scott and mortified Ramona sit on the bus home.

What was all that all about?

Uh, I guess...

Ramona takes a breath. Looks deep into Scott's eyes.

RAMONA (CONT'D)

If we're going to date, you may

have to defeat my seven evil ex's.

You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?

Seven ex's, yes.

So I have to fight-

Defeat.

-defeat your seven evil ex's if

we're going to continue to date.

Pretty much.

So, what you're saying is...

We are dating?

Uh, I guess.

Cool. Do you want to make out?

Uh...

Scott kisses Ramona. The studio audience 'awwww's.

53 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING 53

A bleary Wallace fries bacon. Scott bursts through the front

door, a spring in his step. The studio audience applauds.

Someone's happy.

Well, someone got to second base

last night. And someone has a

second date tonight.

Someone's lucky then.

You know when I say ' someone', I mean

me, right? I got to second base last

night...maybe first and a half.

Wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat Scott.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

Oh, hey, I'm inviting Ramona over for

dinner, so you can't be here tonight.

I don't want you gaying up the place.

Okay, Scott. But in return I have

to issue an ultimatum.

One of your famous ultimatums?

It may live in infamy...You have to

break up with Knives. Today. Okay?

Scott huffs and helps himself to some of Wallace's bacon.

But...but...it's HARD.

If you don't do it, I'm going to

tell Ramona about Knives. I swear

to God, Scott.

But you...you're...

At this point a sleepy JIMMY wanders out of the bathroom and

helps himself to coffee.

Morning.

Scott points bacon at Wallace accusingly.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

DOUBLE STANDARD!

I didn't make up the gay rulebook.

If you have a problem with it, take

it up with Liberace's Ghost.

You're a monster.

Now put the bacon down and go do

your dirt while I watch the Lucas

Lee marathon on TBS Superstation.

Who's Lucas Lee?

Wallace points to a hunky actor on the cover of NOW magazine.

He was this pretty good skater and

now he's this pretty good actor.

He's filming a Winifred Hailey

movie in Toronto right now.

They make movies in Toronto?

Yes. I am stalking him later.

So, this Lucas Lee-

Lucas Lee is not important to you

right now! Get out.

You suck. Surprising no one.

Scott grumbles off. Wallace turns the television way up. We

see Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller.

LUCAS LEE (ON TV)

Listen close and listen hard,

bucko. The next click is me hanging

up. The one after that...is me

pulling the trigger.

54 EXT. PAYPHONE ON BUSY STREET - DAY 54

A shivering and annoyed Scott dials the payphone.

Oh, hey, Knives. Um, do you want

to, like, talk or whatever?

KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

Are you wearing a tan jacket? Like

a spring jacket? And a hoodie?

Ummm...

Scott checks what he's wearing. SPOOKY MUSIC underscores.

KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

And a dorky hat?!

It's not dorky! Why are you psychic?

A beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass.

Oh. Uh...okay. Hi.

55 INT. SONIC BOOM - DAY 55

The SPOOKY MUSIC continues on in the record store.

Scott is on edge as Knives geeks over a standee for THE CLASH

AT DEMONHEAD: it features sultry blonde singer ENVY ADAMS

posing and the rest of the band shrouded in shadow and mist.

I can't believe they're coming to

town. Will you take me to the show?

Yeah, listen-

The SPOOKY MUSIC gets louder, pounding inside Scott's head.

Oh, hey, I wanted to invite you

over for dinner.

Like, Chinese food?

Yeah.

Hmm. It's not my favorite.

Yeah. Well, to meet my parents.

It's my birthday dinner.

Uh...I think that's a really bad

idea. Like, really, just so bad.

No, it's okay. Why?

Well I mean, I'm too old for you!

No you're not! My Dad is nine years

older than my Mom...

And...and...are you even allowed to

date outside your race or whatever?

I don't care. I'm in...LOVE!

Knives is so smitten, the word actually appears onscreen.

Scott brushes it away. The SPOOKY MUSIC comes to a stop.

Um, listen...I was thinking we

should break up or whatever.

Really?

Yeah...um...it's not going to work out.

Oh...

Scott walks out, leaving Knives in the aisle.

56 INT. THE BUS / RECORD STORE - DAY 56

Scott sits on the bus alone, thinking about Knives.

CROSSCUT with Knives still in the record store, in shock.

ON THE BUS: Scott sighs, thinks of something happier...

CROSSCUT with Ramona: rollerblading, her funky pink hair.

ON THE BUS: Scott smiles, a little happier.

57 INT/EXT. STEPHEN STILLS' BASEMENT - EVENING 57

Sex Bob-Omb tune up. Kim spins a drumstick in her fingers.

Where's Knives? Not coming tonight?

Oh. No. We broke up.

Young Neil PAUSES his DS. Kim and Stills share a look.

OH! Check it out, I learned the

bass line from Final Fantasy 2.

Scott plays the insanely simple video game tune.

Scott, you are the salt of the earth.

Aw, thanks.

Wait. I meant scum of the earth.

Aw, thanks.

You...you broke up with Knives?

Yeah, but don't worry, maybe you'll

meet my new new girlfriend soon.

Newnew.

Kim mimes shooting herself. Stills unplugs Scott's amp.

Okay! From here on out, no

GIRLFRIENDS or GIRLFRIEND talk at

practice, whether they're old, new

or new-new. We were lucky to

survive that last round. This is

sudden death now. Okay?

Okay!

DINGY DONG...

That's for me.

Scott opens the door to see Ramona, now sporting BLUE HAIR.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

Hey...you're here?

Yes. Like you said. Is it not cool?

Scott ushers her in, weirded out by this hair development.

You know your hair?

I know of it.

It's all blue.

Yeah. I just dyed it. Are you going

to introduce me?

Oh yeah, this is Stephen Stills,

Young Neil, that's... Kim.

Hey everyone.

Everyone mumbles back. Scott still stares at Ramona's hair.

Is it weird not being pink anymore?

I change my hair every week and a

half, dude. Get used to it.

(to Sex Bob-Omb)

So...uh...how do you guys all know

each other?

High school, I guess?

What Neil said.

I'm Neil.

Believe it or not, I actually dated

Scott in high school.

Got any embarassing stories?

Yeah. He's an idiot.

Scott fake laughs. Starts ushering Ramona out again.

Okay. Cool. See you guys tomorrow.

Uh, what about rehearsal?

Neil knows my parts.

I'm Neil.

58 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 58

Ramona lounges, reading a magazine. A tense Scott hurries

around the kitchen area, preparing food as Wallace looks on.

Are you doing okay there?

Yeah, good. Good.

Ramona goes to the bathroom. Scott drops the act.

She changed her hair.

So? It looks nice blue.

I know, but she changed it without

even making a big deal about it.

She's spontaneous. Impulsive.

Fickle. Oh my god, what do I do?

I can't believe you were worried

about me gaying up the place.

Ramona returns. Wallace pulls on a jacket.

How's dinner coming along?

Yeah, good. Good.

I'll leave you lovebirds to it. I'm

heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my

hetero crush.

Scott stops Wallace at the door, with a panicked whisper.

Don't go.

Will you man the hell up? You could

get to 2nd and a half base.

You think so?

Well, if you strike out in the next

hour, come find me at the Castle.

'If I strike out'?

Okay, 'when'. See you in sixty.

'15 MINUTES LATER'

Ramona and Scott eat on the floor, picnic style. Scott has

cooked garlic bread (and only garlic bread) for dinner.

This is actually really good garlic bread.

Garlic bread is my favorite food. I

could honestly eat it for every

meal. Or just all the time without

even stopping.

You'd get fat.

No. Why would I get fat?

Bread makes you fat.

Bread makes you FAT??

'15 MINUTES LATER'

A nervy Scott serenades Ramona on his bass guitar.

So I wrote a song about you.

Oh yeah?

Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona,

Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona,

Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh.

I can't wait to hear it when it's

finished.

Finished?

'15 MINUTES LATER'

Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon. Scott smiles as she

runs her hands through his hair.

Your hair's pretty shaggy.

OH GOD! I NEED A HAIRCUT DON'T I?!?

Scott sits up like a shot. Ramona is taken aback.

What?

Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I

got... I got a bad haircut right

before me and my big ex broke up. But

it's so long ago, I can barely

remember it...

A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep.

Scott is acutely aware that his last

salon haircut took place exactly 431

days ago, three hours before his big

breakup. He blames this largely on the

haircut and has been cutting his own

hair ever since.

Sounds like a bad time.

Not really.

It was.

It was a mutual thing.

It wasn't.

I mean, she told me it was mutual.

She dumped him. It was brutal.

What was her name?

She was Nat when I knew her. But

she stopped liking that name.

Then...she stopped liking me...

Your hair is cute. I like it long.

But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?!

Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing

his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps.

What? Why are you wearing that?

I thought we could go for a walk.

59 EXT. ENDLESS STAIRWAY - NIGHT 59

'15 MINUTES LATER'

Scott and Ramona climb a STAIRWAY, long handrail between them.

Tell me we didn't come out here

just so you could cover your hair

with that hat.

Nooo. I just love me some walking.

Putting one leg in front of the other.

You seem a little...heightened.

Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm

with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not

that I do drugs, unless you do, in

which case I do drugs all the time,

every drug, but...you make me feel...I

don't know. Things seem a little

brighter around you or something.

Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and

NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line.

What is this place?

A totally awesome castle. They're

shooting this movie up here.

Ramona looks up at the looming CASA LOMA, a castle surrounded

by big, bright movie set lights.

Who's in it?

Winifred Hailey and some actor guy.

Oh, who?

I forget. Let's find out.

60 EXT. CASA LOMA - CONTINUOUS 60

A crew readies a shot of WINIFRED HAILEY held hostage by some

GOON. A STAND IN takes the place of the leading man. Scott

and Ramona approach some SPECTATORS, including Wallace.

Did you find the guy you're stalking?

I think I'm about to right now.

FIRST A.D.

Mr. Lee is travelling!

Mr. Lee?

Lucas Lee.

Ooh.

Ooh?

The UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FANFARE announces LUCAS LEE as he exits

his trailer, smoking a cigarette (blacked out). He skates

towards the set, doing kickflips. The spectators go 'oooh'.

I want to have his adopted babies.

Oh, man. We gotta go.

What? Why?

I used to date that clown.

Slut.

Wallace. I am not a slut.

I can think of no higher accolade.

Lucas steps to his mark and puffs up into action hero mode.

Action.

Lucas Lee points his board at the GOON.

Oh...my...God...

Hey. The only thing keeping me and

her apart is the two minutes it's

gonna take to kick your ass.

...you dated a FAMOUS guy?!

In 9th grade. We had drama. Actually,

it might have been math. I just

remember there being lots of drama.

HEY!!!

Lucas Lee points at Scott, who remains oblivious.

He just followed me around. He was

a little snot nosed brat.

He had snot? In his nose? But he's

famous!

HEY!!!

It's not a big deal. I only dated

him for a week and a half-

I'm talking to you Scott Pilgrim!

Lucas Lee stomps towards Scott, who gasps.

He's famous and he talked to me!

The only thing keeping me and her

apart is the two minutes it's gonna

take to kick your ass!

Can I get-

POW! Lucas Lee punches Scott, flooring him. Scott comes back

up with a pen and paper, wobbly.

Can I get your autograph?

POW! Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He nods to Ramona.

Sup. How's life? He seems nice.

Lucas Lee THROWS Scott up into a castle turret, crumbling it.

Scotts CRASHES down through scaffolding onto the set. Lucas

holds up his hands for a quick continuity photo, then stomps

over to pick up a dazed Scott from the ground.

Scott. Evil ex. Fight.

Think you stand a chance against an

A-lister, bro?

Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He slides across the wet-down

ground. A SET NURSE sprays Lucas' knuckles with antiseptic.

Some competish you are.

Lucas Lee wanders off. Scott staggers to his feet, punchy.

Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done-

Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!

LUCAS LEE (O.S.)

Looks like you're seeing double.

Scott turns to see the real Lucas, smirking on the sidelines.

POW! The identical Stand In punches Scott to the ground.

He's good, right? Sometimes I let

him do wide shots if I feel like

getting blazed back in my winnie.

Scott stands to fight the double. Suddenly, COUNTLESS

STUNTMEN fan out behind the STAND IN, all identically

dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble.

I'm nothing without my stunt team.

The Stuntmen ATTACK Scott Pilgrim with a howl. Scott PUNCHES

through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style.

Ask them how it feels to always get

his sloppy seconds!

How does it feel to-

KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a

barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs.

I'm gonna get coffee. You homies

want anything?

We follow the smirking Lucas to the coffee station. We hear

the noise of punching and kicking slowly subside to nothing.

SCOTT (O.S.)

Mr. Lee?

Lucas turns, shocked to see Scott, in front of a PAINTED 2-D

SKYLINE BACKDROP, surrounded by many unconscious stuntmen.

You're needed back on set.

Scott CHARGES Lucas Lee and leaps into a FLYING KICK. Lucas

GRABS his foot and hurls him through the backdrop. RRRIP!

Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline.

Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow.

Prepare... prepare to feel the wrath

of the League of Evil Exes!

The League of Evil Axes?

You really don't know about the

"The League"?

Ummm...

Seven evil exes? Coming to kill

you? Controlling the future of

Ramona's love life?

...no.

Oh, well then don't worry about it.

Really?

Yeah, bro. Let's get a beer.

Lucas offers a hand. Scott goes to shake it. POW! Lucas gets

him square in the mouth. Scott smiles through his aching jaw.

You are a pretty good actor.

I'm going for the Oscar this year.

But are you a pretty good skater?

I'm more than pretty good, ese.

I have my own skate company.

Lucas pulls down his shirt, revealing a skate company tattoo.

So you can sell them, but can you

do a thingy on that rail?

Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs.

It's called a grind, bro.

So can you do a grind thingy now?

Are you serious? There's like 200

steps and the rails are garbage.

Hey, if it's too hardcore...

You really think you can goad me

into doing a trick like that?

There's girls watching.

Somebody get me my board.

Wallace taps Lucas' shoulder and hands him his skateboard.

Hi. Big fan.

Why wouldn't you be?

CLACK! Lucas GOES FOR IT, a perfect ollie onto the rail.

Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight,

sparking down the ENDLESS RAIL...HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...

Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas.

Wow.

HSSSSSSSSS...

Cut back to Scott & Wallace, very impressed at Lucas.

HSSSSSSSSS...

Cut back to Scott & Wallace. Scott's about to say ' wow' when-

BOOOOOOOOM! A fireball appears from the bottom of the stairs.

Wow, he totally bailed.

Yes!

Fist bump. Scott smacks his forehead.

I didn't get his autograph.

FIRST A.D.

Uh...that's a wrap everybody.

Where's Ramona? Is she still here?

No, she totally bailed.

What's the deal? Seriously.

61 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - DAY 61

Scott slumps on the couch, phone pressed to his ear. Wallace

cooks bacon in the kitchen (no pants). We hear the OUTGOING

MESSAGE: This is an automated voice messaging system. RAMONA

is not available, please record your message after the beep.

Hey. It's me, Scott again. Call me

back. Scott Pilgrim.

What's the deal? Seriously.

Scott ambles over to the fridge and rests his head on it.

Yeah, you said that last night.

You know what really sucks though?

What?

Everything!

Come on guy, you can't say you

didn't see this coming. It was

right under your nose.

Wallace points to the NOTE Ramona scribbled which is pinned

literally under Scott's nose on the refrigerator:

RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx

What did you think these were?

Kisses? Seven little kisses?

Seven deadly X's.

Wallace cocks an eyebrow. Scott slides to the floor.

Why does everything have to be so

complicated?

Wallace crouches down to join Scott on the floor.

If you want something bad, you have

to fight for it. Step up your game.

Break out the L-word.

Lesbian?

The other L-word.

Lesbians?

Okay, it's 'love'. I wasn't trying

to trick you or anything. Look, if

she's really the girl of your

dreams, then you have to let her

know. You have to overcome any and

all obstacles that lie in your

path. You have the spirit of a

warrior, Scott. You can do it! Be

with her! It's your destiny!

Plus, I need you to move out.

Scott's face falls, completely shocked at this bombshell.

What? Why? Are you moving in with

Other Scott or Jimmy or someone?

Or someone. Either way, I'm kind of

banking on her calling you back so

I won't have to evict you and feel

all guilty and shit.

RINGY RING. Scott and Wallace look at the phone.

I have a feeling that's for you, guy.

Scott picks up. A SEXY, NON-RAMONA VOICE REPLIES...

VOICE (O.S.)

Hey Scott.

It's been a long time.

Yeah.

ENVY (O.S.)

A year I think?

Approximately.

ENVY (O.S.)

How are you?

I'm not doing so good right now.

ENVY (O.S.)

That's too bad. Still breaking hearts?

What? No, stop. I've been-it's been

different. You have no idea.

ENVY (O.S.)

Probably not. Do you have a

girlfriend? Should I be jealous?

Yes, you should. I have this

totally awesome girlfriend who

calls me all the time. And she's

America. Uh. She's American.

ENVY (O.S.)

What's her name?

I'm not telling you that. Ramona.

ENVY (O.S.)

Oh.

What? Do you know her?

ENVY (O.S.)

Uh. No.

It sounded like you did.

ENVY (O.S.)

I gotta go. Nice chatting with you.

CLICK...Scott slumps to the floor. Wallace appears over him.

Okay. Everything does suck.

Scott grunts. RINGY RING. Wallace grins and grabs the phone.

Or does it?

Scott sits bolt upright, expectant.

Oh, hey Knives.

Scott lays back down. FUCK.

What's that? You're outside?

Scott sits bolt upright again. FUCK! Wallace opens the door a

crack. Knives shivers outside, pale and broken looking.

Is Scott here?

You know what?

Behind Wallace, we see Scott LEAP through a window head

first. GLASS SMASHES.

WALLACE (CONT'D)

He just left.

Knives sighs. Scott sprints away in the background.

A62 EXT. STREET - DAY A62

Scott walks fast down the street, freaked out and paranoid.

He sees five ' X's looming above him on a pedestrian crossing

and quickly diverts into an...

62 EXT. ALLEY - DAY 62

Scott rips the ' X-Men' patch off his jacket, when-

WHZZZ - SOMETHING buzzes past Scott. He looks around.

Dude.

WHOOSH - another blast of air whizzes by.

Please.

SHFFF - SOMETHING sweeps him off his feet. He's pissed now.

I'm really not in the mood.

SHWAA - SOMETHING slices the air in front of Scott.

Okay, enough!

Scott punches the air in front of him. Hits SOMETHING. A

DIMINUTIVE DIRTY BLONDE dressed in a punk rock kung fu get up

lands on the ground with a thump. She spins to face Scott.

You punched me in the boob. Prepare

to die, obviously.

Listen, I've had it today. Can we

not do this right now?

Love to postpone, darlin', but I

just cashed my last raincheck.

What's that from?

My brain!

Well whatever this is about, can it

wait till I'm in the right frame of

mind?

Nuh uh. This is one nightmare you

can't wake up from.

Wait, am I asleep right now?

No.

So, technically this is not a

nightmare.

So how can I not wake up? If I'm

not actually asleep.

Don't question me!

Scott shakes his head, baffled.

Well, I'm really, really not up for

this. Whatever it is.

Okay little chicken, then I'll see

you later. But you won't see me.

Because I'll be deadly serious next

time.

What?

Nevermind!

PAF - the Mystery Attacker vanishes. Scott looks to the sky.

Oh man. Someone help me.

63 EXT. BLOOR STREET - DAY 63

Scott is in his usual payphone, dialing Stacey frantically.

It's Scott.

STACEY (O.S.)

What did he do this time?

No, it's Scott. It's actually me.

STACEY (O.S.)

What did you do this time?

I didn't do anything. It's everyone

else that's crazy.

Look I need to talk to you, I'm

having a meltdown or whatever. Are

you still working?

STACEY (O.S.)

I'm literally about to leave.

Cool, I'm coming in.

Scott hangs up the phone and walks two steps into-

64 INT. THE SECOND CUP - CONTINUOUS 64

Scott approaches the counter. Stacey has her back turned.

Think I'll make it a decaf today.

Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be JULIE!

SCOTT PILGRIM!

AH! What did you do with my sister?

Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to

go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy.

What can I fucking get you?

Is there anywhere you don't work?

They're called 'jobs', something a

fuckball like you wouldn't know

anything about. And by the way, I

can't believe you fucking asked

Ramona out after I specifically

told you not to fucking do that!

(Note to concerned reader: Everytime Julie says "FUCK", a

black bar comes out of her mouth and the sound is bleeped.)

How do you do that with your mouth?

Neverfuckingmind how I do it! What

do you have to say for yourself?

Uh. Can I get a caramel macchiato?

Maybe it's high fucking time you

took a look in a mirror before you

wreak havoc on another girl.

Me? Wreak havoc?

Julie points at THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD poster behind the

counter with concert dates at the bottom.

Fucking speaking of fucking which,

I hear the girl that kicked your

heart in the ass is walking the

streets of Toronto again.

So I can pick up my coffee over

here?

Scott retreats away from Julie and bumps right into...

RAMONA. They share an awkward moment. She looks at the floor.

Sorry that got a little crazy last

night.

Yeah. You kind of disappeared.

Yeah, I do that. Listen, I know

it's hard to be around me

sometimes. I'll understand if you

don't want to hang anymore.

No. No, I want to hang. The whole

evil ex-boyfriend thing. No biggie.

Exes.

I mean, I know it's early days, but

I don't think anything can really

get in the way of how I SHIT!

Scott hides behind Ramona as a lithe figure emerges from the

steamed-milk mists of the coffee shop...the singer from THE

CLASH AT DEMONHEAD has seemingly stepped out of the poster.

"ENVY ADAMS, 23, FUN FACT: KICKED SCOTT'S HEART IN THE ASS."

The icy, platinum blonde fashionista walks towards Scott.

The big one?

Scott nods. LEONE STAREDOWN between Envy and Ramona.

I'm gonna...excuse me.

Ramona goes to order coffee, leaving Envy to fix on Scott.

Your hair is getting shaggy.

REVERSE: Scott is instantly wearing his DORKY HAT.

Yeah?

So. That's Ramona?

Yeah.

Okay, I'm jealous.

YOU'RE jealous?

I'm allowed.

You left me! For that cocky pretty boy!

You've never even seen him.

Yeah. I know. You left me for a guy

I've never even seen.

Maybe you'll see him soon. We're

playing Lee's Palace. You guys

should like, so totally come.

That's so not going to happen.

Great. You're so on the list.

Envy disappears into the cappucino mists. Ramona returns.

Caramel Fuckiato for fuck Pilgrim!

It's pronounced 'Scott'.

65 EXT. TORONTO RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 65

Scott and Ramona walk side by side, sipping their coffees.

So...that was Nat?

No, that was Envy.

So...what did you guys talk about?

She's totally jealous of you.

Envy's jealous? How about that?

Yeah. How. About. That.

What happened with the two of you?

Do you mind if we don't get into

that right now?

She wanted to move to Montreal

because she missed her best friend.

This guy Todd.

And two weeks later, you heard they

were sleeping together I guess?

Basically.

I dated a Todd once. That didn't

end well either.

I can see how it sucks. Having the

past come back to haunt you.

Is it wrong that I try not to think

about it?

What do you want to think about?

How warm my place is right now.

Ramona stops and kisses him.

66 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 66

Scott lies between Wallace and Other Scott on the futon.

And you didn't bang her? Are you gay?

I couldn't stop thinking about my

stupid ex-girlfriend.

A bleary Jimmy sits up between them all.

Is that the Uma Thurman movie?

Scott. Just because Envy's back in

town doesn't make it not over.

Double negative. Tricky.

It's over. Move on.

Word.

Mm.

Scott stands (no pants). Music swells.

Right. I'm not gonna let her toy

with me. From this moment on, I

will think of Envy Adams no more!

67 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 67

I have distressing news.

A deadly serious Stephen Stills addresses Kim, Scott and

Young Neil. Ramona lounges on the couch...

Is the news that we suck? Because I

really don't think I can take it.

No. The Clash At Demonhead are

doing a secret show tomorrow night.

And Envy asked us to open for them.

I hate you.

A gig is a gig is a gig. Is a gig.

Maybe you can put your history

aside until we get through this

thing. You know, for the band? For

the band. For the band?

Can't we do our own secret shows?

All our shows are secret shows.

We're doing it. G-man might be

there! We play the next round of

the battle Saturday. We need to get

some buzz going. We need

groundswell. We need stalkers.

Stills paces past the window to reveal...KNIVES CHAU OUTSIDE.

CRASH ZOOM on her tearful face, pressed against the window.

TOTALLY CRUSHED to see Scott cuddling with Ramona.

What would you do? If your ex was

in a band and they wanted you to

open for them?

If my ex was in the band?

Yeah.

It might be a little awkward. But

maybe it's the grown up thing to do.

Yeah, we're all adults right?

68 INT. DRUG SMART - EVENING 68

KNIVES frantically rifles through racks of hair dye and rants

furiously into her cellphone.

He's dating a fat-ass hipster chick!

I hate his stupid guts! I'm gonna

disembowel him!

68A INT. KNIVES' BEDROOM - EVENING 68A

Knives stands on her bed and continues ranting at Tamara.

He only likes her cause she's old!

She's probably like 25! She's just

some fat-ass white girl, you know?

I think you mentioned she was fa-

68B INT. KNIVES' BATHROOM - EVENING 68B

Tamara helps Knives color her hair under the bathtub spigot.

She's got a head start! I didn't

even know there WAS good music

until like two months ago! Okay,

this really burns.

We should rinse-

I mean, he knew I was cool but he

thought I was too young, so he

tried to find someone cool but old.

She's cool? I thought she was fat-

Well she THINKS she's cool. This is

all her fault.

Why?

Tamara turns the faucet on and rinses Knives hair.

It MUST be her fault. Obviously

it's just a twist of fate or

whatever, isn't it? Star crossed

lovers! Born too late!

Knives looks in the mirror: HER HAIR IS EXACTLY LIKE RAMONA.

KNIVES CHAU (CONT'D)

Oh God...I look so...so good.

Knives throws a long scarf on, looking sexy, eyes narrowing.

68B CONTINUED: 68B

KNIVES CHAU (CONT'D)

Scott Pilgrim destroyed my heart.

But I know how to get him back.

PUSH into Knives, as she plots. Tamara pops into frame.

How?

We see a TEXT MESSAGE typing onscreen:

'YUNG NEIL ITZ KNIVES. OMFG UR SO HOTT'

69 EXT. LEE'S PALACE - NIGHT 69

A huge line of TOO COOL YOUTHS snakes outside a rock venue. A

sign reads ' THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD - Sold out'.

We hear loud music blasting through the open doors.

70 INT. LEE'S PALACE - CONTINUOUS 70

The LOUD MUSIC stops abruptly. Sex Bob-Omb bow onstage.

Thank you. We were Sex Bob-Omb.

Wallace and Other Scott clap and cheer, drunk. The other

snobbish kids in the audience shrug and disperse.

We got some merch out the back, so-

(to Scott and Kim)

Okay. Bar. Now.

71 INT. LEE'S PALACE - LATER 71

A disillusioned Sex Bob-Omb hang with Ramona at the bar.

Level with me. Did we suck?

I don't know. Did you?

She has to go. She knows we suck.

Ramona excuses herself.

72 INT. LEE'S PALACE, LADIES BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 72

Ramona does her eyeliner. She looks in the mirror to see two

images of herself staring back. Or is it...

"KNIVES CHAU, 17, SINGLE WHITE ASIAN" with identical hair,

clothes and makeup, standing next to Ramona, looking hot.

Hey Ramona.

Hey.

Ramona exits, confused. Knives follows.

What the hell?

73 INT. LEE'S PALACE - MOMENTS LATER 73

Ramona and Knives exit the bathroom together. Scott breaks

into a cold sweat. Knives shoots Scott a sultry look.

Hey Scott.

Knives heads into Young Neil's arms at the other end of the

bar. Scott struggles with something resembling jealousy.

What the hell?

Look who Knives is hanging with.

Who is that girl again?

Scottdatedher.

Briefly. Briefly.

I bet Young Neil will date her even

briefly-er.

How old is she?

A 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' spins INSIDE SCOTT'S HEAD, with

selections such as 'It was nothing' and 'She was nobody.' The

wheel sticks between 'I gotta pee.' and 'Who, her?'

I gotta pee on her.

(turns beet red)

I mean, I gotta pee. Pee time.

Peee time.

74 INT. LEE'S PALACE, MENS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 74

Scott washes his hands and looks up to see TWO SCOTTS staring

back, one with fringed hair and a wicked glare!

Scott whips around. He's alone. SPOOKY MUSIC begins...

75 INT. LEE'S PALACE - MOMENTS LATER 75

A freaked out Scott returns to the group. The lights dim and

the stage fills with twisting blue tendrils of smoke.

THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD materialize, ENVY in a long black

coat. Knives screams her teen brains out.

The BASS PLAYER steps into the light, no longer shrouded in

dry ice, he cuts a handsome, striking ROCK GOD figure.

That guy on bass? That's Todd.

I know.

Oh yeah...

You know?

Oh yeah...

Todd flips his fringe from his eyes. Stares at Scott.

"TODD INGRAM, 25, EVIL-EX #3, FUN FACT: 9TH DEGREE VEGAN"

Oh no.

Envy lets her coat slip off, revealing a stunning figure.

OH YYYEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

76 INT. LEE'S PALACE - LATER 76

Sex Bob-Omb, Knives and Ramona hang near the BACKSTAGE doors.

Oh my God. Just oh my God.

Man, you have to see them live.

They're so much better live. Oh.

I think I'm going to throw up.

Julie opens the backstage door and huffs.

I can't believe I'm even saying

this, but Envy Adams would like all

of you to come backstage.

All of us?

Did I fucking stutter?

The group shuffles backstage. Scott hangs his head like a

condemned man.

How do you know Envy???

Scottdatedher.

77 INT. LEE'S PALACE, RATTY BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT 77

SEX BOB-OMB lounge on a couch on one side of the room. Envy,

Todd and Julie lounge on a couch across from them.

Knives in shock as she thinks a thousand thoughts. Envy burns

a hole through Scott. Everyone else feels...'AWKWARD'.

Hey Ramona.

Hey Todd.

Been a while.

Mmm hmm.

Mmm hmm.

(whispers to Scott)

I think we should get out of here.

How was the tour? You played with

The Pixies? You're a superstar now!

It's-yeah, it's not something I can

really put into words.

Um...Envy? I read your blog.

Todd and Julie glare at Knives.

So...Scott and Ramona eh?

What of it?

You guys are a cute couple, you

know? You suit each other.

So what's your ulterior motive

Envy, in general?

She doesn't need ulterior motives,

Stephen. She's got a write-up in

Spin!

You're my role model Envy.

Just saying, cute couple. I like your

outfit Ramona. Affordable?

I was going to say, Envy. Did you

get those jeans in New York, they're-

I'm talking to Ramona right now.

Ramona lived in New York.

I was just there. We played the

Chaos Theatre for Gideon. You know

him, right?

Scott looks at Ramona. She is about to answer when...Knives

stands up, POINTS at Envy and SCREAMS-

I'VE KISSED THE LIPS THAT KISSED YOU!

Envy nods at Todd. He PUNCHES KNIVES SQUARE IN THE JAW! OMFG!

Scott jumps to his feet, FACING OFF against Todd Ingram.

Knives!?

Young Neil rushes to Knives' aid. Scott boils. Todd smirks.

That's right. I'm not afraid to hit

a girl. I'm a rock star.

You punched the highlights out of

her hair!

ANGLE on Knives. Her hair is black and plain as before.

He punched the highlights. Out. Of.

Her. Hair.

You're incorrigible.

I don't know the meaning of the word.

Young Neil escorts Knives out. Todd sits back down like

nothing happened. Scott's face is a bright shade of rage.

So, are you guys doing anything fun

while you're in town?

Fun? In Toronto?

That is IT, you cocky cock! YOU'LL PAY

FOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!

Scott LEAPS across the table and SWINGS a punch at Todd.

Todd THRUSTS a hand out and telekinetically FREEZES SCOTT IN

THE AIR. Scott hovers, grasping his neck, choking. Todd's

hair magically forms into a FAUXHAWK.

KK...my neck...yy...your hair...

Didn't you know? Todd's Vegan.

It's not a big deal.

Todd telekinetically HURLS Scott through the club's wall!

Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb peer through the newly made hole in

the wall, to see Scott sprawled on some trash bags. He tries

to keep cool, despite being in a lot of pain.

No kidding...anyone can be...vegan.

Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

Ovo what?

I partake not in the meat nor

breastmilk or ovum of any creature

that has a face.

Short answer: Being vegan just

makes you better than most people.

Bingo.

Todd lifts up Scott telekinetically and throws him miles into

the air. Scott sails out of shot and into space.

Hey man, question. I always

wondered, how does not eating dairy

products give you psychic powers?

You know how you only use ten

percent of your brain? Well, it's

because the other 90% is filled up

with curds and whey.

Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?

Go ahead and get snippy baby, if

you knew the science, maybe I'd

listen to a word you're saying.

Scott returns to earth with a THUMP. He moans in pain. While

the others bicker, Ramona helps Scott to his feet.

If I peed my pants, would you pretend

I just got wet from the rain?

It's not raining.

Oh. How about you give me the Cliff

Notes on how and why you ended up

dating this a-hole?

Is that really important right now?

If there's a key element in his

backstory that can help me out in a

critical moment of not dying? Yes.

A brief, scrappy ANIMATED FLASHBACK of Young Todd and Ramona.

RAMONA (V.O.)

I was only dating Lucas until the

minute Todd walked by. I guess

that's not very nice, but I used to

be kind of...like that.

Young Ramona shoves Young Lucas down a hill and starts making

out with Young Todd.

RAMONA (V.O.)

We hated everyone. We wrecked

stuff. Nobody cared.

Young Ramona and Young Todd wreck stuff. Nobody cares.

RAMONA (V.O.)

He punched a hole in the moon for

me. It was pretty crazy.

Young Todd punches a hole in the moon. It's pretty crazy.

RAMONA (V.O.)

A week and a half later, he told me

his Dad was sending him to the

Vegan Academy, so I dumped him.

Does that help you at all?

The FLASHBACK ends. Scott can only fixate on one aspect.

Have you dumped everyone you've

ever been with? You've never been

the dumpee?

Ramona shrugs.

Look, I've dabbled with being a

bitch. It's part of the reason I

moved here. I was really hoping to

put it all behind me.

Todd appears behind Ramona - ready for another round.

We have unfinished business, I and he!

Scott stands up - sort of ready for another round.

He and me.

Don't you talk to me about grammar!

I...dislike you. Capiche?

Understand?

Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.

What?

Because you'll be dust by Monday.

Um...

Because I'll be pulverizing you in

two seconds. And the cleaning

lady...cleans up...dust. She dusts.

Sorry, so what's on Monday?

Cos it's Friday now and she has

weekends off, so...Monday. Right?

Basically, you can't win this fight

and you'll have to give up on this

girl, ' cos Todd is going to kill

you.

You used to be so...nice!

Scott CHARGES at Todd, who PSYCH-THROWS him back into the

club. We hear a distant CRUMP. Stills calls through the hole.

Uh, we're going to Pizza Pizza for

a slice, call us when you're done.

Sex Bob-Omb skulks away. Envy grins at Ramona, wicked.

Sorry, baby. Crummy way to end

things, I know.

Suddenly, the bass-line from FINAL FANTASY 2 rumbles through

the walls. Todd calls to a roadie.

Get me my bass. The good one.

78 INT. LEE'S PALACE - CONTINUOUS 78

SCOTT stands in an elephant's graveyard of plastic cups and

bottles, picking the hell out of his bass, amp pegged to 10.

TODD INGRAM levitates, floating towards Scott with his bass.

You're going down. Vegan Style!

Todd lands in front of Scott. BASS OFF! PICKS STRIKE STRING!

Todd easily out-basses Scott, shredding him into oblivion.

The enormous reverb LAUNCHES club debris towards Scott.

The reverb is hurting my soul!!!

Scott slides across the floor and slams right into the wall.

Todd LEVITATES, fauxhawk rising. He hovers next to him.

That's right, Pilgrim. I actually

know how to play bass.

Todd DETUNES his bass and delivers a death note that BLOWS

Scott right through the stage wall.

79 INT. LEE'S PALACE, RATTY BACKSTAGE AREA- CONTINUOUS 79

Scott crashes into a backstage food table. Todd floats toward

him, savoring the kill. Envy appears beside him with a smirk.

I can read your thoughts. Your bass

hand is badly injured. You're through.

Scott turns around on his knees, cringing, holding a cup of

MILKY LOOKING COFFEE in either hand as a peace offering.

What say we drink to my memory?

Fair trade blend with soymilk?

I'm sorry, but that's pathetic.

Dude. I can see in your mind's eye

that you poured Half & Half into one

of these coffees in an attempt to

make me break vegan edge. I'll take

the one with soy. Thanks, tool.

Todd floats to the ground, takes one of the cups and drinks.

Actually, I poured soy in this cup,

but thought real hard about pouring it

in that one. You know, in my mind's

eye or whatever.

What are you talking about?

You just drank Half & Half.

TWO TRENDY POLICE TYPES BUST IN THROUGH THE WALL, making two

more holes and pointing their fingers like deadly weapons.

VEGAN POLICE OFFICERS

Freeze! Vegan Police!

VEGAN POLICE OFFICER #1

Todd Ingram, you're under arrest

for veganity violation code number

827, imbibement of Half & Half!

That's bullroar!

VEGAN POLICE OFFICER #1

No vegan diet, no vegan powers.

But this is a first offense! Don't

I get three strikes?

Vegan Police Officer #2 flips open his CODE VIOLATION book.

VEGAN POLICE OFFICER #2

At 12:27 a.m. on February 1st, you

knowingly ingested Gelato.

Gelato isn't vegan?

VEGAN POLICE OFFICER #1

Milk and eggs, bitch.

VEGAN POLICE OFFICER #2

On April 4th, 7:30 p.m., you partook

a plate of Chicken Parmesan.

Envy gasps, disgusted.

Chicken isn't vegan?

VEGAN POLICE OFFICER #1

The deveganizing ray! Hit him.

The Vegan Police BLAST Todd with arcs of power from their

finger guns. Todd's fauxhawk deflates into a bowl cut.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Scott rises into a stance to deliver his killer line...

You once were a vegone, but now you

will be gone!

Vegone?

Scott HEADBUTTS TODD, exploding him! POOM! Scott dusts

himself off as COINS rain down. Envy stares, jaw ajar.

Uh, sorry I guess.

Sorry? You just headbutted my

boyfriend so hard he burst.

You kicked my heart in the ass. So

I guess we're even. Natalie.

No one calls me that anymore.

Maybe they should. Now let's get

out of here.

A battle worn Scott limps through the hole in the wall.

Ramona follows, shooting Envy a look on the way out.

Crummy way to end things, I know.

Envy blinks, in shock. Julie pops into shot.

For the record, I am so pissed off

for you right now.

Shut the fuck up, Julie.

80 INT. PIZZA PIZZA - NIGHT 80

Sex Bob-Omb, Wallace and Other Scott munch pizza slices.

Ramona and Scott, on the fringes. It's an odd mood.

Envy Adams. I hate that bitch so

much I kind of love her.

Yeah. That Todd guy was cool too.

And hot. I liked him.

Scott sighs and holds a cold Coke Zero on his forehead.

Are you okay?

Uh huh.

You sure about that?

Do I look like I'm not okay?

Scott does not look okay. Stills coughs.

We're still going to the after show

right?

I'm not sure it's gonna be much of

a party, I think a third of the

band just went 'poom'.

Cool bands never go to their own

after parties. It's just the

desperate people trying to rub

elbows with label guys.

Then why would we...oh.

Neil, you down?

Neil is at the counter with a catatonic Knives. He shrugs.

STEPHEN STILLS (CONT'D)

Scott? You're in right?

Do you want to go?

I kind of almost died back there, so...

I'm not saying I want to go.

Hey, we can totally go.

I'll do whatever you want to do.

So let's go.

Scott takes another bite. Other Scott whispers to Wallace.

Are Scott and Ramona fighting?

Not to my knowledge.

Oh.

I mean, not with fists.

Oh.

Yet.

Ooh.

81 EXT. AFTER PARTY - NIGHT 81

The whole gang trudge to the after party. Scott limps a bit,

lagging behind. Ramona falls back with him.

We really don't have to go to this

thing. It'll probably be a bad

scene all around and we've already

had a full night.

No, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just-

It's just...?

Well, not that fighting harder and

harder battles for your love is

getting old or anything...but have

you ever dated someone who wasn't a

total ass?

So far you're not a total ass.

But I'm part ass?

If it makes you feel better, you're

the nicest guy I've dated.

Wait...is that good?

It's what I need right now.

But not...later?

Scott, I don't have all the

answers. I'd just like to live in

the moment if I can.

Yeah, I'd just like to live.

Scott and Ramona enter a big, fartsy, artsy WAREHOUSE.

82 INT. AFTER PARTY - CONTINUOUS 82

Okay, I know Todd was bad news. But

are you saying Envy wasn't? We all

have baggage.

My baggage doesn't try and kill me

every five minutes. What did you do

to your ex-boyfriends to make them

so insane?

Exes.

No break up is painless. Someone

always gets hurt. What about you

and that girl Knives?

Knives?

Who broke up with who?

I believe...I broke up with her.

And was she cool with that?

Knives is with Young Neil now,

she's totally cool with it.

They pass Knives and Young Neil. She seemingly has no

interest in her date and simply stares at Scott lovingly.

You sure about that?

Yeah. She's very mature for her

age. It was a very healthy break

up. We're all peaches and gravy.

We hear an offscreen distant ' nooooo' from Knives.

And what about you and Kim?

They pass Kim. She's also staring at Scott. Not lovingly.

Me and Kim? I can barely remember.

Why, is it important?

Hey, you want to know everything

about my past, dude.

It was just...yeah. I don't know.

It was high school. She had

freckles. It was cool, I guess.

That's it?

Yeah, it kind of ended. We changed.

Scott and Ramona have reached the bar at the party.

That's really the whole story?

OKAY! I had to fight a dude to get

with her! I fought a crazy eighty

foot tall purple suited dude! And I

had to fight 96 guys to get to him,

too! He was flying and shooting

lightning bolts from his eyes! He

was totally awesome and I kicked

him so far he saw the curvature of

the earth! Does that make you feel

any better?

Well now you are being a total ass.

Welcome to the club.

In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection:

fringed hair, wicked glare. He catches himself.

Sorry. I'm not usually like this.

Hey, don't worry. I don't know what

I'm like anymore.

I guess this whole ex-boyfriends thing

is really messing with my head.

Exes.

Why do you keep saying-

PAF! A foot appears out of nowhere and KICKS Scott in the

head, sending him flying across the dance floor.

Scott looks up at his opponent, the MYSTERY ATTACKER!

SCOTT (CONT'D)

Girl from earlier?

Roxy?

Scott gets up. The three square off in a triangle.

You know this girl?

Oh boy, does she know me.

What...is...she...talking about?

He really doesn't know?

(ping!)

You and her?!

'ROXY RICHTER, 23, 4TH EVIL EX : SAPPHIC AGGRESSIVE.'

It was just a phase.

Just a phase?

You had a sexy phase?

I didn't think it would count! It

meant nothing.

It meant nothing???

I was just a little bi-curious.

Well honey, I'm a little bi-furious!

Roxy throws a SCORPION KICK at Scott's face. Ramona CATCHES

her foot mid-air. Roxy flips out of the hold.

Do that again and I will end you.

Back off hasbian. If Gideon can't

have you, no one can. The League

hath spoken.

The girls square off, clearing the busy dance floor.

Then Gideon best get his pretentious

ass up here, ' cos I'm about to kick

yours out of the Great White North.

You unbelievable bitch.

RAMONA pulls a LARGE HAMMER from her purse.

Believe it.

An embarrassed Scott watches with the rest of the crowd.

Wallace?

Uh huh?

This is happening right?

Uh huh.

I mean, this is live?

Oh yeah. KICK HER IN THE BALLS,

RAMONA!

With blinding speed, Roxy slips her belt off and WHIPS A

RAZOR SHARP FLYING GUILLOTINE BELT BUCKLE at Ramona! Ramona

CARTWHEELS as the buckle sails between her legs and SMASHES

into a DISCO BALL. Mirrored shards fly everywhere.

PAF! Roxy vanishes as Ramona SWINGS the hammer at her. It

smashes a speaker. Sound on one side of the room cuts out.

Ramona turns around just in time to see Roxy's deadly belt

SAILING towards her. She BLOCKS with the hammer. The belt

wraps around it. Roxy HURLS the hammer out the window.

I'm sending you back to Gideon in a

thousand pieces, you slag.

Ramona springs off of various pieces of furniture, LEAPING

towards Roxy and PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE. Roxy REELS and

SLAMS into the wall, leaving a dent in it.

I'd rather be dead than go back.

He's a creep, you're a bitch and

you all deserve each other.

Give it a rest, Ramona. This is a

League game.

Roxy points an accusing finger at the mortified Scott.

Meaning your precious Scott must

defeat me with his own fists. Or

possibly feet.

I'm not sure I can hit a girl.

They're soft.

You don't have a choice.

Ramona positions Scott into a fighting stance as Roxy CHARGES

with deadly intent. Ramona puppeteers Scott into a furious

volley of PUNCHES on Roxy. She staggers, winces.

Fight your own battles, lazy ass!

PAF! Roxy disappears then REAPPEARS between Scott and Ramona,

kicking them apart with the splits. Roxy then KICKS Scott

into the ceiling. He lands HARD on the floor.

ROXY (CONT'D)

Every Pilgrim reaches the end of his

journey. Some sooner than others.

Roxy lifts her leg over her head, preparing to drop her boot

of DEATH on Scott's head. She grins at Ramona.

ROXY (CONT'D)

Your B.F's about to get F'd in the B!

Her weak point's the back of her knees!

What? How does that work?

Whenever we were making out, I-

Okay.

As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and

lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee.

GRAPHIC: 'TICKLE TICKLE!'

Oh...

Roxy falls, still in the splits, throbbing with orgasmic

meltdown. Scott watches as Roxy giggles between spasms.

ROXY (CONT'D)

You'll...never...be able to do this

to herrrrrrrrrrr!

Roxy screams in ecstasy before EXPLODING into COINS. A spent

Scott is left standing in the middle of the room.

The party starts up again, a wave of gossip spreading around

the room. People text furiously and point fingers at Scott.

Two gin and tonics please.

I thought you didn't drink.

Only on special occasions. Why? Did

you want one?

Scott swigs down his drink. Ramona tries to lighten things.

I guess we really don't know that

much about each other do we?

Scott seems immediately drunk.

Maybe you could just give me a list

of all your exes so at least I know

who's going to beat my ass into the

ground next.

Oh, like a handy little laminate or

something? Let me see if I can find one.

(looks through bag)

Maybe we could exchange our information.

Scott has already downed his second drink.

Just out of sheer curiosity and

concern for my mortal well-being,

is there anyone at this party you

haven't slept with?

EVERY GUY AND GIRL AT THE PARTY

HEY!

Ramona stops. Looks hurt. She touches her hair.

I really think we should split.

As in ' get out of here'? Or as in

' split split'?

I'd hope you could figure that out.

Or did you miss the part where I

saved your ass?

How could I not? I feel like we just

washed our sexy laundry in public.

Dirty laundry. You're drunk.

(holds up 2 fingers)

I've had like one drink.

Well I'm sorry I cared. I don't

enjoy all this Scott. In fact I'm

sick of it. I thought you might be

more understanding.

You're just another evil ex-

boyfriend waiting to happen.

Ramona walks off and loudly announces.

RAMONA (CONT'D)

And yes, there is someone at this

party I haven't slept with. You.

Ramona leaves. Another crescendo of gossip echoes around the

room. Scott's friends gather round in a pity party.

But then - Ramona returns, handing Scott a LAMINATED LIST.

RAMONA (CONT'D)

P.S. Here's your stupid list.

Ramona exits proper. Scott looks at the list. It reads-

'PATEL, LEE, INGRAM, RICHTER, KATAYANAGI TWINS, GIDEON...'

Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?

You don't know?

83 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - NIGHT 83

Stills flips to hand drawn sketches of THE KATAYANAGIS,

identical Asian twins dressed like pretentious New Wave fops.

They're the next band in the battle

and they are badass.

We reveal a grim, terse Scott playing a doomy bassline. The

rehearsal room feels empty without Knives or Ramona.

Ramona dated twins?

Apparently.

At the same time?

You know what? I don't know and I

don't want to know.

Good. You know how I feel about

girls cockblocking the rock.

Good. I play better in a bad mood.

If it's gonna be an issue though,

Young Neil can fill in for you.

It's not an issue. You know bands,

I know battles. We got it covered.

Well, we'd understand if you didn't

want to take part.

Not only do I want to take part. I

want to take them apart.

Okay. I'm getting tingles.

Whoa...

84 EXT. THE NINTH CIRCLE - NIGHT 84

Sex Bob-Omb and Young Neil load their gear at the venue.

Okay. We're doomed.

Oh...

Flyers cover the outside walls of another rock venue;

'T.I.B.B! SEX BOB-OMB!! THE KATAYANAGI TWINS!!! AMP VERSUS

AMP!!!! TWO BANDS ENTER!!!!!! ONE BAND LEAVES!!!!!!!!!!!'

That flyer needs more exclamation marks.

Oh, we are going to get killed.

Come on. You're onstage in five.

Aren't the Katamaris or whatever on

first?

I think you're both on first?

Wait...amp versus amp? We're going

on stage at the same time?

That's impossible-

85 INT. THE NINTH CIRCLE, STAGE - NIGHT 85

'ACTUALLY, NO'

Two stages sit on either side of the auditorium. On one: a

MONOLITHIC WALL OF ELK AMPLIFIERS. On the other, SEX BOB-OMB,

with their dinky LAME BRAND amps behind them.

Okay. My bad.

Your bad is saying my bad.

Sex Bob-Omb stare up at the Katayanagi amps, sweating behind

their instruments. Stills looks into the audience positioned

between the bands: a legion of identical INDIE TEENS.

We shouldn't even be here. We

shouldn't even be here.

Stills tries to run. Scott grabs him and pulls him back.

Come on man! I put aside my

problems for the music. If I can do

that, we can do anything.

Did you speak to Ramona then?

What? No. I haven't seen her since

the other night.

Oh. She's totally here.

Kim points to RAMONA in the crowd. She is totally there. Her

hair is now the BRIGHTEST GREEN, and she stands next to a

nondescript MYSTERY GEEK in blazer and black rimmed glasses.

They are chatting. She looks happy. Scott turns bleak again.

Scott? Not that I care...but you should

talk to her before she's gone...

And I really don't care.

Scott nods at Kim's advice. He looks back to the crowd to

find the MYSTERY GEEK staring right at him. Then-

Disorienting LIGHTS and LASERS flash on the opposite stage.

A wall of FEEDBACK builds...THE KATAYANAGI TWINS appear,

sliding onstage behind their respective keyboard stands.

KYLE KATAYANAGI, 23, is very serious and Japanese. KEN

KATAYANAGI, 23, is serious and very Japanese.

Scott, Stephen Stills and Kim share a nervous look.

Okay gang. Can we do this? I mean,

we can do this. Right?

Right.

Scott?

Scott is distracted again by the Mystery Geek staring at him.

Scott!

Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting

an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that

it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the

ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers.

AUDIENCE DUDE (O.S.)

They brought the house down.

Now an open air venue, SNOW falls onto the stage. An earth

shaking BASS NOTE blows the dust off Sex Bob-Omb...

Scott and Stills get into battle position. Scott screams!

WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB! WE ARE HERE TO

MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH AND GET

SAD AND STUFF! 1-2-3-4!

Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT, their sound blowing a mass of snow

towards the Katayanagis. For once, they sound awesome.

Kyle looks at Ken. They share a nod. Ken turns their amps up

to the Japanese character for '11'. Their waveforms transform

the swirling snow into a TWO HEADED WHITE DRAGON!

Katayanagi SLAM their Moogs. Heavy weirdness EXPLODES from

the amps! The Dragon blows a BLAST of snowy fire that BLOWS

SEX BOB-OMB OFF THE STAGE. The crowd ERUPTS into cheers.

Scott, Kim and Stills lie in a heap under their instruments.

Let's break up now and get it over

with. We screwed the pooch in front

of Gideon Graves. We're done.

Gideon...is here? Where?

Stills points to the 'Mystery Geek', who smirks and whispers

in Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE.

That's Gideon?

Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He

struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as

Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up.

Alright. Let's do this!

Kim, inspired by Scott's new hardcore attitude, comes in

heavy on the kick drum. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!

Heads nod in time as Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT! Their waveforms

transform a mass of snow into a GREEN EYED YETI!

The Katayanagis fight back with their future sounds and their

Sonic Dragon stalks towards Sex Bob-Omb, slinking on perfect

beat with the Katayanagis' spooky music.

The Yeti and the Dragons CLASH at center stage, fighting in

time to the music!

Scott and Stills bring their pick hands down like fierce

PUNCHES. The Yeti brings it's fists down on The Dragon. Sex

Bob-Omb HAMMER DOWN THE FINAL NOTE:

The Yeti picks up The Dragon and THROWS it at the Katayanagi

Twins, EXPLODING them and their amps into COINS.

'+999 ROCKING'

That...was epic.

The crowd goes bazooky. A DISEMBODIED SCOTT HEAD appears,

hovering next to Scott.

Scott looks for Ramona in the crowd, but she and Gideon are

gone. Scott hands his bass to Young Neil.

Scott. What are you doing?

Getting a life.

Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still-

applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES

standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.

I just came to see the show. I'm

not even stalking you.

Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause.

You seem... different.

Knives shrugs, different.

I feel like I know stuff now.

Scott and Knives lock eyes. Scott suddenly spots a flash of

GREEN HAIR exiting the building.

Ramona...

Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing.

86 EXT. THE NINTH CIRCLE - NIGHT 86

Scott chases Ramona down the street outside the venue.

Ramona. I have something I need to

tell you.

Yeah, I have something to-

Great. Listen, I know you just play

mysterious and aloof to avoid

getting hurt. I know you have

reasons for not wanting to talk

about your past. And I want you to

know, I don't care about any of

that stuff. Why? Because I'm in

lesbians with you.

What?

I really, really mean it.

What did you want to tell me?

That we have to break up.

What?

Yeah...it's not going to work out.

Oh okay...

A sleek black ' 61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind.

It's Gideon. I just...I can't help

myself around him.

VOICE (O.S.)

That's the bad news.

GIDEON GRAVES appears behind Scott with Stills and Kim in

tow. The Lincoln parks. A driver opens the passenger door.

The good news, Scottie, is I'm

officially loving the Sex Bombs.

Bob-omb.

Three piece rock outfit with a semi-

attractive female drummer? Music to

my earholes.

Scott glowers. Ramona looks at the floor. Stills is ga-ga.

TEXT: An arrow points to Stills' crotch, captioned 'PEE'.

You know, I'm not even going to wait

to see how you guys do in the final.

I'm signing you right now for a three

album deal.

Gideon produces a CONTRACT and clicks a pen.

See? I'm not such a bad guy after

all.

Scott GRABS the contract and throws it onto the sidewalk.

You think we're gonna sell our

souls to you? Well then guess-

We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is

furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs

it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott.

Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band

with this douche-in-charge.

Scottie, buddy, can I just say,

keep your emotions in check. Don't

let what's past screw up your

future.

Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the

mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection.

The people need to hear us, Scott.

Then you're going to need to find

someone else to play bass.

A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand.

Looks like we're all set.

Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all

round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder.

Oh and Scott, we should really be

thanking each other. I mean, if it

wasn't for me, you would have never

been with Ramona, but if it wasn't

for you, she wouldn't be back with

me. So I guess it all shakes out.

Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln.

And hey, the whole League of Evil

Exes thing? I was in a dark place

when I put that together. Forgiven?

Gideon disappears into the Lincoln and drives off and Sex

Bob-Omb drift away. Scott stands alone. He slaps his head-

I said ' lesbians'!

87 INT. THE BUS / GIDEON'S LINCOLN - NIGHT 87

Scott sits on the bus alone, thinking about Ramona...

Ramona sits expressionless in the back of Gideon's car...

Scott tries desperately to think positive...

A smiling Gideon sidles closer to Ramona...

Scott walks forlornly down an empty street and bumps his head

on a telephone pole. 'THONK'.

'OH GOD WHY'

A88 EXT. THE PARK - NIGHT / DAY / NIGHT A88

Scott sits on the swings, staring straight ahead.

Night turns to day. Day turns to night.

Scott remains in the exact same position.

STACEY (O.S.)

Was she really the one?

Scott looks over to see STACEY on the swing next to him.

The wha?

I mean, did you really see a future

with this girl?

Like...with jetpacks?

Stacey stands to go, gives Scott a hug.

Time heals all wounds, little

brother. Maybe next time let's not

date the girl with eleven evil ex-

boyfriends.

Seven.

Oh. Well that's not so bad.

Stacey heads off. Scott looks at the camera.

88 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 88

Scott enters. Flicks the light on. Gets a shock.

Aaah!

WALLACE (O.S.)

TURN OFF THE LIGHT!

Scott flicks the light off. Over PITCH BLACK...

WALLACE (O.S)

Presumably you just saw someone's

junk, and I apologize for that.

VOICE (O.S.)

Sorry.

SCOTT (O.S.)

Was that Other Scott or Jimmy or

someone?

89 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - LATER 89

Scott sits in the chair, wrapped in a blanket. SOME GUY lies

in Scott's usual futon spot (wearing Wallace's monogrammed

robe). Wallace hands Scott cocoa.

Scott, you know I love you. But I

need my own bed tonight. For sex.

Right.

I may need it the rest of the week too.

Right.

And the year.

I get it.

Maybe you can move in with Ramona.

Scott stares deep into his cocoa and shakes his head.

She's with Gideon.

Ah. That sucks. But you know, it's

probably just because he's better

than you.

He'll certainly have better hair.

Scott nods.

Either way, I think this fight is over.

Scott nods.

You can sleep on the floor until

you get somewhere else to stay. I

got you muffs and blinkers in case

this might happen.

Wallace produces earmuffs and a sleep mask.

Thanks.

RINGY RING. Scott stares at the phone. Some guy picks up.

It's for Scott.

Hello?

GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)

Hey, pal. Just wanted to say I feel

terrible about earlier. I don't

want any hard feelings, so I

figured why not be the bigger man

and give you a call.

Is Ramona with you?

90 INT. GIDEON'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS 90

Gideon appears to sit on some kind of throne. He calls off.

I don't know. Are you with me?

RAMONA (O.S.)

Yeah.

SCOTT (O.S.)

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

Geez buddy, it's gonna be alright.

91 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 91

No, I just spilled cocoa on my crotch.

GIDEON GRAVES (O.S)

Sure you did. Well as you know, I'm

opening a new Chaos Theatre in

Toronto and The Sex Bobs are

playing our grand opening tonight,

and it would feel really weird for

all of us if you weren't there.

They just did a sound check and the

acoustics in here are amazing.

Yeah. Maybe I'll see you there.

GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)

I hope so, amigo. I don't want

anymore bad blood between ex's.

What do you say?

Mm.

Okay laters.

Click.

WALLACE (O.S.)

What a perfect asshole.

Scott turns, alarmed. REVEAL Wallace on the other cordless.

Forget what I said earlier. Finish him.

92 EXT. STREETS OF TORONTO - NIGHT 92

Snow blows around a steely eyed Scott as he stomps towards a

group of desolate WAREHOUSES near the water. A lone HIPSTER

KID smokes a cigarette, leaning against a warehouse wall.

Password?

Scott shrugs.

Whatever.

Cool.

The Hipster Kid waves Scott in.

93 INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 93

The warehouse is empty. Scott follows the sound of music to a

GATED ELEVATOR. Two Hipster Kids guard the elevator.

Second password?

Scott gives the slightest shrug.

Cool.

Scott steps into the elevator. So far so good.

94 INT. CHAOS THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 94

Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S UNDERGROUND

LAIR OF COOL SHIT...the CHAOS THEATRE.

All HIPSTER KIDS have gathered in one spot of ultimate

snobbery. They are legion, wearing identical outfits; Chuck

Taylors, skinny jeans. COMEAU holds court among them.

Yeah, their first album is so much

better than their first album.

Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are

playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on

bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song.

Scott!

Scott pauses, looking up at his former bandmates.

STEPHEN STILLS (CONT'D)

Let it go. Don't give him the

satisfaction.

What if I want the satisfaction?

Well, then you're doomed.

GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)

Scott Pilgrim!

Scott turns to see GIDEON sitting on a throne of cool atop a

BLACK VELVET VIP PYRAMID. Ramona kneels at his side.

Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos

Theatre. Somebody get this man a

drink! Coke Zero right?

A COCKTAIL WAITRESS with a fringe appears with a Coke Zero.

Scott takes the beverage and THROWS THE CUP TO THE FLOOR!

I'm not here to drink.

I got no beef with you.

What if I have a beef...with you?

Are you still mad about that whole

thing with the Guild?

You mean 'The League'?

Guild, League, whatever. It's

ancient history.

Gideon puts his arm around Ramona.

I'll show you how ancient of

history it is.

Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool.

No use crying over spilt Coke,

buddy. The lady made her choice and

we're all gonna have to move on.

Well I ain't moving...buddy.

You want to fight me for her?

Was that not clear?

(to Sex Bob-Omb)

Was that not clear?

Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes.

Now why on earth do you want to do that?

Because, I'm in love with her.

Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He

reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T-

shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Scott earned the power of love...

Ramona looks away from Scott. Gideon smiles.

I think this deserves a song.

Kimberly?

Kim scratches her head with her middle finger before

grudgingly launching into a number.

We are Sex Bob-Omb, we are here to

make money, and sell out and stuff.

Kim clicks out a fast tempo. Sex Bob-Omb begin to ROCK OUT.

A HORDE OF HIPSTER INDIE KIDS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM, ON BEAT.

Scott swings at them with his FLAMING BLUE SWORD. He slashes

at them to the beat, exploding each attacker into COINS.

Scott then RUNS up the side of the pyramid towards Gideon.

Ramona. My cane.

Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle.

He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there.

Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other...Gideon descends

like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands.

Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop.

Your club sucks, by the way.

Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow.

If my cathedral of cutting edge

taste holds no interest for your

tragically Canadian sensibilities,

then I shall grant you a swift exit

from the premises. And fast

entrance into HELLLLLLL.

Gideon raises his sword. Then from above...

KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)

SCOOOOOOOOOTT!!!

KNIVES CHAU sails into frame and KICKS the sword out of

Gideon's hands. She lands awkwardly, tripping and falling

down the side of the pyramid. Gideon chuckles.

That is priceless.

Scott looks to Knives, both concerned and amazed. She quickly

recovers and POINTS a furious finger.

'KNIVES CHAU, 18 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: SCOTTAHOLIC'

You'll pay for what you did to him!

Listen, Kung Pao Chicken, your old

old boyfriend brought this all on

himself. He was warned plenty of

times. But did he listen? Did he f-

I'm not talking to you. I'm talking

to HER!

Angle on a confused RAMONA standing behind Gideon.

What?

YOU BROKE THE HEART THAT BROKE

MINE! GET READY TO CHAU DOWN!

Knives leaps up the pyramid toward a shocked Ramona!

You're kidding right?

Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights

defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her.

You can't say I don't know how to

put on a show.

GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's

tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes.

What the hell is your deal?

You stole him with your advanced

American slut technology.

DUAL DUEL! The fighters weave in and out of each other,

throwing blocks and punches, KUNG FU STYLE.

I don't know what you're talking

about, I didn't steal anyone.

Scott lands a KICK to Gideon's chest, sending him flying off

the edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives

to Ramona and spins her away, separating them.

Can we please stop all this

fighting! Nobody stole anybody.

Knives, I dated you and then I

dated Ramona. Okay?

I mean...maybe I kind of forgot to

tell Knives right away, but...

Then you cheated on me, Scott!

You cheated on both of us.

Knives and Ramona both look at Scott, neither amused.

You cheated on me with Knives?

No! I cheated on Knives. With you.

Is there a difference?

You weren't wronged?

Scott breaks into a flop sweat.

Right?

Knives and Ramona stare at Scott.

GIDEON (O.S.)

Game over!

STAB! A sword pierces Scott's chest from behind.

Scottie. You can cheat on these

ladies all you want, but you

can't...cheat...death.

Scott slides off Gideon's sword and falls to the ground...

TEXT WITH ARROW POINTING TO SCOTT: 'DEAD'

Everything goes white...SAND blows through frame...Scott's

eyes blink open. He looks up into a BLINDING BLUE SKY...

95 EXT. THE DREAM DESERT - DAY 95

Scott sits up next to a lone cactus, rubbing his temples.

Ramona appears out of nowhere; fainter than before.

I'm sorry. Dying probably sucks.

You know what sucks? Getting killed

by THAT guy. Why him?

It's complicated.

Well, maybe now would be the time

to get into it. Seeing as I'm about

to die.

Alright... the truth is, it was me

who was obsessed. I was crazy about

him. But he ignored me. I was more

alone when we were together than I

ever was on my own. That's why I

had to leave... and that's when he

started paying attention.

So why go back?

I can't help myself around him,

Scott. He just... has a way of

getting into my head.

Well, that's legitimately

disappointing. I really will leave

you alone forever now...

No. I mean, he literally has a way

of getting into my head.

Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a

blinking CHIP implanted on her skull.

That is evil.

He's like that.

Ramona covers the chip, self-consciously touching her hair.

So this kinda sucks for everybody, eh?

I'm sorry it had to end this way.

We had a good run, I guess.

You can't say I didn't try. I

really fought for you back there.

Uh-huh.

The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away.

But someone was fighting pretty

hard for you back there.

Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany,

Knives?

I wish I was ever as fanatically

devoted to anything as that girl is

to you.

Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand.

I feel like I learned something. Which

would be great if I wasn't dead.

Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees.

So...so alone.

DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott.

Ahhhhhh...

We FLASH BACK to Scott swiping the PILGRIM HEAD, then FAST

FORWARD through the breakup with Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb. We

hear Scott screaming throughout this magical restart.

...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...

96 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 96

We FAST FORWARD all the way to Wallace's apartment, as Scott

enters. He flicks the light on.

...AAAAAAAAAHHH! I CAN'T BELIEVE I

HAD TO SEE THAT AGAIN!

SOME GUY (O.S.)

Again?

WALLACE (O.S.)

Turn off the light!

Scott flicks the light off. On PITCH BLACK...

Wallace, when my journey began, I

was living in an ordinary world.

Ramona skated through my dreams and

it was like a call to adventure, a

call I considered refusing. But my

Mentor, that's you, told me if I

want something bad enough I have to

fight for it. So I did. There were

tests, allies, enemies. I

approached a deep cave and went

through a crazy ordeal, during

which I totally seized the sword.

Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected!

Now I realize what I should have

been fighting for all along. But

before I do that, I need to ask one

final favor of you.

WALLACE (O.S.)

Sure thing, guy.

Could you put a robe on and hand me

the phone?

Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone.

Toronto. Chaos Theatre. Gideon

Graves.

Tell him Scott Pilgrim is calling.

GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)

Scott. I was just about to-

Hey, pal. I feel terrible about

everything. I don't want any hard

feelings, so I figure why not be

the bigger man and give you a call.

GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)

Um...

Sorry, what I meant to say is 'I'm

coming over to kill you'.

Scott hangs up and heads for the door, hardcore.

GO KICK THAT GUY'S ASS!

Wallace stands to high five Scott, exposing his junk.

WALLACE (CONT'D)

Ah, sorry.

You seen one...

97 EXT. STREETS OF TORONTO - DAY 97

Scott Pilgrim RUNS towards the desolate WAREHOUSES. The same

HIPSTER KID smokes a cigarette against the wall.

Your hair looks stupid.

The Hipster Kid EXPLODES into COINS.

98 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 98

Scott approaches the two Hipster Kids guarding the ELEVATOR.

' Sup?

Whatever.

Scott SPLIT KICKS them in the faces, knocking them out.

99 INT. CHAOS THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 99

DING! Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S

UNDERGROUND LAIR OF COOL SHIT: THE CHAOS THEATRE...AGAIN.

Yeah, their first album is so-

Scott KNOCKS DOWN Comeau and looks to Sex Bob-Omb.

Scott! Let it go.

Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

Stephen, the new line-up rocks. You

guys sound better without me. Young

Neil? You have learned well. From

this point forward, you shall be

known as 'Neil'. And Kim?

Kim looks at Scott, deadpan as ever.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

Sorry about...everything.

Kim shrugs.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

Sorry about me.

Kim SMILES at Scott for the first time ever.

GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)

Scott Pilgrim!

Scott turns to GIDEON on his throne, Ramona at his side.

GIDEON GRAVES (CONT'D)

Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos-

Save it. You're pretentious, the club

sucks, I have beef, let's do it.

Scott goes straight into fight mode.

You want to fight me for her?

Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A strange new power overcomes

Scott, different than before.

No...I want to fight you for me.

Scott reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty T-

shirt and pulls a FLAMING RED SWORD from his own chest.

NARRATOR (V.O.)

Scott earned the power of self-respect.

Kim?

WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB, AND WE ARE HERE TO

WATCH SCOTT PILGRIM KICK YOUR TEETH

IN!

Kim drives a hardcore beat. Sex Bob-Omb ROCK THE FUCK OUT.

HIPSTERS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM to the BEAT. Scott swings his

FLAMING RED SWORD, exploding each attacker into COINS.

Ramona. My cane.

Ramona hands Gideon his cane. He unsheathes his SWORD. Scott

and Gideon RUN towards each other, LEAPING in the air. They

pass in the air and Scott SLASHES. They land on opposite

sides of the platform, backs to each other.

How's it going back there?

You dick.

Gideon falls down. Dead, apparently. Scott calls out.

Knives! I know you're in here!

Don't attack Ra-

Knives SAILS through the air and KICKS Ramona in the head

SUPER HARD. We hear a METALLIC KLONK.

They square off, Ramona staggered, Knives pulling KNIVES.

Steal my boyfriend, taste my steel.

Scott jumps between them, hands held out.

SCOTT (CONT'D)

ENOUGH!

Knives tries to go around him. Scott GRABS her wrists. She

kicks him in the face.

No, Scott! This fat ass hurt me and

I will have my revenge!

No, Knives. I hurt you. I cheated

on you.

Knives steps back, stunned.

You cheated on me Scott?

I cheated on both of you. And I'm

sorry. I was a different guy back

then.

Knives' frown melts. Scott turns to Ramona.

And...you're not a fat ass. She didn't

mean that. So, are we all good?

Ramona rubs the back of her head. The CHIP no longer blinks.

Never felt better.

GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)

Are we all done with the hugging

and learning? I thought we had a

fight going here.

All turn to see GIDEON; bloodied, but still grinning, a

lopsided slash across his face accentuating his smirk.

Oh, you got a fight alright.

Scott steps into a fighting stance. Knives joins him.

Ramona. Are you with me?

Ramona looks to Gideon, then joins Scott and Knives and

STRIKES A FIGHT POSE, the three of them ready to rumble.

GIDEON (CONT'D)

Wrong move, baby.

Scott ATTACKS with his sword. Gideon BLOCKS, disarms Scott

with one move, spins and BUTTS Scott in the face with the

hilt of the sword. Scott teeters on the edge of the pyramid.

Knives throws her knives. Gideon's lightning fast sword

deflects them, SHING SHING!

Gideon wheels towards Ramona, expecting her to move. She

looks doubtful, takes a hesitant step towards him. He grins.

GIDEON (CONT'D)

Yeah. You're still my girl.

Ramona steps up to Gideon and whispers in his ear.

Let's both be girls.

Ramona knees Gideon in the balls.

Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her

scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him.

Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley of

FREEZE FRAMES.

Knives KICKS Gideon in the stomach and Scott follows with a

PUNCH IN THE NOSE, sending Gideon sliding across the floor.

Gideon gets back to his feet via backflip. He shakes off the

assault and grins.

You made me swallow me gum. That's

going to be in my digestive tract

for seven years!

Gideon throws a series of Wushu moves that give him a POWER

UP - his glasses glow, his HEALTH BAR increases. He makes an

'X' with his fingers and a draws a NEW POWER UP SWORD.

He cuts big arcs at Scott, Knives and Ramona. They barely

dodge him. Scott SPIES his sword and picks it up just in time

to BLOCK Gideon's attack. The swords create an 'X'.

Ramona KICKS. Gideon BLOCKS, knocking her down.

Gideon swings at Scott. Scott ducks. Knives attacks and

scores a hit. Gideon hits her back, dropping her.

SCOTT ATTACKS. They fence. Gideon spins low. Scott leaps in

the air. Gideon spins again and swings upward. Scott blocks

with his sword and is sent UP into the air. Gideon jumps

after him. They CLASH in the air. Scott's sword SHATTERS.

Scott lands hard. Gideon lands in front of him and raises his

sword for the kill. Ramona swings Gideon's VELVET ROPE,

cancelling out Gideon's digital sword.

Gideon SLAPS Ramona in the face and sends her painfully

tumbling down the pyramid. She lands painfully at the bottom.

Knives and Scott share a look. They Get up and circle Gideon.

COMBO ATTACK! FREEZE FRAME PUNCHES: Knives kicks and Scott

punches, sending Gideon back and forth like a pinball: KICK

PUNCH KICK PUNCH KICK! Gideon's face smashes with each

impact.

Ramona rises to see Scott and Knives kicking ass.

Scott slides Knives through Gideon's legs. From the floor,

she kicks him in the back of the head, then upends him like a

wheelbarrow and KICKS HIM IN THE FACE, sending him spinning.

Gideon lands HARD on his knees, defeated. One lens of his

glasses cracks. He looks up at the steely eyed Scott.

GIDEON (CONT'D)

Who do you think you are Pilgrim?

You think you're better than me?

I'll tell you what you are. A pain

in my ass. You know how long it

took to get all the evil exes'

contact information so I could form

this stupid league? Like two hours!

Gideon starts to pixellate quite badly. Not long now...

GIDEON (CONT'D)

You're not cool enough for Ramona.

You're zero. You're nothing. Me?

I'm what's hip. I'm what's

happening. I'm blowing up right

now.

You're right. I'm not cool enough

for Ramona. And you got another

thing right. You are blowing up.

Right now.

Scott spins and BACK HEELS Gideon in the face.

Gideon's head EXPLODES, his glasses SAILING down the steps of

the pyramid. Then his body follows suit in an almighty-

POOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

SHIMMERING COINS rain down. Scott and Knives kiss.

Whoa...

There goes our deal.

We're still getting paid, right?

Kim points to the falling coins.

There goes our deal.

Oh...

Stills jumps off stage and picks up coins.

The coin rain continues, silhouetting Scott and Knives in

their kung fu poses. They share a smile.

RAMONA (O.S.)

You two make a good combo.

Ramona, awake now, makes her way towards them.

Yeah?

Yeah.

The trio walk down the pyramid steps. Scott picks up Gideon's

fallen glasses.

The glasses GLIMMER. GIDEON'S VOICE echoes.

GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)

You can defeat me...but can you

defeat...yourself?

Scott peers into the glimmering lenses, spotting his EVIL

MIRROR IMAGE staring back at him. The glasses dissolve and

Scott whips around to face...

Negascott!

NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed

hair. Dark clothes. Evil face.

Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance.

No. This is something I have to

face on my own.

The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward

to confront his dark side.

Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward...

100-103 OMITTED 100-103

104 EXT. THE WAREHOUSE - EVENING 104

Knives and Ramona huddle in the snow outside Chaos Theatre.

They look expectantly at the entrance, worried for Scott.

Then...

Scott strolls out with Negascott. They chat amiably, shake

hands and part ways. Scott approaches Knives and Ramona.

What happened?

Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit.

He's a super-nice guy. We actually

have a lot in common.

Scott runs his fingers through his hair.

Your hair.

It's getting really shaggy.

Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked.

Yeah?

I like it.

Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking

his guard down. Ramona sees this and smiles.

You do?

Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see

her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness.

Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.

Hey... Where are you going?

Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back.

I dunno. I should probably

disappear.

After all that?

It's hard, you know? I came here to

get away, but the past keeps

catching up. I'm tired of people

getting hurt because of me.

Ramona looks at Knives as she says this.

I think I understand.

Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly.

I should tahnk you, though.

For what?

For being the nicest guy I ever

dated.

That's kind of sad.

It is kind of sad.

She takes his hand briefly, then lets it drop.

Well... Bye and stuff.

Yeah. And stuff.

She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-

KNIVES (O.S.)

Go get her.

Surprised, Scott turns back to see a smiling Knives.

Wha?

You earned it. You've been fighting

for her all along.

But what about you?

(totally sweet and sad)

I'll be fine. I'm too cool for you

anyway.

She grins and kisses his cheek.

There's someone out there for me.

We hear a COUGH - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her.

Guitar still in hand.

We hear a 2ND COUGH - Nega Scott also sidles into frame.

Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to-

Go talk to her. Before she's gone.

Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-

SCOTT (O.S.)

Hey... mind if I tag along?

Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside.

You want to come with me?

I thought maybe we could... try

again?

Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene

earlier. Scott takes it.

We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the

middle of the street, snow swirling around it.

Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up

over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning

to spring.

Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of

' Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's

cell phone airwaves.

JULIE (V.O.)

Oh my God, can I blow your mind?

Scott Pilgrim totally threw down

with Gideon Graves at the grand

opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it

was apparently awesome.

STACEY (V.O.)

Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I

mean bananas. My little brother

kicked a guy's head off. Literally.

It was unbelievable. Someone

seriously should have been filming

it.

Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the

heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars.

CONTINUE? 10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...
