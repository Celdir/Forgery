Animated scenes of the Thunderbirds on various rescues begin

to play as some of the cast and crew names show up.

From a secret island in the South Pacific,

the courageous Tracy family run an organization

called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere

in the world, they are always first on the

scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines,

the Thunderbirds.

(Counts down numbers and shows corresponding

Thunderbirds) Five, four, three, two, one. Thunderbirds are go!

Cuts to live action, Alan Tracy is looking out a school window.

But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind.

So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus

B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what

happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E,

F and... (Teacher notices Alan looking out window

and not paying attention to the lesson) Mr. Tracy!

Alan. Alan!

Alan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who

is now standing in front of him.

How kind of you to come back from outer

space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't

too rough?

(Chuckles sarcastically and continues sounding even more annoyed)

Here on Earth we've been discussing the Pythagorean

theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in?

I was just...

Apparently not (she picks up his notebook

which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds

are go."

Well, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring

break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk

the day you get back. That should keep you busy.

Bells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk

out to their lockers.

(mocking the teacher) "That should keep

you busy. Yeah, well you can take your

10,000 words

and stick them right up your..."

Alan!

Both boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them

while walking by with the teacher from before

Headmaster.

Mr. Tracy!

Miss Garrett.

You gotta be more careful Alan.

Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird

Fermat?

Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds

yet. And if your identity was discovered,

it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad.

I know, I know.

It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna

be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be

on TV.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where are they?

In Russia, at an oil rig fire.

Great! I'm stuck at school and my brothers

are on another cool mission.

Wanna watch?

Yeah!

Boys go into a crowded room with a TV on the news channel

We are told this super-rig is now in

danger of total collapse.

And there is real concern for the lives of six

men who remain trapped on board.

An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes

ago. They should be here any moment now.

(pauses and points at the sky while exclaiming excitedly)

And here they are!

The boys watching the TV begin to cheer

Thunderbird 2 this is Thunderbird 1.

I have visual, south

column, they're trapped on an inspection platform.

FAB. We'll take it from here.

Come on! Come on!

Scott, get out. That tower's coming

down.

Got it.

A blast of fire hits Thunderbird 1 and sends it a little farther

away from the accident zone.

Thunderbird 1 any damage?

Negative, Dad.

Come on, come on! Swing around. You

can't get close enough, taking that

approach angle.

This approach angle's no good. Gonna

have to swing her around.

Watch the wind shear Thunderbird 2.

Scotty, I was watching for wind shear

when you were still wearing diapers.

Come on, Dad.

A blast of fire comes toward Thunderbird 2

Whoa! Hold on!

Who needs the diapers now, Dad?

What do they do now?

Probably drop the rescue platform from

Thunderbird 2.

Open 'em up. Here we go. Rescue platform's

on its way.

Virgil, how's it going?

It's looking good, Dad.

Come on! Jump!

Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there.

Targets locked. Firing rescue lines.

(Directed toward the

crew members who he just fired the rescue lines toward) Come

on, guys, hook 'em up. We gotta get

you out of here.

READY

HOIST AWAY!

Alright, let's haul them out.

Commencing reverse thrust.

Okay, let's bring 'em home.

Look out! (a couple of crew members

bump into each other as they are hoisted

up)

Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That

rig's gonna blow.

Hang on!

Boys watching the TV gasp as the crew goes down back toward the

water a little bit

Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here

we go.

Come on, Virgil.

Hold on guys

How you doing, son?

Never better

Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure.

FAB, Thunderbird 2. (after pressing

a bunch of buttons on his control panel)

Lining up target.

Fire!

Bull's-eye! Outstanding shot. All right

boys, let's take these babies home.

As you can see the fire has been extinguished.

The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1

has

robbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn. Amazing! The Thunderbirds

have done it again, Chuck! '

The boys watching the TV with Alan and Fermat begin cheering.

That was great work, Lisa. Thanks a

lot.

(directed at Alan) Ooh, I wish I could

be a Thunderbird one

day. Thunderturd!

The boys in the room "ooohh" and look at Alan for a response

That's another good one, diaper boy.

All the boys look at the Know It All Kid and laugh

Tracy! (after finding Alan in the sea

of boys he continues) There's someone

here for you.

Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, at your service. Alan darling,

your father's been unexpectedly detained.

And he's asked me to pick you up. Is that all right?

Sure beats the bus!

Definitely!

Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous

young things be joining you?

All of the boys raise their hands and shout for Alan to choose

them.

Just Fermat.

Quite right.

Lady Penelope, why are you in America?

Are you on a mission for my father?

Alan, shh! I am an undercover agent,

so please try to be discreet. (camera

pans over to

Lady Penelope's pink car with Parker, her butler waiting by the

open door.) Here we are.

Hi, Parker.

Good afternoon, Master Hackenbacker.

Hi, Nosey.

Less of that attitude, or I shall be

obliged to deliver the Parker Haymaker.

Okay, bring it on, big guy.

They are all in the car and Parker is driving away

Try not to run over any children, Parker.

Very good, milady.

Come on, Parker, chop chop!

Lady Penelope's begins to fly

All right!

Whoa!

YES!

Yeah! the boys high five

(reading a newspaper) Oh, look, Parker.

Pink is the new black this season.

I'm very glad to hear it, milady.

And hemlines are going up.

That is good news, milady.

Oh and apparently England won the football

last night.

Yes! Eng-er-land! (his hands go off

the steering wheel and the car begins

to move to one side)

Whoa!

Calm down, Parker.

Yes, milady. Sorry, milady.

San Francisco City Hospital California,

USA parking lot.

Come on, baby. Out you jump. (Turns

to her teenage son who has a pan stuck

on

his head) Wait till your father hears about this, panhead! They

are walking toward the hospital

entrance when she sees the lights of Thunderbird 2 Aliens!

Even better! It's the Thunderbirds!

OK, lock it up. Let's go. Let's move

it. Hey, we need some help over here.

Mission complete. Thunderbird 1 we are

good to go.

FAB.

Mullion walks away from the others and fires a tracking goo at

Thunderbird 1.

Scene switches to a moving underwater submarine

Tracking device, activated.

Ah, the chariot of the gods. Having

dallied with the mortals,

they return to Olympus. And so I follow.

Pardon me, milady. Approaching Tracy

Island. And radar indicates we have

some company.

Thunderbird 1 and 2 pull up next to Lady Penelope's flying car

and Scott waves at Alan before Alan

turns to look at Thunderbird 2 where his father salutes at him.

Thunderbird 1 then does a barrel roll

around Thunderbird 2 before they both jet off toward the island,

leaving Lady Penelope's car behind.

Now, that's showing off.

I wish that was me.

I'm about to run post flight checks,

Mr Tracy. Anything I sh-sh-sh-

Anything you want to tell me?

Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration

on Thunderbird 2, followed by illumination

of the number 5

engine out light.

Okay, Mr. Tracy, I'll ch-ch-ch-study

the flight data and guidance processor.

Dad!

Alan! Let me look at you. He hold Alan

at arm's length and then looks him over.

He then looks

over and sees his older sons approaching. Ah oh look out.

Hey Sprout! ruffles his hair

ruffles his hair Hey Buddy!

Dinner's ready. Come and get it.

Onaha, it smells delicious. I am starved.

So Dad, I saw the mission on TV. It

looked dangerous.

Saving lives is a dangerous business.

But it's what we do.

Do you think the fire was caused by

thermal up draughts? I mean that would

explain the-- (Jeff

cuts him off)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, enough shop talk.

I want to hear about school.

School's boring. Plus I've been thinking,

maybe I could be home-educated now.

That way, I could

sit in on missions from time to time. What do you think?

No short cuts, Alan. No school, no rockets.

Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?

So I'm getting the reading telling me

that the wind is blowing 60 knots, right

up my keister.

No kidding.

Did you try readjust the flaps?

Well that's the first thing I did, Sprout!

It's not my first day in a Thunderbird

you know.

Try and keep up!

Yeah and don't you have homework to

do or something?

Unless he's blown up this school, like

the last one!

Yeah, keep Alan away from the ships,

he's a hazard.

Okay, that's enough. Pass the salad.

Man, I haven't seen that much fire since

that volcano in Fiji.

That wasn't Fiji that was Istanbul.

No, no, Istanbul was the earthquake.

Yeah well, nothing compares to Argentina.

Dad, I'm not really hungry. Come on,

Fermat. Let's go.

But! I'm not done! (sighs) Okay.

After dinner

Kyrano, have you seen Lady P?

By the pool.

Of course.

(answers her ringing cell phone) Parker.

Scene changes to Alan and Fermat about to enter Thunderbird 1's

silo.

We're not supposed to go in there. We

could get in trouble.

Ah, you worry too much.

Where'd you get the access code for

Thunderbird 1 anyway?

Fermat, my friend, what you don't know,

can't hurt you.

Scene changes back to Lady Penelope and Jeff by the pool

I'll be right there. It seems the fire

at the oil rig was no accident.

Any suspects?

Not yet, but I'll keep you posted.

Thanks for bringing Alan home.

My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise.

Tintin!

Hey, Mr. Tracy.

Hello, Tintin.

Good evening, Lady Penelope.

Did you know Alan's home?

(makes an annoyed face) Alan's back?

(changes her tone to a more pleasant

one) I mean, oh,

Alan's back! (looks at Kyrano) Hey, Dad.

When are those two going to get along?

When Tintin decides the time is right.

Girls always fire ahead of boys with

that sort of

thing.

What sort of thing?

(rolls her eyes) Romance.

Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one

coming.

No, you wouldn't.

Have a safe flight home, Penny.

Thanks, Jeff.

Scene switches to Fermat and Alan playing around in Thunderbird

1 like they are really about to fly it

into a mission.

Okay, Fermat. Run pre-flight checks.

Right. Hydraulic systems are green.

Commence main engine sequence.

FAB, Alan.

Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.

No wait, Alan! That's the(Thunderbird

1 begins to start up and Fermat shouts)

Wrong switch!

Oh God. (There is loud beeping coming

from the control panel and the boys

can't shut down

Thunderbird 1) Oh, could this day get any worse?

Scene briefly changes to Jeff getting an alert in his office.

(his face appears on a monitor in Thunderbird

1) Alan, my office. Now. (Thunderbird

1 shuts

down)

It just did.

The boys walk out of Thunderbird 1 and are walking toward the

silo door. Fermat is running his hand

on the nosecone of Thunderbird 1.

I can't believe it.

We're so b-b-busted.

Fermat's hand touches the goo that Mullion fired at Thunderbird

1 earlier.

Look at this.

What is it?

Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte

compound.

We gotta get out of here.

Scene changes to Alan walking into his dad's office.

Dad, I know you're mad. I shouldn't

have been in the ship, but if you just

give me a minute to

explain- (Jeff cuts him off)

You're damn right you shouldn't have

been in there!

But, nothing happened Dad. I had it

under control.

Under control? Do you have any idea

of the importance of secrecy in our

operation? You fired up

a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield. You

put everyone in danger when you act

selfishly. You want to be part of the team, you have to play

by the rules. You understand? (Alan just

looks at him) Do you?

Yeah, I understand. I understand you

don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You

don't want me to

do anything. You won't even listen to me when I'm trying to tell

you something important!

I've heard enough. You're grounded for

the rest of spring break.

But, Dad!

Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow

up.

Then let me. (he stalks toward the door

before whispering,) Please!

Jeff is starting at two old family photos on his desk when the

video phone rings.

Hey, John. I was just about to turn

in. What can I do for you?

I could sure use a pizza. You know a

place that delivers?

30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything

else on your mind?

Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok,

a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's

happening on

Planet Tracy?

Alan's home for spring break.

Yeah, I thought I could see a storm

brewing in your region.

Teenagers.

Well, we've all been there. And Dad,

you've done a great job since Mom died.

Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon

for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok,

see if they need

help with that fire.

FAB, Dad. Sleep tight.

Fermat is down with his father in the Thunderbirds hanger.

Morning, Dad.

Hey, son. There's something I'd like

to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look.

The neural-net control system?

It's great to have you back. I bet you

didn't think spring break was going

to be this w- w-fun.

Watch this.

Brains uses the neural-net control system to lift up the phone

in front of him. It also lifts up the Mole

which is stationed behind his workplace.

And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect.

Dad?

The neural-net control system short circuits.

N-n-n- Almost perfect.

There's something I want to talk to

you about.

Oh. Right. Oh. OK, right. You're having

problems with a g-g-g-chi-chi-chi-wo-wo-female?

N-no! No. Alan and I found some sort

of gallium compound on the nosecone

of Thunderbird

1.

We should check that out st-st-st-immediately.

That'd be g-g-g-swell!

Scene skips to Alan skipping rocks at the beach. The camera

follows one rock and it leads to a

telescope coming out of the water. The telescope is connected

to the Hood's submarine.

The island is in sight.

Transom, I need you.

Yes, sir. Sir, our cloaking device has

evaded their detection

systems. We have a positive visual from the tracking solution

on Thunderbird 1.

Mullion.

Sir? Sir, armed and ready. Shall I target

the main structure?

Why would I want to destroy what will

soon be mine? One of the principle tenets

of Eastern

martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him.

The Hood uses his powers to keep Mullion in place

(trying to move and realizing that he

can't) This is ridiculous.

It will be almost impossible to force

the Thunderbirds to leave their island.

On the other

hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go.

The Hood stops using his powers on Mullion and Mullion falls

over.

The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue.

All we need do is give them the victim.

(The Hood

looks at Transom) Commence targeting.

Straightaway, sir. Target acquisition

of Thunderbird 5 is locked.

Fire.

Transom fires a missile at Thunderbird 5.

Scene switches to John on Thunderbird 5 when suddenly alarms

start to go off around him.

What the?

Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island. Mayday!

Mayday!

Missile hits Thunderbird 5 and John is blow back into a wall

from the explosion. The scene then

switches over to Tracy Island.

Brains and Fermat run into Jeff's office.

Switching to Command and Control Center.

(Brains uses a palm scanner to activate

Command

and Control)

The submarine is briefly showed getting closer to the island.

Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon come running into Command and

Control.

How bad, Brains?

Thunderbird 5 major damage sustained.

Possible m-m-m-Possible strike by m-

Meteor?

Yep.

Thunderbirds are go.

Scene change to inside Thunderbird 3.

Check retros. Go.

Go to maximum thrust.

Scene switches to the submarine.

There goes the cavalry. But who will

rescue the rescuers?

Scene changes to Alan on the beach looking up at Thunderbird

3 launching and heading toward

Thunderbird 5. Tintin runs up beside him and looks up as well.

Alan! Tintin! Thunderbird 5 has been

hit! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird

5 has been

hit!

Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay don't panic.

Don't panic.

The children look toward the beach when they hear a noise and

see the submarine beginning to

surface.

On the other hand.

Run!

The kids run and hide behind some trees and shrubs. Scene then

switches to inside the submarine.

We made land.

(directed toward Transom) Cut them off.

Activating communications blackout.

Scene switch to Brains in Command and Control

What the he-he-devil is going on?

Mr. Tracy, do you copy?

Thunderbird 3 please respond.

Scene switch back to the kids hiding on the beach.

How'd they find the island? Do you think

it was what I did in Thunderbird 1?

Do you think I ruined

everything?

No! That compound we found could have

some sort of transmitting capability.

We have to do something.

My dad's in the control room, but how

do we get there now?

The vents. Let's go! We have to get

a message to my dad.

Scene switch to Thunderbird 5

I'm losing all power. Repeat, I'm losing

all power.

Hold on, John. We're coming in. Gordon,

prepare for immediate docking.

You got it, Dad. Reverse main thrusters

on my mark. Three, two, one.

Easy. Watch the roll.

Roll index angle minus two degrees.

We're locked on.

Nice work

Tunnel hatch secured.

Emergency packs boys. Let's move!

We're in. Let's go!

Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon are now in the damaged Thunderbird

5 with John.

John! Scott, tackle that fire.

Am I glad to see you guys!

Easy, you're hurt. Virgil, take care

of your brother. Gordon, give me a damage

assessment.

Scene switch to back on the island. The kids are running through

the jungle while heading toward the

vents and the Hood and his crew are heading toward Command and

Control.

Come on, hurry!

Inside the Tracy house Transom has found the closed door to Command

and Control center. Using an

electronic device she finds out what type of door it is.

One-inch steel plate, with sequential

titanium locking mechanism.

MULLION (Looks and door and pops his joints) I love a challenge.

Scene changes to right outside the Tracy house as the kids are

approaching the vents.

Watch out for the guards.

Get in, get in.

Scene switches to Brains sitting nervously in the Command and

Control room, whistling nervously to

himself and reading a magazine upside down. On the other side

of the door there is muffled banging

from where Mullion is trying to break open the door.

(Door bursts open and Mullion, Transom,

and the Hood walk in) Who-o-o-o- What's

going on?

So, this is Mount Olympus. And these

are the Thunderbirds. I should have

guessed. Jeff

Tracy, the billionaire, ex-astronaut, of course. Isn't he the

one who lost his wife in an accident?

Avalanche wasn't it? How tragic.

Scene switches to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat walking in the vents

toward the one that leads to the

Command and Control room.

(Whispers) Just keep going straight

ahead.

(whispers) Okay.

Scene switches back to Command and Control room.

Professor Hackenbacker? We met at last

year's international conference on

nanotechnology. I thought your thesis on neutrinos was extremely,

stimulating.

Transom, concentrate!

Sorry, sir. The command control switch,

is here. Fingerprint recognition system.

Professor. Please. Activate the control

switch.

N-n-n-n-n- You must be kidding.

Professor, you and I share an interest

in the science of the mind. The difference

is, I was

born with my powers. Trust me when I tell you, you've barely

touched the surface. (Brains is forced to

stand up and walked over to the Hood) Even the strongest minds

can be broken. It would be a pity to

break yours.

Fu-Fu-Fu- No way!

Activate the control switch, Prof! (Uses

his powers to make BRAINS move) Like

a puppet on

a string! (laughs)

Brains hand touches the activation pad.

We have control.

(To Brains) Get up.

Sorry, Professor. Nothing personal.

Scene briefly switches to the children's worried faces in the

vents. Scene then changes back to

Thunderbird 5, where the control panel is buzzing.

We got a warning light on our EPS system.

Attempt manual override.

No, that's negative!

Scene switches back to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat in the vents.

That's it.

Okay, this one.

Scene switches to Thunderbird 5.

Back to Thunderbird 3 now. (turns to

help an injured John) John, we gotta

move.

The locking mechanism's jammed!

Attention, Thunderbird 5. As you can

see I have taken over your facilities.

You no longer

control your operational systems.

Scene change back to the kids in the vent. They can stick their

heads out of the vent and see into the

Command and Control Room, but they are hidden behind a panel

and the Hood and his minions

cannot see them.

They've taken over.

Warm them up, Transom.

Increasing temperature to maximum.

The children are now looking into the Command and Control room.

Kyrano and his wife, Onaha, are

dragged in.

Who's the bald freak?

You? The Hood uses his powers on him

and he falls down clutching his head.

Dad!

They've got m-my dad.

Okay, you have our attention. Who are

you? What do you want?

Oh how rude of me. You can call me The

Hood. Now, listen, Mr. Tracy. We won't

be

negotiating. I'm going to use the Thunderbirds to rob the largest

banks in the world, starting with the

Bank of London. The world's monetary system will be thrown into

chaos and the Thunderbirds held

responsible.

You'll never get away with it.

Why the Thunderbirds?

An eye for an eye, Mr. Tracy.

An eye for an eye?

Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely

you remember saving the life of my brother,

Kyrano?

Turns to the video phone that the Hood

has been using to communicate with Thunderbird

5.

I'm sorry, Mr. Tracy. I thought he was dead.

(Laughs and then turns to the guards)Take

them away.

Yes, sir.

The kids lift their heads back up into the vents

Whoa.

That makes The Hood my uncle?

Every family has a black sh-sh- a black

sh- (Sneezes and everyone in the Command

and

Control room looks around, while Brains pretends that it was

him that sneezed.)

(Turns to look at Alan) This room's

murder with my allergies.

The kids stick their heads back out the vent and look at what

is going on in the Command and Control

room.

You left me to die that day. You may

have broken my body but you've no idea

how

powerful my mind has become. And now you will suffer, as I suffered,

waiting for a rescue that will

never come. (Makes a motion for Transom to cut off the call with

Thunderbird 5.)

Wait! (Video link cuts dead and then

the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5.) Scott,

status report.

CO2 levels are rising.

Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to

the emergency batteries. Clean the air.

How long will that give us?

About four hours.

Scene switches back to the kids looking into the Command and

Control room. Fermat begins to start

sneezing again. Tintin and Alan put their hands over his nose

and mouth to try and muffle the sound.)

Someone's there. (Mullion walks over

to the ceiling, he is standing directly

below where

they are. The kids are trying to leave the vents when his hand

shoots up through the ceiling and grabs

Alan's ankle. He lets go after Tintin bites his hand and he gasps

in pain.)

The children are now talking loudly and everyone in the Command

and Control room can hear them.

Run! Run!

No, jump! We can get through to the

silos.

The children scream as they fall down a tunnel leading to the

silos. And the scene switches to the

Command and Control room.

Apparently, the island is not as secure

as you thought. (he looks at the old

photos that were

on Jeff's desk. Children! Did you find any children?

(Using the security cameras to see into

the silos) Here they are. Thunderbird

2 silo, in the

loading arm.

Mullion and two other guards run off to get them

(Speaking to Transom) Seal them in.

Hold on!

The doors! You guys, let's go! C'mon

Go! Go!

The children reach the door that leads to Thunderbird 3's silo

just as it closes.

This way. (They run toward the still

closing Thunderbird 1 silo door.)

(After the door closes before they can

get through it) No!

They've got us trapped. What now?

If we can get to the Thunderbird 1's

silo, we can escape through the service

tunnel. But we

need a plan, Alan.

I'll use the Thunderizer on the door.

guards are in the elevator heading down to come get them)

You guys get the goons with the Firefly!

Alan! This equipment is only to be used

in an emergency. (Alan and Tintin give

him looks) I

guess this qualifies.

Yeah.

Here they come. Fermat, can you drive

this thing?

Uh, no.

Hey, watch it!

I took microbiology, not driver's ed.

Set the pressure to maximum.

Got it.

(The guards walk out of the elevator

and see Tintin pointing the Firefly

at them) Retreat!

(They fall over and have trouble getting up due to the slipperiness

of the stuff fired at them)

Let's move it.

That's it. Time to thunderize. (After

the door has a hole cut in it.) Yes!

Come on, let's go!

Get 'em!

Where's Fermat?

Fermat!

Fermat!

Coming!

Hurry up. (the children are now in Thunderbird

1's silo) What were you doing back there,

Fermat?

I had an-n-n idea.

Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open

the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan

types in a pass

code)

(To Tintin and Fermat) Go back. Yell

when you see them coming. (tries another

pass code)

Alan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can

see The Hood on the other side of

the door. Alan turns back and sees him.

Alan. You can run if you want. Were

you surprised to hear what your father

did to me? It is

frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect. But perhaps

you already suspected that about

your father. Why did he build these magnificent machines? Do

you suppose it was guilt? Because he

let your mother die. (Alan shakes his head no) Open the door,

Alan. (Alan continues to shake his head

no) (The Hood chuckles at his refusal) Open, the, door. (He tries

to use his powers on Alan but nothing

happens)

(Shouting to Tintin and Fermat) We can't

go this way. He's there.

The Hood uses his powers to open the door and Mullion and the

other guards appear at the other

doorway, leaving the children trapped.

No! (he falls slightly) Ow. What are

we gonna do, Alan?

I don't know. I'm thinking, okay? (Alan

looks at the control panel behind the

Hood and sees a

button that will open part of the floor under Thunderbird 1.

Keep backing up. I've got an idea. (Alan

takes his rock launcher from the pouch it is in on the back of

his pants. and fires it at the button, but

misses.)

That's your idea?

It's not me you're angry at, Alan.

It's not you I'm aiming at. (Alan fires

another rock and this time hits the

button and the floor

drops out from underneath Tintin, Fermat, and Alan. Tintin, Fermat,

and Alan scream as they fall.)

Get them!

Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1. And

set it on broil!

The kids look behind them while they are falling down the tunnel

and see the flames coming from

Thunderbird 1 behind them. Tintin screams even louder. The tunnel

opens up and leads to the ocean.

Back in Command and Control

No sign of them.

Of course not, the little brats went

up like firecrackers. Pop, pop, pop!

(laughs at Brains and

Brains moves to punch him.)

Don't, give him the satisfaction, Professor.

This is taking too long. Pick out the

equipment

you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird

2. No more delays.

Yes, sir.

Scene switches to the children trying to get onto the beach,

they are getting knocked over by a couple

of waves. Fermat is coughing and spluttering.

How about a little warning next time

you pull a stunt like that?

Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water.

I could have drowned.

You mean you can't swim?!

I repeat, I could have drowned.

Scene switches to the boys ringing out their shirts, they are

both in their boxers.

I said I was sorry, Fermat. Just put

this behind us, Okay? We gotta watch

each other's backs.

Nice drawers.

Thank you.

Boo!

No, c'mon Tintin, stay there.

You're worse than a couple of girls.

Hurry up and get dressed. (To Fermat)

Those are nice

drawers!

Scene switches to the children walking along one of the beaches.

Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird

5 via satellite, right?

Right.

So, there's a miniscule possibility

that if we reach the satellite station,

we could

Blow it up!

No, we could hack in to it and give

control back to Thunderbird 5.

Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's

do it. (Alan starts drawing the plan

in the sand) Here's the

plan. We're here, right?. So, we go along the shore around the

base of the mountain to the access road,

here. And then up to the transmitter. So what do you think?

Good. Except that we're here, not there,

and the transmitter is there, not here.

We have to go

through the jungle.

But that's f-f- off limits.

It's gonna be dangerous.

I'm in. (All three of them put their

hands together) We gotta get up there

fast! All our folks are

in trouble and if The Hood gets off the island

Actually, he's not going anywhere for

now.

The guidance processor for Thunderbird

2. You can't take off without it. Fermat

you're a genius.

How'd you get this?

Alan, my friend, what you don't know,

can't hurt you.

Scene switches to Lady Penelope's Country Mansion in England,

where Parker is out cleaning a car

when the car phone rings.

Parker?

Milady?

We have an emergency.

Scene switch to Lady Penelope's bathroom

What a charming fellow.

Someone knocks on the door.

Come in.

Parker enters Lady Penelope's bathroom, with tea, where she is

up to her shoulders in bubble bath.

Have a look at this, Parker. (There

is a computer monitor near her feet.)

He, and this

woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood.

Sounds like an alias, milady.

Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh

Belagant. Assumed dead when

his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the Malaya.

(takes a sip of tea) Oh, perfect, Parker.

The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mine workers, including Mr.

Belagant's brother.

Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant,

Kyrano.

How's my schedule, Parker?

You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord

Marlborough, a benefit gala for the

Institute of the

Blind, and incidentally there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore.

I suppose that's urgent.

Yes, milady. There was also a bridge

collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic

eruption in

Jakarta.

The Thunderbirds haven't responded?

No, milady. And the media is awash in

speculation vis-a-vis their whereabouts.

Parker turns on

the news.

Over to Lisa Lowe.

Chuck, disaster after disaster around

the world today and still no sight of

the Thunderbirds.

Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands

have been left homeless by a

volcano in Jakarta. Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible

machines

I think it's time to send the emergency

signal, Parker.

I fear you're not wrong, milady.

Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck.

Parker hits the top of the tea pot and a light pops out and begins

to blink and beep. Back on Tracy

Island a similar light begins to flash and bleep but Brains is

unable to get up to get to it because he is

tied up.

Scene switch to the kids walking through the jungle.

I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like

The Hood was inside my head back there.

What do you mean, Alan?

Maybe he can read minds or control minds

or something.

Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can

be explained by science.

I'm just trying to figure out his weakness.

Everybody has an Achilles heel, right?

My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles

heel. It's got a blister the size of

a basketball. Tintin!

Can we s-s-

Stop?

Yes!

No!

(sighs) Okay.

(Helping Fermat up the hill) No more

cheeseburgers for you, Fermat.

Scene change back to Lady Penelope's house.

Any word?

Nothing, milady.

Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough

that I've broken my shooting arm. We

shall send the Institute for the Blind a dozen guide dogs. And

bring the car around.

Yes, milady.

The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot

of trouble. And I don't like that. Let's

go,

Parker.

They get in the car and it takes off flying toward Tracy Island.

Scene switches to Mullion and the Hood

in the Thunderbirds hanger.

Ready for launch. We'll use this to

get into the vaults.

Subtle, as usual, Mullion.

I didn't realize we'd be getting points

for style. We're robbing banks, remember.

The Hood uses his power on Mullion and Mullion gasps.

Don't worry. You'll get your money.

(Looks over toward Thunderbird 2 and

speaks into headset) Transom, initiate

pre-flight

diagnostics.

An alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2.

What's going on?

It's the guidance processor.

What's wrong with it?

There isn't one.

Aaargh!

Clever Alan. It's the children. They

have it.

No way. They're dead. No one could live

through something like that.

I did. Get them, Mullion. Take whatever

you need. And make sure you get the

guidance

processor before you lose your temper.

Scene switches to the children in the jungle.

Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming?

Blossoming?! What's that supposed to

mean?

Come on, Alan. You've a c-crush on her.

You've got to be kidding. I mean, she's.

She's not that bad, I guess.

(Reaches the top of the mountain) Okay,

guys, take five.

(Still finishing climbing up the mountain)Five

isn't going to do it!

Guys?

Alan and Fermat reach the top of the mountain, they are both

puffing and panting. Tintin smiles at

them before she sees a scorpion on Alan's shoulder.

Don't move.

(Sees scorpion when he stands up next

to Alan) Whoa

What is it?

Hexdrotilous scorpion.

Is that dangerous?

.025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.

So, dangerous is in fact an understatement.

Tintin uses powers just like her uncle, The Hood, to lift the

scorpion off of Alan's shoulder and lets it

fall to the ground.

Watch out!

Tintin, what was that?

Let's get going.

Hey! She has the same powers as her

uncle, The Hood.

You think?

Must run in the family. Did you do that?

Just drop it, okay?

Still think everything can be explained

by science?

Not girls!

Scene cuts to Thunderbird 5 where there is an alarm and then

an explosion near Scott and Gordon.

Scott? Gordon? You all right?

We're okay.

The heat exchanger has blown.

You don't say.

Scene switches back to Mullion and two other guards searching

the jungle for Alan, Tintin, and

Fermat.

Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere.

Scene change to the kids at the satellite transmitter.

How we doing Fermat?

Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate

equipment. (The circuit board sparks.)

Which is

now b-b-broken.

Can you fix it?

Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something

to solder with.

We're in the middle of nowhere Fermat,

where are you going to find something

like that. (Tintin

and Fermat see Alan's retainer and share a look) What?

Alan yells as Tintin and Fermat pull out the metal part of Alan's

retainer.

Ow!

Perfect.

Gee Alan, I never figured you for a

crybaby.

I'm gonna kill you.

What'd he say?

I think it was some sort of apology.

I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat!

Okay, first step is to establish contact

with Thunderbird

5.

Scene switch to Thunderbird 5

Dad?

It's Alan!

Alan, where are you? Are you safe?

I'm at the satellite relay station with

Fermat and Tintin. Fermat's gonna hack

into the main

computer system and give control of Thunderbird 5 back to you.

We're standing by.

Okay, we're almost there.

Scene switches to Command and Control room with Transom and Brains.

Goodness me, Professor. You're so good-looking

without your glasses on. I think you

may

find that's another thing we have in common. Pretty? (She leans

in to kiss him, but an alarm sounds at

the control panel)

Oh now that's not fair. Just when things

were starting to sizzle.

(To the Hood as he walks in) A burst

of transmission from the island's satellite

station.

Should I jam it?

And give Mullion the coordinates.

Scene switches to Mullion and the two guards in a car. Transom

is communicating with him through

his headset.

Take the main track southeast, then

head up Satellite Hill.

Scene switches back to the kids at the satellite station.

They're onto us! We're being jammed!

Can you finish?

I'll try.

(Through the video phone) Alan, what's

happening?

Hang in there Dad, one more minute,

okay?

It's not going to work Alan. The signal's

too weak for data transmission.

Dad, can you hear me? They're jamming

the signal. We're going to lose you.

Don't worry, I'll

take care of everything, okay?

That's a negative! It's too dangerous.

Follow emergency procedure. Wait for

Lady Penelope at the

rendezvous point. Alan can you read me? (the screen begins to

break up)

Dad!

Alan we're losing you! Alan!

Dad!

Alan throws the video phone

No!

Useless!

It is now.

I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all

of us.

No, it's okay. I'm fine.

You don't have to be such a tough guy

Alan. I'm worried about my dad too.

I'd do anything to be with my parents

right now.

But The Hood knows we're alive now.

We have to go.

Even worse, they know exactly

Tires screech and Mullion and the guards appear.

Where we are!

Mullion and the other guards watch the kids running down the

hillside for a second.

Come on!

The kids fall down a ditch screaming and into a river.

Great, more water.

Tintin, can you slow 'em down?

I'd be delighted.

Then do it. And meet us at the junk

yard. Come on, Fermat.

Scene changes to Alan and Fermat discovering a hoversled in the

junkyard.

This'll get us out of here.

Scene change to Mullion hunting Tintin down in the forest.

There! Come on!

Tintin looks up and sees a bees hive.

Straight ahead.

Tintin uses a limb to hit the bee hive at Mullion and the other

two guards. Mullion falls off the car

and into a puddle while being stung by bees. The scene cuts back

to Alan and Fermat in the junkyard

attaching something to the back of the hoversled so that all

three of them can fit on it.

It's gonna make this thing hard to control

you know.

No problem.

You really must be careful not to exceed

four bars of boost or else

I said no problem.

Guys, let's go we've got to get out

of here. What is this?

It's a hoversled.

It's our ticket out, unless you've got

a better idea.

Yeah, let's wait for Lady Penelope,

like your dad said.

(Hands Tintin the seat to the hoversled)

Here.

Great plan. Let's sit and wait to get

caught. I say we do something. Now!

Right, Fermat?

Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't

think this is s-s-safe.

You don't think anything is s s-safe.

Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean

that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we

should make

decisions as a team.

Do you guys want to sit here and take

a vote? Or do you want to get out of

here? Cuz I'm going.

You can be a real jerk sometimes.

Scene changes to Mullion looking up and seeing the kids escaping

on the hoversled.

(To the guards driving the car) Go!

Go!

(After looking behind her and seeing

Mullion and the other guards in the

car getting closer to

them) Oh, no!

Come on! Faster!

Alan! You're going too fast!

I need more speed to get above the trees.

Hang on!

Tintin and Fermat fall off the hoversled screaming and at Mullion's

feet.

What'd I tell you guys? (looks down

and sees Fermat and Tintin being captured.)

Oh, no.

Scene switches to Mullion walking Tintin and Fermat to a door

in the Tracy house.

What are you doing?

Oh, no! Not the fridge!

Fridge door opens to reveal Kyrano, Onaha, and Brains.

Tintin!

Hey son.

Sweetheart, are you okay?

I'm fine, Dad.

(Grabs Fermat away from Brains and has

him sit down on a container) Cool off,

kid! (he

laughs evilly as he walks out of the fridge and closes the door

on the way out)

Scene switch to Park and Lady Penelope approaching Tracy Island.

Tracy Island approaching, milady. Switching

to aqua mode.

Isn't life fun, sometimes?

Rib-tickling, milady.

Scene switches to Transom and The Hood in Command and Control

getting an alarm that an aircraft is

approaching Tracy Island.

What is it?

We have an unidentified craft approaching

the island at high speed.

Scene switches to Alan climbing over a hill and seeing Lady Penelope's

car approaching.

Lady P!

Scene switches to Thunderbird 5

Phew! Somebody roll down a window. It's

getting a little hot in here.

Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in

37 minutes.

Oxygen's out in 30 so we won't feel

it.

Stop it!

Come on, Dad. The situation's hopeless.

No, it's not. There's still time. We've

got people on the ground working for

us.

Alan? He's just a kid!

He's a Tracy.

Scene switches quickly to Alan running through the forest and

then to Lady Penelope and Parker

walking up to the Tracy house

This doesn't look good, Parker.

No, milady.

That bougainvillea is absolutely parched,

and someone should do something about

that hideous hammock.

(After seeing Lady Penelope and Parker)

Whom do we have here? Mullion.

I must warn you that I know judo, krai

magna, and tae kwon do.

And I know Parker.

Milady.

(After Parker punches him in the face)

You've broken my nose.

Yes, that was very much the intention

of the maneuver.

(After she tries to attack Lady Penelope

and Lady Penelope pushes her over) Whoa!

One tries so hard in life to sort things

out on an intellectual-slash-conversational

level.

sometimes it's just not possible.

Lady Penelope continues to fight Transom and Parker continues

to fight Mullion, the Hood is watching

them.

(after Mullion threw him against a metal

cabinet) Shall I bring the car around,

milady?

Parker, have a bit of a lie-down.

(Sees Mullion behind Lady Penelope)

Excuse me, milady. (punches him and

after that has no

effect he picks up a frying pan and hits Mullion)

Transom goes back to fighting Lady Penelope and Mullion is fighting

Parker.

Ah, Lady Penelope! Of course he has

his palace. Why not his princess?

Flattery will get you nowhere. (after

she blocks the metal bar that Transom

was trying

to hit her with) Ow! Have you any idea what a manicure costs

these days?

(Is pushing Mullion forward) Coming

through, milady.

The camera quickly pans a little bit outside to show Alan hidden

behind some shrubs watching the

fight.

(After the Hood uses his powers to throw

a sofa at them) Duck, milady!

He's weak. Using his power makes him

weak. (The Hood, having heard something

looks over

toward where Alan)

You're formidable opponent Lady Penelope.

More than a match for most men.

That's not saying much, then, is it?

(uses his powers to stop the punch that

Parker was about to throw at him) I

suggest you

let us pass.

Don't try your parlor games on me you

sad, little man. You've committed a

serious

crime trespassing on this island. And in about (looks at Parker's

watch) four seconds, I'm going to get

quite cross with you. (the Hood uses his powers to stop her foot

which was about to come up and kick

him.)

(with his back still to Alan) How are

you, Alan? (he uses his powers on Parker

and Lady

Penelope and they cry out in pain) (Alan moves to run back into

the jungle) I hope you don't think I'm

going to chase you. (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope

and they cry out in pain again)

You can make it stop, Alan. (Parker and Lady Penelope cry out

again) You have something that belongs

to me.

Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't

the first time my head's been pulverized.

And it's never

done any real harm before. (The Hood once again uses his powers

on them and they cry out in pain

louder this time)

(comes out of his hiding place) Stop!

Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the

guidance processor

toward the pool) Fetch! (the Hood uses his powers to bring it

over to him before it can hit the water)

You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give

you that. (to Mullion and Transom) Put

them with the

others. (Transom grabs Parker)

(To Lady Penelope and Alan) You're coming

with me. (Grabs Alan's arms and throws

Lady

Penelope over his shoulder)

Put me down! This outfit is couture.

Scene switches to Thunderbird 5.

Don't go to sleep. John, look at me.

Keep your eyes open.

Scene switches back to the fridge where Mullion and Transom are

taking Alan, Lady Penelope, and

Parker.

You need to cool off, milady.

Lady Penelope!

(To Mullion) Big oaf! (The fridge door

closes leaving them trapped) Right,

that's quite

enough losing for one day.

(To Fermat) So, how does it feel to

be right all the time?

Not b-bad, actually.

I'm so sorry, Fermat.

We make quite a pair. It's hard for

me to t-t-talk. It's hard for you to

l-l-listen.

Parker, I have an idea.

Excellent, milady.

Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys

have?

I can't think. I'm too c-c-cold.

Scene switches to Transom, Mullion, and The Hood in Thunderbird

2 about to leave Tracy Island.

The guidance processor has been installed.

Thunderbird 2 is ready for takeoff.

What is our ETA?

Under an hour. Bank of London, here

we come!

Scene changes back to the fridge.

We've got to be quick. The Hood's getting

away.

In position, milady.

Here we go.

Launch sequence, stage two. (Lady Penelope

kicks her shoe at an icicle

which falls and cuts through the ropes tying Parker's hands together.)

Yes!

Good shot, milady.

(As they are untying everyone) Come

on, Parker. Let's give the bad guys

a good

thrashing!

Scene switches back to Thunderbird 2 launching

Stage three.

Scene changes back to the fridge.

(trying to figure out how to open the

door) This seems to be a six-lever mortise,

milady.

I love it when your checkered past comes

in handy Parker.

Thank you, milady. Unfortunately, I

fear I shall need a piece of wire to

access the mechanism.

(Lady Penelope's hand goes up shirt to get her bra wire and everyone

turns around)

Will this suffice, Parker?

Most certainly, milady.

I didn't actually need it, anyway.

Of course not, milady. (Parker gets

the door open)

Quick! They're getting away

Okay, everyone get to the control room.

(Hands Parker his hat) Hat.

Scene switches to everyone running into the Command and Control

room

Get in there quick, Fermat, and save

my family. Then we'll get The Hood.

Good luck!

Looks like they slipped a backdoor key

into the access codes.

I'll follow your lead, son.

(Using the video phone to talk with

Thunderbird 5) Thunderbird 5 come in.

Thunderbird 5 come in.

How long have they got before re-entry?

90 seconds and counting

I'm in!

Good job, Fermat.

Okay, I just need someone on their end

to confirm the access protocol.'

Thunderbird 5 come in.

Dad, come on are we coming through?

Mr. Tracy, can you hear me? Come in.

Thunderbird 5 come in.

Dad, come on!

Mr. Tracy, can you hear me? Come in.

Dad!

Thunderbird 5 come in.

How long have they got?

45 seconds until re-entry.

Damn it, Jeff! Wake up!

I think that's the first time you've

ever called me by my first name, Brains.

Thanks for waking me.

Dad!

Alan! Well done.

Mr. Tracy, confirm access protocol.

Confirmed. We are back online.

Gravity is restored. Put Thunderbird

f-f- your craft into geostational orbit

immediately.

FAB, Brains.

Looks like we're good to go.

Dad, are you all right?

We're fine. We still have a job to do.

Where's The Hood?

He's in Thunderbird 2 Mr. Tracy headed

for L-L-L

London.

She's right.

He's got the Mole on board.

Looks like Thunderbird 3 lost a booster,

Dad. We'll never get there in time.

Let me go after The Hood. He'll destroy

everything you've built everything the

Thunderbirds stand

for.

Negative. I'm sorry it's too risky.

I can do this. You know I can. What

am I saying? (Puts his arms around Tintin

and Fermat) We

can do this.

Okay, Alan. We'll meet you there. Thunderbirds

are go!

FAB.

(to his sons' on Thunderbird 5) Okay,

boys, we are outta here.

Are we really going?

Yep.

Oh, boy!

You ready, Fermat?

N-n- I guess!

Scene switches to Alan, Fermat, Tintin, and Lady Penelope in

Thunderbird 1 with Alan and Fermat at

the controls.

Flight controls are green.

Anti-detection shield activated

Hydraulic systems are good.

Right. Set primary fuel pumps. Main

engine start.

(To Tintin) Don't boys just love their

toys?

Complete.

And off we go!

Scene switches to Thunderbird 2 entering London.

Get the bridge up! Get the bridge up!

Scene switches back to Thunderbird 1.

Thunderbird 1 come in.

Roger, Brains.

Situation update, Thunderbird 3 is about

to initiate separation.

FAB.

Boys, Thunderbird 2 is in final approach

to London.

I know The Hood's weakness, Fermat.

I can stop him if we get there in time.

Stand by. We're going to maximum thrust.

Whoaaaa!

Scene switches to Thunderbird 3 separating from Thunderbird 5

Gordon, heat 'em up.

Thunderbird 2 lands in a park near the London Eye and causes

panic.

We're getting reports of some kind of

incident in London involving the Thunderbirds.

Lisa, are

you there?

Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where

Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu

landing,

causing total panic in Central London. As far as we know there

has been no emergency call from this

area so it's unclear why Thunderbird 2 would be active here at

all. I don't know if you can see this Chuck

but Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading some kind of machine.

Scene changes to inside the Mole with Transom, Mullion, and The

Hood.

Set a course for the vault.

Sir, if we continue on our present course,

we'll sever the monorail's subterranean

supports.

Shall I correct our position?

Stay on course.

But sir, we'll cause a major disaster.

No, we won't. The Thunderbirds will.

The Mole severs the subterranean support leaving one monorail

car stranded in the air. Scene then

switches to Thunderbird 1

Let's get her down, boys.

Initiate landing, Fermat.

Right.

Retros at 75 flaps to 16.

FAB.

You're going too fast.

Thanks. Retros to 90.

Thunderbird 1 lands.

Textbook, boys.

Scene switches to the Mole

Activating electromagnetic pulse to

disable the bank's security systems.

ETA, one minute.

Scene switches to Lady Penelope in Thunderbird 1 talking to Parker

on her cell phone.

Parker, meet me at the Bank of London.

Yes, milady.'

Alan, Tintin, and Fermat run to Thunderbird 2. Scene switches

to Thunderbird 3 re-entering Earth's

atmosphere.

Ride it out, boys!

Scene changes to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat in Thunderbird 2.

The Hood's getting away.

Those people can't hold on much longer.

What are we gonna do, Alan?

We're the Thunderbirds. Our duty is

to save those people. Brains, we're

going into the accident

zone.

FAB, Thunderbird 2 and good luck.

Brains, the monorail is down. Repeat,

the monorail is down. I'm going underwater

in

Thunderbird 4. You have the bridge. (turns on autopilot)

Me?! Fly alone?!

Fermat, the Thunderbirds need you right

now. I need you.

FAB, Alan. (turns off autopilot)

Scene switches to Thunderbird 3 flying to London.

Brains, come in, what's the situation?

The Hood has caused a disaster with

the Mole mono-mono-mono- one-track railway

is down in

the Thames.

Where's Thunderbird 1?

It's on the ground. The k-k-kids are

in Thunderbird 2.

FAB. We're right behind 'em.

Scene changes to Mullion, Transom, and the Hood in the Bank of

London.

Look at all this gold!

Stay focused, Mullion. Nine more banks

to go.

Scene changes to Alan in Thunderbird 4.

Fermat, deploying Thunderbird 4 in three,

two, one, Thunderbird 4 is go. I can

see the monorail.

People are panicking in the monorail and a little girl is crying

for her mommy.

Don't panic, guys.

Fermat, I'll hold the monorail in place.

Can you get a line on that stanchion

and lift it up?

I can't get a clear fix on the target.

I might hit the passengers.

I'll go and fix it myself.

What you mean swim?!

Get me as close as you can.

How are we doing on that line Fermat?

Just look out your window.

Come on, Tintin, come on!

Come on. Come on, Tintin. You can do

this. (Tintin successfully connects

the rope to the

stanchion and swims toward Thunderbird 4's airlock) Opening the

airlock.

OK, Fermat, we need a lift.

FAB, Alan. Commencing reverse thrust.

That was amazing, Tintin.

Thank you.

Nice job, Fermat.

Nothing to it, really.

(To Tintin who is helping him lift the

monorail out of the water with Thunderbird

4) Easy does it.

Thunderbird 3 has landed and Jeff, Scott, John, Virgil, and Gordon

are running over to the river bank

to look for Alan in Thunderbird 4.

There they are! (Everyone cheers)

(After he and Tintin have gotten out

of Thunderbird 4) Glad you could finally

join us.

Hey don't get cocky after one mission.

We still have a dangerous situation.

I need you boys to

close down this accident scene. Tintin, go get Fermat. Meet us

at Thunderbird 1. Alan, you come with

me.

Okay let's clean it up guys.

We got to get to the Bank of London

fast.

Lady Penelope went after The Hood.

I know, she may need help.

Scene changes to The Hood inspecting a diamond at the Bank of

London.

Ashes to ashes, diamonds to diamonds.

Lady Penelope. What an unpleasant surprise.

Don't be rude. I can't tell you what

a pleasure it would be to use my little

finger to pull

this big trigger. Now, don't move!

Mullion. (uses his powers to knock the

gun from Lady Penelope's hand)

That's not cricket.

I'm sorry. The only part of sport I

ever liked was winning.

How ghastly.

Scene changes to Alan and Jeff in Thunderbird 1.

Hey, Dad. That stuff The Hood said,

about you leaving him to die. He was

lying, right?

No. See, you can't save everyone, Alan.

It doesn't matter how hard you try or

how brave you are.

It doesn't even matter if it's someone you love, someone you'd

give your life in a second to save. You

just can't save everyone.

What was Mom like?

She was a lot like you. Come on, we've

got a job to do.

Scene switches to Lady Penelope being handcuffed at the Bank

of London.

Finish her off, Mullion.

Shame on you. I always despise a man

who delegates the important jobs. (sees

the

look Mullion is giving her) Oh, dream on, sad act. (Mullion chuckles

and walks away.)

Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Tintin, and Fermat about to enter

the Bank of London when Parker pulls

up.

Good timing, Parker.

Good afternoon Mr. Tracy.

Come with us.

My pleasure, Mr. Tracy.

Scene switches to The Hood talking to Mullion and Transom.

The Thunderbirds. They're here. Kill

them all.

Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Parker, Tintin, and Fermat inside

the Bank of London.

Alan, you guys stay here with Parker.

I'm gonna go find Lady Penelope.

But what about The Hood? (Alan points

behind Parker) Look out, Parker! (When

Parker turns

away Alan runs after his dad.)

Master Tracy!

Look out, Parker!

Alright, that's enough of that.

(from behind Parker) Don't move. (Parker

motions for the kids to run forward

but Transom

blocks them. Parker puts his hands up as if to punch her)

Go on, then.

No, sorry. I can't hit a lady.

Allow me. (she kick Transom and runs

off, Transom chases her)

(To Fermat) I've been waiting to get

my hands on you brats.

And I've been waiting to get my hands

on you.

They brawl for a few seconds before Mullion lands a good punch

on Parker.

Ow, now that was a punch.

Parker, can we wrap this up?

What did you have in mind, Master Hackenbacker?

Strategically speaking, the best odds

of success lie with the Parker Haymaker.

I concur. (they knock Mullion out)

Scene changes to Jeff running into the room that Lady Penelope

is being held captive in

Penny!

Jeff, no!

Did you save them all this time, Jeff?

Or did you leave someone behind?

I didn't make you what you are.

It's not me you have to convince. (motions

his head toward the entrance of the

room

where Alan is standing)

Leave my son out of this- (the Hood

uses his powers to throw Jeff into the

cage that Lady

Penelope is handcuffed in)

Jeff!

Dad! (Alan runs toward the closing cage

door and reaches it right as it slams

shut) Dad! Dad!

I'm disappointed in you, Alan. I thought

we were kindred spirits.

Well, we're not. I'm Jeff Tracy's son.

You certainly are. (Alan runs at him)

No!

Alan no! (The Hood uses his powers to

throw Alan off to the side where he

slams

into a wall)

Alan!

The Hood looks dazed but then uses his powers to fly up to the

catwalk above the Mole. The scene

then switches to Tintin being chased by Transom running into

a cage.

Come here, you little minx! (Tintin

jumps up on a bar and flips to the other

side while

Transom runs into the wall) Ow!

(Closing the cage door) Bye-bye.

Scene switches back to the room with The Hood, Alan, Jeff, and

Lady Penelope.

Alan, stay back.

You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's

footsteps. (uses his powers to lift

Alan off the

floor and makes him start choking himself with his own hands)

Let him go.

Did you really think you could challenge

me?

Let him go, please.

Let him go.

Please! Let him go! (the Hood tightens

his hold of Alan and then releases him)

Alan! Are you all right?

Alan, get out. Run!

He's getting weaker. He can't last much

longer.

Neither can you! (Alan begins to climb

up the Mole to reach the Hood) Alan,

no! Look out! (The

Hood starts the Mole with his powers and Alan has to jump and

grab the railing of the catwalk) Alan!

I'm glad you could be here to see this,

Jeff. (steps on one of Alan's hands

until he cries in

pain and lets go)

Goodbye, Alan! (Steps on the other hand

and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs

into the room)

No!

Ah, (uses his powers on her) (She uses

her powers on him as well) Oh!

(The catwalk flips over making Alan safely on top and the Hood

dangling above the still active Mole.

Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. (releases

one hand from the railing) Like your

father did.

I don't want to save your life. (the

Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan

grabs it) But it's what we

do.

Scene switches to The Hood, Mullion, and Transom being led to

a police car outside the Bank of

London when Thunderbirds 1,2, and 3 fly above them.

See you soon, Jeff.

(To Lady Penelope as she climbs in the

car) Now, that was definitely showing

off.

Scene changes to back at Tracy Island. Scott, Virgil, John, and

Gordon are playing in the pool. Jeff is

grilling with Lady Penelope standing next to him. Fermat is getting

swimming lessons from his dad

and Alan is watching.

Hey, Scott.

Get him!

(To Jeff) What did you put in these

margaritas?

It's a Tracy secret.

(To Fermat) That's my boy! One more

week and you're gonna be swimming like

a F-f-f-D-d-d-

Sha-sha- sha-Aquatic creature.

Good job, Ferm.

(To Alan as she spins around) So, what

do you think?

He's getting there. (Looks at Tintin)

Whoa, Tintin! You're just really, um,

blossoming.

Ew! Did you say "blossoming"? (smiles

at him)

(rings a triangle) Gather around everybody.

I have an announcement to make. Tonight

is a special

night. We're all together because of three very special people.

Fermat, Tintin, Alan. The world needs

Thunderbirds and the Thunderbirds need you. (gives each of them

International Rescue pins)

Mr. Tracy!

Thank you, sir. (Camera pans quickly

over to Parker who is tearing up)

Congratulations, Alan. No short cuts.

You earned it. You all did.

(To Onaha and Kyrano) I'm not usually

an emotional man, but sometimes even

the toughest

nut must crack.

(As all four of Alan's brothers walk

over to ruffle his hair and congratulate

him) Hey, way to go,

sprout!

That's my boy, Alan! That's my brother.

(Fermat and Alan are thrown into the

pool by Scott,

John, Virgil, and Gordon who jump in after them)

(answering his phone after it rings)

Yes, Madam President. I see. Of course,

straightaway. Boys.

Sorry, Penny. Duty calls.

Of course it does. And quite right too.

Scene switches to all five Tracy boys lined up in their uniforms

about to go on a rescue mission. The

older four are looking at Alan.

Thunderbirds are go!

Scene switches to Lady Penelope and Parker in a pink pedal boat

Fast as you can, Parker.

Certainly, milady.

Credits Roll with music by Busted playing in the background

Thunderbirds Are Go

Spring breaks come around and there's more heroes to be found.

There's something major going down on Tracy island, island.

Weapons underground keeping our planet safe and sound

If someone evils coming round they should be frightened (frightened)

Cause now the boys are back in town. No strings to hold them

down down.

(Chorus)

Don't be mad please, stop the hating just be glad that they'll

be waiting,

Friends we have aren't ever changing

You know the lid's about to blow, when the thunderbirds are go.

Kids are learning fast they know the t-birds kick some ass

Be sure that there's no coming last cause you're on their side

(their side)

It always looks so cool when spaceships come out of the pool

You know that you'd just be a fool to be a bad guy (bad guy)

Cause now the boys are back in town no strings to hold them down

down.

(Chorus)

Don't be mad please, stop the hating just be glad that they'll

be waiting,

Friends we have aren't ever changing

You know the lid's about to blow, when the thunderbirds are go.

Thunderbirds are go,

(Chorus)

Don't be mad please stop the hating just be glad that they'll

be waiting,

Friends we have aren't ever changing.

You know the lid's about to blow, when the thunderbirds are go.

Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go

Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go

Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go

Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go.
