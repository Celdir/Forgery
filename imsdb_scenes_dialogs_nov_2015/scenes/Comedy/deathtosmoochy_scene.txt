DEATH TO SMOOCHY

BEGIN CREDITS

EXT. KIDNET STUDIO -C - EVENING

A man in a puffy foam-rubber rhinoceros costume dancing

under the bright friendly lights of a television studio.

Another rhino and various foam-rubber animals dance

behind him to the happy MUSIC. The rhino finishes his

number and takes a bow. A bleacher full of kids bursts

into wild applause.

INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

After the taping. The rhino lumbers down the hallway

toward wardrobe. He is suddenly grabbed by two large men

and dragged out through the exit into...

INT. DARK PARKING GARAGE

... where several   thugs in overcoats emerge from the

shadows and start   beating him with lead pipes. One of

the men pulls out   a GUN and SHOOTS the rhino several

times. The SHOTS    REVERBERATE through the empty garage.

FINAL CREDIT:

SUPERIMPOSE:    ONE YEAR EARLIER

FADE UP ON:

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

It's the taping of another children's show -- "Rainbow

Randolph and the Krinkle Kids." RANDOLPH SMILEY, a

clean-cut man with a happy face and yellow bow tie,

dances through Rainbowland with the "Krinkle Kids"

(little people in top hats). He sings one of his

signature songs: "Friends Come In All Sizes." One of

the main Krinkle Kids -- ANGELO PIKE -- dances behind

him.

CONTINUED:

MONTAGE - RAINBOW RANDOLPH MERCHANDISE

"Sugar Rainbows Cereal," plastic toys lined up on store

shelves, kids playing with Randolph dolls, kids eating

"Rainbow Potato Chips" and "Rainbow Candies." A "Rainbow

Burster," a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows.

Marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc. We

get the picture. Rainbow Randolph is the king of the

kid shows.

INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT

A suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter. They find

Rainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch. Hair

slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer

looks so friendly. He nods for them to sit down. After

a nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the table

and slides it to Randolph. Randolph takes a gulp of his

Scotch. He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. Five

grand stares him in the face.

Randolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple.

CONTINUED:

Randolph rises. He takes a final gulp of his Scotch and

picks up the briefcase.

He starts to walk off. Suddenly, the Husband and Wife

jump up from the table holding guns.

Federal agents storm into the bar and surround Randolph.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAWN

Bundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb

from passing trucks.   The various headlines blare:

"RAINBOW RANDOLPH BUSTED ACCEPTING BRIBE"

"FCC PROBES KID SHOW BIZ"

"CORRUPTION IN KRINKLELAND"

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

The Rainbow Randolph/Krinkle Kid set is being dismantled.

Backdrops are rolled up and the giant rainbow centerpiece

is wheeled off. Workers with push brooms sweep up tons

of glittery "magic Rainbow dust."

INT. NETWORK BOARDROOM - KIDNET - DAY

We are TIGHT ON the sweating face of a MAN who looks like

he's about to be executed.

STOKES

is standing at the end of a long conference table as the

NETWORK BRASS glares at him.

The network CEO, a hog of a man, cuts him off.

Another EXECUTIVE chimes in.

CONTINUED:

A giant hand slams on the table. All heads snap.

The CEO drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany.

Deafening sound.

INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY

Stokes sits behind his mahogany desk, sipping a glass of

wine as he goes over potential Randolph replacements with

NORA BISHOP, his pretty protege.

Nora kicks the table in frustration.

CONTINUED:

Stokes flips through a thick stack of files.      He suddenly

stops at one.

Nora laughs.

Stokes stands up and walks around the room.

CONTINUED:

Stokes stops pacing.

Stokes gazes out the window at the city.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND - EARLY EVENING

The lighted Ferris wheel spins CENTER FRAME. We CRANE

DOWN and eventually LAND ON a side street with the

amusement park looming in the b.g. We're in FRONT of a

small building. The half-lit neon sign reads: CONEY

ISLAND METHADONE CENTER. We DRIFT THROUGH the double

doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies

loiter and fill out paperwork. We CONTINUE DOWN a

narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and

playing the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGH

another set of doors marked "Treatment Room." The

singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the

"performer" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy.

Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES.

CONTINUED:

Smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the

patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass

window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of

methadone which they immediately drink.

The Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam

rubber that exposes Sheldon's painted face in the front.

A multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead.

The song ends.       A few baffled junkies applaud.

We PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit.      Standing there in

her coat, looking mortified, is Nora.

INT. RECEPTION AREA - SHORT WHILE LATER

Nora sits in the reception area. Sheldon emerges in his

street clothes. He carries Smoochy's body on a hanger

over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which

holds Smoochy's head.

Sheldon stops.

CONTINUED:

She hands him her card.     He reads it.

Sheldon grabs her hand and shakes it.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - NATHAN'S HOT DOGS - SHORT

WHILE LATER

Sheldon and Nora stand at the crowded counter at

Nathan's. Sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily-

garnished, oddly colored hot dog. Nora winces as

she watches him.

CONTINUED:

He takes another bite.

He pulls the stained, misshapen Smoochy head from the

shopping bag.

Sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud.

CONTINUED:

Nora looks glassy-eyed.      She takes a deep breath.

She almost chokes on the word.

Sheldon laughs.

CONTINUED:

PREP MONTAGE

KIDNET STUDIO WARDROBE ROOM. A team of designers and

seamstresses cut, sew and shape endless sheets of orange

foam rubber. Sheldon stands on a wooden box as he's

measured from head to toe. On the wall is a blueprint

labeled "Smoochy the Rhino -- REDESIGN."

A costume designer walks over with the new Smoochy head

and places it on Sheldon.

As seamstresses fit him with the new Smoochy costume,

various signs and billboards FLOAT THROUGH the FRAME,

trumpeting copy like: "IT'S ALMOST SMOOCHY TIME!"

"GET READY TO BE SMOOCHED, AMERICA!" "ONLY TWO MORE

WEEKS TILL SMOOCHY!"

KIDNET STUDIO -C.

Sets, props, and camera equipment are rolled into the

studio. Through a SERIES of DISSOLVES we see the

Smoochyland Magic Jungle take shape.

KIDNET STUDIO -C - LATER

A choreographer maps out a number for Smoochy and the

"Rhinettes." (The Rhinettes are the former Krinkle Kid

little people with horns strapped to their foreheads.)

CONTINUED:

Nora and Stokes watch from the wings with a mixture of

uncertainty and disgust.

WARDROBE ROOM

A seamstress zips up the back of the finished, redesigned

Smoochy costume. Sheldon stands proudly before the

design team. Smoochy is now television ready: smoothed

out, more colorful, less lumpy and exuding sunshiny

happiness.

STUDIO -C - BACKSTAGE

Smoochy is about to enter with the Rhinettes.      ANGELO, a

former Krinkle Kid, stands beside him.

STUDIO -C - PRACTICE TAPING

Suddenly lights up in all its multi-colored Smoochyland

glory. The bleachers are full of children.

The kids in the bleachers all scream in unison.

Smoochy bounds out on stage followed by the Rhinettes who

form a dancing circle around him.

CONTINUED:

The kids cheer as Smoochy and the Rhinettes featuring Angelo

Pike, go into their "It's a Fantabulous Day in Smoochyland"

number -- a catchy, bouncy song and dance routine that plays out

in the sugar-coated jungle of Smoochyland.

Smoochy dances right UP TO the CAMERA, FILLING the FRAME

with his friendly, puffy face.

END of prep MONTAGE.

EXT. DOCK BY RIVER - NIGHT (POURING RAIN)

A disheveled Randolph paces on a deserted dock. The

Brooklyn Bridge looms in the b.g. A car pulls up in the

b.g. Stokes gets out. Randolph moves under an awning.

Randolph takes a swig from a flask.

CONTINUED:

Randolph suddenly breaks down.

He now clings to Stokes' lapels.

Stokes pries Randolph's hands from his overcoat.

CONTINUED:

He looks Randolph squarely in the eye.

Randolph looks at him hopefully as Stokes straightens his

tie.

Stokes walks off.    Randolph watches him disappear through

the mist.

Stokes is gone. Randolph takes a swig from his flask and

wipes his chin with his sleeve. He stares out at the

river.

THUNDER CLAP.

SMOOCHY THE RHINO - DAY

as it erratically limps forward before DROPPING OUT OF

FRAME.

WIDER

The wind-up Smoochy lays upside-down on the carpet next

to Nora's desk, legs grinding lamely in the air. Various

Smoochy items are spread out on her desk top. A

restless-looking Sheldon and a few members of Nora's

staff are in on the meeting.

Sheldon raises his hand.   Nora ignores him and looks at

her watch.

Sheldon suddenly stands up.

Nora throws him an icy look.

CONTINUED:

Nora casually picks up a Smoochy Frisbee from her desk

and sails it toward the open door. It lands in the

hallway.

He walks out to the hallway.

John shuts the door.

He locks it.

EXT. KIDNET BUILDING - NIGHT

Nora emerges from the revolving door of the Kidnet

building which is located in the heart of Times Square

and heads down Broadway. Sheldon emerges from the

building.

She keeps walking. Sheldon catches up and walks

alongside her, occasionally getting jostled by passersby.

CONTINUED:

Nora stops.    She looks Sheldon in the eye for the first

time.

She walks off.

INT. PATSY'S - NIGHT

Sheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant, nursing a

drink and talking to the BARTENDER. He seems slightly

drunk.

The Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another

drink.

A sharply-dressed man, BURKE BENNETT, sits down next to

Sheldon.

The Bartender nods.    He looks over at Sheldon.

Burke extends his hand.

INT. PATSY'S - SHORT WHILE LATER

Sheldon and Burke now sit at a corner table.

Burke laughs.

He pounds his fist on the table.

CONTINUED:

Burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up.

He hands Sheldon his card.

EXT. PATSY'S - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph peers through the restaurant's front window. He

shivers from the cold as he watches Sheldon and Burke

shake hands. Burke heads for the exit. Randolph quickly

ducks into the shadows. A moment later, Burke exits the

club and walks down the street. Randolph pops out.

CONTINUED:

Burke walks off.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

In the litter-strewn alley, we PAN ACROSS several grocery

bags, broken egg shells, flour bags, butter wrappers,

mixing bowls and other baking ingredients. The PAN ENDS

ON Randolph, who stands over a barrel fire, holding a

spatula. A cookie sheet rests on the barrel. Randolph

removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully. We

now see that the cookies are phallic-shaped.

He sets the tray aside.

He laughs.

INT. KIDNET STUDIO - STAGE B - DAY

It's thirty minutes before a Smoochy taping. Dozens of

giddy children are led into the studio where they take

seats on the bleachers.

BACKSTAGE

Sheldon, in the Smoochy costume, sans head, lumbers up to

Nora. He holds a rundown for that day's show.

CONTINUED:

An angry Sheldon storms off in frustration, but then

stops. He looks back at her.

He moves on. Nora stares at him as he walks away. He

obviously got to her. As Sheldon heads toward the

studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring

at him from under the stairwell. After a beat,

Randolph emerges and slinks backstage. He's

clutching a duffle bag.

INT. PROP ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door.

He scurries over to the prop shelf and locates Smoochy's

multicolored "magic cookie bag." He opens it and tosses

the cookies into the trash can. Reaching into his

pockets, he pulls out his special homemade cookies. He

chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag.

He cackles to himself. He then notices a box in the

corner of the room. Scribbled in magic marker on the

side are the words: "Rainbow Randolph crap." He walks

over and pulls the box out. He slowly opens the flaps.

Inside is his old costume. He pulls it out and clutches

it lovingly. He smells it. The ECHOEY SOUND of his

THEME SONG comes flooding back to him for a moment,

along with the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING.

He holds up Smoochy's magic cookie bag.   He then stuffs

his old costume into his duffle bag.

INT. STUDIO B - LATER

The "Smoochy Show" is in the middle of a taping. The

Smoochyland Band is playing a fast, jazzy number ("Doin'

the Jiggy Ziggy") as Smoochy, the Rhinettes, and several

kids dance frenetically. The kids in the bleachers are

in hysterics as Smoochy shakes his body spastically. The

song finally ends. The kids in the bleachers jump to

their feet, cheering and applauding.

The kids in the bleachers erupt in unison:

CONTINUED:

The lights dim as the Smoochyland Band plays the "2001

theme." Smoochy's Magic Cookie Bag is lowered from the

ceiling by a filament wire. The kids go crazy.

ANGLE ON NORA

She looks pissed, but then looks over at the kids in the

bleachers. Their faces are filled with laughter. For

the first time she feels the connection Smoochy has with

them.

ANGLE ON RANDOLPH

He peers out from his hiding place backstage. His eyes

widen with delight as the Magic Cookie Bag continues its

descent.

ANGLE ON SMOOCHY

The cookie bag finally reaches Smoochy. He holds the bag

high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as

the Rhinettes and the kids crowd around him.

ANGLE ON RANDOLPH

CONTINUED:

SMOOCHY

His puffy orange hand reaches for the bag's clasp as the

MUSIC reaches its CRESCENDO.

RANDOLPH

He's practically shaking as he suppresses an insane

laugh.

SMOOCHY

He reaches into the bag, and with a grand flourish, pulls

out a flaming red penis cookie. The cookie is somewhat

misshapen and not perfectly formed. Smoochy gets a big

grin.

The kids "ooh" and "ahh."

ANGLE ON RANDOLPH

He looks confused.

BACK ON SMOOCHY

Smoochy pretends to "zoom" the penis cookie through the

air.

Randolph, whose face is now bright red, can't take it

anymore. He runs onto the stage. He grabs the rocket

cookie from Smoochy.

CONTINUED:

INT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

Three burly Kidnet security guards drag Randolph down the

stairwell. They beat the shit out of him and toss him

through the exit door.

The headline reads: "Rainbow Randolph Interrupts Smoochy

Taping." The subhead reads: "Runs Onstage Shouting

WIDE

Burke sits on the couch next to Sheldon, reading the

paper. He shakes his head in disgust. Nora sits in a

chair near Stokes.

Sheldon laughs.    Stokes and Nora sit stone-faced.

Sheldon applauds.    Burke stands.

He pats Sheldon's head like a dog.

CONTINUED:

Sheldon laughs, trying to lighten the mood.       Burke gives

him an affectionate slap.

Burke pours himself a drink from Stokes' private bar.

CONTINUED:

Burke walks over to Stokes' desk and leans across it.

Sheldon reaches in the bag and pulls out a revolver. He

recoils in horror and immediately drops it back in the

bag.

CONTINUED:

Burke and Sheldon look up and notice the hulking,

grinning figure of SPINNER DUNN standing over them.

Spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his

crooked nose and scarred face. He extends his hand.

FLASHBACK - INT. BOXING RING(S) - SOMETIME IN THE PAST

Through a SERIES OF CUTS we see Spinner getting pummeled

in various fights.

spectators.

INT. SPINNER DUNN'S RESTAURANT (PRESENT)

Spinner is still pumping Sheldon's hand.

Spinner starts Jiggying and Ziggying for Sheldon. He

bangs into a table and knocks over someone's drink.

Spinner stops, out of breath.       He leans over and hugs

Sheldon.

CONTINUED:

A powerful-looking woman, TOMMY COTTER, calls to Spinner

from the bar.

Spinner dutifully hurries over to Tommy.

ANGLE ON SPINNER

He shakes the Senator's hand as Tommy and a few other

tough Irish guys stand around. Spinner looks over

towards Sheldon.

Spinner releases the Senator's hand and rushes off.

INT. ANGELO PIKE'S RUNDOWN APARTMENT

(LOWER EAST SIDE) - NIGHT

We met him backstage with Smoochy... innocent face...

Angelo stirs a pot of soup in the worn-down but tidy

apartment. A "Rhinette" costume is draped over one of

the chairs. There is a sudden LOUD POUNDING on the door.

Angelo puts the spoon down and reaches behind some spices

on the shelf above. He pulls out a revolver. The

POUNDING continues.

Angelo puts the gun in his waistband and walks to the

door. He slowly slides the chain off and opens the door

a crack. Peering in at him are the bloodshot eyes of

Rainbow Randolph.

Randolph suddenly kicks the door open and tackles Angelo.

Randolph sits on top of the little man.

CONTINUED:

Angelo punches Randolph in the mouth and flips him over.

He now sits on Randolph, pointing the revolver to his face.

Randolph starts crying like a child.

Angelo sighs and puts the gun away.

INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - SHORT WHILE LATER

Angelo and Randolph sit at the small kitchen table.

Angelo watches as Randolph ravenously eats a bowl of

soup.

He points to a nasty bump near his eye.

He yanks his lip back to reveal a missing tooth.

He slurps another spoonful of soup and spits a bay leaf

on the floor.

CONTINUED:

He cackles insanely as he picks up a bottle of gin and

takes a deep swig. He passes out and falls off the

chair. Angelo leans down and lifts his head off the

floor.

Randolph doesn't respond.    Angelo slaps his face.

EXT. BROADWAY (TIMES SQUARE) - MORNING

We are ON the smiling goofy face of Sheldon, whose

picture graces the front page of Variety under the

headline, "MOPES TO EXECUTIVE PRODUCE SMOOCHY SHOW." The

subhead reads, "TENURE TO BEGIN TODAY." A dollar bill is

slapped down over the picture.

We WIDEN OUT to see Sheldon buying the magazine at the

newsstand in front of the Kidnet Building. He turns and

walks toward the Kidnet entrance. He stops and looks up

at the building. Smiling, he takes a deep breath and

enters.

INT. KIDNET HALLWAY - FEW MOMENTS LATER

Sheldon whistles as he walks down the hall, giving

cheerful "hellos" and "good mornings" along the way.   He

enters Nora's office.

INT. NORA'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Nora is on the phone. She pretends not to notice him.

Sheldon bides his time by inspecting knickknacks,

examining photos on the wall, etc. Finally, he half-

whispers/half-mouths to her:

She hangs up.

CONTINUED:

Sheldon just nods and starts to exit.

He passes a plant by the door.

She ignores him.      He exits.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon walks slowly down the hallway.     He no longer has

a bounce in his step.

INT. SHELDON'S NEW OFFICE - MOMENT LATER

Sheldon enters his plush new office, awkwardly walks over

to his new desk and sits behind it for the first time.

Sheldon jumps. He's surprised to Tommy from Spinner

Dunn's restaurant. Tommy's crew, ROY, DANNY, JIMMY and

SAMMY occupy the sofa.

CONTINUED:

Sheldon laughs again.       Tommy gets quiet.

The guys look menacingly at Sheldon. They rise and walk

around his desk until they're on either side of him.

CONTINUED:

Tommy now smiles and walks over to Sheldon.       She musses

Sheldon's hair.

INT. SHELDON'S OFFICE - SHORT WHILE LATER

PHONE RINGS. Sheldon walks over and picks it up.

Sheldon punches line two.

CONTINUED:

INTERCUT:

INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - RANDOLPH

Sheldon hangs up stunned.       Nora walks in holding the daily

news.

"HUGE GATE EXPECTED -- VENDORS SALIVATE AT SMELL OF BIG

come INTO FRAME. Spinner and the mob ar clapping and

whooping.

a conversation.

Sheldon tears the contract in half.

Burke just sits there, stunned.   A waitress, SANDY,

passes by the booth.

CONTINUED:

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

We are now on a drum solo. Ernie the Elephant of the

Smoochyland Band works it. The animal band plays a

sloppy version of "Pop Goes the Weasel." End on Spinner

Dunn -- the newest and by far largest member of the band.

Spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating

intently on the proper moment to hit it. Unfortunately,

his rhythm is off, which throws the rest of the band off

as well.

We WIDEN OUT to see Smoochy and the Rhinettes attempting

to dance to the off-kilter rhythm. The song finally

ends. The Rhinettes glare at Spinner. Smoochy addresses

the camera.

Spinner stands up to take a bow and almost knocks the

entire bandstand over. There is a smattering of confused

applause from the kids in the bleachers. Spinner drops

the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor.

INT. BACKSTAGE - AFTER SHOW

Sheldon laughs nervously.

Merv and the thug laugh.

Sheldon is on the phone with Burke.

Burke hangs up. After a beat, Sheldon's DOORBELL RINGS.

He walks over to the door and opens it. To his surprise,

Nora is standing there.

Nora enters. She seems a little wobbly.    Sheldon notices

she's holding a pint of whiskey.

Nora looks at him for a moment.

CONTINUED:

Nora trips slightly.     Sheldon takes the whiskey from her.

He leads her out on the balcony.    They look out at the

city.

Nora looks down.

CONTINUED:

Sheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky-

Wunky dance. Nora does it with him. They both stop and

look at each other. Sheldon impulsively leans in and

kisses her.

Nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her.       They begin

kissing passionately.

CONTINUED:

They continue to kiss.      Nora abruptly stops.

Nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse.

Sheldon follows her to the door. She stops and looks at

him for a moment. The PHONE starts to RING. Neither of

them says anything for a beat.

She exits. Sheldon shuts the door and sighs. He goes to

the bar to pour himself another orange juice before

picking up the phone.

CONTINUED:

ANGELO'S APARTMENT

We GO TO a HORIZONTAL SPLIT-SCREEN. Randolph is on the

BOTTOM HALF. He lies on his bed in Angelo's apartment

wearing a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around his head.

His head dangles off the bed as he talks on the phone.

The SHOT is reminiscent of Bye Bye Birdie.

EXT. VERRAZANO NARROWS BRIDGE - NEXT MORNING

Staten Island.

middle of nowhere. Sheldon is now in costume. Randolph

rushes out of the door, very excited.

O.S. VOICE from inside.

We hear APPLAUSE.    Randolph quickly opens the rusty door.

He shoves Sheldon inside.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon runs in and immediately starts singing and

dancing on the makeshift stage.

CONTINUED:

Sheldon abruptly stops singing as a look of shock comes

over him. PUSH IN ON his troubled face.

INT. WAREHOUSE - SHELDON'S POV

Several hundred men in Nazi uniforms in a warehouse

draped in swastikas. They all start chanting:

A huge swastika banner unfurls behind Smoochy, framing

him like Patton in front of the American flag.

Flashbulbs go off. The "Heil Smoochys" continue. A

GERMAN MARCH starts to BLARE from the SPEAKERS. Looking

stunned, Sheldon slowly leans into the mic. He clears

his throat. The MUSIC STOPS. Everyone quiets down. He

searches for just the right words, and finally...

Suddenly, a sea of policemen bursts into the warehouse.

Pandemonium ensues us all the Nazis run for cover.

Sheldon stands in the middle of it all, unsure what to

do.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - SHORT WHILE LATER

Sheldon is led from the warehouse in handcuffs and is

barraged with questions from waiting REPORTERS.

Coos at a baby in a stroller...

And grabs a rose from a flower vendor before handing it

to an old lady...

He continues to dance onward, waving back at everyone.

Unfortunately, he doesn't realize he's heading straight

for a light pole and slams into it with a sickening

smack.

A disheveled and unshaven Sheldon wanders the streets,

looking dazed. He's stuffing a cupcake into his mouth

and swigging from a bottle of root beer. He passes a

construction site and notices some graffiti on a wall --

a crudely-drawn goose-stepping Smoochy in a Nazi uniform

and Hitler moustache. Sheldon keeps walking. He

descends the subway stairs at 42nd Street.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND STATION - STREET LEVEL - LATER

Sheldon comes up from the subway.    We see the Cyclone

from Astroland in the b.g.

EXT. SIDE STREET (CONEY ISLAND) - FEW MINUTES LATER

Sheldon stands in front of the methadone clinic he used

to perform at. It's boarded up. He just stares at it.

An OLD VAGRANT walks up to him.

The Vagrant shakes his head sadly.

He walks off.

INT. STOKES' OFFICE

On a large screen TV the smiling Asian face of Takashi

Yamashita, who's singing Cole Porter's "I Get a Kick Out

of You" in Japanese.

CUT BACK to reveal Takashi wearing a white sequined

tuxedo with tails as he plays a white grand piano. He

looks like an Asian Liberace. He is circled by a group

of Japanese children who sing along with him.

INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY

Several tough-looking Asian men -- CHICK, SAMBO, and TOBI

-- Takashi's management group -- sits in Stokes' office.

Takashi sits quietly in the corner. Stokes sits behind

his desk, sipping his trademark glass of wine.

CONTINUED:

Chick snaps his fingers and Tobi, the third Asian guy,

walks over and drops a duffel bag on Stokes' desk.

Stokes stares down at the bundle of opportunity on his

desk.

Stokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money.     He looks

up at Chick and smiles.

Chick smiles.

INT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

On Nora's TV screen, we see the black and white image of

Rickets the Hippo doing the "Klunky-Wunky Dance." Nora

sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen.

There is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up and ejects the

"Best of Rickets" tape. She opens the door. To her

surprise, Randolph is standing there.

Before she can respond, he enters the apartment and takes

off his jacket.

CONTINUED:

He flops down on the couch.

He laughs.

Randolph jumps to his feet.

Randolph walks over and puts his hands on her shoulders.

CONTINUED:

He leans in to kiss her and she shoves him away so

violently he almost falls over the coffee table.

Nora starts to walk closer to him.       He backs up.

Randolph just looks at her.

Nora hauls off and punches him in the jaw.

approaches Tommy.

CONTINUED:

Spinner lifts his head from the bar.

INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Randolph is napping on Angelo's couch with an ice pack on

his sore jaw thanks to Nora's fist. There is a sudden

After a beat, the door is kicked open and Tommy and his

crew are standing there.

Danny advances toward a shaking Randolph, fist clenched

and rolling up his sleeve.

RANDOLPH'S POV - DANNY

Danny's fist FILLS the FRAME, TURNING IT BLACK as we hear

the PUNCH.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - SERIES OF DISSOLVES - BEFORE DAWN

approaches.

Sheldon exits backstage.

INT. STUDIO C - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The lights in the studio dim.

An explosion of enthusiasm from the kids in the

bleachers.

CONTINUED:

The lights come up as the Smoochyland Band plays a

strong, dramatic version of "Battle Hymn of the

Republic." After a moment, Smoochy slowly rises from a

lift under the stage. A giant sign above the jungle

lights up and emits a pyrotechnic shower of sparks. It

reads: WELCOME HOME SMOOCHY!

ANGLE ON SMOOCHYLAND BAND

A beaming Spinner Dunn enthusiastically bangs his cowbell

to the music as tears stream down his cheeks.

BACK ON SMOOCHY

He majestically stands center stage and nods to the kids

who are giving him a standing ovation. The song

crescendos with a rousing final chorus from the

Smoochyland Band who sing, "His truth is marching on!"

Thunderous applause from the bleachers. Smoochy walks

over to a stool and takes a seat. It's very quiet in the

studio now. Smoochy, looking uncharacteristically

serious, picks up a microphone as the lights go down.

He's in black limbo.

Gasps from the bleachers.

ANGLE - NORA

watches nervously from offstage.

CONTINUED:

BACK ON SMOOCHY

The kids in the bleachers howl along with Smoochy.

The kids cheer as the Smoochyland Band launches into the

Hokey-Pokey song and Smoochy starts dancing. The kids

pour out of the bleachers onto the jungle set. Everyone

is dancing and having a ball. Nora is clapping to the

music offstage. Sheldon and Nora exchange affectionate

glances.

INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Randolph sits in front of the TELEVISION in a daze. He's

wearing a ratty bathrobe and absentmindedly tosses cheese

curls onto the floor from a bag on his lap. ON the TV,

an "Entertainment Tonight"-type show with two perky hosts

is covering Smoochy's return to the airwaves. The hosts,

Tara and Hunter show Smoochy's dynamic entrance and the

standing ovation he got during the taping that day.

CONTINUED:

The BROADCAST CONTINUES. Smoochy images flash across the

screen. Randolph has been mumbling the whole time.

He jumps up and kicks the TV over.    He picks up a lamp

and starts beating the TV.

Angelo, who was cooking in the kitchen, runs out.       He's

wearing an apron.

He grabs the lamp from Randolph.

INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - NIGHT

Spinner's massive arms envelope Sheldon in a bear hug,

practically lifting him out of his seat. Burke, who's

having dinner with Sheldon, holds onto the table before

it gets knocked over.

CONTINUED:

He drops Sheldon and pulls out his cowbell.

He starts banging on it with a butter knife.      Sheldon

cringes.

Spinner starts marching through the restaurant, clanging

the cowbell. People who are trying to eat their dinner

look annoyed. Sheldon sits back down at his table.

Burke gleefully slaps Sheldon on the shoulder.

CONTINUED:

Burke's grin suddenly fades.

Burke looks pale.

Sheldon rises and tosses his napkin down.

CONTINUED:

Sheldon exits.    Burke sits there, looking very concerned.

On his way out the door, Tommy stops Sheldon.       Spinner's

Sambo and Tobi start to advance on Stokes.

Chick leans into Stokes' face.

They exit.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A down-and-out Randolph shuffles along in ratty bedroom

slippers. He passes a MAN who sits behind a small table

on the sidewalk. The table has a huge photograph of a

rhinoceros taped in front of it. Literature and

pamphlets depicting the black rhino are spread out on the

table.

Randolph just looks at him for a moment. He looks at all

the rhino-related imagery. He starts shaking and

suddenly jumps over the table and attacks the Man.

Randolph grabs the collection can and runs off.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

It's a chilly, grey afternoon. Stokes and Burke walk along

the lake framed by the New York skyline.

Stokes stops walking and grabs Burke's arm.

The two men look at each other as thoughts pass silently

between them.

Burke smiles.

A slender young man in a Peter Pan costume in being held

by a big thug as another thug beats him up. A girl

dressed as Tinkerbell (also being restrained) looks on in

horror. Merv Green (Parade of Hope) steps INTO FRAME.

The thug punches him in the stomach again.

Merv nods to one of the thugs who releases Peter Pan.   He

slumps to the ground. Merv kneels down and lifts his

head from the pavement.

One of Merv's thugs leans in, whispers something to

Merv, who looks up to see.

Burke standing in the mouth of the alley.

EXT. ND STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Burke and Merv walk along 42nd Street. A poster

advertises Peter Pan "Sponsored by Parade of Hope --

Giving Children the Gift of Promise!" Merv's

He steps off the curb to hail a cab.

Burke hops into a cab.   Merv watches the cab pull away.

A crowd starts to form on the sidewalk.

He reaches down and picks up a can of gasoline.

Randolph raises the can over his head and pauses

dramatically.

He drenches himself with gasoline. The crowd grows

larger. He holds up a pack of matches.

The crowd starts to applaud.     Randolph looks baffled.

INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon sits in the back of a limo on his way to work,

reading the paper. The headline blares: "SMOOCHY

ANNOUNCES ICE SHOW AT GARDEN." The subhead reads:

"ALL PROCEEDS TO BENEFIT BROOKLYN CLINIC."

Sheldon glances up from his paper.

He goes back to his paper.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph sees the Kidnet limo approaching.

CONTINUED:

Randolph tries to light another match, but it's wet from

the gasoline. The crowd laughs and starts taunting him.

Randolph keeps trying to light the match. Finally, after

several attempts, it lights. He holds it up. The crowd

burst into applause.

He turns and faces the approaching limousine.

He brings the match closer to his gasoline-soaked body.

The limo continues to approach. The crowd taunts him to

do it. He tries to bring the match closer, but his hand

is shaking. Suddenly, a LITTLE GIRL pushes through the

crowd. Everyone quiets down as she looks up at

Randolph.

Randolph freezes as he looks down at the Little Girl. A

slight look of hope comes over his face. She smiles

sweetly at him, walks over, and blows out the match.

Randolph is overcome with emotion. Just then, Sheldon's

LIMO WHOOSHES past him. The crowd cheers.

CONTINUED:

They all run away from Randolph and over to Sheldon's

limo as it pulls in front of the Kidnet Building.

Randolph stares at them blankly. He looks down. The

Little Girl is gone. Sheldon gets out of the limo.

The crowd cheers him as he waves to them before going

inside.

A look of utter frustration now comes over Randolph.

OVERHEAD SHOT

Randolph drops to his knees on the table, looks skyward,

Sheldon gently tries to break the news to Spinner who's

on the verge of tears.

Spinner's face starts to perk up.

INT. STUDIO C - SHORT WHILE LATER

It's the middle of a Smoochy taping. Smoochy and the

Gang are wrapping up a song entitled, "My Stepdad's Not

Mean (He's Just Adjusting.)" The kids in the bleachers

are singing the chorus.

Smoochy continues the song.

The song ends. The kids in the bleachers applaud.

Smoochy addresses them.

The Smoochyland Band plays a little fanfare.

CONTINUED:

The Smoochyland Band plays a happy little song as Spinner

Dunn, in costume as Moochy, runs on stage. The Moochy

costume is identical to Smoochy only it's a darker

orange instead of bright orange.

Spinner freezes.       He stares at the camera.

Sheldon looks horrified. The Smoochyland Band quickly

launches into some music. Smoochy, Moochy and a few

other jungle animals begin to dance. Moochy's lumbering

movements are in stark contrast to the choreographed

steps of the others. As a bonus, he occasionally

scratches his crotch.

INT. SHELDON'S DRESSING ROOM - AFTER THE SHOW

A happy Spinner (still in costume as Moochy) pokes his

head into Sheldon's dressing room. Sheldon, still in

costume as well, looks drained after the difficult

taping.

CONTINUED:

Spinner dances off. A beat later, Nora enters and shuts

the door. There's an awkward beat of silence.

She nods.

Sheldon looks uncomfortable.

CONTINUED:

Sheldon suddenly jumps up and grabs her. He kisses her

passionately. Nora immediately starts ripping off his

costume as they make out. They fall to the floor in

a lustful embrace.

INT. STUDIO - BACK HALLWAY - SAME TIME

Spinner, humming to himself, lumbers down the hallway on

his way to the wardrobe room. Halfway down the hall, he

hears a voice call out to him.

Spinner turns around. The door to the fire exit swings

open. Two of Merv's thugs emerge and grab Spinner (who's

still in full Moochy costume) and drag him into the

stairwell.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - MOMENT LATER

Spinner is dragged into the garage and knocked to the

pavement. Several more thugs emerge from the shadows,

including Henry, Merv's main henchman. They start

beating him with lead pipes. Henry pulls out a REVOLVER.

He SHOOTS the rhino several times. A sedan trunk is

popped open and Moochy is thrown inside. The CAR

SCREECHES up to the street.

INT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT

We CRANE DOWN FROM a Chinese banner that stretches across

two tenements. We LAND ON the seedy, deserted street

below as the SEDAN BARRELS INTO FRAME and SQUEALS to a

stop.

CONTINUED:

Two thugs emerge from the car. They pull Spinner/Moochy

from the trunk and toss his body by some garbage cans,

knocking a few over. They get back in the car and speed

away. Moochy's lifeless foam body rolls into the gutter

and lays motionless. Blood seeps through his foamy

torso.

LOW OVERHEAD SHOT

of Spinner/Moochy. We SLOWLY START TO RISE UP as we LOOK

DOWN AT the rhino's body. The WIND WHISTLES through the

empty street as we get HIGHER. The Chinese banner

rustles THROUGH the FRAME. As we get HIGHER AND HIGHER,

we hear the intermittent CLANG of a PRIZE FIGHT BELL.

EXT. SAME STREET - HOURS LATER

In the same frame, detectives and uniformed cops are now

at the scene gathering evidence. Where Spinner once lay,

there is now a bright yellow chalk outline in the shape

of a rhinoceros.

An enraged Merv Green glares at his henchmen, Henry and

MITCH.

Merv's anger builds. He turns to a picture of Smoochy

which is tacked to a bulletin board along with other kid

show personalities that the foundation extorts. Merv

picks up a letter opener and violently thrusts it into

the picture.

INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - SHORT WHILE LATER

Cops rummage through Angelo's apartment. In the b.g.,

a detective, ELLIS, interviews Angelo. Another

detective, McCALL, is looking through some papers he

found.

Ellis walks over. McCall shows him some scribblings he's

found in a notebook of Randolph's. The crude drawings

depict Smoochy with his head cut off... with a knife in

his heart... being pissed on by Randolph, etc. "Die,

Rhino, Die" is scrawled hundreds of times, filling page

after page. The two detectives look at each other and

nod.

INT. SPINNER DUNN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

Spinner sleeps forever in an open casket, clutching his

cowbell. Dozens of Spinner's relatives are at the wake.

CONTINUED:

A bagpipe player plays "Amazing Grace." Sheldon stands

at the casket, fighting back tears as he stares down at

his old friend. Nora has her arm around him.

Tommy and the boys walk over. Tommy puts his arm around

Sheldon as he gazes somberly at Spinner.

Tommy's crew nods and agrees.

They head for the bar.    Nora and Sheldon look down at

Spinner in silence.

Sheldon joins in.

Sheldon looks at her.    They embrace as BAGPIPE MUSIC

SWELLS.

air: "MANHUNT UNDERWAY FOR RAINBOW RANDOLPH... SUSPECTED

IN BOXER'S MURDER... SEEN OUTSIDE BUILDING SHORTLY BEFORE

SHOOTING, DRENCHED IN GASOLINE AND ACTING PECULIAR..."

We CRANE DOWN FROM the zipper ONTO the sidewalk.

Randolph is talking on a pay phone. We hear Angelo on

the other end.

CONTINUED:

EXT. LIBERTY FLOUR AND BISCUIT FACTORY - NIGHT

We are outside the long-abandoned Liberty Biscuit and

Flour factory. The Liberty sign with its Statue of

Liberty logo is eroded and partially missing.

INT. LIBERTY BISCUIT AND FLOUR FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

ACTION

Inside the massive dormant factory, rats scurry around

and pigeons occasionally fly from window sill to window

sill. A makeshift living area has been set up in the

middle of it all -- a chair, lamp, small table, hot

plate, etc. Randolph lays on the dilapidated conveyor

belt, huddled under a blanket.

Angelo enters the factory through a rusty door, carrying

provisions.

Randolph sits up on the conveyor belt, blanket draped

over his shoulders. He's a physical and emotional wreck.

CONTINUED:

Angelo hops up on the conveyor belt to console Randolph.

Randolph rests his head on Angelo's shoulder.

He strokes Randolph's head.

Randolph sniffs and manages a small pitiful smile.

Angelo musses his hair.

CONTINUED:

Angelo lifts one of the grocery bags onto the conveyor

belt.

Angelo hops off the conveyor belt and turns on the hot

plate. He starts to open a can of soup. Randolph

reaches into the bag and pulls out a copy of the New York

Post. The lead article's headline reads, "WAKE FOR

SPINNER." A large photograph shows mourners leaving the

restaurant after the wake. Clearly visible are Sheldon

and Nora. They have their arms around each other.

Randolph's eyes widen. He starts to hyperventilate.

Angelo looks up.

Finally, Randolph expels a blood-curdling scream that

ECHOES through the factory.

Angelo drops the soup.      Birds in the factory flutter from

the rafters.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ICE RINK

Sheldon and the Rhinettes work on some choreography for

that night's show. Nora watches from the sidelines. As

Tommy's guys -- stand behind her.

Danny, holding a hatchet, advances toward Merv. Tommy

casually walks away. We STAY WITH Tommy. Merv is NO

He SCREAMS.

We hear the sound of the HATCHET HITTING its target.

Merv's pleading stops.

INT. STOKES' OFFICE - EVENING

Nora is alone in Stokes' office, rearranging cards on

the giant cork board that displays the network schedule.

She is startled to hear a deep voice behind her.

She turns around. Chick, Tobi, and Sambo are standing

there. Chick walks over to the cork board. He scans a

row of cards that all read "Smoochy."

He rips a Smoochy index card from the board, walks over

to her and waves it in her face.

Chick looks at his boys and chuckles.

CONTINUED:

He suddenly pulls out a switchblade and holds it to

Nora's throat.

He removes the knife from her throat and hurls it toward

the bulletin board. It lands -- sticking right in the

middle of a Smoochy card.

They exit.

INT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Nora is pacing.    Sheldon sits by the fire.

Sheldon's head is swimming. Suddenly the front door to

to the penthouse bursts open. Randolph, dressed like

he's about to do his old show, stumbles in waving a gun.

CONTINUED:

He almost trips as he stumbles over to Sheldon.      He

waves the gun in his face.

Sheldon looks stunned.    Nora hangs her head.

She looks at him, but doesn't say anything.

CONTINUED:

She looks down, somewhat ashamed.      A look of utter shock

comes over Sheldon.

He waves the gun threateningly as he backs up to an

armchair and sits down.

CONTINUED:

Nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar.

He grabs the bottle out of her hand. He rises from the

chair. He takes a CD, "PARTY TIME WITH RAINBOW

RANDOLPH," from his pocket and puts it into an

audio system on the fireplace wall.

The THEME SONG from his show starts to PLAY. He flicks

a switch and a spotlight goes on. He sings and dances.

CONTINUED:

Randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle.

Sheldon suddenly lunges at Randolph and tries to grab

the gun. Randolph shrieks. The two men wrestle on the

floor, but Randolph is not much of a fighter. He

screams as Sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace.

Randolph rolls Sheldon to the bottom. Nora reaches for a

fireplace poker and whacks Randolph with it. Randolph

cries out and drops the gun. Sheldon grabs it and points

it at Randolph who lies on the floor, blubbering like a

child. He's bleeding.

Sheldon slowly takes the gun away from Randolph's head.

Randolph sits up and looks at Sheldon through watery

eyes.

CONTINUED:

Randolph throws his arms around Sheldon and cries into

his shoulder. Sheldon pats his back. He glances down at

Randolph's gun and sees that it's a toy.

Nora pours vodka onto a small pillow she's taken from

one of the chairs. She kneels next to Randolph and blots

the gash on his head with the vodka soaked pillow.

Randolph lets out a blood curdling scream.

He exits.

INT. HAWAII KAI - LATER THAT EVENING

A hula dancer performs on a tiny stage in the nightclub.

A small Hawaiian string band plays behind her. Burke

Stokes buries his head in his hands.

A shadow falls across their table.    Burke looks up.

reaches for the phone.

INT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A freshly showered Randolph is wearing Sheldon's robe and

has a pink towel wrapped around his head as he lounges on

the living room sofa. He's eating grapes and reading

National Geographic. The PHONE RINGS. He picks it up.

We GO TO a SPLIT-SCREEN with Angelo.

CONTINUED:

Randolph thinks.    He suddenly looks very worried.

He rips the towel from his head.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - BASEMENT

Buggy, in his ill-fitting Rhinette costume, emerges from

the sub-basement carrying a thin suitcase. As far as

anyone's concerned, he's just another usher. He heads

Every seat in the arena is occupied. The lights are

lowered. A slow rolling TYMPANY is heard. After a

He takes a couple of deep breaths. We TILT DOWN and see

the bulge of the revolver under his Smoochy costume.

ICE RINK

The Rhinettes have formed a line across the middle of the

rink.

Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause. The entire

The applause and cheering don't stop for several moments.

One of the Rhinettes hands Smoochy a microphone.

More applause as Smoochy skates over to the Rhinettes.

They form a circle around him and slap hands in

solidarity.

The lights go down. A full orchestra begins to play the

overture to WAGNER's Tristen et Isolde. The lights come

up as a soprano -- a heavyset woman in a modified rhino

costume -- skates out through the fog and begins singing

the opera. Smoochy -- now wearing a peasant's frock --

skates an interpretive dance in the b.g. with a few

Rhinettes who are also dressed as peasants. A beautiful

fairy princess floats down (on filament wire) from the

rafters and takes Smoochy's hand. She skates away with

him as he waves good-bye to the Rhinettes.

Randolph finds a side exit and slips into the arena.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FEW MINUTES LATER

The "Opera on Ice" continues. The soprano continues

singing as Smoochy reenacts the incidents of his recent

life. The fairy princess brings Smoochy to a room with a

gleaming white desk. Smoochy takes a seat behind the

desk. The fairy princess places a crown on his head,

bids him good-bye, and floats away. Smoochy sits proudly

in his new world.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly, Rhinettes dressed as devils glide in and skate

in a circle around the desk. They throw money at Smoochy.

He jumps up and skates away, but the Rhinette devils

pursue him with daggers. The music from the orchestra

intensifies as the drama plays out.

Nora continues to watch the opera, totally entranced.

Stokes and Burke look a little on edge. Burke glances at

his watch.

Buggy finishes loading the rifle. He shines the barrel

with his sleeve and looks through the scope as Smoochy

and company continue to perform below.

POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

Atmospheric fog created by the smoke machine is so thick

that Buggy has difficulty FINDING Sheldon THROUGH the

cross-hairs. Occasionally, Smoochy skates through a hole

in the clouds only to disappear again. BUGGY CURSES in

frustration.

ARENA

Randolph pushes his way past Garden security and runs

toward the rink. Several cops working the event spot

him. A few spectators scream in horror.

ICE RINK

The soprano's mournful aria reaches its crescendo as

Smoochy is now pursued by Rhinettes dressed as Nazis.

They hold signs with words like "SCANDAL" and "SHAME."

Smoochy skates to a section of the rink resembling

Chinatown where he lands over a fallen "Moochy." He

cradles Moochy's head in his arms as the Nazis glide past

him and disappear into the fog.

TIGHT ON BUGGY'S FINGER

as he quickly squeezes off a SHOT.

RINK

The MUFFLED sound of GUNSHOT is absorbed by the intense

music. A wounded Rhinette falls to the ice, but no one

notices. Smoochy, oblivious, continues to skate toward

the "gates of heaven" with the angel Moochy. Giant white

gates slowly swing open at the rink's far end as floating

angels open their arms to welcome Moochy.

OUTER RINK

Randolph runs around the rink's perimeter, trying to get

Sheldon's attention. Cops and security push their way

towards Randolph. He suddenly notices the felled

Rhinette on the ice and looks skyward. He can make out

a rifle barrel protruding from the catwalk.

NETWORK BOX

Stokes and Burke notice a commotion in the audience.

They now see Randolph running through the crowd on his

way to the stairwell.

CONTINUED:

Nora notices the distressed look on their faces and

follows their gaze to the rafters. She now sees the

rifle barrel.

ANGLE - NORA

jumps to her feet.      FAST PUSH IN TO Nora's mouth.

She starts to climb out of the box but Burke stops her.

Stokes tries to put his arm around her.

She pushes him. He goes down hard. She starts to climb

out of the box. Burke tries to grab her, but she spins

around and punches him. She runs for the rink.

Stokes stands in the box looking dumbstruck as pande-

monium plays out around him. People are running in all

directions, cops are everywhere.

Burke runs off through the panicked crowd. Stokes looks

around and heads off in the opposite direction.

OUTSIDE RINK

Tommy and her boys notice the commotion in the audience.

They see cops pursuing someone. They realize it's

Randolph. Tommy, Jimmy and Sammy take off after him.

CATWALK

Buggy, in position again, looks through the rifle scope.

POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

As the soprano reaches for an impossibly high note, the

fog dissipates slightly and Smoochy's foam rubber head

COMES perfectly INTO VIEW.

BUGGY

smiles.

RINK'S EDGE

Nora screams.

CLOSE ON BUGGY'S FINGER

He's about to squeeze the trigger.

CATWALK

Randolph reaches the catwalk as the orchestra plays a

dramatic series of smashing notes. He tackles Buggy just

as he squeezes off the SHOT.

RINK

The top of Smoochy's foam rubber head is blown off. In

SLOW MOTION, Smoochy's tattered horn sails through the

air and lands softly on the ice.

WIDE

Everyone in the arena screams and heads for the exits.

It's pandemonium. Thanks to Randolph, Buggy's shot was

too high and just missed Sheldon's skull.

CONTINUED:

A confused Sheldon bends over to pick up a chunk of the

Smoochy head.

Nora, who's entered at the opposite end of the rink,

tries to reach him, but it's impossible. Panicked

audience members run across the rink, heading for the

exits. It's chaos. People slip, Rhinettes get trampled.

CATWALK

Randolph tries to get the rifle away from Buggy. They

struggle on a narrow beam high above the rink. The cops

have reached the outer edge of the catwalk now. Tommy

and the boys get there a second later. They all stand

back -- the catwalk is too unstable.

Buggy manages to shove Randolph off him. He raises the

RIFLE and SHOOTS at the cops. Randolph grabs him. Both

he and Buggy lose their footing and slip from the

catwalk. Randolph is able to grab onto the edge and hold

on. Buggy clutches Randolph's leg which threatens to

bring them both down. They dangle 80 feet above the

rink. Randolph desperately tries to hold onto the

catwalk as Buggy clings to Randolph's ankle.

CLOSE ON RANDOLPH'S FINGERS

His knuckles turn white as his fingers start to slip from

the beam.

ANGLE ON BUGGY

Still clutching Randolph's ankle, he starts to lose his

grip. He desperately grabs Randolph's foot, but

Randolph's shoe slips off and Buggy begins his long

plunge to the next life.

INT. RINK - HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT

Buggy screams the whole way down, still holding onto

Randolph's shoe.

RINK

Buggy crashes into the middle of the rink, cob-webbing

the ice around him.

CATWALK

Tommy and his boys runs off to find Sheldon. The COPS

help Randolph off the catwalk. He's a nervous wreck.

They pat the dazed Randolph on the back.   He passes out.

RINK

People continue to run through the rink. Felled

Rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls. Smoke fills

the air. Sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet

as Nora finally reaches him. She embraces him.

Sheldon looks toward the network box. Beyond it, through

the smoke, he sees Burke shoving his way through people

who jam the exit trying to escape. Sheldon reaches into

his costume and pulls out his gun.

Sheldon runs off leaving Nora.

EXIT

Burke is almost through the cluster of people. He

glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading

toward him. He shoves even harder now and finally

gets through.

EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Burke makes a run for it down 33rd Street. A moment

later, Sheldon emerges from the building. He sees Burke

in the distance and takes off after him. He's still in

his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy

head.

FURTHER DOWN STREET

Burke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a

disfigured Smoochy chasing after him. He quickly rounds

the corner.

EXT. STREET

A few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner. He looks

down the street and sees no sign of Burke. He notices an

alley by an abandoned building.

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn.

Suddenly, Burke jumps out from behind some boxes. He

whacks Sheldon's head with a garbage can lid. The gun

goes flying. Burke goes for it, but Sheldon is quickly

on his feet and pounces on him. The two men fight it

out. Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts

to strangle him.

Just as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a

GUNSHOT. Burke looks up. Nora stands there, pointing

Sheldon's gun directly at him.

Burke just looks at her.

Burke smirks as he releases Sheldon. Sheldon jumps up

and takes the gun from Nora. He shakily points it at

Burke.

Burke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit.

CONTINUED:

He laughs.

Sheldon cocks the gun.

Sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and

steps out of it.

Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head.

Burke suddenly looks fearful, as does Nora.

Sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the

courage to pull the trigger.

Suddenly, there's a voice from behind.

Sheldon turns around.       It's Tommy and her boys.

CONTINUED:

Tommy walks closer to Sheldon.

Tommy extends her hand for the gun. Sheldon looks down

at the gun. He can't believe he's even holding it. He

hands it to Tommy.

Tommy pats Sheldon's shoulder affectionately.

Sheldon looks over at Burke, who's petrified.

Sheldon and Nora take a final look at Burke before

walking out of the alley. Burke is wide-eyed with fear

as Tommy's boys advance on him. Just as they round the

corner there is the sound of TWO GUNSHOTS. Sheldon looks

at Nora.

She pats him on the back.

EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Stokes finally makes it out of the arena. He runs toward

his waiting limo and hops in the back seat. He barks to

his driver through the glass partition.

The car doesn't move.   Stokes pounds on the partition.

No response. Stokes frantically pushes the button that

lowers the partition. It slides down.

The driver turns around. Stokes recoils in horror. It's

Takashi. He smiles as the back doors open and the

Japanese thugs -- Chick, Sambo and Tobi -- pile in with

Stokes. They slam the doors shut.

Stokes lets out a small whimper. Chick nods to Takashi

who steps on the gas as he sings "Anything Goes" in

Japanese.

EXT. TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The car heads into the night, passing Sheldon and Nora,

who have exited the alley. This will be Frank Stokes'

final limo ride.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon and Nora pause on the street.    Sheldon looks

around him.

He looks at Nora.

CONTINUED:

Sheldon gazes back at her.

They kiss passionately as MUSIC SWELLS and the CAMERA

CRANES HIGH ABOVE the rink.

FADE UP ON:

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ONE YEAR LATER

SUPERIMPOSE:    ONE YEAR LATER

The Garden is sold out.    The lights go down.    Through the

P.A. we hear...

There's a dramatic pause; TYMPANY ROLL.

Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause.

Randolph skates out, somewhat shakily, to huge applause.

Sheldon puts his arm around him. The audience is now on

their feet. Randolph especially basks in the adulation.

CONTINUED:

Sheldon pats Randolph on the back. MUSIC BEGINS as

Rhinettes and Krinkle Kids skate out. The show starts

and the audience goes wild. Nora smiles from the stands

as Smoochy and the others glide across the ice. (SMOOCHY

/RANDOLPH DUET TO COME.)
