Over BLACK, we hear the first few bars of Jingle Bells. The

music morphs into an OMINOUS SCORE.

With a thunderous BOOM, comes a TITLE CARD reading "HANUKKAH

PAST."

EXT. PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

We start on JESUS ON A CRUCIFIX, and then violently CRANE

down to reveal MORDECHAI (10), a timid little Hasidic boy

standing nervously at the foot of the statue.

Behind Morty is a wall with the graffiti phrase "HANUKKAH IS

4 HOMOS" scrawled across it. He clutches his Sandy Koufax

lunchbox tightly as he looks off into the distance. He's got

quite a large bulge in his pants for a child his age.

We see a menacing, EXTREMELY WIDE ANGLE shot of the school.

Superimposed over the picture are the words, "ST. PETER,

PAUL, AND MARY PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL."

Mordechai takes a deep breath, and walks towards the school.

EXT. SCHOOLYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Mordechai walks past a row of bleachers occupied by FOUR

GENTILE CHILDREN.

He drops a penny. The other children cackle.

The Gentile Girl next to him holds up a bag of bagels.

Gentile Boy 1 feigns choking.

More laughter. Morty attempts to take it all in stride. We

PUSH into GENTILE GIRL 2, a severe looking puritanically

dressed child as she turns to face the camera.

Dead silence. The other children exchange "Now that went a

little over the line" looks.

The silence is broken by the sound of the SCHOOLBELL. Morty

gathers himself, and walks off.

INT. CLASSROOM - LATER

As Morty holds a small gift wrapped box in his hands we hear

a tinny version of the song Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel.

He tears open the wrapping paper to reveal a DREIDEL. He

looks at his gift, and then looks off-screen. We PAN with his

look to reveal...

A group of Christian children congregating around a large,

garishly decorated Christmas tree. A very Vegas Merry

Christmas sign flashes as a larger-than-life HI-FI version of

the Christmas song Jingle Bells blares. The children

festively slap high fives as they open their presents.

We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Boy 1 enamored with his

brand new ATC motorbike.

We cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Girl 1. She wears an "I

Love Jesus" T-shirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow

affixed to its head in her arms. It licks her on the face.

We cut back to Mordechai. He looks down at his pathetic

excuse for a present. He's on the verge of tears.

Gentile Boy 1 calls to Mordechai as he drives his ATC.

The other children take notice of Mordechai's gift and begin

to laugh.

Mordechai is crushed. MRS. HIGHSMITH (40's), an incredibly

Waspy teacher puts down her copy of 'Modern W.A.S.P.,' and

appears genuinely concerned by the teasing Mordechai has

weathered. She walks over to comfort him.

She looks to Mordechai for confirmation on the word.

In unison, the class attempts to repeat the words, but all

suffer various degrees of pronunciation problems.

She squeezes his cheek.

A reaction shot of the mortified Morty.

EXT. GHETTO STREET - NIGHT

A sullen Mordechai wanders the streets. Absurd XMAS

DECORATIONS, horrific in their appearance blanket the street.

Morty glances a GROTESQUE FAUX REINDEER with fangs. We hear a

growling noise as it lights up. He walks quickly away in fear

past...

A STOREFRONT

We track with Morty as he passes a storefront window. Inside,

the CLERK turns a sign outwards reading, "JEWS NOT WELCOME."

We continue with Morty as he passes by a second storefront. A

similar sign reading, "KYKES GO HOME" is turned outwards by

ANOTHER CLERK. He continues past yet another building as a

sign reading, "MONOTHEISTS NEED NOT APPLY" is displayed by a

THIRD CLERK for Morty's benefit.

Morty looks across the street.

A sign hangs from a storefront reading "JEWS OK FOR ABOUT 5

MINUTES." The FOURTH CLERK gives him the thumbs up.

Morty finds a spot on the sidewalk outside the building and

pulls out his dreidel.

He spins it, and we hold on the spinning top for a few beats

as Morty stares at in wonderment.

Suddenly, a huge black boot comes crashing down into frame

and smashes the little dreidel. Mordechai slowly looks up.

A menacing SANTA CLAUS gives him the finger, and exits frame

as we hear him sadistically laugh O.S. the words "Ho, ho, ho"

at Morty.

We start CLOSE on Mordechai. Rage fills every inch of his

face. As we SLOWLY CRANE AWAY, the opening CREDITS begin as

the HEBREW HAMMER THEME SONG kicks into full gear.

TITLE SEQUENCE

As the Jewxploitation music pumps, metallic slashes rip

through the screen line by line, spinning into place to form

a Star Of David. The title, "The Hebrew Hammer" SLAMS into

frame.

TITLE CARD: HANUKKAH PRESENT

EXT. THE CHOOD - DAY

We start CLOSE on a gift wrapped Hanukkah present. We pull

back a bit as MORDECHAI JEFFERSON CARVER (29), AKA THE HEBREW

HAMMER, a baaad Jewish brother spins the package in his hands

as he saunters down the street past a latke stand. He's a

Semitic super stud straight out of a 70's Blaxploitation

flick. He tosses the gift to MACCABEE, a young Hasidic boy.

Macabee tears open the wrapping paper and holds up the gift -

a Hebrew Hammer action figure. He beams.

We cut back to the Hammer as he smiles back. From O.C., we

hear Maccabee say...

The Hammer smiles back and walks off frame.

ANOTHER PART OF THE CHOOD

We begin on the Hammer's black boots and slowly TILT up as we

DOLLY back with him.

The Hammer passes a line of THREE JEWISH PRINCESSES who swoon

as he passes.

He stops below the sign of a butcher shop that reads, "100%

KOSHER MEAT." We PUSH into his CLOSE UP as he blows them all

a kiss.

The pubic area of their dresses moisten in synchrony.

The Hammer winks back.

An OLD WOMAN calls to the Hammer from the window of a second

story flat.

We punch in to a CLOSE UP of a demure Miriam as the Hammer

takes stock of the goods. She is an atrociously ugly girl

wearing orthodontic headgear, and bespectacled with a pair

oversized librarian's glasses.

The Hammer shakes off his wave of nausea.

The Hammer continues on down the street. The old woman and

Miriam are framed in the BG.

The Hammer stops for a second and smiles at the compliment.

EXT. GHETTO ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

Some TEENAGE GENTILE BOYS play keep away with a yarmulke

belonging to SHLOMO, another young Hasidic kid.

TEDDY (the non-speaking teen Gentile) throws the yarmulke,

and we FOLLOW it as it spins towards another TEENAGE GENTILE.

The other Teenage Gentile excitedly extends his hands to

catch, but right before it reaches him another hand comes

into frame and snatches it. He looks up, and we cut to his...

POV as we tilt up to reveal The Hammer. He looks pretty damn

big and pissed off from this angle.

The Teenage Gentile  begins to shake and stammer.

The two run off.

The Hammer looks down to Shlomo. His spirit seems broken.

The kid's morale is boosted.

The Hammer pounds his fist into his chest ala the Black

Panthers. The kid returns the gesture.

The Hammer points at him as he leaves.

EXT. 'HEBREW HAMMER INVESTIGATIONS' OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

The Hammer walks up the stairs and past the sign advertising

his office.

The Hammer theme music winds down, punctuated with Shaft-like

brass hits. However, the brass hits become incredibly

overblown and extraneous.

The Hammer walks back into frame from the stairway to his

office. He looks around strangely for the source of the

music.

INT. 'HEBREW HAMMER INVESTIGATIONS' OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS

LATER

TIKKVA (Late 30's), the Hammer's very nasaly Laawng Island

secretary, files her nails furiously as the Hammer enters the

office. A MUZAK version of the Hammer Theme song plays over

the office PA system.

The Hammer tosses his Shtreml and we WHIP with it as lands

squarely on the hat rack.

We cut back to the Hammer. He's wearing a yarmulke.

The Hammer lets this sink in.

The Hammer walks into his private office and shuts the

frosted glass door. We hold on what's stenciled on the

outside of the door. The lettering reads, "Mordechai

Jefferson Carver - Certified Circumcised Dick - State of New

York."

EXT. NORTH POLE - DAY

An establishing shot of Santa's Workshop. The lettering

"NORTH POLE - SANTA'S WORKSHOP" is superimposed over the

picture.

INT. SANTA'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

As Santa speaks, we begin on a painting of a meek and

frightened looking Santa Claus. His eyes look fearfully to

his right.  Below the picture frame is a plaque reading "St.

Nick the Nervous. 1871-1941", we continue a slow DOLLY to the

right on to the next picture.

We see another Santa Claus, much more treacherous in his

appearance. His eyes are fixed menacingly on the picture of

Santa to his left. The plaque below his picture read, "St.

Nick The Nasty 1941-1970."

We continue our DOLLY to the right, finally ending on a

painting of a jolly, portly Santa. Below his picture the

plaque reads, "St. Nick The Nice. 1970-Christmas Present."

We cut to a WIDE shot of a Conference Room. The same nice

Santa Claus from the last picture addresses a handful of

ELVES. Two reindeer flank Santa on either side. Their

nameplates hang from their necks - "BLITZEN" and "RUDOLPH."

At the other end of the table from Santa sits his son DAMIAN,

quite a nasty looking man.

Damian whispers to an elf on his right hand side, and then

makes the JERKING OFF motion with his hand.

As Rudolph's nose dims, so do the lights in the room. Santa

picks up a remote in his hand, and turns on a SLIDE

PROJECTOR.

We see a slide of THE HEBREW HAMMER, an African American man

(Mohammed), and Santa Claus arm in arm below a banner in a

mall reading "HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"

We see another slide in which an assembly of SCHOOLCHILDREN

are singing.

Damian, preoccupied with the cigarette he's attempting to

light, looks up in response to his name.

A brown bagged bottle of booze now sits on the table in front

of him. We can see Santa and the reindeer in silhouette on

the slide projection screen behind him.

Santa addresses Damian.

We being a SLOW PUSH into Damian as he ponders the question.

The cigarette dangles from his lips.

Rudolph nods to Blitzen. Blitzen returns the gesture with a

nod of acknowledgment.

With a slow and measured pace Damian says...

On the slide projector screen behind Damian, we see the

silhouetted images of Blitzen and Rudolph goring Santa

through the chest with their antlers. Damian cringes.

Blood trickles from Santa's mouth, and with his last breath

he utters the words...

Santa falls out of frame with a thud. Standing behind him

with bloodied antlers is Blitzen.

Damian walks over to the newly deceased Santa, takes his

bloodstained Santa's hat, and put it on his own head. From

this point on in the screenplay, Damian will now be referred

to as SANTA.

The elves in the room, in various stages of shock, stare at

their new master in horror.

EXT. THE JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - DAY

A building resembling the Pentagon with the exception that

it's shaped like the Star Of David. Superimposed over the

picture are the words, "JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE."

INT. THE JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - DAY

A smoky chamber reminiscent of the Senate or the United

Nations. A GIANT BANNER reading "HANUKKAH NOW!," illustrated

with a Hasid in silhouette with his fist raised, covers the

back wall behind the men.

As with the Senate House Committee, various factions of the

JDL sit behind plaques describing the group they represent.

We see members from: The Anti-Defamation League, Jews Against

Drunk Driving, etc. A chair belonging to THE COALITION OF

JEWISH ATHLETES is empty.

The floor is chaotic. The JDL Chief bangs his gavel and

yells...

His pleas for silence are ignored.

Still chaos. He flips a light switch on and off a few times

as he says...

The entire hall responds in unison...

The room falls silent. Every member of the JDL sits straight

up with their hands folded in front of them.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN sits before a plaque reading, "HARVEY

WEINSTEIN - CHAIRMAN WORLDWIDE JEWISH MEDIA CONSPIRACY"

The CHAIRMAN OF THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE pipes in.

The plaque reading "Anti-Defamation League" is clearly framed

in this shot.

One of the JDL MEMBERS calls out.

A SECOND MEMBER calls out.

We stay on the chief while we hear offscreen...

At the back of the room, ESTHER (25), a Semitic siren, pushes

her way to the front. A black skirt covers every inch of her

sexy figure.

The hall fills with hushed voices as the various members of

the JDL whisper to one another.

The COUNCIL ELDER, a sage looking elderly Jewish man

interrupts. The plaque in front of him reads, "SAGE ELDERLY

JEWISH LEADER."

The Chief nods his head reluctantly.

Esther lifts her skirt a few inches.

INT. HEBREW HAMMER INVESTIGATIONS - PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

A shoddy low-rent office replete with Film Noirish lighting

via the blinds. The Hammer fiddles with a dreidel as he sits

with his feet propped up on his desk. His Shtreml hat is

skewed to one side and a toothpick dangles from his lips.

There is knock at the door.

The door opens to reveal a long denim skirt covering every

possible inch of flesh. We tilt up the length of the skirt to

reveal Esther. She is breathtakingly sexy.

The Hammer quickly removes his feet from the table. Esther

approaches his desk and sits.

The Hammer attempts to press stop on his tape recorder, but

accidentally FAST FORWARDS to another part of the tape. We

hear the sound of SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. The Hammer scrambles

for the STOP button.

The Hammer makes the realization.

The Hammer stops himself and glances over Esther's shoulder.

In the doorway stands a BLONDE BOMBSHELL in a mink coat.

The Blonde Bombshell is confused for a moment.

She leaves.

Esther looks down at his desk.

We cut to a shot of the Hammer's In/Out Box. Both are

completely empty, and thickly coated with spiderwebs.

The Hammer takes notice of her expression of skepticism.

Still a look of disbelief.

The Hammer grabs his overcoat from the coat rack. Esther gets

up as well.

It's obvious the Hammer's amused by her persistence.

The two walk towards the front door of the office.

The Hammer looks directly into the camera and shakes his head

proudly.

EXT. MRS. CARVER'S HOUSE - SHABAT

We start on the outside of the front door as we hear the Ding

of the doorbell. MRS. CARVER, the epitome of Jewish

motherhood opens the door.

For all the Gentiles reading, I thought I might digress for

just a moment. JEWISH MOTHER (adj.) A complicated and

charismatic package of the following qualities rolled into

human female form: intense, judgmental, overbearing,

manipulative, lacking boundaries, yet fiercely involved,

loving, and protective of her children. Got it?

The Hammer pulls a bottle of wine out from a paper bag.

Mrs. Carver forcefully grabs Esther into an embrace

resembling a bear hug, and begins to plaster her with sloppy

kisses. Esther is visibly overwhelmed by it all as the

kissing and embracing continue for a bit too long.

Mrs. Carver places her tongue into Esther's ear canal as a

sign of affection, forcing Esther to break the embrace. Mrs.

Carver and Esther look at one another strangely for an

awkward few moments.

TITLE CARD: 4 HOURS LATER

INT. MRS. CARVER'S DINING ROOM - 4 HOURS LATER

The Hammer and Esther grasp their stomachs which protrude

from underneath their slightly unbuttoned shirts. Plates of

half-eaten food are everywhere. On the table, on the dining

room furniture behind them, etc.

Mrs. Carver enters the dining room through the kitchen door

carrying an enormous platter loaded with serving dish after

serving dish of food.

Esther and the Hammer exchange looks.

Mrs. Carver places the food on a dresser opposite the kitchen

table and then sits.

We cut to a previously unseen end of the table. MUN CHI, a

skin and bones elderly Chinese man looks up in response to

his name. The plate directly in front of him is still

pristine. He mutters something in Chinese and then reaches

for a chicken wing on a platter in the middle of the table.

Mrs. Carver smacks his hands away with a wooden salad spoon

and then glares at him.

Mrs. Carver directs her piercing stare at the Hammer.

Esther coughs up some of her food. The Hammer interjects.

The Hammer cuts her off.

He stands and leaves.

Mrs. Carver stares lovingly at Esther.

Esther begins to choke again.

The Hammer calls out from the bathroom.

Esther appears panicked.

In the BG, we hear the toilet FLUSH. The Hammer begins his

walk back to the table.

The Hammer sits down.

Esther begins to speak, but Mrs. Carver interrupts.

Esther plays along.

Mrs. Carver turns her attention towards her son.

This puts the Hammer into a neurotic fit.

Mrs. Carver throws her arms up in resignation.

Mrs. Carver looks at Esther and winks.

The Hammer shakes his head in frustration.

Mrs. Carver becomes very animated.

MAZEL TOV, a tabby with two paralyzed back legs wearing a

diaper slides itself across the floor. With each writhing

motion we hear a very distinct SWISHING NOISE.

Mrs. Carver picks the cat up and places it in her lap. Mazel

Tov makes a strange, UNHAPPY NOISE.

Mrs. Carver pulls off Mazel Tov's diaper while it still sits

in her lap. She plays with undiapered cat's two good paws.

The cat purrs back at her. She takes the cat from her lap and

places it on the floor.

BROWN STREAKS cover her white blouse.

EXT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - SUNDAY

"JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - SUNDAY - 0800 Hrs - Year 5734" is

typed out sequentially over the image of the building.

EXT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE FRONT GATE - CONTINUOUS

The exterior resembles any walled private residence with a

front gate. The Hammer stands in front of the large, metallic

Star Of David vault-like gate and pushes the button next to

it. A COMPUTERIZED VOICE begins...

He's clearly irritated by this.

The vault-like gate slides open in a futuristic manner, and

the Hammer steps in. The gate shuts behind him, and he finds

himself in an all white room. A microphone is placed by

another massive door directly in front of him.

The second door slides open, and Morty steps forward into the

next room. Inside this room lies a single violin in a case.

The Hammer picks up the violin and begins to play 'Hava

Nagila.' He's pretty damn good at it. The next door slides

open, and Hammer steps forward into yet another room.

A drape, about four feet high off the floor, is stretched

into a semi-circle against the wall of the room.

The Hammer steps inside the drape, and drops his pants.

A panel on the wall opens, and a metal probe heads for his

shmekel. He is clearly uncomfortable with this bit of

testing.

The door slides open, and the Hammer quickly pulls his pants

up as he steps into the next room. The room is completely

empty with the exception of a one way mirror on the front

wall by the door.

Nothing happens. The Hammer waits a few seconds, but quickly

becomes agitated.

We cut to the OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR. The Chief observes

the Hammer as he continues to whine. Next to them, a METER

with the label "WHINING SCALE" slowly grows in magnitude as

the Hammer continues to rant. The meter bars go from red to

yellow in color.

The meter bars switch from yellow to green, finally passing

the '0  - Jewish' mark.

Back inside with the Hammer, the doors slide open, revealing

the Chief to the Hammer.

INT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The Hammer and the Chief make their way down the hallway.

The Chief stops at a door labeled "Goldsmith's Gym." The sign

is illustrated with a picture of a Hasidic Jew squatting a

dumbbell a la Gold's Gym. The Chief opens the door.

INT. KARATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Inside, about FIVE or so HASIDS decked out in white Karate

gi's stand facing the door. By the front door, A GROUP

LEADER, notices the Hammer, and walks towards the door. He

bows with his hands folded in front of him as a sign of

respect.

The Hammer returns the gesture.

The Group Leader shakes his head in one last respect, and

then turns away from the Hammer as he goes back to his class.

On the back of his gi is written the word "JEW-DO."

The two leave, and continue their walk down the hallway. An

agent with his back to camera fiddles with some HIGH-TECH

gadgetry that lines the walls.

The Chief stops behind the man and taps him on the back.

SAMMY DAVIS JR. JR., the spitting image of Sammy, turns to

greet the two.

The Hammer is a bit taken back.

Sammy's all smiles.

INT. THE CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

Your standard 70's TV police Chief's office. The Hammer

enters and the Chief shuts the door behind him.

The Hammer heads for the door.

The Hammer walks out the door. The Chief calls to him.

A beat passes, and then the Hammer walks back in.

A reaction shot of the befuddled Chief.

EXT. GHETTO STREETS - DAY

We see various shots of the Hammer's Caddy. The grill, the

white wall tires, the fuzzy dreidel hanging from the rear

view mirror, etc. Very 'Superfly.'

EXT. KWANZAA LIBERATION FRONT - DAY

We start on an incredibly impressive looking building. Over

this we see the words "KWANZAA LIBERATION FRONT" typed out

sequentially. The camera than tilts down to reveal a Popeye's

Chicken.

A BLACK TEENAGER scouts the street with a pair of binoculars.

BINOCULAR POV - Instead of the usual two circles, we see the

world through two cutouts of the African continent. The

Hammer's Caddy pulls up.

The teen runs inside.

The Hammer's Caddy pulls up to a stop right at camera, giving

us a full view of the license plate. It reads, "LCHAIM."

INT. KWANZAA LIBERATION FRONT HQ - MOMENTS LATER

A handful of BAAAD BROTHERS, decked out in a mixture of

African clothing and combat gear relax to the sounds of

mellow Blaxploitation music. 'KWANZAA NOW!' posters and other

Pro-Kwanzaa propaganda hang on the walls of the room, machine

guns rest idly against sofas,  blunts are passed around.

We're talking Black Panthers here. A WHITE ACCOUNTANT counts

money at a card table to the side of the room.

The black teenager enters breathlessly.

O.S., one of the BAAAD BROTHERS inquires.

The men scramble for their guns, inserting clips, and

removing safeties.

The front doors bust open, and we DOLLY into the Hammer.

All guns are trained on him.

From behind the frontline of gunmen, MOHAMMED, clearly the

leader of the operation, pushes his way through.

He walks towards the Hammer. You can feel the tension in the

room.

The two embrace in a warm hug. The White Accountant looks up

in shock from the card table. His nametag is clearly visible,

and it reads, "WHITE ACCOUNTANT." He points at Mohammed.

He points to the Hammer.

The Hammer and Mohammed look to one another. They're having a

hard time understanding his concern.

The White Accountant thinks it over for a second.

The other Brothers put their guns down and go back to their

pre-Hammer activities, and the accountant takes his place

back at the card table.

Mohammed puts his arm around the Hammer.

The Hammer looks over at the Brothers smoking weed, making

out with their girlfriends, etc. Mohammed takes notice.

This clearly flies over the Hammer's yarmulke.

ANOTHER ROOM

Mohammed escorts the Hammer through a love beaded doorway

into a back room. Inside, JAMAL, a black elf, sits on a sofa.

A blunt hangs from his mouth and his arms are wrapped around

two GORGEOUS SISTERS.

Jamal pulls his shades down slightly to get a better look.

Jamal makes the sideways gun holding gesture, and mock pulls

the trigger.

Jamal thinks for a second.

Jamal pulls out a matchbbok from his pocket. The front cover

reads, "DUKE'S - WHERE SKIN IS IN." He hands it to the

Hammer.

Mohammed and the Hammer head towards the door.

Mohammed pounds his fist against his chest and then raises

it. The Hammer returns the gesture.

EXT. CITY STREET - AFTERNOON

The Hammer's Caddy drives past a sneaky looking SALVATION

NAVY GUY. We do your standard BLAXPLOITATION ZOOM into him as

he begins to speak into the lapel of his uniform.

INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Santa holds a walkie-talkie in hand and we the hear the voice

of the Salvation Navy Guy. Although behind him hangs a banner

reading, "SANTA'S WORKSHOP," the interior is a run down

sweatshop.

Santa puts the walkie-talkie down, and addresses somebody

O.S.

We cut to the other side to reveal whom he's speaking to.

Jamal, the same black 'elf' from the Kwanzaa Liberation Front

sits at the table across from Santa.

Santa looks over to TINY TIM. Unshaven, not so tiny anymore,

and still on crutches, Tiny Tim's grown up since 'A Christmas

Carol.' A common street thug. C'mon, did you seriously think

that Scrooge would give free handouts to the Cratchit family

forever?

Tiny Tim shrugs his shoulders.

A shot of a couple of the same elves from the conference room

slaving away on the assembly line.

The ELVES appear to be struggling with the speed at which the

products move down the assembly line. The HEAD ELF steps out

from the assembly line and addresses Santa.

The other elves stop working and vocalize their agreement

with the Head Elf.

The other elves shout out their approval. Santa takes it all

in stride.

The Head Elf is taken aback by what seems to be a glimpse of

compassion on Santa's part.

Santa performs the two fingered whistle.

A group of FIVE TAIWANESE BOYS file past Santa towards the

assembly line.

As each child passes Santa, he hands them each a bag of

PEANUTS.

At the assembly line, the Taiwanese boys move like lightning

as they gift wrap boxes clearly labeled "NIKEY," "KATHY LEE

CLOTHING COMPANY," and "STARSTRUCKS COFFEE."

The elves, including Jamal, watch in amazement at their

agility and efficiency.

Defeated, they shuffle out of the workshop.

Santa walks over to a FED-Y truck overflowing with large

brown cardboard boxes marked 'PRODUCT.'

Tiny Tim's curiosity is peaked.

Santa slits open one of the boxes with a large knife and

pulls out a VIDEOCASSETTE generically labeled, "It's A

Wonderful Life."

EXT. DUKE'S BAR - DAY

HARD CORE PUNK music pours out from the inside of the bar.

The Hammer walks into frame and looks up at the sign. He

curiously notes the ASTRO TURF spread across the pavement,

and then makes his way for the front door.

INT. DUKE'S BAR - AFTERNOON

We DOLLY into the Hammer as he pushes open the WESTERN STYLE

doors.

The MUSIC comes to a SCREECHING STOP. We HOLD ON HIS CU as he

looks around.

We cut to the other side to get a look at what he sees - A

bar of about TEN SKINHEADS staring back at him dumbfounded.

Skinhead paraphernalia adorns the walls.

The Hammer maintains his cool, takes a deep breath, and then

walks towards the bar.

We cut to a FLOOR LEVEL shot as his STAR OF DAVID SPURS

jangle as he continues his walk to the bar.

He steps up to the counter, where a SKINHEAD BARTENDER with a

Manson-like swastika inked on his forehead studies him

curiously.

The bartender reaches for a bottle of cherry flavored

Manischewitz wine. The Hammer interrupts him by clearing his

throat.

The Bartender eyeballs him, and then grabs the bottle of

Black Label Manischewitz. He grabs a glass from the rack, and

begins to pour.

The bartender stops pouring and places the bottle on the bar.

He drops a fistful of Shekels on the bar.

A FEW SKINHEADS slowly begin to approach the bar.

The Hammer picks up the bottle and begins to examine it.

With one swift motion, the Hammer spins the bottle up to grab

it by the neck, and thwacks the bartender on the head with

it.

All of the OTHER OCCUPANTS in the bar jump out of their

seats, encircling the Hammer.

We do a QUICK PUSH into the Hammer as he pulls out TWO SAWED

OFF SHOTGUNS from underneath his coat.

He points his weapons, and we...

EXT. DUKE'S BAR - CONTINUOUS

A WIDE SHOT of the bar. The camera is STATIONARY. We hear the

sound of SHOTGUNS BLASTING and then the sounds of intense

FIGHTING. A few seconds of the fighting sounds pass.

Suddenly, the front doors bust open and a few bloodied

Skinheads fall out onto the ground, followed by the Hammer.

He's untouched, and he carries the bottle of Manischewitz in

one hand and a shotgun in the other.

He stops in the MIDGROUND, and pours the Manischewitz out on

the astroturf lawn in a methodical manner.

He approaches FOREGROUND, and pulls out something from his

jacket pocket.

We see a CU of the same matchbook the elf gave him. "DUKE'S -

WHERE SKIN IS IN."

He lights a match and tosses it over his shoulder. We hear

the sounds of bursting flames.

The Hammer puts his sunglasses on, and walks straight past

the camera.

We pull back into a SPINNING OVERHEAD to reveal flames in the

shape of the STAR OF DAVID burning on the lawn.

PUSHERMAN MONTAGE

Curtis Mayfield's 'Pusherman' FADES UP, and we cut into a

STILL PHOTO of Tiny Tim with his arms around two Hasidic boys

in an a alley. The SCREEN DIVIDES INTO THIRDS as we see CU's

of each character smiling. Stills are constantly replaced in

time with the music. We see a still of MONEY BEING EXCHANGED,

then HANDS BEING SHAKEN. Then a still of a VIDEOCASSETTE

BEING PLACED INTO A VCR, A HASIDIC KID WATCHING THE TV, etc.

The music continues as we...

INT. JEWISH HOME - DAY

Maccabee, the same kid the Hammer gave the Hanukkah present

to earlier in the film, sits glued to his television set.

O.S. from the television we hear someone approximating Zuzu

from the film 'It's A Wonderful Life' say...

A JEWISH MOTHER calls to her son from O.S.

Maccabee looks over his shoulder in disgust, and then CRANKS

UP THE VOLUME on the film until all other sounds are drowned

out.

PUSHERMAN MONTAGE

More STILLS depicting the sale and distribution of the

videocassettes.

INT. ANOTHER JEWISH HOME - NIGHT

A second ADDICT JEWISH CHILD is glued to his TV set. Drool

slowly makes its way down his chin. He gets up, and we FOLLOW

him into the living room where we find his PARENTS. His

father reads a newspaper, while his mother is absorbed in her

knitting.

His parents look to one another in absolute shock.

MORE PUSHERMAN MONTAGE

More STILLS...

INT. YET ANOTHER JEWISH HOME - DAY

An ADOLESCENT HASIDIC BOY backs his way through the front

door into the kitchen. He's carrying an incredibly large

CHRISTMAS TREE.

We cut to a shot of HIS FAMILY, who watch this all go down as

they sit at the kitchen table.

The Adolescent Hasid finally gets the tree into the house,

and turns to see the rest of his family staring at him,

mouths agape.

The family remains expressionless.

The glass in his mother's hand, slips from her grasp and

shatters on the kitchen floor.

EXT. JEWISH GHETTO STREET - DAY

The Hammer's Caddy cruises slowly down the street.

INT. HAMMER'S CADDY - CONTINUOUS

Things definitely seem odd. The Hammer looks out his left

window. TWO Hasidic CHILDREN decorate a giant Christmas tree

on the street.

He looks to his right. A GROUP of HASIDIC kids sing Christmas

Carols.

The Hammer looks through his front windshield. A kid is

standing right in the middle of the road!

The Hammer slams on his breaks, skidding to a stop just

inches from the kid. It's Shlomo (remember the kid the Hammer

helped with the Yarmulke earlier?), and he has a strange

glazed look in his eyes. Shlomo holds a videocassette in his

hand.

The Hammer steps out of the Caddy, leaving his car door open.

We hear the annoying beep, beep, beep door ajar sound.

The car door beeps again. The kid looks to it, and the Hammer

follows his gaze.

The Hammer is baffled. He looks down at Shlomo's hand and

spots the videocassette. He grabs it from him and examines at

it.

The Hammer inspects the tape a little longer, and then gives

the label a huge lick.

A POV shot from inside the Hammer's trunk as it opens. Hammer

stands with Shlomo.

Inside the trunk we see a box of videos. The three on top

read, "Fiddler On The Roof," "Yentl," and "Chaim Potok's The

Chosen." The Hammer grabs a copy of the Chosen and hands it

to Shlomo.

A HASIDIC KID ON A BIKE with a Christmas tree in tow rides

past the two. One of the ornaments makes a tinkling sound.

The Hammer slaps him out of his spell.

EXT. JEWISH GHETTO STREET - MOMENTS LATER

The Hammer dials a number on the payphone. As he dials, he

verbalizes the number he's calling.

The Hammer struggles with the last number, but then quickly

remembers.

It rings once, and then we hear the other line pick up.

INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The Chief's on the other end.

INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

We cut back to the Hammer on the payphone. He holds the

receiver away from his ear. He doesn't want to hear this.

He hangs up and leaves.

INT. MALL OF AMERICA - DAY

'Merry Christmas' decorations and signage dominate the

landscape of the establishing shot of the Mall.

Tiny Tim, walkie-talkie in hand, surveys this Christmas

Wonderland with smug satisfaction. He spots a small, barely

visible Hanukkah decoration poking out from beneath one of

the other Christmas decorations.

He rips it from the wall and tosses it into a small trashcan

bonfire.

Tiny Tim speaks into his the walkie-talkie.

ANOTHER PART OF THE MALL

Two adult sized Santa's Helpers, TONY AND MIKEY stand with

walkie-talkies behind the nightclub velvet ropes, and hold

back the throngs (15-20 extras) of screaming children

attempting to make their way past the red curtain to see

Santa. A huge 'Citizen Kane'/Big Brother style poster with a

menacing picture of Santa looms behind them. It reads, "SANTA

CLAUS: HE KNOWS IF YOU'VE BEEN NAUGHTY OR NICE."

Santa's staging area is very Studio 54. Both Tony and Mikey

are decked out in Addidas warm up pants, gold chains, etc.

Tony, very Guido in his mannerisms, replies into his

walkie...

A little BLONDE GENTILE GIRL tugs on Tony's sleeve.

The Gentile Girl pulls her Power Muff Girls T-shirt down,

allowing the two to get a better look at it.

She twirls for the two.

A pushy, FRECKLE FACED GENTILE BOY steps out of line and

approaches the two.

The kid begins to sob uncontrollably.

Tony apes him.

The kid is a pathetic mess.

The Hammer and Esther scope out the area. The Hammer is

disguised terribly, consisting of a baseball hat on top of

his Shtreml, and a Jesus Fish T-shirt worn over his black

suit. Esther's visibly nervous.

The two pass a samples booth. The FREE SAMPLES WOMAN solicits

the Hammer.

We get a CU of the burger followed by a CU of the Hammer.

He's mortified, but he pulls it together.

The Sample Woman looks at him strangely as the Hammer and

Esther walk on.

The two take their place at the end of the line in to see

Santa.

Tony performs the two fingered whistle.

The kids all vocalize their disappointment.

The kids aren't buying it. More boos and protests of

disapproval.

Tony spits and grabs his crotch as he turns back around to

take his place in front of the velvet ropes.

Esther surveys their place in line. It's about fifteen deep.

The two make their way up to the front of the line. They pass

a man who looks eerily like ex-rapping god, MC HAMMER.

Esther adjusts her bust. She's incredibly sexy in her tight

fitting denim jacket. She smiles flirtatiously at the Elves.

She puts her hand on Tony's bicep and smiles once again.

Tony is putty in her hands.

Tony unhinges the rope, and the two pass. The Hammer leans

over to Esther.

INSIDE THE CURTAIN

JIMMY, an adorable six year old sits on Santa's lap. Santa's

assistants, two busty blondes named BAMBI and TAWNI, flank

his chair.

Bambi and Tawni escort Jimmy out, and re-enter with Esther

and the Hammer. Santa's confused.

The Hammer rips off his baseball hat and T-shirt. Santa

gasps.

The Hammer takes out his gun and points it Santa.

Santa snaps his fingers, and Bambi and Tawni drape themselves

on either side of the Hammer, rubbing his arms erotically.

Bambi speaks with a thick Southern drawl.

Esther is clearly jealous.

The Hammer's enjoying the attention. He looks down at Bambi's

breasts. We're talking HUGE, obviously augmented boobolas. A

large crucifix chain hangs around her neck, nestled in

between the mounds of silicone. We hear the requisite DING as

it sparkles.

The Hammer is released from the sexual spell of the Gentile

Seductress.

The girls move away from the Hammer. Esther smiles at the

Hammer's resolve.

Suddenly, Tony draws the curtain back.

He sees the Hammer with his gun pointed at Santa's head.

Esther pulls out her piece and points it at Tony.

He does. The entire crowd of children can now see what's

happening. Hushed, fearful whispers. MC Hammer steps out of

line and pleads...

The Hammer does a double take. MC Hammer gives a "Did I just

say that?" expression.

Santa stands up slowly with his hands raised.

The Hammer plays along, raising his hand to keep the children

calm.

The Hammer and Esther look to one another. This riles the

masses. Trouble.

AN EMPTY SECTION OF THE MALL - MOMENTS LATER

We hold a few beats on a shot of this fairly untrafficked

portion of the mall.

Suddenly, Esther and the Hammer haul ass around the corner,

running for their lives.

A second or two pass, and an ANGRY MOB of about twenty

Gentile children round the corner after them. They're

definitely not in the Christmas spirit.

The Hammer and Esther take another turn. From the other

direction a SECOND MOB OF CHILDREN head straight at them.

The Hammer spots another corridor in front of them.

They run about a hundred yards before they hit a wall. A dead

end! O.S. we can hear the throng of children nearing in the

BG.

Hammer turns to Esther defeated.

The barely audible sound of a gospelized version of the

Biblical slave song, "Let My People Go" sounds as if it's

coming from within the walls of the mall.

The Hammer tries to place the source.

Suddenly, a panel on the wall slides open to reveal a door.

The other side of the door is dark, but it has a cavernous

feel to it.

An elderly Jewish woman, HARRIET TUBBELMAN, appears from out

of the doorway. She smokes a corncob pipe.

Harriet escorts the two into the passageway, and the door

slides shut behind them.

INT. CAVERNOUS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

We appear to be in what looks like the loading dock for an

'It's A Small World After All' type water ride.

Harriet leads Esther and the Hammer into one of the waiting

cars. The cars kind of have a baby Moses straw basket theme

going on. The 'Let My People Go' song, piped from unseen

speakers, is now at full strength.

She hands each of them a ticket and then lowers the lap

restraints for Hammer and Esther, testing them to make sure

they're secure.

She begins to walk away, but then catches herself as she

turns back to face them.

She smiles with great pride.

The brakes on the water craft release, and the craft makes it

way from the loading dock.

Wide eyed, Esther and Hammer check out their surroundings.

Hasidic Animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of

Jewish oppression and persecution in an educational, yet

oddly entertaining way.

The Hammer puts his arm around Esther and continues to check

out the attraction in wonderment.

Esther secretly glances at him affectionately. It's clear

she's falling for him.

We cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down

the river. A funkdafied version of the "Let My People Go"

song FADES UP and over the gospel version from the ride.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

We see a non-descript door in the middle of a brick wall. Two

turnstiles stand directly in front of the door. We can hear

the muffled sounds of the gospel version of "Let My People

Go." Scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase, "HANUKKAH

NOW!"

The door opens, and the obnoxiously loud music spills out

into the street. The Hammer and Esther exit, close the door,

and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley.

A CARNIVAL WORKER stands behind a makeshift 'Underground

Jewish Railroad' booth.

The two hand the Carnival Worker their tickets.

The two walk past him. Esther turns to the Hammer.

He gives her a once over. She is stunning.

EXT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - DAY

Your typical Blaxploitation bar. It could easily pass for the

Lenox Lounge in Harlem, with the exception of the large

menorah shaped sign out front.

INT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - CONTINUOUS

We see a bar packed with ORTHODOX JEWS. A WALL separating the

men and women in the bar runs along the center of the room,

stopping about ten feet from the stage. Signs clearly

demarcate these 'MEN' and 'WOMEN' sections.

Onstage, a KLEZMER band plays a rendition of a to be

determined 70's funk classic.

Esther and the Hammer enter the joint. Mid song, the

BANDLEADER notices the two walk in...

The Hammer raises his hand in acknowledgment. The entire bar

cheers and applauds.

Hammer escorts Esther to a table on the woman's side of the

wall, and then walks around to the other side of the divider

where he takes a seat opposite the wall from her.

The band begins a rousing version of "Hava Nagila." A good

majority of the men in the bar rush to the dance floor and

begin dancing zealously with one another.

Esther shouts over the wall in an attempt to overcome the din

of the bar.

The Hammer struggles to hear. He shouts back to her.

A HASIDIC BAR PATRON approaches the Hammer and smiles.

We get another shot of the men dancing together, arm in arm,

on the dance floor.

As the Patron leaves, JOSHUA, another Hasidic man standing

directly behind him takes his place at the Hammer's table.

The Hammer motions to the wall. Joshua looks as if his

feelings are hurt.

As Joshua leaves, we get a WIDER shot of the Hammer's table.

A LONG LINE OF MEN leads up to it.

CHAIM FEYGELE, an effeminate slick Hasidic man, chest hair

spilling out of his loosely buttoned butterfly collar shirt,

neck dripping with gold chains, steps up to the Hammer. He's

got a huge phoney smile plastered across his face.

Chaim points to the dance floor. Another shot of men dancing

with one another, arm in arm.

This guy is clearly making the Hammer nervous.

Mordechai is flustered.

The Hammer gets up quickly and leaves.

We cut to Esther's side of the wall. The Hammer walks behind

her while she checks out the band on stage.

She turns around, pleasantly surprised.

She looks relieved.

INT. THE HAMMER'S PAD - NIGHT

A smooth, laid back Blaxploitation era song pumps from the

speakers. We do a SLOW PAN from the stereo into a TIGHT SHOT

of Esther and the Hammer slow dancing. Sexy. Esther grunts

and moans a bit.

We begin a SLOW ZOOM back from the two, eventually pulling

back far enough to see what Esther's moaning about. The

Hammer is a seriously terrible dancer, stepping on her toes,

forcing her into awkward positions, etc.

We see a CU of the Hammer accidentally stepping on her toes

yet again.

Esther pulls herself away from the Hammer.

We see a TIGHT MEDIUM SHOT of Esther. Her erect nipples are

clearly outlined through her blouse. Now, the Hammer's really

getting it.

He thinks for a moment.

She's warming up.

She's on fire for him.

She grabs him and kisses him passionately.

She begins to unzip his pants. We cut to a shot of an excited

Mordechai as we hear the sound of the unzipping of his pants

reach its conclusion.

A CU on her as she looks down at his Jewish Manhood. A wide

eyed, almost shocked reaction. She slowly looks back to him

and smiles slyly.

As the two embrace, we RACK FOCUS from the two of them in the

BG to the Hanukkah candles burning brightly on the menorah in

the FG. We blur out of focus.

EXT. NEW YORK CITYSCAPE - MORNING

The sun rises over the city.

INT. HAMMER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

We start close on the Hammer's hand as he screws a light bulb

into his electric Menorah until it glows orange.

Esther caresses the Hammer's chest as the two enjoy a post

coital cigarette.

The Hammer gives her ass a smack, and then picks up a

container filled with some kind of WHITE POWDER.

He snorts a bit of it off of the Star Of David chain that

hangs from his neck, and places the container of white powder

back in its place by the menorah.

Esther is mortified.

She relaxes.

She cuts him off.

The Hammer sits up.

The Hammer goes into a fit.

He makes a realization.

He thinks aloud.

The phone RINGS, and the Hammer picks it up.

We WIPE INTO SPLIT SCREEN. The Chief is on the other end.

INT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - MAIN CHAMBER - DAY

The Star Of David vault-like doors open, and the Hammer and

Esther hurriedly enter the room. The Chief waits for them.

He clicks a button on a remote control, and static fills the

GIANT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SCREEN, eventually fading into the

image of a larger then life SANTA.

An image of a GIANT CLOCK in the shape of a Star Of David.

We TILT down to reveal a BLUE GLOWING SUBSTANCE in its base.

Santa comes back on screen.

He struggles with this one. He looks at someone O.S. at the

North Pole.

A notepad and pen are handed to him from O.S. Santa makes

some written calculations on the notepad. He's clearly having

trouble.

The Hammer and Esther exchange looks.

Tiny Tim hobbles into frame on his crutches.

The two laugh hysterically.

The transmission, however, doesn't end. The two abruptly stop

laughing. Santa begins to talk to TINY TIM.

We cut to more confused reactions of the Hammer and Esther.

Santa looks towards the camera and begins to react strangely.

Santa approaches the camera.

Static fills the screen.

The Hammer turns to the Chief.

He turns his attention to Esther.

The Hammer exits. Esther is dejected.

EXT. BEN GURION AIRPORT - ISRAEL - DAY

A STOCK FOOTAGE shot of an airplane landing. SUPERIMPOSED

OVER THE IMAGE are the words, "BEN GURION AIRPORT - ISRAEL."

We cut to the Hammer who's watching this stock footage of the

airplane landing on a TELEVISION SET by the "CHERTZ" car

rental counter.

INT. BEN GURION AIRPORT - CHERTZ CAR RENTAL COUNTER

The Hammer approaches the counter where a female ISRAELI

RENTAL AGENT stands waiting.

The Ch sound she makes is accompanied by a whole lot of

spittle. The Hammer wipes his face, and then returns the

favor.

She's unfazed. The Hammer continues.

She checks her rental sheet.

She nails him again. Seriously annoyed, he wipes his face

clean once more.

The Hammer puts his hand up as a shield and cuts her off

quickly.

EXT. ISRAELI OPEN  HIGHWAY - DAY

70's road music occupies the soundtrack as we see a shot of

the fast moving pavement of the open road. Slowly, we PULL

BACK to reveal the Hammer throttling a monstrous HARLEY

CHOPPER MOTORCYCLE.

The Hammer's Talis flaps wildly in the wind. His Shtreml

helmet is strapped on tight over his goggles.

The scenery, oddly enough, resembles the Mojave Desert.

We cut to a sign reading "THE WEST BANK PALMS: A GATED

COMMUNITY. COMING SOON!" On it, we see an illustration of a

housing compound surrounded by a remarkable amount of BARBED

WIRE.

We PAN over to the highway as the Hammer zips past on his

motorcycle.

INT. ESTHER'S CADILLAC - CONTINUOUS

The Hammer, unaware of her presence, speeds by her large

Cadillac. She puts the car into gear.

EXT. ISRAELI OPEN  HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Tucked out of sight behind a billboard, Esther pulls off from

her side of the road and onto the highway in pursuit of the

Hammer. And yes, the car is lowered, with white walled tires.

The camera makes it way up to reveal a large ROADSIDE

BILLBOARD ARROW, resembling the ones you might see

advertising casinos on the drive into Vegas announces "THE

JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK. 20 Kilometers."

EXT. JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK - AFTERNOON

From the outside the J.A.C has the appearance of an

observatory. For no apparent reason, a small MOTORCYCLE RAMP

sits near the front door.

A single Fed-Y truck pulls into the dirt parking lot.

A gang of THUG ELVES spill out of the back of the truck as a

S.W.A.T. team would.

The Head Elf jumps out, and out of frame.

An ELF FLUNKY stand by a SMALL MOTORCYCLE RAMP, studying it

curiously. The Head Elf walks into frame.

The HEAD THUG ELF points up towards the sky.

The Thug Elves look up to the sky, and we do an OVERHEAD PUSH

DOWN ON THEM as helicopter force winds blow their hats off.

The carriage of SANTA'S SLEIGH touches down on the ground.

Tiny Tim sits shotgun in the sleigh while Santa vomits

violently over the other side. Santa finishes up, and wipes

his mouth with his hand.

Santa takes this in.

Santa paces as a Drill Sargent would in front of the line of

harnessed reindeer. They're shivering in their hooves.

More scared reindeer faces. Comet furtively motions towards

Rudolph with his antlers. Santa sees this, marches quickly up

to Rudolph, and gets in his face.

Rudolph's scared shitless.

Rudolph attempts to move forward, but the harness attachments

prevent him from doing so.

You can feel the Robert Deniro-esque intensity boiling inside

of Santa.

Rudolph shakes his head. The bells on his harness tinkle.

Santa continues to stare down the reindeer as he walks away.

Rudolph is clearly broken, but continues staring back at

Santa as he makes his way out of frame. The expression on

Rudolph's face changes from fear to insolence as he angrily

follows the O.S. Santa.

Suddenly, Santa charges right back into frame, and places his

drawn gun to Rudolph's temple.

Rudolph quickly looks away. Santa puts his gun back into his

belt, and then adjusts his suit and hat as if to regain his

composure.

Without warning, Santa throws a fake punch at Rudolph's face,

forcing the reindeer to flinch.

INT. JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

Santa and his gang bust through the front doors, taking the

TWO GUARDS by surprise.

Santa's men quickly tie them up and duct tape their mouths

shut as if out of 'Gulliver's travels.' The guards are

dragged away out of frame.

Santa steps towards camera and surveys the room.

It's the kind of place where a giant telescope at an

observatory would be housed. The clock is breathtaking in its

size. On its face, in place of the standard numerals are the

names of Jewish holidays. For example, "Yom Kipur" is where

the twelve should be, followed by "Passover", etc. In the

center of the face, an odometer-like gauge reveals the year

'5734.' At its base, the brilliant blue Judeum glows

brightly.

Santa barks out orders.

One of the thugs pushes play on a ghetto blaster and the song

'Santa Claus Is Coming To Town' begins to play.

A few of the thugs insert a bicycle pump into the Judeum

clock base and begin pumping.

EXT. ISRAELI HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

The Hammer is moments away from the J.A.C. compound. He spots

the motorcycle ramp, and then guns his engine. He's close!

INT. JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK - CONTINUOUS

Inside, Santa and his thugs hear the sound of the Chopper

growing in strength. The ROAR of the engines is piercingly

loud! And then nothing.

A beat passes, and then the Hammer's motorcycle busts open

the front door.

An INSERT of the Hammer's bike skidding to a stop.

As Santa goes for his gun, the Hammer interrupts him...

Santa is confused.

Still on the bike, the Hammer uses his feet to backpeddle the

motorcycle to the doorway. Looks of bewilderment from Santa

and his gang.

The Hammer reaches the doorway and kisses his hand. A John

Wooish SLO-MO shot as the Hammer touches his hand to the

mezuzah nailed to the doorframe.

The Hammer jumps off the bike, and we get the requisite QUICK

push in on him as he pulls out two Uzi's from under his

jacket.

Santa draws a pistol, and with a single shot from his Uzi,

the Hammer blows it out of his hand.

It lands on the other side of the room. Santa looks up from

his empty hand.

Santa's Elf Thugs open a CHEST filled with LARGE SUB-MACHINE

GUNS. The chest is labeled "HEAVY ARTILLERY." With great

difficulty, they struggle to pull the heavy machinery out of

the box.

The Hammer, mildly amused, watches them.

The Hammer blasts away, and the elves scramble for safety.

The sound of gunfire is deafening and constant.

An Elf sneaks quietly towards Santa's gun.

Esther walks in through the front door and spots something

O.S. that gives her cause for concern.

Unbeknownst to the Hammer, the SNEAKY ELF picks up Santa's

gun.  He raises it at the Hammer, ready to fire.

The Hammer turns and nails the elf just in time.

Esther, gun drawn, backs up into frame with the Hammer, and

the two fire off rounds.

We do another QUICK PUSH into the Hammer as he turns towards

Tiny Tim.

Tiny Tim, standing alone with his crutches tucked under his

arms, looks like a deer caught in headlights.

The Hammer grins mischievously.

The Hammer begins firing.

In SLOW-MOTION, Tiny Tim hobbles as fast as he can towards an

overturned table, gunfire trailing him.

Like a pole vaulter with two poles, Tiny Tim plants his

crutches firmly into the ground and launches himself over the

table.

He lands directly on top of Santa, who cowers underneath the

table.

We DOLLY BACK with the Hammer as he approaches the camera,

firing rounds at the table.

We cut to the duct taped Hasidic Guards tied to their chairs.

One of them frantically nudges the other and motions to the

window. Fear fills both of their eyes.

We see what they see. Through the window, the SUN is quickly

setting behind the mountains.

We cut back to the Hammer. The speed with which he shoots

begins to slow.

Esther, checking the clock for damage calls to him.

We cut back to Santa and Tiny Tim underneath the table. We

HEAR the shooting continue to slow, until finally it ceases

altogether. Santa and Tiny Tim exchange looks.

Tiny Tim pokes his head over the table to see...

The Hammer and Esther lie together slumped up against the

wall. They look exhausted.

Tiny Tim drops back below the table.

He thinks for a second. An idea forms.

Santa makes the connection.

A blank look from Tiny Tim.

The Hammer's POV as Santa and his thugs approach him

cautiously.

Santa turns to his thugs.

Another blank look from Tiny Tim.

He thinks about it.

Santa grabs Esther and attempts to pull her up. The Hammer

holds on tightly to her other hand, but isn't strong enough

to resist Santa's might. Esther's hand is pulled from his

firm grip, and Santa takes her into his arms.

Santa forces her out the front door, leaving Tiny Tim alone

with the Hammer. O.S., we hear the sound of Santa's Sled

taking off.

We see a shot of the elves pumping out the Judeum from the

clock, and then tilt up to reveal its face.

The dial slowly spins past 'Yom Kippur', 'Passover',

'Hanukkah,' 'Purim', and then finally the 'Macy's 50% Off

Spring Sale.'

Tiny Tim raises his gun point blank at the Hammer.

It seems all is lost when...

We hear the sounds of a whole lot of GUNS being COCKED.

Tiny Tim turns around to see the ENTIRE KWANZAA LIBERATION

FRONT with their guns raised at him. Jamal, standing next to

Mohammed, flashes Tiny Tim a smile.

INT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - MAIN CHAMBER - SATURDAY NIGHT

The Hammer and Mohammed enter through the vault doors. The

Chief waits anxiously.

The Chief notices the Hammer's dejected look.

The Chief, overcome by sadness, slumps down into a chair.

Mo, standing in the BG, gives the Chief the fist/chest

salute.

The Chief shakes his head yes.

The Hammer motions to Mo, and the two begin to leave. They

pass by Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. The Hammer acknowledges him.

Mo whispers into the Hammer's ear.

EXT. NORTH POLE - DAY

The Hammer and Mo crawl onto the snow covered bluff

overlooking Santa's Workshop. With his binoculars, the Hammer

scopes out the compound below.

BINOCULAR POV - Instead of your standard two circles filling

the screen, we see the world through a pair of Star Of

Davids. The place resembles the exterior of an industrial

warehouse, with two Elves on guard with guns.

The Hammer puts the binoculars down.

The Hammer pulls out a LAPTOP COMPUTER.

The Hammer makes a few keystrokes and turns the screen

towards Mo.

Mo's interest is seriously peaked.

The Hammer does some computing.

Mo's eyes widen.

He grabs the laptop from the Hammer and looks at the screen.

A picture of TAWANDA making out with a GERMAN man decked out

in lederhosen on a rural German hillside. The two are

surrounded by sheep.

Mo gives a sigh of relief.

Mo goes for the keyboard.

We get a CU of the ENTER KEY as Mo presses it. A SOOTHING

COMPUTERIZED FEMALE VOICE purrs...

The Hammer looks at the blissfully ignorant Mo with empathy.

INT. SANTA'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Santa sits at the head of his conference table. Tawni and

Bambi sit on his lap. A cigarette dangles from his mouth, and

he holds a giant glass of eggnog in his hand. Rudolph stands

in the corner of the room.

Rudolph, equipped with a tray around his neck holding a glass

of egg nog, walks over. Santa stares at him antagonistically

as he takes the glass off of the tray and takes a sip.

Santa puts his cigarette back into his mouth, takes a drag

and blows smoke past camera.

A huge cloud of smoke blows over Rudolph's face.

Santa smiles at his women as we hear Rudolph cough.

Suddenly, the two women are pushed from his lap as a SASSY

BLACK PROSTITUTE rises up between his legs from underneath

the table.

His ego deflates a bit.

Tiny Tim enters the room. He has a black eye and his clothing

is torn.

EXT. COMPOUND PERIMETER WALL - DAY

The Hammer wears Tefilon, consisting of leather straps with

boxes, wrapped around his head and arms. He silently bows his

head in front of the gigantic wall as he mumbles something to

himself. Mo nervously scans the area for guards.

The Hammer unwraps his leather straps, and then tosses them

high over the wall.

The boxes on the straps catch on a pipe. The line is pulled

taut, and the boxes hold secure against the pipe.

The Hammer and Mo begin to scale the wall a la the 60's

Batman and Robin television show. The Hammer leads the way

while Mo, directly behind him, has his arms wrapped tightly

around his waist. The Hammer stops climbing for a second, and

turns to him.

Mo releases his arms from the Hammer's waist. Indeed, he is

tied in.

EXT. SANTA'S COMPOUND PERIMETER WALL - OTHER SIDE - MOMENTS

LATER

The Hammer and Mo drop from the wall onto the ground. The

Hammer looks around.

No guards in sight. In front of them is door clearly marked

"BACK DOOR."

Mo heads for the door. The Hammer calls to him.

The Hammer points to above the door. Sure enough, there sit

TWO LARGE STEREO SPEAKERS.

This pisses Mo off.

The two enter through the door.

INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

The Hammer shuts the door behind them. So far, so good.

Suddenly, the two hear the sound of footsteps coming down the

hall. They duck into a corner.

The sound of the footsteps passes. The Hammer makes the

silent military "eyes" gesture to Mo by pointing two fingers

at his eyes, indicating for him to check and see if the coast

is clear.

Mo bends out from the corner to look. Pennies fall from his

pockets.

The Hammer bends down to pick up the change.

Mo's eyes widen in terror.

The Hammer picks up the pennies, and the ear splitting alarm

system is triggered. Red Lights flash, and over the

loudspeakers we hear..

Mo and The Hammer start running down the hallway. Doors line

the corridor.

The Hammer kicks open one of the doors, and enters as it

shuts behind him. The camera stays in the hallway with Mo,

who looks around nervously. From inside the room, we can hear

INTENSE GUNFIRE.

The Hammer exits the room.

The two continue on down the hall. The Hammer spots another

door, violently kicks it open, and enters. Again, the door

shuts behind him followed by the sound of more INTENSE

GUNFIRE.

The Hammer exits.

Mo stops and looks at him.

Mo shakes his head in understanding, and the two run on,

making a hard right out of frame at the corridor's end. A

beat passes, and then we hear MORE INTENSE GUNFIGHTING.

ANOTHER CORRIDOR

Mo and the Hammer run into frame. Mo points to the other end

of the hall.

Tiny Tim spots them and begins to hobble furiously away in

the other direction.

Mo runs down the hallway after Tiny Tim. The Hammer turns

towards the other direction to find...

TWO ELVES on multi-colored MOPEDS comin' right for him.

The Hammer stands motionless as the Elves gain ground.

Right before they reach him, the Hammer quickly pulls his

Talis off of his neck and holds it outstretched,

clotheslining the two off of their mopeds.

The elves are out cold. The Hammer admires his work.

Santa, running for his life, rounds the corner. He stops dead

in his tracks as he spots the Hammer.

The two look at one another for a brief moment, and then

Santa points at something behind the Hammer.

The Hammer looks behind him. Nothing. He turns back to find

Santa long gone.

He takes off down the hall after Santa.

ANOTHER CORRIDOR

Mo catches up to the hobbling Tiny Tim, and begins to mock

the manner and speed at which he runs, running side by side

with him, circling around him as he attempts to get away,

etc.

Realizing that it'd be impossible to outrun him, Tiny Tim

comes to a stop.

Mo trains his pistol on him.

Tiny Tim closes his eyes in anticipation of the worst.

Mo grabs both of his crutches from under his arm and runs

off. Tiny Tim wobbles a few steps and then slumps down

against the wall. We PULL AWAY from Tiny Tim as he calls to

Mo.

INT. SANTA'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Santa enters the room and begins to frantically barricade the

front door with anything he can find: a chair, a large

crucifix, a CART OF TOMATOES. Feeling confident that the door

is secure, he turns around to find the Hammer standing in

front of him.

The Hammer grabs Santa by his shirt.

The Hammer's confused.

Santa thinks about this for a couple seconds.

The Hammer looks up from his interrogation and spots a sign

taped to a door directly behind Santa. It reads, "THE ROOM

WHERE THE HEBREW HAMMER'S GIRLFRIEND IS."

The Hammer grins mischievously at Santa.

Hammer fires a single round past camera. RED SPLATTERS his

face.

We cut to the other side. Santa cowers by the cart of

TOMATOES.

We hear Esther screaming from inside the room.

The Hammer turns towards the sound.

Suddenly, Santa kicks the Hammer's gun out of his hand, and

then draws a pistol from behind his belt and points it at

him.

More screaming from Esther behind the door.

Santa readies to fire.

The Hammer closes his eyes and puts his hands together as if

in meditation. Santa looks around nervously.

The Hammer meditates for a bit more. Suddenly, his eyes open

and he begins...

Esther continues to scream for help. This makes the Hammer

even more determined.

It's beginning to work on Santa.

Santa's a wreck.

He hands his piece to the Hammer and kneels on the ground,

pointing to his head.

Mo enters the room.

INT. ROOM WHERE THE HEBREW HAMMER'S GIRLFRIEND IS - MOMENTS

LATER

The Hammer kicks open the door.

She is restrained to a chair. The Hammer quickly unties her,

and the two kiss.

As they continue kissing, we hear the sound of someone

CLEARING THEIR THROAT. The Hammer looks towards the source of

the noise to see none other than JOSEPH LIEBERMAN. Joe is

tied to a chair, and wears a Gore/Lieberman 2000 campaign

button.

The Hammer begins to untie Joe.

Esther looks at the Hammer curiously.

All three step back into Santa's Conference Room. Mo

continues to hold Santa at gunpoint.

Mo begins to take Santa away.

The Hammer turns around.

Santa's a broken man. He gets on his knees and inquires

earnestly...

The Hammer thinks about this for a second. He's drawing a

blank. He looks to Esther, and she shrugs back at him.

Esther chimes in.

Mo drags Santa out of the room.

And Santa's gone.

The Hammer turns to Esther, and gets down on one knee. He

places a ring on her finger.

She glows.

The two kiss in celebration.

Joe pokes his head out into the Hallway.

He looks to the Hammer. The Hammer shrugs his shoulders.

And we PULL out as the three make their way down the hallway.

TITLE CARD: ONE WEEK LATER. CHRISTMAS EVE.

INT. MRS. CARVER'S HOUSE - SHABAT

Mrs. Carver exits the kitchen, platters of food in hand.

We see Esther and the Hammer at the other end of the table.

They smile and hold hands. Domestic bliss.

With a bit of difficulty, Mrs. Carver works her large behind

into her chair.

The Hammer raises his glass in honor of Mun Chi. Mun Chi

returns the gesture.

Esther smiles.

Mrs. Carver is as proud as can be...

She squeezes his hand.

Mrs. Carver begins to cut her meat.

He gets himself back on track.

Mordechai looks to Esther. She shrugs her shoulders in

encouragement.

We get a shot of Mrs. Carver. She's a master of the art of

pleasant non-listening.

Mrs. Carver picks up the paralyzed Tabby and begins Eskimo

kissing it.

Mun Chi, completely uninvolved in the conversation and

obviously famished, scoops serving after serving onto his

plate. Mrs. Carver ignores her son as she continues to play

with the cat.

Mrs. Carver removes the diaper. Esther and Hammer gag from

the smell of it.

Mun Chi, a forkful of food inches from his mouth, gets a

whiff and then places the utensil down in angry frustration.

This gets the Hammer going.

From outside, we hear the sound of sleighbells ringing.

The Hammer motions for everyone to get up and follow him to

the window.

We cut to the outside of the window looking in on the four as

they try and get a better look outside.

The Hammer spots something up in the sky, and points it out

to the rest of them.

The full moon shines brightly in the BG of the night sky as

we slowly PAN past Rudolph and the rest of the reindeer,

eventually reaching the cockpit.

Jamal holds the reigns and waves down at Mordechai and

company.

From the window, Mordechai, Esther, Mrs. Carver, and Mun Chi

wave back. The Hammer Jewxploitation theme music begins to

fade up.

We pull away from the outside window as the four continue to

wave.

One by one, the reindeer whip straight past camera followed

by Jamal. As he clears frame we...
