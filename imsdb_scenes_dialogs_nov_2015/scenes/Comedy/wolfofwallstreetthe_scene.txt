The Brokers go apeshit as Jordan grabs the Dwarf by his

pants and collar. In the Crowd, cash flies as side bets

are made. Jordan winds up, aims for the "dartboard".

The Brokers cheer, and as the screaming Dwarf takes

flight, hurtling toward camera, we FREEZE FRAME:

Jordan, 7, smiles as he poses behind a lemonade stand,

his parents Max and Leah behind him; Jordan, 13, stands

holding a styrofoam cooler, selling ices on the beach;

Jordan, 18, smiles as he holds an Amway sales brochure.

A CHERRY RED Ferrari Testarossa ZOOMS down the L.I.E.

The Ferrari weaves in and out of traffic.

We see the same Ferrari, now in WHITE, as it zooms away,

a BLONDE head bobbing up and down in Jordan's lap.

A twin-engine Bell Jet helicopter descends over a huge

mansion, with sparkling pool, tennis court and waterfall.

We see NAOMI, 24, blonde and gorgeous, a living wet dream

in LaPerla lingerie.

Naomi licks her lips; she's incredibly, painfully hot.

Over the following, WE SEE a quick

All taken from TV; a mansion from Lifestyles of the Rich

and Famous; wealthy PEOPLE applauding at a polo match;

a yacht sailing crystal blue seas; Robert Wagner and

Stephanie Powers toasting with champagne on Hart to Hart.

Sweaty, wild-eyed and naked, Jordan fucks an HISPANIC

HOOKER from behind.

He dismounts, snorts some coke through a straw, then uses

it to blow some into her asshole.

Alone in a private room, Jordan unloads a small suitcase

filled with stacks and stacks of hundred dollar bills.

CLOSE ON - a huge diamond engagement ring.

Jordan is down on one knee, proposing; Naomi

hyperventilates as he puts the ring on her finger -- a

seven carat, yellow canary diamond in a platinum setting.

Inside a jumbo jet, a wild, mid-air party is in progress.

Jordan stands in the steaming shower.

Jordan looks at himself in the mirror.      His eyes are

bloodshot - he looks like shit.

Jordan looks at a Visine bottle - "Recommended Dosage -

Two Drops". He squirts six drops in each eye.

Fully dressed and standing amid hundreds of suits, Jordan

pops two white pills, swigs some juice.

Jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland. On the fluffy

pink carpet is Naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her

hips, Manolo Blahniks showing polished red toes. Between

her legs sits SKYLAR, their 5-month-old daughter.

Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages     3/5/13

The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Donnie nods, turns to go, but suddenly he turns back and

thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming

goldfish. The Broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified.

Dozen of Brokers and Sales Assistants look over as Donnie

snatches up the fish. Holding it by its tail, he jumps         *

up on the desk of the Broker in a bowtie. Now the entire

Bullpen looks over.

With the flair of a showman, Donnie pops the fish in his

mouth, swallowing it whole. The Brokers cheer wildly.

Donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the Broker in a

bowtie:

Bowtie is stunned. And as Donnie storms off, we PUSH IN

on Jordan, watching from across the room.

(FEB `95)

Jordan finishes a phone call as Donnie enters with STEVE

MADDEN, 30s, dressed in wrinkled navy blazer, cargo pants

and T-shirt, a baseball cap over his scraggly, thinning

hair. Jordan smiles, crosses to greet him.

And as they ad lib greetings, settle in at the couch:

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

Before Jordan is even finished, the Brokers GO BERSERK,

some already dialing their phones.

Agent Denham exits the elevator, arriving for work. He

strides between cubicles, briefcase in hand. He enters --

-- where pinned up on one wall is a massive chart on

Stratton's operations: pictures of Jordan, Donnie and

others, a hierarchy, a history, an investigation...

Total sales frenzy. The CAMERA PANS the 300 Brokers, who

work the phones like mad.

--the hottest new issue on       --up two dollars while I'm

Wall Street!                     talking to you!

And as we continue PANNING the room...

We continue PANNING the frenzied Brokers...

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

Barry Kleinman sits at his desk, talking on the phone.

On Jordan.    Uh-oh.

Wearing goggles and protective headphones, square-jawed

FBI Agent Patrick Denham takes target practice.

The East Harlem institution. Jordan sits across a table

over pasta with private investigator BO DIETL, 40s.

Jordan nods, wheels turning, pretending to do as told.

As Agent Denham steps into frame, another FED, AGENT           *

HUGHES, beside him, both G-man stoic in impenetrably dark      *

glasses --

They look up. On the yacht Naomi, Jordan stands waving,

drinking wine with two Blue Chip HOOKERS in bikinis.

Denham shares a look with his cohort: it's almost a joke,

this display of wealth before a federal agent. Moments

later, they step aboard.

Jordan trades looks with Donnie, who shifts

uncomfortably.

Jordan sits with two CUSTOMS OFFICERS.                         *

Another CUSTOMS OFFICER enters, whispers something to the      *

others. They shake Jordan's hand and he leaves.                *

A limo pulls up at an office building.      Jordan emerges

with Rugrat and Donnie.                                        *

JEAN-JACQUES SAUREL greets them. 30s, suave. The lobby is

ultra-modernist.

They disappear upstairs.

Aunt Emma pulls back slightly.

He leans in even closer, kisses her, then:                     *

(SUMMER `95)

Jordan fucks Naomi.    There's a curious thunk-thunk-thunk.

The bed's covered with bundles of cash. Every thrust of

Jordan's, another bundle plummets to the floor -- thunk.

(SUMMER `95)

With $20 mil in CASH on the bed, Jordan and a stoned

Donnie watch as Brad tapes stacks of cash to his wife

CHANTALLE, a bombshell in panties, bra and sneakers.

As Brad keeps taping her up:

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

(LATE SUMMER `95)

Brad waits by his Range Rover as Donnie's Rolls careens

into the lot. He emerges, briefcase in hand.

Donnie starts doing spastic karate moves. Is he high?

Sure looks like it. Brad looks pissed, and Donnie starts

laughing. Actually he's dead sober.

Donnie grins, obviously still smarting from Brad's slap.

Brad just wants to take the money and be done.

A DISTANCE AWAY, a COP in a patrol car notices Brad

gesturing to Donnie for his briefcase. He nudges his

partner: check this out.

Brad composes himself, lest he kill the guy.

That does it. Brad attacks. Donnie throws the case at

him, which opens on impact, money spilling out. Brad

instinctively tries to contain it... and that's when the

POLICE SIRENS start. Here comes the patrol car.

Donnie bolts. With no time to get to his car, Brad takes

off on foot, bleeding briefcase in hand, toward a video

store where he stashes his .38 in the return box.

Brad drops to his knees, briefcase at his feet. From a

distance, Donnie peers around a corner to watch him get

arrested, knowing he fucked this up.

(LATE SUMMER `95)                                              *

Donnie is seated at his desk, freaking out and trying to       *

figure out what to do. He exits.                               *

(LATE SUMMER `95)

With a flourish, Donnie presents a bottle full of ludes.       *

Jordan can't respond. Phone still to his ear, his

eyelids droop. Drool spills from his slackened jaw.

JORDAN'S POV -- is hazy as he stares at his own

reflection in the pay phone.

JORDAN'S POV -- the phone gets further and further away.

BAMMM!! Jordan hits the floor with a thud, crashed out

on his back. From the dangling phone, we hear:

Jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach

for it; he can't. He lays there for a while, then:

He rolls onto all fours, lifts a hand, topples over.

Slowly, Jordan begins crawling like an infant to the top

of the staircase.

(LATE SUMMER `95)

Having been just woken up, Jean-Jacques Saurel sits up in

bed, phone to his ear, a perplexed look on his face.

(LATE SUMMER `95)

With Naomi looking on, Jordan staggers toward Donnie

like a drunk Frankenstein.

With all the strength he can muster, Jordan RIPS the

phone from the wall, throwing it skittering across the

floor with a CLANG.

Skylar looks on from the next room, crying as Jordan

tries to shake some sense into Donnie. Naomi crosses to         *

Skylar and rushes her out of the room.                          *

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

One last try. Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as

hard as he can into Donnie's lungs. Donnie's stomach

distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham

projects from his mouth and into Jordan's face. Donnie

coughs, vomiting. And as he starts breathing again,

Jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch.            *

(LATE SUMMER `95)

Jordan opens his eyes. Through his HAZY POV, we see

Violet, the maid standing over him with two OLD

BROOKVILLE POLICE OFFICERS as Naomi attends to Donnie in

the background.

Jordan exits the house with the Police Officers.        The

Lamborghini is TOTALLED, an absolute wreck.

FLASHBACK. Nodding out, Jordan drives the Lamborghini

like a maniac, careening off parked cars and trees.

The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

A MAN steps up to get his mug shot taken, but it's Brad,

not Jordan. FLASH. Turn to the side. FLASH.

Jordan watches an INSTRUCTOR lead Skylar on a pony.

Nearby Naomi holds newborn PARKER. Manny Riskin and Max

stand beside Jordan.

Skylar waves from the pony and Jordan waves back.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Jordan digests that.

As Jordan looks at his picture-perfect family, WE HEAR

THE ROAR OF A CROWD...

(SPRING `96)

The troops ROAR as Jordan takes center stage.

The place erupts in a chorus of "No!", "Don't go!", etc.

Jordan raises his hand for quiet.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

ON ANOTHER BAG, this one brimming with bottles of pills,

bags of pot, vials of coke. Jordan and Donnie cut up

lines as a HOSTESS serves Bloody Marys.

She goes. The blow is ready for inhaling. Jordan and

Donnie are doing a "you first, no, you first" routine

with a rolled up $100 when a CELL rings. Donnie grabs

it.

Donnie reacts as Rugrat expounds.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Off Jordan's reaction as Naomi weeps and laments the

dearly departed: "she was so young, so healthy" etc. --

(SUMMER `96)

Jean-Jacques Saurel sits at his desk, calmly smoking as

he talks on the phone.

And as they continue talking, Jordan pulls out a nautical

map of the Italian coastline:

The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

As Donnie heads off --

Donnie retrieves the ludes.                                     *

Captain Ted stares through his binoculars.

Donnie returns with ludes - feeds to Jordan and then            *

himself.                                                        *

Jordan grabs Naomi. All at once the boat dips down at an        *

impossibly steep angle, until it's pointing almost              *

straight down. Captain Ted jams the throttle and the            *

boat jerks forward, rising up the face of a giant rogue         *

wave, which curls over the top of the bridge and...             *

KABOOM! -- Blackness. Slowly, painfully, the boat pops          *

up from beneath the water, its helicopter RIPPING from          *

the deck and crashing into the sea.                             *

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Naomi exits. Jordan goes back to work. Looks up at TV.            *

Watches for a bit.                                                *

Shot on 90's-era video, an ad intended for late-night

local tv. The defining idea here is that while the

commercial may be amateurish, Jordan isn't; he's an

excellent salesman even if the ad is cut-rate.

WE START WITH FLASHES OF THE SEMINAR: Jordan in front of

a dry erase board, lecturing a small audience.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

It touches down and Jordan jumps out to address us --

-- and BAM! gets clothes-lined by Agent Denham.

CLOSE ON JORDAN'S HANDS, at last in cuffs.     PAN UP TO

HIM, looking none-too-pleased.

Jean-Jacques Saurel is handcuffed by Feds as Rugrat looks

on crying, handcuffed nearby.

CLICK!   Saurel gets his mug shot taken.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

ROCKY AOKI, Japanese, 50s, is led out in handcuffs by a

MAN in an FBI windbreaker.

A smiling Rocky Aoki looks on as a HIBACHI CHEF expertly

dices shrimp on a sizzling grill.

Saurel lays on the bed, smoking.

Chantalle emerges from the bathroom naked.     Laughing, she

runs and jumps in bed with Saurel.

With his criminal attorney NOLAN DRAGER, 40s, next to

him, Jordan stands before a JUDGE, being arraigned.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

The Judge bangs the gavel.

Jordan walks with Nolan Drager, who flips through the          *

subpoena.                                                      *

Jordan exits the building. He's fucked and he knows it.

He sees beautiful Naomi waiting for him beside a

limosine; life isn't totally hopeless. He approaches.

They embrace. He can't see her expression: she'd rather

be anywhere else.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Jordan thinks, then shakes his head no.

Jordan's profoundly touched. Donnie squeezes his

shoulder. A real moment of friendship.

Jordan nods.

U.S. Attorney ROCHELLE APPLEBAUM, 30s, humorless.              *

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

TIME CUT: Jordan is fucking Naomi. It's the best he's          *

felt in days. While he's lost in it, she's lost interest,      *

going through the motions perfunctorily.                       *

That stops him.                                                *

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Naomi slaps Jordan. Jordan hits her back and exits.               *

Jordan grabs a pair of scissors and starts slashing the           *

couch. He retrieves a stash of coke from the couch                *

lining. Naomi enters the hallway as Jordan snorts coke.           *

Jordan heads towards Skylar's room. She tries to stop             *

Jordan. He knocks her to the ground.                              *

Jordan charges towards Skylar's room.                             *

Jordan exiting Skylar's room with Skylar crying in his            *

arms. Naomi starts to pull herself up from off the floor          *

as Jordan races toward the stairs.                                *

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Jordan and Skylar descend the stairs. Naomi pulls herself      *

together and follows.                                          *

Jordan races through the garage door, slamming and             *

locking it behind him.                                         *

Jordan putting Skylar in the car.                              *

Naomi and Violet desperately try to open the garage door.      *

Naomi races into the garage. Jordan gets in the drivers        *

seat, locks the doors and starts the engine.                   *

Naomi begs him to stop. Violet presses the garage door         *

button. Naomi grabs a tool and smashes the driver side         *

window.                                                        *

Jordan sees the door closing - he thinks "fuck it" -           *

slams into reverse, crashing through the garage door. Car      *

continues in reverse, crashing into a concrete pillar.         *

Naomi and Violet rush to the car, pull Skylar out and          *

bring her inside the house. Jordan sits as blood rushes        *

down his face.                                                 *

OFF A "COOPERATION AGREEMENT," we find --                      *

-- Nolan Drager, Lucas Solomon, Rochelle Applebaum and         *

Agent Denham all back at the conference table, reading         *

copies of the same contract. Lucas does so aloud:              *

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages      3/5/13

Jordan's here, too, looking miserable.         He stops Lucas.      *

He signs the fucking thing.                                         *

Jordan sits alone, finishes writing a long list of names

on a yellow legal pad.

And as Jordan heaves a huge sigh, we're suddenly...

Agent Denham tapes a recorder to Jordan's inner thigh,

runs a microphone wire up his chest. Agent Hughes                   *

watches.                                                            *

Jordan nods, buttons up his shirt.

Wearing a suit and tie, Jordan walks in to the bullpen,

where the Brokers spot him, giving him a standing

ovation. He forces a smile, waves to the crowd.

As Robbie and Chester Ming look on, Jordan forces a smile

as he approaches Donnie, who gives him a hug.

"DON'T INCRIMINATE YOURSELF.      I'M WEARING A WIRE."

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Jordan lays alone, asleep in bed.      We hear the DOORBELL.

After a few beats, Violet knocks, enters.      Jordan stirs.

Jordan descends the stairs in sweats and T-shirt.       Agents   *

Denham and Hughes are waiting.                                   *

Agent Denham holds up the slip of yellow paper that

Jordan gave to Donnie. And on Jordan's look...

A tractor-trailer is parked out front as a group of              *

MOVERS carry out paintings and antique furniture under           *

the supervision of several FBI Agents in windbreakers.           *

WE SEE Jordan's various cars -- Porsche, Mercedes,               *

Ferrari, BMW -- loaded onto a large transport vehicle.           *

Jordan stands addressing his 700 Brokers. WE SEE the             *

eager young FACES, hanging on his every word.                    *

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Sentencing.   Jordan's mother is there, tears in her eyes.     *

Max rolls his eyes: Jordan's so guilty it hurts. As            *

Jordan is led away by GUARDS...                                *

Donnie sits in his office, hears something -- a small          *

army of FBI AGENTS, led by Agents Denham and Hughes,           *

arrest half the office: Sea Otter, Robbie, Kimmie, etc..       *

As the FBI cleans house, Donnie sits on his couch.             *

CLOSE ON DENHAM, reading a New York Times article on

Jordan's sentencing. He looks satisfied with his

accomplishment, until he looks up...

... and realizes he's right where Jordan said he'd be:

commuting home on the subway, like any other piker.
