A large metal door SLAMS SHUT.

FADE IN:

INT. POLICE STATION - WITNESS VIEWING ROOM - DAY

PAN ACROSS the frightened faces of NINE WITNESSES, eyes fixed

straight ahead.  A POLICE OFFICER walks slowly past each -

FOOTSTEPS ECHOING in their fear.

He passes a nervous SAFEWAY CASHIER in uniform.

He passes a UNIFORMED CHEERLEADER, an OLDER WOMAN, then a

FACTORY WORKER, who removes his "Lincoln, Local 186" cap and

wipes his nervous brow.

Officer reaches the end of the line - presses an intercom.

Witnesses react - GASP - avert their eyes!

INT. POLICE STATION - LINE UP - DAY

The source of their fear - FIVE UNIFORMED CHEERLEADERS

against the suspect wall.  They look like deer caught in

headlights.

A sixth cheerleader, DIAN WESTON, is helped up the steps.

One thing separates her from the rest - SHE'S SIX MONTHS

PREGNANT.

Like saying "walk" to a dog, the girls instantly smile.

INT. POLICE STATION - LINE UP - DAY

FLASH WHITE to INDIVIDUAL MUG SHOTS (with CREDITS) over

LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL SONG.

A LIGHT hanging above a table.

CAMERA CRANES DOWN TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

CAMERA TRACKS EYE LEVEL around the table where an FBI AGENT

(mid-40's, black suit), sits across from LISA JANUSCH

(cheerleader from the witness side) - pretty, in a man-made

way - bitchy in a B-squad Cheerleader way.  Other black

suited AGENTS stand in the room.  CHEERLEADER MUG SHOTS cover

the table.

She smiles sweetly to the agent, then pushes Diane's MUG SHOT

toward him.

INT. DIANE'S BATHROOM - MORNING

CLOSE ON

Foggy, heart-shaped mirror.

A HAND ENTERS FRAME and WIPES CLEAR the mirror, REVEALING

DIANE (pregnant cheerleader in opening - not pregnant now).

She starts to leave - then comes back.

She bucks her chin in the mirror and smiles - she's beyond

adorable.

INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GYMNASIUM - DAY

Sign reads "CHEERLEADING TRYOUTS."  PAN DOWN a long line of

HOPEFUL GIRLS.

END ON

Diane, pompoms on hips, smiles toward the camera.  A SIGN on

the floor in front of her reads: "SQUAD MEMBER."  A SIGN to

her left reads: "CHALLENGER".

BRUCE, an effeminate young man, bounds up behind the

"CHALLENGER" sign - putting his pompoms on hips.

He crosses his fingers and arms.  Diane smiles.  LISA runs in

frame and SHOVES Bruce to the ground.

Humiliated, Bruce RUNS O.S.  Lisa takes his place, looks

straight ahead and smiles, pompoms on hips.

Diane can't take her eyes off Lisa.

LISA'S STUDENT I.D. drops INTO FRAME - her nose is big, she

has no chin.

I.D. LEAVES FRAME

Diane shakes her head in disbelief and turns forward.

POMPOMS SNAP TO THIGHS and the CHEER BEGINS.

Diane is effortless as she glides, jumps and smiles through

it - clearly better than Lisa.

INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Lisa pushes the rest of the mug shots toward the FBI agent.

INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GIRLS' BATHROOM - DAY

FIVE PAIR of LEGS with MATCHING ANKLETS and WHITE KEDS dangle

A HAND REACHES UNDER the first stall, PASSING A BOX OF

TAMPONS to the next stall - and so on down the line.

FIRST STALL DOOR

HANNAH WOLD, a large, pretty girl in uniform, exits and

crosses to the mirror.

NEXT STALL DOOR

CLEO MILLE, pretty, starlet-type, wears plenty of make-up.

She lifts the front of her uniform sweater, holds it with her

teeth.

She opens her purse, pulls out a gel breast and stuffs it in

one cup of her bra.

She REPEATS for the other breast, then pulls her sweater

down.

Cleo lifts the back of her skirt - REVEALING CONAN O'BRIEN'S

face SILKSCREENED on her underpants (thought bubble above his

head reads "Friday... I love Cleo.").  She KISSES HER HAND

and plants it on his/her cheek.

INT. LINCOLN HIGH - SCHOOL COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GIRLS' BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

The next stall door opens and LUCY - cute, smart, very tidy -

EXITS, suddenly stopping to look down.

She takes out a WHITE-OUT BOTTLE and touches a spot on her

already white Keds... stands... looks... then touches a spot

on the other shoe...

She then starts an obsessional frenzy of "whiting out" spots

all over her Keds.  DIANE exits the final stall and takes

away Lucy's white-out.

Squad joins Diane in a circle, putting their hands over her

hand - a la Madonna, backstage.

IN ONE BEAT, ALL SWING RIGHT ARMS OVER HEAD, landing with a

SMACK on the "ASS" of the girl to their right.

As all run out, we:

PRINCIPAL SMITH, a man who burned out long ago, stands behind

a microphone on a small stage as he's done for 45 years.

The LINCOLN HIGH "FIGHTIN' LOG" MASCOT (looks like an angry

Tootsie Roll with legs and overly muscular arms) stands

beside him, pantomiming everything he says.  STUDENTS fill

bleachers on either side.

Mascot looks at him, tries to pantomime.

GYM LIGHTS GO DARK.  STUDENTS SCREAM.  DRUM CORP. and BRASS

BAND start "ROCK & ROLL PART II" by Gary Glitter.

The SPOTLIGHT RACES around the gym before it hits center

court.  The A-squad springs to their feet for an amazing

cheer/dance - strong, sexy, acrobatic, non-traditional.

JACK'S POV

Outside the gym doors.

THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE!

CAMERA TURNS, PLAYERS head-butt and high-five CAMERA/Jack as

he starts through the door - looking around gym.  SLOW MOTION

FREEZE-FRAME as the SPOTLIGHT HITS CAMERA/Jack.

SOUND DISTORTS.  It's LOUD and CONFUSING.  THROUGH IT, we see

the A-squad running and doing back flips toward CAMERA/Jack.

As the squad nears CAMERA/Jack, SUDDENLY Diane's Ked-clad

foot comes INTO FRAME and SMASHES INTO CAMERA/Jack.

DIP TO BLACK

IRIS OPEN.  DIANE hovers over CAMERA/Jack, apologizing,

looking angelic.  A-squad surrounds her.  Suddenly a frantic

mascot breaks through, tips his log head back - IT'S BRUCE

(from try-outs) - mouthing "NOOOOOO!"  He pulls CAMERA/Jack

UP.

ANGLE ON

Mascot/Bruce as he drags his prize quarterback out of the

gym.  Jack and Diane's eyes never separate.

CLOSE ON

Diane's mouth.

She continues as we PULL BACK to REVEAL we're:

INT. DIANE'S BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

It's an early 80's dream.  The squad sits on their sleeping

bags, in a circle, on the floor.  They're painting nails,

giving henna tattoos, streaking hair, etc.  Hannah has a

OUIJA BOARD in front of her, hands resting on the "MESSAGE

INDICATOR."  Diane has her eyes closed.

Squad REACTS!

Squad just stares at her.

As the hand-piece starts to move on the board, we:

INT. JACK'S SPLIT-LEVEL - GARAGE - MORNING

Jack (with a red Ked print on his cheek) stands with THREE

FOOTBALL PLAYERS looking under the hood of his '75 GTO.

They've all got one hand in back pocket, the other wrapped

INT. LINCOLN HIGH - AUDITORIUM - DAY

SIGN hangs above the stage.  "HOMECOMING KING AND QUEEN

CANDIDATES."  A row of STUDENT CANDIDATES, including Jack,

her head which reads, "4-H - A WAY OF LIFE!"

Audience LAUGHS.

Audience CHEERS.

STUNNED SILENCE.  Diane stares at him.  Lisa looks pissed.

The school SUDDENLY ERUPTS with CHEERS!  Jack turns to Diane.

alone, kiss good-bye, then head off in opposite directions.

DOOR CLOSES to reveal a sign "Principal Smith."

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

It's COLD and LOUD.  Starting on his own 10 YARD LINE, Jack

takes the hike, looks left, right - pumps once - twice -

NOTHING.  He bursts through the line, dodging - weaving -

leaping over his opponents.

ON THE CLOCK

15 seconds...

ON THE A-SQUAD

holding their breath, pompons at the ready.  Mascot runs past

them, pantomiming "nervous" to the crowd by biting his nails

him in celebration.

END MUSIC.

SFX: DOORBELL

DENNIS WESTON (Diane's Dad) opens the door while DEEDEE

(Diane's Mom) FLASHES a PHOTO of a surprised Jack and his

parents.

All enter the FOYER.  Jack looks gorgeous in his tux.  His

parents are just like Diane's - mid-40's housewife and middle

management drone.  Their children are their lives.

Jack smiles and bounds up the stairs - two at a time.

She LAUGHS with Dennis as if it's the first time she's said

it.  We see where Diane gets her perk - and her body.

Dennis and DeeDee LAUGH again.

INT. SPLIT-LEVEL - DIANE'S BEDROOM - LATER

The parents react with shock, then absolute joy!  DeeDee

starts to cry - turning the CAMERA on HERSELF.

All FREEZE - the calm before the shit storm.  Suddenly,

Jack's Mom throws her head back and lets out a BLOOD CURDLING

SCREAM.

A SEA OF BALLOONS FLOATING DOWN THROUGH FRAME.

INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GIRLS' BATHROOM - HOMECOMING NIGHT

FIVE PAIR of LEGS with HIGH HEELS dangle from the STALLS.

(We've seen this shot before.)  MUSIC from the dance presses

through the walls.  A HAND REACHES UNDER the first stall,

PASSING A BOX OF TAMPONS to the next stall.

BOX OF TAMPONS CONTINUES down the line - UNTIL THE LAST

STALL.  Diane's hand comes down and pushes the TAMPONS BACK.

FIRST STALL DOOR FILES OPEN, followed by the SECOND, THIRD -

it sticks, Kansas climbs over - and FOURTH!  (Cleo exits

fixing her gel breast.)  The squad surrounds Diane's stall

door.  She finally exits.

Stunned silence.

Suddenly, everyone starts talking at once.

All FREEZE - no one can believe she just said that.

INT. LINCOLN HIGH - GUYS' BATHROOM - HOMECOMING NIGHT

Jack and a bunch of FOOTBALL PLAYERS in tuxes stand at the

All take hands and lower their heads.

All move in to hug her.

over papers as Jack and Diane look excitedly at one another.

Diane takes Jack's hand.

They exchange a smile, first time saying this.

Diane makes a dramatic exit, taking a handful of M&M's from

her desk.  The squad, (previously unidentified) lounging in

the central bank of couches, follows her.

INT. APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

CLOSE ON

A smiling Jack and Diane as they look lovingly into each

other's eyes.

They kiss.  PULL BACK to REVEAL we're:

INT. APARTMENT - LATER

It's a semi-furnished shit-hole.  The ONLY WINDOW looks out

He exits.  Jack and Diane are not listening - lost in each

others' eyes.

The social retards look at each other, excited.

INT. SAFEWAY - CEREAL AISLE - LATE AFTERNOON

MUZAK UP.  A worried Diane, now showing slightly under all

black warm-ups, is writing on her notepad as she walks down

an aisle.  Suddenly, in the B.G. CROSS AISLE, an ecstatic

Jack, in "Video Barn" uniform, WHIZZES PAST, riding his cart.

Arms out at his sides.

Seeing Diane, he tries to stop, but can't and continues past.

A SECOND LATER, he scrambles back and rides up to her -

tossing more boxes into the already FULL CART.

Jack pulls alongside Diane and kisses her.  She notices the

full cart.  It'll cost a fortune.

He tosses more cereal in the cart.  Diane looks at her

notepad, then starts to return items to the shelves WITHOUT

JACK NOTICING.

He kisses her as SHE SLIPS ANOTHER BOX on the shelf.

He kisses her again and runs off.  Diane watches him - the

love in her eyes quickly turns back to worry and she starts

to put everything back on the shelves: cookies, cereal,

chips, ice cream - oh, that struggle, but it goes...

INT. SAFEWAY CHECK OUT STAND - LATER

ANGLE ON AISLE

Diane emerges with an almost empty cart.  Just milk, peanut

butter, bread and a large roast are all that remain.

Diane turns to see Jack, a couple aisles over, holding out a

LITTLE KID WITH GLASSES.

A WOMAN RUSHES over and ANGRILY grabs her kid back from Jack,

punches him and storms off.  Diane rushes in line, ditching

the roast in a gum rack beside the check-out.

As she struggles with it, she notices a WOMAN at the LINCOLN

SAVINGS AND LOANS BRANCH (inside the Safeway at the end of

the check-out aisles) putting out a HELP WANTED sign.

INT. JACK'S MUSTANGE - MOMENTS LATER

Jack drives as Diane devours a king size Snickers bar.

He pulls over.

In the UNFOCUSED B.G., Diane opens her door and crawls out,

about to toss her cookies.  In the F.G., the LIST settles on

the road: FROM THE BEAUTIFUL MIND OF DIANE is a pre-printed

a CUSTOMER, then drops her pen behind the counter, mouthing

"Ooops, one moment."  She bends down.

As they TURN FLASH CARDS IN UNISON to read: "2-4-6-8 LOGS ARE

ROLLIN' ON THE STATE!"

going nuts!  They notice Diane isn't there.  She's eating a

vendor's box.  They run over to her.

ON JACK

running for a touchdown - a la his homecoming run.  This time

he's exhausted and the competition is gaining.

Everything grinds to a SLO-MO CRAWL as Jack makes a heroic

leap for the touchdown.  With his spare hand, he attempts to

smother a huge yawn, as opposing players come flying at him

from both sides.

INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

ANGLE ABOVE BED

Continuation of pervious shot as Jack lands on the bed

completing the touchdown.  Diane falls across the frame from

Snickers.

END MUSIC

INT. SAFEWAY BANK BRANCH - DAY

PULL BACK

To REVEAL the squad stands in front of Diane.

INT. MALL - VIDEO BARN - LATER

Jack is asleep on his books at the small children's

furniture, set up beside the children's voices.  Lisa

approaches.

Ted approaches.

Ted exits.  Lisa looks around, then walks over and kicks the

chair out from under Jack's head, sending him crashing to the

floor.

She immediately kneels beside him, placing his aching head in

her lap - smothering him in her breasts.

Lisa stands, dropping him from her lap.

INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

It's pitch black.  We hear a KEY IN THE DOOR.  It opens, an

arm comes in and the LIGHT GOES ON.  An exhausted Diane and

the squad, carrying things for the sleep-over, enter.  LUCY

STOP, IN SHOCK.

eating from a bag of microwave popcorn.  The VIDEO BOX for

"Reservoir Dogs" plays in the tiny picture-in-picture.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY

The room is neatly ordered.  Lucy sits at her computer - DVD

case of "Heat" sits beside her monitor.  She's taking copious

notes.  Her mom enters with milk and cookies.  Lucy stands,

concealing her monitor.  Her mom sets down the cookies and

kisses Lucy's good-night before she exits.  Relieved, Lucy

sits at her computer again.

INT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

It's a sparse room, filled with religious icons.  Hannah

nervously places a video into the VCR above the TV, then sits

on the couch.  She smiles about to push PLAY on the remote

on either side of her.  Her look turns to fear as her father

takes the remote and hits PLAY.

Video Barn Geeks.

He smiles, gives Diane her vitamins and kisses her head

before exiting to the "jock table."

INT. GYNECOLOGIST'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

The squad, in uniform, sits along the wall.  Pregnant COUPLES

fill the rest of the room.

All fall silent - she went too far.  Kansas stands.

Kansas and Hannah go at it - the GIRL FIGHT is on.  Diane,

Cleo and Lucy try to pull them apart, AD-LIBBING "Stop!" and

"Knock it off!"  A NURSE enters from the other side of the

room.

Diane pushes her way through the fight, forcing a smile.

INT. EXAM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A disheveled squad enters to find Diane on the exam table,

crying.  Her sweater is pulled up, pregnant belly exposed.

An ULTRASOUND MACHINE and MONITOR is on beside her.

The squad rushes to a sobbing Diane, embarrassed by their

behavior and what it's done to Diane.

Squad AD-LIBS agreement.  Cleo picks up the ULTRA-SOUND HAND

PIECE beside Diane and starts fiddling with it.

Cleo sets the HAND-PIECE on Diane's belly.  The squad stares

in wide-eyed wonder at the monitor - for the first time they

see Diane's baby.  Diane doesn't notice.

Diane sees the squad staring and turns to the monitor.

She SEES HER BABY MOVING and GENTLY TOUCHES her belly with

both hands.  It's all very real.  Suddenly, the BABY SHIRTS

FORWARD and we see a SECOND BABY'S HEAD.

Squad can't believe what she just said.

INT. OKLAHOMA WOMEN'S PRISON - WAITING ROOM - DAY

The rest of the squad, in uniform, waits in folding chairs.

A LARGE INMATE stares at them, while slowly mopping the

floor.  All but Diane appear nervous.  The inmate works her

mop BETWEEN DIANE'S LEGS and stops.

As she moves in closer, Kansas is let through a metal door.

All jump up.  Diane steps politely over the mop handle that's

Diane watches as the squad MODELS BIG WHITE MATERNITY

UNDERPANTS over their Addidas sweats, with pillows and

stuffed animals in the belly portion.  It's like some bizarre

Diane walks to the counter and rings the bell.

HANK WOOD ENTERS (greasy hair, dirty coveralls, big rubber

squad reacts.

He turns to exit.

Squad REACTS!

Squad quickly exits.

They stop, still facing the door.

Cleo hits her.

INT. LINCOLN HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

A SMILING OLDER WOMAN with a "Volunteer" button sits at a

table with a "LUNCH TICKETS: $1.50" SIGN on it.  LISA JANUSCH

approaches and hands her some money.  The Older Woman starts

to SLOWLY COUNT OFF TICKETS from a roll.

Impatient, Lisa grabs the roll, rips off some tickets, tosses

the roll on the table and STORMS OFF.  The Older Woman

UNLOCKS THE METAL BOX (key around her neck), PUTS THE MONEY

IN, then SHUTS IT.

Diane ENTERS FRAME and gives her money.  The older woman

counts off tickets, smiles and gives them to Diane who bends

down to tie her shoe.

The Older Woman UNLOCKS the metal box to put the money in as

KANSAS ENTERS, FALLS TO THE GROUND and fakes CHOKING.  Cleo

runs up to Kansas - begging for help.

The Older Woman hurries around the table to help as Hannah

ENTERS FRAME, takes the open metal box and dumps the contents

into Lucy's Winnie the Pooh BACKPACK as she walks quickly

THROUGH FRAME.  Hannah hands the box to Diane who shuts it

and puts it back on the table.

BOTH EXIT in opposite directions as Kansas STOPS CHOKING,

gets up and exits, followed by Cleo, who first helps the

Older Woman to her feet and then exits.

The station wagon pulls into the cracked driveway.  The squad

jumps out and runs around to the back of the car, pulling out

the large black trunk.

INT. KANSAS' BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Squad hurries down the open, unfinished stairs, lugging the

trunk behind.  It looks like a STUDIO APARTMENT - a unique

combination of her grandparents' old '60's furniture and high

school memorabilia.

Squad forms a circle around the trunk.

She flips OPEN the latches.

All help LIFT THE LID.  Stunned SILENCE.

WE SEE the trunk is filled with OLD GUN PIECES.  Stocks,

barrels, flint locks, rusty triggers, etc.  Nothing seems to

go together.  ALL TALK AT ONCE.

FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the top of the stairwell.  Squad quickly

shuts the trunk and sits on it.

TWO OLD LEGS with SUP-HOSE and ORTHOPEDIC SHOES STEP DOWN on

the top step.  Squad panics.  Tries to quietly hide the

trunk.

Old legs START BACK UPSTAIRS.  Girls relax.  Legs STOP, TURN

and head BACK DOWN.  Squad springs into action again.

LEGS DISAPPEAR.  Squad relaxes.

Squad AD-LIBS their frustration.

Squad AD-LIBS "No.  Uh-uh.  What?" etc...

The squad looks at each other as Diane rolls up her sleeves

POSTER ("Go Mighty Logs!") in the middle of sleeping bags.

They're laughing and having fun as Jack, in Video Barn

uniform, ENTERS from the bedroom, kisses Diane on the head,

waves good-bye to the squad and LEAVES.  All freeze for a

beat, then quickly turn over the poster, revealing a detailed

layout of the SAFEWAY/BANK BRANCH.

Cleo opens her OVERNIGHT BAG and pulls out FIVE MODIFIED

DOLLS - she CUT OUT their SCHOOL PICTURES and taped them over

the dolls' faces.  ALL PLACE THEIR DOLL IN STARTING

POSITIONS.

Cleo then pulls out a CONAN DOLL (Conan's face over a

shirtless G.I. Joe) who sweeps "her" off her feet and takes

her in frozen foods.

It's DECORATED for CHRISTMAS.  Fightin' Log Mascot now wears

a Santa Hat and red scarf.

A JAZZ BAND on stage beside him starts up.  With a voice like

JIM NEIGHBORS, Bruce TIPS the Mascot Head BACK and launches

into the following to the tune of "Rudolph The Red-Nosed

Reindeer."

A HUMILIATED B-squad MEMBER - in swimsuit - ENTERS a SIDE

DOOR and pretends to SWIM to CENTER COURT.

Another B-squad MEMBER - dressed as a guy in a swimsuit -

"swims" to CENTER COURT.

Squad members pantomime this to the JEERS FROM THE CROWD.

B-squad MEMBER - in volleyball uniform - ENTERS and spikes a

ball.  It gets away from her and she has to CHASE IT.  Crowd

CHEERS AGAIN.

SIDE DOOR SLIDES OPEN.  One by one, the squad, dressed as

PREGNANT BETTYS - MASKS ON, MATCHING JACKETS and each holding

a BOX FOR LONG STEM ROSES - jump out.

MUZAK PLAYS.  Squad steps off the black electronic met, then

stops.  CUSTOMERS FALL SILENT.  It's a sight to behold.  Only

MUZAK CONTINUES.

Kansas holds up a hand and counts off ONE, TWO, THREE

FINGERS.  All pull the RED RIBBON off their rose box with one

hand - smoothly grabbing the guns they've glued and taped

together with the other - as they move into their next

position (Kansas and Hannah take point as Diane, Cleo, Lucy

and Fern move into the bank branch).  Cleo fumbles with her

box, dropping her gun.  The barrel falls off, CLANKING as it

rolls away from her.  Nixon helps her stick it back together.

SOME PATRONS DROP to the ground.  Others STAND FROZEN.

They're confused.  Just the bank or everyone?

A Safeway CASHIER ("witness" from opening) in front of them,

stands trembling.

They never thought about that...

People start to get down who were up, others get up who were

down.  Kansas and Hannah look at each other a beat, then:

People start to MURMUR and, once again, reverse their

positions.  Kansas and Hannah move together for a brief

conference.

SECURITY CAMERA POV

Lucy and Cleo stand under it, shoulder to shoulder, inner

hands joined, looking up.  Fern RUNS IN FRAME and JUMPS onto

her HANDS.  They POP her up to their SHOULDERS making a

STANDING PYRAMID.  Fern pulls out SPRAY PAINT and sprays over

the SECURITY CAMERA LENS.

EVERYONE near the bank starts to get down.  Unable to "go

about their business" with a robbery in progress, Safeway

CUSTOMERS just stare.  After an uncomfortable beat.
