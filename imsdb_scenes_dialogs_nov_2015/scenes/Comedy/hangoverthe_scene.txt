EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- PACIFIC PALISADES, CA -- MORNING

It's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades. High atop

the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the

exclusive BEL AIR BAY CLUB. Workers bustle about the lawn,

setting up a high-end wedding.

A STRING QUARTET warms up. A team of FLORISTS arrange

centerpieces. CATERERS set the white linen tables...

INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

A simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in

this sun-drenched bridal suite. Sitting at the makeup table,

surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, TRACY

TURNER, 20's. She's busy doing her makeup.

Just then, Tracy's rich, stern FATHER, 50's, blows in.

The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know

about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.

Just then, Tracy's CELLPHONE rings. She quickly answers it.

EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- MORNING

Heat-waves rise off the Mojave. Standing at a lone, dust-

covered payphone in the middle of the desert is

VICK LENNON

He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess.

His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent,

his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days.

Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967

Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy -

- and missing its passenger side door.

Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell.

Vick squints at the rising sun.

TITLE OVER BLACK: 40 HOURS EARLIER

EXT. THE 10 FREEWAY -- DAY

The top down, The Who's "Baba O'Riley" blasting from the

stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down

Highway 10 towards Nevada.

At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half-

open shirt and mint condition aviators.

Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's,

handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy.

Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH, late 20's, an anal tax

attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his

khakis. He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead.

Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school

linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. He drums the

back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this

is his first time out of the house in years. Because it is.

Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them

to Doug in the front seat. Doug is clearly the core of this

group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together.

Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed.

Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:

Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over

Alan's face.

But before Alan can answer--

The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls.

The guys wince, oooo.

Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical.

Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.

Vick and Alan quiet. Stu is still drumming the seat.

They rocket off into the desert, LAUGHING...

TITLE CARD: "FRIDAY, 5:12 PM"

EXT. LAS VEGAS -- MAGIC HOUR

As the last rays of sun fade, the Cadillac crests the final

hill to reveal LAS VEGAS in all its illuminated splendor...

EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. -- SUNSET

The Caddy rolls down the famed Strip. We are again reminded

of the absurd scale of Las Vegas. The 5,000 room hotels, the

eight lane roads, the 60 foot billboards...

EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

The Caddy rolls up to the Mandalay Bay. The guys hop out,

exhilarated. Vick throws the key to the VALET...

INT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

The guys enter the glittering casino four men-wide, all

smiling, all exuding vibe. Passing WOMEN sneak glances. Vick

slides a drink off a nearby waitress's tray as they make for

THE FRONT DESK

A perfectly pressed LEBANESE MAN waits behind the front desk.

Vick strides up, smiling, sunglasses still on.

The man types into his computer.

Vick glances at the man's nametag; it reads "ATASHIR."

Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed.

Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter

and touches his arm, simpatico.

Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer.

Vick turns to the guys:

The guys stammer, too stunned to speak.

Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns

to Alan:

Alan stammers.

Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card.

INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT

The guys enter the room, jostling; Stu has Doug in a

headlock. Then they freeze: the Dean Martin Suite is massive,

complete with lounge area, two flat screen TVs, full bar and

multiple bedrooms. The guys just gape.

Vick blows past them, totally unfazed.

Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan

standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite.

INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Vick enters the bedroom, drops his bag, and starts changing

his shirt -- when his cell phone RINGS. He answers.

Vick listens -- then grows a bit panicked:

When Stu walks past, Vick turns away and covers the phone,

trying to keep the call confidential:

Vick hangs up, looking uncharacteristically stressed...

INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- BATHROOM -- SAME

Doug brushes his teeth while, at the next sink over, Alan

selects a facial wash from his highly organized toiletries

kit and begins washing his face.

Alan nods, impressed.

Alan smiles, yeah, there's that. Doug spits out his paste.

Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit. Doug picks it up,

starts looking for the floss. Then Alan remembers something --

but it's too late. Doug has found the RING BOX inside Alan's

kit, and opened it to reveal a HUGE DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.

Alan quickly reaches for the ring--

Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE

BOXER SHORTS. His gut is sizable.

Stu grabs the ring from Doug.

Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate:

Vick studies it in the light. Alan just rubs his temples.

Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him.

TITLE CARD: "FRIDAY, 6:10 PM"

EXT. MANDALAY BAY ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

The guys, dressed to the nines, open the steel rooftop door

and file out onto the flat tar roof of the Mandalay Bay; Vick

is carrying a bottle of Patron and four hotel glasses.

Bringing up the rear, Alan slides a wood block between the

door and the frame so they aren't locked up here.

The guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the

stunning panorama...the Strip...the mountains...the countless

stars... It's breathtaking.

Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses.

Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed. Beat.

Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt:

The guys chuckle, hear-hear.

The guys raise their glasses, touched.

Doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced.

They all laugh. Stu throws his arm around Doug, nostalgic.

Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass.

They CLINK glasses, shoot their shots, and

THE NEXT MORNING

Shafts of white desert sunlight pour into

THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE

THE CAMERA follows a LIVE CHICKEN as it walks through the

totalled suite.

Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is

covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans,

platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the Gideon

Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc.

SNORING on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe,

the word ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu.

TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 11:15AM"

The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it

reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path.

Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu.

The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all

over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the

couch, onto a pile of newspapers.

Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find

Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick

pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain.

Both men are ragingly hungover.

A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:

Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too

hungover to understand.

Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick.

Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom.

After a beat, we hear his voice:

Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:

Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom.

Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER

turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:

There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat.

Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan

stumble out of the bathroom.

Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night

before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut

off at his chest -- he's naked from there down.

Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.

Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.

INT. HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

The guys, now dressed, stagger out of their suite moments

later. Stu walks incredibly bow-legged, like an aging cowboy.

INT. ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Looking like crap, the guys silently descend in the elevator.

BING! The elevator opens to expose a NICE-LOOKING COUPLE

waiting to get on. They see the guys and immediately step

away from the elevator.

The doors close. The guys continue to descend. Beat.

The guys shake their heads, yeah, no.

INT. MANDALAY BAY -- BREAKFAST BUFFET -- DAY

The guys slouch in a booth, shoveling masses of buffet food

into their mouths, washing it down with huge mugs of coffee.

The guys nod, right. They keep eating. After a long while:

The guys all slowly look around. Then Stu points at Alan:

They continue eating. Alan looks up again, still troubled.

Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth.

Stu shakes his head, no. Vick takes it, packs it into his

already stuffed mouth. Then Alan realizes:

The guys look around. Hunh.

Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing.

Then a phone RINGS in Stu's pocket. He answers:

Then Stu realizes. Oh.

Vick nods, ya. He's already dialing another number.

Vick nods, uh-huh. He lets it ring, rubbing his temples. Then

he hangs up.

Vick goes back to eating. Alan frowns.

Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food:

Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth.

Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full:

Vick scowls, and angrily takes Alan's last cruller.

INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER

Alan weaves through the totalled suite, half-awake.

Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes

him a second to realize what's wrong:

THE BED IS MISSING

There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay.

Alan scratches his head.

EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- POOL -- DAY

Stu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright

sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool.

Doug? Doug? Several HOT WOMEN in bikinis sit up, disgusted!

INT. GYM -- DAY

Alan stumbles through the gym, looking for Doug. The place is

packed with fit people, working out. Alan mumbles to himself:

INT. CASINO FLOOR -- NICKEL SLOTS

Stu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud:

Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands.

Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns

around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone.

Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan

talking to Atashir at

THE RECEPTION DESK

He slowly bow-legs himself over.

Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone.

The guys frown, starting to grow worried.

The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.

The guys wince, trying to remember. It's painful to think.

Stu throws up his arms, already giving up.

Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover.

The guys nod, okay, okay.

They guys frown. Shit. Stu puts his hands into his pockets,

thinking... Then he feels something. A matchbook.

He pulls it out. It's from The Flamingo Nightclub.

A long beat of silence...

Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start

emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before.

They find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket...

The guys wince, jesus...

The guys exchange a look, alarmed.

They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the

blackjack table.

Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.

INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Vick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed

men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans.

Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes.

He's wearing a snug FLUORESCENT PINK G-STRING with "I

ROGER" written vertically down the front. In glitter.

Stu covers his mouth, horrified!

Alan tries to think of one.

Stu grows increasingly frantic.

Everyone stops. Vick most of all.

Vick is just looking at him, stunned.

Just then, a FATHER and his YOUNG SON enter the men's room

and see Stu standing there, pants down, in his G string...

...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit.

The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants.

Stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto

THE CASINO FLOOR

The guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit.

Stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned.

Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS...

Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time

it registers. Alan looks down -- and stops cold.

Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger

is a huge, tacky, silver WEDDING RING with a unicorn on it.

Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and

starts back towards Alan.

Alan steadies himself against a SLOT MACHINE, and shakily

takes off the massive unicorn ring.

The guys eyes bulge, oh shit!

Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:

They guys exchange a look.

Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot

machine. Nearby OCTOGENARIAN SLOT PLAYERS look over,

disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels.

EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- VALET STAND -- DAY

The three guys exit the hotel looking like crap. Vick hands

his ticket to the valet. Alan chews mint gum.

No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car.

Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel

with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear.

Just then the Valet drives up in

VICK'S DESTROYED CADILLAC

The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off-

roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side

door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the hood.

The guys just stand there, agape.

Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car...

THE GUYS ROLLING DOWN THE STRIP

in their ridiculous car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS,

even NUNS, point and stare. Our guys just face forward, each

quietly suffering in their own personal Hell.

Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up--

The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk

in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before.

Once they pass, the guys exchange a look.

Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then:

Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so

as not to fall out of the car as they turn left...

EXT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY

Sitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a

laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now & Forever Wedding

Chapel. The Cadillac parks in the lot out front.

INT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY

Everything in the small, tacky wedding chapel is white

plastic. White plastic plants, white plastic cross, white

plastic chairs. The guys enter.

The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE

GIANOPOLUS, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread

wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island.

He warmly hugs the guys. They have zero memory of him, and it

shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar...

Alan starts to decline, when--

Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.

They all sit on white plastic chairs.

Alan looks ill. Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts

laying out a series of WEDDING PHOTOS on the table. Vick

eagerly peruses them, enjoying this.

The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night

before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all

wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor.

They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk.

The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's

having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara.

Alan just closes his eyes, oh God.

But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and

Chastity atop a UNICORN in the chapel. (It is, of course, a

rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head.)

Alan just rubs his temples, oh no.

Alan closes his eyes. Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way!

Beat. Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick!

Stu hops up and starts pulling Alan off of Vick.

The guys straighten like schoolboys as Steve's wife CARLA,

40's, enters. She's wearing a toga, smoking a menthol, and

dollying in several large CARDBOARD BOXES. Then she grins:

She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs.

Stu and Alan force smiles, no idea who this woman is. Vick,

on the other hand, steps forward and hugs her tightly.

Carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes.

She unpacks 24 COMMUTER MUGS with Alan and Chastity's photo

emblazoned on them. Alan winces, oh god. Stu grabs one:

She lays out the stacks of DVDs. Vick nods at Alan:

Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you.

She pulls out a six foot air-brushed velvet WALL HANGING of

Alan and Chastity riding the unicorn together in outer space.

Vick and Stu do a DRUMROLL on the table, excited...

Then Carla pulls out a FOUR FOOT BRONZE SHIELD with a bas-

relief of Alan and Chastity MAKING OUT on it. Alan just

closes his eyes.

Alan scowls. Then his cellphone RINGS. He angrily answers it

without looking at the Caller ID.

We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.

He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla:

Vick and Stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as Alan

tries to talk to his furious girlfriend.

INTERCUT WITH:

BECKY

in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase.

She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set.

Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed:

Alan waves at them, shut the hell up! But Becky has heard.

Alan furiously flips them off, shut up!

But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making

out with his blonde bombshell wife...

Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable.

STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales.

Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we

STEVE AND THE GUYS SCHLEPPING ALL OF THE WEDDING CRAP

through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car. Alan

sullenly carries the GIANT BRONZE SHIELD.

INT. VICK'S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

The beatup Caddy is packed with wedding crap. Vick is busy

trying to reverse the overloaded car out of the parking spot.

Stu's in the backseat with the huge shield, while Alan

seethes up front.

Alan looks off, lost, sick. Vick stops the car short.

Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out. Vick

nods, chew on that, and continues slowly reversing the car.

SMASH!

A baseball bat SHATTERS the windshield! The guys all jump!

Vick slams on the brakes!

They look up to see two MASSIVE SAMOAN MEN in loud Hawaiian

shirts, KALOLO FANALUA and KIKIOLANI, 30's, standing on

either side of the car. And they look pissed.

Stu and Alan recoil in terror.

SMASH! SMASH! SMASH!

Kikiolani starts viciously smashing the car!

Vick undoes his seatbelt   and reaches for his door handle.

Kikiolani lowers his bat   -- and Vick throws the door open,

right into his nuts! The   huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and

Vick slams his door shut   and

FLOORS IT OUT OF THERE IN REVERSE!

The Caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the

street! They SQUEAL AWAY, the huge bronze shield flying out

of the backseat as they do! It CLATTERS on the pavement...

EXT. EAST VEGAS STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Vick drives like the wind, trying to see around the huge

SPIDERWEB in the windshield. Alan and Stu are freaking out.

Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan

hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car.

TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 2:26 PM"

INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- DAY

The boys hurry into their room, stressed.

Alan quickly checks the room phone.

Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while

Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms...

INT. BEDROOM

Stu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes,

looking for anything relevant. He spots a LEGAL CONTRACT on

the ground. Picks it up.

Vick calls from the other bedroom.

Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes.

Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the

closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring

away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face.

Stu covers his mouth, oh shit! Vick produces the wallet-

sized photos from Alan's wedding, compares them, and nods.

A second later Alan enters, what's up?

Alan looks down, sees Chastity SNORING on the closet floor,

her body all contorted, and freezes. Oh my God.

Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down. Then, a little scared,

he nudges her. Nothing. He nudges her harder.

Alan shakes her a bit harder and -- BRRAPPPP -- the girl lets

out a massive burp and awakens, COUGHING. Alan jumps back up,

terrified. The woman, CHASTITY, looks around, disoriented.

Then she notices the guys staring down at her. She smiles,

recognizing them:

She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a

snug tube top, and mascara smeared all over her face.

The guys have no idea what to say. She kisses Alan on the

cheek, very intimate -- like, well, a husband and wife.

She exits into the living room, picking her wedgie.

Beat. Alan is speechless.

INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- LIVING ROOM

Chastity gathers her belongings -- jacket, purse, G string --

from around the totalled living room. The guys file in.

Alan braces, please say no, please say no...

Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes...

Alan slumps, his life over. Vick pumps his fist, YES!

Alan GROANS.

Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels.

Alan breaks into a COUGHING FIT.

Alan leans against a wall, dizzy.

Stu turns and tries to open a window. No luck.

She smiles, a little saddened. Stu whispers to Alan:

STRIPPERS

Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding, shimmying on poles.

INT. CRAZY HORSE GENTLEMEN'S CLUB -- DAY

Chastity leads the guys through Vegas's Most Notorious Strip

Club, The Crazy Horse. It's bacchanalia writ large, complete

with throbbing music, flashing strobe lights, and six stages

of spinning flesh. The place is mobbed with PATRONS.

Alan follows after Chastity, horrified.

Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched.

She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER

currently spins. Alan looks ill.

She holds up her hand, showing off ALAN'S GRANDMOTHER'S RING

to the stripper currently upside-down on the pole.

She hurries off, but Alan can't move.

Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder.

Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS.

Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY

PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system:

The entire club CHEERS! Chastity holds up her wedding ring

and dances around, WOO HOO! Alan waves meekly. Thanks.

The DJ puts on Nine Inch Nails' "I Want to Fuck You Like An

Animal" and the club gets hopping again.

Alan closes his eyes.

He glances over at Vick and Stu -- but they're gone.

VICK AND STU TOASTING SHOTS OF JAGERMEISTER

and downing them. PULL BACK to see that they are sitting in

THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM

getting lapdances from STARR and ANASTASIA. The Champagne

Room is a dark, plush private suite in the back of the Crazy

Horse where strippers ply their craft; the room is half full.

Vick watches Starr lean over and make out with Anastasia.

Then Alan hurries in with Chastity; he looks pissed.

She nods. Vick nods, pensive, scientific.

Stu looks between them, torn.

Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and

starts dancing for him. He tries to squirm away:

ALAN SITTING ON THE BANQUETTE, LOOKING AWESTRUCK

as Chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him. She crawls

onto his lap, she whips him with her long hair, she puts her

tongue in his ear. Next to him, no longer getting lapdances,

Vick and Stu just sit, staring at Chastity, entranced.

They continue watching on in silence.

More watching in silence.

Then both of their heads angle the same way.

They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked

open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the

Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our

guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately.

They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized

by Chastity. Vick grabs him.

Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette.

Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!

Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to

a darkened, unlabeled FIRE DOOR.

The guys race after her...

INT. CRAZY HORSE -- BACK HALLWAY

Chastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back

hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers,

cocktail waitresses, and barbacks.

Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are

slowed by all the foot traffic. Strippers SCREAM as they're

bowled over by the obese Islanders.

INT. CRAZY HORSE -- MAIN STAGE

A spotlight holds on a CLOSED CURTAIN covering the main

stage. Some sort of techno Limp Bizkit song is playing.

All the patrons turn their attention to Stage One -- then Stu

blows through the curtain, out of breath. Beat. The patrons

look at Stu, confused. Stu looks at them, equally so.

The patrons start to BOOO, just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan

blow through the curtain after Stu.

Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main

runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits

the floor running!

The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and

leaping over the patrons!

Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very

upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the

end of the runway clear the hell out of the way.

CHASTITY AND THE GUYS RACE THROUGH THE STRIP CLUB

Upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again,

leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and,

finally, sprinting out the front door!

The massive Guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of

destruction behind them, like two elephants trampling through

a forest. Just as they're blowing out of the door, however,

THEY'RE CLOTHESLINED BY TWO CHAIRS

being swung into their chests! SMASH! They both stumble

backwards, and then four roided-up STRIP CLUB SECURITY GUARDS

pounce on them, wrestling them to the ground.

EXT. CRAZY HORSE -- DAY

Chastity and the guys hurry around the corner from the Crazy

Horse, laughing, exhilarated from the chase.

Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan.

Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb,

lights flashing, and cuts them off! Two mustachioed COPS get

out and hurry for them, pointing, intense.

INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY

The two LVPD cops, OFFICER MERRIWEATHER and OFFICER BLADEN,

40's, pace about this bare interrogation room, while Vick,

Alan and Stu sit behind the cold metal table.

Vick looks tense, but in control. Stu and Alan are sweating,

terrified. They've clearly been here a while.

Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist.

Merriweather scowls and nods at Bladen, who steps over to a

TELEVISION and turns it on. Merriweather, meanwhile, pulls

out a photograph of a slick ASIAN MAN in a red suit, slides

it onto the table.

Vick flinches ever-so-slightly, clearly knowing something.

Stu and Alan just look at the photograph, confused.

ON THE TELEVISION, grainy surveillance camera footage of a

birthday party starts playing. In the video, JIMMY LANG sits

in an upscale restaurant, in front of a BIRTHDAY CAKE, as a

table full of hip ASIAN GUYS serenade him with "Happy

Birthday To You."

When the guys sitting next to Jimmy lean forward to help him

blow out the candles on his cake, however, we see that it's

Vick, ALAN, STU, DOUG, and some BLACK GUY, all very drunk!

Everyone applauds. Vick drunkenly hugs Jimmy Lang.

Merriweather FREEZES FRAME on Vick kissing the top of Jimmy

Lang's shaved head.

In the interrogation room, Vick, Stu and Alan sit, frozen.

Silence.

Everyone stops, looks at Vick.

Merriweather gets in Vick's face, intense.

Stu shakes his head, unbelievable.

The cops look at each other, scowling. Beat.

Stu and Alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door.

EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

Day has turned to night. Vick, Stu, and Alan descend the

steps of the police station. The mood is grim.

They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab.

Desperation is setting in.

The guys shake their heads, I don't know.

Vick steps towards Alan, heated.

Vick scowls; this is actually hitting home...

Vick swallows, furious.

Alan recoils, whoa, stung. This is clearly news to him.

Stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say? Alan nods, I

see, his face reddening.

Too late: Alan charges Vick and TACKLES him onto the lawn!

They roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it

ends up being a mess of half-chops, pulled hair, and hands in

each other's faces...

Stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart.

THUNK! Stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down.

Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat

the crap out of each other. They could be kids again. Then,

just when it starts getting way too intense,

A CAR HORN SOUNDS

And all three of them look up to see Vick'S BEAT-UP CADILLAC

parked on the curb, Chastity at the wheel.

Vick and Alan look over at the huge LAS VEGAS POLICE

DEPARTMENT sign right next to them. They frown...

EXT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

Vick's car sits parked in front of a country bar.

INT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

The guys sit at a booth, their hair a mess, their faces

bruised, their clothing ripped, ravenously chowing down on

TACOS. Stu's mouth is full of food:

The guys exchange a quick look.

Chastity smiles, a little confused. Alan is quick to retort:

Alan and Vick angrily continue eating their tacos. Then Stu's

PHONE rings. He pulls it out, reads the caller ID.

Don't answer it.                 Answer it.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT

It's Tracy. She's sitting in her living room, on the phone.

Her STERN FATHER sits nearby, as do other FAMILY MEMBERS.

His eyes bulging, Stu covers the phone and hisses:

Vick glares at Alan. Alan looks away, shit.

Stu turns back to the phone, rattled.

Oh, nothing, just here with my

family...

Wow, that sounds amazing!

Yeah...? Hey, you wouldn't happen

to know where Doug is, would you?

He said he'd be home by 5 for this

dinner, and now it's almost 9:00. I

tried his cell, but he didn't

answer...

Ummmm........Hang on.

She wants to know where Doug is!

I'm working on it! Buy us some

time!

No, just tell her the truth!

Honesty is always the best policy!

What are you, retarded?! Honesty is

never the best policy! Especially

not with brides!

Um, what'd you say?

I asked if you knew where Doug was.

Yeah, um, hang on.

She still wants to know!

Okay: tell her Alan got really

drunk last night and fell down, and

the doctor said not to move him for

a few hours, but that we'll be back

in time for the wedding.

Tracy just looks really confused.

Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu.

Alan flips him the bird.

Vick hangs up and nods confidently.

INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT

Back in her bungalow, Tracy hangs up the phone, frowning.

Her stern father is standing there, frowning.

Mr. Turner backs off. Tracy, however, looks a bit rattled...

INT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

The guys get up from the booth and head for the door, grim.

They pass a DOORMAN on their way out, who's standing with a

stamp and a UV light reader.

Everyone waves, no thanks -- except for Stu, who shrugs, why

not, and stops, holding out his hand.

Stu holds his hand under the UV light -- it's covered in

STAMPS from all the clubs they've been to the night before!

Stu yanks up his sleeve to reveal his ENTIRE FOREARM GLOWS,

completely covered with stamps!

The guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the UV

light, too: they all have the same stamps! Their eyes alight:

The guys look at each other, hope returning to their faces!

TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 9:10PM"

EXT. LAS VEGAS/INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

The guys rocket down the Strip, weaving in and out of

traffic! All the stamps on Stu's arm are now labelled in

regular ink. MUSIC blares, and the mood is high.

Stu grins over at the car next to them. Then he stops.

The guys look over to see that the DRIVER of the next car

over is, in fact, wearing the DISTINCTIVE FEDORA-STYLE HAT

Doug was wearing last night. The guy turns off the Strip.

Stu nods, yeah, I guess...

TIGHT ON: STU'S HAND

The first bar written on it is "GhostBar."

INT. GHOSTBAR -- NIGHT

Chastity and the guys blow in, each with a photo of Doug (in

medieval armor) from Alan's wedding. As they move into the

club, every single waiter, bartender, and busboy sees them

and throws open their arms, heyyyy, remembering them!

They flash the picture of Doug to anyone who'll look --

waiters, maitre d's, thugs, bachelorettes, fetishists,

bikers, swingers, brides and grooms -- but all of them shake

their heads, we have no idea where Doug is...

INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

Stu crosses off "GhostBar" from his arm...

INT. BODY ENGLISH NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

The guys and Chastity enter and disperse. Again, everyone

recognizes them and hugs them like returning heroes -- and

again, no one remembers where they were taking Doug...

INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

Stu crosses off another stamp from his arm...

EXT. PURE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and

unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

INT. TAO NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and

unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

INT. ICE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and

unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

The guys race through a shadier, more industrial area of

town, their hopes dimming...

Vick rolls to a stop in front of...

CHAPS NIGHTCLUB

It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in

line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear.

Then they look up at the marquee. It reads "CHAPS: HOME OF

THE GOLDEN PONY ALL MALE REVUE."

But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car.

INT. CHAPS NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

The guys walk into the massive nightclub and stop. It's got a

kitschy barn theme, and hosts 200 TOPLESS DUDES in cowboy

hats and short-shorts grinding on each other.

The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed

to the wall nearby. A sign above it reads "CHAPS WALL OF

FAME." We recognize Stu's COLORADO STATE BOXERS.

Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling.

The guys look at each other, eyes wide.

INT. CHAPS -- DANCE FLOOR

The guys move through the throng of undulating, sweaty men,

uncomfortable. Alan takes Chastity's hand tightly.

She smiles and dances through the crowd.

INT. CHAPS -- BACKSTAGE AREA

They reach a HUGE MALE BOUNCER guarding the backstage area.

He sees the guys and unclips the VELVET ROPE, kissing each of

them on the cheek as they pass.

INT. BACKSTAGE AREA -- DRESSING ROOM DOOR

The guys reach the dressing room door and stop. They inhale.

Stu nods, focussed, nervous, like before a big game.

Stu nods, right. Then, after steeling himself, he enters...

INT. CHAPS -- DRESSING ROOM

The dressing room is packed with muscular, tan, buck-naked

men, walking around, rubbing baby oil on themselves, donning

chaps and codpieces, getting ready for the next show.

Chastity and the guys move through the mob of beefcake,

staying ridiculously close together. Vick stops at one

dancer, trying not to look down at his junk:

He points to a really hot, really naked guy with a funky

mullet, stretching out in front of his mirror. The guys

shuffle over to him. Vick tries to be supportive with Stu:

Stu shrugs, yeah, I guess...? As they draw close, Roger sees

them, and smiles.

He hugs all of them. The guys make sure to keep their asses

arched back to avoid genital contact.

Stu shakes his head, wide-eyed, scared...

The guys all freeze. A beat. Then Vick pats Stu's shoulder,

supportive.

Stu WHIMPERS. Vick and Alan exchange a look, holy shit!

Now it's Alan's turn to look stunned.

The guys look at each other, nauseous.

Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING.

Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity. The

guys all exhale, incredibly relieved.

The guys look at each other, confused.

The guys nod, right.

Roger nods and presses PLAY on a little VCR/TV combo sitting

in front of his mirror. ON THE TV a very Brokeback,

Chippendale's-style male revue starts playing. Stu GASPS.

Roger fast forwards.

ON THE TV we see Stu, wearing only his "I    ROGER" g-string

and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the Golden Pony

dancers. He is way fatter, paler, and hairier than the

greased young studs. The guys look away, oooo.

ON THE TV Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly

gestures for the dancers to take turns "riding" him.

Stu's face drops.

ON THE VIDEO Stu clutches onto Roger from behind as they ride

a LAVENDER MECHANICAL BULL together. The crowd goes wild.

The guys look at each other, confused.

Just then, Vick's cellphone rings. The caller ID reads

"MANDALAY BAY." He answers:

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

Atashir is on the phone at the reception desk.

Vick's jaw drops.

Vick SLAMS his phone shut, overjoyed.

The guys all laugh, a massive weight lifted.

They keep laughing and hug each other, heartfelt. Vick even

hugs Roger.

EXT. CHAPS -- NIGHT

Chastity and the guys bound out of Chaps, jubilant. Stu is

carrying a box of TWO DOZEN VIDEOTAPES.

They get into Vick's clunker.

They drive off into the night, grins all around.

EXT. THE STRIP/INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

Vick drives, Stu sits shotgun. Alan sits in the back with

Chastity. The cool night air washes over them. They look

happily exhausted.

Alan's smile flickers slightly.

She looks out at Vegas as it flies by.

Alan hesitates; suddenly she seems a lot more...human.

Alan tries not to laugh. She smiles, a twinge sadly.

Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute

little toddler. Alan smiles.

Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone.

Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer:

Chastity tries to stymie her laugh.

Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head.

Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud.

She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her

face. Alan looks at her anew... It's a sweet moment...

EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

Lamborghini's, Ferrari's and Hummer limos clog the valet

stand. Vick rolls up in his clunker. The guys hop out.

INT. MANDALAY BAY -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Chastity and the guys hurry down the hallway to their suite.

Vick unlocks their door and pushes inside.

INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT

Instead of finding Doug, however, they find KALOLO FANALUA,

sitting on their couch, pissed. He's got a huge WHITE CAST on

his right arm, courtesy of the strip club bouncers.

The guys freeze.

The door SLAMS behind them, and they whip around to see

KIKIOLANI standing in front of the door, blocking their exit.

He has an identical CAST on his right arm.

Just then, a toilet FLUSHES and an immensely large man in a

red suit exits the bathroom, drying his hands. We recognize

him from his police photo as crime boss JIMMY LANG, 50's.

Alan and Stu glance at Vick, confused.

Vick stammers, trying to find the words...

Alan and Stu look at Vick, shocked and hurt.

Vick looks away, ashamed.

He draws a huge, red-plated .357 MAGNUM.

The guys jump back, whoa! Vick holds up his hands:

The guys all look sick.

Jimmy nods and heads for the door. The Samoans follow him.

INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER

Alan and Stu pace about the suite, beyond stressed. Vick

stands, looking out the window. Chastity gets them all water.

Vick just stares out at the city, not denying it.

Stu drops onto the couch, deeply disillusioned...

Vick spins around, furious:

Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES

against the wall!

The guys freeze. Tense silence. Vick grows emotional.

Tears threaten in his eyes. He wipes at them, angry.

Alan and Stu exchange a look. They've never seen brash, cocky

Vick this vulnerable before. Stu can't help but give in.

Vick looks down, deeply touched...

Tears trail down Vick's cheeks. He crosses and gives Stu a

hug. Stu hugs back, emotional.

They hug tight. For a while.

Vick pulls away.

Vick stammers at Stu, speechless.

Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind. Alan

just frowns at his watch, stressed.

The guys nod, frowning, back on point.

The guys frown at each other.

The guys' eyebrows all rise, you think...?

ALAN THROWING DOWN BLACKJACK AT A BLACKJACK TABLE

The guys erupt in CHEERS around him, YAAA! The dealer slides

over a large pile of CHIPS.

CHASTITY THROWING CRAPS AT A CRAPS TABLE

Again the guys erupt! Alan hugs Chastity. Their pile of CHIPS

grows...

STU YELLING "BINGO" AT A BINGO TABLE

The guys jump up, slapping ten, YELLING! Stu points at a

table full of OLD LADIES nearby: in your face!

ALAN, STU, VICK AND CHASTITY SITTING AT A PAI GOW TABLE

looking lost. Then they take their large stack of chips and

quietly leave. No one knows how to play Pai Gow poker.

VICK JUMPING UP FROM A WAR TABLE

having just won! Chastity and the guys aggressively hug him.

Stu drinks from his glass, hands shaking, wired.

Alan quickly counts the chips...

Alan finishes counting the chips -- and frowns.

The guys wince, damn.

They all exchange a knowing look...

$100,000 WORTH OF CHIPS BEING PLACED ON BLACK

at a roulette table. The guys sweat, tense. Stu is insane.

The Croupier drops the ball into the wheel. It bounces, hops,

spins... Vick crosses himself. Stu looks away.

The ball lands. Dead silence.

Stu turns, ecstatic--

The ball has stopped on green, DOUBLE ZERO. Stu clutches his

chest, like he's having a seizure. Vick inhales, grim. Alan

slowly drops to his knees. Chastity closes her eyes.

Their HUGE PILE OF CHIPS is raked off the table...

EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- PARKING CIRCLE -- PRE-DAWN

The guys pack their bags into Vick's beat-up Caddy. The mood

is as dark as the pre-dawn sky. When the car is loaded,

Chastity takes Alan's hands, gentle.

He trails off. Chastity nods.

Awkward silence. The cold desert wind blows.

Alan looks genuinely sad.

They both smile weakly.

Alan nods, okay. Another awkward pause.

She smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks

off. TIGHT ON Alan's Grandmother's ring still on her finger.

Alan doesn't remember the ring, however; he's too busy

watching her walk out of his life, and feeling a real sense

of loss...

Then Vick fires up the car next to him.

Alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car...

INT. VICK'S CAR -- PRE-DAWN

Vick's car races down a dark, abandoned desert highway. The

guys look tired, stressed, and most of all, scared.

The guys all frown.

Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road.

Things are quickly going from bad to worse...

THE FIRST RAYS OF DAWN

streaking across Venice Beach.

TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 6:04AM"

INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- MORNING

Tracy exits her bedroom in her jammies, looking like she

barely slept. Her father is up, and making breakfast.

Tracy frowns, overwhelmed with stress.

VICK DELICATELY LAYING CASH INSIDE HIS DUFFEL BAG

on top of his dirty clothing, fruitlessly trying to create

the appearance of a bag full of money. He's using some $20

bills, but also some $5's and $1's.

The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. We are

INT. VICK'S CAR/EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- DAWN

The Caddy is parked next to MILE MARKER 26 in the middle of

the windy desert. The Las Vegas skyline is just barely

visible in the distance.

Vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to

disturb the bills, and places it on his lap.

They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far

horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. The guys tense up.

Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He

opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a

pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks.

They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer.

The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves.

The Yukon's doors open... The Cadillac's doors open...

TIGHT ON the Jimmy Lang's RED BOOT as it hits the road...

TIGHT ON Vick's LEATHER SHOE, then Alan's SAILING TOPSIDER,

then Stu's FLIP-FLOP, as they all hit the dusty road...

The two parties stand by their respective cars, facing off.

Somewhere in the desert, a rattlesnake RATTLES.

Vick gently holds up his duffel bag.

Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the

Yukon and pulls out a GUY with his hands tied behind his back

and a plastic RALPH'S BAG over his head; he struggles a bit.

The guys look a bit alarmed.

Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal

IT'S NOT DOUG

It's some black dude. Vick, Stu, and Alan look confused.

He pushes the guy forward.

Jimmy Lang and the thugs look exasperated.

Vick and the guys start backtracking towards their car.

Vick freezes, duffel in hand, as Stu and Alan slink from

view. Jimmy reaches Vick, gun calmly trained at his head.

All eyes on Vick, anxiously clutching the bag in his hand...

Sweat beads on his brow...

Then Vick throws a hard left hook, SLAMMING Jimmy square in

his massive stomach! And

NOTHING HAPPENS

Jimmy is built like a tank. Vick freezes, oh shit. Then Jimmy

PISTOL-WHIPS Vick -- his lip explodes with blood and he falls

to the ground.

Then Jimmy picks up the duffel bag. Hefts it. Feels wrong. He

goes to open the zipper when he hears:

Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely charging him like the

linebacker he once was! Jimmy raises his gun, but

STU TACKLES JIMMY TO THE GROUND FIRST!

The gun flies free and they wrestle for it! Dust flies!

BACK BY THE YUKON

The two Guamians fumble for their guns -- but it's difficult

with huge CASTS on their shooting hands!

ON BLACK DOUG

He sees what's going down, and, his hands tied behind his

back, takes off sprinting towards Vegas!

BY THE CADDILAC

Alan looks around, what should I do?! What should I do?! Then

he spots the keys in the ignition of the car. He hops in and

fires up the engine! Just then

THE TWO GUAMIANS OPEN FIRE

Bullets pound into the Cadillac! Alan ducks down, terrified,

and floors the gas!

UP AHEAD

Jimmy Lang throws Stu off of him and recovers his gun,

panting. He cocks it, aims it at Stu on the ground.

Then WHAM! Alan drives the car into Jimmy Lang at 25mph!

The obese mobster is pitched off his feet, and lands a good

ten yards away, in a heap of dust!

The guys freeze, shocked.

The Guamians freeze, shocked.

Alan floors the car while Stu and Vick SPRINT and DIVE in!

The caddy peels the hell out of there, kicking up rocks and

dust! The Guamians FIRE after them!

BULLETS IMPACT ALL ALL OVER CAR

taking out the tail-lights, the windshield, the headrests.

The guys duck down til they're sufficiently far away. Then

they sit up, amazed, out of breath.

Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers.

BACK ON JIMMY LANG

The huge mobster lies face-down on the desert floor. His two

henchmen waddle up, highly concerned.

Jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious.

INT. VICK'S CAR -- DAWN

The guys race down the dusty highway in traumatized silence.

Vick frowns and blots his split lip with his sleeve.

EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- LONE PAYPHONE -- DAWN

The guys pull up at a lone, dusty payphone in the middle of

the desert. They all look at the phone.

Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and

Alan immediately reach for their noses, too. It's close.

Alan looks shocked -- and impressed -- by Vick's newfound

sense of responsibility.

Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat.

Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the

pay phone...

INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

Tracy is putting on her makeup in the bridal suite. Her stern

dad blows in.

The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know

about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.

Just then, Tracy's CELL PHONE rings. She quickly answers it.

INTERCUT WITH:

VICK

In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted

aviators into the rising sun.

BACK IN THE CAR

Alan starts to take a pull of Patron -- when he freezes,

realizing something!

BACK TO VICK

on the phone with Tracy, being genuinely contrite.

Suddenly, Alan flies out of nowhere and snatches the receiver

out of Vick's hand!

Alan gets on the phone with Tracy, his heart racing.

Vick looks like: what?!

Alan hangs up and races back to the car. Vick follows.

INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

Tracy stands in her bridal suite. Then she just BREAKS DOWN

SOBBING. Her father hurries over, concerned...

EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- DAY

Alan floors the car back onto the 15 towards Vegas, amped!

Stu looks confused, the roof?

EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- DAY

The guys peel up to the valet and sprint out of the car.

INT. MANDALAY BAY -- LOBBY -- DAY

The guys race through the lobby at top speed.

EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- ROOFTOP -- DAY

The guys burst out of the steel door, onto the massive black

tar roof. It's empty.

But Doug is nowhere to be seen. The guys start to despair...

Then...stepping out from behind an air-conditioning vent,

naked except for tighty-whities, his entire body bright pink

from sunburn...

IS DOUG!

And he looks furious. The guys run to him, overjoyed!

Before they can hug him, though, Doug holds up his hand, and

whispers, nasty, parched:

The guys stop short.

TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 7:05AM"

EXT. MANDALAY BAY/INT. VICK'S CAR -- MORNING

The guys gingerly rush Doug, now in a Mandalay Bay bathrobe

and clutching an arm-full of BOTTLED WATERS, through the

hotel lobby. Alan is arguing into his cellphone.

As they pass ATASHIR at his desk, Vick yells over:

They blow out of the hotel...

EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- VALET -- CONTINUOUS

...where their beatup Caddy is waiting. Alan slams his

cellphone shut, frowning.

Beat. Then Vick, Stu and Alan exchange a look...a smile

slowly creeps across their faces.

THE TOTALLED CADILLAC ROCKETING DOWN I-15

Vick is at the wheel, leaning on the HORN, keeping the three-

doored Caddy at 110 miles per hour. When traffic gets thick,

he doesn't hesitate to drive in the shoulder.

In the backseat, Doug chugs bottled water, still simmering.

Doug just stares out at the desert in stony silence.

TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 9:15AM"

EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- DAY

Workers bustle about the grand lawn of the Bel Air Bay Club,

putting the last touches on the outdoor wedding site.

It's beautiful: the royal palms, the expansive views of the

Pacific, the white chairs in perfect rows, the altar adorned

in roses. A HARPIST begins to warm up as well-heeled GUESTS

filter in, finding their seats...

INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

Tracy checks her watch as a HAIRSTYLIST works on her hair.

Then she checks her watch again...

TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 9:47AM"

EXT. INTERSTATE 10 -- DAY

A GARY'S TUXEDO VAN speeds up alongside the Caddy as they fly

down the 10 freeway. A very nervous TEENAGER opens the van's

sliding door and, wind whipping his face, throws a huge

PACKAGE over to Alan, who stands and catches it! Vick nods at

the van driver and shouts over the wind:

The driver gives Vick a thumbs up, and heads off. Alan rips

open the package -- inside are four TUXEDOS. The guys start

taking off their tattered clothes...

EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- DAY

All the seats at the wedding are filled. Everyone is there.

Except the Groomsmen. Or the Groom. The harpist still plays,

though she's starting to look a little pissed.

INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

Looking beautiful in her wedding gown, Tracy gazes out of the

window at the perfect wedding arranged below...

Then she notices guests whispering, is something wrong?

Where's the groom? She turns away, trying to hold it

together...

TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 10:03AM"

INT. VICK'S CAR/EXT. THE 10 FREEWAY -- DAY

The guys,   now in their tuxes, rocket down the freeway,

primping.   Alan brushes his teeth, Doug tries to comb his

hair, Stu   flosses, and Vick shaves with an electric razor as

he weaves   in and out of traffic...

TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 10:19AM"

INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

Tracy paces in the bridal suite. Then Mr. Turner enters.

Tracy stops short, speechless.

Just then, we hear a car SQUEALING UP outside...

INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB

The Bridesmaids sit around the posh lobby, waiting, anxious.

Just then, the doors blow open and

VICK, ALAN, STU, AND DOUG

stride inside! Their tuxes are wrinkled, their hair is a

mess, and the groom is bright pink -- but they're here.

The bridesmaids sit up, stunned.

TRACY AND HER FATHER

walking down the aisle, arm-in-arm, as Mozart plays. Tracy

looks tentative. Her father frowns, not at all happy...

IN THE AUDIENCE

Everyone smiles, AHHS, and snaps photos...

AT THE ALTAR

The groomsmen smile as well. Vick whispers to Doug:

Doug still doesn't speak to him.

TRACY

reaches the altar, then turns to her dad. His face is a mess

of emotions. They hug.

Tracy's Dad shoots Doug a nasty look before taking his seat

in the first row.

Then Tracy approaches Doug at the altar, and whispers to him,

angry, hurt:

Tracy studies his face, searching...

All the guests wait with bated breath...

The groomsmen wince, come on come on come on...

Then, unable to be mad at Doug, Tracy smiles and kisses him.

He kisses her back. The guests all SIGH in relief. The

groomsmen exhale, whew. Vick and Alan covertly knock fists.

The Minister clears his throat.

But Doug and Tracy just keep on kissing...

DOUG AND TRACY STILL KISSING

at the reception. The entire wedding party is applauding.

CHAMPAGNE IS UNCORKED

and the WEDDING BAND kicks in. We are now down on the lawn,

where white tables and a dance floor have been set up.

STANDING IN THE BACK OF THE RECEPTION

Vick, Stu, and Alan aggressively APPLAUD and WHISTLE for the

bride and the groom.

They LAUGH. Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen

him. They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their

first dance on the dance floor.

Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder.

The guys all look over to see

BECKY

Alan's girlfriend of 14 years, bearing down on them, irate.

Alan shrinks down, back to being the chastised boyfriend.

Then there's a WOMAN'S VOICE behind them.

They all turn to see

CHASTITY

standing behind them in a very sexy, very elegant dress, her

hair back. She cleans up nicely. Alan swallows, whoa.

Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name.

She hands Alan his GRANDMOTHER'S HOLOCAUST RING. Becky

watches on, stunned.

Alan looks back and forth between Becky and Chastity...

It's the moment of truth. The fork in life's road...

And in that moment, it all becomes so clear. Alan turns:

Becky's jaw drops. Chastity smiles slightly. Stu and Vick

grin, oh shit!

Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest. Beat.

Alan shakes his head, sadly, no.

Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together

towards the bar.

BACK ON BECKY

She finally recovers enough to speak:

But Alan just keeps walking away with Chastity. Vick and Stu

wave him on, go dude! Go!

Then Becky turns on them. Beat. They both scatter, terrified.

STAY WITH STU

as he hurries off through the crowd. After a moment, he

HEARS:

Stu turns to see his TWO ANGELIC DAUGHTERS in sundresses

racing through the crowd towards him! They leap into his

arms, so excited to see him! He scoops them both up.

Beat.

And then Stu just starts BAWLING. Tears everywhere.

His lovely wife ERIN appears, harried, a diaper bag over her

shoulder, and sees him crying. She rolls her eyes.

Stu shakes his head, no, and keeps SOBBING as he pulls her

into a big family hug...

INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- LATER

Vick, a cocktail in hand, his tie undone, heads into the

men's room and approaches a urinal. Then KIKIOLANI and KALOLO

FANALUA walk in behind him, still in their huge arm casts,

still very pissed. Vick inhales, scared.

Then JIMMY LANG enters the bathroom on RED CRUTCHES.

Vick nods, resigned, and starts towards him. Then Jimmy

extends his hand for Vick to shake.

Vick looks blown away.

The three injured mobsters exit. Vick remains standing there,

overwhelmed, his life literally saved...

VICK, STU, AND ALAN

standing on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific, drinks in

hand, as the wedding reception rages on behind them.

They all LAUGH.

The guys turn to see Doug approaching, smiling. They grin as

he falls in with them, looking out at the calm blue ocean.

Doug nods, I know. Vick raises his cocktail.

The guys LAUGH.

They nod, heartfelt, hear-hear.

The guys all nod reassuringly.

The guys exchange a sly smile, CLINK glasses, then
