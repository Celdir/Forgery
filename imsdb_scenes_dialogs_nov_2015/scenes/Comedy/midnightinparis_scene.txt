This is unbelievable - look at

this. There's no city like this in

the world. There never was.

It's become so touristy.

Well that's just the awful era we

live in but can you just imagine

what this was like before - but

even with all the fast food joints

and the traffic - god, you just

can't imagine what it was like

years ago.

Well you like cities.

I really do - I love cities - I

love big cities with all the crowds

and all the action.

Look at these places - the streets -

the boulevards.

You act like you've never been here

before.

I don't get here often enough is

the problem. Every once in a while

for a few days is nothing - my

biggest regret is that I didn't

settle here the first time I came.

I should have gone with my

instincts.

I admit it's pretty but so are so

many other places I've visited.

If I'd have stayed the first time I

came by now I'd be a Parisian.

Starving.

I'm thinking of a painting by

Pisarro I've seen of Paris in the

rain. Can you picture how drop

dead gorgeous this city is in the

rain? Imagine this town in the

twenties - Paris in the twenties -

in the rain - the artists and

writers - I was born too late. Why

did God deliver me into the world

in the 1970's and in Pasadena yet.

Why does every city have to be in

the rain? What's wonderful about

getting wet?

It's romantic.

It's annoying.

Or Paris when it's just getting

dark - the lights go on - or at

night - it's great at night - or

no, sunset on the Champs Elysees -

Could you ever think of us moving

here after we're married?

Oh god, no. I could never live out

of the United States. And if I

could it would be someplace totally

different.

Like?

I don't know, Hawaii.

Hawaii is America.

Yes but it's - Hawaiian.

If I had stayed here and written

novels and not gotten into grinding

out movie scripts.

Right, and becoming rich and

successful. Tell me the sad story.

But this is where all the artists

came to live, to work - the

writers, the painters.

That was ninety years ago.

Boy, I'd drop the house in Beverly

Hills, the pool, everything - in a

heartbeat. Look - this is where

Monet lived and painted - we're

thirty minutes from town. Imagine

the two of us settling here. If my

book turns out we could do it - you

could just as easily make jewelry

here.

You're in love with a fantasy.

I'm in love with you.

There are our sight-seers.

If I never see another charming

boulevard or bistro -

What a town.

To visit.

I could easily see myself as a

Parisien - strolling the Left Bank -

a baguette under my arm - finishing

my novel - at a table at the Cafe

Flore. A Moveable Feast -

Hemingway called it.

In this traffic nothing moves.

Well yes it was different then.

Can we continue this talk of

moveable feasts at Grand Vefour

because I'm starved.

Americans eat dinner so early.

And I'm proud of it.

A toast to John's new business

venture here.

Well I'll be perfectly frank - I'm

excited over this corporate merger

between our people and the French

company but otherwise I'm not a big

Francophile.

John hates their politics.

They've certainly been no friend to

the united States.

You can't say they weren't right in

not backing Bush's moronic war in

Iraq.

Please let's not get into that

discussion yet again?

There's nothing wrong with your

father and I disagreeing. That's

what democracy is. Your father

defends the right wing of the

Republican party and I happen to

think they represent sub-mental

Neanderthals. But we respect each

other's views - am I right?

Can we discuss the wedding plans?

Your father's used his good offices

with the opera to get some of the

singers to attend and sing. I

thought Puccini would be nice.

Isn't that great Gil?

Just no Wagner. When she walks

down the aisle not The Ride of the

Valkyries. Hey look, I just want

to say that I am politically

bipartisan in that, in my view, to

be a politician of any party one

must of necessity be a whore.

Gil.

Inez.

Paul! Carol-

Paul and Carol Bates - Mom, Dad,

you know Gil - you didn't mention

you'd be here.

It was sudden. Paul got invited to

lecture at the Sorbonne.

I hope you're not going to be as

anti-social tomorrow when we go to

Versailles.

How was I anti-social?

It was so clear you didn't want to

go.

Well they're your friends and I

can't say I'm as taken with him as

you are.

He's brilliant. I used to have

such a crush on him at college. And

Carol's very bright.

I find him a pseudo-intellectual.

I hardly think the Sorbo nne would

have him lecturing if he's a pseudo-

intellectual. You should give him

your novel to read. I'm sure he'd

be able to critique your writing

and show you why you're having so

much trouble.

I'm having trouble because I'm a

Hollywood hack who never gave

actual literature a real shot.

Gil, promise me if this book

doesn't come off you'll give up

beating your brains out and get

back to what you do best.

La Boheme.

All that's missing is tuberculosis.

He doesn't even know if he can

write a novel. So far your track

record's - you know - whereas,

everyone likes your movies -

Yes movie scripts are easier.

Tell them about the lead character

in the book you're working on.

I don't like to discuss my work.

Not the plot, just the lead

character. He works in a nostalgia

shop.

What's a nostalgia shop?

Not one of those stores that sells

Shirley Temple dolls and old

radios? I never know who buys that

stuff - who'd want it.

People who live in the past. Who

think their lives would have been

happier if they lived in an earlier

time.

And just what era would you have

preferred to live in, Miniver

Cheevy?

Paris in the twenties - in the rain

- when the rain wasn't acid rain.

That would be in Meudon. He died

of the flu if I'm not mistaken -

1917 I believe.

Exactly correct. You know your art

history, monsieur. The design -

The Thinker is so powerful because

he thinks not just with his brain -

he thinks with every limb and

muscle - you feel the

concentration.

He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?

So much of Rodin's work was

influenced by his wife, Camille.

Yes, she was an influence - though

Camille was not the wife but his

mistress.

Camille?      No.

Yes.      Rose was the wife.

He never married Rose.

Yes, in the last year of their

lives.

I think you're mistaken.

Are you arguing with the guide?

I

As what?

Scott Fitzgerald and -

Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. The

Fitzgeralds. Isn't she beautiful?

Yes - its a coincidence.   I mean it

is a funny coincidence.

You have a glazed look in your eye.

Stunned, stupefied, anesthetized,

lobotomized -

I - I - I keep thinking that man at

the piano - believe it or not I

recognize his face from some old

sheet music - what am I talking

about here?

I know if I put my mind to it I

could be one of the great writers

of musical lyrics not that I can

write melodies - and I try - and

then I hear the songs he writes and

I realize I'll never write a great

lyric and that my talent really

lies in drinking.

Yes but - he didn't write that song

- did he? That's not possible -

What kind of books do you write?

I - I - I - I'm - I'm working on a -

exactly where am I?

I'm sorry - Don't you know the

host? Some friends have gotten

together a little party for Jean

Cocteau.

Greetings and salutations. You'll

forgive me - I've been mixing grain

and grappa  This is Gil - Gil?

Yes, Gil.

Gil Pender.

Hemingway.

Hemingway?     Hey, is this some kind

of a -

You liked my book?

Liked - I loved - everything you

wrote -

Yes it was a good book because it

was an honest book and that's what

war does to men and there's nothing

fine and noble about dying in the

mud unless you die gracefully and

then it's not only noble but brave.

Ernest Hemingway - this is - I -

Say hello to Pender - the bulls in

the ring don't frighten Belmonte -

he's killed many brave ones. Fine

brave bulls.

I'm sure - good bulls, true

bulls

Why are you smiling?

Eighteen thousand dollars?

Oh wait, that's Euros so it's more -

That's over twenty thousand

dollars, Mom.

Yes but it's very hard to find

anything like this at home.

She's right, Gil.

Yes but we haven't even found a

house yet and I'm trying to keep

expenses down so I can turn down

jobs.

You get what you pay for.     Cheap is

cheap.

I know you love Malibu but -

Did you ever make love in a chaise

like this? Imagine the

possibilities.

Er - of course when you think of it

that way it does help amortize the

eighteen grand.

And don't forget - we're taking you

to dinner tonight at (*tbd).

Great.

And after I have a terrific

surprise for you.

Five if you counted Vincente but he

had lost his hand when a grenade

went off and he couldn't fight as

he could when I first met him and

he was young and brave and the hill

was soggy from days of rain and

sloped down toward a road and there

were many German soldiers on the

road and the idea was to aim at the

first group and if our aim was true

we could delay them.

Weren't you scared?

Of what?

Getting killed.

You'll never write well if you fear

dying. Do you?

It's my biggest fear.

But it's something all men before

you have done and all men will do.

Yes but -

Have you ever made love to a truly

great woman?

My fiance is very sexy.

And when you make love to her you

feel true and beautiful passion and

you at least for that moment lose

your fear of death.

I don't know about that -

I was just telling Pablo that this

portrait doesn't capture Adriana.

It has universality but no

objectivity.

Vous ne le comprenez pas

correctment. Vous ne connaissez

pas Adriana mais c'est tout ce qui

la represente.

No tu n'a pas raison. Look how

he's done her - dripping with

sexual innuendo. Carnal to the

point of smoldering and yes she's

beautiful but it's a subtle beauty -

an implied sensuality.

What is your first impression of

Adriana?

Belle, mais plus subtil plus

implicite, Pablo.

You're right Gertrude - of course

you can see why he's lost his

objectivity.

You've made a creation of Place

Pigalle, a whore with volcanic

appetites.

Mais c'est comme elle est, si vous

la connaissez.

Yes - avec vous en prive - because

she's your lover - but we don't

know her that way - so you make a

petit bourgeoise judgment and turn

her into an object of pleasure.

Between Belmonte and myself - which

of us would you choose?

Vous etes tous deux tres

impressionants.

But he has more courage. He faces

death more directly and more often

and if you chose him I would be

disappointed but understand.

Por desgracia para ambos ella ha

elegido Pablo.

Yes, she's chosen Picasso - But

Pablo thinks women are only to

paint or sleep with.

And you?

I think women are the equal of men

in courage. Have you ever shot a

charging lion?

Never.

Have you ever hunted?

Have you?

Only for bargains.

venga - tomemos otra copa.

Would you like to maybe take a

walk?

No you're wrong. I know.

How?   How?

Trust me.      I know.

But you just met us. How can you

know anything. My skin hurts. I

hate the way I look.

Take this.

What is this?

A Valium - it'll calm you down.

You carry medicine?

Only since Inez and I became

engaged. I've had these anxiety

attacks - I'm sure after the

wedding they'll subside.

I never heard of Valium.   What is

this?

Er - it's the pill of the future.

But pills wear off - and then it

all comes back. No, I won't kill

myself. I'll write and I'll write

more passionately than Scott. I'll

work harder.

He loves you. He's not with that

woman. She's already on her way

back to Rome.

Hello - Bonjour - I'd like to ask

you a question about Rodin.

Yes?

He loved his wife, he also loved

his mistress - is it really

possible to be in love with two

women?

He loved both in different ways.

God it's so French. Er - you

remember me?

I do. Qui - you were with the

group, the pedantic gentleman.

Yeah, pedantic - perfect word.

You're very observant. I need some

advice. I'd like a woman's take. A

French woman - an observant French

woman. I met some woman that I

very quickly became smitten with.

Smitten?

Uh-huh.

I'm engaged to be married. I know

Rodin had a wife and a mistress but

I'm American - we can't handle that

- we're monogamous.

You're engaged and you met a new

woman -

Yes. Her name's Adriana. Right now

she's living with Picas-- with a

Spaniard - er he paints - fairly

well.

Daddy got chest pains.

Really?

I'm sure it's indigestion.

Well we can't take a chance.

Daddy had an angioplasty three

years ago.

They put a balloon in me.    Big

deal.

Yes - I want the hotel doctor -

suite 818.

Why are you so dressed up?

Me?   No - I was just writing.

You dress and put on cologne to

write?

I took a break and showered. I

think better in the shower. All

those positive ions.

We were halfway to Mont. St.

Michele and Daddy started to look

pale.

That's terrible.

We turned right around.

In fact, it's not even past.

Actually I ran into Bill Faulkner

at a party.

You're a raving lunatic.

I guess I'm too trusting. I'm

jealous and also trusting -

cognitive dissonance, Scott

Fitzgerald speaks of it.

Gil -

I know it Inez - you can fool me

but not Hemingway.

Jesus Christ I'm dealing with a

madman - okay - Paul and I had a

few nights alone. We danced, we

drank - you were always working -

he's very attractive, he spoke to

me in French - the whole mystique

of this corny city got to me - it's

over. We can put this all in

perspective at home.

I'm not going back.

What?

I'm staying here. It's not the

romantic fling. Paris is Paris.

It's that I'm not in love with you.

What?

A lot has happened    to me since we

got here. I won't     begin to bore

you - but - I know    what that

feeling of love is    and it's not us.
