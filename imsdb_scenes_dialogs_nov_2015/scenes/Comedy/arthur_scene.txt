EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

A HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top

broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in

Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district.

The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.

A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S

BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the

wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover.

BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars.

We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches

and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'.

Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit.

The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New

York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's

steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of

the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze

testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.

The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER

COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn.

A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light.

An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a

FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window. THE BATMAN - actually drunken

English socialite ARTHUR BACH TEMPLEMEAD in a costume -

lowers the window and offers a handshake.

Arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. The bronze

bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman

utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip

flask and line of shot glasses. And, inexplicably, a big red

stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.

The cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing A

BEARDED HOMELESS OLD MAN IN A CRAPPY 60S `ROBIN' costume.

Arthur counts out a huge wad of cash.

Arthur hands another wad of cash to Cop 1.

He turns and tries to get back in.

The bronze bull collapses fully, crushing the Batmobile.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT. CELL - NIGHT - LATER

Arthur sits, minus mask, in a cell with Homeless Robin and

VARIOUS CRIMINALS and DRUNKS, including A HUGE GUY IN A

CHICAGO CUBS SHIRT, sporting a terrifically swollen eye.

JAY, a drunk with a bandaged neck, is ranting away at Arthur,

who's paying close attention, genuinely fascinated. Cash

sticks out of various pockets.

Jay laughs hard, as does GARY, another crook. Arthur, out of

politeness, tries to join in the laughter.

The cell door swings open.

The crooks look back at him sulkily. Arthur looks guilty.

INT. 23RD PRECINCT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT - LATER

Arthur's attorney ELVERTON DEVERE is leaving with him.

The other crooks from the cell are leaving alongside them.

EXT. 23RD PRECINCT. NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Arthur steps into a blaze of paparazzi flashes.

Jay attacks the cameraman violently. Gary piles in.

Arthur pushes past the press.

He turns to those crooks who aren't fighting.

The crooks all look unsure. Apart from one....

EXT. MANHATTAN- NIGHT

A different, extremely flashy car zips through Central Park,

the back full of released crooks, the huge Chicago guy - his

name's MARTY - at the wheel.

The car passes A MALE JOGGER. It stops and backs up. Arthur

opens a door and beckons the jogger, offering champagne. The

jogger gets in. The car sets off again.

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

The car pulls up outside a very rough-looking dive club. Out

falls Arthur, laughing his head off, along with champagne

bottles, footballs and rich boy's toys. Following him are

his crook friends, the jogger, TWO MIDDLE-AGED TOURISTS and A

DANCING MAN in a leotard twirling a big sign reading `CHEAP

APARTMENT RENTALS!'

Like the pied piper, Arthur leads his disciples into the bar.

EXT. BAR - LATER

Arthur staggers out, leading a bigger crowd! (IN A CONGA?)

He's even more drunk, arm in arm with Carmella the prostitute

and a very attractive young woman, SOFIA. He produces A BIG

ROCKET.

He releases the firework; it flies at a crazy drunk angle,

people screaming and diving for cover. It explodes into a

shop sign reading `CHECKS CASHED'.

EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

A very long line of excited people stand at an ATM, Arthur at

the front.

The man laughs, along with others in the line, including

Sofia who catches his eye.

Arthur dials a number on his gold iPhone.

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The Maitre D' enters from the kitchen and is stunned to find

the restaurant incredibly stuffed with people, so there's

standing room only. People are even sitting on tables. It's a

very eclectic mix of people.

An angry, stuffy old man and his wife and daughter sit

horrified at the center.

Arthur's flanked by Carmella the prostitute and Sofia from

the ATM line.

The daughter of the stuffy couple - she's ERICA - speaks.

It's all gone a bit tense.

He gets out his ultra-exclusive Black Visa Card.

EXT. PIERRE HOTEL - DAY

The bright dawn sun explodes on the windows of Arthur's

castle-like $56 million penthouse atop the Pierre Hotel.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

A huge jacuzzi is full of contented liberated lobsters,

surrounded by the most amazing toy boat armada in history.

We cut around the vast, opulent 20's apartment, scattered

with unconscious revellers from last night. A mixture of old

extravagance and modern excess, the place is stuffed with the

toys of the boy who has everything:

An old gun cabinet is stacked with enormous water rifles.

A `Bodyworlds' plastinated corpse is posed, swinging from a

chandelier, a bottle of champagne in its hand.

Damien Hurst's shark in formaldehyde is half out of its

smashed tank, a REVELLER'S FEET protruding from its jaws.

Unconscious partygoers are slumped on plush seats in a home

cinema themed to look like the set of `Roadrunner', while a

screen plays episodes of the cartoon.

A naked couple lie in a sleeping embrace in a room converted

entirely into a sandpit, complete with giant toys.

Big Chicago Marty, Arthur's new driver, lies on a big sofa,

consulting his sports pager.

Homeless Robin is filling pans and antique vases with water.

A huge photo of Arthur modelling riding boots fills a wall,

beside an old red London telephone box, converted into an

aquarium, bubbling with colorful fish.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Bowler-hatted Arthur and Sofia are having sex...

....beneath a rotating solar system mobile good enough to

grace a national planetarium, on a bed floating magnetically

three feet above the floor.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

A key is turned and the door to the apartment opens. A

SENSIBLE WOMAN'S SHOE steps over a reveller.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. ARTHUR'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur and Sofia are in an even greater frenzy. The floating

bed is wobbling scarily.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. GREAT ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

AN OLDER WOMAN'S HAND pulls on A SURGICAL GLOVE.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. ARTHUR'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The older woman enters the room carrying A PLASTIC TRAY AS

USED AT AIRPORT SECURITY. This is JANE HOBSON, the British

aristocracy's longest-serving nanny.

Unfazed, Hobson busies herself picking up Arthur's trousers,

and emptying wallet, matchbooks, and iPhone into the tray.

She hits a remote. The curtains fly open. A HUGE TV flips on,

showing news coverage of Arthur's antics last night.

Hobson's reading a text on Arthur's phone: `So excited ur

funding my movie!'

She replies: `I was drunk. Piss off.'

Hobson picks up Sofia's panties and bra from the floor like a

crime scene officer.

She pulls away from Arthur, grabs her clothes and jumps out

of bed, nearly tipping Arthur out.

Sofia storms to the door, clutching her clothes. Arthur can

see other revellers being removed by HOTEL SECURITY.

Arthur covers his head with the sheet.

But Hobson hits a touch-sensitive screen on the wall. The

magnetic bed thuds to the ground. She taps another control.

MUSIC: HORRIBLE, DEAFENING DEATH METAL

Hobson reads off an album cover in a little wall screen.

Arthur sits up. Hobson stops the music.

EXT. BALCONY SHOWER - DAY

Arthur stands naked in his shower - a big glass cube jutting

out from the balcony like something from a David Blaine

stunt. Hot jets of water are blasted from holes in the cube's

ceiling. Arthur can see Manhattan far beneath his bare feet

as he showers.

Arthur grabs a pair of binoculars which hang on a hook.

We see Hobson on a little screen inset into the glass wall.

She's on a phone at Arthur's computer.

INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Hobson - in front of an Ebay screen full of purchases - picks

up her own pair of binoculars and looks down.

Through Hobson's binoculars we see A MIDDLE-AGED

BUSINESSWOMAN who does look vaguely like a female Tom Hanks!

INT. SHOWER - DAY

Arthur's still peering down through his binoculars.

A PRIEST WITH THIN SIDEBURNS emerges from A DINER...

A MASTURBATING MAN IN A 70TH STORY APARTMENT OPPOSITE...

Hobson glances up at Arthur, washing himself on the screen.

INT. ARTHUR'S DOJO. DAY - LATER

Arthur, in expensive baggy yoga pants and collarless shirt,

is doing self-invented yoga to Indian `meditation' music.

Hobson is sitting, exasperated, going through various

expenditures.

EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

Arthur and Hobson are in a huge Bentley. Marty's at the

wheel, still in his Cubs shirt but sporting a chauffeur's cap

and tie. As he drives, he checks a bleeping sports pager. He

nearly hits a pedestrian, then goes back to the pager.

Arthur sees something out of the window.

Marty hits the brakes, pitching Arthur and Hobson forward.

EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT

Arthur hurries up to A SMALL GROUP OF TOURISTS.

A TOUR GUIDE wearing a name badge reading `Naomi' is talking.

She is gorgeous, wearing vintage clothes, clutching a

clipboard. We understand why Arthur stopped the car.

She looks out on her sullen, miserable tourists.

Some tourists laugh. Some don't. Arthur's transfixed.

Naomi shares an eye roll with A NEWSSTAND GUY who's clearly

in love with her.

Naomi leads the tourists across the busy road. She has to go

back to grab a teenager in the headphones, who didn't hear.

Arthur hurries alongside Naomi.

Arthur produces his wallet full of high-end credit cards.

Just as Naomi's reaching the other side, a cabbie, driving

very aggressively, nearly hits her.

The cabbie's shocked - but laughs and blows Naomi a kiss. She

smiles back.

More tourists laugh this time. Some...

She checks her watch and leads the party inside a laundromat.

INT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Naomi approaches a washing machine just as it ends its cycle

and makes a loud buzz.

She starts unloading the machine of a large man's whites -

vests, underwear, shirts, all stained red by a baseball cap.

She transfers the laundry into a tumble dryer and feeds it

quarters. Arthur stays close.

Arthur stares at the big tumble dryers.

Naomi looks at him, bemused but intrigued as she heads to the

door.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

Hobson's out of the car looking for Arthur.

EXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS

They emerge into the street.

Some tourists laugh.

The group approaches a pretzel stand.

The group lines up to get their pretzels.

Arthur feels a tap on his shoulder. Hobson.

Naomi looks at her watch and glances to the tourists, chewing

on their pretzels. She starts to walk away.

Naomi starts to walk away.

Manhattan swallows the lovely stranger.

INT. TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

They cross a huge foyer, passing a big sign reading

`TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS INC' to the elevator.

INT. TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS. RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Reception is manned by GRANT, a too-cool-for-school, young

Aryan beefcake straight out of an Abercrombie & Fitch spread.

Arthur and Hobson enter.

Arthur and Hobson sit down. Grant picks up a phone.

A LARGE OFFICE DOOR opens spookily of its own accord.

Arthur heads to the door. VIVIENNE BACH-TEMPLEMEAD a

formidable, tanned American widow in her sixties, shakes his

hand.

Vivienne nods to Hobson as the door to her lair shuts. An icy

breeze passes between biological mother and surrogate.

INT. VIVIENNE'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The office boasts many glass cases full of trophies and

framed photos of Vivienne's younger self showjumping and

holding trophies aloft. There's one small photo of Vivienne,

Arthur's late father GERALD and Arthur as a toddler.

Vivienne's engrossed in a document, making notations. Arthur,

clearly uncomfortable here, sits in a low sofa before her.

But Vivienne's buried in her work, not listening.

Vivienne's still not listening.

She's still not listening. Has it always been like this?

She's still not listening.

Still not listening.

Still not listening.

Arthur stops. He watches Vivienne. He lets out a huge belch.

Nothing. A big fart. Nothing. Opera. Nothing.

Vivienne eventually looks up.

Vivienne hits a remote control. A large wall-mounted screen

fills with a changing collage of him drunk, dancing, puking,

making out with women, beside countless news headlines.

Not after you ran him over in the

Bentley, no. Susan's boring. She's

not funny.

Ditto your father. The aristocracy

doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur.

It's about stability. Continuity...

...and sinking your fangs into

Susan's father's bank account.

The Johnson family's considerable

equity in a stormy financial period

is merely a side issue. Burt is a

pillar of the community.

His baby formula was taken off the

market in six African countries!

A completely innocent error in

places where there's precious

little for children to live for

anyway. The families all got gift

baskets as compensation. That

little bump in the road aside, Burt

is a devout Christian.

Yes, because they're never insane.

And where did he get Jesus?

Burt paid his debt to society years

ago.

He strangled a fireman! Who

strangles a fireman?

Arthur...

I'm sorry, Vivienne. I've met

someone else very lovely who, as

far as I know, isn't related to

anyone who would kill an unsung

hero in cold blood.

Un-meet her. Arthur, you're the end

of our line. We need an heir.

I nearly gave you an heir!

Oh, give me strength! A Bach-

Templemead having a child by a lap

dancer called `Mystery'?

That was just her stage name! To

give her more mystery when

she...waved her fanny around. Her

real name was...what was it again?

Susan is 33 this year. Her egg

inventory has dropped by 23% since

you met her. You risk having no

sons, or worse, some pea-brained

hunchback who hugs everyone!

Great! I like hugs! And some of

them are really good at math.

You know the `Frog and Toad' books?

No.

Of course you don't. Hobson read

them to me while you were off

riding horses over stripey poles.

They're about fun and friendship,

not how many unspasticated tadpoles

I can squirt up a rich girl.

Your father would turn in his grave

to hear this nonsense...

Vivienne holds up the document she was notating earlier.

Vivienne opens a draw and takes out A HUGE RING BOX.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY

The liberated lobsters are now living happily at the bottom

of the London phone box aquarium. Arthur eats lunch alone at

a huge table, THE BIGGEST DIAMOND RING IN THE WORLD is beside

him. Hobson brings a plate of vitamins.

Arthur stares at the ring again.

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Naomi answers a giant old cellphone in her modest apartment,

cooking for her dad, RALPH, a bear of a man slumped in front

of the TV watching CSI. A picture of Naomi and her elderly

mother, in hospital, is on the wall.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur's on the toilet in a bathroom whose walls are entirely

covered in a photographic mural to make it look like he's

sitting at the top of a ski slope, with skis on his feet.

Arthur glances down at the ring box on the floor.

A voice-activated toilet paper dispenser spits out a sheet.

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY - CONTINUOUS

Naomi dishes out the food on cheap plates. It's all a big

contrast to Arthur's setting.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur's standing at a sink. A list is beside him, reading

`Picnic in park, movie, dinner, view.'

The line goes dead. Hobson is standing behind Arthur, the

ripped out phone cord in her hand.

EXT. JOHNSON MANSION. NIGHT

The original Delorean from `Back to the Future' putters up to

Burt Johnson's imposing, tacky mansion. The car stops and the

gull wing door swings up, revealing an extremely drunk

Arthur, clutching a bottle of champagne.

INT. THE JOHNSON MANSION - NIGHT

AN EXTREMELY STIFF, MISERABLE OLD BUTLER answers.

The butler doesn't laugh.

INT. BURT'S STUDY - DAY - LATER

Arthur and the butler enter the large, paneled study.

The butler leaves. Arthur gazes around the room, which is

filled with antique Christian iconography. The ceiling fan is

in the shape of a cross. A large, scary Jesus statue, palms

outstretched, stares at him from beside a fish tank.

He sees a cocktail cabinet.

He opens the cabinet. Nothing but bottles of water.

He sips the water as if it's wine. Lifts it to Jesus.

He checks out a huge, very old, rusty sword on the wall.

Beneath it is a small information plaque.

He looks around, then reaches up and takes it off. It's VERY

heavy and clanks to the ground, slamming his foot.

Arthur lifts the sword again, brandishing and twirling it,

making the noise of a Star Wars light sabre.

He swings it in a full arc...CLUNK!

Arthur has decapitated Jesus! Where's the head? The door

opens. BURT JOHNSON, a large, imposing man with a tiny

crucifix around his neck, fills the doorway.

Burt, unperturbed, takes the sword from Arthur.

Burt walks straight past headless Jesus to the water cabinet.

Arthur looks around desperately for the head.

Arthur laughs nervously. But Burt's not joking.

Burt clinks glasses with him.

He sees Jesus's head! It's sitting on top of one of the

blades of the ceiling fan!

Burt turns away to get a glass of water.

Arthur turns the fan on a low setting. It rotates slowly, the

head going around with it. Burt turns away to pour more

water. Arthur grabs the moment to speed up the fan again,

until it's going fast enough and Jesus's head falls off.

Arthur catches it. Arthur gets behind Burt, out of sight

temporarily.

Arthur reaches out and, unseen by Burt, he reaches out of

shot and puts the head back on Jesus's body.

Arthur notices that Jesus's head is on backwards.

Burt picks up a Bible from his desk and quotes from memory.

Burt really hammers the table this time.

Jesus's head falls off. Arthur peers around. It's nowhere!

Both Arthur and Burt see Jesus's head at the bottom of the

fish tank. It floats back up to the top.

But SUSAN, Burt's beautiful daughter, enters with her best

friend Erica - who Arthur met whilst at the restaurant the

other night.

Burt looks from Jesus's head to the sword, figuring it out.

Arthur feels Burt's smiling face - and hating eyes - on him.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A VERY PRECISE FRENCH WAITER performs the specials menu with

ludicrous elan. Susan is rapt, taking it all very seriously.

Susan chuckles approvingly, knowingly, the twit. She coos

with delight and claps in appreciation.

The waiter leaves, despising Arthur.

A WINE WAITER slams a bowl and spoon next to Arthur. He pours

in champagne.

Arthur slurps his champagne.

Arthur sees a very frail, rich old woman dripping in

diamonds, passing by on her walking frame.

She stops herself.

Susan places her hand on Arthur's.

Arthur takes Susan's hand.

A waiter tops up Susan's wine. Arthur, now very drunk, holds

out his champagne bowl to be refilled.

The waiter arrives with Susan's fish and Arthur's drink.

Arthur sinks to his knees. Susan waits...and waits. Arthur

has passed out. Susan kicks him awake. He fumbles away in the

gloom, getting out the ring box and trying to get it on her

finger.

At table level, Susan waits, irritated.

Susan pulls her hand up, and gazes at the huge, glinting

diamond - pushed onto the end of her thumb.

She nods imperceptibly at the waiter.

Music starts. A congratulatory round of applause. Confetti is

thrown. The whole restaurant cheers. Susan whips out her

Blackberry and starts hitting keys.

Susan's phone rings.

Arthur's phone rings. The caller I.D reads `Vivienne'. He

kills the call and sits, horrified, as the entire restaurant

celebrates his grim fate.

INT. PIERRE HOTEL BASEMENT GARAGE - NIGHT - LATER

In the gloom we track past the crushed Batmobile, the

Delorean and other famous cars, to find Arthur sitting in

KITT from `Knight Rider'.

Arthur jumps out of his skin. But it's Hobson, standing by

the car holding a dressing gown and a mug of cocoa.

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT, QUEENS - NIGHT

A very old Apple Mac sits on a cluttered desk.

Ralph is in his chair, eating Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits,

watching CSI on an old TV with a tiny satellite dish on top.

Naomi comes in, looking absolutely beautiful. She checks her

hair in the mirror.

Ralph unplugs the dish. The picture improves.

On CSI, a female body is being unearthed.

She changes the channel to something else.

A beep from outside. She kisses him and leaves.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

Arthur's Bentley pulls up at a quiet part of Battery Park.

There's a huge ding in one side of the car.

INT. BENTLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Arthur and Naomi sit in the back of the car, while Marty

checks sports results on his pager.

Arthur's holding a blindfold.

She shrugs and puts on the blindfold.

EXT. NIGHT - LATER

Arthur guides Naomi in the dark. She stumbles.

She tries to pull her blindfold off.

Arthur removes her blindfold. She's stunned to find herself

on a huge blanket under a tree in a clearing lit by numerous

candles. Before them is spread the most amazing picnic of all

time. Flowers are everywhere. A log fire burns in a grate.

Soft music plays.

He pours them glasses of 1928 Krug.

He lifts a silver platter lid to reveal a vast pizza.

A crack of a twig from somewhere.

But there's nobody there. A cool breeze blows. Naomi shivers.

Arthur uses a remote to turn the log fire flames up.

Arthur lifts a grill lid to turn over succulent steaks.

Arthur shrugs and swigs champagne, pouring more.

She laughs. She stops laughing.

A sudden, very loud, very out-of-date ring tone. Naomi takes

out a huge ancient Motorola phone.

She ends the call.

Something weird is happening. The world wobbles imperceptibly

as the background drops away. She hasn't noticed yet.

A beat. She looks around. And down.

Cutting wide, we see that the picnic was taking place on a

grass covered platform with a tree planted in it - which is

being lifted off the ground by a crane!

The whole thing is rising higher and higher and higher.

He pulls back the blanket to reveal seat belts. He straps her

in.

A gust of wind blows the structure, which swings. Naomi

screams.

Naomi tastes it. It's clearly delicious. She gazes around as

the crane swings them out over the Hudson. The view of

Manhattan, of the river, of the Statue of Liberty, is mind

bogglingly gorgeous from up here.

Naomi bursts out laughing. She sips champagne.

Arthur feels a blade at his throat. He looks up to see A

JUNKIE, CLEARLY HIGH, standing over him.

Arthur hands him his phone and watch.

We see a sleeping bag and needles behind the tree!

Arthur get the giggles as the junkie reaches into his pocket

for his wallet. Naomi gets involuntary giggles too.

The junkie stuffs his face with food, swigs champagne from

the bottle, then walks away. Phew. Then...

The junkie's walking towards the edge, oblivious! Arthur

jumps up, causing the platform to wobble scarily. He grabs

the junkie's arm. The junkie swipes, cutting Arthur's hand.

The junkie hurries away again. He's about to walk off the

edge. Arthur runs and grabs him. They end up in a messy

struggle, the platform rocking badly.

Naomi's panicking, searching desperately. Arthur and the

junkie roll over the posh food, right to the edge!

Naomi finds the truffle station and hits the panic button.

Down in a Crane Cab an alarm goes off. The driver starts to

lower the platform.

Naomi tries to help Arthur as he struggles with the junkie,

but she gets slashed on the ear. She screams.

As the platform lowers, it swings back over the river to the

land and tips them all into the river!

INT. ARTHUR'S CAR - NIGHT

Naomi and Arthur - his face bruised - are sitting in the car,

both dripping wet. Naomi's ear and Arthur's hand are

bandaged.

She stares at him as if he's utterly crazy.

INT. ARTHUR'S PENTHOUSE - BALLROOM DAY

The room has started to fill with groom's paraphernalia -

morning suits, top hats, shoes. Erica is sitting with a huge

sheaf of wedding admin and brochures. Vivienne, Burt and

Susan listen attentively, studying seating plans. It all

feels more like a council of war than a wedding preparation.

ARTHUR'S lying on a chaise longue, hungover. A TAILOR

stretches a tape measure along him as if measuring a corpse.

Hobson brings Arthur a glass of water and two Nurofen.

Vivienne, irritated, hands Hobson a coffee cup.

The screen lights up with a church graphic.

A 3-d layout of the church appears on a laptop. In the mock

up, the bride's side of the aisle fills with hundreds of

computerised guests, many labelled with famous names.

About a fifth of that number pop up on Arthur's side.

Arthur groans and leans over a bowl.

Arthur's sick. Erica lays out more sheets.

Hobson reappears, wipes his mouth and takes the bowl. She

stands with it accidentally-on-purpose, very close to

Vivienne's nose.

Arthur gets up.

EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

Arthur is walking Naomi along the Hudson, this time in

daylight. He stops.

EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

The Hudson is bare of craft....until, suddenly, a bizarre

mini submarine shaped like a dolphin, dives out of the water

in an arc. Arthur and Naomi are laughing inside it - until

they almost collide with a Circle Tour boat full of tourists.

EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

Arthur and Naomi are hand in hand, walking along the street.

He's a bit drunk, wobbly on his feet, a little morose.

But Naomi sees something on the other side of the road.

Arthur gets a a text from Hobson: `TELL her!'

It's a big tacky shop: JACK'S 99 CENT STORE.

INT. 99 CENT STORE - NIGHT

`I'M TOO SEXY' BY RIGHT SAID FRED PLAYING LOUDLY ON SPEAKERS.

The space is huge, garish and piled high with countless cheap

household cleaners, candies, foodstuffs and toys. Arthur's

fascinated, a tourist in austerity.

Arthur reads a doll's label.

Arthur turns the doll over: a sticker reads `China'.

He gazes around in wonder.

She takes his arm.

Arthur holds a tin with a Coffee Mate-style logo, reading

`Friend of Coffee'.

The store music changes to RICKY MARTIN: `LIVIN' LA VIDA

They pass AN OLD WOMAN who is going through a stack of

identical tins of cheap beans.

Arthur just stares at Naomi.

A CRASH. The old woman has knocked over all the beans.

He hands her a tin.

She stares and thinks. Arthur puts the tin to his ear.

Arthur shakes and sniffs another tin.

He slips her a dollar and whispers to her.

Naomi gazes at a different Arthur to the fool who nearly got

her killed.

She hurries away.

ANOTHER OLD COUPLE push a cart past. THE OLD WOMAN sneezes.

The old man produces a tissue and gently wipes her nose.

The music changes.

INT. HIGH END RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Arthur, Susan and Erica - her laptop open - are at dinner.

Hobson's salting Arthur's soup, then checking the

temperature.

She looks at Hobson.

Hobson leans into Arthur while tidying his napkin.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

Arthur's giving stunned Naomi a tour of the huge apartment.

He leads her out onto a second rooftop ballroom.

He grabs her in a ballroom dance move.

Arthur goes onto the balcony. Naomi's notices a figure

sitting in the dark, stifling a cough. Hobson.

Hobson fights another little cough. She gets up.

EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

The live version of Simon and Garfunkel's `The 59th Street

Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy') is playing on speakers. Arthur

and Naomi look out over the view, the park, dark and empty in

contrast to the cheering and clapping on the recording.

Naomi sips her wine. Arthur throws back a whisky.

Arthur wobbles a little more.

Naomi lays her head on Arthur's shoulder.

They might be about to kiss. But Arthur holds back.

INT. ARTHUR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Arthur's blissed out face, lying in bed in the soft light.

Hobson's reading `Frog and Toad' to Arthur.

Hobson closes the book and turns out the light.

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY

Naomi's sitting with Ralph, who's scratching off lottery

tickets.

EXT. SHOWJUMPING FIELD. DAY

A HORSE clears a showjumping barrier. Grant applauds.

Arthur's watching, sweating in the sunshine, while Marty and

Hobson wait in the Bentley.

Vivienne canters her horse up to them.

Arthur storms away towards the car.

Arthur jumps into the car and it pulls away. Vivienne sits

shocked on her horse. But then she throws it into a gallop

and catches up.

INT. DINER - DAY

Arthur's very drunk, maudlin, sitting opposite Naomi. He's

holding his menu upside down.

She slams her menu down.

Naomi gets up and puts on her coat.

He stops, his mouth flapping like a fish.

She heads towards the door. Arthur regains his lucidity for a

moment.

Naomi watches him take another big slug of wine.

Arthur looks confused.

She shakes her head and goes.

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Naomi's looking very sad, shaking - because she's comforting

Ralph, who is sobbing on her shoulder.

INT. DANE COOK CONCERT - NIGHT

Arthur sits miserable, drinking, as he sits beside Susan at a

Dane Cook gig.

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

Naomi's been crying. She's reading the screen of an ancient

Apple Mac: `THE BOY WHOSE HEART ESCAPED' by N J Snart. She

reads a paragraph - and smiles. This stuff isn't so bad.

INT. ARTHUR'S PENTHOUSE - BALLROOM - NIGHT.

Arthur and Susan are getting a dance lesson from a

CHOREOGRAPHER, clicking her fingers to a club anthem version

of the awful Jefferson Starship song. Arthur dances terribly.

Hobson watches sadly.

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

Naomi's typing, getting back into it.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

The tailor is positioning a top hat on Arthur's miserable

head. He's shirtless and unshaven.

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY

The sun is coming up over Queens.

An ancient dot matrix printer spits out a final page. Naomi

is at a desk with A PILE OF FINISHED MANUSCRIPTS and

envelopes to various publishers. One is to `Rainbow Press'.

EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

Naomi's pointing at the Chrysler Building for a particularly

grumpy bunch of tourists of all types and ages.

The opening bars of a familiar song start up somewhere,

filling the street. Suddenly, some of the members of her tour

group start lip syncing to Phil Collins.

A van with speakers on the top is parked nearby, pumping out

the music.

A Yellow Cab goes by, the driver lip-syncing out the window.

The song hits a hard club mix. Arthur bursts from the back of

the van in a frog outfit! The `tourists' launch into a well-

rehearsed dance.

The song builds to a dance crescendo.

A magical moment. The crowd watches. How can she say no?

He takes out his flask and has a swig.

INT. ARTHUR'S PENTHOUSE. SHOWER - NIGHT

Arthur's in his cuboid David Blaine shower. He picks up his

binoculars.

But Marty pipes up on the little inset Hobson screen. He

looks at a note in Hobson's handwriting.

INT. HOBSON'S ROOM. DAY

Hobson's in bed, watching a Discovery Channel documentary

about grizzly bears. Arthur hits pause.

Hobson closes her eyes. She hams the next bit.

She feigns a melodramatic death.

Arthur storms out, slamming the door. But within 10 seconds

he returns, humbled, ashamed - a regretful naughty child.

She pats his hand gently.

INT. CAR - DAY

Marty and Hobson are staring, bemused.

Arthur's wearing a huge, ludicrous wig and beard. Hobson and

Marty fight giggles.

He looks, scared, at the building.

INT. AA MEETING - DAY

AA MEMBERS are sitting in a circle. MEGAN, a respectable-

looking, smart woman, is speaking.

Arthur (in his ludicrous disguise), Hobson and Marty enter.

INT. AA MEETING - DAY - LATER

A man, JAMES, speaks emotionally.

Arthur - utterly depressed - has his head in his hands.

Marty chuckles. He tries to fist-bump James.

Arthur thinks. Seriousness - his least favourite thing - is

upon him. He takes a deep breath. But -

Arthur leaves, the door swinging behind him.

The woman confessing is Hobson - on Arthur's behalf!

Arthur, having heard, comes back in.

She's done. An awkward silence.

EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY

The car drives through Manhattan.

INT. CAR - DAY

Arthur stares out of the window, beaten, drunk.

Hobson doesn't even crack a smile. Arthur gets out his phone

and scrolls - past Naomi's name, to Susan's. He dials.

He ends the call. Silence. He looks to Hobson.

EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

Naomi's riding the bus. Her phone rings. `Number withheld'.

She rolls her eyes and answers.

Incredibly excited, she grabs a pen and writes on a walking

tours brochure: `JULIAN BARBER...RAINBOW PRESS...'

She writes `TUESDAY 11.30' and an address.

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - DAY

There's a ring at the doorbell. Ralph answers. It's Hobson.

Ralph embraces her.

Ralph releases her.

Naomi appears, looking more of a writer than a tour guide.

Ralph leaves.

Hobson picks up a letter from Rainbow Press and peruses it.

Hobson has a slight dizzy spell and sits down.

Ralph comes back and with a cup of disgusting-looking tea.

Ralph hands Hobson the cup of tea.

Ralph goes. Naomi takes the tea.

Hobson gets up, still dizzy.

But Hobson falls back into her chair heavily, looking sicker.

EXT. JOHNSON MANSION. NIGHT

HORDES OF SMARTLY-DRESSED RICH PEOPLE are gathering on Burt

Johnson's mansion for the society night of the year. A high-

level security presence is much in evidence.

INT. JOHNSON MANSION. BALLROOM - NIGHT

A LIVE BAND plays a cheesy soft-rock version of `Addicted to

Love'. ARISTOCRATS mingle with CRASS NEW MONEY TYPES mingle

with TIGER WOODS. The band finishes the song.

The band start playing again. Partygoers hit the dance floor.

Vivienne, Susan, Burt and Erica pass a huge ice statue of

Susan and Arthur in a loving embrace and amazing catering.

Erica shrugs modestly. Arthur appears. Burt puts a big burly

arm around him and squeezes him a little too hard.

EXT. JOHNSON MANSION. NIGHT

Naomi climbs out of a crappy cab. She's on her phone.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Hobson's in bed looking ill. Ralph's fussing over her pillow.

Hobson slaps him away.

But Naomi's gone. Ralph tries to plump the pillow again.

EXT. PARTY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Naomi hurries past A DOOR MAN with a clipboard.

Naomi grabs the arm of A MALE GUEST.

She hurries in with the bemused, but delighted man. The DOOR

MAN checks his clipboard.

INT. JOHNSON MANSION. NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Naomi enters the party, releasing the man, who's disappointed

to see her go. She looks around for Arthur, getting admiring

looks from other men - and women.

Naomi moves on. The Door Man appears, looking around for the

gatecrasher. The man whose arm she took on the way in - he's

called JUSTIN - is also on the prowl for her...

INT. JOHNSON MANSION. BALLROOM - NIGHT

Burt takes to the stage to applause.

Arthur takes the stage to wild applause.

The band starts playing `Close To You' by the Carpenters.

Arthur sings to Susan, down in the crowd.

The audience laugh.

INT. JOHNSON MANSION - ANOTHER LARGE ROOM

JUSTIN approaches Naomi, who's still looking around for

Arthur.

Justin takes Naomi's arm and leads her at a leisurely pace.

They pass a portrait of Susan.

Justin points at a portrait of Susan.

The Door Man appears, seeing Naomi.

They walk through a door, ending up in a garden.

EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT

Naomi turns to A WOMAN.

Naomi hurries away - running straight into the Door Man.

They tussle. Arthur intercedes.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

A MAN IN A WHITE COAT is on the phone beside Hobson's bed.

Hobson snatches the phone from the Man in a White Coat.

INT. JOHNSON MANSION - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

Arthur's on the phone, coat on, in a big empty panelled room.

The call ends. Arthur looks across at Naomi, at the other end

of the room, looking so beautiful.

No laughter this time. It's not funny. He takes out his

iPhone again. Stares at it.

Arthur's busted. He scrolls the phone for a cab number.

Naomi looks up at a portrait of Burt and young, prissy, but

beautiful Susan.

Arthur sees a sound system. He goes over and plugs his iPhone

into it, then takes Naomi in his arms.

Arthur looks down into her eyes and hits `PLAY' on his

iPhone. Music starts: it's not a slow, smoochy song but big,

brassy and upbeat.

MUSIC: `NELLIE THE ELEPHANT' BY MANDY MILLER

Arthur ballroom dances Naomi at speed around the room.

It's energetic, wonderful, as romantic as any slow dance.

They stop dancing. Arthur stares at Naomi. At last, they

kiss. But the music stops. It's Vivienne.

Arthur suddenly goes pale.

Vivienne leaves. Naomi storms away. Arthur chases.

Arthur looks incredibly hurt.

Naomi gets her old phone out. She speaks into it.

A door opens.

Naomi walks away, slamming a door behind her.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Hobson is lying in bed, looking even iller than before.

The door opens. Marty enters with a shopping cart.

Arthur starts to produce gifts for Hobson: jewellery,

expensive bath products, perfumes, clothes, a DVD...

He produces a DARTH VADER HELMET.

She dons the full face helmet.

Arthur and Marty laugh.

Finally, Arthur unwraps a very high-end DVD player and TV.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark. Arthur, Hobson and Marty are all on the

bed, bathed in blue light from the huge new TV.

It's a documentary about grizzly bears.

A DOCTOR enters.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Arthur's looking delighted. But the doctor is grave.

INT/EXT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. HOBSON'S ROOM - NIGHT

We see a short montage of Arthur, now sober, taking care of

Hobson with Marty's help: Reading to her...Watching another

bear documentary...Arthur doing silly yoga for Hobson...

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. HOBSON'S ROOM - NIGHT

Arthur is quietly cleaning Hobson's room. He stumbles on a

document. It reads: `THE BOY WHOSE HEART ESCAPED' BY N J

SNART. FINAL MANUSCRIPT.' He opens it.

Arthur's reading the manuscript, bearing Hobson's notations:

`Shorten', `Wonderful - do NOT cut!', `Beautiful. I cried'.

He taps the top of a state-of-the-art heart monitor.

Hobson takes Arthur's hand.

She glances at a MASSIVE PILE OF BEAR DOCUMENTARY DVDs beside

THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TEDDY BEAR.

Arthur can't fight the tears any more.

INT. HOBSON'S ROOM - NIGHT

Arthur, in a chair at the end of the bed, wakes with a start

from a dream. He looks across to Hobson, who is very still.

The expensive monitor is dead. He jumps up.

He sees that the monitor is unplugged. The cord is in

Hobson's hand. It's over. Hobson's dead.

Arthur sobs his heart out.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's a few weeks later. The place is very, very messy. The

place also seems to be heavily splattered with all colors of

paint.

SPLOTCH! A big lump of red paint thuds into Hobson's giant

teddy bear, which is already heavily spattered.

Arthur's sitting naked, apart from a helmet, in his tiny army

paintball tank. He's in a blank, drunken daze, firing paint

at the teddy. The tank turret rotates. He shoots walls,

possessions, furniture. He stops.

He looks down at an ashes urn.

He's rewarded with a face full of ashes. Angrily he spins the

turret through 360 degrees, firing paint.

Marty comes in - and is hit hard by paint.

Marty goes. Arthur picks up his phone and scrolls down to

Naomi's name. He thinks for a moment, hits `call'.

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY - CONTINUOUS

Naomi is shopping. She looks at the phone, sees Arthur's

name. She so wants to answer. But doesn't.

far below.

The body falls past a window. A huge crash from off.

caved in, the DRIVER shaking in shock.

Tilt up to find Hobson's HUGE teddy BEAR lying on the roof.

EXT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. BALCONY - DAY

Arthur's on his phone again.

The doorbell rings from off.

He throws the cellphone off the roof. A couple of seconds

pass. We hear a very faint howl of pain from whoever it hit.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Arthur opens the door. It's Vivienne.

She bustles in past Arthur. A PLATOON OF MAIDS follows.

He guides her out the door.

He slams the door. The phone rings again.

INT. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Arthur is sitting in an estate attorney's next to MR FINKE,

a small, dirty man. ATTORNEY MARGARET AHERNE is at a desk

opposite them, reading from a will.

Aherne hands Mr Finke A CHECK for $8,864.

Aherne opens a tiny envelope.

She produces a teabag.

INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY

Close up on the KETTLE, steam issuing forth from the spout.

Then a MUG with the teabag in it. The kettle boils. A hand

pours hot water into the mug. Milk is added. And a drop of

vodka.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

Burt and Vivienne are standing outside, greeting GUESTS.

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY

Arthur is stalking - drunk but determined - through the

crowds. He comes upon a group of tourists standing by a tour

bus. Naomi's now wearing a headset mic, pointing south.

Arthur pushes his way through the tourists. He sees her bus

and headset.

Naomi looks unconvinced. Arthur pulls out his wallet and

takes out a load of credit cards.

He drops it down a drain. He produces another card.

Drops it down drain too. The tourists are enjoying this.

This last one he hands to a PASSING HOMELESS MAN.

The man runs into the road. As Arthur talks, out of focus we

see the man hit by a car, but get up and keep going.

He tosses it over his shoulder. It lands in the beef juice

pan of a Street French Dip stall. A BIGGER CROWD is

gathering. Arthur takes off his jacket.

He throws the jacket in a passing cab's window. He takes off

his pants.

He hands the trousers to a PASSERBY. Off with his watch!

Arthur flings it in the air. A crazed fight breaks out.

Arthur stands before Naomi in just his underpants and socks.

They step away from the tourists.

Naomi hands Arthur her phone.

Naomi starts herding her tourists onto her bus.

She sits in the driving seat and belts up.

The bus door shuts. Naomi drives away.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

Arthur stops, out of breath. He sees A LINE OF STREET

ENTERTAINERS. That gives him an idea.

Arthur strikes a sequence of silly poses and names.

TOURISTS throw money. Arthur grabs it up. He looks up at the

Times Square digital clock: 11:56.

A taxi stops. Arthur throws the money to THE DRIVER.

Arthur jumps in. The cab screeches away.

EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - DAY

The cab halts. Arthur jumps out and starts running again. He

sees A BUS with `COLUMBUS CIRCLE' in its window.

We cut to people cheering Arthur, hanging on the bus's front

bicycle rack. But the DRIVER sees him and hits the brakes.

Arthur's flung forwards but gets up and keeps running.

He sees a Subway Station.

Arthur runs down the steps.

INT. SUBWAY - DAY

Naomi's driving her bus up 42nd Street.

A few grudging laughs from the tourists.

Other tourists agree.

EXT. STREET. DAY

Arthur comes bounding out of another station. Clutching his

dollar, he sees a bus. He runs aboard, and up to the driver.

Arthur feels eyes on him. The bus is full of SCHOOL CHILDREN!

It's a school bus! They all stare for a beat, then get out

cellphones to report the weirdo in their midst, who runs off

again and up Broadway, passing a store's line of shopping

carts. He starts emptying them of quarters.

A police car rounds the corner.

Arthur jumps in a shopping cart; as the truck passes, he

launches forward, grabbing the rear fender!

INT. CHURCH - DAY

Burt gets up, squeezing past TIGER WOODS.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

The church is packed with THE GREAT, GOOD, RICH AND FAMOUS.

Vivienne sits waiting. Arthur stumbles in at the back.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

up to Jesus, in similar scantily-clad appearance, on a cross.

Arthur slips in a side door.

INT. SACRISTY - DAY

Susan is sitting, sad, Bridesmaids comforting her.

Arthur pushes past Erica.

INT. CHURCH. ALTAR - NIGHT

taps a mic from the pulpit like a stand up.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

Naomi's tour bus screeches up. She hurries out.

SINT. CHURCH - DAY

Arthur's still before the congregation, telling a story.

The hateful silence that only 500 angry rich people can

muster.

Naomi creeps in at the back.

TIGER WOODS discreetly scribbles `99c Store, chops' on a torn-

out Bible page.

A huge crucifix strikes Arthur hard. Burt, crazed with

hatred, drags him by his hair off the altar.

INT. CHURCH. SACRISTY. DAY - CONTINUOUS

Burt is bashing Arthur's head HARD against a stone font.

Vivienne bursts in. Followed by Naomi.

But nothing's going to stop Burt.

Erica leaps on Burt, pummelling his face with her fists.

Arthur looks up at Susan.

Erica stops. Susan kisses her.

Naomi give Arthur a look.

He kisses Naomi passionately.

Vivienne walks up to the altar.

small, old, alone.

is: `...the 1765 Irish Hair Famine swept through Manhattan,

rendering every resident bald for a week.'

INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. SHOWER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Arthur's struggling with a very crap, piddly shower. Rather

than the glory of Manhattan from his shower-in-the-sky,
