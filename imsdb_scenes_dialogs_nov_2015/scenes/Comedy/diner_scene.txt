The SCREEN IS BLACK. We hear MUFFLED ROCK and ROLL

MUSIC. Then we read:

FADE OUT.

INT. DANCE HALL BASEMENT - NIGHT

FENWICK walks along the dimly lit basement. Heavy wiatei

coats hang from hooks on the wall. In the b.g., there

is constant traffic of pecple coming and going from the

rest rooms. From above we hear the MUFFLED SOtJV OF THE

ROCK AND ROLL BAND.

Fenwick is in his early 20s and dressed in the "JOE

COLLEGE." style of the late fifties. Sports jacket, button-

down shirt, chino pants, and Bass weejuns. We sense

that he is a little lost in himself, confused. He looks

out one of the windows that views the parking lot. Then

without any outward anger, he punches his fist through a

window pane. Seconds later he breaks another window with

his fist.

Fenwick, picking up the music beat from above, struts to

the sound as he approaches another bank of windows. He

calmly breaks another window pane with. his fist.

A GUY coming out of the bathroom in the b.g . sees Fenwick's

actions and then heads up the steps.

INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

The crowd is gathered around the bandstand listening to

the local group, the SH K RS, playing their popular hit

HOT NUTS. The song is played toward the end of the even-

ing because of its risque Lyrics.

Hot nuts, hot nuts, get from

the peanut man.

way you can.

As the crowd swings the verse back to the Band Leader.

The Guy who spotted Fenwick breaking windows approaches

BOOGIE. Boogie is something of a "Dandy," flashiar

in dress than others in his crowd. Although he isn't

particularly good looking there is something about his

attitude that is very appealing to girls. Boogie

aster hearing the Guy heads downstairs.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Fenwick casually breaks another window with his fist.

His hand is bleeding. Boogie approaches.

What's up, Fen?

Just breaking windows, Boog

BOOGIE. -

What for?

It's a smile.

He breaks another window with his fist.

C' mon, don't be a sWuck.

FENWICK

I know that glass is made from

sand, but how come you can see

through it?

He breaks another window. Boogie grabs him.

Leave the windows alone. What's

the matter with you?

It's a smile, that's all.

I'm cracking up.

I'm warning. you, Fen, break another

window and you're gonna get a fat lip.

He lets Fenwick go.

Where's your date?

FENWICK

Gave her away.

What?

Gave her away. David Glazer said

she was death.. So, I said if you

like the way she looks, take her.

What are you, the Salvation Any?

FENWICK

Charged him five bucks.

C'mcn, upstairs.

(as Ferwick just

stares at him)

C'mon .

They walk away

Ycu really are nuts, you know that?

Me? What about her? She didn't

have to go. I'm nuts. Get that.

That's what you get from dating

eleventh graders. Brains aren't

developed.

FENW I CK

But her tits were.

Falsies. --.-

They were?

Shit, then what as .1 pissed about?

They disappear up the, steps.

INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT (SLIGHTLY LATER)

The band is on a break. A FRANK SINATRA RECORD is PLAYING.

CAP_7RA PANS TO EDDIE who is in a corner with one foot up

on a chair. He smokes a cigarette and taps his foot _

lightly to the music. Eddie takes Sinatra very seriously.

ShBEVI ; approaches Eddie.

Where's Elyse?

Talking with your wife about the

fucking wedding plans.

Gettin' cold feet?

They've never been warn.

Boogie is talking with DLANE, the young eleventh grader

that Fenwick had the falling out with. She is an

attractive petite girl with large breasts.

How can you take Glazer over the

Fen?

r4' BOOGIE

Diane, did you know that Glazer

bought you for five bucks? That's

the kinda guy he is.

He did?

Do you want to leave with Glazer?

Not really, but Fe^.wzck scares me.

Why don't you take- me home?

Diane, I'm in law school at night,

I have to go home and study. I

just stopped by here, 'cause I

appreciate fine music.

I thought you worked in a beauty

parlor.

I do during the day. -

(he puts his hand

up and strokes her

Diane, go with Fen. For me, okay?

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Fen-.sick's

is telling her scnething and she laughs

Boogie and MODE; t, follow. Behind them, Shrevie and his

wife BETh follow in a 1950 Hudson Hornet.

Fenwick floors his car and disappears around a bend.

The other cars do not keep pace'.

INT. SHREVIE' S CAR

Elyse feels that Eddie is getting

very sensitive about the wedding.

I k:_ow. We were talking about it.

She thinks that since he never talked

it over with Billy beforehand, it kind

of bothers him even more.

The closest of the close. You t-_.ow

Billy's flying in this morning?

I didn't hear about it. Thought

he was just coming in for the

wedding day.

We didn't want to mention it.

Surprise for Eddie.

Shrevie's car follows in the taillights of Boogie's car.

Fenwick's car is nowhere in sight.

Elyse's mother is very upset with

Eddie. They picked out a yellow

and white motif for the wedding.

You know, like we did, tablecloth,

napkins, maids-,of-honor. Anyway,

Eddie objected. He wanted blue and

white because that's The Colts'

colors. Refused to give in.

Yeah, so?

Well, you know how stubborn Eddie

is .

Could be worse. It could be black

and gold. Steelers' colors.

Shrevie notices Boogie's taillights come or.. He slows

down. Something is wrong up ahead.

f EXT. ?.CADSIDE - NIGHT

Fenwick's car is turned over. The headlights of the car

shine brightly against a tree.

CCNTINLt.D :

--_S.t's. ficult to see exactly what has happeried.Jn the

darkness of the road. Boogie, Modell, Shrevie and Beta

exit the cars and walk toward the accident.

As they approach we see Fe_zwick lying halfway out of the

car covered in blood. Diane cannot be seen.

Stay here.

The three guys move apprehensively toward the car. Fenwick's

face is covered in'blood, so touch so that it-can hardly be

.recognized.

(-,?eac ting to the

sight of Fenwick's

Oh Jesus.

Boogie kaeels nest to Fenwick. -After a beat,. Fenwick

explodes with laughter.

You son-cf-a-bitch !

Fenwick screams in laughter.

You asshole!

Then Boogie laughs. The rest of the guys join in. Not

Bech. She is not acused. Fenwick crawls cut of the

Triumph.

He pulls away.

See you guys later at the dine=.

Exi . -DINER - NIGHT

The diner is one of the typical late S0's metal and glass

structures. Almost deco in design. Cars are parked in

front, including Shrevie's Hudson Hornet. CAXR4 PANS

to a car parked over in a corner.

TABACX has his truck open, filled with pants. A few guys

are going through the goods as Taback tries to wheel-and-

deal.

(to one of the guys)

Seven bucks. All wool. You can't

beat it.

h T e GUY holds it up.

The crotch looks too short. Don't

ca--e for that.

What are you afraid it's gonna got

The other guys "Whoco" in reaction to Taback's put-down.

You sure are hot shi . since you've

He throws the pants back and walks away,

INi . DINER - NIGHT

The diner is the late-night hangout... made up of a mixed

bag crowd. Around one side, the aluinun siding SALE'S?. N

guys in their 30s and 40s. Some HIGH SCHOOL ERS , only

there on the waekends, and the, Boogie-S?irevie c_cwd. (The

guys in their early t,?enties .) One thing is quite

apparent. There are no girls present, except WAIT=S.SSES.

T h at is the unspoken rule. NO DATES.

Eddie, Shrevie and Modell sit in a booth. They all eat

french fries and gravy.

You can't compare Mathis to

Sinatra. No way.

They're both great singers.

Yeah, but you can't compare them.

Sinatra is the lord. He's big in

movies, everything.

If Mathis wasn't a blue, he'd be

a big movie star.

That's true. There's hardly any

blues in movies. Just sidekicks.

C'mon, they could've put Mathis in

'From Here to Eternity.' They had

blues in the war.

Mathis didn't come around until after

that movie.

Are you telling me Mathis could've

played Maggio? Is that what I'm

hearing?

Who do you make-out to? Sinatra

or Mathis?

For that, Mathis.

I'm married. We don't Wake-cut.

They laugh. -

Fern wick enters and heads toward the guys' booth.-

passes the -Waitress .

a cherry coke.

He sits dcw-n and joins the guys.

Kidding. Said she wanted to see

Fenwick nods. He sticks out his pinky. Eddie gabs it

with his pinky. Therefore it's the truth.

ANGLE ON THE ALUMINUM SIDING GUYS' BOOTH

BAGEL is holding court with his guys.

The guy's canvassing the neighborhood,

and I notice he's stopping at the

brick houses. He's trying to sell

aluminun siding to the brick house

owners.

Sure enough, he comes back to the

car. He's got a lead. Fools rush

in, right?

To the guys, this type of story is fascinating. 3cbgie

comes cut o f the rest roam in the b . g . As he starts to

pass Bagel stops him.

Boog, come here.

Boogie approaches.

You lay down a bet with Barnett?

CON I? ?i D :

and forgets.

Okay, so? What's the point, Bagel?

Where you getting C40 thousand?

You haven't got a pot to piss in.

Game's a lock.

Nothing's a lock. You want me to

call it off? As a favor to your

father, may he rest in peace.

Bagel, get in. Trust me.

Boogie Walks off. - -

Kids today. Nobody's interested

in making an honest buck.

Heard he wants to be a lawyer.

That's what I'm saying. You call

that an honest buck?

Boogie approaches the guys and sits do

Bagel heard about my basketball

bet.

I'm down for fifty.

Woo, biz spender. I'm telling you.

They're shaving points on the game.

This is no bullshit tip. Get in,

guys.

I'll think about it. Listen, who

do you pick? Sinatra or Mathis?

Did I tell you guys I'm taking out

Carol Heatrow tomorrow night?

You're taking out Carol Heatrow?

No, you're taking her out.

She is death.

Only go for the best.

What's the bet she goes for my

A moveable stairway is put in place. Seconds later the

in the cold night air. BILLY HALPERT steps forward into

typical button-down shirt, crew neck sweater, chino pants,

I'm a good judge of human nature.

EXT. HILLTOP DI`HrR - NIGr'.T

The Hudson is parked out front. The morning light is just

beginning to break. THROUGH iZ WINDOW we can see the

a good time. Shrevie takes a sip of coffee. Billy says

something and Shrevie puts his hand to his mouth. Coffee

pours through his fingers and down his chin.

-It would be worth it.

EXT. SHREVI AND BETH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bowie's car is culled over. -Beth's door is openand she

stands on the curb talking to Boogie inside the car.

What are you going to do about

and a saxophonist drones away,- A few sailors and some

other customers sit at cables around the stage area. All

t h e tables have wooden =a? lets . When the Stripper does

something they especially like they pound the table with

tr.Le mallets.

Billy and Eddie both have beers and chasers in front of

then. Billy sips the chaser and his body actually shakes

from it for a few seconds.

There is no reason to actually

like this, you know that.

An acquired taste

No matter-how long -I drink- whiskey

I still don't like it.

He takes another sip, and once again shakes. Then he sips

the beer.

Now beer's another story.

91.

Eccie watches t::e Stri pa= zn owing a few bps an g in s.

You know something?

What?

I don't Iike strippers. I mean,

so they show a little here and

there. So what? But, give me

a coc. rle of ranoosas in a pink

sweater.., look out?

Remember the first time we became

aware of breasts on girls?

Arlene Stowe.

Showed up for the new school year

and there they were.

Seventh grade.

We gave little Joel Cher--I a nickel

-apiece to find cut is they were

real. Told him to be slnbcle. He

walked over, reached uc and grabbed.

T::rned to us and yelled, 'They're

real!'

The whole thing with girls is

painfu?. And it keeps getting

acre painful... instead of easier.

Billy downs his beer and orders tT,o more.

Remember 'copping a feel'? Boogie

was the first. Said it was great.

So, when I tcck out Ruth Ray I

figured I had to do it.

Ruth Ray, eighth grade.

Right. Sat on the couch in her

club cellar for hours, trying to

figure out a way to get my arm

arc:,tzid her. Finally, I learned

the 'move.' I yawned and put my

arm around her shoulder.

He demonstrates on Eddie.-

Then came the big task of getting

my hand down to her-breast. By

the time I worked un the nerve

to move down, I realized my arm

was asleep. Figured out there

wasn't enough time to take it back,

ge6 the feeling again, acid start

over. Had to be in by eleven.

Time was running out. So, I move

toward- the breast -with my arm - -----

asleep. My first copping a feel

was like this. -

He bangs his limp arm against Eddie's chest. He bps it

again.

Next time I saw the guys they

said, 'Did you cop a feel?' I

said, 'Yeah.' 'How was it?'

'Great.'

Eddie laughs and Billy joins in.

---EXT. -DINER - NIGHT

Bocgie pulls into te diner parking lot. Fenwick and

Shrevie race over to the car. Boogie opens the door.

Bong, you should get outta here.

Tank's Inside.

Boogie gets out of the car and slams the door shut. He

looks coward the diner and thinks a moment.

S HR VIE

tiny Con ycu wait until he splits?

He'll just keep looking for me.

He starts toward the diner.

Hand's dealt. Might as well

play the cards.

The guys hang behind? Boogie continufts on. Inside the

diner we see Tank moving along the aisle toward the door,

Boogie heads for the door. Just as he reaches it, Tank

steps outside. -

Tank. --

That so.

Yeah. The Bagel just raid off

your debt.

Boogie looks at him, trying to size up the situation.

Wcnderirg if he's r=ning a nurbey for scale reason.

B COG I E

We're even? Straight?

T'hat's the story.

Tank starts past Boogie.

Tank tu :s. Boogie slams his fist into his stcWach. Tank

drops to one knee in pain.

94.

I still owed you that.

He enters the diner. Fenwick and Shrevie are amazed by

what just happened.

INT. DINER - NIGHT

Boogia approaches Bagel wL_o sits at a booth alone. He

Thanks, Bagel.

Your mother called. She was

frantic. So, out of respect for

your -f at:.er. - - -

He sips his coffee. Then h,.i picks up a toasted bagel and

butters it.

Your mother feels you're just

wasting your t4---e in law school

it's not for you.

Probably right.

Ccee to work for me. There's a

lot of money to be made in the

home improvement business. You'd

be very good at it.

Boogie thinks about it. Bagel chews on his bagel.

Well, I was only really using law

as a come=on for the girls. They

like that. But, what the hell.

I can always lie.

The waitress passes..

95.

Enid, some french fries and gravy.

Call the two thousand an advance.

I'll work for you... for awhile.

Then, I'll have to move on to

bigger things.

,.BAGEL

Always a dreamer, eh, Boog?

If you don't have good dreams,

Bagel, you've got nightmares.

He flashes him a smile.

tNT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

Billy and' Eddie are still dri^king at the bar. They are

not drunk, just ve-cy happy.

I'll tell you one chinz that

happens when you get mcrried.

You have to give up your old

friends.

Billy listens to the music, slapping his thighs, crying be

idle wi Fe wants you to get new

friends. 'Cause me and you have

secrets she'll never know. And

new friends can never be as good,

'cause we've got a history.

It won't change, only if we let

it.

Billy keeps ,slapping his thighs, but the dr.:mmer and the

saxophonist continue on, unaware of Billy's private urgings.

C0N.II'LcD :

f nti- Yirg?

This is getting me crazy.

Billy goes toward the small stage.

BILLY (O.S.)

Come on, guyst Pick up the beat!

They don't respond. Eddie sits at the bar amused. Billy

claps his hands to a strong rhythm, but of course, the

guys pay no attention.

Billy goes up on the stage and pulls a cover off a small

piano in the corner. He sits down and runs his fingers

down the keyboard, then starts to play. It bas a nice,

pleasant sound to it. The dr er and the saxophonist

stop, not knowing what to do. The Stripper also stops.

The club bouncer at the front door turns toward the stage,

notices something is wrong and makes his way forward.

Billy's "piano playing becomes more intense. Stronger. He

drives the keys hard. Full tilt rock ane roll. The sound

becomes infectious. The sailors and other customers pick

up the beat. One after another they start to pound the

tables with the wooden mallets.

Eddie moves toward the stage banging empty beer battles

together .

The saxophonist joins Billy. Then the dry--?e,. The

Stripper stands by the side of the stage watching. The

music builds.

Billy's fingers pound the piano. Eddie jL ps up on the

stage and starts dancing around. He grabs the Stripper

and they jitterbug.

The sailors and other customers are cn their feet, banging

.the mallets Cr. the tables for all they are worth. A room

full of dr-=..e,s. The Lemon heightens.

Billy kicks back the stool a la Jerry Lee Lewis. The crowd

cheers. The bouncer cheers along.

The saxophonist struts the stage playing his heart out.

The dr'er drives the bass dr.:.m with his foot. His hands

sweep back and forth across the skins.

Eddie's feet are flying. Enthusiasm over grace. The Scrip

per is a whirlwind of motion and sexuality. The tempo is

fierce.

Eddie laughs. He enjoys the put-down.

_..._

You're all right.

You guys have made my night. You

more often.

Billy looks- at him. - Eddie smiles.

(COii T INLTED)

Figured she would have gotten the

Alan Aaeche question that Shrevie

screwed up.

Benefit of the doubt.

Exactly.

I love weddings. Just never found

the time to settle... or wanted to.

And you?

No marriage.

Got a girl?

Not really. Just in love.

Does the girl know?

Yeah, I told her about it.

Billy thinks about that as they enter an all-ciaht cootee

Boogie rides after Ann. Although he is not a goad rider,

he pushes to pick up ground.. Finally, he pulls alongside.

Ann slows her horse and Boogie does the same.

Nice morning.

Yes, it is.

Mornings I've always felt are a

Boogie looks her in the eye and flashes his smile.

INT. BANQUET HALL - WEDDING ROOM - NIGHT

The "Wedding Rcom" has been elaborately decorated. Potted

blue and white flowers in stands line the aisle to the blue

and white flower-d altar. The room is a festival of blue.

and white.

The guests sit in fold;.ng chairs eagerly waiting for, the

wedding procession to begin.

The MUSIC BEGINS. However, it is not the traditional

wedding math but rather the Baltimore Colts'Fight Song.

Even though the organist has softened it, there is still

_a _"rah-rah" quality to it. The flower girl comes down the---

aisle throwing white flowers on the blue aisle.

Modell with his GIRLFRIEND.

What is that music?

Colt Marching Song. Sounds good,

huh?

The ushers come for4ar3. Boogie and Fenwick, followed by

Shrevie, who walks alone. They are all smartly dressed

in black tuxedos.

The bridesmaids come forward. Beth and another girl. Fol-

lowed by tao more girls. Followed by two more girls.

Billy and Eddie start down- the aisle. Behind them is

Eddie's Mother and Father. They walk on either side of

his grandmother.

The COLT ING SONG CONTINUES ON.

Eddie sees someone sitting one seat in from the aisle. He

whispers to Billy.

Moon Shaw? Where?

CONT ?NUZD :

As they start to -pass, Billy leans into the row and grabs

Moon Shaw by the shirt. He pulls back his fist. Jxoor is-

shocked. -

Hi, Moon.

He smiles, lets him go and rejoins Eddie, having missed

only a few steps. No one is quite sure what has happened.

Quickly the attention is back to the wedding procession.

He said not to worry. The job

That was nice of him.

So, I'll work and care for the

who want to think badly of me.

That's not going to be easy.

The baby is ours, Billy. We can

both celebrate that. You can

love him just as much, spend time

with him or her.

Boogie and Ann pass then Boogie kisses Ann lightly on

the cheek.

You know what I realized just

yesterday? I've been intimidated

by you. I always liked you because

you were strong, independent, and

all. But I've been intimidated

by that as well. I've always held

-.back with you.- When we kissed, I

held back. The same when we made

Luve in New York. I keep thinking

I have to be special, like normal

passion wasn't proper... as if it

were just too ordinary and we were

beyond that.

Barbara pulls away from him slightly so she can see his

face. There's a sad look in his eyes.

If that's the case,

think that's a hard thing to

She kisses him, they hold each other tightly,

We've got plenty of time to find
