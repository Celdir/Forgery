FADE IN:

EXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNING

A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting

for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate.

A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past,

SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at

her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all

about.

Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD

CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a

little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.

Lloyd checks out her body.

The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away.

He SIGHS and zips the window back up.

INT. LIMO

Lloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front

seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives

away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER!

The dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE:

Lloyd grabs his CB mike.

EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY

This building is white with black spots on it, like a

DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a

DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.

The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs

hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout

on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.

HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in

a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY

EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm

of DOGS pile out.

The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR.

PALMER, sticks his head out.

Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but

they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from

wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits

them on a wall.

As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall

isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away,

taking the two dogs with it.

Harry chases after the vehicle.

EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY

Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined

driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE

STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the

front oor and RINGS THE BELL.

The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON

appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when

he lays eyes on her.

As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of

Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind

his ears...

INT. LIMO - DAY

Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the

window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on

her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps

glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he

is speechless. Then:

Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another

glance.

ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate

to impress her.

Lloyd realizes she has a point.

To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks

at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's

concerned about something.

Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.

Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.

EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk

and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she

reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.

For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This

makes her more lovely than ever.

Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,

followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,

ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.

Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo,  LOVESICK. For a

moment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key. He

just drops his head against the steering  wheel, DEVASTATED.

There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks  up to see a POLICE

OFFICER standing there.

Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of

travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are

focused straight ahead.

She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in

an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport

window and SEES MARY

WALKING ALONG.

When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.

She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for

her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He

turns to see a car irectly behind him.

When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees

that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF

THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.

He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He

starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police

Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and

dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL

The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to

approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching

for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP

THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at

each other, dumbstruck.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE

Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post

the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion

of numbers.

QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he

watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who

FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk

when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

HIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervision

of the Police Officer.

He takes off after it, but to no avail.

As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his

fingers through his hair.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON

We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A

dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up

and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's

briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building.

They disappear inside without acknowledging each other.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up

and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat.

They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE

MENTAL).

Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them.

INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR

Lloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently

toward the door of their apartment.

INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

Lloyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they

both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still

has the briefcase in his   lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY,

tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY.

The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The

carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a

miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt

and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture

with stuffing spilling out of the gashes.

Lloyd shakes his head.

Lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one

to him.

They open their beers and drink simultaneously. Then Harry

notices the briefcase.

They take another sip of their beers. Suddenly we hear a

LOUD KNOCK at the door. Petey the parakeet starts to SQUAWK.

The guys look at each other, ALARMED, then Harry tip-toes to

the

PEEPHOLE.

HARRY'S POV - a DISTORTED-LOOKING J.P. Shay and Joe Mental

are standing at the door.

Harry is still squinting out the peephole.

Lloyd GRABS THE BRIEFCASE and the two of them EXIT out the

window and down the fire escape.

EXT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - AFTERNOON

The poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building

and PARKS NEXT TO A FIRE HYDRANT. Lloyd and Harry climb out.

Lloyd takes a trash can and places it OVER THE

HYDRANT, COVERING IT COMPLETELY.

INT. STANLEY GRABNER'S OFFICE - UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE -

AFTERNOON

STANLEY GRABNER is small, plump, balding, not a lot of laughs.

GET YOU BOTH PRIME JOBS. TWELVE-

fifty an hour, and you went and blew it!

Grabner falls back in his chair, exhausted.

Grabner jumps up.

INT. HARRY & LLOYD'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

J.P. Shay is looking through Harry and Lloyd's kitchen

cupboards as Joe Mental comes out of the bedroom.

Joe Mental ominously approaches Petey the parakeet's cage.

Mental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around

the bird, who SCREECHES IN

TERROR.

Mental smiles, and as we PAN to J.P. Shay, we hear a bone-

chilling O.S. SNAP and Petey the bird stops SQUAWKING.

The Mutt Cuts van pulls up to the curb. A depressed Lloyd

and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building

entrance.

Harry hands his friend some crumpled bills.

EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries.

He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and

removes a quarter.

He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes

that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper.

He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper,

and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET

STILL INSIDE.

Lloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks

his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN

struggles by using a WALKER.

Lloyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as

Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters.

Suddenly he stops in his tracks. The ELDERLY LADY, HER WALKER,

AND HIS GROCERIES ARE GONE. As he takes a closer look, he

sees that

SHE HAS TAKEN HIS WALLET ALSO.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT

A thoroughly beleaguered Lloyd is trudging empty-handed up

the steps to his apartment.

INT. LLOYD & HARRY'S APARTMENT

The door opens and Lloyd ENTERS. Harry is sitting on the

couch, looking almost comatose.

Harry drops his head and lets out a MOAN.

Lloyd looks touched by this.

Lloyd puts his hand on Harry's shoulder compassionately.

As Lloyd thinks about the unfairness of life, he grows upset.

LADIES...

Lloyd flops down in a chair.

Lloyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintry

cityscape.

There's a deadly SILENCE as they both think about this. Then

Harry tries to lighten the mood. He opens his arms wide.

Harry sees that Lloyd has a point. He stands and approaches

Petey's cage. His eyes fill with tears.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The Mutt Cutts van is going down the highway while Danny

Wilson's "Mary's Prayer" plays on the soundtrack. The van

drives past and we HOLD ON a sign that reads: "YOU ARE LEAVING

PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND. COME BACK SOON." VARIOUS OTHER

AERIAL

SHOTS of the car travelling down the road while the song

continues to play.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

Harry's behind the wheel and Lloyd's in the passenger seat.

The Animal's "We've Got to Get Out of This Place" is BLASTING

on the radio and the guys are SINGING ALONG:

Lloyd turns down the radio.

Harry reaches over and UNDOES HIS SEATBELT. Lloyd watches,

curious.

LLOYD THINKS ABOUT THIS. THEN:

Harry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back

on. Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio.

Lloyd looks out the window guiltily.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

At the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a

little blind boy, BILLY. He sits in a wheelchair playing

with a PARAKEET WHOSE HEAD IS SCOTCH-TAPED ON. He throws the

ead bird up, but it flops into his lap.

Joe Mental and J.P. Shay approach and climb the steps.

CLOSE ON A NOTE - taped to Harry and Lloyd's apartment door.

It reads: TO ALL OUR

LOVED ONES - PACKED UP AND DROVE TO ASPEN - HAVE A NICE LIFE -

LLOYD AND HARRY.

PULLBACK to reveal Joe Mental and J.P. Shay.

Mental takes out more ANTACID PILLS and starts to chew on

them.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A pissed-off Shay and Mental EXIT the building. Mental pops

more antacid pills into his mouth as they descend the stairs.

Little Billy is still tossing the lifeless parakeet into the

air.

Plop. Then Billy hears Shay and Mental on the steps and CALLS

OUT:

Mental picks up the bird, studies it, then angrily and WINGS

IT DOWN THE STREET as hard as he can.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - AFTERNOON

Harry is still driving while Lloyd studies a map spread out

before him.

Lloyd looks at his friend, incredulous.

Harry sticks out his hand.

As Harry SHAKES LLOYD'S HAND, Lloyd breaks into a BIG SMILE.

Harry immediately realizes he's been had.

EXT. TRUCK STOP CAFE - AFTERNOON

The Mutt Cutt van is sandwiched between mountainous tractor-

trailer trucks.

INT. TRUCK STOP CAFE

Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a booth, surrounded by tables

of tough-looking TRUCKERS. Harry oesn't look happy. A middle-

aged, no-nonsense WAITRESS approaches their table with a

couple of burgers and drinks. She puts them down in front of

the boys and starts to walk away.

UH, EXCUSE ME...

The Waitress reluctantly returns to the table.

The Waitress SIGHS and picks up the milk. Then she BLOWS

INTO THE STRAW, MIXING

THE DRINK.

The guys watch her stomp away.

LLOYD

FEELS GOOD TO MINGLE WITH THESE LAID-

back country-folk, don't it, Harry?

Harry wipes off his straw with a napkin. As he moves to put

it in the ashtray, he accidentally

KNOCKS OVER THE SALT SHAKER.

Harry shrugs, shakes some salt into his palm, and flings it

over his shoulder. Suddenly they hear a

YELP.

They turn and see a burly TRUCKER wiping salt out of his

eyes.

The huge Trucker stands and squints at Lloyd and Harry. He's

wearing a FOAM BASEBALL CAP that says: WINE 'EM, DINE 'EM,

SIXTY-NINE 'EM.

The Trucker GROWLS and approaches the table, egged on by his

equally burly FRIENDS.

Sea Bass glares down at Harry's hamburger.

At this, Sea Bass leans over and DROPS A BIG, BROWN WAD OF

TOBACCO SPIT ONTO

THE HAMBURGER.

Harry stares at the burger non-commitally.

Sea Bass picks up the burger and walks back to his table, to

the LAUGHTER of his friends.

EXT. TRUCK STOP CAFE - AFTERNOON

J.P. Shay is at the gas pump filling the black Cadillac while

Joe Mental stretches his legs. A large truck pulls away,

REVEALING THE PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN MUTT CUTTS VAN. Mental smiles

at this, and we

INT. TRUCK STOP CAFE

The Waitress drops the check on Lloyd and Harry's table and

STOMPS away. Harry studies the bill and SIGHS.

Lloyd stands and walks over to Sea Bass and his pals. A

nervous Harry trails after him.

Harry stares at Lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the

Truckers seem to like the idea.

Lloyd and Harry move away from the table toward the CASHIER.

Lloyd hands the Cashier their check.

He points across the room to Sea Bass and company. Sea Bass

NODS TO THE CASHIER AND GESTURES TO HIS TABLE, NOT WANTING

TO MISS OUT ON HIS FREE DRINK. The Cashier is convinced.

Harry smiles at this. He grabs a couple Beef Jerky's, a candy

bar, and a copy of The National Enquirer off the counter.

EXT. TRUCK STOP CAFE - AFTERNOON

The front door BURSTS OPEN and a red-faced Sea Bass STORMS

OUT, followed by his buddies, the Cashier, and the Waitress.

The Truckers jump in their rigs and RUMBLE AWAY   in the

OPPOSITE DIRECTION our boys are headed.

EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

The Mutt Cutts van breezes by.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - AFTERNOON

A jubilant Harry's driving and chewing on a mouthful of Beef

Jerky.

Harry checks his rear-view mirror nervously.

Lloyd SIGHS. He takes an EMPTY BEER BOTTLE from the back

seat and UNZIPS his fly. Suddenly we hear a PEEING SOUND.

Then:

Harry can BARELY HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL as he reaches way

in the back seat for an empty.

He hands Lloyd another empty and Lloyd quickly makes the

switch.

Before Harry knows it he's holding the full BOTTLE OF URINE.

EXT. HIGHWAY - LATE DAY

As the Mutt Cutts van travels down the highway, it passes a

STATE TROOPER on a motorcycle hidden in the bushes. The

Trooper takes off after them.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN

Harry is doing his best to steer while now holding FIVE FULL

BOTTLES AND Lloyd is still going at it in the passenger seat.

Just then they hear a LOUDSPEAKER:

They turn to see the POLICE MOTORCYCLE cruising right beside

then. Harry rolls down his window and CALLS OUT:

Harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at

the Trooper.

He rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled

Lloyd.

The Cop turns on his SIREN.

ROAD!

EXT. HIGHWAY - LATE DAY

The STATE TROOPER is walking up beside the stopped Mutt Cutts

van, staring at it with isapproval.

Harry hands him the papers.

He points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat

between them.

The officer smirks.

The Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He

inspects the beer label, then MOVES

THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS.

YOU WOULD, TOO...

Harry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins GULPING down

the piss. He pauses uncertainly and a SICK LOOK COMES OVER

HIS FACE. He takes a DEEP BREATH. Then:

The Mutt Cutts van is pulling back onto the highway while

the officer remains in the breakdown lane with his hands on

his knees.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The van is making steady progress through the dark night.

INT. MUTT CUTT VAN - NIGHT

Lloyd is driving now while Harry sleeps in the passenger

seat. The song, "Cut Flowers" by The Smithereens, starts to

play as Lloyd FANTASIZES about his future in Aspen.

LLOYD'S FANTASY:

Lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered

chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase. The sky is absurdly blue

and children are making a snowman on the lawn. It's all out

of a dream world. He KNOCKS on the door, tentatively. Mary

opens it. She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks

into the BIGGEST, SWEETEST SMILE he's ever seen. Then she

slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow...

Lloyd follows Mary down a hallway. As he trails after her,

she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances

over her shoulder at him.

CAMERA MOVES around a corner and now we're in a STEAMY

BATHROOM. The shower is running and we see the silhouette of

two people behind the curtain.

OOH... OOH... MARY...

MMMM... TINGLY...

INT. SHOWER

CLOSE ON LLOYD - we see he's taking the TEGRIN CHALLENGE,

with different shampoos on either side of his head and a

noticeable part down the middle.

ON MARY - her   hair is slicked back, making her look better

than ever. As   the CAMERA PANS DOWN toward her breasts, we

are surprised   to see not breasts but a SET OF HEADLIGHTS

SUPERIMPOSED   OVER HER CHEST AREA. The headlights FLASH ONCE.

Then TWICE.

ON LLOYD - he blinks, confused at what's happening.

JUMP CUT   TO - an eighteen-wheeler is ROARING RIGHT TOWARD

THE MUTT   CUTTS VAN on the highway. Lloyd quickly veers back

into his   lane and avoids tragedy by a whisker. A shaken Lloyd

lets out   a SIGH OF RELIEF, and we

EXT. SECOND HONEYMOON HOTEL - NIGHT

The Mutt Cutts van is parked outside this seedy establishment.

A neon sign blinks: GROUP

DISCOUNTS - HAVE YOUR NEXT AFFAIR HERE.

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND HONEYMOON MOTEL

Lloyd and Harry are sitting in a large, HEART-SHAPED JACUZZI.

Lloyd is sipping a beer and Harry is absorbed in the Enquirer

as the water swirls around them.

Lloyd takes a swig of beer. Harry puts down the paper and

looks around at the romantic decor.

Harry nods.

Harry reaches for a beer and busts it open. He takes a big

gulp.

ON LLOYD - he does his best to hide his GUILT.

EXT. SECOND HONEYMOON MOTEL - NIGHT

We see that the black Cadillac is   parked a few cars over

from the Mutt Cutts van with J.P.   Shay in the passenger seat.

PAN OVER to a payphone. Inside is   Joe Mental. Outside the

booth, an ANXIOUS MAN impatiently   paces back and forth as he

waits for the phone.

INT. NICHOLAS ANDRE'S STUDY - NIGHT

NICHOLAS ANDRE is pacing around the room with a cordless

phone. He's in his late 30s, wears a ponytail, and dresses

in Aspen/Rodeo Drive chic.

INTERCUT CONVERSATION

The ANXIOUS MAN taps on the phone booth and motions for Mental

to hang up.

Andre SIGHS and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip.

The Anxious Man KNOCKS on the booth again.

Mental puts the phone down and motions the    Anxious Man closer

to the booth. The Man moves forward a few    inches. Mental

motions him even closer. When he's about a    foot away, Mental

punches his hand through the glass of the    booth and knocks

the Anxious Man out cold. Then

Mental picks up the phone again.

Mental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's

not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van.

He's joined by J.P. Shay.

As they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a LOW

GROWL. They stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see

a dog but there isn't one. They both take another step

forward, and the GROWL GETS LOUDER AND MEANER. Again, Mental

and Shay stop. He peeks under the car. Nothing.

Finally, Shay reaches for the door handle. As soon as he

touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a

siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a POODLE YAPPING.

Mental jumps back and pulls his gun.

Shay shrugs, nervous. The YAPPING grows EVEN LOUDER now,

forcing a flustered Shay and Mental to retreat from the scene.

EXT. SWANSON CHALET - ASPEN - NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT of a luxurious mountainside home.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SWANSON CHALET

An agitated Mary Swanson (the young woman who lost her

briefcase) is pacing back and forth in

AN IMPRESSIVE, ANTIQUE-FILLED LIVING ROOM. SEATED ON A COUCH

ARE HER FATHER KARL AND HIS MUCH-

younger second wife, HELEN.

Just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed

Nicholas Andre ENTERS. He looks appropriately solemn.

Andre looks upset.

IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO RE-

schedule.

The atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber. Karl

Swanson holds his hand out to his aughter.

Karl Swanson looks out the window, concerned.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The black Cadillac pulls over to the side of the road. Joe

Mental gets out of the car and props the hood open. He takes

out his gun, SLIDES IN A NEW CLIP, and puts it back in his

pocket.

Then he folds his arms and the two killers wait for the van

to come along.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

Lloyd taps Harry's shoulder.

Harry taps Lloyd back.

Lloyd immediately taps Harry.

Lloyd shakes his head, defeated.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Joe Mental squints down the road, sees the Mutt Cutts van

approaching, and starts WAVING HIS HANDS to flag them down.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN

Through the windshield we can see Mental waving. The guys

don't slow down, through. The just WAVE BACK as they BLOW

RIGHT BY HIM. Harry also toots the horn, which makes the

SOUND OF A DOG BARKING.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

As an angry Mental watches them disappear down the road,

Shay sits up in the front seat.

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER THAT DAY

We hear The Zombie's 'Time of the Season' as the van flashes

by.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

Just then, Lloyd notices something up the road.

EXT. MCDONALD'S - DAY

The Mutt Cutt car is at the drive-through window.

Harry hands a ten-dollar-bill to the Employee, who returns a

handful of change.

Then, before he can  give them   the bag of food, the guys

absentmindedly DRIVE  OFF. As   they pull out of the parking

lot, the McDonald's  Employee   sticks his head out the window

and WAVES THE BAG OF  FOOD at   them.

But the guys are already around the corner.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The Mutt Cutt van is on the road again, cruising along.

INT. MUTT CUTT VAN - DAY

SCENE, HOB-NOB WITH THE ELBOW-

rubbers, and walk out of there in the spring with enough

business connections to open a first-class worm operation.

You see, you don't get rich working, Harry. You get rich

knowing the rich.

Harry thinks about this.

Lloyd thinks about this.

Harry nods and looks out the window. Suddenly SOMETHING DAWNS

ON LLOYD.

Harry thinks about this.

Harry wracks his brain, but to no avail.

Lloyd rolls his eyes.

As a sheepish Harry gives Lloyd his change, they notice

something up ahead.

HARRY & LLOYD'S POV - ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, JOE MENTAL IS

WAVING THEM

DOWN AGAIN. This time the Cadillac is PARKED SIDEWAYS ACROSS

THE ROAD,

BLOCKING THEIR PATH.

Lloyd looks at Harry. Harry remembers that he's driving. He

pulls the car to the side of the road. Mental approaches the

passenger window.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY

They're back on the highway and Joe Mental is SITTING BETWEEN

THEM, looking extremely ANNOYED. The guys are in the middle

of an argument.

Harry turns to Joe Mental.

Mental grits his teeth as he pops a few antacid pills in his

mouth. He reaches into his coat pocket and we see a GLINT OF

STEEL. Just when he's about to pull the gun out, though,

Lloyd hits the breaks and SKIDS to a stop beside a bunch of

hitchhiking MIGRANT WORKERS.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER

The trio have picked up SIX MIGRANT WORKERS and everyone is

crammed into the car including a CRYING BABY who sits on a

pissed-off Mental's lap. Someone's playing a FLAMENCO GUITAR

and the gang is SINGING a SPANISH SONG.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER STILL

The Migrant Family is gone now. Harry and Lloyd are playing

a game while Mental stares straight ahead, furious. His eyes

are watering and he looks ill.

Harry lifts a cheer and lets out a LOUD FART. Lloyd SNIFFS a

few times, then closes his eyes and WAFTS it up toward his

nostrils, as if it was the aroma of a fine wine.

Harry throws up his arms, defeated. He hands Lloyd a buck.

Harry punches Mental's shoulder playfully.

EXT. DANTE'S INFERNO CAFE - LATE AFTERNOON

A large neon road sign beside the cafe shows a man's

exasperated face with FLAMES SHOOTING FROM HIS NOSE, MOUTH

AND EARS. The sign advertises: HOTTEST CHILI

PEPPERS NORTH OF THE BORDER.

INT. DANTE'S INFERNO

Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a table with a hateful Joe

Mental. The boys are each holding up a

POINTED RED CHILI PEPPER.

Lloyd and Harry exchange a look, then simultaneously BITE

INTO THE PEPPERS.

Suddenly the boys' EYES LIGHT UP. THEY LET OUT A SHRIEK. A

smile begins to curl on Mental's lips. He pours them a couple

glasses of water from a pitcher.

Lloyd and Harry who are both sweating profusely now start

to GULP down their water. This, of course, makes it burn

more.

The boys run to the bar and DUMP PITCHERS OF WATER ON THEIR

HEADS, much to the elight of a CHUCKLING Joe Mental.

EXT. DANTE'S INFERNO - DAY

Mental is on the phone outside the front door TALKING to

Nicholas Andre.

INTERCUT CONVERSATION

And whatever you do, don't let them get any closer. I don't

need them here running around Aspen.

Mental pulls a BLACK VIAL OF PILLS out of his jacket.

INT. DANTE'S INFERNO - DAY

Back at the table, the boys are soaked and HUFFING as if

they just finished the Boston Marathon. The burgers have

been served, but Lloyd and Harry are still too traumatized

to touch them.

UP ON A LITTLE TOME THAT WE GOD-

fearing adults call the Bible. It's crammed with all kinds

of pithy rules to live your life by.

Harry passes the jar and the two of them LOAD JOE MENTAL'S

BURGER WITH CHILI

PEPPERS, EXPERTLY CAMOUFLAGING THEM WITH LETTUCE.

Lloyd and Harry bite into their food as Joe Mental sits back

down at the table.

As he pours ketchup on his burger, the guys glance at each

other and TITTER. Then he picks it up and brings it to his

mouth. Just before biting into it, though, he PAUSES.

Mental starts toward the burger but stops again.

This is news to Mental.

Mental looks at the two of them and realizes that they're

serious. Then he BREAKS OUT

LAUGHING.

Lloyd and Harry share a     confused look. Mental shakes his

head and BITES INTO HIS     BURGER, CHEWING HEARTILY. Almost

immediately, his happy     demeanor is replaced by a LOOK OF

HORROR. His FACE TURNS     RED, HE GRABS HIS STOMACH AND FALLS

TO THE

GROUND, GASPING.

The boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help

him.

Harry checks Mental's coat pocket        for his antacid pills but

unwittingly brings out the BLACK        OF CYANIDE PILLS. He shakes

some pills out and hands them to        Mental, who tosses them in

his mouth and starts to MUNCH on        them.

For a moment, he appears to improve. His BREATHING SLOWS and

he sits up. Then his EYES

LIGHT UP.

MENTAL'S POV - QUICK ZOOM IN on the black bottle Harry is

holding!

Mental GURGLES and keels over, DEAD.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - AFTERNOON

Lloyd and Harry are back on the road, looking solemn.

Harry lets out a GROAN.

Harry perks up, cheered by this thought.

A DOCTOR is covering up the body of Joe Mental as he TALKS

He holds up the container of cyanide pills. Dt. Dale nods

and approaches another COP in the b.g.

Dale frowns at this and the Cop shrugs.

The Cop consults his note pad.

Dt. Dale does a double-take.

The Detective looks confused, as we

Andre hangs up the phone and then disappears down his basement

stairs.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

The room has a dirt floor. There's a stone WELL in the middle.

We hear MUFFLED HUMAN WHIMPERING coming from deep within the

well. Andre walks to the edge of the dark hole.

Andre takes a hit off his cigarette and flicks it into the

well.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The Mutt Cutts van cruises down the lonely interstate.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Lloyd is now FAST ASLEEP in the passenger seat as Harry drives

on. A roadsign reading DENVER - 602 MILES whizzes by. Todd

Rundgren's "Too Far Gone" begins to play while Harry peers

at the empty highway INTROSPECTIVELY. As the song plays we

see a series of quick shots:

A new sign says DENVER - 421 MILES. Lloyd is still asleep

with his feet now on Harry's lap.

Another sign reads DENVER - 201 MILES. Harry stares straight

ahead, practically catatonic. Lloyd's feet are out the window

and his head is on Harry's lap.

The next roadsign says DENVER - 157 MILES. Lloyd's feet are

now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet

should be. Harry looks on the verge of blacking out.

Finally, a sign reads COLORADO STATE LINE - 25 MILES/FOOD,

GAS NEXT EXIT.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - 2:10 IN THE MORNING

The Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. In the background

are several tractor-trailer rigs and a cafe. Harry climbs

out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the

passenger door.

Lloyd tumbles to the asphalt, STILL ASLEEP. Harry nudges him

with his foot.

Lloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet.

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Harry moves to the back of the poodle van. He has to LIFT

ONE OF THE CAR'S REAR LEGS to unscrew the gas cap. Then he

sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up.

EXT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Lloyd comes around the   corner, dragging a BATHROOM KEY

ATTACHED BY A CHAIN TO   A CAR ENGINE toward the Men's Room.

When he gets it to the   door, he struggles to lift the engine

on it's side, finally   managing to slip the key into the lock.

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Harry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee

pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs

out. This seems to wake Harry up.

The Athletic Beauty   smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and

starts to fill her   jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to

brush his hair into   place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods

to the skis on her   roof-rack.

She continues to pump gas.

THE GAS FROM HARRY'S NOZZLE STARTS TO OVERFLOW, BUT HE DOESN'T

NOTICE. FROM HER POV IT LOOKS

like a BIG DOG IS PISSING ON HIS LEG.

Harry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES. He

immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump

as she smiles to herself.

INT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM

Lloyd is standing in a stall urinating. He starts to read

the graffiti scrawled on the wall. Finally, he comes to one

that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993,

2:15

A.M. SHARP.

He frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch.

CLOSE UP OF DIAL - the date reads NOVEMBER 8.

ZOOM IN on the minute hand as it CLICKS TO EXACTLY 2:15.

Just as a concerned look crosses Lloyd's face, we hear the

BATHROOM DOOR SQUEAK OPEN AND SLAM SHUT! Terrified, Lloyd

quickly locks the stall door, then crouches on the toilet

bowl so his feet aren't visible. The sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS

approaches the stall and then stops. Lloyd looks down to see

a pair of SIZE 16 WORKBOOTS beneath the door. We can barely

hear a LOW GROWL. Then the stall handle JIGGLES. Lloyd holds

his breath. The ominous boots MOVE AWAY and Lloyd lets out a

SIGH OF RELIEF.

All of a sudden the DOOR IS KICKED IN, AND A TOWERING FIGURE

STEPS INTO FRAME. Lloyd looks up and GASPS.

HIS POV - it's the Redneck trucker, Sea Bass.

As Sea Bass STEPS INTO THE STALL, we

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

The Athletic Beauty is back in her Jeep now and Harry has

sidled up to the driver's side. He leans against her side-

view mirror.

He's such a klutz. My astrologer told me I should avoid

accident-prone guys.

Just then, the side-view mirror Harry has been leaning on

SNAPS OFF THE CAR. HE CRACKS

HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD, FALLS TO THE GROUND, THEN

QUICKLY LEAPS TO HIS FEET AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.

She throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a

cigarette.

He pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish.

The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks. Harry tosses the match

to the ground, and we hear an O.S. WHOOSH! Wisps of smokes

rise around him and we hear the LOW CRACKLE OF SOMETHING

BURNING. (Neither of them notice this.)

She looks him over and smiles.

As she starts to rummage through her purse, Harry SMELLS THE

SMOKE. He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE!

He shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe,

but to no avail. Meanwhile, the Athletic Beauty is still

searching for a pen.

Harry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames.

This only helps to fan them.

He begins hopping around violently.

Harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from

screaming.

She's taken aback by this outburst.

She throws the car into drive and PEELS AWAY.

INT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM

Sea Bass has his meaty paw wrapped around Lloyd's neck as he

slides him up the wall of the toilet stall.

Sea Bass pushes Lloyd to his knees. Then the trucker steps

back and UNDOES HIS FLY. The sound of the zipper brings a

green color to Lloyd's face.

ON THE MEN'S ROOM DOOR - it bursts open and a FLAME-FOOTED

Harry rushes into the bathroom, panic-stricken. In his

desperation he PLOWS THROUGH THE STALL DOOR KNOCKING SEA

BASS ON THE HEAD and thrusts his flaming foot into the

toilet,

EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE.

Harry breathes a DEEP SIGH of relief. Only then does he notice

LLOYD ON HIS KNEES AND

SEA BASS UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS PANTS UNDONE.

Harry has to do a DOUBLE-TAKE for this to sink in. Then he

lets out an admonishing

WHISTLE.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

CLOSE UP - of Harry's BURNT SHOE     with the toes sticking out

on the accelerator.

LLOYD SQUINTS THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. A SIGN UP AHEAD SAYS:

Lloyd nods, and as he pulls off the exit, we

Detective Dale nods, satisfied.

EXT. MINI MART - NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT of a mini mart.

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

The door opens and Lloyd gets in carrying a bag of Doritos

and a soda. He settles into the driver's seat and pulls a

Beef Jerky out of his back pocket.

When he gets no response, he notices that Harry is already

fast asleep in the passenger seat. Lloyd shakes his head.

EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Lloyd starts the engine and    pulls out of the parking lot to

the nearby freeway entrance.    As he enters the on-ramp, we

ZOOM IN on a sign that says:    ROUTE 80 - EAST. He's unwittingly

headed BACK IN THE DIRECTION    THEY JUST CAME FROM!

INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - SUNNY MORNING

It's bright daylight now. Harry is sleeping peacefully in

the passenger seat while Lloyd sips a coffee. The van hits a

bump which causes Harry's eyes to flutter open.

Harry yawns and stretches.

Harry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing FLATLANDS.

They both stare out the window.

Lloyd shakes his head in amusement, then SNAPS HIS FINGERS

in Harry's face.

numbskull. Here, take a sip of coffee. You're delirious.

A confused Harry sips the coffee and checks out the passing

terrain. Then something starts to awn on him. Slowly.

Lloyd thinks about this and then looks SICKENED.

EXT. TRUCKSTOP - MORNING

The Mutt Cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and Harry

is sitting beside it on the pavement, a BROKEN man.

But Harry just sits there, practically catatonic.

Harry lets out a defeated SIGH.

Harry thinks about this.

He stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward

the highway.

Harry starts resolutely toward the road while Lloyd watches.

Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his

friend. He seems completely rained.

Lloyd just stands there, SPEECHLESS, as Harry turns and walks

away. Out of frustration, he BANGS the snout of the car,

causing it to BARK.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Harry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out

unenthusiastically. A few cars WHIZ by, the cold wind whipping

at his clothes.

A station wagon blows by and throws a BAG  OF GARBAGE out the

window. It lands at Harry's feet. EXTREME  CLOSE-UP OF HARRY'S

FACE - a TEAR slowly rolls down his cheek  (like the Indian

in the commercial). PAN DOWN to the bag of  garbage. We see

it's a BAG OF ONIONS that's ripped open.

Suddenly a HEARSE pulls up and stops. It's an ominous-looking

vehicle and Harry hesitates. Then the passenger window rolls

down, revealing a contrite Lloyd at the wheel.

Harry looks the hearse over.

HARRY SMILES AND WE

Lloyd thinks hard about this.

Just then several COP CARS whiz by them in the opposite

direction with SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS FLASHING. When Harry

glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a COFFIN

in the rear of the vehicle.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Harry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse.

Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION. The lead car is

a CADILLAC.

INT. CADILLAC (LEAD CAR) - DAY

(This is the car right behind the funeral hearse.) A MAN and

Harry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the

market. The procession comes to a halt behind them. The guys

get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back.

Then they unceremoniously HEAVE THE COFFIN INTO THE DUMPSTER

AND WIPE THEIR HANDS

OFF.

practically on the floor.

EXT. DOWNTOWN ASPEN - DAY

The boys stroll down the sidewalk, looking in the windows,

studying the passersby, taking in the sights and sounds of

the ski town.

Harry throws Lloyd a concerned look, but then notices a phone

booth next to them.

Harry's concern grows.

Harry starts flipping through the phone book. Then abruptly

HE STOPS and puts the book down, a DEFEATED look on his face.

INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

The car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a

picturesque bridge. Harry and Lloyd are shivering in the

front seat as a LOUD, ICY WIND WHIPS though the hearse.

They're each spooning something out of a coffee cup and

sipping it.

Lloyd opens a TINY KETCHUP PACKET and squirts half of it

into Harry's cup and the other half into his. They pour a

few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons.

Lloyd smiles bravely at Harry. Harry notices something and

leans toward him.

Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it.

HARRY STARES AT IT. THEN:

Loyd puts the floss-meat back in his mouth and chews it.

Another gust of wind swirls around them.

Lloyd points to the dash.

Harry stares at Lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted.

He opens the car door and starts to climb out.

EXT. HEARSE - NIGHT

Harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms

crossed. Lloyd comes from around the other side.

Suddenly Harry LUNGES at Lloyd, who takes off around the

other side of the car. Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd

manages to evade his grasp.

Lloyd continues to outrun him around the car. Frustrated,

Harry opens the car and PULLS THE

BRIEFCASE OUT.

Harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river.

Lloyd starts to follow after Harry.

Harry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose

of the briefcase.

I feel another piece of Beef Jerky in my left molar! It's

yours, Harry, all yours!

Harry stops in his tracks, intrigued.

Lloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. Harry squints

at it.

Just then, Lloyd makes a dash at Harry. Harry turns and runs,

but Lloyd TACKLES HIM as they reach the bridge. The briefcase

GOES FLYING, and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another

in the snow, rolling over and over.

Finally, Harry manages to get the upper hand. He climbs on

top and CLASPS HIS HANDS

AROUND LLOYD'S THROAT.

Suddenly Lloyd's EYES LIGHT UP as he sees something O.S.

behind his friend.

Harry turns and HIS EYES LIGHT UP, TOO. He lets go of Lloyd

as we see

Harry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching

the briefcase. The city is lit up with millions of tiny

lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland.

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

A tuxedoed Bell Captain, BARNARD, is showing the guys around

an ENORMOUS AND LUXURIOUS SUITE. The place is big enough to

throw a touchdown bomb in.

The Bell Captain is a bit taken aback, but pleased.

Barnard SIGHS.

Harry forces a. embarrassed half-smile.

The Bell Captain nods.

At this, Harry serves Lloyd a reproachful look.

Lloyd looks guilty.

Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR

BILLS out of his pocket. He rips one off and tucks it in

Barnard's top pocket.

The Bell Captain, Barnard, is energized by this tip.

He bows and leaves the room. Then Lloyd cracks open the

briefcase and inserts a SMALL PIECE

OF PAPER.

Helen Swanson is KNOCKING on her step-daughter's bedroom

Mary is sitting in a chair looking sadly out the French

windows when Helen ENTERS.

Mary smiles.

Helen pulls out a joint and torches it up. She takes a hit.

EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY

The Guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse.

Several HOTEL EMPLOYEES rush to help them. Harry and Lloyd

get out wearing OVERLY TRENDY SKI GARB, complete with fur

boots, NASA designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors

everywhere. The Employees all grab the shopping bags and

then line up as Lloyd TIPS THEM ALL handsomely.

INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

The huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies.

Lloyd is going through it all. Harry is sitting out on the

balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the

mountain view.

Harry LIGHTS A CIGAR WITH A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL, takes a hearty

puff, and

EXHALES.

He blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony.

This suddenly makes sense to Harry.

Lloyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE.

Lloyd inspects it more closely.

There's a KNOCK on the door.

The Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucket

and a newspaper under his arm.

Lloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns.

Lloyd smiles and over tips him.

He puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads

for the door.

Barnard smiles and EXITS. Harry comes back in the room. He

picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger,

sending out a resonant RING.

He starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins

thumbing through the newspaper.

He notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something

he's found in the paper.

He shoves the newspaper at Harry.

CLOSE ON THE HEADLINE - it reads: SWANSONS TO HOST

-Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. The

ATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both

guys' hair in curlers.

-Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor.

Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neck

as if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his

fingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd

LAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in

his hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing.

-We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN to

the floor to reveal a PILE OF

NOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS.

-Then a   shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PAN

OVER to   Lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like Howard

Hughes.   Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety

goggles   tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric

sander.

-Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a

massage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred

dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and

WHISPERS in her ear. She smiles.

-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with

her shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back.

-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out

of the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He

couldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed,

but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in.

-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman

looks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves.

-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE

TUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman looks

sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up.

PAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive

J.P. Shay is sitting in a parked car, WATCHING HARRY AND

LLOYD.

EXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHT

Throngs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering

the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and

Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue

tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange.

(THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse

stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred

dollars.

INT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY

Nicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, when

Harry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them

the once over.

Harry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd

takes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels

off TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre.

Lloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou.

They ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate

J.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.

BACK ON HARRY AND LLOYD - the guys make their way through

the affluent crowd.

He points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party.

Lloyd rolls his eyes.

The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they

make their way to the bar.

As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL

RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then

walks away.

Harry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED.

The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s.

CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to

see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a

LARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and

Elizabeth Swanson.

The crowd QUIETS.

KNOW, THE ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY -

founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, Karl

and Helen Swanson - is the world's foremost efender of

endangered species. Our

SPRAWLING GROUNDS ARE HOME TO TWENTY-

three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed

on the United Nation's charter of protected species. Tonight,

we are deeply honored to have Mr. Karl Swanson welcome our

twenty-fourth.

The crowd CLAPS as Mr. Swanson takes Andre's place at the

podium.

He pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITE

OWLS IN A CAGE. Everyone OOHS and AHHS.

RESCUED RECENTLY, CULMINATING A FIVE-

year, two-million-dollar effort on our part. Together, they

constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on

the planet.

ON ANDRE - he's nervously eyeing Harry and Lloyd. He looks

pale.

More APPLAUSE.

The crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns

back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass.

Harry stares at Lloyd with concern.

Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room.

HIS POV - A BEGUILING MARY SWANSON IS TALKING WITH A COUPLE

OF GUESTS. SHE'S WEARING A

spectacular black cocktail dress.

Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.

Harry thinks about this a moment.

Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.

Harry SIGHS.

Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHES

Mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.

Mary turns to Harry, stunned.

She smiles at this.

are you involved with them?

She seems strangely charmed by this.

Just then, Mary's stepmother approaches. She's holding a

martini and looking a little sloshed.

Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry.

For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages

to snap out of it.

Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a

hopeful Lloyd.

Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer.

ON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns.

Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's

SPEECHLESS.

Lloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE.

Lloyd steps back elated.

He grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to

open it.

Suddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND

ZIPS ACROSS

THE ROOM LIKE A BULLET   DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN

WIDER-

EYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!,

and a THUMP!

A HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their

stunned attention to the cage.

THEIR POV - FEATHERS ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR THROUGHOUT THE

CAGE, AND ONE OF THE ICELANDIC SNOW

Owls LIES ON ITS BACK, its species now one bird closer to

extinction.

Harry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking

champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar.

The guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before

anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for

Nicholas Andre, that is; we PAN to show that he's been

standing nearby watching their every move. And he doesn't

look very happy.

INT. AASPEN APARTMENT - NIGHT

Nicholas Andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand

while J.P. Shay looks on nervously.

Andre runs his fingers through his hair.

pair of thermal tights.

This is when Lloyd notices Harry's get-up.

Harry looks down at his crotch.

Harry turns his profile against the window.

ESTABLISHING SHOT of the building.

INT. ASPEN BASE LODGE

People are putting their boots on and their skis are lined

up on the wall behind them. Mary is waiting by the fireplace

in an incredibly sexy snowsuit.

Suddenly Harry appears in the room, dressed ridiculously. As

he begins to clumsily make his way through the lodge toward

Mary, we see that he ALREADY HAS HIS SKIS ON. He kicks over

a row of skis and gets glares from all sides. Finally he

reaches her, OUT OF BREATH.

EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY

Harry and Mary are at the front of the lift line. The couple

ahead of them get on a chair, and then they shuffle into

position. Harry crouches nervously, waiting for the chair.

The chair swings around, comes up behind them, and makes a

smooth pick up of Mary, that is. An embarrassed Harry is

STILL IN THE CROUCHING POSITION, having missed the ride.

Mary looks back at him, confused. Suddenly he pretends to be

stretching.

INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - DAY

Lloyd ENTERS the bar as the WAITERS are setting up for the

day.

This is disconcerting news to Lloyd.

The Waiter shrugs and Lloyd sits down at the empty bar.

EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAY

Harry and Mary are now sitting together on a chair as it

rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top.

Harry holds onto the chair's frame nervously.

Mary takes a DEEP BREATH.

He looks mindlessly off in the distance. Then Harry notices

a PATCH OF FROST on the chair lift bar.

He licks it and his TONGUE IMMEDIATELY FUSES WITH THE FROZEN

METAL. He tugs a few times, but it won't budge.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

As Mary and Harry arrive at the top of the lift, Mary

disembarks but Harry stays on.

Harry and the chair lift swing around and start heading down

the hill.

EXT. BOTTOM OF MOUNTAIN - DAY

The chair lift comes back around with Harry still sitting on

it, stuck to the bar. Two LITTLE KIDS climb on with him.

The two kids just stare at him.

INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - AFTERNOON

A despondent   Lloyd's got a couple of empties in front of him

now. The bar   is open and there are a few CUSTOMERS sprinkled

about. Lloyd   takes a sip of his drink and looks up at the

clock on the   wall. It's 12:30.

We see a pair of beautiful legs slide onto the stool next to

him. PAN OVER to reveal that it's the Athletic Beauty that

Harry had tried to pick up at the truck stop.

Lloyd GRUNTS a hello.

Lloyd GRUNTS once more.

AS LLOYD GRUNTS AGAIN, WE

Mary gracefully carves her way to the bottom of the hill and

stops with a snow-spraying flourish. She looks around the

outdoor patio for Harry. She spots something and does a DOUBLE-

TAKE.

MARY'S POV - HARRY IS SITTING AT A TABLE, STILL ATTACHED TO

has been removed from the cable). He's drinking a cup of

coffee and trying to act nonchalant, espite the gawking of

Mary gets up and stands behind Harry. He MOANS nervously.

She grabs his head in both hands and starts pulling it away

from the bar. We see HARRY'S TONGUE STRETCH RIDICULOUSLY...

FIVE INCHES... SIX... THEN EIGHT. Harry GROANS in pain. Suddenly,

his TONGUE COMES UNDONE and Harry and Mary fall backwards

out of the path of J.P. Shay's bullet as it WHIZZES BY. We

hear the Mime in the b.g. CRY OUT in pain:

The poor Mime holds his bleeding hand and retreats nervously

into the lodge as the CROWD BOOS him.

INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - AFTERNOON

Lloyd's now swimming in despair, as the Athletic Beauty

RAMBLES ON beside him.

Lloyd motions for the BARTENDER.

INT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - EVENING

Lloyd is sitting forlornly on the bed while Harry feigns

surprise at what he's just heard.

Harry paces back and forth when suddenly SOMETHING OCCURES

TO HIM.

Harry BARKS OUT A LAUGH at their stupidity.

planned, I think I'll run out and catch a flick.

As Harry walks into the closet to change, Lloyd clenches his

fist and glares after him. Then he regains his composure and

moves to the bar.

Lloyd BITES HIS LIP at this. He fills two mugs with coffee

and throws a splash of Bailey's in each. He check to make

sure Harry is still in the closet, then pulls out a BOX OF

EX-LAX.

LLOYD DUMPS THE ENTIRE PACK INTO ONE MUG AND MIXES IT IN.

WHEN HARRY COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET DRESSED IN A NEW SUIT AND

TIE, LLOYD DOES A DOUBLE-

take.

Lloyd hands him the mug with the Ex-Lax. Then he lifts his

own glass.

Harry feels a pang of guilt but drinks up anyway.

He GULPS DOWN THE DRINK.

INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

Harry's driving along, WHISTLING happily to himself in

anticipation of the night. Suddenly we hear a LOW, INTESTINAL

RUMBLE. He reacts and rubs his stomach.

EXT. SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT

The hearse parks on the street and Harry gets out. He's

walking up the steps to the house when we hear more GASEOUS

THUNDER from his stomach. Harry stops in his tracks, gets

his insides under control, and continues to the front porch,

where he RINGS the bell.

Mary answers the door, fiddling with her earrings.

INT. SWANSON CHALET

Harry follows her inside.

As she disappears down a hallway, we hear Harry's UPSET

STOMACH again. He notices a bathroom off the hallway and

rushes inside.

INT. BATHROOM

HOLD ON Harry's face as he quickly pulls his pants down and

nestles onto the throne. He lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF as he

does his business, then leans over and SLIDES OPEN THE WINDOW

to air the room out. He's still glued to the toilet when he

hears a KNOCK on the door.

ZOOM IN TIGHT on Harry's face - his EYES GO WIDE and a visible

SWEAT breaks out on his forehead.

EXT. HALLWAY

A confused Mary is standing outside the bathroom door.

INT. BATHROOM

Harry's got his pants back on and is lifting the lid off the

toilet tank. He starts tinkering with a few valves.

EXT. LIVING ROOM - SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT

Mary's sitting patiently on the couch with her legs crossed.

She looks at her watch, then flips on the TV.

ON THE TUBE - the news is on. A WOMAN REPORTER is addressing

the CAMERA gravely:

We see Billy the blind boy from apartment 4-C sitting in

his wheelchair, holding up Petey the parakeet with its head

Scotch taped on its body.

The Reporter shakes her head and they go to a commercial.

Mary SHIVERS at this and turns off the television. Suddenly

the DOORBELL RINGS. She gets up and opens the front door.

HER POV - a dapper Lloyd is standing there in his new Aspen-

chic clothes.

Lloyd is thrilled at this.

Mary's MOUTH DROPS OPEN.

Mary is torn between getting her briefcase and waiting for

Harry.

She goes to the bathroom door. Inside we hear the LOUD

CLANKING of metal against metal.

INT. BATHROOM

Harry's got the eintire toilet completely DISASSEMBLED now.

Various pieces of the commode litter the floor, including

the big plastic float ball. He's on his knees tinkering with

some pipes coming out of the wall.

Harry hears her FOOTSTEPS echo down the hallway and then the

front DOOR CLOSING. Harry slumps against the sink, defeated.

INT. MARY'S JAGUAR - NIGHT

Lloyd is in the passenger seat, wearing a subtle, SATISFIED

SMILE. An anxious looking Mary is at the wheel.

EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - NIGHT

The Jaguar pulls up in front of the hotel. As Lloyd and Mary

get out, we PAN OVER to reveal that they were being followed

by Nicholas Andre and J.P. Shay in a Mercedes.

INT. ANDRE'S MERCEDES

Andre pulls a PISTOL from beneath his seat and slips it into

his coat.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

The door opens and Lloyd and Mary ENTER.

He leads her to the closed BRIEFCASE which is sitting on the

bed.

o.

Mary looks at Lloyd and smiles.

She can't believe her ears.

He drops his head and Mary leans over and kisses him on the

cheek.

INT. HEARSE - NIGHT

A sullen Harry is driving back to the hotel.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

CLOSE ON LLOYD'S FACE - he's starry-eyed in love as he spills

his guts.

Suddenly we hear   TOILET FLUSHING O.S.

REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS that Lloyd has been talking to an EMPTY

CHAIR. The bathroom oor opens and Mary comes out. She looks

around, expecting to see someone else.

Lloyd is flustered. He swallows hard. It's the moment of

truth.

She smiles at this.

Mary is obviously thrown by this question.

mean we hardly --

BEAT

BEAT

Just then, there's a KNOCK at the door. When Lloyd opens it,

he's face to face with Nicholas Andre.

I've got some interesting news about your husband.

Lloyd looks at MAry, devastated.

Lloyd and Mary hear a CLICK and turn to see Andre POINTING A

GUN at them. Andre steps into the room, and we

INT. HOTEL DANBURY - LOBBY - NIGHT

As Harry mopes through the lobby, we hear someone CALL OUT:

Harry turns to see the Athletic Beauty approaching.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

Nicholas Andre has his gun pointed at a stunned Lloyd and

Mary.

Mary can't believe what's happening.

Andre looks alarmed. He motions Mary to the briefcase with

his gun.

Mary opens the briefcase and a pile of WHITE, CRUMPLED-UP

BALLS OF PAPER fall out along with a few packets of hundreds.

Andre looks like his head is about to BURST in anger.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

Harry gets out of the elevator and lets himself into the

Presidential Suite.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

Harry ENTERS looking contrite and CALLS OUT:

Harry comes around the corner and STOPS COLD.

HIS POV - Lloyd and Mary are lying on the bed, their arms

handcuffed to the bedpost.

Harry turns to go, but bumps into the MUZZLE OF ANDRE'S GUN.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Harry is sitting beside Lloyd and Mary on the bed. Nicholas

Andre keeps his gun trained on them while he SPEAKS on the

phone:

ON THE BED - Harry and Lloyd can't look each other in the

eye.

Mary ROLLS HER EYES at this.

Lloyd can't muster a defense.

Harry glares at him.

Suddenly they hear the metallic CLICK-CLACK OF A GUN BEING

COCKED.

The guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD.

Lloyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful.

idiot --

Mary sees that they're in deep shit now.

Harry gestures with his head at Mary.

Andre points the gun at Mary.

Andre points the gun at Lloyd.

Andre SIGHS and points the gun at Harry. Then, as Mary and

Lloyd look on in horror, he FIRES TWICE. Harry grabs his

stomach and falls off the bed to the floor.

Andre smiles.

He aims the gun at Lloyd, COCKS THE TRIGGER. Suddenly, a

SHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand.

ON THE FLOOR - Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol

at the stunned Nicholas Andre.

Just them, the door BURSTS OPEN and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS

storm in with their weapons drawn.

Lloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air. A stunned

Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. He

reluctantly raises his hands. Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted

by the turn of events.

There's a sudden commotion in the room. Pushing her way

through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty. She

flashes an ID.

Lloyd looks to his friend, confused. Harry opens his shirt,

revealing a BULLET-PROOF VEST.

The guys glance guiltily at one another.

Harry and Lloyd EXHALE A SIGH OF RELIEF.

EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - NIGHT

There's a swarm of ONLOOKERS as Andre and J.P. Shay are

hustled into a police car and driven away. While Mary TALKS

to the police, Harry and Lloyd stare at her lovingly.

Just then, a cruiser pulls up and Mary's husband jumps out.

Harry and Lloyd stare in wonder as MEL GIBSON climbs out of

the car. Mary and Mel embrace, then Mel turns to the guys.

Harry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond. They look at

each other, and we

INT. LOBBY - HOTEL DANBURY - THE NEXT DAY

Lloyd and Harry come out of the elevator with their meager

luggage, but this time nobody rushes to their aid.

EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY

The guys EXIT the hotel and approach the Bell Captain,

Barnard.

This seems to please Lloyd and Harry. The hearse is delivered

to the front door.

They turn to go, but Barnard CALLS TO THEM:

Harry and Lloyd look at each other, confused.

The guys are STUNNED by Barnard's generous offer.

The guys beam at this.

Harry and Lloyd lock eyes. Then:

Barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their

hearse and drive off.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

As the hearse drives down the road, we hear V.O.:

As they head toward their next adventure, the CAMERA PULLS

UP, UP, UP...

END CREDITS
