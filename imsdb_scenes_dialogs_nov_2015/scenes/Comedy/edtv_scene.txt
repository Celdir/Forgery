The following is shot DOCUMENTARY-STYLE.

A GIRLS VOLLEYBALL GAME has just ended. It was a big game. Some kind of

championship.

ONE TEAM is CELEBRATING -- jumping up and down, squealing and

hugging each other. We are focused on the bench of the TEAM TRAT

LOST. They're very sad -- several are crying.

One girl, in particular, (AMY) is really sobbing. She's sweat-

stained, tired and just blubbering. Stuff's coming out of her eyes,

her nose, her mouth and the camera is seeing it all.

The COACH, a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls -- Amy in

particular.

He KICKS a CHAIR.

Now Amy is really a mess. She's crying, coughing, shaking.

The Coach storms off.

Amy is wailing and choking on her own tears.

This IMAGE FREEZES.

REVEAL

BEGIN CREDITS

We're in New York City. We're in the conference room of a modestly

successful cable TV station called "Real TV." The people are

young, energetic, clever. It's crowded, noisy -the furniture is

beaten up, bulletin boards cover the walls, with large index cards

all over them.

This room is not for show -- work gets done here.

SEVEN OR EIGHT PEOPLE are present. One of them is CYNTHIA REED.

She's the boss.

Mixed reactions, mostly negative.

IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

AGREEMENT

Silence. No movement at all.

No one is wild for this. Some hate it -- some are unconvinced.

Pause. The others know the argument is over.

END CREDITS

A BUS passes. On the bus is an ad. It says, "Would you

like to star in your own TV show? Call Real TV (and a

phone number) Coming (and a date)."

This is a nice upscale pool hall. A party is in progress in a

special private area -- a room upstairs let's say -- a loft.

Thirty or forty PEOPLE in their twenties and thirties are

informally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends.

It's NOISY, it's fun, it's informal. It's not a high-end group.

By that we mean, not, for the most part young lawyers or

stockbrokers. They're mostly blue-collar. Community college

graduates.

WE OPEN ON ED PEKURNY. He's an attractive man, about thirty.

There's still something a little juvenile about him -- not

stupid, just boyish.

SOMEONE is VIDEOTAPING HIM for one of those congratulation

montage things that are done at parties these days. Ed is good

at this. He's not professional but he's a loosey-goosey guy

who's kind of good on camera.

Everyone else is cracking up.

Other people are being "interviewed" on tape. Ed is SHOOTING POOL

with his buddy, JOHN. John's had a couple of drinks. He's a little

melancholy.

He is looking across the room, thoughtfully.

Ed waves dismissively.

ANGLE ON THE DOOR

Ed's brother RAY and Ray's girlfriend SHARI arrive at the party.

Shari is pretty in an unglamorous kind of way. They both wave and

then Shari goes off to talk to some of the LADIES and Ray joins Ed

and John.

They LAUGH.

It's getting wild. Some of the girls are dancing raucously.

ANGLE ON A TABLE (NOT A POOL TABLE, AN EATING-TABLE)

Ed, Ray, John, Shari and maybe another WOMAN.

Ray is holding a big tray of SHRIMP BALLS. During the

conversation, Ray throws them in the air and catches them in

his mouth like popcorn. Once, he even bounces one off the

wall into his mouth.

Ray waves dismissively, then gets an idea.

She hesitates, but she really doesn't mind. Slightly, amused she

takes her FIST and fits it completely INTO her MOUTH.

Ray is cracking up.

She removes her hand.

Ed LAUGHS. Ray gives her a KISS.

Shari's roommate RITA sits down.

They do, vaguely.

Ed and Shari, waiting for drink orders.

She takes Ed's beer.

They LAUGH.

Ed and Shari ARM-WRESTLING. After a struggle, Ed wins. Ed is

impressed.

Shari wrings out her arm and picks up her beer.

Ed LAUGHS.

They walk over.

ANGLE ON RAY

She's watching Ray's tape. Ray thinks he's funnier and

cuter than he is.

He gets hit in the face by a hors d'oeuvre.

He reaches out and grabs Shari's wrist. Shari is struggling

to stay out of frame. We just see her arm and Ray pulling on

it. Ray lets go.

CYNTHIA FAST-FORWARDS

WE SEE the camera shooting an empty space.

Then Ed's head appears sideways right in front of the CAMERA.

He starts to sniff.

He steps back from the camera and straightens his head as

he SNIFFS. He's more relaxed than Ray.

WE HEAR LAUGHS

The Real TV Staff are enjoying Ed's tape while they eat

lunch out of styrofoam containers.

He KISSES the LENS, smudging it.

Cynthia, watching, cracks up. The others seem to like him to.

This is a video store in Paramus, New Jersey. It's busy.

PEOPLE are in line to check out tapes.

WE OPEN ON a WOMAN -- a mother -- who is rummaging through her

purse for her Blockbuster card. She looks up and sees that her

TWO CHILDREN have opened several boxes of candy from the candy

display and are eating from the boxes.

She grabs the boxes from them. The boxes are ripped more than she

thought and candy goes flying all over. She bends to pick it up.

Ed appears. He works here.

Someone arrives with a broom.

LOU, the Manager passes.

Lou seems like he'd prefer to avoid this.

Ed goes to the phone.

Ed is being interviewed by the "Real TV" staff whom we met earlier.

He's slightly less comfortable than on his tape, but he's good.

They LAUGH.

The interviewer seems to be waiting for him to elaborate.

He doesn't. He shrugs -- that's it.

Ed's image freezes, while he has a funny-cute expression on

his face.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL a TV in a conference room with Ed's

frozen image on it. Cynthia is there with her bosses, the

people who run the network that owns Real TV. The top man is

MR. SCHARLACH. His deputies are MS. SEAVER and MR. McILVAINE.

This is not the same place where we met Cynthia and her

staff. This is richer, more corporate and formal.

Cynthia is frustrated.

She stops, waiting for approval.

Ed's RE-STOCKING the SHELVES

He gets goosed from behind

Ed DROPS the BOXES. Ray is there with Shari.

Ed and Ray enter.

He slaps a tape off a shelf.

Shari enters, curious about the yelling. She stands there

quietly, unnoticed by the guys.

Ed turns and sees Shari. She's self-conscious. She feels like she's

been caught eavesdropping.

Pause.

Ray lifts Ed up.

Ray kisses Ed.

Moderate-priced, restaurant.

WE OPEN ON a CLOSE-UP of AL. He's about seventy.

REVEAL THE FAMILY

Ed, Ray, Al, JEANETTE and MARCIA. Al is in a WHEELCHAIR and has an

oxygen mask connected to a tank. He periodically takes a hit of

oxygen. He's a little short of breath, but loves to talk. Jeanette

is Ed's mother -- about sixty. Marcia is a little older than Ed.

Ed nods.

Pause.

A STUNNED pause. They all look at Al.

WE HEAR: A loud drilling sound.

A WORKMAN is drilling a hole in the wall.

Ed is there with a TV CREW. They're running cable and drilling holes and

examining the apartment.

Cynthia is going around supervising. Ray and Shari are there. Ray is

fascinated. Ed is tense. Shari is observant. Ray separates from Ed

and Shari and asks one of the Installers a technical question.

SHARI AND ED

Ed thinks.

Ed joins Cynthia.

She gives him a card.

Ed looks kind of overwhelmed. She doesn't like this.

Ed reacts.

He's in bed, watching TV. The news is on. He glances up at one of

the cameras. On the news, they go to a story about him.

They all CRUCKLE.

She's watching the same show. She's edgy.

She's CRACKING her KNUCKLES.

TV SCREEN

The set goes off. Ed, once again, stares up at the camera.

FADE TO BLACK

Written on the screen -- "Day one."

A DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW with all the modern equipment.

Cynthia and her staff are gathered to watch the show begin

They're TENSE and EXCITED. A commercial is on.

On the TV, the commercial ends and the Real TV logo appears.

A CRAWL BEGINS

It says "The following is unedited, unscripted, and unrehearsed. It

is the real life of one American citizen named Ed Pekurny."

The logo fades away and we see Ed, in bed, sleeping. His ALARM RINGS

and he wakes up.

He's groggy from sleep. Instinctively, he begins SCRATCHING his

balls. As he does, it hits him that this is not a normal

morning. He looks up and sees two steady-cam guys at the foot of his

bed, aiming their cameras at him. Ed, then, looks at his hand on his

balls. Gently, he moves his hand away.

NOTE: The camera operators will change in shifts. We'11 see

about four regulars over the course of the film. The one we

will see most often is shooting Ed right now. His name is

CARLOS.

Ed, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, gets out of bed. His hair is

sticking up. He passes a mirror and notices his hair.

He turns to the camera and seems about to offer an excuse

for his appearance, but, then, just moves on.

He grabs some clothes and enters the bathroom.

They're not enjoying this. Everyone's staring at Cynthia. She

doesn't flinch.

NOTE: Silent advertising runs along the bottom of the screen.

Ed enters, dressed and showered. The Steady-cam is in his

face.

Ed is tight. He's much less comfortable than he expected to

be. He smiles stiffly at the camera. He's misplaced his

natural charm.

He gets a box of Pop-tarts out of the freezer. As he does,

other stuff falls out of the freezer on to the floor. He's

embarrassed. He bends down to pick things up, showing his ass

to the camera.

Ed is sitting up on the kitchen counter eating his Pop-tarts and

a bowl of cereal.

He takes a KNIFE and a BANANA. He peels the banana. He holds the

knife, blade up, over the cereal and chops down on it with the

banana, several times, rapidly, slicing it into the cereal. He's

proud of this.

Ray is watching the show. His head is in his hands. He's

horrified by how bad Ed is.

Jeanette and Al watching Ed.

Scharlach, Seaver and McIlvaine watching, grim-faced.

Cynthia is ON the PHONE.

Ed is EATING. He peers confused at the camera.

ANGLE ON

CAMERA OPERATORS. They're signaling Ed to get out.

ANGLE ON ED

Bewildered, imitating their gestures.

The Director is still on the phone. She's watching Ed on a

monitor.

Ed gets it.

Ed exits the building with the Operators walking backwards in front

of him, bumping into PEOPLE- People watch, curiously.

Ed reaches his car. He takes out his keys and drops them in a muddy

puddle. Disgusted, he fishes them out.

Scharlach, watching impassively.

Ed, in the car. He can barely fit the key into the ignition. Carlos,

in the passenger seat taps him on the arm. Ed looks up. Carlos holds

up a hastily-made sign. "It's okay. Relax, man." Carlos WINKS. This

does help Ed. He appreciates it. He drives.

WE SEE the control truck in motion. We also see another car

with another Steady-cam OPERATOR, shooting Ed's car as they

travel.

Ed is doing his morning errands. A little shopping -- a little

banking -- always ON CAMERA. At one point, he WALKS INTO a

GLASS DOOR with the word "Pull" on it. He pushed,

banging his forehead. A CHILD points to the word "Pull." Ed turns

to the camera, embarrassed. Later he buys a slice of pizza at a

little place that's doing no business.

As he walks down the street, PEOPLE call out "Hey Ed!" People

in windows show him that they're watching him at that exact

moment.

The camera shoots some of the people in the windows. They see

themselves on TV and they go wild. Ed also is confronted by

GUYS grabbing their crotches mockingly, calling out things

like "Hey, Ed, holding your own?" or "Hey, Ed, howls the grand

ballroom." Ed is slightly chagrined by all this, but handles

it with good grace. He seems to be loosening up.

Ed arrives at work. The store is already open. (Ed usually

gets there in the afternoon and stays until closing.)

CUSTOMERS are a little stunned by the arrival of a camera.

Some know what it's about some don't.

The CLERKS are aware of what's going on. They all signed

releases. Ed's BOSS greets him stiffly. Clearly he's trying

to get face-time on camera.

He shakes Ed's hand and smiles at the camera. He WAVES a little.

The BROOM GUY crosses, staring transfixed at the camera. He

blocks Ed and Lou. He FREEZES, then panics. He tries to get

out of the way and trips over his broom. He tumbles face-first

into the camera lens, hurting himself.

ANGLE ON ED, observing.

A WOMAN is serving dinner. She's watching Ed on TV -- really just

glancing at it. Her HUSBAND is helping her bring the food to the

table.

He changes the channel. She changes it back. He doesn't get it

at all.

RAPID CUTS of VARIOUS PEOPLE around America, watching -- A couple, a

young guy, a woman alone -- ending with a few college-age girls in what

appears to be a dorm room.

ONE GIRL is watching intently. Her roommates are mostly just

hanging around not really watching.

one of her roommates glances over to see what she's so excited

about.

Ed is walking. He passes the little pizza place he touted earlier.

There's a LINE out into the street. The STOREOWNER is working hard -

- deliriously happy. Ed passes, oblivious to what he's created.

The Camera Operator is shooting Ed in the bathroom CLIPPING his

TOENAILS

Ray and Shari watching Ed. Ray is BANGING HIS HEAD on the table.

It's late. She's alone. She's ON the PHONE. She's coming apart.

As she talks, she tries to LIGHT a CIGARETTE. She's shaking too

much to use her lighter.

ANGRY at her lighter, she throws it breaking a window.

She immediately regrets her outburst.

Written on the screen -- "Day Two."

OPEN ON TURTLES racing (as only turtles can) across the floor.

The turtles have little plastic men, seated on their backs.

The CROWD CHEERS and SCREAMS for their favorite turtles. Ed is

being followed by the steady-cams but seems to be ignoring it.

Ed is in a group which includes John, and Ray. The race ends

John looks very uncomfortable.

Ed wins. MONEY changes hands.

One of the cameras is very close to John. He's very

SELFCONSCIOUS. He doesn't look where he's walking. He

trips. PEOPLE LAUGH.

Ray TAKES OUT a big stack of QUARTERS and sets them on the bar next

to a SHOT GLASS

The cameras go with Ray. Ray does a "spit the quarters off the bar

into the shot glass" trick, while PEOPLE CHEER.

Ed is standing next to Shari. They're OFF-CAMERA.

ANGLE ON RAY

He's BALANCING a BAR STOOL on his forehead.

ANGLE ON ED AND SHARI

ANGLE ON RAY

As Ray drones on...

ANGLE ON ED AND SHARI

ANGLE ON RAY

He flips the BAR STOOL and catches it. He accepts the plaudits of

the crowd. He returns to Ed and Shari. So do the cameras. Ray is

fired-up.

Ray is still full of energy.

AL AND JEANETTE

Watching TV.

BACK TO BAR

Marcia is staring at the TV in UNHAPPY SHOCK. Next to her is a good-

looking, but slightly sleazy-looking GUY with a bandage on his

head.

Marcia, watching, HORRIFIED.

BACK TO BAR

He KISSES Shari. She COVERS her FACE with her hand.

He minces off' effeminately, to the bathroom, LAUGHING. It's

like a hurricane has just passed through. Everyone is sitting,

STUNNED.

She LAUGHS. They smile at each other. They make intermittent

eye-contact a little self-consciously.

Ed finally looks somewhere else and Shari, for just a moment,

stares right at him.

PULL BACK to TWO GUYS, watching this on TV in a bar -- more of

a neighborhood bar.

CUTS OF OTHER VIEWERS,

WATCHING REAL TV

A BEDROOM

The COUPLE we met earlier are in bed, the wife is holding the

remote.

A LIVING ROOM

A GAY COUPLE

"DAY THREE"

The ALARM goes off. Ed starts to scratch his balls, but stops

halfway down. He WINKS at the camera and starts his day.

Ed comes outside and he's accosted by a GROUP of angry Polish

Americans, many of whom are carrying signs decrying Polish

jokes and anti-Polish attitudes. They SCREAM ANGRILY when they

see Ed. Ed is completely shocked. He runs back inside. He

locks the door, leaving Carlos outside. The demonstrators

attack Carlos.

Ed is at his kitchen table with several burly DEMONSTRATORS

arrayed behind him. Ed is NERVOUSLY, READING from a sheet of

paper while Carlos shoots.

He's having trouble reading the next word.

He wipes sweat away.

QUICK CUTS of Ed, getting his laundry, doing some shopping,

getting his oil changed, all being shot by a CAMERA PERSON.

A YOUNG DENTAL HYGIENIST is cleaning Ed's teeth. The camera is

practically right in his mouth. It's making the Hygienist

NERVOUS. She's distracted. She hurts Ed. He SCREAMS. She

SCREAMS. She drops her tools.

It's an educational-type panel discussion involving various

eggheads and pundits. It's called "Viewpoint."

They all agree.

OPEN ON Ray with chopsticks up his nose, imitating a walrus.

Also, he has lo mein noodles protruding from between his lips.

Ed is forcing a smile. Ray is wearing a tee-shirt that says

"Ray and Bucky- Video Kings" with a phone number.

Cynthia is alone working late. She's drinking. She's watching

Ray. She's not enjoying him.

Ed is sitting up in bed, wearing shorts and a tee-shirt, eating

directly out of a cereal box.

LONG PAUSE

He hands Ed a PRINTOUT. Ed doesn't know how to interpret the

figures.

SILENCE

"DAY FIVE"

Ed is driving slowly on a busy street. Suddenly an

EIGHTEEN YEAR-OLD BOY lands heavily on Ed's windshield. Ed is badly

startled. He can't see. He swerves and stops. The boy is not

hurt. He's banging on the windshield, waving at the camera.

Ed, furious, gets out.

Ed just stares in disbelief.

Ed is walking. PEOPLE YELL at him.

The Guy LAUGHS like he really got in a good one. Ed ignores him.

TWO TEENAGERS run in, one has a camera and quickly snaps a

picture of Ed and the other Guy. Merrily, they shake his hand

and run off, whooping.

There are PEOPLE who trail along. Many of them will show up

again and again, throughout the movie, following Ed. Some of

them will look mentally or emotionally impaired.

QUICK SHOTS of Ed with CUSTOMERS - One or two show a bit of

camera-consciousness. A little group has gathered to observe

Ed's "show".

Ed rings the bell.

The door opens a crack, revealing Ray in a bathrobe. Ray's

look is unwelcoming.

Ray looks pained. Ed realizes what's happening and freezes

Ray's phone RINGS.

He turns to answer his phone, allowing the door to swing open

a little. Ed can see into the kitchen. He sees a WOMAN,

wearing just panties, facing away from him, searching for

glasses.

RAPID CUTS of VIEWERS loving this, some screaming "Don't go!,

don't leave, stay" etc.

BACK TO SCENE

She hangs up on him. He holds his head.

Ed is TIP-TOEING away. He stops when Ray calls him. Ray 'runs

out into the hallway after him. They speak with lowered

voices.

She THROWS SOMETHING at the screen.

She PICKS UP the PHONE.

The Camera Operators are vigorously nodding and mouthing "Yes, Go."

Ray is oblivious to this, but Ed picks it up.

Ed accepts the irony of Ray's attitude without comment

The door opens, revealing RITA, Shari's roommate.

Rita isn't sure how much she should reveal.

Shari appears in the doorway over Rita's shoulder. she's

holding a liquor bottle and she's a little drunk.

Shari indicates with her head, that Ed can come in.

Ed and Carlos enter. Rita shuts the door. Shari crosses to a

couch. Ed indicates for Carlos to give them some distance.

Carlos settles across the room. He rests the camera down as if

he's not even shooting, but he's still guiding it where he

wants it throughout the scene.

Shari shrugs.

She gives the camera a quick glance.

Ray, watching on TV.

His eyes bulge out and he begins to gasp.

RAPID SHOTS of viewers reacting-- "Whoa!" laughs, etc. The

college girls applauding. one of them SCREAMS "Tell it!"

Ed realizes that Ray's been called a "bad lay" on television.

She starts to cry.

Ray, still in shock.

In comforting her, he's gotten his face very close to hers.

Same dorm girls as before.

BACK TO SCENE

She tilts her head forward a little, hesitates, then kisses

him, at first warmly, then passionately.

The girls are going wild-- SCREECHING.

He dials the phone.

John is stunned.

He stares, amazed.

The WOMAN he was found with appears behind him.

She sees the kiss.

She begins beating her chest, one fist at a time while she

SCREAMS in triumph.

Shari and Ed have stopped kissing. They both look stunned.

Shari is suddenly sober.

She looks at Carlos who has now moved closer to them

He and Carlos exit. Going through the door, he gives Carlos a

little push then quickly steps back inside, slams the door and

locks it.

A CAMERA is shooting at a second-story window. We SEE

SILHOUETTES.

Ed is at the door. Shari is across the room. They stare at

each other silently. Then they run to each other. They kiss

again.

We can SEE them KISSING...

Ed and Shari are all over each other. They're breathless.

INTERCUT WITH SHOTS OF VIEWERS

They're seeing the door or the silhouette shot, but they're

hearing every word. They're mesmerized.

They look at each other. They don't know what to do.

She nods. He walks to the door.

She nods. They run back to each other and kiss.

The silhouettes are kissing.

Ray staring at the TV.

"DAY SIX"

This is a fairly old, modest private home. Ed pulls up. He

and Carlos get out of the car. Ed hurries up to the front door

and enters.

Ed enters. He's a little AGITATED

ANGLE ON AL

Al is in his wheelchair and taking periodic hits off an oxygen

mask connected to a tank. Al's watching himself on TV.

He WAVES.

They LAUGH.

After a pause, Jeanette enters, very camera-conscious.

STIFFLY, he gives her a kiss.

VARIOUS REACTIONS OF VIEWERS really liking this.

BACK TO SCENE

He KISSES her again.

She gets in the closet and closes the door.

The Real TV group is there.

They're smiling. Cynthia is ON the PHONE

They all WHOOP and LAUGH.

Shari and Rita are watching Ed leave his parents house on TV.

Rita is very excited. Shari is ON the PHONE.

Pause.

CUTS OF VARIOUS VIEWERS WATCHING REAL TV

End on TAD and BARRY in a health club. This is the refreshment

area. They've played racquetball and they're sweaty. They're

watching Real TV.

Ed arrives for work.

People CALL OUT to him-- PEDESTRIANS, PEOPLE FROM CARS, TRUCK

DRIVERS. "Hey Ed, my man." Ed waves. People shake his hand.

A teenage boy looks into the camera, making a funny face.

Someone else looks into the camera and says, "Hi, Ma."

Suddenly, Ray is there with a WOMAN. Ray is not happy. He's

wearing DARK GLASSES and a HAT.

Ed stops.

A GUY in a car appears and points at Ray.

The guy drives away. Ray is steaming.

Ed thinks he means to fight. Ed tries to calm him.

CASSIE, a woman about Ray's age, steps forward. She's slightly

self-conscious.

Ray points Cassie to the camera.

Ray nods.

Ed is amazed that Ray would do this.

Ray leaves, still angry.

Cassie lingers.

Ray returns and yanks Cassie away with him. Ed still hasn't

recovered from the bizarreness he just witnessed. Two girls

YELL in unison from across the street.

Cynthia and her staff, around a conference call box.

Ed's OFF-CAMERA

She PANTOMIMES for them to stay in the room, but be quiet. The

staff scrape chair legs and feign movement and ad lib "Bye Ed",

"See you, buddy" etc. They all stay.

The staff are stifling giggles.

The staff stifle laughter. One of the guys is doing a jerk-off

gesture. Cynthia gives them the finger.

Shari, in her Fed-ex uniform is making a delivery. A WOMAN's

signing for it.

ANGRILY, the Woman signs and slams the door.

She heads back to her truck. She looks up and Ed is there with

flowers. The TV cameras are there also. Shari is startled.

But she's also glad to see him.

She's camera-shy.

They both LAUGH.

She looks at the camera.

EMBARRASSED, she nods.

She doesn't say "no."

They KISS -- a little hesitantly, not passionately, but

affectionately. She's still self-conscious, but she's going

with the flow.

They're watching. They CHEER and high-five each other.

Ed and Shari dating. She's shy, but she really likes Ed. He

likes her and is very sweet to her.

1) Ed and Shari some place like "Tavern on the Green." She

looks pretty. He's very happy.

2) They come out of a club. TOURISTS photograph them. Shari

is a little disconcerted. Ed takes out a little camera of his

own and photographs the tourists. This makes Shari laugh and

relaxes her.

3) HOCKEY ARENA

CLOSE-UP of Ed, driving the Zamboni. He's loving it. He WAVES

to Shari.

SHARI IN THE STANDS, watching. She waves and smiles.

The ice, a WIDER SHOT.

The Zamboni is, basically out of control. Carlos is sliding

along the ice, shooting Ed as the Zamboni zig-zags dangerously,

eventually crashing into the boards, shattering the Plexiglas.

It's very CROWDED. Claustrophobic. Loud. Ed and Shari enter

just to see the show. They're spotted.

The Crowd, which is already fired up by the music, sees them.

It starts out okay, people crowding around, patting Ed on the

back.

A CHANT begins "Ed, Ed, Ed..." Pretty soon it drowns out the

music.

More people press towards Ed. It's too crowded -- dangerous.

Shari is swept away from Ed. She's buffeted about, violently.

She goes down. Ed can't move. The Crowd is friendly and

happy, but the effect is scary.

BOUNCERS squeeze Ed and Shari out the door, protecting them.

Ed is unnerved. Shari is somewhat bedraggled. Her clothing is

torn.

Ed is ON the PHONE.

He does.

Ed and Shari are EATING. So is a HUGE MAN sitting between

them. His name is MOE.

Ed and Shari are SKATING. Up ahead of them, Moe, (on skates)

is plowing into people, knocking them over.

Ed and Shari get up to leave. They look at each other, very

affectionately. They want to kiss. The cameras are close.

Ed is wearing a jacket. He spreads it out wide to block

Shari's face from the cameras. He leans in and they KISS on

the lips, several times, while Ed's jacket screens off the

cameras. They're in love.

Written on the screen -- "Day 26."

It's the same news team we met earlier.

A SHOT of Scharlach being interviewed. A CAPTION identifies him.

She's watching. She's ANGRY.

BACK TO NEWS REPORT

A SERIES OF MAN-IN-THE-STREET INTERVIEWS.

A GUY in an ice cream store.

He slices a banana the way Ed does.

THREE TEEN-AGE GIRLS

YOUNG GUYS

She's watching this, wearing a bathrobe.

Her self-esteem is being crushed.

This is an "E TV" kind of gossip show. The host -- a YOUNG

WOMAN -- is showing film of Ed and Shari getting out of Ed's

car. The film freeze-frames. Shari has an

unflattering look on her face.

Shari watching, in horror.

Ed and Shari are on a date. A WAITRESS is taking their order.

Shari still seems a little self-conscious, but Ed is having a

ball.

A WOMAN with her young SON approach.

The boy nods.

MOE, the Bodyguard, in the next booth hands Ed a glossy of Ed

and a pen. Ed signs it.

The Woman and Child leave.

A PHONE RINGS

Ed takes a phone out of his pocket.

He HANGS UP. He's disgusted.

It's not a seedy dive. Ed and Shari and the camera operators

enter. A CUSTOMER approaches.

The guy does Ed's "Happy Dance."

Ed brushes by him. He sees a WOMAN passed out at a table.

He prepares to lift her.

He turns and sees Marcia standing there.

He lets go of the woman.

Her head bounces on the table.

Marcia guides them into chairs.

For a second, Ed doesn't get it. Then.

Cliff is in the middle of his show.

He's wearing a PORTABLE ORGAN. He's not great. He's a smalltime

cameras are shooting him.

CUTS OF Cliff, singing every type of song, imaginable. This

guy is desperately trying to cover all the bases -- i.e.

Sinatra-type standards, something from "Lion King", "Do Ya'

Think I'm Sexy," "Smokin' in the Boy's Room," "Hey, Hey, We're

the Monkees," the theme from "Hawaii Five-0," a rap number, and

"Ave Maria."

ANGLE ON ED AND SHARI

Ed and Shari are KISSING.

CUTAWAYS TO VIEWERS

She indicates the camera. Ed tries to allay her fears.

CUTAWAYS

They applaud.

A very attractive woman (JILL) and her friend.

BACK TO ED AND SHARI

GUYS WHO DON'T THINK SHE'S HOT

They mock her, crying "Boo hoo hoo" and pretending to rub their

eyes.

BACK TO ED AND SHARI

She picks up a N.Y. POST.

He doesn't hear her. He's scanning the list.

Ed is a guest.

LAUGHS.

BIGGER LAUGHS.

It's after the show. Ed is getting ready to leave. John is

with him, keeping him company. A. P.A. is giving Ed a bag of

gifts. (Of course, Ed is still on Ed TV.)

He KISSES John.

ANGLE ON JILL IN THE HALLWAY (We met her earlier in a cutaway.)

She's saying good-bye to a CASTING ASSISTANT.

Jill looks up, sees Ed and walks right up to him

SECURITY steps forward.

They step back.

Shari, watching this on television.

But she doesn't leave.

She takes his arm and leads him out.

Written on the screen -- "Day 28"

Two WOMEN on Stairmasters.

The dorm girls.

The game includes Tad and Barry.

The same eggheads who, earlier, had no interest in Ed. Now

they're all worked up.

They all nod.

" DAY 34 "

Ed is opening letters and packages. There are piles of them

He places it in a large pile. He opens another envelope.

Ed stares and his smile disappears.

ANGLE ON THE MAIL

A picture of Ed's face with his body drawn underneath it. The

body is spurting blood and is mutilated. Ed stares at it.

The DOORBELL RINGS.

He PICKS UP a baseball bat and crosses to the door.

He opens the door. A handsome man in his early sixties is

there. His name is HANK.

Ed waits.

Hank shrugs. Ed stares at him, then begins to look a little

shaken.

Jeanette is putting a jar in the refrigerator. She glances at

the television. She drops the jar. It SHATTERS...

Marcia is with her half-Asian son ANDY. She's serving his

dinner. OFF-CAMERA we HEAR Cliff SINGING and the DOG HOWLING

in distress. Glancing at the television, Marcia gasps.

Ray is TYPING on a word processor.

He stares curiously at the television.

Ed is staring at Hank doubtfully.

RAPID CUTS of VIEWERS, excited. Many of them reach for the

phone.

The Real TV staff react. Cynthia looks over-- stunned.

Written on the screen -- "Day 35"

Ed and his mother are arguing. Al is sucking oxygen and has a

pile of "People" magazines with Ed on the cover. A REPAIRMAN

is fixing the refrigerator. All their food is out and melting.

Jeanette is trying to preserve food in an ice chest while she

argues with Ed.

Ed signs.

Al takes a loud breath.

Ed signs.

Jeanette storms back in.

Ed nods.

Al breathes loudly.

Pause. Even the repairman pokes his head out of the

refrigerator.

Al breathes loudly.

Al starts to wheel himself out. Ed looks weary.

He's asleep.

They're monitoring him. They see Ed WAKE UP. They stir.

Sleepy, and scratching his ass, he goes into the bathroom.

Ed shuts the door. He takes his PORTABLE PHONE OUT of a

bathroom drawer. (He stashed it there.) He makes a call and

waits.

He takes CLOTHING OUT of the bathroom hamper.

until he finds something acceptable.

They're monitoring the empty bed.

Ed is dressed. He CLIMBS OUT his bathroom window.

Shari opens her front door.

She looks down the hallway.

He goes in, grabs her and kisses her passionately.

They get in. They look at each other.

Gently he puts his arm around her. At first, she hesitates,

but then curls up against him and relaxes.

He TOUCHES her. They KISS. Then again. Their hands are

roaming. They're hot. They're breathing hard. He's

unbuttoning her blouse. Their hands are all over each other.

Her blouse comes off. LIGHTS GO ON. They see cameras,

shooting at them. Shari SCREAMS and covers her breasts.

FOUR GUYS in a disgustingly messy room, watching the replay of

Ed and Shari.

They GYRATE LEWDLY.

Shari is working. Ed is following her around. Shari is ANGRY.

The cameras are there.

She takes PACKAGES OUT OF the TRUCK and THROWS them at the

cameramen.

She throws a package at him.

Pause.

A GUY YELLS from across the street.

GUYS keep YELLING "Shari!"

She tries to go after them. Ed holds her back.

The camera is right in her face. She grabs it.

He returns the camera.

Shari starts for her truck.

She gets in her truck.

She SLAMS the TRUCK DOOR.

He bangs himself in the head.

She drives away.

He BOWS.

Ed enters. He's worn out. He plops down, and puts on the TV.

Ed is flipping stations. Something makes him stop.

ANGLE ON THE TV

We see JOMA. He has a lot of charisma. He seems a little

dangerous, but in an exciting way.

ANGLE ON ED

Watching. He's stunned.

They're watching a tape of Ed TV. Ed has just entered his own

apartment. A WOMAN is there, sitting on his sofa. She's

caressing Ed's undershorts against her cheek. Ed is highly

agitated.

The BODYGUARD is pulling her out.

REVEAL that Scharlach, McIlvaine, Seaver, Cynthia and Greg are

all watching.

ON the TAPE, the woman while being forcibly evicted, offers

the underwear to Ed. Ed recoils.

She's hauled out. They stop the tape.

He wants it accomplished.

He wants it accomplished.

Ed is walking from his car to a building. CROWDS are behind

barricades. They YELL at Ed as he passes. Ed is used to this.

Rita OPENS the door and sees Ed.

He's off the air. He's a little down. He's ON the PHONE-

She's working out an a contraption.

OPEN ON ANDY, Ed's half-Asian nephew. He's eight. He's

wearing a baseball glove.

REVEAL ED, also wearing a baseball glove. He throws a high pop

up to Andy. Andy staggers around and almost catches it.

REVEAL JILL, walking a DOG. it takes just a second to

recognize her.

Ed is hit with the ball.

REVEAL the Real TV Staff watching this on television in their

office. As Ed and Jill chat in the background.

Cynthia doesn't even smile.

MONTAGE

INTERSPERSED IN THE MONTAGE ARE SHOTS OF PEOPLE

WATCHING THEM ON TV

1. Ed and Jill going into a chic club -- ushered in

immediately. Here, as in the other times we see her, Jill is

comfortable with the situation. She's the opposite of Shari.

She poses willingly. She chats easily with paparazzi. She

clings to Ed. There's nothing overt or obnoxious about her.

She's just comfortable and good at it and always looks great.

2. INTERVIEW with the guys who didn't like Shari.

3. A N.Y. Post story:

Pictures of both women. Jill looks great. Shari is in her

uniform and looks like a mouse.

4. SHARI

In a new apartment. Watching Ed and Jill on TV. She's very

unhappy. She turns it off.

5. Ed and Jill at the nice restaurant he was at with Shari

earlier. It looks like he's starting to like her.

6. Ed is refereeing a pro-wrestling match. He counts out the

villain who, then, jumps up and chases him out of the ring.

"DAY 47"

Ed and Jill are in a HEAVY LIPLOCK. Carlos is right there with

the camera. Unlike Shari, Jill seems unself-conscious. She's

getting Ed pretty turned-on.

SHOTS of VIEWERS, also turned on, especially the men.

It's clear what she means. Ed is conflicted. He's clearly

aroused.

He looks for his watch on the wrong wrist, then seems to check

all around his body until he discovers it.

Written on the screen -- "Day 48"

Ed is walking, the camera following. He looks tense. People

SHOUT "Hey, Ed" "Ed-die" etc.

ANGLE ON A NEWSPAPER VENDING MACHINE

The New York Post front page -- "Is tonight the Night?" with a

picture of Ed and Jill kissing.

ANGLE ON ED

Ed looks up.

Ed continues down the street. People YELL to him "Good luck

tonight," "We're rooting for you" etc.

A STREET CHARACTER walks alongside for a minute.

Security grabs him and the vial falls and breaks. The liquid

hits the pavement and smokes up.

More shouts "Be gentle", "We'11 be watching", "Use a condom" etc.

A SCHOOL BUS passes. The KIDS YELL out the window to Ed.

There is no line. At TICKET TAKER sits, bored. No one is

going in or coming out.

It's deserted.

It's empty. The HEADWAITER stands in the doorway with nothing

to do.

A PARTY is in progress. The TV is on. On TV Ed is in a liquor

store, buying a bottle of wine. Ed is dressed for his date.

The people at the party are watching TV and commenting. It's

like a Super bowl party.

Several high-school age BOYS. They have made themselves look

like Ed. They're very excited.

Ed's car turns the corner and he sees a CROWD gathered around Jill's

Ed carrying his wine enters to APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

A LONG SHOT encompasses all the houses on the block. Their

living room TV's are visible. All but one are tuned to Ed.

Something is cooking. Jill picks up a plate of something -

dip and cut vegetables for instance. She starts to exit the

kitchen as Ed and Carlos enter. Ed and Jill have a soft

collision.

SELF-CONSCIOUSLY. He takes a vegetable, dips it and eats it.

They look at each other. Jill leans forward and kisses him.

She puts the tray of vegetables on the counter. They continue

to kiss.

The high school boys are CHANTING.

COLLEGE GIRLS (same ones as before).

RAPID SHOTS of other VIEWERS, watching, transfixed --

Ed and Jill are making out. They begin taking each other's

clothes off. They're passing the point of no return. It's

going to happen right there in the kitchen.

Ed and Jill, in heavy heat, back up to the kitchen table and

climb on to it. They continue to pull at their own and each,

other's clothing. They're making passionate noises.

Shari is not watching television. She's eating a little meal

she's made for herself. She HEARS PEOPLE in her building

cheering and whooping. She looks miserable.

Cynthia and her staff are watching. Cynthia is ON THE PHONE-

Jill is on top of Ed. Carried away with passion, Ed attempts

to roll her over and get on top. He does, but rolls too far.

He crashes off the table, to the floor, face up.

He looks at her apologetically.

Ed is being loaded into an AMBULANCE. He looks humiliated.

PEOPLE in the street are applauding politely as if Ed were an

injured ballplayer being carried off the field. Jill is by the

ambulance. She's PETTING a CAT who looks all right.

PHOTOGRAPHERS are taking her picture. She's posing willingly.

The ambulance drives off as Jill continues to pose.

Written on the screen -- "Day 49"

The taping of "The Tonight Show" or "the Late Show" -- once

again, whichever we have a prayer of getting. The MONOLOGUE is

in progress.

The AUDIENCE goes wild.

BIG LAUGHS

Scharlach EATING. He's stunned.

REVEAL CYNTHIA

He thinks.

"DAY 54"

Ed is walking. He's wearing a white, Velcro support around his

waist. He's agitated. He's carrying a copy of the New York

Post.

WE SEE a headline -- "Ed: She Broke My heart."

A GUY YELLS AT ED

He stops and looks like he's in shock. He stares in through

the display window of a bookstore.

ANGLE ON,

a big DISPLAY of cheap, rushed-out, exploitation books. On the

cover we read "My Brother Pissed On Me By Raymond L. Pekurny.11

And there's an old photo of two little boys. (Ed and Ray)

"DAY 58"

It's the hallway of a cheap hotel. Ed and the camera come off

the elevator. Ed looks at room numbers. He can HEAR the noise

from all the rooms. A radio -- a domestic disturbance -- a

baby crying -- it's a horror. He KNOCKS ON a door.

The door opens REVEALING Ed's father.

They enter.

It's depressing. There's a liquor bottle on the dresser. Ed

sees it.

Ed SHRUGS.

Ed just GRUNTS.

Hank takes LAUNDRY off a chair.

He does. He looks around.

Ed doesn't know what to say. He's bitter towards Hank, but

there's also some empathy.

Hank looks blankly at him.

He exits. Out in the hallway, he leans back against the door,

drained. The camera is right on him, soaking it up.

The same PBS-type panel of smart-looking people we met earlier.

WE OPEN ON about half the panel.

REVEAL JOHN, sitting comfortably on the panel, looking very

wise.

The others NOD appreciatively as John puts a PIPE in his mouth.

TV INTERVIEWS

A MAN, on the sidewalk, has a STUFFED CAT stuck to his back to

tease Ed.

Suddenly, a TUBFUL OF WATER crashes down on him.

Ed at the window, with a now empty plastic tub.

Then he throws the tub out the window.

"DAY 78"

Again, everyone there, including Cynthia. A Honcho is reading

a report.

"DAY 94"

Tad and Barry -- as we met them, originally -- are watching TV.

They're really enjoying it -- laughing, pounding the table.

REVEAL that they are watching Joma. On the TV -- Joma is

eating dinner in his apartment with TWO attractive WOMEN, who,

apparently, both live there. Joma is upset (but he's funny

when he's upset). What's upsetting him is that across the

alley, in a window of another building, he can plainly see an

OVERWEIGHT MAN, with his shirt off, exercising. The overweight

man is apparently watching an exercise video and is bouncing up

and down in place causing everything to jiggle unpleasantly.

ANGLE ON TAD AND BARRY, HYSTERICAL

ANGLE ON TV

TAD AND BARRY

Laughing and wiping their eyes.

Off the air. Ed ON the PHONE.

INTERCUT WITH CYNTHIA

She's listening, amazed.

She HANGS UP and has an acid reflux.

Ed and John are playing.

Ed thinks.

Pause.

SILENCE. The cell phone RINGS.

Ed PICKS UP the phone.

INTERCUT WITH JEANETTE IN A HOSPITAL

She's crying.

He hangs up.

Tad is watching TV and talking an the phone.

Ed rushes in. He goes up to the desk. Carlos is with him.

A DOCTOR spots him.

Eddie looks across the room and sees Al in his wheelchair, just

entering from outside. He wheels towards Ed.

Ed turns to the doctor.

Again, Ed turns to the doctor.

Jeanette enters.

He wheels off. Jeanette and Ed are left alone.

Jeanette GASPS.

Al comes rolling back, SINGING.

OPRAH or RICKI or GERALDO or someone.

Our same panel of pundits.

REVEAL ED watching this discussion on TV.

DAVE OR JAY

A CHART is set up with little pictures.

Ed is driving Jeanette and Al to the funeral. A CROWD is held back by

POLICE. Someone yells "Adulterer". Someone else tries to offer Ed a

lunchbox. Someone else is carrying a sign "What a Way to Go".

Hank's COFFIN is being carried to his gravesite. Ed, Ray and Marcia

are pall bearers. One of the others pall bearers is Ed's BODYGUARD.

The OTHERS TWO are two guys who work for the mortuary. Carlos is

shooting.

Ed gives up. He turns to Marcia.

She doesn't answer. Ed reacts.

Ed CRINGES.

The service ends. The small group begins to walk away. Ray

and Marcia go off together, ignoring Ed. Jeanette is

attempting to wheel Al away from the grave, but she's hitting

ruts. Ed approaches.

She touches him but he pulls away. Ed wheels Al.

He stops wheeling and crouches down next to Al.

Pause.

Al KISSES him.

Ed wheels him away.

She's watching. She's genuinely moved. She wipes her eyes.

This place is sleazy. Ed enters, worn out. He crosses to the

bar where we find, Jeanette nursing a drink. She's not drunk,

but she is wallowing.

They're out.

Ed is helping Jeanette. Ray arrives. He's ANGRY.

He looks around. Moe is gone.

Ray and Jeanette leave.

Ed is there along with Cynthia and the Network Execs. There

are more execs than before. Cynthia's people are not there.

This entire meeting is on ED TV. Cynthia is quiet -

observing. Ed looks whipped.

Cynthia just stares at her, COLDLY.

Pause.

Silence. What the hell is he talking about?

They still have no idea what he's talking about.

Pause.

Shari watching Ed TV.

Pause. SHOCK.

Scharlach speaks carefully - gently. He's aware of the camera.

He doesn't want to come off as a villain.

Ed thinks.

He turns right to the camera.

Greg bursts in, carrying a sheet of paper.

Cynthia stares, amazed.

Ed WALKING ZOMBIE-LIKE- CROWDS SWARM.

Ed is with STEVE, a lawyer. Steve has a huge contract on his

desk.

Ed is sitting alone, eating lunch. He's surrounded by cameras

and shielded by BODYGUARDS.

OUTSIDE the diner a CROWD of rubberneckers is out on the

sidewalk, looking in at him, some of them acting up, some just

staring in. Ed is tired. He glances out the window and makes

a MONKEY FACE. Suddenly, he FREEZES.

He sees Shari's face in the crowd. She puts her fist in her mouth.

Ed and Shari are walking -- on camera.

He laughs.

Pause.

He touches her hair. They leap on each other. They're

KISSING.

Big meeting. Many Honchos, including Scharlach and Cynthia.

All but Cynthia are focused. Cynthia looks bored.

A secretary (MILDRED) enters. She's a little flustered.

Scharlach indicates that he wants someone to turn on the TV.

Someone does and they see Ed and Shari coming down the hall.

They enter the conference room. The cameras, of course, are

with them. Ed is carrying a CARTON.

MUCH CONFUSION

He takes a lot of HATS out of the carton and begins placing on

the heads of the Honchos.

He takes back that Honcho's hat.

The Honchos staring blankly.

She holds up a CARD.

It's packed with LAWYERS and EXECS. Everyone is agitated,

except Cynthia, who seems relaxed-Ed and Shari are gone.

The meeting continues ANGRILY.

The Honchos are watching Ed TV. They look STRAINED, ANXIOUS.

In Ed's home a BANK OF PHONES have been set up like for a

telethon. Manning the phones are Ed, Shari, Ray, Marcia, Al

and Jeanette. The PHONES KEEP RINGING.

In the conference room one of the Execs looks DIZZY.

The CAMERA PANS to Al on the phone.

IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM

FEAR and SHOCK, except for Cynthia, who is LAUGHING and can't

stop.

She stops.

Then she gets up.

On the word "loved" she shot Scharlach THE FINGER. She exits,

LAUGHING.

Ed is off the phone,

Ed grabs a sealed ENVELOPE. Andy plays a DRUM ROLL -- not

terribly well.

As he opens the envelope.

The Executives staring, HORRIFIED.

He takes out the card and registers mock-surprise.

Scharlach's EYES WIDEN in HORROR.

As Ed explains, Scharlach reaches for the phone, fumbling it

for a moment.

A SHOT OF a television set tuned to Ed. Suddenly Ed is

replaced by a Real TV logo.

MUSAK

An ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER.

The PANEL.

The Panel.

A NEWS REPORTER is reporting on a wedding.

A news show.

WE SEE Joma walking into his building. Somebody steps forward

with a GUN. The ASSAILANT is jostled as he shoots and the

bullet hits Joma in the ass. He falls to the sidewalk.

The CAMERA PANS to the Assailant, who we might recognize as

someone who we've seen following Ed from time to time.

REVEAL Ed and Shari watching this on television.

Shari turns it off.

THE END
