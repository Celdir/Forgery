EXT. PARK - DAY

We float down through a serene, leafy park to the

children's play area. There, in the sandbox, a BEAUTIFUL

FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL plays among a group of kids.

A SIX YEAR OLD BOY approaches. He watches the little

girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle.

And then - out of nowhere - THE LITTLE BOY PUSHES THE

LITTLE GIRL DOWN.

Some of the other kids SNICKER at this brilliant one-

liner. Our little girl's face turns red.

And then, just to punctuate, he JUMPS ON THE SANDCASTLE,

smashing it. Finally, our little girl starts to CRY.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Our beautiful girl sits at a kitchen table with her MOM.

She can only get out one syllable between big, wet sobs.

The little girl shakes her head no.

FREEZE FRAME ON OUR LITTLE GIRL'S FACE - TRYING TO

PROCESS THIS.

7/20/7                                                 2.

BACK TO THE SCENE - THE MOM CONTINUES...

We see our little girl take this in, like she is just now

beginning to understand the ways of the world.

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

A CUTE COLLEGE GIRL sits CRYING in front of her ANSWERING

MACHINE, as her ROOMMATE looks on.

The machine evilly flashes 0 in the NEW MESSAGES window.

INT. HIGH RISE OFFICE - DAY

A HOT EXECUTIVE WOMAN stands in the office hallway,

watching a SEXY MALE COLLEAGUE walk by. He does not give

her a second glance. Her FEMALE SECRETARY looks on.

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.    AND THEN THE TITLE FADES UP:

INT. BREWER'S ART - NIGHT

GIGI, pretty and approachable, sits in a booth at a hip

Mt. Vernon date spot with CONOR, cute but holding onto

his frat boy roots. They sip their near empty cocktails.

Conor laughs.    Gigi smiles -- she's doing well.

Gigi sips her drink, and looks at Conor.

Their WAITRESS appears, cutting him off.

Conor looks to Gigi.

7/20/7                                                    5.

Gigi trails off. Conor considers this for a LONG MOMENT.

We can see on Gigi's face that she knows that the outcome

of this date hangs in the balance. It's an eternity.

Gigi breathes a SIGH of relief.

Gigi NODS and SMILES, clearly flattered that Conor

remembered her order. She scoots a little closer to him.

EXT. BREWER'S ART - NIGHT

Gigi and Conor HUG outside the restaurant.

Gigi waves flirtatiously and walks away, smiling.

She turns around to look, and sees Conor TAKE HIS CELL

PHONE OUT OF HIS POCKET.

Gigi TAKES HER CELL OUT OF HER PURSE and dials.

She sneaks another look over her shoulder to see Conor.

7/20/7                                                  6.

We FREEZE FRAME ON GIGI, mid-step.    Then, THE IMAGE

SLIDES OVER TO FIND:

CONOR - also in FREEZE FRAME. The image UNFREEZES and we

continue with Conor as he DIALS HIS CELL PHONE.

INT. EDDIE'S OF ROLAND PARK GROCERY - SAME

ANNA, hot in an earthy sort of way, heads down the aisle.

She holds her cell phone in one hand - a BOTTLED WATER

and a BAG OF SOY NUTS in the other.

As Anna gets to the checkout, there's one person ahead of

her. He looks back to see her - he's BEN, good looking

and supremely likeable. They share a smile.

She looks at what he's got - a SIX PACK OF SIERRA NEVADA.

He steps aside to let her go.   She smiles.

7/20/7                                                    7.

She hangs up the phone and moves past Ben, hands her

things to the EMOTIONLESS CASHIER. As he rings them up -

she looks back at Ben - they SHARE ANOTHER LOOK.

She hands the cashier her ATM card - he swipes it.

He turns and rifles through a stack of papers, finally

finding what he was looking for.

The cashier reaches under the register and pulls out an

IGLOO COOLER and hands it to Anna. She BEAMS.

Anna looks to Ben.   She looks like she's about to burst.

Ben can't tell if she's kidding.

7/20/7                                                   8.

Anna smiles wide, admiring her cooler.    Then -

Anna throws her arms around him and hugs him.

Ben can't help but laugh.

INT. NATIONAL BREWERY LOFTS - NIGHT

Conor enters his apartment.     ALEX sits on the couch

watching TV.

Conor heads for the kitchen, and turns back.

Conor returns from the kitchen with a beer.

7/20/7                                                      9.

Alex winces.

Alex shrugs.

Conor pulls off his jacket and tosses it next to a box -

which contains about 50 FRISBEES. On each frisbee:

A LARGE PICTURE OF CONOR, WITH HIS PHONE NUMBER AND THE

TITLE: CONOR BARRY REAL ESTATE AGENT

Conor dials his cell phone as he heads back to his room.

CLOSE ON:   A CELL PHONE.    IT READS "CONOR CALLING"

EXT. EDDIE'S OF ROLAND PARK - SAME

We TILT up to find Anna and Ben. Anna looks at her

phone, presses IGNORE and stashes it in her purse.

7/20/7                                                   10.

Ben opens his GUM and offers Anna a piece.     She takes one

and laughs, a bit embarrassed.

Anna digs through her purse to find a piece of paper.

She writes down her number, and holds it out to him. He

looks at it, contemplating. He doesn't take it.

Anna takes the slip of paper and puts it away.

Ben considers this.

FROM INSIDE A CAR PARKED AT THE STORE:

We see Anna and Ben talking.     They shake hands awkwardly

and Ben HEADS TOWARDS US.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

Ben gets in the car, bag in hand, and joins NEIL, 40,

arty and kind looking, who's behind the wheel.

7/20/7                                                      11.

Neil looks at him, smirk growing.

Neil starts the car and they pull away.

INT. WESTSIDE LOFT - NIGHT

Neil walks into a vast space. Nice art, a cozy yet

architectural look - a cool place to live.

We PAN over to a couch - where BETH is wrapped in a throw

blanket, watching TV. She's got her hair in a messy bun.

He joins her on the couch.        And sees that the TV is off.

Neil gets up again.

7/20/7                                                12.

Beth looks at him.    She doesn't look that happy.

He sits back down, puts his arms around her.

Beth manages a weak smile.

7/20/7                                                 13.

He exits. Beth starts to CRY, but quickly dries her

tears, and forces herself to pull it together.

EXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - MORNING

A brick row house in an up and coming neighborhood -

clearly under massive renovation.

INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - SAME

We make our way through rooms with plastic covering the

doorways - until we find JANINE stepping into the

hallway. She checks herself in a vintage mirror,

straightens it a tad, then heads down the stairs to find

GIGI, on her cell phone. Gigi slams it closed.

Gigi shakes her head.

Janine ponders this.

Gigi manages a small smile.

7/20/7                                                   14.

Gigi peers out the window.

Gigi makes a move for the phone, Janine stops her.

Off Gigi - panic seeping in.

FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:   ...IF HE'S NOT CALLING YOU

AMBER, pretty if a little thick in the middle, sits in

the courtyard of an office park in her work clothes.

7/20/7                                                15.

INT. GYM - DAY

Pilates class. We pan down the row of mats, STUDENTS

obediently doing The Mermaid. We finally land on Gigi's

mat: Gigi manages to twist herself into a passable

Mermaid - as her CELL PHONE lies in full view on her mat.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Shower is on, curtain pulled. A CELL PHONE RINGS. An

ARM SHOOTS out of the shower and grabs it from the sink.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gigi lays in bed, her CELL PHONE right next to her head.

One eye POPS OPEN, checks the phone, and closes again.

INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A typical, corporate style office. Walled off cubicles

for the junior execs, outer offices for management.

Gigi is in her cubicle. Janine, her friend and, we now

learn, co-worker, sits on Gigi's desk.

7/20/7                                                   16.

The girls look up to find BETH standing there, listening.

Beth heads to her office.   Janine and Gigi follow.

Janine, clearly organized, flips open her notebook:

Gigi stifles a laugh.

Beth looks at Gigi, more sympathetic friend than boss.

7/20/7                                                 17.

INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Gigi sits at her desk, Janine standing by her side.

She's got a few sheets of paper on her desk.

Gigi takes a deep breath, picks up the office phone and

dials. Janine gives her a thumbs up.

Gigi nods - it's all under control.

Gigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she

seems confused. She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing -

"What does this say?". Janine looks - she's no help.

7/20/7                                                   18.

Gigi hangs up, unsure.   She looks to Janine.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - LATER

Gigi stares at the PHONE. Then she feigns disinterest in

the phone. It still doesn't ring. Finally, she picks up

the receiver to listen for a dial tone. And PANICS.

She frantically jiggles the cord, then hears something.

She hangs up, stares at the phone again. A look of

DETERMINATION crosses her face. She dials.

Gigi hurriedly hangs up, and heads out the door.

INT. RED MAPLE - NIGHT

A CROWDED, SCENEY restaurant/bar - with a giant red

Japanese maple growing behind the bar (thus the name).

We follow a THIN, BLACK CLAD HOSTESS as we wind through

the throng of stylish twentysomethings at the bar to:

INT. RED MAPLE - KITCHEN - SAME

A busy kitchen.   Off the kitchen a door leads to:

INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - SAME

ALEX sits at a small, cluttered desk, rifling through

some papers. Then, from the doorway:

7/20/7                                                  19.

Alex looks up to see KELLI ANN - Red Maple's hot hostess,

standing in the doorway. She makes her way in.

She leans against the desk.     Alex keeps working.

Kelli Ann laughs, then thinks - wait, was that nice?

Alex stops what he's doing, looks up at her.

He goes back to work. Kelli Ann stands there, frozen.

Alex can feel her eyes on him.

Kelli Ann's face goes flush. She tries to hide it.    She

backs up, puts on a smile.

She leaves.   Alex exhales, goes back to work.

7/20/7                                                   20.

INT. RED MAPLE - LATER

In the back doorway leading to the alley, Alex stands

chatting with TYRONE, 18, a busboy, who smokes a

cigarette he holds just outside the doorway.

Kelli Ann approaches, trying to squeeze through, and

ACCIDENTALLY (ON PURPOSE) SHOULDER BLOCKS ALEX. HARD.

He has to take a step to catch his balance.

He turns around to see what happened, but Kelli Ann keeps

walking eyes front. He and Tyrone share a look.

Tyrone laughs as Alex shakes his head, not happy.

INT. RED MAPLE - HOSTESS STAND

Gigi enters slowly, looking around, searching for Conor.

She tries to move toward the bar as she's met by Kelli

Ann, who grabs a few menus and slaps on a smile.

Gigi continues to scan the place, not paying attention.

Gigi finishes her visual tour of the room - no Conor.

7/20/7                                                    21.

Gigi walks off.    Kelli Ann takes her place behind the

hostess stand.

AT THE BAR

Gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door.     Alex,

now behind the bar, approaches.

Alex takes her in.       She's clearly nervous.

Gigi is busted.

Alex reaches for the phone.

7/20/7                                                  22.

Alex waits, looking at Gigi, amused.    She is panicking.

Gigi frantically searches her coat pockets - searching

for something, anything - and finally fishes out A PEN.

She looks at it - and decides to go with it.

Alex looks at her skeptically.   And then takes the PEN,

and inspects it.

Gigi looks at Alex for a long moment, and finally folds.

Gigi struggles to get out quickly. Alex looks at her -

holding her pen, looking quite frazzled - and softens.

7/20/7                                                 23.

Gigi SMILES and sits back down.

INT. RED MAPLE - NIGHT

It's late. The bar is nearly empty. Alex is totaling

receipts - and Gigi is still nursing a drink.

7/20/7                                                 24.

Gigi thinks this over.

Alex LAUGHS.

Gigi smiles at him.

INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORP. HQ - DAY

Gigi comes in - carrying a MESSY HANDFUL OF PAPERS, with

crazy hair and wearing the last outfit we saw her in.

7/20/7                                                 25.

Beth comes out of her office and looks at Gigi.

INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORP. HQ - BETH'S OFFICE - DAY

Gigi paces in front of Beth's desk.

Gigi consults her crumpled pieces of paper.

7/20/7                                                  26.

Gigi sits down, spent.   But Beth has been listening.

Beth is serious.   Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack.

Off Beth, knowing it's about her, too.

INT. SASSY NAILS - EVENING

Anna and MARY, beautiful but doesn't know it, sit in side

by side pedicure chairs. Anna holds a BUSINESS CARD.

7/20/7                                                  27.

Anna pulls her feet out of the pedicure bath, goes in a

private corner, and dials her cell phone.

Anna waits for a response. On the other end she hears

some rustling, some silence, definitely awkwardness.

Anna takes this in - STUNNED. She hangs up. Her eyes

sting. She can't face Mary so she just stares at weird,

bleached out photos of nails and HOLDS BACK THE TEARS.

Finally, she looks at her cell phone and dials again.

INT. NATIONAL BREWERY LOFTS - NIGHT

Conor opens the door to find Anna standing there.

7/20/7                                                 28.

Conor buys it, and ushers her inside.

INT. NATIONAL BREWERY LOFTS - NIGHT

Anna is stretched out with a wine glass in hand, feet in

Conor's lap. He rubs her feet as they talk.

Conor smiles, happy for any compliment.

She bangs him on the head with a pillow.

7/20/7                                                29.

Anna sits up, and moves to Conor. She looks at him,

pulls him in for a nice, long HUG.

Anna gives him a knowing look.

Anna smiles and gets up. Conor reluctantly follows her

to the door. She KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS, smiles, and

leaves.

INT. WESTSIDE LOFT - NIGHT

Beth opens the door to find NEIL, standing on the couch

in his socks, hanging a PAINTING.

7/20/7                                                   30.

Beth is silent.

Neil laughs.

Beth tries to hold back her tears. Neil looks stunned.

He hops down off the couch and goes to her.

7/20/7                                                     31.

Neil looks at her.    She looks at him.

Beth looks at Neil.    There is a long, painful SILENCE.

She walks out of the room.

AMY sits with a sleeping baby in her arms.

INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Ben, our married guy from the grocery store, sits on the

floor in a barely furnished room, and dials his cell.

7/20/7                                                 32.

Ben hangs up. And STARES INTO SPACE until THE DOOR OPENS

TO REVEAL: JANINE. Gigi's co-worker. And Ben's WIFE.

Ben is CLEARLY STARTLED.

Janine looks at him.

She sits down next to him, looks at him intently.

Ben puts his arm around Janine, and pulls her close.

Janine contentedly curls up to Ben.

7/20/7                                                  33.

Janine gives Ben a knowing look.   He gets it.

Ben looks at her and LAUGHS.

Ben looks at her, snuggled against him.

Janine smiles CONTENTEDLY.

Ben LAUGHS.   She lets him.

INT. PORTER'S - EVENING

Packed, Federal Hill happy hour bar scene. Gigi and

Janine stand, squeezed in among the after work crowd.

JARRAD, early thirties, chats amiably with Gigi.

7/20/7                                                 34.

Janine and Gigi melt.

Gigi hands him her card with lightning speed.

Jarrad hands Gigi HIS CARD as well.

He starts to head over to his BUDDIES.   Gigi is confused.

Jarrad turns back.

He tries to take off again.

Jarrad just gives her a blank stare.

7/20/7                                                   35.

He takes off.   The girls watch him.

Gigi looks at the name on the card - JARRAD MONTROSE -

and then - TEARS HIS BUSINESS CARD IN TWO.

Off Gigi, sipping her drink, full of optimism.

INT. BALTIMORE BLADE - DAY

The offices of Baltimore's gay weekly paper. The

elevator opens - and in walks Mary, cheerful as always.

We follow her down the hall as she ad-libs hellos to her

co-workers. One thing becomes glaringly clear - SHE IS

THE ONLY WOMAN WHO WORKS HERE.

She gets to her desk and is descended upon by - BRUCE,

NATHAN, and JOSHUA. All mid-20's. All gay.

Mary looks at them, smiling, enjoying their impatience.

7/20/7                                                   36.

The guys all look skeptical.

The guys look at her, starting to understand.   Mary's

PHONE RINGS.

She smiles at the guys - they disperse as she picks up.

INTERCUT WITH EXT. LIGHT ST. - DAY

Conor sits on a bench, NEWSPAPER folded open on his lap.

7/20/7                                                  37.

Conor looks at the paper.

Conor leaves the paper and gets up. He walks away, still

on the phone, we STAY WITH THE NEWSPAPER AND WE PUSH IN.

Everyone FREEZES.    And looks at BETH.   Big silence.

This is clearly news.

But before Beth can even answer --

7/20/7                                                  39.

Beth grabs her purse and starts for the door.

Beth exits, still wearing a half-sewn bridesmaid's dress.

The girls nod in agreement.

INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

Ben sits behind his desk, sifting through a pile of

papers. We PAN around to Anna sitting across from him.

7/20/7                                               40.

He looks at her.

7/20/7                                                   41.

Anna takes this in.

INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - DAY

Janine walks in from work to her construction site home.

She peeks into the dining room, where she sees her CHERRY

WOOD DINING TABLE covered in a THICK LAYER OF DUST.

She waits for a response. Nothing.    She starts to brush

the dust off with her hands.

Still nothing. So Janine drops her work things, and

heads out the side door of the house to a STORAGE AREA.

EXT. STORAGE AREA - DAY

There are cans of paint, bags of cement, some tarps.

Janine grabs a TARP, when she sees, on a window ledge,

next to a folding chair - AN ALUMINUM FOIL ASHTRAY.

CIGARETTE BUTTS. AN EMPTY PACK OF AMERICAN SPIRITS.

She stares at them for a moment, then heads back inside.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - DAY

CLOSE ON: A TORN BUSINESS CARD, TAPED BACK TOGETHER. The

name on the card is JARRAD MONTROSE. Gigi sits, staring

at the card. She reaches for the phone, and then thinks

the better of it. And again.

Finally, she grabs the receiver, picks it up, and dials.

INTERCUT WITH:   INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - DAY

Alex sits in his office.    He talks into his CELL.

Tyrone appears in Alex's doorway.

Tyrone points to a VERY SMALL WHITE INSIGNIA on an

otherwise BLACK SHIRT. Alex shuts the door on him.

Gigi hangs up, re-tears up Jarrad's card.

EXT. DUNDALK HOME - BACKYARD - DAY

CLOSE ON:   HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM written across a CAKE.

As the candles are blown out, we widen to reveal: Anna

and Conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny

backyard, across from MAYA - Anna's mom.

As Maya refills her glass from a BOTTLE OF WINE, Anna

grabs a GIFT from her bag - hands it to her mom.

Maya takes a BIG SIP OF WINE (not her first) as she tears

open the gift, which is clearly a RECORD ALBUM.

Maya shows him the album - TIM BUCKLEY'S STARSAILOR.

Anna takes the album and heads through the screen door.

7/20/7                                                   45.

"Song to the Siren" plays as Anna returns to the table.

Maya pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

Anna just looks at her - pleadingly.

Anna goes inside.   Maya looks to Conor, takes a sip.

She leans back, puts out her cigarette as Anna returns

with A PICTURE. She hands it to Conor.

INSERT: MAYA, in her early twenties. Black and white -

somewhere in New York. The resemblance to Anna is scary.

7/20/7                                                     46.

Conor looks down at the picture, then back up to Anna.

He looks from Maya to Anna.     Maya stands up.

With that, Maya heads inside.

Anna looks to Conor apologetically.    He just smiles.

EXT. ANNA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Anna gives him a smile, opens her front door.

She gives him a KISS, and goes inside.

FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:...IF HE/SHE'S NOT SLEEPING WITH YOU

find Conor standing there. He's wearing a REALLY TIGHT,

Leather couch, framed Orioles jersey - typical bachelor

deftly.

Anna LAUGHS, and then dunks her head under the water.

INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ben comes in the front door, drops his gym bag. Janine

She looks at him.    He tries to coolly meet her gaze.

Ben walks away.    Off Janine, wanting to believe him.

smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out

Ben looks at Neil as if he's crazy.

Neil takes a drag and looks out over the harbor.

INT. BO BROOKS CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT

We PAN down one of the long tables to find Beth, SMACKING

a crab with a mallet. HARD. AND LOUD. The others at

the table turn to look at her, annoyed. And that's when

we see - there seems to be a party and SPEECH underway.

Beth's sister, Paige, smiles.

7/20/7                                                57.

The cousin WINKS at Beth.   Beth goes white.

KEN MURPHY, 60s, nearly tramples guests to grab the mic.

Mixed reaction from the crowd as Ken puts the mic down.

He starts to return to his table - when he sees Beth

trying to make a sneaky exit. He catches up to her.

Ken laughs and puts his arm around Beth.

7/20/7                                                   58.

7/20/7                                                59.

Gigi is disappointed. The waitress drops off their

drinks. They toast - then observe the SCENE AT THE BAR.

The GIRL is standing between TWO GUYS.

As if on cue, Tom Cruise Guy BANGS his elbow into the

GIRL, hard, causing her to spill her drink. Tom Cruise

Guy sees, but doesn't acknowledge. Alex looks smug.

7/20/7                                                60.

She's busted.

7/20/7                                                  61.

INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - MORNING

Janine walks down the hallway, with JAVIER (40, stocky),

Janine looks at Javier.    It's awkwardly silent.

She's starting to freak Javier out.

Janine does not hear him, and barrels on -

7/20/7                                                   63.

Javier starts to leave.

Blank stare from Javier.    Janine slaps on a smile.

Javier gives a forced smile, and heads back to work.

INT. MT. VERNON ROW HOUSE - DAY

TWO WELL BUILT MEN (SKIP and LARRY) sip from bottles of

Volvic water as they wander through a kitchen, inspecting

the cabinetry. Conor comes into to frame, wearing a

toned down version of his "gay friendly" clothes.

He gestures to a guest book on the kitchen island - next

to which Anna stands. Conor joins her.

The house is TEEMING WITH GAY COUPLES - opening closets,

admiring floors, munching on complimentary cookies.

7/20/7                                                   64.

Conor goes in for a HUG, but Anna's not ready for it - so

he just ends up grabbing her. It's awkward. She leaves,

Conor tries to play it off, looks around the room.

Skip and Larry look at him sympathetically.

Conor looks at them, decides not to fight it.

Skip and Larry move closer, Larry grabs a plate.

7/20/7                                                   65.

He looks at Larry.   Larry looks back at him.    They don't

break their gaze.

Skip look at Larry again.   Larry meets his gaze.

Skip looks at Larry, concerned.

Conor takes this in - that's not a bad idea.

7/20/7                                                  66.

INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Cute studio apartment. And Ben is in the bed. Anna

walks in from the bathroom, in a robe. Ben watches her.

Anna BEAMS.   She joins him in bed.

She looks at Ben.    He's not smiling.

He waits.

7/20/7                                                 67.

Anna thinks.

They look at each other for a LONG MOMENT.

Anna's eyes light up, but she tries to cover.

As Ben pulls her to him, she lets a smile take hold.

each finger, calmly looks up at Mary.

Gigi considers this.

7/20/7                                                 71.

Gigi smiles.

A CRASH outside Alex's office.

Gigi hangs up, and goes back to watching her movie.

CLOSE ON: The TV screen as Mary Stuart Masterson (as

WATTS) and Eric Stoltz (as KEITH) hang out in a garage.

Gigi sits up. A light bulb has gone off. As she watches

Keith and Watts kiss on screen, a smile crosses her face.

INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Gigi blows in, dumps her things and turns to Janine:

7/20/7                                               72.

7/20/7                                                 73.

7/20/7                                                   74.

all looking at her computer screen.

Nathan hands her the phone.

Mary cradles the receiver with her shoulder and dials.

Mary is clearly charmed.    The gays all SWOON.

The other guys shush him.

7/20/7                                                   75.

BEEP.    Mary BEAMS.

Mary basks in the attention.       Then, ANOTHER BEEP.

All heads whip around at stare at the SPEAKER PHONE.

SOME RUSTLING NOISES, and a HANG UP, followed by a dial

tone. Mary stares at the phone - then pushes a BUTTON.

They all head wordlessly back to work.

INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY

CLOSE ON: TWO SEEMINGLY IDENTICAL PLANKS OF WOOD. We

pull back to reveal Ben and Janine, in the wide aisle of

Home Depot, as Janine really studies the two pieces of

wood. Finally, she POINTS to one of them.

Janine considers this.

7/20/7                                                   76.

Ben is making light.   But Janine is all business.

Ben takes this in.   His cheeks start to burn.

As she starts to steer their giant cart away, Ben just

stands there, fused to the ground. Finally:

Janine stops, doesn't say anything.

She doesn't turn to face him.     Total silence.

7/20/7                                               77.

Janine turns to Ben.    She is IRATE.

Janine just STARES AT HIM, FUMING.

Now Janine's eyes go wide with disbelief.

Ben looks confused, but is trying to roll with it.

7/20/7                                                  78.

She heads down the aisle with the cart. Ben follows,

confused - that didn't go how he thought it would.

EXT. GRAMERCY MANSION - DAY

The lush grounds surrounding a beautiful turn-of-the-

century mansion. The procession of a wedding has just

begun. TWO ADORABLE FLOWER GIRLS start things off.

Then Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with

her husband, STEVEN. Beth's sister Catherine and her

husband GEORGE are next. Big smiles all around.

Then Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort

- BUDDY, a 12 year old CHOCOLATE LAB, wearing a coral bow

tie. Beth forces a smile as she processes with Buddy -

who stops to piss on a chair leg. Beth is not happy.

INT. GRAMERCY MANSION - DAY

A lavish reception. Beth takes her seat next to DAN,

40s. Dan looks over at Beth's place card.

7/20/7                                                  79.

Beth slaps on a fake smile, and grabs for the wine.

INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A PARTY is in full swing. Typical affair for someone in

their late 20's - mediocre food but decent alcohol.

Gigi stands, somewhat uncomfortably, near the Chex Mix.

She tries smiling at a TALL GIRL, who ignores her. So

Gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls

of Chex Mix into her mouth.

Gigi looks up to see Nathan and Bruce - Mary's gay

coworkers who are now decked out in full-on Saturday

night gay mode - standing next to her.

Gigi puts her handful of Chex Mix back.

7/20/7                                                 80.

Gigi LAUGHS.

She cups her hand and surreptitiously checks her breath.

Gigi smiles in recognition.

Suddenly, a look of DOUBT sweeps across Gigi's face.

She reflexively GRABS FOR THE CHEX MIX and starts gorging

on it again. Nathan stops her.

7/20/7                                                  81.

He reaches in his pocket.    Gigi looks at him gratefully.

INT. GRAMERCY MANSION - NIGHT

Dinner is over. The dance floor is crowded. The bride,

Paige, is out there. Beth's dad is dancing with her mom.

Beth's dad gives Beth a wink as she heads onto to the

dance floor with DOMINIC, 50s and fat.

They continue to dance.

Beth swats Dominic on the arm, and he laughs. And then

they are distracted by a COMMOTION ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

Everyone has stopped dancing. They are looking to the

floor, near the band. Beth pushes her way through to see-

HER DAD. HE HAS FALLEN TO HIS KNEES. HE'S CLUTCHING HIS

CHEST. AND HIS FACE IS TURNING AN ASHY, TERRIFYING GRAY.

7/20/7                                                 82.

INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The place is packed. Gigi is smashed into a hallway,

trying to look relaxed. Alex comes up behind her.

Gigi turns to him and smiles.

Gigi smiles knowingly - on to Alex's scam.

Alex doesn't know how to take that.

He looks at the FOOD TABLE.     Everything is empty.

Gigi LOOKS ELATED.   Alex looks CONFUSED.

7/20/7                                                   83.

He walks away.   Gigi smiles BIG.

INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER

The party is now even more crowded. Gigi weaves her way

through the crowd. She's deftly holding SIX DRINKS,

passing them off to various people as she walks.

She stops at the food table, rearranges a few bowls.

She CATCHES ALEX'S EYE across the room, he's talking to

friends. She smiles and gives a THUMBS UP. He gives an

awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation.

INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

Gigi is in the kitchen, mixing up some DIP. She chats

with a couple of PARTY-GOERS, very much at home.

An attractive TALL GIRL enters the kitchen, and starts

LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS. Gigi watches with interest.

The Tall Girl finds a BOWL in the cabinet, and grabs it.

She brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts

emptying Gigi's dip into the bowl. Gigi is THROWN.

7/20/7                                                   84.

Gigi's face grows red.   The Tall Girl tastes the dip.

Then the Tall Girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and

heads back out to the party. Gigi looks to the confused

party-goers, not pleased.

INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - LATER

Bruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave. People are

getting coats - the crowd is definitely thinning.

Gigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline.

Alex looks at the toaster oven and laughs.

Then, the TALL GIRL emerges.

Gigi STARES DAGGERS AT HER.

The tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a

trash bag. Gigi grabs one, too. Alex looks mystified.

7/20/7                                                  85.

INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - STILL LATER

It is really late. Everyone's gone - except the TALL

GIRL and ALEX, who sit on the couch playing a NBA LIVE on

the XBOX. Gigi enters from the kitchen.

The tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game.

Gigi stands there awkwardly.

They ignore her.   She looks around.    It's awkward.

Alex tosses down his controller.

The tall girl beams.   Gigi flinches.

Gigi suppresses a SMILE. The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug,

and heads out. Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next

to him on the couch. They're silent for a moment.

7/20/7                                                 86.

But then -- before Alex knows what's happening, Gigi is

LUNGING at him. She puts his face in her hands, and

starts to KISS HIM. REALLY KISS HIM. Finally, Gigi

pulls away. She looks breathless.

Alex looks a little afraid.

She goes in to kiss him again.   This time he stops her.

Alex gets up off the couch.

She trails off.   Alex is not pleased.

7/20/7                                                87.

Alex doesn't even hear her.

Gigi stands there, embarrassed, taking Alex's berating.

Gigi grabs her bag.

Gigi turns and heads out the door.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gigi looks at the phone, and then finally DIALS.

7/20/7                                                 88.

Gigi hangs up, lays on the bed, snaps off the light.

INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DAY

Ken Murphy, Beth's dad, lies in bed, in a Notre Dame

sweatshirt, with papers, and books surrounding him. Beth

clears his breakfast dishes off of the bed.

Ken looks at her, with a wry smile.

Beth takes his dirty dishes and heads for the door.

7/20/7                                                89.

INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DEN - SAME

Beth hauls the dishes downstairs and through the den

where Steven, Laura's husband, is on the couch, intently

watching the golf channel.

Beth rolls her eyes.

Beth just keeps on walking.

INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

Beth walks by Paige, on the couch, and DEVON, Paige's new

husband, on the floor, surrounded by a mess of VINYL

RECORDS. He has an old BOBBY DARIN tune BLARING.

Both Devon and Paige look at her, stunned.

INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME

The kitchen is a total MESS. Beth sets the dishes down

in a precarious pile of other dishes, and sees her

sisters Laura and Catherine at the kitchen table.

7/20/7                                                  90.

Beth looks up. Laura is pointing to Catherine, who has

her head in her hands. She's CRYING SOFTLY.

Beth rolls her eyes.    The DISHES crash in the sink.

INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Janine sits at Beth's desk, across from Gigi, who stares

at her in disbelief. Janine fiddles with a TILE SAMPLE.

7/20/7                                                 91.

Gigi is clearly STUNG.

A BEAT.   Janine looks at Gigi, the tears come.

She looks down at the TILE in her hand.

7/20/7                                                 92.

Janine grabs her purse, heads out as Gigi looks on.

a yacht in what looks to be the French Riviera.

INT. LAW OFFICES - HALLWAY -   EVENING

Anna SQUEEZES Ben's hand as they stride down the hallway

to his office. Anna is trying to suppress a smile.

Ben smoothly EXTRICATES his hand from Anna's.   He nods to

COWORKERS as they pass.

7/20/7                                                 93.

Ben smiles at Anna, as they round the corner of the

corridor to his office. He goes in, and she follows.

INT. BEN'S OFFICE - EVENING

Ben deftly shuts and locks the door behind them.

Ben smiles, and pulls Anna to him.

With that, they start to KISS. It gets heated. CLOTHES

START TO COME OFF. MOSTLY ANNA'S. They make their way

over to the LEATHER SOFA.

Anna smiles at the compliment. She starts to work on his

shirt when: SOMEONE TRIES TO OPEN THE LOCKED DOOR.

Ben continues to remove his shirt as he talks.

BEN FREEZES.    Literally freezes on top of Anna.

7/20/7                                                94.

Ben FRANTICALLY puts his hands over Anna's mouth. Then,

working with speed and precision, he GATHERS ALL OF

ANNA'S THINGS and shoves her - NAKED - into the CLOSET.

There isn't enough room to stand, so she has to sit. She

looks up at Ben, he closes the closet door.

He goes to the door of the office.

Ben re-buttons his shirt, gives the office a once over.

Finally, Ben opens the door, and Janine is standing

there, smiling.

She makes a show of CLOSING AND LOCKING THE DOOR.

Ben goes to sit behind his desk, confused.

Janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at

his desk chair. Her skirt is way too long to do this, so

she has to regroup, and hike up the skirt. Ben glances

over at the closet.

7/20/7                                                   95.

Ben picks up some papers, but Janine is not giving up.

Janine looks at Ben.   Ben is SILENT.

INT. BEN'S OFFICE - CLOSET - SAME

Anna sits, holding back tears, as she listens closely.

Then a ZIPPER OPENING, a chair CREAKING -

We HOLD ON Anna as she sits there, stonefaced.

INT. RED MAPLE - BAR - EARLY EVENING

Alex has the staff (of about 10) assembled for the pre-

shift meeting. He consults a clipboard as he talks.

The staff looks at each other - perplexed.

Alex rifles through his papers, not sure what he's

looking for. He slams his clipboard on the bar.

7/20/7                                                 96.

The group voice their opinions - a resounding "NO".

The group disperses, Alex heads around the bar.   He sees

Kelli Ann walking away and calls after her.

Kelli Ann starts to turn away as she sees Alex grab his

cell phone, look at it, then put it down. He grabs a

beer, takes a swig - then grabs his cell phone again -

staring at it, willing it to ring. He puts it down

again. A HUGE SMILE grows on Kelli Ann's face.

Alex takes his beer and heads down the bar.

7/20/7                                                        97.

Alex stops at the office door.

Alex looks at Kelli Ann, her words settling in.

Kelli Ann smiles, and as she walks away -

Alex takes this in, KNOWING SHE'S RIGHT.

INT. BEN'S OFFICE - EVENING

Janine, now fully dressed, hovers by the door.       Ben is

back at his desk, eyes on his computer.

Janine is clearly flailing.      She starts to go.

She looks at Ben.    He has no choice.

7/20/7                                                    98.

Janine leaves. As soon as she's gone, Ben gets up, shuts

the office door - and goes to the closet - when the door

FLIES OPEN IN HIS FACE - NEARLY SMASHING HIM.

Anna pulls her clothes back on in a FURY.

He puts out a hand to try to touch her.    She RECOILS.

Anna storms out.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Gigi sits on her couch, a pile of BILLS in her lap - most

of which say LATE, OVERDUE, etc. She's on the PHONE.

A CALL WAITING BEEP.

Gigi CLICKS OVER.

7/20/7                                                99.

Gigi lets this sink in.

She puts on a smile.

INT. DUNDALK HOUSE - DAY

Anna stands in the cluttered kitchen of her mom's house.

She writes out a CHECK, leaves it on the counter. She

looks to the living room, where Maya sleeps on the couch.

She watches her for a second, struggling with a blanket,

before heading over to her. She crouches next to the

couch, helps her adjust the blanket.

Maya opens her eyes and looks up at her, smiling.

Maya closes her eyes again. Anna sits there, watching

her. Anna's eyes start to fill with tears - quietly, she

begins crying. Maya finally notices.

Maya struggles to sit up and hug her. Anna sits next to

her on the couch, still trying to get it together.
