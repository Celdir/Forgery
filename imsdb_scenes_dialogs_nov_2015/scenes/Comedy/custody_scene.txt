CHAOS. A RAPPING of a gavel and Rick's attention swings to a

white haired JUDGE (70's).

The noise level wanes, but not completely. Another RAP of the

gavel.

Focused on the Judge, Rick doesn't notice THE PROSECUTOR

approaching from stage right.

Carrying a folding chair in one hand, notes and manila

folders in the other, he sets the chair behind Rick.

There's no guessing, Mr. Stevens,

either you're responsible for

siring offspring or you aren't.

I am, but I'm not sure it was

responsible.

A crime of passion, Mr. Stevens?

How convenient.

And you accept the consequences of

said actions?

Why am I here?

Why are you here, Mr. Stevens? Why

are you here? I'll tell you why

you're here. Are you familiar with

Ms. Cynthia Stevens?

Yeah, she's my wife.

Was your wife, Sir. Was your wife.

She recently filed for divorce.

Were you aware of that?

No, no I wasn't.

Well, she did. She also named you

as her coconspirator in the act of

having children. Were you aware of

that, Mr. Stevens?

Again, no.

Mr. Stevens, you just told the

court that you aware you had

children. You have also admitted

that Ms. Cynthia Stevens was, in

fact, your wife.

him with each step.
