EXT. RUDY'S - NIGHT

It's New Year's Eve at Rudy's, a hole-in-the-wall dive.

People stream into the bar to celebrate. Outside, CARL

KENDALL (30s) and his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend KATH are

having a quiet intense discussion.

Carl hugs her.

INT. RUDY'S - MOMENTS LATER

Rudy's is a dive bar. Dartboard, pool table, scuffed wooden

floors, Miller Lite sign, etc. The patrons are all FACING

THE GIANT TELEVISION. The New Year's Ball is DROPPING.

Among the patrons is our hero Carl, his best friend PETER,

Peter's girlfriend LUCY, their party friend ROONEY and his ex-

girlfriend, Kath who's still a little red-eyed.

Everyone BLOWS NOISEMAKERS and POPS CHAMPAGNE.

Carl leaves.   His friends look concerned.

INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Carl goes into his apartment. He lies down in his bed and

closes his eyes. CLOSE ON THE ALARM. His alarm goes off.

Carl HITS IT off. It's now DAYTIME.

INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carl gets dressed.   He puts on a nametag for Southwest Bank.

EXT. CARL'S APARTMENT

Carl walks down the street, fast. He passes a CUTE GIRL

who's name we'll learn is RENEE passing out flyers for a band

called "The Flying Buttresses."

He walks into Dunkin Donuts.

INT. DUNKIN DONUTS

The Dunkin Donuts Cashier hands Carl his coffee.

INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LATER

Carl sits at his cubicle, flips on his email.

NORMAN, his needy boss, comes up to him.

Carl looks at his calendar.   It's totally empty.

INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOBBY

Carl stands in the middle of the floor staring into the

middle distance. A CUSTOMER approaches him.

Beat.

The Bank Customer sits down in the sectioned off waiting area

as Carl stands in the middle of the floor. It is very

awkward. No one comes in. Carl slowly moves so a column

blocks the customer's view of him.

Now that Carl's behind the column, he has a clear view of the

entrance of the bank. Through the floor to ceiling windows,

he sees the handsome NEW PRESIDENT OF SOUTHWEST BANK, CHRIS

PARKER, tear up in a Mercedes. He steps out of the Mercedes

with a hot girl on his arm. He and the girl walk into the

bank. Carl stares at them, jealously.

Chris turns to Carl.

Chris Parker and his HOT SECRETARY leaves.     Carl watches

them, clearly jealous.

The Bank Customer comes around.

Carl indicates Norman.   Norman goes to help the customer.

INT. SOUTHWEST BANK

Carl stares up at the clock.   The clock finally CLICKS TO

5:00PM.

INT. CARL'S KITCHEN

Carl warms up a frozen pizza.

INT. CARL'S APARTMENT

Carl eats the frozen pizza and watches Big Brother.

INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM

-- ON THE STREET. Carl refuses the pamphlet.

-- IN SOUTHWEST BANK

-- CLOSE ON THE CLOCK.      IT FLIPS TO 5:00.

Carl eats frozen lasagna while watching The Amazing Race.

THE IMAGES START TO MOVE FASTER:

-- CARL IN DUNKIN DONUTS.

-- CARL AT SOUTHWEST BANK TALKING TO NORMAN.

THE CLOCK FLIPPING TO 5:00.

-- CARL AT HOME EATING FROZEN MEATLOAF AND WATCHING Project

Runway.

-- CARL WAKING UP.

-- CARL SHAKING HIS HEAD `NO.'

-- THE CLOCK FLIPPING TO 5:00.

-- CARL'S HEAD HITTING THE BED.

-- THE ALARM GOING OFF.

It's now just a blur of images of Carl at Southwest Bank,

shaking his head `no', eating Lean Cuisine and watching

reality television.

INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM - NIGHT

Carl's lying on his bed.      The phone is ringing.   He gets up

and answers.

Carl looks at the alarm.     It's 11:15 PM.

TITLES UP: THE YES MAN

Carl lies down and hangs up the phone.

CUT TO LATER

Carl watches his alarm clock FLIP TO 12:00AM.     He closes his

eyes and goes to sleep.

EXT. SOUTHWEST BANK

Carl's eating lunch at a picnic table outside. Several bank

employees smoke cigarettes near him. An oddly hyper guy

named ALEX approaches Carl.

Alex hugs Carl.

Alex hands Carl a pamphlet for a "Just Say Yes" seminar.

Alex starts WHIPPING rocks at the bank.

Norman comes out.

Alex continues throwing rocks at the bank.

A couple portly security guards come out and wrestle Alex to

the ground. He manages to escape and run from the bank.

INT. CARL'S APARTMENT

Carl walks into his apartment.    He hits PLAY on his answering

machine.

INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - LATER

Carl's watching Hell's Kitchen and eating a frozen pizza.

There's a knock on the door. The "Just Say Yes" pamphlet

balled up on his desk. He's using it as a napkin. Carl

PAUSES the television show. He stands up and opens the door.

Peter STUMBLES IN.

You're watching Hell's Kitchen.

That's not even B-list reality TV.

So I don't want to go out tonight.

Maybe I have to wake up early

tomorrow. You don't know.

It's bigger than that. You and

Kath broke up over a year ago and

you still aren't dating anyone.

What? So? I'm like a sexual

camel. I only need it once every

couple years.

I don't mean to be harsh but

everyone's moving forward. It's

like you're still wearing a Timex

while the rest of us each have

entry level Rolexes.

You wear a Rolex?

Thanks for noticing. It's an

Oyster Perpetual Yachtmaster.

Sapphire crystal, self-winding.

Four Gs. But that's not the point

I'm trying to make.

So I don't have an oyster watch.

All you and Lucy and Kath do is sit

around and talk about real estate

and Crate and Barrel.

What's wrong with Crate and Barrel?

They have adorable stuff at

reasonable prices.

Forget Crate and Barrel. Maybe I'm

just getting more mature. I don't

need the lifestyle ever night.

Lifestyle? You have to have a life

to have a style of life. You never

leave your apartment. You never

meet anyone new.

I hate meeting people.

You've become a complete cave

dweller.

I am not a cave dweller. Just the

other day, we all went to

Summerfest and snuck backstage and

you bet me I wouldn't steal

something and so I stole a

drumstick from that horrible

Swedish hillbilly band. That's not

very cave dweller of me.

Just the other day?   That was seven

years ago.

But that's not possible -- I was

already working at the bank by

then.

You had started there three years

earlier. Why you've worked at that

place for so long is beyond me.

You had so much potential. You

shouldn't be a teller. You should

be the guy who tells the guy who

tells the teller what to do.

I've been a teller at Southwest

Bank for ten years? How the hell

did that happen?

Ten years... if I had had a child,

he'd be toilet-trained by now.

Actually, he'd be in fourth grade.

Carl pushes Peter out the door. Carl sits down on the couch.

He then unballs the "Just Say Yes" pamphlet. It features an

Indian man smiling beatifically.

INT. HOLIDAY INN CONFERENCE ROOM

A banner across a stage that has a photo of the same Indian

man smiling beatifically. We PAN DOWN to find Carl among the

crowd. Carl sits down next to a WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN.

Carl heads over to the refreshment table. Once he's out of

her sight, he sits down alone in a corner of the conference

room. Ethereal music begins to play over the loudspeakers.

People begin to sit. Carl sits down in the back.

Carl laughs.   No one else does.   The lights get rosier.

Carl looks around.   Everyone is nodding along with it.

The music ABRUPTLY SWITCHES to the opening beats of "Jump" by

the Pointer Sisters. The rosy colored lights FLIP TO BRIGHT

WHITE and SWEEP ACROSS THE CONVENTION CENTER ROOM. It is

suddenly like a rock concert. SANJI (50s) BUSTS THROUGH THE

GIANT BANNER. The whole crowd starts CHEERING.

Instead of "Jump", Sanji's yelling "Yes!"

Sanji pumps his fist in the air as lame indoor fireworks GO

OFF. The crowd JUMPS ON THEIR FEET.

The crowd quiets.

The woman POINTS AT Carl.      The spotlight SWINGS OVER to Carl.

He is annoyed.

Sanji runs off the stage and joins Carl in the back of the

conference hall. The spotlights follow him.

The crowd laughs.

Carl nods, surprised at Sanji's incisiveness.

Sanji's suddenly getting to Carl. As Sanji talks to him, the

moment between them becomes more and more intimate. It

should feel like the rest of the crowd has disappeared.

Sanji snaps.

Sanji grabs Carl hand and PULLS HIM to his feet.   We PULL

BACK and the crowd CHEERS.

Fireworks and confetti go off.    The Wiry, Anxious Woman Gives

Carl a creepy thumbs up.

INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Carl's asleep. The phone starts ringing.     Carl sleepily

grabs the phone.

FLASH OF SANJI LOOMING LARGE IN CARL'S EYES.

BACK TO CARL AND PETER.       We CLOSE IN ON CARL'S MOUTH.

EXT. STACKERS - MORNING

of people to sit down for brunch.

The Waitress comes up.

A group of four people get up to be seated.

Carl walks up to the Waitress.

Meanwhile, the customers the Waitress was going to seat are

looking away, trying not to get involved.

Peter pulls Carl away from the Waitress.

One of the customers who was being seated heads over.

Carl and the Brunch Dude punch fists and hug.

INT. STACKERS - LATER

Carl and his friends are sitting at a table.    Carl's slightly

bored as his friends discuss real estate.

The Brunch Dude is seated near Carl. He gives him a thumbs

up. Carl gives a thumbs up right back.

The Waitress comes over.

Beat.

Beat.

The Waitress writes that down.

Carl's friends look at him like a freak.

His friends are all looking at Carl.

INT. STACKERS

Carl has six dishes in front of him.     The Waitress comes over

with a pepper mill.

The Waitress starts grinding pepper onto Carl's meal. It's

starting to take a long time. She's grinding and grinding

and grinding.

She keeps grinding.    A pile of pepper's growing on his food.

INT. STACKERS - LATER

All of Carl's food is covered piles of pepper.

Carl takes a bite of Lucy's.      He then sips his coffee.

Carl's phone rings.   He answers it.

Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.

Beat.

The confused Dunkin Donuts cashier loads up Carl's coffee.

several boxes of Munchkins. He walks by Renee, the cute girl

who hands out band fliers.

Renee holds out her hand.

Carl turns away, nervous that he's accepted her invitation.

He takes a sip of his giant coffee and grimaces.

INT. SOUTHWEST BANK

Carl STUMBLES INTO work, hyper from the giant coffee.

Instantly Carl's cubicle is surrounded by fellow workers.

INT. SOUTHWEST BANK LOUNGE

Carl's greeting.   A MIDDLE-AGED MOTHERLY CUSTOMER comes in.

Beat.

INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK

Carl's trying to keep up as the customer launches into

intense finance-speak.

The woman hands over a scrapbook that's been decorated with

construction paper and pictures of beanie babies. Carl opens

the scrapbook. It's filled with numbers.

Carl gets up and walks over to Norman.

ANGLE ON NORMAN'S OFFICE

Carl stands before Norman.

Norman grabs the business plan and starts reading it.

ANGLE ON LOAN DESK

Carl sits back down.

Carl gets up. He heads over to the soda machine and buys a

Diet Coke. He then heads over to Norman's desk.

They clink Diet Cokes. Norman DOWNS his entire Diet Coke in

one swallow. Carl then heads over to the photocopier. He

watches Norman out of the corner of his eye. After a couple

minutes, Norman gets up and HEADS INTO THE BATHROOM. Carl

heads back over to Norman's desk and SWIPES THE LOAN APPROVAL

STAMP.

ANGLE ON THE LOAN DESK

Carl returns to the loan desk and STAMPS HER FORM.

The Bank Customer HUGS Carl.

The Bank Customer hands Carl a panda beanie baby.

Carl walks in the door. Peter, Lucy and Rooney, who's

clearly been there for a little while, comes up to him.

Rooney looks at Peter and Lucy.

Rooney picks up his beer and begins pounding the twenty

ouncer. Carl reluctantly pounds it as well. Rooney slams

his on the table. Carl puts it on the table.

Carl's a little drunk now.

Peter and Lucy laugh, not realizing that Carl is serious.

They leave.

girls.

Yes.                               I think I'm done.

Carl downs the jello shot.     He stumbles a little.

Carl STUMBLES over to the Senor Frog's DJ.     He's losing

control and he likes it.

MUSIC CUE: The opening notes of White Town's "Your Woman"

Carl grabs the microphone and heads out into the crowd.

(NOTE TO READER: As you read this part, I recommend listening

to White Town's "Your Woman." It will bring it to life in a

way that words on a page cannot do it justice.)

Carl heads over to the HOT GIRL and begins SERENADING HER.

She thinks it's kind of funny.

Carl gets really close to the Hot Girl's face and then COYLY

pulls away for the bridge of the song. During the awesome

bridge, Carl does some fantastic dance moves. Or rather,

moves that you think are fantastic when you're drunk out of

your mind. The Hot Girl laughs at his antics.

Carl lands on one knee in front of the Hot Girl. The crowd

CHEERS FOR HIM. The Hot Girl's LARGE BOYFRIEND gets up close

to Carl. Everyone is very, very drunk.

Beat. Carl doesn't really know what to do so he slaps him

across the face the way a woman would slap a man.

The Brutish Boyfriend PUNCHES Carl in the head.

Carl HEADBUTTS the guy. They get into a dirty, drunken

tussle. Both of them are trying to hit the other one in the

groin region. Bouncers DESCEND ON THEM and PULL THEM APART.

EXT. SENOR FROG'S

Carl and Rooney are outside.    Carl's nursing his wounds.

They are very, very drunk.

The Hot Girl STUMBLES out of Senor Frog's.

The Hot Girl KISSES Carl.

INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Light is streaming in through the window. Carl opens his

finishing getting dressed.

Carl signs the Maniyesto.

Carl signs again.

Carl signs again.

Carl holds out his hand. Sanji PULLS OUT an iron brand

that's been heating over a hot pot and BRANDS CARL'S PALM.

Carl looks at his palm.       In the center of the palm, Sanji's

branded a `YES.'

INT. RUDY'S

Carl is sitting across from Peter.

Peter and Carl shake hands.

Lucy comes over and kisses Peter.

Peter turns to Carl, smiling.

Lucy hugs Carl. Carl looks over Lucy's shoulder at Peter and

shakes his head. Rooney comes over.

Rooney points to FOUR BARFLIES sitting at the bar.

Peter turns to Carl.

Carl walks up to the bar.     Peter's snickering behind him.

INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Carl wakes up.   He looks at the tattooed "Yes" on his hand.

INT. DUNKIN DONUTS

Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.    Before the cashier can say

anything...

Carl turns to see a giant poster with the words "DO YOU WANT

A MOCHA CARAMEL COOLATA?" Carl turns back to the cashier.

EXT. STREET

Carl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a frozen coffee

drink and several boxes of Munchkins. He walks by Renee and

wordlessly takes a flier.

As he walks away...

INT. SOUTHWEST BANK

Carl sits at his cubicle, and flips on his email. In the

background, we see various SUPER HAPPY EMPLOYEES eating the

INT. THE NOTE BAR AND PERFORMANCE SPACE - NIGHT

Carl stands at the back of a basically empty dive bar,

nursing a beer. There's a makeshift stage at the front of

the bar. "The Flying Buttresses" are setting up their

equipment, including a giant clear plastic harp. Renee steps

up to the microphone.

Their four audience members cheer. The drummer bangs his

sticks together and the band launches in. They are terrible.

Like really terrible. Renee sings in a high-pitched voice

that she probably thinks sounds like Tori Amos, but sounds

more like a dog whistle. If you've heard the singer, Joanna

Newsom, well that's who she's emulating.

Carl looks at the three other audience members. They are

nodding along. Also, one of them is dressed like a Court

Jester.

CUT TO LATER

Renee's whisper singing.

CUT TO LATER

Renee's singing a power ballad.

The four people in the audience clap hard as she finishes.

Renee takes a huge bow and motions to her fellow band mates.

Carl, not knowing how to politely react to the horror show he

just witnessed, claps along. Renee gets off the stage and

walks over to the bar, right next to Carl.

An awkward moment where Renee doesn't react and Carl thinks

he may have offended her. Suddenly she starts laughing

spazzily hard. Carl smiles.

The drummer, a guy named LEEORE, shouts down to Renee from

the stage.

Carl helps a surprised Renee clear the stage.

Beat. Seb puts his hand on Kath's back.   Carl notices this

and is not particularly happy.

Seb's phone rings.

Seb walks off and answers his cell.

Seb returns.

Carl starts to walk off.

Carl stops in his tracks. He mouths the word "fuck." Carl

turns. Kath nods at Carl as in, "You don't have to join us."

INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - LATER

Seb, Carl and Kath are sitting at dinner. It is incredibly

awkward. Kath and Seb are clearly incredibly pissed off.

A waiter arrives.

CUT TO LATER -- Carl, Kath and Seb are now slightly drunk.

However, it is a quiet, angry drunk, not a fun-loving drunk.

They are still sitting in silence. Seb turns to Kath and

starts saying something quietly to her.

Carl puts the rest of his meal in his mouth, gets up from the

table and walks out of the restaurant. As he leaves, he

smiles to himself. His phone rings. He sees it's Rooney on

the Caller ID.

Carl answers the phone.

INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

Carl flips on his computer. He's trashed.     He has a bunch of

emails. He clicks on the email.

GENIE comes onto the screen.

The screen is suddenly filled with pictures of Persian women.

INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

Carl's alarm goes off. Carl hits it and sits up. He grabs

his head and then runs to the bathroom and throws up.

EXT. PARK - PRE-DAWN

their necks. Carl walks up to them. He does not look good.

Carl realizes he forgot his camera.

Carl pulls out his camera cell phone.

Renee, Carl and the group of amateur jogging photographers

start jogging. Carl can barely keep up with them.

As she passes a flower, Renee snaps a photo of it.

EXT. LAKE - DAWN

The group reaches the lake as the sun rises. They all snap

photos. Carl finds himself snapping photos on his camera.

He accidentally snaps one of Renee with the sun behind her.

She looks pretty in the photo.

Renee starts jogging again. Carl starts after her and then

abruptly doubles over and throws up on the ground. Renee and

the other jogging/photographers snap photos of him.

-- We see Carl's CALENDAR filling up.

-- A ton of different kinds of credit cards are POPPING

THROUGH HIS MAIL SLOT.

-- Carl's taking Spanish.

The door to the language center opens.

-- Carl walks towards work. He sees the same group of flyer

guys and DUCKS DOWN an alleyway. We now see that to avoid

the flyer guys he uses a series of alleys and fire escapes,

crossing roofs, even jumping between two buildings so he can

avoid being approached.

-- At Southwest Bank.

Carl's hand shoots up.

-- Carl walks out of a movie with a woman who's in a head

INT. TONY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carl's sitting awkwardly on the floor across from Tony.   They

are both drinking tea.

Tony flips on Dionne Warwick's "I Say a Little Prayer."

Tony pulls Carl up.    Carl starts to awkwardly shake his

groove thing.

Tony grabs Carl and kisses him full on the lips.

CLOSE IN on Carl's face.      He looks down on the "Yes" that's

on his palm.

Carl and Tony head into his bedroom.

INT. TONY'S BEDROOM

INT. GALLERY

Carl walks around a photography gallery. Renee's photos are

up. They are terrible photos, since they were taken while

she was jogging. Their subjects are blurry. Some of them

are half in the photo and half out. The featured photo is of

Carl throwing up on the ground.

Renee POINTS to a LARGE, BROWN PLATE that looks like poo.

INT. KOREAN RESTAURANT - LATER

Carl's eating across from Renee. He can't stand the food.

He grimaces with every bite, but manages to choke it down.

Renee spoons a huge amount of squid onto both their plates.

Carl's surprised that she knows this.

Besides, I    can't open a store. My

big master    plan is to take a trip

around the    world.

When?   Like in a couple years?

I bought a ticket for four months

from now.

People always talk about that, but

you're actually doing it.

Honestly, I'm terrified.

How about you? Do you like the

bank?

It's lame, but you know, it's

pretty funny. My boss Norman

always throws theme parties.

So if it's lame why do you work

there?

Because... it's actually not lame.

I just gave the answer I've

automatically given for years. I'm

actually enjoying the bank for the

first time maybe ever. I started

this pilot program that gives out

microloans.

What's that?

Like say you need three hundred

bucks to pay for paint so you can

start a house painting business.

Rather than paying a loan shark who

charges you 300%, now you can come

to Southwest Bank. Whatever. It's

kind of dorky.

The waitress comes over.

INT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Norman opens the door. He's dressed as the Japanese

character Hiro from the show Heroes.

Norman stares at her.

INT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT

It's very quiet.    A couple people mill about.

It's complete silence.    Beat.

Renee laughs.    Carl fake laughs with her.

Norman comes in with more chips.   There are now about ten

times as many snacks as guests.

INT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT

Everyone's standing around Norman. They've laid several

pieces of wood out over a coffee table.

Norman KARATE CHOPS the wood in half.   The guests cheer.

Norman takes a big bow.

Renee leaves Carl.

Carl turns to Norman.

nervous.

LUCY: "WHERE ARE YOU?"

Chris laughs. Carl laughs. Chris abruptly stops laughing.

So does Carl. Carl's phone buzzes again. The text says

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

meals in front of him. He also has a martini, a glass of

water, and a glass of orange juice. Carl's showing off to

his friends. As he shows off, Renee looks irritated.

Carl is sweating bullets.

Everyone's drinking the wine.    Carl's terrified of the bill.

Carl's friends don't really know what to say. The check

comes. Carl grabs it before anyone else can. It's a $1500

bill. He drops several credit cards down on the table.

EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT

Carl's outside with Peter.

I just spent $1500 on dinner.

What?   Why?

Because the waiter asked me if I

wanted the expensive wine and you

weren't there to stop me!

Don't get mad at me about it.   You

can just stop.

No I can't. If I didn't say yes to

the band flier, I never would have

met Renee. If I hadn't said yes to

taking charge of bank day care and

then yes to becoming a loan

specialist and then yes to the

president's golf trip, I wouldn't

be moving up. Each yes leads to

the next one. If I stop, it could

all fall apart.

You've gone from a passive guy who

always said no to a passive guy who

always says yes. Just saying yes

is not a legitimate life

philosophy.

I don't know why I should be taking

advice from a guy who's wife is

pissed he's not involved at all

with the wedding planning.

I'm involved.

You told her you don't care whether

the invite's cream or ivory.

I can't see the difference.

Honestly, I'm terrified.

coats on. There's a silent beat.

accidentally dug.

back in. He tries again. It rolls back in. He's about to

try again when Carl picks up his ball and tosses it over the

lip of the sand trap. Carl holds his finger up to his lips:

"Shhh."

-- Carl's about to hit the ball when his phone rings.   He

answers it.

The other golfers look really impatient.

Carl holds up his finger.   Only one moment.

-- It's   getting late. Now both Carl and Seung Kim are

hitting   their balls at once to save time. They are both

running   and hacking at their balls across the fairway as if

they're   playing a deranged game of field hockey.

SCREAMING BABY and an ENORMOUS MAN.

conveyor belt. They don't notice anything odd.

INT. PLANE

Carl and Renee sit next to each other on the plane.

Renee heads to the bathroom. Carl takes the package out from

hard. He very gingerly opens the package. He pulls back the

packing peanuts revealing... a box of homemade chocolates.

Carl breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.

INT. AIRPORT

Carl and Renee walk off the plane, Carl carrying the package

under his arm. Carl sees a tall blond guy holding a sign

that says "SHELDON WINKLETON." He heads towards the guy but

before he can several DEA AGENTS with ADORABLE, DRUG SNIFFING
