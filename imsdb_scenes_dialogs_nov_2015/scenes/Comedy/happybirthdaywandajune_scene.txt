How do you do.  My name is Penelope

Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play

about men who enjoy killing--and

those who don't.

I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I

have killed perhaps two hundred men

in wars of various sorts--as a

professional soldier.  I have

killed thousands of other animals

as well--for sport.

I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a

physician, a healer.  I find it

disgusting and frightening that a

killer should be a respected member

of society.  Gentleness must

replace violence everywhere, or we

are doomed.

Would you like to say something

about killing, Colonel?

Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What

the heck.  Who knows?

Colonel Harper, retired now,

dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki

during the Second World War,

killing seventy-four thousand

people in a flash.

I dunno, boy.

You don't know?

It was a bitch.

Thank you.

You can leave now.  We'll begin.

Peace!

This is a tragedy.  When it's done,

my face will be as white as the

snows of Kilimanjaro.

My husband, who kills so much, has

been missing for eight years.  He

disappeared in a light plane over

the Amazon Rain Forest, where he

hoped to find diamonds as big as

cantaloupes.  His pilot was Colonel

Looseleaf Harper, who dropped the

bomb on Nagasaki.

I should explain the doorbells in

this apartment.  They were built by

Abercrombie and Fitch.  They are

actual recordings of animal cries.

The back doorbell is a hyena, which

you've just heard.  The front

doorbell is a lion's roar.

Would you let them hear it please?

Thank you.

And this is my son, Paul.  He was

only four years old when his father

disappeared.

He's coming back, Mom!  He's the

bravest, most wonderful man who

ever lived.

I told you this was a simple-minded

play.

Maybe he'll come back tonight!

It's his birthday.

I know.

Stay home tonight!

Oh, Paul--

You're married!  You've already got

a husband!

He's a ghost!

He's alive!

Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so

anymore.

If you have to go out with some

guy--can't he be more like Dad?

Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly--

can't you do better than those two

freaks?

Thank you, kind sir.

A vacuum cleaner salesman and a

fairy doctor.

A what kind of doctor?

A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the

building knows he's a queer.

That's an interesting piece of news.

You're the only woman he ever took

out.

Not true.

Still lives with his mother.

You know she has no feet!  You want

him to abandon his mother, who has

no husband, who has no money of her

own, who has no feet?

How did she lose her feet?

In a railroad accident many years ago.

I was afraid to ask.

Norbert was just beginning practice.

A real man would have sold her to a

catfood company, I suppose.  As far

as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still

lives with his mother.

I didn't know that.

A lot of people don't.

J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.

I don't really know.

To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever

gets is playing the violin and

making that stupid peace sign.

Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.

I hate that thing.

It's beautiful.

Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.

You're taking Mom out tonight?

You're going out?

Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.

Take plenty of cigars.

We made the date three months ago.

I must take you to an emergency

ward sometime--on a Saturday night.

That's also fun.  I came to see

Selma, as a matter of fact.

She quit this afternoon.

We don't have a maid any more.

Oh?

The animals made her sneeze and cry

too much.

I'm glad somebody finally cried.

Every time I come in here and see

all this unnecessary death, I want

to cry.

I don't cry, of course.  Not manly,

you know.  Did she try antihistamines?

They made her so sleepy she

couldn't work.

Throw out all this junk.  Burn it!

This room crawls with tropical

disease.

Everything stays as it is!

A monument to a man who thought

that what the world needed most was

more rhinoceros meat.

My father!

I apologize.  But you didn't know

him, and neither did I.  How's your

asthma?

Don't worry about it.

How's the fungus around your

thumbnail?

It's fine!

It's jungle rot!  This room is

making everybody sick!  This is

your family doctor speaking now.

Here--I brought you something else

to hang on your wall, for the sake

of variety.

"War is not healthy for children

and other living things." How lovely.

No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.

I hate that thing.

Keeps fairies away!

Hi kid.

Would you look what the car dragged

in.

I'm glad you brought your vacuum

cleaner.

Is that a fact?

That maid just quit.  The place is

a mess.  You can start in the

master bedroom.

Please--

He's not anybody to tell somebody

else what to do in a master bedroom.

I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't

expect you this soon.

Please--won't everybody be nice to

everybody else while I'm gone?

Most men shunned me--even when I

nearly swooned for want of love.  I

might as well have been girdled in

a chastity belt.  My chastity belt

was not made of iron and chains and

chickenwire, but of Harold's lethal

reputation.

I keep having this nightmare--that

he catches us.

Doing what?

He'd kill me.  He'd be right to

kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.

Or was.  We haven't done anything

wrong, you know.

He'd assume we had.

That's something I suppose.

All through the day I'm so

confident.  That's why I'm such a

good salesman, you know?  I have

confidence, and I look like I have

confidence, and that gives other

people confidence.  People laugh

sometimes when they find out I'm a

vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop

laughing, though, when they find

out I made forty-three thousand

dollars last year.  I've got six

other salesmen working under me,

and what they all plug into is my

confidence.  That's what charges

them up.

I'm glad.

I was captain of the wrestling team

at Lehigh University.

I know.

If you want to wrestle, you got

Lehigh.  If you want to play

tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.

I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.

You don't wrestle if you don't have

supreme confidence, and I wrestled.

But when I get with you, and I say

to myself, "My God--here I am with

the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the

great heroes of all time--"

Yes?

Something happens to my confidence.

This conversation took place,

incidentally, about three months

before Harold was declared legally

dead.

When Harold is definitely out of

the picture, Penelope, when I don't

have to worry about doing him wrong

or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm

going to ask you to be my wife.

I'm touched.

That's when I'll get my confidence

back.

I see.

If you'll pardon the expression,

that's when you'll see the fur and

feathers fly.  Good night.

Good night.

You've got to fight from time to time.

Not true.

Or get eaten alive.

That's not true either--or needn't

be, unless we make it true.

Phooey.

Which we do.  But we can stop doing

that.

We simply stop doing that--dropping

things on each other, eating each

other alive.

Penelope!  We're late!

Coming.

Women are always late.  You'll find

out.

The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.

I'm sick of this argument.  I just

have one more thing to say: If you

elect a President, you support him,

no matter what he does.  That's the

only way you can have a country!

It's the planet that's in ghastly

trouble now and all our brothers

and sisters thereon.

None of my relatives are Chinese

Communists.  Speak for yourself.

Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs

and American maniacs and French

maniacs and British maniacs have

turned this lovely, moist,

nourishing blue-green ball into a

doomsday device.  Let a radar set

and a computer mistake a hawk or a

meteor for a missile, and that's

the end of mankind.

You can believe that if you want.

I talk to guys like you, and I want

to commit suicide.

You get that weight-lifting set I

sent you?

It came yesterday.  I haven't

opened it yet.

Maybe it's supposed to end now.

Maybe God wouldn't have it any

other way.

Start with the smallest weights.

Every week add a pound or two.

Maybe God has let everybody who

ever lived be reborn--so he or she

can see how it ends.  Even

Pithecanthropus erectus and

Australopithecus and Sinanthropus

pekensis and the Neanderthalers are

back on Earth--to see how it ends.

They're all on Times Square--making

change for peepshows.  Or recruiting

Marines.

You ever hear the story about the

boy who carried a calf around the

barn every day?

He died of a massive rupture.

You think you're so funny.  You're

not even funny.

Right?  Right?  You don't hurt

yourself if you start out slow.

You're preparing him for a career

in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?

Take care of your body, yes!  But

don't become a bender of horseshoes

and railroad spikes.  Don't become

obsessed by your musculature.  Any

one of these poor, dead animals

here was a thousand times the

athlete you can ever hope to be.

Their magic was in their muscles.

Your magic is in your brains!

Gentlemen!  Is this right for a

fight?  It's been so long.

Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.

Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told.

Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?

Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear

a coat of wool.

What?

Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For

the love of God, though, Penelope,

don't lightheartedly advertise that

the last of the jaguars died for you.

She's my date tonight.  What do you

want her to do--bring the poor old

jaguars back to life with a bicycle

pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what

he thinks.

Your mother looks beautiful--right?

Kid?

Doesn't your mother look nice?

Paul?

I don't care what she wears.

Something's made you sore.

Don't worry about it.

You bet I'll worry about it.  I

said something wrong?

It's my father's birthday--that's

all.

That's all.  Who cares about that?

I had not the slightest inkling.

Why didn't you say so?

She doesn't care!  She's not

married any more!  She's going to

have fun!

I hope you have so much fun you can

hardly stand it.

Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even

better jokes about my father than

the ones you've said so far.

Kid--kid--

And I wish you'd quit touching me

all the time.  It drives me nuts!

What's this?

Don't!

You sure misunderstood something--

and we'd better get it straight.

Explain it to them.  I'm bugging

out of here.

Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.

Men can touch other men, and it

doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you

ever seen football players after

they've won the Superbowl?

Where will you be?

Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit

here and cry about the way my

father's been forgotten.

I worship your father.  That

stuffed alligator your mother gave

me--the one he shot?  It's the

proudest thing in my apartment.

Everybody talks about how rotten

kids act.  Grownups can be pretty

rotten, too.

Kid--kid--

It's good.  Let him go.

If he'd just come out for the

Little League, the way I asked him,

he'd find out we touch all the

time--shove each other, slug each

other, and just horse around.  I'm

going to go get him--

Don't!  Let him have all the

privacy he wants.  Let him grieve,

let him rage.  There has never been

a funeral for his father.

I never knew when to hold it--or

who to ask, or what to say.

Tonight's the night.

If he'd just get into scouting, and

camp out some, and see how

everybody roughhouses around the

fire--

What a beautiful demonstration this

is of the utter necessity of rites

of passage.

I feel like I've been double-

crossed.

If you'd just told me it was

Harold's birthday--

What then?

We could have had some kind of

birthday party for him.  We could

have taken Paul to the fight with us.

Minors aren't allowed at fights.

Then we'd stay home and eat venison

or something, and look through the

scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who

has a whole freezer full of striped

bass and caribou meat.

I'm going to bring that boy back.

This is very good for us.

It is?

The wilder Paul is tonight, the

calmer he'll be tomorrow.

As long as he keeps out of the park.

After this explosion, I think,

he'll be able to accept the fact

that his mother is going to marry

again.

The only thing I ever told him

about life was, "Keep out of the

park after the sun goes down."

We've got to dump Shuttle.

He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?

That's the XKE.

The what?

It's an experimental model.  He

doesn't dare leave it in his car,

for fear it will fall into the

hands of competition.

What kind of a life is that?

He told me one time what the

proudest moment of his life was.

He made Eagle Scout when he was

twenty-nine years old.

Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul

has not gone into the park!

If you warned him against it as

much as you say, it's almost a

certainty.

No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered

in there in the last six weeks!

The police won't even go in there

any more.

I wish Paul luck.

It's suicide!

I'd be dead by now if that were the

case.

Meaning?

Every night, Penelope, for the past

two years, I've made it a point to

walk through the park at midnight.

Why would you do that?

To show myself how brave I am.  The

issue's in doubt, you know--since

I'm always for peace--

I'm amazed.

Me, too.  I know something not even

the police know--what's in the park

at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when

I'm in there, there's me in there.

Fear and nobody and me.

And maybe Paul.  What about the

murderers?  They're in there!

They didn't murder me.

Paul's only twelve years old.

He can make the sound of human

footsteps--which is a terrifying

sound.

We've got to rescue him.

If he is in the park, luck is all

that can save him now, and there's

plenty of that.

He's not your son.

No.  But he's going to be.  If he

is in the park and he comes out

safely on the other side, I can say

to him, "You and I are the only men

with balls enough to walk through

the park at midnight."

On that we can build.

It's a jungle out there.

That's been said before.

He'd go to a movie.  I think that's

what he'd do.  If I were sure he

was in a movie, I could stop

worrying.  We could have him paged.

I hate that thing.

Did you see him?

Yeah.

Is he all right?

Far as I know.

Is he coming home?

He ditched me.  He started running,

and I started running, then he lost

me in the park.

The park!

It's dark in there.

And that's where he is!

I figure he ducked in one place and

ducked out another.

You figure!

Then I saw this bakery store that

was still open, so I bought a

birthday cake.

A what?

For Harold.  When Paul comes home,

we can have some birthday cake.

How nice.

They had this cake somebody else

hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy

Birthday, Somebody Else."

"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"

We can take off the "Wanda June"

with a butter knife.

Did you talk to Paul?

Before he started to run.  He said

his father carried a key to this

apartment around his neck--and

someday we'd all hear the sound of

that key in the door.

We've got to find him.

I want you to show me exactly where

you saw him last.

And you stay here, Norbert, in case

he comes home.

That's all he said--the thing about

the key?

He said one other thing.  It wasn't

very nice.

What was it?

He told me to take a flying fuck at

the moon.

Ooops.

Ooops.

Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?

Gentlemen--that's nice.

You startled me.

Yeah.  We just got here.

I thought you might be burglars--

but you're not, I hope.

Nope.

I got a lot of stuff.

You do?

The door ws unlocked.  Is it always

unlocked?

It's always locked.

But here you are inside, aren't you?

You're--you're old friends of

Harold Ryan?

We tried to be.  We tried to be.

He's dead, you know.

Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!

Did you hear that?

Yup.

Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.

Hello, Mother.

...Who?... Did she say how far

apart the pains were?... When was

that?... Oh dear.

Oh dear.

Call her back--tell her to head for

the hospital.  Tell the hospital to

expect her.  I'll leave right now.

Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.

We'll miss you so.

Look--this isn't my apartment, and

there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs.

Ryan won't be home for a while.

Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your

apartment.  You seemed at home here.

I'm a neighbor.  I have the

apartment across the hall.  I have

to go to the hospital now.  An

emergency.

I mean--I can't leave you here.

You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs.

Ryan you were here.  You can come

back later.

Ahh--then she's still alive.

She's fine.  Please--

And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?

Will you please go?  An emergency!

She still has just the one child--

the boy?

Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!

And what, exactly, is your

relationship to Mrs. Ryan?

Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across

the hall.

And you come into Mrs. Ryan's

apartment as often as you please,

looking into various health matters?

Yes!  Please!  You've got to get

out right now!

Just her neighbor and doctor?

That's all?

And her fiance!

And her fiance!  How nice.  I hope

you'll be very happy--or is that

what one says to the woman?

I've got to run!

You wish the woman good luck, and

you tell the man how fortunate he

is.  That's how it goes.

I've literally got to run!

I won't try to keep up with you.

I'm not as fast on my feet as I

once was.

Miss me, baby?

I dunno, boy.

Hm?

It's a bitch.

A bitch.

Didn't recognize you.

We've never met.

I wonder who'll recognize us first?

They'll wet their pants.

I hope the men do.  I would rather

the women didn't.

I'm gonna wet my pants.

Home, sweet home.

One thing, anyway--at least

Penelope didn't throw out all your

crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my

crap after I'd been gone a week.

We'll see.

It appears that we're going to have

to wait awhile for any more action

here, Colonel.  Why don't you run

on home while the evening's young.

Home.  Jesus.

I'm like this.  Home!

Home is important to a man.

You know what gets me?

No.

How all the magazines show tits today.

Um.

Used to be against the law, didn't it?

I suppose.

Must have changed that law.

Home.

You know what gets me?

You know what gets me?

Oh, shit.

How everybody says "fuck" and

"shit" all the time.  I used to be

scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or

"shit" in public, by accident.  Now

everybody says "fuck" and "shit,"

"fuck" and "shit" all the time.

Something very big must have

happened while we were out of the

country.

Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?

At least we found the diamonds.

At least!

I'd really feel stupid if we didn't

bring anything back home.

It's enough that you've brought

yourself home!

I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And

that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.

Tell them yourself!

You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.

After eight years in the jungle

with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler

better than I know anybody in the

universe!

I didn't tell you everything.

The time we were in a tree for

fourteen days, you certainly tried

to tell me everything about Mrs.

Wheeler.

I didn't even scratch the surface.

You're lucky, boy.  You come home,

and nobody's here.  When I go home,

everybody's going to be there.

This room is full of ghosts.

You're lucky, boy.  My house is

gonna be filled with people.

You know what gets me?

Go home!

Thank God we found the fucking

diamonds!

The hell with the diamonds!

You were rich before.  This is the

first time I was ever rich.

Go home!  Show them how rich you

are for a change!

Can I have the Cadillac?

Take the Cadillac and drive it off

a cliff, for all I care.

What'll you do for transportation?

I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs.

Go home!

You know what gets me about that

Cadillac?

Go home!

When I drive it, I feel like I'm in

the middle of a great big wad of

bubblegum.  I don't hear anything,

I don't feel anything.  I figure

somebody else is driving.  It's a

bitch.

Go home.

I'm liable to find anything!

That's the point!  Walk in there

and find whatever there is to

find--before Alice can cover it up.

I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least

she's in the same house.  Sure was

spooky, looking in the window

there, and there she was.

So long, Colonel.

You know what gets me?

Let's talk about it some other time.

How short the skirts are.

Good night, Colonel.  It's been

beautiful.

Something very important about sex

must have happened while we were gone.

Hell!

You know what gets me?  Those guys

who went to the moon!  To the moon,

boy!

Leave me alone!  After eight years

of horrendously close association,

the time has come to part!  I crave

solitude and time for reflection--

and then a reunion in privacy with

my own flesh and blood.  You and I

may not meet again for months!

Months?

I'm certainly not going to come

horning back into your life

tomorrow, and I will not welcome

your horning back into mine.  A

chapter has ended.  We are old

comrades--at a parting of the ways.

I'm lonesome already.

The moon.  The new heroism--put a

village idiot into a pressure

cooker, seal it up tight, and shoot

him at the moon.

Hello there, young man.  In case

you're wondering, I could beat the

shit out of you.  And any woman

choosing between us--sorry, kid,

she'd choose me.

I must say, this room is very much

as I left it.

What's this?  A cake? "Happy

Birthday, Wanda June"?  Who the

hell is Wanda June?

Hello.  I am Wanda June.  Today was

going to be my birthday, but I was

hit by an ice-cream truck before I

could have my party.  I am dead now.

I am in Heaven.  That is why my

parents did not pick up the cake at

the bakery.  I am not mad at the

ice-cream truck driver, even though

he was drunk when he hit me.  It didn't

hurt much.  It wasn't even as bad as the

sting of a bumblebee.  I am really

happy here!  It's so much fun.  I

am glad the driver was drunk.  If

he hadn't been, I might not have

got to Heaven for years and years

and years.  I would have had to go

to high school first, and then

beauty college.  I would have had

to get married and have babies and

everything.  Now I can just play

and play and play.  Any time I want

any pink cotton candy I can have

some.  Everybody up here is happy--

the animals and the dead soldiers

and people who went to the electric

chair and everything.  They're all

glad for whatever sent them here.

Nobody is mad.  We're all too busy

playing shuffleboard.  So if you

think of killing somebody, don't

worry about it.  Just go ahead and

do it.  Whoever you do it to should

kiss you for doing it.  The

soldiers up here just love the

shrapnel and the tanks and the

bayonets and the dum dums that let

them play shuffleboard all the

time--and drink beer.

We have merry-go-rounds that don't

cost anything to ride on.  We have

Ferris wheels.  We have Little

League and girls' basketball.

There's a drum and bugle corps

anybody can join.  For people who

like golf, there is a par-three

golf course and a driving range,

with never any waiting.  If you

just want to sit and loaf, why

that's all right, too.  Gourmet

specialties are cooked to your

order and served at any time of

night or day...

Ha ha ha ha ha!

You got me, pal.

When Penelope asked me to say

something about dropping the bomb

on Nagasaki, I didn't give a very

good answer, I guess.  It's a very

complicated question.  Jesus--you

know?  You have to explain what

it's like to be in the Air Force

and how they give you your orders

and all that.  What it feels like

to be in a plane, what the world

looks like down there.  After I got

home from the war, the minister of

my church asked me if I would speak

to a scout troop that met in the

church basement.  So I did.  They

met on Thursday nights.  I used to

belong to that troop.  I never made

Eagle Scout.  But you know

something?  It's a very strange

kind of kid that makes Eagle Scout.

They always seem so lonesome, like

they'd worked real hard to get a

job nobody else cares about.  They

get a whole bunch of merit badges.

That's how you get to be an Eagle

Scout.  I don't think I had over

five or six merit badges.  The only

one I remember is Public Health.

That was a bitch.  The Boy Scout

Manual said I was supposed to find

out what my town did about sewage.

Jesus, they just dumped it all in

Sugar Creek.

Sugar Creek!  That was a long time

ago, but it's all coming back to me

now.  There was another merit badge

you could get for roller skating.

There used to be a roller rink at a

bend in Sugar Creek, up above where

the sewage went in.  I got in a

fight there one time.  I had on

roller skates, and the guy I was

fighting had on basketball shoes.

He had a tremendous advantage over

me.  He was a little guy, but he

beat the shit out of me.  I had to

laugh like hell.  Don't ever fight

a guy when you've got on roller

skates.

Jesus--I remember my mother used to

make me chew bananas for a full

minute before I swallowed--so I

wouldn't get sick.  Makes you

wonder what else your parents told

you that wasn't true.

The night I met Penelope, I had no

beard--so imagine me, if you can,

without a beard.  Actually, I

wasn't as good-looking then as I am

now.  And, if anything, me health

has improved.  At any rate--I had

just come home from Kenya--to

discover that my third wife,

Mildred, like the two before her,

had become a drunken bum.  In my

experience, alcoholism is far more

prevalent among women than men.  So

I got into my automobile--

I drive through the night, until I

was attracted by a sign which said--

"Hamburger Heaven."

Heaven.

Can I help you, sir?

I think so, daughter.  How old are

you?

Eighteen--

and a half.

A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a

gazelle.

Sir?

Raw hamburger, please--and a whole

onion.  I want to eat the onion

like an apple.  Do you understand?

Yes, sir.

It was a very unusual automobile.

It was a Cadillac, but it had water

buffalo horns where the bumpers

should be.

And what to drink?

What time do you get off work, my

child?

I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be

married.  My boyfriend would be mad

if I went out with another man.

Did you ever daydream that you

would one day meet a friendly

millionaire?

I'm engaged.

Daughter--I love you very much.

You don't even know me.

You are woman.  I know woman well.

This is crazy.

Destiny often seems that way.

You're going to marry me.

What do you do for a living?

My parents died in an automobile

accident when I was sixteen years

old.  They left me a brewery and a

baseball team--and other things.  I

live for a living.  I've just come

back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've

been hunting Mau Mau there.

Some kind of animal?

The pelt is black.  It's a kind of

man.

Mom?

Herb?

Dr. Woodly?

Hello?

A cake?  Who's Wanda June?

Anybody home?

As a matter of fact--

Sir?

As a matter of fact--I am home.

Hello.

Hello.

Are you--

You were about to ask a question?

Are you--do you--

Ask it!

Do you know who Wanda June is?

Life has denied me that thrill.

Do you mind if I ask who you are?

Mind?

God, yes, I mind.

I'm your father's friend.  A man

claiming to be the family physician

let me in a while ago.

Dr. Woodly.

Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little

list.

Is anybody besides you here now?

The doctor was called away on an

emergency.  I think it was birth.

Where's Mom?

You don't know where your mother is?

Does she put on a short skirt and

go drinking all night?

She went to the fight with Herb

Shuttle, I guess.

You think you could find me a

pencil and paper?

I'll see.

And you've been roaming the streets

while your mother is God-knows-where?

I was going to a funny movie, but I

changed my mind.  If you're

depressed, laughing doesn't help

much.

When did you know my father?

Man and boy.

Everybody says he was so brave.

Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?

He worships Father.

Ah!  And what sort of man is this

worshiper?

He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.

I see.

And he came into the apartment one

day, to demonstrate his wares, and

your mother, as it happened, was

charmingly en deshabille--

She met him at college.

College!

They were in the same creative

writing class.

College?

She has a master's degree in

English literature.

What a pity!  Educating a beautiful

woman is like pouring honey into a

fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.

And the doctor?  He worships your

father, too?

He insults him all the time.

Excellent!

What's good about that?

It makes life spicy.

He doesn't do it in front of me,

but he does it with Mother.

You know what he called Father one

time?

No.

"Harold, the Patron Saint of

Taxidermy."

What does he do--of an athletic

nature?

Nothing.  He plays a violin in a

doctors' quartet.

Aha!  He has a brilliant military

record, I'm sure.

He was a stretcher-bearer in the

Korean War.

Were you in a war with Father?

Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny

ones--just and otherwise.

Tell me some true stories about Dad.

"Dad?"

Dad.

The boy wants tales of derring-do.

Name a country.

England?

Oh hell.

Dad was never in England?

Behind a desk for a little while.

A desk!  They had him planning air

raids.  A city can't flee like a

coward or fight like a man, and the

choice between fleeing and fighting

was at the core of the life of

Harold Ryan.  There was only one

thing he enjoyed more than watching

someone make that choice, and that

was making the choice himself.  Ask

about Spain, where he was the

youngest soldier in the Abraham

Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous

sniper.  They called him "La

Picadura"--"the sting."

"The sting."

As in "Death, where is thy sting?"

He killed at least fifty men,

wounded hundreds more.

"The sting."

Ask about the time he and I were

parachuted into Yugoslavia to join

a guerrilla band--in the war

against the Nazis.

Tell me that.

I saw your father fight Major

Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast

of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.

Tell me that!  Tell me that!

Hid by day--fought by night.  At

sunset one day, your father and I,

peering through field glasses, saw

a black Mercedes draw up to a

village inn.  It was escorted by

two motorcyclists and an armored

car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped

one of the most hateful men in all

of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.

Wow.

We blacked our hands and faces.  At

midnight we crept out of the forest

and into the village.  The name of

the village was Mhravitch.

Remember that name!

Mhravitch.

We came up behind a sentry, and

your father slit his throat before

he could utter a sound.

Uck.

Don't care for cold steel?  A knife

is worse than a bullet?

I don't know.

The story gets hairier.  Should I

stop?

Go on.

We caught another Kraut alone in a

back lane.  Your father choked him

to death with a length of piano

wire.  Your father was quite a

virtuoso with piano wire.  That's

nicer than a knife, isn't it--as

long as you don't look at the face

afterwards.  The face turns a

curious shade of avocado.  I must

ask the doctor why that is.  At any

rate, we stole into the back of the

inn, and, with the permission of

the management, we poisoned the

wine of six Krauts who were

carousing there.

Where did you get the poison?

We carried cyanide capsules.  We

were supposed to swallow them in

case we were captured.  It was your

father's opinion that the Krauts

needed them more than we did at the

time.

And one of them was the Beast of

Yugoslavia?

The Beast was upstairs, and he came

running downstairs, for his men

were making loud farewells and last

wills and testaments--editorializing

about the hospitality they had

received.  And your father said to

him in perfect German, which he had

learned in the Spanish Civil War,

"Major, something tragic seems to

have happened to your bodyguard.  I

am Harold Ryan, of the United

States of America.  You, I believe,

are the Beast of Yugoslavia."

Ja ja.  Ja ja.

I am Major Siegfried von Konigswald.

They used to call me "The Beast of

Yugoslavia," on account of all the

people I had tortured and shot--and

hanged.  We'd bop 'em on the head.

We'd hook 'em up to the electricity.

We'd stick 'em with hypodermic

syringes full of all kinds of stuff.

One time we killed a guy with

orange juice.  There was a train

wreck, and two of the freight cars

were loaded with oranges, so we had

oceans of orange juice.  It was a

joke--how much orange juice we had.

And we were interrogating a guy one

day, and he wouldn't talk, and the

next thing I know--somebody's

filling up this big syringe with

orange juice.

There was a guerrilla war going on.

You couldn't tell who was a

guerrilla and who wasn't.

Even if you got one, it was still a

civilian you got.  Telling

Americans what a guerrilla war is

like--that's coals to Newcastle.

How do you like that for idiomatic

English? "Coals to Newcastle."

That Harold Ryan--he says he spoke

to me in perfect German?  He talks

German like my ass chews gum.  I'm

glad to hear the wonderful thing he

said before he killed me.  I sure

didn't understand it the first time

around.  I figured he was a

Lithuanian or something, which will

give you an idea of how wrong you

can be.  All I knew was he was very

proud about something, and he had a

machine pistol, and it was aimed at

me.  The woods were full of all

kinds of nuts who were proud of

some damn thing or other, and they

all had guns.  They were always

looking for revenge.  You find a

way to bottle revenge--that's the

end of Schnapps und Coca-Cola.

Harold Ryan said he killed maybe

two hundred guys.  I killed a

hundred times that many, I bet.

That's still peanuts, of course,

compared to what that crazy

Looseleaf did.  Harold and me--we

was doing it the hard way.  I hope

the record books will show that.

There should be a little star or

something by the names of the guys

who did it the hard way.

I'm up in Heaven now, like that

little Wanda June kid.  I wasn't

hit by no ice-cream truck.  Harold

Ryan killed me with his bare hands.

He was good.  My eyes popped out.

My tongue stuck out like a red

banana.  I shit in my pants.  It

was a mess.

When I got up on the day I died, I

said, "What a beautiful day this is.

What a beautiful part of the

world." The whole planet was

beautiful.  Up here I meet guys

from other planets.

We got some really crazy-looking

guys up here.  Their planets

weren't anywhere near as nice as

Earth.  They had clouds all the

time.  They never saw a clear blue

sky.  They never saw snow.  They

never saw an ocean.  They had some

little lakes, but you couldn't go

swimming in them.  The lakes were

acid.  You go swimming, you

dissolve.  We got some guys up here

who got shoved in them lakes.  They

dissolved.

Harold Ryan stopped talking German

to me there in Yugoslavia.  He

switched to English, so I finally

got some kind of idea what he was

so burned up about.  He wanted

revenge for the guy we killed with

orange juice.  I don't know how he

ever found out about it.  There was

just three of us there when we did

it--me and two regular military

doctors.  Somebody who cleaned up

afterwards must have squealed.  If

I'd lived through the war, and they

tried me for war crimes and all

that, I'd have to tell the court, I

guess, "I was only following

orders, as a good soldier should.

Hitler told me to kill this guy

with orange juice."

Mhravitch.  Remember that name.

Mhravitch.

The name will live forever.  It was

there that Harold Ryan slew the

Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.

When I grow up, I'm going to go to

Mhravitch.

It's rather a disappointment these

days.  It isn't there any more.

Sir?

The Germans shot everybody who

lived there, then leveled it,

plowed it, planted turnips and

cabbages in the fertile ground.

They wished revenge for the slaying

of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To

their twisted way of thinking, your

father had butchered an Eagle Scout.

Play lots of contact sports?

I wanted to go out for football,

but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.

You're supposed to get hurt!

Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds

of children permanently injured by

football.  He says that when

there's a war, everybody goes but

football players.

Does it bother you to have your

mother engaged to a man like that?

They're not engaged.

He seems to think they are.  He

told me that were.

Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be.

How embarrassing.

You're a very good boy to respond

that way.

No, no, no, no, no.

I'd like to use the sanitary

facilities, if I may.

Go ahead.

No, no, no, no.

Thank God!

What a relief!

My baby's safe!

What's the matter now?

We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did

you see the cake?

Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?

Who have you been talking to?

What difference does that make?  Is

Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?

Yes, he is.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

That goes double for me.

I don't want to live any more.

I feel like I want to yell my head

off--just yell anything.

Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!

I'll kill myself.

The wife of Harold Ryan is going to

marry a pansy next?  This is the

end of Western Civilization as far

as I'm concerned.  You must be

crazy as a fruitcake.

Possibly.

How long has this been going on?

A week.  We were waiting for the

right time to--

I feel as though I had been made a

perfect chump of.

I'm sorry.

Marry me instead.

Thank you, Herb.  You're a

wonderful man.  You really are.

Everybody respects you for what

you've done for scouting and the

Little League.

You're saying no.

I'm saying no--and thank you.

I didn't make my move fast enough.

That's it, isn't it?  I was too

respectful.

You were wonderful.

What's so wonderful if I lost the

sale?

You poor kid.

Don't touch me.

Wouldn't you rather have your

mother marry me than him?

No.

All my dreams have suddenly

collapsed.

We did have a lot of laughs

together, Penelope.

It's true.

Well--it was nice while it lasted.

Thanks for the memories.

Is Norbert still here?

No.

Then who flushed the toilet?

Father's friend.

What's his name?

Don't know.

For Heaven's sakes!

How do you do?

How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd

heard you were beautiful, and so

you are.  Am I intruding here?

Not at all.

I couldn't help overhearing that

you were about to get married again.

Our family physician has asked me

to marry him.  Paul needs the

guidance and companionship that

only a man can give.  He isn't at

all like Harold.  But then again,

I'm not the woman I was eight years

ago.

Mom?

That man is your father.

What?

There stands the loins from which

you've sprung.

I don't get it.

It is you, isn't it, Harold?

Yes, wife, it is.

Come here, boy.  Your father is home.

Sir?

Go to him.

Wife, wife, wife...

Wife, wife, wife...

What's the matter?

Give us time.

Like hugging a lamp post.

Give us time, Harold--to adjust to

your being alive.

You were well adjusted to my being

dead?

We adjust to what there is to

adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being

young, can adjust to joy or grief

immediately.  I hope he can.  I

will take a little longer.  I'll be

as quick as I can.

What sort of time period do you

have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?

I don't know.  This is a new

disease to me.

Disease?

Situation.

This reunion isn't what I imagined

it would be.

A telegram--a phone call might have

helped.

Seemed the most honest way to begin

life together again--natural,

unrehearsed.

Well--enjoy the natural, honest,

unrehearsed result--surgical shock.

You feel that you're behaving as a

woman should?

Every fuse in my nervous system has

been blown.

Who's that?  Teddy Roosevelt?

Safe and sound, I see.

Oh--you came back.

I came back.

You know each other?

We met here earlier this evening.

How neat.  How keen.

How was the emergency, Doctor?

Profitable, I hope.

A policeman delivered the baby in a

taxicab.

Tough luck.  You'll have to split

the fee.

Are--are you crying, Penelope?

She's crying because she's so happy.

That's why I'm crying.

Dr. Woodly?

You know who this is?

I didn't get his name.  A friend of

your father?

He isn't any friend of Father.

He isn't?

He is my father.

No!

Eeeeeeeeeeee-yup.  Dr. Woodly--I

would like you to meet Harold, my

husband.  Harold, this is Dr.

Woodly, my fiance.

Good night, dear.  Good night, dear.

Stay or go, talk or sulk, laugh or

cry--as you wish.  Do whatever

seems called for.  My mind is gone.

Good night.

I feel the same way.  What next?

What next?  You leave promptly, of

course.  There is no question as to

whose home this is--

None.

Whose son this is, whose wife that

is.  A fiance is the most ridiculous

appurtenance this household could

have at this time.  Good night.

Good night.

Penelope!  God damn it!  Penelope!

Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.

Is Looseleaf Harper alive?

Alive and hale.  He's throwing a

little surprise party for his own

family.  Is your mother often this

unstable?

Penelope!

She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.

Why don't you go to bed--son.

I can't take my eyes off you.

Tomorrow's another day.

You know what my English literature

teacher said about you?

Can't it keep till morning?

She said you were legendary.  I

wrote a theme about you, and she

said, "Your father is a legendary

hero out of the Golden Age of

Heroes."

That's nice.  You thank her for me.

Go to bed and get lots of sleep,

and then you thank her in the morning.

Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's

dead.

Penelope!

She was killed in the park two

months ago--in the daytime.

Penelope!

She was on her way home from a

meeting of the African Violet

Society, and they got her.

Will you go to bed?

Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up,

I've got double-decker bunks.

Scat!

Penelope--darling--can you hear me?

Wife--you know what kept me alive

all these fevered, swampy,

nightmare years?  Your heavenly

face, Penelope, my wife--shimmering

before me, coaxing me up from my

knees, begging me to stagger one

step closer to home.  Has love ever

reached so far?  Has love ever

overcome more hardships than mine?

Has love ever asked more manliness

of a man, more womanliness of a

woman?  Has ever a man done more

for a woman's reward?

There is no one in here of any

earthly use to anyone tonight.

Tomorrow is another day.

End of Act One.

Mom!  Mother!  Mom!

Dad's got jungle fever, Mom.

What'll I do?  Mom!

Damn.

Mom?

What are his symptoms?

Shivers and sweats and groans.  His

teeth chatter.  What'll we do?

What does he say to do?

He can hardly talk.

Bluh.

You'd better get Dr. Woodly.

Really?

It is an emergency, isn't it?

Yeah.

Then get him.

Okay.

Dr. Woodly?

Dr. Woodly?

What's that all about?

We thought a doctor might help.

Your old beau?

We thought it was an emergency.

I don't want that chancre mechanic

in here.

He's a very decent man, Harold.

We all are.

Shouldn't you lie down?

When I'm dead--

or fucking.

Paul said you were awfully sick.

I was, I was.  It never lasts long.

The Indians call it "Zamba-

keetya"--the little cloudburst.

Ah!  You're ambulatory!

What a brilliant diagnosis!

You know what I want?

I want you both to be friends.  I

know you both, respect you both.

You should be friends.

Nothing would please me more.

Thank God!

Well now--what seems to be the

trouble with the patient today?  A

touch of malaria, perhaps?

I know malaria.  Malaria isn't

caused by the bites of bats.

You've been bitten by bats?

Colonel Harper and I once shared a

treetop with a family of bats.

There was a flash flood.  There

were piranha fish in the water.

That's how Colonel Harper lost his

little toe.

You have chills?

Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can

describe it and name it after

yourself: "the Woodly galloping

crud."

You can also describe its cure.

I'm eating its cure.

I was going to ask.

Pacqualinincheewa root.

Would you say that again?

Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means

"cougar fang." Cures anything but a

yellow streak down the back.

I've never heard of it.

Congratulations.  By crossing

twenty-eight feet of cockroach-

infested carpet, you've become the

third white man ever to hear of it.

Are you've seen it work cures?

Hundreds.

I'm so glad you like each other.  I

was so scared, so scared.

Have some.

Thank you.  Thank you very much.

I believe in miracles now.

Wasn't that sweet of me?

More and more we find ourselves

laying aside false pride and

looking into the pharmacopoeias of

primitive people.  Curare,

ephedrine--we've found some amazing

things.

We have, have we?

That's an editorial we, of course.

I haven't turned up anything

personally.

Everything about you is the

editorial we.  Take that away from

you, and you'd disappear.

Harold!

I could carve a better man out of a

banana!

Please--

You and your damned bedside manner

and your damned little black bag

full of miracles.  You know who

filled that bag for you?  Not

Alice-sit-by-the-fires like

yourself.  Men with guts filled it,

by God--men with guts enough to pay

the price for miracles--suffering,

ingratitude, loneliness, death--

Good Lord.

I can just hear the editorial wee-

wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I

start flying in pacqualinincheewa

root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by-

the-fires now: "We discovered it in

the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we

cure you with it.  Now we lower our

eyes with becoming modesty as we

receive heartfelt thanks."

Oh, bless you, Doctor, bless you--

oh healer, oh protector, oh giver

of life.

He doesn't deserve this!  You don't

know him.  It isn't fair!

He thought he could take my place.

It is now my privilege to give an

unambiguous account of why I don't

think he's man enough to do that.

I thought she was a widow.

You were wrong, you quack!

Awful.

I can't tell you how sorry I am.

Say hello to your mother.

Do say hello to your mother.

I'm taking her to the airport a few

minutes from now.  She's going to

East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.

Tell her to have a nice trip.

Thanks.

I'm going to have to report you to

the Department of Health.

What for?

Quarantine, possibly.  You may be

suffering from a loathsome disease

which the American people could do

without.  Goodbye.

Now that's what I call fun.

Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.

You'll get so you enjoy twitting

weaklings again.  You used to eat

it up.

I did?

We were one hell of a pair--and

we'll be one again.  What we need

is a honeymoon.  Let's start right

now.

A trip, you mean?

I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.

Go out and play.

Play?

Your mother and I do not wish to be

disturbed for three full hours.

He hasn't had breakfast yet.

Buy yourself breakfast.

There we go.

A hundred dollars!

The smallest thing I've got.

Can I get dressed first?

Make it fast.

Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it:

Honeymoon!

It's so--so stark.

You used to like it stark!

Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.

I'm not going to strike you.  I am

going to be as gentle as pie--as

lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't

run away now.  This is your loving

husband approaching.  I'm your

husband.  Society approves!

Good!  You held your ground.

Now--turn around, if you would.

Turn around?

I'm not about to introduce to you a

jungle novelty.  What I have in

mind is massage--a perfectly decent

massage.  Turn around, turn around.

I'm going to touch your shoulders

very gently now.  You mustn't

scream.

So tense, so tense.

You shouldn't have talked to

Norbert that way.

You're thinking with your brain

instead of your body.  That's why

you're so tense!  Forget Norbert.

Relax.  It's body time.

I have a brain.

We all do.  But now it's body time.

Relax.  Ideally, the body of a

woman should feel like a hot water

bottle filled with Devonshire cream.

You feel like a paper bag crammed

with curtain rods.  Think of your

muscles one by one.  Let them go

slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go

blank.  Relax.  That's the idea--

that's my girl.  Now the small of

the back.  Let those knots over

those kidneys unsnarl.

Dad--

Couldn't you have vanished quietly

out the back door?

A hundred dollars for breakfast?

Leave a tip.

I have some change!

Ram it up your ass!

I do beg your pardon.

Those words were illy chosen.

There is tension in all of us here.

Something you must both understand,

however, is that the head of this

household is home, and he is Harold

Ryan, and people do what he says

when he says it.  That's the way

this particular clock is constructed.

Sometimes even I hate that thing.

I've been looking at motorcycles.

Go home!

You ever own a motorcycle?

You're right!  We'll take a trip.

A trip is what we'll take.

I don't want to talk about

motorcycles.  I don't want to talk

about tits.  Go home!

Haven't got one.

And you went home unannounced, too?

I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.

And how were things?

Let's talk about something else.

Alice got married again.

She did?

You didn't even find that out?

There was so much going on.

She married an accountant named

Stanley Kestenbaum.

So that's it! "Kestenbaum,

Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling

"Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought

it was some foreign language.

Otherwise, how are things?

I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.

Dead!

Jesus.

Alice is dead?

No, no--shit no.

Excuse me, Penelope.

For what?

For saying "shit." Or is that okay

now?

Who's dead?

My mother-in-law.  Fire engines,

pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--

What happened?

Well--I walked up to the front door.

I was still alive.  Big surprise.

I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs.

Wheeler answered.  She had her

Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess

who?" She conked right out.

How horrible.

Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any

sense out of Alice.  She found me

holding up the old lady, dead as a

mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You

know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going

to die then and there anyway, even

if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe

not.  I dunno, boy.  That's

civilian life for you.  Who knows

what kills anybody?

Could have happened to anybody.

First Nagasaki--now this.

How about breakfast, wife?

Breakfast?

Scrambled eggs, kippered herring,

fried potatoes--and a whole onion.

I want to eat the onion like an

apple.  Do you understand?

And lots of orange juice--oceans of

orange juice.

Mrs. Wheeler is dead.

All right--bring me a side order of

Mrs. Wheeler.

Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel.

Penelope will bring you some chow.

That is the most heartless

statement I ever heard pass between

human lips.

Which one?

"Bring me a side order of Mrs.

Wheeler."

She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't

hear.  She is experiencing nothing

but pure happiness.  There's

nothing nicer than that.

Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!

What a honeymoon.

Honeymoon temporarily canceled.

The boy should still go out and

exercise.  I have the impression he

never gets any exercise.  He simply

bloats himself with Fig Newtons and

bakes his brains over steam radiators.

You're wrong.

Then let me see him go out and get

some exercise.

Right now!

What kind of exercise?

Beat the shit out of someone who

hates you.

Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it--

nutriment!

We're all going to have to go out

for breakfast.  The cook quit

yesterday.

You're a woman, aren't you?

Then we have a cook.

Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the

nigger now.

People don't use that word any more.

Don't lecture me on race relations.

I don't have a molecule of

prejudice.  I've been in battle

with every kind of man there is.

I've been in bed with every kind of

woman there is--from a Laplander to

a Tierra del Fuegian.

If I'd ever been to the South Pole,

there'd be a hell of a lot of

penguins who looked like me.  Cook!

You leave me so--so without--

without dignity.

People now have dignity when frying

eggs?

They don't have to feel like slaves.

Then go now--and fry with dignity--

sunnyside up.

I dunno, boy.

The educational process.

I guess.  You're lucky you don't

have any old people around here.

She was about to get married again.

She locked me out of the bedroom

last night.

What's funny about that?

You know me, boy.

I should have torn that door off

its hinges.  Should have scrogged

her ears off.  Should have broken

the bed.

What do you want?

Well?

I--I was wondering--is there

anything you shouldn't eat--because

of jungle fever?

I could eat a raw baby crocodile.

The way to get your wife back is in

bed.  Do such a job on her that

she'll be lucky if she can crawl

around on all fours.

We're starving.  Do you mind?

She had two lovers, by the way.

Excuse me.

One of them is the doctor, whose

weapons are compassion,

unselfishness, peacefulness--

maudlin concern.

Huh.

He and his love are like a

retiarius.  Do you know what a

retiarius is?

He's a kind of gladiator who fights

with a knife and a net and doesn't

wear anything but a jockstrap.

How do you know that?

You told me.

When?

When we were up in the tree so

long--with the bats.

Oh.  I'd forgotten.

Fourteen times you told me.  I

counted.

Really?

You'd get this funny look in your

eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh,

Jesus--he's going to tell me what a

retiarius is again."

Sorry.

Let me guess--breakfast is served?

No.

What then?

I do not wish to be scrogged--ever.

I never heard that word, but when I

heard it, I knew it was one thing I

never wanted to have happen to me.

That's what you're supposed to say.

This is not a coy deception.  I do

not want to be scrogged.  I want

love.  I want tenderness.

You don't know you want.  That's

the way God built you!

I will not be scrogged.  I remember

one time I saw you wrench a hook

from the throat of a fish with a

pair of pliers, and you promised me

that the fish couldn't feel.

It couldn't!

I'd like to have the expert opinion

of the fish--along with yours.

Fish can't feel.

Well, I can.  Some injuries,

spiritual or physical, can be

excruciating to me.  I'm not a

silly carhop any more.

Maybe you're right about fish.

When I was a carhop, I didn't feel

much more than a fish would.  But

I've been sensitized.  I have ideas

now--and solid information.  I know

a lot more now--and a lot of it has

to do with you.

Such as?...

The whole concept of heroism--and

its sexual roots.

Tell me about its sexual roots.

It's complicated and I don't want

to go into it now, because it's

bound to sound insulting--even

though nobody means for anybody to

be insulted.  It's just the truth.

I like the truth.  I wouldn't be

alive today if I weren't one of the

biggest fans truth ever had.

Well--part of it is that heroes

basically hate home and never stay

there very long, and make awful

messes while they're there.

Go on.

And they have very mixed feelings

about women.  They hate them in a

way.  One reason they like war so

much is that they can capture enemy

women and not have to make love to

them slowly and gently.  They can

scrog them, as you say--

for revenge.

You learned this in some college

course?

I learned a lot of things in

college.  Actually--it was Norbert

who told me that.

The doctor.

Yes.

And what is his most cherished

possession?

His most cherished possession?  His

violin, I guess.

And he keeps it in his apartment?

Yes.

And no one's there now?

I don't think so.

That's too bad.  I would rather

have him at home--to see what I'm

going to do.

What are you going to do?

He did his best to destroy my most

precious possession, which is the

high opinion women have of me.  I'm

now going to even that score.  I'm

going to break in his door and I'm

going to smash his violin.

No you're not!

Why not?

Because if you do--I'll leave you.

Goodbye.

We have this new club up here in

Heaven.

Yes, we do.

We only have two members so far,

but it's growing all the time.

We have enough for a shuffleboard

team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is

everything.  Hitler plays

shuffleboard.

Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.

Mozart plays shuffleboard.

Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in

Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.

Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.

Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White

and the Seven Dwarfs, plays

shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays

shuffleboard.

It was almost worth the trip--to

find out that Jesus Christ in

Heaven was just another guy,

playing shuffleboard.  I like his

sense of humor, though--you know?

He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up

jacket he wears.  You know what it

says on the back? "Pontius Pilate

Athletic Club." Most people don't

get it.  Most people think there

really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic

Club.

We're going to have jackets, aren't

we?

You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan

Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow

streak up the back.

We got very good tailor shops up

here.  They'll make you any kind of

uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you

want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got

this black jacket with a skull and

crossbones over the heart.  He

walks around all hunched over, and

he never looks anybody in the eye,

and written on the back of his

jacket are the words, "Go take a

flying--

leap at the moon."

Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?

I heard you were looking for me.

You were Harold Ryan's third wife.

Right?

Yes.

You want to join the Harold Ryan

Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with

a yellow streak up the back?

Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?

Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday

cake.  I don't really know him.

Thought you were another wife, maybe.

I'm only ten years old.

That's what he wanted--a ten-year-

old wife.  He'd come home from a

war or a safari, and he'd wind up

talking to the little kids.

Won't you please join our club?

Please?

Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes

all the time I've got--and Harold

Ryan is an individual I would

rather forget.  He drove me to

drink.  He drove his first two

wives to drink.

Because he was cruel?

Premature ejaculation.

Ach soooooooooo.

No grown woman is a fan of

premature ejaculation.  Harold

would come home trumpeting and

roaring.  He would the kick the

furniture with his boots, spit into

corners and the fireplace.  He

would make me presents of stuffed

fish and helmets with holes in them.

He would tell me that he had now

earned the reward that only a woman

could give him, and he'd tear off

my clothes.  He would carry me into

the bedroom, telling me to scream

and kick my feet.  That was very

important to him.  I did it.  I

tried to be a good wife.  He told

me to imagine a herd of stampeding

water buffalo.  I couldn't do that,

but I pretended I did.  It was all

over--ten seconds after he'd said

the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip

up his pants, and go outside, and

tell true war stories to the little

kids.  Any little kids.

That is sad.

Is it?

I have this theory about why men

kill each other and break things.

Ja?

Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I

was going to say it was all

sexual..but everything is

sexual...but alcohol.

Peace.

Ha ha ha ha ha!

You got me, pal.

Go to the funeral?

Of course!  Not only go to it but

go to it in full uniform!  Rent a

uniform!

That's against the law, isn't it?

I can't wear a uniform anymore.

Wear your uniform and every

decoration, and let them despise

you, if they dare.

Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.

When I was a naive young recruit in

Spain, I used to wonder why

soldiers bayoneted oil paintings,

shot the noses off of statues and

defecated into grand pianos.  I now

understand: It was to teach

civilians the deepest sort of

respect for men in uniform--

uncontrollable fear.

To our women.

I didn't know we had any women left.

The world is teeming with women--

ours to enjoy.

Every time I start thinking like

that I get the clap.

This could be my next wife.

Hello.

How are you, honeybunch?

Is Penelope in?

The posies are for her?

I wanted to apologize.

You've come to the right man.

I forgot my vacuum cleaner.

I forget mine for years on end.

Oh my God--

And you are Looseleaf Harper.

Hi.

It's what I've dreamed of all my

life, Looseleaf!  To have a grown

man realize who I was--and faint!

End of Act Two.

Two days later.  The afternoon of

the day of Looseleaf Harper's

mother-in-law's funeral.  You got

it?  Two days later.

You know what happened in Heaven

today?  There was a tornado.  I'm

not kidding you--there was a

Goddamn tornado.  Tore up fifty-six

houses, a dance pavilion and a

Ferris wheel.  Drove a shuffleboard

stick clear through a telephone

pole.  Nobody got killed.  Nobody

ever gets killed.  They just bounce

around a lot.  Then they get up--

and start playing shuffleboard.

I never saw a tornado when I was

alive, and I grew up in Oklahoma.

There's this big, black, funnel-

shaped cloud.  Sounds like a

railroad train without the whistle.

I had to come to Heaven to see a

thing like that.  A lot of people

got photographs.

After the tornado was over, a man

had some film left and he wanted to

take pictures of me--to use up the

roll.  I don't like people who go

around taking pictures of everything.

Nothing's real to some people

unless they've got photographs.

Two days later--right?

I told you the uniform wouldn't help.

It helped more than you know.  Down

deep, people were deeply affected.

You keep on saying "deep" and

"deeply." I wish something good

would happen on the surface sometime.

I can't get over how you guys are

my friends.  Harold Ryan and

Looseleaf Harper are my friends.

Our pleasure.

Eight years you guys were together--

through thick and thin.

For seven and a half of those years

we were heavily drugged--or we

would have been home long before

now, believe me.  We were saved

from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo

Indians, who fed us a strange blue

soup.

Blue soup.

It sapped our will--made us

peaceful and unenterprising.  It

was a form of chemical castration.

We became two more sleepy Indians.

So, kid--how they hanging?  Or

don't you say that to a little kid?

He's a man.

Tell him you're a man.

I'm a man.

We've got to do something to make

this boy's voice change.  I wonder

if we couldn't get bull balls

somewhere, and fry 'em up.

Still miss your mother?

No.

You're free to go to her, if you

want.  If you'd rather be a woman

and run with the women, just say

the word.

Are we really going to find out

where the elephants go to die?

I'd rather go to Viet Nam.

Would somebody please pass me the

catsup?

What you say is, "Pass the fucking

catsup."

Pass the fucking catsup.

I keep thinking about Africa--and

the elephants.

I don't think I'll go.

Of course you'll go!  You're going

to fly the helicopter.

I dunno.

You're so low!  Look at that

beautiful red meat.  You haven't

touched it.

Sorry.  At least you've got a place

to come back to.  I don't have a

place to come back to anymore.

All the more reason to go to Africa.

I dunno. You know.

I used to really love that Alice.

Do you know that?

You know her for what she is now--

garbage.

I dunno.

She was always a rotten wife!  She

was against everything manly you

ever wanted to do.

He was the most daring test pilot

in the country at one time, and his

wife made him quit.  She made him

become a life insurance salesman

instead.

I'd think any woman worth her salt

would be proud to be married to a

test pilot.  I know I would.

She tried to like it.  She was a

very nervous woman.

I could tell that at the funeral.

Would you please pass the fucking

catsup again?  Was it dangerous

testing planes?

I dunno.  Who knows?  You know--

you're up there, and you're in some

plane nobody ever flew before.  You

put her into a dive, and everything

starts screaming and shaking, and

maybe some pipe breaks and squirts

oil or gasoline or hydraulic fluid

in your face.  You wonder how the

hell you ever got in such a mess,

and then you pull back on the

controls, and you black out for a

couple of seconds.  When you come

to, everything's usually fairly

okay--except maybe you threw up all

over yourself.  It's just another

job, but you try and tell Alice that.

Insurance!

You actually sold insurance!

I tried.

I sold him some.  That was the only

insurance I ever sold.

What an awful sound!

Get used to it.

Back door, Paul.

It's possible, of course, that

you'll die in Africa.

I've considered that.

Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the

best preparation you could have.

I just want one true adventure

before I die.

That can be arranged.

Dad?

Who was it?

It's Mom.

Hi, Penelope.

Shut up, you ninny!

You were never to come here again--

for any reason whatsoever!

I came for my clothes.

Sneaking in the back door.

I rang.  It seemed like the proper

door for a servile, worthless

organism to use.

Your clothes are at the city dump

by now.  Perhaps you can get a map

from the Department of Sanitation.

I came for Paul as well.

If he wants to go.

You took him to the funeral, I hear.

He'd never seen a corpse.  He's

seen a dozen now.

A dozen?

It's a big and busy funeral home.

Did you like it, dear?

It isn't a matter of liking.  It's

a matter of getting used to death--

as a perfectly natural thing.

Would you mind leaving?  No woman

ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and

then comes back--for anything.

Unless she has nerve.

More nerve than the doctor, I must

admit.  He hasn't been home for two

days.  Has he suddenly lost

interest in sleep and color

television--and the violin?

He knows you shattered his violin.

I'm dying to hear of his reaction.

The thrill of smashing something

isn't in the smashing, but in the

owner's reactions.

He cried.

About a broomstick and a cigar

box--and the attenuated intestines

of an alley cat.

Two hundred years old.

He feels awful loss--which was

precisely my intention.

He had hoped that someone would be

playing it still--two hundred years

from now.

Hope.

Do you hope with all your heart

that someone will be using this

vacuum cleaner two hundred years

from now?

Fifty years?

You're making a joke.

I'm interested in long-term

expectations.

It's engineered to last about

fifteen years.

Things.  Oh--you silly people and

your things.  Things, things, things.

You and Harold are friends?

He's the most wonderful guy I ever

met, Penelope.  He's the most

complicated guy I ever met.  I

can't believe it, but he's going to

take me to Africa with him.

Things.

You feel I've done a dreadful

thing--leaving him?

If I were married to him, I sure

wouldn't walk out.

Never mind the condition of your

body and your spirit!  Look after

your things, your things!

And you, Colonel?  Let me guess:

You don't know.

I dunno.

Go live in a safe-deposit box--with

your things.

Jesus--I wouldn't want to be

married to him.  You know?

What's this?

I wouldn't want to be married to me.

We're too crazy.  You know?

In what way, pray tell?

I didn't like that violin thing.

That was sad.

Tit for tat--as simple as that.

You never played a violin.

You did?

Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But

after you busted that thing, I got

to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll

start the violin again." That

didn't just belong to Woodly.  That

belonged to everybody.  Maybe he

would have sold it to me, and I

could have some fun.  After you

busted the violin, boy, and

Penelope walked out, I thought to

myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"

Maybe it's time you got out.

Me?

You.

Okay.

Okay.

You're an imbecile.

I know you think that.

Everybody thinks that.

Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on

a city has to be pretty dumb.

The one direct, decisive,

intelligent act of your life!

I don't think so.

It could have been.

If what?

If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said

to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to

let all those people down there

live."

They were enemies.  We were at war.

Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a

lot better, I think, if guys would

say to themselves sometimes,

"Jesus--I'm not going to do that to

the enemy.  That's too much." You

could have been the manufacturer of

that violin there, even though you

don't know how to make a violin,

just by not busting it up.  I could

have been the father of all those

people in Nagasaki, and the mother,

too, just by not dropping the bomb.

I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I

don't think there is one.

Goodbye, Looseleaf.

So long, you guys.

What will you do, Colonel?

I dunno.  Marry the first whore

who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a

job in a motorcycle shop.  So long,

you guys.

Who's going to fly our helicopter now?

What?

We got to get another pilot.

For what?

For Africa.

Do you really think that Harold

Ryan would go to Africa with a

vacuum cleaner salesman?

You invited me.

To make an ass of yourself.

What went wrong?

We're ahead of schedule, that's all.

You're finding out here what you

would have found out in Africa--

that you are a rabbit, born to be

eaten alive.

Gee whiz--

It would have been fun to see you

drop your rifle and run the first

time an elephant charged us.

I wouldn't drop my gun.

You're hollow, like a woman.

I'm smarter than Looseleaf.

He can shoot!  He can hold his

ground!  He can attack!  You're in

your proper profession right now--

sucking up dirt for frumpish

housewives, closet drunkards every

one.

How do you know how I'd act in Africa?

Look how you're acting now!  This

is a moment of truth, and you're

almost crying.  Slug me!

You're my buddy.

Out!  Out!

No matter what you say to me, I

still think you're the greatest guy

I ever knew.

Out!

You--you aren't going to have any

friends left, if you don't watch out.

Thank God!

Well--what have we here?  A family.

Almost a Christmas scene.

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

Just one favor.

Money?  There's plenty of that.

Mildred got the brewery.  You'll

probably get the baseball team.

I want you to tell me that you

loved me once.

I mean it!  I must have that, and

so must Paul.  Tell him that he was

conceived in love, even though you

hate me now.  Tell both of us that

somewhere is our lives was love.

Testimonials of that sort are--are

beyond my range.  I don't do them

well.

That's a failing, I know.

I see.

I don't care.  I don't care if

there was love or not.  That's all

right.  I'm going to go to my room

and close the door.  I don't want

to hear any more.

See how you've upset him.  He was

so merry and hale before you came

home.

How unhappy he's going to be--alone

in his room.

He'll play with his rifle, I expect.

That will cheer him up.

Rifle?

I bought him a twenty-two

yesterday--on the way home from

Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the

good doctor?  Have you two

feathered a love nest somewhere?

He's in East St. Louis with his

mother--visiting an aunt.

Last I heard, his mother was going

alone.

He's afraid of you, Harold.  He

knew you'd want to fight him.  He

doesn't know anything about

fighting.  He hates pain.

And you, a supposedly healthy

woman, do not detest him for his

cowardice?

It seems highly intelligent to me.

What kind of a country has this

become?  The men wear beads and

refuse to fight--and the woman

adore them.  America's days of

greatness are over.  It has drunk

the blue soup.

Blue soup?

An Indian narcotic we were forced

to drink.  It put us in a haze--a

honey-colored haze which was

lavender around the edge.  We

laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When

a bird called, we answered back.

Every living thing was our brother

or our sister, we thought.

Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach

six inches long, and we cried.  We

had a funeral that went on for five

days--for the cockroach!  I sang

"Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine?

Where the hell did I ever learn the

words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf

delivered a lecture on maintenance

procedures for the hydraulic system

of a B-36.  All the time we were

drinking more blue soup, more blue

soup!  Never stopped drinking blue

soup.  Blue soup all the time.

We'd go out after food in that

honey-colored haze, and everything

that was edible had a penumbra of

lavender.

Sounds quite beautiful.

Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't

life, it wasn't death--it wasn't

anything!

Beautiful?  Seven years gone--

like that, like that!  Seven years

of silliness and random dreams!

Seven years of nothingness, when

there could have been so much!

Like what?

Action!  Interaction!  Give and

take!  Challenge and response!

Mom?

What's this?

What's this?

Nothing.

That's a rifle you have?

No.

Of course it is.  Is it loaded?

No.

Open the bolt!

That's a cartridge, if I'm not

mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet,

cartridge case, and fulminate of

mercury percussion cap--all set to go.

I was cleaning it.

Pick up that cartridge and slip it

back into the chamber--where it

belongs.

Gee whiz, Dad--

Welcome to manhood, you little

sparrowfart!  Load that gun!

Dad--

Too late!  It's man to man now.

Protecting your mother from me, are

you?  Protect her!`

He's a child!

With an iron penis three feet long.

Load it, boy.

You're begging him to kill you?

If he thinks he's man enough.

That's really what you want.  You

become furious when people won't

make you dead.

I'm teaching my son to be a man.

So he can kill you.  You hate your

own life that much.  You beg for a

hero to kill you.

I plan to live one hundred years!

No you don't.

If that's the case--what's to

prevent my killing myself?

Honor, I suppose.

What a handsome word.

But it's all balled up in your head

with death.  The highest honor is

death.  When you talk of these

animals, one by one, you don't just

talk of killing them.  You honored

them with death.  Harold--it is not

honor to be killed.

If you've lived a good life, fought

well--

It's still just death, the absence

of life--no honor at all.  It's

worse than the blue soup by far--

that nothingness.  To you, though,

it's the honor that crowns them all.

May I continue with the rearing of

my son?

Load that gun!

Load it!

Then speak, by God!  Can you fight

with words?

I don't want to fight you.

Get mad!  Tell me you don't like

the way I treat your mother!  Tell

me you wish I'd never come home!

It's your house, Dad.

Everybody simply evaporates!

There are guest issues to be fought

out here--or to be argued, at least.

The enemy, the champion of all who

oppose me, is in East St. Louis

with his mother and his aunt!  I

have so far done battle with a

woman and a child and a violin.

The old heroes are going to have to

get used to this, Harold--the new

heroes who refuse to fight.

They're trying to save the planet.

There's no time for battle, no

point to battle anymore.

I feel mocked, insulted, with no

sort of satisfaction in prospect.

We don't have to fight with steel.

I can fight with words.  I'm not an

inarticulate ape, you know, who

grabs a rock for want of a

vocabulary.  Call him up in East St.

Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come

here.

No.

No.

And my son, the only son of Harold

Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a

vanisher, too?

I don't know.  I hope he never

hunts.  I hope he never kills

another human being.

You hope this, too?

I don't know what I hope.  But I

don't think you care what I hope,

anyway.  You don't know me.

You don't know her, either.  I

don't think you know anybody.  You

talk to everybody just the same.

I'm talking to you gently now.

Yeah.  But it's going to get loud

again.

He's right, Harold.  To you, we're

simply pieces in a game--this one

labeled "woman," that one labeled

"son." There is no piece labeled

"enemy" and you are confused.

There won't be anybody out there.

That's the new style: nobody anywhere.

Get out of here.

It's really that bad?

You fool, you fool.

Oh--look at the poor, crucified

violin, would you?

It died for your sins.

This little corpse is intended as a

lesson?

There's a certain amount of

information there.

Lest we forget how cruel you are.

I'm going to call the police.

Don't!

I agree.

This is man to man.

It's healer to killer.  Is that the

same thing?

What brought you back?

The same hairy, humorless old gods

who move you from hither to yon.

"Honor, " if you like.

He's a champion after all.

Of the corpses and cripples you

create for our instruction--when

all we can learn from them is this:

how cruel you are.

This is suicide.

Go get the police.

Stop!

There's going to be no bloodshed

here.  I know how he'll fight--the

only way he can fight: with words.

The truth.

Am I correct?

Yes.

I can defeat him with anything from

flavored toothpicks to siege

howitzers.  But he got it into his

little head that he could come here

and demolish Harold Ryan with words.

The truth!  Correct?

Correct.

What an hallucination!

Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh

dearie me.

You haven't heard me yet.

You intend to crack my eardrums

with your voice?  Will I bleed from

my every orifice?  Who will clean

up this awful mess?

We'll find out now, won't we?

No, we won't.  No matter how it

begins, it will end in death.

Because it always does.  Isn't that

always how it ends, Harold--in death?

There has to be a threat of some

sort, nobility of some sort,

glamour of some sort, sport of some

sort.  These elements are lacking.

You're a filthy, rotten bastard.

Oooooo.  That hurt.

You're old--so old.

Now who's being cruel?

A living fossil!  Like the

cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.

We do survive, don't we?  You're

going to have to apologize, of

course, for calling me a bastard.

That's a matter of form--not

allowing you or anybody to call me

a bastard.  No rush about that.

Just remember to apologize sometime

soon.

You're a son of a bitch.

Yes--well--uh--that's another one

of those statements which more or

less automatically requires an

apology.  Whenever you feel like it.

It's sort of like turning off an

alarm clock that's ringing loudly.

Your apology turns off the alarm.

I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm

turning off everything.

Ah!  The lady is armed.

I want you to get out of here,

Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit

down in the chair, and not lift a

finger until Norbert is gone.

Whoever has the gun, you see, gets

to tell everybody else exactly what

to do.  It's the American way.

I mean it!

Then you'd better fix your bayonet,

because there aren't any bullets in

the gun.

Where's the bullet?

Help your mother find the bullet.

There it is.  Give it to me.

How do I load?

Load it for her.

Cock it, too.

Give it to her.

All right!  Am I exceedingly

dangerous now?

The National Safety Council would

be appalled.

Then listen to me.

You're both disgusting--with your

pride, your pride.

I hate you for coming here--like a

federal marshal in a western film.

I loved you when you stayed away.

But here you are now--high noon in

the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.

Everything's going to be beautiful.

You fake!  You're no better than

the dumbest general in the Pentagon.

You're not going to beat Harold.

You're not going to beat anybody.

You're not going to stay here,

either--yammering and taunting

until you're most gloriously killed.

Go home!

She's right, Norbert--go home.

I haven't said all I have to say.

Out!

I haven't told you, Harold, how

comical I think you are.

Comical?

Sit down or I'll shoot!

Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now

get out of here, or I might kill

you.  Who knows?

You've killed women?

Seventeen of them--eleven by

accident.  March!  Move!

You, too!

Norbert--you come, too.

Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.

Of course he can go--if he'll just

go down on his hands and knees for

a moment--and promise me that he

does not find me comical in the

least degree.

Do it, Norbert.

Hands and knees, you say?

And terror, if you don't mind.

Do it!

Goodbye.

Goodbye!  Goodbye!

Get the police!  No time to lose!

You're in one hell of a jam.  You

realize that?

I'm high as a kite.

Glands.  You're supposed to be

happy when you die.  Call me

comical again.

You're a clown.  You're a clown who

kills--but you're a clown.

I love you!  Have a cigar!

Evolution has made you a clown--

with a cigar.  Simple butchers like

you are obsolete!

I'm to be left behind--in primordial

ooze?

If you're at home in the ooze, and

nowhere else.

This is going to become very

physical.  Are you prepared for that?

You're not such a creature of the

ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.

I'm an honorable clown?

King Arthur.

You hope.

In any event, I will not beg for

mercy.

No quarter asked.

No quarter given.

Don't you laugh even inwardly at

the heroic balderdash you spew?

Cut me open.  Find out.

I've struck my blow.

With spittle?

I've poisoned you.

Lucretia Borgia?

Something I drank or touched?

You refused a cigar.  That's it!

Potassium cyanide in the humidor!

Treacherous lover of peace!

I put a poisoned thought in your

head.  Even now that poison is

seeping into every lobe of your

mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete,

obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown,

clown, clown."

Poison.

You have a very good mind, or I

wouldn't have come back.  That mind

is now asking itself, cleverly and

fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a

clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."

I--I really must congratulate you.

Something is happening in there.

You can never take yourself

seriously again!  Look at all the

creatures you've protected us from!

Did you shoot them on the elevator,

as they were on their way up here

to eat us alive?

No.

The magic root you gave me--I had

it analyzed.  It was discovered by

a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He

explored your famous jungle for

five years, armed with nothing but

kindness, a talent for languages,

and a pocketknife.

I see.

You aren't going to hurt me.  You

aren't going to hurt anybody any

more.  Any violent gesture will

seem ridiculous--to yourself!

Don Quixote.

My violin is avenged!

Something seems to have happened to

my self-respect.

And the hell with it.  It was so

tragically irrelevant, so

preposterously misinformed.

The new hero is you.

I hate crowds, and I have no

charisma--

You're too modest.

But the new hero will be a man of

science and of peace--like me.

He'll disarm you, of course.  No

more guns, no more guns.

Was I ever of use?

Never.  For when you began to kill

for the fun of it, you became the

chief source of agony of mankind.

Here.  Finish the job.

I'm utterly satisfied.

You're making a mistake.  Obsolete

old carnivores like me are most

dangerous when wounded.  You've

wounded me.

More clowning!  Don't you see?

We never quit fighting until we're

dead.

You'd be killing a friend.  Don't

you know how much I like you?

I'm going to shoot you now.

No!

My self-respect is gone--and my

soldier's honor with it.  It is now

very easy for me to shoot an

unarmed man.

New dignity can be yours--as a

merciful man.  You can change!

Like the saber-toothed tiger.

Oh God--you're really going to kill

me.

It won't hurt as much as the sting

of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very

much like Paradise, they say.

You'll like it there.

Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?

If you want to be found that way.

What is this thing that kills me?

Man, as man was meant to be--a

vengeful ape who murders.  He will

soon be extinct.  It's time, it's

time.

Don't shoot.

I've enjoyed being man.

No.

No.

Get up.

No.

Have it your way.  We'd both be

better off dead now.

Can't do it.

Thank God.

Crawl home.

Thank you--for my life.

It's trash now, like mine.

New lives begin!

Somewhere in this city.  Not here,

not here.  Tell Penelope I loved

her--in my clownish way.  And Paul.

Tell him to be a healer, by all means.

What are you going to do?

Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.

Leave the rifle here.

I'll put it in Paul's room, where

it belongs.

Give me your word of honor that

that's all you're going to do.

For what it's worth now, Harold

Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred

word.

Harold?

Harold?

I missed.

The end.
