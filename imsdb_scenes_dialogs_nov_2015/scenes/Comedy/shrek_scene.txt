Once upon a time there was a lovely

princess. But she had an enchantment

upon her of a fearful sort which could

only be broken by love's first kiss.

She was locked away in a castle guarded

by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.

Many brave knights had attempted to

free her from this dreadful prison,

but non prevailed. She waited in the

dragon's keep in the highest room of

the tallest tower for her true love

and true love's first kiss. (laughs)

Like that's ever gonna happen. What

a load of - (toilet flush)

Think it's in there?

All right. Let's get it!

Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that

thing can do to you?

Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's

bread.

Yes, well, actually, that would be a

giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse.

They'll make a suit from your freshly

peeled skin.

No!

They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the

jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's

quite good on toast.

Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

(waves the torch at Shrek.)

This is the part where you run away.

(The men scramble to get away. He laughs.)

And stay out! (looks down and picks

up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted.

Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and

throws the paper over his shoulder.)

All right. This one's full. Take it

away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!

Next!

(taking the witch's broom) Give me that!

Your flying days are over. (breaks the

broom in half)

That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch.

Next!

Get up! Come on!

Twenty pieces.

(crying) This cage is too small.

Please, don't turn me in. I'll never

be stubborn again. I can change. Please!

Give me another chance!

Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

Oh!

Next! What have you got?

This little wooden puppet.

I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his

nose grows)

Five shillings for the possessed toy.

Take it away.

Father, please! Don't let them do this!

Help me!

Next! What have you got?

Well, I've got a talking donkey.

Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings,

if you can prove it.

Oh, go ahead, little fella.

Well?

Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little

nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox.

Talk, you boneheaded dolt...

That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends

to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to

talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing

you ever saw.

Get her out of my sight.

No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

Hey! I can fly!

He can fly!

He can fly!

He can talk!

Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm

a flying, talking donkey. You might

have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly

but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey

fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins

to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink

to the ground.)

Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.)

After him!

He's getting away! Get him! This way!

Turn!

You there. Ogre!

Aye?

By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized

to place you both under arrest and transport

you to a designated resettlement facility.

Oh, really? You and what army?

Can I say something to you? Listen,

you was really, really, really somethin'

back here. Incredible!

Are you talkin' to...(he turns around

and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back

around and Donkey is right in front

of him.) Whoa!

Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell

you that you that you was great back

here? Those guards! They thought they

was all of that. Then you showed up,

and bam! They was trippin' over themselves

like babes in the woods. That really

made me feel good to see that.

Oh, that's great. Really.

Man, it's good to be free.

Now, why don't you go celebrate your

freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

But, uh, I don't have any friends. And

I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey,

wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll

stick with you. You're mean, green,

fightin' machine. Together we'll scare

the spit out of anybody that crosses

us.

Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you

don't mind me sayin', if that don't

work, your breath certainly will get

the job done, 'cause you definitely

need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause

you breath stinks! You almost burned

the hair outta my nose, just like the

time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey

continues to talk, so Shrek removes

his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten

berries. I had strong gases leaking

out of my butt that day.

Why are you following me?

I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause

I'm all alone, There's no one here beside

me, My problems have all gone, There's

no one to deride me, But you gotta have

faith...

Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't

have any friends.

Wow. Only a true friend would be that

cruelly honest.

Listen, little donkey. Take a look at

me. What am I?

(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really

tall?

No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your

torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that

bother you?

Nope.

Really?

Really, really.

Oh.

Man, I like you. What's you name?

Uh, Shrek.

Shrek? Well, you know what I like about

you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me

thing. I like that. I respect that,

Shrek. You all right. (They come over

a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.)

Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live

in place like that?

That would be my home.

Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.

You know you are quite a decorator.

It's amazing what you've done with such

a modest budget. I like that boulder.

That is a nice boulder. I guess you

don't entertain much, do you?

I like my privacy.

You know, I do too. That's another thing

we have in common. Like I hate it when

you got somebody in your face. You've

trying to give them a hint, and they

won't leave. There's that awkward silence.

(awkward silence) Can I stay with you?

Uh, what?

Can I stay with you, please?

(sarcastically) Of course!

Really?

No.

Please! I don't wanna go back there!

You don't know what it's like to be

considered a freak. (pause while he

looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do.

But that's why we gotta stick together.

You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

Okay! Okay! But one night only.

Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)

What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto

a chair.) No! No!

This is gonna be fun! We can stay up

late, swappin' manly stories, and in

the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

Oh!

Where do, uh, I sleep?

(irritated) Outside!

Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean,

I don't know you, and you don't know

me, so I guess outside is best, you

know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek

slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do

like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was

born outside. I'll just be sitting by

myself outside, I guess, you know. By

myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's

no one here beside me...

(to Donkey) I thought I told you to

stay outside.

(from the window) I am outside.

Well, gents, it's a far cry from the

farm, but what choice do we have?

It's not home, but it'll do just fine.

(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.

Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes

and lands on his shoulder.)

I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's

ear)

Ow!

Blah! Awful stuff.

Is that you, Gordo?

How did you know?

Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are

you doing in my house? (He gets bumped

from behind and he drops the mice.)

Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves

with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no,

no, no. Dead broad off the table.

Where are we supposed to put her? The

bed's taken.

Huh?

What?

I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm

a terrifying ogre! What do I have to

do get a little privacy? (He opens the

front door to throw the Wolf out and

he sees that all the collected Fairy

Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh,

no. No! No!

What are you doing in my swamp? (this

echoes and everyone falls silent.)

All right, get out of here. All of you,

move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya!

Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more

dwarves run inside the house) No, no!

No, no. Not there. Not there. (they

shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to

look at Donkey)

Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite

them.

Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

What?

We were forced to come here.

(flabbergasted) By who?

Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed

and he...signed an eviction notice.

(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where

this Farquaad guy is?

Oh, I do. I know where he is.

Does anyone else know where to find

him? Anyone at all?

Me! Me!

Anyone?

Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know!

Me, me!

(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy

tale things. Do not get comfortable.

Your welcome is officially worn out.

In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad

right now and get you all off my land

and back where you came from! (Pause.

Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey)

You! You're comin' with me.

All right, that's what I like to hear,

man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart

friends, off on a whirlwind big-city

adventure. I love it!

(singing) On the road again. Sing it

with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get

on the road again.

What did I say about singing?

Can I whistle?

No.

Can I hum it?

All right, hum it.

That's enough. He's ready to talk.

(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs

and plays with them) Run, run, run,

as fast as you can. You can't catch

me. I'm the gingerbread man.

You are a monster.

I'm not the monster here. You are. You

and the rest of that fairy tale trash,

poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell

me! Where are the others?

Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's

eye.)

I've tried to be fair to you creatures.

Now my patience has reached its end!

Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to

pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)

No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop

buttons.

All right then. Who's hiding them?

Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the

muffin man?

The muffin man?

The muffin man.

Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives

on Drury Lane?

Well, she's married to the muffin man.

The muffin man?

The muffin man!

She's married to the muffin man.

My lord! We found it.

Then what are you waiting for? Bring

it in.

(in awe) Ohhhh...

Magic mirror...

Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks

him up and dumps him into a trash can

with a lid.) No!

Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall.

Is this not the most perfect kingdom

of them all?

Well, technically you're not a king.

Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a

hand mirror and smashes it with his

fist.) You were saying?

What I mean is you're not a king yet.

But you can become one. All you have

to do is marry a princess.

Go on.

(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back

and relax, my lord, because it's time

for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

And here they are! Bachelorette number

one is a mentally abused shut-in from

a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi

and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies

include cooking and cleaning for her

two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.

(shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette

number two is a cape-wearing girl from

the land of fancy. Although she lives

with seven other men, she's not easy.

Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and

find out what a live wire she is. Come

on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows

picture of Snow White) And last, but

certainly not last, bachelorette number

three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded

castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!

But don't let that cool you off. She's

a loaded pistol who likes pina colads

and getting caught in the rain. Yours

for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows

picture of Princess Fiona) So will it

be bachelorette number one, bachelorette

number two or bachelorette number three?

Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!

Three? One? Three?

Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number

three, my lord!

Okay, okay, uh, number three!

Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess

Fiona.

Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I

have to do is just find someone who

can go...

But I probably should mention the little

thing that happens at night.

I'll do it.

Yes, but after sunset...

Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona

my queen, and DuLoc will finally have

the perfect king! Captain, assemble

your finest men. We're going to have

a tournament. (smiles evilly)

But that's it. That's it right there.

That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.

So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

Uh-huh. That's the place.

Do you think maybe he's compensating

for something? (He laughs, but then

groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke.

He continues walking through the parking

lot.)

Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.

Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing

a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad,

screams and begins running through the

rows of rope to get to the front gate

to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second.

Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just

- - I just - - (He sighs and then begins

walking straight through the rows. The

attendant runs into a wall and falls

down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then

continue on into DuLoc.)

It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?

Hey, look at this!

Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town

Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready

to run over and pull the lever again)

(grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still)

No. No. No, no, no! No.

Brave knights. You are the best and

brightest in all the land. Today one

of you shall prove himself...

All right. You're going the right way

for a smacked bottom.

Sorry about that.

That champion shall have the honor -

- no, no - - the privilege to go forth

and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona

from the fiery keep of the dragon. If

for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,

the first runner-up will take his place

and so on and so forth. Some of you

may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing

to make. (cheers) Let the tournament

begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is

that? It's hideous!

(turns to look at Donkey and then back

at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice.

It's just a donkey.

Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who

kills the ogre will be named champion!

Have it him!

Get him!

Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps

into a table where there are mugs of

beer)

Go ahead! Get him!

(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just

settle this over a pint?

Kill the beast!

No? All right then. (drinks the beer)

Come on!

Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

Yeah!

The chair! Give him the chair!

Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you

very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try

the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)

Shall I give the order, sir?

No, I have a better idea. People of

DuLoc, I give you our champion!

What?

Congratulations, ogre. You're won the

honor of embarking on a great and noble

quest.

Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest

to get my swamp back.

Your swamp?

Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those

fairy tale creatures!

Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you

a deal. Go on this quest for me, and

I'll give you your swamp back.

Exactly the way it was?

Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

And the squatters?

As good as gone.

What kind of quest?

Let me get this straight. You're gonna

go fight a dragon and rescue a princess

just so Farquaad will give you back

a swamp which you only don't have because

he filled it full of freaks in the first

place. Is that about right?

You know, maybe there's a good reason

donkeys shouldn't talk.

I don't get it. Why don't you just pull

some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle

him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds

his bones to make your bread, the whole

ogre trip.

Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have

decapitated an entire village and put

their heads on a pike, gotten a knife,

cut open their spleen and drink their

fluids. Does that sound good to you?

Uh, no, not really, no.

For your information, there's a lot

more to ogres than people think.

Example?

Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.

(he holds out his onion)

(sniffs the onion) They stink?

Yes - - No!

They make you cry?

No!

You leave them in the sun, they get

all brown, start sproutin' little white

hairs.

No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres

have layers! Onions have layers. You

get it? We both have layers. (he heaves

a sigh and then walks off)

(trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both

have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know,

not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody

loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

I don't care... what everyone likes.

Ogres are not like cakes.

You know what else everybody likes?

Parfaits. Have you ever met a person,

you say, "Let's get some parfait," they

say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"?

Parfaits are delicious.

No! You dense, irritating, miniature

beast of burden! Ogres are like onions!

And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.

Parfaits may be the most delicious thing

on the whole damn planet.

You know, I think I preferred your humming.

Do you have a tissue or something? I'm

making a mess. Just the word parfait

make me start slobbering.

(sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?

You gotta warn somebody before you just

crack one off. My mouth was open and

everything.

Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd

be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We

must be getting close.

Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking

about it's the brimstone. I know what

I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It

didn't come off no stone neither.

Sure, it's big enough, but look at the

location. (laughs...then the laugh turns

into a groan)

Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said

ogres have layers?

Oh, aye.

Well, I have a bit of a confession to

make. Donkeys don't have layers. We

wear our fear right out there on our

sleeves.

Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.

You know what I mean.

You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

No, I'm just a little uncomfortable

about being on a rickety bridge over

a boiling like of lava!

Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside

ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll

just tackle this thing together one

little baby step at a time.

Really?

Really, really.

Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

Just keep moving. And don't look down.

Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.

Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't

look down. (he steps through a rotting

board and ends up looking straight down

into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down!

Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me

off, please!

But you're already halfway.

But I know that half is safe!

Okay, fine. I don't have time for this.

You go back.

Shrek, no! Wait!

Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance

then, shall me? (bounces and sways the

bridge)

Don't do that!

Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces

the bridge again)

Yes, that!

Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to

bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across

the bridge)

No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

You said do it! I'm doin' it.

I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek,

I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground)

Oh!

That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks

towards the castle)

Cool. So where is this fire-breathing

pain-in-the-neck anyway?

Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

(chuckles)

I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

You afraid?

No.

But...

Shh.

Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton

and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong

with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible

response to an unfamiliar situation.

Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might

add. With a dragon that breathes fire

and eats knights and breathes fire,

it sure doesn't mean you're a coward

if you're a little scared. I sure as

heck ain't no coward. I know that.

Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up.

Now go over there and see if you can

find any stairs.

Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for

the princess.

(putting on a helmet) The princess will

be up the stairs in the highest room

in the tallest tower.

What makes you think she'll be there?

I read it in a book once. (walks off)

Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle

the stairs. I'll find those stairs.

I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs

won't know which way they're goin'.

(walks off)

I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it

to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm

the stair master. I've mastered the

stairs. I wish I had a step right here.

I'd step all over it.

Well, at least we know where the princess

is, but where's the...

(os) Dragon!

Donkey, look out! (he manages to get

a hold of the dragons tail and holds

on) Got ya!

Oh! Aah! Aah!

No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh,

what large teeth you have. (the dragon

growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth.

I know you probably hear this all time

from your food, but you must bleach,

'cause that is one dazzling smile you

got there. Do I detect a hint of minty

freshness? And you know what else? You're

- - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure!

I mean, of course you're a girl dragon.

You're just reeking of feminine beauty.

(the dragon begins fluttering her eyes

at him) What's the matter with you?

You got something in your eye? Ohh.

Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay,

but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon

blows a smoke ring in the shape of a

heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm

an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd

work out if you're gonna blow smoke

rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him

up with her teeth and carries him off)

No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

Oh! Oh!

Wake up!

What?

Are you Princess Fiona?

I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to

rescue me.

Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our

first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful,

romantic moment?

Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.

Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should

sweep me off my feet out yonder window

and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

You've had a lot of time to plan this,

haven't you?

(smiles) Mm-hmm.

But we have to savor this moment! You

could recite an epic poem for me. A

ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!

I don't think so.

Can I at least know the name of my champion?

Uh, Shrek.

Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds

out a handkerchief) I pray that you

take this favor as a token of my gratitude.

Thanks!

(surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?

It's on my to-do list. Now come on!

(takes off running and drags Fiona behind

him.)

But this isn't right! You were meant

to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying.

That's what all the other knights did.

Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly

stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek

ignores her and heads for a wooden door

off to the side.) Wait. Where are you

going? The exit's over there.

Well, I have to save my ass.

What kind of knight are you?

One of a kind. (opens the door into

the throne room)

(os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.

I believe it's healthy to get to know

someone over a long period of time.

Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs

worriedly) (we see him up close and

from a distance as Shrek sneaks into

the room) I don't want to rush into

a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally

ready for a commitment of, uh, this

- - Magnitude really is the word I'm

looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that

is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what

are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just

back up a little and take this one step

at a time. We really should get to know

each other first as friends or pen pals.

I'm on the road a lot, but I just love

receiving cards - - I'd really love

to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's

my tail! That's my personal tail. You're

gonna tear it off. I don't give permission

- - What are you gonna do with that?

Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No.

No, no, no. No! Oh!

Hi, Princess!

It talks!

Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's

the trick.

Oh!

Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll

take care of the dragon.

(echoing) Run!

(sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You

did it! You rescued me! You're amazing.

(behind her Donkey falls down the hill)

You're - - You're wonderful. You're...

(turns and sees Shrek fall down the

hill and bump into Donkey) a little

unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed

is great, and thy heart is pure. I am

eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears

his throat.) And where would a brave

knight be without his noble steed?

I hope you heard that. She called me

a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.

The battle is won. You may remove your

helmet, good Sir Knight.

Uh, no.

Why not?

I have helmet hair.

Please. I would'st look upon the face

of my rescuer.

No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

But how will you kiss me?

What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the

job description.

Maybe it's a perk.

No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know

how it goes. A princess locked in a

tower and beset by a dragon is rescued

by a brave knight, and then they share

true love's first kiss.

Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait.

Wait. You think that Shrek is you true

love?

Well, yes.

You think Shrek is your true love!

What is so funny?

Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona:

Of course, you are. You're my rescuer.

Now - - Now remove your helmet.

Look. I really don't think this is a

good idea.

Just take off the helmet.

I'm not going to.

Take it off.

No!

Now!

Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.

(takes off his helmet)

You- - You're a- - an ogre.

Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is

all wrong. You're not supposed to be

an ogre.

Princess, I was sent to rescue you by

Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who

wants to marry you.

Then why didn't he come rescue me?

Good question. You should ask him that

when we get there.

But I have to be rescued by my true

love, not by some ogre and his- - his

pet.

Well, so much for noble steed.

You're not making my job any easier.

I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.

You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he

wants to rescue me properly, I'll be

waiting for him right here.

Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all

right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy.

(he swiftly picks her up and swings

her over his shoulder like she was a

sack of potatoes)

You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

Ya comin', Donkey?

I'm right behind ya.

Put me down, or you will suffer the

consequences! This is not dignified!

Put me down!

Okay, so here's another question. Say

there's a woman that digs you, right,

but you don't really like her that way.

How do you let her down real easy so

her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't

get burned to a crisp and eaten?

You just tell her she's not your true

love. Everyone knows what happens when

you find your...(Shrek drops her on

the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to

DuLoc the better.

You're gonna love it there, Princess.

It's beautiful!

And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?

What's he like?

Let me put it this way, Princess. Men

of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.

(he and Donkey laugh)

I don't know. There are those who think

little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona:

Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're

just jealous you can never measure up

to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.

But I'll let you do the "measuring"

when you see him tomorrow.

(looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow?

It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop

to make camp?

No, that'll take longer. We can keep

going.

But there's robbers in the woods.

Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting

to sound good.

Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything

we're going to see in this forest.

I need to find somewhere to camp now!

Hey! Over here.

Shrek, we can do better than that. I

don't think this is fit for a princess.

No, no, it's perfect. It just needs

a few homey touches.

Homey touches? Like what? (he hears

a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona

who has torn the bark off of a tree.)

A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee

good night. (goes into the cave and

puts the bark door up behind her)

You want me to read you a bedtime story?

I will.

(os) I said good night!

Shrek, What are you doing?

(laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh,

come on. I was just kidding.

And, uh, that one, that's Throwback,

the only ogre to ever spit over three

wheat fields.

Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future

from these stars?

The stars don't tell the future, Donkey.

They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut,

the Flatulent. You can guess what he's

famous for.

I know you're making this up.

No, look. There he is, and there's the

group of hunters running away from his

stench.

That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little

dots.

You know, Donkey, sometimes things are

more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.

(heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what

we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

Our swamp?

You know, when we're through rescuing

the princess.

We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's

no "our". There's just me and my swamp.

The first thing I'm gonna do is build

a ten-foot wall around my land.

You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real

deep just now. You know what I think?

I think this whole wall thing is just

a way to keep somebody out.

No, do ya think?

Are you hidin' something?

Never mind, Donkey.

Oh, this is another one of those onion

things, isn't it?

No, this is one of those drop-it and

leave-it alone things.

Why don't you want to talk about it?

Why do you want to talk about it?

Why are you blocking?

I'm not blocking.

Oh, yes, you are.

Donkey, I'm warning you.

Who you trying to keep out?

Everyone! Okay?

(pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.

(grins)

Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and

walks over to the edge of the cliff

and sits down)

What's your problem? What you got against

the whole world anyway?

Look, I'm not the one with the problem,

okay? It's the world that seems to have

a problem with me. People take one look

at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big,

stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before

they even know me. That's why I'm better

off alone.

You know what? When we met, I didn't

think you was just a big, stupid, ugly

ogre.

Yeah, I know.

So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small

and Annoying.

Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny

one, right there. That one there?

That's the moon.

Oh, okay.

Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror,

show her to me. Show me the princess.

Hmph.

Ah. Perfect.

(quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like

it like that. Come on, baby. I said

I like it.

Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)

Huh? What?

Wake up.

What? (stretches and yawns)

Good morning. Hm, how do you like your

eggs?

Oh, good morning, Princess!

What's all this about?

You know, we kind of got off to a bad

start yesterday. I wanted to make it

up to you. I mean, after all, you did

rescue me.

Uh, thanks.

Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead

of us. (walks off)

Shrek!

What? It's a compliment. Better out

than in, I always say. (laughs)

Well, it's no way to behave in front

of a princess.

Thanks.

She's as nasty as you are.

(chuckles) You know, you're not exactly

what I expected.

Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people

before you get to know them.

La liberte! Hey!

Princess!

(to Robin Hood) What are you doing?

Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior!

And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses

up her arm while Fiona pulls back in

disgust)...beast.

Hey! That's my princess! Go find you

own!

Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a

little busy here?

(getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't

know who you think you are!

Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please

let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men.

(laughs)

Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

I steal from the rich and give to the

needy.

He takes a wee percentage,

But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty

damsels, man, I'm good.

What a guy, Monsieur Hood.

Break it down. I like an honest fight

and a saucy little maid...

What he's basically saying is he likes

to get...

Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush

grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.

That's bad.

When a beauty's with a beast it makes

me awfully mad.

He's mad, he's really, really mad.

I'll take my blade and ram it through

your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys

'cause I'm about to start...

Man, that was annoying!

Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at

Fiona but she ducks out of the way)

Uh, shall we?

Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins

walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa,

whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come

from?

What?

That! Back there. That was amazing!

Where did you learn that?

Well...(laughs) when one lives alone,

uh, one has to learn these things in

case there's a...(gasps and points)

there's an arrow in your butt!

What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you

look at that? (he goes to pull it out

but flinches because it's tender)

Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so

sorry.

(walking up) Why? What's wrong?

Shrek's hurt.

Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no,

Shrek's gonna die.

Donkey, I'm okay.

You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm

too young for you to die. Keep you legs

elevated. Turn your head and cough.

Does anyone know the Heimlich?

Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help

Shrek, run into the woods and find me

a blue flower with red thorns.

Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on

it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die

Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay

away from the light!

Donkey!

Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

(runs off)

What are the flowers for?

(like it's obvious) For getting rid

of Donkey.

Ah.

Now you hold still, and I'll yank this

thing out. (gives the arrow a little

pull)

(jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the

yankin'.

I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

No, it's tender.

Now, hold on.

What you're doing is the opposite of

help.

Don't move.

Look, time out.

Would you...(grunts as Shrek puts his

hand over her face to stop her from

getting at the arrow) Okay. What do

you propose we do?

Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower,

red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

This would be so much easier if I wasn't

color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.

(os) Ow!

Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! (rips a

flower off a nearby bush that just happens

to be a blue flower with red thorns)

Ow! Not good.

Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head.

(Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just

about...

Ow! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall

over with Fiona on top of him)

Ahem.

(throwing Fiona off of him) Nothing

happend. We were just, uh - -

Look, if you wanted to be alone, all

you had to do was ask. Okay?

Oh, come on! That's the last thing on

my mind. The princess here was just-

- (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he

turns to look at Fiona who holds up

the arrow with a smile) Ow!

Hey, what's that? (nervous chuckle)

That's...is that blood?

There it is, Princess. Your future awaits

you.

That's DuLoc?

Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks

Lord Farquaad's compensating for something,

which I think means he has a really...(Shrek

steps on his hoof) Ow!

Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move

on.

Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried

about Donkey.

What?

I mean, look at him. He doesn't look

so good.

What are you talking about? I'm fine.

(kneels to look him in the eyes) That's

what they always say, and then next

thing you know, you're on your back.

(pause) Dead.

You know, she's right. You look awful.

Do you want to sit down?

Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.

I didn't want to say nothin', but I

got this twinge in my neck, and when

I turn my head like this, look, (turns

his neck in a very sharp way until his

head is completely sideways) Ow! See?

Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.

I'll get the firewood.

Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't

feel my toes! (looks down and yelps)

I don't have any toes! I think I need

a hug.

Mmm. This is good. This is really good.

What is this?

Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.

No kidding. Well, this is delicious.

Well, they're also great in stews. Now,

I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean

weed rat stew. (chuckles)

I guess I'll be dining a little differently

tomorrow night.

Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp

sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff

for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare

- - you name it.

(smiles) I'd like that.

Um, Princess?

Yes, Shrek?

I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs)

Are you gonna eat that?

(chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic?

Just look at that sunset.

(jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's

late. I-It's very late.

What?

Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on

here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't

you?

Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified.

You know, I'd better go inside.

Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to

be afraid of the dark, too, until -

- Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of

the dark.

Good night.

Good night.

Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on

here.

Oh, what are you talkin' about?

I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm

an animal, and I got instincts. And

I know you two were diggin' on each

other. I could feel it.

You're crazy. I'm just bringing her

back to Farquaad.

Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell

the pheromones. Just go on in and tell

her how you feel.

I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides,

even if I did tell her that, well, you

know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause

I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm

- -

An ogre?

Yeah. An ogre.

Hey, where you goin'?

To get... move firewood. (sighs)

Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess,

where are you? Princess?

It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing

no games.

Aah!

Oh, no!

No, help!

Shh!

Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

No, it's okay. It's okay.

What did you do with the princess?

Donkey, I'm the princess.

Aah!

It's me, in this body.

Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to

her stomach) Can you hear me?

Donkey!

(still aimed at her stomach) Listen,

keep breathing! I'll get you out of

there!

No!

Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

Shh.

Shrek!

This is me.

Princess? What happened to you? You're,

uh, uh, uh, different.

I'm ugly, okay?

Well, yeah! Was it something you ate?

'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a

bad idea. You are what you eat, I said.

Now - -

No. I - - I've been this way as long

as I can remember.

What do you mean? Look, I ain't never

seen you like this before.

It only happens when sun goes down.

"By night one way, by day another. This

shall be the norm... until you find

true love's first kiss... and then take

love's true form."

Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know

you wrote poetry.

It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little

girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every

night I become this. This horrible,

ugly beast! I was placed in a tower

to await the day my true love would

rescue me. That's why I have to marry

Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun

sets and he sees me like this. (begins

to cry)

All right, all right. Calm down. Look,

it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.

Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly.

But you only look like this at night.

Shrek's ugly 24-7.

But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this

is not how a princess is meant to look.

Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry

Farquaad?

I have to. Only my true love's kiss

can break the spell.

But, you know, um, you're kind of an

orge, and Shrek - - well, you got a

lot in common.

Shrek?

(to himself) Princess, I - - Uh, how's

it going, first of all? Good? Um, good

for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower

and thought of you because it's pretty

and - - well, I don't really like it,

but I thought you might like it 'cause

you're pretty. But I like you anyway.

I'd - - uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble.

Okay, here we go.

(os) I can't just marry whoever I want.

Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean,

really, who can ever love a beast so

hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly"

don't go together. That's why I can't

stay here with Shrek.

(os) My only chance to live happily

ever after is to marry my true love.

Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how

it has to be. It's the only way to break

the spell.

You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

No! You can't breathe a word. No one

must ever know.

What's the point of being able to talk

if you gotta keep secrets?

Promise you won't tell. Promise!

All right, all right. I won't tell him.

But you should. (goes outside) I just

know before this is over, I'm gonna

need a whole lot of serious therapy.

Look at my eye twitchin'.

I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him,

I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly

runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek!

Shrek, there's something I want...(she

looks and sees the rising sun, and as

the sun crests the sky she turns back

into a human.)

Shrek. Are you all right?

Perfect! Never been better.

I - - I don't - - There's something

I have to tell you.

You don't have to tell me anything,

Princess. I heard enough last night.

You heard what I said?

Every word.

I thought you'd understand.

Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who

could love a hideous, ugly beast?"

But I thought that wouldn't matter to

you.

Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at

him in shock. He looks past her and

spots a group approaching.) Ah, right

on time. Princess, I've brought you

a little something.

What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots

the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that?

Couldn't have been the donkey.

Princess Fiona.

As promised. Now hand it over.

Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece

of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared

out, as agreed. Take it and go before

I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper)

Forgive me, Princess, for startling

you, but you startled me, for I have

never seen such a radiant beauty before.

I'm Lord Farquaad.

Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad

snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord,

for I was just saying a short... (Watches

as Farquaad is lifted off his horse

and set down in front of her. He comes

to her waist.) farewell.

Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have

to waste good manners on the ogre. It's

not like it has feelings.

No, you're right. It doesn't.

Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless

Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage.

Will you be the perfect bride for the

perfect groom?

Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would

make - -

(interrupting) Excellent! I'll start

the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get

married today before the sun sets.

Oh, anxious, are you? You're right.

The sooner, the better. There's so much

to do! There's the caterer, the cake,

the band, the guest list. Captain, round

up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona

on the back of his horse)

Fare-thee-well, ogre.

Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting

her get away.

Yeah? So what?

Shrek, there's something about her you

don't know. Look, I talked to her last

night, She's - -

I know you talked to her last night.

You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if

you two are such good friends, why don't

you follow her home?

Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

I told you, didn't I? You're not coming

home with me. I live alone! My swamp!

Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody!

Especially useless, pathetic, annoying,

talking donkeys!

But I thought - -

Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong!

(stomps off)

Shrek.

Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues

with what he's doing.) What are you

doing?

I would think, of all people, you would

recognize a wall when you see one.

Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed

to go around my swamp, not through it.

It is around your half. See that's your

half, and this is my half.

Oh! Your half. Hmm.

Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.

I did half the work. I get half the

booty. Now hand me that big old rock,

the one that looks like your head.

Back off!

No, you back off.

This is my swamp!

Our swamp.

(grabs the tree branch Donkey is working

with) Let go, Donkey!

You let go.

Stubborn jackass!

Smelly ogre.

Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks

away)

Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through

with you yet.

Well, I'm through with you.

Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always,

"Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now

it's my turn! So you just shut up and

pay attention! You are mean to me. You

insult me and you don't appreciate anything

that I do! You're always pushing me

around or pushing me away.

Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so

bad, how come you came back?

Because that's what friends do! They

forgive each other!

Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive

you... for stabbin' me in the back!

(goes into the outhouse and slams the

door)

Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers,

onion boy, you're afraid of your own

feelings.

(os) Go away!

There you are , doing it again just

like you did to Fiona. All she ever

do was like you, maybe even love you.

(os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a

hideous creature. I heard the two of

you talking.

She wasn't talkin' about you. She was

talkin' about, uh, somebody else.

(opens the door and comes out) She wasn't

talking about me? Well, then who was

she talking about?

Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything.

You don't wanna listen to me. Right?

Right?

Donkey!

No!

Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh)

I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big,

stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?

Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

Right. Friends?

Friends.

So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

What are you asking me for? Why don't

you just go ask her?

The wedding! We'll never make it in

time.

Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's

a will, there's a way and I have a way.

(whistles)

Donkey?

I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a

noogie)

All right, all right. Don't get all

slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All

right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't

had a chance to install the seat belts

yet.

People of DuLoc, we gather here today

to bear witness to the union....

(eyeing the setting sun) Um-

...of our new king...

Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead

to the "I do's"?

(chuckles and then motions to the priest

to indulge Fiona) Go on.

(to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN.

If we need you, I'll whistle. How about

that? (she nods and goes after the guards)

Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You

wanna do this right, don't you?

(at the Church door) What are you talking

about?

There's a line you gotta wait for. The

preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or

forever hold your peace." That's when

you say, "I object!"

I don't have time for this!

Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen

to me! Look, you love this woman, don't

you?

Yes.

You wanna hold her?

Yes.

Please her?

Yes!

(singing James Brown style) Then you

got to, got to try a little tenderness.

(normal) The chicks love that romantic

crap!

All right! Cut it out. When does this

guy say the line?

We gotta check it out.

And so, by the power vested in me...

What do you see?

The whole town's in there.

I now pronounce you husband and wife...

They're at the altar.

...king and queen.

Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

Oh, for the love of Pete!

(running toward the alter) I object!

Shrek?

Oh, now what does he want?

(to congregation as he reaches the front

of the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin'

a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first

of all. Very clean.

What are you doing here?

Really, it's rude enough being alive

when no one wants you, but showing up

uninvited to a wedding...

Fiona! I need to talk to you.

Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little

late for that, so if you'll excuse me

- -

But you can't marry him.

And why not?

Because- - Because he's just marring

you so he can be king.

Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

He's not your true love.

And what do you know about true love?

Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -

Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen

in love with the princess! Oh, good

Lord. (laughs)

An ogre and a princess!

Shrek, is this true?

Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona,

my love, we're but a kiss away from

our "happily ever after." Now kiss me!

(puckers his lips and leans toward her,

but she pulls back.)

(looking at the setting sun) "By night

one way, by day another." (to Shrek)

I wanted to show you before.

Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona

smiles)

Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards!

I order you to get that out of my sight

now! Get them! Get them both!

No, no!

Shrek!

This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This

marriage is binding, and that makes

me king! See? See?

No, let go of me! Shrek!

No!

Don't just stand there, you morons.

Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!

I'll make you regret the day we met.

I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll

beg for death to save you!

No, Shrek!

(hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And

as for you, my wife...

Fiona!

I'll have you locked back in that tower

for the rest of your days! I'm king!

I will have order! I will have perfection!

I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon

show up and the dragon leans down and

eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!

All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon

here, and I'm not afraid to use it.

(The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on

the edge!

Celebrity marriages. They never last,

do they?

Go ahead, Shrek.

Uh, Fiona?

Yes, Shrek?

I - - I love you.

Really?

Really, really.

(smiles) I love you too.

Aawww!

"Until you find true love's first kiss

and then take love's true form. Take
