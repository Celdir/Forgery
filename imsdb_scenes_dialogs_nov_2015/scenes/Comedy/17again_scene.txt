EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK

A few cars scatter the parking lot. WE hear GRUNTS followed

by the distinct sound of basketballs shredding net.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - CONTINUOUS

An empty gymnasium except for a shirtless MIKE O'DONNELL, 17.

Mike stands feet BEYOND the 3 point line, grabs balls from a

hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots.

SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. This kid's automatic.

Mike's hair, a pompadour mullet a la `21 Jump Street' and

short shorts circa 1989.

Mustached and curly haired COACH HARVEY, 40, enters.

Mike sinks one last jumper, turns to the Coach.

Coach Harvey hands Mike a towel.

The rest of the FITCH FALCONS basketball team jogs out from

the locker room followed by a PHOTOGRAPHER.

The Team assembles in the middle of the court. A PLAYER

kneeling in front holds a sign, `FITCH FALCONS, 1989'.

DOM, 17, handsome, tall, long rat tail, scoffs-

A shoving match breaks out between Mike and Dom.

Coach Harvey pulls the Players apart just as the gym doors

burst open. ED FREEDMAN, 17, sporting a jacket over a WIZARD

costume, runs in, trips on his robe, gets up, peels his

clothes off.

Ed takes a spot next to Dom.

WE see Dom reach behind Ed, grab hold of his

underwear...RRRRIIIPP...FLASH. And with the flash WE cut to:

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT

The Falcons run, pass and shoot on one end of the court.    On

the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE warms up.

Lights dim. Cue MC Hammer's `Can't Touch This'. CHEERLEADERS

at center court perform the Hammer DANCE ROUTINE. PAN around

the gym, everybody's doing the Hammer dance.

Ed awkwardly tries to imitate Mike.

Coach shakes his head in disgust and when the routine ends-

The Falcons swarm to the bench, take seats.     Ed hands waters

to the Players, skips Dom, stops at Mike.

Ed jerks around to blatantly stare at her.

Ed flashes a goofy smile.   MUFFY mimes puking.

SCARLET, 17, an 80's beauty, stands at the end of the bench.

Dom dribbles past, smiles at Scarlet.

She smiles nervously, lies...

Totally?                           Totally.

REFEREE blows the whistle.

He kisses her cheek, starts off, turns back-

LONG SHOT: We hear nothing but see Mike's body deflate. He

steps away from Scarlet towards center court.

Muffy and her friends mock Ed and laugh hysterically

Mike, in a daze walks right past Ed. Takes his place for the

jump ball. The Crowd stomps and cheers LOUDLY.

The Ref is about to toss the ball. Mike looks up at the

stands, sees a crushed Scarlet heading for the exit. Mike's

torn. Play or go after her. He goes after her.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/TUNNEL - NIGHT

Mike rushes in.

She turns, slumps against the wall.    Mike catches up to her.

Mike leans in and kisses Scarlet.

EXT. PALISADES NEIGHBORHOOD. PRESENT DAY - MORNING

Opulent HOMES.   OCEAN views.   Luxury CARS.   Manicured LAWNS.

The sound of an alarm clock shatters the silence as WE settle

in on a large, MEDITERRANEAN STYLE HOUSE.

INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

MIKE O'DONNELL, now 36, angrily slaps the alarm off...6 AM.

He climbs out of bed, bones creaking, stiff, groans.

INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

A showered, suited Mike stands before the mirror, knots a tie

around his neck.

Mike yanks his tie straight up as if he were hanging himself.

INT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING

ED FREEDMAN, now 36, lies on a portable table in his boxers.

ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES protrude from every inch of his body,

neck and face...at least 5000 needles.

A HOT, YOUNG ACUPUNCTURIST adds more to him.

Mike enters, shakes his head in amusement.

Ed looks over, sees Mike watching.

Ed climbs slowly off the table, shuffles over, groaning in

pain the entire way. He pours himself a shot of BROWN LIQUID

from a pitcher, throws the shot back and immediately SPITS it

all over the place.

Ed drags painfully back to the Acupuncturist.

EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - MORNING

Mike wheels his Audi A4 below a nondescript, two level

building. Sign reads, `Wyatt Pharmaceuticals'.

INT. WYATT PHARMACEUTICALS/CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG POSTERS cover the walls.    Smiling faces,

happy couples...little pills.

Surrounding a conference table are Mike's colleagues...HOT

WOMEN, 20 to 35, in skimpy business suits, chatting away.

Mike sits amongst them, the only male present. A glum look

on his face. WENDY, bubbly, ditsy, 22, leans over to him.

ROGER, 23, boss, strides through the door.

Mike straightens his tie, buttons his suit jacket.

Dumbfounded, Mike slumps back into his seat.    Wendy springs

up out of hers, SCREAMING and BOUNCING.

The Women stream out.

Mike swallows his pride and exits.

EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DUSK

Mike pulls into the empty parking lot, climbs out of his car

and into the building.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DUSK

Mike hurries down the hall, opens a door, peeks his head in.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DUSK

Mike peers around...nobody.

No answer. A basketball sits in the middle of the floor.

Mike enters, picks up the ball, begins dribbling...faster,

between his legs, around his back, up to the 3 point line-

Mike hits a perfect jumper at the imaginary buzzer, smiles.

Mike dashes for the bouncing ball, scoops it up, goes for a

reverse lay up, makes it but when he lands...he

lands...CRACK...hard. Mike grabs his lower back, groans-

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DUSK

Mike limps out of the gym, wanders over to a wall covered in

PHOTOGRAPHS...Fitch basketball teams of the past.

Mike searches the pictures until he finds it...the photo WE

saw being taken earlier...the team of 1989. Ed mid howl from

Dom's wedgy.

Mike stares at the photograph...lost in time and thought.

The smiling, confident image of his youth stares back at him.

Mike startles from his daydream, turns. A kind-faced, old

JANITOR, stands behind him, mop in hand.

The Janitor leans in, takes a closer look at Young Mike.

Michael wistfully eyes the old photo, looks back to the

JANITOR-

ALEX, 15, messy hair and slight, and MAGGIE, 17 and awkwardly

pretty, appear at the other end of the hall.

Mike looks back to the Janitor...GONE.

They make their way towards the door.    Mike limping.

INT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - NIGHT

Mike, Alex and Maggie sit before dinner.    Alex eats heartily.

Maggie quietly pushes her food around.

Maggie stifles a laugh.

Father and Son touch fists.

Maggie rolls her eyes.

Mike forces a smile hiding his disappointment.

EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY/MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Mike pulls up behind a `Dom's Nursery' van. He, Alex and

Maggie step out. Mike eyes the van with disdain.

Maggie heads straight for the modest ranch house and inside.

Alex follows Maggie into the house.   Mike makes his way

around back.

EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY

As Mike rounds the corner, he almost runs into a smiling Dom

Johnson, 36. Don lugs 3 loaded trash bags.

Dom serves Mike a cocky wink, continues on.    Mike scowls.

Scarlet, 36, slams a shovel into the ground, wedges it

beneath a dying shrub and rips it out.

Mike smiles playfully and begins to serenade-

Scarlet shakes her head-

Mike flirtatiously stalks her.   Scarlet fights smiling.

Mike gets close to Scarlet's face. She smiles, stops herself

and pushes him away.

A chastised Mike eyes the yard...it's a WRECK...holes and

mounds of dirt everywhere, carcasses of dead plants, bushes

and flowers strewn about.

Scarlet stops shoveling, wipes dirt from her face.

An awkward silence.   Then-

Scarlet throws the shovel to the ground.

Mike's silence says it all.    Scarlet fights back tears.

Scarlet shakes her head in frustration.

Scarlet goes back to shoveling.    Mike turns, steps, falls

into a hole.

INT. MIKE'S AUDI - NIGHT

A somber Mike drives alongside the Los Angeles River. An old

song plays low on the radio...static...then...BOOM. THUNDER

roars scaring Mike and literally shaking the Audi. SPLASH.

RAIN drops in buckets.

Mike turns the wipers on high. Not much help. He slows the

car to a crawl, straining to see out the windshield.

LIGHTNING flashes. We see the Janitor leaning over the

railing looking into the raging river. Mike brakes, throws

his door open, jumps out into the pouring rain.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Mike, blinded by the rain makes his way to the railing. The

Janitor's GONE.

Mike leans over the rickety railing, looks down...

The phosphorescent water swirls angrily...rising quickly.

It's mesmerizing. Magical. Mike can't take his eyes off-

LIGHTENING FLASHES Mike's 17 year-old face reflection stares

back up at him.

CRACK. The railing BREAKS.    Mike FALLS...SPLASH...headlong

into the river.

EXT. ED'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

Mike's Audi rolls into the driveway. The door swings open.

A muddy, shoeless foot steps out followed by a shoed foot but

in no better shape.

WE follow the feet, tattered slacks dragging on the cement,

to the door. 2 filthy hands dig into pockets, searching-

INT. ED'S HOUSE - MORNING

Ed, wrapped in a robe, tissue between his toes, wobbles to

the door so as not to mess up his freshly polished nails.

Ed opens the door...standing before him is Mike, covered in

MUD. His ripped, grimy suit now hangs off of him

because...HE'S 17 AGAIN.

Ed's eyes widen with FEAR.

Ed slams the door, frantically wobbles away. The door opens,

ANGLE ON the muddy feet as they enter and follow the trail of

cotton balls up the stairs and to the bathroom door.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

ANGLE ON Ed cowering against the back wall, brandishing an

over-sized loofah. The door slowly swings open. Ed gasps-

A whimpering Ed points to the mirror.

The muddy feet turn toward the mirror and-

ANGLE ON the mirror. Mike's 17. He turns on the water,

splashes his face frantically. Mud gone. He's still 17.

Mike tears his suit jacket and shirt off...hairless chest.

He yanks off his pants, peeks down his boxers-

Mike pulls Ed up by his robe.

Ed throws a knee into Mike's nuts, bolts out the door

SCREAMING. Mike crumbles.

INT. ED'S HOUSE/FOYER - DAY

Ed reaches the door, fumbles with the locks. He just manages

to open the door when Mike tackles him to the floor.

The two buddies roll around, limbs intertwined.

They stop wrestling, look up.   The LATINO MAID stands in the

doorway genuflecting.

The Maid hurries off muttering prayers in Spanish.

EXT. ED'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - LATER

REVEAL Mike in the gurgling green water of the hot tub.

Ed picks up a TOASTER attached to an extension cord.

Ed raises the toaster-

Ed reaches down to plug it in.

CLOSE ON MIKE, Light bulb goes off.   He leaps out, runs for

the house.

The Audi screeches to a stop in front of the school.   Mike

bounds out, wearing a robe, races inside.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY

Mike rushes past baffled STUDENTS, asking no one in

PARTICULAR-

Mike reaches the familiar wall of pictures.    Kids point,

laugh, stare.

A FEMALE JANITOR, steps from a room.

Mike points to the 1989 team photo.

Mike backs away from the picture and the Janitor.

Confused, Mike stumbles to the bathroom. He's about to enter,

three letter jacket wearing JOCKS, STAN, JAZZ and KEVIN,

burst out laughing, knocking Mike on the way by.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/BATHROOM - DAY

Mike enters, moves to a sink, turns the water on-

Mike turns, sees what appears to be UNDERWEAR stretched over

the corner of a closed stall door.

Mike approaches the door, swings it open...there HANGS Alex,

sneakers dangling 3 feet off the ground. The back of his

underwear wrenched up over the corner of the door.

Mike pulls the underwear off the door.   Alex drops, reaches

down his pants, adjusts his underwear.

Alex walks out bowlegged.   A devastated Mike watches him go.

INT. AUDI - MOMENTS LATER

Mike drives off out of the parking lot. To his left he spies-

ANGLE ON: Stan and Maggie making out against Stan's Mustang.

Mike pounds on the horn, scaring them apart.   Drive's off.

INT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ed sits at the island, a laptop in front of him. On the

screen WE see he's perusing www.spellscursesincantations.com.

The sound of the front door opening and closing. Mike enters.

Mike grabs a beer from the fridge, cracks it. As Mike is

about to take a sip, Ed swipes the beer from his hand...CHUGS

it down.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/OFFICE - DAY

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Ed and Mike sit outside Principal's

office. Mike is dressed in an overly exaggerated hip style,

(a grown-ups concept of what's cool- he looks ridiculous).

Ed calms.   Mike pulls a manila folder out of his book bag.

Mike and Ed stand, head for the door marked `Principal'.

Mike and Ed step through the door-

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

MS. GOODWIN, 35, sits behind her desk...she's no hag. She's

an attractive, buttoned-up professional.

Ed's face lights up and without missing a beat-

Ed steps in front of Mike, shakes Ms. Goodwin's hand.

Mike tries to peer around Ed.   Mike finally physically moves

Ed steps aside.

Ed smiles, rubs Mikes head vigorously.   Mike slaps his hand.

Mike and Ed sit.

Ed's smile fades.

Mike hands Julie the folder. As Julie browses through it, Ed

and Mike get into a pinching, elbowing fight. When she looks

up, the friends stop. Both smiling.

Ed's jaw drops.   Julie rises abruptly.

The door opens, in steps LISA, 18.

Mike stands.   Ed addresses him as fatherly as he knows how-

Mike glares at Ed, follows Lisa out.    Ed turns to Julie.

Julie ushers Ed to the door.

Julie shuts the door, shakes her head in disbelief.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY

Mike steps in. Scattered giggles at his appearance. Mike

takes a seat, eyes three sexy girls wearing next to nothing,

SAMANTHA, LAUREN and JAMIE, busy texting on their phones.

A GIRL next to him leans over-

The Jocks, Stan, Jazz and Kevin strut in. Mike's eyes

narrow. Stan stops before Mike, looks him up and down-

Laughter from the class. Mike shies. The Jocks sit, Stan

behind Mike. Just as the last bell rings, Maggie rushes in,

sits with the Bras.

Something catches Maggie's eye.   It's Mike waving to her.

Maggie places a hand over her face, looks down.

MR. ADAMS, 45, prissy, strides in carrying a stack of papers.

Moans from the class. Adams walks up and down the aisle

slapping them down on the desks..

Adams reaches Maggie, drops the test on her desk...

Humiliated, Maggie lowers her head.

Mike angrily stands-

Mr. Adams turns to Mike.

Adams turns, walks back towards the front of the room.

Stan signals his friends, takes out a LIGHTER, flicks it,

leans forward and places the flame BETWEEN Mike's legs.

The flame GLOWS RED against Mike's jeans.   The Jocks and Bras

pull out their cells and begin VIDEOING.

Adams scribbles on a pad-

Adams rips the paper off, holds it out towards Mike.   Mike

sniffs at the air-

Mike LEAPS out of his shoes. A FLAME runs up his crotch.

LAUGHTER. Mike, SCREAMING, runs around the room fanning his

package.

Mike snatches the slip from Adams and out the door.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CAFETERIA - DAY

A packed lunchroom. The CLIQUES sit amongst themselves. WE

notice all the KIDS hunched over STARING AT THEIR PHONES.

Mike enters carrying a bag lunch. A BLACK BURN MARK on the

crotch of his pants. A GAYSIAN spots him, yells-

The entire cafeteria turns to Mike and erupts in laughter.

As Mike passes each table, WE see the kids are watching his

`fire dance' on their phones.

Mike approaches a table of the 3 BIGGEST LOSERS in school,

unkempt hair, fat, acne. Mike begins to sit when-

Mike nods, continues on past the snickering and catcalls

until he sees Maggie and the Wonder Bras.

ANGLE: Wonder Bra Table. Maggie, Samantha, Jamie and Lauren

pick around plates of cafeteria food.

Mike approaches, big smile. The Wonder Bras look off in

every direction except Mike's.

The Girls continue looking away, ignoring Mike.

Mike drops down next to Samantha and across from Maggie.

Mike hides his lunch.

Mike pulls out an OLDER Blackberry phone, looks at the caller

ID...Scarlet. He sends it to voice mail.

The sound of a bouncing ball interrupts.

Mike turns.   Stan, Jazz and Kevin swagger over.

Maggie nods for Mike to go.

Mike stands. Stan pulls Maggie up, starts making out with

her, hands all over her. WE can see Mike's blood BOIL until-

Oops. Stan stops groping, steps over to Mike, a solid foot

taller than him.

Mike looks around...the entire cafeteria watches.   Defeated-

Stan takes Mike's hat off, picks up an ice cream from

Maggie's tray, puts the ice cream in the hat, places it back

on Mike's head and SMUSHES it down.

Flush with humiliation and ice cream dripping down his face,

Mike turns and walks out.

WE see Alex, seated by himself at a back table, shake his

head in disgust.

INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

A beaten down Mike sits alongside Ed at the bar.

The BARTENDER approaches.

The Bartender nods serves up the drinks.   Mike miserably

plucks a cherry off his pink drink.

An OLDER WOMAN takes a seat next to the boys.

The Older Lady, having listened to it all, turns to Ed-

The Lady turns away in disgust.

Mike eyes Ed, considers just how "well adjusted" Ed is. A

determined look comes over Mike. He pounds the bar.

It's the MOMENT.   Mike walks the hallway, handsome and hip.

his face. Man, that felt good.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CAFETERIA - DAY

Mike steps from the kitchen area carrying a TRAY, scans the

crowded room, finds Alex seated at a table ALONE. It's a

heartbreaking image. Mike approaches-

Mike sits across from Alex.

Mike inches left, peeks behind him...2 girls eat lunch

together. The one facing them is a cute Latino, NICOLE, 16.

Nicole smiles.    Alex quickly shies away.

The Wonder Bras sway in, take seats at the VIP table.

Mike rises.

Mike strolls over to the Bras' table, plunks himself down.

Samantha's jaw drops.

The Bras' begin to bicker amongst themselves. Mike pulls out

his new iPhone, plugs the earphones in his ears.

The Bras immediately stop bickering, ogle the phone.

Mike rises from the table.

Stan, carrying a basketball, his goons and Maggie come up

behind Mike.

Stan whips the ball at Mike. Mike, cat-quick, spins around,

catches the ball.

The whole cafeteria turns their attention on Mike and Stan.

Mike points to the name `Stan' on Stan's letter jacket, reads-

Laughter from the Students.

Mike ignores him and starts dribbling.

Mike speaks loudly now, playing to the cafeteria.

Stan and his Posse tap fists. Mike dribbles between his legs.

Mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it.

The entire cafeteria LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY.

Mike feigns whipping it back at Stan, who recoils, then

gently rolls the ball back to Stan.

Some students, including Alex, ERUPT. The Wonder Bras eye

Mike with new found lust.

ANGLE ON Mike's face as he walks away.

Mike ducks just as the ball whizzes overhead, rockets across

with food. She glares at Stan.

INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Scarlet and Mike sit across from one another. Scarlet stares

at Mike as if examining every pore on his face.

Mike spies Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment on a table.

Scarlet can't take her eyes off Mike.

Mike switches subjects, points to her dirty clothes-

Scarlet stands, leads Mike to the french doors.

Scarlet opens the doors, flips on the lights. The yard's

been cleaned up. Fresh blankets of sod rest in piles next to

stacks of limestone. HUNDREDS of unplanted plants, flowers,

trees and shrubs sit around the yard in strategic positions.

EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT

WE find Maggie and the Wonder Bras seated by the fire.

ANGLE: Mike and a nervous Alex make their way down the sand.

Alex turns.   Mike grabs his arm, turns him back.

Mike is stunned.

As a confused Mike and Alex approach the scene, BOYS call out

to Mike, tap his fist. GIRLS fawn over him. Mike's become a

celebrity...and he's eating it up.

ANGLE: Lauren spots Mike with Alex.

The Bras whip their heads around, get all dreamy.

Samantha leaps up, scurries over to Mike.      Lauren and Jamie

chase after her. Maggie shakes her head.

As Mike and Alex approach the gathering, Alex freezes up.

Alex nods towards the fire.   Seated with FRIENDS is Nicole.

Alex BELCHES loudly.

Mike grabs Alex by the shoulders.

A determined look comes over Alex.

Alex takes a deep breath, marches off just as Samantha runs

up and throws her arms around Mike.

Jamie and Lauren rush over.

A full blown ARGUMENT breaks out between the Bras.    Mike sees

Maggie sitting by the fire alone, slips out.

ANGLE: Alex steps over to Nicole and suddenly loses

confidence. As he turns to retreat, Nicole looks up-

Alex stops, turns back around and blurts out-

Nicole and her Friends giggle.

The Girls' jaws drop.    Nicole hides her hands.

Alex rips a huge BURP.    The Girls duck for cover.

Nicole and her Friends MELT.

Nicole scoots over making room next to her.    Alex smiles.

ANGLE: Mike sits down beside Maggie.

Mike loses it, leaps to his feet shouting-

Maggie jumps up.   Kids all stare.

Maggie stomps over to the still bickering Bras.

Maggie and the Bras turn towards Mike and glare.   Maggie

faces of a group of KIDS.

Mike steps from the house, sees Scarlet-

Scarlet tosses a manila envelope on the patio table.

Mike feigns innocence.

Mike starts to argue then gives in-

Mike slips inside the empty classroom, slathers KRAZY GLUE

all over Stan's DESKTOP and CHAIR.

Mike sits just as the rest of the class files in. Stan kisses

Maggie and takes his seat.

Stan leans on his desk, placing a FOREARM and a HAND on the

sticky desktop. He catches Mike looking back at him and

gives him a cocky wink. Mike winks back knowingly.

Mike's phone beeps. He checks it...A PIX MESSAGE...3 perfect

ASSES in tiny bikini bottoms. A wide-eyed Mike spins in his

seat to find the Wonder Bras smiling at him.

Mr. Adams enters.

Adams scribbles a large equation on the blackboard.

Blank, uninterested faces. Scattered giggles.   Adams tosses

the chalk angrily on his desk.

Maggie rises nervously from her seat, shuffles to the front

of the class. As she passes Stan WE see...

Stan lifts his fingers from the desktop...it's WET...he

places his wet fingers to the tip of his nose and smells.

When Stan tries to remove his fingers from his nose...they

STICK. Stan tries to raise his other arm...STUCK.

Stan stands, hunched...the CHAIR GLUED to his butt. The DESK

ATTACHED to his forearm and his FINGERS STUCK to his nose.

The Kids and Mike burst out laughing, break out their video

phones as Stan fumbles around, dragging the desk, PANICKING.

Jazz bounds out of his seat, grabs hold of Stan's wrist.

RRRRIIIIPPPP.    Jazz yanks.   Stan's SCREAM echoes.

Mike, wearing basketball gear and bouncing a basketball,

stands in the middle of the court. Alex enters.

Mike tosses Alex the ball. Alex begins to dribble. Mike

steps up to defend. Alex dribbles quicker, through his legs.

WHAM. The doors slam open. In walk Stan and his Posse.     A

BLOOD speckled BAND-AID covers the tip of Stan's nose.

Alex stops dribbling. He and Mike move towards the door.

Stan and his Posse block the way.

Stan takes the ball from Alex, turns his back, dribbles.

While dribbling, Stan moves backwards, bumping into Alex's

midsection, forcing Alex back.

Alex takes a deep breath, tired of being afraid-

Alex throws his hands up, tries to defend the much bigger

Stan. Stan easily backs Alex down, faking left and right.

Stan spins, elbows high...POW...Alex catches one to the head

and DROPS. Stan shoots and scores.

Stan high 5's Jazz and Kevin. Blind with RAGE, Mike RUSHES

Stan...WHAM...tackles him hard to the floor.

The door swings open.    An elated Ed blows in.

The Secretary's jaw drops.

Ed sits between Mike and Alex.

Ed flashes his pearly whites then blows on Mike. The

principal's door opens, an angry Scarlet steps out.

Scarlet looks sternly to Alex-

Scarlet bends down so she's eye to eye with Mike.   She

removes the ice pack...a purple shiner.

Scarlet strokes Mike's face. Mike loses himself in her

caring, gentle touch.

Scarlet, a bit weirded out by Mike, stands.

Alex shuffles out of the office.   Scarlet turns to Ed, hushed-

Scarlet looks down, fights back tears, unravels a bit...

Scarlet forces a smile. Mike watches her go. For the first

time he's seen HER REALITY...hurt, pain, frustration. Mike

places his head sadly in his hands.

Julie the Principal pokes her head out the door.

Ed whispers to Mike.

As Ed passes Julie on the way in-

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

Ed takes a seat across from Julie, puts on his best `troubled

parent' look.

Ed stifles a laugh, puts on a serious face.

Mike slouches in, takes a seat.

Ed throws his hands up in exasperation.

He shaves his back.                He sucks his thumb.

He wears girls underwear.          He wets his bed.

Mike nods, exits.   Ed stands and with exaggerated sadness-

Ed shakes Julie's hand and exits, sniffling.

EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY

A dirt covered Scarlet wrestles a roll of sod down.

Scarlet peers over her shoulder...Mike wanders in.    Scarlet

stands, wipes her bare, dirty hands on her jeans.

Scarlet laughs, eyes him skeptically-

Mike and Scarlet, step over to the sod, lift a roll together,

carry it over to the spot.

Mike and Scarlet share a laugh.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/LIBRARY - DAY

Mike strolls in, sits at a back table, pulls a college

application from his knapsack. He takes out a pen, places

the tip to the paper where it says `name' when-

WE hear the muffled sound of CRYING. Mike rises, follows the

sobs through the maze of stacks until he finds-

-seated on the floor, head hidden between her knees.   Maggie

looks up, sees Mike, quickly dries her eyes.

Maggie drops her head back between her knees.

Maggie BAWLS loudly.    Mike panics, fearing the worst-

Mike slaps his palms over his ears.

Maggie takes Mike's shirt, BLOWS her nose on it.

Maggie bawls again. Mike silently celebrates, sits beside

her, awkwardly pats her on the back.

Maggie sobs uncontrollably.      Mike takes a deep breath, calms-

Maggie throws her arms around Mike, hugs him tight. Mike

hugs her back. A moment he's never had with his daughter.

ANGLE ON Maggie's face.       She's SMITTEN.

phone. A PIX MESSAGE. Mike opens it. A close up of perfect

CLEAVAGE.

Mike peeks over his shoulder...the Wonder Bras text on their

phones. He's confused until-

seductively at him, blows a kiss. Mike GASPS, spins back

around...TRAUMATIZED.

Nicole and the Bras watch the game of half court, 2 on 2.

Stan and Jazz vs. Mike and Alex.

Mike and Alex school Stan and Jazz. Steals, picks, fancy

pointer by Mike in Stan's face seals the deal.

As Alex passes Harvey, Harvey stops him-

The Team and the Hopefuls huddle around Coach Harvey.

over her nude back, shakes out her long hair.

Mike watches...no, he GAZES longingly, lovingly...lost in her

beauty until...Scarlet turns, startles-

Scarlet walks towards him and...SLAM...shuts the door on him.

Mike wanders to the bathroom, shaking his head-

Mike paces in front of a dressing room.   A SALESMAN waits by

the door.

Ed steps from the changing room wearing very tight, ultra hip

clothes that belong on a 20 year old...he looks ridiculous.

Ed checks his butt in a full length mirror, nods happily.

Ed retreats into the changing room.

Ed, wearing only his banana hammock underwear and socks,

steps from the room, hands the clothes to the Salesman.

Other SHOPPERS eye Ed oddly as they pass.

Mike grabs Ed's bare tits and TWISTS. Ed screams, grabs

Mike's tits and TWISTS. Both of them HOWL in pain.

Mike and Ed, both still titty twisting, look up. Everyone in

the store stares. They each let go, force smiles.

Ed stomps into the dressing room rubbing his sore boobs.

Mike pulls out his iPhone, begins texting.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY

Samantha pulls Mike roughly by the hair, twists him around-

Mike tries to squeeze out. The Bras block him. The music

changes...a remix version of Hammer's `Can't Touch This'

blares.

Mike breaks into the 80's Hammer routine WE saw from the

first scene.

The Bras back up. Party-Goers stop what they're doing and

watch...not sure whether to laugh or join in.

And then, the Bras fall in.      Followed by others.   The party

just got hotter.

Maggie runs through the party and out the back. Stan chases

after her. Mike inconspicuously Hammer walks his way out of

the mix and outside.

Mike.

ANGLE...Alex and Nicole, hand in hand, stroll back towards

the house when Alex freezes-

Mike scrambles to his feet.

Scarlet winces as if dealt a blow-

packed stands.

Julie gabs with a group of TEACHERS.

On one end of the court, the Falcons run a pass and shoot

drill. On the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE shoots around.

Mike sees Scarlet and Maggie enter. He smiles apologetically

to them. Both turn away, climb the bleachers, join Nicole

and the Wonder Bras.

ANGLE...Coach Harvey claps loudly-

The Falcons swarm the bench, take their seats. Mike takes a

deep breath, sits next to Alex. Alex looks down.

Alex stands-

Alex moves down the line, takes another seat.

Ed strides through the door spots Julie, makes his way over

to her.

Julie excuses herself from the Teachers.

Julie can't help but smile, sizes Ed up.

Mike and the Falcons jog onto the court. Mike takes his

place for the jump ball. The Crowd stomps, cheers LOUDLY.

Mike looks around the gymnasium...it almost seems to SLOW

UP...the sound deafening. He finds Alex on the bench...his

hopeful face. Mike looks into the stands...Maggie and

Scarlet. Scarlet abruptly stands, climbs back down the

bleachers and exits the gym.

The Ref readies to toss the ball.    Mike takes a deep

breath...and walks off the court.

Mike steps over to Alex-
