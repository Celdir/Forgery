Taped music ENDS.  Contestants, covered with paint,

strike a final pose - sitting on ladders, standing,

kneeling.  Applause.

BACKSTAGE - WALKWAY

Contestants wait anxiously as they pass a can of

TURPENTINE and a RAG to remove paint from their arms and

legs.

Becky storms off.

Girls laugh quietly.  Iris pulls a dazed and confused

Tess - beg wet spot on her shirt - through the shot.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

Iris stands center stage, awkwardly holding the mic.

Gladys enters wearing sash, tiara and plaid culottes.

Applause.  A SLIDE is shown of her at 17.

APPLAUSE.  Tess is pushed on stage.

BACKSTAGE - LEFT

Amber paces.  ON STAGE Tess drones on at the mic.

CHLORIS KLINGHAGEN enters, small bag in hand.

Chloris pulls a simple BLACK LEOTARD from the bag.

Amber, overcome with joy, gives her a big hug.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

ON STAGE: Leslie Miller, in uniform, performs an

amazingly sexy cheer as TWO SINGLET-CLAD WRESTLERS

wrestle (One is boyfriend, Pat.).

She JUMPS, KICKS and ends with SPLITS.  APPLAUSE!

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - LATER

Michelle Johanson is on stage, sitting on a stool,

wearing all black.  She smiles warmly.  Then, with one

sweep of her hand across her face, her smile drops.

She's dead serious.

She sweeps her hand back across her face and she's "in

character," pained, near death, and overly dramatic.

BACKSTAGE - LEFT - CONTINUOUS

Amber, now in the leotard, talks to Iris.  Michelle

performs from "Soylent Green" in the b.g.

Amber storms off.

INT. BACKSTAGE

CAMERA FOLLOWS AMBER as she storms over to BACKSTAGE -

RIGHT where Gladys watches Michelle ON STAGE.

Amber starts to cry.

She doubles over.  She's given it all.  APPLAUSE.

Gladys starts out on stage as Molly Howard, dressed like

a red, white and blue cowboy, runs up next to Amber.

She's twirling toy guns on her fingers.

One of Molly's guns flies off her finger.  She goes to

retrieve it.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

Molly is line dancing, occasionally taking "pretend"

shots into the air.  It's incredibly repetitive and dull.

BACKSTAGE - CARL'S "LIGHT AND SOUND" BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

As Billy Ray Cyrus' "Achy Breaky Heart" PLAYS in b.g.,

Carl, the janitor, sets plastic army figures on fire with

a cigarette lighter.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

Gladys is center stage.  Molly Howard walks off crying,

having just finished her routine.  POLITE APPLAUSE.

She's still spinning her guns, again one goes flying.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL/STAIRWELL - DRESSING AREA

Lisa, top hat, tails, giant "I LOVE NY" button - and

others try to console a CRYING Amber.  Becky continues

singing O.S.

Getting an idea, Lisa starts to take off her jacket.

Amber hugs her and takes the jacket.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - STAGE

Gladys guides Molly off the stage.

STAGE GOES BLACK.  SPOT HITS BECKY, who sits at the edge

of the stage, holding a mic.  She's head to toe sequins

in her poodle skirt, sweater, saddle shoes, etc.

SPOT FOLLOWS as Becky stands and walks center stage to

what appears to be a COVERED MANNEQUIN.  TAPED INTRO TO

"I Can't Take My Eyes Off You."

Becky removes the sheet, revealing a MANNEQUIN dressed

like JESUS as he appeared on the cross: long hair, beard,

crown of thorns, loincloth.  The ARMS ARE STUFFED so they

move freely.  (Hands of stigmata.)

Becky TALK-SINGS - a la William Shatner's "Rocket Man" -

and DANCES around the Jesus mannequin doing the jitter-

bug, the twist and a slow dance (his arms on her

shoulders).

DURING THE SLOW DANCE, THE LOIN CLOTH SLIPS AND BECKY

MUST HOLD IT UP - GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF GRABBING HIS

CROTCH.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - BACKSTAGE

Iris approaches Lisa who's given her outfit to Amber.

Amber breaks a smile.

Taped music ENDS.  APPLAUSE.  Gladys, mic in hand, joins

Becky for a big hug.

Becky exits, pulling the wheeled Jesus behind her.

Iris runs self-consciously out on stage, whispers in

Gladys' ear, then runs back off stage.

CROWD REACTS.

Gladys exits.  A taped hip, hot DRUM BEAT starts.

Suddenly, Amber glides into CENTER SPOT.  (Now wearing

Lisa's costume, sleeves rolled up.)  Her feet burst into

an amazing routine.  The loud drum beats seem to fly from

her hands and feet as they punctuate the rhythm.  There's

no glitz, just unbelievable skill.  It appears effortless

as she floats around stage.  Like watching Michael

Jackson moon walk for the first time, you can't take your

eyes off her.  She concludes, center stage, with the

GREATEST THIRTY SECONDS OF HER LIFE.  The audience goes

WILD!  Amber takes bow after bow - they love her.  Gladys

enters quickly, mic in hand.

PAN TO JUDGES.  They look nervous as hell.  A relaxed

Hank sniffs from a paint soaked bag.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - NIGHT

Judges stare nervously at the camera - clip boards in

front of them.  Hank's LOUD BREATHING from the paint

soaked bag is obviously getting on John's nerves.

Nerves shot, John suddenly LAUNCHES himself across the

table at Hank.

Hank freezes, then starts to wail!

Hank stops crying and goes back to the bag.

Hank begins crying again.

BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM

Girls, in gowns, sit in silence.  Becky and Amber sit at

opposite ends of the room.  There's obvious tension.

Girls ad-lib SHOCK.

Girls ad-lib "Oh, I see.  Okay-then." etc.  Another LONG

BEAT of SILENCE follows.  Becky gets up to re-touch her

make-up.

Contestants stare at her in shock.  Iris enters.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM

Judges are back.  Gladys is center stage.  Girls enter

and form a line behind her.  TAPED AMERICAN MEDLEY

STARTS.

Taped fanfare.  Leslie bounds forward, grabs her trophy,

stands to one side.

Audience laughs.  Leslie waves.

Audience ad-libs amazement.

Taped DRUM ROLL.  Contestants (except Becky) take hands.

Iris gives Gladys an envelope and trophy.

Ad-lib audience shock and disbelief.  Contestants are

stunned.  Amber steps forward, humbly takes the trophy

and stands beside Leslie.  Audience finally quiets.

Iris hands Gladys a LARGE TROPHY and envelope.  Mary

Johanson is wheeled out wearing sash and tiara.

Taped drum roll.  Gladys opens the envelope.

Polite audience applause.  Becky rushes forward.  Gladys

RIPS the tiara and sash off Mary, places them on Becky.

AUDIENCE

Loretta and Annette watch on.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - STAGE

The ELDERLY MAN/MAYOR, from earlier scene, enters and

sings to a tape as Becky takes her victory walk.

Loretta wheel Annette out.  Paramedics put her in, too.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

Amber faces camera as ambulance pulls away.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

Loretta puts her arm around Amber.  They walk off as

Leslie and Pat approach.

Lisa passes by with her parents.  They look pissed.

She runs off.  Her parents stop DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASS ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON BECKY'S FACE.  Flashes illuminate it.  With each

photo she changes her smile and expression.  She loves

this.

PULL BACK to reveal two older men, with old-style news

cameras, flash pictures.

OLDER MEN turn and look at camera, then take out a pen

and note pad.

INT. MOUNT ROSE HIGH - GIRL'S BATHROOM - DAY

Fry Girl #1 and Pregnant Fry Girl smoke.

MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - NEXT DAY

Beautiful sunny day.  Lester talks to camera.

In the b.g., Gladys holds a bullhorn, clipboard and

points to a LARGE SWAN FLOAT.

EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

Entire town lines the road.  The Mayor and the Leman

family stand behind the red ribbon.  Parade PARTICIPANTS

are lined up behind them.

CHEERS!  Becky cuts the ribbon.  More CHEERS!

EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

THE PASSING PARADE:

- THREE FAT VETS, dressed as the Revolutionary War trio,

hold American, Minnesota and POW/MIA flags.

- TWO BATON TWIRLERS stand in front of the Mount Rose

High School Band.  They play - way off key.

- JUDGES wave from a convertible.  Hank, in passenger's

seat, struggles to get out.  His seatbelt prevents it.

- TWO GRUNGY OLD CLOWNS smoke impatiently.

- TWO FAT WHITE MEN, dressed as Indians, sit on scooters.

- FAT MAN drives a riding lawnmower, pulling a flatbed

with A SPEEDBOAT and a FISHING CAMP GROUP.

- FARMER pulls a goat with a sign: "Milk Me for $1.00"

- A BRIGADE of tap dancing BASSOONISTS.

EXT. MOUNT ROSE - STREET

Harold and Hank pull over and park their truck.  Harold

quickly gets out, obviously in a hurry, slamming on a

pouting Hank.

Harold rushes off for the parade, joining other folks

carrying baskets, lawn chairs and flags on the sidewalk.

EXT. MOUNT ROSE STREET - BACK TO DOCUMENTARY CAMERA

PAN OVER to see Gladys helping Becky climb on the swan,

unaware of camera.  In b.g., DOCUMENTARY CREW interviews

Amber and Leslie on their convertible behind the swan

float.

EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

Amber and Leslie, in gowns, look unhappy as they stare

straight ahead, exhaust fumes - that appear to come from

the swan's ass - cover them and their old convertible.

EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

Hank rubs his head, then angrily gets out of the truck,

SLAMMING THE DOOR ON ONE OF THE SUSPENDERS ON HIS

OVERALLS.  He starts to walk, but can't, eventually

leaning out from the truck - only moving his arms as if

walking.

EXT. MOUNT ROSE SIDE STREET - LATER

Hank, still stuck in the door, is being teased by a GROUP

OF KIDS who poke at him with flags and sticks.  ANOTHER

LITTLE KID taunts him with his cotton candy - keeping it

just out of his reach.  Hank bats at them like

Frankenstein and the torch wielding townsfolk.

EXT. MOUNT ROSE SIDE STREET - LATER

Hank, still stuck in the door, holds the little kid by

the back of the shirt in one hand and eats the kid's

cotton candy with the other.  The kid struggles to get

away.  A few BROKEN FLAGS are scattered on the ground.

ON SWAN FLOAT.  Gladys approaches.

EXT. MOUNT ROSE MAIN STREET - LATER

Suddenly, like a gasoline soaked pinata, it EXPLODES!

Gladys is thrown back.  Flames.  Screaming.  PANDEMONIUM!

Becky doesn't have a chance.  She's a pink taffeta BALL

OF FIRE.  The swan's back eventually collapses taking

Becky into it's burning belly.

INTERCUT WITH MR. HOWARD'S VIDEO.

Gladys watches in stunned silence as her daughter and

only chance at State go up in flames.  Suddenly, she

CRACKS!

Eventually, Gladys tries to climb up on the float.  Iris

pulls her off.

Gladys spins and notices the silent CROWD.

Crowd reacts.  Gladys notices Amber and runs up to her

car.

The crows reacts again.  Gladys spins, noticing someone.

Lester approaches.

Lester tries to pull her away from the crowd.

She grabs a BURNING 2X4 off a float and starts swinging

it.

CROWD GASPS.  Then stunned SILENCE.  CAMERA CIRCLES

Gladys and Lester getting reaction shots of the crowd.

TWIN OFFICERS, followed by "COPS" TV CREW, run up and

aggressively tackle Gladys.  As the struggle on the

ground continues, crew guys go over and shake hands with

the "COPS" crew - obviously knowing them.

The COPS crew begins to mingle with the DOCUMENTARY crew.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

Lovely hillside.  A PASTOR and TOWN FOLK - heads bowed -

stand beside a FRESH GRAVE.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - LATER

The funeral is over.  Amber, Loretta, Iris and Servettes

awkwardly face each other beside the grave.  Iris takes

the PARTIALLY MELTED TIARA from the headstone.

She puts the TIARA on AMBER.  Loretta FLASHES pictures.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - LATER

Annette, Amber (wearing her tiara) and Loretta are

leaving the crowning ceremony.  All are happy as they

push an extremely drugged Annette out of the cemetery.

EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - DAY

Amber sits on the picnic table.  In the b.g., Loretta

exits her trailer with a FED-EX GUY.  She pats his buns

as he exits.  She approaches Amber with a packet.

Amber rips it open and holds up a color brochure with

COLLEEN and TERRY in a glamour shot on the cover.

Loretta joins in the screaming.

EXT. LORETTA'S TRAILER - MORNING

MONTAGE BEGINS over MUSIC.

light of the FULL HARVEST MOON.

EXT. AIRPORT HOWARD JOHNSONS - DAY

WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK: "STATE FINALS"

We look up at the towering Howard Johnsons and see a huge

banner which reads: "WELCOME AMERICAN TEEN PRINCESS,

FRIED CLAM PLATTER $9.99." Suddenly, a 747, not more than

thirty feet above the hotel, flies over - the sound is

deafening.

Mr. Larson unloads Amber's luggage from the hearse.

Loretta leans against it, arm around Amber, smoking and

occasionally flipping off people who stop to stare at

this unusual sight.

INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA

There's a fake tropical look, with loads of plastic

palms, etc.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Amber into area.  BANNER:

Paul screws up.

INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - BAR AREA - MOMENTS LATER

Colleen and Terry smoke and drink at a tall tiki table

that's covered with empties.  In the b.g., a pageant

while, TWO FAT KIDS play "Marco Polo" in the pool.

She laughs hard, then spins around in her chair.

"THEME from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY" starts.  Miss

Minneapolis steps ON STAGE - silver unitard, silver

streamers, silver tap shoes.  She starts a TAP ROUTINE

that RIVALS AMBER'S.

Terry and Colleen stand in front of the stage.

SUDDENLY Miss Minneapolis FREEZES.

She runs off toward the RESTROOM.

Other waiting contestants suddenly double over, ad-

libbing "oh no! oh my God!"  "I'm gonna puke!" etc.  More

contestants grab their bellies.
