EXT. HONG KONG SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING

A smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like

watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and

a half million people a day.

EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY

THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side.

HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET

VENDOR across the street.

She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first

bite we see:

THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER

TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball

erupting over one side of the embassy.

People panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes

a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned

street vendor.

EXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in

a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English

dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"

look to two girls in a convertible.

The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who

is driving and singing to his radio.

Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it

out of the SUNROOF.

Lee picks up his CD case.

Carter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over

LEE'S CELL PHONE.

INTERCUT

INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.

Lee hangs up the cell phone.

Lee smiles at Carter.

Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their

way to the door of the Raven Club.  Carter is combing his

hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping

when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.

Carter looks at Lee.  Fixes his collar.

Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.

INT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL

GIRLS and CIVILIANS.  Lee and Carter walk in.  Lee is trying

to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where

a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael

Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."

Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to

the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.

The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the

OLD MAN continues to sing.

The thugs continue to ignore Carter.

INT. RAVEN CLUB - BACK HALL - NIGHT

Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open

door - sees a private room.  Several TRIADS are using hi-tech

MACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he

realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL

YOU GET ENOUGH."

INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS

A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open,

watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael

Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a

few of the smitten women who are watching him.

Carter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to

the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.

Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun.

Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and

fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.

Nobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to

Lee.

Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese

as Carter speaks, Lee translating.

Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.

Nobody moves.

Nobody moves.

The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee

spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage --

EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI

and several gangsters round a corner.

Lee takes off and chases them on foot.

EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS.  The

GANGSTERS look around frantically.  An apartment building is

under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom.

Their only way out is UP.

Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters

SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.  Lee wastes no time going after

them.  With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and

VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.

Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN

CLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the

LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood

against wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his

pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.

BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY

to pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the

bar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...

WHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of

CARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.

He dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS

come at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which

SEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS

them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs

after the GANGSTER LEADER.

ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS

Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up

the hill.

EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when

WHAM!  He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE.  Lee TOPPLES

OVER THE EDGE!  We see his adversary for the first time.

HU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS

As she steps to the edge... BOOM!  The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES

OPEN and CARTER EMERGES.  Gun low and ready.  Hu Li is gone.

Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below.

Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel

and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE

ROOF!

He falls along the side of the building.  He manages to grab

the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.

LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!

They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu

Li looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off.

She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

CARTER AND LEE

holding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting

to bend.

Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.

The POLE BREAKS

SUPER THE TITLE:

RUSH HOUR 2: REMEMBER THE DRAGON

INT. LEE'S UNMARKED POLICE CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in

silence, bruised and covered in garbage.

Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck.

EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING

Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12

year olds are going through their warm up routines.

MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.

Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.

Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.

The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.  Master Fu

notices Carter and Lee watching from the back.

No response.  The students exchange baffled looks.

Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move

that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in

the glow...

...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.

While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12

YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle.

Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.

Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no

reaction.

THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw

punches.

The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from

shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the

HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around

to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him

flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of

the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.

INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lee and Master Fu walking.

In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over

Carter from all sides.  Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the

kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  They

disappear O.S.

Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in

thought.

Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously

uncomfortable.

AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by

in the other direction, disappear O.S.

Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant.

Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the

pathway.

Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway.

Master Fu walks over and takes the cash.

EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two

students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor

locked between his legs, holding another two down with his

hands, and sitting on the last one.

EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

A neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor.

INT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

Lee and Carter walk into an upscale MASSAGE PARLOR and stand

in a lobby.  SOFT MUSIC is playing.

Lee bows, followed by Carter.

The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN

SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL

WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven.

Carter looks like a kid in a candy store.

Lee elbows Carter.

INT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

TWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women

massaging their feet and hands.  There are BIG SCREEN TV's

showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the

background.

Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING

PURPLE ROBES.  Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH

TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same

time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink.

LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR

SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of

sophistication and brutality.

Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.

Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair

with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a

decision, gets up and walks towards him.

Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.

Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP

from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT

against the wall.  Ricky glances at his men who are seated

around the room waiting to move.

Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side,

breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.

A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and

towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing

Lee and Carter.  A beat...

Tan bows to Lee and Carter.

As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him.

But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.

Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man

covers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other

henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the

towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --

blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all

the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,

his robe, or some other found object.

Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men

flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of

the men's punches.

In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he

flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind.

Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men

throwing him out the front door.

Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over

their shoulders.

EXT. HONG KONG HIGHWAY - DAY

Ricky Tan's black limo SCREECHES to a stop.  The door flies

open and Lee and Carter are TOSSED out onto the highway.

Both men are completely naked.

EXT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - DAY

A packed street - Lee and Carter dodging in and out of

people.  The CAMERA PANS and we see Lee and Carter from

behind.

INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

PANDEMONIUM

The station is packed with Americans -- FBI AGENTS, SECRET

SERVICE... they've set up shop right in the middle of the

bullpen.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a

50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.

SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen.

Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash

can lid, Carter using a red construction cone.

INT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting

on a suit and fixing his tie.

Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from

Lee's closet, then moves for the door.

The two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly

walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half

dressed.

INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin

stands in the back.

INT. LEE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Carter is on the phone, his feet on Lee's desk.  As he talks

he opens a drawer, pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it.

INT. CAPTAIN DIEL'S OFFICE - LAPD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

CAPTAIN DIEL sits behind his desk talking on the phone.

As Carter walks out the DOOR, he brushes past HU LI, who is

standing in the hallway disguised as a FED EX DELIVERY

PERSON.  Carter checks her out as he exits.

EXT. STREET - DAY

CARTER starts walking down the street, making his way past an

outdoor BUTCHER MARKET, getting strange looks from locals and

tourists alike.  He motions to an OLD WOMAN who is selling

LIVE DUCKS, PIGEONS AND CHICKENS

The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES

filled with birds.

The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.

INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN/LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

Lee walks out of the Captain's office, heads for his own

office - but never gets there.

AN EXPLOSION rips through the second floor of the station.

Lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his

head.  Sheer pandemonium as Lee quickly looks up at his

destroyed office, tries to get to his feet.

STUNNED POLICE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES are crowded around

Lee's office, looking at the rubble.  Lee pushes through the

crowd -- it's all smoke and fire.  Now way anyone held back

by the heat.

EXT. HONG KONG STREET - DAY

Carter walks down the street holding a CAGE WITH A LIVE RED

BIRD inside.  He stops a MAN who is sweeping in front of his

store.

The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:

ENGLISH/CHINESE DICTIONARY

As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off.

Pause.

Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see

if it's worth staying...

INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - DAY

Lee sits by himself in shock.  Superindendent Chin

approaches.

Beat.

EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - AFTERNOON

Carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving

for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.  Carter ducks

to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a

waiting Daimler.

The Daimler drives off.  Carter rushes to the middle of the

street with a determined look on his face.

Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.

INT. TAXI - EVENING

The CAB DRIVER turns to Carter, who motions to the limo.

The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter.

The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes

in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash.

INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY

Lee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo.

Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in

tribute to Carter.

His CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music.

INTERCUT --

INT. CHIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Lee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC

up, a man on a mission.

EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT

A 190-FOOT YACHT is anchored in Victoria Harbor.  Ricky Tan

walks along the top deck with HU LI, disappearing into a

crowd of people who are partying on the ship.

Carter steps out of the cab.

Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off,

leaving him alone on the docks.

Carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station

parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their

names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.

INT. YACHT - NIGHT

A huge PARTY, a live band plays for a crowd of business men,

politicians and beautiful women - a who's who of Hong Kong.

CARTER walks up to the front of the boat -- TWO DOORMEN

HOLDING clipboards immediately stop him.

As Carter walks past the doorman --

Carter turns back to the doorman, grabs him by the collar.

Carter cuts a smoking DANCE MOVE.

Carter walks onto the ship, starts singing to himself.

EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS

The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea.

Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of

the slip.  He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice

but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the

side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.  He

clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging

LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --

EXT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS

As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food

from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner

- almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN

REIGN.  Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,

impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --

money.

He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,

Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire

as sociopath.

Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li.  Carter

hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room

for signs of trouble.  He heads into the main party.

Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a

stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of

champagne.  Carter lights her cigarette for her.

Carter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away.

Carter's watching.

INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lee makes his way toward a STAIRCASE that is blocked by a

BODYGUARD.  He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the

throat, pushing him against the wall.

Lee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing

right behind him.

Lee and Carter turn to see FOUR BODYGUARDS standing in front

of them with GUNS in hand.

It looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED

and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen

satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door

and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom.

ON TV

We see Shaq miss his free throw.

Tan turns off the TV, turns to Lee.

Hu Li hesitates, upset at being dismissed.

Carter pulls Lee aside.

No answer.  Carter holds Lee's glance for a beat, then turns

and walks the other way.

EXT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - UPPER DECK - NIGHT

Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.

Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.

Hu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.

Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.  Hu Li

screams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.  Tan

falls back, over the rail, and into the water.

Lee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee,

attacking from all sides.  Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight

off the bodyguards.

INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

Reactions from the crowd as GUNSHOTS echo from the deck

above.

INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Hu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and

suddenly goes FLYING, landing flat on her face.

It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED

Hu Li with his leg.

Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head.

EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on

one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and

Bodyguard #2.

INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Carter and Hu Li face off.

Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows.

INT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches

his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines.

Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT

starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the

moving boat.

Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the

stern.

EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS

Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time --

watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat.

Carter turns his head, sees --

-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li

escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should

during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears

back into the shadows.

EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

The yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs.

Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks.

Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock.

Sterling walks away disgusted.

Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin

motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to

approach.

The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat.

Carter stalks off.

Carter gets in Lee's face.  The two men look like they're

about to come to blows.

A long beat while Lee considers what to say.

Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.

Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.

Lee's caught, fibs badly.

Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his

car.  Carter watches him.  Finally he rolls his eyes and

yells.

Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the

cop beneath the attitude.

Carter turns, walks away without looking back.

Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other

passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of

doubt.

BINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL

CUT TO REVEAL --

Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars.

Lee standing next to him.  WE ARE:

INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down

hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack.

BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL

Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the

penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven

Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the

door.

Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.

Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to

sleep on the bed.

Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.

LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.

BINOCULARS P.O.V. - ON ISABELLA

She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER

CURTAINS.  Slowly taking off her coat.

Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to

unbutton her blouse.

Isabella starts to remove her blouse.  Lee starting to sweat

as he watches her undress.

Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.

Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.

Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as

Carter watches to the window.

Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.

Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the

living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in

bra and panties.

Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees

Isabella hang up the phone.

CLOSE ON ISABELLA

As she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She

puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom

and puts on a robe.

BINOCULARS P.O.V.

We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her

hotel room talking with someone.

BINOCULARS P.O.V.

Inside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package.

Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.

INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

down the hallway.

INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Isabella takes her robe off, glances at the package, picks it

up and starts to open it as Lee and Carter come BURSTING

THROUGH the BEDROOM DOOR.

Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and

panties.

Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the

BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.

INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the BOMB

toward the END OF THE HALL as he and Carter dive to the

floor.

Nothing happens.

Lee looks up, SEES a HOTEL EMPLOYEE pushing a room service

CART, about to walk right past the package --

Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.

Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall,

heading for the elevator.

Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE

STANDING INSIDE.

Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do

with it --

Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs --

INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell -- when he

sees TWO MAIDS WALKING toward him.

Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no

choice but to throw it back to Carter.

EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT

Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to

hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible.

He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets

are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.

Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee

and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides

to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT

OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed

off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.

Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella

begins to open the package.

Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED

DOLLAR BILLS.

Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to

her bra.

INT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER

Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's

package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the

food from the mini fridge.

Lee and Carter exchange looks.

Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns

RED.

Isabella thinks for a beat.

Carter nods.

Lee nods.

Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out.  They exit

quickly, trying to hide their excitement.  CAMERA STAYS on

Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a

number.

EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through

the street trying their best to look like Secret Service

Agents.  They approach Carter's parked VETTE.

Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette.  Lee

reluctantly gets in, too.

Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall.

INT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Carter and Lee pass through the restaurant, only two tables

are occupied.

INT. KITCHEN

Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the OWNER, a

BLACK MAN named KENNY, is yelling in Chinese to an over

worked waiter.  Kenny's wife, a spectacular looking Chinese

woman, works the stove.  A couple of cute half-black, half

Asian kids run around the kitchen.

Kenny looks up at Carter.  A cool, appraising glance.

Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to --

INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

MEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for

big money.  Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside.  It's very

smokey and very crowded.

Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Kenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door.

Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial

arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him --

countering Kenny's move.

Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence --

Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.

They switch to Chinese.

Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny.

Lee and Kenny laugh.

Kenny considers this for a moment.

Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE.

He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter

checks it out.

Carter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it.

Kenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED.

Carter and Lee move for the door.

Carter and Lee exchange a look as we CUT TO:

EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - REIGN PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the

stairway -- coming almost face to face with --

HU LI

Who has her gun out.  Waiting for them.  ISABELLA is standing

near by, and ZING is visible off to the side.  An 18-WHEELER

in the loading bay is just being shut and locked.  A LIMO is

parked beside it.

Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions.  When most of

the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out,

putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.  They can't blink

without getting mowed down.

Hu Li savors the moment.

Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him,

freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several

feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.

Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee

falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt

of her gun.

BANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across

the jaw with her fist.

Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.

The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.

The WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands.

As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a

look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li

COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun.

EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - DAY

The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car

pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway.

EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DAY

The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it.

INT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - TRUCK BED - DAY

LEE and CARTER are in the back with crates filled with MONEY.

They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows.

Carter is flexing his battered body.

Lee looks disappointed.

Lee thinks about this for a BEAT.

A BEAT OF SILENCE

ANOTHER BEAT OF SILENCE

Lee turns away from Carter.

Lee clears his voice.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

The 18-WHEELER drives by followed by the LIMO.

INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

Hu Li and Isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that

is driving behind the truck.  Hu Li is on the car phone.

She HANGS UP and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best

to appear completely uninterested.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER.

INT. 18-WHEELER - TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS

Carter works at opening one of the crates.  Lee steps up,

takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet

spot, and PUNCHES a hole in one of the thick boards.  They

start prying the crate open.

Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about

$1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee.

Carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him.

The truck lurches.

EXT. 18-WHEELER - CONTINUOUS

The truck is parked in the underground loading docks.  It's

approached by FOUR TRIAD SOLDIERS.  Soldier #1 opens the

TRUCK'S DOUBLE DOORS to find.

Lee and Carter are gone.  Except for boxes of money, the

truck bed is EMPTY.

Two soldiers enter the truck bed.

ANGLE UP TO REVEAL

Lee and Carter WEDGED up against the CEILING of the truck

bed.  Above the doors and over the soldiers.

Lee and Carter SWING DOWN in unison -- knocking both soldiers

to the ground.  In the next instant:

ON LEE

still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips

onto the roof of the truck.

ON CARTER

who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to

use a shield as gunfire erupts.

Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the

ground.  He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield

and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN

the first two guards.

Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them

CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like

the closest way out:

A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.

INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Lee and Carter run through - it extends out from the

underground loading docks.

Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a

MANHOLE COVER.  They start climbing up the metal stairs that

lead up to the street.

EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. - DUSK

The blvd.'s packed with PEOPLE and CARS.

CLOSE ON

Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing

together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS

VEGAS STRIP.  They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest

light show in the world.

They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH:

A TEN-STORY DRAGON.  Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60

SECONDS.

FIRE BALLS BLOW out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up

at the RED DRAGON.  The HUGE NEON SIGN READS: GRAND OPENING -

EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

Lee and Carter come out of the sewer.

Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the

hotel -- it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE.  The richest of the

rich are making their way inside.

Carter and Lee start to walk away.

EXT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - NIGHT

Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store.

INT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS

As they enter, a SALESMAN approaches them.

Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of

superbills.

Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder.

He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee.

EXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT

Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly

tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit.

Le is awkward in "player" guise.

Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as

they walk through the doors.

INT. RED DRAGON - CONTINUOUS

Carter STRUTS through the lobby, Lee doing his best to

imitate Carter's pimp and roll.  THEY WALK PAST THE GIANT

BUDDHA --

They are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA

COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle.

RICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The

MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around

the perimeter - a sign reads:

The LIGHTS DIM - a spotlight comes on and finds STEVEN REIGN

on the balcony overlooking the ENTRANCE.

Reign smiles, flips a switch -- the CASINO COMES TO LIFE.

Fireworks, bright lights, endless rows of tables, dealers

waiting.

A BAND PLAYS on a stage in the casino lounge.

Chinese ACROBATS perform suspended from the ceiling and on

the balconies above.

Applause all around as the FLAME shoots out of the dragon's

nostrils and the acrobats perform.  Carter and Lee walk down

the red carpet.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

CLOSE ON

Dice ROLLING on a craps table.

We see BLACKJACK DEALERS BUSTING - paying out CUSTOMERS.

Hundred dollar slot machines paying out jackpots.

GAMBLERS winning all over the casino.  Then going to the main

cage and exchanging their chips for SUPERBILLS.

As people pour into the casino, Steven Reign is making his

way through the crowd, shaking hands and posing for pictures.

As Carter walks off, a WOMAN grabs Lee and pulls him onto the

dance floor.

INT. LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

The woman spins to face Lee, her face half-hidden under the

dance floor lights.

Isabella grabs him around the waist, pulls him close.

An ASIAN BAND sings STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT as Lee tries his

best to slow dance.  An intimate moment between Isabella and

Lee, her face nestled in the crook of his neck, hiding her

face.

Lee starts to get into the music, moving his hips in a slow,

sensual rhythm.

Lee looks over her shoulder.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

As Steven Reign makes his way through the casino, Carter

steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug.

Reign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave.

INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

Lee is dancing close with Isabella.

Lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT.

Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching.

He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd.

Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor.

Lee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD

standing in front of a small door.

Carter looks around the casino.

Carter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare.

Carter throws a HUNDRED THOUSAND in $100 BILLS onto the

table.

The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.

The PIT BOSS gets on his walkie-talkie.

EXT. SOFT COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

The SECURITY GUARD lowers his walkie-talkie, starts moving

towards Carter's table.

INT. CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

TWO SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.

Carter watches as Lee moves past the guard and makes his way

into the soft count room.

A BIG CROWD has gathered as the Security Guards try and push

their way through.  The pit boss picks up the phone, calls

upstairs.

Carter starts clapping, and the confused crowd joins in as

the Security Guards move in.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the

walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room.

He hears noise, TWO SECURITY GUARDS coming behind him through

the casino door.  He has no choice but to crawl over the back

of a money cart and hug the top.  He lies as still as he can,

trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring

directly into the EYE IN THE SKY cameras that are in the

ceiling.

WE SEE LEE'S FACE

as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the

words "oh shit" as he rolls by.

Lee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain

of COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out.

On the opposite side, the REAL MONEY is being WHEELED OUT

toward a waiting TRUCK that is parked at the back door.

Lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is

blown.  He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of

the locked vault.  There's no way to get the plates.

Isabella has set him up again.

He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.

The GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them

down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO

MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward

the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a

right cross.

Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she

stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife

to Lee's throat.

She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut.

She holds the detonator in her hand.

INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

A crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table

rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him.

Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional

AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.

Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS

YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.

The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.

Carter throws the dice.

The table erupts as Carter grabs the dice.

The elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the

sky room by Hu Li and the three Triads.  As they walk into

the room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room.

INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

FORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel.  A MAN

stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the

casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.

Lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind

his back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.

Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee.

Isabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the

sight of Ricky Tan alive.

Ricky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.

Lee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of

the monitors.

Ricky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign

walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE

SUITE.

Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.

ON ANOTHER SCREEN

We see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life.

Ricky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to

Isabella as he goes.

SUBTITLES: "Won't see you again."

INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

Carter has two racks of chips in front of him, a huge crowd

surrounding him.

Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach

Carter's table.

As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter

glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.

INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - NIGHT

Ricky Tan turns to Hu Li.

Ricky Tan walks out.  Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee,

plays with the button.

Hu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee.  She holds the

blade to his face.  About to cut him.  When Isabella pulls

her gun.

Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind

his back.  Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her

knife in the other.  She takes a step toward Isabella.

Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator

from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and

sticking the gun under her chin.

Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the

hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator --

the TWO WOMEN fight around it.

Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and

rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when:

THE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR

They're about to move in.

The Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet,

KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her.

One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee

gets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his

back.

Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM.

Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.

INT. CASINO - CASHIER

Two security guards lead Carter away from the table when:

CRASH!

An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW.

In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.

The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:

The guards restrain him.

He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying

as the GUARDS hit the floor.

INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hu Li picks up the detonator.  WHACK!  A heeled foot kicks it

from her grasp.  Isabella has recovered!  The detonator FLIES

OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW.

INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND

DISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before

Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the

detonator on her rounds.

Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a

BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it,

but he does see:

ACROSS THE CASINO

Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at

bay with a croupier stick.

Carter and Lee see each other.  They have the same

simultaneous though:

Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth.

But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way

is the HIGH WAY.

Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards.

Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop.

He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --

landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other

side.

Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in

the Sky Room.  He grins.

POW!  He socks a GUARD in the face.

INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Isabella and Hu Li are locked in battle.  Rolling to the

floor, they both see the gun.  They scramble over each other

to get to it first.

INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

A security guard CLIMBS on the table to level Carter when Lee

arrives.  He kicks the guard off and turns to Carter, his

plea MUFFLED.

No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive.  Kicks

and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!  He bobs

and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in

between swings.  Suddenly:

BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.

Everyone HITS THE DECK.  Carter and Lee dive on to the floor

as panic ripples through the Casino.  People FLEE for the

EXITS.

THE WAITRESS DESERTS HER TRAY.  It gets knocked over and TIPS

on the floor.  The DETONATOR LANDS feet away from Carter.

Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it!  A

high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.  He LUNGES for

it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --

WHAM!  He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY.  The second it hits

the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.

ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room.  Hu Li

STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.

The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li.  As she bends to PICK

up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time.

Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.

Hu Li lifts the detonator.

Carter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.

Lee SPITS the grenade into the air.

Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.

KABOOM!

The table is BLOWN OFF IT'S FOUNDATION.  Chips and cash

volcano.  Hu Li is blown backwards by the force of the blast.

SHEER PANDEMONIUM grips the casino.

AS THE SMOKE CLEARS

Carter and Lee peer out from behind a row of slot machines.

The place is deserted.

A hand on Carter's arm.  THIS IS SERIOUS.

Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end

of the casino.

Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee.

But halfway up the carpet.  Carter stops.  Lee turns to see

what is holding him up.

Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.

Lee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE

TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes

short work of them, and races toward the elevators.

DEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF!

Each readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her

long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches,

flexes, ready to sting like a bee.

She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her

undershirt.

She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND

like a master.

Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta

soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for

another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him.

INT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

Lee's in the elevator as the doors close.  SUDDENLY, a HAND

cuts through, parting the doors.

It's ISABELLA!  A wound on her shoulder.

She steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and

holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down.

DING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY

- the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and

steps into the elevator.

The elevator doors close.

INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Steven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of

HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a

black bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he

comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan.

Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and

starts to walk toward the door.

Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.

Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls

dead to the floor.  Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.

Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

WHOOSH!  Another Terra Cotta fighting stick is in half in

Carter's hands.

No more toying.  Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE

WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD.  She SLICES it in HALF!  He's

got nowhere to hide.

She JABS him with the sword.  Carter SCREAMS.  Falls back

against the table, clutching his chest.  Hu Li WINDMILLS,

kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --

THWACK!

The DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and

she is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade.  Staring

at Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.

Carter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS

HER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.

WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He

reaches through the slice in his jacket.  Instead of a hand

covered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!

Carter runs for the elevator.

Lee is walking toward Ricky Tan, the two men circling Reign's

body.

Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.

Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,

taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as

Carter bursts in the room.

Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him

like this before.

Lee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.

Lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the

trigger but can't.

Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.

Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the

plates hit him across the face and knock him down.

THE GUN IS LOOSE

Tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:

Lee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM

SQUARE IN THE CHEST.

Tan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Lee tries to

grab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.

But Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the

street below.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

A TAXI is parked out front.  Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof.

SMASHING THROUGH A SIGN ON TOP THAT READS: "EVERYBODY'S A

WINNER!"

INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

Lee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved

it's finally over.  Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

As they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them,

bleeding and half-dead.  She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND.

This one twice the size of the one from earlier.

Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn

and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.

EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the

PENTHOUSE BLOWS!

The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side

of the hotel.

THEY SCREAM AS THE CABLE BREAKS.

Lee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER.

They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE

SIGN.

It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.

Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.  A HUGE

TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives.

The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.

They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips

and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE

STRETCH LIMO.

INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

Lee and Carter land in the back.  Slam into their seats and

try to catch their breath.  The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH

when they realize they're alive!

Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR

OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at

them.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a

night on the town.

Lee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of

the hotel.

In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE

CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.

INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT

Lee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with

Sterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  Lee and

Isabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane,

Lee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.

Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.

Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND

like a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away.

Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter.

Carter takes the badge.  Smiles.

Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.

Carter pulls out another wad of cash.

Lee looks back toward Isabella.

They look at each other, smile.

As Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC

SWELLS.  "WAR" starts to PLAY.  They dance their way through

a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make

their way through the airport.
