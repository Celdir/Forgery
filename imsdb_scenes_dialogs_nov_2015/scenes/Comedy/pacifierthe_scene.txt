EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

A fishing boat pushes over choppy water. FOUR GUN TOTING

MEN on Jet Skis wearing black wet suits and goggles

escort the boat. Flying above it is a HELICOPTER.

INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS

A SERBIAN MAN captains the wheel. SERB 2 scans the

horizon with binoculars. He checks the GPS system, then

his watch, then speaks into his throat mic. All italics

are Serbian w/ subtitles:

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

The JET SKIER in the lead weighs in on a radio.

INT. SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS

The HELICOPTER PILOT weighs in.

EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS

the surface.

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

from the boat and skis bubbles.

Calm. Then from out of nowhere five NAVY SEALs wearing RE-

BREATHERS appear, in neat formation like the Blue Angels.

JET PROPELLED BACKPACKS push the SEALs through the water.

The LEAD SEAL: SHANE WOLFE, points upwards. All eyes

follow his finger to the underbelly of the boat above.

From his belt, Shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive

disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and FIRES.

A cable shoots up -- THUD... The disc sticks to the

boat's hull. Shane pushes a button on the wand retracting

the cable and drawing himself closer.

Dangling from the cruiser, Shane fixes a BOMB to the

hull. He releases himself from the boat and speeds away --

BOOM. A dense explosion sends ripples through the water

and ELECTRICITY crackling around the boat.

INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS

A SURGE of ELECTRICAL FORCE blasts from the control

panel. SPARKS fly.

The two Serbian Men jolt backwards -- WHAM -- and hit the

wall. All the needles inside all the dials go LIMP. The

roar of the engines DIES and the boat STOPS.

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN, UNDER THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS

Shane slips inside the hull, through the new hole.

INT. SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS

The chopper slows to a hover.   The Pilot looks below.

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

The jet skiers protectively circle the injured boat in a

SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING move, and the Jet Ski drivers are

simultaneously YANKED below the surface: a split second

later they're replaced by our SEALS (ALSO IN BLACK WET

SUITS AND GOGGLES) -- the switch happens in less than a

second, way too fast for anyone to notice.

INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS

The shaken Serbs climb to their feet.

They look around, and see the SEALS, on the jet skis: In

the masks they are indistinguishable from the GUN-TOTTING

MEN they switched paces with. All seems clear. Serb 1

pushes on the throttle... nothing.

Suddenly the boat lists -- and water pours in, under the

cabin door. They spring into action!

EXT. DECK - CONTINUOUS

Serb 1 rushes out, shouting orders: He alerts four ARMED

GUARDS and the Jet Ski drivers (now our Seals).

The Armed Guards fire relentlessly into the water. Serb 2

rushes below deck.

INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS

PROFESSOR CHARLES PLUMMER, bound to a chair and gagged,

tries to YELP as the room begins to flood with water.

INT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS

Serb 2 runs down steps to the lowermost hold. He tries to

force the door open. When it finally opens, he is forced

back by a three foot wall of water.

INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS

Professor Plummer panics, as the water rises up to his

mouth He struggles, but can't get free. Up to his nose,

over his head.... He's gone.

Then Shane Wolf rises out of the water, hauling the

Professor up. He cuts the Professor's GAG. Plummer

screams. Shane removes his mouth piece. Shane doesn't

seem the slightest bit fazed by the circumstances.

The Professor gestures across the room, where a metal

BRIEFCASE is floating. Shane calmly HANDCUFFS it to his

own waist. As the water rises, to the roof.

Shane sticks the mouth piece into Plummer's mouth, giving

him his oxygen.

EXT. ON THE DECK - SIMULTANEOUS

The Armed Guards stop shooting into the water. One of

our SEALS calls out to them, in PERFECT SERBIAN:

The Guards fire again. The SEAL speaks into his neck mic.

The Seal calls out: "shoot more, more!" They do, until

there's nothing but empty CLICKS from their guns.

INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS

Just before the water envelopes him and Plummer...

Shane takes a deep breath, and pulls himself, the

Professor and the briefcase UNDER the water.

EXT. OCEAN'S SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER

Shane and the Professor rise to the surface as the boat

falters behind them. Shane pulls out a retractable

CROSSBOW. It clicks open and he shoots a CABLE into the

belly of the helicopter above him.

INT. HELICOPTER - A SECOND LATER

Shane appears at the Pilot's door, holding the Professor.

Shane addresses the Pilot in perfect SERBIAN.

The Pilot nods, terrified. Shane TOSSES the Pilot out.

Shane swings into the hot seat and grabs the controls,

pulling the Professor in behind him.

ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER - CONTINUOUS

The SEALS on the Jet Skis SALUTE Shane in the chopper,

then disappear gracefully back into the water.

INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Shane smiles, clearly he loves this kind of day. He looks

beside him, the Professor looks terrified. The Professor

takes out his mouth piece.

Shane sticks the mouth piece back in the Professors'

mouth, shutting him up.

EXT. MOUNTAIN CLEARING - A LITTLE LATER

A Pave Hawk SH-60 helicopter, rotors whirling slowly,

waits. Shane's chopper appears from behind a tree line

and sets down atop the mountain by a stream.

Shane and Charles sprint from the chopper towards the

waiting Hawk. Charles stops Shane.

Charles picks up his briefcase. He holds the lock up to

his mouth and whispers into it:

The briefcase pops open. Shane looks at him, puzzled.

Charles takes a cell-phone out of the case. Shane looks

in the case: it's EMPTY, except for the phone and a

family PHOTO. Charles dials his cell phone... nothing

Shane considers, then hands him his satellite phone.

Charles dials, and talks...

INT. PAVE HAWK - CONTINUOUS

Shane climbs in the Hawk and approaches the cockpit.    The

PILOT sits, back to him.

The Pilot slumps forward... DEAD. Shane turns-

WHAM.   Shane drops, knocked unconscious.   All goes black.

EXT. PAVE HAWK - MOMENTS LATER

The helicopter is on fire. Wolf lies facedown in the

stream. He looks around, barely conscious.

SHANE'S P.O.V.: Everything is a blur, in slow-motion. He

sees Charles, unconscious. A Huey Helicopter lands. A

VERY TALL MAN steps out, and takes Charles' Briefcase.

There is huge explosion, as the chopper ignites.

Everything is ablaze. Shane reaches out, grabs the

picture of Charles' kids then goes unconscious.

EST. HOSPITAL - DAY

TITLE CARD: 1 Month Later

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Shane lies in a hospital bed, despondent. His arm and

face bandaged.

Shane's Captain enters: BILL FAWCETT (35) -- friendly,

unassuming. He looks like he hasn't slept in days. Shane

salutes him with his bandaged arm -- it hurts to salute,

but he does it anyway.

Bill sits down beside the bed. He takes a long look at

Shane. He holds a REPORT in his hand.

Bill shakes his head, disappointed. He pulls up a chair,

and sits opposite Shane.

Bill considers this. Then...

Shane sits up. He can't believe his good fortune.

Invigorated, he pulls off bandages, disconnects an IV,

and starts to rise.

Shane listens, intrigued.

Shane is surprised... Bill pulls a tiny tape recorder

from his pocket, presses play, we hear PROFESSOR

PLUMMER'S voice.

Shane is shocked, hearing the dead man's voice.

INT. SHANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Shane packs his duffel bag. He opens a drawer: There's

five t-shirts, identical to the one he wears. He opens

another drawer: Five khaki pants, also identical to the

one he wears. He opens the closet: There's a massive fur-

collared coat. Hm. He rejects it.

Shane packs his duffel with military gear: GPS compass,

night vision goggles, camouflage vest, machete... they

all go in. Shane heads to the door, then goes back to his

chest of drawers. He reaches in, and pulls out a small,

old MEDAL: the ribbon is faded and frayed. He looks at it

for a moment, then unzips his suit and pins it to the

inside, like it's a lucky rabbit's foot.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON

A taxi door opens. Shane looks like a bad ass, ready for

anything. He steps from the taxi onto an adorable TROLL

doll on the sidewalk. It SQUEAKS.

Shane's P.O.V.: Julie's unkempt suburban house, with toys

all over the lawn, and a "BLESS THIS MESS" welcome mat.

Shane double-checks the address. The sprinklers go off.

Shane darts to the door and rings the bell (it's one of

those long cheerful doorbells).

WE hear TINY FEET approach -- then the door swings open,

Shane looks down -- and sees LULU, 8, peering up at him.

Shane eyes Lulu. Lulu eyes Shane, then:

SLAM. Lulu shuts the door in Shane's face. Shane frowns.

WE hear heavier footsteps approaching.

The door opens revealing JULIE PLUMMER. Julie holds

NAKED baby PETER, 2. She sees Shane, and stops, a little

startled by his size...

She hugs him. He's not quite sure what to do -- he's a

rock, he doesn't flinch.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE/FOYER - DAY

It's warm and quiet.   Petite Julie SCREAMS up the stairs-

Shane startles, covers his ears.

And then three pairs of feet come down the stairs. Lulu,

ZOE, 15, and TODD, 14 line up like the perfect family

portrait. Todd's hair hangs in his face. He wears a Sid

Vicious shirt and a long trench coat.

All the kids except for Todd-

Shane nods, stern. On the stairs, a Romanian MAID walks

by, carrying a BABY.

Shane nods hello to them.

Zoe, Lulu and Todd climb back up the stairs. Julie leads

Shane into...

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Julie sits, Shane stands "at ease" (which doesn't look

"at ease" at all).

Suddenly from behind Shane's head a DUCK appears and

NIBBLES his ear. Shane spins in full fight stance. He

sees the Duck... and relaxes. Sort of.

The duck QUACKS angrily. Confused, Shane returns to "at

ease," keeping one eye on the duck.

Beat.

But Shane is already gone.

MONTAGE. MILITARY MUSIC PLAYS:

Shane secures the area.       He paces off the yard.

He mounts surveillance cameras in the eaves.

He attaches contact alarms in the doors and windows.

Shane climbs a telephone pole, opens the circuit box and

TAPS the phones.

Shane, now wearing an EAR TRANSMITTER, crawls through the

shrubs, hiding electric eyes.

out... through the kitchen window... and reveal Shane

with night vision goggles on scoping the property.

The phone RINGS inside. Through the window, Julie

casually answers it. Shane touches his ear transmitter

and LISTENS as he walks into the house.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Shane, listening to the conversation, enters-

Julie and Shane share a look.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE/FOYER - MORNING

Julie, with her suitcase, Shane, Helga and the Kids stand

in the doorway. Zoe listens to her I-Pod ignoring the hug

Julie gives her.

A

chewing gum bubble.

Julie gets in the car and it drives away. Shane turns

back to the kids who loom in the doorway.

H

S

Helga trudges up the path and in.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Shane, on a short ladder, screws in a surveillance camera

into the corner of a wall when he hears:

Lulu SCREAMS. The sound of MACHINE GUN FIRING.

Immediately, Shane leaps off the ladder and bounds down

the stairs two at a time and into the...

INT. HOUSE/FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

in front of a VIDEO GAME. Shane shakes his head.

And Shane spies half of Todd's face peeking around a

corner staring at him...

Todd disappears. WAAAAA!! WAAAAA!! Shane spins, looks

around for the CRYING BABY... can't find him.

Without looking Lulu points. A diapered Peter stands in

the half full AQUARIUM, pouring in Cheerios. Helga

enters holding the wailing Tyler. Gary suddenly FLIES by -

- WHRRP! Shane ducks. Shane scowls at Helga:

corner of his eye -- he sees A FIGURE SCURRY ACROSS THE

BACK LAWN. Shane turns off the light. He shuts off the

window alarm and sneaks out silently.

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

The yard is littered with toys. In the middle is a

TRAMPOLINE. He spots the Figure climbing the TRELLIS.

Shane runs, jumps onto the trampoline. He flies in the

air and latches onto the figure. They both tumble to the

ground.

Shane yanks off the DARK FIGURE's hood, revealing SCOTT

(16) a nervous teenager. He's dazed, but alright, wearing

SHARPER IMAGE night vision goggles.

Zoe runs out the door, setting off the PIERCING ALARM.

Shane grabs Scott by the scruff of the neck.

Freaked, Scott fumbles for his wallet and gives Shane a

twenty dollar BILL.

Befuddled, Scott starts to   do lame push-ups. Shane grabs

the back of Scott's shirt,   LIFTING him in the air,

spinning him away from the   house like a marionette. Scott

runs off, calling out from   across the street.

Zoe storms inside. Shane stands there, fuming. The

Alarm's still blaring. The window of the house next door

opens: a Korean couple, THE CHUNS, pop their heads out.

They're arguing with each other in Korean. Shane

addresses them, IN PERFECT KOREAN with subtitles:

S

Shane pulls a remote control from his pocket and clicks

it. The alarm stops.

Mr. Chun tosses him the TROLL DOLL and slam their window

shut. Shane's about to head inside, he pulls a tiny

camera phone from his pocket, and snaps a shot of the

Chun's car in their driveway.

I

blares from Todd's room.

Zoe starts to turn -- then suddenly spins and tries

kicking him in the CROTCH. But Shane catches her foot --

and whirls her away. She has to hop on one foot, to not

fall over. He "hops" her down the hall to her room.

S

Zoe's back to her door, Shane flips her foot in the air.

Zoe falls backwards into the room. Shane shuts her door.

Shane marches back down the hall, bangs on Todd's door-

Shane frowns, continues down the hall. He passes the

NURSERY (Peter and Tyler's room), where Helga is singing

a lullaby: (as annoying Has something Barney might sing).

She does a little "dance" that goes with the lullaby: She

hops forwards three times, then "crab-walks" sideways.

She does. The Children, in bed -- laugh and laugh.

Shane shakes his head, keeps walking-

Z

T

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - DAWN

The sun rises over the neighborhood, warm orange light.

INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

Everyone is asleep. In the bedrooms, a SERIES OF SHOTS:

L

Tyler snores in his crib.       Peter in his bed.

"REVEILLE"! Zoe jumps, like she's been electrocuted.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - MORNING

Todd sits up, disoriented, not understanding what's

happening. The Whistle GETS LOUDER. Suddenly his door

flies open -- and Shane strides in with a BOOM BOX. Todd

blinks groggily.

Todd pulls the blanket over his head. Shane flips the

mattress over spilling Todd to the floor.

Todd scrambles to his feet and out the door.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

All the little kids are CRYING. Covering their ears.

Helga runs through in hair curlers, half-asleep and

angry, carrying the crying baby.

S

Helga narrows her eyes, shocked.

Shane's jaw drops.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

The children are assembled, lined up tallest to shortest.

At the end on the floor is Baby Tyler, sucking on a

bottle. Shane firmly starts his Patton speech:

Shane starts to speak then thinks better, he's furious.

Everyone stares blankly -- a tense silence. It's broken

by the sound of a large AIR BUBBLE from the aquarium.

Everyone cracks up. Shane tries to maintain decorum. He

reaches into his bag and unpacks a set of small high-tech

SECURITY BRACELETS with a red light and a covered button.

He straps one to each Kid's wrist.

He yells at her, Marine sergeant style:

Shane looks to Zoe for translation.

Angry, Shane bounds up the stairs.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME

S

but it's locked. Shane bangs hard on it.

S

No answer. Shane turns away from the door and DONKEY

KICKS it...SMASH! The wood CRACKS, then CRASHES inward.

The entire frame collapses.

INT. TODD'S ROOM

Todd isn't there. Down the hall -- a FLUSH. Oops.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The bathroom door opens, and Todd comes sauntering back.

He sees Shane, the destroyed door and wall...

A piece of the ceiling falls, hits Shane on the head.

Embarrassed, Shane steps aside, then mutters-

Shane SNAPS it onto Todd's wrist, and head down the hall,

patrolling. Zoe comes up the stairs, to her room. She

stops at Todd's door -- they glare at Shane.

Todd nods in agreement.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - MORNING - LATER

S

the Duck watches. With his other hand he loads the PHOTO

of the Chun's license plate into his laptop computer.

His head shifts, he hears something suspicious -- the

rumble of a car approaching.

He rushes for the front door, clicks his alarm remote and

opens it, just as -- WHACK -- the MORNING PAPER connects

with his face, hard. From off-screen we hear a PAPERBOY.

Shane rubs his nose. Lulu screams at the top of her

lungs. Shane turns, to see that Peter is chasing her,

wearing a towel as a sheet. He pretends to be a ghost.

Lulu hides behind Shane. Peter Booos again. Lulu screams.

And then it hits Shane.       His eyes light up.

INT. HALLWAY - LATER

Shane walks slowly down the hall. As he walks he glides

his hands along the wall, feeling, pushing, scanning the

ceiling. Searching.

I

INT. STAIRWAY - SAME TIME

Todd and Zoe kneel on the stairs. They surreptitiously

pour COOKING OIL all over the wood.

Then -- a creak. Zoe whispers.

Zoe and Todd run downstairs and hide behind the couch.

F

Shane strides to the top step and RAPS on the wall. He

RAPS again, listening for hollow spaces. Nothing. Shane

lifts his left foot out to take a step down...

When he hears an alert from his laptop. He goes back to

the living room, then turns his attention to his laptop.

MR. Chun's photo appears next to a VEHICLE REGISTRATION.

Shane scans it...

Todd and Zoe's faces fall. The footsteps again-

But Helga, carrying a huge laundry basket, appears, takes

a step onto the stairs --

BUMP! BUMP! BUMP! She flies down the greased stairs,

BANGING her head and ass on each step, all the way down.

She screams, as laundry flutters down from above.

T

They gulp, terrified.

EXT. SWISS BANK - DAY

Establishing.

INT. SWISS BANK - DAY

Bill and Julie, looking jet-lagged, sit across a desk

from a SWISS BANKER. He seems to be about 100 years old.

He's reading a HUGE stack of paperwork with a magnifying

glass, mouthing along in FRENCH. It's taking him a LONG

time. They wait patiently -- til their patience runs out.

The Banker puts up a finger to "shush" him. Then looks

back to the paperwork, then licks his finger to turn the

page. He licks his finger again, but can't get the page

to turn.

He feebly gets up, and shuffles across the room to a

WATER COOLER. He fills a paper cup with water and

shuffles back to his desk. He dips his finger in the

water to turn the page.

The Banker looks at him blankly.

Another Banker, MARCEL, enters.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - SAME TIME

Helga, suitcases in hand, heads to the door -- Shane

tries to block her path. Peter's in the aquarium. The

duck flies around, QUACKING.

Suddenly, RING! Amid the chaos, Shane moves for the

phone. Helga takes the opening and runs for the door. He

grabs her suitcase. As she tries to wrestle it away,

Shane picks up the receiver.

The suitcase handle breaks off, and Helga dashes for the

door. Shane dives, grabbing her foot. He DRAGS her back.

falls back, against the counter.

He picks up his hand, that landed on a diaper.

Helga's at the door. Shane body-checks it closed. Helga

struggles to get him off. CRUNCH. Helga chomps down on

Shane's hand...

Shane lets go. Helga scampers out the door.

Shane hangs up the phone, as Helga makes a dash down the

path to a waiting cab.

EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Shane chases Helga to the cab.

Helga jumps in the cab.

As the cab pulls away, in the rear window, Helga glares

back, then does an obscene Romanian hand gesture.

ANGLE - SHANE

His jaw drops in disbelief. He drops his head, defeated.

Then -- he slowly glances up.

ACROSS THE STREET

The Korean couple is staring at him, dumbfounded.

ANGLE - SHANE

Rises, takes a deep breath and strides inside.

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Shane enters... to find the kids are all gloomy.    The

baby cries. Shane awkwardly picks the baby up.

Shane reacts, inundated.

FWRPPP!    WE zoom in on the baby's leering face.

self-preservation, everyone bolts from the room.

Nobody will help.     Even Peter runs, holding his nose.

CLOSE-UP - SHANE

He gulps.

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Shane enters, holding out the Baby at full arm's length.

He lowers Tyler onto a changing pad, takes a deep breath,

then pulls out PLIERS and a SCREWDRIVER. Using the tools

as chopsticks, he cautiously unfastens the diaper... And

then -- it flops open. SShane GROANS, repelled.

Shane tries approaching -- he can't do it. Aghast, he

looks around for a solution. Then: Shane picks up the

Baby and dips the bottom half in the toilet, then

FLUSHES, over and over and over.

INT.   HALLWAY - NIGHT

Shane patrols the hall, making sure all the doors and

windows are locked. Lulu is in her pj's.

A hand tugs on Shane's shirt, he looks down to see Lulu.

Lulu doesn't go away, she just stares at him, it starts

making Shane uncomfortable.

twirling the MEDAL in his fingers. Lulu follows at his

heels, like a puppy.

Shane walks room to room, pulling down the shades on

every window.

He bends down to her level, and tries to sound sweet:

Lulu looks at him, like he's an idiot.

Lulu sulks off to bed, and shuts off her light.

All the lights are out, all the kids asleep. Shane

breathes a sigh of relief, and patrols.

INT. KITCHEN - BREAKFAST - MORNING

The Kids are dressed for school. On the table in front of

each place is a tan BAG. The kids sit down at their

designated spots, confused by the MRE's (MEALS READY TO

EAT) in front of them.

Todd, Lulu and Zoe all tear open their bags.

Todd pulls out a bag of CORN BEEF HASH and a Snickers

bar. Zoe pulls out a bag of FETTUCCINE ALFREDO and some

matches. Lulu takes out a bag of turkey slices and a

coffee packet. Shane smiles, proud of his accomplishment.

The Kids stare at "breakfast," dubious.

Shane turns to address them:

Peter stands in his chair, dancing...

Peter's eyes fill with tears.

Shane sighs. Lulu asks Shane:

Lulu crosses her eyes at Shane, then at Tyler -- who

SCREAMS at the top of his lungs. Shane turns to Lulu.

Peter starts bawling, too. He runs away, crying. The

table cloth is yanked to the floor. And the phone rings.

Shane answers, trying to hear over the screaming.

He hangs up. Zoe smiles at him, innocently.

INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The garage door opens, dramatically unveiling Shane. He's

wearing Tyler in a SNUGGLE. Across his chest, he's got a

bandoleer of baby-bottles and juice boxes. Shane can't

hide his contempt as he sees: Julie's WHITE MINIVAN. A

bumper sticker declares "World's Greatest Mom." Shane

puts Tyler in a CAR SEAT. Its interlocking buckle

connects FOUR WAYS. Shane fumbles with it for a while.

It just doesn't add up...

Shane TIES the buckles in a fancy knot.

EXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The car speeds out of the drive, backwards at sixty

m.p.h.. It does a skidding 180 and heads down the street.

EXT. EAST BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - 9:29 A.M.

A big suburban school, Busses and PARENTS are parked at

the curb, STUDENTS of all ages are hurrying inside. The

Minivan skids completely sideways, into a TINY parking

spot -- a death defying, perfect parallel park.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE UP ON: a stopwatch. It hits ZERO, and at that

moment, the SCHOOL'S BELL RINGS.

Holding the stopwatch is the VICE PRINCIPAL MURNEY

(50's). He's HUGE and mean.

He glares at Shane, and the Kids: Shane sits with Tyler

in a Snuggle, holding Peter on a harness, as he plays on

the floor. The Kids are seated around him, mortified.

Murney is unimpressed.

The Kids crack up. Murney is furious.

Murney grimaces as PRINCIPAL CLAIRE NELSON (early 30's)

enters. She's attractive, assured, tough. He withers.

The opens the door for Murney. He exits, fuming.     The

BELL rings.

The teens hustle off to their classes. Shane checks his

TRACKER -- two little red DOTS move away. Good.

Principal Claire eyeballs him... staring him up and down,

as he casually holds the three kids.

She notices NAVY SEAL tattoo on his upper arm. Claire

sees this -- and suddenly reacts, impressed.

Shane stares not sure whether to believe. On the spot,

Claire looks nervously around. She lifts her pants leg...

revealing a tiny ANCHOR TATTOO on her ankle.

She smiles.

EXT. EAST BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - MID-MORNING

Shane, dead serious, (Tyler in Snuggle) is riding the see-

saw in the school's playground. Peter rides on the other

side with a group of KIDS, to balance Shane. Shane types

on his laptop: CLAIRE NELSON. A picture of Claire in a

Naval uniform pops up as well as her stats...

Shane closes the computer, picks up a pair of binoculars.

the school: Zoe is glaring at him through the window from

her seat in a class. Todd, sitting in the back row of a

class, yanks his hood over his head. Lulu waves from 2nd

Grade, delighted.

Along line of FIRST GRADERS wait for the seesaw.

ON THE PLAYGROUND:

Shane stands with his Baby snuggle. Peter is running in

circles around him on his harness, like a tether ball. He

checks his tracking device...

INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME

BINOCULARS P.O.V.: Five hundred students eat at long

tables. Zoe, with a group of HIP FRIENDS, turns her back

to him embarrassed. Todd, in line to get lunch, does the

same. Lulu sees Shane and waves.

Shane puts down his binoculars. He turns to the person in

front of him, with stern intensity.

Reveal: Shane is talking to Tyler, in his safety seat --

trying to get him to eat. Beside Shane, Peter is

destroying a sandwich with animal crackers.

Tyler gurgles, ignoring him. Shane sighs. Principal

Claire sits next to Shane with her lunch tray.

Shane gives her a look. Principal Claire smiles.

Shane sees that Tyler is pouring his juice Box all over

Shane's pants. He yanks Tyler away from him.

Tyler starts to cry -- but Shane stops him from crying by

making a funny face. Tyler laughs. Claire smiles.

Suddenly there's a huge crash around the corner, and the

sound of Students in an uproar. Shane hands Tyler off to

the Principal and leaps over the table...

INT. LUNCH-LINE - CONTINUOUS

Students are in a ring, cheering, as four STUDENTS in

Wrestling Jackets hold Todd. One reaches down and gives

Todd a "wedgy" then another WRESTLER punches him. Todd

slips out of their hold and decks the Wrestler. VP Murney

is watching, but not stopping it. Zoe, in the crowd,

cheers Todd on:

Shane and Claire push through the Students. As soon as

they see the Principal, the crowd freezes.

Silence. Then vice principal Murney steps forward.

Shane turns to Todd, and "punches fists" with him,

impressed.

Murney smirks, and gives her a "I'll handle it" wink.

Todd lunges at him. Shane effortlessly grabs Todd and

Judo FLIPS HIM -- Todd lands on his feet, sticking the

landing. No one is more Ssurprised than Todd and Shane.

The Bell rings, the crowd breaks up. Murney approaches

Shane.

Murney makes a loud Kung Fu CRY and throws a punch,

stopping an inch from Shane's head. Shane doesn't flinch.

Shane puts an arm over Todd's shoulder. Todd shakes him

off and heads to class. Murney snickers to Claire:

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - 2:55

Shane looks exhausted. Peter is asleep in his shoulder,

Tyler is crying, as he keeps watch. The Principal strolls

up.

Then Shane smells what she means -- Tyler's diaper is

full. Shane recoils in disgust, holding Tyler out like a

grenade.

Panicked, he pushes Tyler towards the Principal.

Just then, an alarm in his Jacket GOES OFF. He looks at

his tracker: it's flashing RED 3 RED 3. Shane hands off

Peter and Tyler to the Principal.

INT. 2ND GRADE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Shane runs down the hall, following his tracking device.

It leads him to a door. He bursts though it, doing a

shoulder roll.

INT. 2ND GRADE CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

2ND GRADERS are sitting on the floor. Lulu is in front of

the class, with the Panic Button in her hand. The board

reads: SHOW AND TELL. Shane lands in fight stance -- the

Class applauds. Next to Lulu is a very upstaged LITTLE

BOY with a FROG. Lulu sticks her tongue out at him.

Shane is furious, but the FINAL BELL rings. At that

moment, his Tracker Alarm sounds again. He looks:

CLOSE-UP ON THE TRACKER SCREEN: Two DOTS labeled RED 1

and RED 2, are heading away from the school fast.

Shane runs with Lulu through the mob of Kids. He hands

headed North. He speeds away after them.

EXT. BUSY INTERSECTION - MOMENTS LATER

The BLINKING DOTS on his tracker are side by side, racing

down the road ahead of Shane. They make a sharp right.

Shane makes a right, almost tipping the minivan. He

blasts through a red light.

EXT. IN FRONT OF A CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER

He turns a corner -- a PLYWOOD WALL surrounds the site.

He leaps out of the minivan. He looks at the tracker: Zoe

and Todd are dead ahead, through the fence.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

Two BIG CONSTRUCTION workers are standing on the other

side of the plywood wall -- Shane KICKS out one entire

section, and charges through.

He turns around, to see several CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, all

brandishing tools.

Three Workers rush him. Shane easily takes them out. The

remaining Workers give Shane a scared look -- then RUN.

ANGLE - SHANE

He's alone. He catches his breath, then checks his

tracker. Todd and Zoe's BEEPS are coming from a MANHOLE.

Shane pries off the manhole cover.    He looks down.

IN THE MANHOLE - It's dark and dank.

No sweat. Shane lowers himself down.

INT. SEWER - SAME TIME

Shane lands shoulder deep in DISGUSTING SLUDGE. He

winces, then checks the tracker -- the DOTS are CLOSE,

feet away. Shane trudges through the river of muck.

It's horrific. The DOTS BEEP LOUDER. He's almost there!

He splashes around a corner -- then gasps -- he sees the

blinking lights below the surface. He takes a deep

breath and dives under. He comes up for air with ZOE and

TODD'S HOMING BEACONS. A note is tied to them: "Ha! Ha!"

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Principal Claire sits with the Kids in the living room.

From outside, they hear the front door open, and the

sound of OMINOUS, SQUISHY footsteps.

Then the door swings open, revealing Shane, looking like

a Swamp Creature. Everyone gasps, then covers their

noses. A CUTE YOUNG COP enters behind Shane. Todd

stiffens. Zoe fixes her hair. The Cop looks at them.

The Cop turns to Shane, with a smirk.

The Cop leaves, Zoe checks him out as he goes...

Covering her nose. The smell is BAD.

She practically GAGS as she passes him. Shane looks

around at Scott and Zoe, he doesn't say anything, but

with his hand he makes a "my eyes on you" gesture.

INT. BATHROOM - LATER

Shane is in the shower. He pours an entire bottle of

SHAMPOO over himself.

INT. BACK YARD - DAY

Shane BURNS his clothes in the barbecue.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Tyler is in a high-chair, Peter rocks in a cradle-swing.

Shane enters, in just a towel. He sees on the fridge;

Helga'S SHOPPING LIST -- all junk food. He looks at it,

cringing in disgust, before he notices:

Sitting around the table are Lulu's entire BROWNIE TROOP -

- a dozen little girls in uniforms, they're staring at

him. The Brownies applaud, and whistle.

Shane covers up and leaps into the Family Room, pulling

Lulu after him.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lulu starts to sniffle, close to tears.

Lulu's about to burst into tears. Shane sighs.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Shane, back in "uniform," paces in front of the Brownie

Troop. They are assembled, at attention, Indian Style.

The Brownies stare art him in stunned silence.

INT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATE

The Brownies are in the living room, unpacking boxes of

cookies, getting ready to go. Zoe's on the phone.

Shane blows passed her, revving a cordless POWER DRILL.

VARIOUS SHOTS: As Shane uses the drill to seal every

window and door. He's not just locking them -- he's

SCREWING THEM SHUT WITH DRYWALL SCREWS.

INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Shane's finishing up the last window.

Shane lifts her window so it's open a HALF INCH, then

drills it into place. Shane ushers the Troop out the

door, then loads Peter and Tyler into TWO SNUGGLES -- one

attached to his front, the other to his back. Shane

closes the front door and attaches a "Club" lock to it.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Shane Loads the brownies and toddlers into the minivan.

As the minivan pulls out of the driveway, the camera

CRANES up to...

ZOE'S WINDOW:

Inside, Zoe picks up the phone, hits speed-dial.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Shane pulls the minivan into the crowded parking lot --

the Brownies are all singing 99 Bottles of Beer on the

Wall at the top of their lungs.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER

Shane (double-Snuggled) helps the Brownies set up a card

table to display their cookies.

INT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER

Shane watches the Brownies on the store's CLOSED CIRCUIT

monitor, as he pushes a cart into the store. He looks

around at the bright, colorful boxes of Children's

Cereals, Rainbow Fruit Roll-Ups, Snack packs... NOTHING

looks familiar -- nothing even looks like food.

He sees: a huge, 100 pack VALUE CASE of SPAM. He smiles.

Tyler looks at him -- "what are you, nuts?"

EXT. GROCERY STORE - CONTINUOUS

The Brownies are trying to sell the cookies, but they're

very shy. SHOPPERS blow passed them without even noticing

them. One of the Brownies spots something...

SLOW MOTION: In a shot out of Reservoir Dogs, we see who

she means: A group of bad ass, chubby CUB SCOUTS. They're

headed straight towards the cookie table, menacingly.

The Scouts cackle. The Ugly Scout yanks a box of cookies

away from Lulu. He rips it open, dumping the cookies on

the ground and grinding Uthem with his foot.

The Brownies take off running, clutching their boxes. One

of the Scouts grabs Lulu -- she tugs and tugs, but can't

get away. Finally, the Cub Scout takes her SCARF. He

laughs, and lets her go. The Cub Scouts high-five.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER

Shane heads to the Brownie's table -- but Lulu and the

Brownies are gone. In their place are the Chubby Scouts.

Around his neck, Shane's monitor starts beeping. Shane

takes off running in the direction of the signal.

EXT. PARKING LOT - SECONDS LATER

Shane runs up to the minivan. The Brownies are huddled

behind it, trembling.

Shane eyes the Cub Scouts. Dead serious:

He heads toward the Scouts. The Brownies scream.

Shane stops. He bends down, and points at Lulu's Panic

button. He firmly tells Lulu, who's close to tears:

INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

An extreme CU of the Chuck E. Cheese MANAGER. He wears

braces and head-gear, which causes him to lisp.

Wider reveals...CHAOS. SCREAMING CHILDREN everywhere.

On stage, the Chuck E. Cheese automaton band JAMS.

A LITTLE LATER:

Brownies are running around, playing video games and skee

ball. Shane's watching Peter, in the PLASTIC BALL POOL,

while he holds Tyler in the Snuggle. The Manager

approaches Shane.

The Manager laughs, but the headgear seems to hurt his

face when he smiles.

Frustrated, the Manager picks up a pitcher and exits.

Lulu approaches, she grabs Shane by the sleeve and drags

him over to the stand up Mortal Kombat game.

Shane doesn't like the sound of that. He steps up to the

machine. He cracks his knuckles, stretches. Then he takes

a joy stick. He checks over his shoulder -- Peter's

happily splashing about in the plastic balls.

ON THE SCREEN: they each select a fighter. Lulu picks a

small female character. Shane picks a man who looks LIKE

SHANE. They begin, Lulu screams out with her fighter, in

unison:

She leaps over Shane in a somersault and throws a DOZEN

throwing stars. Then kicks him in the head repeatedly.

The second round starts, Brownies have gathered around to

watch. Lulu's fighter does a series of kicks. Shane can't

even get one punch in -- she pins him to the ground,

kneels on his head, then kicks him in the face. Shane is

taking it really seriously. He's really mad.

They switch sides. Round three starts. Lulu's fighter

picks up Shane's in the air, spins her, then cracks her

in half over his knee... and then a kick in the face.

Lulu's having fun now, she's just avoiding Shane's

fighter, dancing, jumping, while he pounds the buttons,

swinging and missing... Shane's really fuming.

She keeps dancing. It's really annoying. Shane's working

the joy stick hard, slamming buttons, but he can't hit

her. He is KO'd. She does a very obnoxious VICTORY DANCE.

Shane screams and RIPS THE JOYSTICK OFF THE MACHINE.

Sparks fly. Shane looks around to see if the staff

noticed. He and the Brownies sneak away, leaving the

sizzling machine, its joystick dangling by its wires.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Zoe's on the phone, the Zhouse is quiet.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

As Zoe hangs up, we WIDEN OUT: The house is PACKED with

TEENAGERS: they're keeping quiet until the phone is in

its cradle, then the TEENAGE DJ starts the music back up.

Zoe looks around at the mess. She turns to Scott, who

doesn't seem concerned at all.

Zoe rolls her eyes, then notices a WEIRD SWEATY KID,

who's throwing mustard covered baloney slices at the

ceiling, where they stick with a satisfying SQUISH.

VARIOUS SHOTS - The Plummer House:

- Its a huge party: the place is JAMMED, kids everywhere.

- Teenagers come and go through the kitchen's DOGGY DOOR.

EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Shane (Tyler in Snuggle), loads Brownies into the

minivan, counting them. Barking at them like Marines:

EXT. SUBURBAN ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Shane drives, the Brownies are singing 99 Bottles...

again. Suddenly, a look of horror comes across Shane's

face... he spins the minivan in a 180 and floors it.

INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE - LATER - DUSK

Shane (Tyler in Snuggle) bursts in, the Brownies follow.

We see what he forgot: PETER, still happily playing in

the pool of plastic balls. The Manager is watching him.

Shane wades into the ball pool and pulls Peter out, which

is fine, except that he's MISSING HIS DIAPER.

S

Shane grimaces. He holds his breath, and goes down for

the diaper. He disappears under the balls -- for a long

time. The Manager and the Brownies share a concerned

look. He's still down there. Silence.

He surfaces, gasping. He's holding the diaper, out away

from him. He charges across the room with the diaper.

And he bursts out the other doors, at a full run.

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

Shane is exhausted, as he pulls up in the Minivan. He

gets out -- and groans in disbelief. It's insanity: HIP

HOP blasts, gyrating TEENAGERS everywhere, chugging

drinks, making out, peeing in the bushes, jocks throwing

footballs.

Reeling, Shane takes Lulu, Peter and Tyler up the path.

He protectively guides them past the craziness -- until a

football suddenly WHIZZES by. Outraged, Shane snatches

it mid-air -- then CRUSHES the ball. POP!

The jocks flinch, scared, then RUN.   Shane unlocks the

CLUB lock off the door.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Inside is worse, a total wreck.   Zoe's dancing with

Scott.

Shane drags the needle across a record at the D.J.'s

turntables. Everyone recoils from the horrible sound.

Nervous glances -- then everybody suddenly RUNS for the

back! Shane is confused, trying to understand...

then he intuitively dashes past them! He's scoping the

surroundings... windows... vents... AH! The doggy door!

Scott is halfway through the doggy door when Shane grabs

his ankles and yanks him back in. Shane holds Scott

upsidedown by his ankles.

Just then: A MUSTARD SOAKED BALONEY SLICE drops from the

ceiling, sticking to the TOP of Shane's head. PLOP.

Shane's eyes narrow, he takes it off, trying to maintain

his dignity. He fumes...

He hands Scott the mop. Scott gulps - and starts mopping.

CLEANING THE HOUSE.

Miserable TEENS scrub. In a bathroom, Scott and Zoe, in

Playtex gloves, furiously clean. Scott scrubs the toilet

with Pinesol as the Duck swims in the top of the toilet.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE/STUDY - NIGHT

Shane inspects the house, as kids clean. Shane wipes a

finger down the sofa. Clean. He lifts the sofa, and rubs

his finger UNDER IT. He holds it up to a KID... residue.

The Kid quickly starts cleaning again.

A GIRL reorganizes a stack of CD'S. Shane goes over

them, straightening -- then he notices something. He

pulls out a CD: It is a home-burned disk, labeled with a

Sharpie. It reads: GHOST. Oh my god...

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

Two DARK CLAD FIGURES watch, through binoculars. They see

Shane find the CD, and walk out of sight.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE/STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Shane quickly tucks the CD into his pocket.

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - ALMOST DAWN

A long line of exhausted party-goers files out. Scott's

the last one to leave.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - VARIOUS

Shane works his way through the house. It's SPOTLESS:

counter tops glisten, furniture polished. It looks like

Better Homes and Gardens. He heads upstairs. Zoe blows

past him -- into the bathroom, where she throws up. Shane

sits down, outside the bathroom door.

He walks down the hall, Zpounding on doors.

Shane stops. Lulu and Todd step into the hall. Zoe gets

up, shaky and furious, and screams in Shane's face.

Silence. Lulu's crying, Todd picks her up. Shane stands,

helpless. After a beat...

Suddenly -- the power goes out.

Suddenly, TWO NINJAS, all in black BURST in through the

window. Shane spins in fight-stance.

Terrified, Zoe and Todd scoop up the kids and rush down

the hall.

The Ninjas pull a retractable KENDO STAFFS. Wielding them

with great skill. It takes all of Shane's skill to fend

them off -- the three fight, close-quarters and fast.

Until Shane pulls down attic's spring-loaded FOLDING

LADDER and clocks a Ninja with it. He goes down, but

Shane is SHOCKED from behind by the other NINJA. The

Ninjas attack, fiercely -- they're good. Their Kendo

staffs hiss with a powerful ELECTRIC CURRENT. The Ninjas

knock Shane backwards down the stairs...

They leap down after him, pounding him with their staffs,

knocking him into...

INT. PLAYROOM - CONTINUOUS

There are TOYS EVERYWHERE -- like a tornado hit a TOYS-R-

US. Shane fends the Ninjas off. He spots a BASEBALL BAT,

and grabs it, facing them, fiercely. They step back...

Shane swings the bat down on a Ninja's head: It's a

whiffle bat, it makes a silly thunk. Shane and the Ninja

share a surprised look -- then the Ninjas charge. Shane

fends them off with his Whiffle bat. With his foot, he

picks up a FISHER PRICE CORN-POPPER, and uses them both

to fend off blows. It rattles and pops as he fights with

both Toys -- until a Ninja breaks them with one blow.

Shane sees a FARMER JOHN TALKING GAME. He jumps up onto a

shelf and grabs it. He pulls the string, and swings the

plastic disk like a deadly bolo.

WHACK, he hits a Ninja in the head. He swings the Farmer

John like a bull whip -- until a Ninja knocks the shelf

over. Shane crashes down, toys fly, several FURBIES hit

the floor. They echo the fight:

Shane sees: The Ninjas are wearing only Ninja socks -- no

shoes. He grabs a barrel of LEGOS, and flings them all

over the floor. The Ninjas move towards him -- the Legos

and Jacks dig into their feet.

The Ninjas fight as they hobble around, avoiding Legos,

Shane runs to the changing table, then violently squeezes

DESITIN at a NINJA, blinding him.

Shane hangs in the doorway and swings at them, KICKING a

Ninja in the chest. The Ninja CRASHES through the window!

bottle of BABY POWDER. He sprays it in Shane's face...

POOF! The room fills with a CLOUD OF WHITE.

ANGLE - SHANE

He squints, blinded. The cloud dissipates... and Shane

sees he's now alone. He runs to the broken window.

OUTSIDE:

The Ninja's are long gone. Shane bangs the window sill,

disappointed to have lost them.

INT. HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER

Composing himself, Shane approaches Zoe's door.     He

quietly knocks.

A long pause -- then the door creaks open. The kids run

out and hug Shane with all their strength, bawling. Todd

and Zoe enter, terrified. Shane isn't sure what to do...

Then, he hugs Peter and Lulu. He really hugs them.

He hugs them, even Zoe is crying and hugging Shane.

He takes out the CD labeled GHOST.

The kids shudder, relieved. They hug him tighter. He

looks Zoe, eye to eye. He dries her tears:

Zoe and Todd nod. Shane offers his hand to shake. They

shake -- then they hug him, too.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Shane and the Kids sit around Shane's computer. Shane

slips the Ghost CD in the disc drive, pushes play --

CLOSE-UP - COMPUTER MONITOR

The SOUND comes on: it's MUSIC. "Unchained Melody." And

then, PICTURE: Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze at a pottery

wheel. Shane is furious -- a long pause. Then...

Zoe laughs: she can't help it, it's been a long night.

Then, the other kids join in. Soon, even Shane is

laughing too: the telephone RINGS -- they all jump,

startled. Zoe answers it, all smiles, she tries to play

it cool and not frighten her mother:

Shane takes the phone.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

She holds up the strange, metal two pronged KEY.

EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

Early morning, students run in to school. The minivan

pulls up, and Shane emerges with the five kids.

INT. LULU'S CLASSROOM - DAY

The TEACHER shows the children how to dye Easter eggs.

ANGLE on Lulu, making a mess of an egg.   She smiles.

ANGLE on Shane, squashed at a little desk.   He dips an

egg in some purple dye.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

Driver's Ed. An obstacle course with cones. Zoe

nervously drives a small sedan, a crazed TEACHER next to

her. He is gesticulating, SCREAMING, reacting each time

she HITS the gas, then BRAKES, HITS the gas, then BRAKES.

Shane stands off to the side, shaking his head.    Peter

and Tyler are tight in their Snuggles.

INT. LULU'S CLASSROOM - LATER

The TEACHER hangs a series of cute "Turkey Hand" drawings

above the blackboard (the kind where your fingers make

the feathers). She hangs one of a HUGE HAND, and smiles

at Shane, who sits in the back, sunglasses on. Shane

nods, "yeah, I know it's good." Then...

Lulu's classmates all chant, in unison:

INT. THE GYM - MOMENTS LATER

Shane enters. Zoe sits in a folding chair, mortified. She

is holding a broken-off SIDE VIEW MIRROR. Murney stands,

Principal Claire next to him. They look concerned.

Claire nods. Shane gives Zoe a look. Zoe shrugs.

Murney calls into the hallway. Todd enters. Shane stops,

in shock: Todd's long hair is all shaved off, he now has

a bleach blonde BUZZ CUT, giving him a "skinhead" look.

Murney hands Shane a book and Shane flips through it.

It's a book of photographs of NAZI UNIFORMS. Shane

scowls.

Shane shakes his head: Todd is worse than he thought.

Todd and Zoe stand to go, and Shane walks them out.

The WRESTLING TEAM is assembled, stretching. They snicker

and shake their heads at Todd, as he passes. Shane walks

the kids out, and Murney chases after him.

He "fake-punches" one of his Boys -- who flinches like

Murney has maybe hurt him a couple times. Murney laughs.

Shane walks away. Without warning, Murney lets out a Kung

Fu SCREAM, and leaps at Shane, kicking him in the BACK,

Shane trips forwards to his knees. Murney tells his team:

Shane dusts off his back, and leaves.

Shane turns back. It looks like Shane might fight, but

instead he takes a deep breath, and leaves. Murney shakes

his head, and snickers to his Team.

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

The minivan pulls up, with Shane and all the Plummers

piled in. Shane parks, Todd runs towards the house. Shane

holds Todd back by the arm.

INT. TODD'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Shane knocks on Todd's door. Nothing. He enters. The

window is wide open, Shane checks his window alarm --

there's a REFRIGERATOR MAGNET stuck to it, keeping the

contact, so the alarm didn't go off.

Shane looks out the window -- far down the block, he can

see Todd, running around the corner. Shane hops out the

window. He sees Zoe, peering out her window.

He starts to shut the window, but the Duck leaps up on

the sill.

The Duck leaps out. Shane screws the window shut. On the

corner, Shane sees Todd climbing on to a CITY BUS.

Shane picks a GIRL'S BICYCLE up off the front lawn. It's

pink, with a flowered basket. It's small for him, but he

hops on and pedals furiously after the bus.

EXT. CITY STREET NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Shane, on the girl-bike, pedals after the bus. A few

HOMEBOYS watch him pass, curiously. He nods back, tough.

EXT. OLD WAREHOUSE - DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT - LATER

The bus stops in a rundown neighborhood Todd hops off the

bus. Shane's arrives a moment later, dripping sweat. He

stashes the bike behind a mailbox...

Shane'S P.O.V.: At the entrance to the old warehouse,

Todd meets up with three other TEENAGE BOYS, they're

dressed in brown HITLER YOUTH UNIFORMS, they head inside.

Shane follows them, stealthily.

INT. OLD WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Shane follows the Hitler Youth into a large room, set up

with folding chairs. He hides in a dark corner. Todd and

the Hitler Youth enter, and take seats. A CREEPY MAN in

a scarf walks out, and stands in front of them. Shane

watches as the MAN addresses the Hitler Youth.

The Nazis stand at attention. Shane is horrified...

in lederhosen as the SINGING VON TRAPP family enter, and

join the "Nazis." There's also a few NUNS, a CAPTAIN VON

TRAPP, and a MARIA. The Creepy Man is, in fact, a good

natured, slightly foppish DIRECTOR.

Todd heads up to the stage, the Director arranges him and

the ACTRESS PLAYING LIESL (40ish) into position. An

ACCOMPANIST begins on piano, Todd sings, remarkably well:

Shane bursts into laughter. His whole face lights up for

the first time ever...

Todd and Liesl dance. Todd is good, but nervous. He

attempts a spinning kick, but he slips, and hits the

stage, clutching his ankle. He gets up, and limps to the

seats. The Director walks onto the stage, upset. He

looks up, to heaven:

He throws down his script. The Cast is stunned.

And, on his own cue... he exits stage right, in a huff.

The entire cast looks to Todd, fuming.

Shane jumps up from his hiding place, startling

everybody. Everyone steps back. Todd is terrified.

Shane kneels down beside Todd. He closes his eyes, and

begins rubbing his hands together like Mr. Miyagi.

Shane grabs Todd's ankle hard and unceremoniously CRACKS

it, and yanks him to his feet.

Todd smiles, relieved. They sit on the edge of the stage.

Shane smiles wistfully. Todd relaxes.

Shane looks at the Cast, they look pretty glum as they

pack up their costumes. Todd looks devastated -- only a

moment after Shane saw him happier than ever. Shane

straightens up, grabbing Todd by the shirt collar. BEAT.

Everyone looks around, they're not sure what to do... off

Shane's glare, they quickly assemble on stage.

There's some mumbling. Liesl chimes in.

Shane shakes his head.

Everyone nods... Todd looks up at Shane. He smiles.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER

Shane's patrolling the hallway. He hears Zoe in her

room, BREAKING something, angrily. He peeks in -- just as

Zoe THROWS her cell-phone into the wall, furious.

Shane exits. He turns out the light.

INT. LULU'S ROOM - LATER

Shane tucks Lulu into bed.

Shane looks at her surprised. He sits on the bed...

Stumped. Then he starts:

As Shane finishes the story, he illustrates, setting up

the scene with DOLLS, on Lulu's floor.

AN HOUR LATER:

Shane's really into the story. Lulu's fallen asleep.

Shane's eyes are brimming with tears as he finishes:

Then, from across the hall, Peter WAILS.   Todd pops his

head in the door.

The wails get louder and LOUDER...

INT. NURSERY - CONTINUOUS

Tyler's asleep. Shane sighs, and whispers to Peter,

reading from Todd's notes:

Peter starts bawling. Shane doesn't know what's wrong.

Todd calls from the doorway...

Shane sighs. He sings again, mortified. He does the dance

as he sings... Shane hops forward three times.

Peter applauds. Humiliated, Shane crab-walks sideways.

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - MORNING - THE NEXT DAY

As Mr. Chun gets his paper, Shane, (Tyler in the

snuggle), hands out bag lunches as the Kids load into the

minivan. Shane turns and catches Mr. Chun, staring.

INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Todd sits in the back of the Minivan, listening to Sound

of Music on his Walkman, Lulu is next to him, with her

Gameboy, Zoe and Peter are half asleep. Shane climbs into

the PASSENGER SEAT. Zoe realizes he's staring at her,

through the mirror.

T

The Kids sit bolt upright. They turn to Zoe, terrified.

She gets out in shock, and gets in the driver's seat. The

other Kid's seat belts CLICK loudly.

The Kids share a dubious look. Zoe backs jerkily out.

INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

Zoe is super-tense as they drive. Shane is nervous, but

trying not to show it. Lulu and Todd are terrified.

Zoe's looking RIGHT at him, not the road.

semi SCREAMS through the intersection. Shane is shaky.

Zoe is surprised. Touched. She pulls out, jerkily.

EXT. BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - LATER

Zoe pulls to the curb, almost tapping a bus's rear

fender. Shane unclenches his teeth.

Zoe smiles. And the other Kids all bolt from the car,

terrified. Lulu makes a big show of kissing the ground.

T

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals: SCOTT (Zoe's boyfriend), with a

few FRIENDS, laughing, being obnoxious. Shane jumps out

of the car. Before Scott knows what's happened, Shane's

LIFTED him in the air by his backpack. Scott's terrified.

Scott nods, trembling. Shane lets him down and heads into

school.

INT. BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL, CAFETERIA - LUNCHTIME

Shane (Peter in lap, Tyler in snuggle) keeps an eye on

the Kids at their tables. KIDS boisterously run past.

Suddenly -- Claire BARKS out.

The kids instantly freeze. Claire strides into view.

She's wearing a cute dress, and a little make-up.

Chastened, the kids gulp and orderly march away. Shane's

eyes alight, impressed.

T

S

She's waiting for him to say... something.

She smiles. He smiles back... Suddenly, there's a

commotion: Murney is marching Todd towards them, dragging

him by the ear. Principal Claire sighs "not again." In

one move, Shane leaps over the table. Principal Claire

watches him leap:

Murney shoves Todd forward.

Murney gets up in Shane's face.

E

whisper goes through the cafeteria. Murney turns around.

A hushed "oooh" goes through the Students.

The Students snicker. Todd looks, intimidated. Then:

Silence. No one's sure they heard him right. Todd pulls

out a stack of SOUND OF MUSIC FLYERS and hands them out.

Todd is on the poster in his Rolf costume. Principal

Claire takes one: she laughs, now it all makes sense.

M

sheepishly, Todd's telling the truth. Murney looks

around, humiliated, furious --

Murney takes ONE STEP towards Todd -- Shane steps between

them, protecting him.

Murney glares at him -- face to face. So calm, it's scary

Everyone is watching. Murney did not expect to be called

out. His voice cracks -- then he regains his calm:

He storms out. There is a stunned moment -- and then a

mob of Students, and a lot of CUTE GIRLS, swarm Todd,

taking flyers. Shane gives Todd a proud thumbs up.

A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS: Of STUDENTS whispering to other

STUDENTS, passing notes: A Kid opens a note -- it reads:

"Murney's getting his ass kicked. 3:00."

INT. GYM - 3:00

The bleachers are PACKED. Murney struts out onto the mat.

The two fighters begin circling one another. The

Wrestlers scream for Murney. Todd cheers Shane on.

Murney roars and CHARGES Shane. Shane defensively uses

Murney's momentum to flip him halfway across the mat.

WHAM. Murney lands on his back.

The Wrestlers mouths drop. Murney, shocked, climbs to his

feet and CHARGES again, Shane side-steps, and sweeps

Murney -- sending him right into the wall, hard.

Murney bounds to his feet, rushes Shane. Shane DIVES

OVER Murney, grabs onto Murney's waist. Shane's momentum

pulls Murney backwards -- BAM. Murney's shoulders hit the

mat with Shane smiling down on him.

Todd flops to the mat, raises his hand and SLAPS it down-

Shane stands. Shane throws an arm around Todd, and they

head out. The Wrestling Team huddles around Murney, who's

quietly twitching on the ground, mumbling something.

They walk out. The crowd cheers. Claire, too. Shane

smiles at her as he passes. She gives him a thumbs up.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Shane marches the Brownies through a FOREST.    He wears

Peter and Tyler in front and rear Snuggles.

The girls are loving it, fascinated.

Shane kicks over a ROCK.    Underneath are crawling BUGS.

He scoops up some bugs and EATS them.

The Brownies are frozen in shock.

E

UPBEAT MUSIC kicks in over the following MONTAGE:

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - DAWN

Shane leads the Brownie Troop through Combat exercises.

In unison, the Girls PUNCH, KICK. PUNCH, PUNCH, KICK.

Shane's got Tyler's cradle next to him, in between

punches, in perfect tempo, he reaches out and rocks it.

The Duck watches all this -- fascinated.

EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

The lot is empty. Shane and Zoe sit in the minivan, Shane

races through a slalom of orange cones -- she hits EVERY

ONE -- the wheel hubs are CLOGGED with cones. She skids

to a stop just short of the "Severe Tire Damage" spikes.

INT. NURSERY - DAY

Shane changes Tyler's diaper WITH ONE HAND. In his other

hand he's reading The Brownie Handbook. It's open to a

page that reads "Knot Tying."

INT. OLD FACTORY - DAY

The CAST is assembled on stage, where Shane has set up a

scale model of the set on the floor. He illustrates the

stage directions, by moving around toy army men:

He laughs at his own joke... The Kids don't get it.

EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY

Zoe leaps into the minivan through the windows. Zoe peels

out and weaves the cones...

she only clips one, it teeters, but doesn't fall. Shane

gives her a signal, she throws it in reverse and drives

the course backwards.

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - DAY

Lulu, in   her BROWNIE uniform, ties a complicated knot --

we WIDEN   to see she's tying Shane's hands behind his

back, as   the Brownie troop watches. He counts "1,2,3..."

and then   begins wriggling free. They watch closely.

EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY

Shane and Zoe are huddled under the minivan's dashboard.

Shane's showing her the IGNITION WIRES.

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

Shane blows a WHISTLE.

Todd tries the kick. THUD!    Shane BLOWS the whistle.

INT. NURSERY - NIGHT

At the end of Peter's crib, Shane performs the "Panda

Dance." Singing and doing all the moves -- he's got it

down, adding a James Brown flourish, now and then.

He does a spin kick. Then he tucks Peter in.

Shane is so touched, he almost bursts into tears. He

kisses Peter on the forehead.

EXT. "PRICE CLUB" STORE - EVENING

The Brownies sit at their cookie table beside the door.

Across the lot, the Chubby Cub Scouts, at their own

table, see them. The Scouts head towards the Brownies.

He stops short, the Brownies have moved into a FORMATION,

ready to strike, Lulu at the front: it's (kind of) scary.

The Scouts share a look -- they LAUGH. The head Scout

steps forward and grabs Lulu's cookies. In one move, she

spins out of the way and pulls off his neckerchief.

He grabs the neckerchief, but like lightning, she wraps

it around his arm, tying him. She shoves a cookie in his

mouth.

The Scout struggles, the Other Scouts are scared.

She lets him go -- in a FLIP, he lands on the ground

hard. Lulu lets out another "kia!" The Girls move

forward in unison, striking a cool pose.

INT. "PRICE CLUB" STORE - CONTINUOUS

Shane shops, wearing the double snuggle. As he's

comparing prices -- he sees, on the security monitor: The

Brownies attacking the Cub Scouts. He smiles, proud.

EXT. "PRICE CLUB" STORE - A MOMENT LATER

The Cub Scouts have all been tied with their own bandanas

to the CART CORRAL. Shane comes out of the store, and

catches Lulu, using his "catchphrase."

The Scouts nod, terrified. Shane gives her a stern look,

then LAUGHS.

INT. VAN - DRIVING - DUSK

Shane drives. The Brownies joyously CHANT a MARCH.

INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - LATER

Shane works his way down the hall, checking on the kids:

- LULU'S ROOM: LULU is asleep.

- TODD'S ROOM: The door is OPEN -- Shane peers in. Todd

has a SWITCHBLADE. He is practicing with it, clicking it

open, tossing it hand to hand. Off Shane's look:

Shane takes the switch blade, and performs an AMAZING

trick with it, spinning Sit like a pro.

He heads down to Zoe's room and peaks in -- SHE'S NOT IN

BED. He rushes in -- but she's out on...

EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

Zoe sits on the railing, she seems sad. Shane approaches.

Shane nods.

Zoe's eye well up, then she cries. Shane holds her.

Shane is a little taken by surprise. Then -- he decides

to answer. He takes his Sfather's MEDAL out of his pocket.

He looks at the Medal.

A tear runs down Zoe's face. She throws her arms around

Shane. The phone rings. Shane answers it.

He's left alone.

EXT. BACK YARD - LATE NIGHT

The house is dark. Shane sits in a lawn chair, scoping

turns. Gary's foot is caught in a grate.

Shane gets down on his hands and knees and gently pries

Gary's foot from the grate. Shane is about to stand when

something below catches his eye.

Shane pulls out a pen flashlight, shines it down the

grate... we see a CRANK WHEEL.

Shane tugs at the grate until it pops off. Shane grips

the valve and tries turning it. Nothing. He tries harder,

muscles rippling, and then it gives... The wheel spins.

below the garage. Shane steps down it...

INT. BOTTOM OF STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

There's a small room, and a hall leading to a STEEL DOOR.

It's solid and inscrutable. No hinges or cracks. The only

break in its surface is a strange, TWO-PRONGED KEYHOLE.

Shane looks on stunned...

INT. GARAGE - MORNING

Shane's at the Steel Door. He has high-tech tools laid

out in front of him. He's been trying, unsuccessfully, to

crack the lock all night. The Kids are watching his

progress, Lulu hands him a tool. Shane dials a phone.

EXT. SEDAN - MOVING

We pan up from the WHITE "US GOV" license plates to Bill

at the wheel. Julie sits beside him. Bill's cell phone

rings, he answers it.

Bill reacts, excited.

INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Shane smiles, pleased, and hangs up. Then we slowly MOVE

UP. Away from Shane... towards the neighbor's house.

spying on Shane. An ominous pause.

She looks stricken.

He goes silent.    Tongue-tied, he has no answer.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Bill's Sedan pulls up.    Julie and Bill hop out.

INT. JULIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Julie opens the door, comes into the dark hall. Bill is

carrying her suitcases.

She trails off...

They listen -- they hear, in the next room, Kids singing

a beautiful, a capella version of The Hills are Alive

(with The Sound of Music). She turns on the lights --

what she sees makes her drop her luggage, in shock.

J

JULIE'S P.O.V.: The house is spotless. The rug is

vacuumed. The fish tank is clear, filled with healthy

TROPICAL FISH.

Dumb-struck, Julie goes to the...

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The kitchen is sparkling clean, no dishes in the sink.

She sees, attached to the fridge with magnets: A flyer

for Sound of Music, featuring Todd.

JULIE almost faints. Bill steadies her. She staggers

to...

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Shane and the Kids are holding up a home-made sign:

WELCOME HOME, MOM! Todd pushes STOP on a CD player: The

Sound of Music stops.

Zoe is in a conservative dress, Todd a button down and

khakis: barely recognizable. Lulu has bows in her hair.

Peter is fresh faced, smiling, Tyler is asleep: a picture-

perfect family.

Julie starts bawling. The Kids rush forward and hug her.

Across the room, Shane sees Bill enter. Shane stiffens

and salutes proudly.   S

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Shane leads Bill inside. Bill holds the pronged key.

Bill stops, surprised.   Shane continues, a bit reluctant.

S

Suddenly, an ANGRY VOICE.

WIDE

Shane and Bill spin, startled.    The CHUNS strides up,

GUNS DRAWN.

Compliant, Shane puts his hands behind his head. He

takes a submissive position... Mrs. Chun comes closer,

reaching for Bill's key... Shane shoots Bill a glance...

Shane SPINS and grabs both guns! He WHACKS the Koreans'

forearms, while SLAMMING their heads together.

glory -- when suddenly, CRACK! A third gun BUTTS him in

the head.

CLOSE-UP - SHANE

Lights out. He turns, startled, and starts to fall.

Disoriented, confused, he looks up as he drops...

SHANE'S POV

He is losing consciousness. Things are spinning... woozy.

Shane peers in confusion, then passes out.

FADE IN:

INT. NURSERY - MOMENTS LATER

Julie and the Kids are on the floor, tied up. Peter and

Tyler are caged in the play pen. Peter has a JUICE BOX.

The Korean Man (Mr. Chun) secures the room, closing the

window shades. Bill checks the knots binding the

children. They whimper, scared.

He GAGS the kids.    Julie glares, livid.

Bill GAGS Julie. The Kids are furious. Bill and Mrs. Chun

exit.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Shane lies unconscious. Bill and Mrs. Chun approach the

steel door. Bill inserts the two-pronged key... and it

CLICKS. The door HUMS, then slides OPEN!

Inside is a dark corridor.      Bill grins.   They enter...

INT. SECRET VAULT

Light is at the end.    They anxiously tiptoe, reaching...

THE VAULT! Spare, bright and white. The floor is

covered with square tiles. At the far end is a LARGE

ELEVATED SAFE. Beside the safe is a red switch, with two

settings: ARMED and DISARMED. It's set on ARMED. The air

is filled with an ominous, low-pitched HUM, like a

monstrous computer. Bill eyes the safe.

She confidently strides toward the safe -- which sets off

hidden flame-throwers in the walls. A jet blast of FLAME

shoots out! She leaps back just in time, but the shoulder

of her jacket is on fire. Bill pats out the flames with

his own jacket. Chun is Bokay, just missing BOTH eyebrows.

Mrs. Chun's eyebrows are neatly, completely SINGED OFF.

INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

Mr. Chun guards the kids, eyeballing them icily.

Lulu "looks" scared. But behind her back, we reveal her

HANDS untying her ropes! Freed, she hits her panic

button! O.S., BEEPING. Lulu grins hopefully: Shane's

coming! A beat... then Mr. Chun pulls the Tracker from

his pocket. He sneers.

Lulu frowns, then leans back against Zoe. With a rapid

blur of finger-work, she unties Zoe! Then -- needing a

distraction, she signals Tyler and crosses her eyes.

Tyler GASPS, horrified -- and SCREAMS HIS LUNGS OUT.

Chun spins, startled -- and Lulu quickly ROLLS across the

room! She lands against Todd, quickly assuming a fake

bound position, as if she hadn't moved.

Mr. Chun whirls -- the Kids look innocent. Mr. Chun is

confused for a second: "wasn't he tied to the other one?"

I

W

BEHIND TODD - Lulu frantically unties Todd's ropes --

it's gonna be close...

Chun scowls. Skeptical, he steps closer... He leans down

to look at Todd's ropes Z--

Peter SQUIRTS JUICE into Mr. Chun's face. The Kids use

the distraction: Todd POPS to his feet, then LEAPS into

his SPIN KICK: it connects with Mr. Chun's head.

All the kids bounce up. They untie Julie, then scoop up

Peter and Tyler. Mr. Chun growls and starts to stagger

up. Lulu lands in Karate stance and calls out:

The other Kids take off, Mr. Chun looks at Lulu.   Mr.

Chun laughs:

drops to his knees in pain, then, when he's at her level,

she KICKS him right in the nuts. It HURTS.

Mr. Chun tries to grab her by the wrist, but Lulu EVADES

with her cool, snake-like move. Lulu runs, slamming the

door behind her. Mr. Chun gets up and turns the

doorknob, but the door won't budge...

INT. OUTSIDE THE NURSERY - CONTINUOUS

Zoe shoves a chair between the door and the opposite

wall, they're trapped inside.

INT. NURSERY - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Chun punches the door, making a small hole. He

reaches out to knock the chair away but he can't quite

reach. He puts his face up to the hole he's made...

Todd's outside with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER: he blasts Mrs.

Chun's face.

He sticks his face out the hole... DONNGGG -- Todd hits

him square in the face with the fire extinguisher ITSELF.

EXT. FRONT DOOR - SAME TIME

The family comes scrambling out -- but as Julie exits, a

HAND suddenly GRABS her.

She SCREAMS. Bill lurches into view, clutching her! The

kids are horrified. They start to run back, but she

urgently gestures --

The kids fret, unsure, then nod and run to the side

garage. Zoe and Todd load the kids into the minivan.

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Bill pulls Julie inside. Mrs. Chun listens to Mr. Chun ON

THE RADIO, speaking in Korean:

SPARKS FLY as Zoe hot-wires the minivan. She floors it...

Chun hops into Bill's car and races after them.

Zoe floors it.

The sedan GUNS its engine, gaining on them.

WHOOOOOO! The kids SCREAM, as they sail through the

intersection! The sedan keeps chasing.

INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME

Bill has Julie at gunpoint, leading her to the secret

door. They step past Shane's body, lying on the concrete.

Julie GASPS, chilled. Then, a CRACKLING of static.    Mrs.

Chun exits the vault, holding a military RADIO.

Julie goes frantic, emotional.

Surprised, everyone looks down.

They look over -- Shane is standing in the doorway.

Bill uncuffs Shane.

EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

The vehicles race, Chun just inches from the kids' tail.

He tries to pass them on the right. It's like a chariot

race, Chun zooming by, half on the sidewalk, to cut them

off!

INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

Todd scrambles into the back seat. He does something we

can't see, as Zoe drives.

The sedan pulls up beside them. Zoe makes a very lewd

gesture at him. It throws Mr. Chun off for a beat.

Zoe floors it, Mr. Chun is now face to face with Todd --

who throws a dirty diaper into the his face. Mr. Chun

swerves and almost wrecks. Lulu starts PELTING Mr. Chun

with debris: milk cartons, crayons, orange peels.

Rubbish clobbers him. Exasperated, Mr. Chun ROLLS UP his

window, then POUNDS the gas! Faster! About to pass...

Zoe looks over. Chun is pointing a gun!             She suddenly

PULLS the emergency brake.

WIDE

RRRRRRRR!!    The Van SPINS into a squealing 360.

Mr. Chun SCREAMS, disoriented, and loses control.

In the van, Peter laughs.

The Van spins madly. The sedan skids and PLOWS into a

store window. CRASH!! The kids cheer, triumphant.

INT. SECRET VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

Shane scopes out the vault. The walls and ceilings are

covered with high-tech weaponry. Mrs. Chun holds Julie.

Bill waits impatiently. Shane is figuring his options...

A bewildered beat -- then Julie pulls out a tube of

Binaca. Shane SQUIRTS it, revealing in the mist a myriad

of crisscrossing LASER BEAMS.

Shane steps forward. He speaks aloud, confidently:

Bill reacts, puzzled.

Shane steps forward - ZAP! The floor tile SHOCKS HIM,

sending him flying backwards. Bill laughs. Shane gets up,

in pain.

mists the air to see the beams: He steps forward, over

one beam and ducking under another -- he miscalculates: a

BURST OF FLAME blazes from the ceiling like a giant blow

torch, Shane leaps back, landing on his hands and knees.

CLOSE-UP - SHANE

Shane's thinks. He notices a GROOVE carved in the floor,

not quite centered to the room. He feels the Groove.

Something she said...

Shane feels the Groove in the floor. He thinks. He looks

up at the ceiling (bottom of the first floor).

E

Shane LAUGHS sharply. That's the code! He shares a look

with Julie. Bill and Julie share a look -- they have no

idea what he's laughing about.

Calmness comes to Shane's face. He takes a deep breath,

facing forwards:

He hops forwards three times, fearlessly. NOTHING

HAPPENS. No BOOBY TRAPS are set off.

He steps sideway, across two tiles. Again -- NOTHING

HAPPENS. It dawns on Julie what he's doing. Julie smiles,

relieved. Shane he steps forwards, then back:

When he steps back -- A SPRING-LOADED SPIKE launches down

from the ceiling, imbedding itself where he was standing.

Shane is rattled, his focus gone. Until Julie shouts:

Shane snaps out of it and flops down on his back -- just

in time: FLAMES SHOOT FROM BOTH WALLS right at him. If

he'd been standing, he'd be toast.

EXT. BUSY INTERSECTION - SIMULTANEOUS

The Minivan blasts through another yellow.

There is a POLICE CAR cruising the street ahead of them.

Zoe blows past it. Inside is the Cute Cop. The Squad

Car's lights flash on, and he catches up with the minivan

-- it takes a while, they're FLYING.

Zoe slows down so the Police Car can pull up beside her.

The Cute Cop shouts over at Zoe.

She swerves into the Squad Car, almost running it off the

road. Zoe U-turns, and speeds back towards her house. The

Squad Car turns around and chases her.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

The Minivan speeds by. The Squad Car is on its tail. It

is joined by MORE SQUAD CARS. Following the chase, at a

safe distance, is Mr. Chun in his now-wrecked sedan.

EXT. SCHOOL - SAME TIME

Murney and Claire are watching a SOCCER GAME.   He's in a

NECK-BRACE.

She shakes her head, Suddenly, the Minivan SPEEDS by.

VROOOOM! Then the Police Car CHASES by. VROOOM!! Then --

FIVE MORE POLICE CARS ZOOM BY. VROOOOOOM!!!

Claire frowns, concerned...

INT. PLUMMER BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Shane is on the floor, sliding forward, nervously.

Shane jumps up just AS THE FLOOR UNDER HIM DROPS AWAY,

revealing a pool of liquid. Shane has wedged himself in

the corner. A bead of his sweat falls into the liquid,

and sizzles in a cloud of smoke. It's acid.

He jumps, to the left of the HOLE. He lands in front of

THE SAFE. He's relieved -- then nozzles spray YELLOW GAS

at him. He holds his breath just in time. Still holding

his breath:

He flips the switch to DISARMED. The safe's red light

turns green. Immediately, the flamethrowers and blowguns

retract! The gas gets sucked into grates. The whole

room goes SILENT. Whew.

Bill looks around. He nervously steps forward - he waves

his hand over the floor, and jumps back. Nothing happens.

Bill signals for Mrs. Chun to go first. She gestures

back: you go. It's a stand-off. Finally, Bill takes a

breath -- and walks across the room. The Booby Traps are

disarmed. Mrs. Chun follows, pulling Julie along.

Shane scowls, disgusted.

Beat.   Bill shrugs.

Bill turns to the safe. He starts to reach for the

dial... then catches himself. Something's not right.

Shane reaches for the safe, before he reaches the dial --

Bill thinks, trying to read Shane's poker face. Shane

shrugs. Bill gestures to Mrs. Chun.

Mrs. Chun doesn't budge.

Reluctantly - Mrs. Chun reaches out, and touches the

dial. Nothing happens. Relief. She turns it, and ZAPPPPP!

1000 volts ELECTROCUTES her, her hair on end, shaking

from the voltage...

Bill is off guard, Shane kicks his gun away! The gun

skids into the acid and plunges, SIZZLING. Bill is

incensed, but Shane gazes coldly.

Full of himself, Bill LUNGES. And he's strong!     He

shoves Shane back, then PUNCHES him in the gut.

Shane glares, then returns an onslaught of BLOWS.

Shane's fury is unleashed: A volley of attacks, hitting

Bill's arms, head, legs! He's crazed, unrelenting.

But suddenly Mrs. Chun LEAPS onto his back.

She SCREAMS and grabs his throat. Shane struggles to

lose her. Suddenly, he drops and FLIPS her. She

catapults, stumbles backwards across the room, and stops

just inches from the acid! She teeters, tottering,

unable to gain her balance.

Shane shakes his head, then runs to grab her outstretched

hand. She smiles, saved. But he's unforgiving.

Shane COLD-COCKS her, knocking her out. Suddenly --

Bill is charging him.   Shane whirls, delivering a

ROUNDHOUSE KICK. OOF!   Bill gets slammed in the chest.

Bill tumbles, the wind knocked out of him. He jumps to

his feet, delivering a series of hard punches, which

Shane deflects -- they tangle like pro's. It's clear the

both have the same training. They punch, spin, kick,

connecting only occasionally. Bill wheels around and

lands a kicks squarely in Shane's chest. Shane tumbles,

landing on his back in front of the safe.

ANGLE - BILL

He steps over Shane. Leering mercilessly, he jabs the

spike against Shane's throat.

Julie gasps. Shane narrows his eyes, then whispers/sings.

The CODE! A BELL rings, and the safe door flies open!

SLAMMING Bill in the head! BONG! Bill's collapses and

drops. K.O.!

EXT. PLUMMER'S STREET - SAME TIME

The minivan races toward the house.   The Police Cars

chase after, SIRENS wailing.

IN THE VAN, everyone is SCREAMING.

WIDE

She squeals into the driveway, then BRAKES.

But it's too late. The van SKIDS, smoke BURNING from the

tires -- and hits a tree. The Kid spill out and run.

The lead Police Car screeches to a stop.   POLICE leap

from the car.

INT. SECRET VAULT - SAME TIME

Shane and Julie stare at each other, then look in the

safe:

Inside, the cavernous metal box holds but one object: A

tiny COMPUTER CHIP. Shane gently removes it.

They look in silence. She smiles at Shane, grateful.

Then -- a sudden AMPLIFIED VOICE from behind them:

EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

Total commotion. The kids clamber from the van, with

their hands raised. Cops surround them. Even Peter and

Tyler have their little hands over their heads.   The

garage door raises, Shane steps out.

Cops cover Shane and Julie, Julie and Shane Freeze.

Silence. The Cops are unsure what to do. He scoffs.

Suddenly -- a CRAZED SCREAM.

WIDE

Everyone spins. Mr. Chun stands inside the gate,

pointing a ROCKET LAUNCHER. He's disheveled and manic.

The cops freeze, helpless. Shane weighs his not so many

options... Nobody is sure what to do.

But then -- a WOMAN suddenly flips over the fence, vaults

onto Chun, and KNOCKS him out with a Karate Chop.

Claire lands on her feet, triumphant. Even Chun is

amazed, as he turns his head, Shane spins, and grabs the

rocket launcher.

CLOSE-UP - SHANE

He breaks into a big grin.

CLOSE-UP - CLAIRE

She proudly smiles back at him.

ANGLE - THE CUTE COP

He's flummoxed. This chaos is unsolvable.    Beaten, he

reaches for his radio.

EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LATER

F.B.I. AGENTS swarm the area. Bill and the Chuns are

being hauled away in cuffs. Julie huddles with the kids.

Shane talks with an F.B.I. Agent.

The Agent hands him a BUSINESS CARD, then walks off.

Shane examines it, swelling with pride.

INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

The Kids are looking around, watching the FBI Agents

work. Lulu is following one of the FBI Agents around.

Zoe is looking at the safe. She sees, fallen onto the

floor, from the safe, a letter. Her siblings, and Julie

notice, and gather around. Zoe reads the LETTER:

A tear comes to her eye. The Plummers hug each other.

EXT. THE PLUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Claire walks up to Shane. Mock-angry.

Shane looks at her. He looks around: at the family. He

looks at Claire....

Shane smiles slyly and pulls her close.

Claire beams. The Plummers all approach, interrupting.

Zoe gives them a look -- that makes Shane and Claire

BLUSH. Lulu turns to Shane, sad.

She puts out her hand, to shake his.

He surprises her with a BEAR HUG -- he hugs the whole

family at once, squeezing them off the ground. He puts

them down. Before he goes: he reaches down and gives Zoe -

- his medal. He squeezes her hand around it.

TIGHT - SHANE

This is too much.    He wipes his face.

Shane bawls -- he can't keep it in. He starts to head

off, Lulu calls after him:

A long beat.    Julie looks up, baffled.

INT. VICTORIA THEATRE, BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Close on Shane:

Wider reveals the Cast of `The Sound of Music'.

Shane's military-march version of the musical. Nuns sing

"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?" The Von Trapp

kids perform "So Long, Farewell."

In the audience, Julie watches in astonishment. She is

surrounded by her children. Scott: in a suit, his hair

combed, Claire: dressed to the nines, the little Brownie

Troop, even Murney. Lulu has a basket in her lap --

inside: GARY THE DUCK and his new family, the most

adorable ducklings you ever saw.

They all watch, rapt.

You Are Sixteen begins. Shane watches with bated breath.

Todd spins. In SLOW MOTION, he leaps into the SPIN KICK.

It's fantastic -- a Michael Jordan dunk. The AUDIENCE

goes nuts, Shane stands, and shouts:

The Audience stares at him, until he sits back down,

beaming with pride.

Finally: "CLIMB EVERY MOUNTAIN." Hearts swell, as the

family crosses the papier-mache alps.

A STANDING OVATION. The performers take their curtain

calls, then giddily gesture Shane to come out. He humbly

steps into view -- and the house goes crazy. Thundering

applause. A cellophane bouquet of flowers gets thrust on

him. Shane smiles, touched. Mission accomplished.
