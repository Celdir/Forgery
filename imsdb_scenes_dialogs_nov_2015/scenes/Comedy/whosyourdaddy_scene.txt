FADE IN:

EXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY

We fly high above heavenly clouds.  Beneath a brilliant blue

sky.  A TEENAGED BOY'S VOICE greets us...

Descending through the clouds, we are caught for a moment in

a dreamy gauze.  We emerge to find ourselves gliding above a

small town.  Descending lower.  And lower.  To Xenia, Ohio.

We pass over the town square. A fine spring day in middle

America. Red brick buildings with names like "Miller & Son

Drugs," "Two Sisters Gifts," "Nelson Family Market."   You

can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber.

Still flying over the town, we focus on a TEENAGED BOY on a

Schwinn.  We follow as he pedals his way to...

TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL

A three story building.  Older, brick, sturdy.  Meticulously

maintained.

EXT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

A JANITOR raises the American flag.  It flaps proudly as the

teenager chains his bike to a bike rack.

He glances up at the flag, which is reflected in his uber-hip

sunglasses.  When he smiles, in SLOW MO, his teeth seem to

sparkle.

We SWISH PAN to another teenager, locking his bike.  Meet our

much less glamorous hero:  TED NELSON, 17.  A decent looking

kid.  Not hip enough to be cool.  Not square enough to be

tormented. He joins the other KIDS heading into the school.

INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

CHRISTY MALONE, 17, fills her cheerleader uniform in all the

right places. We watch her at her locker. Also in SLOW MO.

Which makes even her most mundane task seem graceful. Wow,

just look at her stack those books.

Christy glances off screen and SQUEALS excitedly.  Another

cheerleader enters the frame, holding a newspaper called

"EXPOSED!"  Christy reads the headline.

Christy calls to Ted....

She shows him "Exposed!" Ted gawks. Happy just to be this

close to Christy. But they are quickly interrupted by...

PRINCIPAL RICHARD MERKIN, mid-50's, marches down the hallway,

seizing copies of "EXPOSED!" from students' hands. We can see

that it is a "homemade" looking newspaper. And there's

obviously much ado about it.  Christy winks at Ted as she

hides the newspaper in her locker.

FREEZE FRAME ON Christy, WINKING.

INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSROOM - DAY

Ted ambles toward Christy. Struggling for nonchalance.  She

limbers up by stretching her leg high against the wall. She

whispers to another CHEERLEADER.  They giggle.  Then Christy

turns to Ted.  Flashing that perfect smile of hers.

Ted wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans...

Christy continues stretching.  Driving Ted crazy with her

contortionist moves.

She looks up at him with gorgeous blue eyes. Then blurts...

Christy joyously jumps into Ted's arms.  Wrapping her legs

around him in a passionate embrace.  The entire room

APPLAUDS.

And just as she's about to plant one right on his lips...

INT. TED'S OFFICE - NEWSROOM - DAY

The shrill ringing of a TORNADO DRILL ALARM snaps Ted out of

his reverie. A large glass window separates Ted's EDITOR-IN

CHIEF office from the rest of the school newsroom.  We

realize now that Ted has only been gazing through the window

at Christy, watching her stretch those gorgeous limbs of

hers.

He follows the other students to...

INT. CORRIDOR - TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Ted joins his schoolmates, lining up on both sides of the

hallway.  Far from any windows. They all know the drill.

Christy's just across the hall from Ted.  He can't take his

eyes off of her.

CHARLIE DUKE, 17, approaches Ted.  He's got a camera around

his neck and so much confidence, it's a wonder he can balance

his head on his shoulders.

FREEZE FRAME ON CHARLIE.

INT. BASKETBALL COURT - TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Charlie kneels by the sidelines.  Shooting cheerleaders with

his Nikon and an obscenely long lens.

THROUGH CHARLIE'S LENS:

A cheerleader's ripe buttocks, peeking out from beneath a

short pleated skirt.  As she kicks and jumps, her little red

panties wedge themselves firmly between her cheeks. The

camera skillfully tracks her movements, waiting until...

The cheerleader's hand comes down.  In SLOW MO, her finger

slips under her panties and tugs on the fabric, pulling it

over her cheeks.  Charlie's motor drive whirls.

RAPID STILL SHOTS OF THE CHEERLEADER'S BOTTOM

BACK TO CORRIDOR

Ted and Charlie lean against the wall.

Christy catches Ted's eye and smiles a perfect smile.

Charlie secretly shows Ted a nudie magazine. "HEAVEN." A

GORGEOUS WOMAN with perfect breasts graces the cover. A

golden halo over her head.  Charlie flips it open.  Points to

a picture.

Ted takes a peek at Ginger.  Then at Christy.

Ted grabs the magazine and flips through more pages.

Beautiful, naked women.  Palm trees. Blue skies. Bubbling

Jacuzzis. Red Ferraris. The stuff that fantasies are made of.

Ted looks determined...

Charlie can see the look in Ted's eyes.  He's about to do

something bold and daring. Something he'll regret.

Ted starts to walk across the corridor, ignoring Charlie...

A quietly attractive teenaged girl, JULIE CONROY, watches

Ted. She seems concerned, too.

FREEZE FRAME ON JULIE.

INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Teachers mill around.  Chatting. Snacking on donuts, coffee.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN bursts in, spilling a stack of "EXPOSED!"

onto a table. Everyone freezes.

The teachers turn to MISS PRATT.  We recognize her from the

cover of "EXPOSED!"

Suddenly, an AIR VENT pops open and CRASHES on top of a

coffee machine.  THE WHOLE ROOM, IN SHOCKED SILENCE, turns to

look at...

JULIE, her head framed by the air duct.  She holds a digital

camera in her hand. Her expression says: "Oh, shit."

Principal Merkin narrows his eyes at the "little bastard" who

has been making his life hell.

INT. TED'S OFFICE - NEWSROOM - DAY

Julie sits in a chair in front of Ted's desk. She and Ted

size up one another.

Julie leans back on the chair, rests her feet on Ted's files,

and blows a huge bubble.

Julie deadpans...

Ted's eyes wander to Christy, who prances around the

newsroom.  Julie notices.

BACK TO CORRIDOR

Ted nears Christy.  Students stare as he passes.  They elbow

one another.  Whispering.

Ted seems unaware that all eyes are upon him.  The cacophony

of the corridor settles.  He gets down on one knee in front

of Christy.

Christy looks down on Ted.  Smiles that smile.  Which freezes

as her eyes dart.  Realizing that everyone is staring at them

with great anticipation.

The corridor explodes with LAUGHTER.  Ted flushes with

embarrassment.  Christy looks mortified.

Christy laughs derisively.

Christy flees. Leaving Ted kneeling there. Alone. Unless you

count the hoards of STUDENTS who are watching and LAUGHING

HYSTERICALLY.

Julie approaches.  Gives him a hand.  Helps him up.

INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Ted pukes in the sink.

Ted lifts his head.  Looks in the mirror.  Distraught.

INT. THE NELSON KITCHEN - EVENING

Not a hair above middle class. Home sweet home nonetheless.

Dinner in progress. MOM, DAD, Ted, younger brother, JIMMY. A

mutt named CORKY curled under the table. A storm brews.

Lightning in the distance. Thunder RUMBLES.

Ted's Mom observes her son with unmistakable Mom-radar. She

slides a slab of - rotten timing! - MEAT LOAF onto his plate

with an unpleasant thud. Ted shudders...

Ted's Mom frowns. Jimmy explains matter-of-factly.

Ted's parents look at one another, shake their heads. His Dad

gently explains...

Jimmy tries to stifle a grin.

Ted charges for the front door...

EXT. NELSON HOUSE - EVENING

Ted bursts outside and plows straight into MARTY ZUKERMAN, a

short, rotund man in his mid-50s.

Zukerman's briefcase and papers are knocked to the ground.

Ted helps to retrieve them.

Ted starts to back away. Instinctively knowing the bad news

must be for him.

Ted stops. Puzzled.

INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Ted sits on the couch, bewildered. Dad beside him. Mom pours

coffee in her best china.  Zukerman regards a wall of family

photos as he takes a sip.

Ted's parents look worried. Mom reminds Dad...

Lightning strikes again.  Thunder rumbles a second later.

The lights flicker. And it's PITCH BLACK.

INT. TED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Candles light the dark room. Rain pours hard outside.

Journalism mementos all over Ted's walls. News clippings.

Magazine covers. There's even a faux Pulitzer, a Christmas

gift from his parents.

Ted's Dad sits on the edge of his bed.

Dad chuckles, but Ted's still moping.

...if they're dead.

Ted's Dad hugs him briefly, laughing...

EXT. LAX - DAY

A 747 lands screaming on the runway.

INT. LAX - DAY

Ted and Charlie exit the plane. They walk tentatively through

the sleeve towards the entry gate.

Ted gives him a look.

Charlie's words echo loudly through the sleeve...

People stare at Ted as they pass.

INT. LAX - TERMINAL - DAY

Ted and Charlie enter the terminal.  Friends and family wait

for loved ones.  A few chauffeurs hold signs with names.  One

stands out.  Tall. Blonde. Gorgeous. In a short skirt. A

matching low cut jacket.  And a cap.  She's stunning.  And

she's holding a sign that reads: TED NELSON.

They grin at one another. Then approach the Chauffeur.

With a sad look, the Chauffeur hugs him, kissing one cheek,

then the other.

Ted's stunned. Charlie leans in and whispers.

INT. STRETCH LIMO - DAY

Ted and Charlie sit on opposites ends of the plush interior.

Charlie eyes the control console with its slew of gadgets.

They practically have to shout to hear one another.

Charlie continues playing with the console switches.

Too late.  Rock music pulsates through the limo.

He flips another switch.  The bar opens.  Revealing a bottle

of Dom Perignon on ice. Charlie grins broadly.

Charlie grabs the bottle and starts to open it.

POP! The cork flies through the air.  Bounces off the

ceiling.  And hits another switch.  The sun roof glides open.

Champagne overflows from the bottle.  All over Charlie's

crotch.

Charlie grabs a bar towel as Ted looks toward the sun roof.

Beautifully blue Southern California sky greets him.  With an

occasional palm tree swooshing by.  Ted rises.

EXT. LIMO - DAY - MOVING

Ted's head peeks out of the sun roof. Tentatively. Unsure. He

takes in the sights as the limo cruises Sunset Boulevard.

People stare at him. A beautiful BLONDE smiles and waves. He

waves back, very timidly.

Charlie sticks his head out, too. Sun on their faces. Wind in

their hair.

EXT. ENTRY GATE - DAY

The limo passes through the ornate gate of what could only be

a sprawling mansion. It comes to a sudden halt. The door

swings open to reveal a group of BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMEN. Clad

in very short black dresses and even some black bikinis.  Sad

expressions on their faces.

EXT. LIMO - DAY

The MOURNERS embrace Ted.

EXT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - DAY

The beautiful young women guide Ted towards the mansion.

Charlie follows. A particularly VOLUPTUOUS BEAUTY eyes him

curiously.

The voluptuous beauty notices Charlie's soaked crotch. He

winks...

Just then, the spry HELEN McDOLE, 60s, emerges from the

mansion.  She approaches Ted and hugs him.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Ted takes a seat at the spacious conference table.  Helen

sits on his right. Charlie sits on his left.

Zukerman and two other IMPATIENT ATTORNEYS wait at the head

of the table.  Finally Zukerman checks his watch and rises.

They all watch a WALL CLOCK. Seconds pass, slowly, slowly.

Then suddenly Zukerman rises.

Very dramatically, Zukerman slides a copy of "Heaven"

magazine down the conference table. Right to Ted.

Ted's stunned, speechless. Charlie gawks.

Zukerman presses a remote control.  A wall panel slides open

to reveal a large monitor which springs to life.  On the

screen is a striking couple.  Ted'S BIOLOGICAL PARENTS.

HEATHER and TOM DEEDS. Heather, stunningly sexy and

overflowing from her gold sequined halter top. Tom, very

handsome in a Vegas showman sort of way.

Ted looks guilty. This is too weird.

Heather holds up the first issue of "Heaven." She's on the

cover, wearing nothing but a halo. She looks almost exactly

the same today, with a few extra nips and tucks.

Heather leans forward and blows a kiss into the camera. Her

strongest assets spilling forward.

Charlie's practically slobbering. He elbows Ted.

At that moment, the doors burst open. WILLIAM G. DEEDS (UNCLE

BILLY) sails into the room.  Handsome in an unconventional

way, he exudes passion and eccentricity.

Uncle Billy hugs Ted with great enthusiasm.

Ted waits. Swept up by Uncle Billy's spirit.

Uncle Billy grins broadly.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Uncle Billy leads Ted and Charlie through the cavernous room.

Sexy, semi-clad oil paintings of Ted's biological mother

adorn the walls.

Uncle Billy winks at Ted.

Charlie takes a deep breath. Uncle Billy and Ted share a

conspiratorial smirk.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GAME ROOM - DAY

The epitome of every boy's dream arcade.  Everything from

classic pinball machines to the most high tech virtual

reality game that has yet to hit the market.  Charlie shakes

his head in amazement.

Charlie continues to gawk. Ted's equally impressed but

holding it together.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - SWIMMING ROOM - DAY

Uncle Billy leads Ted and Charlie by the indoor pool which is

decorated like a tropical pond, complete with exotic

vegetation, lava rocks, and a waterfall.  They pass through a

cave-like entrance and find themselves...

EXT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

...coming out by another spectacular waterfall. Which

separates the indoor and outdoor pools. Numerous BEAUTIFUL

WOMEN swim, chat, play water polo. Some topless, some might

as well be.  The boys watch in awe as one woman rubs lotion

on another woman's back.

The women wave, ad-libbing warm greetings. Charlie leans

towards Ted, confiding...

"His father." The words sound so strange. He never even met

the guy.

Ted gulps. It's hard to believe this is real.

Ted looks.  A beautiful woman sensuously rubs tanning lotion

over her OWN breasts.  The boys stare, riveted.

Ted elbows Charlie out of his fantasy.

He means dead.

INT.  THE NELSON HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mom waits nervously for the phone to ring.

Dad hurries out of the bathroom, hiking up his pajamas. Mom

speaks loudly, as if Ted's in Siberia.

INT. TED'S BEDROOM - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT

A palatial suite. Very Louis XIV.  Ted throws a sheet over a

nude sculpture of his biological mother. While holding a

cordless phone in the crook of his neck.

Mom hands Dad the phone.

Suddenly, Charlie bursts into the room with a pair of

binoculars.

INT. TED'S BEDROOM - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT

Charlie flips off the light switch and whispers...

Charlie shoves the binoculars at Ted and guides him toward

the window which overlooks the outdoor pool.

TED'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS

A devastatingly PERFECT WOMAN, GINGER, "Miss April,"  emerges

from the pool, wearing nothing but a g-string. Her skin

shimmers from the reflection of the pool lights. Rivulets of

water stream down her body.  She reaches for a towel and pats

her body dry. An incredible aura seems to surround her.

Separating her from the other spectacular beauties we've seen

already.

Ted lowers the binoculars. Entranced.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Ted and Charlie move like thieves in the night.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ted and Charlie enter.  Flip the light switch.  It was his

parents' very opulent bedroom. Complete with more risque

paintings of Ted's biological mother.

Charlie pulls open a dresser drawer filled with Ted's

mother's lingerie.

Charlie caresses a pair of red silk panties and inhales their

powdery fragrance.

Ted grabs the panties just as Charlie pulls away, ripping

them in half. Just then the door opens to reveal a very

proper ENGLISH BUTLER.

Ted and Charlie awkwardly hide the panty halves behind their

backs.

The Butler leaves.  Ted glares at Charlie. Who shrugs.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GARAGE - THE NEXT MORNING

The garage is crowded with two dozen sporty classics. Ted

runs his hands over the hood of a red Ferrari 575M Maranello.

He pulls the door open and slides into the leather seat.

Ted turns around and spots Ginger, the goddess from the pool,

making her way towards him.  He gulps.

Ted glances down. There they are. She hops in next to him.

He doesn't know what to do.

Ted blushes. He needs a lot of lessons.

The Ferrari growls to life. Ginger places her hand over

Ted's.

Ginger moves her slender fingers on his knees. Showing him

how it's done.

She squeezes his thigh and winks.

EXT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GARAGE - DAY

The Ferrari jerks out of the garage and promptly stalls.

Ginger giggles.  Could Ted be MORE embarrassed?

Ted feels his temperature rising. He changes the subject.

Ginger blushes.

Ginger GIGGLES. Ted tries to hide behind his less than cool

shades. Ginger notices.

He puts the car in gear.  The tires scream as they take off.

Gears grind as he shifts. Not exactly purring with ecstasy.

Yet.

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

The Ferrari negotiates its way along Rodeo Drive. Ted seems

to have gotten the hang of it.

Tourists stare.  One snaps a photo.

Ted pulls up to...and then over...the curb. Well, he almost

has the hang of it.

INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

Ted emerges from a dressing room.  Slowly starting to lose

his boy-from-Xenia taint.  He glances at the price tag,

dangling from his sleeve.  His eyes widen. Ginger strokes his

arm. Whispers seductively in his ear.

Ted listens. Trying to learn.

INT. A CHIC EYEWEAR BOUTIQUE - DAY

Ted tries on some snazzy sunglasses.  Ginger approves.  Ted

still checks the price tag.

Ginger looks into his eyes. As if she can see his soul.

Ted's not sure how to respond. He smiles awkwardly.

The hamburger life. Now he can defy it.

Ted slides on the shades. Slowly, purposefully. He grins at

the SALES CLERK...

INT. "HEAVEN" HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Ted, Charlie, Helen, and Uncle Billy walk past GRAPHIC

DESIGNERS in cubicles as Helen leads a tour of the "Heaven"

magazine offices. As they pass each cubicle, HEADS pop up to

check them out.

"HEAVEN" WAR ROOM

POLAROIDS OF NAKED WOMEN cover every square inch of wall

space.  Ted and Charlie gawk.  Who can blame them?

Ted focuses on one particular picture. He removes the push

pin that holds it to the wall.

We can see the concerned look on Helen's face. Does this kid

have any taste at all?

She shows Uncle Billy.

Uncle Billy nods. He explains gently...

Ted looks at the walls again. Carefully. He has a knack for

this. He hands a picture to Helen. She turns to Uncle Billy

and smiles.

His father. He just can't get used to that. Who was this guy?

INT. MASTER BEDROOM CLOSET - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT

Ted looks at the impressive collection of suits. Runs his

hands along the fabrics. Picks a particularly stylish jacket

and tries it on. It fits poorly. Too big in the chest and

shoulders. Ted looks at himself in the full-length mirror.

He's not half the man his father was.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK on the door. Ted quickly takes off

his father's jacket and puts on his own. He lets Uncle Billy

in.  LOUD PARTY SOUNDS momentarily pour into the room.

Ted's struggling with a silk tie. Uncle Billy helps him.

Ted wipes his palms on his slacks. Confiding...

Ted chuckles. Uncle Billy's calming him...

Uncle Billy rubs his shoulders. As if pep-talking him for a

big fight.

Uncle Billy swings the door open to reveal. KIKI and KELLY.

Tall, beautiful, leggy IDENTICAL TWINS.  They smile warmly at

Ted, each offering an arm.  Ted holds his head high. Like the

Sovereign of Sexuality.

LONG DRAMATIC STAIRCASE

With the twins on either side of him, Ted struts down the

stairs and into a sea of people.  All so eager to meet him.

Ted acts as if he's been doing this all his life.

And instantly, he's surrounded.  People shake his hands.

Women kiss his cheeks.  Athletes, movie stars, models.

Charlie watches, beaming proudly.

DANCE FLOOR - LATER

Charlie thinks he's Travolta. Dressed for disco. Twirling a

Super Model. Ted dances among a dozen BEAUTIES.  They steal

kisses and hugs, here and there. A thousand Cinderellas, all

after one Prince Charming.  Ted's having the time of his

life. Charlie dances up to him. Shouting in his ear...

They high-five one another. An EXOTIC BEAUTY grabs Ted and

starts dirty dancing. Rubbing herself against him.  Ted's

clueless. So he improvises.  People cheer him on.  He thrusts

his pelvis. Feigns various sex acts. Hilarious, goofy, but it

works.

EXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT

The party's over.  Ted relaxes in the Jacuzzi, sipping

champagne. Thrilled, elated, blasted.  Uncle Billy sits

across from him.  Two MASSEUSES tenderize their shoulders.

But as the scene continues the women take an even greater

interest in each other. Stealing a kiss here. A touch there.

Ted attention is distracted as he chats with Uncle Billy.

The Masseuses help Uncle Billy out of the Jacuzzi. They say

their goodnights and Ted closes his eyes. When he opens them,

Ginger stands at the edge of the tub.

Ted can barely nod. She unzips the back of her dress and lets

it fall to her feet.  The silhouette of her nude body is

startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. Ted watches as she

descends, step by step, into the frothy water.

Ted's paralyzed with desire and fear. Ginger descends deeper.

A wash of foam caresses her breasts.  She continues.  Until

she's completely submerged.

Ted looks startled.  The "Jaws" theme echoes through his

ears.  He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels

something.  Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him.

He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's

sucked under.  He thrashes.  His hand grabs the edge of the

Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out.  And he slides under. Only

to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips.

Kissing him passionately.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - TED'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Ted and Ginger in bed.  Morning rays, satin sheets, what a

night.  Ted awakens.  He stares at Ginger in awe, remembering

what happened. Smiles big.

Ted slides out of bed.  Catches his reflection in the mirror.

Takes a good look at himself.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

Press Conference. Lights, cameras, reporters, bedlam. Uncle

Billy, Helen, and Ted sit at a makeshift dais.

Ted prepares to speak. A little nervous from the spotlights,

but hell, he's a man now. Uncle Billy gives him a reassuring

look.

He glances at Uncle Billy, who urges him to tell more.

CHUCKLES from the crowd. Uncle Billy gives him a "thumb's up"

sign.

INT. CHRISTY MALONE'S BATHROOM - SAME

In the middle of waxing her bikini line, Christy jumps up and

down excitedly.

INT. JULIE CONROY'S BEDROOM - SAME

Julie watches TV. Stunned.

INT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S DEN - SAME

Principal Merkin watches TV. Simmering.

INT. NELSON FAMILY ROOM - SAME

Ted's parents and little Jimmy stare in amazement at their

old-fashioned console RCA.  A geeky high school picture of

Ted appears on screen, as a REPORTER babbles...

Jimmy turns to his parents.

The door bell CHIMES. Mom and Dad look at each other. This

can't be good.

EXT. NELSON HOUSE - DAY

Jimmy squeezes past Dad and jumps on the bike as Mom appears

in the doorway.

At that moment, ANOTHER DELIVERY MAN and his HELPER unload a

large crate from another truck. They approach Dad and Mom.

Dad approaches the crate as the Delivery Man opens it to

reveal a large scarlet and gray case of tools.  Dad opens one

of the drawers.  Runs his fingers over the shiny instruments.

Tears in his eyes.

Another delivery truck arrives.  Then the local news vans.

Neighbors rush out of their houses. The phone RINGS.  Mom

dashes inside.

INT. THE NELSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Mom grabs the phone.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - TED'S ROOM - DAY

Ted wears a cordless headset phone, as if he was born with

it. As he talks, he flexes his muscles in front of a full

length mirror.

Mom looks up as ANOTHER DELIVERY MAN wheels a washing machine

and dryer into the house.

Mom's eyes light up.

EXT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

A beautiful spring morning.  Cars pull into the school

parking lot.  Students mingle in small groups. Making their

way into the building.  A group of GUYS look up.

Suddenly, a helicopter swooshes through the air, circling the

school as if to get everyone's attention, then landing on a

grassy knoll. The helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a

pattern of white billowy clouds.

The door slides open and out hops Ted. In SLOW-MO. Looking

seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his

stylish Persol shades.  Until he takes a second step and

stumbles slightly, catching himself from falling face first

into the grass.

Charlie is right behind him. Looking great, too, but vaguely

Mafioso in his efforts to be hip. He turns to the beautiful

blonde PILOT and plants a big wet kiss for everyone to see.

Ted and Charlie strut towards the school as Principal Merkin

bursts through the front doors, shouting...

Ted raises his hand.  The chopper rises as if on cue.

Without a word, Ted and Charlie pass the ruffled Principal

Merkin and strut toward the entrance. Classmates surround

Ted.  Congratulating him.  Everyone wanting to be Ted's new

best friend.  Julie walks up to Charlie.

Ted makes eye contact with Julie. Winking like he's Don Juan.

She just stares at him, blankly.

Charlie's baffled by that one.

Julie groans.

INT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Principal Merkin paces dramatically...

Principal Merkin opens his desk drawer sheepishly. Caresses

the watch. It kills him to return it.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

Flurry of activity. Ted on his cell phone. Julie types

furiously. Taking her job very seriously. Christy Malone

props one leg against the wall. Demonstrating those

contortionist warm-up moves that drove Ted mad with desire.

Christy pouts. Wishing she never said the "F" word. Julie

snickers. Ted takes Julie's arm and guides her to a private

spot in the corner.

Julie snaps her fingers, as if trying to remember...

Ted fumes. She really knows how to push his buttons.

INT. NELSON DINING ROOM - DAY

A world class CHEF and his SOUS CHEF serve the Nelson's a

filet mignon dinner. Mom, Dad, Jimmy, Ted, and Julie, sit at

the table. Set with the finest china. The most elegant

linens. A fresh floral arrangement. The best of everything.

Everyone waits for Mom as she takes her first bite.

The rest of them dig in.

Jimmy's eyes widen as he chews.

The chef turns to Julie...

And finally, the Chef waits for Ted...

The Chef wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. Approval, at

last, from the only opinion that mattered.

Julie listens closely, admiring Ted's parents.

Ted's frustration mounts.

Dad looks at Mom. Forget the store. That stings.

Disappointed, disgusted, Ted looks to Julie for support.

Tears fill her eyes. Mom and Dad moved her. Ted shrugs and

digs into his food.

EXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY

A heavenly blue jet with billowy white clouds soars through

the sky.

INT. THE "HEAVEN" JET - DAY

Beyond first class; the ultimate in posh. Charlie sweet-talks

a sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

The Flight Attendant pulls him toward the washroom, quickly.

Julie interviews Ted, complete with tape recorder.

Another FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches...

Julie raises her eyebrows. Taking notes.

Ted loves her spunk. And the chemistry between them.

Julie snickers.

INT. GREEN ROOM - DAY

Ted waits for his appearance on "The Tonight Show."  Ginger

smooths out the imaginary creases in Ted's Armani jacket.

Julie rolls her eyes. Here we go again.  Uncle Billy and

Helen look on approvingly.

Ted fake-guffaws. Charlie is quickly distracted by the relish

tray.

And she dashes out the door.  Ted leans towards Julie, who

quietly observes everything.

Julie shrugs. Isn't it obvious?

Ginger returns with a rose.

Julie gives Ted a look. See what I mean.

INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW SET - DAY

Jay Leno seems charmed.  Ted behaves as if he does this every

day. The rose from Ginger is pinned to his lapel.

Audience LAUGHS.

Ted's so smooth. We know it's still HIM under all that

Armani, but it sure does make him LOOK different.

OFF IN THE WINGS

Julie looks thoroughly disgusted.

BACK TO STAGE

INT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S KITCHEN - MORNING

A Cocker Spaniel, POOCHIE, sits under a breakfast table,

holding a newspaper in his snout.

MRS. MERKIN, dressed in a bathrobe and curlers, prepares

breakfast.  Their beautiful college-aged daughter, JUDY, eats

cereal at the table, while flipping through a glamour

magazine. Principal Merkin enters. Ready for work. Wife and

daughter don't even look up.

Principal Merkin pretends to look for the dog in the

cupboard. This is obviously a daily ritual.

He looks under the table.

The dog leaps into his arms.  Principal Merkin grabs the

paper as Poochie starts to lick his face.

Principal Merkin places the dog on the ground, takes a seat,

and bites into a breakfast sausage.  He opens the paper and

is confronted by a full page ad.

CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER AD

"GIRLS OF XENIA, GO STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN!"  Details follow.

How, when, where to apply.

BACK TO PRINCIPAL MERKIN

Who chokes on his sausage. Clutches his throat. Signaling to

his wife and daughter. "Help me!" Judy looks up, grossed out.

Mrs. Merkin attempts the Heimlich Maneuver. Rather ineptly.

Principal Merkin turns red, blue, purple. Finally the piece

of sausage flies out of his mouth, past Judy. Poochie catches

it in mid-flight.

INT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S HONDA CIVIC - MOVING - DAY

Principal Merkin drives to work, humming along to Liza

Minelli's "New York, New York." The song comes to an end and

a radio spot begins...

Principal Merkin tries to change the station. But the ad

seems to be on every station...

INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

Students hover at the bulletin board, reading a poster

advertising the "Heaven" auditions.  Principal Merkin pushes

through the crowd and tears the poster off the board.

Completely incensed.

INT. CITY COUNCIL HALL - EVENING

Hundreds of Xenia CITIZENS have gathered for this meeting.

Principal Merkin stands in front of the five members of the

city council who sit at a U-shaped table.  He holds up

"Heaven" magazine. Preaching with an evangelical passion...

His supporters murmur agreement.

His POSSE of supporters APPLAUD. His opponents GROAN. Ted

slouches nearby.  A lawyer next to him.  The MAYOR bangs the

gavel and the commotion settles.

Principal Merkin takes his seat. Ted rises. Playing the big

shot lawyer. Julie sits in the crowd, taking notes.

A bit of an UPROAR from the crowd. WOMEN eye their HUSBANDS

suspiciously. Julie makes a point...

MR. NEEDLEMAN, another angry man from Principal Merkin's

posse, jumps on the bandwagon.

Helen motions to Ted. He quickly locates a page in the report

she prepared for him. He handles this like a pro...

Mr. Needleman dissolves into his seat. Half the men in the

audience seem to evaporate.

The room is suddenly SILENT. Principal Merkin gives the Mayor

a hard look.  Merkin's face contorts in SLOW MO as he

proclaims...

INT. CITY BUILDING CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Holding a stack of flyers, Charlie chats with Judy, Merkin's

college-aged daughter.

Judy smiles fetchingly. Stashing Charlie's "Heaven" flyer in

her backpack. Her father suddenly appears.

He grabs her arm while knocking the stack of flyers out of

Charlie's hands.  As Principal Merkin drags her away, Judy

smiles back at Charlie.  He winks.

The stack of flyers FLOATS over the railing and onto the

ground floor, just as a group of LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN enters

the building lobby. They excitedly reach for the flyers.

EXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - XENIA - DAY

A line of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - all shapes and sizes - snakes

around the block and into a doorway.  The women are dressed

to impress, in very skimpy clothing. Ted pulls up in his

convertible Ferrari. The women shout greetings as Ted heads

for the door.

INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY

We follow Ted as he dashes up the stairs, along the line of

women, towards an office.

Charlie looks frazzled.

They enter...

INT. TED'S OFFICE - DAY

A YOUNG WOMAN sits with her back to the door.

The woman turns towards Ted, revealing herself to be Christy

Malone.  Ted is momentarily stunned.

Ted doesn't know what to say. Charlie's equally stunned.

Hell, it seems, has frozen over.

INT. TED'S BEDROOM - DAY

Highly modified since the last time we saw it. A large flat

screen hangs on the wall.   A high tech computer system for

video conferences dominates the room.  Ted speaks with Uncle

Billy and Helen.

Dad passes the partially open door. Overhearing. He stops.

Suddenly Ted feels his dad's presence, behind him.

Ted takes the list.  Gives it a cursory glance. Nods to his

dad, as if dismissing him.

Ted laughs. Completely ignoring his dad. Who backs out of the

room. Unnoticed. Neglected. Hurt.

EXT. THE NELSON HOUSE - DAY

Mom drives up to the house.  She stares, aghast.

There are tall, beautiful, ANGELS everywhere.  One cuts the

grass.  Another pulls weeds. Two others on the roof, cleaning

gutters.

Still others wash the car...with Jimmy handling the water

hose. Drenching the women, more than the car. Shrieks and

giggles all around. Neighbors gawk.

Ted's dad guiltily enjoys the view, but quickly rushes to his

wife. She gets out of her car and steadies herself on his

arm.

INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ted stands on an ottoman as a TAILOR fits him for a prom

tuxedo. He towers over his parents who try to talk to him. We

feel for them. They've lost control of their kid.

Ted looks down at them, literally.

Mom gives Dad a look. Stick to the script. Don't be swayed by

presents.

Dad glances at Mom, hesitant.  She nods, giving him the

courage to continue.

Ted laughs.

Mom and Dad look stricken. Ted doesn't know when to stop...

Ted storms away, unintentionally CRASHING into a TREASURED

FAMILY PHOTO on the end table. The frame shatters into

smithereens. Breaking Mom and Dad's hearts. STUNNED SILENCE

hangs heavy in the room.

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Prom night.  Couples slow dance to a Marilyn Manson clone,

singing a rock version of "Precious and Few."

Principal Merkin watches on the sidelines.  Surprisingly

calm. Suspiciously happy.

Ted caresses Ginger's bare back as they dance together. His

head nestled against her breasts. Not a care in the world.

He spots Charlie on the dance floor. Making out with one of

his dates, the IDENTICAL TAYLOR TRIPLETS, while the other two

patiently wait their turn.

WE notice Christy Malone dancing with her FOOTBALL CAPTAIN

DATE. The perfect male specimen. Christy gives Ted a

disappointed, longing gaze. But he's oblivious.

Suddenly a FLASH blinds them. It's Julie Conroy, doing her

job.  Following her subject.

Julie flashes the camera again. Capturing Ginger's panicked

expression. We notice that Julie looks alluring in a deep

purple strapless gown. Not so glamorous as Ginger, but far

more appealing and natural.

Ginger seems testy and jealous. Her true colors emerging.

Suddenly the music dies.  Everyone turns to the stage where

Principal Merkin stands proudly. Holding a power cord.

A spotlight suddenly finds Ted and Charlie's beautiful dates.

The crowd boos, hisses.

Charlie steps in like a hostage negotiator.

Ted realizes his high school reputation is at stake. He steps

up on stage. Approaches Principal Merkin. Takes out his

wallet.

The crowd CHEERS.

Principal Merkin trembles from the sheer temptation of it.

Yet he could never succumb in front of so many witnesses. He

has to maintain his dignity...

From nowhere, a flock of beefy SECURITY GUARDS emerge to

remove Ted & Co.

The Marilyn Manson clone is rapidly whisked away, and

replaced by six GEEZERS in powder blue tuxedoes.

As Security Guards carry them away...

As they reach the doors...

Ginger storms away in an angry huff.

Ted experiences a moment of loss.

Ted grins broadly. He turns and SHOUTS to his classmates...

Responses are mixed. Some cheer, some are undecided. Until

the new band starts playing, "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the

Old Oak Tree." And EVERYONE RUSHES for the exit, following

Ted.

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

A muzak version of "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak

Tree," continues.  A PIZZA DELIVERY GUY watches the numbers

rise to the penthouse.  Suddenly the doors open to reveal...

INT. HOTEL PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

All four penthouse suites have been rented by Ted.  It's

party central. Very wild.  Quickly growing out of control.

Kids dance, play drinking games, Spin the Bottle, and

generally trash the place.

The pizza delivery guy wheels a dolly with a huge stack of

pizzas into the party, only to be attacked by the prom-goers

like starving beasts. Grabbing the pizzas.  Devouring them

hungrily.

TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE

Ted, Charlie, the Taylor Triplets and several buddies lounge

around, drunkenly watching THE HOME SHOPPING CHANNEL on Ted's

big screen TV.  A tacky CERAMIC GNOME rotates on the screen.

Ted swigs Dom Perignon straight from the bottle. He shouts

orders into his cell phone...

CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Ted looks up as the elevator doors open.  Principal Merkin

has arrived. Ted confronts him...

Suddenly the whole XENIA POLICE FORCE appears, in full riot

gear.  The party's over.  Everyone runs for the stairs.  Ted

gives Principal Merkin a spiteful look and joins the mass

exodus.

EXT. HOLIDAY INN - NIGHT

Drunken teenagers pour out of the building.  Dashing for

their cars and limos.  Ted's among them.  Suddenly he's cut

off by a Harley that stops right in front of him.  It's

Julie.  Still in her purple strapless prom dress. With a

black motorcycle jacket over it.

Ted jumps on, wrapping his arms around her waist. Julie takes

off.

EXT. STREETS OF XENIA - CONTINUOUS

Julie maneuvers the nighttime streets of Xenia, taking off

down a country road.

EXT. JULIE'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Now we understand. Julie's family comes from major bucks. The

yard is massive. And resting in a sprawling oak tree is the

best hiding place in the world.

INT. JULIE'S TREE HOUSE - NIGHT

A cozy oasis. Books everywhere.  A whole series of

flashlights hang upside down like lanterns. Giving the tree

house a warm glow.

Julie's eyes narrow. She should have known.

He's right, but...

Julie groans.

INT. OLD FOLK'S HOME - NIGHT

Dressed in a old fashioned barber costume, complete with a

handle bar mustache, Principal Merkin sings as part of a

BARBER SHOP QUARTET. The senior citizens clap

enthusiastically.

Ted and Julie peek through a crack in the doorway.

Disappointment on their faces.

INT. SOUP KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

Principal Merkin pours soup into the bowl of a shabbily

dressed HOMELESS MAN. Julie shoots Ted an "I told you so"

look.

EXT. HIGHWAY - SATURDAY AFTERNOON

Principal Merkin supervises a crew of kindergarten CHILDREN,

cleaning up the roadside litter. Julie and Ted watch from...

A BRIDGE ABOVE THE HIGHWAY

Ted steels himself. Somehow, they'll get him.

EXT. XENIA - WATER TOWER - DAY

In the golden light of sunset, MOLLY, a stunning "Xenia

Girl," stands on the stairs that curve up around a huge water

tower that overlooks the city.  Her loose spring dress

billows in the wind. Held on by only one button. Exposing in

quick glimpses that she isn't wearing a bra.

An ASSISTANT holds a portable strobe, attached to a

reflector.  Charlie shoots with his Nikon.  Motor drive

whirling.

Molly grins. Then unbuttons. We hear a round of "oohs" from

below.  Ted glances down, where...

Hundreds of binoculars, cameras, and camcorders are poised on

the scene.  Men of all ages are milling around, gawking,

focusing their long lenses.  Women are conspicuously absent.

Except for the gaggle of hardcore FEMINISTS with their

placards, denouncing "Heaven."

One Feminist approaches the Mayor.

The Feminist tries to respond, but a helicopter swoops

overhead, drowning out her words. The helicopter rises to the

level of the photo shoot where the door slides open.  And

just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core

fans who wanted a closer look, we find Principal Merkin

frowning as he barks through a bullhorn.

Molly flashes him. Principal Merkin averts his eyes.  Missing

the sight of Molly's dress being blown off her body by the

chopper's prop wash.  The spectators below APPLAUD.  They

watch in amazement as her dress floats down to them.

Molly gets the idea.  She poses provocatively towards

Principal Merkin, who suddenly realizes he's in a

compromising position.

But Molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him.

INT. TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - DESK AREA - THAT NIGHT

Uncle Billy chortles, his image glowing on a large flat

screen monitor that hangs on the wall.  Ted leans back in his

chair.

Uncle Billy grins proudly at Ted.

Ted knows it's not true. He looks guilty.

Uncle Billy forces a laugh.

Ted smiles at the appealing offer.

With that, he's gone. The room is completely silent. And Ted

is completely alone.

UNTIL the doorbell CHIMES.

TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

Ted opens the door. It's Jimmy, with his shiny new bike.

TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM

Jimmy seems impressed by the opulence. He takes off his bike

helmet, looks around.

Jimmy whips out a piece of paper from his pocket.

Ted signs. Jimmy squirrels away the paper, excitedly. Starts

to zip up his wind breaker.

Ouch. For the first time, that really smarts.

Ted listens.

Ted's stunned. Talk about tough love.

Suddenly the phone rings. Ted sheepishly explains...

INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

INTERCUT BETWEEN TED AND JULIE

TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

Ted hangs up the phone.  Looks around.  Jimmy's gone. But his

SHINY NEW BIKE is left behind.

INT. CINCINNATI NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Not much of a place. A middle-aged TORCH SINGER croons "MY

ROMANCE."  Ted and Julie find their way to corner table.

Keeping an eye out for Principal Merkin.

Their heads are very close together. A conspiratorial tete-a

tete.

At that moment, the TORCH SINGER begins crooning "PEOPLE."

Ted leans even closer. Looking into her eyes. Using his

voice. Being as aurally seductive as he can.

Ted moves closer.  Julie doesn't move away.  The SINGER seems

to be performing just for them.

Just as Ted and Julie are about to kiss, Julie's eyes widen.

She grabs Ted's hand. Simultaneously, they turn towards THE

SINGER...

It's the Mother Lode!  That's not just any middle-aged torch

singer. That's Principal Merkin.  Dressed in drag as Barbra

Streisand. And doing a mighty fine job of it.

Ted pulls out his camera and fires away. Blinded by the stage

lights, Principal Merkin sings and vogues glamorously. He has

no idea his secret is out.

EXT. NIGHTCLUB/CINCINNATI STREET - NIGHT

Ted and Julie rush down the street in the rain, giggling,

totally euphoric. They stop to catch their breath. Their

clothes are drenched, but they couldn't care less. In no time

they've got their arms wrapped around one another, kissing

and laughing.

Suddenly Julie sobers, pulls away.

Julie eyes him skeptically.

TREMBLING HANDS, STRUGGLING TO LOAD A ROLL OF FILM INTO A

NIKON.

INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Ted closes the back of his camera. Takes a deep breath. And

forces a confident smile. He then peers into the...

SHOWER

Where Christy Malone limbers up.  Stretching her leg against

the wall. Wearing her sexy cheerleader uniform.

Christy does her warm-up contortionist poses for Ted.

Clothes still on.  As reflectors bounce strobes into the

shower area.

Years of being a merciless tease, paying off right here and

now. Christy knows how to make love to the camera.

Christy giggles.

Ted slowly unzips Christy's top, catching a glimpse of her

long, sensuous back. She resumes posing. Flashing a bare

shoulder.  A coy look. She doesn't need direction. She's a

natural.

Christy slips off her cheerleader top. Lowers her skirt.

Flings it aside. She's wearing only panties the size of a

Band-aid. Ted is mute. Staring at her perfect body.

Ted steps out of the shower.  Out of Christy's sight, he

squirms in his jeans. Trying to hide his enthusiasm.

MUSIC suddenly seems to come from nowhere. Nine Inch Nails.

"I Want to Fuck You Like An Animal."

Ted steps back into the shower.  Christy rubs an ice cube on

her left nipple.

She tosses him the ice cube. He fumbles. It lands on the

floor.

Ted looks through the lens. We can see him trembling.  Music

blasts as Ted's camera burns through film.  They're both

getting into it.  Water pulsating over her body. Steam

rising.  Christy begins lathering her breasts.

Is he hungry. He's been working up this appetite for ten

years. He can barely contain himself.

Ted calls her bluff. He sets aside his camera. Walks right

into the water. Through the steam.  Toward Christy. She wraps

a leg around him, sucking face, wanting more.

Suddenly Ted stops. Remembering what Julie said about trust.

He turns away, but Christy presses her bare body against his

back.  Wrapping her hands around his waist. Caressing his

chest, his stomach...

Ted and Christy locked in a steamy embrace. Rolling on the

floor. Hands, arms, lips, tongues, all in motion. As the

shower drenches them.

Suddenly, they roll into a pair of legs.  Both look up.  The

steam clears to reveal Julie. Arms crossed. Hurt, but not

surprised.

She doesn't wait for an explanation. Christy covers herself.

Ted chases after Julie.

INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Julie dashes out of the girls' locker room, passing a

JANITOR.  Ted follows, dripping water.

Julie darts into the girls' restroom.  Ted stops at the door.

Then realizes there is no one else around.  He heads inside.

INT. GIRLS' RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Julie's too proud to let him see her cry. But we can tell

she's upset.

Ted corners her near a row of sinks.

Julie looks at him, pensively. She unzips the back of her

summery dress. And lets it fall to the floor. She's

completely naked and absolutely gorgeous.

Ted gasps. He's been around dozens of naked women by now, but

this one he can't just gawk at. This one he really cares

about.

She puts on her dress, gracefully. As if nothing happened.

At that moment, Ted's cell phone rings. Julie walks away,

leaving Ted completely alone. He answers, lifelessly...

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

Ted walks down the hallway.  Three JOCKS look through the new

issue of "Heaven." Laughing.  They taunt Ted.

Ted's mortified, depressed. Charlie appears next to him with

"Heaven" in hand.

Principal Merkin approaches. Also holding "Heaven" in his

hand.

Ted could not feel worse.

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Ted, Uncle Billy, and Helen. Meeting with the HEADS OF

VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS.

Ted bristles. THE KID?  The kid came up with something?

Ted can see that Uncle Billy's playing this out differently

than he imagined. Giving Ted all the "credit."

INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - TED'S OFFICE - DAY

Ted sits at his father's desk.  Going through paperwork.

Figures.  Charts. Reports. CEO work.  In the b.g., he hears

the PLAYFUL SOUNDS of women.  Which distract him.

Ted approaches the window and watches a group of girls

splashing and playing in the pool. He looks sad. Helen enters

behind him.  He turns to her.

Helen takes Ted's hand, comfortingly.

INT. MANSION ATTIC - DAY

Helen and Ted sit on old trunk. Helen holds a scrapbook in

her arms. Explaining to Ted...

CLOSE ON SCRAPBOOK

We see baby pictures of Ted, taken through the glass of a

nursery. A newspaper photo of Ted playing a donkey in a

nativity play. And clippings from Ted's high school

newspaper.

INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ted's parents and Jimmy walk through the front door. They're

stunned to find a huge 24x36 enlarged family portrait,

hanging over the mantle. It's the same picture Ted broke in

his childish tantrum. Mom and Dad are moved. Even more so

when they see Ted. Waiting for them on the couch.  Ted rises.

Misty eyed.

INT. NELSON GROCERY STORE - DAY

Dad reaches for a can of peaches from the shelf.

INT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY

A "Heaven" stockholders' meeting in progress. Uncle Billy

stands at the podium.

Behind him are charts, wall graphs. We quickly realize he is

a complete and utter turn-coat.

Ted bursts into the meeting with his Dad. Holding up a can of

peaches. Suddenly hundreds of eyes are upon him. Curious,

bewildered.

Ted dashes to the podium, with passion in his soul and fire

in his belly.

Uncle Billy steps into the shadows as Ted looks out at the

crowd. He's petrified. But he takes a deep breath and finds

the courage to explain...

Dad's eyes are filled with tears. He's never been so proud.

The stockholders are listening. Uncle Billy grins nervously.

Unable to believe Ted is pulling this off.

The stockholders APPLAUD enthusiastically, giving Ted a

standing ovation. Ted turns to Uncle Billy.

INT. "HEAVEN" HEADQUARTERS - DAY

MONTAGE

Ted looks at pictures. Layouts. Reads copy. Listens to his

staff. He seems confident. In control. Mature beyond his

years. The magazine goes to press. In VOICE OVER, we hear

Julie, reading the article about Ted that she wrote for the

school paper.

Someone hands Ted a copy of Julie's article. He reads the

last portion of it aloud...

EXT. JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

Julie opens her front door. Charlie grins. He hands her a

copy of "Heaven."

Intrigued, she turns to the page.

CLOSE ON MAGAZINE

We see a special dedication, "To Julie, My Partner in Crime,

With All the Love in the World." Julie's eyes fill with

tears. She flips ahead to "The Girls of Xenia" pictorial,

only to find--

Principal Merkin. Singing his heart out, in drag as Barbra

Streisand. It's a series of shots from the Cincinnati

nightclub. Other shots suggestively include him with Molly in

the foreground, as if they posed together.

INT. MERKIN'S HONDA CIVIC - MOVING - DAY

Principal Merkin drives. The RADIO plays in the b.g. As one

song ends, we hear the DJ say...

The voice of Barbra Streisand fills the car.

Principal Merkin pales.  He turns off the radio.  But

somehow, he can still hear the song.  As he pulls into the

school parking lot, students wave enthusiastically.  He waves

back tentatively.  Anxiety rising.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

Principal Merkin swings open his car door to be greeted by

the sound of Barbra singing her heart out through the parking

lot. Every student's car stereo blasts the song. Students

CHEER. Chanting:  "BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA!"  Principal

Merkin turns crimson.

EXT. SCHOOL STADIUM - DAY

Graduation caps fall all around. People hugging, laughing,

overjoyed. Ted searches for Julie, but she's nowhere in

sight.

INT./EXT. NELSON'S HOUSE - EVENING

A big graduation party in progress. But Ted sits in the

corner, looking sad, dejected. Julie didn't show up. He blew

it. Jimmy and Charlie approach, with cheering on their minds.

Ted turns to find Julie. His faces brightens with hope.

Julie seems pleased.

All kidding aside, he speaks from the heart...

Julie smiles...

Julie grins.

Suddenly the music changes. "People." Ted grins.

Ted and Julie begin dancing and kissing in the b.g.

Charlie and Jimmy feign tears.

And we start to RISE AGAIN, above the NELSON HOUSE, into the

clouds above Xenia...

We descend through clouds and quickly find we're...

EXT. LONDON - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

Mom and Dad take pictures and smooch in front of the palace.

ON A NEARBY NEWSSTAND

We ZOOM CLOSE on "Heaven Magazine," where pages flip open in

the wind, revealing...

PRINCIPAL MERKIN "EXPOSED" IN THE PAGES OF "HEAVEN."

INT. LONDON DRAG CLUB - NIGHT

Principal Merkin dressed as Barbra, singing "Don't Rain on My

Parade."

IN THE WINGS

Poochie, the Cocker Spaniel, watches. Wagging her tail.

STILL PHOTOGRAPHS OF...

EXT. UTAH FARM - DAY

Charlie wrestling in a haystack with the IDENTICAL TAYLOR

TRIPLETS.

Peeking out of the haystack, we spot at least a dozen CHARLIE

JR's.

INT. TELEMARKETING CUBICLE - DAY

Uncle Billy wears a phone headset. He seems to be swimming in

a sea of "Time-Life" style operators.

EXT. SAILBOAT - PACIFIC COAST - DAY

Ted and Julie sail off into, what else but a GLORIOUS SUNSET.
