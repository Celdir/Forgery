FADE IN:

INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

The room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about

eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t-

shirt. He has not quite woken up yet.

Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and

tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING

from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase.

INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

Jerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and

not much cleaner. Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and

jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can

of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else.

INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Jerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the

sink.

He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he

is not very attractive. He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and

exits the bathroom.

INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

The room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a

naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, an old

POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot

of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. Jerry tosses his

Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE

and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III.

He has pitifully few belongings. He shuts the Suitcase.

INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

The living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a

house full of bachelors. Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but

still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his

Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to

look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it.

He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with

handle until the screen door opens. He exits, letting the screen

door slam shut behind him.

TITLE CARD:

Little Athens

EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- MORNING

The old building is badly in need of a fresh paint job.   A faded

sign reading "ATHENS RESCUE SQUAD" stands in front.

INT. RESCUE SQUAD, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

The kitchen is empty except for HEATHER and ALLISON, both about

nineteen and dressed in EMS uniforms with "EMS" stitched

conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden

table. Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9" and built like a lingerie

model. Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than

Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than

Heather. Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of

her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine.

Allison has a BAGEL and a PEACH, which remain hardly touched - she

has a lot on her mind.

Having put away the last of her food, Heather lights a CIGARETTE and

stands near the open window, careful to blow the smoke out the

window.

Heather takes a drag of her Cigarette and exhales out the window.

EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

BRAD, in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder, is

standing in front of the door, waiting. MEGAN, in shorts, a t-shirt

and a baseball cap, and AMY, in a sunskirt, look on. All in their

late teens, they are unmade and worn-out, as if they hadn't slept

last night.

Brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. Brad walks over

to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through

the shades. Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy's MAIL out of

the mailbox that hangs next to the door.

The door opens and JIMMY answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4"

and thin, dressed in boxers, a t-shirt and bedroom slippers.

Jimmy's tired, but Brad's a friendly face.

Megan hands Jimmy the Mail.

Jimmy stands aside, allowing Megan and Amy into his apartment.

Megan and Amy step inside, but Brad holds back. He needs to talk to

Jimmy, and the girls do not need to hear.

Brad steps past Jimmy into the apartment, and Jimmy shuts the door

after them.

EXT. POOL -- MORNING

The slender white board extends majestically over the glistening

blue water. PEDRO, an unshowered, pot-bellied Hispanic, about

twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts, is

standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as

if expecting an invitation. COREY, a late teenager covered with

tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard

concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many

pool skimmer drains. Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up,

down, up, down. Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to

him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic.

Instead, Pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful.

Pedro smiles as he paddles away from Corey, starting to enjoy his

morning swim. A PAYPHONE hanging on the pool house starts ringing.

Corey drops the Vacuum and runs toward the Payphone. In the

background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly.

EMILY, the voice on the other end, is hushed and uncertain.

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

JESSICA, about eighteen, wire-thin and plain, yet attractive in an

unkept sort of way, with dirty-blond hair past her shoulders, lies

on a couch sleeping. Her chokingly small living room is in a

devastating state of disarray, with clothes and empty food

containers flung in every direction.

An ALARM on a table next to the couch begins blaring, and Jessica

stretches out her arm to silence it.

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Jessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself, still

half asleep. The bathroom is tiny like the living room - pathetic

rather than endearing. She puts TOOTHPASTE on her TOOTHBRUSH.

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

JINA, Jessica's mother, opens the front door and enters the living

room wearing a grocery checkout clerk's uniform. Jina drops her

old, worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway.

She opens the bathroom door and enters.

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Jessica is brushing her teeth when Jina enters.

Jina reaches around Jessica and opens the medicine cabinet, grabs a

bottle of ASPIRIN, and shuts it. Jessica continues brushing as if

her mother were not there.

Jessica shakes her head in the negative sense. Jina exits the

bathroom and Jessica follows, still brushing her teeth.

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Jessica walks over to the ANSWERING MACHINE and hits a button. The

Answering Machine clicks on as Jessica brushes unenthusiastically.

Jessica starts up as if she'd been struck. She spins around to an

open window near the couch, leans out, and spits out the toothpaste

to the concrete sidewalk below. Her mother's voice continues to

pour forth from the Answering Machine.

Jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back

towards the Answering Machine.

Suddenly wide awake, Jessica turns to her mother.

Jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with

water.

Jessica returns to the living room wearing a t-shirt that reads

"Athens Youth Group" in large letters along the front. Jina is

gone. Jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it

haphazardly. She grabs a pair of large SUNGLASSES off of the coffee

table and places them over her eyes.

She opens the door and exits the apartment.

EXT. RON'S GYM -- MORNING

Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT hatchback is parked in front of the small

bare-bones gym.

INT. RON'S GYM, LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Jimmy now dressed in worn-out heavily-frayed khaki shorts and a

short-sleeve button down shirt with a "Ron's Gym" emblem on the

pocket, stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with

one hand while rotating steel CHINESE STRESS BALLS with his other

hand. He opens the locker and pulls out a large brown LUNCH BAG

propped prominently at the base.

RON, the tall, well-built, forty-something owner of the gym,

approaches. Jimmy turns toward Ron. The row of lockers serves as a

backdrop.

Ron exits and Jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker,

defeated. BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, a.k.a. Bobby the Bookie, an

enormous juicehead built like an old-school NFL linebacker, naked

except for a towel around his neck, having just taken a shower, is

leaning against the end of a row of lockers, waiting for his chance

at Jimmy. Jimmy would rather that Ron stay.

Bobby nods in response as Ron passes by on his way out. With the

locker room empty, Bobby unconsciously changes demeanor. He's

tender, frighteningly tender, it's so entirely genuine. Jimmy would

prefer a beating - simple and final. Jimmy pulls his BACKPACK out

of his locker and begins clearing his STUFF.

Bobby shuts Jimmy's locker and steps up to Jimmy so that Jimmy is

now face to face with Bobby's enormous organ - a terrifying sight

for mortal men and reputable women. Jimmy is struck silent,

savagely clenching his Chinese Stress Balls as he struggles for

thought.

Bobby moves on to his own locker.

EXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUS

WIDE across the width of the pool. COREY, wet, with GOGGLES on his

head, holding a WRENCH and SCREW DRIVER, and BYSTANDER #1, stand

over a young twenty-ish female VICTIM who lies passed out on the

cement. A young female LIFEGUARD is kneeling beside the Victim,

checking her pulse and breathing. The two SWIMMERS left in the pool

are climbing out. PETE, a no-nonsense grounds-keeper in his late

thirties, wearing cut-off shorts, a faded t-shirt and a tool belt,

approaches to have a word with Corey.

The Lifeguard stands and runs off toward the PAYPHONE.

Corey tears the Goggles off his head, throws them into the pool, and

about-faces toward the pool-house. As Corey leaves, a RED-HEADED

IDIOT does a sloppy can-opener off the side of the pool.

EXT. EMPTY PARK -- MORNING

Though the park is in a poor neighborhood, it is relatively clean.

The park is quiet and unused this morning except for two young GIRLS

making their way across it. Prominent in the background sits an old

run-down yellow CAR that Jessica drove to the park.

JESSICA is carrying KATIE, a plain, tiny seven-year-old girl, in

piggy-back fashion, with Katie's legs dangling out in front of

Jessica. Katie holds Jessica tight around the collarbone.

Jessica begins walking faster, soon breaking into a crippled run,

the weight of Katie bearing down on her. They reach their

destination - a rickety old merry-go-round. Jessica turns her back

to the merry-go-round, allowing Katie to step onto it.

Katie grabs a handle as Jessica begins to spin the machine. Katie

sails around happily as Jessica steps back to watch, Katie's

youthful enthusiasm lulling Jessica into a nostalgic gloom.

INT. AMBULANCE -- MORNING

HEATHER is driving the AMBULANCE, sirens blaring, a CIGARETTE

hanging out of her mouth, with ALLISON riding shotgun. HARRY, mild-

mannered, rotund, middle-aged and slightly balding, is in the back

sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance,

adjacent to a stretcher. Harry sits expressionless, adjusting his

spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving.

EXT. ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

WIDE on the ambulance tearing through town, lights flashing.

Heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation,

recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary

vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass, on her way to

running through a red light. In the rear of the ambulance, Harry

whips back and forth on the bench, yet remains calm, as if unaware

of Heather's reckless driving.

EXT. POOL, PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS

Within the parking lot, the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in

front of a large picket fence encircling the pool. At the gate

stands the LIFEGUARD.

All three climb out of the ambulance.    Harry rushes toward the

Lifeguard. Heather takes a final puff    of her Cigarette and flicks

it aside before continuing in the same   direction as Harry. Allison

lags behind, pulling a BACKBOARD and a   large FIRST AID KIT out of

the ambulance.

They enter the gate.

EXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUS

Heather and Harry follow the Lifeguard into the pool area, where

several BYSTANDERS have gathered around the VICTIM, BYSTANDER #1 and

PETE among them. Heather gets to the Victim first, but stops short

- she recognizes the Victim. Harry brushes past Heather.

The crowd backs up a bit, and Harry checks for vitals.

Harry looks the Victim over a bit.

Heather turns and walks back toward Allison coming through the gate

carrying the Backboard and First Aid Kit - she wants a word with

Allison. They talk in hushed tones.

Allison hands Heather the First Aid Kit as they move back toward

Harry.

Heather gives Allison a disapproving look, as if to say "don't be

stupid, stupid."

As Heather and Allison approach the Victim, Harry looks up.

Allison lays the Backboard adjacent to the Victim, and the three

place her on the Backboard. Heather is a bit rough.

Harry gives a concerned look to Allison, who returns the look, but

the two say nothing. They place the Victim into the back of the

Ambulance as Heather looks on.

EXT. ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER

The Ambulance is moving along a near-empty single-lane road at a

patient pace, with two CARS tailgating behind it.

INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS

Allison and Harry are in the back with the Victim, and Heather is

again behind the wheel, moving her head ever so slightly, as if to

music playing in her head. Heather's moderate driving speed is in

sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene.

At the same red light that Heather recklessly ran earlier, Heather

stops and looks in all directions before proceeding, even though

there are no cars at the intersection.

Heather turns around in the driver seat, taking her eyes off the

road.

As Heather spins forward to look at the road, the Ambulance jumps as

it hits a pothole.

EXT. COREY AND PEDRO'S HOUSE -- MORNING

The Tow Truck has just pulled up into the driveway. Pedro climbs

out and makes his way up the sidewalk to his front door, carrying a

gallon of MILK. Emily climbs out and trails behind him, carrying

her LAUNDRY BAG and PURSE. The house is very small, with a front

yard that is not much bigger than the sidewalk, and neighboring

houses not much more than a body length apart from each other.

Pedro notices an EVICTION NOTICE on the front door, and that a

brand-new lock has been placed on the otherwise run-down door. He

tries unsuccessfully to open the door.

He walks over and looks through the front window into his kitchen

and sees his DOG. Pedro taps on the window. The Dog looks up at

Pedro, wagging its tail. Pedro tries to open the window, but it's

locked.

Pedro walks around to the side of the house. Emily throws her

Laundry Bag over her shoulder and follows him, frustrated with the

wait. He looks in the window on the pantry door. He backs up and

looks toward Emily, blank. He looks back up at the house,

frustrated. He about-faces, steps over to the side of the

neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure

the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing. Emily shakes her

head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole

situation.

EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- MORNING

Jimmy parks his PIECE-OF-SHIT in front of a mom-and-pop pizza shop

and exits. A sign that reads "Poppy's Pizzeria" hangs above the

pizza shop. He enters.

INT. PIZZA SHOP -- CONTINUOUS

Jimmy walks past a few tables where patrons are eating. PIZZA POP,

a sixty-ish pot-bellied man standing behind the counter making a

PIZZA, sees him.

In an arched entranceway to the back room we see PIZZA MOM back into

view holding several PIZZA BOXES in insulated CARRYING BAGS.

INT. CARLOS' CAR -- MORNING

Jessica is driving the old run-down yellow CAR we saw earlier in the

parking lot of the park, the window down and the radio blasting.

Her CELL PHONE rings and she picks it up.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE -- CONTINUOUS

CARLOS, a skinny Hispanic teenager, is walking out of the

convenience store with a tray of NACHOS, talking on a CELL PHONE.

We cut back and forth between Jessica and Carlos.

The old run-down yellow Car passes Carlos and continues down the

street. Carlos is dumbfounded.

Carlos runs into the street and stands staring down the road at his

Car speeding away from him.

Carlos continues to look as his Car makes a right turn and

disappears from view.

A horn honks, and Carlos steps toward the side of the road as a

STATION WAGON passes right by him. He continues to stand in the

street, although to the side.

Carlos waits impatiently. Jessica pulls up in the Car and comes to

a stop alongside him - she had gone around the block to pick him up.

He gets in the passenger-side door.

The Car pulls away.

INT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Carlos has a look of disgust on his face.

The Car stops, Carlos and Jessica climb out of the Car and pass in

back of it without a word. Carlos climbs into the driver seat, and

Jessica the passenger seat. Jessica grabs Carlos's Nachos and

starts munching them down, dipping each one into the CHEESE SAUCE

that is on the side.

Jessica needs to change the subject.

Jessica is obviously delighting in this. She enjoys Carlos fighting

off the affections of this very unattractive girl.

Carlos reaches down and blasts the radio as the Car speeds down the

road.

EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- MORNING

Jimmy is carrying several full insulated pizza CARRYING BAGS, with

several brown LUNCH BAGS full of food on top. Although the pile

looks unwieldy, Jimmy has no trouble with it. He places the pile on

the roof of his PIECE-OF-SHIT, opens the passenger door, and places

the pile on the passenger seat.

He closes the door, and pulls a DELIVERY LIST out of his pocket to

examine while walking around to the driver's side. Jimmy gets into

the driver's seat and pulls out his CELL PHONE.

Jimmy hangs up, starts his Piece-of-Shit, and pulls out of the

parking lot.

EXT. COUNTY ROAD -- MORNING

A POLICE CAR is sitting off the road, positioned to surprise

unsuspecting speeders. The lone occupant, DEREK, twenty, about 6'

tall with athletic build, in his police-officer uniform, is reading

the SPORTS SECTION of a newspaper.

INT. DEREK'S POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS

OTS on Derek as he turns the page and continues reading the sports

section. A young preppy high school PUNK speeds by in a CORVETTE -

the RADAR GUN reads 93 m.p.h. As he passes, the punk looks straight

at Derek, mouth open, clearly surprised by Derek's presence. Derek

picks up his head and returns the stare of the surprised Punk as he

passes.

Derek's CELL PHONE rings.    He reaches down, fumbles around, and

brings it to his ear.

EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- CONTINUOUS

ALLISON is seated on a small wooden bench in the yard in front of

the rescue squad. HEATHER is pacing back and forth in front of her,

CELL PHONE to her ear. Both are smoking CIGARETTES. Heather is

still heated from seeing Steve's girl, and Allison is uncomfortable

being around Heather, who may lash out at anything. We cut back and

forth between Derek and Heather.

DEREK hears a click, hangs up, puts his Cell Phone down and goes

back to reading the Sports Section.

Heather grabs her PURSE off the bench, replaces her Cell Phone, and

pulls out her KEYS.

Allison gets up and follows Heather toward the parking lot.

EXT. AARON'S HOUSE -- MORNING

CARLOS has parked in front of an old house, which is in a high state

of disrepair. JESSICA gets out of the CAR with Carlos' NACHOS.

Jessica shuts the door. As she walks away, Carlos cannot take his

eyes off of her - he is obsessed.

Jessica walks up the steps and bangs on the screen door. PITT,

African-American, medium build, in his late teens, with thick-framed

glasses, walks up behind the screen door and holds it open for

Jessica to walk in.

INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Jessica walks in.    Pitt let's the door slam shut.

Jessica throws the Nachos on the coffee table and sits on the couch,

head in her hands, on the verge of tears.

INT. POOL, MEN'S BATHROOM -- MORNING

COREY is MOPPING the floor. He glances up as Pedro steps over to

him. Corey and Pedro talk and argue like two kids on a playground.

Pedro bangs on a stall door, with no response.    Pedro pushes the

door to the stall open.

Pedro disappears behind the door of the stall.    Corey leans his Mop

against the wall and exits.

EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- DAY

JIMMY pulls his PIECE-OF-SHIT into the driveway of what appears to

be a one-story house, next to a RANGE ROVER. He climbs out with the

strap of his BACKPACK hanging over one shoulder and walks around the

house to the back yard.

The yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard,

and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories. As Jimmy

turns the corner, he spots a black CAT walking up to him. He grabs

the Cat.

INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

WIDE on Jimmy holding the Cat behind a set of sliding glass doors,

one door partially open. He enters and shuts the door behind him.

Music is playing through stereo speakers, and a black-and-white

movie is playing on the TV with the sound shut off. CAR, an Asian-

American late-twenty-something, is sitting back on the couch facing

the TV. Magazines, junk food, remote controls and a CORDLESS PHONE

are spread out on the coffee table. If Car notices Jimmy enter the

room, he shows no sign of it.

Jimmy tosses the Cat on the floor, and it scurries off to another

part of the house. Jimmy sits in a recliner beside the couch, glad

to take a load off. Jimmy takes a peak at the TV.

No response. The Cordless Phone starts ringing.    Car remains

perfectly still.

No response.   The Cordless Phone continues to ring.

Jimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of Car.

Nothing. Jimmy jumps up from his recliner. He stares at Car. He

steps over, takes two fingers and checks Car's pulse. He stands

back, unsure of what to do.

Hesitant, Jimmy walks over to a closet, opens the door, and slides a

GYM BAG out into the room. He opens the Gym Bag and pulls out a

large bag of MARIJUANA and a few jars of K. He throws them into his

Backpack, zips up the Gym Bag, and puts it back into the closet.

Jimmy exits through the sliding glass doors.

EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Jimmy shuts the doors behind him. He stops in his tracks just

outside the doors, thoughts running through his mind.

INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

WIDE on Jimmy through the doors as he about faces and stares into

the house. He slides the doors open and re-enters.

He picks up the Gym Bag and carries it to the front of the couch.

He sets down Gym Bag and drops to his knees, all while noticing that

Car appears to be staring at him. He unloads the remaining contents

of the Gym Bag into his Backpack, including a few bags of PILLS, a

few more jars of K, and two large bags of WHITE POWDER.

He throws one strap of his Backpack over his shoulder and stands in

front of Car. Jimmy stares at Car.

EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

WIDE on Jimmy as he throws his Backpack into his trunk, climbs into

his Piece-of-Shit, and sits, reflecting.

INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- LATER

Jimmy is driving through semi-busy traffic. Music is blaring from

the radio, and the driver-side window is open, making the noise in

the cockpit quite loud. Jimmy's left hand is simultaneously wrapped

around the steering wheel and the DELIVERY LIST, which is hanging

down over the steering wheel so that he can read it. Jimmy's CELL

PHONE rings.

Jimmy turns off the radio and begins rolling up the driver-side

window.

INT. MATT'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

MATT, in his late teens, has a very short buzz-cut. He's wearing an

old t-shirt and faded cargo-shorts, and he's sitting up on the edge

of his unmade bed. Matt's bedroom is a shithole, with dirty clothes

piled everywhere. He's talking into a CORDLESS PHONE, using his

free hand to rub the back of his neck nervously.

We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt.

Jimmy hangs up and begins to roll down the window. The cell phone

begins ringing again. Jimmy reverses himself and begins rolling the

window back up.

We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt. Matt is now pacing

back and forth in his shithole room. His voice is hushed, although

the sense of urgency in it is obvious. Jimmy's still talking loud,

as his Piece-of-Shit does not provide a quiet ride.

Jimmy's eyes get very wide.

Jimmy slams on the breaks and cuts the wheel to the left. Too late.

Jimmy rocks forward as the stress balls that were sitting on the

passenger seat fly to the floor.

EXT. TRAFFIC INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS

Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit has just rear-ended another CAR of equal value

parked in front of a STOP SIGN in an otherwise empty intersection.

The DRIVER of the forward Car stirs.

INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Jimmy has his right arm draped over the Pizza Boxes in the passenger

seat, protecting them from flying forward as a parent would have

instinctively reached to hold back a child. His Cell Phone starts

ringing again. He slowly begins to stir.

EXT. TRAFFIC INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS

The driver, DAVE, a large, ripped, soft-spoken juicehead, gets out

of the forward car holding the back of his neck. He slams the door

shut with his free hand, pissed, and staggers towards Jimmy's car.

A twenty-something FEMALE PASSENGER is sitting motionless in the

passenger seat. Dave glances up and sees Jimmy.

Jimmy turns off the ringer on his Cell Phone and gets out of his

vehicle.

Jimmy notices the Female Passenger in the passenger seat and walks

toward her, with Dave following.

Jimmy and Dave both stand near the passenger side of the car. The

window is completely open. The Female Passenger lies motionless,

bleeding noticeably from the forehead.

The Female Passenger begins to slowly stir.    It is clear she is out

of it - still very woozy.

Jimmy reaches for his Cell Phone, but Dave again objects.

Dave lights a CIGARETTE.

Dave reflexively puts a finger to his nostril and examines it for

blood.

Jimmy and Dave get in their respective cars and drive off.

EXT. POOL, SWINGS -- DAY

EMILY is seated on a swing off to the side of the gated pool area,

smoking a CIGARETTE, looking in through the gate at the pool. She's

wearing an old, yet barely worn, BASEBALL CAP.

Corey enters the frame, grabs the Cigarette and stomps it out, but

Emily's nonchalant demeanor remains.

Emily hands Corey the Baseball Cap.     Corey is caught off-guard.

Corey has no desire to wear it, so he holds it.

Pedro is standing at the gate.

Corey heads toward the gate and spots KEVIN, a young boy of about

ten, sitting on the MOPED that was leaning up along the interior of

the pool-area fence.

Kevin gets off.   Corey continues toward the gate.

EXT. POOL - PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

The driver-side door of a TOW TRUCK is swung wide open, with "ATHENS

TOWING SERVICE" written on side. Pedro is leaning one hand on the

rolled down window and his other hand on the roof of the Tow Truck,

watching Corey, who is leaning over the Tow Truck's hood, writing

Mr. Carson's address on a piece of PAPER with a PEN.

Pedro throws the Paper and Pen into the Tow Truck.

Pedro climbs behind the wheel as Corey holds the door open to talk

to him.

Corey steps aside as Pedro shuts his door and turns the ignition.

Corey watches as Pedro pulls out.

EXT. POLICE STATION -- DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT on the police station with a number of POLICE CARS

parked neatly in front. Two middle-age MALE POLICE OFFICERS are

standing in front of the entrance, talking. Heather and Allison's

AMBULANCE is parked in the lot across the street, facing the police

station.

INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS

The engine is off. HEATHER is behind the wheel and ALLISON is

slouched back on the passenger seat, both watching the two Male

Police Officers standing in front of the building.

A FEMALE POLICE OFFICER, a prim-and-proper plain-jane 5'5" woman in

her early twenties, exits the building and walks over to talk with

the two Male Police Officers.

Both Heather's and Allison's BEEPERS go off.    They both look down at

their Beepers and sit up in their seats.

Heather starts the Ambulance and starts to pull out of the lot.

As they pull out of the lot, the two Male Police Officers head

toward their Police Cars and the Female Police Officer heads back

inside the station.

INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

JESSICA is on a PHONE, holding a bookmarked trash NOVEL in her hand.

PITT is sitting on the couch watching TV.

Jessica looks up to see TROY entering the house with AARON behind

him. TROY is a shaggy, 5'10" pothead slacker in his late teens,

wearing beat-up jeans, a t-shirt with a faded logo on it, and light

hair above his lip and on his chin. AARON, a burly mutt, about the

same age and only slightly shorter, wearing cut-off cargo pants with

one of the thigh pockets ripped off, a sleeveless shirt and a tattoo

on his left shoulder. Troy notices Jessica immediately.

Aaron shoves Troy roughly out of the way as Jessica bolts out of the

room.

Jessica runs out the back door and around the front of the house.

Aaron sees her turn the corner of the house, and he turns around to

cut her off.

Aaron runs out the front door after Jessica.

EXT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Aaron is out the front door, yelling at Jessica who is further down

the street.

Jessica runs to Carlos's CAR, opens the door, throws the Novel in

and jumps in after it. She throws on her seatbelt and rifles

through her purse, looking for her pepper spray.

Aaron, holding a ROCK slightly bigger than his fist, smashes the

passenger-side window.

Aaron reaches in and grabs Jessica's hair and begins to rip her out

of the car, cutting his own arm while doing so. Aaron growls, more

in anger than pain, as he yanks with all his might. Jessica is

holding onto the inside of the passenger door with one hand, and is

scratching and clawing at Aaron to get Aaron to release her with her

other hand. Jessica's seat belt clearly is the only thing keeping

her in the car. Carlos is pulling away slowly. Aaron releases one

hand from Jessica's hair and punches at the top of her head.

Aaron repeatedly tries to hit Jessica with his free hand as Carlos

pulls into the street. Aaron runs along with the car. Jessica

reaches toward Aaron with a closed fist, where she is holding her

PEPPER SPRAY. She sprays at Aaron but misses. Aaron grabs at her

fist with his free hand and rips the Pepper Spray from Jessica.

Jessica screams in pain as Aaron sprays away.

Carlos swerves violently to the side towards a parked CAR along the

side of the road. Aaron is plowed along toward the Car, but

releases Jessica at the last possible second, just avoiding a

collision with the Car. Carlos was not fooling around.

Aaron watches them tear down the street before he about-faces and

walks briskly back toward the house, where Troy is standing on the

front porch watching the action.

INT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Jessica is still reeling from the pepper spray.   She can barely

stammer out her words.

Carlos turns to look through the rear window of his car - all clear.

An otherwise believable apology, except that Carlos knows Jessica

too well. Jessica does not want to be in this alone. Carlos cuts

the wheel to the right and tears down a side street.

EXT. LANDLORD'S HOUSE -- DAY

Pedro pulls his TOW TRUCK and parallel parks on the street in front

of the house.

Pedro gets out of his Tow Truck and walks up to the front door. He

rings the doorbell. There is no answer, so he rings the doorbell

again, then knocks on the door. Again no answer, so he bangs on the

door vigorously. He leans over and peers inside the window. As he

does so, MR. CARSON opens the front door, apparently having just

woken up.

Mr. Carson shuts the door. Pedro turns around and eyes the gray

FORD TAURUS parked behind his Tow Truck. He walks back to his Tow

Truck and grabs some tools. He begins hitching up the Ford Taurus

to his Tow Truck.

Mr. Carson parts the curtain behind his front window, eyes wide as

he watches Pedro. The front door opens, and Mr. Carson comes

storming out.

Mr. Carson proceeds inside. Pedro watches Mr. Carson proceed back

into the house as he releases the Ford Taurus back down to the

ground.

EXT. BASEBALL FIELD, PARKING LOT-- DAY

The baseball field is empty. MATT is leaning against the driver-

side door of his CAR, which is parked all by itself near a dumpster

at the edge of the lot. JIMMY pulls his PIECE-OF-SHIT up and parks

next to the driver-side door of Matt's Car.

Jimmy climbs out of his Piece-of-Shit.

Matt starts walking to meet Jimmy at the rear of the cars.

Matt pulls his WALLET out of his back pocket.

Jimmy opens his trunk and pulls his BACKPACK out.

Rushed, Jimmy blows it off and pulls a jar of K out of his Backpack.

Jimmy accepts the Forty-Five Dollars, and gives Matt the jar of K.

Jimmy is pissed.

Jimmy throws his Backpack back in the trunk and slams it shut.

EXT. POOL, CLUBHOUSE -- DAY

COREY is on a PAYPHONE outside the restrooms, talking to PEDRO.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE -- CONTINUOUS

Pedro is on a PAYPHONE.   We cut back and forth between Pedro and

Corey.

A short beat as Corey thinks.

Corey hangs up and puts more coins into the Payphone.   Pete

approaches, looking for Corey.

Corey tries to phase out Pete's voice.

Pete exits.

EXT. POOL -- MOMENTS LATER

EMILY is laying back in a lounge chair. Corey enters the pool area

from clubhouse carrying the BASEBALL CAP. He walks over to his

MOPED chained to the gate, throws on his Baseball Cap, unlocks his

Moped, and pushes it through the gate where resident KIDS are

gathered around a ping pong table. Emily watches as he hops on the

Moped and throws on his HELMET. KID #1, one of the younger kids at

the table, spot Corey in the distance.

Corey looks over as he starts his Moped.

Corey kicks the stand up on his Moped and rides off.

away their EMS gear into their lockers.

Heather shuts her locker.

JIMMY is driving his PIECE-OF-SHIT with a clear look of anger and

frustration in his face. The windows are down, but the radio is no

longer playing.

INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Jimmy's CELL PHONE rings.   He answers.

Jimmy hits a button to hang up and shuts the Cell Phone, but the

cell phone immediately rings again. Jimmy flips the cell phone open

again. His eyes grow wide as he stares at the caller ID, which

reads "CAR LEE." Jimmy stares at the Cell Phone as it continues

ringing and ringing.

He hits a button and replaces the Cell Phone to his ear.

INT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

KWON, an Asian-American in his early twenties, holding to his ear

the CORDLESS PHONE that was on the coffee table, is pacing in front

of CAR, who is still seated on the couch in the exact position we

saw him last. The GYM BAG that Jimmy emptied earlier is on the

floor at his feet. We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Kwon.

Jimmy runs a yellow light that turns red while he's still crossing

the intersection.

Jimmy, very anxious, runs a red light.    A CAR going the other way

stops and honks.

The TRAFFIC in front of Jimmy slows, and Jimmy coasts to a

standstill at the tail of the traffic and in the middle of a busy

intersection.

Jimmy's light turns yellow while he is still at a standstill in the

middle of the intersection.

Jimmy's light turns red, and he is still at a standstill in the

middle of the intersection. A CAR at the head of the cross traffic

inches up to Jimmy's Piece-of-Shit and honks, but Jimmy does not

seem to notice.

The cross traffic honking grows louder, even though there is nowhere

for Jimmy to go.

Jimmy hangs up.

EXT. INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS

Cars are still honking at Jimmy as he continues to sit at a

standstill in the intersection.

Jimmy throws his Piece-of-Shit in reverse, then cuts left, through

and out of the intersection.

EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

JIMMY parallel parks his PIECE-OF-SHIT in front of his apartment and

exits carrying his BACKPACK. He unlocks the door to his apartment,

opens it, and steps one foot inside.

INT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Jimmy slides the Backpack into his apartment. TIGHT on the backpack

as it slides across the hardwood floor, straight towards the camera,

to a halt immediately in front of the camera. Jimmy steps back

outside and shuts the door.

EXT. ROB'S HOUSE -- DAY

COREY is standing in the middle of an unkept lawn, watching ROB,

about eighteen and wearing Corey's HELMET, ride Corey's MOPED in

circles around him on the lawn. He's treating the Moped rather

roughly, pulling wheelies and kicking the tail end out repeatedly.

Corey is watching impatiently, holding the BASEBALL CAP at his side.

Rob jumps the Moped over the curb into the street, then turns up the

driveway and pulls up alongside Corey. Rob removes the Helmet.

INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- DAY

AARON returns from the kitchen drinking from a can of SODA. TROY

and PITT are on the couch, VIDEO GAME CONTROLLERS in their hands,

The PHONE on the coffee table rings.     Pitt picks it up.

Pitt tosses the Phone to Aaron.

CARLOS has parked his CAR along the side of the street.      JESSICA is

in the passenger seat on her CELL PHONE.

INT. AARON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Aaron is walking into the kitchen, and although he is furious, he is

keeping his voice down so that Pitt and Troy do not hear. Cut back

and forth between Aaron in his house and Jessica in Carlos' Car.

Aaron hangs up.

INT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Back to Jessica and Carlos in Carlos' parked Car.

Jessica notices something, turning to look out the broken passenger-

side window. She's stares, interested.

Through the window, we see that Carlos' Car is parked across the

street from Car's house, and that a POLICE CAR and a CORONER'S VAN

are parked in front of it. Kwon is standing with a POLICE OFFICER,

more distraught than the last time we saw him, answering questions.

He's oblivious to Jessica and Carlos.

Jessica turns back to Carlos.

Jessica punches another number into her Cell Phone.

Jessica hangs up and throws her Cell Phone on top of the dashboard.

Carlos starts the Car.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET -- CONTINUOUS

ESTABLISHING SHOT on the Car pulling back out onto the street as

Kwon continues talking to the Police Officer in the background.

EXT. LANDLORD'S HOUSE -- DAY

ROB is riding his newly-acquired MOPED, with COREY on the back.

Corey is holding Rob with one hand, his BASEBALL CAP with the other.

He drops Corey off in front of Mr. Carson's house.

As Rob pulls a wheelie and exits the frame, Corey walks up to the

front door of the house. He rings the doorbell, reaching into his

pocket and pulling out a wad of BILLS as he waits. Mr. Carson opens

the door.

Mr. Carson opens the screen door, and Corey hands him the Bills.

Mr. Carson begins counting them.

Mr. Carson slams the door.

Corey stands and stares at the door a moment.   He turns and leaves,

resigned to a long walk back to the pool.

EXT. DINER, BACK-LOT -- DAY

PEDRO is driving nonchalantly toward the back-lot.     A song is

playing on the car radio.

WIDE on a parked MUSTANG, a couple empty parking spaces on the

passenger side of it. Pedro's TOW TRUCK backs up into the frame so

that it's back end is almost touching the front end of the Mustang.

Pedro climbs out of his Tow Truck, leaving it on, and starts walking

around to the back of it. Suddenly remembering, he doubles back and

sticks his head in through the driver-side window, checking the gas

gage. It's more than 3/4 full.

Satisfied, Pedro proceeds toward the rear of the tow truck and

hitches the Mustang to the back of it. An older couple pulls into

the parking lot and parks one car length from the Mustang. OLDER

MAN and OLDER WOMAN climb out of their CAR. The Older Man has taken

an interest in what Pedro is doing.

Older Woman notices that the front passenger-side tire is flat.

Pedro steps around to the passenger side of the Mustang, surprised

to see the FLAT TIRE.

Older Man and Older Woman begin walking toward the entrance to the

diner.

As Older Man and Older Woman proceed toward the diner, Pedro opens

the door to his Tow Truck, and reaches in to hit the control which

lifts the Mustang.

EXT. DINER -- MOMENTS LATER

Through the window we see PATRONS eating. Pedro drives by in his

Tow Truck with the Mustang hitched to the back.

INT. DR. COOK'S OFFICE, EXAMINING ROOM -- DAY

HEATHER is sitting on the examining table, topless, holding her

breath as DR. COOK runs a STETHOSCOPE on different areas of her

back. Heather's BLOUSE and PURSE are lying on the examining table

beside her.

Heather lets her breath out.

Heather reaches into her PURSE and lights a CIGARETTE. Dr. Cook

sighs - they've had a discussion about Heather's smoking before.

Heather hops off the bench and makes a sudden about-face. She is

gesturing wildly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she is half-

naked.

Dr. Cook is clearly uncomfortable conversing with Heather while her

breasts are exposed.

Heather grabs her Blouse from the table and puts it back on.

Heather leaves and shuts the door behind her.

EXT. DEREK'S HOUSE -- DAY

The sound of panting can be heard. Two people are having sex.

There are no words, although the girl regularly lets out high-

pitched groans, indicative of at least a little pain.

INT. DEREK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

LOW ANGLE MEDIUM on ALLISON bent over the bed, mouth agape. She

buries her face in the mattress, revealing DEREK thrusting from

behind. Derek climaxes. Allison pops up from below.

Derek lies back to put his head on the pillow.

Allison lies on top, nestling her head in his chest.

Allison climbs out of bed, and her mood changes from thoughtful to

business-like. She begins putting her CLOTHES on.

Derek looks calmly over at the ALARM CLOCK on the nightstand.

Allison opens the door and walks out, a little bow-legged.

INT. PIZZA SHOP -- DAY

JIMMY walks through the front door. PIZZA POP spots him immediately

from behind the counter. The PHONE rings, but Pizza Pop ignores it.

Jimmy walks around the counter, grabs a couple of SLICES and throws

them in the oven. Pizza Pop picks up the Phone.

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

The door bursts open and JESSICA enters, followed by CARLOS.   KATIE

is watching TV.

Jessica disappears into the kitchen.

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

Jessica tosses a FROZEN DINNER into the microwave.

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Jessica places two Frozen Dinners, complete with a FORK apiece, down

on the coffee table. Katie grabs her Fork.

Carlos is disappointed that Jessica wants to fix herself up to see

Carter. Katie is already eating.

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

We're behind JESSICA as she removes her SHORTS and her SHIRT.

INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Katie now has a glass of ICE-TEA in front of her.    Carlos is behind

Jessica showering, obscured by the semi-opaque glass shower doors.

INT. DEREK'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- DAY

HEATHER, ALLISON and DEREK are seated at the table with CHINESE

TAKE-OUT in front of them. A NEWSPAPER opened to the classifieds

lies near Derek's place at the table. Derek and Allison are chowing

down while Heather sits watching Derek. Derek is using a FORK.

Derek continues chowing down, not responding.   Derek's CELL PHONE

rings, and he answers it.

Derek hangs up, stands up, and puts the Cell Phone in his pocket.

Derek takes another bite, gets up and heads for the door.

Derek exits as Heather's eyes hang on him.

Heather gets up and walks in the direction of Derek's bedroom.

Allison instinctively rises and follows.

INT. DEREK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Heather walks over to the bed and starts rifling through the mess on

the nightstand. She picks up a tube of ASTROGLIDE and nonchalantly

throws it on the bed.

Heather opens the nightstand drawer and immediately pulls out a box

of CONDOMS, showing them to Allison.

EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- DAY

Jimmy is sitting in an alley behind the pizza shop, finishing a COKE

with plenty of ice. Kwon emerges from the back door of the pizza

shop. Jimmy sees Kwon, and hides his displeasure as best he can.

Jimmy's Cell Phone rings.

Jimmy reaches into his pocket, but instead of a cell phone, he pulls

out his car KEYS, which he tosses at Kwon. Kwon storms off, and

Jimmy grabs his CELL PHONE out of his other pocket and answers it.

INT. DAVE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

Dave is standing in front of finishing up blending a PROTEIN DRINK,

holding a CORDLESS PHONE to his ear. Cut back and forth between

Jimmy and Dave.

Dave, having walked into the living room, takes a seat on the couch

next to the FEMALE PASSENGER we saw earlier, her head now bandaged.

She is snorting a line of COKE off of the coffee table.

Jimmy considers, then pulls a PEN and his DELIVERY LIST out of his

pocket. He turns the Delivery List over to write on the back.

EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- CONTINUOUS

The doors of Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT are flung wide open.    Kwon is

hauling Jimmy's spare TIRE out of the trunk.

Kwon dumps the Tire on the ground and, seeing nowhere to hide

anything, stands straight up and looks at Jimmy.

Kwon tosses Jimmy his KEYS back, jumps in his BMW, and takes off.

Jimmy becomes increasingly resolved as he watches him leave. Jimmy

pulls out his Delivery List and his Cell Phone. He turns the

Delivery List over to the number on the back and punches it into his

Cell Phone. He paces as he talks.

EXT. POOL -- DAY

PETE is on a ride-on LAWN MOWER.    He spots COREY walking toward the

gate to the pool area.

Pete shuts off the blade and steers the Lawn Mower over to Corey,

stopping just short of him.

Corey hops on the Lawn Mower, turns on the blade, and picks up where

Pete left off. Pete shakes his head in disgust and heads into the

garage.

Corey is wide-eyed as he turns the corner entering the last leg of

his first lawn lap and spots PEDRO approaching in his TOW TRUCK with

the MUSTANG hitched to the back of it. He shuts the blade off and

steers the Lawn Mower over to the tow truck. Pedro parks as Corey

hops off the Lawn Mower.

Corey looks over at Emily, laying down in a lounge chair.

Corey heads toward the garage. Emily looks over at Pedro sitting in

the Tow Truck. Pedro sticks his hand up to say hello to Emily,

awkward. She ignores him and begins gathering her stuff.

INT. POOL, GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Pete is sitting on the floor repairing a WEED-WACKER.

Corey hops off the Lawn Mower.

He runs out the door.

The door slams shut behind Corey.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- EVENING

Music is audible from inside the house. Carter's house is an old

dilapidated house, with a tiny front yard and huge back yard

surrounded by trees, with rusty old cars scattered throughout. Just

about everybody enters the house from the back. BERUBI, in his

early twenties, very large and athletic, wearing mesh shorts and a

beat-up t-shirt, and a MALE FRIEND, of a similar age with an average

build and dressed lazily in khakis and an un-tucked shirt, are

unloading a KEG from the bed of a PICK-UP TRUCK onto a dolly.

HEATHER and ALLISON are standing on the back porch. Heather is

holding a bottle of VODKA in her hand. Heather bangs on the screen

door. CARTER approaches. In his early twenties, Carter is tough,

with a modestly athletic build and a gruff voice, and possessing an

appetite for greasy food and cheap beer. He's a guy's guy.

Heather tries to open the screen door - it's stuck.

Carter slams the handle from the inside - the door opens.

As Heather passes, Carter mockingly shows Heather the back of his

hand as if to smack her. Heather and Allison pass, and Carter holds

the door open with his foot as he looks for something to prop it

open.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

From the inside we can see that Carter's house is the same house

that Jerry moved out of this morning - Jerry was Carter's housemate.

Heather and Allison walk in as if they know their way around.

Carter spots a large clay LAWN DWARF on the back porch. He reaches

for it.

Heather holds out the vodka.

Carter props the screen door open with the Lawn Dwarf.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- EVENING

PEDRO, EMILY and COREY, now wearing the BASEBALL CAP, are parked in

the TOW TRUCK across the street from the front of Carter's house.

Porno magazines lie on the dashboard and the floor. BERUBI, walking

along the side of the house from the back yard, spots Pedro behind

the wheel. He approaches.

Berubi motions to the MUSTANG hitched to the back of it.

Pedro starts to climb out of the Tow Truck.

Pedro shuts the door to his Tow Truck and pulls up his shorts.

Corey sticks his hand up to say hello.

INT. CARLOS' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Carlos's CAR is parked in street in front of Carter's house, just

down the street from where Pedro has parked, but on the opposite

side of the street and facing in the opposite direction. Through

the windshield, we see Berubi head back toward the house as Pedro

glances at Jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank-top,

before climbing back into the Tow Truck and pulling back out onto

the road. Carlos has noticed Pedro, but Jessica, silent as she

stares at the house, has not.

Finally, Carlos speaks up.

Jessica grabs the rear view mirror and aims it toward herself.   She

begins fixing her hair in the mirror.

She pulls her LIPSTICK out of her PURSE and begins to apply it as

Carlos watches. She puts her Lipstick away and stares at Carter's

house another moment. She checks to see that her SUNGLASSES are

still hanging on the front of her shirt.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- CONTINUOUS

Jessica climbs out of the car and shuts the door. Carlos follows

suit. They move around the side of the house toward the back porch.

Jessica stops in her tracks and turns to face Carlos.

Without waiting for a response, Jessica turns around and climbs onto

the back porch, walking its length toward Carter, who is kneeling

with his back to us as he puts a TAP on the KEG. Carlos stands

watching, not sure what to do.

Carter turns around, and seems disappointed to see her.

Carter climbs to his feet and heads toward the back door, shaking

off his hands, passing right by Jessica. Jessica pulls her

Sunglasses from her shirt.

Carter turns and grabs the Sunglasses.

Carter heads into the house.    Jessica follows Carter, and we follow

Jessica.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

Carter is just not interested in talking with Jessica, even if he

didn't have other things on his mind. Carter enters bathroom, but

Jessica follows persistently.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Carter turns on the sink and washes his hands.

Jessica sees that Carter has finally shown some interest.

This strikes Carter.

Carter starts to walk out, but Jessica stops him.

Carter notices that the door to the bathroom is still open.

Although music is blasting outside, and it is unlikely that anyone

could hear their conversation, Carter closes the door and locks it.

Carter contemplates, and Jessica realizes that the best thing to do

is keep silent and let Carter's good side take over.

Jessica is not completely satisfied, but Carter has decided what

he's going to do, and that's that.

Carter exits, leaving the door open, but Jessica doesn't follow.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT

JIMMY has parked his PIECE-OF-SHIT in the rear of the back yard

behind all of the other CARS that have pulled in. He climbs out,

slides his CHINESE STRESS BALLS into his pocket, and walks toward

the house, his BACKPACK strapped over both shoulders like a

schoolboy.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

Jimmy steps through the open screen door into the kitchen.

HEATHER and ALLISON are playing CARDS at the kitchen table with a

male PARTYGOER. They jump up from the table and approach Jimmy.

Jimmy pulls three small bags of MARIJUANA out of his BACKPACK.

Allison pulls out some BILLS.

Jimmy as he stuffs the Marijuana back in his Backpack and heads into

the hallway.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- NIGHT

The door is shut.    JESSICA is talking on her CELL PHONE.

A cartoon becomes audible through Jessica's Cell Phone - KATIE has

put her phone up to the TV. Jessica listens impatiently.

But Katie has already put her phone up to the TV again. Jessica

waits, turning to face the door, wondering what's going on the other

side of it.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- MOMENTS LATER

PEDRO and EMILY grab CUPS off the rusted washing machine that sits

on the back porch. Corey takes notice of a ping pong table set up

in the back yard, where BARNES is playing PING PONG PLAYER 1.

Barnes is skinny but attractive, and has an even more attractive

BARNES' GIRLFRIEND watching him play, along with PING PONG PLAYER 2

and various PARTYGOERS.

Pedro begins dispensing beer from the KEG.

Corey drops his BEER and moves in aggressively, grabbing Emily by

the wrists.

Emily falls on her ass.

Emily stands up, turns around and heads toward the back door leading

into the kitchen, storming past a TEENAGE BOY and TEENAGE GIRL

passionately kissing each other against a tree in the back yard. We

hang on the couple as Emily walks out of frame. As the boy works

his way down to her neck, the girl's eyes open for a moment and

catch someone watching her.

JIMMY is standing in the kitchen in front of the door looking out

onto the back porch, staring at the couple making out, momentarily

transfixed. Jimmy's hand is in his pocket, turning his CHINESE

STRESS BALLS over and over and over. The girl closes her eyes

again, and Jimmy is forgotten, the moment lost. Jimmy is alone

again, still, as usual.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

Jimmy scans the cramped kitchen. Partygoers are talking, laughing,

carrying on, making out in the way that Partygoers will. Jimmy's

gaze wanders mechanically to anther part of the kitchen falls upon

the entrance to the living room. The terribly familiar figure,

BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, stands tall, proud, talking to several

Partygoers, the light behind him adding a regal air to his menacing

frame - a transcendent silhouette for a hellish vision. Bobby

towers easily over his peers. In his powerful hands he holds a tiny

notepad on which he scribbles as his clients eagerly place their

bets.

RJ, a young African-American early-twenty-something, easily six feet

tall, built like a powerlifter, his worn-out t-shirt doing little to

hide his powerful frame, appears behind Jimmy.

Jimmy turns around to face RJ.

JESSICA moves past RJ and Jimmy toward the back door. As RJ about-

faces to lead Jimmy out of the kitchen and deeper into the house, we

follow Jessica outside.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- CONTINUOUS

Jessica sees CARLOS standing against a post on the back porch

drinking his BEER. He is surrounded by several PARTYGOERS, but

isn't talking to any of them.

Carlos pulls a pint of WHISKEY out of his back pocket.

Jessica accepts the Whiskey and takes a long pull. She holds onto

the Whiskey without saying anything, and Carlos does not object.

She begins to take in the sights and sounds of the party, and

notices COREY leaning against a rusty old washing machine near the

KEG as PEDRO hands him another BEER.

Jessica's POV as Corey spots her standing next to Carlos. He

continues to stare at Jessica, clearly taken by the sight of her,

his eyes locking onto hers. The desperation of their individual

struggles is lost for a moment.

The moment quickly passes as Corey turns his attention back to

Pedro.

Corey attention is again drawn to the ping pong game, and Jessica

takes note.

Carlos motions toward the large kitchen window.   Jessica turns to

look through it.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

Jessica and Carlos are staring through the window at the CARD game

taking place at the kitchen table. HEATHER and ALLISON are back at

it with the male PARTYGOER they were playing with earlier, as well

as CARD PLAYER, who has recently joined them. Heather is smoking a

CIGARETTE. Card Player is dealing a round of asshole. All are

visibly drunk.

Jessica turns toward the steps leading out onto the back yard, and

Carlos follows. Heather and Card Player each place one card face-

down on the table, exchanging one for the other.

Card Player obeys and drinks.

All obey Heather.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

We recognize the room as Jerry's old bedroom, empty except for a bed

stripped of it's sheets, a naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a

small TV on top of it, and a few posters and scraps of trash that

have been left behind. JIMMY and RJ are looking across the room at

SINJIN, a young African-American male about RJ's age, with an

average build, sharply dressed in a button-down, and sport coat.

Sinjin has his back to Jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty

old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his

stylish threads. LOUIE, an overweight, slobbish Caucasian male a

few years older than Sinjin, sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that

might creak even more than Sinjin's pogo stick - in Louie's lap

rests a BOWLING BALL BAG. Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie, Jimmy

fondles his WATER BOTTLE nervously. He turns around to watch RJ

closing the door behind them.

Sinjin spins on the Pogo Stick and spots RJ and Jimmy standing at

the entrance. Sinjin loses his balance and places a foot on the

ground. He steps off the Pogo Stick and composes himself after his

exhaustive venture.

Sinjin tosses the Pogo Stick aside.

Sinjin turns the GARBAGE CAN over and sits on it while motioning to

the bed.

RJ walks over to lock the door as Jimmy inches closer into the room.

Everybody looks at RJ.

RJ steps out and shuts the door behind him.

Jimmy is clearly uncomfortable at the sight of these two.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT

EMILY is standing on the front steps, wondering whether to continue

outside or head back inside. She's completely out of place here

among the older crowd. FEMALE PARTYGOER 1 and a PARTYGOER appear

behind her in the doorway behind her.

Emily politely moves down to the bottom of the stairs and steps

aside. She watches as Female Partygoer 1 and the Partygoer pass by

her into the front yard.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT

COREY and PEDRO climb off the back porch toward the ping pong table.

BARNES and PING PONG PLAYER 1 are just finishing a point, which

Barnes takes easily, as PING PONG PLAYER 2 waits his turn. Barnes

is skinny but attractive, and has an even more attractive BARNES'

GIRLFRIEND watching him play.

Ping Pong Player 1 steps back and notes Corey approaching.

Corey steps to the table opposite Barnes, confident, but

unenthusiastic. Corey is not playing for the fun of it - somewhere

deep down Corey wants to remind himself that he's good at something.

Barnes tosses the PING PONG BALL to Corey.

Corey's first serve is wicked - fast and spinning wildly.    Barnes

has no chance.

Pedro stands alongside and watches silently, pensive, his mind

distraught over their larger dilemma.

Pedro leaves obediently.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT

JESSICA takes another pull from the WHISKEY.    CARLOS is watches

attentively.

Jessica takes another drink and looks toward the ping pong table,

where Corey is manhandling Barnes, as Ping Pong Player 1, Ping Pong

Player 2, Barnes' Girlfriend and various Partygoers look on.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

JIMMY walks in from living room looking for Bobby. He continues on

toward the back door leading out onto the back porch.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, CARTER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

A dense gathering of PARTYGOERS is packed tight within the confines

of Carter's room, rather small despite being the largest bedroom in

the house. The collection of Partygoers are watching with religious

fervor the basketball game playing from the modest TV in the room.

CARTER, BERUBI, AARON and TROY are among the crowd. All those

gathered here have an interest in the game, but none as much as

BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, who stands back against the far wall though

the nobody in the congregation dares venture into his sightline of

the television. Partygoers yell in unison at various events

displayed on the screen. The door opens, and Pedro peeks into the

room.

Pedro shuts the door.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

HEATHER and ALLISON are sitting on a couch facing each other, very

drunk and extremely happy. The coffee table in front of them is

filled with plastic CUPS and LIQUOR BOTTLES, many of which are

empty.

Looking down the hallway outside Jerry's bedroom we see RJ standing

against the door. He does not notice the girls looking at him from

the living room.

Allison grabs for the Vodka, but Heather does not let go.

Heather takes another hit of Vodka.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, SIDE YARD -- NIGHT

JIMMY has his CELL PHONE to his ear, waiting for voicemail, anxious.

Jimmy hangs up and takes a moment to think about his options.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT

COREY and BARNES are continue to play as PING PONG PLAYER 1, PING

PONG PLAYER 2, BARNES' GIRLFRIEND and various PARTYGOERS continue to

watch. In the background, JESSICA paces back and forth as CARLOS

sits on the ground indian-style watching the Partygoers on the back

porch. Carlos takes a shot of WHISKEY.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT

EMILY stands against the garage door, keeping to herself.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

ALLISON has her head back on the couch as HEATHER lights a

CIGARETTE. MITCH approaches the ladies with a BEER in his hand.

Mitch is a staunch thirty-something mechanic with a beer-gut,

dressed in Levis overalls, and wearing a backwards baseball cap and

a beard that together hide much of his head.

While Mitch is searching for an answer, a familiar voice cuts over

the background noise.

PEDRO is approaching from the kitchen carrying a nearly-full BEER.

Mitch seems a bit disappointed to see him.

Pedro leaves and Mitch follows.

Allison plops down on all fours, and begins vomiting violently.

Heather kneels down next to Allison and pulls her hair back so it

doesn't get hit by the vomit.

Allison has a few more convulsions.

Allison sits up, fixes her hair, then grabs the VODKA from Heather.

Allison takes a mouthful, rinses, and spits. Allison then takes a

drink.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS

PEDRO and MITCH make their way into the back yard towards the ping

pong table. PING PONG PLAYER 1, PING PONG PLAYER 2, BARNES'

GIRLFRIEND and various PARTYGOERS are gathered around COREY and

BARNES. Corey functions mechanically - his mind is not on the game.

Barnes is openly frustrated as Corey finishes him off.

Corey notices Mitch standing next to Pedro.

Corey heads toward the Mustang, and Pedro and Mitch follow.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, CARTER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

PARTYGOERS yell in unison at various events displayed on the screen.

JIMMY is off to the side of the room talking to BOBBY.

Jimmy is losing it, his grip on reality.   He's drowning, grasping

for anything that floats.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT

EMILY is standing with her back to the garage door talking to MALE

PARTYGOER 1, an average size boy about Corey's age.

Changing the subject, Male Partygoer 1 pulls a couple of white

TABLETS out of his pocket.

Male Partygoer 1 hands a Tablet to Emily, but she waits to see how

Male Partygoer 1 take it, which he does by biting it in half and

chasing it with his DRINK. Emily takes Male Partygoer 1's Drink and

does the same.

INT. DEREK'S POLICE CAR -- NIGHT

DEREK is traveling on a busy road, with the sirens of his Police Car

activated. CARS are pulling over to let him pass, but it is taking

some time. He pulls out his CELL PHONE and punches in some numbers.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

The room is crowded with PARTYGOERS. The CORDLESS PHONE is ringing,

and DRUNK PARTYGOER answers it, clearly drunk. We cut back and

forth between Derek and Drunk Partygoer.

Drunk Partygoer hangs up and turns over to a couple of other

Partygoers.

The other Partygoers are not impressed - they continue to sit and

drink. Drunk Partygoer loses focus and rejoins them.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT

COREY and MITCH barter over the Mustang, though Mitch seems more

interested in his BEER than the car. PEDRO is putting the last

touches on putting on the NEW TIRE. He picks the FLAT TIRE up and

tosses it in the trunk.

Mitch polishes off his Beer and holds the empty cup up.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT

AARON and TROY step out onto the back porch and spot JESSICA and

CARLOS. Upon seeing them, Carlos stands straight up.

Jessica, still pacing, stops in her tracks and turns around beside

Carlos. It's too late to gracefully exit, so Carlos stands there

frozen. Jessica does not seem afraid.

Aaron and Troy approach.    It's clear Troy doesn't really want to be

there.

Carlos painfully does not answer. Jessica, unfazed, takes another

hit of WHISKEY. Jessica is confident because of the booze and

because of Carter's promise. Jessica and Aaron begin arguing in

calm "I'm above this" mannerisms.

Carlos simply stands there, ashamed of his inability to act.

Aaron hands his beer to Troy and then grabs the Whiskey Jessica is

holding. Jessica flinches as if afraid Aaron would hit her.

Aaron uses his shirt to vigorously rub the mouth of the bottle

before taking a long pull. The Whiskey is almost gone. Jessica

grabs back the Whiskey, wipes it off as Aaron did, and polishes it

off.

Jessica moves to leave, but Aaron grabs her arm.

Jessica smashes the bottle over Aaron's head, knocking Aaron to the

floor in a daze.

The PARTYGOERS in the back yard are now fixed on Jessica and Aaron.

CARTER runs over, holding his CIGAR and a BEER. BERUBI is behind

Carter, eager for a fight.

Troy shrugs his shoulders.

Aaron sits up against a tree, his hands to his head. Carter starts

to leave. Carlos feels even more ashamed that Carter stepped in and

did something that Carlos did not have the courage to do himself.

Jessica grabs Carter by the shirt.

Jessica winds up and stomps Aaron in the groin.    Aaron growls in

pain and doubles over.

Carter leaves, followed by Berubi.    Jessica watches them leave.    She

turns down to Aaron.

Jessica storms toward Carlos' CAR, and Carlos follows.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

ALLISON is lying on her back on the couch with her head in HEATHER's

lap. Heather is stroking Allison's hair.

They're both obliterated and just stuttering away.

Allison sits up on the couch. Heather sits up directly facing

Allison, her hands on Allison's lap.

Heather hugs Allison, who hugs back.    Both are bawling as they

embrace.

WIDE on Heather and Allison. The noise of the party drowns out

their conversation. Allison is whispering forcefully into Heather's

ear. Heather is listening, but cannot hear. We see her lips form

the word "what?" Allison continues whispering, and Heather's face

becomes furious. She pushes Allison back.

Heather shoves Allison hard off the couch. As Allison stumbles

roughly and attempts to recover, PARTYGOERS, mostly guys, gather

around, cheering wildly. Heather kicks furiously at Allison, who is

on all fours employing the turtle defense. We catch a glimpse of

Allison's face - she is in utter panic. Heather's foot catches

Allison square in the face, knocking her limp.

Most of the crowd has stopped cheering. Heather continues to kick

at Allison's limp body, and two SKINNY GUYS pull Heather away.

Heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff, while everyone is

tending to Allison.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, HALLWAY -- MOMENT'S LATER

HEATHER, visibly psychotic, and still very drunk, is making a

beeline straight for RJ, who shows no sign of noticing Heather until

she is directly in front of him.

Heather heads towards Berubi's bedroom, and RJ follows, passing

JIMMY and BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES. Jimmy looks back at RJ as he

passes.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Jimmy reenters the room he retreated from earlier, with Bobby in

tow. The room is empty.

Jimmy steps further into the room and stands pensive as Bobby takes

a seat. Bobby lights up a CIGARETTE.

The door bursts open again with a violent thrash, and LOUIE fires

into view on his WHEELCHAIR with SINJIN pushing from behind.

Sinjin kicks the door shut with the back of his foot and wheels

Louie into the room. Louie is holding a half-full bottle of JACK

DANIELS in his hand, the BOWLING BALL BAG still in his lap.

Sinjin wheels Louie in a haphazard, indirect arc somehow closing on

the center of the room. The doorknob rattles.

Sinjin is staring at the door, but Louie is pre-occuppied.

Louie takes a strong pull from the bottle of Jack.

Bobby stands, tosses his Cigarette aside, and marches toward Louie.

Sinjin knowingly looses his grip on the Wheelchair and steps back.

Bobby grabs Louie by the collar and throws him from the Wheelchair.

Louis lands heavily on his crippled frame, dazed, the Bowling Ball

Bag dribbling onto the floor near Sinjin. Bobby grabs the

Wheelchair in both hands and begins smashing it against the wall and

into the floor.

As Jimmy and Sinjin watch, dumbfounded, the large clay LAWN DWARF we

saw earlier bursts trough the window and lands in the center of the

room. Everyone stops to stare at the Lawn Dwarf, including Bobby.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT

JESSICA storms through the yard toward Carlos' CAR.   CARLOS is right

behind.

Carlos begins walking over to his CAR, and Jessica walks alongside.

Jessica is clearly drunk. Passing by a now high EMILY backed up

against a tree staring off into nowhere as MALE PARTYGOER 1 kisses

her neck, they arrive at Carlos' Car. Carlos walks over to the

driver-side door, but Jessica walks immediately over to the trunk.

Carlos grudgingly obeys. He walks back to the trunk and inserts his

KEY, then lifts up. Jessica reaches in and grabs a wooden baseball

BAT. She shuts the trunk and looks over to the house.

AARON walks through Carter's front door and steps onto the porch,

TROY right behind. Aaron is holding a bag of FROZEN VEGETABLES to

his head in the area where Jessica hit him with the whiskey bottle.

He spots Carlos and Jessica, and walks deliberately toward them.

Carlos swallows his pride, too yellow to push the point. Aaron

moves toward Jessica very quickly, but a look at the bat Jessica is

holding makes Aaron keep his distance.

Jessica stands back and holds the bat in a cocked position.

Aaron drops the Frozen Vegetables to the ground and loosens his

pants.

Aaron lowers the left side of his pants to reveal a scarring TATTOO,

which is placed above and to the side of his groin. Jessica looks

closer. Troy, uncomfortable and not wanting to be there, lights up

another CIGARETTE.

Jessica lowers the Bat and walks cautiously up to Aaron. She

attempts to read the Tattoo, which is difficult because of the low

light and the scarring.

Jessica touches the Tattoo.

Jessica laughs as Aaron smiles. Troy is bored. Carlos is

miserable. Jessica stands up in front of Aaron, holding the Bat

loosely by her side, unsure of what to do. Aaron gently grabs

Jessica around the elbows and pulls her close. He puts his arms

around her and hugs her loosely.

Aaron hugs Jessica tightly as she drops the Bat and hugs back.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT

EMILY, her back up against a tree, continues making out with an

aggressive MALE PARTYGOER 1. As MALE PARTYGOER 1 comes up for air,

we see that he has a hand down Emily's pants, fingering her.

Emily's mind is somewhere else.

Emily snaps back to reality and removes Male Partygoer 1's hand and

pushes him away from her - she won't become another slut in a town

full of them.

Emily makes for the front door and into the house.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT

MITCH has refilled his BEER and patiently waits for a counteroffer

from COREY.

Impatient with the proceedings, PEDRO walks over to the passenger

door of the Mustang, swings it open, and leans inside, struggling a

bit.

Pedro reappears from the backseat, holding an expensive STEREO.

Corey walks over, opens the door and looks in the back.   His gaze

falls upon an item on the floor in the back seat area.

Corey pulls out from the back seat of the Mustang holding a large

red and blue POLICE LIGHT. He is dumbfounded. Corey looks to Pedro

for an explanation.

Corey and Pedro struggle for an explanation, but are left

speechless.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT

JESSICA and AARON are leaning against a random partygoer's CAR.

They look very calm.

Two POLICE CARS pull onto the lawn to break up the party, both cars

flashing their red and blue lights. TROY approaches Jessica and

Aaron.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS

COREY, PEDRO and MITCH notice a POLICE CAR containing POLICE OFFICER

1 and POLICE OFFICER 2 as it pulls into the back yard. Pedro is

still holding the STEREO. PARTYGOERS carry on, barely concerned

that the police are breaking up the party. Police Officer 2 spots

the MUSTANG hitched to the TOW TRUCK, a look of knowing recognition

on his face.

Police Officer 1 speaks into the C.B.

From far off, Corey understands from the manner that the police

officers have focused on the Mustang that they've been spotted.

Police Officer 2 rushes out of the car, followed by Police Officer

1.

Pedro turns to Mitch.

Pedro practically throws the Stereo into Mitch's stomach. Mitch,

completely shocked, drops his BEER and grabs the stereo out of

instinct. Pedro darts for the passenger seat of the Tow Truck.

COREY moves to the driver-side door of the Tow Truck and opens it,

and climbs behind the wheel. Pedro climbs into the passenger seat.

Corey starts the Tow Truck and tries to shift it into gear.

Pedro grabs the stick shift and throws it into first.

Corey hits the gas, and the transmission screeches its disapproval.

The Tow Truck conks out.

Pedro opens the door and jumps out.   Corey remains seated, frozen,

hands on the dashboard.

POLICE OFFICER 1 quickly overtakes Pedro and throws him to the

ground. POLICE OFFICER 2 rushes over to the Tow Truck and points

his GUN at Corey.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BERUBI'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

HEATHER and RJ are in Berubi's bedroom. Heather is on top of RJ,

and the sex is extremely rough. Heather notices the RED AND BLUE

LIGHTS continue flashing on the curtains, staring, entranced by

them. RJ looks up to see what she's staring at.

Heather does not respond as she continues bouncing up and down on

top of RJ.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT

COREY gets out of the truck, hands in the air. POLICE OFFICER 1

HANDCUFFS PEDRO. POLICE OFFICER 2 takes out his HANDCUFFS, spins

Corey around by his arm, and throws him roughly against the tow

truck, cuffing his hands behind his back. In the background, MITCH

quietly places the stereo on the ground and begins walking

indiscreetly toward the street.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

POV on JIMMY, BOBBY, SINJIN and LOUIE staring at the wall opposite

the door. Bobby is still holding what's left of Louie's WHEELCHAIR.

Sinjin throws his hands up in disgust/disbelief.

We see what they're staring at - KWON is climbing clumsily through

the window. A large GUN falls heavily to the floor and KWON falls

in after it.

Kwon grabs his Gun and stands up, slightly out of breath from his

climb.

Jimmy watches, powerless.

>From O.S. a CHINESE STRESS BALL hits Kwon in the forehead. Dazed,

Kwon can only blink his eyes tries to gather his senses. Bobby

stares at Kwon a moment before landing his large fist square on

Kwon's nose, knocking him empty-handed and on his ass beside Sinjin.

Sinjin stands up to get between Bobby and Kwon.

BANG! Everybody freezes as the sound and smoke of a gunshot

lingers, then checks to make sure they weren't hit. As doorknob

starts rattling with increasing intensity, everyone checks to make

sure they weren't hit, then turns to the source of the gunshot.

Louie is holding the Gun as he lays on his side, having scrambled to

grab the Gun.

The door bursts open - it's RJ, out of breath.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS

POLICE OFFICER 1 is using one hand to hold onto PEDRO, still

HANDCUFFED, by his upper arm, and the other hand to unlock and open

the rear driver side door of his POLICE CAR. POLICE OFFICER 2

watches as he keeps hold of COREY by his HANDCUFFS.

The two officers hasten their actions. Police Officer 1 lowers

Pedro into the Police Car, then moves to the front seat of the

vehicle and grabs the C.B.

INT. POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Police Officer 2 shoves Corey into the POLICE CAR next to Pedro.

Corey and Pedro sit in the rear of the police car, and Police

Officer 2 slams the door. Through the windshield we see Police

Officer 2 run toward the house as he draws his PISTOL.   He moves up

the porch past...

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- NIGHT

DEREK walks up the steps onto the back porch as PARTYGOERS move out

of the house away from the sound of the gunshot. He notices POLICE

OFFICER 2 behind him.

Derek and Police Officer 2 turn to see HEATHER walking onto the back

porch from the kitchen.

Heather interrupts Derek's statement with a swift, unexpected knee

to Derek's groin. Derek doubles over, and Heather grabs him by the

hair.

Police Officer 2 shoves Heather to the ground, grabs Derek's

HANDCUFFS, and cuffs her hands behind her. Derek is still stunned

from the assault.

ALLISON, who had been standing back watching the assault, approaches

Heather, who is getting up onto her knees. Allison gets on her

knees and hugs Heather, who cannot hug back because of the

handcuffs. Allison is bawling.

Heather is shutting her eyes extremely tightly, struggling not to

cry. She does not attempt to pull away from Allison's tight

embrace.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

SINJIN marches straight toward LOUIE, who wears the pathetic look of

a child about to be disciplined.

Sinjin grabs the GUN from Louie. KWON is sitting up, still dazed,

holding a HANDKERCHIEF to stem the flow of blood streaming out of

his nose.

Sinjin turns to inspect the room, contemplating the situation.   He

walks toward Jimmy's BACKPACK.

RJ drops Louie out the window like a sack of bird seed, Louie is

followed by the remains of his wheelchair, then by RJ himself. Kwon

stands up and grabs the bowling ball bag.

Sinjin disappears out the window.   Bobby is about to follow, but

turns back toward Jimmy.

Bobby exits.   Kwon stands over Jimmy.

Jimmy watches as Kwon exits out the window.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS

Most of the PARTYGOERS are clearing out of the house moving toward

their cars, but some of the more curious STRAGGLERS are gathering

around on the back porch, wondering what happened. POLICE OFFICER 1

is encouraging everyone to leave.

Police Officer 1 enters the house, passing CARLOS among the crowd

making it's way out of the house. He walks across the back yard

with his KEYS in his hand. He glances down at his shoes a moment as

he spots JESSICA, AARON and TROY approaching. JIMMY enters and

moves across the frame toward his PIECE-OF-SHIT parked in the rear

of the back yard.

Carlos walks off toward his CAR, and Jessica, Aaron and Troy walk

toward Troy's CAR.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S OLD BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

POLICE OFFICER 2 is looking through Jerry's old bedroom, noticing

the hole in the wall. We can hear POLICE OFFICER 1 knocking on the

bathroom door in the hallway.

We move past Police Officer 2 out into the hallway toward the

noise...

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Policer Officer 1 is opening the bathroom door, gun raised, and is

stopped dead in his tracks by what he sees...

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Two legs are hanging out the side of the bathtub, belonging to a

girl whose the rest of whose body is obscured from view.

Police Officer 1 drops his gun to his side and steps into the

bathroom, staring down into the bathtub.

Police Officer 2 walks up into the bathroom, noticing the BULLET

HOLE in the wall just beside the mirror.

We see what they do - EMILY is lying back across the width of the

bathtub, eyes open but utterly vacant, a gunshot wound through her

cheek just below her cheekbone.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

CARTER is moving from the living room toward the bedrooms.     POLICE

OFFICER 1 stops him.

Carter is persistent, and Police Officer 1 puts his hands up against

Carter.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Some of the STRAGGLERS are still scattered throughout the side of

the house opposite the bedrooms and bathroom. BERUBI is forcefully

waving them out of the house.

The Stragglers exit out the front door.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- CONTINUOUS

STRAGGLERS are heading out the front door, joining the other

PARTYGOERS in looking for their cars.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS

STRAGGLERS   are heading out the back door, joining the other

PARTYGOERS   in looking for their cars, and for their friends. A few

Partygoers   remain continue to loiter in groups scattered sparsely

throughout   the yard.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

HEATHER is seated in the back of a POLICE CAR with her hands cuffed

behind her back.

INT. POLICE CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Heather's body is contorted to her side to relieve the discomfort

caused by the HANDCUFFS. Through the window facing Carter's house

we see a figure approaching. As the figure nears, we recognize

DEREK, seemingly recovered from his earlier thrashing. Heather does

not notice Derek as he nears the door. Derek opens the door.

Heather looks up at him.

Derek pulls Heather from the police car, and the exhausted Heather

gives only nominal resistance. Derek unlocks her handcuffs.

Heather turns around.

Heather walks past Derek, and Derek does not turn to follow her.

Heather notices ALLISON standing several car lengths away. Allison

has her arms crossed across her body as if she were hugging herself

for warmth, both her and Heather's purses strapped over her

shoulder, her KEYS dangling from her hand. Heather begins walking

slowly towards Allison, passing by...

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS

COREY and PEDRO are seated in the back of the POLICE CAR. Corey

looks over at Pedro- the look of foolish optimism usually present on

Pedro's face has vanished. He looks down at the floor of the Police

Car.

Through the side window of the Police Car we see JESSICA, AARON, and

TROY and climbing into Troy's CAR. Troy is handing Aaron his KEYS

before climbing into the back seat.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- CONTINUOUS

Aaron is behind the wheel sticking the Keys into the ignition.

Jessica is in the passenger seat looking through her PURSE for her

CIGARETTES. Troy sits in the back seat, spent.

Aaron starts the car as Jessica lights her Cigarette. Without

warning, as Jessica takes a drag, Aaron punches Jessica square in

the jaw. The lit Cigarette flies out of Jessica's mouth, and

Jessica falls out of view. Aaron reaches down, grabs the Cigarette

and puts it in his mouth, still angry.

He slowly pulls the car out of the back yard and toward the street,

passing Jimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT parked in the opposite direction.

The engine is still off. JIMMY is sitting still behind the wheel,

hands down in his lap, staring straight ahead. PULL IN and HOLD on

Jimmy.

EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT with the house IN FOCUS in the background. A few

STRAGGLERS remain in the backyard, smoking cigarettes, gossiping,

staring back at the house, etc. RACK FOCUS to a group of stragglers

in the foreground to the right of the frame, STRAGGLER 1 and

STRAGGLER 2 smoking CIGARETTES among them. Straggler 2 flicks his

Cigarette and leads all of the group except Straggler 1 frame left

toward the street. Straggler 1 glances back at the house before

taking a final puff of his Cigarette. He stomps it out under his

foot and exits frame left after his buddies. HOLD on the house OUT

OF FOCUS.

THE END
