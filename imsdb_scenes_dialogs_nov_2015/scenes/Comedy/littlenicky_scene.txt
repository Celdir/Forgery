FADE IN:

EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT

A beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers

sprinkling.

We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,

where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He

has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly

the lights turn on.

We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's

window.  She is wearing business attire.

The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing

her feet.

He sips some wine.

The mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off,

revealing a nice bra.

The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing

the words as he goes.

The mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks

in wearing a scouts uniform.

The son talks to his mother excitedly.

The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.

The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son

answers.

The peeper gets nervous.

The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.

We SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He

shoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls

to the ground with a thud.

The peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television

out the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead.

INT. HOLE - DAY

The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on

all sides.

The peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way

screaming like a five-year old girl.

PEEPER'S POV

We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the

peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He

SCREAMS.

EXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL

We see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.  We hear screaming.  Wham!

We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in

a heap in a shallow pit of coals.

Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the

fire wall at different levels.  (NOTE: All the arrivals

clothes are now burned & shredded).

The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his

station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.

A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.  We

leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...

MATTE PAINTING HELL

MUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALEN

The VAST and insane kingdom of Hell.  A road leads toward it

like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  We see

the black castle in the distance.  The camera zooms into the

castle, to one particular window.

INT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY

Looks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,

heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no

bed - Devils don't sleep).  Nicky is air guitaring to the

song.  Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled

"NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX."

The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring

NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.

INT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

ADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.  They're aiming for

people's faces that are coming through the wall.

He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.

Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS

in the eye.

Cassius pulls out the dart.  The eye comes with it.

Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.  THWACK!

It splatters like a grape.

Nicky enters sheepishly.

Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.

Cassius' eyes start glowing red.

Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible

force.

Nicky's head slams back down again.

He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the

head.

Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his

own crotch.

Nicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer

until it latches on to Nicky's crotch.

Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own

hand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't

notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small

devil horns), enters behind them.

Cassius releases Nicky's hand.

Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the

nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the

floor.

Dad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of

confidence and power.

He leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the

window the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his

head.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad

closes the curtains.

Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of

his throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip

of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at

his three sons.

Confused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.

Jimmy the Demon walks in.

He whispers in Dad's ear.

Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention

back to his sons.

They all look at Nicky.

Dad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human

Dartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the

tongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch.

Nicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.  Adrian stops.

HITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by

Jimmy.  They head towards the closet.

Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out

a relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head "no."  Dad walks

over to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.

Dad nods "yes."  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends

Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...

CLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES

As the pineapple's jammed up his ass.

EXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY

Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing

with souls.  Both are pissed.  There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot

looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.

Adrian turns to the Monster.

Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face.

The Monster shrugs and walks off.

Cassius throws a rock at the Monster.  He yelps, then turns

around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.

Cassius sees this and gets enraged.

The Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in

an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.

Cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.

The two look at each other.  They start running toward the

fire wall.  Knocking souls out of their way.

They get closer to the fire.

They dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES.

Sirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we

hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the

firewall hard.

INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

Dad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix

tapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb."

Pause.  Dad exhales.

Hits the tape player.  "Enter Sandman" blasts.

Dad and Nicky dance to the song.

INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

CLOSE ON DAD.

ON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.

Dan exits.

Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint

sirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his

knees.

The Gatekeeper stands up.

Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge

boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We

only see them from the front for a second.

From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the

nipples as he talks to Nicky.

Dad is staring off.  He looks shaken.

GRANDPA LUCIFER enters.

The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer.

EXT. GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTER

We see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED

SOULS in hell are sneaking off.

The DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do.

Dad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.

We keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud

thuds.

Dad holds up his hand.  His pink is hanging by a thread.  We

see the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.

The MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as

if to say, "oh no."

Dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.

Dad's pinky is hanging.  Jimmy pulls it off and examines it.

The Monster gags.

Nicky looks petrified.

Nicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster,

who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire.

Nicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster

taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get

a move on."

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

A SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL

PAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between

two tracks, to a putrid puddle.  Nicky breaks through the

surface, sputtering.  We hear a rumbling in the near

distance.

Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and

WHAMMM!

Nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in

the coal pit.  His Dad limps back to him.

Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

Nicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and

hops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is

stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side.

In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to

identify their passengers at the airport.  On the sign is

scrawled "NICKY."

Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat.

Beefy drops the sign from his mouth.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - DAY

The throng of commuters making their way through the terminal

are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking

around suspiciously, talking to the dog.

Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat.

EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

A BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.  People put

money in his pot.

We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.  The PREACHER

sniffs.

He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.

He gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance.  He

disappears.  Beefy turns to Nicky.

EXT. BENCH - DAY

K-mart bag is next to a bench.  PAN UP to see Nicky wearing

an extra warm SKI OUTFIT.  Sitting next to him on the bench

is Beefy.  Between them is a big bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED

CHICKEN.  Nicky takes out a drumstick.

Nicky puts it in his mouth.  Holds it there.

Nicky does.  He chews for a long time.

Nicky does.  He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.

NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right

into the path of a moving bus.

INT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

The Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs.  The

gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra.  He seems to be

enjoying it.  We hear a THUD.  They look down to see Nicky on

the ground.  (We didn't see him flying through this time.)

The Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop.  Kind of

embarrassed.

Nicky turns and walks toward the firewall.  As soon as his

back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I

love your boobs."  The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh

(we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).

EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY

Beefy is walking with him down the street.  Nicky is crazy

cautious.

INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

Beefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club.  Champagne

is on the table.  Bills in his mouth.  We see THREE DANCERS

dancing for him.

EXT. VILLAGE STREET

Nicky and Beefy.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

A scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the

phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village.

Todd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by

his side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.

Nicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both

nod imperceptibly.

Nicky laughs a little too hard.

Todd turns and goes into the apartment.

The door closes.  Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  It

reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.  Beefy raises his leg over

it.

INT. NICKY'S ROOM

Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully

clothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that

familiar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we

hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices.

SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands,

looking concerned.

EXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING

We HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a

large church.

INT. CATHEDRAL

CLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the

steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation.

We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He

gins his homily.

The crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is

standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box

with the top open.

A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.

A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up.

Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts

to "raise the roof."  Then thinks better of it.  The Cardinal

points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.

The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.

A hubbub is raised by the crowd.  Fitzie raises the roof

again, this time energetically.

The hubbub grows to a roar.  Several PEOPLE start fighting

over the money in the collection plate.

The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.  We hear the

Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.

ON MAYOR

He's smirking.  WE HEAR his telepathic response.

The Mayor/Cassius laughs.  As he does, his eyes slowly cross.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.  PAN OVER TO:

Nicky, his pants around his ankles.  He's trying to do the

same.

Nicky looks at the next person walking by.  It's a CHINESE

DELIVERY GUY on a bicycle.  Nicky clotheslines him, taking

him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock.

Nicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips.

The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick

to the head and runs away.  Nicky gets up.

Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the

bottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Nicky approaches various people as they pass.  (To be shot

long lense, real people, real reactions.)

INT. POPEYE'S - DAY

Nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the

Cashier to drink.  The Cashier yanks his head away and gives

Nicky a dirty look.  Nicky shrugs and points to the menu,

ordering some chicken.

EXT. STREET - DAY

nicky walks up to a homeless man.  He thrusts the bottle in

his face.  To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes

it and drinks.  Nothing happens.  Nicky is baffled.  He tries

to take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  Finally he

grabs it away from him.  The man starts throwing garbage at

Nicky as he walks away.

INT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY

Beefy is looking around for Nicky.  He spots him - inside the

polar bear cage.  Nicky approaches the bear holding the

flask.

INT. HELL - MOMENTS LATER

Nicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again.

The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs.

The Monster laughs.

The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels.

The Monster howls with delight.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a

Popeye's drumstick.

Beefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores.  He's asleep.

Beefy sighs.

Beefy walks away.

EXT. VARIOUS CENTRAL PARK LOCATIONS - DAY

Nicky snores.  Masses of birds fly out of the trees.  Nicky

snores.  Squirrels run out of trees.  Nicky snores.

ON WORRIED PEOPLE

Staring at Nicky who continues to snore.  Two HEAVY-METAL

GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a

goofy dance.  They hear something and turn the music down:

it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore.

Nicky snores.  It sounds like "I will eat your hearts."  The

worried people run away.  Nicky snores.  Children on the

Carousel, going real fast, upset.  Nicky snores.

Peter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench.

A sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky.  He eyes

the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket.

Suddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten

drumstick) and runs off.

Peter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud

SNORT.

Nicky feels for the flask.  It's gone.

Fire shoots out of Nicky's mouth.

Nicky is about to run off.  Looks at John's shirt.

He runs off.

EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

Nicky is searching the street for his flask.  He walks past

several STREET VENDORS who have set up their wares on the

sidewalk.  PAUSE.  Nicky comes walking back into frame as he

sees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the

blanket of the VENDOR.

The street vendor stands, very angry.

A YUPPIE JOGGER is checking out the flask.

He walks away.

We see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.

The vendor makes an even crazier face at Nicky and starts

swinging his fists around.

Nearby, VALERIE, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is

selling clothes off a spread out blanket.  She notices what's

going on.

Nicky's eyes widen in panic.  Just then, Valerie steps in.

Valerie points to a cop across the street.  The Street Vendor

ponders this for a second, then...

The vendor does crazy eyes again.

Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.

Valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky

follows her.

She laughs along with him, not sure why.

Nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.  He

hands her the half-eaten drumstick.

Nicky laughs.

EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

They exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati.

Valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky.  Just

then the PREACHER walks by.  He quickly turns his head,

sensing Nicky.

He takes off running right into a lamp post.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

Beefy is screwing a female dog from behind.

EXT. STREET - VALERIE & NICKY CONTINUOUS - DAY

He takes her wrist to his nose.  He stares at it, licks it.

Nicky stops and looks at her.

EXT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

The Gatekeeper is near the frozen fall.  We hear loud

wailing, moaning, etc., coming from the other side.

The Monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather

biker's hat.  He nods along in agreement.

PAN TO LUCIFER

Who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of

fire/pond.

The Monster laughs really hard.

The Monster laughs even harder.

We hear the Monster laughing again as we PAN DOWN Grandpa's

fishing line to:

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

We SEE a MINIATURE PEEPER squirming on the fish hook.  A

giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body.  Only his head

is sticking out.

EXT. BAR - DOWN THE STREET - DAY

Several ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS stumble out, drunk.

They both high five, throw up and fall.  PAN over to ADRIAN

sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle

of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.

Adrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with

Valerie.  He's shocked.

Valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her

collection.

Valerie laughs.

Up the street, Adrian's eyes redden.  NICKY looks like he's

been stunned by something.

Adrian's eyes flashing.

Valerie's very hurt.

She turns and walks away.  Nicky looks over and sees Adrian.

His inner voice speaks to him.

Adrian's eyes flash.

She stops and turns.  Nicky RAISES his fist to resist

Adrian's force.  It's too much.  His middle finger comes up,

giving her the "finger."

She runs away crying.  Nicky turns to Adrian who's still

across the street.

Adrian processes this.

Nicky's body jerks around.

Nicky, fighting control over his body, walks slowly and

crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large

truck bearing down on him.

JOHN and PETER get blood splattered on them.  Peter looks

down to see the "666" forms in blood on their clothes.

They laugh and hi-five.

ON THE TV - DAY

Nicky frowns and bites his lip.  The can rattles a little.

Todd is standing in the doorway.  Beefy runs to the fire

escape.

THREE LITTLE GIRLS singing "Ring Around The Rosie" as he

exhales.

Nicky stands and moves to the window.  He looks out longingly

over the sleeping city... achingly.  RACK FOCUS behind him,

we see Todd nodding encouragingly in the reflection.

EXT. PARSON'S SCHOOL OF DESIGN - NIGHT

Nicky walks around the corner.

SIGN READS: "Parson's School -  Student Housing"

Nicky is standing in front of the dorm rooms.  He looks up.

Scanning the windows, he picks up a scent.

Nicky goes to the fire escape and starts to climb.  His nose

leads him.  He reaches the window, sniffing heavily.

INT. DORM ROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

A STUDENT is standing in the window draped in silks, feeling

Nicky nods and floats off.

EXT. VALERIE'S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER

Nicky crouches outside her window and peers in.

INT. VALERIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cool music.  She is up late.  Working by candlelight on a

fantastic design.  Something's not working.  She drapes a

beautiful fabric over another.  She smiles at the

combination.  She is happy being creative.  Nicky feels his

heart swell as he watches her.

ON NICKY

He's so enraptured he leans forward trying to kiss her.  His

head bumps the window.  She turns, startled.  She sees the

beaming Nicky.

Pause.  Valerie opens the window and sprays a can of mace

right in Nicky's face.

Nicky stands up and stumbles around.

He bounces off the front rail, stumbles backward and goes

flying over the back rail.

He's floating up.  He slows down.

CUT TO REVEAL he's floating outside the student's window.

The student's dripping candle wax on his belly.

Nicky resumes floating up.

Nicky is parallel with her.  He hovers in front of her, eyes

still watering.  She punches Nicky in the face, and he flies

back ten feet.

His vision is clearing and he can start to see her.  She is

totally in shock but still here.

Nicky laughs.  Valerie joins in.

We hear the Ozz on stage in his encore.  He is singing "Mr.

Crowley."  Nicky turns to Valerie.

Nicky's jaw drops as he stares at her.

They slow dance tighter.  The music swells.  John and Peter

look up from their seats far below.  Nicky sees them while

he's holding her tight.  They give thumbs up.

EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

Feeling great.  Spring in his step, we see Nicky walking down

the street.

He stops and smells some flowers at a Korean Tommet.  The

KOREANS point and seem agitated by him.  Nicky gives them a

friendly wave.

The Koreans just glare.  Nicky's confused.

MUSIC CUE:

A dissonant, nervous score accompanies the rest of the

sequence.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A NUT VENDOR leaves his cart and starts following.  Nicky

looks back a little, unnerved.  A TAXI screeches in front of

him.  The DRIVER gets out and goes after him.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A group of school girls in uniform break loose from their

teacher and start chasing Nicky.

A gigantically fat guy sees Nicky run by.  He thinks about

candy bar instead.

Ten guys playing wheelchair basketball see Nicky.  They point

and start wheeling after him.

EXT. HILLY STREET - DAY

Nicky is putting some distance between him and the mob.

But when he heads downhill, the GUYS IN WHEELCHAIRS start to

catch up.  They get closer and closer until... Nicky makes a

last second right turn into an alley.  The wheelchairs can't

slow down and crash into a double decker tourist BUS at the

bottom of the street.  The TOURIST on the top level look over

the edge to see the crash.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

Nicky is panicking, out of breath.  A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up

out of his cardboard box.  The bum raises his bottle and

thunks Nicky on the head.  It doesn't break.

The bum holds up a NEW YORK POST.  It reads "MONSTER WANTED!"

And has a picture of Nicky.  Nicky is shocked.

Nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there

blocking the entrance.  He's trapped.  They start running

right at him.  He closes his eyes.

Nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying

insects, all with a miniature NICKY HEAD.

The Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows

immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked

out.

INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY

Beefy and Todd are watching TV.  They look over to see the

insects scurry under the front door and morph back into one

exhausted Nicky.

ON THE TV - DAY

We see Dan Rather addressing the camera.

We see the chief of police behind a bunch of mics.  He's

holding up a picture of Nicky taken at the Basketball arena.

A LOUD KNOCKING AT THE DOOR

The pounding increases.

Nicky opens the door.  Peter and John stumble in.

We hear VOICES of an approaching crowd coming outside.

Todd i s looking out the window.

VOICES GROW LOUDER.

John takes Nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen

counter.  Nicky is dazed.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Nicky is in the bathtub being angrily drowned by Todd.  John

and Peter watch happily.

Nicky's arm comes out with a thumbs up.  Pause.  The hand

drops back in.  He's dead.

INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

Start on a CLOSE UP of Lucifer.  He's holding cards, looking

at his hand.

The Demons and Gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip

poker.  The Gatekeeper takes off his bra.  From behind, we

see his breasts flop out.

The Gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out.  The

Monster laughs uproariously.  Nicky enters and moves to

what's left of his dad.  Arms, torso, and a head (with one

ear).

Dad's remaining ear falls out.

Jimmy picks up the ear.  Jimmy speaks into it.

Nicky looks very upset.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

We see John and Peter enter frame.  Looking very nervous.

They approach the cops guarding the door.

COPS grab John & Peter and drag them inside.

INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

Surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room,

the chief of police puts down his bottle of PEPPERMINT

SCHNAPPS, stands up and looks at the two idiots.

He nods to a DEPUTY who gives them a briefcase of money.

PAUSE.  The chief LAUGHS, then everyone else does.  He walks

over and picks them up by their throats.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

We see the BIG CLOCK on the wall.  FIVE minutes til NOON.  We

see JOHN and PETER (with the briefcase) walking into GRAND

CENTRAL with the chief and twenty-five NYC cops.  The chief

bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack.

They march through onto the platform for Track 33.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

We see Beefy and Todd waiting by the place where Nicky

usually comes up.  It is hot down there.  Steam and smoke

comes out of the tunnels.  Todd is nervous.

They hear FOOTSTEPS.  They turn and see the chief of police

backed up by the huge police force.

Beefy and Todd turn to see John and Peter looking sheepish.

Peter and John high-five.

The police grab Todd and put a leash on Beefy.  The cops lead

their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving John and Peter

alone with the chief.

The chief inserts a finger into his nostril.  Then he fits

his hand up there.  Soon his whole arm is up his nostril as

he searches for something.  John and Peter are impressed.

The chief grabs something and starts to pull.  Then out of

his nose comes Adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the

chief's body slumps to the ground.

They look at the clock.  It's noon.

Peter is sweating, kinda nervous.

They high five.  Adrian smiles and waits.  It is real hot

down there.  We hear a train coming in the distance.  A fan

circles slowly.  They all wait for him.

We see the HOMELESS LADY down the platform stumbling her way

towards them, drunk.  Adrian scowls at her.

Peter pushes her away.

John and Peter high five and John swigs from the bag.

Adrian raises his eyebrows.  We see that the homeless lady is

actually VALERIE in disguise.  She looks back, tense.  John

offers Adrian the flask.

Hands it to him.  He takes it.

Adrian smiles at John, then raises the bag.  He stops just

before it hits his lips.  He looks at John curiously.

Adrian stares at John.  He raises the bag again.

John starts to tremble a bit.

Adrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John.  Nicky/John

wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles.

Nicky comes flying out.  John's body slumps to the floor next

to the chief's.  Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see

the flask wrapped in paper.  He peeks inside.

Adrian hands Nicky the flask.

He puts the Flask in Nicky's hands.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - MOMENTS LATER

The police are escorting Beefy and Todd through the terminal.

Beefy starts whining and stops.  The cops look down.  Beefy

raises his leg.

A thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the

group.  Beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs.

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

Adrian stares down Nicky.

Adrian looks over at Valerie.  Suddenly she comes flying over

to him.  He grabs her by the throat.

We hear a train coming in the distance.

The train sound is coming CLOSER.  Valerie looks at Nicky.

Nicky raises the flash to drink.

We see Beefy skid to a stop, raise his leg and a full size

archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into

ADRIAN'S LEG.

Valerie is able to escape momentarily.  Adrian reaches for

her, grabbing her.  They both spin and fall down onto the

tracks.  Right into the oncoming train.

Nicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from

Adrian and tosses her off the tracks.  Adrian looks at Nicky.

WHAMM!  The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky.

INT. HELL GATES - CONTINUOUS

Adrian comes flying through the solid firefall into Hell.  He

looks around.  Confused, there's no Nicky.

EXT. BEAUTIFUL FIELD - DAY

Nicky is lying in a huge field of tall, very green grass.  He

sits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there.

Nicky looks around, alarmed.  He seems to be in a mountain

vale, maybe in the foothills of the Alps.  It's gorgeous.

Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday

cake.  Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating

down to him.

EXT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

The cake lands softly in front of him, the door ajar.  After

a moment's hesitation, Nicky goes in.

INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

Nicky enters the cake to find ANGEL and two friends: JENNA

and CHRISTA.  They are doing arts and crafts sort of things

on a glass table in front of them.  They stare at him.  Angel

rises.

Nicky trails off as he sees the Angels laughing at him.

The Angel and two friends laugh and high-five.  Nicky's

confused.

Nicky is floored.

The GIRLS start laughing.

Nicky is even more floored.  FLASH.  Jenna has taken a

picture of Nicky.

They laugh.  Nicky is quite baffled.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

Dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up

by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne.

Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand

around.

Adrian enters.  They all cheer.

Puts the Gatekeeper in a headlock.

He twists a breast.  The Gatekeeper babbles out the

information immediately.

Adrian twists hard.

Adrian throws him down.

He moves to the throne and throws the lips off.

He pushes Lucifer out of the way.

He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.  He

grins as two horns grow out of his forehead.

The demons approach.

The demons stop.  Now loyal to Adrian.  All except Jimmy.

INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

Everyone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes.

There's a knock on the door. It opens and in comes Carl

Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore.

Chubbs dances as he leaves.

The Angels laugh.

Her cell-phone rings.  She answers it.

Angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops.

Angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in

front of them.  Angel touches the glass and it turns into a

reflection of Earth below.

EXT. TIME'S SQUARE - NIGHT

People are rioting in the streets.  Looting appliance

stores...

EXT. CENTRAL PARK LAWN - NIGHT

People are drinking and smoking and burning things.  A large

circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist

fighting.  One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then

jumps on her and starts wailing away.  The spectators

exchange money.

Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian

on his throne start to be thrust upwards.  Demons swarm

around him.

INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

DAD LIPS are morosely talking to the Gatekeeper and Jimmy.

She touches the pool again and the reflection changes to:

EXT. NEW HELL THRONE - NIGHT

Adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by SIX

HERO DEMONS.  He begins addressing the crowd.

The crowd cheers.

The crowd cheers.

EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - NIGHT

We see John, Peter, Beefy, Valerie and Todd hanging on

flagpoles by their underwear.  Beefy is in a special fitted

harness that looks like underwear.

Adrian morphs into the Cardinal from earlier.

EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad

and they get scared.

The Preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through

the plate glass window (ask Steve), yells out.

This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to

run away.  But they are stopped and herded back by DEMONS.

EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

Valerie's crying.

INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

Nicky is shocked.

INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

Adrian is looking at a clock tower that reads 11:45.

Adrian scans the crowd.  He sees...

EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

The Parsons STUDENT in the kimono dancing sexily.  Adrian is

thrown.

EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Adrian motions to some of his guards.  They nod.

A frightened HENRY WINKLER is lead onto the stage prodded by

two DEMONS.

EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

The scared bad people finally smile.

EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

We see Henry Winkler is suddenly covered head to in a swarm

of bees.

EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

The crowd gasps.

INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

Nicky is starting to panic.

The girls laugh.

She gives him an ornate, jewelled ball.

She licks her finger and wipes some dirt off his forehead.

Nicky hugs his Mom.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK POND SHORE - NIGHT

Nicky dissolves into walking.  He checks his pocket to see

the ball.  He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards

him, ready to attack.  Nicky closes his eyes and

concentrates.

When he opens them, BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES are floating around

the head of five of the DEMONS.  They stop approaching.

THEIR EYES TURN FROM WHITE BACK TO NORMAL.  And their facial

expression changes to happiness.  They wave at the

butterflies.

ANGLE ON

MORE DEMONS keep closing.

Five more are stopped by something.  They look down and see

fluffy white BUNNY RABBITS at their feet.  They start petting

them.

The REMAINING DEMONS advance on Nicky.

...then stop, their path blocked by a very large bucket of

POPEYE'S FRIED CHICKEN.  The Demons consider the bucket of

chicken.  One Demon takes out a piece.

The Demon bites into it.  He can't help but grin a little.

The OTHER SOULS dig into the bucket.

EXT. CLOCK TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Only ten minutes left.

EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

The dudes on the flagpoles are chatting nervously.

ANGLE ON:

The student dancing for a mesmerized Demon.

BACK ON PETER, TODD and JOHN

EXT. CENTRAL PARK PATH - NIGHT

Nicky leads his small army of reformed Demons (followed by

butterflies & bunnies and carrying the chicken bucket) down

the path toward the rally.  We see they have a golden

light/haze of good around them.

EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

Adrian is underneath Valerie.

He moves a little closer, and she spits on him.  He smiles.

Opens his mouth and catches her spit.  He swallows.

Everyone is grossed out.

John points at Todd.  They laugh.  Adrian gets closer to

Valerie.  Just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder.

He looks down to see:

Nicky standing there with his army.

Adrian glares down at the REFORMED DEMON.  His eyes shoot out

an evil ray.

The Reformed Demon explodes into a million pieces.  His

golden insides splatter on the crowd.

The Army of Good is shaken.  Another Demon lowers his

chicken.

The BUCKET OF CHICKEN sprouts legs and runs away.  Nicky

steps forward bravely.

Nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards Adrian.

Nicky lands on both feet standing before Adrian.

ANGLE ON

Crowd reacts.

ON HELL STAGE

Demons are ready to attack.  Adrian waves them off.

Nicky thinks, holds out his hands.  A rainbow shoots out onto

the stage between them.  PAUSE.  We see that a cute little

chipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut.

ON CROWD

The army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see

this.

BACK ON HELL STAGE

Adrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out.

He has made a terrible PYTHON that comes over and eats the

baffled chipmunk in one bite.

Nicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of

flowers.

Adrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a

lawn mower comes by and mows them down.

Nicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER

pushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage.

Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who

leaps out and starts beating up on the mother.

Nicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF.  The evil Dwarf

stops beating her up and holds her hand.

Adrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw.  He goes flying off the

platform.

Nicky's body falls towards the ground.  It's about to hit,

when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall.

INT. HEAVEN - CONTINUOUS

We now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and SEVEN OTHER GIRLS

watching the action on the table.

CHUBBS is there, too.

EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

Nicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him.  Nicky

rolls away at the last second.  Adrian hits the bed hard and

bounces up.  Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back

down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.  Nicky holds

out the flask.

Adrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face,

sending him flying off the bed.

Nicky is an expert pillow fighter.  He lands a series of

awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves.  Adrian is dazed.

Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air

to him.  Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it

lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face.  Adrian goes

down hard.  Nicky towers over him.

Adrian turns to his demons.

A bunch of Demons advance.

ON FLAGPOLE

We see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run

over and lowers the five from the flagpoles.

ON ADRIAN

He looks up and glares at Henry.

ON FLAGPOLE

Henry's eyes widen.

He is covered in bees again.

BACK ON ADRIAN

He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by

demons.  Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't

open his mouth.

Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his

mouth.

We hear CASSIUS banging against the walls.

Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.  Adrian jams

the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in.

Adrian smiles.  But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to

grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him.

As the flask hits the ground, we HEAR:

We HEAR the sounds of a struggle.

All the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large

circle around the flask.  Valerie and the gang make it down

off the stage.

We HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump.  The crowd

REACTS.  A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a

horrible thud.

The FLASK starts rolling over and over on the road.  People

get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the

street.  They root for their side.

John and Peter start beating up the Demon.

INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

The Angel and the Friend are praying.

EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

We HEAR banging and beating and yelling from inside and then

the flask stops bouncing.  SILENCE.  Everybody outside holds

their breath.  Slowly out of the spout crawls NICKY.

HOORAY.  Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living

people CHEER.  The student, very happy, opens his kimono.

The people and demons near him are grossed out.

Valerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him.

She laughs and kisses him on the mouth.  The crowd CHEERS.

But Nicky won't stop kissing her.  She starts to struggle for

air.  Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh.

The crowd stops CHEERING.  Valerie is waving her arms for

help.  Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss.  Adrian lets

her go.  And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh.

Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns

into a GIANT BAT.  He lets out a huge roar, then flies

around, laughing, scaring people.

Valerie runs over and picks up the flask.  She looks inside.

No response.

A long beat, then:

And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands

on his feet.  Adrian lands and stares down Nicky.  The clock

is one minute from midnight.

Adrian swoops down.  Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the

BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.  Out of

it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.

They faint.

The Bat's eyes go wide in fear.  Ozzy grabs the bat, his

mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.  Valerie

hands Ozzy the flask.

Ozzy spits the bat head into the flask.

EXT. CLOCK TOWER

The clock reads: 00:23 seconds left.

INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dad is just a very thin pair of lips and one finger.  The

FINGER is going up and down on the lips, making silly sounds.

The Gatekeeper, the Monster, Jimmy the Demon and Lucifer are

on their backs crying like babies.

EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

PAUSE.  Everyone looks around.  Nicky spots Henry Winkler.

Henry is covered in bees once again.

ON NICKY AND VALERIE

Nicky picks up a big rock and hands it to Valerie.

Valerie smashes the rock on Nicky's head, killing him.

ON CLOCK TOWER

Six seconds left.

INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The lips and finger are slowing down.

INT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

Nicky triumphantly passes through the wall of fire and it

starts burning again behind him.  And now all the BACKED UP

SOULS fall out on top of Nicky.

The Gatekeeper APPLAUDS.

EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

The STAGE, the DEMONS and everything that raised from Hell

now descends quickly into the ground.

INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

Dad's lips form a body around it.  Dad FILLS IN.

INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dad turns to Nicky.

He pats him on the back.

Lucifer walks over to the closet.

He pulls out the flask.

He shoves the flask up Hitler's ass.  Hitler's face tightens.

FREEZE FRAME, then:

ONE YEAR LATER

Over the skyline of Manhattan.

EXT. STREET - CENTRAL PARK WEST

PAN UP from a moving baby stroller to reveal Nicky and

Valerie both pushing it.  We see Beefy walking with them.

Unbelievably happy.

A nice OLD LADY bends down to the stroller.

She tickles the baby.  It giggles and a small stream of fire

shoots out of his mouth and singes the Old Lady's eyebrows.

The Lady scurries away.  Nicky and Valerie laugh and continue

walking in absolute bliss.  They pass the Preacher who runs

towards us.

The Preacher runs straight into the camera.  BLACK.
