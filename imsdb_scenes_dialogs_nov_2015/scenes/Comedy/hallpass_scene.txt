EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Very late. All is quiet. Then a battered MINI-VAN blows by

a row of hedges that have been pruned to read: 'WELCOME TO

CAPE COD.' A moment later a FLASHING COP CAR flies by in HOT

PURSUIT.

INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

The WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back the hair of

two BEAT-UP-LOOKING MEN. The driver, FRED SEARING, 40-ish,

has a look of determination and resolve on his chunky face,

despite the BLACK EYE and BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE dangling out

of his nose. The nervous passenger is RICK MILLS, 38.

Pull over, man!

No way, I can out-run 'em!

No you can't--not in this thing!

Another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAILS OUT OF A SIDE STREET and

JOINS THE CHASE.

Oh God, now there's two of 'em!

I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til

we get there!

Are you crazy?!

Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my

wife!

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF A CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ENTRANCE

followed by the two police cruisers. When they stop, we see

that somebody has spray-painted 'HORNY OLD MAN' on the side

of the mini-van.

Fred jumps out and SPRINTS toward the entrance. SEVERAL COPS

spring from their cars and give chase. Before Fred can reach

the front doors, he gets KNOCKED VIOLENTLY to the ground.

Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED.

Hear me out, gentlemen, I can

explain every--!

AS A BURLY OFFICER'S HEAD CONNECTS WITH RICK'S CHEST, we...

2.

.And FADE TO BLACK... and then:

SMASH CUT TO:

Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:

TWO WEEKS EARLIER

FADE BACK IN:

INT. RICK'S FAMILY ROOM - DAY

ON TV SCREEN - a video shows several YOUNG PEOPLE, early-

20's, sunning themselves at the beach. A YOUNG-LOOKING RICK

hams it up for the camera.

RICK (O.S.)

See the stud in the blue shorts?

That's me the summer I got out of

college.

LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals EMMA, 6, and GUNNAR, 4, sitting on

either side of Rick.

I still have a few.

Where?

Rick shoots him a look.

They're hidden.

BACK ON TV SCREEN - A PRETTY GIRL with a knockout body comes

up and puts her arms around Rick.

Who's that girl?

That's Mommy.

No, I mean the young one standing

next to you.

That's Mommy.

Mommy used to have long hair? And

she wore a bikini?

Yes she did.

3.

How come she doesn't wear a bikini

anymore?

Is it because of her fat ass?

I guess. What? No. Who said Mommy's

got a fat ass?

Mommy.

LONG BEAT.

Well, uh, I don't appreciate that

language, Gunnar. You've got the

best mom in the whole world--don't

ever say anything bad about her.

Just then, MAGGIE comes GRUNTING into the room carrying a ONE-

YEAR-OLD BABY in one arm and a basket of laundry in the

other. She's in her late-30's, cute, with short, manageable

mommy hair. She's wearing SWEATPANTS, an OVERSIZED T-SHIRT,

and NO MAKE-UP.

Hey beautiful, you better get a

move on--we're supposed to be

meeting Fred and Grace soon.

I know, I know, I'm trying.

Well how long you gonna be?

Forty-five minutes--sooner if you

help with the kids.

Maggie looks to him, hopeful.

Forty-five minutes is good.

Maggie shoots him a look and Rick smiles.

I'm kidding. Okay, kids, first one

in the tub gets college paid for.

Emma and Gunnar just stare at him.

Come on, you bums, let's go!

4.

As Rick starts to tickle his kids they run out of the room,

EXT. SIDEWALK - EVENING

Rick and Maggie walk along hand-in-hand. They're dressed-up

and happy-looking.

I miss going out with you on

Saturday nights.

She smiles at him.

I know, it's just like the old

days.

Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk.

Maybe we should make a rule that we

go out at least six nights a week

without the kids.

Maggie GIGGLES.

I'm serious. We should go out every

week--just you and me.

A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE walks past them and Rick gives a QUICK

GLANCE back AT HER ASS.

I think it'd be healthy.

You gotta be kidding me?

Maggie pulls away.

What?

You just checked out that girl's

butt.

I did?

Yeah, you did, and it's rude.

Why? You think she saw me?

saw you.

5.

Oh, uh, yeah. I'm sorry, honey, I'm

just kind of spacey today.

GRACE (O.S.)

Come on, we're late!

REVERSE ANGLE reveals Fred Searing and his wife GRACE, 38,

waiting outside a restaurant. Fred sports a full-head of

hair that's maybe a little too stiff. Grace is short and

appealing in a Rachel Ray kind of way. Fred leans in to kiss

Maggie as Rick kisses Grace.

Grace, let me ask you something:

Does Fred ever check out other

women in front of you?

No, Fred's not a gawker.

Grace pats a pleased-looking Fred on the head.

Come on, Mags, let's go say hi to

Dr. Lucy.

We follow the women as they leave their husbands and ENTER

the restaurant under a banner that says, 'Boston Psychiatric

Association Person of the Year.'

INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Grace and Maggie approach the check-in table.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

There they are!

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals DR. LUCY GILBERT, a very attractive and

sophisticated-looking 40-year-old, holding court in the

corner.

Dr. Lucy! Congratulations!

DR. LUCY

Girls, thank you so much for

coming.

Dr. Lucy speaks with a FRENCH ACCENT.

Are you kidding me? You're the only

friend of ours who ever got an

award--you think we're going to

miss that?

ANGLE ON Rick and Fred standing at the bar.

Do you mind telling me how your

wife catches you checking out

another girl? What is this, amateur

hour?

6.

The BARTENDER delivers a couple beers and Rick pays.

The girl walked past and I glanced

back at her for like half a second.

There's your problem, dumb-ass--

it's the wrong order. You don't

wait for the girl to walk past and

then glance back. You turn when

she's still fifteen feet in front

of you...then you wait for her to

walk into your line of vision.

Fred NOTICES an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walking toward them from the

right.

Observe.

Before the woman reaches them, Fred turns to his left and

holds the look until the Attractive Woman's ASS ENTERS HIS

VIEW and he watches her walk away.

You see? I can't help it if her

butt walks where I'm already

looking.

It was your air space.

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Hey, guys.

They turn to see a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN with a healthy tan walking

past carrying several drinks. This is MISSY FRANKENFIELD,

mid-30's.

RICK AND FRED

Hey, Missy.

(CALLING back to them)

Don't forget to mingle!

The guys watch Missy walk away.

Wow. Missy's looking pretty good

for someone going through a

divorce.

Yeah, that's rough stuff--I heard

they might have to sell the house.

Too bad. You gonna hit 'em up for

the listing?

7.

What am I, a vulture? Nah, I don't

go after the divorcee business

unless they approach me first.

Yeah, it's kind of tacky, huh?

As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's

ass, we...

REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr. Lucy sipping

lemondrops and watching Rick and Fred from across the room.

Look at those two meatheads

checking out Missy Frankenfield.

What, do they think they're

invisible over there?

I thought you said Fred wasn't a

gawker.

He was standing right next to you.

I can't let him know that I know--

that would take all the fun out of

it.

You should see him. He's got some

stupid move where he looks back

before the girl passes to make it

seem like he couldn't help but

notice her ass. It's pathetic.

Maggie and Dr. Lucy GIGGLE.

EXT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rick's car is parked in the driveway, and he and Maggie are

getting out.

How about I drive the babysitter

home while you go upstairs and

prepare the altar?

He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front

door.

I want to, honey, but I've got to

get up early with the kids.

I'll get up with the kids.

But I have to go out and buy a gift-

-they're going to a birthday party

tomorrow.

8.

I'll cjet the gift, then I'll take

the kids to the park, then to the

party. You can dust stay in bed,,

get your beauty sleep, and bask in

the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about

to give you.

I love it when you sweet-talk me.

Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they FREEZE IN

THEIR TRACKS.

THEIR POV - the babysitter (PAIGE, 20, cute) is standing

there with their 4-year-old, Gunnar.

Mommy! Daddy!

Little buddy.. .what are you doing

up?

Gunnar runs into his mother's arms and Maggie shrugs

apologetically to Rick.

This is just a minor obstacle.

INT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - NIGHT

Rick is at the wheel of his Dodge Caravan and Paige sits in

the passenger seat. She is on the busty side.

How were the kids tonight?

Perfect. That Gunnar is so cute--

all he wants to do is wrestle with

me.

Rick smiles at this.

Mr. Mills, would it be okay to turn

down the air--I'm a little chilly.

Look--I got goose bumps.

As she HOLDS OUT HER ARM to show him the GOOSE-BUMPS, we

RACK FOCUS BEYOND HER ARM to the ERECT NIPPLES that are

PIERCING THROUGH HER SHEER TOP like small tents.

BACK ON Rick as his EYES GO WIDE WITH TERROR and he looks

away.

9.

Oh, uh, sure, I'm sorry.

Flustered, he moves to the temperature control which in LARGE

ILLUMINATED DIGITAL TYPE reads: 69!!! He quickly PUNCHES THE

A/C OFF, then trains his eyes straight ahead and grips the

steering wheel tight at ten-and-two.

Thank you.

'Welcome.

EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT

The mini-van pulls up in front of a sorority house.

INT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

Paige hesitates before getting out.

Mr. Mills, can I ask you something?

Sure.

I was wondering...

.could you buy me some beer?

Rick looks surprised.

Buy you some.. .How old are you?

Twenty. But I'm turning twenty-one

next week.

Oh. Happy birthday. That's a

biggie.

Yeah. My aunt usually buys beer for

me, but she's out of town.

So. . .could ya?

Uh, I don't know, Paige...I could

get in a lot of trouble for giving

alcohol to a minor.

Oh, come on, I'm a junior in

college. You drank when you were in

college, didn't you?

10.

Well, uh...

Besides, it's so arbitrary. How

does it make sense that twenty's

old enough to fight in Iraq or

watch a porno movie, but it's too

young to drink a beer?

Rick shifts in his seat.

Really? Twenty's old enough to

uh...?

Fight in Iraq?

No, the other thing.

Watch Porn? Oh, God yeah--half the

girls in those things are my age.

Rick catches a hint of cleavage, a flash of leg.

Look, I promise no one's gonna find

out. If you want, you can join me

down at the lake--we'll listen to

some tunes and have a couple beers.

Rick stares at her, pictures it in his head. She looks

hopeful, open.

I'm sorry, Paige, I can't do that.

Why not?

Well... it would be.. .inappropriate.

Rick's voice has taken on a firmer, more adult tone. Paige

seems amused by it.

What, is that your grown-up voice?

That would be inappropriate, Paige.

No, Paige.

(with an edge)

What are you thinking? I'm a

married man and I have a family.

You think they'd like it if they

knew I was hanging out at the lake,

all alone, drinking beer with a

college girl?

11.

She seems taken aback.

I never said alone. My sorority's

having a party down there tonight.

Rick CLEARS HIS THROAT, tries to hide his embarrassment.

All right, better get inside.

She opens the car door, then glares back at him.

Ewww. What the hell were you

thinking?

Go ahead. Scoot along now.

As she SLAMS the car door, we...

INT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rick bounds up the stairs to find Maggie gently closing

Gunnar's bedroom door.

Shhhh. He just fell asleep.

Awesome.

Rick playfully pinches Maggie's butt as he follows her into

their bedroom where...

INT. BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

.They find Emma sitting up in their bed, smiling.

Can I sleep with you tonight?

No.

Please.

No. Absolutely not.

Maggie, clearly softening to the idea, shrugs at Rick.

12.

Are you serious? Look, besides the

other thing, I don't like the fact

that my daughter needs someone to

sleep with every night--that's not

going to be good when she goes off

to college, you know.

Maggie rolls her eyes.

Well.. .can someone read me a story?

Rick looks at Maggie, then at his daughter.

Okay, one quick story. Come on,

jump on my back.

Emma jumps on Rick's back.

You can get started without me--

I'll be right back.

Rick piggybacks Emma out of the room.

INT. EMMA'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

Emma is putting Rick's HAIR INTO PONYTAILS.

Okay, honey, this is the last pony

and then night-night.

Emma finishes putting on a rubberband, then looks at him,

satisfied.

There. You look pretty, Daddy.

Okay, now give me a kiss, hug and

go to sleep.

She lays back on her pillow. Rick gives her a big kiss on

both cheeks.

I love you, Emma.

I love you, too, Daddy.

EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Rick (still in ponytails) tip-toes out of Emma's bedroom,

closes the door so tly, then HUSTLES DOWN THE HALLWAY.

INT. RICK & MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rick scrambles into the room and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

13.

HIS POV - Maggie lays in bed, FAST ASLEEP.

No. Please, no.

Rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep,

so he just PULLS THE COVERS OVER HER SHOULDERS.

As Rick walks around the bed and INTO THE BATHROOM in the

b.g., we HOLD ON MAGGIE until she OPENS HER EYES. She

listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge

of GUILT, and when he shuts off the faucet, she CLOSES HER

EYES AGAIN, and we...

EXT. PARK - MORNING

Rick pushes Gunnar and Emma on the swings as a sweaty Fred

APPROACHES carrying a tennis racket. (We see several TENNIS

COURTS in the b.g.)

Hey.

Hey. How'd you make out?

Great. Lost both sets.

So'd you get the business?

Fred nods and wipes his brow.

Pretty sure I got the Auto and

Home. He told me to call his

accountant on Monday about the

Life.

Nice.

Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with

their CHILDREN.

Can you believe the talent here

today?

Yeah. I know.

They NOTICE something O.S..

THEIR POV - we see a SCANDINAVIAN AU PAIR bent over EXPOSING

HER THONG UNDERWEAR as she picks up a CHILD from a wagon.

Ouch.

14.

Rick SIGHS.

CPR girl's back, too.

Rick nods toward A PIG-TAILED PARAMEDIC, early 30's, TEACHING

A CPR CLASS. The two men look on solemnly.

Imagine if we were coming here back

when we were single?

Oh baby, the damage we would do.

Monkey bars!

The kids JUMP off the swings and RUN for the jungle gym.

Me first!

Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor

scooters and a basketball as Fred tags along. They shlep

past THE TRI-DELTA SORORITY playing ultimate frisbee and

WEARING 'JUICY' SWEATS.

So you get lucky last night?

Nah, the kids were up when we got

home. How 'bout you?

Well, kinda lucky. Grace conked

right out so I snuck out to the car

and rubbed one out.

Rick shoots Fred a look.

The car? What are you Knight Rider?

Why didn't you just go in the

bathroom like a normal guy?

And get caught by Grace? Can't risk

it. Besides, cars turn me on--it's

where I lost my virginity. And

they're comfy--I just put the seat

back and turn on the tunes.

The guys sit on a bench.

That's one of the things they don't

tell you when you're young--that

you'll still be jerking-off after

you get married. I thought it was

dust gonna be a teenage thing.

Yeah, I didn't see that one coming.

The two men sit in silence for a LONG BEAT as the Frisbee

Girls play all around them.

You know what I miss the most?

What?

The arch.

What arch?

You know when you're taking a

girl's panties off for the first

time, and you're wondering if she's

going to stop you, but then she

gives you that little pelvic arch-

thrust that tells you that the

struggle's over, everything's going

to be okay?

Rick SIGHS.

That's a happy moment.

Yep. Another thing gone forever.

Rick looks at his watch.

I should get going, I have to drop

the kids off at a birthday party.

You want to grab a coffee after?

INT. COFFEE SHOP - SAME

Fred and Rick stand in line.

Do you have any interest in going

down to the Patriot's training camp

one of these days?

Are you kidding, I'd love that.

Except...I always feel kind of

pathetic waiting in line for Tom

Brady's autograph.

16.

Fred, I was planning on bringing

the kids.

Genius! That's the perfect cover!

Rick shoots him a look then REACTS to something O.S.

Uh-oh...

HIS POV - SLO-MO of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL walking toward him. Her

straight brown hair shimmers.. .her blue eyes twinkle.. .her

white uniformed blouse is unbuttoned enough to reveal a

tasteful amount of CLEAVAGE. This is COFFEE GIRL, 23,

granola, fresh, Australian, spacey.

BACK ON THE GUYS staring in awe.

Did you see her face? Her face is

tremendous.

(chanting, scared)

Please don't have a nice ass,

please don't have a nice ass...

But as she turns to pour a cup of coffee, we see that HER ASS

IS SPECTACULAR. Rick turns away, annoyed.

Oh, come on! That's ri iculous.

I know. She's from Australia. Been

working here about a month.

Why'd you have to bring me here?!

Okay, cool it, tiger--here she

comes.

Coffee Girl steps up to the counter and smiles at Fred.

Iced coffee with two Splendas

again?

Fred wants to say yes, but just nods.

COFFEE GIRL (CONT'D)

How about your mate there?

Uh...same.

Her smile comes with a squint, which makes her eyes sparkle.

17.

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals a WANNABE ARTIST-TYPE MALE EMPLOYEE,

mid-20's (clearly covetous of Coffee Girl) sizing Rick and

Fred up as he wipes down a counter.

BACK ON COFFEE GIRL AND OUR GUYS

(re: Rick's shirt)

Hey, Old Navy, you like a muffin

with that?

Uh, sure. What do you recommend?

They're all good.

The Wannabe Artist-Type steps protectively up beside Coffee

Girl.

I'd go with the bran muffin--you

guys are probably having digestive

issues at your age, right?

Rick flinches at this, then turns to Coffee Girl.

I'll have a blueberry muffin

please.

Make it a bran muffin for me.

Rick shoots Fred a look, clearly annoyed. As Coffee Girl

turns to get their order, we go to...

SAME SCENE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Rick and Fred, now with coffees, sit at the rear of the shop.

Did you notice she's from Cleavage,

Ohio?

Yeah. I bet her areolas look like a

couple of pepperoni slices.

Fred trains his eyes back on Coffee Girl and SQUINTS

INTENSELY.

What the hell are you doing?

Shh. I'm taking a mental photograph

for my spank bank.

Say cheese.

ED (O.S.)

Jesus Christ, guys, give it a rest.

18.

Rick and Fred turn to see ED LONG, tall, good-looking, mid-

40's, standing at the creamer counter behind them.

Oh, hey, Ed. Didn't see you there.

That's because you were shooting

laser beams at the java babe.

Well, no, we were just--

Come on, gentlemen, you're married

men and she's half your age--grow

The guys can't muster a response.

So I guess I'll be seeing you at

the house-warming party this

weekend.

Hm?

This Saturday afternoon at the new

casa--we're inally in and we're

having a little celebration.

Oh, I don't know if we can--

Your wives already RSVP'd.

Right on.

'Til then.

Ed HOLDS OUT HIS FIST to them.

Rick and Fred reluctantly take turns TAPPING Ed's fist with

theirs. Then Ed leaves.

What a d-bag.

He's right though.

Fred looks at Rick.

19.

What are we doing sitting here

gawking at her for? We're married

men--it's creepy.

I don't see what the big deal is--

we're not hurting anyone. What is

he Big Brother--he's gonna tell me

what I can look at now? For God

sakes, don't take that away from me-

-it's all I got!

As Rick thinks about this, we...

INT. RICK'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A BABY MONITOR - PULL BACK to reveal that it's in

the middle of a POKER TABLE next to a pile of ONE-DOLLAR

BILLS. Sitting around the table PLAYING LIAR'S POKER are

Rick, Fred, GARY, HOG-HEAD, BAKER, and FLATS, all in their

mid-30's to mid-40's. Hog-head has a huge melon, Baker is

husky, Flats is a pale red-head, and Gary is slight and

squirrelly.

Rick, you open.

Rick takes a fresh DOLLAR BILL off the pile in front of him

and STUDIES THE SERIAL NUMBERS.

Four 9's.

Hey, where's Coakley? How come he

didn't show?

Vegas. Hawaiian Tropic finals.

The guys nod their approval.

Man, imagine being Coakley? The

guy's single, he's loaded, chicks

love him, he doesn't have to answer

to anybody.

That's the life.

That is the life.

Let me ask you something: What

would you guys pay to have your way

with a Hawaiian Tropic girl for an

entire weekend?

The guys perk up as they think about this.

20.

You get to pick any one you want--

and you know up front that you

won't get her pregnant, no

diseases, you're never gonna hear

from her again, and your wife will

never find out.

How's it possible to know that my

wife won't find out?

It's not. I'm saying if it were

possible, like if I was a magic

genie and I could grant you this

wish but then make it like it never

even happened.

But would I still have memory of

it?

Oh yeah. Great memories.

Oof. I think I'd pay 500 bucks for

that.

Baker shoots him a look.

You cheap,bastard. We're talking

about an investment that gets your

rocks off and protects your wife's

feelings. I'd pay five grand.

Wow.

Well, excuse me, Mr. Wall Street,

but us public school teachers

aren't getting any of that bail-out

money you're over-tipping everyone

with.

Just then, the front door OPENS and Maggie ENTERS.

Hey, guys.

Oh, hey, honey. How was the book

club?

Great.

What did you guys read this month?

21.

Hemingway.

Old Man and the Sea?

No, Muriel's yoga book.

The guys LAUGH.

Actually, we were supposed to be

discussing The Sun Also Rises but

Grace pulled out a bottle of

tequila and that was the end of

that. So, did the kids go down

easy?

Gunnar and Emma stalled for a

while, but they weren't bad.

How about the baby?

Rick points to the BABY MONITOR in the middle of the table.

Not a peep.

Great job. Now win some money,

honey.

She kisses Rick and walks out of the room.

I wish I could drink tequila. It's

a great buzz but it always gives me

the spins and then I have to go

home early.

You want to know a sure cure for

the spins?

Fred puts a hand over his right eye.

Just cover up one eye. It balances

out the equilibrium.

Or you could find a nice 12-step

program.

22.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

As Maggie gets to the top of the stairs, she can hear the

O.S. SOUND OF THE BABY CRYING. She walks down the hall,

opens the Baby's door and REACTS.

HER POV - the exhausted and sweaty Baby is standing in his

crib, SOBBING. The baby monitor is on the dresser next to

the crib BLARING out LAUGHTER from the poker game.

INT. BABY NURSERY - CONTINUOUS

Oh, you poor thing...

She hurries to the Baby and PICKS HIM UP.

Silly Daddy... he got the monitors

mixed-up. Have you been listening

to those loud-mouths all night?

As Maggie moves to turn off the monitor, we HEAR:

FLATS (O.S.)

.So how 'bout you, Fred--how much

would you pay to s end an entire

weekend with one of the hottest

women in the world?

Maggie hesitates and LISTENS IN.

FRED (O.S.)

I wouldn't have to pay--I'm married

to her.

There's a BEAT, then the guys EXPLODE IN LAUGHTER.

FRED (O.S.) (CONT'D)

No, seriously, I'd pay five grand,

easy.

Maggie's JAW DROPS.

BACK ON POKER GAME

I'd have to figure out a way to get

it out of the bank without Grace

noticing, but I suppose the genie

could help me with that.

You could put me down for seven-

five.

Pfttt. Hog-head, your ass doesn't

have seven-five.

More LAUGHTER from the guys as Rick deals out fresh bills.

23.

So what's your number, Rick?

Oh jeez, Flats, I don't know...

Come on.. any girl you choose. You

get to do anything you want with

her, and your wife will never find

out. It's completely harmless, a

one-time thing--what would you pay

for that?

BACK ON MAGGIE as she cradles her baby and LEANS CLOSER to

the monitor.

RICK (O.S.)

I honestly don't know, fellas.

BAKER (O.S.)

Ballpark.

PUSH IN ON MAGGIE as she waits nervously for her husband's

answer.

RICK (O.S.)

Well... I've got a great wife and I

sure wouldn't want to hurt her

feelings, so...

Maggie SMILES at this. That's my guy!

RICK (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I guess the real question is,

what wouldn't I pay?!

The guys LAUGH O.S. and MAGGIE REACTS, as we...

INT. MAGGIE AND RICK'S KITCHEN - LATER

Maggie's got Rick backed into a corner.

What wouldn't you pay?!

I didn't really mean it, honey.

(scared, defenseless)

They kind of put me on the spot.

Look, some of the other guys were

throwing out some pretty hefty

bids.

What does that have to do with

anything?

Well... I'm the host of the party, I

didn't want to be a buzz-kill.

Maggie squints, appalled.

Look, all I was saying was, there's

no amount of money I wouldn't pay

to protect you and the kids.

How is having sex with a hooker

protecting me and the kids?

No one said anything about hookers.

You were paying for sex--what would

you call her?

Well.. .the genie was getting the

dough, not her.

Come on, be reasonable, it was just

guy-talk--it's not like it could

really happen.

Maggie shakes her head, disgusted, and leaves the room.

Love you!

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Maggie, Grace, and Dr. Lucy eat at an upscale restaurant.

Dr. Lucy listens quietly to the women.

Fred said five grand? What a

blowhard!

You know what's even funnier? Hog-

head McCormick said he'd pay seven

grand.

What?! That bum hasn't worked since

the dot-com bust--his wife supports

him!

The girls LAUGH.

Well, look on the bright side: At

least they're not cheating on us.

Sometimes I wonder if it would be

better if they did cheat and get it

over with.

25.

DR. LUCY

You mean, rather than take the slow

boat to resentment?

The girls look to Dr. Lucy.

DR. LUCY (CONT'D

I'm just saying.. .maybe a little

freedom would be good for them. And

for you.

Have you ever considered giving

them a hall pass?

A what?

DR. LUCY

A hall pass. A week off from

marriage.

Grace and Maggie stop chewing.

Wait a minute. . .Are you saying let

them go out and cheat?

DR. LUCY

I'm saying give them a week off

from marriage.

Look, most married men have foggy

memories of their single days and

they somehow get under the

impression that if not for you,

they'd be able to be with ail those

women who entice them.

That's Fred. He thinks because he

sees big tits everywhere and then

still comes home for dinner that I

should be welcoming him at the door

like some conquering hero.

Dr. Lucy smiles.

DR. LUCY

Well, maybe it's time to let them

go out there and find out what it's

really like.

Wow. You're talking about the

nuclear option.

Maggie ponders the idea.

And remind me again, what good

could possibly come from this...?

26.

DR. LUCY

There's a wonderful principle in

psychology called 'reactance

theory.' It basically states that

if you're constantly told you can't

do something, you want to do it

more than ever. And conversely, if

you remove the taboo, you remove

the obsession.

Grace makes a 't' sound.

I got an idea, Doc: Why don't you

try a hall pass out on your husband

and let us know how it works out.

DR. LUCY

Oh, I have.

Grace and Maggie REACT to this.

You're telling us you let Charlie

sleep with another woman?

Dr. Lucy takes a moment before answering.

DR. LUCY

I am not telling you that. I am

telling you that I gave him the

freedom to choose for himself.

And...?

DR. LUCY

All I know is...our marriage is

better than ever.

Grace and Maggie think about this.

I don't know. There's a reason that

men evolved and apes didn't. It's

because women demanded more.

Without a wife, Einstein would've

been humping a maple tree all day.

As the women LAUGH, we

EXT. ED & KIMMY LONG'S ESTATE - DAY

There are several flashy cars out front of this huge

McMansion. As Fred and Grace and Rick and Maggie get out of

Fred's mini-van, Ed Long comes out of the house to greet

them. (Ed's 5-YEAR-OLD SON is beside him wearing khakis and a

Polo shirt, just like his father.)

There he is! The lord of the manor!

27.

Come on, everyone in the shack! The

grand tour's about to begin!

INT. STUDY - AFTERNOON

Ed and his wife KIMMY (late-30's, high-maintenance) lead

large wood-paneled study. (The Long's 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

I call it headquarters.

LARRY BOHAC, mid-40's, and his blonde bombshell of a wife,

MANDY, (who wears A TOO-TIGHT T-SHIRT) look around in awe.

Un-believable.

That's sweet of you to say, Mandy.

It's epic, Ed.

Ed points to one wall which houses a GLASSED-IN HUMIDOR.

And this over here--this is the war

room. The temperature in there

never goes above fifty-four

degrees, never below fifty-three. I

even threw in a back-up generator

in case we lose power and the main

generator doesn't kick in. Now who

wants a Cubano? They're the real

deal--Coakley snagged them on his

trip to Havana.

Wait a second, Ed, first I want to

show them Lny headquarters.

Fred looks at Rick and rolls his eyes.

INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

It looks like a Waterworks showroom. Despite its bloated

opulence, Grace and Maggie can't help but be impressed.

It's my paradise.

With a price tag north of one

hundred and forty large, it better

be paradise.

Ed holds out his fist and Rick obediently POUNDS IT. Just

then Grace NOTICES that Fred has disappeared.

28.

Hey, where did Fred go?

Rick turns and sees that he's missing.

INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Rick walks down a hall and finds Fred in a guest room

watching a baseball game on TV.

What are you doing?

I can't take these look-at-how-much-

I-own parties. It's obnoxious.

Rick nods and sits down beside him.

When I bought my completely-loaded

Honda Odyssey, I didn't go around

bragging about it, did I?

Well, kind of. You made me drive

around town with you for two hours,

remember?

I thought you'd want to watch a

movie in a mini-van. You never got

to watch a movie in a mini-van

before, did you?

Rick shrugs.

Why'd you have to hook your boat up

to it?

Because it's the Touring Edition,

numb-skull. The thing can tow more

weight than ninety percent of the

pick-ups out there!

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME

Everybody is admiring the antique fireplace.

The mantle actually came all the

way from Tuscany, which is in

Europe.

Hey, gang, check this out.

29.

Oh God, Eddie, they don't need to

see that--they'll think we're

wackos.

Ed PUNCHES A CODE into a keypad and the WALL SLIDES OPEN

revealing a SAFE ROOM.

INT. SAFE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Maggie, Grace, and the others follow Ed into a safe room

filled with VIDEO MONITORS surveilling all the rooms in the

house. When Kimmy ENTERS she pushes a button CLOSING THE

WALL BEHIND THEM.

Oh my God... this is like secret

agent stuff.

I think having a safe room is a bit

over the top, but Ed feels with our

two little ones you can never be

too cautious.

Aw, you're such a good daddy.

(aside to Grace)

Rick can't even set up the baby

monitors right.

Ed points to a monitor where we see Rick and Fred ENTER the

master bedroom.

Here come Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-

dum.

CLOSE ON VIDEO MONITOR - we see Rick and Fred cross over to

the master bathroom doorway and look in.

RICK (ON MONITOR)

.All I'm saying is, who gets a

mini-van when you don't even have

any kids?

FRED (ON MONITOR)

You don't know much about the

insurance game, do you, Rick? When

you pull into a person's driveway

to sell them life insurance, who do

you think they'd rather see? A hot-

shot in a Porsche or a family man

in a mini-van? Hm?

Rick looks around the empty room.

RICK (ON MONITOR)

Hey, where'd everyone go?

30.

Guys, we're in here!

They can't hear you. The room's

completely soundproof.

And bulletproof.

and ENTER ANOTHER.

INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Rick and Fred walk back into Ed's study.

They must've gone downstairs.

Fred motions to Ed's humidor room.

Thanks for coming to the war room,

old chap. By the way, did I mention

that my wife's vagina never goes

above fifty-four degrees, nor below

fifty-three.

INT. SAFE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Larry Bohac CHUCKLES and Grace shifts uncomfortably.

Uh, maybe we should turn this off.

But Ed turns THE VOLUME UP.

CLOSE ON MONITOR - Rick plays along with a BAD BRITISH

ACCENT.

RICK (ON MONITOR)

Is that so, dear boy? And what

happens if you lose power during a

big blow and your main generator

doesn't kick in?

FRED (ON MONITOR)

Well that's why I had the back-up

generator installed in Kimmy's

rumpus.

Kimmy makes a face, shocked.

(under breath; resigned)

Here we go...

31.

INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Hey, speaking of installations, is

that a shiny new set of cans on

Mandy Bohac?

Either that or she's wearing her

daughter's t-shirt.

INT. SAFE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON Mandy's surprised face. She looks at Larry, who's

suddenly not so amused.

INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

They look good but I'll still take

the real deal any day.

Right. You're telling me you'd take

Kimmy Long's flapjacks over Mandy's

new speedbags?

That's what I'm telling you. I like

boobs with a little mileage on 'em.

They're more fun.

Fun?

Yeah. You can smoosh 'em, swing

'em, hump 'em, Stretch-Armstrong

'em.

And what about the proven

correlation between floppy boobs

and large-mouth vaginas?

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. ED & KIMMY LONG'S ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

Maggie and Grace hurry down the front walk trailed by their

shell-shocked husbands. A trembling and IRATE Kimmy is held

back at the door by Ed and a couple other Guests.

You people are horrible! Horrible!

I'm very disappointed, gentlemen!

32.

INT. MINI-VAN - DAY

No one speaks. Grace drives and Maggie sits beside her,

humiliation etched across their faces. Finally:

Uh, anyone thinking chocolate chip

cookie dough in a waffle cone?

Grace YANKS the mini-van to the side of the road and GLARES

BACK AT HIM.

Large-mouth vaginas?!

As the guys cower, we

INT. RICK & MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rick looks small and weak sitting on the couch while Maggie

stands across from him rubbing her temples. It looks like

the Norman Rockwell painting where the mom reprimands her

little boy for sneaking a frog into the house.

You know what really troubles me?

The thing that you're all so

obsessed with is meaningless to

you. It's really just about numbers

with you guys.

Rick looks up, confused.

Rick, you can't even tel me the

month you lost your virginity. I

can tell you the exact day and hour

that I lost mine.

Rick seems a little embarrassed by this.

Well, virginity is different for

guys.

The point is, obviously I like sex,

too--it means something to me--but

I don't walk around gawking at

every guy I see.

All right, so I occasionally notice

other women. I'm sorry.

Occasionally?

Rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come

clean.

33.

Okay, you want the truth? You

really want me to pull back the

curtain here? From the moment I

leave the house in the morning 'til

the moment I get home, I pretty

much notice every woman in my path.

Maggie turns to face him.

But it's not how you think it is,

Mags. It's like... it's like a

curse. I don't want to notice, but

I can't help it. It's always been

like that. I figured that when I

c jot married that would be it, but

it wasn't--the thing,doesn't give

two shits about marriage.

So what are you saying--you're not

happy with our sex life?

Rick reaches up and takes her hand.

No. Of course I'm happy, honey--our

sex life is great--not that I

wouldn't mind a little more, but--

look, one thing has nothing to do

with the other. I think about sex a

lot--all guys do--that's just the

way it is.

Maggie sits down beside him, clearly at the end of her rope.

No one speaks for a few moments. Then:

I'm giving you a hall pass.

A what?

One week off from marriage.

You mean, like a trial separation?

You are seriously overreacting.

It's not a separation, it's a hall

pass. You can do whatever you want.

Get it out of your system.

Wait a minute--are you for real?

34.

It's not a yes or no offer, and

it's not a debate. You're getting a

hall pass.

As Maggie heads upstairs, we PUSH IN on a confused Rick.

INT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S KITCHEN - MORNING

Maggie is washing out a pan at the sink when Rick ENTERS

dressed for work. We hear the O.S. SOUNDS of The Wiggles

coming from a TV in another room.

'Morning.

(not facing him)

There's a couple hard-boiled eggs

in a bowl there for you.

I'm gonna have to take them to go,

hon, I've got a showing in fifteen

minutes.

Rick puts the eggs in his pocket, then approaches Maggie and

kisses her on the cheek.

Hey, about this hall pass

business.. .1 don't want it and I

don't need it. All I need is--

I told you, this isn't negotiable.

She turns and faces him.

You're really serious about this?

Rick, this isn't something that

I...look, I really think you need

this. I think we need this.

Rick doesn't know what to say.

This afternoon I'm taking the kids

out to my parent's beach house.

Rick REACTS to this.

For how long?

35.

We'll be back in one week. And as

far as I'm concerned, starting

right now. .. you have the week off

from marriage.

EXT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - DAY

This is a big shiny place. All fixed-up. Fred pulls up in

his mini-van and gets out. He walks past a Coldwell Banker

For Sale sign with Rick's name on it.

INT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - SAME

Rick is showing the kitchen to a COUPLE, mid-40's, when Fred

ENTERS.

Hey, what are you doing here?

I called your office and they told

me you were in the neighborhood.

Rick turns to the couple.

Oh, this is a friend of mine, Fred

Searing. Fred, this is Harold and

Nancy Goldberg--they're moving up

here from Long Island.

Well, mazel tov, folks.

The Goldbergs look at Fred a little warily as he takes out a

card.

Here, let me give you my card.

Home, auto, or life insurance--I'm

the go-to mensch in town.

We're good on insurance.

Rick quickly jumps in.

(to the Goldbergs)

Uh, why don't you two take another

look around and if you have any

questions I'll be right here.

Thank you.

The Goldbergs walk out and Rick closes the door behind them.

36.

What the he 1 are you doing--I'm

trying to make a sale here.

You weren't picking up your cell--I

wanted to see how much trouble you

got in last night. You know what

Grace made me do? She made me call

the Longs and apologize.

Rick flinches.

Oof .

How 'bout you--did Maggie freak out

when you got home?

Uh... sort of.

Rick peeks out the kitchen door to make sure the Goldberg's

aren't listening. Then:

She gave me a hall pass.

A what?

A week off from marriage to do

whatever I want. She's going to her

parents' house down the Cape 'til

next Sunday.

Fred SNICKERS.

Yeah, right.

I'm serious.

You're full of shit.

Fred, it's true. You think I could

make something like this up?

Fred stares at him.

I don't get it--why aren't you more

excited?

Well...I don't know how I feel.

37.

About...?

The hall pass. Something about it

isn't right.

You mean, like, you think Maggie

might have a brain tumor or

something?

No. I mean, just because my wife

tells me it's okay to cheat... is

it?

Uh, yeah.

Why can't you just accept the fact

that your wife is a goddamn saint,

Rick? She's evolved. Don't you see?

She gets it!

Yeah, but there's a part of me

that's saying, 'Wow, you must have

pushed her pretty hard to get her

to this point.' And is that good

for a marriage? That your wife is

willing to try something this

insane?

Fred can't believe his ears.

Absolutely!

Come on, doesn't it bother you that

our wives dreams all come true, but

ours don't? Look at Maggie; when

she was a kid she played house--you

g a ve her a house. She played with

her E-Z-Bake Oven--you bought her a

Viking. She played mommy--you made

her a mommy.

The oven's a GE.

It's a real gas oven! And what

about you, huh? Come on, man, your

wife is living her dreams.. .and now

it's time for you to live yours.

As Rick thinks about this, we

INT. FRED & GRACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Fred and Grace climb the stairs at the end of the day.

38.

I don't know, I think this is some

very forward-thinking on Maggie's

part.

Quit lobbying--you're not getting a

hall pass. And you mark my words,

this is going to end up biting

Maggie in the ass.

At the top of the stairs Fred puts his arms around her.

Why would I need a hall pass? I've

got you.

Not tonight you don't. I'm too

bloated and I have cramps.

I don't mind.

Fred, do I have to spell it out for

you? I'm having my period.

Yeah, I got that.

He moves in for a kiss but she pulls away.

Come on, hon, give me a break. Not

tonight.

Disappointed, Fred watches her walk toward the bedroom.

Oh, shit--I forgot to take the

trash out.

EXT. FRED & GRACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

and we MOVE IN CLOSER until we're...

LOOKING THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW at Fred. He's sitting

in the driver's seat; his EYES ARE CLOSED and his head is

slung back as he JERKS-OFF (just below frame) to the MUSIC.

A POLICE CRUISER passes in the b.g., then a moment later

BACKS INTO FRAME and STOPS NEXT TO FRED.

As the two POLICE OFFICERS look on from their car trying to

figure out what the guy is doing, the oblivious Fred

continues to STROKE HIS MEAT to the BEAT.

39.

Officer #1 gets out of the driver's side. He DISAPPEARS FROM

FRAME and then REAPPEARS at Fred's driver's side window. Now

only inches from Fred, he bends over and LOOKS INSIDE THE

CAR.

The Officer motions for his partner to join him. As Fred

continues to POUND HIMSELF TO THE MUSIC, Officer #2 climbs

out of the cruiser. He takes out his flashlight and SHINES

IT ON FRED'S O.S. LAP. As the weary officers look at each

other with a NOW-WE'VE-SEEN-IT-ALL EXPRESSION, we...

SAME SCENE - LATER

The police lights are FLASHING now and several NEIGHBORS have

gathered on their front lawns to see what's going on.

PAN to Fred's front steps where we see a HANDCUFFED Fred

standing meekly as the two Police Officers confer with a

furious-looking Grace (in her bathrobe.)

All right, ma'am, if you say he's

yours.. .you can have him.

The Officer TAKES OFF FRED'S HANDCUFFS.

Thank you, officers.

Fred scurries into the house ahead of Grace. As soon as the

door shuts, we HEAR:

GRACE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

WHAT KIND OF SICK PRICK JERKS OFF

IN HIS OWN FRONT YARD?!

As the Police Officers head back to their car, we go...

CLOSE ON a smiling Fred.

INT. RICK'S OFFICE - DAY

Rick is at his desk staring at a giddy Fred.

How?

Doesn't matter how. I got one. Can

you believe it?! I got a hall pass!

Rick stands up, elated.

And I've got a hall pass!

We both have hall passes!

40.

When does yours start?

Fred looks at his watch.

Twenty-three minutes ago! She just

left for the Cape--she's staying

with Maggie. It's just you and me

for the next six days!

Oh my God, do you realize how much

easier this is going to make it--

having a hall pass partner?

And it's not just me--Baker, Gary,

and Hog-head are coming out with us

tonight!

No way?! They got hall passes,

too?!

No, no, no--they just want to

watch.

Rick grows concerned.

You think that's a good idea,

letting them in on it? What if they

blab and it gets around town--it

might embarrass our wives.

Don't worry, I already talked to

them. Their lips are sealed.

Rick and Fred smile.

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

SLO-MO shots from Swingers or Reservoir Dogs.) Nobody

smiles, they're all business as they hit the sidewalk and

march straight into ...APPLEBEE'S.

INT. APPLEBEE'S - MOMENTS LATER

They step up to the bar.

41.

Five MGD's, my friend.

While waiting for the beers, the guys CHECK OUT THE SCENE.

It's mostly FAMILIES, a few YOUNG COUPLES.

The guy at the Holiday Inn Express

told me this place really kicks in

around nine-thirty.

Hey, why are you staying at a hotel

if your wives are out of town?

Well, we can't very well take babes

back to our places--if they know

where we live they might end up

stalking us.

Besides, I wouldn't be able to

concentrate with all the pictures

everywhere and the kids' cut-outs

all over the fridge.

Yeah, isn't it weird how your own

kids can creep you out sometimes?

Rick shoots Gary a look.

I get the feeling there's a lot of

divorcees in this place.

That's good. Divorcees are into

kinky sex--that's why they're

divorced.

Just then the BARTENDER arrives with the Miller Genuine

Drafts and the guys CLINK BOTTLES.

So come on, point out which girls

you guys are gonna do tonight.

Gary elbows Fred as he spots TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN at the end

of the bar.

What about those two? Why don't you

bang them?

No way. They're doing the

they're obviously hiding something

back there.

Okay, how about the blonde hostess?

Maybe somebody should nail her,

huh?

Attempt to be cool, Gary--we've got

a whole week.

Baker looks around at the lame bar scene.

Are you guys sure that Applebee's

is the best place to be picking up

women?

What are you thinking--Olive

Garden?

Nah, that's only good on Thursday

nights.

Hey, what about the auto show?

Baker shoots them a look.

Are you guys for real?

Wait a second--where's Coakley?

That's where we should be.

He's in Iceland.

What's he doing there?

What do you think he's doing there?

The guys all nod at this, proud of him.

Look, before we go bagging any

chicks, I gotta get a hunk of beef

in me.

Hey, I got a guy over at Outback

Steak House who could set us up.

Ooooh, he's got pull over at

Outback. Wow.

Hey, I like Outback. Let's chug

these and hit the road.

43.

As the guys drink up, Hog-head puts his arm around Gary.

Hey, Gar, you don't happen to have

any connections at 7/11, do ya?

Maybe someone could hook me up with

a player's card so I can cut right

to the front of the raspberry

slurpy line.

INT. BEACH COTTAGE - SAME

I think we might've made a huge

mistake.

Stop thinking about it, Grace. Why

don t you just try to get some

sleep?

Grace turns to Maggie.

Sleep? I can't sleep. I don't

understand you--how can you Just

sit there and read knowing that

Rick could be making out with a

supermodel right now?

Maggie doesn't answer.

Our husbands aren't married this

week. Do you know what husbands do

when they're not married?

Shh. You're going to wake the kids.

Are you going to sit there and tell

me you're not the least bit

concerned about what they're doing

right now?

Maggie SIGHS.

Okay... I'm a little concerned.

44.

Grace flops into the chair across from her.

Of course I'm concerned. But what

choice did we have?

We could've kept the status quo. I

mean, were things really that bad

that we had to try something this

extreme?

For me they were.

Look, you may call this a hall

pass, but for me it's more of a

Hail Mary pass. I'm serious, I

don't know what else to do.

Grace looks at Maggie, surprised.

Remember last week when we went to

Lucy's award thing?

Grace nods.

That night when we got home, Rick

and I were gonna.. .you know... and I

was waiting for him in bed while he

tucked the kids in, and I started

wondering who he would be thinking

about during sex. Would it be the

girl he checked out on the way into

the party? Or would it be Missy

Frankenfield--because I noticed him

gawking at her? Or how about one of

the waitresses, or maybe somebody

he saw at work that day? Then when

he came into the room, I did

something I'd never done before: I

pretended to be asleep.

You're kidding me? You've never

done that? I do that all the time!

Maggie almost smiles.

Look, I understand that people have

fantasies and that you're not

always thinking about the person

you're with.

That's for sure.

But it's just...I don't know... it's

been too long since I felt that he

was thinking about me.

45.

They sit there for a moment, quiet. Then:

I need this hall pass to work,

Grace, because if it doesn't, I

don't know what's going to happen.

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

We see two VERY OLD COUPLES walking out with doggie bags.

INT. OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE - SAME

Our five guys are in a MEAT COMA, slouched in their chairs

nursing red wines and talking through PURPLE TEETH. Several

EMPTY WINE BOTTLES, MARTINI GLASSES, HALF-EATEN STEAKS,

CARVED UP POTATO AU GRATIN and CREAMED SPINACH PLATES, and

MANGLED KEY-LIME PIES litter the table.

Okay... so where to now?

Rick can't think in this state.

Fred...?

Hm?

Answer Baker.

What's the question?

What are we doing for the rest of

the night?

I don't know. Getting laid, right?

I gotta go home and poo.

Now?

Yeah, I put too much Hollandaise on

the mozzarella sticks.

Why don't you just back one out

here?

I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need a

bath afterwards.

46.

Baker musters some initiative and STANDS UP.

Come on, you guys! I say we go to a

strip club and smoke cigars--

that 11 wake us up!

I got a better idea.

Rick STRETCHES.

Let's go night-night.

What?

I say we tie a bow on it and put

her to bed. This is gonna be a long

week so we should pace ourselves.

Baker looks at his watch.

It's only nine-thirty!

I'm with Rico.

Freddy tie-tie.

Are you guys serious?

Relax, guys, this is just the calm

before the storm. Get out the

plywood and batten down the

hatches.

That's right. Tonight we build up

strength, tomorrow we make

landfall.

SMASH CUT TO:

Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:

EXT. GOLF COURSE - MORNING

Rick, Fred, Hog-head, and Gary are stretching on the first

tee of a local FOUR-STAR GOLF RESORT while taking in the

sights. Nearby, we see the hotel swimming pool lined with

ATTRACTIVE WOMEN in bikinis.

47.

Wow. This place sure beats the hell

out of the Holiday Inn Express. Why

aren't you staying here?

Too pricey. Besides, since we're

paying for golf we get full access

to the resort--including the pool

bar.

Mothers, lock up your daughters--

the dogs are off the leash!

Turn-and-burn, baby!

Gary raises his hand for a HIGH-FIVE, but Rick balks.

Nope. I don't do that.

Hey, I say screw the golf--let's go

straight to the pool bar and start

getting you guys laid!

Hoch-head, relax, the pool bar ain't

going nowhere. Besides, it'll be

good for us to get a little sun

before making our grand entrance--

chicks love a healthy glow.

Plus it wouldn't hurt to work up a

little sweat--get those pheromones

flying.

Just then, two sexy BEER-CART GIRLS wave as they pass.

You talked me into it.

Hey, guys, look what I brought.

Gary holds up a ZIPLOCK BAG full of something chocolatey.

What's that?

Pot brownskies.

The guys all look at one another, baffled.

What, are we on spring break? Where

the hell'd you get those?

I got an in.

48.

With who?

Guy who washes my dog. Go ahead.

He holds out the bag and the guys hesitate.

Eating it isn't like smoking it.

It's a much mellower buzz--you'll

just feel relaxed.

Are they chocolatey?

As Hog-Head SNIFFS the brownies, Rick takes a practice swing.

Hog-head, come on, who eats pot

brownies at eleven in the morning

when they're playing golf?

John Daly?

And by the way, Rick, this is

spring break! You've got a hall

pass! Live it up, man! It'll

probably help your rap with the

ladies later.

Gary's right--when are we ever

gonna get the chance to do pot

brownies again?

Hog-Head takes a brownie and BITES INTO IT.

Mmm. These are yummy.

You don't even have a hall pass.

So? I can still live vicariously

through you guys, can't I?

It's not vicarious if you're

actually doing it.

Whatever. Just hit your ball.

Hog-Head takes ANOTHER BITE.

Oh, what the hell, it's not like my

game can get any worse.

49.

Rick watches Fred pick up a brownie and TENTATIVELY TASTE IT.

Then Gary INHALES HIS IN ONE BITE.

All right, give me one of those

things.

As Rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies, we

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

A dazed and confused Rick and Fred are RECLINING in their

cart in the middle of the fairway. For a while neither of

them speak. Then:

What kind of soap do you use?

You mean in the shower?

Yeah.

Dove.

Yeah, I like Dove--it doesn't dry

your skin so much.

Fred stares into space.

Sometimes it's hard to wash off,

though. Because of the moisturizer.

You ever notice--?

I think Hog-head's dead.

Fred looks over and sees Hog-head SPRAWLED OUT ON HIS BACK IN

A SAND TRAP. He's not moving.

Hog-head...? Are you okay?

As Hog-head starts to make SNOW ANGELS IN THE SAND, an

elderly COURSE RANGER pulls up in a golf cart.

What the hell is he doing?

Rick and Fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority

figure.

Uh, he's having back spasms.

50.

Not him. Him.

Rick and Fred turn and see Gary STANDING CHEST-DEEP in the

MIDDLE OF A POND just STARING AT THEM.

Gary! What are you doing?!

I don't know--you tell me!

Gary starts to LAUGH MANIACALLY. The Ranger turns to Rick,

annoyed.

Look, this is the third time I've

had to flag your group and you're

only on the fourth hole. Now if I

have to come out here again, you're

done for the day.

Gotcha. We'll pick it up, sir.

The Ranger shoots them a look and DRIVES OFF toward the TWO

ASIAN FOURSOMES waiting on the tee behind them.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

The four guys are unnaturally bunched together on another

fairway.

Think. Where did you last see it?

On the course.

Where on the course?

I don't know--on a fairway, I

think. I clot out, grabbed my club,

took a swing, and when I turned

around it had disappeared.

You're serious? You're telling us

you lost your golf cart?

Dude, where's my golf cart?

51.

Shut up, Fred.

Guys, I gotta go poo again.

I didn't lose it, I think it was

stolen.

Who would steal a golf cart?

Gary shrugs.

Criminals?

Does anyone have any napkins?

Look, all I know is I had it on the

seventh tee and now it's gone.

What are you talking about? We're

only on the sixth hole.

What? Did we miss a hole? Where's

my kids?

Rick closes his eyes and rubs his head, trying to keep it

together. Then he NOTICES something O.S..

Oh, come on, man!

ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Hog-head down in a greenside bunker

PULLING UP HIS PANTS. As he starts to KICK SAND over his

O.S. POOP like a cat in its litter box, we HEAR a noise and

the guys look up.

THEIR POV - the Golf Ranger comes flying over a hill heading

straight for them.

Run for it!

The guys run toward Rick's cart, jump in, and take off. Rick

and Fred are in the seats, while Gary and Hog-head HANG OFF

THE BACK. The cart BARRELS down a cart path with the Ranger

HOT IN PURSUIT.

He's gaining on us!

I can't go any faster, I've got it

floored!

52.

Cut through the woods!

Without slowing down, Rick TURNS SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT and

Gary and Hog-head TUMBLE OUT OF THE CART.

With panic etched across their sweaty faces, Gary and Hog-

head quickly jump to their feet and run after the cart. Rick

slows just enough for them to catch up and jump back on, then

he speeds down a maintenance path and DISAPPEARS INTO THE

WOODS.

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

Ed and Kimmy Long are sitting at an outside table having

lunch with their two young children. Their 7-Year-Old

Daughter is again dressed just like her mother and the 5-Year-

Old Son is dressed like the father.

Hey, Mom, look!

The family turns to see...

THEIR POV - a stoned-looking Rick, Fred, Hog-head and Gary

are driving the golf cart down the city street. They stop at

a traffic light beside them. All the guys stare straight

ahead, ZOMBIE-LIKE, except for Fred who NOTICES the Longs.

He nods.

Ed. Kimmy. Clones.

The light changes and as the golf cart DRIVES OFF through the

busy intersection, we go

BACK ON ED AND KIMMY shaking their heads.

Their poor wives.

EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

It's a picture perfect day as a THOUSAND PEOPLE watch a Cape

Cod League baseball game rom the comfort of their picnic

blankets. The home team has loaded the bases in the bottom

of the ninth and Grace, Maggie, MAGGIE'S PARENTS, and the

kids are CLAPPING ALONG WITH THE CROWD.

CRACK! The BATTER HITS A ROPE TO RIGHT FIELD, and as the

TYING and WINNING RUNS SCORE the PLACE GOES WILD.

SAME SCENE - LATER

The PLAYERS and FANS mingle on the field immediately after

the game.

53.

Grace and Maggie stand near the pitcher's mound as they watch

Maggie's kids run the bases. The wives look TANNED and

REFRESHED from several days laying on the beach.

Just then a big, goofy kid named GERRY approaches. He's a

strapping 22-year-old first baseman from Puerto Rico with a

perpetual SHIT-EATING GRIN.

Hey, I'm Gerry--thanks for coming

out and supporting us.

Oh, it was fun. You guys looked

good.

Thanks.

Gerry glances back at his TEAMMATES who are clearly egging

him on.

So...we saw you sitting up there

with those little kids--are you

nannies or something?

The girls aren't immune to flattery and they smile.

No, they're my kids.

Yeah, right. You have three kids?

Uh-huh.

A couple other PLAYERS amble over.

Dudes, they're not nannies, they're

mommies.

No way?!

Well, she is, not me. I'm not old

enough yet.

Maggie and the players LAUGH.

RICK COLEMAN (O.S.)

Guys!

The players turn to see their coach, RICK COLEMAN,

approaching with MAGGIE'S FATHER, mid-70's.

RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)

Time to pack things up--let's go!

The Players quickly scatter.

Maggie, Grace, this is Rick Coleman-

-the coach.

of hair and an easy-going manner.

I hope those clowns weren't

bothering you.

Oh, no, they were sweet.

Yeah. Cute kids.

So you're the guy who's been taking

money off my dad every Saturday on

the golf course?

I hate to break it to you but your

old man's the one who's been taking

all the money--he's a thief.

Maggie's Father LAUGHS.

RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)

Hey, everyone's coming back to my

place for some beers and a barbecue-

-why don't you join us?

Oh, thanks, but we've gotta get the

kids home.

Your mom and I will take 'em home.

You two go out and have a good time-

-cripes, you haven't been out all

week.

Grace perks up at this.

Oh, I don't know, Dad, we really

Excuse me, can I have a word with

you?

Grace pulls Maggie aside.

What's your problem?

55.

Oh, come on, Grace, these guys are

barely out of college, and, in case

you've forgotten, we're married.

To who? Last I heard, Rick and Fred

had the week off from marriage. So

remind me again--who are we married

to?

Maggie thinks about this.

Well...I guess one beer won't kill

us.

That's my girl.

Grace glances over at the ballplayers.

Why shouldn't we have fun? God

knows our guys are living it up.

A CLOSE-UP OF HOG-HEAD

What would you guys rather do--make-

out with a guy or let him blow you?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL that...

INT. ESPN SPORTS ZONE BAR - CONTINUOUS

.Our five guys are sitting at the bar drinking beer and

devouring plates of HOT WINGS. Around them we see about

fifty TV's BLARING twenty different sporting events. There's

ESPN logos everywhere and not a woman in sight.

And you've gotta pick one or

someone in your family will die--

that's the rule.

Oh boy, that's a toughie.

How long would you have to make-out

with him?

Ten minutes.

Tongue?

56.

Of course.

And how long would he have to blow

you?

Seven minutes.

Oof. I mean, getting blown by a

dude is bad, but making out with a

guy, it's so.. .intimate.

You think it's more intimate than

getting blown by a guy?

Way more.

All right, the hell with this shit,

I'm outta here.

Baker gets up from his stool.

What? Why?

I wanted to watch you guys pick up

chicks, not talk about dicks.

Hey, greased lightning, let off the

gas--sometimes these things take

time.

Baker's right. This is day three

and you haven't even talked to a

girl.

That's not exactly accurate, Gary.

Thanks to your scrumptious

brownies, I did spend half of last

night talking to Judy on the drug-

and-poison hotline.

Hog-head and Gary stand.

I guess I'm gonna get going, too.

Yeah, this is boring. You guys are

pussies.

57.

Hey, I haven't seen you guys talk

to any girls.

We don't have hall passes!

Come on, guys, let's go.

The three friends start to leave but Hog-head stops and

turns.

Hey, guys, it's all right if you

strike-out.. .but for godsakes, at

least take a couple of swings.

A moment later the guys are gone and a humbled Rick and Fred

sit there feeling alone.

This is actually good--you know,

that they're leaving. You don't

need five hunters to bag two birds.

No, you do not. And I love those

guys but, let's be honest, they're

not exactly chick-magnets.

You can say that again. Yep, the

steak always looks better if you

trim away some of the fat. And

let's face it, we are the steak.

Dream team, baby.

The guys CLINK BEERS. Then:

Maybe we should call the girls and

ask them to come home.

Fred glances at him, aghast.

What?

Who are we kidding, man? Do you

really think we're going to be

picking up any girls this week?

Why wouldn't we?

Because that's not us anymore.

Wait a second. You want to quit?

58.

Fred, we're not the same guys we

were fifteen years ago, back when

we were single. We've changed.

Fred stares at him, incredulous.

No, man, you've changed. All you

care about is yourself--what about

all the guys out there who are

counting on us to make this thing

work?

What are you talking about?

Don't you get it?

We're the chosen ones!

Fred stands up and points at Rick.

That's right--this thing is bigger

than us! Our wives didn't give us

this hall pass, the good Lord did!

And what do we have to show for it?

Nothing.

Come off it, Fred. Obviously

hooking up isn't something we

really want--if it was, we could've

done it by now.

Could we have?

Rick is taken aback by this.

Well ...of course. I mean, if we'd

really wanted to.

Guess what? I did want to. And you

know how close I got? We're three

days in and the only woman I've

spoken to was our waitress at

Outback. And she never even made

eye-contact.

I don't really care if some

waitress makes eye-contact. I want

to go home--I miss my wife and

kids.

59.

Let me explain something to you: If

Grace and Maggie find out we can't

get laid on our own, they'll start

thinking we need them to get laid.

Do you know what that'll do to the

balance of power in our homes?

It'll destroy it!

Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed.

Well, what if we just tell them

that we did hook up?

We can't. Grace'll know. She always

knows when I'm lying.

Hey, what about a massage parlor?

No! That's giving up.

Fred glares at him.

You don't get it, do you? A hall

pass ain't all about sex. It's

about being man enough to pick up a

woman even though you may not be

what--in the traditional sense--is

considered...

(makes quotes with

.good-looking, or...

(finger quotes again)

.appealing.

Rick seems stung by this news.

Look, if we can't show that

something positive can come from

having a hall pass, then the whole

concept is dead. Not just for

us...but for all mankind.

Rick thinks about this for a moment, then stands up with a

RENEWED SENSE OF PURPOSE.

All right, let's get out of here. I

know exactly where we should be.

EXT. BALL TEAM BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

The party's in full swing. A hundred or so PLAYERS, PLAYER'S

GIRLFRIENDS, and FRIENDS are in and out of the pool, drinking

beer and rocking out to Arcade Fire on the boombox.

60.

ANGLE ON Maggie and Rick Coleman sipping beers while in the

b.g. we see Grace PLAYING VOLLEYBALL in the pool (still in

the shorts and t-shirt she wore that afternoon.)

So how about you, Rick, do you have

any children?

Nah, but maybe some day. Your mom

keeps talking about hooking me up

with your cousin Kate.

Maggie LAUGHS.

RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)

That's not a good sign.

No, I hardly know her. She moved to

Miami when I was eight.

That's what your mom said. I coach

at the University of Miami.

Then you should go out with her.

Nice try.

So how about yourself--how long you

been married?

Uh...fourteen years. We were

college sweethearts.

Nice. And where is he this week?

He's up in Boston.

Poor guy. All work and no play,

huh?

Maggie forces a smile.

Something like that.

Suddenly Grace is PROPELLED OUT OF THE WATER and UP ONTO

GERRY'S SHOULDERS.

Stop it! What are you doing?!

61.

Gerry LAUGHS and BOUNCES AROUND THE POOL and Grace and Maggie

and the coach can't help but LAUGH along with him, as we

EXT. RAMADA INN - NIGHT

Rick and Fred pull into the hotel's lot in the mini-van. As

Rick gets out, Fred reaches behind his seat and comes out

clutching a MOTORCYCLE HELMET. Rick stares at him.

Chicks dig motorcycles.

INT. RAMADA INN OLDIE'S BAR - NIGHT

It's 80's night and a Hall & Oates cover band is PLAYING

complete with look-alikes, except Oates is black. Behind the

band there's a banner that reads: 'Ramada Inn proudly

welcomes the Mutual of Omaha Leadership Council!' We see

middle-aged CORPORATE TYPES everywhere.

". .Oh-oh here she comes, watch out

boy she'll chew you up. Oh-oh here

she comes, she's a maneater..."

ANGLE ON THE BAR where Rick and Fred are checking out the

scene. Fred is WEARING THE HELMET. (It's a huge BLACK,

OVERSIZED HELMET WITH A VISOR.) He pulls it off, SHAKES OUT

HIS HAIR, and places it prominently ON THE BAR.

Jackpot, baby.

Rick NOTICES SOMETHING O.S..

How about those two?

ANGLE ON two pretty LATINO WOMEN sitting alone at a table.

Ooh, yeah. Daddy likes.

Fred pulls a piece of paper out of his back pocket and hands

it to Rick.

What's this?

I went on-line this afternoon and

wrote down some good pick-up lines

to break the ice.

'Hi. Will you help me find my

puppy? I think he ran into the

cheap hotel across the street.'

62.

That's a good one--except for one

thing: We don't have a puppy, so

when she gets there she'll realize

we're full of shit.

Rick shoots him a look.

I don't think it's supposed to be

for real. It's just to make her

laugh so she'll talk to you.

Fred considers this.

Oh God no, it doesn't work on that

level. Here, this is my favorite.

He takes the paper from Rick.

'You must be from Ireland because

when I look at you my penis is

Dublin.'

It's a charmer but you know what?

We don't need phony pick-up lines.

Why don't we just be ourselves?

Great. If you know how to.

Rick takes a DEEP BREATH and braces himself.

Give me the helmet.

Fred hands him the helmet, then Rick marches up to the two

Latino Women with the helmet under his arm and Fred close on

his heels.

Hi.

The women give him a pleasant look.

Hello.

Fred gives a little wave from behind Rick.

Hola.

LONG BEAT as Rick tries to figure what to say next. Then:

Well.. .this is awkward. I feel like

I'm back at my first junior high

school mixer.

63.

Rick and Fred force a LAUGH and the girls smile. Another

LONG, UNCOMFORTABLE BEAT. Rick clears his throat.

So...are you ladies from Ireland?

No.

RICK.

I'm very surprised to hear that

news, because when I look at you my

penis doubles in size.

The women FLINCH at this, losing their smiles. Fred leans in.

No, he means his dick is Dublin.

Like the city. In Ireland.

As the girls turn away from them, we begin a...

MUSIC MONTAGE - Hall & Oates' I Can't Go For That plays as

our GUYS GET SHOT DOWN by a DOZEN DIFFERENT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

SAME SCENE - LATER

Rick and Fred are at the bar looking TIRED and FRUSTRATED.

I have this overwhelming urge to

donkey-kick everyone in this bar.

Okay, tiger, keep your chin up--no

one said this was going to be easy.

Even in college you had to take

fifty rejections for every score,

remember?

Yeah, but it didn't sting so much

when I was drunk.

Fred perks up.

That's it! We should be drinking!

You're right. We're too stiff.

Way too stiff. We gotta start

pounding 'em, get those creative

juices flowing, bring the soul to

the surface.

Rick smiles.

64.

That's when we're at our most

charming!

SMASH CUT TO:

SAME SCENE - LATER

A HAMMERED Fred is HOLDING A HAND OVER ONE EYE as he SHOUTS

at a table full of GORGEOUS YOUNG WOMEN.

You say no to me? You say no to

me?! I SAY NO TO YOU!

He's being restrained by an unusually patient BOUNCER. In

the b.g. we see Rick PASSED OUT ON A STOOL in a VERY AWKWARD

POSITION.

Come on, buddy, let's go...

The women glare at Fred with disgust, maybe even a little

amusement.

No, screw them!

(pointing at the women)

You think your shit don't stink?!

Well I got news for ya: I wouldn't

titty-bang you in a snow storm!

(mocking),

Oh, please, sir, please titty-bang

us in a snow storm!

The women LAUGH.

Nope, you blew it, not gonna

happen.

(still restraining Fred)

There you go, mister, you got 'em

good. Now let's go.

As the Bouncer drags him toward the exit, a STUNNING GIRL

passes them WEARING TIGHT LEATHER PANTS with an AMERICAN FLAG

PRINT ON THE BUTT. Fred turns to her.

Hey, sweetie, you need a pole for

that flag?

A worn-out-looking Rick is working at his desk when Fred

approaches (with a BLACK EYE.)

I know what we've been doing wrong.

Rick lifts his chin.

If we're gonna break out of this

slump, we've got to start using our

strength. And that is.. .people who

know us, like us. So we should go

after the women we've already won

over.

You mean like our wives?

Yeah, like that, but not them.

Fred sits in the chair across from Rick.

I was thinking Coffee Girl.

You've won over Coffee Girl?

Well, I'm sure she'd recognize me.

Rick thinks about this.

Look, if you really want to go

after someone you already know,

have you considered Missy

Frankenfield?

Fred's listening.

she's beautiful, you k now her phone n ow-

she's horny.

What's up, beach bunnies?

Grace and Maggie sit up and smile.

What are you doing here?

He KICKS OFF THE SKI, then runs over and SHAKES HIS WET BODY

ALL OVER THE GIRLS.

Gerry, stop it!

Hey, where are the kiddies? We

thought we'd take you all for a

boat ride.

My parents took them to Martha's

Vineyard for the weekend.

Just then, we hear a LOUD HORN. They look up to see the boat

pulling close to shore. Rick Coleman is behind the wheel and

a couple PLAYERS are in the back. Maggie waves.

The two women look at each other--why not? As they get up

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Rick stands in line at the coffee shop looking casual in

slacks and a Harvard t-shirt. Music plays. He peers ahead

and sees the Wannabe Artist-Type taking the order of a

TEENAGE GIRL. At the other register, Coffee Girl is also

taking orders. Rick is hoping to get Coffee Girl but Wannabe

gets to him first.

Can I take your order?

Rick sees that there's no one behind him. He turns to the

Wannabe.

Uh...I don't know what I want.

Wannabe stares at him, waiting. Rick hesitates a few

moments, then levels with the guy.

Look, man, I want her to take my

order.

Why?

Uh, she knows how I like it.

Little help, Leigh--your unique

barista skills have been requested.

Rick waves weakly to Leigh and winks. As Leigh approaches,

Wannabe mocks Rick by waving at him and winking.

Hi. What would you like?

Rick was hoping to have a conversation but Wannabe is

crowding them.

Iced coffee. With two Splendas.

Leigh rings him up.

That'll be two dollars.

Rick hands her a fiver and nods toward the speakers.

By the way, nice tunes. Do you

choose 'em or do they come down

from corporate?

Me. It's Snow Patrol.

68.

She hands Rick his change and he dumps it in the tip jar.

Nice soundtrack. Pretty solid

movie, too.

Wannabe BARKS out a LAUGH.

Dude, you're thinking of Snow Do s--

the Cuba Gooding kiddie flick. This

is Snow Patrol, the band.

Rick shrugs, a little embarrassed.

Thanks for the tip.

As Leigh grabs a cup and goes to make the coffee, Wannabe

SAYS SOMETHING to her that WE CAN'T HEAR and they both LAUGH.

A PHONE RINGS in the employee room. Leigh hands Wannabe the

coffee, then runs back to answer it. Wannabe hands Rick the

iced coffee and winks at him.

Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced

coffee, mister.

Rick starts to go, then turns around and stares at Wannabe.

Wannabe, comforted by the counter between them, smiles back.

Why are you smiling? You think this

counter is some alligator-infested

moat?

Rick's stare becomes a glare and Wannabe loses his smile.

This little 'I'm-on-the-inside, too-

cool-for-school, let's-laugh-at-the-

routine's gonna get you hurt. After

you lose all of your family's money

on your avante garde piece of crap

short film, you're going to need a

job. And it's guys like me that

hire. And guys like me don't hire

punks like you. So shape up.

As Rick turns and walks out, we PAN over to see that Leigh

HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Rick sits alone at a table on the sidewalk drinking his

coffee. He NOTICES some postcards advertising a two-week

free trial at the local gym and starts to read them.

LEIGH (O.S.)

I work-out there.

69.

Rick looks up, suddenly finding himself alone with Leigh.

You do?

Leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables.

I work-out at home, but I was

thinking of going public with my

work-outs. What do you squat?

She seems amused by this.

I don't really squat, just run on

the hamster-wheel everyday after

work.

She starts wiping down a table.

So did you go to Harvard?

She nods at Rick's t-shirt.

Yeah.

I mean, you know...I went to a

party there once.

Coffee Girl GIGGLES and Rick perks up.

Actually, this is Harvard Health

Care. Sleep apnea... snoring too

much.

(holds up gym postcard)

So is this a good place to join?

Great place. Real chill. And they

have a bar, so I always grab a beer

after my workout.

Bitchin'. Sounds like a nice

routine. Maybe I'll routine it,

too.

If you join, tell 'em Leigh sent

you--they'll give me two free

months.

I'll do that, Leigh.

Rockin'.

Leigh gives him the peace sign.

MISSY FRANKENFIELD (V.0.)

Hi, this is Missy. Sorry I missed

your call. I'm out of town for a

few days, and I may have limited

cell reception. Please leave a

message and I'll get back to you as

soon as I can. BEEP.

Fred mouths the word 'shit', then picks up the receiver.

Hey, Missy, this is Fred Searing.

I . uh, I dust wanted to give you a

ring and, um...well, give me a call

when you get back. It's kind of an

emergency. Well, not life-

threatening, but--

The machine CUTS HIM OFF. Fred HANGS UP, dejected. He sits

there for a BEAT, then grabs his keys and GOES OUT THE DOOR.

EXT. STRIP MALL - LATE AFTERNOON

TIGHT ON FRED - he's wearing SHADES and has a BASEBALL CAP

pulled down over his eyes.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL that he's outside a MASSAGE PARLOR. As

he approaches the massage parlor entrance, a bunch of LADIES

walk out of the TRAVEL AGENCY just to the right so Fred veers

into the DRY CLEANERS to the left.

INT. DRY CLEANERS - CONTINUOUS

Fred ENTERS and immediately bumps into Kimmy Long (Ed's wife)

standing in line behind several other WOMEN. She is

accompanied by her 7-year-old daughter and neither of them

look happy to see him.

Oh, hi.

Kimmy nods blankly. The Daughter glares at him. Fred

nervously steps up next to them in line, passing time as he

waits for the sidewalk to clear.

Um, I don't think I got a chance to

tell you how impressed I was with

your new place. Absolutely elegant.

Kimmy GRUNTS a thank you and turns away from him.

ANGLE ON the KOREAN LADY who owns the dry cleaners. She

stands behind the desk with an accordion wall behind her.

DRY CLEAN KOREAN LADY

Mr. Searing, you pick up last week--

no more clothes here!

Fred comes out of the dry cleaners, makes sure the coast is

clear, then DUCKS INTO THE MASSAGE PARLOR.

INT. MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

A YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN is behind the counter.

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN

You want massage?

Fred looks around. There's an OLD KOREAN LADY sitting on a

couch. He looks at the Young Korean Woman and nods.

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONT'D)

You fill out.

The Young Korean Woman hands Fred a form. Fred puts it down

and covertly moves in.

I'd prefer no paper trail.

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN

Need for insurance company.

I don't think my insurance

company's gonna cover this one.

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN

Ten dollar co-pay?

Uh, no.

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN

Fill out form. It policy.

Fred moves in closer.

72.

Look, I don't really want this in

print.

The Young Korean Woman hands him back the form.

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN

How I know what you want if you no

fill out form?

Um, couldn't I just tell you?

She stares at him for a LONG BEAT.

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN

So, what you waiting for?!

Fred glances back at the Old Korean Lady, then WHISPERS in

the Young Korean Woman's ear. She nods and looks at him.

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONT'D)

Okay.. .but must see I.D. first.

Fred SIGHS and pulls out a hundred-dollar bill.

How about a C-note so I don't have

to fill out any forms or show any

I.D.'s?

The Young Korean Woman thinks about this for a moment, then

SLIDES OPEN THE ACCORDION WALL behind her, REVEALING...

THE DRY CLEANERS NEXT DOOR - the Dry Cleaning Korean Lady

looks back at him, along with Kimmy Long, her daughter, and

ALL THE OTHER WOMEN IN LINE.

YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN

Gentleman want a rub-and-tug with

tea-bag happy ending but don't fill

out form!

Kimmy Long glares at him, appalled. As Fred backpedals OUT

OF THE MASSAGE PARLOR, he waves at her weakly, and we...

EXT. PARTY BOAT - DAY

One hundred GUESTS dance on the top deck of this large ship

as the Bee Gee's Night Fever BLASTS from the speakers.

.Night fever, night fever.. .we

know how to do it...'

As the song heats up, the crowd parts, REVEALING... Rick

Coleman and Gerry decked-out in WHITE, TONY-MANARO-SUITS.

They're DANCING UP A STORM with Maggie and Grace who are

thrilled to be in such capable hands. Grace is getting

tossed around a bit, but it's clear that Maggie can hold her

own on a dance floor.

73.

The crowd soon FORMS A CIRCLE around the two couples, and as

Rick and Gerry SWING AND LIFT our delighted and breathless

wives, we

SAME SCENE - LATER

Maggie and Rick Coleman are standing at the rail of the boat

taking a breather.

Wow. You can really move out there.

Maggie shrugs modestly.

Thanks. I was a dance major in

college.

Really? I always wondered--what do

you do with a degree in dance?

Well, as it turned out, nothing.

I guess the original plan was to go

to New York and try to hook-up with

one of the big dance companies, but

then I got married and. . .your

priorities change.

She looks away, maybe a little embarrassed.

Anyway, that was fun. I haven't

danced this much in a long time.

Why not?

I don't know, you get busy, kids,

school, there's so much going on.

Well you gotta make time for the

stuff you love or you'll forget who

you are.

Maggie appreciates the sentiment. She makes strong eye-

contact with Rick for a moment, but catches herself and looks

away.

You know, my husband's name is

Rick.

Rick smiles at this.

74.

Well that makes me the perfect guy

to have an affair with--you'd never

have to worry about screaming out

the wrong name during sex.

Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable.

RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)

I'm kidding.

I know.

Now come on, let's go find Grace

and get something to eat. I'm

starving.

As they head back to the party, we

INT. RICK'S TOYOTA AVALON - LATE AFTERNOON

Rick is parked across the street from FITNESS FIRM HEALTH

CLUB. He's reading the newspaper and glancing at the

entrance for Leigh. Suddenly there's a LOUD TAP on the

window and Rick looks over to see Flats (who we met at Rick's

poker night) standing outside with a shit-eating grin. Rick

rolls down the window.

Hey, Rick.

Oh...hey, Flats. How you doing,

man?

Great. What's up with you? How's

that hall pass thing going?

Rick makes a Scooby Doo sound, alarmed.

Who told you about that--was it Hog-

head?

No. Some old lady was yakking about

it down at the post office.

Rick REACTS to this.

So what's the deal--you getting

laid?

What? No.

75.

I don't know where you're getting

your information, Flats, but a hall

pass isn't just about getting laid,

it's about getting a week off from

marriage to do as you please--

whether that be fishing, or

watching TV, whatever it is that

relaxes you.

Oh, I didn't know that.

Just then Rick NOTICES Leigh (dressed in work-out clothes)

walking down the sidewalk toward the gym.

Uh, Flatsy, I gotta run. I'm late

for my work-out appointment.

When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym

shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt. He hesitates, then

grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS

WAIST. Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh.

Hey, girl!

All right! You decided to go for

it.

As Rick follows Leigh into the gym, a smiling Flats CALLS

Hey, Rick! Good luck with the

fishing!

As Flats begins to LAUGH, a sheepish Rick scurries into the

building.

INT. FITNESS FIRM HEALTH CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

Rick and Leigh stand at the front desk. A young, buff dude,

CLYDE, looks up from folding towels.

Clyde, this is my friend, uh...

Rick.

He's looking to join.

Great. I'll get you signed up.

Leigh pats Rick's hand.

See ya.

76.

She turns to leave.

So, uh, are you gonna grab a

brewski after your work-out?

Nah.

Rick looks disappointed.

I'm gonna grab two.

Leigh flashes him a smile and as she walks away, she gives

him the peace sign. He returns it.

Peace it!

As soon as he hears himself, Rick cringes.

CLOSE ON RICK'S FACE - he's wearing the headphones and has

worked up a PRETTY GOOD SWEAT.

PULL BACK to reveal that he's SITTING ON THE TOILET.

INT. HEALTH CLUB - MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

We hear a FLUSH. Rick shuffles out of a stall and moves to a

sink. While he washes his hands, a young, NAKED, METROSEXUAL-

TYPE whips his leg into the sink beside him. Rick slowly

turns to look.

RICK'S POV - as the Metrosexual talks to ANOTHER NAKED MAN,

he fills his hand with SHAVING CREAM and the hand DISAPPEARS

BETWEEN HIS OWN LEGS. The guys continue their conversation,

unfazed. Then the Metrosexual starts to SHAVE HIS BALLS.

As Rick dries his hands, he can't contain himself.

What's that about--you swimming the

English Channel?

The Metrosexual shoots Rick an annoyed look.

Nah, Just not into looking like the

knuckle-dragging guy on the

evolution-of-man chart.

Off Rick looking self-consciously down at his fur-covered

body, we go...

INT. HOT TUB ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Rick ENTERS the empty hot tub room, takes off his towel, and

eases into the STEAMING WATER. He hits a button and the jets

kick on FULL BLAST, turning the hot tub into a BUBBLY

CAULDRON.

77.

Oh...yes.

He bunches up his towel and puts it behind his head, then

settles in and CLOSES HIS EYES.

SAME SCENE - LATER

Rick is in a DEEP SLEEP. His mouth is wide open but his head

is BARELY ABOVE WATER as he SNORES LOUDLY. He dips beneath

the surface and as he begins to CHOKE and COUGH, he wakes up.

Rick takes a moment to get his bearings, then STRUGGLES to

get out of the hot tub. But his MUSCLES HAVE TURNED TO JELLY.

Little help...

When none comes, a life-and-death STRUGGLE ensues as the

flabby, middle-aged dad tries to climb to safety.

Help ...me...

Just as Rick starts to go under, the two young naked

metrosexuals hear his MOANS and come to his rescue. They

jump in the hot tub and heave him ashore. As Rick GASPS for

air, one of the metrosexuals kneels down and lifts Rick's

head onto his NAKED LAP.

Are you having chest pains, sir?

No, no, I think I was...in the hot

tub too long. I can't feel my body.

How long were you in there?

What time is it?

Seven-thirty.

About three hours.

That's when Rick realizes that his head is RESTING ON THE

GUY'S COCK. He tries to roll off him, but Metrosexual #1

HOLDS HIM TIGHT.

Try not to move, sir.

I'm okay, just help me up.

78.

All right, give him a hand.

Metrosexual #2 straddles Rick's chest and leans down to pull

him up. As Rick starts to rise, HIS FACE COMES PERILOUSLY

CLOSE TO THE SECOND MAN'S O.S. DANGLING COCK and Rick has to

TURN HIS HEAD TO AVOID CONTACT.

They finally get Rick to his feet. As the naked men help him

across the room, we

ANGLE ON - two TANNED, HAIRLESS METROSEXUAL ASSES flanking

Rick's HIRSUTE BUTT.

Okay, thanks, guys. I can take it

from here.

The metrosexuals release Rick and he gets about two steps

before his LEGS GIVE OUT and he TUMBLES DOWN A SMALL FLIGHT

OF STEPS.

SMASH CUT TO:

Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:

INT. RICK AND FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

A depressed Rick and Fred sit in bed numbing their pain by

WATCHING THE BOURNE SUPREMACY and eating a couple PINTS OF

BEN AND JERRY'S ICE CREAM.

We let down the male species.

I really thought our hall passes

might change the philosophy of

marriage in America.

Fred eats a big scoop of ice cream.

I envisioned a national holiday,

right between July 4th and Labor

Day, like the first Friday in

August, Hall Pass Day; a day for

husbands to get some strange, a day

that would forever be known as the

holiday,that saved the institution

of marriage.

All right, don't give up.

I'm not giving up, I'm facing facts-

-this is our last day and we got

nothing cooking. Maybe you were

right. Maybe we should just tell

the girls to come home.

79.

No. I want the hall pass.

Fred looks at Rick, surprised.

At first I wasn't sure, but now I

want the dream.

I'm not even sure I know what the

dream is anymore.

I just...I just want to know what

it's like to be with another woman.

Well, just pull up one of the

golden oldies in your spank bank--

it's almost like being there.

I don't have anything in that spank

bank.

I'm talking about all the girls

before you met Maggie.

Rick doesn't say anything.

What?

No, you're not serious?

Rick lowers his head.

Wait a second, are you saying...?

But how can that be--you didn't

meet Maggie until college?

Yeah, so? What do you think,

everyone gets laid in high school?

I got news for you, mister--getting

laid in high school is not a right,

it's a privilege.

Fred puts down his ice cream. Rick SIGHS.

First class, first day, freshman

year, I saw Maggie--she was sitting

three seats away in Western Civ--

and I fell in love instantly. I

begged her for three months to go

out with me, she finally caved, and

that night I told her I loved her.

80.

Eighty-four days later she told me

she loved me back and we've been

together ever since.

Fred stares at him.

Wow. That's a really creepy story.

Just then Fred's cell phone RINGS and he ANSWERS it.

Hello.

Yeah.

Oh, okay, great.

Fred hangs up but doesn't say anything.

Who was that?

Just an angel from heaven.

Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet.

INT. BEACH COTTAGE - AFTERNOON

BOUQUET OF FLOWERS and an open GIFT BOX displaying an

ENGRAVED I.D. BRACELET.

Does this mean you're going steady?

That's not funny. I feel terrible--

the poor kid's spending all his

hard-earned money on me--that's

sad. Cute, but sad.

Grace, you should be flattered.

You're thirty-eight-years-old and

college kids are still swooning

over you.

Well I just feel bad if I gave him

the wrong impression.

81.

The wrong impression? What makes

you think that--I mean, besides the

flowers, I.D. bracelet, and love

letter?

Maggie picks up a card.

'Dearest Grace--Our final game is

tonight. Please meet me at the

coach's place afterwards to

celebrate. Yours truly, Gerry.'

Thanks for piling on.

Grace stands up and SIGHS.

Well...I can't accept this. I guess

I'm just gonna have to go set him

straight.

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF A PIZZERIA UNO - NIGHT

INT. PIZZERIA UNO - SAME

Rick and Fred are sitting at a table sharing a pizza while

Fred texts someone.

What are you doing?

Just texting Missy Frankenfield

that we're going to be at Enter the

Dragon--I'm covering all my bases.

You don't need Missy Frankenfield

tonight. If we can't get the job

done with Coakley as our wingman,

then we're pathetic.

Just then, Fred NOTICES something O.S.

All right, here come da man!

CLOSE ON RESTAURANT ENTRANCE - a suave, DEBONAIR MAN (played

by George Clooney) comes through the doors and stops to check

out the room.

Rick and Fred jump up and approach him WITH OPEN ARMS but at

the last second Clooney steps aside REVEALING a THIN, BALDING

MAN dressed HEAD-TO-TOE IN MOTORCYCLE LEATHERS (think Larry

David.)

Coakley!

82.

My two favorite nutsuckers--how the

hell are ya?!

The three men hug, then Coakley nods toward Clooney.

See who just walke ( in here in

front of me?

No, who?

George Clooney.

What's he doing here?

I don't know--must be shooting a

movie or something.

Huh. Look, man, we've got a

situation on our hands.

Yeah, yeah, Baker filled me in.

S'been rough sledding, huh?

Coakley puts his arms around the two guys.

Well, don't worry, my little

snickerdicks...Coakley's here.

EXT. ENTER THE DRAGON NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

A mass of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS and SLICK GUYS vie for position

outside this CROWDED CLUB.

REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS Rick, Fred and Coakley watching from

across the street.

I'm gonna need three-hundred bucks.

For what?

Coakley shoots him a look.

If you're really serious about

this, stop questioning me.

The guys look at each other, then reluctantly COUGH UP THE

DOUGH. With money in hand, Coakley marches confidently

across the street followed by Fred and Rick. When the SLICK

BOUNCER sees them approaching, he PARTS THE CROWD.

83.

Good evening, Mr. Coakley.

What up, my guy?

Coakley PASSES ON THE MONEY with a handshake and the Bouncer

UNHOOKS THE VELVET ROPE. Then Coakley smiles back at Fred

and Rick.

Push the defrost button on the

microwave, boys. The deep freeze is

over.

INT. ENTER THE DRAGON NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

Coakley leads them into the club. Rick and Fred can't

believe all the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE around them.

Okay, guys, you tried it your way

and you railed miserably. You

struck out, you were oh-for-

everything. So now we do it my way,

which is...

The guys look at Coakley like Richard Gere looks at the Dalai

Lama.

. Go ugly early.

Rick and Fred are visibly deflated.

Guys, you're not trying to get

married here--you're trying to get

laid.

Aren't you the guy who goes to the

Hawaiian Tropic finals every year?

Is that for the ugly girls?

I go to the Tropic finals because

Miss North Dakota's gonna lose and

she's gonna need a hug. And quite

often you can parlay a hug into a

hand-job. Rick, you're up--get us

two bottles of Moet and six

glasses.

Rick shoots Fred a look, then weaves his way through a scrum

of PEOPLE up to the bar. He tries to flag down a bartender

but can't get anyone's attention.

PAIGE (O.S.)

Hi, Mr. Mills.

Rick turns to see that he's crammed in beside his babysitter

Paige who's looking a LITTLE TIPSY.

84.

Oh, hey, Paige. What are you doing

here?

She pulls out her license and holds it up.

I turned twenty-one yesterday.

I'm legal now.

Oh. Well, happy birthday. You out

celebrating?

Yeah, I'm here with my Aunt Meg.

Paige points across the club to AUNT MEG, a striking redhead,

early 40's, who's talking to a couple of YOUNG MEN.

She's the best. Forty-two years old

but she still parties like she's my

age.

Nice.

Rick continues to try to get the bartender's attention.

So, Rick, how's the hall pass

going?

Paige smirks at Rick who shrinks a little.

You don't mind if I call you Rick,

do you? I am officially an adult

now.

No, of course not--what did you

just say?

I was asking about your hall pass.

(off Rick's look)

I baby-sit for the Putneys and I

heard Gary talking about it the

other night at their barbecue.

Rick REACTS to this.

He was talking about it at a

barbecue?!

Oh, he wasn't saying it in a bad

way.

In fact, I thought it was very

classy of you to be staying at the

Holiday Inn Express instead of

bringing girls back to your home

with all the kids' pictures and

schoolwork taped up everywhere.

Rick forces a smile.

Thank you.

A male BARTENDER, 25, finally appears in front of Rick.

Yeah, um, two bottles of Moet and

six glasses please.

Paige eyes Rick as she sips her drink.

So does it work both ways?

What?

The hall pass. Does your wife get

one, too.

Uh, no, no. A hall pass is for men

only.

Oh. Who made that rule?

Well ...um...

As Rick thinks about this, Paige moves in tighter.

By the way, I kind of owe you an

apology.

(lowers her voice,

Last week ful) when you drove me home, I

that.

Oh, don't worry about it. It was a

big misunderstanding.

No, it wasn't.

She takes a moment, looks around.

86.

If you thought I was coming on to

you that night, it's because...I

was.

Rick flinches at this. Just then the Bartender returns with

the champagne. Rick fumbles through his pocket and finally

pays. Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love-

with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage.

Yeah. Um...I have to go, Paige, but

it was great seeing you.

Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go. She looks suddenly

annoyed.

Are you serious? You're doing this

again... even with a hall pass?

Paige, you're my kids' babysitter.

Have a happy birthday.

As Rick walks away, we go

BACK ON COAKLEY AND FRED as Rick arrives with the champagne.

Here we go, bubbles doth floweth.

Holy crap... look who's here.

The guys turn to see the coffee girl, Leigh, walking past

with two of her GIRLFRIENDS. She sees them and LIGHTS UP.

Hey, Rick! What happened yesterday--

I thought we were gonna grab a

beer?

Fred looks at Rick, confused.

Yeah, I got a little caught up in

my curls and reps and shit.

So is this your playground?

Nah, I've never been here, but a

friend of mine's DJ-ing tonight so

I promised him I'd come.

Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives

Leigh a kiss on the cheek. He has a pair of headphones

hanging around his neck.

Wassup, girl?

87.

Wannabe NOTICES Rick and loses his smile.

Oh. Hey. What are you doing here--

you auditing the place?

Actually, I work for Sirius XM

Radio--we're looking to hire some

new deejays so I'm checking out all

the clubs.

Wannabe stiffens, suddenly respectful.

Oh. Cool. Are you serious?

Not!

Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the

deflated Wannabe.

Oh, that's hip. Real fresh.

(turns to Leigh)

Why don't you hit the dance floor--

the next song's gonna be for you.

As Leigh's Girlfriends pull her onto the dance floor, Wannabe

returns to his deejay booth.

Beer? When were you two going to

have a beer?

No, no, no, Leigh and I just belong

to the same gym and happened to be

there at the same time yesterday

afternoon.

What gym do you belong to and where

the hell was I?

Well, according to Kimmy Long, you

were at the massage parlor trying

to get a rub-and-tug without

filling out the paperwork.

This takes the wind out of Fred's sails.

What?

Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick glares at Fred.

88.

I thought the massage parlor was

admitting defeat?

I had a knot in my neck--why the

hell didn't you tell me you saw

Coffee Girl?!

Okay, guys, cut the crap. We're all

here for the same thing. And I'll

give you a hint what that thing is:

It begins with a 'P' and ends with

an 'ussy.'

Coakley puts his arm around Fred.

Now relax, Fredd , everyone's gonna

get taken care ot.

(looks out at crowd)

We Just gotta find you a gazelle

with a bad wheel.

Huh?

Coakley spots something.

Ooh--there's a couple of

trainwrecks. Let's go.

Whoa--wait a second.

But Coakley steers Fred over to two CHUBBY, NOT-SO-ATTRACTIVE

BLONDES laying on a 'bed' in the corner.

Ladies, this is my friend Fred

Pinkberry--his yogurt company just

went public and he's out

celebrating. He'd like to offer you

a flute of champagne.

The Chubby Blondes PERK UP.

I love Pinkberry!

As the girls make room for a reluctant Fred, we go...

BACK ACROSS THE ROOM where we see Rick watching Leigh and her

hot girlfriends DANCE. Leigh catches Rick staring. He

smiles and clumsily shoots her the PEACE SIGN. Finally, he

takes a deep breath and DANCES HIS WAY UP NEXT TO HER.

So.. .having a good time?

89.

Chillin'.

Me too. Just chillin' and wigglin'.

LONG BEAT as they dance. Then:

I haven't been ancing in a long

time.

I can tell.

Oh yeah? Just try to keep up.

She smiles at this, then Coakley DANCES UP BESIDE RICK and

PULLS HIM ASIDE.

Abort! Abort! You stand not a

chance.

No, no, I think we're starting to

gel.

Coakley rolls his eyes.

No, no, you're mistaken. Look,

dude, this ain't Operation Cock-

block here--now trust me, retreat.

Rick glances back at Leigh, torn. She looks fantastic.

Coak, I'm never gonna have another

hall pass, so this memory has to

last a lifetime. . .you know what I

mean?

Coakley looks at Leigh and SIGHS.

All right, I'll be at the bar when

this thing blows up in your face.

As Rick dances back over to Leigh, we...

PAN ACROSS THE ROOM to the PISSED-OFF Wannabe watching them

from the deejay booth.

All right, 'all, adult-swim's

over. Now if you was born before

1980 you're gonna want to step off

the floor 'cause we're about to

kick it up.

90.

ON RICK - he looks over at Wannabe but CONTINUES TO DANCE.

Is this guy your boyfriend or

something?

No, no, no.

She waves it off, then shrugs guiltily.

One time we messed around a little.

And what does 'messed around a

little' mean these days?

Anal.

Rick tries hard to act nonchalant.

I'm kidding. He kissed me one night

and I kissed back--I shouldn't

have.

WANNABE (O.S.)

Seriously, you grandpappies better

get off the floor before someone

falls and breaks a hip!

Rick points at Wannabe.

Just play your funky music, white

boy!

INT. BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT

then pushes the button.

Hola, Maggie, this is Isabel. I

went to clean the house today but

nobody has been there or slept in

any of the beds this week, so I

just cleaned the windows and left

early. I hope you don't mind.

CLOSE ON a concerned-looking Maggie. She moves to the

window, stares at the lights on the ocean.

91.

RICK COLEMAN (O.S.)

Hey.

Maggie turns to see Rick Coleman standing out on her front

porch.

Oh. Hey.

She goes to the screen door.

Thought you might want to help me

celebrate the end of the season.

He holds up a grocery bag.

RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)

I got some good late-night eats.

Maggie hesitates a moment. Then she opens the door and lets

him in.

INT. ENTER THE DRAGON NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

A bored-looking Fred is smooshed between the Chubby Blondes

on the bed.

It was the greys--you know, the

tall, skinny aliens--and they were

all over my yard, but--and here's

the weird thing--I wasn't at all

afraid of them so when they asked

me if I wanted to get in their

spaceship, I said, 'Sure,' and I

walked right on.

Oh my God, you're so brave! I would

never, ever in a million years

climb into one of those things.

Fred, would you ever just walk into

a UFO on your own?

If they came right now I would,

sure.

MISSY FRANKENFIELD (O.S.)

There you are!

Fred looks up to see Missy Frankenfield approaching.

Oh my god! You're here!

Fred jumps off the bed and gives Missy a hug.

Franken-berry, how the heck are

ya?!

She returns the embrace, but not quite as tight.

You look incredible!

Thanks, Fred, you look good, too.

Never felt better.

Missy nods.

I have to say, I can't believe I'm

actually here--I was on my way home

from dinner when I noticed your

text. So what's this big emergency?

Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. By 'emergency' I

just meant that there's some

important stuff I want to talk to

you about. You know, one on one, me

and you--without all the husbands

and wives and hoopla. So how are

you?

I'm... good.

No, I mean how-are-you. Inside.

What's happenin' in there? There

must be all sorts of emotions

churning up with the divorce and

everything.

She gives him a long look.

Maybe we should go somewhere else--

this doesn't seem like the best

place to spill one's guts.

Just then, Coakley swoops in and pulls Fred aside.

What part of 'go ugly early' didn't

you understand? You've got a better

chance of winning husband-of-the-

year than tagging that chiquita.

Fred flinches at this.

But...I know her. She said she

wants to leave with me.

93.

Then she's insane--run for the

hills.

Coak, the woman's going through a

divorce. She's not insane, she's

just making really poor decisions

right now.

(hands him his car keys)

Here, give Rick the keys to my mini-

van. I'm gonna go back to the hotel

with Missy.

Coakley looks back at Missy and softens.

It's your funeral, princess.

BACK ON RICK AND LEIGH dancing up a storm. Rick is OUT OF

BREATH and SWEATING LIKE A PIG. His shirt is soaked and his

hair is dripping wet.

Are you okay--you keep checking

your pulse?

Nah, I'm fine. I had a little chest

cramp during the last song, but I

worked through it.

She smiles at this.

Come on, let's sit this one out. I

need a breather.

They move to the bar and Rick starts DRYING HIMSELF with a

stack of cocktail napkins.

So what's up with the ring?

He looks at his finger, then back at her.

Um...have you ever heard of a hall

pass?

EXT. BALL TEAM BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

Grace pulls up in her Camry and gets out. She hears MUSIC

coming from inside and hesitates a BEAT before walking

nervously onto the porch and KNOCKING. A moment later Gerry

appears in the doorway.

There she is! Come on in, I'm

mixing up some margaronis. We lost

our final game, but I got four

hits!

94.

Oh. Great. Uh, where is everyone?

They all went out to party--now get

in here!

But Grace stays on the porch.

Gerry, I'm sorry but I can't stay.

What?

Grace hasn't been in this situation in a long time and it

shows. Gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned.

Is everything okay?

Yeah, yeah, everything's fine,

but...

(holds up gift box)

.I can't accept this.

Why not?

Grace does a double-take.

Gerry, I'm a married woman.

Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt. She hands him the

box and he reluctantly accepts it.

Um... I'm sorry if I made you

uncomfortable, Grace. It's just

that...I really like you.

I like you, too, Gerry, and you

didn't make me uncomfortable.

She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's

some serious eye-contact, and then BAM!

They DIVE AT EACH OTHER and start SUCKING FACE LIKE THERE'S

NO TOMORROW. As they continue to MAUL EACH OTHER, they

STUMBLE INTO THE HOUSE, and we

INT. ENTER THE DRAGON NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

Rick and Leigh are leaning against the bar.

So...you're married?

I wasn't deliberately hiding it.

He holds up his ring hand.

Yeah, I just thought your wife had

died or something and you were

wearing it out of respect.

Uh, nope. She's still hangin' in

there.

Just then, Coakley PULLS RICK ASIDE.

Come on, you're not gonna close the

sale here--let's move this clambake

back to my place.

Okay, but what am I gonna do there?

What do you mean, what are you

gonna do? I've got a house with

bedrooms--do the math. When it

doesn't work out with her--which it

won't--there's going to be a bunch

of other back-up chicks there.

Rick nods then turns to Leigh.

My buddy's inviting everybody back

to his crib.

Sounds cool.

As they walk toward the exit, we

INT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Fred and Missy are walking down the hallway toward his room.

I've got to be honest, Fred... I'm

not really sure what we're doing

here.

What do you mean? We're hangin',

we're connecting--that's what

friends do. Especially if they want

to take it to the next level where

they can call each other 'good

friends.'

96.

He comes to his room and starts to unlock the door.

You're married, Fred.

Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Fred opens the door but Missy stays in the hall.

What does blah-blah mean? You are

still married, right?

Happily. Look, I don't want to get

into all the details, but my wife

gave me this one-time deal where I

get to be with another woman.

He opens the door wide. She looks at him for a BEAT.

I thought we were going to the

hotel bar?

We are. There's a mini-bar in my

room. You better hurry up, it's

last call.

Fred smiles.

Are you out of your flippin' mind?

Fred loses the smile.

Um...

Are you out of your mind?!

I'm going to be honest with you--

your tone right now is scaring me.

You call me up for the first time

in your life, claim you have some

kind of emergency, and it turns out

that you just want to screw me?!

Or not.

Well, screw you, Fred!

She starts walking down the hallway. Fred nods, unfazed.

97.

Nail on the head!

She turns and glares at him.

What?

What you just said--I had that

coming. Big time.

Fred hangs his head.

Seriously, Missy, I...I don't know

what's gotten into me this week. I

think I must be having some kind of

mid-life crisis or something

because I've been acting like a

real jackass.

Anyway ease forgive me. I

really am very, very sorry and

ashamed.

Missy, standing a few feet away, finally calms down.

Okay. Whatever.

Thank you.

LONG BEAT.

So ... . you want to come in for

that drink?

He arches an eyebrow.

Fuck you, Fred!

Missy STORMS away.

'No thank you' would have sufficed.

Fred walks into his room and closes the door.

INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Fred goes to the mini-bar and pours himself a drink. He

looks around the room. The week's over and he's failed

miserably. He sits on the bed. Alone.

Then a KNOCK. Fred gets up and opens the door.

98.

Hi. May I help you?

REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS Paige's Aunt Meg. She's wearing a

skirt and low-cut tank top and has cougar written all over

her.

Rick, my name's Meg. I'm your

babysitter Paige's aunt, and I just

wanted to come over here and tell

you this: They don't make men like

you anymore.

She smiles.

Oh. Well, thank you.

Would you like to come in?

EXT. BALL CLUB BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

A guilt-ridden Grace is just finishing GETTING DRESSED when

Gerry comes out of the bathroom buttoning up his shirt.

Everything okay?

Yeah. Yeah. It's just ...no,

everything's not okay.

What?

He moves close to her and she grows uncomfortable.

Look, you're a great cguy, Gerry,

and you're very charming and very

sweet and the last thing I wanted

to do was hurt your feelings,

but...well, what,just happened can

never happen again.

Gerry looks confused.

Oh.

I know it's probably hard for you

to understand but...I love my

husband.

So? What does that have to do with

anything? Fate threw us together

and we went with it--isn't that

what life's all about?

99.

Grace looks at him, recognizing the youth and triteness of

his words.

Not always.

It wasn't fair to my husband... and

it wasn't fair to you because this

could never become anything more

than just.. .what it was.

She looks at him and shrugs apologetically. Gerry BARKS out

a LAUGH.

I know that.

You do?

Of course I do. Jeez. I mean, no

offense, but let's face it, you're

a lot older than me.

She flinches, a little embarrassed. A quick reality check

for Grace.

Right.

I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm

just saying, I didn't think we were

going to start dating, you know?

Could you imagine the looks we'd

get? It'd be like Hugh Hefner and

his girlfriends--except in reverse.

Gerry CHUCKLES.

You'd be Hugh Hefner.

Yeah, I got that part.

Gerry looks at his watch.

Ooh, I gotta get going. We have

kind of a team meeting in like

twenty minutes.

Gerry sees Grace glance at the clock: 12:15 A.M.

It's, uh, kind o a tradition that

we always get together on the night

of the last game. It would probably

be uncool if I missed it.

100.

You don't have to explain.

Seriously, though, thanks for

everything--that was awesome.

He holds up his hand and she diligently HIGH-FIVES HIM. Then

Gerry WALKS OUT THE DOOR. Grace sits there alone for a

moment. We PUSH IN ON HER and we hear Gerry's CAR START

OUTSIDE, and when Grace STARTS TO CRY, we

EXT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

This is a Tudor home in an upscale Brookline neighborhood.

We can hear 'Rage Against The Machine' BLASTING from the

street. There's thirty or so cars out front and PEOPLE are

still arriving.

INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SAME

The place is JAMMING. It's a nice house but under-furnished

in a bachelor pad kind of way. Rick and Leigh are in a

corner drinking beers.

I guess I still have a lot to get

out of my system before I do the

marriage trip. I'm one of those

people who wants to try everything

once before I die.

Have you ever been with a married

guy?

Leigh pauses, but she doesn't flinch.

No.

Neither have I.

Rick winces, but Leigh smiles at him. It's the moment of

truth.

I'd like to help you take being

with a married guy off your list of

things to do before you die.

You would?

Yes.

Leigh gets close.

101.

I don't want to be a home-wrecker.

I've got a one-time pass, remember?

That wasn't just a line?

No. It's for real.

Leigh seems intrigued. She moves closer still, takes his

hand.

So where can we go to talk some

more about this?

Um, Coakley has a game room

upstairs. We could.. .talk there.

WANNABE (O.S.)

Leigh!

Rick and Leigh look over to see an AGITATED Wannabe forcing

his way through the crowd.

Where have you...? Why didn't

you...? You knew this was my big

night! How could you just--?

(turns away, emotional)

Look, can I please talk to you in

private? Now.

Leigh looks apologetically at Rick.

Can you give me a second?

Sure.

Wannabe and Leigh walk a few feet away and Rick watches them

have an ANIMATED CONVERSATION. It appears Wannabe may even

be crying. Finally, Wannabe storms across the room but when

he gets to the door, he looks back at Leigh.

Well? Are you coming?

Leigh SIGHS, then approaches Rick.

I'm sorry, Rick. I have to go deal

with this.

Rick can't believe what's happening.

102.

Really? Now? I thought you said he

wasn't your boyfriend.

He's not...but he is a friend.

Leigh glances at the broken-down Wannabe standing there at

the door, then turns back to Rick.

I'm sorry.

Before Rick can stop her, Leigh LEAVES THE PARTY with

Wannabe. After a LONG BEAT, Rick slides down into a chair,

DEVASTATED.

INT. BEACH COTTAGE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Maggie is spilling her guts to Rick Coleman as he stands over

the stove MAKING PANCAKES.

.And he hasn't even spent one

night in his own bed this week.

Let me get this straight--you gave

him his freedom and now you're mad

that he's acting free?

This logic clearly stings Maggie.

RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)

Hey, I'm sure there's an

explanation. Maybe he took a trip

somewhere?

I called his assistant--he's been

in the office almost everyday.

Look, Maggie, for all you know your

husband's been working at a sou

kitchen, sleeping in his car al

week, and he's only gotten laid two

or three times at most.

She looks up and forces a smile.

Ha-ha.

Maggie checks her watch.

Jeez, I wonder what's taking Grace

so long?

103.

Well, if she went over to break the

kid's heart, the least she could do

is lend a sympathetic ear.

He flips a pancake onto a plate.

RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)

Prepare yourself for heaven.

She reaches for the plate, but he slaps her hand away.

RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)

Not so fast, lady. I'm not

finished. You have not lived until

you've had my steaming hot

blueberry pancakes...

He pulls a carton of vanilla ice cream out of a bag.

RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)

.A la mode.

Maggie smiles.

Oh My-lanta.

And to wash it all down...

Rick reaches into the bag and pulls out a DESSERT WINE. Off

Maggie's smile, we

INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A glum Rick is walking through the PACKED PARTY when he bumps

into Baker and Hog-Head standing around a keg with a GROUP OF

GUYS.

Hey. . .what are you guys doing here?

We're here for the hall pass.

Really? I thought you guys had

given up on us?

We did. We're here with them.

He nods toward RICK LEARY and WILLY BOSHANE, both early 40's

and paunchy.

What are you talking about?

104.

When Leary and Boshane heard about

your guy's hall pass, they

convinced their wives to give them

one, too.

A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having none

of it. He turns to Baker, livid.

You weren't supposed to tell anyone

about the hall pass!

They didn't say anything. Our wives

heard about it at the pool.

No! At the pool?!

Rick rubs his face, distressed.

Yep. And then about three days ago--

after some hard-core negotiating--

we managed to push the bill

through.

The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned.

Really? So...how's it going?

Solid. Very solid.

We're building mucho momentumo.

Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION.

Hey, Baker, a hall pass ain't just

about sex, you know.

That's right. It's about going

bowling and, uh, staying up late,

and being able to do what you want

to do when you want to do it.

Haven't gotten laid yet, huh?

It's a lot tougher than we thought

it would be.

Just then Gary comes around a corner.

105.

Hey, dudes, there's like ten very

bangable chicks out on the back

deck--let's go!

Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER.

To freedom!

The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck.

A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and

pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he

OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITH

LEIGH.

Hey, where are you going?

What are you doing...? I thought

you'd left.

No. I told you, I just had to talk

him off the ledge. I calmed him

down and sent him on his way.

Oh. Uh, great.

So where's that game room? I

thought we were gonna play some

games.

She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go...

INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Rick and Leigh walk down the hall to the game room. He opens

the door and flips on the light.

THEIR POV - there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a

bar, and a bed.

I'll be right back--I just have to

use the bathroom.

Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears

into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it.

Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the

hallway and pushes open a door.

COAKLEY (O.S.)

Hey.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals Coakley SITTING ALL ALONE in a small

study off the hall. He has a bowl of Cap'n Crunch on his lap

and is watching a re-run of The Andy Griffith Show.

106.

Hey. How come you're not downstairs

partying?

Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile.

All partied out, pal.

Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at the

TV.

Man, that Barney Fife still kills

me.

He looks back to Rick.

Hey, I was thinking about this hall-

pass business. It's really ironic,

isn't it?

Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned.

How's that?

Well think about it. There's two

kinds of guys who cheat on their

wives: The guy who does it behind

her back, and a guy like you who

has his wife's permission.

Well it's not really cheating if I

have permission.

Yeah, whatever. The point is, if

you asked a hundred people who the

better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em

would pick you, because you're

being honest--there's no deceit

involved.

Rick is growing uncomfortable.

But the funny thing is, the other

guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he

has to live with all that guilt and

anxiety, while his wife's running

around happy as a clam because she

doesn't know anything. And you, the

good guy, you've got no guilt at

all because you just laid it all on

your wife's shoulders.

Well I didn't really think of it

107.

It's like she's your guilt Sherpa!

Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates.

Funny, huh?

Yeah.

And that, my friend, is why you are

a genius.

As Rick lets this all sink in, we

INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Paige's Aunt Meg is sitting on the couch. Her legs are

crossed revealing a lot of skin. Fred hands her a glass of

wine and sits beside her.

Cheers.

They CLINK glasses.

Rick, I hope you don't mind me

tracking you down--Paige told me

where you were staying.

Please. Not at all.

You've been very sweet to her.

Fred waves her off.

Hey, she's a good kid. I do what I

can for the kids.

Aunt Meg moves in a little closer, squints at him sweetly.

She told me everything. And I have

to say, I was very impressed.

Hm?

I know she tried to hook-up with

you--twice in fact--and that you

set her straight both times.

Fred hadn't heard this from Rick and is a little confused.

108.

Uh...hook-up?

Rick, enough with the chivalry.

Paige wanted to sleep with you and

you didn't take advantage of her.

I'm just saying that's very cool.

He shrugs modestly.

Well... she's a kid and kids get

crushes. I remember in tenth grade

I had the biggest crush on my

French teacher--thank God Mr.

LeClaire was professional enough to

only date seniors.

Meg GIGGLES.

I'm serious, it takes a certain

kind of guy to say no to a

beautiful young girl like that--

especially since you have your

wi e's permission now.

Meg shoots him a knowing smile and puts her glass down.

AUNT MEG (CONT'D)

I like that, Rick. You have morals.

She leans in and KISSES HIS NECK. Fred glances down at her

breasts.

Hey, all you have in this world is

your word.

As Aunt Meg CLIMBS ON TOP OF FRED, we

INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - GAME ROOM - NIGHT

Rick ENTERS to find Leigh playing a pinball machine. Leigh

turns and smiles at Rick.

Leigh, I gotta split.

What?

Yeah, I kind of hit a wall.

She can hardly believe her ears.

109.

Really? Are you feeling okay?

You're not mad because I went

outside with my friend, are you?

No, no, no. Look, I shouldn't be

doing this. I have.. .you know,

commitments.

Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her

DRESS FALLS TO THE FLOOR. Suddenly she's NAKED before him

and she's PERFECT.

Um, you dropped something.

For a moment nobody moves. We can almost hear Rick's heart

beat. Then Leigh STEPS CLOSER to him and Rick instinctively

leans back.

Relax. Don't think so much. You're

gonna have your wife for the rest

of your life, but tonight. . .you

have me.

Leigh smiles. And it's the kind of smile you only get two or

three times in your life, if you're lucky, and probably never

from a woman this beautiful.

She reaches down and UNBUCKLES HIS PANTS, then she PULLS OFF

HIS SHIRT. They stand face-to-face now, the middle-aged guy

and the young beauty, and it's happening exactly the way Rick

had hoped it would, the dream.

She presses her body against his and STARTS TO KISS HIS NECK,

her hand DISAPPEARING SOMEWHERE BELOW HIS WAIST. Then she

leans her head AGAINST HIS CHEST. As he looks down at her,

we PUSH IN on a suddenly conflicted Rick.

Nope. I can't do this.

He reaches for his shirt.

What are you doing?

I'm sorry.

She stares at him, confused, as he buckles his pants.

Your wife didn't give you a hallway

permission slip, did she?

110.

Yes, she did, but... look, you're

insanely beautiful and

pathologically sexy and every cell

in my body is telling me to dust do

this, but--

Rick points to his chest.

See this area, this spot right

here? The first time Maggie and I

slept together, back in college,

she fell asleep right here. And she

left a puddle of drool. And it

didn't bother me. It actually felt

good. That's when I knew I was

going to marry her.

And when my kids--Emma and Gunnar--

when they were babies, this is

where they slept. Or sometimes at

four o'clock in the morning Emma

would just lay there and stare up

at me. It was where we first got to

know each other.

So I'm sorry, Leigh, but as amazing

as I think you are...I gotta go

home.

Rick shrugs apologetically.

Well, I think you have a screw

loose and you're probably going to

regret this for the rest of your

life, but. . .right on, man.

Um...do you want me to give you a

ride home?

No. It's only one-thirty--I'm going

back down to the party.

Rick raises two fingers.

Peace it.

R-O-C-K in the U-S-A.

As they smile at each other one last time, we

INT. FRED'S MINIVAN - NIGHT

Rick is pulling away from Coakley's house when the car phone

RINGS. Rick pushes a button to ANSWER.

Hello.

MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)

Yes, is this Fred Searing?

Oh, uh, no, I'm sorry, he's not

here right now. I'm using his car.

MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)

Well, would you know where I could

find him? This is Sgt. Polisner of

the Massachusetts State Police.

As Rick grows alarmed, we

INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Fred is still on the couch with Aunt Meg on the floor in

front of him. Fred's PANTS ARE DOWN TO HIS ANKLES, leaving

him with only his boxers on. Meg KISSES HIS CHEST and

STOMACH, then leans back and TAKES OFF HER TANK-TOP,

revealing EXTRA-LARGE BAZOOKAS stuffed into a slinky bra.

I'm attracted to men with

integrity.

Thanks--wow, you got great jugs.

Meg takes Fred's hand and leads him toward the bed (with his

pants still at his ankles), Fred WADDLING LIKE A PENGUIN.

Moral-guy's a tit-man, huh?

Well, I grew up in the midwest.

She pushes him down on the bed and Fred quickly kicks off his

pants and shoes (but keeps his boxers on.) Meg TACKLES him

and the two of them start to roll around UNDER THE COVERS.

An O.S. Fred seems to be working his way down her stomach.

Oh yes! Rick... please...I want you

to make love to me.

Just then Rick BURSTS INTO THE ROOM, out of breath. Fred and

Meg come up from under the covers. (Fred is at waist-level on

her.)

Fred, I need to talk to you!

Meg GLARES down at Fred, confused.

112.

Fred? I thought you were Rick?!

I'm Rick.

Fred cowers guiltily.

Please don't judge me.

As Aunt Meg KARATE KICKS Fred in the face, we

EXT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Fred, now dressed, hurries across the parking lot with Rick

on his heels. Fred has BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE stuffed up his

nose.

What did they tell you? Is Grace

gonna be okay?

All I know is she was in a car

accident and they rushed her to the

hospital.

Oh my God...

Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING. They look up and

REACT.

THEIR POV - From fifty yards across the parking lot, they can

see that Fred's mini-van's windshield has just been BASHED IN

by the BAT-WIELDING Wannabe. On the side of the vehicle is

spray-painted: HORNY OLD MAN.

Whoa!!! What the hell...?!

Wannabe turns to them, a CRAZED LOOK on his face.

How do you like me now, Splenda-

boy?

You moron, that's Lny car! His is

the one next to it!

Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon, PULLS OUT A KNIFE, and

quickly SLASHES TWO OF RICK'S TIRES. As Rick and Fred RUN

TOWARD HIM, Wannabe JUMPS INTO AN OLD BRONCO and PEELS OUT OF

THE PARKING LOT.

BACK ON Rick and Fred as they slow down and CATCH THEIR

BREATHS.

Nice job, Fred.

Fred's hair as if they were on a motorcycle. Fred tries his

car phone as he drives.

Oh come on! How can a hospital not

It's four in the morning, Fred.

Fred hangs up and pounds his steering wheel.

What was I thinking?! I had a great

wife--a beautiful wife--and now I

may lose her.. .because of you.

What are you talking about?! You

said our wives were living their

dreams, with their fancy gas ovens,

and that our dream was the hall

pass! How can you blame this on

me?!

I'd never even heard of a hall pass

until you flaunted yours in my

face! 'Hey, look at me, I've got a

hall pass--everyone should have a

hall pass!' You ruined my life,

Mills!

EXT. BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT

Maggie and Rick Coleman sit on the back deck DRINKING WINE.

This is a great place.

Yeah, my family's had it since I

was a kid. We used to come for a

week a summer, then two weeks, then

a month, then by the time I got to

high school we were living here all

summer long.

114.

Something's wrong here, Maggie.

Hm?

Something's wrong with a guy who

would leave a woman like you alone

for this long.

Well, you know...I did give him a

hall pass.

So what? If you were my girl, I

wouldn't have taken it.

An awkward moment. Rick touches her hand and Maggie looks

away.

RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)

You deserve way better.

Uh, in Rick's defense, he didn't

really even want the hall pass. I

kind of forced it on him.

Why would you do that?

Maggie thinks about this.

I don't know.

I guess I felt like he wasn't

noticing me anymore. j guess I

wanted to feel.. .desired again. And

the truth is, in my heart, I never

thought he'd go through with it.

He brushes her hair from her face and they look into each

other's eyes. He leans in and she does, too, and right when

it looks like THEY MAY KISS, Maggie hesitates as suddenly

EVERYTHING BECOMES CLEAR TO HER.

Oh my God...

What?

This hall pass ...it wasn't for him.

It was...for me.

And as they hang on that realization, we

Okay, just take it easy, buddy.

No, I won't take it easy! Look, I'm

sorry I was speeding and I

shouldn't have run from you guys,

but my wife's been in an accident

and she's in this emergency room

and I gotta see how she is

because...

.THAT WOMAN'S MY WHOLE LIFE!

The cops look moved and unsure what to do.

Are you the husband of...

(glances down at chart)

.Grace Searing?

Fred strains to look up.

Yes! Is she okay?!

The Doctor hesitates and the cops look at each other and then

the Burly Officer releases Rick from his head-lock.

All right, let him up.

The young officers get off Fred and help him up. Fred rushes

to the Doctor, who seems very serious.

Please tell me she's gonna be okay.

She is. Your wife broke her nose

and she got shaken up a bit, but

all in all she's a very lucky

woman.

You got that wrong, doc. I'm the

lucky one.

Fred is visibly relieved as the doctor smiles and walks off.

Bless you, doctor!

Fred turns to Rick and the two men hug and then Rick grabs

Fred by the shoulders and looks him in the eye.

118.

You take care of that woman, buddy,

and I'm gonna go home and take care

of mine.

Fred nods, emotional, as the cops look at each other,

unmoved. Rick starts to walk away.

Rick...

Rick stops and turns at the door.

You go love that lady!

The Burly Officer rolls his eyes and steps up to Rick.

Uh, before you 'go love that lady',

we're going to have to write you

guys up.

As the officer pulls out his CITATION PAD, we

EXT. BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT

Rick pulls up in the wrecked mini-van and gets out.

INT. BEACH COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Rick steps quietly into the house. He sees two empty bottles

of wine and two half-filled glasses on the coffee table.

Then he hears Maggie's O.S. VOICE coming from the bedroom.

MAGGIE (O.S.)

Oh my god...oh my god...oh my

and...

ON RICK - he looks concerned as he approaches the bedroom

door.

INT. BEACH COTTAGE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rick ENTERS to find Maggie laying in bed... TALKING ON THE

PHONE.

Oh my god... oh my god, you poor

thing.

Maggie looks up, shocked to see Rick.

Hold on, Rick just walked in.

Grace was in a car accident!

119.

I know. She's okay.

Maggie goes back to the phone.

And they let you go?

Okay... so you're on your way?

Great.

I love you, too, honey.

She hangs up.

What?

25th, 1988 at approximately ten-

Maggie thinks about this.

What are you talking about? We were

dating then.

Rick nods. She looks at him, not sure if she understands.

You were my first. And you were my

last. And you were everything in

between.

As it all sinks in, Maggie STARTS TO WELL UP.

Really?

Really.

So...is that why you were crying

that first night?

Rick shrugs, embarrassed.

And I was...I was your last?

You are my only. Forever.

120.

Maggie smiles and runs into his arms. They KISS, and it's a

real kiss, the kind they haven't had in a long while.

Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:

EXT. BEACH COTTAGE - DAWN

van pulls up and Fred gets out. (Fred has a BLACK EYE.) He

TWO BLACK EYES and her nose is HEAVILY BANDAGED.) When the

taxi drives off, Fred helps Grace toward the house.

.And what were you doing driving

around at one o'clock in the

morning?

Well...I was upset so I went for a

drive--you know, to think--and I

must have hit a patch of sand, and

before I knew it I was into the

pole.

Fred stops and looks her in the eye.

I'm sorry, Grace.

For what?

For putting you through all this.

Grace looks awash in guilt.

It's not your fault, Fred.

Yes, it is--of course it's my

fault. This isn't you--driving

around all night, thinking--you're

not a thinker.

When she looks up at him, he forces a smile. But she doesn't

smile back.

Look, Fred, we have to talk

about... about what happened this

week.

Fred takes a DEEP BREATH and looks around, trying to avoid

the moment.

121.

Grace. . .do we really have to do

this?

Grace lowers her head guiltily.

Yeah. Yeah, we do.

When she looks back up, she NOTICES the SPRAY-PAINTED and

BATTERED MINI-VAN.

Horny old man?

Oh, no, honey, that's not me--they

were talking about Rick.

Grace looks at him, confused. Suddenly Fred falls to his

knees.

Look, all you gotta know is that

whatever happened doesn't matter! I

love you and only you! And I'm

going to treat you like the queen

that you are for the rest of your

living days, so help me God! I'll

mow the lawn, I'll shovel the snow,

I'll wash the stubble off the

sink...

Grace looks down at him.

.But please, I'm begging you,

sweetie... can we please just never

talk about what happened this week?

Grace's eyes flicker about, hardly believing her luck.

Um...deal.

Fred gets up and THROWS HIS ARMS AROUND HIS WIFE.

I love you, Fred.

As they embrace, Fred sees Rick come out the front door with

his arm around Maggie. Fred shoots Rick a THUMBS-UP.

CLOSE ON RICK AND MAGGIE as they smile at Fred and Grace.

Come on, you two! We're gonna go

watch the sun come up!

Hall & Oates's 'When The Morning Comes' begins to play and as

our two HAPPY COUPLES hold hands and walk off toward the

beach, we pull up, up, up, and...
